<p class="small">LOST ON A HEATH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, at the latter end of April, a few
years ago, just as it was becoming dusk, a young
man, extremely well favoured and well proportioned,
took his way on foot across an extensive
heath in one of our southern counties.</p>

<p>Hilary St. Ives&mdash;for so was he named&mdash;might
he about one or two and twenty. Rather dark,
perhaps, but strikingly handsome. Features
regular and well cut; complexion olive; locks
jet black; eyes dark and shaded by long eyelashes

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

that tempered their fire; beard black and of a
silken texture. Altogether, as fine a young man
as you could desire to see. A Tweed walking
suit and round felt hat constituted his costume.
Across his broad shoulders were strapped a knapsack
and a waterproof coat, and he carried a stout
stick in his hand.</p>

<p>Our young traveller was bound for the village
of Wootton, which was situated at the further side
of the heath, where he had learnt there was a good
inn, at which he proposed to rest for the night.
He had walked far that day, and having dined
early and somewhat sparingly, was quite ready for
supper. In fact, the keen air and exercise made
him feel ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>As far as he could judge&mdash;for he was a stranger
to the country&mdash;three miles still lay between him
and the desired haven. Nothing to so stout a
pedestrian as he. But if the distance could be

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

shortened so much the better. He would be
sooner at the inn and supper would be sooner set
before him.</p>

<p>After looking in the direction where he supposed
Wootton lay, and studying, as far as he was
able, the intervening ground, he came to the conclusion
that a considerable angle might be cut off
by quitting the high road, and crossing the heath
as a crow would wing its flight over it. All very
well in the day-time, but the shades of night were
gathering rapidly, and the gloom was increased
by a mist that arose from an adjacent marsh.</p>

<p>Hilary, however, had no misgivings&mdash;no idea
of the risk he might run. He was not aware
that between him and Wootton lay a deep and
dangerous morass, which could only be safely
traversed by one familiar with the locality.</p>

<p>Wootton Heath, though partially reclaimed, still
comprehended many miles of wholly uncultivated

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

land. Being undrained, some portions of the waste
were marshy, and about half a mile to the left of
the road, along which our young traveller was
wending his way, lay the extensive morass to
which we have just adverted.</p>

<p>On the other side the heath was less swampy,
and being covered by a short thymy turf, was well
adapted to sheep pasture. When enlivened by
sunshine, the wide expanse, purpled by heather,
embellished by fern and clusters of tall gorse, with
here and there a grey old thorn or a holly, presented
a charming picture. The limits of the
heath were marked on the right by a broad belt
of firs overtopped by the white spire of a newly
built church. On the left the boundary was undefined,
the village of Wootton being invisible.
Three or four little knolls or hillocks rising in the
midst of the waste were crowned with clumps of
pines, and contributed to the beauty of the landscape.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

<p>Before quitting the high road Hilary looked
around in quest of some one to direct him to
Wootton. Not a human being was in sight. Not
a sound was heard, except the bleating of sheep
and the distant barking of a watch-dog. The
heath was perfectly solitary. However, our young
traveller did not hesitate; but striking off on the
left, where, as we have explained, the danger lay,
he speeded over the elastic turf.</p>

<p>In this manner he had soon accomplished nearly
half a mile, without encountering any obstacle,
except such as was presented by clumps of gorse,
intermingled with briers, and was congratulating
himself on his cleverness, when the swampy nature
of the ground brought him to a sudden standstill.</p>

<p>Not a minute too soon. Had he taken many
steps farther, he would have been engulfed in
the treacherous morass. He understood his danger,
and perceiving that the quagmire must be impassable,

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

and not liking to skirt it, he turned back,
as much provoked with himself as he had previously
been well satisfied.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to regain the high road, which
he had so imprudently quitted, but bewildered by
the gloom&mdash;for it was now quite dark&mdash;he failed
in discovering it, and after wandering about for
nearly half an hour, again found himself on the
verge of the morass.</p>

<p>This was indeed vexatious. But confident that
by pursuing a straight course he must eventually
reach the road, he turned back at once. Unluckily,
his course was not straight. Without being aware
of it, he deviated from the direct line, and to his
infinite surprise and mortification, found himself,
for the third time, on the borders of the morass.</p>

<p>He was now quite confounded, and began to
think he must be condemned to move in a magic
circle.</p>

<p>Another half hour found him only more hopelessly

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

involved. By no efforts could he discover
the road, though he appeared to have no difficulty
in finding the morass. Uneasy thoughts beset
him. He shuddered at the idea of passing the
night on the dark and dreary heath. But he soon
took heart. Though constantly baffled, he would
not succumb, until forced to do so by sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>Vainly did he attempt to extricate himself from
the magic circle. As surely as he went on, so
surely did he come back to the inevitable point.
At last, he was brought to a halt. Carefully as he
proceeded, he contrived to roll down a hollow,
and when he recovered from the fall he sat down
on the brink of the pit to reflect; the bitterness
of his reflections being aggravated by the tantalising
picture summoned up by his fancy of the
snug parlour at the inn, with the hot supper in
preparation.</p>

<p>Heavens! how hungry he felt. Springing to

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

his feet he set off again, but presently got entangled
in a thick cluster of gorse.</p>

<p>But help was now at hand. While he was
struggling out of the gorse, voices reached his ears,
and he instantly hastened in the direction whence
the sounds proceeded, shouting lustily as he
went.</p>

<p>Instead of responding to his outcries, the interlocutors
became suddenly mute, and the darkness
did not permit him to distinguish them.</p>

<p>After a moment's pause, he called out again.
This time, a gruff voice demanded who he was,
and what he wanted? Hilary replied that he was
a traveller, who had lost his way on the heath,
and pressing on as he spoke, soon descried two
sturdy-looking vagabonds, who were standing in a
more open spot, tranquilly awaiting his approach.
The fellows were roughly clad, and had the appearance
of gipsies, and their looks and deportment

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

inspired Hilary with distrust. On their part,
the gipsies eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>As he came up, the surly fellow who had first
addressed him, asked if he wanted to be smothered
in the bog, that he ventured near it on so dark a
night.</p>

<p>"I have no such desire," replied Hilary. "Like
a fool I must needs quit the high road, and I have
paid the penalty for my folly by being kept
wandering about on the brink of the marsh for
two hours at least."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" laughed the gipsy. "Pleasant
pastime on a dark night. You may thank your
stars it's no worse. It's easier to get into a bog
than to get out of it, as many a poor devil has
found to his cost."</p>

<p>"I want to go to Wootton!" cried Hilary, who
did not like this jesting; "will you show me the
way?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

<p>"The nearest way lies straight on," said the
man.</p>

<p>"Why that will take me to the marsh!" cried
Hilary.</p>

<p>"To be sure it will!" exclaimed the other gipsy,
with a coarse laugh. "Seth Cooper is gammoning
you. You must go round about, if you want
to get safely to Wootton."</p>

<p>"Why need you trouble yourself about him,
Reuben!" cried Seth Cooper. "What is it to you
if he should be drownded."</p>

<p>"Not much, certainly. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will half a crown tempt you to show me the
road?" interrupted Hilary.</p>

<p>"I should say not," returned Seth Cooper.
"Do you rate your life at only half a crown's
valley?"</p>

<p>"Make it half a crown a-piece," quoth Reuben,
who seemed of milder mood than his companion,
"and we'll consider about it."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

<p>"Well," cried the young man, "put me in the
right way to Wootton, and you shall have what
you ask."</p>

<p>"Money down, or we don't budge," cried Seth
Cooper.</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Hilary, in a determined tone.
"Bring me to the high road, and I'll pay you.
But not a stiver till then."</p>

<p>Seth made some growling observations, but his
companion signified his assent to the young man's
proposal, and the pair at once moved off, bearing
towards the right. Hilary, who had now quite
recovered his energies, followed them.</p>

<p>After trudging along in silence for a few
minutes, Reuben hung back, and in a more civil
tone than he had previously adopted, inquired of
Hilary if he had travelled far that day?</p>

<p>"Farther than you would like to travel on foot,
I reckon," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"Then you must have had a long tramp," returned

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

Reuben, laughing. "Many's the time I've
done my forty miles, and been none the worse
for it."</p>

<p>"But you warn't incommoded with a heavy
knapsack," remarked Seth Cooper, turning round.
"Why don't you offer to carry it for the gemman?"</p>

<p>"Come, no nonsense!" cried Hilary, sternly.
"Leave my knapsack alone. You'd best."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" rejoined Seth.
"Do you think we want to rob you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"You would find it no easy job if you made
the attempt. Move on, I say, and keep well in
front."</p>

<p>But instead of complying, both men stopped.</p>

<p>"It seems you don't like our company, master,"
remarked Reuben. "That being the case, you'd
better go on alone."</p>

<p>"You made a bargain with me, and I expect

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

you to fulfil your part of it, as I mean to fulfil
mine," said Hilary, in a bold, authoritative tone.
"I insist upon your conducting me to the high
road."</p>

<p>"First tell us what you've got in that ere
knapsack," remarked Seth. "We should like to
know."</p>

<p>"Would you? Then I don't intend to gratify
your curiosity. I would fain believe you to be
honest men."</p>

<p>"Why, what else do you take us for?" cried
Seth, fiercely. "Out with it. Let's know your
mind."</p>

<p>His manner clearly intimated violence, but his
comrade dragged him off, and they went on as
before. The high road was not far distant, and
on reaching it, they both faced about.</p>

<p>"That's the way to Wootton," said Reuben.
"We'll now wish you good night."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

<p>"Not afore he has settled with us," cried Seth.</p>

<p>While Hilary was searching for the money,
Seth rushed suddenly upon him, and seizing him
by the throat, with a choking grip, bore him to
the ground. Hilary struggled desperately, and
would have freed himself, if Reuben had not
come to his comrade's assistance.</p>

<p>Seth then possessed himself of the stick, and
beat the luckless young man with it about the
head till he rendered him insensible.</p>

<p>The two ruffians next proceeded to despoil their
victim, took off his knapsack, and were proceeding
to empty his pockets and pluck the guard-chain
from his neck, when the noise of wheels alarmed
them.</p>

<p>A dog-cart was coming on at a quick pace, and
its lamp, together with the light of the cigars
they were smoking, showed there were two persons
in the vehicle. These persons appeared to be

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

known to Reuben, for he remarked to his comrade,
who was still kneeling upon his victim's chest.</p>

<p>"It's old Radcliffe, of Hazlemere, and his
nevey, young Oswald Woodcot. We must be off.
But first let us drag the poor devil out of the
road, or he'll be run over."</p>

<p>"Never mind if he is," rejoined Seth Cooper.
"If I'd had my own way, we should have done
the job where we met him, and then we could
have flung the body into the bog, and no more
would have been heard of him."</p>

<p>Here the rapid advance of the dog-cart forced
him to abandon part of his booty, and he disappeared
with his comrade amid the furze-bushes.</p>

<p>The disaster apprehended by Reuben seemed
imminent. Luckily, however, Mr. Radcliffe descried
the body of the unfortunate young man
lying in the middle of the road and pulled up
just in time.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

<p>"Who-oh, Spanker!" he cried. "What's that,
a sack, or a man? Get down, Oswald, and see
what it is."</p>

<p>His nephew flung away his cigar, descended
at once, and immediately afterwards called out,
in accents of horror,</p>

<p>"It's a man&mdash;murdered, I fear."</p>

<p>"Murdered! bless me! I hope not," cried Mr.
Radcliffe, who was likewise greatly horrified.
"Take the lamp, Oswald, and make a careful
examination. I'd get down myself, but, as you
know, Spanker won't stand."</p>

<p>And, as if to confirm the statement, the mettlesome
horse snorted, and exhibited signs of
impatience.</p>

<p>"He's a young man, uncle&mdash;a very fine young
man," exclaimed Oswald, throwing the light of
the lamp upon Hilary's pallid and blood-stained
visage. "Roughly handled, but not dead. He

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

breathes, and I think may recover. It would
seem that he has only just been attacked, and
probably we have disturbed his assailants."</p>

<p>"Why do you imagine the poor fellow has
been attacked by more than one person, Oswald?"</p>

<p>"For this reason, uncle. Such a powerfully
built young fellow, as he appears to be, would
have beaten any ordinary ruffian, unless he had
been taken unawares."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who he is?"</p>

<p>"Not the least. Never saw him before. He
looks like a gentleman. There's a signet ring on
his finger. I wonder the villains didn't take it.
Perhaps they hadn't time, for they've left his
watch and guard-chain. What's to be done,
uncle? We can't leave him here."</p>

<p>"Of course not," rejoined Mr. Radcliffe. "It's
a mercy I didn't run over him. I should never
have forgiven myself if I had."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

<p>"Well, uncle, the best plan will be for you
to drive as fast as you can to Malham's, the
surgeon's at Wootton, and procure assistance.
I'll stay with the poor fellow."</p>

<p>"No, no; that won't do. The villains may be
lurking about. If we could only manage to get
him into the dog-cart, we might take him to the
surgery. Can he move at all?"</p>

<p>"I'll see."</p>

<p>As Oswald, who was a stalwart young fellow
himself, essayed to lift the injured man, the latter
exhibited some slight consciousness, but he was
so stunned and confused that considerable difficulty
was experienced in getting him into the
dog-cart. This being accomplished at last, he
was sustained by Oswald, while Mr. Radcliffe
drove on at a quick pace towards Wootton.</p>

<p>As they speeded over the heath, the rapidity
of the motion in some degree revived Hilary, and

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

he endeavoured to explain what had befallen him.
Mr. Radcliffe and his nephew, however, deemed it
prudent not to put too many questions to him.</p>

<p>On reaching Wootton, Mr. Radcliffe drove at
once to the surgery. Luckily, Mr. Malham was
within, and having carefully washed the coagulated
blood from the wounded man's dark locks
and sponged his brow, he pronounced that he
was not seriously injured. There was no fracture
of the skull. A stimulant administered to the
sufferer tended greatly to restore him.</p>

<p>Meantime, Oswald, leaving the injured man to
the care of the surgeon, set off in quest of the
police, and he now returned with an officer, to
whom Hilary detailed all particulars of the murderous
attack made upon him, describing his
assailants as well as he could, and mentioning
the names by which they had addressed each
other.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

<p>Wormald, the officer, who seemed an active
and intelligent man, listened attentively to what
was told him, and remarked that he had no doubt
the men were gipsies&mdash;Cooper being a common
name among the vagabonds. Wootton Heath,
he said, was infested by the vagabonds. Two
men, answering to the description given of the
robbers, had been seen about the village lately.
They were tinkers. Wormald felt certain he
should be able to effect their capture before
morning.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall recover my knapsack," said
Hilary. "It contains nothing of any value,
except some papers, which are of great importance
to myself. I would rather lose a good sum
of money than those documents."</p>

<p>On hearing this, the officer looked rather grave,
and so did Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," remarked Wormald, "for

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

saying that you ought not to have placed important
documents in a knapsack."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," observed Mr. Radcliffe, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel I did wrong," said Hilary.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think you will lose them, as
they can't be of any value to these rascals," said
the officer.</p>

<p>"You mustn't let the scent get cold, Wormald,"
cried Oswald. "The sooner you give chase the
better."</p>

<p>"I can guess pretty well where I'm likely to
meet with the rogues, sir," said the officer, confidently.
"I and my mate, Barker, will mount
and be on their track in less than ten minutes.
But you haven't yet told me your name, sir."</p>

<p>"Hilary St. Ives&mdash;that's my name," replied
the young man.</p>

<p>"From Cornwall?" inquired Oswald.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

<p>"No," replied the other; but he gave no
further information. "You'll find me at the
inn," he added to the officer.</p>

<p>"No, you won't, Wormald," cried Mr. Radcliffe.
"You'll find Mr. St. Ives at Hazlemere.
I mean to take him home with me."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied the officer. And with
a salute he departed.</p>

<p>"You won't be in bad quarters at Hazlemere,
I can promise you, Mr. St. Ives," observed
Oswald. "My uncle, though I say it to his
face, is the jolliest old gentleman in the county."</p>

<p>"At all events, you'll be more comfortable
with me than you would be at the George, though
you wouldn't be badly off there," said Mr. Radcliffe.
"My housekeeper, Mrs. Sutton, will take
good care of you&mdash;eh, Malham?"</p>

<p>"Mr. St. Ives couldn't be in better hands than
Mrs. Sutton's," returned the surgeon. "And he
<i>will</i> require a nurse, for he mustn't expect to

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

escape without a little fever. It wouldn't surprise
me if he were laid up for two or three days."</p>

<p>"You hear that, Mr. Radcliffe," said Hilary.
"Doesn't that alarm you? "</p>

<p>"Not in the least. Mrs. Sutton is an excellent
nurse, as Mr. Malham can testify."</p>

<p>"That I can, sir. Though Mr. St. Ives has
had the ill luck to be knocked down, he has
contrived to fall on his legs."</p>

<p>"Gad, Malham, it's uncommonly lucky we
happened to be passing at the time. My nephew
and I have been to Binfield&mdash;intending merely to
make a call&mdash;but Tom Irby persuaded us to stay
dinner, and we were getting back as fast as
Spanker could take us&mdash;and you know how well
he goes&mdash;when we came upon this poor young
fellow lying in the middle of the road. Another
minute, and it would have been all over with
him&mdash;but we won't think of that. Here he is."</p>

<p>"I feel I am indebted to you, sir, and to your

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

nephew for the preservation of my life," said
Hilary, earnestly. "I am truly sensible of your
kindness. But I really am not in a condition
to avail myself of your hospitality. Having lost
my knapsack, I have not even a change of linen."</p>

<p>"Poh! Oswald will supply all your wants in
that respect."</p>

<p>"That I will, with the greatest pleasure," said
the young man. "You shall have the pick of
my wardrobe, Mr. St. Ives, and as we're about
the same size, my things will fit you."</p>

<p>"All's settled," cried his uncle. "Help our
young friend into the dog-cart."</p>

<p>Hilary made some further remonstrances, but
the worthy old gentleman overruled them, and
glancing at his nephew, the latter assisted Hilary
to arise, and the two young men went out of the
surgery together.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe tarried to have a parting word
with the surgeon.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

<p>"Anything to say to me, Malham?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not much, sir," replied the surgeon. "You
may make up your mind to have this young man
at Hazlemere for three or four days, or a week.
He's certain to have fever, and it won't be long in
coming on. No need for alarm, though. No
mischief has been done. He has been knocked
about the head pretty severely, but his skull is
luckily as thick as an Irishman's, and not easily
cracked. I needn't prescribe for him. You have
only to explain the case to Mrs. Sutton. She has
a medicine chest, and will know what to give
him."</p>

<p>"Ay, Mrs. Sutton beats you all hollow, Malham,"
cried Mr. Radcliffe, with a laugh. "She
likes to act as nurse."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sutton is a very clever woman, and a
very good woman, and if I got hurt, I should like
her to nurse me&mdash;that's all I can say."</p>

<p>"She's invaluable to us, Malham," cried the old

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

gentleman, tears of gratitude springing to his eyes.
"She has lived with us for nineteen years&mdash;ever
since my darling May was born&mdash;and we have
never had a fault to find with her. As you know,
my dear wife has always been an invalid. A
nurse is a necessity to her, and she has found the
best of nurses in Mrs. Sutton. Without her unremitting
care and attention&mdash;and skill, Malham,
skill&mdash;Mrs. Radcliffe wouldn't be alive now."</p>

<p>It seemed a pleasure to the old gentleman to
sing his housekeeper's praises. A pleasure, also,
to the surgeon to listen to them.</p>

<p>"You may with truth assert, sir," he rejoined,
"that, but for Mrs. Sutton's care, your wife would
not be alive now."</p>

<p>Emotion kept Mr. Radcliffe silent. He brushed
his eyes, and said, "You'll come over to see this
young fellow in the morning, Malham?"</p>

<p>"I'll come to see how he gets on, since you

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

desire it, sir; but I'm sure Mrs. Sutton will treat
him properly."</p>

<p>"At all events, she'll be very glad to consult
with you. You're a great favourite of hers, Malham."</p>

<p>The surgeon smiled and bowed.</p>

<p>"I wonder who the deuce this young St. Ives
can be? and where he comes from? I don't
know whether you remarked it, but he seemed
rather shy in giving any information about himself
to my nephew. I'm certain he's a gentleman,
or I wouldn't take him home with me."</p>

<p>"A gentleman, no doubt, sir. Don't excite
him by any questions to-night. He's not exactly
himself. We shall learn all about him, by and by.
Get him to bed as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Nothing more passed. Mr. Radcliffe bade the
surgeon good night, and shook hands with him.
On going forth, he found that his nephew and

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

Hilary were already seated in the dog-cart. Mr.
Malham's groom was standing at Spanker's head.
Taking the reins from the man, Mr. Radcliffe
got into the vehicle more actively than might
have been expected from so stout a personage,
and drove off.</p>

<p>Hazlemere was about a mile and a half distant
from Wootton, and while they are on the way
thither, we shall take the opportunity of offering a
brief description of the place, and saying a few
words about its occupants.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch02">

<p>II.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. SUTTON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazlemere House</span> was a large, commodious,
red-brick mansion, built, towards the close of the
last century, by the present owner's grandsire&mdash;a
merchant of the City of London. The site
had been well chosen, in the midst of a lovely
country. Though the house was comparatively
modern, not being more than seventy years old,
there was fine timber around it; the gardens were
extensive, and the grounds well laid out. At
no great distance, there was a miniature lake,

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

from which the place derived its name. "To
sum up," as the worthy old cit, who reared it, used
to say, it was a delightful country house.</p>

<p>Like his sire and grandsire, our friend, Mr.
Theobald Radcliffe, had been in business in the
City, but had retired several years ago, and now
lived entirely at Hazlemere. His wife, as we
have seen, was a great invalid, and never left
home. She would not stir without Mrs. Sutton,
and Mrs. Sutton did not like to leave Hazlemere.
Mr. Radcliffe had no son; but he had something
far better&mdash;a most charming daughter.</p>

<p>Her father was very proud of her, and he might
well be so. May Radcliffe had a thousand attractive
qualities which it would take pages to enumerate.
She must have had some faults, we suppose,
but her father could never discern them. He
thought her perfection. She was exceedingly
amiable, and her nature was so joyous that she

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

seemed to diffuse happiness wherever she went.
Her light laughter was the pleasantest music in
her father's ears, though he liked also to listen to
her sweet voice as she touched the piano. May
was a favourite with everybody in the house,
except Mrs. Sutton. The exception may appear
incomprehensible, seeing that Mrs. Sutton had
nursed her during infancy, and watched over her
ever since, and might naturally be supposed to
have almost a mother's love for her. But so it
was. Mrs. Sutton had once doted upon her;
but her feelings of late had undergone a change.
She did not, however, allow this change to appear,
but treated May with every semblance of affection,
and seemed anxious as ever to gratify her
slightest wish.</p>

<p>But May was not to be deceived. She detected
the change. What had she done to forfeit her
dear old nurse's love? She could not tell. But

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

the idea made her unhappy, and being wholly
incapable of concealment, she confessed her uneasiness
to the author of it, promising, if she had
offended in any way, to make instant reparation,
"Tell me what it is, dear Mrs. Sutton," she cried,
"You know how dearly I love you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton looked surprised and hurt, and
reproached her gently, telling her she was a silly
child to entertain any such nonsensical notion.
She then kissed her affectionately, and assured
her, with a look that carried conviction with
it, that she loved her better than any one in
the world, except her dear mistress. Secretly,
perhaps, Mrs. Sutton did not love either of them
overmuch. But she played her part so well, that
she effectually dissipated all May's misgivings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was the youngest daughter of
Mr. Page Thornton, a flourishing solicitor of
Chester. Both the Miss Thorntons were considered
belles in their day, and had been much


<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

admired by the youth of Chester, as well as by
the officers quartered in the ancient city of Hugh
Lupus. Both married well, though neither was
united to the man she herself would have chosen.
Isabella, the eldest, became the second wife of
Dr. Woodcot, an eminent physician in Manchester.
But of her anon. Esther Thornton,
who had been a great flirt, and had had we
know not how many entanglements, managed to
captivate Mr. Radcliffe, whom she met at a ball
at Liverpool. Mr. Radcliffe was double Esther's
age; but that did not matter; he was a wealthy
merchant, and when he followed her to Chester,
and proposed, Mr. Thornton, who was tired out
by so many flirtations that came to nothing,
insisted upon her accepting him. She did so, and
gave up Captain Delacombe, who became distracted.
Like a sensible fellow as he was, Mr.
Radcliffe did not trouble himself with his wife's

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

former flirtations, but esteemed himself eminently
fortunate in possessing such a charming creature.</p>

<p>Esther had been always extremely delicate, and
after the birth of May she became a confirmed
invalid. A young widow, unembarrassed by a
family, was recommended to her as a nurse.
This was Mrs. Sutton, who had never since
quitted the family, and had really become a very
important member of it. It is questionable
whether she had most influence with Mrs. Radcliffe
or her husband. Both were governed by
her without being aware of it. Mrs. Sutton at
the time of her entrance into the family, and
assumption of the duties of nurse and housekeeper,
for she filled both offices, was about five-and-twenty&mdash;perhaps
not quite so much&mdash;but she
called herself five-and-twenty. She never gave
any particulars of her previous history, nor were
they asked for, out of consideration for her feelings,

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

it being understood that her marriage had
been unhappy. Her countenance long wore a
shade of melancholy, but this wore off in time.
She was perfectly well educated, and had the
manners of a gentlewoman; but though evidently
superior to her situation, she fulfilled all
its duties, and became, as her mistress declared,
a model nurse and a model housekeeper. Plain
of feature, she was not without personal attraction,
for her figure was good, her hair dark and
fine, her complexion very fair, and her teeth
beautifully white and even. Her hands and feet
were small and well formed. Such charms as
she possessed she contrived to preserve in a very
wonderful manner, and indeed she seemed rather
to improve than deteriorate by age. She dressed
very plainly and consistently, but was so neat
that what she wore always became her. Mrs.
Radcliffe used often to say that she could never

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

get a dress to fit her in the same way that Mrs.
Sutton's dresses did. Her manner was extremely
quiet and prepossessing. At first Mrs. Sutton
had had the care of May, but Mrs. Radcliffe's
delicate state of health demanded her exclusive
care, and another nurse was engaged. Gradually
she rose to an important position in the house,
but as she never made her power unpleasantly
manifest, she was liked by the whole household,
of whom she was in effect mistress, for Mrs.
Radcliffe was too feeble to attempt the management,
and Mr. Radcliffe, who was quite aware
of his wife's incompetency, was well pleased that
she should be thus efficiently represented. Mrs.
Radcliffe entrusted her keys and her purse to
her housekeeper, kept nothing from her in fact,
and was constantly making her handsome presents.
Mrs. Sutton was her confidante and
counseller, and as she possessed a far stronger

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

mind than her mistress, her ascendancy became
complete. But as May grew up Mrs. Sutton
began to fear she might be supplanted. Hence
her jealousy of the amiable and unoffending girl,
to whom she had previously been so fondly attached.
She could brook no interference. Never
would she relinquish the keys&mdash;never submit to
have her authority restricted or controlled. The
sole plan of removing her young and dangerous
rival was to get her married, and she had no
doubt that this could be speedily accomplished.
Already May had plenty of suitors, but she
seemed to care for none of them. Mrs. Sutton,
however, relied upon Cousin Oswald.</p>

<p>And now a few words as to this young gentleman.
Oswald Woodcot was the only son of Mrs.
Radcliffe's sister Isabella, who had now been some
ten years a widow. Mrs. Woodcot was not very
well off, her late husband having left the bulk of

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

his property to his children by his first wife. Her
son, therefore, was indebted for the excellent education
he had received to his grandfather, Mr.
Thornton, of Chester, who was still alive, and
still in business, though an old man. Oswald was
destined for the bar, and had every prospect of
success, owing to his grandfather's interest and
connections; but he had a distaste to the legal profession,
though he didn't care to avow it to Mr.
Thornton. The old solicitor, who was very rich,
and talked of making him his heir, might change
his mind, if he displeased him. Mrs. Woodcot
would have liked to see her son in the army, but
of course this was out of the question, unless Mr.
Thornton's consent could be obtained, and it being
quite certain he would strongly oppose the plan,
it was never mentioned to him, and the idea was
abandoned. It was pretty clear, however, that
Oswald would never make a figure at the bar, and

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

this his shrewd old grandfather had already begun
to suspect. Mrs. Woodcot had another plan in
regard to her son, which she persuaded herself
could be easily carried out, which would materially
better his prospects, and at the same time ensure
his happiness. This was to bring about a match
between him and her lovely niece, May Radcliffe.
She really saw no difficulty in the matter. The
young people seemed made for each other. Oswald
was a very handsome young fellow&mdash;at least, in his
mother's opinion&mdash;just three years older than his
charming cousin, and his disposition was so kind
and good that he could not fail to make her happy.
The fortune, it is true, was all on May's side, for
she could give her son little or nothing; but had
he not great expectations from his grandfather,
who had almost announced his intention of making
him his heir, and who might be induced to do
something at once, if the marriage were arranged?

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

Thus the fond mother argued, and her son was
quite of the same opinion, for he was over head
and ears in love with his lovely cousin.</p>

<p>Aware of the danger of making a false step
in a matter so important&mdash;aware also of Mrs.
Sutton's influence over her sister, and indeed over
Mr. Radcliffe, Mrs. Woodcot endeavoured to
secure the housekeeper's assistance, and urged
Oswald to conciliate her by every means in his
power. Mrs. Sutton&mdash;for reasons we have already
explained&mdash;met him half-way, and soon showed
that she was ready to become his ally. Oswald
therefore seemed in a fair way of success. But
he had not, as yet, received sufficient encouragement
from May to warrant a formal declaration.
She liked him very much, and was always very
happy and cheerful in his society, but she seemed
only to regard him as a cousin. Oswald was
therefore perplexed, but Mrs. Sutton encouraged

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

him, though at the same time she recommended
him not to be precipitate. Meantime, the housekeeper
had cautiously sounded her mistress, and
had ascertained that there was no disinclination
on her part to the match. Mrs. Radcliffe thought
the young people were well suited to each other,
and she would not be sorry to have May happily
married, though she felt sure Mr. Radcliffe would
not like to part with her. Nor was she wrong.
When the plan was hinted to him by his wife, he
laughed at it, and hoped Oswald had got no such
foolish notion into his head. If he thought so,
he should be obliged to forbid him the house, and
he should be very sorry to do that, on all accounts.
He had got a husband for May in his eye; but
he did not intend her to marry just at present.
Mr. Radcliffe was rather self-willed, and any immediate
opposition would only have made him
more obstinate. Mrs. Sutton understood him very

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

well, and knew she could get over the difficulty.
But May's heart must first be won. That grand
point had yet to be achieved.</p>

<p>Oswald had plenty of opportunity of winning
his fair cousin's affections. He was always
welcome at Hazlemere, and indeed just as much
at home with his uncle, who sincerely liked him,
though he objected to him as a son-in-law, as he
was with his mother. He therefore came when
it suited him, and stayed as long as he pleased.
As we have shown, he did not trouble himself
much about his profession. He had not even
chambers in town. His mother resided in a
prettily-situated cottage at Bowdon, in Cheshire,
and he made her house his head-quarters. He was
fond of hunting and shooting, and as he knew a
good many of the Cheshire squires, and visited
them, he could always get a mount, though he
could not afford to keep a horse, and as much

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

shooting as he wanted. But with the attraction
which it now offered him, we may suppose that he
passed most of his time at Hazlemere. Besides
wooing his fair cousin, he paid great court to his
aunt, made himself as agreeable as he could to
his uncle, and did not, we may be sure, neglect
Mrs. Sutton. He wrote, now and then, to report
progress to his mother&mdash;but he could not send her
the intelligence she longed for. All, however,
was going on prosperously, and Mrs. Sutton was
secretly at work for him.</p>

<p>Such was the position of things at Hazlemere, at
the time we are about to enter the house, and
make acquaintance with its inmates.</p>

<p>We will now return to the party in the dog-cart,
whom we left on the way to Hazlemere.
Long before they arrived there, Hilary became
exceedingly faint, and his head fell upon Oswald's
shoulder. Rather alarmed, Mr. Radcliffe accelerated

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

his pace, and soon reached his destination.
The lodge gates were open, but instead of
pursuing the drive that led to the principal entrance
of the mansion, Mr. Radcliffe took a side
road to the stables, and committing the injured
man to the care of his nephew, and giving some
hasty directions to the coachman, who had rushed
forth on his arrival, he hurried into the house
to prepare Mrs. Sutton for her unexpected
patient.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Hilary was led into the
house, supported between Oswald and the coachman.
He was now almost unconscious, but as
he was borne across the spacious hall, the vision
of a lovely girl, who seemed to take great interest
in him, flitted before his swimming gaze. He
saw nothing more. He was taken up-stairs, and
transported to a chamber which had been hastily
prepared for his reception by Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

<p>Hilary passed a very disturbed night. He slept
for a few hours, but when he awoke fever had
come on. He was quite light-headed, and rambled
strangely in his talk. Mrs. Sutton, who had
watched anxiously by his couch, and was alone
with him at the time, listened with breathless
interest to his ravings. A few words which he
had let fall fixed her attention, and rising softly
from her seat, she drew nearer to him, and gazed
eagerly and inquiringly into his face.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Radcliffe seen her at this moment
he would not have known her, so changed was
her aspect. Her usual calm expression was gone,
and had given place to a look of intense emotion
such as she never exhibited.</p>

<p>What thoughts passed through her breast as
she pursued this agonising scrutiny we shall not
inquire. Her emotion became so violent that she
feared it would master her. But she neither

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

cried out, nor fell. Her senses seemed wrapped
in the object before her. While she yet gazed
at him, incapable of stirring, though so profoundly
agitated, the sufferer ceased to rave, and
his breathing soon proclaimed that he once more
slumbered.</p>

<p>Her life appeared to hang upon the step she
next took. Bending forward, and carefully raising
the coverlet&mdash;so carefully that she did not disturb
the sleeper&mdash;she laid bare the lower part
of his neck, and then discovered the mark she
sought.</p>

<p>All doubts were now removed. Her strength
deserted her, and she sank back in the chair
completely overcome by emotion.</p>

<p>When she recovered, she found that the sufferer
was awake and gazing at her with vacant
wonder. Her sobs, which she could not check,
had roused him. She immediately got up, and

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

with as much firmness as she could command,
offered him a cooling draught. He drank it
eagerly, and as he gazed earnestly in her face
she had great difficulty in refraining from throwing
herself upon his neck. But she took his
hand, and held it till he again slumbered; and
she then kissed his burning brow.</p>

<p>According to his promise, Mr. Malham came
in the morning to see the injured man. By this
time the fever had increased, and Hilary's pulse
was very high, but the surgeon declared there
was no occasion for alarm, and proceeded to dress
the sufferer's wounds, and this seemed to afford
him sensible relief. Mr. Malham was rather surprised
by Mrs. Sutton's anxiety about her patient.
He assured her there was no danger, and she
could not have treated him better. He smiled
as he said this, as if admitting her superior skill.
Mr. Malham was a widower, and was looking

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

out for another wife. Despite his assurance, she
still appeared grave and anxious. "My dear
madam," he said, giving her hand a gentle professional
squeeze, "there is really no cause for
uneasiness. You are sure to bring him round."</p>

<p>"I should like to have a word with you before
you go, Mr. Malham," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"As many as you please, dear madam," he
replied, following her into a dressing-room which
opened out of the bed-chamber.</p>

<p>She then obtained from him full particulars as
to the attack that had been made by the gipsies
upon Mr. St. Ives, and learnt, further, that the
police had been hitherto unsuccessful in capturing
the robbers.</p>

<p>"Wormald was very confident last night," said
the surgeon, "but I saw him only an hour ago,
and he was still quite at fault. The rascals have
got off. Don't say anything to our patient, as it

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

may excite him and retard his cure, but I fear
he will lose his knapsack, and according to his
own account it contained some documents of great
importance to him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Sutton. "Then it
is to be hoped he may recover it. Pray who is
the young gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Your curiosity about him is very natural,
dear madam, and I regret I cannot gratify it.
We are all in the dark about him. He gave no
account of himself last night, and Mr. Radcliffe
was too considerate to ask any questions."</p>

<p>"But I thought he might have said something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't even state where he came from.
He merely mentioned his name&mdash;Hilary St. Ives."</p>

<p>"I never heard the name before," remarked
Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>"Nor I," observed the surgeon. "There is

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

no family of that name hereabouts. If I had
any notion who he is, I would write to his
friends."</p>

<p>"We must wait till he is able to give the
necessary explanation," said Mrs. Sutton. "And
I think you will agree with me, that it is best
he should not be disturbed to-day&mdash;by any one."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, dear madam. Just
what I, myself, should have recommended. He
must be kept quiet&mdash;perfectly quiet. I'll enjoin
Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Oswald not to come near
him, without your sanction."</p>

<p>And he again smiled tenderly, implying that
he would do anything to please her.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Mr. Malham," she
rejoined. "I won't detain you any longer. Of
course I shall see you to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Of course, since you desire it. Ah! dear
madam," he sighed, "I feel sometimes very lonely
in my widowed home."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

<p>Mrs. Sutton took no notice of the remark, but
ushered him to the door, and he was obliged
reluctantly to depart.</p>

<p>Mr. Malham's injunctions were strictly obeyed.
Neither Mr. Radcliffe nor his nephew entered
the room occupied by the wounded man. Mrs.
Sutton remained with him all day, and attended
him with maternal solicitude. His ravings were
unheard by any one but herself.</p>

<p>Towards evening the fever began to abate.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. RADCLIFFE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Radcliffe</span> was in her boudoir, where
she always passed the morning, and very often
the entire day. The room in which the invalid
lady spent so much time was charmingly fitted
up, the whole of the furniture being Parisian.
While elegance was studied, comfort was not
neglected. The boudoir was luxurious as well as
tasteful. So soft were the sofas and easy chairs,
that they seemed stuffed with eider-down. Delicious
little groups copied from Watteau, in

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

S&egrave;vres china, and the prettiest of pendules, likewise
of china, graced the chimney-piece, which
was covered with blue velvet, and had curtain
screens of the same stuff to moderate the heat of
the fire. The skin of a superb tiger, which had
been shot in India by Captain Delacombe, lay
upon the hearth. Beautiful bronzes adorned the
pier-tables, and rare objects of art were displayed
in open cabinets. Choice water-colour pictures
added to the attractions in the room, and miniatures
were hung on either side of the mantel-piece.
Rose-coloured curtains subdued the light,
and cast a warm glow on the pale cheeks of
the invalid. The windows looked out upon the
garden, but were rarely opened, for Mrs. Radcliffe
could not endure a breath of air. As far as
possible an equable temperature was maintained,
but it was the temperature of a hothouse, or of
an Indian bungalow. Mrs. Radcliffe being a hothouse

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

plant, enjoyed this high temperature. Other
people, however, found it inconvenient, and Mr.
Radcliffe never remained in his wife's boudoir
more than ten minutes, without complaining of
headache.</p>

<p>The invalid and indolent lady of Hazlemere
passed her life in a pleasant dream, from which
she did not care to be aroused. She did not
desire rude health, which would have necessitated
exertion, and she disliked all exertion;
but she would fain have preserved her youth
and beauty. She took no exercise on foot. Occasionally
she drove out in the close carriage to
make a call; and when she went forth into the
garden, she was wheeled about in a Bath chair.
Yet she was really not quite so feeble as she
fancied herself. Owing to the great care taken
of her by Mrs. Sutton, her health was partially
restored. The pulmonary symptoms, that had

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

once threatened her, had disappeared. But she
liked to be considered delicate. It served as an
excuse for her indolence. A great reader of
novels&mdash;French as well as English&mdash;her mind
was tinctured by the class of literature to which
she was addicted, and wanted bracing as much
as her body. As we have shown, she troubled
herself as little as possible about household concerns,
and left the management of them entirely
to Mrs. Sutton. The nature of a person so constituted
could not be otherwise than intensely
selfish, yet she was amiable and good-natured
when not put out of the way. She was not a
tiresome, ever-complaining invalid.</p>

<p>At the time of her introduction to the reader,
Mrs. Radcliffe was only just turned forty, and
still decidedly handsome, though her charms were
somewhat faded. Her blonde tresses had lost
their lustre, and acquired a pale ashy hue, but

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

her complexion was still delicate, though perhaps
it derived a little of its bloom from art. Her
skin was free from wrinkles, her teeth good, and
her features retained their beautiful outline. Her
figure was thin, but graceful, and her hands and
feet might have served as models to a sculptor.
Above all, her eyes had lost little of their beauty
and tenderness of expression. How much she
was changed from the captivating and coquettish
Esther Thornton of former days, could be seen
by reference to a charming miniature by Sir
William Newton, placed near the chimney-piece.
She was not so lovely as that bright-eyed fair-haired
girl, but the expression of her features
was more agreeable. Faded as she was, Mrs.
Radcliffe was still very attractive, and might even
now have inspired a passion in the breast of
some romantic youth. In her husband's eyes she
was quite as beautiful as when he wedded her.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe had never loved her husband,
but she was not unhappy in her married life.
Mr. Radcliffe was much older than herself, as
we are aware, but he was so fond of her, so
indulgent, so anxious to gratify her every whim,
that it was impossible not to like him. Then,
again, being so great an invalid, she could not
mix with society, and had no opportunity of flirting
as a married woman, even if she had been
inclined to do so. Perhaps her feeble state of
health was rather a fortunate circumstance for
Mr. Radcliffe. But if we must penetrate into
the secret recesses of her breast, we shall discover
that she still nourished a tender feeling for
Captain Seymour Delacombe, who had been undoubted
master of her heart. She had never,
however, seen him since her marriage.</p>

<p>Immediately after that event, he had gone out
to India, and had been there ever since; but she

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

had corresponded with him&mdash;of course, with her
husband's sanction. Seymour had sought death,
it appeared, in many a siege and sharp conflict,
but had not found it. On the contrary, he had
gained honour and promotion, and was now
Colonel Delacombe, C.B.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe had watched his brilliant career
with great interest, but what chiefly gratified her
was that he never married. When they parted,
twenty years ago, he had vowed, since he could
not be blessed with her, never to take another
to his breast. And he had kept his vow.</p>

<p>On that afflicting occasion he had given her
his miniature, which was now to be seen in the
boudoir, hung near the chimney-piece, on the
opposite side to her own. To judge from this
portrait, Seymour Delacombe must have been
exceedingly handsome, with fine dark eyes, a
dark complexion, and regular features, marked
by a very haughty expression. He was about

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

five-and-twenty at the time. It may seem strange
that Mr. Radcliffe should allow the portrait of
one whom he knew had been desperately in love
with his wife to hang up in her boudoir. He
did not altogether like to see the miniature, but
he wisely argued that it might as well be there,
as locked up in a drawer.</p>

<p>But if he disregarded this miniature, Mrs.
Sutton had an unaccountable dislike to it. She
avoided looking at it, and never would admit that
she thought it the portrait of a handsome man.</p>

<p>"Ah! you should have seen Seymour when
this was taken!" Mrs. Radcliffe often exclaimed.
"You could not fail to have been struck by him.
He was thought the handsomest man of his
day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton replied that he might be handsome,
but she didn't like the expression of his
countenance.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, however, when Mrs. Radcliffe

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

entered the boudoir unexpectedly, she
caught the housekeeper gazing steadfastly at the
miniature.</p>

<p>Despite her habitual self-command, Mrs. Sutton
started when thus detected, her embarrassment
being increased by her mistress's raillery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton had frequently&mdash;far too frequently
for her peace&mdash;to listen to Mrs. Radcliffe's description
of her love-passages with Seymour Delacombe.
The housekeeper manifested little interest
in these tender and touching details. Apparently,
she did not believe in the sincerity of
the gallant captain's passion, or in his vows of
eternal constancy, for she sometimes smiled rather
contemptuously when they were repeated.</p>

<p>"You look incredulous, Sutton," said her mistress.
"But you see he has never married."</p>

<p>"There may have been reasons for his not
marrying," remarked the housekeeper, dryly.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

<p>"What reasons?" cried the lady. "None&mdash;save
his vow to me."</p>

<p>The same slightly contemptuous smile, that had
just before curled Mrs. Sutton's lip, again appeared
for an instant.</p>

<p>"You would do well, I think, to forget him,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I cannot forget him," rejoined Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton gave her a look, which it was
lucky the other did not understand. It was certainly
not a look of sympathy. It was rather a
look of ill-concealed hate. Had not Mrs. Radcliffe
been occupied by her own thoughts, she
must have remarked it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, as we have said, was in her
charming boudoir, seated in a fauteuil, with her
tiny feet supported by a velvet tabouret. With
the help of a double eye-glass, of the most graceful
workmanship, she was reading the <i>Court

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

Journal</i>. She was dressed in a very becoming
deshabille, and seen in that subdued light, with
her back to the window, looked almost young.
However, there was no one to behold her, except
Annette, her lady's-maid, who was taking away
the breakfast-things. The invalid lady's breakfast
consisted of a cup of chocolate and a little
dry toast; and she desired Annette, as the latter
left the room, to request Mrs. Sutton to come
to her immediately. For a wonder, she had not
seen the housekeeper during the whole of the
previous day, but she knew how she had been
occupied, and therefore excused her. Annette,
of course, delivered the message; but Mrs. Sutton
was busy at the moment, and nearly an hour
elapsed before she complied with it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Radcliffe had become impatient,
and was just about to ring the bell, and
inquire what was the matter, when the housekeeper

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

entered the room, looking graver than
usual.</p>

<p>"I ought to scold you, dear Sutton, for neglecting
me so shamefully," said Mrs. Radcliffe; "but
you look so ill that I cannot find in my heart to
do so. I hear you have been sitting up for two
nights with this poor young man. You really
ought to consider yourself, and should have let
one of the men servants sit up with him. How
is he going on?" she added, with affected interest.</p>

<p>"He is so much better this morning, that he
is able to get up. The fever is quite gone, and
Mr. Malham, who has just been to see him, says
he will be able to leave his room to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's very satisfactory. I was afraid it might
be a tedious business. What a singular occurrence!
I never was more surprised than when I
learnt that Mr. Radcliffe had brought a wounded

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

young man home with him. He was influenced
by the kindest motives, no doubt; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Radcliffe acted for the best," interrupted
Mrs. Sutton. "I am very glad Mr. St. Ives was
brought here. And I am sure you will be of the
same opinion."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I shall, especially if you are
pleased, Sutton. You must have had a great deal
of trouble with him. You look quite worn out."</p>

<p>"I am not in the least fatigued, and I should
not have left him so long as the fever lasted."</p>

<p>"You are the best of nurses. I have reason to
say so. You seem to take a special interest in
Mr. St. Ives. I don't wonder at it. Oswald tells
me he is a very fine young man."</p>

<p>"Mr. Oswald's description of him is perfectly
correct. But it is not on account of his good looks
that I am interested in him."</p>

<p>"Then you own the interest, and yet deny its
cause," remarked Mrs. Radcliffe, smiling. "Had

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

he been ill-looking you would have felt very
differently towards him. What is he like?"</p>

<p>"I will show you who he is like," replied Mrs.
Sutton, pointing to the miniature of Captain
Delacombe.</p>

<p>"Like Seymour!" exclaimed Mrs. Radcliffe, so
surprised that her listlessness of manner at once
disappeared. "Like Seymour! impossible! You
are trifling with me, Sutton."</p>

<p>"He is so like, that the miniature might be
taken for him. Now you will understand why
I take a particular interest in him."</p>

<p>"What is it you would insinuate, Sutton?
Don't agitate me, I entreat of you. You know
how unequal I am to the slightest excitement, and
such a thing as this might kill me. Give me a
few drops."</p>

<p>The housekeeper obeyed the order, remarking
as she did so,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

<p>"I would not have mentioned the matter, but
I feel certain the likeness will be noticed, and I
therefore judged it best to prepare you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think Oswald must have noticed it, for
he said yesterday that Mr. St. Ives resembled
some one he had seen. He never saw Seymour,
of course; but he has seen his portrait. What
a commotion you have raised in my breast,
Sutton! What a tumult of feelings you have
roused!"</p>

<p>"I want you to be calm, for I have something
to say to you."</p>

<p>"Something to say!" exclaimed Mrs. Radcliffe,
alarmed by the housekeeper's manner. "What is
it? Have you made a discovery in regard to
this young man's parentage? Have you any
reason to suspect&mdash;ha! Tell me! Don't keep
me in this distracting state of suspense! Tell me
all, there's a dear, good creature."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

<p>"I won't speak, unless you keep quiet. I don't
think the likeness <i>can</i> be accidental."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, that he is Seymour's son?"
cried Mrs. Radcliffe. "But no&mdash;no&mdash;no! the
notion is too absurd to be indulged for a moment."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this signet-ring may afford some
evidence," said Mrs. Sutton, "I took it from
the dressing-table in his room, and brought it to
show you. Do you know Captain Delacombe's
arms?"</p>

<p>"Yes; three tigers' heads, with a hand grasping
a falchion for crest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton gave her the ring, and begged her
to examine it.</p>

<p>"Yes, here they are! here are the tigers' heads,
with the crest! This is proof indeed. He <i>must</i>
be Seymour's son. What age is the young
man?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

<p>"Between one and two-and-twenty, as near as
I can guess."</p>

<p>"Then he must have been born before Seymour
made love to me. He to whom I gave my heart
was false and perjured!&mdash;oh!" And she sank
back, exclaiming, "More drops, Sutton! more
drops, or I shall expire!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she started up.</p>

<p>"A terrible thought suggests itself to me!"
she exclaimed. "Was Seymour married at the
time? Oh, if he was, he was forsworn indeed!
Tell me what you think, Sutton."</p>

<p>"I have no thought upon the subject," rejoined
the other, coldly.</p>

<p>"Do not spare my feelings. I can bear the
truth. Do you think he <i>was</i> married?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, since I must give an opinion upon
a point of which I can know nothing, I think he
was married."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated the lady, with an hysterical
cry. And she again sank back.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Radcliffe's nervous attack,
which was rather severe while it lasted, was over,
she fixed her humid eyes on the housekeeper, who
was standing beside her with a smelling-bottle in
her hand, and said,</p>

<p>"I must see this young man, Sutton&mdash;this
Hilary St. Ives, as he calls himself&mdash;I must satisfy
myself that he is the person we suppose. You
may be mistaken, for you have never seen his&mdash;I
mean, the original of the miniature. But it is
impossible <i>I</i> can be deceived. Seymour's image is
graven on my heart."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton could scarcely hide her disgust.</p>

<p>"I do not think I am mistaken," she replied.
"Still, as I am wholly unacquainted with Captain
Delacombe, and can judge only of the likeness by
the portrait, I may be wrong. On all accounts,

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

I think it most desirable that you should see the
young man; but you must consider well whether
you are equal to the interview. It will not do to
exhibit emotion before him, such as you have just
displayed."</p>

<p>"I will not betray myself, depend upon it,
Sutton. I can see him and converse with him,
unmoved&mdash;even though he should prove&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, we will go to his room. But first
allow me to put away that accusing portrait. Its
disappearance may cause some remark, but better
that, than it should be examined just now by the
servants, or any one else."</p>

<p>So saying, without waiting for permission, she
took down the miniature and locked it up in the
bureau, of which she possessed the key.</p>

<p>"You are sure you are quite equal to the
effort?" she then added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe replied that she was quite sure,

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

and immediately arose with a very unwonted display
of ardour. Her sensibilities were really
aroused, and she was almost in a youthful flutter
of anxiety.</p>

<p>Before leaving the boudoir with the housekeeper,
she surveyed herself in the mirror, and
slightly arranged her toilette and her hair.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch04">

<p>IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE INTERVIEW.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very unusual thing indeed for the
invalid lady to leave her room at this hour, and
Annette, who chanced to be on the landing,
wondered to see her issue forth.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sutton wishes me to see Mr. St. Ives,"
remarked Mrs. Radcliffe, thinking it best to give
an explanation.</p>

<p>"The poor young gentleman is in the dressing-room,
me'm," replied Annette. "Boston has just
left him.'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

<p>"I will go on first, if you please," said Mrs.
Sutton, stepping forward quickly towards the
further end of the corridor, where the chamber
they sought was situated.</p>

<p>Hilary had left his bed an hour ago. Boston,
the valet, had brought him a change of linen, with
several articles of apparel, furnished by good-natured
Oswald Woodcot, and had assisted to
dress him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton's first business was to lay the
signet-ring on the dressing-table. Hilary had not
missed it.</p>

<p>The young man was reclining on a couch,
wrapped in a dressing-gown. As may naturally
be expected, he looked very pale, but this did not
impair his good looks, but rather lent interest to
his countenance.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her boasted firmness, Mrs.
Radcliffe well-nigh betrayed herself by a scream,

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

and the housekeeper, perceiving her agitation,
stepped between her and the young man to give
her time to recover. Hilary had raised himself
on her entrance, and when informed that the lady
of the house had come to inquire after him, he
expressed his sense of her kindness in suitable
terms.</p>

<p>Not only was the face Seymour's, but the voice
and manner were Seymour's. Mrs. Radcliffe
thought she beheld her old lover again. No
doubt it was a trying moment, and it is really
wonderful that she maintained her self-possession
at all.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of Mrs. Sutton? Could
the mingled feelings with which she looked on be
discerned in her countenance? Not in the least.
To all outward appearance she was perfectly calm.
Perhaps she was secretly well pleased by the effect
produced upon her mistress by Hilary.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

<p>On his part, the young man was most favourably
impressed by the lady, though quite unable
to account for the interest she evidently took in
him. He thought her very handsome, and singularly
kind and agreeable in manner. She put
several questions to him calculated to elicit information
as to his history and position in life, but he
was very guarded in his answers, and she could
only ascertain that he had been brought up at
Exeter, and had recently been in France, and that
his nearest living relative&mdash;he did not say his
father&mdash;was in India.</p>

<p>On all points he maintained great reserve.</p>

<p>He did not even explain the business that had
brought him into this part of the country, though
he lamented the loss of his papers.</p>

<p>At last, Mrs. Radcliffe mustered courage to put
a question to him which she had all along been
dying to ask.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

<p>He had said his nearest relative was in India.
Was his mother still alive?</p>

<p>The question saddened him. She was dead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was sorry to have asked the
question. But she ventured to inquire further
if his mother had been dead long?</p>

<p>She died many years ago&mdash;during his infancy&mdash;he
did not even remember her. He had never
known a mother's care.</p>

<p>These words, which caused a sharp pang in
Mrs. Sutton's breast, and made her put her hand
to her heart, gave immense relief to Mrs. Radcliffe.
Seymour was not the traitor she had
deemed him. She glanced at the housekeeper,
but was struck by her expression of pain, and
inquired anxiously what was the matter. It was
only a slight spasm.</p>

<p>"I am the cause of your illness, I fear," said
Hilary. "You have been watching by me for
two nights."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

<p>"No, it is not that. I am accustomed to
nursing. But I have not been very well of late.
It is gone." And she forced a rather ghastly
smile, adding, "I have only performed the office
which your mother would have discharged had she
been living."</p>

<p>"No mother could have watched over a son
more carefully than you have watched over me,"
said Hilary, with a deeply grateful look. "Nay,
when my fever was at its height, I thought you
were my mother come to life again, and standing
beside me."</p>

<p>"You were delirious for a time," Mrs. Sutton
hastened to remark, "and rambled strangely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I did. Without you I am
certain my cure would not have been so soon
accomplished. My strength has almost returned.
To-morrow," he added to Mrs. Radcliffe, "I hope
I shall be able to relieve you of any further

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

trouble respecting me. I shall never forget the
kindness I have experienced."</p>

<p>"You must not think of leaving us till you
are perfectly recovered. Besides, to-morrow is
my daughter May's birthday, and she has always
a little f&ecirc;te on the occasion, at which I hope
you may be well enough to assist."</p>

<p>"If Mr. St. Ives keeps perfectly quiet to-day,
I have no doubt he will be able to come down-stairs
to-morrow," observed Mrs. Sutton; "but
he overrates his strength."</p>

<p>"You hear that," observed Mrs. Radcliffe.
"You are not yet dismissed as cured."</p>

<p>"I am in too good quarters to feel any anxiety
to leave them," rejoined Hilary. "I need scarcely
say that it would delight me to be presented to
Miss Radcliffe, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will take no refusal. I shall be hurt if
you leave to-morrow, and so will Mr. Radcliffe.

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

You are his guest, you know. Unless you have
some particular reason for early departure, stay
with us a few days to recruit."</p>

<p>"The invitation is so kindly given, and is in
itself so tempting, that I must accept it. I
cannot offer the excuse of business. Since I
have lost my papers, I have really nothing to do."</p>

<p>"It is too soon to despair of recovering them.
They will turn up again, I have no doubt. And
now you will understand that you are to make
yourself quite at home. Mrs. Sutton will take
every care of you."</p>

<p>"That I will," said the housekeeper, smiling.</p>

<p>The arrangement was precisely what she desired.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were in a dream&mdash;and a very
pleasant dream it is!" cried Hilary. "All sorts
of strange fancies possess me," he added, gazing
alternately at Mrs. Radcliffe and the housekeeper.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

<p>"Your brain is still a little heated, I perceive,"
said the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes," observed Mrs. Sutton, signifying by a
glance that they had better withdraw.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, therefore, rose to depart, but
before she left the room, she said,</p>

<p>"I hope you will be able to join the breakfast-party
to-morrow, Mr. St. Ives. I will tell May
that she may expect to see you."</p>

<p>"I will come, if my kind nurse will allow me,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" inquired Mrs.
Sutton, as they returned to the boudoir.</p>

<p>"He is the very image of Seymour. I did
not venture to question him about his father;
but I am sure he is Seymour's son. I think I
did right to ask him to stay. The impulse was
irresistible."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done otherwise."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

<p>"I am glad you think so. Do you know,
Sutton, I almost felt towards him as if he were
my own son."</p>

<p>"The feeling was not unnatural. I am sure
he is sensible of the interest you take in him."</p>

<p>"He seemed so. I shall never be able to part
with him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton smiled. The right effect had been
produced.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has been neglected by his father
from some cause," she remarked, "and you may
be the means of setting him right. Who
knows?"</p>

<p>"His coming here looks like fatality," said Mrs.
Radcliffe, who had become unusually pensive.
"We shall learn more of his history in time,
and then I will consider how to act. Try to
find out if he wants anything, Sutton. I am
afraid he is poor."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

<p>"I am afraid so. But unless I am mistaken
in him, he is too proud to accept assistance."</p>

<p>"Still, we may help him. Something may be
done. I tell you I feel like a mother towards
him."</p>

<p>"That is clear; and he could not scruple to
receive a mother's aid. But it would be difficult
to make this intelligible to him. However, I will
do my best to carry out your wishes. I suppose
you will breakfast with the party to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I shall make an effort to do so&mdash;on his
account."</p>

<p>"You promised to have a little conversation
with Mr. Radcliffe about Mr. Oswald's suit."</p>

<p>"I did. But I think I shall defer it. There
is no hurry. Mr. Radcliffe does not like the
subject, as you are aware."</p>

<p>"I promised Mr. Oswald to remind you."</p>

<p>"I did not require to be reminded. But I

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

shall have too much to do to-morrow to attend
to the matter. To be plain, I want to ascertain
what May thinks of young St. Ives before I
stir further in Oswald's favour. Perhaps, she
may like him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton secretly exulted, but was careful
to hide her exultation.</p>

<p>"I do not think May cares much for her
cousin," she remarked.</p>

<p>"You appeared to think otherwise a few days
ago. Have you altered your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I am still as favourable as ever to Mr.
Oswald's suit. But I repeat I do not think May
cares much about him."</p>

<p>"I am glad to learn that her heart is disengaged.
That leaves me free to act. When
you go down-stairs send her to me."</p>

<p>"Pray be careful what you say to her, or
you may do mischief."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

<p>"Don't fear me. I shall talk to her chiefly
about young St. Ives. She is curious about him.
She saw him when he was brought into the
house, and was interested by his appearance."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Mrs. Sutton quitted her
mistress, and sent May to her, as desired.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch05">

<p>V.</p>

<p class="small">MAY AND HER MOTHER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A sweet</span> musical voice in the passage. The
door opened, and May entered the boudoir, bearing
a little basket of flowers. Flora herself could
not have looked more fresh and blooming.</p>

<p>She had just been summoned from the garden
by Mrs. Sutton, and had not taken off the dainty
little straw hat with which her blonde tresses
were crowned. What a winsome smile upon her
rosy lips. And what pearls those lips revealed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe regarded her with pride, not

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

unmingled with a slight feeling of envy. Her
own faded charms suffered sadly by contrast
with those of her lovely daughter.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, dearest mamma," cried May,
kissing her affectionately. "I hope you are quite
well this morning. You look so. I have brought
you a few flowers. Oh! it is such an enchanting
day. There has been a slight shower&mdash;the last
shower of April&mdash;and now the sun is shining so
brightly, and the birds are singing so blithely,
and everything is looking so deliciously spring-like.
Do let me persuade you to take a turn
in the garden. You will enjoy it so much, and
I am sure it will do you good. Shut up in this
close room you can have no idea of the beauty
and freshness of the morning. Oh! how I long
to open the window."</p>

<p>"On no account," said Mrs. Radcliffe, checking
her. "The air is far too chilly for me. At

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

your age I delighted in a walk on a fine spring
day like this, but now I am a poor invalid, and
must be content with my boudoir. Thank you
for these flowers, my love. They are very beautiful,
but the odour of these jonquils is too strong
to be agreeable. Put the basket aside, please.
Now, come and sit near me, and let us talk."</p>

<p>May obeyed, drew a chair towards her mother,
and fixed her large blue eyes inquiringly upon her.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is the first of May," said Mrs.
Radcliffe, taking her hand. "To-morrow you
will be nineteen, the brightest and happiest season
in a woman's existence&mdash;at least, it is generally so
considered, though in my own instance it proved
otherwise. At nineteen I was far from happy."
She sighed, and then added, "But I am sure
<i>you</i> are happy, darling."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am, dearest mamma&mdash;truly happy.
I have not a wish ungratified."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

<p>"Not one?" asked her mother. "Take care,
I am about to catechise you. But before I
begin I will make a little confession which may
encourage you to deal frankly with me. It may
make you smile, but I shall not smile at any
avowal it may elicit from you. Don't interrupt
me. At nineteen&mdash;I may say it now, since I am
an old woman&mdash;I was very much admired, and
I am afraid you will think I must have been
excessively silly when I own that I was pleased
with the admiration I excited. I was thought
a great flirt. I see you are beginning to laugh
already, and you have a perfect right to do so,
for you are entirely free from the faults which
I have just admitted."</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, I am not laughing," remarked
May, trying to look grave.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," resumed Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Amongst my host of admirers there was only

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

one who really interested me, and before I was
aware of it he had contrived to win my heart.
Your grandpapa, who was resolved that I should
never, with his consent, marry any other than a
man of fortune, forbade me to think of the
person on whom I had foolishly fixed my affections.
Ah! what a struggle it cost me to obey.
Recollect that this was at nineteen&mdash;your own
age, darling. I had no tender mother into whose
pitying breast I could pour my grief. Sympathy
from my father I had none."</p>

<p>Here she paused for a few moments, overpowered
by her recollections.</p>

<p>"Of course," she continued, "all has turned
out for the best. I was very silly then. Your
grandpapa&mdash;stern as I deemed him&mdash;was quite
right, and I was quite wrong. But I did not
think so at the time&mdash;and I was wretched.
Now, my dear child," she added, looking into

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

her daughter's face, "you will not, after this
confession, withhold your confidence from me.
You are not circumstanced as I was, darling.
Your papa will never oppose your inclinations&mdash;nor
will I. We both love you tenderly. You
are not a flirt&mdash;but a pretty girl, with a good
fortune, <i>must</i> have admirers. I had no fortune.
If you have a preference for any of your <i>pretendants</i>&mdash;as
I fancy you have&mdash;do not hesitate
to avow it."</p>

<p>"Really, dear mamma," replied May, who had
listened with some surprise to this address, "I
scarcely know how to answer you. It would be
ridiculous in me to pretend I am not aware that
some young men who come here do pay me attention.
But I have never thought seriously about
any of them."</p>

<p>"But there is a young man who is in the house&mdash;what
of him?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

<p>"Make yourself quite easy, dear mamma. I
have not lost my heart to cousin Oswald."</p>

<p>"Cousin Oswald&mdash;or I am very much mistaken&mdash;thinks
otherwise."</p>

<p>"So he may&mdash;so, perhaps, he does&mdash;but he is a
silly fellow so to delude himself. I like Oswald.
He has excellent qualities, and a disposition that
might attach any one to him. I know he is
devoted to me; but for all that I cannot love him&mdash;except
as a cousin. There, mamma, do you now
understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my love," replied Mrs. Radcliffe,
dissembling her satisfaction. "I am rather sorry
for poor Oswald."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sometimes sorry for him myself.
But what am I to do? How am I to cure him
without giving him pain? Whenever I am about
to speak seriously to him, he looks at me so imploringly
that I cannot find in my heart to crush

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

his hopes altogether. So we go on. He follows
me about like papa's great water-spaniel, Neptune,
and I treat him much as I treat Neptune. I
believe if I were to throw a stick into the lake,
and bid Oswald fetch it, he would plunge in at
once as readily as Neptune."</p>

<p>And she laughed heartily at the notion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe smiled secretly, but remarked,
"I am shocked to hear you compare your good-natured
and devoted cousin to a water-spaniel."</p>

<p>"I am a friend to dogs, for they are honest
creatures, as Pierre says in the play, mamma.
Oswald is as honest and good a creature as ever
lived, and has the fidelity and attachment of a
dog, so I think the comparison is not so very
inappropriate. Have you finished your catechism?"</p>

<p>"Quite; I find I shall have nothing to say to
your papa on your birthday."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

<p>"Papa won't be sorry for that, I think," remarked
the young lady, archly.</p>

<p>"Well, let us change the topic, my love. I
have just been to see poor Mr. St. Ives. Thanks
to Mrs. Sutton's care, he has almost recovered
from the injuries he received from the robbers.
All the circumstances attending his arrival here
are so singular that my curiosity has been greatly
excited about him."</p>

<p>"So has mine, mamma. Tell me what he is
like, in the first place?"</p>

<p>"You saw him when he was brought into the
house, and can judge of his appearance."</p>

<p>"True; but he looked so dreadfully pale then.
I thought him dying. He appeared to be very
handsome."</p>

<p>"He has quite what the French call '<i>l'air d'un
grand seigneur</i>.' I was very much struck, I assure
you, and from the first moment felt an interest in

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

him, for which I find it difficult to account. This
sort of thing is very unusual with me, for I rarely
take an interest in a perfect stranger. But Mr.
St. Ives is not an ordinary person."</p>

<p>"He seems a very mysterious person, mamma.
Papa and Oswald can tell me nothing about him.
Have you learnt any particulars?"</p>

<p>"The principal features of his history, so far as
I can ascertain them, are these: He has been
brought up at Exeter, and has recently been in
France, where I fancy he has relatives. He lost
his mother in infancy; and his father, I believe&mdash;for
this is mere surmise on my part&mdash;is in India."</p>

<p>"How came he to be crossing Wootton Heath
on the night when he was robbed?"</p>

<p>"He seems to have been on his way to town,
and had with him, in his knapsack, some important
documents, of which, unluckily, he has
been deprived by the robbers."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

<p>"So I heard," cried May. "I want to know
what those documents relate to."</p>

<p>"Then you must suspend your curiosity till to-morrow,
when you will probably see him, and can
question him, if you think proper. If he is able
to do so, he will come down to breakfast in the
morning. I took care to tell him that it is an
interesting anniversary."</p>

<p>"The anniversary can have no interest to him,"
observed May.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my love; he was much flattered
by being allowed to join the family party on such
an occasion."</p>

<p>At this moment the door was partially opened,
and a good-humoured, good-looking face was seen
at it.</p>

<p>The face was Oswald's. He asked if he might
come in.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch06">

<p>VI.</p>

<p class="small">OSWALD.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Receiving</span> permission, he shut the door and
advanced, but his aunt motioned him to keep
off.</p>

<p>"You have been smoking, Oswald. Give him
some eau-de-Cologne, May."</p>

<p>Instantly retiring, Oswald took a seat on a
causeuse on the opposite side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, he was a very handsome young
fellow, tall, well built, and well set on his lower
limbs, which, as he wore knickerbockers, could be

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

seen to be remarkably well turned. He had an
open countenance, brown curling locks, whiskers
a few shades lighter than his hair, and brushed
back according to the prevailing mode, regular
features, light grey eyes, and a fresh complexion,
denoting the most perfect health. Not, perhaps,
a very intellectual face, but a very pleasant one,
nevertheless. Considering his personal advantages
and his devotion, it is rather surprising that May
should care so little about him.</p>

<p>"What has brought you here, Oswald?" inquired
his aunt.</p>

<p>"I have a piece of news for you," he replied.
"I have just got a letter from my mother. Who
do you think is coming here to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Your mother!" cried Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I hope so," added May. "I shall be delighted
to see her."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Oswald, laughing. "Your

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

grandpapa is coming. Perhaps you won't be quite
so delighted to see <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>Exclamations of surprise were uttered both by
mamma and daughter.</p>

<p>Oswald easily perceived, from the expression of
his aunt's face, that the intelligence was not altogether
agreeable to her. At any other time she
would have been glad to see her father; but at
this particular juncture, when Hilary St. Ives
was in the house, and when she had a little
project on foot in regard to him, the shrewd and
suspicious old gentleman was very likely to be
in the way, and might interfere with her plan.
Besides, <i>he</i> had known Seymour Delacombe intimately
in days gone by, and would naturally
be struck by the likeness borne to him by Hilary.
These reflections passed rapidly through her mind,
and gave to her countenance the expression
noticed by Oswald.</p>

<p>"I wonder your grandpapa has not written to

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

me to announce his intention," she observed, in
a tone that showed she was a little put out.</p>

<p>"He felt sure he would be welcome, as he
will be, mamma," said May. "It is long since
dear grandpapa has paid us a visit. I am glad
he is coming at last."</p>

<p>"Yes; I only wish he had deferred his visit
for a week," objected her mother. "Poor Mr.
St. Ives has got his room, and, as you know,
your grandpapa is very particular, and won't be
satisfied with any other room than the one he is
accustomed to."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he have it?" cried Oswald.
"St. Ives must turn out. Luckily he's well
enough, or will be well enough to-morrow to
take his departure."</p>

<p>"I've asked him to stay here for a week to
recruit," said Mrs. Radcliffe, in a tone of rebuke.
"Sutton will find him another room."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you indeed, aunt," said Oswald,

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

a little abashed, and secretly wishing that the
young man had never got into the house at all.</p>

<p>"Have the robbers been caught, Oswald? Has
Mr. St. Ives's knapsack been recovered?" inquired
May.</p>

<p>"No. Wormald, the police-officer, has just
been here. Still at fault, though he is not without
hopes of capturing the gipsies; for he thinks
they are concealed in the neighbourhood. Poor
St. Ives, I fear, has said good-bye to his precious
documents."</p>

<p>"Apparently, they are a great loss to him,"
observed May, in a sympathising tone.</p>

<p>"If he wants them back he ought to offer a
jolly good reward for them," cried Oswald. "But
I say, aunt, what has become of the miniature
that used to hang up there? I mean the portrait
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Seeing from his aunt's looks that he had

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

asked the wrong question, he stopped short,
though he had some observations to make.</p>

<p>"You have no business to be so inquisitive,
sir," said Mrs. Radcliffe, in a tone calculated to
check further remarks on the subject, and it had
the effect desired.</p>

<p>"Aunt Bell, I trust, gives a good account of
herself?" interposed May, coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>"You shall see her letter," he replied, giving
it to her.</p>

<p>"What a very long letter! Must I read it
aloud?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"By all means," he replied, with affected nonchalance.
"There are no secrets in it. It
relates chiefly to yourself. I ought, perhaps, to
have kept it back till to-morrow&mdash;but no matter."</p>

<p>May then read as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>"Your time seems to have been so fully and

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

agreeably occupied, you dear, undutiful boy, that
you appear not to have had a moment to spare
for your poor mother, who has been anxiously
expecting a letter from you for the last fortnight,
and has been doomed to constant disappointment.
After so prolonged a silence you
ought to have something pleasant to communicate.</p>

<p>"Your last letter, now nearly three weeks old&mdash;think
of that, sir!&mdash;was full of rapturous descriptions
of May&mdash;as if I didn't know how
lovely and amiable she is&mdash;and the impression it
conveyed, whether designed or not on your part,
is that you have fallen in love with your charming
cousin."</p>

<p>"I think I had better not read any more," said
May, stopping.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, pray go on," Oswald entreated.</p>

<p>"I shall not be surprised if it turns out to be
so, for it is scarcely possible to be constantly in

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

the society of so adorable a creature as May without
becoming passionately enamoured of her.
Such, at least, is my notion. And I remember
the time when your aunt, who was quite as pretty
as May now is, could not avoid making conquests
of all who came near her."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, mamma?" asked
May, pausing. "I hope you are flattered."</p>

<p>Gross as it was, the flattery was not a whit
too strong for Mrs. Radcliffe. But she said,</p>

<p>"I wonder your Aunt Bell could write so silly
a letter. But let us hear it out."</p>

<p>"I think I have divined your secret, my dear
boy, but you do not throw any light on a point
that is naturally of the utmost interest to me.
You tell me you are May's constant companion,
in her walks, in her rides, in her drives. You
say she sings and plays so divinely, that you could
listen to her for ever. You say you act as her

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

head-gardener, and would act as her groom if she
would let you; and you mention several other
particulars that prove how devoted you are to
her; but you do <i>not</i> tell me the one thing I most
desire to know. You do not even hint that your
charming cousin, with whom you are evidently
smitten, manifests the slightest predilection for
you."</p>

<p>Here Oswald coughed slightly. May, however,
would not raise her eyes from the letter to look
at him, but went on.</p>

<p>"A mother's vanity may mislead me, but I
cannot think, from the opportunities she has of
knowing them, that May can be insensible to
your many good qualities; or, shall I say it?&mdash;indifferent to
your personal advantages. I fondly
persuade myself that the attachment must be
mutual. You have a noble and true heart, my
dear boy, if you have not the cleverest head in

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

the world. In some respects, and these not the
least important to her happiness, May will not
find your superior. That I can affirm. I have
long entertained the idea that you are formed for
each other. Heaven grant you may be united!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" ejaculated Oswald, fervently.</p>

<p>"Is there much more?" inquired Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good deal, mamma."</p>

<p>"Pray stop, if you have had enough," said
Oswald.</p>

<p>But May went on.</p>

<p>"As I cannot divest myself of the impression,
that you and your fair cousin will make a match
of it (or, as your Aunt Radcliffe used to say, when
a girl, 'put up your horses in the same stable'), I
have written to your grandpapa to press him to
make a settlement upon you. He is very rich,
and lives so inexpensively, that a few thousands

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

can be no object whatever to him. You are certain
to be his heir; but he is hale and hearty,
and has such a capital constitution, that he may,
and I sincerely hope, will, last for several years.
May is a great favourite with him, and since
there is every prospect of your being united to
her, I feel pretty sure he will place you in an
independent position, and remove any obstacles
that might otherwise arise on that score. As he
is as punctual as the Duke of Wellington used to
be, and sure to reply without delay, I won't send
off this letter till I hear from him."</p>

<p>"Has she got his answer?" inquired Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear aunt, yes," replied Oswald, eagerly.
"Do finish the letter, May."</p>

<p>"I told you I should not be kept long in
suspense. To my great surprise, and no less to
my delight, your grandpapa has answered my

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

letter in person, and is now with me at Dunham
Lodge. He is in very good humour, and apparently
much pleased with the idea of the match.
He won't make any positive promise, but I think
he will do what we desire. That he means to do
something is certain, for he has determined to
start for Hazlemere House at once, and ascertain
by personal inspection, as he says, 'how the land
lies.'</p>

<p>"To-morrow he will be in town, and stay at the
Langham Hotel, and on the following morning,
1st of May, will run down to Hazlemere. He is
an odd man, as your aunt knows full well, and
his design is to take her by surprise; but I think
she ought to be prepared for his visit.</p>

<p>"It now only remains for me, in concluding this
long letter, to wish dearest May many, many
happy returns of her birthday. May the day
prove auspicious; and a long and blissful term, in

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

which she and you will be principally concerned,
date from it. How proud and happy your mother
will be, if her fond anticipations are realised."</p>

<p>"That is all," observed May, putting down the
letter.</p>

<p>"And enough too," said her mother.</p>

<p>Small need, we think, to state that Mrs. Woodcot's
letter was meant to be shown to Mrs. Radcliffe
and May, but that clever lady never supposed
her son would allow it to be read under
such absurd circumstances as those recorded. The
comical intonation given by May to certain passages,
on which he had most relied, entirely
destroyed their effect, and before the letter was
ended, he perceived the mistake he had made,
and became very hot and confused. Not knowing
what to say, he cast one of those imploring
looks, to which she was accustomed, at his fair
cousin; but she was not to be moved now.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

<p>At last he stammered out, "I should never
have ventured upon a declaration, if I had not
been prompted by that unlucky letter. But do
let me learn my fate."</p>

<p>"Your fate is not in my hands," replied May.
"I have no other answer to give to such a question.
What can you have been saying about me
to Aunt Bell to cause her to write to grandpapa
as she has done? You have placed me in a
very ridiculous position."</p>

<p>"I will ask pardon on my bended knees, if
that will soften you," he cried, about to suit the
action to the word.</p>

<p>"Remain where you are, sir. I cannot treat
this as a jest. Grandpapa is coming. How is
he to be undeceived?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," rejoined Oswald, driven to
his wits' end. "But, upon my honour, I had no
idea my mother would write to him, still less that

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

the old gentleman would come here to perplex
us."</p>

<p>"No, you could not possibly foresee that,
Oswald," observed his aunt. "Your mother
should not have been so precipitate. But I understand
her feelings, and can excuse her. You
must make allowances for Oswald, May. It
was natural that he should delude himself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, aunt, thank you," he cried,
gratefully. "I certainly believed&mdash;that is, I
fancied May was not quite indifferent to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been to blame," said May,
relenting. "You are not the only person who
has been deceived by my manner," she added,
glancing archly at her mother. "So take my
forgiveness."</p>

<p>And she extended her hand towards him,
which he pressed eagerly to his lips.</p>

<p>"I suspect she loves him, in spite of her denial,"
thought Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

<p>"I hope grandpapa's errand won't be altogether
fruitless," said May. "Mamma, you must try
and persuade him to do something for poor
Oswald."</p>

<p>"Nay, my love, it rests with you, and not
with me. On one condition, no doubt your grandpapa
will do something."</p>

<p>"But that condition I cannot agree to," she
rejoined.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Oswald, despairingly. "Don't
trouble yourselves about me," he added, with a
broken-hearted expression. "I care for nothing
now. I shall go abroad. I don't know what I
shall do. But I shall not remain longer here."</p>

<p>"Not if I beg you to stay?" said May, in a
coaxing tone that was quite irresistible.</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you bid me," he replied,
with the submission of a slave.</p>

<p>"Then I order you to remain over my birthday,"

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

she said. "You shall go when you please
afterwards."</p>

<p>Just then an interruption was offered by the
entrance of Mr. Radcliffe, who came in quest of
Oswald.</p>

<p>"I thought I should find you here," he said,
clapping his nephew on the shoulder as he advanced
to greet his wife, whom he had not seen
before on that morning.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch07">

<p>VII.</p>

<p class="small">MR. RADCLIFFE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Radcliffe</span> was turned sixty, rather above
the middle size, and had the portly figure and
large features which <i>Punch</i> is wont to assign to
John Bull. He looked the picture of good health,
and, though stout, he was active, and took a great
deal of exercise, living as much as he could in
the open air. He wore rather large whiskers,
which, with his snow-white locks, contrasted
forcibly with his rosy complexion. He did not
wear the traditional John Bull top-boots, but his

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

sturdy legs were clothed in a pair of Mr. Bowley's
incomparable cool gaiters. He had a loose blue
coat with brass buttons, and a baggy waistcoat.
Mr. Radcliffe's manner towards his wife was
singularly deferential, and it was evident she had
lost none of her influence over him. Years had
in no degree diminished his admiration of her
beauty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe thought it best to let him know
immediately that her father was coming on the
following day, and though much surprised, he was
greatly pleased by the intelligence. The difficulty
in regard to the room in which Hilary St. Ives
was lodged at once occurred to him, as it had done
to his wife. But this was soon got over.</p>

<p>All being settled, Mr. Radcliffe chuckled, and
rubbed his hands with satisfaction at the thought
of seeing his father-in-law, whom he liked very
much.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

<p>"I must get out some of my '20 port for him,"
he cried, smacking his lips. "He will want a
glass of it to drink your health, May, and so shall
I&mdash;ha! ha!" And he laughed his resonant
laugh. "Oswald must drink it in claret, since
he can't stand port. By-the-by, I had forgotten
what I came about," addressing his nephew.
"Mrs. Sutton wants to go to Guildford on some
business of her own. You must drive her in the
dog-cart to the Gomshall station. I can't very
well spare the time myself. Besides, I expect
some people to call upon me."</p>

<p>"I shall like it of all things," replied Oswald.
"But I suppose I shan't have to wait at the
station till she comes back from Guildford."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;she won't return till late. A fly
will bring her home."</p>

<p>"This must be a sudden idea," exclaimed Mrs.
Radcliffe, surprised. "Sutton was with me just

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

now, and said nothing about going to Guildford.
What is to happen to poor Mr. St. Ives?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he'll take no harm," replied her husband.
"Boston will look after him. He has got
the <i>Times</i>, and a book to amuse him&mdash;and can
have a cigar if he likes. No, I beg pardon, my
love. I know you don't allow smoking in the
bedrooms."</p>

<p>"I wish I could prevent it everywhere else in
the house. But I want to know why Sutton is
going to Guildford."</p>

<p>"She wants to go to the bank, I believe, my
dear. You had better not keep her waiting,
Oswald. The dog-cart has been ordered a quarter
of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't understand that," cried the
young man. And with an expressive look at
May, he quitted the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was puzzled, but she fancied

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

this sudden expedition to Guildford had some
relation to Hilary St. Ives. What surprised her
most was, that Mrs. Sutton had not consulted her
before taking the step. However, she could not
ask further questions, without appearing too
curious.</p>

<p>"I fancy Sutton has saved money," observed
Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I dare say she has," she replied.</p>

<p>This was a very evasive, and by no means
truthful, response. She knew perfectly well that
the housekeeper <i>had</i> saved what Oswald would
have called "a pot of money."</p>

<p>"Well, May," said her father, looking at her,
"now that Oswald is gone, I have something
to tell you."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear papa?" she inquired. "Why
should it be a secret from Oswald?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know why," he replied, smiling.

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

"But you shall judge whether I have acted
discreetly, or not. I have just received a proposal
of marriage for you. Now, was I right
in reserving this communication for your own
ear, and for that of your mamma?"</p>

<p>"You were quite right, papa," she replied.</p>

<p>"Does the offer meet your approval, my dear?"
inquired Mrs. Radcliffe, not feeling at all certain
from her husband's manner that it did so.</p>

<p>"I can raise no objection to it. On the contrary,
I am bound to say that, viewed in a certain
light, the offer is highly advantageous. Not to
keep you a moment longer in suspense," he
added to May, "it is Sir Charles Ilminster of
Boxgrove Park, who, through me, offers you his
hand."</p>

<p>May did not make a remark, but, from having
blushed deeply, she became quite pale.</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt to influence you one way

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

or the other, my love," said her father, kindly.
"You must consider well before you decide."</p>

<p>"You are the kindest papa in the world," she
cried, flinging her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe thought it behoved her to say a
few words.</p>

<p>"Most girls would think that an offer from a
handsome young baronet, with a fine place, did
not require much consideration," she observed.</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Ilminster is thirty-five, mamma."</p>

<p>"I like that. Thirty-five is young for a
baronet. Sir Charles is in the prime of life. He
belongs to an old family&mdash;one of the oldest in
the county. His estates are unencumbered, I
believe. To add to his numerous recommendations,
he stands quite alone. There is no Dowager
Lady Ilminster. He has only a sister, Lady
Richborough, a widow, and a most charming
person."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

<p>"I quite agree with you, mamma, Lady Richborough
<i>is</i> charming."</p>

<p>"Is not Sir Charles charming?"</p>

<p>"Agreeable, gentleman-like, good-looking&mdash;yes.
Charming&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Boxgrove, I repeat, is an exceedingly fine
place."</p>

<p>"Granted. But I like Hazlemere quite as
well."</p>

<p>"Absurd. The two places cannot be compared.
Boxgrove is an ancient mansion, with a noble
park. Ours is&mdash;but I won't depreciate it. You
are sadly wanting in taste, my love, and I fear
in discrimination. The main point is, whether
you at all like Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"I neither like him, nor dislike him, mamma.
I am simply indifferent about him."</p>

<p>"You will have to make up your mind by
to-morrow, my dear," said her father. "He is

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

coming over with Lady Richborough and will
expect an answer."</p>

<p>"I will give Lady Richborough my answer,"
said May.</p>

<p>"Incomprehensible girl!" cried her mother.</p>

<p>"Well, do as you please," observed Mr. Radcliffe.
"I've said I won't influence you, and I'll
keep my word. But I am bound to confirm all
your mamma has said about Sir Charles Ilminster.
A wrong conclusion might be drawn from my
silence. And now, my dear," he added to his
wife, "you must excuse me. I can't stand the
heat of this room any longer. It feels like a
furnace."</p>

<p>"I feel it very warm, too, papa," cried May.
"I must have a turn in the garden."</p>

<p>And they quitted the room together.</p>

<p>"We shall see what effect Hilary will produce,"
mused Mrs. Radcliffe, as she was left alone. "He

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

is far handsomer than Sir Charles, and much
younger. But then he has nothing. I wonder
why Sutton has gone to Guildford."</p>

<p>May and her father reached the garden just
in time to see the dog-cart, with Mrs. Sutton
and Oswald inside it, dash through the lodge-gates.
The young man waved his hand to them.</p>

<p>Another person, stationed at the window of an
upper chamber, watched them as they moved
slowly across the lawn.</p>

<p>This person was ravished by May's beauty.
Never had he beheld a countenance so enchanting,
nor a figure so light and graceful. His heart
was lost to her at once.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch08">

<p>VIII.</p>

<p class="small">SIR CHARLES ILMINSTER AND LADY RICHBOROUGH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dog-cart was on its way to the station.</p>

<p>Those within it ought to have been enlivened
by the rare beauty of the morning, and by the
smiling aspect of nature; but they were not.
The conversation, commenced by Oswald, soon
dropped. Mrs. Sutton was evidently preoccupied,
and would not give heed to his talk.</p>

<p>They had crossed a breezy common&mdash;not the
heath upon which Hilary had been lost, but an
equally picturesque tract&mdash;and soon afterwards

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

entered a long defile, if it may be properly so
termed, which led them between the North
Downs.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the beauty of the pass.
A small river took its course through the narrow
valley, and the road skirting its banks offered
charming points of view. In many cases the
sides of the downs were clothed with timber,
while the mansions to which those woods belonged
could be descried through openings amid the
trees.</p>

<p>One of the most extensive and most beautiful
of the parks in question belonged to Sir Charles
Ilminster, of whom mention has just been made.
Sir Charles's noble ancestral mansion occupied
a commanding situation, and overlooked the whole
of the lovely surrounding district.</p>

<p>Drawn by Spanker, the dog-cart was going at
a rattling pace past the tall grey palings that

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

served to keep the deer within Boxgrove Park,
when a turn in the road showed Oswald a lady
and gentleman on horseback, followed by a groom,
about a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>

<p>In these persons he had no difficulty in recognising
the owner of the adjoining property,
and his sister, Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>As Sir Charles and the lady with him were
proceeding very leisurely, the intervening distance
was soon cleared by Spanker. The groom
touched his hat as the dog-cart passed him, and
his master and Lady Richborough, hearing the
sound of wheels, turned to see who was coming
on.</p>

<p>Both were extremely well mounted. Sir Charles
had a decidedly military look and bearing&mdash;not
surprising, since he had been in the &mdash;th Lancers,
and had served with distinction. He had a tall,
symmetrical figure; handsome, but rather pronounced

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

features; and wore thick moustaches
and a long imperial.</p>

<p>High-bred, high-minded, high-spirited, chivalrous,
Sir Charles was the soul of honour, and
had a spice of romance in his composition.</p>

<p>Ten years younger than her brother, Lady
Richborough was in the full &eacute;clat of her resplendent
beauty. Magnificent black hair, eyes
of almost Oriental size and splendour, veiled by
long dark eyelashes, classically cut features, a full
mouth, and rounded chin, these constituted some
of her charms. To her personal attractions she
added most fascinating manners, and a remarkable
power of pleasing when she cared to exert it. A
perfect Amazon, she never looked better than
on horseback. She sat her steed well, and her
riding-habit brought out the best points of her
superb figure.</p>

<p>The widow of Sir Algernon Richborough, a

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

Yorkshire baronet, who unfortunately had a son
by a former marriage, besides other children, her
charming ladyship had a tolerably good jointure.
But, alas! a very harsh restriction was attached
to it.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon was of a jealous nature, and had
not sufficient confidence in his lovely wife. Not
believing she would be faithful to his memory,
he decreed that her jointure should depart from
her if she married again. But for this proceeding,
which we cannot too strongly condemn, it is
certain Lady Richborough would not have remained
two years a widow.</p>

<p>How dreadfully mercenary are the young men
of the day! A thousand charms, without money,
will not fix them. The report that Lady Richborough
would lose her jointure on marriage
scared all her young admirers. Some more mature
pretendants, with better taste and larger means,

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

would not have minded the loss. But they did
not suit Lady Richborough, who was determined
upon having a young partner in her second <i>noces</i>.</p>

<p>It remains only to state that the lovely widow
had a house in Eaton-place. But she only occupied
it during the season, and generally took
care of her brother at Boxgrove.</p>

<p>Only of late, Sir Charles Ilminster had become
intimate with the Radcliffes, and the intimacy was
brought about by the great fancy taken for May
by Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>Sir Charles, who was said to have had an early
disappointment, from which he had never entirely
recovered, and which had hitherto prevented him
from marrying, was not proof against the charms
of the youthful beauty. May's freshness and
vivacity enchanted him, and though the connection
was not exactly one he would have sought if his
feelings had not been strongly engaged, he began

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

seriously to entertain the idea of making her his
wife.</p>

<p>Before taking the decisive step, however, he
consulted his sister. She had already perceived
the effect produced upon him, and in reality had
helped to fan the flame by her praises of the
object of his regards; and, as may be supposed,
he met with no opposition from her. On the contrary,
she applauded his choice, and counselled him
not to lose time, but secure the prize, lest it should
slip through his fingers.</p>

<p>This argument, of which he recognised the full
force, prevailed, and induced him to make the
formal proposal just reported to the reader. The
groom having delivered the letter containing the
proposal, had rejoined his master, who had ridden
on to Wootton, and Sir Charles was returning
to Boxgrove, when overtaken by Oswald.</p>

<p>On recalling Sir Charles and his sister, who

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

had reined in their horses, Oswald pulled up, and
greetings were exchanged.</p>

<p>After favouring the young man with one of her
most bewitching smiles, and allowing him to touch
the tips of her gloved fingers, her ladyship addressed
herself to Mrs. Sutton, of whose influence
with all parties at Hazlemere she was quite cognisant,
and bringing her horse as close as she could
to the housekeeper, began to chat with her in the
most affable and friendly manner, making all sorts
of affectionate inquiries respecting May and Mrs.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton knew that Sir Charles's groom had
brought a letter that morning from his master to
Mr. Radcliffe, and her ladyship's attentions, coupled
with the haughty baronet's altered manner, led her
to suspect the truth.</p>

<p>While Lady Richborough was thus employed.
Sir Charles took Oswald in hand, and ascertained,

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

much to his relief, that he was merely conveying
Mrs. Sutton to the Gomshall station. We say to
Sir Charles's relief, for, with all a lover's doubts
and trepidation, he had at first imagined that the
young man and his companion were on the way to
Boxgrove, charged with some sort of reply to his
proposal. A little reflection would have shown
him the absurdity of the supposition, but time for
reflection had not been allowed him.</p>

<p>With unwonted courtesy, he then pressed
Oswald to take luncheon with him on his way
back, and the young man readily accepted the invitation.
Like all who came near her, Oswald
was charmed with Lady Richborough, and was
delighted at the prospect of passing an hour in
her society.</p>

<p>Hilary St. Ives formed the next topic of discourse,
in which everybody took part. Of course,
her ladyship had heard of the strange circumstances

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

of the case&mdash;how the young man had been
robbed and half murdered on Wootton Heath,
and brought to Hazlemere. How was he going
on? Was he still alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was able to assure her that Mr. St.
Ives was not only alive, but going on so well, that
he would most probably come down-stairs on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Lady Richborough was astonished. Never was
anything so wonderful. He owed his life to Mrs.
Sutton. But they all knew what an excellent
nurse she was.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton acknowledged the compliment, and
said she should not have left her patient if there
had been the least danger in doing so.</p>

<p>Her ladyship next inquired if it was true that
Mr. St. Ives was very handsome. Whereupon,
Oswald immediately called out that he was the
handsomest fellow he had ever seen.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

<p>On this, Sir Charles pricked up his ears, and
wanted to know all about him, but no satisfactory
answer could be given to his inquiries.</p>

<p>"Well, we are coming over to Hazlemere to-morrow,
and then we shall probably see him, and
learn something more," observed her ladyship.
"A pleasant journey to you, dear Mrs. Sutton."</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Mrs. Sutton," thought the housekeeper,
as she bowed adieu. "I see how it is, clearly
enough. But they are mistaken, if they calculate
on me."</p>

<p>"We shall see you at luncheon, Mr. Woodcot,"
said Sir Charles, waving his hand to Oswald.</p>

<p>The young man nodded, raised his hat to Lady
Richborough, and just touching Spanker with the
whip, quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>"You will laugh at what I am going to say,
Myrtilla," observed Sir Charles to his sister, as
they rode towards the handsome park lodge; "but

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

I have an unaccountable feeling that the arrival at
Hazlemere of this mysterious St. Ives, at this particular
juncture, bodes ill to me. I fear a rival in
him&mdash;a successful rival."</p>

<p>"A rival!" exclaimed her ladyship, displaying
her pearly teeth, as she laughed heartily. "I
know you are excessively superstitious, Charley,
but I didn't think you so bad as this. Dismiss
such idle fears. Handsome as they say he is,
St. Ives is not likely to cut <i>you</i> out. He has
appeared on the scene in a very strange manner,
I allow; but he will very soon make his exit.
You have far more reason to fear rivalry from
Oswald Woodcot. He is in love with his fair
cousin, that's certain. But, as I have told you,
I don't think he has made the slightest impression
upon her heart. As to St. Ives, I will undertake
that she shan't fall in love with <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dog-cart pursued its way.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

<p>Having now recovered in some degree from
his depression, Oswald unbosomed himself to his
companion, confessing that he had shown his
mother's letter to Mrs. Radcliffe and May. Mrs.
Sutton looked grave, and told him he had pursued
an exceedingly injudicious course, and need not
be surprised at the result, adding that it would
be very difficult to repair the error he had committed.
While blaming his imprudence, she promised
him her best assistance to set matters right;
and the promise raised the poor down-hearted
fellow's hopes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was secretly much vexed on learning
that old Mr. Thornton was coming to Hazlemere
next day, as his visit threatened to embarrass
her plans. But she took care not to let her
annoyance appear.</p>

<p>They reached the station just ten minutes
before the arrival of the Guildford train. Oswald

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

would have waited to see Mrs. Sutton off, if she
would have allowed him. She told him she
should not return till late, as she had a good deal
to do at Guildford. So he lighted a cigar, and
drove off to Boxgrove, anticipating a pleasant
luncheon.</p>

<p>When the train came up, Mrs. Sutton entered
a first-class carriage.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch09">

<p>IX.</p>

<p class="small">WHY MRS. SUTTON WENT TO GUILDFORD, AND WHOM SHE
MET THERE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A pleasant</span> old town is Guildford&mdash;none
pleasanter in England&mdash;and on that sunshiny
spring day it wore an unusually cheerful aspect.
The square tower of the ancient Norman castle,
reared upon its lofty mound in the centre of the
town, looked proudly, yet smilingly, on the many
picturesque edifices, halls, churches, hospitals, and
quaintly-gabled habitations clustered around it.
Bright and beautiful looked the hills near the

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

town&mdash;fairest of all being St. Catherine's Hill,
which now looked so lovely and inviting that a
devotee might have been tempted to climb to the
desecrated chapel on its brow. Fair looked the
woods, wherein lies buried antique and storied
Losely&mdash;fair looked the groves around Compton&mdash;fair
looked the valley, through which wanders
the Wey.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Sutton passed rapidly through the
lovely valley of the Wey, and approached the
picturesque old town, she could not help casting
a glance at the towering keep; but otherwise,
we regret to say, she was insensible to the
beauties of the scene. Her mind was fully occupied
with the business she had to do.</p>

<p>Quitting the large and bustling station, at
which two important lines unite, she took her
way up the High-street. It was rather crowded
at the time, and many carriages passed her, but

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

she looked at none of them. She bought her
own dresses, and most of Mrs. Radcliffe's dresses,
at Guildford; but she was not going to the
draper's or the milliner's now. She had extensive
dealings with several other tradespeople, but
she did not enter a single shop. She went on
till she came to the London and County Bank.</p>

<p>As she entered the bank, a very respectable
middle-aged man, rather bald, and wearing spectacles,
who was engaged with his books at a desk
at the back, happened to turn his head, and
catching sight of her, he immediately quitted his
occupation, and saluted her deferentially.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Sutton. Glad to see
you, ma'am. What can I have the pleasure of
doing for you?" he inquired, in bland tones.</p>

<p>"I want to draw out a little money, Mr. Price,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"How much will you take, ma'am?" said Mr.

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

Price. "I will write out the draft for you, if
you please."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Be good enough to write it
for six hundred pounds."</p>

<p>Mr. Price looked a little surprised, but made
no remark, and having written out the cheque,
he passed it over the counter for her signature.</p>

<p>"How will you take the money, madam?" was
the next inquiry.</p>

<p>"In five bank notes, each for one hundred.
The remaining hundred in smaller notes. Stay,
I should like twenty pounds in gold."</p>

<p>"Very good."</p>

<p>And the bank notes and gold being at once
produced and delivered to her, she proceeded to
secure them in her portemonnaie and pocket-book&mdash;for
she needed both.</p>

<p>While she was thus employed, Mr. Price told
her he had just been reading in the <i>Surrey Gazette</i>

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

an account of the robbery of Mr. St. Ives on
Wootton Heath, and he presumed the newspaper
was correct in stating that the unfortunate young
gentleman had been conveyed to Hazlemere, by
Mr. Radcliffe. Being informed that the statement
was exact in all its particulars, Mr. Price
next expressed his surprise at the great remissness
of the police. What were they about? The
robbers ought long since to have been captured.
In this Mrs. Sutton entirely concurred. But Mr.
Price did not stop here. He next ventured to
observe&mdash;and he made the remark with a peculiarly
soft smile&mdash;that he thought he knew how
Mrs. Sutton intended to invest her money. Mr.
Malham had been at the bank the other day, and
mentioned casually that a very desirable house
was to be sold at Wootton for six hundred
pounds&mdash;a great bargain&mdash;cheap as dirt. Mr.
Price hoped she was going to buy that house.

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

Mrs. Sutton's smile might have signified either
"yes" or "no," at the option of the observer;
but she made no direct response, and bowing to
Mr. Price, prepared to depart.</p>

<p>Just as she was going two persons entered the
bank. Unmistakably military men, and probably
from Aldershot camp, which, as the reader need
scarcely be informed, is not very far from
Guildford. The foremost of the two&mdash;a youngish
man, under thirty, apparently&mdash;scarcely merits
description. But his companion must not be thus
passed over. He was a very distinguished-looking
person indeed, fifteen years at least older than
his friend, but still strikingly handsome. His
aristocratic and refined demeanour did not savour
of the camp, though his bronzed visage, marked,
but not disfigured, by a large cicatrice, and grey
moustache proclaimed that he had served long
under an Indian or an African sun. If he had

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

so served, his health did not seem much impaired.
His dark eye was still full of fire, and his tall
thin figure perfectly erect. A dark-blue frock-coat
was buttoned tightly across his chest.</p>

<p>Both officers removed their cigars from their
lips as they entered the bank.</p>

<p>"Pray come in, colonel," cried Captain de
Vesci, the younger of the two. "I won't keep
you longer than is required to cash a cheque."</p>

<p>"I will wait for you as long as my cigar will
keep alight," replied the colonel, laughing.

That voice!&mdash;that well-known voice! which she
had not heard for many, many years, and never
expected to hear again, thrilled through Mrs.
Sutton's frame, and suspended for the moment
the action of her heart, causing such evident
emotion that she well-nigh sank to the ground.</p>

<p>All the colour fled from her cheeks. Even her
lips became white; and Mr. Price, noticing her

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

haggard looks, thought she must have been taken
suddenly ill, and felt half inclined to spring
across the counter to her assistance.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes towards the colonel, regarding
him as steadfastly as she dared. Yes, it
was he! But little changed&mdash;despite his grey
hair and the honourable scar upon his cheek.
She would have known him anywhere, and under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>Did he know her? He stared hard at her&mdash;struck
by the likeness to a long-forgotten and
once dear face. But how should he know her?
He believed&mdash;firmly believed&mdash;that she whom he
had loved in years long gone by was dead.
Nevertheless, this strange likeness to the lost one
greatly startled him.</p>

<p>Mustering all her courage&mdash;and she had need
of it&mdash;Mrs. Sutton passed him as firmly as she
could. Her dress brushed him slightly as she

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

went by, though he moved out of her way. How
she sustained herself at that trying moment she
could scarcely tell.</p>

<p>The colonel's curiosity being excited, he stepped
to the counter, and addressing Mr. Price said,</p>

<p>"Can you oblige me, sir, with the name of
the lady who has just gone out?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sutton," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"Good God! what a strong likeness!" mentally
ejaculated the colonel, too much disturbed
to ask any further questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton felt so extremely faint, that she
was obliged to enter a chemist's shop and procure
some sal-volatile. The stimulant presently
revived her, but she was still seated in the shop
when the colonel and Captain de Vesci passed
the door. Neither of them noticed her. They
were talking loudly, and she distinctly heard the
colonel observe to his friend,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

<p>"I wonder where the deuce that woman has
gone to!" a remark that elicited a laugh from the
captain.</p>

<p>Waiting till they were gone, she proceeded to
her milliner's, whose shop was close at hand, and
purchased one of those thick black veils which
are as effectual a disguise as a loo-mask used to
be to our great-grandmothers. Shrouded by this
veil she felt more easy, and repaired to the
White Hart, where, being well known, she was
at once ushered to a private room up-stairs by
the landlady, who seemed very glad to see her.
She ordered a little luncheon, and at the same
time asked for writing materials.</p>

<p>Left to herself, and having in some degree
regained her composure, she strove to reflect on
the extraordinary events that had recently taken
place. The last occurrence seemed to her the
strangest of all, and quite confounded her, upsetting

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

all her schemes, and filling her with
uneasiness.</p>

<p>She had every reason to suppose the colonel
was in India, and could not comprehend what
had brought him back. He could only have just
returned, for she was certain she should have
heard of his arrival from Mrs. Radcliffe if any
mention had been made of it in the public
journals. Yet he <i>had</i> returned. She had heard
his voice&mdash;had seen him. Here he was&mdash;on the
spot.</p>

<p>How was this unlooked-for danger to be guarded
against? A few days might possibly elapse before
Mrs. Radcliffe heard of his return&mdash;but she was
sure to hear of it ere long&mdash;in all probability
from himself. Nothing more certain than he
would be invited to Hazlemere. Equally certain
that he would come.</p>

<p>Distraction was in the thought. Fate seemed

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

at work. The peripeties of the dark drama in
which she enacted the principal and not wholly
guiltless part might be at hand.</p>

<p>From these meditations she was roused by the
waiter, who placed writing materials on a small
table beside her, and then proceeded to lay a
cover for luncheon.</p>

<p>Her plans were now so disconcerted that she
felt inclined to abandon her task; but at last she
resolved to bid defiance to fate, and go on.</p>

<p>After tracing a few lines on a sheet of paper
in bold, masculine characters, totally unlike her
usual handwriting, she enclosed the bank-notes
of large amount which she had just received, and
secured the letter in an envelope, which she
directed in the same bold hand.</p>

<p>She had just completed her task, when the
waiter informed her that luncheon was ready,
and asked if he should send her letter to the

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

post. She thanked him, but declined, and put
the letter in her bag.</p>

<p>She ate very little luncheon, but drank a glass
of sherry, as she still felt rather faint, and then
ringing the bell, paid her bill and prepared to
depart.</p>

<p>Voices in the entrance-hall beneath arrested
her on the stairs. The colonel and De Vesci were
there, lighting their cigars before going out. A
narrow escape. A moment sooner, and she must
have come upon them.</p>

<p>As soon as the coast was clear she descended,
said a few civil words to the hostess, who was
all smiles and politeness, and begged her respectful
duty to Mrs. Radcliffe, and then proceeded
to the station.</p>

<p>Not with the intention of returning to Gomshall,
though. Her day's work was not yet done. She
had another and a longer journey to perform.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch10">

<p>X.</p>

<p class="small">COLONEL DELACOMBE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> took a ticket by the South-Western Railway
to London, and remained in the ladies' waiting-room
till the train from Godalming came up.
Then selecting a first-class carriage, which was
nearly full, she got into it.</p>

<p>Till this moment she had dreaded another encounter
with the colonel, but she now felt secure.
But just when the train was about to start the
door opened, and the very person she sought to

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

avoid got in, and took the only vacant seat, which
happened to be opposite her own.</p>

<p>Captain de Vesci, who had accompanied him
to the door, muttered a word at parting, which
caused the colonel to glance inquisitively at his
vis-&agrave;-vis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton's features were completely masked
by her veil. Her eyes only could be distinguished,
and she shrank back in her seat as far as she
could.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the colonel lost no time
in addressing her. Assuming a most respectful
manner, he observed that he fancied he must
have seen her at the bank. No answer. He
ventured to make the inquiry, because he had been
struck by her extraordinary resemblance to a lady,
whom he had known very intimately in former
years. Under such circumstances she would
excuse him. A slight inclination of the head,

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

but no further response. He next spoke of Guildford
and Abbot's Hospital, which he had just
visited&mdash;a very curious place&mdash;uncommonly
curious. She had no interest whatever in Guildford,
or in Abbot's Hospital. Finding all his
attempts futile to engage her in conversation, he
was compelled to desist.</p>

<p>He opened a newspaper, and while feigning
to be occupied with it, stole an occasional glance
at her. She felt he was watching her, but though
trembling inwardly, did not betray the slightest
emotion.</p>

<p>After awhile he changed his tactics, and began
to converse with an elderly gentleman next him,
and she fancied some parts of his discourse were
intended for her ear. He informed this gentleman,
who proved to be the rector of Woking, that
he had just returned from India, and had landed
at Southampton in the <i>Poonah</i>. He had since been

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

at Aldershot, where his old regiment was stationed.
He had been so long in India that everything
appeared strange to him. Most of his friends
were dead, and the few who were left must have
forgotten him. As he made the latter remark, he
glanced at Mrs. Sutton; but though listening attentively,
she did not appear to notice what he
said.</p>

<p>The rector and his son got out at Woking, and
the colonel had again recourse to his newspaper.
At Weybridge, the two other persons quitted the
train, and he was left alone with the mysterious
lady. Now he was determined to have an answer
from her.</p>

<p>Rather abruptly, and in a somewhat different
tone from that which he had previously adopted,
he asked if she had ever been in India. She
answered faintly, "Never."</p>

<p>"Where can we have met then?" he cried.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

<p>"That we <i>have</i> met before to-day I am certain.
If not in India, it must have been in this country,
upwards of twenty years ago. I have only had a
momentary glimpse of your features, madam, but
they recalled so vividly the face of one very dear
to me, that if she were not lost to me for ever, I
should have believed you were she herself. Even
now I cannot wholly divest myself of the
idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of this, I beseech you, sir," interrupted
Mrs. Sutton. "I cannot&mdash;will not&mdash;listen
to it. You are quite mistaken in me. We have
never met before."</p>

<p>"By Heaven! the very voice!" cried the
colonel. "If you have a spark of pity in
your composition, madam, you will raise your
veil."</p>

<p>But she showed no signs of compliance, though
the request was still more passionately urged.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

<p>"Why do you refuse me?" he cried. "My
conduct may appear impertinent, but, on my soul!
I am influenced by no idle curiosity or improper
motive. Doubts have been created in my mind
that must be set at rest."</p>

<p>"I shall think you crazed if you continue in
this strain, sir," she rejoined. "If I happen to
resemble some one you have known, that is no
reason why I should be subjected to annoyance.
You are a perfect stranger to me."</p>

<p>"I am Seymour Delacombe. Does that name
awaken no recollections in your breast?"</p>

<p>"None," she rejoined, firmly.</p>

<p>The colonel fell back in his seat, with something
like a groan.</p>

<p>Looking up, shortly afterwards, he perceived
that she had turned aside, and was hastily removing
a handkerchief from her eyes.</p>

<p>"By Heaven! she is weeping," he mentally

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

exclaimed. And his doubts being again roused
by the discovery, he added, "I see you are moved,
madam. I assure you it has not been my wish
to distress or offend you. Far from it. I owe
you an explanation of my conduct, and if you
will permit me, I will give you such particulars
of my history as relate to the unhappy lady,
whose loss I deplore, and whom you so strangely
resemble in feature, voice, and person."</p>

<p>"Pray spare me the recital, sir," she rejoined,
with freezing coldness. "Doubtless the history
is curious, but it can have no interest for me.
I have no desire to be made the depositary of
your secrets."</p>

<p>"I fear I have really offended you, madam&mdash;but
it has been most inadvertently. I beg you to
accept my excuses."</p>

<p>"I cannot accept them, sir. Either you or I
must descend at the next station."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

<p>"I will relieve you of my society," he rejoined,
haughtily. "It will not put me to much inconvenience
to obey you, since I have no luggage
with me. My trunks have been sent on to
London. I deem it right to acquaint you that
I learnt your name at the Guildford bank&mdash;your
name, and nothing more," he added, observing
her start.</p>

<p>"If we ever meet again, it must be as entire
strangers," she cried, in an agitated voice. "Promise
me this, and we part friends."</p>

<p>"I promise it."</p>

<p>"On your word of honour?"</p>

<p>"On my word of honour."</p>

<p>"Enough."</p>

<p>On reaching Kingston, Colonel Delacombe
bade her a ceremonious adieu. His tall, thin
figure could be seen on the platform as the train
departed.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

<p>He was vexed at being thus defeated, but he
promised himself speedy revenge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton pursued her journey in comparative
tranquillity, and reached Waterloo-bridge
Station without further adventure.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch11">

<p>XI.</p>

<p class="small">MR. PAGE THORNTON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Taking</span> a cab, she drove at once to the
General Post Office at Charing-cross, and registered
the letter, in which she had enclosed the
bank-notes at Guildford. She smiled with satisfaction
when this was done.</p>

<p>She next told the cabman, who had waited for
her, to proceed to Silver's, in Cornhill, and there
dismissed him. At this large establishment,
where every kind of habiliment, of every size
and quality, can be had, she purchased articles

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

of wearing apparel of the best description, sufficient
to constitute a complete outfit, stating they
were required by a young gentleman who was
going out to India immediately. As she was
provided with the requisite measure, there was no
difficulty in the matter. Messrs. Silver supplied
her with all she wanted. Having paid the bill,
which was made out to Hilary St. Ives, Esq.,
she desired that it might be forwarded to him
with the goods, to the address given. Messrs.
Silver promised that her directions should be
carefully attended to, and she departed.</p>

<p>This affair occupied some time, for she had
been solicitous to choose such articles as would
best suit Hilary, and she pleased herself with
the idea of how much surprised he would be
when he received the packages. Her business
was now ended, and her mind more easy. It
would have been quite easy, if she had not

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

encountered Colonel Delacombe. But she had
his promise not to molest her, and she thought
she could prevent him from coming to Hazlemere,
at least, for the present.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was very rarely in London, and
still more rarely in the city, but, being there,
she thought she might as well look about her.</p>

<p>Countryfolk are always attracted by shops, and
she stopped to gaze at several richly-garnished
windows as she passed along Cornhill. At last,
she entered a jeweller's for the purpose of purchasing
a birthday gift for May, and had just
chosen a simple, pretty ring, set with an emerald,
when an elderly gentleman came in, and, on
beholding her, uttered an exclamation of astonishment.
Unluckily, her veil was raised at the
moment, and she could not let it fall.</p>

<p>A very gentlemanlike-looking old gentleman.
About seventy&mdash;perhaps a trifle more&mdash;but looking

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

very hearty for his years. His features had
a sardonic expression, not devoid of humour,
which lurked about his mouth, and his keen
searching grey eyes, peering from under bushy
brows, betokened great shrewdness. His round,
red cheeks were scrupulously shaven. His attire
was extremely neat; but it was the neatness of
the old school, not of the new. He wore a low-crowned
hat turned up at the sides, a chocolate-coloured
coat with a velvet collar, and a white
cravat. Though the day was particularly fine,
he was armed with an umbrella.</p>

<p>To her infinite dismay, Mrs. Sutton recognised
her mistress's father, old Mr. Page Thornton, of
Chester.</p>

<p>"God bless me! Mrs. Sutton," he exclaimed.
"Who would have thought of seeing you! How
are you? And how are they all at Hazlemere?"</p>

<p>"All quite well, thank you, Mr. Thornton. I

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

needn't ask how you are, sir. You are looking
uncommonly well."</p>

<p>"Thankee&mdash;yes&mdash;quite as well as an old fellow
can expect to be. But what are you doing in
town, madam?"</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton was very inquisitive.</p>

<p>"Why, to tell you the truth, sir, I wanted
to buy a little present for Miss May&mdash;to-morrow
is her birthday, as you are aware&mdash;and not being
able to meet with anything I liked at Guildford,
I ran up to town."</p>

<p>"Exactly my own errand. I have come here
to buy May a birthday present. Odd, ain't it?
What have you bought, ma'am?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton showed him the emerald ring.</p>

<p>"Ah! very pretty! But I must choose something
else. Give me the benefit of your taste
ma'am. You know what May would like."</p>

<p>"Anything from her grandpapa will please her,

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

sir. But I see no reason why you should not
give her a ring as well as myself."</p>

<p>"None on earth&mdash;ha! ha! I will. Girls load
their fingers with rings now-a-days. Can't have
too many&mdash;ha! ha! Help me to choose one."</p>

<p>On this hint a glittering assortment of jewelry
was placed before him, from which, with Mrs.
Sutton's aid, he selected a diamond locket, a
diamond star, a lovely sapphire ring, the prettiest
little watch and chain imaginable, with some other
ornaments, costing altogether nearly two hundred
pounds, which he very cheerfully paid.</p>

<p>He then gave directions that his grand-daughter's
name with the date, 1st May, 186&mdash;, should
be engraved inside the watch.</p>

<p>The jeweller promised that this should be done
in the course of a few hours, and asked where
he should send the things.</p>

<p>"Pack them up carefully in a little box, and

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

send them to me&mdash;Mr. Page Thornton&mdash;at the
Langham Hotel, Portland-place. The box must
be delivered into my own hands. I shall be at
dinner at half-past seven."</p>

<p>The jeweller promised faithfully that the box
should be brought to him at the Langham, at
the hour appointed.</p>

<p>"A word with you, ma'am," said the old
gentleman, taking Mrs. Sutton aside. "I'm
coming to Hazlemere to-morrow. But don't
mention it. Don't say you've seen me."</p>

<p>"I won't even say that I've been in town, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," he cried, with a knowing look.
"Run up on the sly, eh? Never mind, I won't
peach. But tell me! how does my grandson
Oswald get on? In favour with his fair cousin,
eh? You're in their secrets, I'll be sworn,
Sutton."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not, sir. Mr. Oswald and Miss

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

May are constantly together&mdash;that's all I know.
But I think&mdash;mind, I only think&mdash;my young lady
has had an offer this very morning from Sir
Charles Ilminster."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Ilminster of Boxgrove! Zounds!
she must accept <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> accept him, Mr. Thornton! You know
very little of your grand-daughter, sir, to say so."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean she <i>ought</i> to accept him.
Oswald must be thrown over. Mrs. Woodcot
will be woefully disappointed, but that can't be
helped. We must find some one else for the
poor lad. Sir Charles has a sister&mdash;a widow&mdash;young
and very handsome, I am told. <i>She</i> might
do. I'll talk it over with Mrs. Radcliffe. But
I'm keeping you here, ma'am. Where are you
going, if it's fair to ask?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton replied that she was going to the
Cannon-street Station, whereupon he offered to

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

escort her thither, and they left the shop together.
As yet, Mrs. Sutton had said nothing respecting
Hilary St. Ives; but as they walked along
in the direction of Cannon-street&mdash;after a little
debate with herself as to the prudence of alluding
to him&mdash;she told the old gentleman of the
guest they had got at Hazlemere, and under
what strange circumstances he had been brought
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornton listened to her narration with
surprise and some displeasure; but when he
learnt that Mrs. Radcliffe had invited Hilary to
remain a few days to recruit, he became redder
than ever in the face.</p>

<p>"Why ask him to stay?" he exclaimed, angrily.
"Because Mr. Radcliffe chose to play the Good
Samaritan, why should she play the fool? Who
is he? Some wretched adventurer&mdash;a strolling
player, I'll be bound."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

<p>Mrs. Sutton strove to appease him, but he
continued grumbling all the way till they reached
the gates of the station.</p>

<p>While thanking him for his escort, Mrs. Sutton
thought it well to caution him that he must know
nothing about Mr. St. Ives on his arrival at
Hazlemere on the morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton promised to be careful, and
bidding her adieu, got into a hansom-cab and
drove to the Langham Hotel.</p>

<p>As he was whirled rapidly through the crowded
streets, he could not help thinking about Mrs.
Sutton. "A very superior woman, indeed," he
said to himself, "quite a lady. Upon my soul I
can't make her out."</p>

<p>As he entered the large coffee-room of the
Langham, he observed a gentleman seated at
one of the tables, whose striking appearance at
once attracted his attention. Feeling certain he

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

knew the face, he applied to a waiter, and learnt
that the gentleman was the very person he supposed&mdash;Colonel
Delacombe. He at once marched
towards him, and the colonel, looking up from
his newspaper as he advanced, after a moment's
hesitation recognised him, and arose. Explanations
ensued, and they shook hands very cordially
together. The meeting was as agreeable
as unexpected,&mdash;particularly agreeable to the
colonel, who immediately began to make inquiries
about Mrs. Radcliffe, and appeared enchanted with
the good accounts given him of her by the old
gentleman. Mr. Thornton, who was very proud
of his daughter, assured him she was looking just
as well as ever, which the colonel was quite ready
to believe. Then the old gentleman began to
talk about his grand-daughter, and expatiated on
her beauty, but the gallant colonel would not
admit that she could be so beautiful as her mother.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

<p>"Most people think May far better-looking
than her mother," cried Mr. Thornton, "but I
own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed the colonel. "Esther
Thornton&mdash;pardon me for calling her by that
name!&mdash;was the most charming creature ever
beheld. Her daughter may equal her, but cannot
possibly surpass her. I am not going to be sentimental.
Sentiment is not in my line now. But
I assure you I was a long time in getting over
that cruel disappointment. I suffered more from
it than from any bodily wound, and I have received
a good many."</p>

<p>"I can easily believe it, colonel. I know how
much you were attached to Esther. I was obliged
to act harshly in breaking off that engagement&mdash;contrary
to my own feelings&mdash;but I did what I
conceived to be my duty to my daughter."</p>

<p>"You acted very properly, Mr. Thornton&mdash;very

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

wisely. Mr. Radcliffe has made her a
devilish deal better husband than I should
have done."</p>

<p>"Radcliffe has certainly made her an excellent
husband, and perhaps all is for the best. She
might have been a great anxiety to you. You
are aware she has had very poor health for years,
and is now a confirmed invalid&mdash;when I say
an invalid, I mean that she thinks herself one,
and lives like one. I call her a <i>malade imaginaire</i>.
And so she is; for she looks as well as ever, as
I have just told you. Run down to Hazlemere
when you have a few days to spare. Esther will
be delighted to see you, and so will Radcliffe&mdash;he
is a deuced good fellow, and not the least bit jealous&mdash;and
you will make the acquaintance of my
pretty little May. I am going there to-morrow,
and will tell them I have seen you."</p>

<p>"You will do me a great kindness, Mr. Thornton.

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

I intended to drop Mrs. Radcliffe a line to
inform her of my return, which, as I have explained,
was much sooner than I anticipated, but
you will say all that for me."</p>

<p>They then had some further friendly chat, and
as the colonel had no engagement, they agreed to
dine together at seven o'clock. Mr. Thornton was
rather fond of good cheer, and like Baron de
Brisse, piqued himself upon his skill in arranging
a menu.</p>

<p>The colonel left the matter entirely to him,
and having ordered what he hoped would turn
out to be a nice little dinner, he proposed a
short promenade, and they went forth together,
strolling down Bond-street and St. James's-street,
looking in at the Carlton, to which club Mr.
Thornton belonged, and proceeding to the Senior
United Service Club, of which the colonel was a
member, and where he announced his return.

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

During their walk, Colonel Delacombe met several
acquaintances, all of whom seemed as much
surprised as delighted to see him. The colonel
was very chatty and agreeable. If his object was
to ingratiate himself with the old gentleman, he
succeeded to a marvel.</p>

<p>The dinner was first rate&mdash;at least the colonel
said so. He had not eaten such a good dinner
since the last time he dined with Mr. Thornton,
he wouldn't say how many years ago. The old
gentleman was much flattered. They managed to
get through a bottle of perfectly-iced Clicquot,
with a slight admixture of fine old sherry, and
had just begun to test the merits of a bottle of
Laffitte, of a famous vintage, which was placed
upon the table when the cloth was drawn, when
the waiter introduced a young man charged with
a small box, which he said he was ordered to
deliver into Mr. Thornton's own hands. The old

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

gentleman said it was all right, and the messenger
withdrew.</p>

<p>After explaining what the box contained, Mr.
Thornton begged the colonel to excuse him for
a moment while he locked it up.</p>

<p>On his return he remarked, "Apropos of that
box of trinkets, I must relate an odd circumstance
that occurred to me to-day. Chancing to
be in Cornhill, quite by accident, I entered a
jeweller's shop, with the design of purchasing a
birthday gift for May, when whom should I
stumble upon but my daughter's housekeeper,
Mrs. Sutton. She had come there on the same
errand as myself. Odd, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very odd," remarked the colonel. "Did
you say Mrs. Sutton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the housekeeper's name, and a
very superior person she is&mdash;not like a housekeeper
at all&mdash;quite a lady, in fact. It appears

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

that she went over to Guildford this morning."</p>

<p>"To Guildford!" exclaimed the colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes; and not finding exactly what she wanted
for May, she came on to town, little dreaming she
would meet <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"And little dreaming that <i>I</i> should hear of
her, and learn all about her," thought the colonel,
greatly surprised.</p>

<p>Filling a bumper, he said, "Let us devote this
glass to Mrs. Radcliffe. To-morrow you will
drink your grand-daughter's health. To-day let
us drink her mother's."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure," replied Mr.
Thornton.</p>

<p>Reason was done to the toast.</p>

<p>Cheered by the generous wine, the old gentleman
remarked with a droll look, "I've a proposition
to make to you, colonel, which I hope you

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

may find agreeable. Run down with me to
Hazlemere to-morrow, and surprise Mrs. Radcliffe,
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Are you serious, sir?" asked the colonel.
"Or is this a jest? If you are in earnest, I'm
more than half inclined to take you at your word.
But all responsibility must rest with yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll ensure you a hearty welcome from Radcliffe;
that's all you need trouble yourself about.
Madame will certainly be charmed to see you.
Gad, it will be a surprise to <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"And to Mrs. Sutton as well," thought the
colonel.</p>

<p>Nothing could have pleased the colonel better,
and he was quite as much tickled by the jest
as the old gentleman was. Indeed, there was
more in it to him than to Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>Settled that they were to start for Hazlemere
at a tolerably early hour in the morning.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

<p>Their bottle of claret finished, they adjourned
to the smoking-room, where they continued to talk
of bygone days, of old friends, and of events that
had occurred during the colonel's prolonged absence.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="b1ch12">

<p>XII.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHAT MANNER MRS. SUTTON OBTAINED POSSESSION OF
THE DOCUMENTS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> consulting the time tables, Mrs. Sutton
found there was no train that would answer her
purpose before six o'clock, and having more than
an hour to spare, she repaired to the refreshment-room,
and partook of a slight repast.</p>

<p>Though quite unconscious of the danger that
threatened her on the morrow, and never dreaming
of the meeting that had taken place between
Mr. Thornton and Colonel Delacombe, she was
uneasy, and had a presentiment of coming ill.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

<p>While travelling homewards in the train, she
revolved the strange events of the day, weighing
the difficulties they were likely to give rise to,
and which she might have to encounter.</p>

<p>The train was late, and it was not far from
eight o'clock when she reached the Gomshall station.
A fly was in waiting, for she had mentioned
in the morning that she should require one
on her return.</p>

<p>The night was clear and starlight, but, as we
know, she had to pass through a district abounding
in fine timber. Where the road was overshadowed
by wide-branching trees, as it not unfrequently
was, it was profoundly dark. The fly
proceeded slowly, being drawn by a miserable
horse.</p>

<p>A courageous woman, and possessing strong
nerves, Mrs. Sutton did not feel any alarm, as
she proceeded at the slow pace we have mentioned

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

along the somewhat lonely road. She tried to
compose her mind before her re-appearance at
Hazlemere, and nothing occurred to disturb her
until she had passed the lodge of Boxgrove Park.</p>

<p>The vehicle in which she sat was crawling up
an ascent at a foot pace, when two men, whose
appearance she did not like&mdash;though she could
scarcely distinguish them through the gloom&mdash;suddenly
emerged from the side of the hedge,
where they seemed to have been lurking, and addressed
a few words in rather gruff tones to the
driver.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, the thought of the gipsies, by
whom Hilary had been robbed, crossed her. These
might be the very men&mdash;she knew the police suspected
that they were still in the neighbourhood.
The idea frightened her, for she had still a considerable
sum of money about her, and she hastily
concealed the notes about her person, leaving

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

some ten or twelve sovereigns in her portemonnaie.</p>

<p>Her alarm, however, seemed groundless. After
a few words with the driver, which, owing to her
trepidation, she could not catch, the two men went
on at a quick pace, and were soon lost to view.</p>

<p>Putting her head out of the window, she inquired
of the coachman what they had said.</p>

<p>"They asked if I came from the Gomshall
station," he replied: "and one on 'em wanted me
to give him a lift as far as Blackthorn Common,
but I refused, not much liking their looks."</p>

<p>This explanation did not altogether relieve Mrs.
Sutton's uneasiness, but nothing more happened
till they got to the edge of the common, when
the poor jade that had brought her thus far
stumbled over something on the road, and when
he got on his legs again it was evident he could go
no further.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

<p>Presently the coachman appeared at the window,
and, touching his hat, said:</p>

<p>"Sorry to tell you, ma'am, that you'll have to
get out. My horse is dead lame. Accidents will
happen, you knows, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is extremely vexatious. You
have brought a very bad horse, and I shan't
employ you again."</p>

<p>"The horse ain't a good un, I admit, ma'am.
But it warn't exactly his fault. He fell over a
great stone that seemed left in the road o' purpose."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must walk. Luckily, we're
not more than two miles from Hazlemere. Open
the door, and let me out."</p>

<p>"Shall I go with you across the common,
ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied in a decided tone, "I can
take care of myself."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

<p>She had got about half way across the common
without meeting with anything to alarm her, when
fancying she heard footsteps, she turned her head,
and, to her indescribable dismay, perceived the
two men about a bowshot off, running fleetly and
noiselessly along the turf, with the evident design
of overtaking her.</p>

<p>On seeing them she instantly started off, though
with very slight chance of escape. Terror, instead
of lending her wings, as it is said to do, on fearful
emergencies like the present, seemed to deprive
her of all strength.</p>

<p>Her pursuers gained rapidly upon her, and
called to her to stop, loudly and menacingly.</p>

<p>Finding escape impracticable, and feeling, moreover,
that she should speedily drop, she turned and
faced them.</p>

<p>By the time they came up, she had regained
her breath, and something of her courage.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

<p>"What do you want?" she cried, in as bold
a tone as she could assume. "But I needn't ask.
Your design is to rob me."</p>

<p>"No, we means you no harm, missis," replied
the foremost of the two, who was no other than
Reuben. "We have been on the look out for
you. We saw you go to the station this morning,
and managed to find out how you meant to return.
We wants to have a word with you, if you
please, missis," he added, doffing his cap, and
speaking as civilly as he could.</p>

<p>"Say on then," rejoined Mrs. Sutton, who had
now recovered her composure.</p>

<p>"Cut it short, Reuben," cried Seth Cooper,
impatiently. "Ciwility's well enough in its way,
but we arn't time for it just now. Come to the
pint. Tell Madam Sutton plainly as 'ow we
wants to make a bargain wi' her."</p>

<p>"What! you know my name?" she exclaimed.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

<p>"Ay, and we knows summat more nor your
name, missis," rejoined Seth.</p>

<p>"We also know how to hold our tongues,
missis," observed Reuben, more courteously.</p>

<p>"If you know me, I am equally aware whom
I have to deal with," said Mrs. Sutton. "You
are the two men who robbed and maltreated Mr.
Hilary St. Ives on Wootton Heath the other
night."</p>

<p>"Granted," replied Reuben. "We don't deny
the fact. We wos lucky enough to light on Mr.
St. Ives t'other night. We wos lucky enough to
get hold of his papers, and we now counts on
selling 'em to advantage."</p>

<p>"Werry walerable they is to you. Madam Sutton,
as you'll find," remarked Seth, significantly.
"Secrets is safe wi' us. But you mightn't like to
trust other folk wi' 'em. We've run great risks
in stayin' hereabouts&mdash;wi' the perlice at our 'eels&mdash;chiefly

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

on your account, and we must be compensated.
Wot are we to get for the papers?"</p>

<p>"Have you got them with you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Ay," he rejoined. "We don't trust 'em out
ov our own keeping."</p>

<p>"You shall have twelve sovereigns&mdash;all my
purse contains," she replied.</p>

<p>"That's very little," said Reuben. "Them
dockyments is worth hundreds to you, missis."</p>

<p>"Twelve suvrins!" cried Seth, scornfully. "We
can't take it. Consider the risk we've run to
sarve you, Madam Sutton. Be you sartin you've
got no more about you?"</p>

<p>"A great chance that I have so much," she
replied, now convinced that it was needless to offer
more.</p>

<p>The villains held a brief consultation together,
during which Mrs. Sutton watched them anxiously.
To her infinite relief and satisfaction she saw they
meant to comply.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

<p>Pulling out a large packet from his pouch,
Seth stepped towards her, holding it in his hand.</p>

<p>"Here's the papers," he said; "not one on 'em
a-missin', I'll take my Bible oath on it."</p>

<p>"And here's my purse," she replied, giving it to
him.</p>

<p>"Count the money, Reuben," cried Seth, handing
the purse to him.</p>

<p>"A dozen suvrins, all right," said Reuben.</p>

<p>"Then take the papers, missis," cried Seth,
delivering the packet to her, "and good luck go
wi' 'em. You've got the best o' the bargain."</p>

<p>"And now we'll wish you good night, Madam
Sutton," said Reuben. "You'll hear no more of
us. Long afore daybreak we shall be miles away
from Wootton."</p>

<p>And they flew with the swiftness of hunted
deer across the common.</p>

<p>"Now, indeed, I feel secure," cried Mrs. Sutton,
pressing the packet exultingly to her breast.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

<p>Half an hour afterwards she arrived at Hazlemere,
pale and exhausted. Naturally, her first
business was to lock up the precious packet, reserving
its examination for another season.</p>

<p>After giving such orders as were necessary, she
repaired to Hilary's room, and was glad to find
that still further improvement had taken place in
him since morning. He was in very good spirits,
and looking forward with pleasurable anticipation
to the morrow.</p>

<p>She sat with him for some little time, and
then proceeded to the boudoir, where she had a
long conversation with her mistress.</p>

<p>But she did not tell her why she went to Guildford,
nor whom she had seen there. Neither did
she explain what had subsequently befallen her.</p>

<p>XIII.</p>

<p class="small">MAY'S BIRTHDAY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> pleasant to be nineteen, as many of my
fair readers must have experienced. Especially
pleasant to a lovely girl full of health and spirit&mdash;no
cloud on her past existence, and a bright future
before her.</p>

<p>She who could now count nineteen springs
arose betimes on that bright auspicious morn&mdash;for
everything seemed to smile on her&mdash;and arraying
herself in white, descended to the housekeeper's

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

room to bid her good morrow, before
going out into the garden.</p>

<p>A very nice little parlour indeed. Tastefully
furnished, and well provided with cupboards and
store-closets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was by herself, busily occupied in
preparations for the day, but she discontinued
her task as May came in, and embracing her
with more than her usual warmth, offered her
every good wish proper to the occasion.</p>

<p>Rarely was the housekeeper so demonstrative.
Gazing fondly in May's fair face, and still holding
her in her arms, she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"How well you are looking on your birthday,
dear. Ah!" she added, vainly trying to repress
a sigh, "I wish I had a heart as light as yours.
I once had&mdash;though not at nineteen. My morn
of life was soon overcast. All good angels guard
you, dear! May you long continue as blithe and
free from care as you are now!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

<p>May was sensibly moved by the housekeeper's
evident emotion, but Mrs. Sutton speedily recovered
her usual serenity.</p>

<p>"I have a little present for you, dear," she
said. "It is of slight value, but I hope you will
accept it as a token of your old nurse's affection.
Wear this for my sake."</p>

<p>And she gave her the emerald ring.</p>

<p>Thanking her with effusion, May told her, as
she put the ring on her taper finger, that nothing
could have pleased her better than the gift, adding
that she would always wear it.</p>

<p>"Always, dear?"</p>

<p>"Always," replied May, earnestly. "And now,
dear Sutton," she continued, taking a chair, "I
have something to say to you."</p>

<p>First closing the door, the housekeeper sat
down beside her, putting on a look calculated to
invite confidence.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

<p>She understood at once the nature of the communication
about to be made to her, when May
mentioned&mdash;not without a blush&mdash;that Lady Richborough
and Sir Charles Ilminster were coming
over to Hazlemere in the course of the morning.</p>

<p>"Merely to offer you compliments and good
wishes, I presume?" observed Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I dare say they are quite ignorant
that it is my birthday."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, Sir Charles may be coming
for an answer to a certain letter which he sent
yesterday." And she added, with a smile, "A
little bird has told me all about it, you see, dear."</p>

<p>"That little bird tells you everything, Sutton."</p>

<p>"Your mamma told me this, because she knows
how much I am interested in all that concerns
you, dear. Well, what is the answer to be?
Have you made up your mind?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied May, shaking her head.

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

"That is why I desire to consult you. I know
you will give me good advice."</p>

<p>"That I will, darling&mdash;the best in my power.
The offer requires consideration."</p>

<p>"Mamma declares it requires no consideration.
I am not of her opinion."</p>

<p>"Nor I. But I mean that such an offer ought
not to be hastily rejected. Would you not like to
be Lady Ilminster?"</p>

<p>"A title does not dazzle me, Sutton."

<p>"But Sir Charles has many recommendations
besides his high position. He is a perfect gentleman&mdash;distinguished
in appearance and manner.
I saw him yesterday, and thought so. What is
your objection to him?" she asked, regarding her
fixedly.</p>

<p>"I have really no objection to make to him&mdash;except
that he does not interest me. Frankly,
Sutton, I do not think I could ever love him."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

Much relieved by this avowal, but carefully
dissembling her satisfaction, the housekeeper rejoined,
"If such is your firm determination, dear,
you will do well to decline Sir Charles's offer.
Otherwise, you will run the risk of entailing unhappiness
on yourself and on him. Mutual affection
I hold to be an indispensable ingredient in
married life."</p>

<p>"You are right, Sutton," observed May, completely
duped by her artful counsellor. "The
risk is unnecessary, since I am perfectly happy as
I am."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot but applaud your determination,
though I own I am surprised at it. Rank
has generally an irresistible attraction to our sex.
And now, since Sir Charles is disposed of, may
I venture to say a word in favour of some
one else&mdash;of one who professes to love you
dearly?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

<p>"I guess what is coming," cried May, smiling.
"But proceed."</p>

<p>"Your cousin Oswald unbosomed himself to me
as we drove to the station, and told me what you
had said to him. But I fancied on second thoughts
you might change your mind. May I console the
poor young gentleman? May I give him a
hope?"</p>

<p>May shook her head.</p>

<p>"He had his final answer yesterday," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Then I am to understand that your heart
is quite disengaged? Look me in the face, and
tell me so&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>"I can, Sutton. 'My heart is my own,' as
the song says," cried May, fixing her clear truthful
eyes upon her as she spoke. "Take this assurance
also: I will never wed any man unless I
love him."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

<p>Mrs. Sutton smiled approval, and reflected for
a moment. A favourable opportunity seemed to
have occurred for bringing up Hilary St. Ives,
and she determined not to let it slip.</p>

<p>Somewhat changing her manner, she remarked,
"Laugh, if you please, at what I am going to
say to you, dear&mdash;laugh, but listen. While I was
nursing the young gentleman who has been so
strangely placed under my care, a singular idea
occurred to me, and I have not been able to
divest myself of it since. Possibly his good looks&mdash;he
is extremely good-looking, dear&mdash;may have
prompted the notion. At any rate, it came into
my head."</p>

<p>Pleased to find her listener's curiosity excited,
she went on, after a well-calculated pause:</p>

<p>"Fate, I thought to myself, must have brought
him here for a special purpose. What can the
purpose be? The answer came immediately. He
must be destined for May."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

<p>Great was the young lady's surprise. Throwing
herself back in her chair, she laughed aloud.
"For <i>me!</i>" she exclaimed. "Did you say for
<i>me</i>, Sutton?"</p>

<p>"For you, dear," replied the housekeeper, in
no way disconcerted. "Such was the idea that
forced itself upon me. There <i>is</i> such a thing as
destiny."</p>

<p>"There may be," replied May, still laughing.
"But mine is not mixed up with that of Mr.
Hilary St. Ives."</p>

<p>With affected gravity, though she could scarcely
maintain a serious countenance, she then added,
"Are you quite sure, Sutton, that the whole
affair is not a contrivance of your own to get this
young man into the house? It looks very, very
suspicious."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> bring him here!" ejaculated the housekeeper,
petrified by the accusation. "What next?
If there has been a plot, your papa and Mr.

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

Oswald have been the chief actors in it, and I
don't think you will suspect <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"Neither do I suspect <i>you</i>, you dear, kind,
absurd creature. Don't you perceive I was only
jesting? You deserve to be laughed at for your
folly. Mamma is just as silly. She raves about
this young man's good looks. He seems to have
turned both your foolish heads. But don't say a
word more in his praise I beg of you, or I shall
positively dislike him, and I don't desire to do
that. By-the-by, is he coming down to breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. I have heard nothing to the
contrary. He wished to be called early, and
Boston has gone up to his room some time ago."</p>

<p>"That reminds me you will have to change
his room to-day, since grandpapa is coming."</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean to give him the little bachelor's
room, next to Mr. Oswald's. It looks upon the

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

garden, and will suit him to a T. Perhaps you
will assert next that I have invited him to stay,
in pursuance of my deeply-laid scheme."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, dear Sutton, for I am aware it
was mamma who asked him. Forgive me for
teazing you. You must not be cross with your
little pet on her birthday. Come with me to
the garden."</p>

<p>"Not just now," replied the housekeeper, rising,
as if with the intention of resuming her work.
"I've a great deal to do."</p>

<p>"Nay, you shall come, or I shall think you
really angry. I'll gather you the prettiest nosegay
possible in return for the ring."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton yielded. Indeed, she required
very little persuasion. So they went into the
garden together.</p>

<p>The gardens and grounds at Hazlemere were
tolerably large&mdash;large enough, at all events, to

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

require the attention of three or four gardeners,
besides extra hands. Laid out in the landscape
style by a disciple of Payne Knight, they were
extremely well kept, for Mr. Radcliffe spared no
expense upon his place. He had plenty of "glass,"
and his head-gardener, Kenneth M'Donald, a
Scotsman, as his name imported, had won no
end of prizes for grapes and pineapples. Magnificent
were the show peaches and nectarines&mdash;superb
the strawberries grown by Kenneth
M'Donald, gardener to Theobald Radcliffe, Esq.,
of Hazlemere. Our business, however, is not
with the produce of the gardens, but with the
gardens themselves, of which we must attempt to
give the reader some slight notion.</p>

<p>A broad terrace, or rather platform, artificially
raised several feet above the lawn, extended in
front of the house, and led on past arabesque parterres,
embroidered with box, and filled with

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

flowers and dwarf flowering shrubs, towards an
inclosure latticed with wire, and appropriated to
gold and silver pheasants and ring-doves. Further
on were the greenhouse and hothouses. A
splendid wistaria, a couple of fine magnolias&mdash;one
of which, a "<i>conspicua</i>," was in full flower&mdash;with
roses and jasmines, covered the walls near
the terrace.</p>

<p>A flight of stone steps led down to another
broad gravel walk which followed the course of
the terrace, and opened upon the smooth-shaven
lawn, or rather series of lawns. Near the house
the ground was level, but further on it sloped
gently down to a small but well-timbered park,
from which it was only divided by iron hurdles.
The lawns were interspersed with scattered trees,
clumps of rhododendrons, which grew to great
size, and other early flowering shrubs, with countless
beds of roses. Pleasant walks led to pleasant

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

spots, disclosing fresh beauties at every turn&mdash;a
summer-house half hidden in a bosquet&mdash;a rustic
bench beneath a spreading tree. Nothing was
neglected. A large green patch of smoothest turf,
flat as a billiard-table, served the double purpose
of a bowling-green and a ground for croquet. A
long shady walk brought you to the coppices
skirting the park. Another walk led through the
intricacies of a thicket to a sequestered glen,
abounding in heaths, ferns, and alpine plants,
and where an abundant spring, gushing forth
amid the rocks, immediately formed a rivulet.
At the end of the ravine was the miniature lake,
whence Mr. Radcliffe's residence derived its name.
Returning from this sequestered glen to the
sunshiny terrace from which we have strayed, we
shall find, on casting our eyes around, that it commands
a diversified country, wild and heathy in
parts, but generally well cultivated, covered for

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

the most part with timber, and embellished by
many a stately mansion. On the left the prospect
is bounded by the North Downs&mdash;on the right by
a lower range of chalk hills.</p>

<p>But let us confine ourselves to Hazlemere. We
need not search elsewhere for beauty. It lies
before us. Gardens and pleasure grounds alike
are charming, and could not be seen in greater
perfection than on this enchanting May morning,
when the smooth lawns are flooded with sunshine,
when the air is filled with the perfume of flowers,
and the groves are vocal with melody. The
blackbird and the speckled thrush venture near
us, plainly manifesting by their tameness how
kindly treated they are by the fair young mistress
of Hazlemere, whose natal day we celebrate.
Poets&mdash;the greatest of poets&mdash;have sung the delights
of May Day morn; but Milton himself
never hymned a May morn more exquisite.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

<p>On issuing forth upon the terrace, May and
her companion stood still to inhale the balmy
odours arising from the flower-beds, and listen to
the choristers in the groves. Both were enraptured
by the beauty of the day. May felt joyous
as the morn itself; and even Mrs. Sutton, exhilarated
by the genial influences, was able for the
moment to cast off her cares.</p>

<p>"Look, Sutton, here come my pretty pets to
bid me good morrow," cried May, as a pair of
blackbirds ran along the lawn as if to greet her.</p>

<p>Other birds followed, and after properly rewarding
the attentions of her feathered favourites,
May proceeded to gather the promised nosegay
for the housekeeper. They then descended to the
lawn, and took their way towards some distant
parterres, where M'Donald and another gardener
were engaged in filling a basket with flowers for
the decoration of the breakfast-table. The lovely
queen of the f&ecirc;te was attended in her march

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

across the velvet turf by her faithful blackbirds
and thrushes. M'Donald, a good-looking man
with a fiery-red beard, took off his cap as she
approached, and in his racy Doric, and with a
heartiness that bespoke sincerity, offered her his
best wishes on the occasion. The basket being
nearly full, he asked if he should take it to the
house. Mrs. Sutton bade him do so, giving him
at the same time some directions as to the arrangement
of the flowers. She also reminded him that
he and the under-gardener were expected at
dinner in the servants' hall, where they would
have an opportunity of drinking the health of
their young mistress.</p>

<p>Just as the gardener was departing. May inquired
if he had seen her cousin, and M'Donald
rejoined that Mr. Oswald had been there not ten
minutes ago, but had gone down towards the lake
to smoke a cigar, and give Neptune a swim.</p>

<p>M'Donald and his man then took the basket

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

and proceeded towards the house, while May and
the housekeeper walked on in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>They were chatting together near a rose-bed,
when May chanced to turn her head, and perceived
M'Donald coming back. He was supporting
a tall young man, who walked rather feebly,
and who certainly could not have got so far without
the aid of the gardener's strong arm.</p>

<p>In this young man she had no difficulty in
recognising Hilary St. Ives.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch14">

<p>XIV.</p>

<p class="small">HILARY'S STORY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary</span>, it appeared, had seen them from his
chamber window, which commanded the terrace
and lawn, and unable to resist the impulse that
prompted him to join them, hastily completed his
toilet, and made his way to the garden. When
he gained the terrace they were gone, but perceiving
them at a distance, he was moving slowly
in that direction, when M'Donald came up, and
noting his debility, at once offered him his arm.

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

Naturally, the gardener was aware of the circumstances
under which Hilary had been brought to
the house, and as they walked along he expressed
his satisfaction at the young man's recovery.
He also thought it right to communicate the fact
that it was Miss May's birthday, adding, "She is
the bonniest young leddy in all England, and as
gude and kind-hairted as she is bonnie."</p>

<p>"Why, I declare, there is Mr. St. Ives," cried
May, on seeing him.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis he, sure enough," rejoined the housekeeper.
And though secretly pleased, she added,
"How very foolish of him to venture forth in
this way. I must scold him. He quite miscalculates
his strength."</p>

<p>"Yes, he seems very feeble. Go to him, Sutton."</p>

<p>The housekeeper immediately hurried forward,
while May followed more leisurely.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

<p>As Mrs. Sutton came up, M'Donald felt that
his services were no longer needed, and, touching
his cap, he retired.</p>

<p>The housekeeper blamed her patient for coming
out without her permission, but her looks belied
her words, and showed she was not much displeased.</p>

<p>"I merely wished to pay my respects to Miss
Radcliffe," observed Hilary, in a deprecatory tone.
"May I beg you to present me to her?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton smiled graciously, and, giving him
her arm, led him towards the young lady, who had
stopped at a short distance from them.</p>

<p>As they slowly advanced, May had an opportunity
of scrutinising the young man's appearance,
and she mentally admitted that her mother's and
Mrs. Sutton's praises of his good looks were not
undeserved. He was still very pale, and evidently
suffering from the effects of the injuries he had

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

received, but this expression was calculated to
excite sympathy.</p>

<p>On his part, Hilary experienced sensations
hitherto unknown to him. Dazzled by May's
beauty, he scarcely dared to raise his eyes towards
her, and trembled at the thought of entering into
her presence. His emotion became so great that
he was obliged to halt for a moment, and May,
attributing the pause to increased debility, stepped
quickly forward, and in a few kind and sympathetic
words expressed her concern.</p>

<p>Her accents vibrated through Hilary's frame,
and made the blood rush to his heart, tending to
heighten his confusion; but her gentle looks soon
reassured him. Thanking her for the interest
she displayed in his condition, he assured her he
was better, and forced a smile to corroborate his
words. Mrs. Sutton, who watched them both narrowly,
then introduced him to the young lady,

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

and the ice being now fairly broken, he quickly
recovered his self-possession, and was able to
converse in a manner that left the anxious housekeeper
no doubt as to the impression he was likely
to produce. Decidedly May was pleased with his
manner. Nor did the interest with which he had
at first inspired her at all decrease on further acquaintance
with him. The few words in which
he besought her to accept his best wishes were
appropriate and earnest, and he was lavish in his
expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary
kindness and consideration shown him since his
arrival at Hazlemere.</p>

<p>After stating that the misadventure that had
occurred to him, combined with the loss of his
papers, had upset all his plans, he added, with
some little gallantry, that he could not regret it.
At Mrs. Sutton's suggestion they proceeded to a
rustic bench beneath a tree, where they all sat

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

down, and the discourse continued. Encouraged
by his manner, May ventured to ask him a few
questions about himself, to which he replied with
great frankness.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall sink very much in your
esteem, Miss Radcliffe, when you learn my history,"
he said; "but it is only proper you should
be made acquainted with it. Do not be startled
if I am obliged to confess that I do not know my
origin. I am not even certain that the name I
bear is my rightful one. A mystery hangs over
my birth, which I had hoped to unravel, but which
may now be never cleared up since those papers
are gone. With them I fear I have lost all
chance of penetrating the secret."</p>

<p>"Since the papers were in your own possession,
what prevented you from referring to them, and
ascertaining the secret?" inquired May.</p>

<p>"The packet was entrusted to me on the express

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

condition that it should not be opened, except in
the presence of a person whom I was to meet at a
certain place and at a certain hour in London.
With his permission&mdash;and his permission only&mdash;were
the seals to be broken. The packet is irrecoverably
lost, and the time of meeting has long
since past."</p>

<p>"And you faithfully observed your engagement?"
remarked May. "Had I been in your
place, I do not think I could have resisted the
temptation to open the packet. What say you,
Sutton?"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. St. Ives deserves great credit for
his forbearance," rejoined the housekeeper. "Few
persons would have acted so well."</p>

<p>"Having given my promise, I could not violate
it," said Hilary.</p>

<p>"But you know the name of the person whom
you were to meet in London, and though you

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

failed in the appointment, owing to unforeseen
circumstances, you can still find him?" observed
May.</p>

<p>"I am entirely unacquainted with his name or
address," replied Hilary. "The person was carefully
described to me. The place of rendezvous
was St. James's Park. Had I met him and satisfied
him, I have reason to believe that a new
career would have been opened to me, which
might have led eventually to fortune. At any
rate," he added, in a sombre tone, "I should have
learnt who I am."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause he continued:</p>

<p>"I fear you will despise me. Miss Radcliffe,
after the disclosure I have just made to you, but
I could not allow you to remain in ignorance of
my exact position, and I beg you will explain it
to Mrs. Radcliffe and your father. Say that I
am a mere nameless adventurer&mdash;I am really

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

nothing more&mdash;whom chance has brought beneath
their roof, and that I am prepared to quit it at
once, should they desire me to do so, full of gratitude
for their kindness. My history may be
summed up in a few words. Its details would
have little interest for you. That I have been
abandoned by my parents is certain&mdash;from what
causes I can only conjecture."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton, who had become deathly pale
during his recital, averted her gaze as he looked at
her.</p>

<p>"I know nothing but what has been told me.
Those who had charge of me stated that my
mother was dead, but that my father was living
and in India. However, I should never be allowed
to see him or learn his name. In other
words, I was given plainly to understand that he
would never acknowledge me."</p>

<p>"But you were not utterly abandoned?" cried

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

May, in a compassionate tone. "I will not think
so badly of human nature as to suppose so."</p>

<p>"No. In some respects I have had no reason
to complain. Money was regularly sent for my
maintenance and education, and the amount was
increased, as occasion required. Mr. and Mrs.
Courtenay, the persons with whom I was placed,
dwelt in Exeter, near the South Gate. They
were perfectly faithful to their trust. At no
time, however closely questioned, would they
reveal by whom the allowance was made. Perhaps
they were kept in ignorance themselves.</p>

<p>"The Courtenays were very respectable people,
not in a very exalted station in society, but
tolerably well to do, and strictly honest. They
had no family, and treated me with almost parental
affection. Indeed, in my earlier years I
looked upon myself as their son. I was educated
at a public school in the city. Mr. Courtenay,

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

who had my welfare at heart, wished me to take a
situation, which he would readily have procured
me. But business did not suit me. By this time
I had become acquainted with my position. Believing
myself to be a gentleman born, I determined
to do nothing inconsistent with the character
of a gentleman. I have since seen the absurdity
of my notions, and regret that I did not
follow Mr. Courtenay's advice. But I was then a
hot-headed boy. I became restless and dissatisfied,
and, not knowing what to do with me, Mr. Courtenay
supplied me with funds to go abroad; glad,
I make no doubt, to get rid of me, for with my
foolish fancies and pretensions, I must have been
a sad trouble to him.</p>

<p>"I spent three years in various parts of France&mdash;chiefly
at Toulouse, Tarascon, and other towns
near the Pyrenees, where I could live cheaply. I
ought to have mentioned that I was always fond

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

of drawing, and have some little talent in that
line, which I now began to cultivate assiduously.
I turned artist. My sketches of picturesque scenes
among the Pyrenees, with groups of peasantry,
were sufficiently admired to sell.</p>

<p>"I next proceeded to Paris, intending to establish
myself there as a professional artist, and I
might have succeeded in my design, for I had no
lack of encouragement, if my unlucky pride had
not stood in my way. I could not stoop to certain
things that are indispensable to success.</p>

<p>"Quitting Paris in disgust&mdash;disgusted with myself
I ought to say&mdash;I went to the Channel Islands,
where I lingered for some months pursuing my
avocations, and then returned to England. Resting
at Southampton for a couple of weeks, I
crossed over to Ringwood, and occupied myself
in sketching the romantic scenery in the neighbourhood
of that town.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

<p>"During this time I had communicated with
Mr. Courtenay, and he came over to Ringwood
to see me, bringing with him the all-important
packet of which I have been unluckily deprived.
He gave me the instructions which I have recapitulated
to you, and I at last promised myself a
solution of the mystery that has hitherto hung
over my birth. You know how I have been disappointed.
However, let that pass. I must finish
my tale.</p>

<p>"Being a good pedestrian, I determined to proceed
to London on foot. To accomplish this without
hindrance, I consigned my luggage and portfolios
to Mr. Courtenay. I allowed myself three
days for the walk. On the fourth day I undertook
to be in St. James's Park at the hour appointed.
You know the rest."</p>

<p>May had listened to his narration with an interest
which she did not care to dissemble. A

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

slight melancholy in the tone of his voice touched
her feelings, while the romantic cast of his countenance
harmonised with the account he gave of
himself. She seemed to understand him better
now she knew he was an artist.</p>

<p>"My pride would not allow me to make this
confession to your mother," he said; "and I therefore
returned somewhat evasive answers to her
questions. But to <i>you</i>, Miss Radcliffe, I would
not appear other than I am&mdash;a poor nameless
artist."</p>

<p>"What better can you be than an artist?" she
cried, with an enthusiasm that charmed him.
"And you will soon win a name. Do not relinquish
your career."</p>

<p>"I will not since you enjoin me to pursue it."</p>

<p>"I have no right to give you any advice," she
said, blushing deeply, and feeling she had gone
too far; "but if you possess the genius for
which I give you credit, you ought not to be

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

diverted by any consideration from the path which
is plainly pointed out to you, and which may lead
to renown. Hereafter, the misfortune that has
just occurred to you will appear as nothing."</p>

<p>"I have already said that I do not regard the
occurrence as a misfortune. How can I feel
otherwise than elated by the encouragement you
deign to give me. If I rise in my profession to
the height you have assigned me, I shall date
my success from this day."</p>

<p>The words were uttered with so much fervour,
and accompanied by a look expressing such
profound homage, that May almost involuntarily
cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton, who had listened to what had
passed, with deep but repressed emotion, now
deemed it necessary to interpose, and after a few
remarks upon the singularity of Hilary's story,
said,</p>

<p>"Excuse the liberty I am about to take in

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

putting a question, but I observe that you wear
a signet ring with a coat of arms engraved on it.
Whose are the arms?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. The ring was given me
the other day by Mr. Courtenay, but without any
explanation. He charged me to show it to the
gentleman who was to meet me in St. James's
Park, in proof of my identity."</p>

<p>May uttered an exclamation of surprise, and
asked to look at the ring. He took it off to show
it her.</p>

<p>She had just returned it to him, after a moment's
examination of the armorial bearings, when
Boston, the valet, was seen advancing towards
them. He was the bearer of some letters, three
or four of which he delivered to May, and then to
Hilary's great surprise, handed one to him.</p>

<p>"For me!" exclaimed the young man. "Impossible!
who can know that I am here?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

<p>Boston smiled. He could offer no explanation.
It was a registered letter, and with it was a small
slip of paper, which Hilary signed with a pencil,
and the valet departed.</p>

<p>The young man gazed in astonishment at the
letter. It was unquestionably addressed to himself,
in bold masculine characters&mdash;Hilary St.
Ives, Esq.&mdash;with Theobald Radcliffe, Esq., Hazlemere
House, Wootton, Surrey. His astonishment,
however, was increased in a tenfold degree,
when, after bowing to May, he opened the letter,
and perceived its contents.</p>

<p>"Bank notes!" he ejaculated, scarcely able to
credit his senses. "Bank notes to the amount of
five hundred pounds! I must surely be dreaming."</p>

<p>"No, I will answer for it you are awake," cried
May, who was almost equally surprised. "I can
see the bank notes plainly myself."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

<p>Mrs. Sutton, who had risen from her seat,
under the pretence of gathering a flower, now
returned, feigning quite as much astonishment as
the others.</p>

<p>"This letter may afford some explanation,"
cried Hilary.</p>

<p>And he read aloud as follows:</p>

<p>"The friend who watches over you has heard
of the disaster that has befallen you. Do not
be downcast. All will be well. The enclosed
remittance of five hundred pounds is made that
you may not be inconvenienced in regard to
money. You shall have more, should you require
it. You will hear again from me before long.
Meantime, a supply of wearing apparel and other
necessaries will be sent you."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard from the writer of that
letter before?" asked Mrs. Sutton, in the most
natural manner imaginable.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

<p>"Never," he replied. "I do not know the
handwriting. It is certainly not Mr. Courtenay's."</p>

<p>"You are not neglected, you see," cried May.
"What an extraordinary circumstance!"</p>

<p>"Extraordinary indeed!" echoed Hilary. "But
by no means disagreeable. I never had so much
money before."</p>

<p>They were still talking the matter over when
Boston reappeared, and informed Hilary that a
large chest had just arrived for him.</p>

<p>"Another wonder!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course it contains the wearing apparel and
other things mentioned in the letter," observed
May.</p>

<p>"No doubt," observed Mrs. Sutton. "Let the
chest be taken to the room next to Mr. Oswald's,"
she added to Boston.</p>

<p>And the valet again departed.</p>

<p>XV.</p>

<p class="small">THE SKETCH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Secretly</span> delighted with the success of her
scheme, and equally well pleased with the favourable
impression which she saw Hilary had produced
on her young lady, Mrs. Sutton declared
she could not remain out a moment longer, as she
had a great deal to do. On this hint May immediately
rose to accompany her, and Hilary rose
likewise, having first secured his letter with its
valuable contents. The housekeeper was just
about to offer him her arm when they were arrested

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

rested by the cheery voice of Oswald, who was
hastening towards them, and came up the next
moment. He was attended by Neptune, the water-spaniel,
whose dripping coat showed he had been
in the lake. Mrs. Sutton availed herself of this
opportunity to escape, and with a glance at May
hurried towards the house. Neptune bounded
towards his young mistress, and barked joyously
as if offering her a greeting. A slight feeling of
jealousy was awakened in Oswald's bosom when
he perceived Hilary. However, he nodded good
naturedly to him, but addressed himself in the
first instance to May, as in duty bound.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, fair coz," he cried. "If I
were a poet I would have prepared a sonnet for
the occasion, but as I have no talent in that line,
you must accept my good wishes clothed in the
plainest prose."</p>

<p>May thanked him, but told him she had expected

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

to find him in the garden when she first
came out.</p>

<p>"Do not suppose I have missed you," she added.
"I have been very much interested by some details
which Mr. St. Ives has been giving me of his
history. Are you aware he is an artist?"</p>

<p>"An artist!" cried Oswald, looking at the young
man with an undefinable expression. "Perhaps I
ought to have guessed it, but I really did not&mdash;an
artist, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an artist, though not a very distinguished
one," replied Hilary, bowing.</p>

<p>"You know how fond I am of drawing,
Oswald," cried May. "Mr. St. Ives must give
me a few lessons."</p>

<p>The young man said he should be charmed to
do so. "But I suspect you have very little to
learn from me, Miss Radcliffe," he added.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you are right," cried Oswald, laughing.

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

"My cousin May draws wonderfully, and
has quite a turn for caricature. She made a
sketch of me and Neptune t'other day, that is
worthy of a place in <i>Punch</i>. I have it with me,
and will show it you."</p>

<p>"I forbid you!" cried May.</p>

<p>But at an imploring look from Hilary she relented,
and the sketch was produced.</p>

<p>Very clever and very droll. Oswald was certainly
caricatured, but the likeness was unmistakable.
Neptune was admirably drawn.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" said Oswald.
"Clever, eh?"</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed Hilary. "You do not
require any instructions from me, Miss Radcliffe.
I despair of rivalling this sketch, but I will
attempt to make a companion to it, if you will
give me two or three minutes."</p>

<p>May graciously assented, curious to test his skill.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

<p>"Ah, I forgot," he exclaimed, with a look
of disappointment, "I have no materials with
me."</p>

<p>"They are easily procured," said May. "I
won't let you off. Fly, Oswald. My sketch-book
is in the drawing-room. Bring a pencil with
you."</p>

<p>A word from his fair cousin was a command
for Oswald. He ran swiftly towards the house,
and was back again almost immediately, bringing
with him the things he had been sent for.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let us see what you can do," he
cried, as he gave them to Hilary. "Ten to one
you don't equal May's performance."</p>

<p>"I should lose the wager if I took it," replied
Hilary. "I won't tax your patience too severely.
Miss Radcliffe," he added. "You can't be better
placed than you are."</p>

<p>"Pray introduce Neptune."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

<p>"And your humble servant," added Oswald.</p>

<p>Seating himself upon the bench, Hilary opened
the sketch-book, and finding a blank page, at once
set to work, with a rapidity and freedom of touch
that augured well for the successful execution of
his task. Conscious of his own power he had no
misgiving. With the quick eye of a true and
practised artist, he seized upon all May's charms
of feature and person, and transferred them with
almost photographic accuracy, and yet with a
grace that no photograph can reach, to the sheet
of paper before him. May's colour rose as she
felt his keen dark eye fixed upon her, but she did
not alter her position. Couched at her feet,
Neptune remained quiet, though looking up at her
face.</p>

<p>In an inconceivably short space of time Hilary
had completed his task. A masterly sketch. May
was reproduced to the life, in all her grace and

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

beauty. She blushed with pleasure as the sketch
was submitted to her.</p>

<p>"I have not done you justice, but that is impossible,"
observed Hilary.</p>

<p>"You have flattered me very much," rejoined
May.</p>

<p>"No such thing," cried Oswald. "The sketch
is wonderfully like. 'Pon my soul, you are a
devilish clever artist, St. Ives, that I must say.
But I bargained for a place, and you have left me
out altogether. Too bad."</p>

<p>"I will take you some other time," rejoined
Hilary, smiling.</p>

<p>"You think I should have spoiled the sketch,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I did not say so, or mean so. You will see
that I have dated the sketch. Miss Radcliffe. May
I venture to beg your acceptance of it as a trifling
memorial of the day."</p>

<p>Graciously accepted.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

<p>"I must show the sketch to mamma," cried
May. "It will enchant her. I am going to her
room. Have I permission to relate your history to
her? She will be so much interested by it."</p>

<p>"You will oblige me by doing so," replied
Hilary.</p>

<p>And she tripped off towards the house, followed
by Neptune.</p>

<p>Certain it is that Oswald had already become
jealous of the handsome young stranger, who had
somehow contrived to interest his fair cousin; but
he was very good-hearted, and tried to keep down
the feelings of dislike and distrust which he felt
rising in his breast. After all, he thought, the
young chap is only an artist. So as soon as
May was gone he put on rather a patronising
manner, and said,</p>

<p>"That sketch of Miss Radcliffe is capital. I
must have a copy of it&mdash;hang the price."</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy to copy the sketch for

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

you. But I cannot accept payment," replied
Hilary, rather haughtily.</p>

<p>"Too proud, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, not too proud," rejoined the other.
"But I am under great obligations to you, and
shall be delighted to make any little return in my
power."</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, my dear fellow," cried
Oswald, who, though very good-natured, was apt
to commit blunders. "I think I can find you a
good job."</p>

<p>"I do not require a job," rejoined the ether,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Hear what it is, before you decline it.
There's a devilish handsome woman coming here
this morning&mdash;Lady Richborough. Perhaps you
may heard of her, or seen her?"</p>

<p>Hilary shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a stunner&mdash;handsome enough to

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

take away your breath. Hasn't she a seat on
horseback?&mdash;Miss Reynolds is nothing to her.
Can't she handle a cue? I rather think so. I
played with her at billiards yesterday. Every
attitude was a study. I couldn't strike a ball, and
got knocked to pieces in no time. I think I could
get her to sit to you&mdash;or you might sketch her
off-hand, as you took my cousin May just now."</p>

<p>"Anything you wish. Command me."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I know you'll be struck of a heap
when you see her ladyship. Her brother, Sir
Charles Ilminster, wouldn't make a bad portrait,
and I dare say he'd sit, if I asked him. I will,
if you like. They were both talking about you
yesterday&mdash;wondering who you were; but I
couldn't tell them you are an artist, for I didn't
know it myself then."</p>

<p>"Don't fancy for a moment that I am ashamed
of my profession. But I don't care to obtrude it."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

<p>"Exactly. I understand. No man need be
ashamed of his profession&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;provided
it's respectable. Perhaps Sir Charles
may invite you to Boxgrove. If he does, go.
Picturesque old place. Just suit you. Lots of
artists go to see it. Maclise and Calderon went
to see it a few weeks ago. Nash has it in his
'Mansions of the Olden Time.' All in perfect
preservation. Magnificent banquet-hall, with
great carved oak screen, gallery, moulded ceiling
and pendants. Grand old oak staircase. Long
corridors filled with old family portraits&mdash;dames
and knights. Not one of the former beauties
half so lovely as Lady Richborough, though.
And for that matter, Sir Charles is better looking
than any of his ancestors. What with portraits,
carved chimney-pieces, tapestried chambers,
and antiquated furniture, you'll find a great deal
to your taste at Boxgrove, I can promise you."</p>

<p>"From what you say I make no doubt I

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

should," replied Hilary. "You give me an excellent
idea of the old place, and your description
of Lady Richborough is quite captivating."</p>

<p>"Does no justice to the original, as you'll admit
when you see her. She's a beauty&mdash;and no
mistake. But come! we must be moving towards
the house. The gong will soon sound for breakfast.
I think my aunt will make her appearance.
A very charming person&mdash;but I forget
you've seen her."</p>

<p>"I have," replied Hilary, "and I quite agree
with you. She <i>is</i> charming."</p>

<p>"Thinks herself still twenty-five&mdash;that's her
only fault," replied Oswald, laughing. "Apropos
of pictures! you'll see her portrait, by Grant, in
the dining-room. Laud it to the skies, and you'll
win her heart."</p>

<p>With this he offered his arm, and they walked
at a very leisurely pace to the house.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the terrace, Mr. Radcliffe

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

came forth, without his hat, looking very cheerful
and hearty. Shaking hands cordially with
Hilary, he congratulated him upon his recovery.</p>

<p>"He's curious to know who and what you
are," whispered Oswald. "Shall I enlighten him
as to the artistic profession?"</p>

<p>"By all means," replied the young man.</p>

<p>Oswald then imparted all he knew to his uncle,
who did not seem surprised to learn that Hilary
was an artist.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," he cried. "You could have
no better recommendation to me. A man of
talent is always welcome at Hazlemere."</p>

<p>More might have been said, but the gong
sounded, and they went in to breakfast.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch16">

<p>XVI.</p>

<p class="small">BREAKFAST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dining-room, in which breakfast was
served, was large and well-proportioned, being
designed for hospitality on a grand scale; but
Mr. Radcliffe, owing to his wife's delicate health,
only gave small dinners, never exceeding ten or
twelve. With its round table, massive sideboard,
thick Turkey carpet, folding screens, portraits
and pictures, the room had a very comfortable
air. French windows opened upon the terrace,
and a side window looked out upon the parterres

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

and walls covered with magnolias, which we have
previously described. Over the chimney-piece
hung a full-length portrait of the lady of the
house, with her then infantine daughter&mdash;the
work of an eminent artist, since elevated to the
chair of the Royal Academy. Other noticeable
pictures graced the walls, the chief among them
being a pony and a Scotch terrier of the Dandie
Dinmont breed, by Sir Edwin, a marine piece
by Stanfield, and the high altar in the church
of the Holy Apostles at Rome, by Roberts.</p>

<p>Such was the ordinary appearance of the room;
but this being an extraordinary occasion, it had
quite a floral aspect, befitting the day. Flowers
everywhere&mdash;on the chimney-piece, and on the
corners of the sideboard. Choice plants from the
greenhouse and conservatory were placed on temporary
stands. A beautifully arranged flower
vase occupied the centre of the table; and the

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

initials of the young May Queen, traced with
great skill on the snow-white cover in flowers of
various hues, produced a charming effect. The
atmosphere was warm and odorous, Mrs. Radcliffe
having ordered a fire, and enjoined that
no window should be left open.</p>

<p>May and her mother were in the room when
the gentlemen entered. For a wonder Mrs. Radcliffe
had come down thus early, more, we think,
from the desire to please Hilary, than from
regard for her lovely daughter. May was occupied
at the breakfast table, at which she always
officiated. Her mother was standing by the fire,
looking slight, delicate, graceful, carefully got
up with an eye to effect, and holding an embroidered
kerchief in her hand. Hilary's quick
eye took in at a glance the decorations of the
room, the persons within it, and the pictures.
Oswald set up a shout, and fairly clapped his

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

hands. Having first tenderly embraced his
daughter and given her his blessing, the old
gentleman began to look around, and expressed
his satisfaction at the arrangements, though he
secretly wished he could let a breath of air into
the room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hilary had advanced to Mrs.
Radcliffe, by whom he was very graciously received,
though she rallied him on his want of
candour towards her on their first meeting.</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me you are a painter,
Mr. St. Ives? What need of concealment?
Artists are my delight. I am proud to number
Sir Edwin and several others of note among my
friends."</p>

<p>Hilary excused himself as he best could,
adding that he was not worthy to be classed with
the distinguished painters she had mentioned,
being merely a tyro.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

<p>"Do not disparage yourself," said the lady,
with one of her most captivating smiles. "Your
sketch of my daughter proves you have consummate
skill. I must put your power to a severer
test."</p>

<p>"I shall never dare to try my feeble hand,
after seeing that matchless performance," he
replied, glancing at the portrait. "You have
been fortunate in finding a painter capable of
appreciating you and doing you justice. Ah! if
I could ever hope to rival that."</p>

<p>"Why should you not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is perfection, and unapproachable.
Its beauty drives me to despair."</p>

<p>"You have one requisite for success in your
profession," remarked Mrs. Radcliffe, smiling.
"You can flatter gracefully."</p>

<p>"You should see Sir William Newton's miniature
of my aunt," interposed Oswald. "That's

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

something like a portrait. It's an out-and-out
better likeness than this."</p>

<p>"That I must take leave to deny, though I
have not seen it," replied Hilary. "A miniature
may be exquisite, but it will not bear a moment's
comparison with a finished oil-painting such as
we have before us."</p>

<p>"I can take no part in this discussion as to
the relative merits of the pictures," observed Mrs.
Radcliffe, smiling. "But I am rather partial to
the miniature, I must own."</p>

<p>"It is considered Sir William's chef-d'&oelig;uvre,
and by very good judges," remarked Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I must defer to the general opinion," said
Hilary. "But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You maintain your own," observed Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Well, you shall see the miniature by-and-by,
and then you can fairly decide."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

<p>"Meantime, I must beg you to bestow a glance
on my pony and dog," cried May, joining the
group near the fire-place. "Are they not charmingly
painted?"</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Hilary was enchanted
with the picture, which was really admirable, and
was still extolling it, when Mr. Luff, the butler,
who was almost as portly as his master, and
about the same age, waddled into the room,
followed by Boston, bearing a chased silver
coffee-pot, which emitted a grateful odour, cutlets,
broiled salmon-trout, and all the et ceteras requisite
for a good breakfast.</p>

<p>Hereupon, the whole party sat down at table.
Hilary was assigned a seat between the two
ladies, and feeling now quite at ease, since full
explanation had been given, he conversed naturally
and agreeably. There was certainly a
fascination in his manner, which both mother and

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

daughter experienced in an almost equal degree.
Even Mr. Radcliffe was delighted with him.
Oswald had a keen appetite that morning&mdash;indeed,
he was a famous trencherman at all
times&mdash;and devoted himself to the cold chicken
and Montanches ham, with which Mr. Luff, who
knew his tastes, supplied him, leaving the talking
to be done by Hilary, and only now and then
putting in a word. But he began to think the
young man was getting on rather too well with
his aunt and his fair cousin, and that it behoved
him to put a stop to it, but he didn't see exactly
how the thing was to be done at the moment.
No such feelings influenced Mr. Radcliffe.
Nothing pleased him better than to see his wife
and daughter pleased. And they evidently were
so. If the truth must be told, the worthy old
gentleman, who was not insensible to the importance
of rank, was secretly much disappointed

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

that May could not make up her mind to accept
Sir Charles Ilminster. He had talked the matter
over with her quietly on the previous evening,
and had dilated on the advantages of the alliance,
which were palpable enough, as well as on Sir
Charles's merits, which were equally palpable, but
he could not induce her to alter her decision.
All he could obtain was a promise that she
would not give the baronet an absolute refusal.
Just now, when they first met, he had taken her
aside for a moment and questioned her, but her
sentiments remained unchanged.</p>

<p>He felt half disposed to be angry, but as he
gazed at her fair face, and saw how happy she
seemed, the feeling quickly vanished, and he
tried to reconcile himself to his disappointment.
He saw plainly enough that her charms had
produced an effect upon Hilary; but that May
would ever bestow a serious thought upon a poor

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

artist, however handsome and agreeable he might
be, never entered his head. So he ate his breakfast
tranquilly, and joined in the conversation
whenever opportunity offered.</p>

<p>May was of the same opinion as her father.
Not conceiving it possible she could entertain a
feeling stronger than that of common interest for
a nameless artist, she did not think it necessary
to be on her guard, or to adopt a distant manner
towards him, which might at once have crushed
his hopes, if he ventured to indulge any. Unconsciously,
therefore, she encouraged him, so
that the flame, already kindled in his bosom,
began to burn more fiercely, and, before breakfast
was over, he was desperately in love with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, who had watched him narrowly,
and was gifted with very quick powers
of observation in such matters, quite understood
the state of his feelings.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

<p>She also thought May was slightly touched;
but on this point she did not feel quite sure.</p>

<p>Before she came down-stairs, Mrs. Radcliffe
had had a brief conversation with her daughter
respecting Sir Charles, but had not&mdash;doubtless
from the best motives&mdash;attempted to dissuade her
from declining his offer.</p>

<p>Inquiring about the plans for the day, Oswald
was informed that nothing could be settled until
after the arrival of grandpapa.</p>

<p>"We must wait at home for him, of course,"
remarked May.</p>

<p>"Besides, you will have visitors, in all probability,"
observed her mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you may expect Sir Charles
and his sister at luncheon," said Oswald, innocently.
"Her ladyship told me they meant to
ride over this morning to offer their compliments
to May."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

<p>"Very kind," said the young lady, glancing at
mamma.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to see them," remarked
Mrs. Radcliffe. "I hope we may prevail upon
them to stay dinner."</p>

<p>"I don't think that at all likely, mamma," said
May.</p>

<p>"At any rate I shall ask them," observed papa.</p>

<p>Breakfast, which had been somewhat profuse,
was now nearly over. Already Mrs. Radcliffe
had began to complain of fatigue. Begging
Hilary to excuse her, she rose with the intention
of retiring to her boudoir. Oswald flew to open
the door, when who should come in but Mr.
Thornton&mdash;in his hat and great-coat, just as he
had arrived.</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment or two, to give
full effect to his appearance, chuckling inwardly
at his daughter's well-feigned surprise, and at

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

the exclamations of astonishment that rose from
the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>He then burst into a loud laugh, and called
out, "Didn't expect to see me, eh? Grandpapa
couldn't be absent on his darling May's birthday.
Where is she?&mdash;where is my child? Let her
gladden my eyes."</p>

<p>"Here I am, dearest grandpapa," cried May,
rushing towards him, and flinging her arms
round his neck. "Thank you so much for
coming to see me to-day."</p>

<p>"I couldn't keep away, I tell you, though
you didn't invite me," he rejoined, pressing his
lips to her smooth brow. "Bless you, my love!
Many, many happy returns of the day. I haven't
forgotten you," he added, giving her the box of
trinkets.</p>

<p>"Another birthday present!" exclaimed May.</p>

<p>"Only a few trifles. Look at them by-and-by."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

<p>He then advanced into the room, embraced his
daughter, who professed to be charmed by his
wholly unexpected visit, and shook hands very
cordially with Mr. Radcliffe and Oswald. He did
not pay much attention to Hilary, who had got
up to examine the pictures, and whose back was
towards him.</p>

<p>"Just in time," cried Mr. Radcliffe. "We
haven't half done breakfast, and if we had we
could begin again. Hot coffee in a minute."</p>

<p>"Let me help you off with your great-coat,
sir," said Oswald.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute!" cried Mr. Thornton, assuming
a mysterious air. "Fact is, I've brought
a friend with me."</p>

<p>"Delighted to hear it," replied Mr. Radcliffe.
"Bring him in at once. Has your friend breakfasted?"</p>

<p>"No, we left town early," replied Mr. Thornton.

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

Becoming still more mysterious, he added
to his daughter, "An old friend of yours, my
dear&mdash;an old and valued friend&mdash;has come purposely
to see you."</p>

<p>"An old friend of mine!" she exclaimed, struck
by his manner, and having a strange presentiment
of the truth. "Oh! good gracious, papa&mdash;how
could you? Why not let me know beforehand?
I can't be taken by surprise in this way.
You know how frightfully nervous I am, and the
sudden apparition of an old friend whom I didn't
expect might kill me. Don't tell me who he is&mdash;don't.
Bring him to my boudoir after you
have had breakfast. By that time I shall be
prepared."</p>

<p>"But my dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe would not listen to a word more,
but hurried away.</p>

<p>Not to the boudoir, however, but to Mrs.

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

Sutton's room. She trembled lest she should find
any one in the hall&mdash;but she did not. Where
could he be?</p>

<p>The door of the housekeeper's room was closed,
but voices could be heard within. Her presentiments
were correct. It was he. She knew his
voice. She would have taken flight instantly, if
she had had the power to move. But her strength
was gone, and she was obliged to lean against the
wall for support.</p>

<p>XVII.</p>

<p class="small">WHAT PASSED IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> many minutes before Mr. Thornton presented
himself at the dining-room door, as previously
related, he and Colonel Delacombe had
arrived at Hazlemere. Determined to carry out
his plan in his own way, the old gentleman would
not allow the servants to give any intimation of
their arrival; but directing Mr. Luff to look after
the luggage, and pay the coachman who had
driven them from the station, he begged the

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

colonel to wait for him for a few moments, and
left him.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe was standing near the door,
finishing his cigar, and wondering within himself
whether all would go off smoothly, when a livid
face appeared before him. The expression of the
face was so deadly and menacing, that a thrill of
apprehension shot through his frame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton had witnessed the arrival of the
two gentlemen from a back window that looked
upon the yard, and though filled with rage and
terror on beholding Colonel Delacombe, for whose
appearance she was unable to account, she resolved
at once to have an explanation with him.</p>

<p>The opportunity was offered her by Mr. Thornton.
With wonderful self-command under the
circumstances, she approached the unwelcome
visitor, and begged him to step into her room
for a moment. Though he would have gladly

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

avoided the interview just then, the colonel could
not refuse, but, throwing away his cigar, followed
her immediately.</p>

<p>Closing the door, she put no further constraint
upon herself, but fixing a determined look upon
him, demanded, in threatening tones:</p>

<p>"What brings you here? To come hither to
molest me is an act of madness on your part, as
you ought to feel. If there is to be war between
us, I shall not shrink from it, and be sure you
will not come off victorious. I will use all the
weapons I possess against you, and I have many,
without scruple."</p>

<p>The colonel, who was a very cool hand, did
not seem alarmed, and she proceeded yet more
fiercely.</p>

<p>"What has brought you here, I ask again?
Do you wish to expose me? Take care. I am
dangerous&mdash;more dangerous than you suspect.

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

Utter a word, and I will retaliate. Mark what I
say&mdash;retaliate. Certain papers have just fallen
into my hands, which place you completely in my
power. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Poh! poh!" cried Colonel Delacombe. "This
is mere raving, and only makes me doubt your
sanity. You ask if I have come to expose you.
Knowing nothing about you, what can I have to
expose? You ask what has brought me here.
I will tell you in a word. I have come at the
special invitation of my worthy old friend, Mr.
Thornton, simply for the pleasure of renewing
my acquaintance with his daughter, Mrs. Radcliffe,
and with no intention whatever of troubling
you. Indeed, I only accidentally learnt you were
here. Having so far satisfied you, I must beg to
put an end to this interview&mdash;entirely unsought
on my part&mdash;unless you can be content to talk
rationally and calmly. Recriminations are ridiculous.

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

I have no accusation to bring against
you. To the best of my knowledge, I never
saw you before yesterday. I then fancied&mdash;mind,
it was only fancy&mdash;that you resembled
one whom I dearly loved in former years, <i>but
whom I know to be dead</i>. I am sorry to see the
likeness has wholly disappeared, and has given
place to something totally different. I acknowledge
my mistake, and apologise for it."</p>

<p>"It is no mistake, Seymour," she rejoined, in a
more subdued tone, and with something even of
sadness. "She whom you formerly professed to
love still lives."</p>

<p>"I know better," he said, coldly. "She has
been dead these twenty years."</p>

<p>"I could easily convince you to the contrary.
But there is no need, since you are fully aware of
the fact."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, madam," said the colonel. "I

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

don't see why this discussion should be prolonged,
or to what it can possibly lead. I have given
you my positive assurance that I do not design
to meddle with you, and you may depend upon
it I will keep my word. Even if there were any
secret between you and myself&mdash;and there is none&mdash;it
would be my interest to keep it. You can,
therefore, have nothing to apprehend from me.
So far from desiring to molest you, if I can tender
you any service, I shall be delighted to do so,
and you have only to command me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton looked at him for a moment with
irrepressible tenderness, and, in spite of her efforts,
tears sprang to her eyes, but she checked her
emotion.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry on all accounts that you have
come here at this juncture," she said. "Your
presence cannot fail to produce awkward complications,
and may lead&mdash;in spite of all my care to
prevent them&mdash;to untoward consequences."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

<p>"I will leave immediately, if I find I am in
the way," he said.</p>

<p>"That would not mend matters," she rejoined.
"Undoubtedly, you are in the way&mdash;very much
in the way&mdash;but your immediate departure would
provoke remark, and excite suspicion. Since you
have come it is best you should stay. You owe
me much. I will not reproach you. I will not
threaten you more. I will not appeal to the past.
But I implore you to compassionate me&mdash;to serve
me."</p>

<p>"Since you adopt this tone, I will do anything
you require," replied the colonel, attempting to
take her hand, which she withdrew with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Promise me, then&mdash;promise me solemnly,"
she cried, "that, during your stay here, whatever
you may learn, or whomsoever you meet, you
will give no explanation that can in the remotest
degree compromise me. Above all, promise that

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

you will make no allusion to our past connection."</p>

<p>"Though for the life of me I cannot imagine
what you allude to, I promise implicit secrecy on
all points," said the colonel, lightly.</p>

<p>"There must be no trifling," said Mrs. Sutton.
"My existence hangs upon your caution. Swear
that you will not breathe a word."</p>

<p>"I swear it," replied the colonel. "Have you
anything more to say to me? Any further directions
to give?"</p>

<p>"None. Be cautious. Do not betray me or
yourself. Recollect that I am merely the housekeeper&mdash;nothing
more. You must not stay longer
here. Mr. Thornton will be looking for you. I
will go with you to the hall."</p>

<p>As they issued forth they saw a retreating
figure at the end of the passage.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" ejaculated the housekeeper, "there

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

is Mrs. Radcliffe. Can she have been here and
overheard us?"</p>

<p>"Diable! I hope not," replied the colonel.
"That would be a bad beginning."</p>

<p>When they reached the entrance hall, Mrs.
Radcliffe had disappeared.</p>

<p>She had flown up-stairs to her boudoir with a
precipitancy that perfectly electrified Annette,
who chanced to witness the performance.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch18">

<p>XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">A SECOND BREAKPAST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sutton</span> was still with the colonel when
the dining-room door opened and Mr. Thornton
came forth with Mr. Radcliffe. The latter shook
hands very heartily with his unexpected visitor,
welcomed him to Hazlemere, and told him how
delighted his wife would be to see him. Orders
were then given to Mrs. Sutton, who had resumed
her customary r&ocirc;le, to prepare a room for
the colonel, Mr. Thornton having his own room,
there was no occasion to say anything about that.

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

Further orders were given to the butler to serve
a second breakfast as quickly as possible; and
these matters being arranged, Mr. Radcliffe conducted
the colonel to the dining-room, and introduced
him to May.</p>

<p>No one else was in the room at the time. The
windows had been thrown open by Mr. Radcliffe,
and Oswald and Hilary had stepped out into the
garden.</p>

<p>May's charms surpassed any notions that the
colonel had formed of them. She was struck by
his distinguished appearance and manner, but yet
more struck by a certain resemblance which she
fancied she detected between him and Hilary.
It could scarcely be fancy, for the resemblance
seemed to increase as she saw more of him.</p>

<p>After making all the complimentary speeches
proper to the occasion, admiring the floral decorations
of the room and the table, the colonel

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

inquired, with an expression of great interest,
about mamma, and learnt that she had just retired
to her boudoir, but would be delighted to see him
after breakfast. The portrait over the chimney-piece
next invited his attention, and he was
expatiating with rapture upon its beauty, and
exclaiming, "Yes, there she is, just as I beheld
her last," when his rhapsodies were checked by
a summons to the breakfast-table from Mr.
Thornton.</p>

<p>"Sit down, colonel, pray sit down!" cried the
old gentleman. "I'm sure you must be hungry.
I am desperately so. A cup of coffee if you
please, May."</p>

<p>"Here it comes, grandpapa," she rejoined, as
a fresh supply of hot coffee, broils, tea-cakes, and
toast was brought in by the butler.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Radcliffe had been busy at the
sideboard carving cold fowl, ham, and tongue,

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

so that his guests had wherewithal to make
a good breakfast. The colonel differed from
Oswald. While satisfying his appetite, he contrived
to converse most agreeably, and May was
never more entertained than by his lively discourse.</p>

<p>They were still at the breakfast-table when
the two young men, who were smoking their
cigars on the terrace, passed rather slowly in front
of the window.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce have you got there, May?"
demanded Mr. Thornton, looking after them.</p>

<p>"Oswald's companion is Mr. Hilary St. Ives,
grandpapa," she replied.</p>

<p>"And who may Mr. St. Ives be?&mdash;what is
he?" asked the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"An artist," returned May.</p>

<p>"An artist!" echoed Mr. Thornton, with a
strong expression of contempt. "Then he has no
business here."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

<p>"Why not, dear grandpapa?" she rejoined.
"Besides, Mr. St. Ives was not invited."</p>

<p>And she then proceeded to explain how the
young man chanced to be at the house. Mr.
Thornton knew all about it, as we are aware;
but he feigned ignorance, and when May had
finished her recital, signified his disapproval, and
told Mr. Radcliffe plainly he had been far too
kind.</p>

<p>"Nay, indeed, I must defend papa, if a kind
action can require defence," cried May. "It
would have been quite inconsistent with his
character to act otherwise. If he had done so,
I should not love him half as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Humph!" exclaimed the old gentleman.
"You mean to insinuate, you pert little minx,
that grandpapa has not the common feelings of
humanity, eh? May be not. His compassion
certainly does not proceed to this extent. Possibly,

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

he might bring a wounded man home with
him&mdash;though I think he would have taken him
to an inn&mdash;but when the fellow had got well
enough to walk about and smoke a cigar, he
would have given him immediate notice to quit."</p>

<p>"All depends upon the person, dear grandpapa,"
rejoined May. "Mr. St. Ives is very
clever, and very gentlemanlike, and when you
see him, you won't wonder that mamma has
invited him to remain a few days and recruit.
He has not quite recovered yet."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be well now, if Sutton hadn't
nursed him so carefully," observed Mr. Radcliffe.
"She has done more for him than the doctor."</p>

<p>"I dare say," rejoined the old gentleman.
"But you know nothing about the young man,
except that he's an artist, and I don't approve
of his remaining in the house. I shall talk to
your wife about him presently."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

<p>"You may spare yourself the trouble, sir. You
won't produce much effect," laughed Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"From the glimpse I caught of him just now,
the young man appears to be good-looking and
gentlemanlike," observed the colonel.</p>

<p>"Remarkably so," said Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Let us go and have a look at him," cried the
old gentleman, rising. "Have you finished breakfast,
colonel?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied the other.</p>

<p>"I am sure <i>you</i> will be pleased with the young
man, colonel," remarked Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Why so, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have a reason. But see him first, and
then I'll tell it you."</p>

<p>"Since he has won the good opinion of Mrs.
Radcliffe and your daughter, I am sure to be
pleased with him," said the colonel.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

<p>The whole party then went out upon the
terrace. Colonel Delacombe was enchanted with
the prospect offered to his view. While he was
indulging in the raptures naturally called forth by
such a charming scene, Mr. Radcliffe looked about
for the young men. They had quitted the terrace.
Presently Oswald made his appearance, but he
was alone.</p>

<p>"What have you done with St. Ives?" inquired
his uncle.</p>

<p>"Left him in the summer-house sketching,"
replied the young man.</p>

<p>Oswald was then presented in due form to
Colonel Delacombe, who expressed particular pleasure
on making his acquaintance. As the young
man drew back, he remarked in a whisper to his
uncle,</p>

<p>"Very odd! Don't you perceive the likeness?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

<p>"Likeness to whom?" said his uncle, with a
droll look.</p>

<p>"Why to St. Ives, of course. Don't you perceive
it? Surprising!"</p>

<p>"Hush! not a word of that just now. I want
to see them together."</p>

<p>"Shall I bring St. Ives here?" asked Oswald.</p>

<p>"No; we'll go to the summer-house."</p>

<p>The plan, however, was defeated by Mrs.
Sutton, who brought her mistress's compliments
to Colonel Delacombe. Mrs. Radcliffe did not
feel quite strong enough to come down-stairs,
having rather over exerted herself that morning,
but would be delighted to see the colonel if he
would take the trouble to step up to her boudoir.</p>

<p>"My mistress is all impatience to see you,
sir," added the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Of course the colonel was happy to obey the
summons, and bowing his excuses to May, followed

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

the housekeeper, who waited to conduct him
to her mistress.</p>

<p>This interposition destroyed Mr. Radcliffe's
anticipated joke&mdash;at all events postponed it. So
he took Mr. Thornton to the summer-house.</p>

<p>Not for a moment did Mrs. Sutton forget her
part. The servants were moving about, and she
knew their eyes were upon her. Her demeanour
to the colonel as they went up-stairs was most
respectful. She told him a room had been prepared
for him, and that Boston, the valet, would
attend upon him.</p>

<p>But just before they reached the boudoir, she
said, in a low tone,</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself. She was there as we supposed.
But she heard nothing."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

<div class="center" id="b1ch19">

<p>XIX.</p>

<p class="small">HOW THEY MET AFTER LONG YEARS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> for the universe would Mrs. Radcliffe
have had the meeting with her old lover take
place in the presence of any other person than
the housekeeper, to whom she had confided her
heart's secret.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is come, Sutton!" she cried. "Seymour
is come! What am I to do?"</p>

<p>Scarcely able to repress her own feelings of
aversion and scorn, the housekeeper replied, that

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

whatever she might feel, she owed it to her
husband and her daughter to keep calm. There
must be no outward manifestation of emotion&mdash;no
fainting&mdash;no hysterics&mdash;no scene.</p>

<p>"There shall be nothing of the kind, I promise
you, Sutton."</p>

<p>"Treat him merely as an old friend, whom you
are rejoiced to see again. That is what you ought
to do&mdash;<i>must</i> do."</p>

<p>"I mean to do so. There shall be no display of
emotion. But I must see him alone. I dread the
first meeting. That over, I shall be myself."</p>

<p>The housekeeper objected to this very strongly,
but suffered herself to be overcome, perceiving,
probably, that Mrs. Radcliffe would have her own
way.</p>

<p>She was occupied for the next half hour in
the ungrateful, to her almost revolting, task of
preparing her mistress for the interview. Mrs.

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

Radcliffe made many alterations in her toilette,
and was scarcely satisfied in the end.</p>

<p>"How would he like to see me, do you think,
Sutton?" she asked, with the anxiety of a girl.
"Will this do?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper muttered a reply, in which
contempt was thinly veiled.</p>

<p>"Now you can bring him to me, Sutton," she
cried. "Stay! we have forgotten one thing&mdash;his
miniature!"</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked the housekeeper, sharply.</p>

<p>"Restore it to its place. I would have him
notice it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton reluctantly complied, and the
miniature was hung up again.</p>

<p>"Now do have pity upon me, there's a dear
creature, and bring him to me directly," entreated
Mrs. Radcliffe. "No one else, mind."</p>

<p>"Pity!" ejaculated the housekeeper, as she left

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

the boudoir, and could give vent to her feelings.
"Miserable woman, expect no pity from me.
When the time comes, I will have payment in
full."</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone, Mrs. Radcliffe surveyed
herself in her mirror, with the eye of an
experienced coquette, glancing at her coiffure,
and examining the minutest details of her dress.
A trifle of rouge being given to her cheek, she
thought she would do. She then seated herself
in her fauteuil in the most graceful attitude she
could assume. A flutter of excitement agitated,
her breast, as she heard his footsteps in the
passage.</p>

<p>The door opened. Mrs. Sutton ushered in the
colonel, and immediately retired, though not
without casting a bitter and vindictive look at
her mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe did not rise. With an exclamation

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

of pleasure, she extended her hand towards
him.</p>

<p>He took it, and pressed the delicate fingers to
his lips.</p>

<p>A brief interval ensued, during which both
were silent. In thought they had flown back
to former days. Both were young again. He
still retained her hand, and the thin fingers
trembled in his grasp. She became perceptibly
agitated, and her lips quivered, but, determined
not to give way, she motioned him to take a seat
opposite her, and he complied.</p>

<p>"This is indeed a pleasure to me, Seymour,"
she said, with a tenderness of expression which
she could not control. "I never expected to
behold you again."</p>

<p>"And I never expected&mdash;never intended to
return to my native country," he replied, in much
the same tone. "But circumstances have brought
me back, and my first visit is to you, Esther."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I am truly glad to see you. Accept my
congratulations upon your brilliant achievements
in India, and upon the honours you have won.
All your friends must feel proud of you. I do."</p>

<p>"If you are proud of me, Esther, I am content.
I care more for your esteem than that of any
other. I have won distinction, but I am not
happy."</p>

<p>"You ought to be happy, Seymour."</p>

<p>"You know well why I am not, Esther. You
are happy, I presume. You have a charming
daughter&mdash;a most lovely girl&mdash;your image. The
sight of her almost unmanned me."</p>

<p>"May is far lovelier than I ever was, Seymour.
I hope you like Mr. Radcliffe?"</p>

<p>"I appreciate his good qualities and his bonhomie;
but I cannot forgive him for robbing
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of this, Seymour. Not a word

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

against my husband, or you forfeit my friendship
entirely."</p>

<p>"You quite mistake me. I have not the
slightest idea of disparaging him. I am sure
Mr. Radcliffe is a pattern husband. Well, you
see I have kept my word. I have returned from
India as I went out&mdash;a bachelor. I deserve some
praise, for I might have made more than one
capital match."</p>

<p>"I cannot doubt it, Seymour," she rejoined.
"But, pardon me&mdash;you say bachelor&mdash;ought you
not rather to describe yourself as a widower?"</p>

<p>"A widower!" he exclaimed, staring at her.
"What mean you, Esther?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe made no reply, but looked down
and played with her eye-glass.</p>

<p>The colonel rose from his seat and approached
her.</p>

<p>"There is only one person on earth whom I

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

would have married, and she jilted me," he said,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"There you wrong her," replied the lady.
"She did not jilt you, Seymour, and you know it.
She was forced to give you up. Pray do not
recall that unhappy time."</p>

<p>"I would not give you an instant's pain if I
could help it, Esther. Far less do I desire to
open long-closed wounds. But you appear to
have got a notion in your head which it is
necessary I should remove."</p>

<p>"Really, Seymour, I meant nothing. It was
merely a foolish fancy of my own. Forgive me
for making the observation. I see it has disturbed
you."</p>

<p>"From any other lips than yours the remark
would have been perfectly indifferent to me,
and I should have laughed at it. But I cannot
allow you to labour under the slightest misapprehension.

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

Some mischief-maker must have hinted
this to you. By-the-by," he added, in a careless
tone, and as if changing the subject, "you
have got a very superior sort of person as housekeeper."</p>

<p>"He suspects Sutton, I perceive," thought Mrs.
Radcliffe. "I am not surprised you should be
struck with her. Most people are so. Mrs. Sutton
has lived with me nineteen years&mdash;ever since May
was born, in fact&mdash;and is invaluable to me."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked the colonel. "She
looks like a lady."</p>

<p>"I know little of her previous history, except
that she was married very young to a worthless
man, who deserted her, but fortunately died. I
have not questioned her much about her husband,
as you may suppose, for the subject is
extremely painful to her. Apparently, she has
no ties, for I never hear her speak of her relations.

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

She has devoted herself exclusively to me,
and I have the greatest confidence in her."</p>

<p>"I am sure your confidence is not misplaced.
You are most fortunate in possessing such a
treasure."</p>

<p>"She is a treasure, and I should be sorry to
lose her. She might marry very well, if she
chose. Mr. Malham, the surgeon&mdash;a most respectable
man, and very well to do&mdash;has spoken
to me about her, but she won't listen to him for
a moment. She has had too bitter an experience
of wedded life to run a second risk."</p>

<p>"The housekeeper is mistress here, that I can
see," thought the colonel. "I am glad on your
account, though sorry for poor Malham, that
Mrs. Sutton has so decided," he added, aloud.
"What a charming boudoir you have got! An
Indian life would suit you, Esther. You would
be idolised at Calcutta or Bombay. Why not

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

go back with me when I return&mdash;and I haven't
got long leave?&mdash;taking Mr. Radcliffe and May
with you, of course."</p>

<p>"How can you make such an absurd proposition?"
she exclaimed. But she did not seem
displeased, and added, with a half sigh, "I do
think my delicate health might be improved by
a few years spent in a climate like that of India."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it. Apropos of India, I see
you have got my old Bengal tiger here. The
magnificent brute who once owned that skin
might have made a meal of me. My first shot
only wounded him. He sprang upon my elephant,
who had enough to do to bear his weight,
killed my mahout, and in another instant would
have reached my howdah, if I had not despatched
him by a ball through the brain. I never shall
forget the ferocious aspect of the beast as I fired.
It was an awful moment."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

<p>"I have your letter describing the terrific encounter,
Seymour. In fact, I have all your
letters."</p>

<p>The colonel did not seem much gratified by
the information. But he made no remark.</p>

<p>"I keep them in that casket," pursued the lady.
"Look round. Do you notice anything over the
chimney-piece? Any souvenir of former days?"</p>

<p>"Ah! the miniature I gave you. That was
taken in my beaux jours. I had not a scarred
cheek and a grey moustache then."</p>

<p>"The scar improves you, Seymour, and so
does the grey moustache."</p>

<p>He then fell into raptures with the other miniature,
and was still admiring it when the door
opened, and Mr. Radcliffe came in.</p>

<p>"Sorry to interrupt your t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te," he remarked,
in an apologetic tone. "But you will
excuse me I am sure, my love."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

<p>"We have no more secrets to discuss," replied
the lady.</p>

<p>"In that case I need not hesitate. Mr. St.
Ives is without," he added, with a significant
glance at his wife. "Have I your permission to
bring him in?"</p>

<p>Charmed by the idea of witnessing the meeting,
Mrs. Radcliffe graciously assented.</p>

<p>"Come in!" cried Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>Thereupon Hilary entered the boudoir, followed
by Mr. Thornton, who was obliged to hold
a handkerchief to his mouth to stifle his merriment.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe went through his part very well,
though he had to check a strong tendency to
laughter.</p>

<p>"Allow me, colonel, to present to you our
young artist, Mr. Hilary St. Ives," he said, leading
the young man forward.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe moved politely towards him,

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

but suddenly stopped and stared at Hilary, who
looked quite as much astonished as himself.</p>

<p>Thus brought face to face, the resemblance between
them was seen to be very striking, allowing,
of course, for difference of age. Even their height
corresponded as nearly as might be, though the
colonel was a trifle the taller of the two. Naturally,
the advantages of youth were on Hilary's
side, and the palm of good looks must have been
assigned to him, but he wanted the refinement of
manner and proud military bearing that lent so
much distinction to the bronzed and scarred
soldier.</p>

<p>Half-suppressed laughter reached the colonel's
ears, warning him that he was the object of a
practical joke. He glanced at Mr. Radcliffe, as
much as to say, "I now understand why the
young fellow was brought here." He then addressed
Hilary.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

<p>"Glad to know you, Mr. St. Ives. Your
features appear familiar to me."</p>

<p>"I should think they must be," muttered Mr.
Thornton; "uncommonly familiar."</p>

<p>"I was about to make the same remark, colonel,"
said Hilary. "If it were not presumption on my
part, I would venture to observe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you have discovered a likeness," supplied
Mr. Radcliffe, laughing. "So have we all."</p>

<p>"Never saw such a likeness in all my born
days!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton, indulging in a
roar. "Excuse me, colonel&mdash;I can't help it&mdash;ha!
ha!"</p>

<p>"I won't affect to misunderstand what you
mean," said the colonel, joining in the laugh.
"You pay me a much greater compliment than
you do Mr. St. Ives."</p>

<p>"I should be proud to be thought like you,
colonel," said Hilary.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

<p>"Then make yourself easy on that score, young
man," remarked Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, who had looked on through her
eye-glass, much amused by the scene, added her
testimony to that of her father.</p>

<p>"We have provided you with a son, colonel,"
said Mr. Thornton, in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>"A son!" exclaimed the other. "My good sir,
I wish I had such a son as Mr. St. Ives. But
you know very well I have never married."</p>

<p>While making the assertion, he cast a glance at
Mrs. Radcliffe, and saw that she was smiling.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, colonel," said Hilary. "May I
venture to ask if you chance to know Mr. Courtenay
of Exeter?&mdash;or have had any correspondence
with him?"</p>

<p>"Courtenay! I know lots of Courtenays.
Major Courtenay, of the 2nd Foot, is my bosom
friend; and Captain Chichester Courtenay, of the

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

21st, is another great friend. But they are both
in India&mdash;one at Bombay, the other at Madras. I
have no acquaintance with Mr. Courtenay of
Exeter, nor have I ever corresponded with him.
Does your friend belong to the Devon family?"</p>

<p>Hilary shook his head, abashed.</p>

<p>Before any further questions could be put, an
interruption was offered by May, who came to
inform her mother that Lady Richborough and
Sir Charles had just arrived.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Radcliffe. "I didn't
expect them so soon. Well, go at once with your
papa to receive them. I will come down as soon
as I can. You will like Sir Charles," she added
to Colonel Delacombe.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," he rejoined. "I've heard of
him. He was in the &mdash;th Lancers."</p>

<p>"I will say nothing about his sister. Lady
Richborough, except that you are certain to fall

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

in love with her. Go down and see her. Mr.
Radcliffe will introduce you."</p>

<p>"Yes, come along," cried that gentleman.
"You'll find her ladyship a most charming
person."</p>

<p>"I must beg to be introduced at the same
time," said Mr. Thornton, following them.</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Radcliffe was left alone with Hilary.
What passed between them will be learnt anon.</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p class="small">A LECTURE FROM GRANDPAPA.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> every woman who can move about gracefully
in a riding-habit. Lady Richborough understood
the art to perfection, and never looked
better, or seemed more at ease than when attired
<i>en Amazone</i>. The costume was exactly adapted
to her incomparable figure. And how becoming
was the hat surmounting the chignon in which
her rich black tresses were braided.</p>

<p>While pacing to and fro on the lawn, chatting
merrily with Oswald, with the skirts of her habit

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

under her arm, and a little whip in her hand,
her charming ladyship contrived to indulge her
companion with a glimpse of a foot worthy of
Cinderella, clad in the daintiest boot imaginable.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Ilminster was likewise upon the
lawn, sauntering about by himself. He had by
no means the confident air of a hopeful suitor.
On the contrary, he looked thoughtful, and cast
many an anxious glance towards the house, and
when at last the object of his affections came
forth, a tremor passed through his frame.</p>

<p>The joyous shout raised by Lady Richborough
on sight of May, was blithely responded to by
the fair young damsel. In another moment they
had met, and embraced. The meeting was witnessed
by Colonel Delacombe and Mr. Thornton,
who had lingered behind on the terrace, and
very much delighted they both were with the
spectacle.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

<p>"Deuced fine woman, Lady Richborough!"
exclaimed the colonel. "Never saw a finer figure
in my life."</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" cried the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe followed his daughter as quickly
as he could, and cordially greeted Sir Charles.
But it did not fare so well with the baronet, as
it had done with his sister. When he advanced
to pay his devoirs to May, he was coldly received&mdash;so
much so as to attract the attention
of the spectators on the terrace. Not being in
the secret, the colonel attached little importance
to the circumstance, but Mr. Thornton was
greatly put out by it.</p>

<p>"Zounds!" he mentally ejaculated. "I suspect
the little hussy means to refuse him. Mustn't
be. Height of folly to throw away such a
chance."</p>

<p>He then proposed to the colonel that they

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

should join the party on the lawn, and proceeding
thither, they were presented in due form to
Lady Richborough and Sir Charles. Her ladyship's
charms lost nothing by nearer inspection&mdash;rather
gained. If the colonel was charmed with
her, she was not less struck by his distinguished
appearance and manner. But she had too much
tact to neglect Mr. Thornton, and quite captivated
the old gentleman by the civil things she
said to him. How could he resist such honeyed
words from lips so rosy?</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe got on very well with Sir
Charles. Habitually, as we have remarked, the
baronet was reserved and haughty, but he was
prepossessed by the colonel's manner, which was
unquestionably fascinating, and, besides, he knew
all about him. So they were speedily on very
friendly terms. Sir Charles had many friends in
India, with most of whom Colonel Delacombe

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

was acquainted, and could give him tidings of
them. So well pleased was the baronet with his
new acquaintance, that before they had been long
together, he told him he should be delighted to
see him at Boxgrove.</p>

<p>Overhearing the invitation, Lady Richborough
warmly seconded it.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will be pleased with the old
place," she said, with a look that was quite
irresistible.</p>

<p>The colonel felt sure he should, and added
that the invitation was a great deal too tempting
to be refused.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Thornton, who was resolved to
have a word with his grand-daughter before any
mischief was done, beckoned to her to follow him,
and led her away from the company.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of earshot, the old
gentleman began without preamble.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

<p>"Your papa has intimated to me that you mean
to refuse Sir Charles Ilminster. Now, my dear
child, I tell you plainly you must do nothing of
the sort. There cannot be two opinions as to
the eligibility of Sir Charles. He is quite as
good a match as you can ever expect to make.
Your union with him will place you in an excellent
social position, and will be satisfactory to
us all, while it must be conducive to your own
happiness.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me, I beg. I won't listen to
any observations. I know the silly arguments you
are about to employ. 'You can't make up your
mind'&mdash;'you don't care for him,' and so forth.
Stuff and nonsense! You cannot fail to like Sir
Charles; and as to making up your mind, since
you are incapable of deciding for yourself, we
must decide for you."</p>

<p>"But I have decided, dear grandpapa&mdash;quite
decided."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

<p>"Not in the right way. You have decided
to refuse Sir Charles. I won't allow you to
commit such folly."</p>

<p>"Really, grandpapa, you are very unreasonable.
I have no desire to marry just at present."</p>

<p>"Humph! I know better. Every girl of
nineteen wishes to be married, whatever she may
aver to the contrary. But even if you do desire
to remain single a little longer, it is your bounden
duty to accede to the wishes of your family.
Nothing, I repeat, can be more satisfactory to us
than the proposed alliance; and I, for one, shall
be woefully disappointed if it does not take place.
Your papa and mamma have not spoken to you
as strongly as they ought to have done. They
have not put the matter in the right light. They
are too indulgent by half, and I have told them
so. You appear to entertain most erroneous
notions in regard to matrimonial arrangements.
A girl has no voice in them&mdash;or ought to have

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

none. She must take the man chosen for her,
whether she likes him or not. Do you mark
that?"</p>

<p>"If you did not speak so seriously, grandpapa,
I should think you were jesting."</p>

<p>"Parents expect implicit obedience to their
will," pursued the old gentleman. "A girl's inclinations
are rarely, if ever, consulted. Still
more rarely is there any opposition on her part,
because she knows that the best has been done for
her. All important marriages are arranged on
this plan. Mamma settles them. They may be
styled 'Marriages of convenience.' What of that?
They are far better than foolish love-matches that
always end unhappily. Now, my dear child, I
trust it won't be necessary for me to say more
to ensure obedience to my injunctions. Put
aside all nonsensical feeling, and accept Sir
Charles."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

<p>"Anything in reason to please you, dear grandpapa,"
she rejoined. "But not this."</p>

<p>"You must&mdash;you <i>shall</i> accept him!" he cried,
exasperated by her refusal.</p>

<p>The old gentleman had grown so terribly red in
the face, that May feared he would have a fit of
apoplexy, and it was a great relief to her when
Lady Richborough and Oswald were seen approaching.</p>

<p>Delighted to escape from a further lecture, she
hastened to meet her ladyship.</p>

<p>"The gentlemen are gone to look at the plants
in the greenhouses," observed Lady Richborough.
"But I declined to accompany them, for I want
to have a little talk with you, May. How excessively
hot it is!"</p>

<p>"Suppose we sit down for a few minutes in
the summer-house?" said May. "You will find
it cool there."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

<p>"A delightful suggestion. You will know
where to find us if we are wanted," she remarked,
with an arch look at Oswald.</p>

<p>"Mind what I have said to you, May," cried
Mr. Thornton, as the two ladies tripped off.</p>

<p>"What has grandpapa been saying to you, my
love?" inquired her ladyship.</p>

<p>"Giving me a lecture," replied the other.
"He is a very positive old gentleman, and likes
his own way."</p>

<p>"But very fond of you, I'm sure, so you ought
to let him have it," observed Lady Richborough,
who suspected the truth.</p>

<p>"Harkee, Oswald," cried Mr. Thornton to his
grandson; "I have a question to ask you, and
I expect a straightforward answer. Have you
proposed to your fair cousin?"</p>

<p>Oswald stammered out something, but could not
deny the soft impeachment.</p>

<p>"And been rejected, eh?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

<p>Impossible to offer a contradiction.</p>

<p>"I thought as much. Your poor mother persuaded
herself that the affair was in excellent
train, and would be settled as soon as I made my
appearance, but she seems to have been out in her
calculations, or you have misled her. Never mind,
my boy, never mind. You must look elsewhere
for a wife. And you needn't look far," he observed,
with a knowing wink&mdash;"not farther than
Boxgrove."</p>

<p>"No chance there, sir," replied Oswald. "Lady
Richborough is a monstrous fine woman, but above
my mark."</p>

<p>"Poh! poh! you don't know whether you've a
chance or not till you try. Were I in your place
I wouldn't hesitate."</p>

<p>"But there's a difficulty to get over, sir, of
which you may not be aware. Her ladyship
forfeits her jointure if she marries again."</p>

<p>"S'death! that is awkward&mdash;confoundedly

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

awkward. I promised your mother I would do
something handsome for you on your marriage,
and so I will. But her highflying ladyship
couldn't live on a paltry pittance of a thousand
a year."</p>

<p>"I fear not, sir. Therefore I must give up all
idea of such a match. Besides, to confess the
truth, I can't get May out of my head."</p>

<p>"Think no more about her, I tell you. We
have other designs for May. A little flirtation
with her ladyship&mdash;if it comes to nothing&mdash;will
cure you of your foolish passion. By-the-by, you
haven't told me <i>why</i> May refused you. I thought
she liked you, and so did your mother. Has she
any other attachment?"</p>

<p>"None that I'm aware of, sir. I was fool
enough to believe she liked me. She seems to
have a sort of fancy for that young artist who
has got into the house. A forward, presuming

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

fellow, who doesn't seem to know his proper position."</p>

<p>"Then he must be taught it," rejoined the
old gentleman. "But I can't believe May would
bestow a serious thought on <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"She was a good deal taken up with him this
morning, I can tell you, sir," observed Oswald,
whose jealousy had been aroused, as we know&mdash;"more
than I ever saw her with any one before."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton.
"Then the sooner we get rid of him the better."</p>

<p>"You'll find some difficulty with my aunt, I
fear, sir," said Oswald. "She has taken an
amazing fancy to the young fellow."</p>

<p>"Has she, by Jove!" cried the old gentleman,
stopping to reflect. "More than ever necessary
he should be got out of the house without delay.
I know who will help us to do it. For some
reason that I can't exactly understand," he added.

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

with a comical look, "Colonel Delacombe seems
vexed at finding the young man here."</p>

<p>"No wonder," cried Oswald. "It must be a
bore to meet with a fellow who might pass for
one's son."</p>

<p>"A word from the colonel to your aunt will do
the business," said the old gentleman, chuckling.
"Mr. Hilary St. Ives shall soon bid adieu to
Hazlemere&mdash;that I can promise him."</p>

<p>As they gained the terrace, they met the rest
of the gentlemen coming out of the greenhouses,
with which they seemed greatly pleased. Sir
Charles was loud in his commendations of M'Donald,
and said his own head-gardener might
take a lesson from him.</p>

<p>As soon as he could find an opportunity, the
old gentleman addressed himself to the colonel,
and while he was opening his business to him.
Sir Charles inquired of Oswald what had become

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

of the ladies. On learning they were in the
summer-house, he immediately set off by himself
in that direction.</p>

<p>As yet, he had had no conversation with Mr.
Radcliffe on the subject next his heart.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch02">

<p>II.</p>

<p class="small">IN THE SUMMER-HOUSE.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, my love," cried Lady Richborough,
laying down her whip, and taking off her hat,
as they entered the summer-house, "I have a
great deal to say to you, but I scarcely know
where to begin. However, I must dash into the
thick of it, or I shall never get on. Of course
you have seen Sir Charles's letter, but I can
assure you it gives a very inadequate idea of the
dear boy's feelings, for he is desperately smitten.
I confess I don't approve of such a formal mode

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

of proceeding. An offer comes best from a man's
own lips, for then it springs straight from the
heart, and there can be no mistake about it&mdash;but
Charlie would have his own way. Ah! if I
were to repeat all the rapturous things he has
uttered about you, I should tire your patience as
much as he has tired mine. Your name has
been coupled with every endearing epithet in the
language. Sixty times in the hour is it pronounced&mdash;that
is, once in every minute."</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me," observed May.</p>

<p>"No such thing. I am trying to give you
an idea of the dear boy's condition. I have
known many a man who has been suffering from
heart complaint, but I never knew a worse case
than Charlie's. You must take pity on him, or
you will be answerable for the fatal consequences
certain to ensue."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to be the cause of Sir

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

Charles's death," replied May, smiling. "But I
have no apprehension of any such result."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," rejoined her ladyship,
"Because I feel sure you will compassionate
him. Come, now we are alone, confess that you
do love him&mdash;a very little bit. I see you do&mdash;though
you won't answer. The dear boy deserves
your love, for though he is my brother, I will
say that a better fellow does not exist. If he has
a fault I have never been able to discover it.
He is the most refined, sensitive creature possible.
A woman must be an angel to come up to
his ideal."</p>

<p>"But I am not an angel, dear Lady Richborough,"
observed May, laughing.</p>

<p>"You are in Charlie's eyes," rejoined her
ladyship. "But call me Myrtilla&mdash;just as I call
you May&mdash;for I now regard you as a sister. I
must take some credit to myself for making the

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

dear boy sensible of your merits. A hundred to
one if he would have observed you, if I had
not pointed you out, and given him my opinion
about you. But on the very first interview
those bright eyes did their business. Are you
not vain of your conquest? You ought to be."</p>

<p>"Dearest Lady Richborough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Myrtilla, my love, if you please."</p>

<p>"Well, dearest Myrtilla, I cannot allow you
to go on in this strain. I need not say how
much flattered I feel by Sir Charles's offer,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you have the slightest
idea of refusing him?" cried her ladyship, in
astonishment. "Impossible! I have a better idea
of your judgment."</p>

<p>"I really cannot make up my mind," said
May, blushing and greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you're only undecided I don't care,"

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

cried Lady Richborough, laughing. "I really
didn't expect to be called upon to plead the
dear boy's suit, because I thought the advantages
of the offer would be obvious."</p>

<p>"I have the highest opinion of Sir Charles in
every respect," said May. "But I cannot give
him my heart."</p>

<p>"Have you given it to any one else?" demanded
her ladyship.</p>

<p>"No," replied May, firmly.</p>

<p>"Then you may safely accept him. Love will
come hereafter."</p>

<p>"But would it be fair to Sir Charles to act
thus?"</p>

<p>Lady Richborough was rather puzzled by the
question, but she answered promptly,</p>

<p>"Yes, I do not think any man has a right to
expect more. Sir Charles's character must command
your respect&mdash;his devotion cannot fail to
win your love. I counsel you to accept him."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

<p>At this critical juncture, and as if he had
been expressly summoned, Sir Charles himself
stood before them.</p>

<p>Smiling at her brother, Lady Richborough
immediately arose, took up her hat and whip, and
prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Do not leave me, Myrtilla, I entreat," whispered
May.</p>

<p>"Nay, my love, you must listen to the dear
boy. A word from you will make him supremely
happy. All's right," she whispered to Sir
Charles, as she passed out. "Go in and win!"</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. RADCLIFFE GIVES HILARY ADVICE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> to return to the boudoir.</p>

<p>After begging Hilary to be seated, Mrs. Radcliffe
observed,</p>

<p>"I think I can guess what is passing in your
breast, Mr. St. Ives. You fancy you have discovered
some solution to the mystery of your
birth. I should be sorry to excite hopes that
may never be realised&mdash;at the same time I cannot
altogether discourage you. I will frankly own

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

that the interest I felt in you at first was
caused by the remarkable likeness you bear to
Colonel Delacombe. There is a miniature of the
colonel&mdash;taken when young. It might pass for
your portrait."</p>

<p>"Astonishing!" exclaimed Hilary, gazing at
the miniature. "I am fairly bewildered."</p>

<p>"I am a good deal perplexed myself," pursued
Mrs. Radcliffe; "but one thing seems tolerably
clear. Although the colonel feigned surprise on
seeing you just now, I am pretty certain he
knew you were here. I will tell you why I think
so. This morning, I understand, you have received
five hundred pounds from an unknown
friend?"</p>

<p>"Very true."</p>

<p>"You have also received a chest containing a
large supply of wearing apparel and other things.
Who could have sent the money and the chest?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

<p>"No one but Colonel Delacombe!" exclaimed
Hilary, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The colonel has only just returned from
India," said Mrs. Radcliffe. "His first inquiries
have evidently been about you. Having ascertained
that you are here&mdash;though how he obtained
the information I cannot explain&mdash;his
immediate impulse was to send you assistance.
His next was to run down and see you, which
he persuaded himself he could do with safety.
But the likeness between you&mdash;of which I suppose
he was ignorant&mdash;has betrayed him."</p>

<p>"You have divined it all," cried Hilary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe smiled at this tribute to her
perspicacity.</p>

<p>"Of course he pretends that his visit is paid
to me, but I know better," she said. "I am
not to be duped by such a shallow artifice. He
has come to see <i>you</i>, and satisfy himself, by

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

personal inspection, what you are like. That is
his object, I am convinced."</p>

<p>"I am lost in wonder at your penetration,
madam," exclaimed Hilary. "Nothing seems to
have escaped you."</p>

<p>"Another point of the last importance has
yet to be mentioned," pursued Mrs. Radcliffe.
"The arms engraved upon the signet-ring which
you wear are the colonel's."</p>

<p>"Great heavens! is it possible? I have always
been told that this ring was my father's?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe smiled and nodded her head.</p>

<p>"I must beg you to entrust that ring to me
for a time, for reasons which I will presently
explain. It will be perfectly safe with me, I
can assure you."</p>

<p>He gave it to her at once, and she locked
it up in a drawer of the table.</p>

<p>"I do not wish the colonel to see it at

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

present," she said; "and he could not fail to
do so, if you continue to wear it. And now I
must give you a few hints as to the course I
think you ought to pursue. We will suppose
our notions to be correct. Clearly, the first thing
you have to do is to ingratiate yourself with the
colonel. To succeed in this object will require
care on your part. Do not seem too curious.
Do not annoy him with any more questions.
Evidently, as I have explained, he came here to
reconnoitre. Let him take his own time, and
proceed in his own way. Do not presume in the
slightest degree on the discovery which you believe
you have made. Do not allude to the
likeness that seems to proclaim your parentage.
By proper management, you may perhaps in the
end induce him to acknowledge you. But this
desirable consummation can only be brought about
by prudence and caution. Like every one else,

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

the colonel has his peculiarities, and in order to
win his favour they must be studied."</p>

<p>"I hope to make him proud to acknowledge
me," cried Hilary.</p>

<p>"Precisely what I would have you do, and I
therefore urge you not to precipitate matters."</p>

<p>"I see the policy of the course you suggest,
madam," said Hilary, with a look of inexpressible
gratitude, "and will strive to follow it most
carefully."</p>

<p>"I will give you all the aid I can," said Mrs.
Radcliffe. "And now another word of caution.
You will be surprised when I counsel you not
to take Mrs. Sutton into your confidence. She
is the best creature living, and I have every
faith in her. But from some cause or other&mdash;I
know not what&mdash;she has conceived a strong dislike
to Colonel Delacombe, and may thwart your
plans."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

<p>"I will not neglect your counsel, madam,"
said the young man. "But I could have trusted
Mrs. Sutton with my life."</p>

<p>"Do not trust her now."</p>

<p>After a little pause she said:</p>

<p>"That you may fully comprehend the almost
maternal interest I take in you, I must let you
into a secret. Seymour Delacombe&mdash;I mean
the colonel, of course&mdash;was my first love. I was
engaged to him; but the engagement was broken
off, and I was married to Mr. Radcliffe. Now
you will understand what strange emotions were
roused in my breast when I beheld one who so
strongly resembled Seymour. Yes," she continued,
carried away by excitement, and almost
heedless what she said, "I thought what might
have been, had fate permitted, and for the moment
looked upon you as a son!"</p>

<p>Hilary started to his feet, doubting whether
he had heard aright.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

<p>But another person&mdash;the very last who ought
to have done so&mdash;heard the words. This was the
lady's husband, who chanced to enter the boudoir
at the moment.</p>

<p>However, we hasten to say that he attached
very little importance at the time to the expressions,
though he afterwards recalled them.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch04">

<p>IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE SCHEME FRUSTRATED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Seeing</span> he was in the way, and a good deal
confused, Hilary prepared to quit the room. Just
as he was going out, Mrs. Radcliffe told him she
would come down-stairs presently, and introduce
him to Sir Charles and his sister.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mr. Radcliffe, as soon as they
were alone, "you have promised more than you
are likely to perform."</p>

<p>"Why so?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I do not think it would be agreeable to

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

Colonel Delacombe that this young man should
be introduced to our friends. In fact, as things
have turned out, it is rather unlucky that he
happens to be here at this juncture; and I think
the best plan will be to get rid of him&mdash;civilly,
of course&mdash;as soon as we can."</p>

<p>"The thing is impossible, my dear," said his
wife; "I have asked him to stay."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we must make some excuse. I see
no harm in the young fellow&mdash;none whatever&mdash;and
am quite willing that he should remain&mdash;indeed,
I am sorry to send him away&mdash;but to
tell you the truth, your father objects very
strongly to him."</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe thought this argument would be
unanswerable, but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Neither to please the colonel, nor to please
papa, nor to please you, sir, can I allow Mr. St.
Ives to go," said the lady, decidedly.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

<p>"I wish you could induce him to keep his own
room then," groaned Mr. Radcliffe. "At any
rate, let me beg of you not to introduce him to
Lady Richborough and Sir Charles, or you will
place me in a very awkward position."</p>

<p>"I cannot see why you should be uneasy," remarked
the lady. "Mr. St. Ives is very gentlemanlike,
and our friends will understand that he
is an artist."</p>

<p>"But he will make the colonel look ridiculous,
my dear. Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>"No, I confess I don't see it," said the lady.</p>

<p>Very opportunely the colonel and Mr. Thornton
here entered the boudoir.</p>

<p>Thus strongly reinforced, Mr. Radcliffe ventured
to renew the attack.</p>

<p>"I've been telling my wife, colonel, that you
object to this young spark&mdash;this Hilary St. Ives,"
he said.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

<p>"I refuse to believe so unless I have it from
your own lips, colonel," observed the lady, with
one of her blandest smiles. "You have seen
nothing of him."</p>

<p>"I have seen quite enough," rejoined the
colonel. "I have no personal objection to the
young fellow, and I regret to eject him from such
comfortable quarters, but upon my soul! I think
the joke has been carried far enough. I can't
stand more of it."</p>

<p>"No joke is intended, my dear colonel. Surely,
you don't suppose so?"</p>

<p>"Everybody else will think so. If I don't," he
rejoined.</p>

<p>"I object to the fellow on other grounds,"
interposed Mr. Thornton. "A conceited puppy&mdash;and
if I didn't fear offending the colonel I
should say he presumes upon his likeness to
him."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

<p>"How extremely silly you are, papa. The
colonel will laugh at you."</p>

<p>"My dear lady," said the colonel, "I should
not care about the matter if it were confined
to your own circle&mdash;you are welcome to laugh
at me as much as you please. But I cannot be
made ridiculous in the eyes of Lady Richborough
and Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say so, my dear?" cried Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" said the lady,
with an imploring look at the colonel, which she
thought would move him. "I have asked Mr.
St. Ives to stay. I did not think his presence
would be disagreeable to you."</p>

<p>"But it is disagreeable to him," cried Mr.
Thornton&mdash;"infernally disagreeable. It is disagreeable
also to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe did not venture to make a remark.</p>

<p>"It comes to this, my dear Mrs. Radcliffe," said

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

the colonel, "that either he or I must go. Make
your choice."</p>

<p>"Nay, then, I cannot hesitate," said the lady;
"though I yield very much against my inclination."</p>

<p>"I'll go and give the young fellow his cong&eacute;,"
cried Mr. Thornton, chuckling at the notion.</p>

<p>"Spare his feelings, I entreat, papa," said Mrs
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I'll spare him."</p>

<p>"I must see him before he leaves&mdash;tell him
so."</p>

<p>"Of course, he'll come to bid you good-by."</p>

<p>The old gentleman winked at Mr. Radcliffe,
and they left the room together.</p>

<p>"I think you will be sorry for compelling me to
take this step, Seymour," observed the lady, in a
tone of reproach, as soon as they were alone.
"Have you no interest in this young man?"</p>

<p>"Interest!&mdash;none," he replied.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

<p>She shook her head sceptically.</p>

<p>"You cannot deceive me. You have defeated a
scheme which I had devised for his benefit."</p>

<p>"It is not too late to repair the error," said the
colonel. "If you have any motive for detaining
him I will take my departure."</p>

<p>"My motive was to serve you, Seymour," said
the lady.</p>

<p>"Serve me! I really cannot understand all
these innuendoes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was about to reply, when the
door opened, and Hilary entered the boudoir. His
looks showed that he was greatly hurt and
offended.</p>

<p>"After what passed between us a short time
ago, madam," he said, "and the interest you professed
to take in me, I did not expect to be thus
summarily dismissed. It is to you, sir, I presume
that I owe my dismissal?" he added to the colonel.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

<p>"You are welcome to entertain any opinion you
please, sir," rejoined the other, haughtily.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Seymour," cried the lady,
"do not treat him thus."</p>

<p>Hilary, who was evidently struggling with
violently repressed emotion, said, in a hoarse
voice, to Mrs. Radcliffe,</p>

<p>"May I speak to him?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she replied; "not now."</p>

<p>"I am de trop here, I perceive," said the
colonel. "I have the honour to wish you good
day, Mr. St. Ives."</p>

<p>"A moment, sir!" cried the young man, trying
to detain him.</p>

<p>But the colonel repulsed him with a haughty
gesture, and went out.</p>

<p>Hilary's enfeebled state did not enable him to
bear up longer. He sank on the sofa, and Mrs.
Radcliffe, alarmed by his looks, rang the bell.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

<p>As the colonel issued forth into the passage
he found Mrs. Sutton. She had evidently heard
what had just passed in the boudoir. Seizing his
arm, and fixing a threatening look upon him, she
said,</p>

<p>"I told you you ought not have come here.
You have broken the compact, and are interfering
with me. If this young man is driven
away, look to yourself."</p>

<p>"I have made no compact with you, woman.
Do as you please," rejoined the colonel. And
disengaging himself from her, strode on.</p>

<p>Just then the bell sounded, and Mrs. Sutton
entered the boudoir.</p>

<p>On seeing Hilary's condition, she cast an angry
and reproachful look at her mistress, that seemed
to imply, "This is your work."</p>

<p>"I could not help it," cried Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Don't upbraid me&mdash;but assist him."</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were plenty of restoratives

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

at hand, and some of these being applied by
the housekeeper, the young man soon regained
his consciousness.</p>

<p>But he looked ghastly pale, and was still very
feeble. He made an effort to rise, but fell back
again.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell what has come over me," he
murmured, trying to force a smile.</p>

<p>"The agitation you have just undergone has
been too much for you," said Mrs. Radcliffe.
"You must not think of leaving to-day. What
say you, Sutton?" she added, appealing to her.</p>

<p>"You are the best judge," replied the housekeeper,
coldly. "In my opinion he is not in a
fit state to move. He ought not to have left his
room at all to-day. Had he remained quiet this
would not have happened. Worse may ensue.
If he leaves the house, I will not answer for his
life."</p>

<p>"He shall not go," said Mrs. Radcliffe, alarmed.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

<p>"Pray do not give yourself any further
concern about me," said Hilary. "There is no
real danger, I am sure. This faintness will soon
pass. I cannot remain here longer."</p>

<p>"Not if I command you?" rejoined Mrs.
Radcliffe. "Have I not just said that I feel
towards you as a mother?" she added, in a low,
tender tone. "Stay for my sake. Mrs. Sutton
cannot feel for you as I do, but she will take
every care of you."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> cannot feel for him!" exclaimed the housekeeper,
with a burst of uncontrollable rage. "Oh,
this is too much!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Sutton," said Mrs. Radcliffe,
frightened. "You have done all that could be
done for him&mdash;far more than I could have done.
But&mdash;you understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand," rejoined the housekeeper.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

<p>"Are you able to move now, do you think?"
she added to the young man, who arose with her
assistance.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my strength is returning."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is well," cried Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Take him to his own room at once, Sutton.
I will come to see you presently," she added, in
her sweetest voice, to Hilary. "But keep quiet,
I beg of you, and on no account leave your own
room."</p>

<p>The young man promised compliance, and, with
a look that bespoke profound gratitude mingled
with almost filial affection, quitted the boudoir,
supported by the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe stood at the door, and watched
them as they moved slowly along the passage.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to enter a chamber
on the left, Hilary perceived her, and smiled
gratefully.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

<p>"He shall not leave, if I can prevent it,"
thought Mrs. Radcliffe, as she returned to the
boudoir. "But I really must not neglect our
guests," she added, adjusting her toilette, preparatory
to going down-stairs.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p class="small">CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, SIR CHARLES IS ACCEPTED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after leaving the summer-house, Lady
Richborough encountered Oswald, who was
coming in that direction. He told her he was
looking for her ladyship and May.</p>

<p>"Turn back with me, Mr. Woodcot," she rejoined
with an arch look. "May is in the summer-house
with Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"With Sir Charles!" echoed Oswald.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I don't think they would care for
your company. You must make up your mind

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

to lose your fair cousin. Sir Charles is resolved
to carry her off."</p>

<p>"Ah! this is the plan they have had in view,"
thought Oswald. "No wonder I have been sent
to the right-about."</p>

<p>"You can't suppose I am so blind as not to
have perceived that you are desperately enamoured
of your fair cousin," pursued her ladyship, "and I
wouldn't have allowed Sir Charles to interfere, if
I hadn't found out that May doesn't requite your
passion."</p>

<p>"Much obliged for your kind intentions in
my behalf," rejoined Oswald. "Luckily, they
are quite unnecessary, since your ladyship has
already made me perfectly indifferent to any
rivalry on the part of Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed&mdash;you surprise me. I am very
happy to learn that. The object has been achieved
quite unconsciously, I assure you."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

<p>"Not quite unconsciously, I should think,"
ventured Oswald.</p>

<p>"I should like to know how I have done it?"
she remarked.</p>

<p>"The explanation is easy enough, and yet I
have scarcely the courage to make it. When I
fell in love with May, I had not seen your ladyship."</p>

<p>"Very prettily turned, upon my word, Mr.
Woodcot," said her ladyship. "I am immensely
flattered by being preferred to your charming
cousin, but I cannot compliment you on your
taste."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I have given the best
proof possible of taste," rejoined Oswald, "though
I may be fairly taxed with inconstancy."</p>

<p>"Good again. You improve, Mr. Woodcot."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear your ladyship say so," rejoined
Oswald, rather more diffidently. "I am

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

afraid I shall sink in your esteem if I venture to
describe the effect produced upon me by your
charms."</p>

<p>Her ladyship did not seem at all displeased. She
had flirted a good deal with Oswald on the previous
day, when he had luncheoned at Boxgrove.</p>

<p>"Let us hear the state of the case," she observed,
laughing. "Are you very hard hit?"</p>

<p>"Very hard," replied Oswald.</p>

<p>"What are your symptoms?" she inquired,
with an arch look.</p>

<p>"Violent palpitations of the heart&mdash;troubled
dreams&mdash;total loss of appetite&mdash;disordered brain&mdash;suicidal
tendency."</p>

<p>"A very bad case indeed," she rejoined. "Shall
I prescribe for you?"</p>

<p>"It rests with your ladyship to save my life,"
he cried, with an impassioned look. "I am
entirely in your hands."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

<p>"Promise to attend to the prescription, or I
cannot give it," she said.</p>

<p>Promise given.</p>

<p>"Drink an extra bottle of bordeaux to-day in
honour of your fair cousin. To-morrow run up to
town for a week, and before you come back you
will have forgotten all about me. Your cure will
then be complete."</p>

<p>While rattling on in this way, her ladyship had
kept a watchful eye upon the summer-house. She
now perceived the pair come forth, and, laughing
heartily at Oswald's consternation, flew to meet
them.</p>

<p>She augured well from her brother's looks.</p>

<p>"It's all right&mdash;I see it is!" she cried, seizing
both May's hands. "Make me happy by saying
you have put the dear boy out of his misery."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I have said," replied May,
who looked pale and confused.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

<p>"Not at all surprising, my love. Girls never
do know what they say on these occasions. They
leave men to put their own construction on their
words. How do you interpret her answer,
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Most favourably," he replied. "I have reason
to believe I am accepted."</p>

<p>"Reason to believe, dear boy! That's not
enough. You must be certain."</p>

<p>"I have asked for a few hours' consideration,"
observed May.</p>

<p>"But I hope Charlie has not been foolish
enough to grant the request. Why keep the dear
boy in suspense? I would not allow a moment's
delay. It should be now or never with me. Let
me give this little hand to Charlie, and conclude
the matter."</p>

<p>May tried to withdraw her hand, but she could
not prevent Sir Charles from pressing it to his lips.</p>

<p>Before a word of protest could be uttered, Lady

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

Richborough told May, in an undertone, that she
could not now retract, and such was her ladyship's
ascendancy over the young damsel that she
felt unable to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"All is now satisfactorily concluded," cried her
ladyship, greatly elated by her successful management.
"I offer you both my heartfelt congratulations&mdash;you,
my dear Charlie&mdash;and you, sweet
sister that-is-to-be. May you both be as happy as
I would have you!"</p>

<p>Just then the gong sounded for luncheon.</p>

<p>They were preparing to obey the summons,
when Oswald, who had witnessed the scene at a
distance&mdash;with what feelings we shall not attempt
to describe&mdash;advanced towards them.</p>

<p>Lady Richborough begged him to go before
them, and announce to Mr. and Mrs. Radcliffe
that an engagement had just been concluded between
May and Sir Charles.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

<p>"I am sure you will be delighted to be the
bearer of the joyful intelligence," said her ladyship.</p>

<p>Oswald winced, but could not refuse, and, with
a sore heart, departed on his mission.</p>

<p>The others followed more slowly to the house.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch06">

<p>VI.</p>

<p class="small">HILARY LEAVES HAZLEMERE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Imagine</span> papa's and mamma's amazement&mdash;imagine
grandpapa's delight&mdash;when Oswald informed
them that May had accepted Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Many a girl, I know, has accepted the man
she meant to refuse," observed papa; "but I
didn't think May was one of that sort."</p>

<p>"Nor I," rejoined mamma, who had just come
down-stairs, and was greeted by the intelligence.
"I can't understand it."</p>

<p>"But I can," cried grandpapa, chuckling and

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

rubbing his hands gleefully. "It's all my doing.
I've brought her to her senses."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, sir," remarked Oswald,
"I should say, if May has been influenced by
anybody, it is by Lady Richborough."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," rejoined the old gentleman,
sharply. "It's my doing, I tell you."</p>

<p>The foregoing discourse took place in the hall,
where the party were assembled preparatory to
going into the dining-room to luncheon. In
another minute the newly-engaged couple came
in, accompanied by Lady Richborough, who
seemed in tip-top spirits. A scene of congratulations
ensued, which will be readily conceived.
While affectionately embracing his grand-daughter,
the old gentleman whispered in her ear,</p>

<p>"You are a dear good girl, May, and won't
regret following grandpapa's advice."</p>

<p>She made no reply. Indeed, she was almost

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

overcome, and her great desire was to be alone.
Rejoiced as he was at the resolution she had
taken, her father looked at her anxiously, and
noticed&mdash;not without misgiving&mdash;that she was
exceedingly pale. She did not go in to luncheon
with the others, but excusing herself to Lady
Richborough, hurried to her own room, and
throwing herself into a chair, gave vent to her
emotion in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>When she looked up, she perceived the housekeeper
standing before her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sutton!" she exclaimed, "I have been
very foolish&mdash;I have accepted him."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," said the housekeeper,
coldly. "Well, I congratulate you."</p>

<p>"Pity me, rather."</p>

<p>"Pity you!" cried the housekeeper, contemptuously.
"No, I can't do that. Having taken
the step, you must abide by it. I believe you

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

have chosen well. You know my opinion of
Sir Charles. Why are you not with them at
luncheon?"</p>

<p>"I could not stand it. I am going down presently.
Where is Mr. St. Ives? I did not see
him in the hall when I came in. I was glad
he was not there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton looked at her searchingly, as she
replied,</p>

<p>"I do not think you will see him again. He
has been enjoined to leave the house immediately."</p>

<p>"Enjoined to leave!" exclaimed May, indignantly.
"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By your grandpapa, but I believe at the instance
of Colonel Delacombe. I am very sorry
for it. But it cannot be helped."</p>

<p>"It must be prevented," cried May. "I will
speak to grandpapa. He will not disoblige me
so much. What does mamma say? Surely she

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

will never allow Mr. St. Ives to be sent away
thus!"</p>

<p>"What can she say, when every one is against
her&mdash;even your papa? However, there is no
use in discussing the matter. Mr. St. Ives is
much hurt at the treatment he has experienced,
and would not remain, even if requested. Unfortunately,
he is scarcely in a fit state to move,
for he has had a relapse, brought on by this
excitement."</p>

<p>"Don't let him go, Sutton."</p>

<p>"I cannot prevent him, dear."</p>

<p>"I wish I could talk to him, but that would
not be proper."</p>

<p>"I will tell him what you say," rejoined the
housekeeper. "If it produces no other effect, it
will console him."</p>

<p>And she departed on the errand.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, May left her room with
the intention of joining the party at luncheon.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

<p>In the passage, near the landing, she found
Hilary and Mrs. Sutton. Evidently they were
waiting for her coming forth. The young man
moved forward feebly to meet her.</p>

<p>"I am come to bid you farewell, Miss Radcliffe,"
he said. "You have heard why I am
leaving thus suddenly. I shall carry away with
me a grateful recollection of your kindness."</p>

<p>"I have been urging him to delay his departure,
but without effect," observed Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>"To remain longer would be impossible, after
what has occurred," observed Hilary, in a tone
that showed his resolution was taken.</p>

<p>"Farewell, then, since it must be so," rejoined
May. "It will delight me to hear of your success."</p>

<p>"I shall strive to obtain distinction," he returned,
"though I have not the incitement that
I had to work. I have just heard that you are

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

to be united to Sir Charles Ilminster. May I
be allowed to wish you all possible happiness!"</p>

<p>Thanking him by a look, May again bade him
adieu, and went down-stairs.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh that seemed to proceed from
the inmost recesses of his breast, Hilary returned
to his room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton did not go with him, her presence
being required below.</p>

<p>Hilary thought his heart would burst. All the
hopes in which he had so foolishly indulged were
crushed. The future was a blank. Worst of all,
he was stung well-nigh to madness by a sense of
wrong and injustice.</p>

<p>From this state he was roused by the entrance
of Boston, who brought him some sandwiches and
wine on a tray, which he placed on a little table
beside him.</p>

<p>"Sorry to find you've had another attack, sir,"

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

observed the valet, in a commiserating tone. "A
glass of sherry, I'm sure, will do you good. Allow
me to pour one out for you. We've just been
drinking our young lady's good health in the
servants' hall, and coupling with it the name of
the honoured gentleman with whom she is to be
united. Ah! sir, Sir Charles is a fortunate man,
and could not have made a better choice."</p>

<p>"I trust she will be happy with him," said
Hilary, raising the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>"Little doubt of it," cried Boston. "She'll
have everything she can desire&mdash;a splendid
mansion and a wealthy spouse. Boxgrove is the
finest place in this part of Surrey. You've not
seen Sir Charles, I think?&mdash;a noble-looking gentleman.
And as to the love he bears our young lady,
his groom, Kennedy, who has been dining with us
in the servants' hall, told Annette that he's awful
spoony. We shall all be sorry to lose Miss May&mdash;for
she's the life and soul of the house&mdash;but we

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

couldn't wish her a better home, or a better husband
than she's sure to get."</p>

<p>Hilary assented in a scarcely audible voice.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems delighted with the engagement,
except Mr. Oswald, and he looks rather
down in the mouth&mdash;but that's not to be wondered
at. I never saw master in greater glee than he
was at luncheon, and as to Mr. Thornton, he's
almost beside hisself. They're all going over to
Boxgrove this afternoon, as Sir Charles wishes to
show the place to Colonel Delacombe and the old
gentleman. Pity you're not able to join the party,
sir."</p>

<p>Hilary made no reply, and the valet, noticing
his increased paleness, kindly urged him to take
another glass of sherry, and try to eat a mouthful
&mdash;but the young man declined.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Radcliffe going to Boxgrove?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and her ladyship has asked Mrs.

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

Sutton to accompany my mistress; so she's going
too. The carriage is ordered immediately. That
reminds me that I may be wanted. Can I do
anything more for you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," replied Hilary.</p>

<p>And the valet departed.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Radcliffe and the
housekeeper entered the room&mdash;both arrayed for
the drive. Mrs. Radcliffe was got up with great
taste, and looked extremely well.</p>

<p>"I want to have some conversation with you,"
she said to the young man; "but I haven't time
for it now. We're all going to Boxgrove, and
shan't be back before seven o'clock in time for
dinner. You'll have all the house to yourself,
so ramble about it as you please, and do what
you like. I can't stay a minute longer. Au
revoir!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton lingered for a moment, and said,

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

in a low voice, "I am obliged to go with her. Do
nothing till my return."</p>

<p>She then followed her mistress out of the room.
All this occurred so quickly, that Hilary had
not had time to speak, but feeling that some explanation
of his intentions was due to Mrs. Radcliffe,
he arose as quickly as he could, and went
out into the passage. Too late. They were
gone.</p>

<p>Merry voices mingled with laughter, resounding
from the great staircase and from the entrance-hall,
told him that the party were just starting on
the expedition, and though he felt the sight
would give him pain, he could not resist the
impulse that prompted him to proceed to a window
which he knew commanded the principal entrance
of the house.</p>

<p>A well-appointed landau, to which a pair of
splendid bays were harnessed, was drawn up at the

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

door. This carriage was destined for the elderly
parties&mdash;though Mrs. Radcliffe would not have
liked to be included in that list&mdash;and, as soon
as they were seated, it was driven off.</p>

<p>The saddle-horses were then brought round, and
the first to mount were Lady Richborough and
May. Though dazzled by her ladyship's beauty,
Hilary was far more attracted by May, whose
slight symmetrical figure was seen to great advantage
in a riding-dress. If not so bold a rider as
her ladyship, May sat her steed with equal grace,
and looked more feminine&mdash;a special charm in
Hilary's eyes. Sir Charles was now privileged
to assist her to mount, and having performed this
enviable office, he sprang into his saddle, and they
rode off together. What would poor Hilary have
given to be by her side. He watched them as
they proceeded slowly towards the lodge-gates. It
was an aggravation of his misery to perceive that

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

May's lovely countenance had lost all trace of sadness.
She smiled complacently upon Sir Charles,
whose proud features wore an almost exulting expression.</p>

<p>Never, indeed, had the haughty baronet been
happier than at that moment. The prize was
won, when he had feared it would elude his grasp.</p>

<p>They were followed at a discreet distance by
Lady Richborough, escorted by Colonel Delacombe
and Oswald. The colonel was provided
with the best hack in Mr. Radcliffe's stables&mdash;a
thoroughbred chesnut. Not knowing his rider,
the horse began to show off. But better horseman
than Colonel Delacombe never existed, and
the skill with which he managed the fiery animal
filled Hilary with admiration. Even Lady Richborough
was struck by the colonel's horsemanship,
and complimented him upon it. He smiled.
Praise from her ladyship was praise indeed.

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

From that moment she resolved upon his conquest,
and set about the task in earnest. Oswald
was not badly mounted, and looked well enough,
but she did not bestow a thought upon him.</p>

<p>Hilary watched them, and listened to their
laughter, till they had disappeared, and the sound
of their voices could be heard no more.</p>

<p>With a sad heart he then returned to his chamber,
and surrendered himself once more to bitter
reflections.</p>

<p>He had taken leave of May for ever. She
would soon be the bride of another. He must
think of her no more. This was the sharpest
pang.</p>

<p>Next in point of intensity was the anguish
caused by Colonel Delacombe's treatment of him.
Here, however, pride and indignation came to his
relief, and allayed his mental torture.</p>

<p>The necessity for action aroused him. Writing
materials were upon the table, and taking a sheet

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

or two of paper he commenced a lengthened
letter, the composition of which occupied him
more than an hour, for he paused frequently
while engaged in the task.</p>

<p>He did not dare to read over what he had
written, but folding up the sheets, both of which
he had filled, he placed within them the bank-notes
he had received that morning, and securing
the letter and inclosure in an envelope, addressed
it to Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>Next unlocking the chest of clothes, which
had been placed in a corner of the room, and
taking from it a knapsack, sent him in lieu of
the one of which he had been plundered, he
packed up within it a couple of shirts, and a
few other necessary articles. These and a round
felt hat were all he took. His preparations
being completed, he left the room, taking the
letter with him.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

<p>On the landing of the staircase he encountered
Annette, to whom he confided the letter, requesting
her to lay it on the table in her mistress's
boudoir.</p>

<p>Annette looked very much surprised, and noticing
the knapsack, ventured to inquire if he
was about to take his departure.</p>

<p>Hilary replied in the affirmative, and putting
a small gratuity into her hand, bade her good-bye,
and descended the staircase. No one was in the
hall at the time, and he left the house without
attracting further observation.</p>

<p>Astonished at his abrupt departure, Annette did
his bidding, and took the letter to the boudoir,
twisting it about as she went, and wondering what
it contained.</p>

<p class="small">BOXGROVE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> landau was slowly ascending the lofty
and well-wooded hill on the summit of which
stands the ancient mansion of the Ilminsters,
when May and Sir Charles entered the park.</p>

<p>It was not May's first visit to Boxgrove. She
had often been there before. But somehow the
place looked different now&mdash;brighter and more
cheerful. While cantering over the smooth turf,
with Sir Charles by her side, gazing at her with
admiration, she thought she had never discerned

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

half the beauties of the park before. Perhaps the
brilliant sunshine, flooding the groves and glittering
on the vanes, gables, and bay-windows of the
stately old pile, heightened the attraction of the
prospect. A fine day will do wonders. But was
there not something at work within her gentle
breast? Was she not slightly elated by the idea
that this proud domain might soon be hers?
Certainly, as her eye ranged over the lovely scene,
the thought crossed her, and quickened her pulse.</p>

<p>Boxgrove Park boasts timber of great age and
great variety, wide-spread beeches, Druid oaks
with huge gnarled trunks, Spanish chesnuts, and
walnuts. No such walnuts to be found elsewhere.
Besides these, there are hollies in abundance
and of great size, splendid ilexes, groves
of box that clothe the steepest parts of the hill,
sombre avenues formed by black and matted
yew-trees, while rows of tall straight pines edge

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

the paths that lead through the tangled thickets.
Here the red squirrel may be seen, here the
harsh jay may be heard, and many another
bird besides. In short, Boxgrove Park is very
beautiful, and very picturesque, and so May
thought it.</p>

<p>But what chiefly delighted her was a large
herd of deer couched beneath the trees about
a hundred yards from the spot where she had
halted for a moment to gaze around. Alarmed
by the notice taken of them, the graceful animals
quickly arose, and trooped off to an adjacent
covert. May watched their movements with the
greatest interest, and loudly expressed her admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, the lovely creatures!" she exclaimed,
"how well they harmonise with the scene! No
park can be complete without deer."</p>

<p>"That is quite my opinion," observed Sir

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

Charles. "They are generally to be seen from
the house, and form a very pretty picture. I
hope you will take them under your especial
charge."</p>

<p>May thanked him with a smile.</p>

<p>"By-and-by they will know me," she said,
"and I shall not frighten them when stopping
to look at them."</p>

<p>Nothing could have delighted Sir Charles more
than this simple observation.</p>

<p>"I know you sketch," he said. "You will
find plenty of exercise for your pencil here."</p>

<p>"Yes," she rejoined, "I have already noted
one or two charming little bits that will exactly
suit me. I could spend hours among those
trees."</p>

<p>"I hope you will," he said; "and I hope I
shall be near you."</p>

<p>"That will never do. I must be alone, or I
shall not be able to sketch. I am an enthusiastic

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

admirer of old trees. Yonder aged oak is perfection.
What a grand looking tree!"</p>

<p>"You have picked out the best tree in the
park," said Sir Charles. "That oak is called
'The King of the Forest,' and is older by some
centuries than the oldest tree near it. There are
some magnificent beech-trees on the north side
of the hill behind the house that deserve your
attention."</p>

<p>"I know them well," she rejoined. "They
are perfect beauties; such broad branches, and
such clean silvery stems. I have sketched one or
two of those beech-trees. Before long, I dare
say I shall have made acquaintance with every
tree in the park."</p>

<p>"Every tree in the park is yours from this
moment," he cried.</p>

<p>"A princely gift!" she exclaimed. "But
though I dote upon trees, I cannot accept it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded. "All I have is

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

yours. Having given you my heart, the rest goes
with it."</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked so like a preux chevalier
while making this gallant speech that May thought
him superb. Homage like this is rarely paid now-a-days,
and for the best of reasons&mdash;the girl of
the period would laugh at it. With her the days
of chivalry are for ever past. She does not
understand the sentiment of devotion. Sentiment
of any kind she derides. She neither desires to
inspire a great passion, nor is capable of inspiring
it. We have utterly failed in our portraiture of
May, if she seems to bear any resemblance to a
girl of this class. Hitherto, as we have shown,
she cared very little for Sir Charles. She accepted
him without knowing exactly why she did
so&mdash;partly because she had been told most emphatically
that her union with him would be
agreeable to her family&mdash;but chiefly because she

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

yielded to the influence exercised over her by
Lady Richborough. Blame her not too severely,
fair censor. Very likely you would have acted
in the same way, if subjected to a similar ordeal.
The really surprising thing is, that she did not
fall in love with Sir Charles from the first. But
there is no accounting for tastes. After accepting
him, she repented&mdash;but it was then too
late. During the ride to Boxgrove he made
wonderful progress in her regard. She listened
to what he said with pleasure&mdash;with something
more than pleasure. Love was fluttering around
her with his golden wings, though she could not
distinguish him. At the critical moment he let
fly the dart. Touched by Sir Charles's devotion,
she now felt for the first time that she could
love him. The thoughts passing in her breast
could be read in her looks, and Sir Charles was
not mistaken in them.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

<p>They were both roused from the delicious
reverie, into which they had fallen, by light
laughter, and looking round, beheld Lady
Richborough approaching with her attendant
cavaliers.</p>

<p>For the first time Sir Charles wished his sister
away. In his present mood her high spirits were
too much for him. As soon, therefore, as she
and her companions came up, he said he should
ride on to receive Mrs. Radcliffe, and with a
look that conveyed a world of passionate regard
to May, put spurs to his steed and galloped off
towards the house. As he plunged into a grove
of trees that lay between him and the mansion.
May thought he looked like a paladin of old.</p>

<p>Reared about the middle of the sixteenth
century by Sir Alberic Ilminster, Boxgrove was
a magnificent mansion, partially castellated, with
large transom windows filled with stained glass,

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

and possessing many noble rooms, which were
fortunately allowed to remain in their pristine
state.</p>

<p>No material change had been made in the
mansion since its erection, and even the old
furniture, chairs, beds, antique mirrors, and
hangings were carefully preserved, so that it was
not merely a capital specimen of Tudor architecture,
but gave an accurate idea of the internal
decorations of a large house of the period.</p>

<p>The mansion was approached from the back
through a turreted and embattled gateway, and
over the entrance was a great stone shield,
sculptured with the arms of the family. These
were repeated on the garden gates, on the sun-dial,
on the posts of the great staircase, on the
huge chimney-piece of the hall, and were, furthermore,
emblazoned on several of the windows.</p>

<p>The hall to which we have just adverted, and

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

which was entirely undefaced by modern alteration,
with its gallery for minstrels, its long massive
oak table, its great fireplace and andirons,
recalled the days of baronial hospitality, which
Sir Alberic and many of his successors had practised.
In the hall was a full-length portrait of
the doughty old knight, in ruff, doublet, and hose,
with his favourite black hound by his side, and
a certain resemblance might be traced in his
proud features to those of his descendant.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was splendid, the ceiling
being covered with a profusion of plaster ornaments,
the wainscoting richly carved, and the
chimney-piece ornamented with pillars and terms,
and decorated with the arms of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The dining-room had also a superb chimney-piece
and richly-carved wainscot.</p>

<p>At the head of the staircase was a grand
gallery, upwards of a hundred feet in length,

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

filled with family portraits. Hence a passage led
to the state bed-chambers, one of which had been
occupied by Queen Elizabeth, and another by
James the First, and in both were preserved the
antique beds in which those sovereigns had reposed.</p>

<p>The beds were only used on state occasions,
and their once rich hangings looked dim and
faded, while the rooms themselves, hung with
arras from the looms of Flanders, had a ghostly
air.</p>

<p>All the bed-chambers, as we have intimated,
retained their original furniture. Whether any
of them were haunted we decline to state at
present, but we must own that everybody who
visited the royal apartments declared they must
be haunted, and expressed a decided disinclination
to sleep in them.</p>

<p>There was also a communication from the

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

gallery, by means of a short staircase, to a private
chapel, which was as large as many a country
church.</p>

<p>The mansion looked towards the south, and the
fa&ccedil;ade, with its splendid bay windows and richly
sculptured portal, was most imposing. A broad
terrace, with a stone balustrade, looked down
upon the lovely slopes and glades of the park,
and commanded the finest and most extensive
prospect imaginable over a lovely district. Some
magnificent cedars of Lebanon adorned the lawn.</p>

<p>In the large, old-fashioned gardens, quincunxes,
clipped trees, and alleys were to be found; but
many modern improvements had been here judiciously
introduced.</p>

<p>Not only was Boxgrove a very fine old place,
but it was extremely well kept, and this could not
have been accomplished without the large establishment
that Sir Charles Ilminster maintained.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

<p>Sir Charles had already dismounted, and stationed
himself at the foot of the broad flight of
steps leading to the entrance, when the carriage
entered the court.</p>

<p>A bell rung at the gateway brought forth a
host of servants, chief among whom was the
pompous old butler, Mr. Dancer, who, having
served in the house before Sir Charles was born,
considered himself the most important person in
the establishment, being firmly persuaded that
nothing could go on properly without him. Intelligence
of the great event of the day, which
was likely to produce such an important change
in the domestic arrangements of the house, had
already reached Boxgrove, being brought by
Kennedy, the groom, who had been sent on by
his master, and the news, though not wholly unexpected,
caused an immense sensation in the
household. Some were pleased, but the majority,

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

we regret to say, were dissatisfied. Among the
latter were the great Mr. Dancer, and Mrs.
Trapp, the housekeeper, neither of whom were
at all desirous of submitting to the dictation of a
young mistress. Mrs. Trapp, who shared with
the butler the rule of the house, did not at all
approve of the choice that Sir Charles had made.
Against the young lady's personal attractions she
had nothing to say&mdash;Miss Radcliffe was pretty,
no doubt&mdash;but her beauty was insipid, and she
could not for a moment be compared with Lady
Richborough. There was a fascinating woman&mdash;if
you please. As to her family, the less said
about them the better. She believed that Miss
Radcliffe had a grandfather, who built Hazlemere,
but she never supposed that the proud Sir Charles
Ilminster, who might have wedded an earl's sister,
would stoop to the daughter of a city merchant.
Pity old Sir Umfraville and her lamented ladyship

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

were laid in the family vault. They would
never have allowed the match.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer attempted to console her by observing
that it would certainly have been far
better for Sir Charles&mdash;more for his own happiness,
and the happiness of all connected with him&mdash;if
he would have remained a bachelor; but as
he had allowed himself to be inveigled by an
artful miss-in-her-teens, such an inexperienced girl
might be more easily managed than a woman of
twenty-five. He had always understood that Mrs.
Sutton ruled supreme at Hazlemere, and never
brooked the slightest interference on Miss Radcliffe's
part. He recommended Mrs. Trapp to
follow the example set her, which she faithfully
promised to do.</p>

<p>Their colloquy was interrupted by the loud
ringing of the bell at the gate, announcing the

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

arrival, and summoning Mr. Dancer and a host
of powdered lacqueys to the door.</p>

<p>Chasing away all signs of vexation from her
comely face, Mrs. Trapp prepared to welcome her
future mistress with a smile of delight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe and the others had just been
ushered into the hall, when May and those with
her rode into the court. Again Sir Charles was
in attendance on the perron, and assisting his
intended bride to alight, led her into the house.
No one would have supposed, from the profound
respect paid her by the butler, by Mr. Spriggs, the
valet, and the obsequious lacqueys, and the delight
manifested by Mrs. Trapp, who had already made
her appearance in the hall, and was conversing
with Mrs. Radcliffe&mdash;no one, we say, could for an
instant have imagined that the slightest objection
had been raised to Sir Charles's choice. Bows and
smiles greeted May on all sides, and certainly her

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

charming looks and extreme amiability of manner
were calculated to disarm hostility. She addressed
Mrs. Trapp most affably, and that domineering
dame began to think that she should not object
to a young mistress after all. While this was
going on, Colonel Delacombe and Mr. Thornton,
being strangers to the place, were shown round
the ancient hall by Lady Richborough, who
pointed out certain suits of armour, swords, and
bucklers, with histories attached to them, and
called their attention to the portrait of Sir Alberic.
Little time was allowed for this examination. Sir
Charles led the ladies into the dining-room, where
a cold collation was set out, and the rest of the
company followed. The collation was superfluous,
since everybody&mdash;except May&mdash;had already partaken
of luncheon; but a glass of wine was
deemed indispensable to the occasion, and Clicquot
and Ch&acirc;teau Yquem were handed round by Mr.

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

Dancer and the footmen. Looks full of kindly
meaning, and words of kindly import were directed
towards May by grandpapa&mdash;and not by him alone&mdash;as
the wine was drunk. Mrs. Sutton was present
at the time&mdash;very much to the colonel's
annoyance, for he felt that her eyes were constantly
upon him, and her ears open to everything
he said. He owed this infliction to Lady Richborough,
who, wishing to show Mrs. Sutton
especial attention, insisted upon her remaining
with the company. After a second glass of champagne
had been quaffed, the survey of the house
began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was scarcely equal to the fatiguing
task imposed upon her, but she would not
be left out, and leaning on Mrs. Sutton's arm,
went with the party. Climbing the grand old
staircase was indeed a toil, but on reaching the
gallery, she sat down, and examined the portraits

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

with her eye-glass. Mr. Radcliffe, who was standing
beside her, could not help remarking in an
undertone what a fine thing it was to be connected
with such an ancient and important family
as was here represented. The company were dispersed
about the gallery. Sir Charles and his
intended had separated themselves from the rest,
and seemed wrapped up in each other's society.
All seemed going on as smoothly and satisfactorily
as those interested in the match could desire, and
papa and grandpapa were enchanted. Unfortunately,
Mrs. Radcliffe's delight was marred by a
circumstance which we must proceed to explain.
The inconstant colonel was flirting dreadfully with
Lady Richborough. No mistake about it. There
they were seated together on a velvet-covered
bench at the further end of the gallery&mdash;not
looking at the portraits, but looking at each other,
and talking in a very animated manner. If the

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

colonel was making love, it was clear that he met
with plenty of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," observed Mr. Radcliffe,
greatly amused by what was going on, "I
shouldn't be surprised if we have another marriage
in the family."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe had no business to be jealous&mdash;but
jealous she was&mdash;and not being able to contain
herself, her angry remarks made her husband
laugh very heartily.</p>

<p>"I should have thought, my dear, you would be
pleased that the colonel and her ladyship should
make a match of it," he said.</p>

<p>"I am disgusted with the flirtation," rejoined
his wife. "Do go and put a stop to it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear," he replied, moving
away to examine the pictures.</p>

<p>Another person was likewise jealous&mdash;furiously
jealous. The day was unpropitious to Oswald.

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

During the ride to Boxgrove, her ladyship had
been entirely engrossed by the colonel, who, sooth
to say! seemed enthralled by her fascinations,
and had scarcely condescended to notice him.
Arrived at the house, she seemed quite unconscious
of his presence.</p>

<p>"Decidedly, the colonel has cut you out," remarked
Mr. Thornton to his grandson, with
affected sympathy.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't care," cried Oswald. "She is
a heartless coquette. She flirted quite as much
with me yesterday. To-morrow, it will be the
turn of somebody else."</p>

<p>"Sorry for you, notwithstanding," said the old
gentleman, with a grave countenance, though he
was chuckling internally.</p>

<p>Never for an instant was Mrs. Sutton's gaze removed
from the couple whose undisguised flirtation
caused such heartburning and jealousy. She

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

watched their looks, and, though at a distance,
seemed to divine what passed between them.</p>

<p>Oh! how she hated the fascinating Myrtilla,
and if a look would have stricken her dead, she
would have so destroyed her. It rejoiced her,
however, to feel that Mrs. Radcliffe suffered
equally; and the few remarks she made were
calculated to inflame her mistress's jealousy. She
knew how to plant the sting where it would be felt
most keenly.</p>

<p>When at length the colonel and the syren who
had charmed him arose, and marching towards
Mrs. Radcliffe, inquired "how she liked the pictures?"
she had become so agitated that she could
scarcely make an intelligible reply. But the
colonel did not notice her reproachful look, neither
did he appear to trouble himself about Mrs.
Sutton.</p>

<p>Very little attention, we are sorry to say, was

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

paid to the portraits, and the celebrated beauties,
proud cavaliers, and gallant gentlemen, ranged
along the walls, had never been so shamefully
neglected before. The living beauties were the
sole objects of attraction&mdash;with two, at least, of
the party. Sir Charles had eyes only for May&mdash;and
the infatuated colonel thought Lady Richborough
far more charming than Barbara Lady
Ilminster, who bloomed in the days of George I.,
or than the rather d&eacute;collet&eacute; dame who had been
admired by James II. when Duke of York,
though both were accounted the loveliest women
of their time.</p>

<p>Taking Oswald's arm, Mr. Thornton desired
him to point out the best portraits. But the
wretched young man proved a very indifferent
cicerone. He was always either glancing towards
May and Sir Charles, or trying to catch some of
the colonel's gallant observations to her ladyship.

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

Generally speaking, much to their credit, the
Ilminsters had chosen fair women as their consorts.
But there was one notable exception&mdash;a great
heiress, but not a great beauty. And this lady,
the bewildered Oswald informed his grandfather,
was the gem of the collection. The old gentleman
thought he was joking&mdash;but Oswald persisted,
till he found out his mistake. It was a
relief to the poor fellow when a move was made
to the royal bed-chambers, for he then managed
to escape from the thraldom in which he had been
kept by the old gentleman, but he vainly tried to
get a word from Lady Richborough. A visit to
the private chapel completed the survey of this
part of the mansion, and the party went down-stairs.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to the billiard-room, and
her ladyship taking down a cue, challenged the
colonel, telling him, with a laugh, that she felt

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

sure she could beat him. Of course, the challenge
was accepted&mdash;and, of course, her ladyship was
triumphant&mdash;for though a magnificent player, the
colonel did not mean to win. Some betting took
place during the game, and Oswald, who backed
her ladyship, won a couple of sovereigns from his
grand-dad.</p>

<p>The colonel had hoped that he should now be
freed from the jealous surveillance to which he
had been exposed. Vain expectation. Mrs. Radcliffe
sat down to watch the game, and, dissembling
her rage, extolled Lady Richborough's
play to the skies, declaring she had never seen
anything like it. Mrs. Sutton remained with her
mistress, and her cold grey eyes constantly fixed
upon the colonel rather disturbed his equanimity.
However, he did not desist from paying court to
her ladyship.</p>

<p>Meantime, Sir Charles and his intended had

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

disappeared. They were in the garden, and remained
there so long that Mrs. Radcliffe began
to think they were lost, and sent her husband
in search of them. He found them slowly returning
from a sequestered walk, looking very
like a pair of lovers.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was asking a question which he
had already asked several times.</p>

<p>"Can you be happy here, dearest May?"</p>

<p>"For the twentieth time, yes," she replied;&mdash;"perfectly
happy."</p>

<p>Certainly, if vast domains, a magnificent mansion,
hosts of servants, and all the accessories of
a princely establishment can confer happiness, it
might be found at Boxgrove.</p>

<p>But with all its splendour, and all its attractions,
May could not have been happy had she
not loved Sir Charles. Now nothing dimmed the
brightness of the prospect.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

<p>Did no thought of Hilary intrude itself? If
it did, she banished it on the instant. Why
think of him? She had been interested in him&mdash;nothing
more. A momentary dream. He must
be forgotten. Union with him was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Sir Charles felt he should be the happiest of
men possessed of one so bright and pure&mdash;so
utterly untainted by the world&mdash;as the fair nymph
he had chosen. He loved her passionately&mdash;with
a love that a proud and loyal heart like
his alone can feel&mdash;and he vowed to devote his
life to her.</p>

<p>Not liking to part with his visitors, Sir Charles
proposed that they should stay dinner. Mrs.
Radcliffe objected, declaring she could not venture
to remain out so late. Besides, dinner had
been ordered at home. Why not go back with
them, and dine at Hazlemere?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

<p>Agreed to at once. Provided he was not
separated from the object of his idolatry, Sir
Charles did not care what arrangement was made.
But he could not give up the supreme delight
of riding back with May. Accordingly, evening
dresses for himself and his sister were ordered to
be sent on in the brougham, under the care of
Mr. Spriggs. Pleading fatigue, Mrs. Radcliffe
begged that her carriage might come round in
an hour, and directions were given to that effect.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe must see the stables&mdash;the
hunters were worth seeing, as he would find.
So, Sir Charles being too much occupied to go
with him, her ladyship volunteered to show them
to him herself, and Mr. Thornton played the
part of propriety and went with them.</p>

<p>Luckily, they were free from Mrs. Radcliffe,
who would as soon have entered a dungeon as
a stable. However, in this instance she need

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

not have been so mighty particular, for the
stables of Boxgrove, which were personally superintended
by Lady Richborough, were admirably
kept&mdash;cleaner, her ladyship declared, than
any drawing-room. A pair of bull-terriers belonging
to Thorpe, the coachman, came out to greet
her, and attended her during the inspection. She
did the honours of the stable, if we may so speak,
with inimitable grace; begged the gentlemen to
do as they pleased in regard to a cigar. She
didn't object to one. Sir Charles always smoked
when he went over the stables with her. So they
gladly availed themselves of the permission.</p>

<p>Attended by a couple of active young grooms,
who obeyed her slightest gesture, she then led
them from stall to stall. How well the horses
knew her. What whinnying, what rattling of
halters at the sound of her voice. A pretty sight
to see her standing beside a favourite courser

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

patting his satin coat, and proclaiming his merits.
Pleasant to listen to her, while she dilated with
flashing eyes upon the performances of the noble
animal, who seemed to comprehend what she said,
and testified his satisfaction as she told of his
wondrous feats.</p>

<p>Sir Charles had a first-rate stud&mdash;not an indifferent
horse in the collection. The colonel was
in raptures, and would have been well content
to remain for some time longer in the stables,
especially in such delightful society.</p>

<p>But before the examination could be completed,
they were summoned away. The landau
had gone round, and the horses were being
saddled. Go they must. Mrs. Radcliffe could
not be kept waiting. Indeed, her ladyship felt
she had neglected her shockingly.</p>

<p>That Mrs. Radcliffe was impatient to be off
was manifest. Already she was in the carriage

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

with Mrs. Sutton by her side, and her husband
opposite her. The old gentleman's seat was the
only one vacant. Into it he got as quickly as he
could, for he discerned a frown on his daughter's
brow. Lady Richborough was profuse in her
apologies, but Mrs. Radcliffe smiled blandly and
begged her not to say a word about it. It was
very proper the colonel should see the stables,
and she herself had been greatly amused by
looking about the rooms; in fact, she had spent
a most delightful day. She waved her hand to
Sir Charles and May, who were standing on the
steps, and the carriage drove off.</p>

<p>Scarcely had it passed through the great gateway
than the horses were brought round. Lady
Richborough, though she wanted no assistance,
allowed the colonel to assist her to the saddle.
Kissing the silver handle of her whip to May,
and glancing archly at her brother, she then

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

rode off, escorted as before by the colonel and
Oswald. Our young friend, who it must be
owned, had been infamously treated, was now in
the sulks, and as soon as they gained the park
he dropped behind under pretence of lighting a
cigar, and then, without making an effort to
overtake them, dashed off in a different direction.
Poor fellow! we are concerned to say that his
absence was not regretted.</p>

<p>"How very obliging of that dear Oswald to relieve
us of his company," observed the colonel,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I fear I must have slightly hurt his feelings,"
said her ladyship, displaying her pearls.</p>

<p>"Never mind! he won't break his heart&mdash;though
mine would be broken if I were so
treated."</p>

<p>"I very much doubt if you have a heart to
break," cried her ladyship. "Allons! I will take

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

you back through a different part of the park.
We will go through the woods."</p>

<p>"Through the woods&mdash;charming!" cried the
colonel.</p>

<p>Their course led them through some of the
most secluded portions of the park, and after
passing through the walnut and chesnut groves,
previously mentioned, they were involved in a
thicket which covered the lower part of the hill.
The road, edged on either side by tall pines, was
so narrow that they were obliged to proceed singly.
However, this did not prevent the colonel, who
brought up the rear, from addressing many a
gallant speech to his fair companion. These could
not have been very disagreeable to her, for ever
and anon she turned a smiling face towards him,
and at such moments looked irresistibly charming.</p>

<p>They were still in the midst of the thicket, when
a tall young man was seen ascending the narrow

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

road clothed in a grey Tweed suit, and having a
knapsack at his back. He seemed to require the
aid of the stout stick which he grasped.</p>

<p>On seeing her ladyship he halted for a moment,
and then came on. Owing to the interposition of
the foremost horse, he could not distinguish the
colonel, neither did the colonel perceive him. Her
ladyship, however, shook her whip at her companion
to check the rapturous speech he had just
commenced, and he took the hint without exactly
knowing why silence was enjoined.</p>

<p>As Lady Richborough drew near, the young
man stepped out of the road to allow her passage.
Leaning against a lofty pine for support, he raised
his felt hat to salute her, revealing pallid but
singularly handsome features, that startled her as
she gazed on them.</p>

<p>In an instant she recovered from her surprise,
and courteously returning the salutation, passed
on. Looking back, she perceived, from the

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

colonel's manner, that the stranger was not unknown
to him. What surprised her still more
was, that the colonel's countenance had assumed a
very stern expression. He was evidently put out
by the unexpected rencounter.</p>

<p>Reining in her steed, she said,</p>

<p>"You appear to know that young man, colonel.
May I ask who he is?"</p>

<p>"I know very little about him," he replied,
carelessly. "I met him this morning at Hazlemere.
An artist, I believe, by name Hilary St.
Ives."</p>

<p>"That Hilary St. Ives?" cried her ladyship.
"Now, indeed, I am surprised. Do call him back.
I should like so much to speak to him."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship must excuse me if I decline
to obey your behest," rejoined the colonel. "I
can have nothing to do with that young fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed her ladyship.</p>

<p>She saw something was wrong. But the

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

colonel's manner did not encourage her to ask any
further questions, and though still full of curiosity,
she desisted.</p>

<p>But how came Hilary in Boxgrove Park?
Above all, how came he in that secluded road,
known to few, and frequented by none save
inmates of the mansion?</p>

<p>The thought perplexed her strangely.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

<p>VIII.</p>

<p class="small">HILARY'S LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A disagreeable</span> surprise, as we are aware,
awaited Mrs. Radcliffe on her return to Hazlemere.</p>

<p>As she entered her boudoir, she learnt from
Annette, who was in attendance, that Hilary had
taken his departure.</p>

<p>"The young gentleman left quite sudden, mem,
about an hour and a half after you had started
for Boxgrove, without mentioning his intention

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

to any one&mdash;except me. He went away on foot,
with a knapsack on his back."</p>

<p>"But surely he left some message for me?"</p>

<p>"Only this letter, mem, which he desired me
to lay on your table. No doubt it will give you
all perticklers."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe looked at the letter, but, much
to Annette's disappointment, did not open it,
deferring its perusal till she should be quite
alone.</p>

<p>"I haven't time to read it now," she said. "I
must dress for dinner at once. Lady Richborough
will require your services presently. Her
ladyship dines here to-day, and will dress on her
arrival."</p>

<p>"Yes, mem, I knows. Mr. Spriggs have
brought her la'yship's evening dress in the broom,
and I've put it out all ready for her in Miss
May's dressing-room. A sweet pretty dress it is,

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

mem, as ever I see, and I'm sure her la'yship
will look charming in it, as she do in everything
she wears."</p>

<p>Annette was not all prepared for the pique
exhibited by her mistress at this observation.
She followed her into the dressing-room, which
communicated by a side-door with the boudoir.
The dressing-room was very tastefully fitted up,
with a large cheval glass hung with muslin, and
a toilette-table covered with old lace, on which
reposed numberless flacons of perfumes, boxes of
pearl-powder and iris-powder, and pots of fard.</p>

<p>"Look out my prettiest dress, Annette," said
Mrs. Radcliffe, seating herself in a chaise longue.
"I must not be entirely eclipsed by her ladyship."</p>

<p>"No fear of that, mem," replied Annette, eager
to repair the error she had committed. "I always
says, and Mrs. Sutton will bear me out, that

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

for grace and style&mdash;let alone good looks&mdash;no
one can come up to our own dear lady."</p>

<p>"You are a silly creature, Annette, and I ought
not to listen to such ridiculous flattery," said Mrs.
Radcliffe, smiling. "My day is gone by."</p>

<p>"Oh no, mem, I can't allow that. Any one
would take you for Miss May's elder sister."</p>

<p>"Bah! Choose the dress that you think will
become me most. I really want to look well
to-night."</p>

<p>"Then wear your white satin robe with the
yellow satin panier, mem. You will put a complete
distinguisher on her la'yship's pink dress."</p>

<p>Precisely what Mrs. Radcliffe desired. So the
dress recommended was adopted, and very charming
her mistress looked in it, Annette declared.</p>

<p>Her task ended, Annette was departing, when
Mrs. Radcliffe stopped her to inquire whether
Mr. St. Ives had given any directions respecting
his chest.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

<p>"No, mem, he said nothing about it, and I
didn't think to ask him; but after he was gone
I went to his room, and the first thing I see
was the chest. The key was in it, so I thought
there could be no harm in taking a peep at its
contents. It was nearly full of linen and clothes&mdash;fine
shirts as ever you see, mem, and spick-and-span
new coats and waistcoats. I don't know
what else there might be, for I had seen quite
enough, and locking up the chest I put the key
in my pocket, intending to give it to Mrs. Sutton
on her return."</p>

<p>"Quite right. But don't give it her just now.
She is busy about dinner, and this unexpected
occurrence will put her out very much&mdash;as it
does me."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, mem, Mrs. Sutton
must have heard of the young gentleman's sudden
departure from Mr. Luff. All the servants have
been talking about it."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

<p>"Well, go and see after her ladyship. She
must have arrived by this time. Make her look
as charming as you can."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear from her, mem, I
can assure you," rejoined Annette, as she quitted
the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe then passed into the boudoir.</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, she opened Hilary's
letter. The bank-notes dropped out upon the
table and alarmed her, and her agitation increased
as she read as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;You desired me to await your return,
but I cannot do so, for reasons which I shall
proceed to state.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall not pain you by what I have to
say. I would not wound the feelings of one to
whom I owe so much, and for whom I feel such
strong affection. But I must speak plainly, lest
my conduct should be misunderstood.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

<p>"The mystery of my birth is no longer a
mystery. Brought hither by fate, when proceeding
in a different direction in quest of information,
I have unexpectedly learnt the secret. But the
knowledge thus strangely acquired has been dearly
purchased. My true position has been revealed
to me. I now know <i>why</i> I am disowned, and <i>why</i>
I can never be acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Judging by my own emotions, I can guess
what yours must have been, when carried away
by excitement, you allowed the secret, which you
have so long and so carefully kept, to escape your
lips. The avowal, I know, was made unconsciously,
and perhaps would have been recalled,
had recall been possible. Would it had never
been made!</p>

<p>"What extravagances I might have committed
in the delirium of the moment, but for the interruption
caused by your husband's entrance, I
cannot tell. No wonder I was scarcely master

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

of myself, when I obtained the certitude that the
mother whom I supposed to be dead was living
and standing before me.</p>

<p>"But when my transports subsided, reflection
convinced me that I had better have remained in
ignorance of the secret.</p>

<p>"The discovery could profit me nothing. The
necessity for concealment was strong as ever&mdash;stronger
perhaps. No disclosure of my parentage
could possibly be made without damage to the
honour and happiness of others. I must remain
what I am. On no consideration would I bring
disgrace upon you, or upon those with whom you
are connected.</p>

<p>"Were I to stay here longer I should not only
offend your husband, for whom I entertain great
respect, and from whom I have experienced great
kindness, but I might also unintentionally imperil
you. Prudence, therefore, enjoins my immediate

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

departure. Another interview with you might
shake the good resolutions I have formed.</p>

<p>"Some things connected with my history still
perplex me, and these you might have explained.
But I shall institute no further inquiries. I have
learnt enough&mdash;too much, alas!</p>

<p>"You may desire to know what I propose to
do. I shall strive to achieve an independence. I
have marked out a career for myself which I shall
steadily and unflinchingly pursue. Relying for
success entirely upon my own energies, I can
accept no further aid, even from those who may
deem it a duty to aid me.</p>

<p>"Acting upon this resolve, I must respectfully
decline Colonel Delacombe's late presents in
money and clothing, and beg to return them to
him, through you. Though poor enough, Heaven
knows! I do not require the large sum he has

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

thought proper to send me&mdash;nor any portion of
it. My own hand will maintain me.</p>

<p>"One thing more. As I shall never bear his
arms, even with a bend sinister, his signet-ring
will be useless to me. Pray restore it to him.
I do not now need the evidence it affords of my
birth.</p>

<p>"In acting thus, do not suppose I am influenced
by pride, or galled by the sense of injustice. I
have no right to be proud; and if I have suffered
wrong I can endure it without a murmur. I am
actuated by feelings which, if I could explain
them, would, I am sure, command your respect.</p>

<p>"To say that I can ever become reconciled to
my enforced position would be idle and untrue.
But I must learn to submit.</p>

<p>"Henceforth, I stand alone.</p>

<p>"Farewell, madam! Think of me sometimes,
I pray you. I shall always think of you&mdash;always

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

with affection. We may never meet again&mdash;better
we should not&mdash;but rest assured whatever
betide, you will never have reason to blush for
him who is, unfortunately, compelled to subscribe
himself,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Hilary St. Ives</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>The perusal of this letter roused extraordinary
emotions in Mrs. Radcliffe's breast, and she was
still under their dominion when Mrs. Sutton
entered the boudoir. The housekeeper's haggard
looks alarmed her mistress.</p>

<p>"Don't agitate me, Sutton, I beseech you.
My nerves have been dreadfully shattered by this
letter. Read it before you say a word."</p>

<p>The housekeeper sat down, and it was well she
did so, for she had not read many lines when her
strength completely failed her. A mist gathered
before her eyes, but she brushed aside her tears

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

and went on. Internal agony was plainly depicted
in her countenance, and excited Mrs. Radcliffe's
commiseration. But the housekeeper resented
her sympathy.</p>

<p>"This is all your fault!" she cried. "The
error you have committed may appear trifling,
but it is fraught with fearful consequences, which
cannot be repaired. You have led him to believe
you are his mother, and he has gone away with
that conviction. How is he to be disabused?
You cannot find him. You cannot communicate
with him. See what you have done. By an
inconsiderate word you have deprived him of the
few friends he possesses, and have thrown him
upon the world without resources. For whatever
misfortunes may happen to him you will be
responsible. He tells you that you have made
him wretched, and the whole tenor of his letter
proves that he is so."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

<p>"Peace, Sutton, peace! I cannot endure this.
No misfortunes shall happen to him. I can still
find means of aiding him."</p>

<p>"But he will not accept your assistance."</p>

<p>"He can be aided indirectly. The colonel will
devise some plan for his benefit."</p>

<p>"The colonel will do nothing for him. I am
sure of it."</p>

<p>"You are unjust towards the colonel, Sutton.
He has shown every disposition to help the poor
young man."</p>

<p>"How?" demanded the housekeeper, sceptically.</p>

<p>"Has he not just sent him five hundred
pounds and an expensive outfit? What further
proof do you need of the interest he takes in
Hilary's welfare?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton could make no rejoinder.</p>

<p>"No one could have foreseen the unfortunate

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

turn that things have taken," pursued Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Hilary's pride&mdash;though, like all proud
people, he denies that he has any pride&mdash;is a
stumbling-block in the way of his advancement.
I fear also that he is wanting in gratitude. I
observe with pain that he does not allude to you
in his letter. I trust he has written to bid you
farewell, and thank you for your great kindness
to him."</p>

<p>"He has not written to me," rejoined the
housekeeper, with difficulty repressing a pang.</p>

<p>"He is much to blame for the neglect. But his
thoughts, no doubt, were occupied with me, whom
he looks upon as his mother. A strange mistake,
and yet not surprising&mdash;all things considered."</p>

<p>"It is not surprising at all, after what you
have said to him," cried the housekeeper, sharply.
"He is gone. Let him take his own course."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot desert him. I must watch over

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

him&mdash;unseen, unknown. You shall act for me,
Sutton."</p>

<p>"I can make no promise."</p>

<p>"You are hurt by his ingratitude towards
you, and I don't wonder at it. But you must
make allowances for him. We will talk more
on the subject to-morrow. Meantime, I must
put these things by."</p>

<p>"I should like to read that letter again. Leave
it with me, if you are going down-stairs."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, dear Sutton. I know the letter
would be safe with you. But I cannot trust it
out of my own custody."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she locked up the letter and
the roll of bank-notes in a tiroir of the bureau.</p>

<p>If she could have seen the look bestowed upon
her by the housekeeper while she was thus employed,
she would not have gone down to dinner
with as much composure as she did.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch09">

<p>IX.</p>

<p class="small">A LITTLE MUSIC IN THE DRAWING-KOOM, AND A LITTLE
TALK IN THE DRESSING-ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one would have suspected from Mrs. Radcliffe's
looks and manner during dinner that anything
was on her mind. Greatly disturbed by
Hilary's abrupt departure, her jealousy was again
excited by the colonel's continued attentions to
Lady Richborough. Yet her countenance had a
placid expression, and a smile was upon her lips.
Despite all Annette's efforts, she was completely
thrown into the shade by her ladyship, who

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

looked surprisingly well in an evening dress.
White as Parian marble, Myrtilla's lovely neck
and shoulders might have served as a model for
a sculptor, while the classical mould of her
features would have suggested a representation
of the goddesss of the silver bow. She was in
high spirits, and though her sweetest smiles and
most bewitching glances were bestowed upon the
colonel, she dispensed her fascinations around,
and did not even neglect poor Oswald. In short,
she was extremely useful as well as highly
ornamental, and communicated a vast deal of life
and spirit to the party, which might have flagged
without her aid, for Sir Charles talked only to
May.</p>

<p>Her ladyship's curiosity having been excited by
the rencounter in the morning, she brought up
the subject of Hilary St. Ives. But no one
seemed inclined to talk about him. Mr. Radcliffe

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

could give no explanation of his sudden departure;
and Mr. Thornton shrugged his shoulders
when questioned. He knew nothing about
the young fellow, and was heartily glad he was
gone. That was all he had to say. Very strange.
She thought Mrs. Radcliffe could tell her something,
and resolved to seek an explanation from
her in private.</p>

<p>Dinner excellent. The cabinet Johannisberg
warmed grandpapa's heart, and the '20 port,
which appeared with the dessert, put him into a
blissful state. Apropos of the dessert! we may
be permitted to mention that M'Donald's strawberries
were magnificent, and Sir Charles told
Mrs. Radcliffe that he must certainly carry away
her gardener.</p>

<p>The health of the queen of the f&ecirc;te was of
course drunk in bumpers, and the few words
uttered on the occasion by grandpapa caused a

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

good deal of laughter, and raised some blushes
on May's cheek.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the ladies retired, and the
gentlemen quickly followed them&mdash;much too
quickly for Mr. Thornton, who had not half
finished his bottle of '20 port. He hated to be
hurried in this way. Why should not a man
be allowed to enjoy his wine?&mdash;especially wine
like this.</p>

<p>"Do tell me something about this mysterious
Hilary St. Ives?" said Lady Richborough to
Mrs. Radcliffe, as they entered the drawing-room
together.</p>

<p>"He is an artist, that is all I know about him,"
was the evasive reply.</p>

<p>"But why has he left you so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Grandpapa and the colonel objected to him.
I know no other reason."</p>

<p>"Oh! the colonel objected to him!&mdash;that's

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

odd! Do you know that I was very much struck
by his likeness to the colonel."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As the colonel and I were riding back
through one of the thickets in the park, we came
upon him quite unexpectedly. I had not the
slightest idea who he was at the moment&mdash;but
the likeness startled me."</p>

<p>"Strange you should meet him there? What
could he be doing in the park?"</p>

<p>"Just what I want to know. Does he intend
to remain in the neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"I should think not. I fancy he is going to
town to practise his profession."</p>

<p>"Boxgrove is out of the way, if he was going
to town. He must have had some motive to take
him there."</p>

<p>"I can conceive none, unless he desired to take
some views of the park. It is certainly strange

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

he should be there. If you see him again, or
hear anything more of him, pray inform me."</p>

<p>"Aha! she takes an interest in him, I perceive,"
thought her ladyship, "There must be
some reason for his sudden departure."</p>

<p>Naturally, she promised compliance, and then
added quickly, "You will think I am troubling
you with questions&mdash;but tell me! Is Colonel
Delacombe a widower? You are aware I have
seen him for the first time to-day, and know very
little of him except by report as a distinguished
officer."</p>

<p>Guessing the object of the inquiry, Mrs. Radcliffe
could not help smiling.</p>

<p>"A widower! no!" she rejoined. "Colonel
Delacombe has never been married. I can state
that positively."</p>

<p>Her ladyship appeared very well satisfied by the
assurance.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

<p>"What are you talking about?" asked May,
joining them.</p>

<p>Before replying, Lady Richborough consulted
Mrs. Radcliffe by a glance, that seemed to say,
"Shall I tell her?" and received a look signifying,
"Better not."</p>

<p>She therefore answered, "I have been propounding
a riddle, which mamma finds it difficult
to solve. Come to the piano. I want to practise
a duet with you before the gentlemen appear."</p>

<p>The evening passed off delightfully. Lady
Richborough was so much occupied at the piano,
that she could not flirt with the colonel, though
she held him in thrall by her voice, and ever
and anon electrified him with a glance. Consequently,
Mrs. Radcliffe was quite easy, and able
to enjoy the music. Oswald likewise, who had
been unmercifully rallied by his grandsire, put
on a cheerful air, and accompanied the ladies on
the cornet-&agrave;-piston.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

<p>Myrtilla in a riding-habit, on horseback, or in
the stable&mdash;laughing, jesting, indulging in a little
harmless slang, and tolerant of a cigar; Myrtilla
in the drawing-room, in a costume not calculated
to conceal her splendid neck and shoulders&mdash;dazzling,
refined, accomplished&mdash;so different was
her ladyship under the two aspects, that she
scarcely resembled the same person.</p>

<p>If the colonel was captivated by the fair
equestrian, whose predilection for the stable and
fondness for its occupants in no way displeased
him, he was perfectly fascinated by the grace
and accomplishments of the high-bred dame.
Conscious that she looked well at the piano,
Myrtilla enthroned herself before the instrument
during the evening. Gifted with a rich contralto
voice, she sang the "brindisi" almost as well as
Alboni, and completed her performance by a
grand fantasia, which she executed with wonderful
brilliancy.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

<p>The colonel and Mr. Thornton were transported,
and expressed their delight with enthusiasm,
but Sir Charles, who was accustomed to
his sister's wondrous performances, very much
preferred a simple ballad, which was exquisitely
sung by May. It held him breathless as he
listened.</p>

<p>Delightful as it was, the evening came to an
end. Before the party separated, arrangements
were made for next day. Everybody was to dine
at Boxgrove, and come over early if the day
should prove fine&mdash;to play at croquet, or ramble
about the park.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, as usual, feared it would be too
much for her, but promised to come, nevertheless.
What laughing there was in the hall! And how
Sir Charles envied his sister the kiss she received
from May as she bade her good night!</p>

<p>The colonel had a tender word for her ladyship,

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

and gently squeezed her hand, while leading
her to the brougham.</p>

<p>"Well, dear boy!" cried Myrtilla, as they were
borne swiftly towards Boxgrove, "I can really
and truly congratulate you. You will have the
sweetest wife in England. But what's to become
of poor me, when you are married?"</p>

<p>"Why you will live with us, of course," he
rejoined.</p>

<p>"Not at all of course. Perhaps, your wife
won't like me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you know better."</p>

<p>Her ladyship appeared abstracted for a moment,
and then tapping him with her fan, said, "Light
a cigar. Don't go to sleep."</p>

<p>"I never was less inclined to sleep," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Colonel Delacombe?"
she asked, rather abruptly.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think of him, Myrtilla? That's
more to the purpose," he rejoined, with a laugh.
"Are you disposed to return with him to India?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't altogether dislike it. I suppose
he is well off. Find out all about him for me,
dear boy."</p>

<p>Sir Charles told her there was no necessity to
make any inquiries respecting an officer so well
known and so distinguished as Colonel Delacombe.
Thereupon, he lighted a manilla, and her ladyship
fell into a reverie, which lasted till they reached
the house.</p>

<p>Here we shall leave them, and return to May,
who had already retired to her dressing-room, and
while preparing for rest was ruminating upon the
events of the day, when a gentle tap at the door
announced the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sutton, I'm so glad to see you!" cried
May. "I want to know what has happened to

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

poor Hilary St. Ives. Annette tells me he has
left a letter for mamma. You have seen it, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are secrets in it, which I am
not permitted to disclose."</p>

<p>"Secrets! Dear me, how dreadfully mysterious!
You quite rouse my curiosity. Am I
not to know a little bit of the letter?" she said, in
a coaxing tone.</p>

<p>"No, I daren't speak. Besides, you can't take
any interest in the poor young man now."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Sutton, I take the greatest
interest in him&mdash;in his welfare, I mean. I have
been thinking of something for him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Our portraits&mdash;that is, the portraits of
Sir Charles and myself&mdash;are to be placed in the
great gallery, which you visited this morning,
Sutton. I mean Hilary to paint them."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

<p>"But will Sir Charles consent?"</p>

<p>"Sir Charles will do anything I like. He will
be delighted to encourage genius."</p>

<p>"I fear he will not have an opportunity of
doing so in Hilary's case. The poor young man is
gone. He does not desire to be heard of more.
I suspect he means to change his name."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say it is very stupid of him&mdash;very
annoying&mdash;just when I had arranged it all so
nicely."</p>

<p>"He could know nothing of your kind intentions.
But I don't think he would have painted
the portraits."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure he would&mdash;if I had asked him,"
she cried, in a tone of pique. "I'm quite angry
with him for being so foolish."</p>

<p>"Do you recollect our conversation before
breakfast this morning, dear?" said Mrs. Sutton,
fixing an inquiring look upon her. "Are you

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

quite satisfied with what you have done since?
Don't be afraid of confiding in me."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Sutton, my feelings are entirely
changed since morning, I have discovered that I
can love Sir Charles&mdash;nay, I <i>do</i> love him. All his
noble qualities have been revealed to me, and I am
surprised I should have been so long blind to them."</p>

<p>"When did you make the discovery?&mdash;at Boxgrove?"
inquired the housekeeper, in an ironical
tone.</p>

<p>"You think me inconstant, I perceive, but I am
not so. This morning my heart was perfectly disengaged&mdash;and
I own I should not have listened to
Sir Charles except on his sister's persuasion. I
now know him better than I did. As I first
looked into his eyes, I read truth and loyalty in
them&mdash;and such devotion, Sutton. I am sure he
would lay down his life for me if I required it.
He said so."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

<p>"A mere phrase!" cried the housekeeper, with
an ill-disguised sneer. "All men say so."</p>

<p>"It was not an idle phrase with him, but of
course I don't mean to put his devotion to the
proof."</p>

<p>"No, that wouldn't be prudent. You would
lose Boxgrove."</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Sutton, that you are not pleased
that I have accepted Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"All I desire is your happiness, dear."</p>

<p>"Then rest easy. I shall be perfectly happy
with him."</p>

<p>"At all events, you will be Lady Ilminster&mdash;mistress
of one of the most splendid seats in the
county, and while elevating yourself, you will
have the satisfaction of feeling that you have
elevated your own family."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly like what you say, Sutton,
nor the tone in which you say it. I know that

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

I love Sir Charles&mdash;not for his title&mdash;not for
Boxgrove&mdash;but for <i>himself</i>&mdash;though you would
imply the contrary&mdash;and I am sure I shall be
happy with him."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so. Good night, dear! May
your slumbers be light and pleasant."</p>

<p>As she left the room she muttered to herself,
"Impossible to shake her! She is as worldly as
her mother."</p>

<p>"Something is the matter with Sutton to-night,"
thought May, as she was left alone. "She
appears to be put out by poor Hilary's departure.
Well, I am sorry I cannot help him, but perhaps
it is better he is gone."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards she sought her couch, and
sweet dreams springing from a pure and gentle
heart hovered above her pillow.</p>

<p>Thus ended May's nineteenth birthday.</p>

<p>X.</p>

<p class="small">THE COLONEL'S OPINION OF THE LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Mrs. Radcliffe did not make
her appearance at breakfast. Nor could this be
wondered at, after the fatigue she had undergone
on the previous day. Besides, she had another
fatiguing day in prospect.</p>

<p>However, she sent a message by Mrs. Sutton
to Colonel Delacombe, begging him to come up
to her boudoir after breakfast, as she wished to
have a little conversation with him.</p>

<p>To hear was to obey. Though for many

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

reasons the colonel would willingly have avoided
the proposed t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>

<p>On repairing to the boudoir, he found the lady
reclining in her accustomed fauteuil near the fire&mdash;for
there was still a fire, though the day was
bright and warm&mdash;got up for the occasion in
an elegant dishabille. Languor in her manner,
reproach in her looks.</p>

<p>Saluting him in a faint&mdash;very faint&mdash;voice,
she did not attempt to rise&mdash;that would have
been too great an effort&mdash;or even offer him her
hand, though he hesitated not to take it. She
prayed him to be seated, but the colonel preferred
standing with his back to the fire, regarding her
with what he intended for a strong expression of
sympathy.</p>

<p>Neither of them dreamed that the door communicating
with the dressing-room, which was
concealed by a screen, was left slightly ajar, and

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

that the person stationed behind it could hear,
and <i>did</i> hear, all that passed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you rather overdid it yesterday,
Esther," said the colonel. "You look sadly
jaded."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I am suffering from low spirits&mdash;not
fatigue."</p>

<p>"Low spirits! This is not the time to indulge
in the vapours when you have made such a capital
hit with your daughter. You have got everything
you could desire. Boxgrove is really the
finest old place I ever saw, and Sir Charles is
excessively gentlemanlike and agreeable."</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't complain. I am perfectly satisfied
with May's choice. Apropos of Sir Charles!
what do you think of his sister?" demanded the
lady, fixing her eye-glass upon him.</p>

<p>"Now it's coming," he thought. "A very fine
woman. Time was when I should have fallen
desperately in love with her."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

<p>"Time <i>was</i>, Seymour!" cried the lady, reproachfully.
"Say, rather, time <i>is</i>. It appears
to me that you are just as impressionable as ever.
I was grieved to see you make such a ridiculous
exhibition of yourself yesterday. You fancy her
ladyship is struck. My poor, dear, deluded friend,
she was only trifling with you, as you will find
to your cost, if you think at all seriously of a
heartless coquette, who flirts with every man she
meets. You saw how she treated Oswald. Well,
the day before she was flirting violently with
him, and half turned the poor boy's head. I
suppose you know she loses her jointure if she
marries again?"</p>

<p>"A hint to that effect was given me by Mr.
Thornton. But what is her jointure to me? I
don't care about it."</p>

<p>"But you care a great deal about the lovely
widow&mdash;that is evident. Nay, no protestations to
the contrary. They won't pass with me. Listen,"

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

she exclaimed, altering her manner. "You shall
not say that I am in the way. I release you
from your vow. But for your own sake, Seymour,
as you value your peace and comfort, don't
choose Myrtilla. She will drive you frantic with
jealousy."</p>

<p>The colonel laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>"A capital joke," he cried. "I rather fancy
I can take care of myself. Her ladyship may
use a needle-gun, but since I shall keep out of
range, she won't hurt me."</p>

<p>And he again laughed gaily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe shook her head and sighed:</p>

<p>"Ah, you men&mdash;you men! base deceivers
ever! But to change the theme. I have a letter
to show you."</p>

<p>"A letter!" he exclaimed, with internal misgiving.
"I hate letters. For one that is pleasant
we get a dozen disagreeable."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

<p>"I am sorry to inflict this upon you, but you
must see it. It is from Hilary St. Ives."</p>

<p>"From him! ha!" cried the colonel, knitting
his brows.</p>

<p>Seating himself, he read the letter deliberately,
without making a remark, but his looks grew
sterner as he went on.</p>

<p>"This would be laughable were it not serious!"
he cried, tossing down the letter angrily when he
had done. "I suppose we must treat it seriously,
though it scarcely deserves to be so treated. The
young fellow seems half crazed. The knock on
the pate that he got from the gipsies must have
confused his intellects. Several points require explanation."</p>

<p>"You can best explain one point, Seymour,"
rejoined Mrs. Radcliffe. "Pardon me if I put a
direct question to you. The circumstances of the
case must plead my excuse. You may be perfectly

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

frank with me. Have you any reason to believe
this young man to be your son?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear Esther, if I reply by
another question. Have you any reason to believe
yourself to be his mother?"</p>

<p>"For shame, Seymour!" she cried, with affected
indignation. "This is too bad."</p>

<p>"Not a bit worse than the accusation you bring
against me."</p>

<p>"Well, I have another interrogation to put.
Since you deny the parentage, pray, what was
your motive for sending him the five hundred
pounds and the outfit?"</p>

<p>"On my honour, I have sent him neither."</p>

<p>"But here are the bank notes to confute you,
and the clothes-chest is in his room."</p>

<p>"Another hand has been at work&mdash;not mine,"
he rejoined, gravely. "This is a most vexatious
business, and you yourself&mdash;from the best of

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

motives&mdash;have contrived to complicate it. With
regard to the money which you suppose came
from me, I advise you to commit it to the keeping
of Mrs. Sutton. She may find an opportunity of
communicating with the young man. But do not
meddle further in the matter yourself. You have
already done too much."</p>

<p>"I will act as you suggest. I don't like the
charge of the money. One more question and
I have done. How came your signet-ring in
Hilary's possession?"</p>

<p>"Now, I confess you puzzle me. I can only
answer that I lost the ring many years ago&mdash;before
I went out to India."</p>

<p>"Before you knew me, Seymour?"</p>

<p>"Why that question? Yes. It may have
been stolen from me with some such design as has
just been put in practice. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I must be. May I keep the ring?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

<p>"Certainly. But let me burn that letter. It
compromises you most seriously."</p>

<p>The person outside the door was upon the point
of rushing into the room to prevent, at all hazards,
the destruction of the letter, but Mrs. Radcliffe's
answer checked her.</p>

<p>"No, I can't allow you to burn it," she cried,
snatching the letter from him. "No one shall
see it."</p>

<p>"This is downright madness," cried the colonel.
"Suppose the letter were to fall into your husband's
hands, what would he think of it?"</p>

<p>"Such an event will never occur. Mr. Radcliffe
never opens any of my drawers."</p>

<p>The colonel did not look half satisfied, but he
saw it was useless to remonstrate further, for Mrs.
Radcliffe proceeded to lock up the letter, the
bank-notes, and the ring.</p>

<p>"There, they are all safe now!" she cried.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

<p>"I hope Mrs. Sutton has not got a key of that
drawer," he remarked.</p>

<p>"No, no. This is the only key I don't trust her
with."</p>

<p>"You trust her a great deal too much, Esther.
Be cautious."</p>

<p>"My dear Seymour, she is fidelity itself, and
would never betray a secret of mine."</p>

<p>"Then her looks belie her. I am a physiognomist,
you know, and I warn you against her. She
is treacherous."</p>

<p>"Treacherous! why, you have just advised me
to give her the five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Because I would rather she had it than you.
Hist!" he cried, "I thought I heard a noise."</p>

<p>As the words were uttered the dressing-room
door was softly closed.</p>

<p>Just in time, for the colonel looked over the top
of the screen, but of course made no discovery.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

<p>"Where is Mrs. Sutton?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Possibly in my dressing-room.
She went there just before you came in. Have
you anything to say to her?"</p>

<p>"Merely a word."</p>

<p>"Just touch the bell then."</p>

<p>The colonel did as enjoined, and shortly afterwards
Mrs. Sutton made her appearance.</p>

<p>The colonel fixed a stern and searching look
upon her.</p>

<p>"Your mistress has some money to give you,"
he said. "You will know what to do with it."</p>

<p>The housekeeper looked inquiringly at Mrs.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Yes, the money sent to Hilary. You understand,
Sutton. The colonel thinks you ought to
have charge of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the clothes-chest too. Take care
of that. And see that your mistress is no further
troubled."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

<p>"Is Colonel Delacombe master here?" said the
housekeeper to Mrs. Radcliffe. "Am I to take
his orders or yours?"</p>

<p>"You will be pleased to take mine now," said
the colonel, with a look that crushed her, as he
quitted the room.</p>

<p>XI.</p>

<p class="small">A SKETCH TAKEN IN BOXGROVE PARK.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time the colonel got down-stairs he
had quite recovered his composure, and was able
to offer a very cheerful greeting to Sir Charles,
who had arrived during his absence. This early
visit was not included in the arrangements of the
day, but was none the less agreeable because
unexpected. The only thing that marred the
colonel's satisfaction was that her ladyship had
been left behind. Far too considerate to interrupt
a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, already commenced by the

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

lovers in the drawing-room, he strolled out into
the garden to smoke a cigar, and think matters
over.</p>

<p>His meditations were chiefly occupied by Myrtilla,
of whom, notwithstanding his assertions to
Mrs. Radcliffe, he had become violently enamoured;
and though he entertained no doubt
that her captivating ladyship was the coquette
she had been represented, he did not feel
uneasy on that account. Vanity whispered that
she wouldn't throw him over. She was just the
person to suit him. Such a wife would give
him additional &eacute;clat. Her unrivalled beauty would
create an immense sensation in India. He didn't
care how much she was admired. Esther declared
he would be frightfully jealous. Bah!
He laughed at the idea. His was not a jealous
nature. But hold! he was getting on rather too
fast. There was a trifling difficulty in the way

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

that had to be removed&mdash;a difficulty that he
could not have foreseen a few days ago. The
consideration of this difficulty, which to any other
than the colonel would have appeared insurmountable,
necessitated a second cigar&mdash;even a
third. Nor when that was consumed had he
arrived at a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>At last, he resolved to ride over by himself
to Boxgrove, and have a talk with her ladyship.
Having communicated his design to Mr. Radcliffe,
that gentleman ordered a horse to be brought
round for him at once.</p>

<p>However, we will mount a courser fleeter than
any in our respected friend's stables, and speeding
to Boxgrove, ascertain what the lovely Myrtilla
was about.</p>

<p>It may be asked why she did not accompany
her brother? To this we must reply that Sir
Charles did not particularly desire her company.

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

A real lover, when not in the society of the
mistress of his heart, wishes to be alone.</p>

<p>Her ladyship rode with him to the lodge-gates,
and then receiving a hint to the above effect,
quitted him, and continued to take exercise within
the park, riding about in different directions for
some time.</p>

<p>Her thoughts, we may be permitted to say, were
occupied with the colonel, and she was considering
whether it would be worth while to accept him.</p>

<p>All at once, she caught sight of a figure
among a grove of trees which at once fixed her
attention.</p>

<p>The person she beheld was seated upon the
root of a large beech-tree, and was evidently
sketching the mansion, which could be very well
seen from the position he had selected.</p>

<p>Entertaining no doubt that the sketcher was
Hilary St. Ives, she determined to have a word

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

with him. Bashfulness, as we are aware, was not
her ladyship's foible. A circuitous route brought
her to the back of the wood, and she came upon
him by surprise. He was so much engrossed by
his task that he did not notice her approach till
she was close beside him. When he perceived
her, he arose in some confusion, and took off
his hat to salute her.</p>

<p>"Do not let me interrupt you, I beg," she
said, with a gracious smile. And wishing to put
him completely at his ease, she added, "Mr.
Hilary St. Ives, I believe."</p>

<p>Bowing assent, he rejoined, "I am afraid I
am an intruder; but I was so struck with this
fine old mansion yesterday that I could not quit
the neighbourhood without making a sketch of it."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to look at the sketch?"</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure. But I fear it
won't please you. I haven't satisfied myself."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

<p>"I like it very much," she rejoined. "I don't
see how it could be improved. Many sketches
have been taken of the old place, but I like
none so much as this. I think you have chosen
the best view of the place."</p>

<p>"Every view of the mansion is picturesque
and striking. It would make a dozen capital
pictures."</p>

<p>"Can I prevail upon you to execute them? I
will endeavour to make it worth your while to
oblige me."</p>

<p>"I should be delighted to do your bidding, and
without other reward than such commendation
as you have bestowed upon this worthless sketch.
But I am going away immediately."</p>

<p>"The delay of a day or two cannot much
matter, I should think," she remarked, with a
captivating smile.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship may be quite sure that if I

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

had not good reason for declining, I would not
hesitate to obey you."</p>

<p>"You know me, I perceive."</p>

<p>"Once seen, your ladyship is not likely to be
forgotten. I caught a glimpse of you at Hazlemere
yesterday, and later on I was fortunate
enough to meet you in one of the thickets of this
park."</p>

<p>"Yes. Colonel Delacombe told me your name.
I had heard of you previously."</p>

<p>She looked at him as she made the observation,
and perceived that a shade came over his brow.</p>

<p>"Do you know the colonel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I never saw him before yesterday. I appear
to have given him some offence&mdash;certainly most
unintentionally on my part. But he seems to have
conceived a strange antipathy to me, and has
caused my dismissal from Hazlemere. Till he
appeared, I experienced nothing but kindness from
Mr. Radcliffe and every inmate in the house."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

<p>"And you cannot account for his dislike of
you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can&mdash;but I cannot very easily explain
it. To speak frankly, it is to avoid meeting
him again that I desire not to remain longer
here."</p>

<p>"Have you practised as an artist in London,
Mr. St. Ives?" she inquired, after a pause. "Perhaps
you are a student of the Royal Academy?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not that distinction," he rejoined.
"I have but lately returned from Paris, where the
first essays in my profession were made, and it is
possible I may go back there. If your ladyship
cares to know my history, you can learn it from
Mrs. Radcliffe."</p>

<p>"I shall learn very little from her," she rejoined,
smiling. "To tell you the truth, I have
already made the attempt."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Radcliffe acted wisely," he observed,
with a melancholy smile. "There is nothing to

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

interest you. My history will best be told some
ten years hence."</p>

<p>"Ten years hence! that's a long time. We
shall all be grown old then. You expect to
become famous&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I aspire to win reputation as a portrait
painter."</p>

<p>A future Sir Joshua&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I hope some day to have the honour of painting
your ladyship's portrait. Sir Joshua himself
could not have desired a better subject."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to give you a sitting,"
said her ladyship, with a well-pleased smile.
"But I can't wait ten years. I shall have lost my
good looks before that."</p>

<p>"You shall not wait ten minutes, if you will
allow me to sketch you. I succeeded tolerably
well with Miss Radcliffe yesterday, and I may be
as fortunate with your ladyship."</p>

<p>"So you have taken May! She has never

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

shown me your performance. I should like to
have Azo taken of all things. Try what you can
make of us."</p>

<p>Hilary immediately opened his portfolio, and
prepared for the task.</p>

<p>Moving her horse to a little distance, her ladyship
took up a position.</p>

<p>"Will that do?" she asked.</p>

<p>The artist nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Stand still, Azo," she cried, smoothing her
steed's silken mane with the handle of her whip.
"My pet is going to have his picture taken."</p>

<p>And as if he understood what was required of
him, Azo remained tolerably quiet.</p>

<p>Hilary, as we know, worked with great rapidity.
But he had more to do now than on the previous
occasion. However, he got through his task with
surprising expedition, and succeeded in making a
most spirited sketch.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was enchanted. Praise to a young

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

artist is delicious, but praise from such lips as
Myrtilla's is indescribably sweet.</p>

<p>"Landseer could not have done better," she
cried, enthusiastically. "My pet Azo is drawn
to the life. I must have this sketch, Mr. St.
Ives. Ask anything you please for it&mdash;<i>anything</i>."</p>

<p>"I will only ask you to accept it," he rejoined,
blushing with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Nay, I really cannot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Since I must have some reward, give me this
glove."</p>

<p>She had dropped it, while examining the sketch.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you are a proficient in
gallantry as well as art," cried her ladyship,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I shall keep it as a souvenir of Boxgrove," he
cried, placing the glove within his breast.</p>

<p>The refined gallantry of his manner was not lost
upon her.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

<p>"Decidedly, he is no common person," she
thought.</p>

<p>With one of her most captivating smiles, she
then asked him if he would like to see the house,
adding, that she would have great pleasure in
showing it to him.</p>

<p>"I know how much I shall lose in declining
your ladyship's tempting offer," he replied. "But
I cannot run the risk of meeting any of the party
from Hazlemere."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed on that account. None of
them will be here for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"I am compelled to differ with your ladyship.
Unless I am greatly mistaken, yonder is Colonel
Delacombe," said Hilary, pointing out a cavalier
who had just entered the park, and was evidently
shaping his course towards the mansion.</p>

<p>"You are right. 'Tis he!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to wish your ladyship good
day."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

<p>"Why beat a retreat?" she cried. "Are you
afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"Afraid! no!" exclaimed Hilary, proudly.
"Colonel Delacombe has more reason than I have
to avoid the meeting."</p>

<p>"Then stay and face him. Ha! he sees us.
He is galloping in this direction."</p>

<p>It was now a point of honour with Hilary to
remain.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the colonel came up, his
looks proclaiming surprise and displeasure at the
sight of her ladyship's companion.</p>

<p>Saluting her with his accustomed grace, he
turned to Hilary, and said, sharply,</p>

<p>"You here, sir!"</p>

<p>Myrtilla instantly interposed.</p>

<p>"Visit your displeasure upon me," she said.
"I am the offender. Mr. St. Ives has remained
here at my request."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

<p>"He should not have come here at all," rejoined
the colonel. "He would have shown
better taste by leaving the neighbourhood. I
would recommend his prompt departure."</p>

<p>Myrtilla again tried to interpose, but ineffectually.</p>

<p>Hilary's face flushed deeply. He met the
colonel's look with a glance as stern as his own.</p>

<p>"I must ask Colonel Delacombe by what right
he presumes to question my taste, or to give me
advice?" he said.</p>

<p>"It must suffice that I have expressed my
opinion, sir," rejoined the colonel, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, that will not suffice," rejoined
Hilary, boldly. "Why are you surprised to find
me here? Why do you complain of my remaining
in the neighbourhood? Above all, why
do you enjoin my departure?"</p>

<p>"What have you to say to all this, colonel?"

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

asked Myrtilla, who, it must be confessed, rather
enjoyed his confusion. "If Mr. St. Ives has
offended you, I am sure he will be ready to
apologise."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship is very good to undertake his
defence, but I bring no charge against him. I
simply expressed surprise at seeing him here after
the manner in which he had quitted Hazlemere."</p>

<p>"What manner?" cried Hilary, indignantly.
"I left Hazlemere chiefly because I was given to
understand by Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton
that my presence&mdash;from some cause or other
which you can best explain&mdash;is disagreeable to
you. So far I have obeyed you. But I refuse
to obey your mandate now, unless you can show
that you have some right to exact obedience from
me."</p>

<p>"Have you such right, colonel?" cried Myrtilla,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I appeal to Mr. St. Ives's good taste and

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

good feeling," said the colonel. "I hope he will
see the impropriety of remaining in this neighbourhood&mdash;especially
after his own expressed determination&mdash;and
I think a little reflection will
convince him that I am right."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," replied Hilary. "I
confess that I have acted inconsiderately, and
inconsistently with my own professions. I will
go at once."</p>

<p>And bowing to her ladyship, who sought by a
look to restrain him, he departed.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, colonel, you have dealt
harshly with the young man," said her ladyship,
in a reproachful tone.</p>

<p>"I am compelled to act thus. Don't ask for
an explanation. I cannot give it."</p>

<p>"Well, look at this drawing. Pretty&mdash;ain't
it? Own that our young artist must be uncommonly
clever to make such a sketch as this off-hand.

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

I won't say anything about myself&mdash;though
I think I come out tolerably well&mdash;but
my pet Azo is perfection."</p>

<p>"Azo and his mistress are both excellently
done," said the colonel. "The fellow has undoubted
talent."</p>

<p>"I like the sketch so much that I mean to
have it framed, and hang it up in my boudoir."</p>

<p>"I was in hopes you were going to give it me.
Won't you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. If you want a copy, apply
to the artist. I don't mean to part with it.
What do you think I gave for it?"</p>

<p>"Can't say. It would be cheap at a guinea."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have it for twenty. The
gallant young artist would take no other payment
than one of my gloves."</p>

<p>"And you gave him your glove?" cried the
colonel, frowning.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

<p>"Where was the harm? I thought it a
romantic idea. Come, let us take a canter."</p>

<p>Away they went together at a swift pace down
a long, sweeping glade, disturbing the deer, and
then more slowly up the hill-side. By this time
the colonel had recovered his temper, but he did
not press his suit with the same ardour as heretofore.
For nearly an hour they continued riding
about the park, admiring its beauties, and the
extensive views it commanded. But they saw
nothing more of poor Hilary.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to the stables, where they
remained until the arrival of the whole party
from Hazlemere. Much to the colonel's relief,
Mrs. Sutton did not accompany her mistress on
this occasion. Lady Richborough, who was extremely
proud of the sketch, took care it should
be seen by everybody, and, of course, it was
generally admired. But no one, except Sir Charles,

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

made any inquiries about the artist. Curious to
know what had passed between Hilary and the
colonel, Mrs. Radcliffe questioned her ladyship
in private, and after hearing the details of the
interview, she could not help remarking, "I
think the colonel behaves very badly to the young
man."</p>

<p>"I gave him a hint to that effect," said her
ladyship. "Pray what has Mr. St. Ives done
to offend the colonel?"</p>

<p>"First, he was unlucky enough to be brought
to Hazlemere. But that was not the poor fellow's
own fault. I fear the colonel will never forgive
him."</p>

<p>"But why need he care for the colonel's forgiveness?
What is the colonel to him; or he
to the colonel?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to give an opinion on that
point."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

<p>"Well, all I can say is, that he would quite
cut the colonel out in a drawing-room. I am
sorry he is gone."</p>

<p>The interval between luncheon and dinner was
spent in billiards and croquet. In the latter pleasant
game Sir Charles was an expert, and luckily
May was equally fond of it, and played equally
well, so they were capitally matched.</p>

<p>A croquet party, on a smooth lawn, with a
tent close at hand, and a fine old mansion in the
back-ground, forms a pretty picture; and when
two such charming personages as May and
Myrtilla figure among the players, the picture
is prettier still. Both Sir Charles and Oswald
were quite sorry when it was time to dress for
dinner. Colonel Delacombe had never played at
croquet before, but he profited by the instructions
given him by her ladyship.</p>

<p>Sir Charles's cook being a cordon bleu the

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

dinner was perfect. Mr. Dancer had special
orders about the wine, and took particular care
of Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton. Old Madeira
and a bottle of Marshal Soult's sherry at dinner,
with a magnum of Laffitte after, made them both
superlatively happy.</p>

<p>After a little music, the whole party adjourned
to the billiard-room to witness a match between
Lady Richborough and the colonel, in which her
ladyship came off the victor. Apparently, the
colonel had quite forgotten the annoying incident
of the morning, and seemed just as much
enamoured as before.</p>

<p>To Sir Charles the day had been one of uninterrupted
bliss.</p>

<p>XII.</p>

<p class="small">THE INTERVIEW IN TRAFALGAR-SQUARE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> went smoothly with the lovers. The skies
were bright above them&mdash;their path was strewn
with flowers. Not a quarrel has to be recorded.
No untoward or unlooked-for event marred their
happiness.</p>

<p>Sir Charles's love amounted to idolatry. Never
happy, except in May's society&mdash;he was constantly
by her side. Whether she was in the
charming gardens of Hazlemere&mdash;at work in the
drawing-room&mdash;on horseback in the shady lanes,

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

or on the breezy common&mdash;whether she paced
the stately terrace at Boxgrove&mdash;strolled forth
into the park&mdash;or loitered amid the woods to
admire the deer&mdash;Sir Charles was near her.</p>

<p>Sometimes, Myrtilla was with them&mdash;but not
always. They were so wrapped up in each other,
that they had not a thought for her. She voted
them both intensely stupid, and told them so.
They only laughed, and gave small heed to what
she said.</p>

<p>Ah! those were halcyon days. If such days
would last, this earth would indeed be paradise.</p>

<p>But let us not disturb their happiness by any
gloomy anticipations of the future. Fortunately
for themselves, lovers never look beyond the
present hour. Love is eternal, they believe, and
will withstand the rudest shock. Dream on,
then, happy pair! We will not disturb you, or
chase away your visions of delight.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

<p>Nearly a month passed away thus blissfully.
Early and late, May and her lover were together.
Neither had a plan with which the
other was not connected. Each day, in Myrtilla's
estimation, they grew more stupid than they had
been the day before. She had no patience with
Charlie, and would no longer listen to his rhapsodies.
Impossible to live with them, if they
went on in this manner. However, she consoled
herself by thinking that they must soon come to
their senses, since it was arranged that the marriage
should take place early in July.</p>

<p>Sir Charles's engagement was vexatious to her
ladyship in one respect. It detained her at Boxgrove
longer than she liked. Her house in
Eaton-place was prepared for her. The season
had commenced. Lots of parties were going
on&mdash;dinners, balls, fancy balls, musical soir&eacute;es.
Every post brought her cards of invitation, and

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

notes from the nicest people imaginable, telling
her she was sadly missed, and imploring her to
come up to town without delay.</p>

<p>These notes drove her wild. She longed to be
seen in the Park, where a host of admirers were
on the look-out for her daily. She longed for the
box at the Opera, with which Sir Charles had
heretofore indulged her. She longed to see the
Derby run, but that she knew to be impossible.
However, she made up her mind to go to Ascot.
She thought Boxgrove the dullest place on earth.
Never had the gardens and the park looked more
exquisite. But what did she care for the gardens
and the park when everybody was in town! She
very much preferred Kensington Gardens and
Hyde Park. She had promised Charlie to stay,
and stay she would, if he insisted. But why not
let her take May to Eaton-place? May had never
yet had a season in town, and would enjoy a few
weeks' gaiety immensely. She ought to go out

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

a little before her marriage. Improvement was
scarcely possible, but a month in town would give
her the last finish.</p>

<p>Sir Charles shook his head, and entreated her
not to mention the subject to May. So far from
improving her, a month in town would take off
the freshness which was so charming to him, and
which, like the down on the peach, could never be
restored.</p>

<p>Myrtilla laughed at his objections, and told him
he was a selfish fellow, and wanted to keep May
all to himself, but she promised compliance.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of her brother's interdiction,
she <i>did</i> propose the plan to May, and held out so
many inducements that, as she expected, the young
girl was quite dazzled. On being consulted, Mrs.
Radcliffe gave her assent, and could see nothing
but what was delightful in the arrangement. Just
the thing for May.</p>

<p>Unable to offer a remonstrance. Sir Charles

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

reluctantly acquiesced. If he had a presentiment
of ill, he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>So it was settled that her ladyship and May
were to go up to Eaton-place, and arrangements
were made accordingly.</p>

<p>Where was Colonel Delacombe all this while?
Had he been rejected by Myrtilla, or given up all
idea of her? Neither one nor the other. He was
just as much enamoured as ever, but had not yet
proposed. His visit to Hazlemere did not extend
beyond the third day, when his attendance being
required at the Horse Guards, he hastened up to
town. He had accepted an invitation to Boxgrove,
but was obliged to postpone it. At least, he
pleaded a variety of unavoidable engagements.
Mrs. Radcliffe also was very urgent for his return
to Hazlemere. But he made the same excuses to
her.</p>

<p>In fact, he was trying, though ineffectually, as

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

it turned out, to conquer his passion for the fascinating
Myrtilla.</p>

<p>Now that the colonel was gone, her ladyship, by
way of amusing herself, would not have been indisposed
to renew her flirtation with Oswald; but
that disconsolate young fellow did not give her the
opportunity, but started off rather suddenly for
Bowdon, in Cheshire, where, it may be remembered,
his mother resided, in order to obtain some
solace under his bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton, however, was still at Hazlemere,
and since a younger man was not to be had, her
ladyship diverted herself by an occasional flirtation
with him. The old gentleman was almost beside
himself. No fool like an old fool.</p>

<p>Recent events had disturbed the calm tenor of
Mrs. Radcliffe's existence, and she could not regain
her tranquillity. The colonel had promised
to return immediately, but, as before mentioned,

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

he did not keep his word. He wrote her a short
apologetic note, the cold and distant tone of which
she did not like at all. He was still at the Langham,
and seemed well pleased with his quarters.
Mr. Thornton, at his daughter's request, ran up
to see him, but did not succeed in bringing him
back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton, too, was greatly changed. Her
deportment was different from what it used to
be, and at times she scarcely attempted to conceal
the aversion she entertained for her mistress.
Evidently, she could not forget the humiliation
she had experienced from Colonel Delacombe.
She could not endure to hear his name mentioned,
and rudely checked her mistress whenever she
alluded to him.</p>

<p>The housekeeper, however, manifested no reluctance
to talk about Hilary St. Ives. Indeed,
she often spoke of him, and with a tenderness

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

and affection that surprised Mrs. Radcliffe. For
reasons that need not be explained, she at once
took possession of the five hundred pounds, and
caused the clothes-chest, with all its contents, to be
removed to her own chamber.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Radcliffe seen her when she was
alone that night, or overheard some ejaculations
that escaped her, she would have been terrified.
The expression of her countenance showed that
she was under the empire of the worst passions.</p>

<p>All her machinations had come to naught. She
had foolishly persuaded herself that by her influence
over Mrs. Radcliffe, and the arts she
intended to employ with May, she could contrive
to bring about a union between the fair young
damsel and Hilary. This scheme, though promising
at first, proved abortive. May was quickly
snatched from her grasp. Then Colonel Delacombe
thwarted the remainder of her designs.

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

She hated him&mdash;but while hating him, she feared
him. We have seen that she shrank before his
glance, and that her rage was impotent against
him. All these things occupied her when she
was alone that night in her chamber, and gave
her countenance an almost fiendish expression.</p>

<p>Yet amidst the storm that agitated her, there
were internals of calm&mdash;amid the darkness occasional
gleams of light. Her mood instantly
changed when she thought of Hilary. Though
he had bestowed the affection which she felt to be
her due upon one who had no claim to it, and
whom she herself detested, she felt no anger
against him on that account. He had pained and
grieved her, but she forgave him. Her sole
anxiety was for his welfare. She would sacrifice
her life to serve him.</p>

<p>But these gentler feelings were not of long
duration. Evil passions gained the mastery, and

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

lashed her into fresh fury. Revenge was in her
power&mdash;terrible revenge!&mdash;and she would have
it. But the fitting moment for the execution of
her dark design had not yet arrived. She could
wait. Her victims could not escape her. Neither
should she swerve from her purpose.</p>

<p>Revenge was her last thought that night. Revenge
her first thought on the morrow.</p>

<p>But while she nourished these vindictive designs,
she continued to play her accustomed
part as well as her fierce temper would permit.
She did not always wear the mask of servility,
as we have said, in Mrs. Radcliffe's presence,
but at other times she was submissive enough,
and she was more than usually attentive to Mr.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Radcliffe's request she endeavoured
to trace out Hilary. She easily ascertained that
he stayed for two days at a small inn adjoining

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

Boxgrove Park, after which he started on foot
for London. She heard of him at Ashtead, and
learnt that he had crossed Wimbledon Common,
but what became of him afterwards she could
not discover. As well look for a needle in a
bottle of hay as try to find him in mighty London.
Yet she made the attempt.</p>

<p>An idea had occurred to her. The Exhibition
of the Royal Academy was then open, and
Hilary's tastes as an artist might not improbably
take him there. Slender as was the chance of
meeting him, it ought not to be neglected.
Accordingly she went to the Exhibition, and
spent nearly two hours in wandering through
the rooms, and examining&mdash;not the pictures&mdash;but
the groups collected before them. Nowhere could
she discover him.</p>

<p>Just as she was about to abandon her search,
he entered one of the larger rooms. His lofty

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

figure did not allow her to lose sight of him.
After a struggle with the throng, she reached
him. He was planted before a noble picture
by Maclise, and was studying it so intently, that
he did not perceive her. She touched his arm,
and, as he turned, his looks betokened the greatest
surprise.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would have avoided her, if he could&mdash;at
least, such was her impression. But he did
not refuse to attend her.</p>

<p>Quitting the picture galleries, they crossed the
street and descended to the spacious inclosure
of the square, where the fountains are wont to
play, and where, comparatively speaking, they
were alone.</p>

<p>As they paced to and fro, Mrs. Sutton commenced
by expressing her great satisfaction at
meeting with him, admitting that she had been
in quest of him, and after chiding him for his

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

sudden flight from Hazlemere, told him in the
kindest terms she could employ, that she was still
most anxious to serve him, and fondly hoped he
would not decline her assistance.</p>

<p>"Do not think me ungrateful for the kindness
you have shown me," he rejoined, "or for the
interest you still take in me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are too proud to place yourself under
an obligation to me. But a time may come when
you may be less scrupulous. Pray let me know
how I can communicate with you?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, but at last said,</p>

<p>"You must excuse me. I have reasons for
withholding my address."</p>

<p>"You believe that I am acting for others.
You are wrong. I am personally interested in
you&mdash;personally, I repeat. Do not disregard my
friendship. I have the power and the will to
serve you. In proof, let me tell you that it was

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

I who sent the money and the clothes which you
supposed came from Colonel Delacombe."</p>

<p>"Then the letter I received was written by
you?" he cried, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It was. I adopted that roundabout course
because I thought it would be most agreeable to
your feelings. You will understand my motives
better one of these days. Have I said enough
to remove your scruples? I have the money
with me, and entreat your acceptance of it&mdash;as a
gift&mdash;as a loan."</p>

<p>"I can only accept it on the condition of your
giving me a full explanation of this seeming
mystery. What am I to you that you take such
interest in me?"</p>

<p>"What are you to me?" she cried, stopping,
and regarding him with inexpressible tenderness.</p>

<p>She seemed about to pour forth the secrets of
her heart, but suddenly checking herself, she

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

added, "No&mdash;no&mdash;you must not ask me why I
act thus. I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"You have said too much," he exclaimed. "I
have a right to further explanation."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sutton's momentary weakness had
passed.</p>

<p>"Be content with what you have learnt. Will
you take the money?"</p>

<p>Hilary shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know from whom it comes," he rejoined.
"You are employed by Mrs. Radcliffe. You act
your part admirably. But you cannot impose
upon me."</p>

<p>This was too much. Mrs. Sutton struggled
hard with herself, but could not repress an outburst
of emotion.</p>

<p>"You do me a great injustice," she ejaculated,
in a broken voice. "But I forgive you. Farewell."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

<p>"Stay," he cried, detaining her. "Do not quit
me in anger."</p>

<p>"In anger!" she exclaimed. "If you could
read my heart you would find no anger there&mdash;but
much grief."</p>

<p>Just then an elderly man descended the broad
stone steps leading from the street, and walked
slowly towards them. He had been watching
them for some minutes from above, without attracting
their attention. He was high-shouldered,
and from his halting gait appeared to be lame.
Though respectably dressed in black, he had not
altogether the air of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Who is that coming towards us?" cried Mrs.
Sutton. "He seems to know you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Courtenay, of Exeter," replied Hilary
"He was to meet me at the Exhibition. I
suppose he has seen me talking with you."</p>

<p>"Is that Mr. Courtenay?" she exclaimed, in

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

alarm. "I must begone. For Heaven's sake do
not tell him who I am. Write to me&mdash;write to
me, I beseech you, if you have any love for me.
Attend to my caution. Farewell!"</p>

<p>And regardless of the construction that might
be put upon her conduct, she hurried off to the
lower part of the square.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch13">

<p>XIII.</p>

<p class="small">MAY'S FIRST BALL IN TOWN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> her return to Hazlemere, Mrs. Sutton
informed her mistress of her meeting with Hilary
at the Exhibition, but she gave no details of the
interview, merely stating that he had refused all
offers of assistance, and had declined to acquaint
her with his address. She made no mention
whatever of Mr. Courtenay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was not without hope that Hilary
would comply with her parting request, and was

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

sorely disappointed when no letter came from
him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe could no longer share her griefs
with the housekeeper. Vexed at the colonel's
prolonged absence, she addressed two or three
reproachful letters to him, begging him to come
down instantly&mdash;if only for a day&mdash;and if this
was absolutely impossible, entreating him to send
her a few lines calculated to dissipate the dreadful
ennui under which she laboured. To her infinite
annoyance, these letters remained unanswered.
It did not occur to her that they had never been
posted.</p>

<p>The result of all this worry upon Mrs. Radcliffe
was to rouse her in some degree from her indolent
habits. One morning, to her husband's great surprise,
she announced that she should like to spend
a few weeks in town. She wished to be on the
spot&mdash;to see how things went on in Eaton-place.

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

May was inexperienced, and a little judicious
maternal advice might now and then be necessary.
Lady Richborough was everything that could be
desired as a chaperon, but occasions might arise
when an older head would be useful. Feeling
this, and ready to make any sacrifice for her child,
she had resolved to go to town, not for the purpose
of interfering with Lady Richborough's arrangements,
or going out with her ladyship and May,
but simply with the design of watching over the
dear child, and seeing that all went on properly.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe entirely approved of the plan, and
so did Mr. Thornton, who was present at the time.
They fully appreciated the sacrifice of her own
inclinations which they felt she was making.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from any other considerations,
Mr. Radcliffe told her that the change could not
fail to be beneficial to herself, while he hoped and
believed she would enjoy a short visit to town

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

when the season was at its height, whether she
mixed with society or not.</p>

<p>Next day the two old gentlemen went up to
town, and, with the assistance of Colonel Delacombe,
whom they called upon, were fortunately
enabled to secure a very charming house in Upper
Brook-street.</p>

<p>The colonel sent a message to Mrs. Radcliffe
to say that he was enchanted by her determination,
and hoped she would like the house he had been
instrumental in choosing for her. He appeared
to be overwhelmed by engagements. This might,
perhaps, account for his inexplicable silence. Mrs.
Radcliffe was willing to believe so, and quite recovered
her spirits.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton was pleased with the arrangement.
It suited her plans.</p>

<p>But May was greatly surprised by it. That
mamma, who had never left home for years, and

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

who had often declared that nothing should induce
her to leave home again, should propose a visit to
town, seemed the most unlikely thing possible.
But unlikely things are just the things that always
happen, as Myrtilla told her. Of course May was
delighted. Myrtilla <i>said</i> she was delighted. And
Sir Charles really <i>was</i> delighted. On all accounts,
it rejoiced him that the family were going up to
town.</p>

<p>May's d&eacute;but in fashionable society took place on
the very night of her arrival in town, at Lady
Oldcastle's ball at Prince's-gate, and created an
extraordinary sensation. Everybody admitted that
she was by far the loveliest girl that the season
had as yet produced, and it did not seem at all
likely that she could be eclipsed. Such charming
features&mdash;such a delicately fair complexion&mdash;such
soft blue eyes&mdash;such superb blonde tresses&mdash;and
such an exquisite figure had never been seen

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

before. And then she looked so fresh and unsophisticated&mdash;so
full of natural enjoyment&mdash;that
twenty blas&eacute; young fellows, proof against ordinary
attractions, were smitten at first sight, and driven
to despair when they learnt she was already
engaged. All eyes followed her as she moved
through the rooms, and though there was some
disposition to criticise her among mammas and
chaperons jealous of their daughters' and charges'
beauty, no real fault could be found with her.
The worst that could be said was, that she was
not quite accustomed to society. However, since
no rivalry was to be expected from her, envy was
silenced, and her surpassing loveliness universally
admitted. Had she been in the market, the judgment
pronounced upon her would have been very
different. Her movements in the dance were so
graceful that she caused a perfect fureur, and
there was a host of aspirants for the honour of

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

her hand. She liked dancing, and danced a good
deal&mdash;almost every dance, we are afraid to say&mdash;and
had the best partners in the room.</p>

<p>"You will fatigue yourself to death, my love,"
observed Lady Richborough. "You should follow
my example, and never exceed a couple of valses.
Recollect that you have three balls to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>May was about to follow the advice, but her
partner, who was no other than Captain de Vesci,
Colonel Delacombe's friend, looked so blank and
disappointed, that she took compassion upon him,
and was instantly involved in the mazy ring.</p>

<p>"Lucky Sir Charles is not here," remarked
her ladyship to Colonel Delacombe, who was
seated beside her on a sofa in one of the smaller
rooms, "I wonder what he would say to all this?"</p>

<p>"He would be charmed, of course, to see the
object of his choice so much admired."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said her ladyship,
smiling. "Sir Charles is of a remarkably jealous
nature. If he could have his own way, I don't
think he would let May go out at all."</p>

<p>"You amaze me!" cried the colonel. "I
fancied he knew your sex better, and had more
reliance on himself. Why should a woman, who
is calculated to shine in society, be excluded from
it? The plan never answers. I have known
several young married people, who thought they
could live for themselves alone, and were foolish
enough to try the experiment. What was the
result? Most of them, if not all, are now separated.
If you want a woman to run away from
you, shut her up. That's an infallible maxim.
For my part," he continued, looking earnestly at
her, in order to give due force to his words,
"nothing would delight me so much as to see my
wife admired. I should feel myself flattered by
the compliments paid her."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

<p>"But how can you tell, colonel, since you have
never been married?" observed her ladyship,
archly.</p>

<p>"I can't speak practically. But I know myself
sufficiently to be certain as to how I should be
affected under such circumstances. Homage to
my wife I should regard as homage to myself.
If her charms and accomplishments excited admiration,
I should feel proud of her, not jealous.
Other people may covet the treasure I possess,
but that would only make me value it the more.
If we have a priceless gem, we do not hide it,
but allow it to be seen, and the admiration it
excites is in the highest degree gratifying to us.
Such would be my conduct towards my wife&mdash;if
I had one." And he again looked at her ladyship
expressively.</p>

<p>"Your notions are strictly orthodox, colonel,
and meet my entire approval," rejoined her ladyship.

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

"I wonder you do not give effect to
them."</p>

<p>"I have no chance of doing so. I am too
fastidious to choose any other than a young and
handsome woman, and such a woman would not
be likely to accept an old scarred soldier like
myself, while plenty of good-looking young fellows
are to be had. I ought to have married long
ago, but I have had no time to look out for a
wife, and in India there is but little choice."</p>

<p>"I am surprised at that. I should have thought
just the contrary. But what prevents you from
choosing now? There are pretty girls in abundance
here."</p>

<p>"A pretty girl would not suit me. I must
have something brilliant."</p>

<p>"A jewel such as you described just now?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"That is not so easily found. Diamonds are
not to be met with every day."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

<p>"I have been singularly fortunate," said the
colonel. "I have discovered one of inestimable
worth."</p>

<p>Her ladyship was quite fluttered. She could
not affect to misunderstand him.</p>

<p>But before anything more could be said by
the colonel, a very unseasonable interruption was
offered by a handsome, though rather effeminate-looking
young man, with a pale complexion and
light flowing whiskers, who begged her ladyship,
in drawling tones, to present him to Miss Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Charming creature!" he cried. "Should like
immensely to valse with her."</p>

<p>"No chance to-night, dear Lord Robert," she
rejoined. "I know she's engaged four or five
deep."</p>

<p>"Deuced unlucky that! Will your ladyship
give me a galoppe?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, please. I'm tired. Besides, I
want to take Miss Radcliffe away if I can."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

<p>"What, so early! and before she has fulfilled
her engagements!" cried Lord Robert Tadcaster.
"I must protest against such cruelty. Ah, here
she comes!"</p>

<p>As he spoke May was brought back by Captain
de Vesci. Lord Robert was presented, but
May was unable to dance with him for the reasons
assigned by Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>"Have you had enough, my love?" said her
ladyship. "Recollect you are on your good behaviour
to-night. Sir Charles will never forgive
me if I allow you to remain out late."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to go," said May. "But
unluckily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind your engagements. They don't
signify in the least. Lord Robert will give you
his arm."</p>

<p>Attended by the colonel, and followed by May
and the young nobleman, her ladyship then

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

quitted the ball-room without taking leave of
Lady Oldcastle.</p>

<p>Lady Richborough's box at the Opera was the
general resort of the golden youth of the day.
It was full of them. Driven to the pit or to
some other box, Sir Charles had the annoyance
of witnessing the attentions paid his fianc&eacute;e by
a succession of impertinent coxcombs.</p>

<p>How often he wished himself back at Boxgrove!
and how firmly he resolved that May
should never have an opera-box.</p>

<p>But this was the slightest of his grievances.
The same set of coxcombs who beset Lady Richborough's
opera-box met her ladyship and May&mdash;as
if by appointment&mdash;during their morning
ride in Hyde Park, and would not be dismissed.
They did not care for Sir Charles's black looks.
Chief among these pests were Lord Robert Tadcaster
and Captain de Vesci. Sometimes, Sir

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

Charles was exasperated to such a degree by their
impertinences that he would have affronted them
but for the interference of Colonel Delacombe.</p>

<p>The colonel, who was now recognised by Sir
Charles as his sister's suitor, always attended her
ladyship during her promenades, and indeed was
generally with her in the evening as well as during
the morning.</p>

<p>Seeing, or fancying they saw, how matters
stood, people invited him to all the parties to
which her ladyship was bidden. The colonel,
therefore, was in immense request, and became
extremely and deservedly popular. Attentions
paid to her ladyship never put him out. He resigned
his seat by her side without a murmur,
or fell back if a gay cavalier, whose chat he
knew would amuse her, wanted to join her in
Rotten-row. Thus it will be seen that he acted
up to his own precepts, and would fain have instilled
them into Sir Charles.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

<p>"Jealousy is an absurd passion," he said, "and
always makes the person who yields to it ridiculous.
Even if I were fool enough to be
jealous, I would take good care not to let my
wife perceive it. A woman always despises a
jealous husband, and not unfrequently ends by
giving him real ground for jealousy. Take my
advice, and do not give yourself the slightest
concern about these imbeciles. May is totally
indifferent to them. She is amused by their
bavardage, no doubt, but she rates them at their
real worth. Do not make them of importance by
quarrelling with any of them. Treat them as a
pack of fools, and laugh at them as I do."</p>

<p>Very sensible advice. But Sir Charles could
not follow it. He had many a severe trial to
undergo, but one of the worst was at Ascot.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch14">

<p>XIV.</p>

<p class="small">ASCOT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Richborough</span>, as we are aware, had
resolved to go to Ascot. Sir Charles objected,
but his objections were quickly overruled. The
colonel, who had become a sort of Mentor to
him, counselled him to give way with a good
grace, and he did so. May said it was so kind
of him. She longed, of all things, to go to Ascot,
of which she had heard so much. New dresses
were ordered&mdash;new bonnets&mdash;and all preparations
made.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe no sooner heard of the plan
than she determined to join the party. She had
not witnessed a race for upwards of twenty years.
At any risk she must go. So <i>she</i> ordered new
dresses and new bonnets.</p>

<p>The party was further increased by Oswald
and his mother, who had just come to town. Of
the latter we must say a word. Mrs. Woodcot
was not so handsome as her sister, but had very
pleasing features, fine eyes, a very good figure,
and very agreeable manners. Very well dressed,
too, for a country lady.</p>

<p>Sir Charles made all necessary arrangements,
he engaged rooms at the Castle Hotel, Windsor,
for the whole party, which of course comprised
the colonel and Mr. Thornton. Open carriages
were at their disposal, and in these they drove
daily through the park to the racecourse. The
weather being luckily propitious, nothing could be
more enjoyable.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

<p>At all times the drive through this magnificent
park is delightful, but in Ascot time it
is peculiarly exhilarating. Every turn-out looks
well. Teams bowl along merrily. Postilions
appear conscious of their own importance.
Everybody is well dressed and in high spirits.</p>

<p>Our friends were capitally turned out. Four
splendid horses attached to each carriage bore
them along gallantly. Lady Richborough and
May, attended by Sir Charles and the colonel,
occupied the first carriage. Both ladies looked
ravishingly beautiful in their charming summer
toilettes. May was full of excitement and
delight&mdash;perfectly enchanted by the novel
scene.</p>

<p>But the comparative quietude of the forest,
with its long avenues, its grand old trees, and
stretching glades, was soon exchanged for the
crowd, confusion, and bewildering noises of the
racecourse. What stoppages! what vociferations!

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

What strange-looking people! But what excitement!</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, who came in the second carriage
with Mrs. Woodcot, was quite terrified,
half-screamed at every turn, and felt certain she
should be upset. But both carriages got safely
into the place reserved for them, which was the
best place possible, being just opposite the Grand
Stand. Then the poor lady could now look about
her with comfort, and survey the surprising scene.
She owned that it far surpassed all her preconceived
notions. And if she was astonished, what
wonder that her daughter, to whom such a
spectacle was an absolute novelty, should be
greatly excited!</p>

<p>London had sent forth all its flower of fashion
to the course. It had sent forth multitudes of
others who had no pretension to rank or fashion,
but still the aristocratic clement was clearly perceptible
in the crowd.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

<p>London had likewise sent forth all its beauty&mdash;or
the best part of it. Hundreds of lovely
women were to be seen in the long lines of carriages
drawn up near the ropes. Hundreds of
others, equally lovely, could be observed on the
lawn and on the seats of the Grand Stand, looking
in their gay attire, and with their wonderfully-varied
parasols, like a vast parterre of
flowers. But we unhesitatingly declare, that none
so lovely could be discerned, either in the Grand
Stand or elsewhere, as in the carriage containing
Lady Richborough and May. This was proved
by the universal admiration they excited.</p>

<p>To this sort of admiration Sir Charles could
not object, and he was rather gratified by it&mdash;but
he was very soon put out of humour.</p>

<p>The same set of coxcombs who had been his
bane in Rotten-row, at the Opera, and at many
an evening party, speedily discovered the carriage,

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

and invaded it. There they were monopolising
May, laughing, jesting in the most impertinently
familiar manner, talking about the horses,
and offering bets of gloves.</p>

<p>In order to get rid of his tormentors. Sir Charles
proposed that the ladies should go over to the
Grand Stand, and take possession of their box.
Agreed to. But the plaguy fellows were not to be
shaken off. Lord Robert Tadcaster immediately
offered his arm to May, and De Vesci insisted
upon escorting Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"Confound their impertinence!" cried Sir
Charles. "I can't stand it any longer."</p>

<p>"It is a bore," rejoined the colonel. "But
pray keep quiet."</p>

<p>We shall pass by what happened in the Grand
Stand. Sir Charles's temper was certainly not
improved. After the race for the Gold Cup had
been run, they returned to the carriage for

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

luncheon, and the same sort of thing occurred
again&mdash;a degree worse, perhaps. Sir Charles and
the colonel were both excluded from the carriage,
and their seats occupied by the odious De Vesci,
and the still more odious Lord Robert, who
laughed and chatted with the ladies, while they
quaffed the iced champagne and helped to
demolish the lobster salad and pigeon pie. Sir
Charles was so disgusted that he went to have
luncheon with Mrs. Radcliffe, and the colonel
went with him.</p>

<p>They had not been gone many minutes when
a very tawny, but handsome gipsy made her way
to the carriage, and fixing her black eyes on May,
addressed her in the customary formula,</p>

<p>"Let me tell you your fortune, my pretty
young lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, do let her tell it you, Miss Radcliffe,"
cried Lord Robert, slipping a sovereign into the

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

gipsy's hand. "I long so much to hear it. I
wonder whether she'll tell it right."</p>

<p>"My words will come true for sartin," rejoined
the gipsy, confidently. "But no one but
the young lady must hear 'em. Let me look at
your hand, my pretty lady."</p>

<p>After a moment's inspection of May's white
palm, she whispered in the young lady's ear,
"Look over my shoulder, my dear&mdash;look straight
afore you."</p>

<p>May complied, and perceived amidst the crowd,
on the further side of the ropes, a tall young man,
who was watching the scene. She could not
mistake him. It was Hilary St, Ives.</p>

<p>"That's him as you are to marry," said the
gipsy, in the same low tone as before.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch15">

<p>XV.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. SUTTON'S INTERVIEW WITH LADY RICHBOROUGH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> uttering her strange prediction, the
gipsy hurried away, refusing to satisfy Lord
Robert's curiosity, which was greatly excited by
May's blushes and confusion. The cunning fortune-teller
had spoken in so low a tone that he
could not catch a word she said.</p>

<p>When May looked up again, Hilary had disappeared,
and she saw no more of him during the
day.</p>

<p>Though quite as curious as Lord Robert to

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

learn what had occurred, Lady Richborough made
no remark at the time, but when she and May
were alone together in the evening, she questioned
her on the subject, and laughed heartily at the
explanation.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is all," she exclaimed. "I fancied
the gipsy had promised you to Lord Robert, for
I saw him bribe her, but I suppose she was better
paid by Hilary St. Ives. So you are to marry
him, eh? I wouldn't give much for his chance,
notwithstanding the prophecy."</p>

<p>"Nor I. But you must own it is a strange
circumstance," observed May.</p>

<p>"Not so strange as it appears. The gipsy was
in league with Hilary, who told her what to say,
and placed himself where he could be readily
descried. I am glad you did not mention the
matter to Sir Charles. It would only have put
him out."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

<p>"Poor fellow! I fear he was greatly put out
before that. Dearest Myrtilla, I cannot persevere
in the part you have forced me to play, now that
I find how much it pains him. Do give that tiresome
Lord Robert a hint, or allow me to do so."</p>

<p>"Not yet, my love&mdash;not yet, or you will defeat
my plan. Sir Charles must and shall be cured of
his jealousy."</p>

<p>"But is this the way to cure him? I constantly
expect to see him break out into a furious
passion."</p>

<p>"Just what I want," said her ladyship, smiling.
"Then we will make him heartily ashamed of
himself, and his cure will be accomplished."</p>

<p>"But if he is no longer jealous, I shall think
he no longer loves me."</p>

<p>"My dear child, it is a mistake to suppose that
a jealous man is the most devoted. He is simply
intensely selfish and exacting. Sir Charles entertains

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

the preposterous notion, of which I intend
to disabuse him, that he is to have you all to
himself. Were he allowed his own way, he would
exclude you altogether from society, and shut
you up at Boxgrove, where you would be as dull
as if you were immured in a convent."</p>

<p>"It would be no punishment to me to be shut
up, as you term it, at Boxgrove. Indeed, I should
prefer it to the rackety life I am now leading.
You will laugh at me, I know, Myrtilla, but I
declare I am not half so happy as I used to be
when rambling daily about the park with dear
Sir Charles. How things have altered since we
came to town! When we ride out together in
Rotten-row, Sir Charles's place is immediately
taken by some one whom he dislikes. Very often
we do not exchange more than half a dozen words
during a whole evening. I find it very hard to
obey your instructions. Sir Charles, as you know,

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

doesn't dance, and I am sure&mdash;though he never
says so&mdash;that he thinks I dance a great deal too
much. My conduct must appear shocking to him,
and though you find plenty of excuses for me, I
can find none for myself."</p>

<p>"Having put yourself in my hands, you must
do as you are bidden. By-and-by, when you understand
things better, you will be grateful for
my good advice. Mrs. Radcliffe entirely approves
of the plan I am pursuing, and is infinitely obliged
to me. She sees as plainly as I do that Sir
Charles's design is to keep you in the country.
Now I won't have such a charming creature buried
alive to please him. You are formed for society,
and shall not be withdrawn from it with my consent.
As May Radcliffe, you are immensely admired,
but you will be ten times more admired
as Lady Ilminster. I know from experience the
effect that a lovely young married woman of a

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

certain rank can produce. She carries all before
her. Every house worth entering is thrown open
to her. She is queen of every f&ecirc;te, and a hundred
soupirants follow in her train."</p>

<p>"A brilliant picture," observed May, smiling.
"But it does not dazzle me. I must repeat that
I am unequal to the part I am playing. I was
really unhappy this morning when Sir Charles
left the carriage, and would have recalled him if I
could. I thought Lord Robert perfectly detestable,
and wished him at Jericho, or anywhere else,
except Ascot."</p>

<p>"He has been very useful to us in our little
plot," observed her ladyship. "You need not give
yourself the least concern about a butterfly that
can be brushed off at any moment."</p>

<p>They then separated for the night. May was
tired, but sleep did not visit her so soon as it used
to do, when she was better satisfied with herself.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

<p>Things went on pretty much as they had done
for another fortnight. Morning f&ecirc;tes, concerts,
grand dinners, and grander balls succeeded each
other without interruption, and at all these Lady
Richborough and May assisted.</p>

<p>Apparently, Sir Charles was more reconciled
to his position, and allowed no outward manifestation
of annoyance to escape him. In fact, he
appeared indifferent&mdash;though this was far from
being the case. Had he become philosophical?
Or had he penetrated his sister's design? Myrtilla
triumphantly declared that they had brought him
to his senses; but May's uneasiness increased, and
she began seriously to apprehend that she had lost
his affections.</p>

<p>Meantime, the business arrangements connected
with the approaching nuptials had been going on
quietly and satisfactorily. Settlements&mdash;those
dangerous rocks upon which so many fair barks

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

bound for the matrimonial haven have split&mdash;offered
no difficulties in this case. All was plain
sailing. Sir Charles had announced his intention
of settling five thousand a year upon his intended,
and his estates were to he charged to that
amount. Not to be behindhand in liberality, Mr.
Radcliffe agreed to settle another five thousand a
year upon his daughter. These arrangements were
entrusted to Mr. Thornton, who acted as professional
adviser to both parties, and declared he had
never been more agreeably employed.</p>

<p>When the deeds were completed, and only
lacked the necessary signatures, he told May with
a chuckle, that she would soon have ten thousand
a year. "And a very nice little income you will
find it," he added. "Don't forget that you owe it
to grandpapa."</p>

<p>As Colonel Delacombe seemed quite at home at
Eaton-place, as he was consulted on all matters

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

by Lady Richborough, and occasionally did the
honours for her, it is not surprising Mrs. Radcliffe
should conclude they were engaged, but she
could not get either of them to admit that they
were so. The colonel always laughed when rallied
on the subject, and declared she did him too
much honour. On one point Mrs. Radcliffe was
perfectly satisfied. She could not, she was convinced,
have found a better chaperon for her
daughter than Lady Richborough. May's triumphs
delighted her, and recalled the days when she
herself had been universally admired. Moreover,
she entirely agreed with her ladyship that Sir
Charles must be cured of his absurd jealousy. A
different opinion, however, prevailed among the
rest of the family. Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton
thought May's conduct very foolish, and were
both apprehensive lest Sir Charles should break
off the match.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, it will be seen, did not enjoy her

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

visit to town. Under the circumstances, it was
impossible she could do so. She had calculated
upon the colonel's attentions, and though provoked
by his neglect was compelled to dissemble her
rage and disappointment. She was also obliged
to put on a mask of friendship for Lady Richborough,
whom she detested.</p>

<p>Of late, as we know, she had ceased to impart
her griefs to Mrs. Sutton, because she met with
little sympathy from her; but one day, being
greatly exasperated, she could not help observing
to the housekeeper that she felt certain the colonel
was about to marry Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>"I do not think the marriage will take place,"
observed Mrs. Sutton, with a singular smile.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Mrs. Radcliffe,
curiously.</p>

<p>"I have my own reasons for thinking so," replied
the other.</p>

<p>"Whatever your reasons may be, you are

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

entirely wrong, Sutton," said her mistress. "I
can no longer delude myself with the notion that
Seymour is a model of constancy. He is faithless
as the rest of his sex. He has contrived to
captivate Lady Richborough, and she has accepted
him."</p>

<p>"Do you only suspect this?" said the housekeeper,
looking at her inquiringly; "or are you
sure?"</p>

<p>"I have not questioned her ladyship on the
subject, Sutton, but her manner towards Seymour
satisfies me of the correctness of my surmise.
Perfidious wretch! I could kill him."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> kill him!" exclaimed the housekeeper,
scornfully. "You have not the courage to do it."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I have not," observed Mrs.
Radcliffe. "I have not the resolution of a Spanish
or Italian woman. But I should have no compunction
in breaking off the match if I had the
power."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

<p>The housekeeper smiled bitterly, and said,</p>

<p>"I know a way to prevent it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe looked at her incredulously.</p>

<p>"Entreaties are ineffectual with Seymour, I
have tried them. He is immovable."</p>

<p>"Wait till I have had an interview with Lady
Richborough, and you will then see whether he
will persist."</p>

<p>"We must consider before you take this step,
Sutton."</p>

<p>"No consideration is required. For Lady
Richborough's sake the step <i>must</i> be taken, and
without delay."</p>

<p>Next morning, at a tolerably early hour, Mrs.
Sutton repaired to Eaton-place, and after a little
delay was shown into Lady Richborough's dressing-room.
Her ladyship had just finished her
toilette, and professing to be delighted to see the
housekeeper, begged her to be seated.</p>

<p>Without allowing Mrs. Sutton to enter upon

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

her business, she gave her a very lively description
of the balls at which she and May had been
present on the previous nights, and would have
gone on much longer in the same strain had she
not perceived that the housekeeper was becoming
impatient. She then stopped suddenly, and said,</p>

<p>"I suppose you bring me some message from
dear Mrs. Radcliffe?"</p>

<p>"No. I have taken the liberty of waiting
upon your ladyship at this early hour because
I have something important&mdash;very important to
yourself&mdash;to communicate."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Lady Richborough, rather
alarmed by her manner.</p>

<p>"I must prepare your ladyship for a disagreeable,
and perhaps painful piece of intelligence,"
pursued Mrs. Sutton. "The disclosure I am
about to make is calculated to destroy many
agreeable illusions, but it cannot be withheld."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

<p>"In Heaven's name, what is it? Don't put me
on the rack."</p>

<p>"Before entering into any explanation, I must
venture to ask your ladyship a question to which
I trust you will not refuse me a precise answer.
Is there any truth in the report that you are
about to be united to Colonel Delacombe?"</p>

<p>"I now see your errand, Sutton," cried her
ladyship, laughing. "Though you deny it, I am
sure you have been sent by Mrs. Radcliffe to
put that question to me."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No one has
sent me. No one is aware of my visit. No one
will hear of it from me. If you will give me
an assurance that an engagement does not subsist
between you and Colonel Delacombe nothing
more need be said."</p>

<p>"As I cannot exactly give you such an assurance,
Sutton, you must assume what you please."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

<p>"Then I am bound to tell your ladyship that
if such a marriage is contemplated, it can never
take place."</p>

<p>Myrtilla turned excessively pale, and after a
moment's silence, said,</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Sutton? Is there any
serious impediment?"</p>

<p>Laying her hand upon her ladyship's arm, and
fixing her eyes full upon her, the housekeeper
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"An insuperable impediment. He is already
married."</p>

<p>Myrtilla uttered an exclamation of surprise
and anger. Shaking off the housekeeper's grasp,
she cried, with great indignation,</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sutton! I won't believe it. Is
it likely that Colonel Delacombe&mdash;a man of unquestionable
honour&mdash;would, if he were married,
pay his addresses to a lady, and seek to obtain

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

her hand? I can guess the author of the
calumny. Tell her I disbelieve it and despise it."</p>

<p>"Again I must set your ladyship right," rejoined
Mrs. Sutton, calmly. "I alone am responsible
for the statement, and I affirm its truth."</p>

<p>Her manner carried conviction with it, and
frightened Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>"If necessary, I am prepared to substantiate
my assertion," continued Mrs. Sutton, after a
pause. "But Colonel Delacombe will not dare
to deny the accusation."</p>

<p>"We shall see," cried Lady Richborough.
"Oh! Sutton, you have made me wretched&mdash;most
wretched."</p>

<p>"Better your ladyship should suffer now than
later on, when the error would be irreparable."</p>

<p>"Yes, if what you say is true, you have indeed
saved me from a terrible fate. But since you
have said so much, you must tell me all. Where

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

is his wife? What is she? Why has he separated
from her?"</p>

<p>"Your ladyship must not question me further,"
rejoined the housekeeper, in a troubled tone. "I
have told you all that is necessary. Thus much
I will say. It was a most unlucky union, and
attended with sad consequences."</p>

<p>"Has he abandoned his wife?"</p>

<p>"Ask him. Perhaps he may tell you. I cannot.
It is a very painful history. Nor should any
allusion have been made to it but for present
circumstances. My errand is done. I wish your
ladyship good morning."</p>

<p>"Stay!" cried Myrtilla, detaining her. "A
strange suspicion crosses me. Pray satisfy my
doubts."</p>

<p>"I must again refer you to the colonel," rejoined
Mrs. Sutton, evasively. "I have nothing
more to disclose. You are now in possession of
his secret, and can use it as you please."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch16">

<p>XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE COLONEL'S EXPLANATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Richborough</span> would not see the colonel
that day. She feigned sudden indisposition, and
kept her own room. Her first idea was to consult
with Sir Charles, and leave him to take such steps
as he might deem advisable in a matter so delicate,
but having still some doubts as to the truth of the
housekeeper's statement, she resolved&mdash;after long
deliberation&mdash;to question the colonel herself.</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;in consequence of her ladyship's

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

supposed illness&mdash;all the arrangements for the day
had to be given up. The troop of young men who
expected to join the fair equestrians in Rotten-row
were doomed to disappointment. The Opera was
a blank, since the pleasantest box in the house
was empty that night. Lady Fitton had to fill
up two places at her dinner, and Lady Louisa
Legge's ball was deprived of its chief attractions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe, who had heard of the housekeeper's
visit, called in Eaton-place, and hearing
that her ladyship was indisposed, expressed great
anxiety to see her, but was not admitted to her
room.</p>

<p>Quite unaware of the thunder-cloud hanging
over his head. Colonel Delacombe came as usual,
and was sorry to hear of her ladyship's illness, but
any uneasiness he might have felt was dispelled
by May, who told him that Myrtilla was only
suffering from fatigue, and would be perfectly restored

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

after a few hours' rest. Satisfied with this
assurance, he gave himself no further concern,
but proceeded to his club.</p>

<p>Next morning, when he again presented himself
in Eaton-place, he learnt that her ladyship
was better, and was at once shown to her boudoir.
He could not perceive any traces of illness in her
countenance, but, on the contrary, thought her
looking remarkably well, and told her so. She
was writing a letter, and begged him to excuse
her for a moment while she finished it. This
gave her time to arrange her ideas.</p>

<p>When she addressed him, he saw in a moment
that something was wrong. She did not waste
time in any preliminary remarks, but said,</p>

<p>"In consequence of a communication made to
me yesterday by Mrs. Sutton&mdash;the nature of which
you will easily guess&mdash;I had resolved not to see
you again, but to leave Sir Charles to acquaint

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

you with my determination, together with my
reasons for it, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly glad you did not do so,
Myrtilla," he interrupted. "What has Mrs. Sutton
told you"?"</p>

<p>Myrtilla hesitated, and the colour fled from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"If what she says is true, you have no right
to pay your addresses to me or to any other lady.
She affirms that you are already married. Can
you give me your word of honour that there is
no truth whatever in her statement?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied in a sombre tone, "I cannot
do that."</p>

<p>"Then you admit the charge?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"How am I to reconcile these contradictions?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Myrtilla. The disclosure I am
about to make has been delayed too long&mdash;but on

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

my honour I intended to make it. How the secret,
which I though confined to my own breast, has
come to Mrs. Sutton's knowledge I do not pretend
to guess. It is certain that she has learnt it,
and now uses it for her own vindictive purposes.
I will be as brief in my narration as I can, and I
beg you not to interrupt me. When I first entered
the army, and had little or no experience of your
sex, I was entrapped into a marriage with an
artful woman. I do not attempt to extenuate my
conduct. All the reproaches you could heap upon
me would not equal the reproaches I have heaped
upon myself. I was mad&mdash;that is my sole excuse.
I soon discovered how completely I had been
duped. The perfidious wretch, with whom I had
unfortunately connected myself, did not love me&mdash;did
not even respect my honour. She had
basely deceived me. Before I married her, she
had a lover&mdash;and ere long, as I subsequently

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

ascertained, she renewed her intimacy with him,
if she had ever discontinued it. These particulars
must shock you, but I cannot withhold them.
They are necessary for my justification. The
woman's temper was frightful. At times she was
a perfect fiend&mdash;a terror to her mother, with
whom she lived&mdash;and I confess that I myself
was afraid of her, for, in her transports of fury,
my life was not safe. Upon one occasion, indeed,
she snatched up a knife, and would have stabbed
me if I had not wrested the weapon from her.
It is scarcely necessary to say that the degrading
alliance I had formed was kept secret. It was
not even known to my intimates. However, I
was not troubled with her long. When I went
to Ireland with my regiment, I left her with her
mother. She expressed no desire to accompany
me&mdash;probably, for the reasons I have already
given. I had no correspondence with her, and

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

heard nothing of her for months. I then only
learnt her fate from a newspaper."</p>

<p>"What was her fate?" demanded Myrtilla, who
had listened with deep interest to his recital.</p>

<p>"She was drowned with her paramour while
crossing the Severn during a gale. The ferry-boat
was upset, and all on board perished. Justice
overtook her. She had deserted her mother,
whose heart was broken by her misconduct, and
who died soon afterwards. Can you wonder that
I should desire to bury such a deplorable history
in oblivion? Long years have passed since the
events took place, but the recollection of them
still gives me great pain."</p>

<p>"Was it clearly ascertained that the misguided
woman perished?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. It was known that she and
her lover embarked in the ferry-boat on that fatal
night, and not a soul was saved."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

<p>There was a pause for some moments. At last,
Myrtilla spoke:</p>

<p>"Seymour, I fear she still lives&mdash;lives to plague
you in the form of Mrs. Sutton."</p>

<p>The colonel's brow darkened.</p>

<p>"I cannot hope to convince you," he rejoined,
in a sombre tone. "Think what you please. But
say no more on the subject."</p>

<p>"Do not be angry with me. Right or wrong,
I will stand by you, and acting thus together,
we shall prove more than a match for Mrs.
Sutton."</p>

<p>"She can do me no injury except through you,
Myrtilla. She is in my power, and if she provokes
me further she shall feel that she is so."</p>

<p>"Take care you do not place yourself in <i>her</i>
power, Seymour, or she will show you little pity.
Marriage between us, under present circumstances,
is of course out of the question; but I
shall continue our friendly relations, if only to

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

vex Mrs. Sutton. She shall not have the gratification
of thinking she has produced a rupture."</p>

<p>"I swear to you, Myrtilla, you are mistaken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not forswear yourself, Seymour. You
will fail to convince me, unless you can prove
that the Severn has not parted with its prey,
which I think you will find rather difficult.
But I will not give the vindictive woman a
triumph. That is all I can promise you. One
more question, and I have done. Answer it or
not, as you please, but answer truly. Who is
Hilary St. Ives?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Was there issue of your ill-starred marriage?"</p>

<p>The colonel made no reply.</p>

<p>"If there was, this young man is your son.
I have thought so all along. Have you ever
made any inquiries about him?"</p>

<p>"No. I take no interest in him. Even if

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

your suspicions are correct&mdash;and there is nothing
to warrant them&mdash;I will never acknowledge him.
It may seem a harsh determination&mdash;but having
formed it, I shall abide by it."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and Mrs. Radcliffe
came in, accompanied by May.</p>

<hr/>

<p>XVII.</p>

<p class="small">A DISCUSSION UPON BALLS AND WHAT IT LED TO.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one could have supposed from Mrs. Radcliffe's
manner that she entertained any secret
feeling of dislike to Myrtilla, or was otherwise
than pleased at her recovery. Yet, if her heart
had been searched, it would have appeared that
she was vexed at seeing her rival look so well,
and still more provoked to find her on as good
terms as ever with the colonel. Naturally, she
had attributed Myrtilla's sudden illness to the
effect of Mrs. Sutton's communication. But if a

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

quarrel had been caused, a reconciliation must
have taken place, and consequently the mischief
was undone.</p>

<p>Myrtilla discerned what was passing in the
other's breast, and was malicious enough to
heighten her annoyance.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Sir Charles came in, and
expressed his satisfaction at finding his sister all
right again.</p>

<p>"You were terribly missed yesterday, Myrtilla,
I can tell you," he said. "Your squires in
Rotten-row were in despair at your non-appearance
with May, and there was universal lamentation
at the Opera. I did not go to Lady Louisa
Legge's ball, but I hear it was considered a
failure owing to your absence."</p>

<p>"Very flattering to us," remarked her ladyship,
smiling. "We shall reappear with additional
&eacute;clat at Mrs. Baldwin Lanyon's rout to-night.
I insist upon your going with us, Charlie."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

<p>Sir Charles shook his head.</p>

<p>"No more balls for me," he remarked. "I
am heartily sick of them. I went to bed early
last night, and am all the better for it. You
don't want me, May. I never dance, and you
have no end of partners."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, then we must do without you,"
cried Myrtilla. "But you will lose a very
charming party. I dare say you would very
much prefer a quiet evening at Boxgrove."</p>

<p>"Infinitely. I find no pleasure in crowded and
stifling rooms, and there is nothing in the society
one meets to compensate for the annoyance one
is sure to experience."</p>

<p>"If such is your opinion, Charlie, you are quite
out of place in a ball-room, and much better in
bed," said her ladyship. "But to my mind there
is nothing so delightful as a crowded ball&mdash;crowded
I mean by nice people, such as we are
sure to meet to-night at the Baldwin Lanyons'.

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

Whatever you may aver to the contrary, girls
are never seen to such advantage as in a ball-room,
and certainly there is no other kind of
reunion that they enjoy so much. Isn't it true,
May?"</p>

<p>The young lady appealed to made no reply.
But Mrs. Radcliffe smiled assent.</p>

<p>"It used to be so in my time," she remarked.</p>

<p>"At no other sort of party can flirting be
carried on to such an extent," observed Sir
Charles, dryly; "and that I fancy is the grand
recommendation of a ball."</p>

<p>"We all like to flirt a little at a ball or elsewhere,"
laughed Myrtilla; "and so do you in
your quiet way, Charlie. Rail as much as you
please against balls, young people will always
enjoy them."</p>

<p>"To be sure they will," said Mrs. Radcliffe.
"My health will not permit me to go out now;

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

but there was a time when I liked nothing so
much as a ball."</p>

<p>"And were as much admired as your daughter,
as I can bear witness," observed the colonel.
"Sir Charles must be jesting. I never heard
him advance such monstrous opinions before."</p>

<p>"You mistake my meaning," observed Sir
Charles. "A ball now and then is delightful,
but there may be too much of a good thing.
To go out night after night&mdash;to meet the same
crowds&mdash;to dance with the same triflers&mdash;to listen
to the same vapid nonsense&mdash;appears to me a sad
waste of existence."</p>

<p>This tirade was received with a loud burst of
laughter from everybody but May.</p>

<p>"How we differ!" cried Myrtilla. "To me a
ball looks like enchantment. I like the atmosphere
and excitement, the lights, the music, the
crowd, the talk, the dancing&mdash;everything."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

<p>"Especially the flirting," remarked her brother.</p>

<p>"Well, what do girls go to a ball for; except
to flirt, as you call it? Most of them go with
the expectation of finding husbands, and some of
them succeed in their design. Necessarily, if
they are pretty, they are admired, and men will
flatter them&mdash;will talk nonsense to them. If
they laugh and are amused, you call that
flirting."</p>

<p>"But I hold it impossible that a girl of any
sense can be amused by the frivolities and attentions
of the same empty coxcombs," cried Sir
Charles. "She may tolerate them for an occasion,
but night after night to surround herself
with the same set of idiots argues a very coquettish
disposition."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I proclaim myself a coquette&mdash;a
heartless coquette, if you please," cried Myrtilla.
"I <i>do</i> like admiration&mdash;I <i>do</i> like to be surrounded

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

by a throng of empty-headed coxcombs,
vieing with each other for the honour of dancing
with me. It diverts me to listen to their nonsense,
and it enchants me to make them jealous of each
other. And I will tell you why, Charlie. A
man never looks so supremely ridiculous as when
he is jealous."</p>

<p>"None but a fool can be jealous of a coquette.
To be jealous of a woman you must love her, and
when you see her bestow her smiles on every one
who comes near her, the love you have felt will
soon be extinguished."</p>

<p>"There I differ with you," said the colonel.
"Our passions are not so much under our control
that we can conquer them in a moment. A coquette
may vex and annoy us, but we cannot
cease to love her."</p>

<p>"Well, we have had a very long discussion
upon balls," remarked Myrtilla. "But, in spite

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

of all that Sir Charles has said, I shall go to
Mrs. Lanyon's rout to-night. How say you,
May?"</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Why, surely you won't let Sir Charles's silly
opinions influence you?"</p>

<p>"I had made up my mind not to go before he
said a word&mdash;but I quite agree with him. I am
tired of balls."</p>

<p>"Are these your real sentiments, May?" cried
Sir Charles, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Myrtilla will tell you that it is not the first
time I have expressed them," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yes, since you are foolish enough to make
this confession, I must confirm its truth," replied
her ladyship. "I make no doubt it will gratify
you to learn, Charlie, that the silly creature,
finding you disliked balls, and were anything
but gratified&mdash;as you ought to have been&mdash;to see

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

her so much admired, and so much sought after,
would have withdrawn from society altogether,
if I would have allowed her. But I would not
hear of such a thing. I thought&mdash;and still think&mdash;that
you are bound to sacrifice your own
inclinations to hers, and that it is very selfish
of you to interfere with her enjoyment."</p>

<p>"But I have not found the enjoyment you led
me to expect in this perpetual round of gaiety,
Myrtilla," said May; "while, as you are aware,
the attentions paid me have been as annoying to
me as to Sir Charles. Forced to contrast my
former happy life with that I have been leading
of late, I am satisfied that my tastes are extremely
simple&mdash;that the country suits me far
better than town&mdash;and that I am not at all cut
out to be a fine lady."</p>

<p>Sir Charles uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p>"You are the most charming creature on earth,"

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

he exclaimed, flying towards her, and taking her
hand, which he pressed to his heart, "and have
dispelled every doubt I entertained."</p>

<p>"I know you thought me changed, dear Sir
Charles," she said, regarding him affectionately;
"but indeed&mdash;indeed&mdash;I am not so. I have played
a foolish part, but if you knew how much I have
suffered in acting it you would forgive me. I am
still the same May as ever."</p>

<p>"Don't say any more, I beg of you, my love,"
cried Myrtilla. "You will totally spoil him. I
hope he won't be so barbarous as to take you at
your word."</p>

<p>"My desire is to return to Hazlemere immediately,
if I am not interfering with mamma's
plans," said May. "I shall ever feel obliged by
your kindness to me, Myrtilla, but I have had
enough of gaiety."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, I think you have

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

come to a very wise determination, my dear," remarked
Mrs. Radcliffe. "You are bound to consult
Sir Charles's wishes on all points. However,
you had better remain in town for a few days
longer, as your sudden departure might cause disagreeable
comments."</p>

<p>"If I remain I shall not go to another ball.
People may say what they please."</p>

<p>"Well, I will make the best excuses I can for
you," remarked Myrtilla. "But I must keep <i>my</i>
engagements. What am I to say to Lord Robert,
and the rest of your admirers?"</p>

<p>"Bid them go hang themselves," cried Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"They are very likely to do it when they hear
of May's departure," laughed the colonel. "You
will have a great deal to answer for, Sir Charles.
Society will not easily forgive you for depriving it
of its chief attraction."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

<p>"I am too happy to care what it thinks," cried
the other, pressing May's hand.</p>

<p>That very morning May removed from Eaton-place
to Upper Brook-street.</p>

<p>Thenceforward, she and Sir Charles were almost
as much together as they had previously been in
the country, and she declared with perfect sincerity
that her last three days in town were the pleasantest
she had spent there. There was plenty to
do, for as the wedding-day was not far off, the
trousseau had to be ordered, and other necessary
arrangements made. These afforded delightful
occupation to Mrs. Radcliffe, who liked nothing
so much as a consultation with a modiste. It
may interest our fair readers to learn that May
received a profusion of handsome presents. Every
day brought her a beautiful piece of jewellery.
A new chariot had been ordered, and after she
had inspected it, it was sent down to Boxgrove.

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

Thither Sir Charles prepared to follow, while the
others got ready for their return to Hazlemere.</p>

<p>Their last day in town was devoted to the
Crystal Palace, where grandpapa gave a capital
dinner, as will be learnt in the next chapter.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch18">

<p>XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all, there is no place near London more
enjoyable than the Crystal Palace. We cannot
for a moment compare the gardens and grounds
with those of the regal palace of Versailles. There
is no grandeur about the enormous conservatory
crowning Sydenham Hill, but it has a light and
cheerful aspect, which a more solid structure in
such a situation, and built with a similar object,
could not offer. Its terraces, though wide, are not
stately&mdash;but they do very well for a promenade.

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

Its lawns, which are its prettiest feature, are
smooth and well kept, but then you are not allowed
to walk upon them. It has abundance of shrubberies,
plantations, flower-beds, and pavilions; it
has many statues in plaster, which we do not
admire, and it commands a magnificent and extensive
view which every one <i>must</i> admire, when
it is not obscured by fog; but it has no charming
parterres like those of Versailles&mdash;no bosquets&mdash;no
long shady alleys&mdash;no quincunxes&mdash;no tapis
vert&mdash;no basin of Latona&mdash;no salle de bal&mdash;and
above all, no fountain of Neptune.</p>

<p>Still, its fountains, though wanting in the rich
sculpture of those of Versailles, answer their purpose,
and when in full play present a very striking
spectacle.</p>

<p>What with its various attractions, inside and
out, the Crystal Palace constitutes, as we have
said, the best place of amusement to be found near

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

the metropolis. Naturally, it is the favourite resort
of foreigners, who find in the beautiful
gardens and in the vast bazaar connected with
them, more to suit their tastes than anywhere else
in London. Where are there such f&ecirc;tes as those
of Sydenham?&mdash;where such concerts?&mdash;where
such fireworks? The glories of extinct Vauxhall
pale before the modern pyrotechnic displays, and
their wonderful accompaniments. Nothing can be
finer than the illuminated fountains.</p>

<p>But it is not our purpose to particularise the
numerous and varied attractions of the Crystal
Palace. We are not about to describe its courts
and galleries. All our readers must be familiar
with them. Everybody, however, may not know
how well you can dine there. We do not speak
of the general refreshment-rooms, of which we
know nothing; but we refer to the private dining-rooms,
where you can get a far better dinner and

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

far better wines, than at the renowned Hotel des
Reservoirs at Versailles&mdash;and that is saying a good
deal.</p>

<p>Of this fact our worthy friend Mr. Thornton
had been made aware. The old gentleman had
already entertained the family party at Richmond
and Greenwich, and had got a capital dinner at
either place, but as the Radcliffes' visit to town
was drawing to a close, he resolved to wind up
with a dinner at the Crystal Palace, which, if
possible, should surpass the others. Accordingly
he secured a room and held a consultation with
the representative of Messrs. Bertram and Roberts,
who promised to carry out his intentions
efficiently, and to give him a most recherch&eacute;
dinner&mdash;whitebait and fish as good as he had
eaten at Greenwich, and other delicacies superior
to those provided for him at Richmond. And
we may add that he kept his word.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

<p>There was a floral f&ecirc;te that day at the Crystal
Palace, and as the show of roses was expected
to be magnificent, all the party&mdash;with one exception&mdash;went
early to see it.</p>

<p>The exception was Lady Richborough. She
did not care for roses, and preferred starting at
a later hour. The colonel would fain have tarried
for her, but she declined his attendance, and he
went on with the others.</p>

<p>Ever since the explanation, though her ladyship
continued ostensibly on the same terms with
him as before, she contrived never to be alone
with him.</p>

<p>As ill luck would have it, at the Victoria
Station she encountered Sir Charles's two pests,
Lord Robert Tadcaster and Captain de Vesci,
and though their company was agreeable enough
in the train, she contrived to get rid of them
on her arrival at the Palace, and proceeded alone

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

through the grounds towards the central entrance.
She had not gone far when a young man who
was passing raised his hat to her. It was Hilary
St. Ives, and she stopped him.</p>

<p>"I had determined to speak to you, Mr. St.
Ives, if I should ever meet you," she said. "Will
you take the trouble to walk a few steps with
me?"</p>

<p>Hilary was delighted to obey.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship does me great honour," he
observed, "I thought you had forgotten all
about me."</p>

<p>"No, I have really something important to say
to you. But first let me tell you that you have
very much offended Miss Radcliffe."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am very sorry to hear it. In what
way have I offended her?"</p>

<p>"By sending the gipsy to her at Ascot. The
jest may have afforded you amusement, but you

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

ought to have considered that Miss Radcliffe was
likely to be annoyed by it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry your ladyship should think me
capable of doing anything in such excessively bad
taste," cried Hilary, reddening. "The gipsy was
not sent by me, neither have I the slightest notion
what she said. I certainly observed her leaning
over the side of the carriage, and whispering something
in Miss Radcliffe's ear, but that is all I
know of the matter. I was a mere accidental
spectator of the scene. Pray tell Miss Radcliffe
so. I would not for worlds give her annoyance."</p>

<p>"I will tell her exactly what you say," replied
Myrtilla. "She will be glad to receive the assurance.
Her marriage with my brother. Sir
Charles Ilminster, is about to take place almost
immediately."</p>

<p>"I wish them all happiness. Sir Charles will
have a lovely bride. He is singularly fortunate

<!-- vol 2 page 257 -->

in his choice. Miss Radcliffe is one in a thousand."</p>

<p>"You speak enthusiastically," rejoined her ladyship,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I utter my real sentiments. Your ladyship's
condescension emboldens me to ask a favour of
you. Mrs. Radcliffe has expressed some interest
in me. Will you kindly inform her that I am
about to proceed immediately to Paris? I think I
shall do better there than in London."</p>

<p>"I will convey the message," she rejoined.
"But I hope I am not to understand from it that
you have been unsuccessful in your profession as
an artist? Can I be of any service to you?" she
continued, with an expression of real interest.
"I do not make the offer lightly. Some circumstances
connected with your history have recently
come to my knowledge, and have shown me that
you have been badly treated. I have it in my

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

power to help you, and I will do so, if you choose
to assert your rights."</p>

<p>"Alas! I have no <i>rights</i> to assert. Your ladyship
does not understand my unfortunate position."</p>

<p>"I understand it better than you suppose.
Your position is <i>not</i> unfortunate, and can be easily
remedied."</p>

<p>"Alas! not so. There is no redress for me. I
cannot move without injury to one who has the
chief claim upon my affections."</p>

<p>"She deserves no consideration. She is the
sole obstacle to your recognition. Disregard her
altogether."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds could I act thus. Reproach
shall never touch her if I can prevent it. If your
ladyship has obtained possession of the secret, I
implore you to guard it strictly. Reflect, I beseech
you, on the consequences of the slightest

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

imprudence in a case involving the honour and
happiness of so many persons. For the sake of
those connected with her, I beseech your ladyship
to spare her, and keep her secret."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" cried Myrtilla, amazed.
"Why should I spare her? What is she to
me? Your observations seem to apply rather to
Mrs. Radcliffe than to Mrs. Sutton."</p>

<p>Hilary saw the error into which he had been
led, and endeavoured to rectify it.</p>

<p>"I am so troubled that I scarcely know what
I say," he rejoined. "But Mrs. Radcliffe is the
last person to whom my observations could apply."</p>

<p>"They could not possibly refer to Mrs. Sutton,"
remarked Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"They were not intended to refer to her."</p>

<p>"To whom, then, did you allude?"</p>

<p>He tried to evade the question, and muttered
something as her ladyship walked on slowly.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

<p>"You have perplexed me very much, Mr. St.
Ives," she observed, after a short pause. "You
have started a difficulty that I did not at all
foresee. I think you are wrong, but be this as
it may, you need fear no indiscretion on my part.
I am not a mischief-maker. My sole desire is to
see you righted, for I think you have been very
badly used; but if this cannot be accomplished
without detriment to others, I shall abandon the
idea&mdash;at all events, for the present. I wish,
however&mdash;if not inconvenient to yourself&mdash;that
you would postpone your departure for Paris for
a few days, and in the interim call upon me in
Eaton-place. I should like to talk the matter
over with you quietly."</p>

<p>Hilary promised compliance, and professing
himself deeply indebted to her ladyship for the
kind interest she had manifested in him, bowed
and took leave.</p>

<p>Had the interview been prolonged, even for a

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

few minutes, it would have been disagreeably
interrupted, for shortly afterwards Mrs. Radcliffe
and the rest of the party appeared on the terrace,
where Lady Richborough joined them.</p>

<p>Later on in the day&mdash;when an opportunity
offered&mdash;she informed Mrs. Radcliffe of her meeting
with Hilary, and delivered his message to
her&mdash;carefully noting its effect.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe appeared much concerned. She
had lost none of the interest with which the
young man had originally inspired her.</p>

<p>"The news afflicts me greatly," she said.
"He has immense talent as an artist, but merit
is not properly appreciated. He seems very soon
discouraged. I dare not say more to Colonel
Delacombe about him, but a word from your
ladyship would do wonders."</p>

<p>"I have offered my services to the young man,
but he declines them."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he allows his pride to stand in

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

his way. A thousand pities that he is so impracticable.
Pray speak to the colonel. He will
listen to you, though not to me. If the young
man is going to Paris immediately, no time must
be lost. I will acquaint Sutton with his intended
departure. She feels for him like a mother, as
I do myself."</p>

<p>"By-the-by, have you ever found out who is
his mother?"</p>

<p>"No. I have no curiosity on the subject.
There is no doubt she is dead."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," rejoined Myrtilla,
looking at her.</p>

<p>"What reason has your ladyship for thinking
otherwise?" cried Mrs. Radcliffe, surprised.</p>

<p>"I will tell you some other time. I cannot
enter into particulars now."</p>

<p>"Can she be his mother?" she reflected.</p>

<p>This was May's first visit to the Crystal Palace,

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

and everything conspired to render it agreeable.
Sir Charles was with her, and his looks proclaimed
his happiness. Others of the party were
equally delighted with the scene, for it had the
same charm of novelty to Mr. and Mrs. Radcliffe
as to their daughter. The weather was
superb&mdash;bright and breezy. The numerous assemblage
attracted by the flower-show completely
filled the interior of the building, which presented
a magnificent coup d'&oelig;il.</p>

<p>Out of doors the scene was equally attractive&mdash;more
so, perhaps. As the company began
to stream forth and disperse among the grounds,
which were then in their fullest beauty, the
picture, as viewed from the terrace, was really
enchanting, and May and Sir Charles gazed at
it with delight.</p>

<p>As they were thus occupied in surveying the
charming prospect, interchanging their sentiments,

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

and almost betraying their innermost emotions
by their looks, they were watched from a
distance by Hilary.</p>

<p>After taking leave of Lady Richborough, as
related, the young man did not quit the palace,
but contrived, though unobserved, to keep her
ladyship in sight. He beheld her meeting with
the party. He saw Mrs. Radcliffe and Colonel
Delacombe&mdash;with what feelings need not be described.
Above all, he saw May.</p>

<p>Though his sentiments towards the latter were
changed, he could not but regard her with the
deepest interest, and he would have given worlds
to exchange places with Sir Charles, and hold
a brief converse with her.</p>

<p>He had much to say&mdash;much that never could
be said&mdash;and it was not likely they should ever
meet again. He might obtain a momentary
glimpse of her&mdash;such as he now enjoyed&mdash;but
that would be all.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

<p>How lovely she looked! How tender were the
glances she bestowed on Sir Charles!&mdash;and how
passionately devoted to her Sir Charles appeared.
They were standing on the terrace, as we have
described, too much occupied by the scene before
them&mdash;too much engrossed by each other to remark
that they were watched.</p>

<p>Near to them stood Colonel Delacombe, laughing,
and talking carelessly with Mrs. Radcliffe.
Did either of them bestow a thought on <i>him?</i></p>

<p>He turned from them to Lady Richborough,
who was standing between Mr. Thornton and Mr.
Radcliffe, and apparently delighting them both by
her lively remarks. Her ladyship was evidently
an object of general admiration, and Hilary could
not help feeling flattered by the interest that had
been taken in him by so charming a personage.</p>

<p>He still maintained his post of observation, when
a ridiculous incident occurred that afforded a good
deal of amusement to all who witnessed it.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

<p>The upper fountains had just begun to play,
when two young men of very fashionable appearance,
who had caught sight of Lady Richborough,
and were hastening to join her, incautiously passed
too near the jets, and were drenched from head to
foot by the spray, which a sudden gust of wind
carried over them.</p>

<p>Most pitiable objects they looked, with their
dishevelled whiskers and dripping garments, and
they hurried off as fast as they could to hide their
discomfiture, but did not escape recognition as
Lord Robert Tadcaster and Captain de Vesci.
Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton laughed heartily,
and Sir Charles was not sorry that such an example
had been made of them.</p>

<p>An excellent dinner concluded a very agreeable
day, so far as the majority of the party was concerned.
Lady Richborough, however, had still
something to do. She went to two balls that
night.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

<p>Next day our friends left town&mdash;the Radcliffes
and old Mr. Thornton for Hazlemere, and Sir
Charles Ilminster for Boxgrove.</p>

<p>While bidding adieu to Mrs. Radcliffe, the
colonel strongly urged her to get rid of Mrs.
Sutton.</p>

<p>"I do not see how that can be managed, just
at present," said the lady.</p>

<p>"She must go&mdash;and speedily&mdash;or she will make
more mischief," rejoined the colonel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe smiled. She thought the housekeeper
had done all the mischief she could.</p>

<p>She was very much mistaken.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch19">

<p>XIX.</p>

<p class="small">LADY RICHBOROUGH RECEIVES A PROPOSAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will naturally be imagined that Hilary would
present himself without delay in Eaton-place.
Three days passed by, however, and he had
neither called nor sent an excuse.</p>

<p>Lady Richborough, who had begun to take a
strong interest in his fortunes, was very much
surprised and annoyed by his unaccountable
neglect.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day after she
had met him at the Crystal Palace she was

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

alone in her elegantly-furnished drawing-room,
wondering whether he would call, and prepared
to take him to task if he did, when a valet
entered, and announced&mdash;not the young gentleman
who occupied her thoughts, but&mdash;Mr.
Thornton.</p>

<p>Though secretly disappointed, she immediately
rose from the fauteuil on which she was reclining,
and welcomed her visitor with every
demonstration of delight. Her ladyship, we may
remark en passant, was attired in a robe of
toile de l'Inde, with deep flounces, which suited
her admirably.</p>

<p>"Good morning, dear Mr. Thornton," she
cried, in her blandest accents. "Enchanted to
see you. Just come up from Hazlemere, I suppose?
How did you leave them all?&mdash;dear
Miss Radcliffe&mdash;darling May&mdash;and dear excellent
Mr. Radcliffe?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

<p>"All much as usual," replied the old gentleman.
"The ladies desired their love to you, of course.
Sir Charles dined with us yesterday, and we all
dine with him to-day. Your ladyship will laugh
when I tell you that May declares she will
never come to town again, unless Sir Charles
particularly desires it, and he invariably answers
that she shall do just as she likes. Well, I
hope it will last; they promise to be the happiest
pair under the sun."</p>

<p>"Yes, if happiness consists in a quiet, humdrum,
country life, with no excitement beyond
a stroll in the garden, a canter in the park, or
a visit to the stables, they are likely to get on
well enough. But that is not my notion of
happiness, as you are aware, Mr. Thornton. I
like town life&mdash;gaiety, and plenty of it."</p>

<p>"I think your ladyship is quite right," rejoined
the old gentleman. "I begin to find the country

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

rather dull myself. But of course I must remain
at Hazlemere till the grand business is over.
Apropos of the wedding, the bridesmaids are
chosen, Jessie Brooke, the two Miss Milwards,
Eva Dale, Gwendoline Clifford, Elfrida Butler,
Lucy Fleming, and Selina Hardy, eight uncommonly
pretty girls. Captain Huntley Blois is
to be Sir Charles's best man. The marriage,
of course, will take place at Wootton, and our
worthy vicar, the Rev. Nisbet Jones, will perform
the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Is the day fixed, Mr. Thornton? It was not
when they left town."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it will be the 15th, but your
ladyship will receive precise information from
May. I understand they don't mean to go
abroad, or make any lengthened tour, but return
after a week's absence to Boxgrove, and spend
the rest of the honeymoon at home."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 272 -->

<p>"Just like Charlie! I wonder May will consent
to such a stupid arrangement. They ought
to go to Switzerland, or the Italian lakes. Bellagio,
on the lake of Como, would be delightful,
and take Paris on the way back."</p>

<p>"Delicious!" exclaimed the old gentleman,
rapturously. "If I ever take another wedding
trip, I'll follow your ladyship's advice and go to
Como. By-the-by, I've something to say to
you."</p>

<p>"Before you say it, let me ask you whether
that young artist&mdash;you know whom I mean,
Hilary St. Ives&mdash;has been lately at Hazlemere?"</p>

<p>"Odd, you should ask me the question. I
believe he was there yesterday, but I didn't see
him."</p>

<p>"I suppose Mrs. Radcliffe sent for him?"</p>

<p>"What for!" exclaimed the old gentleman,
staring at her. "Why should she send for
him?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

<p>"It occurred to me that she might have done
so&mdash;but never mind. What have you got to
say to me?"</p>

<p>"Something that requires your best attention,"
he rejoined. "I must premise that I am tolerably
well off. Prudence and economy in early
life&mdash;together with some fortunate speculations&mdash;have
enabled me to realise a considerable property."</p>

<p>Myrtilla smiled. She suspected from his manner
what was coming.</p>

<p>"I have always understood, Mr. Thornton,
that you are rich&mdash;very rich," she observed.</p>

<p>"Not <i>very</i> rich, but rich enough to make a
good settlement, as I am prepared to do, if your
ladyship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Thornton, you take me quite by
surprise," she cried, with difficulty repressing a
laugh.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

<p>"I fear I have been too abrupt, but your
ladyship will excuse me. Yesterday I learnt, for
the first time, from my daughter, Mrs. Radcliffe,
that all was at an end between your ladyship and
Colonel Delacombe. I presume she was correctly
informed?"</p>

<p>"No positive engagement ever subsisted between
the colonel and myself, Mr. Thornton, and
I may add none is likely to occur, but we are
just as good friends as ever."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I understand. Comes to the same
thing. Engagement, or no engagement, it's off."</p>

<p>"If you like to have it so&mdash;yes. And certain
not to be renewed."</p>

<p>"Delighted to hear it&mdash;that is, sorry for my
friend the colonel, for whom I have the greatest
regard, but glad on my own account. Finding
there was an opening for another suitor, I resolved
to be first in the field, and here I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

<p>"A word, Mr. Thornton. Pray did you acquaint
Mrs. Radcliffe with your intention?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly, and Radcliffe too. I thought
it only right and proper to consult them. They
both highly approved of my design."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I should scarcely have expected it."</p>

<p>"They thought the match very desirable, as it
would connect the families still more closely, and
Sir Charles was of the same opinion. May was
particularly well pleased. She thought it would
be such a nice thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To have me for a grandmamma!" cried
Myrtilla, laughing. "Excessively obliged to her."</p>

<p>"To have you for a grandmamma!" exclaimed
Mr. Thornton, aghast. "Who ever dreamed of
such a thing? You must think me crazy."</p>

<p>"You told me, only this moment, that you
were resolved to be first in the field&mdash;what does
that mean?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

<p>"It means that I have come to make you an
offer of marriage&mdash;not from myself&mdash;I have not
the presumption&mdash;but from my grandson, Oswald
Woodcot. Having been partly refused on a
former occasion, the poor fellow has not the
courage to present himself again, so I have undertaken
to plead his cause; and perhaps I may
be able to use some arguments that may have
weight, if you will deign to listen to them."</p>

<p>"I will listen to anything you may say to me,
Mr. Thornton, but I cannot understand why
Oswald should require your intervention. I did
not think bashfulness was his foible. Rather the
reverse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if the truth must be told, he is without&mdash;anxiously,
most anxiously, awaiting your decision.
Shall I call him in?"</p>

<p>"By all means," she replied. "I am concerned
that he should have been kept there so long."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 277 -->

<p>Thereupon, the old gentleman opened the door,
and his grandson immediately rushed in, and,
flying towards her ladyship, threw himself in a
theatrical manner at her feet. But she at once
ordered him to rise.</p>

<p>"Such absurdity as this is out of date," she
cried. "Nobody kneels now-a-days&mdash;except upon
the stage. Do you know what you have done,
sir? By your ridiculous mode of proceeding you
very nearly made me accept Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>"My stars! if I had known that, I would have
gone in on my own account," cried the old gentleman.
"You see what powers of persuasion I
possess, Oswald."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that you have said one word
for me and two for yourself, sir," observed his
grandson, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, my boy. All will be right in
the end. The mistake will easily be rectified.

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

Take him on my recommendation," he said to
Myrtilla. "I'll answer for it, he'll make an excellent
husband."</p>

<p>"Have you told her ladyship what you propose
to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"No; but I'll tell her now in your presence.
What I promise I'll perform. If your ladyship
accepts the proposal which I have just had the
honour to make on behalf of my grandson, I
undertake that a jointure shall be settled on you
corresponding in amount with that which you
now enjoy, and which you will lose on your
marriage."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you do the thing very handsomely,
I must say, Mr. Thornton," she observed,
smiling.</p>

<p>"But that's not all," cried Oswald. "My dear
old grand-dad is the most liberal fellow on
earth."</p>

<p>"So he seems," she assented.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 279 -->

<p>"I always intended to make Oswald my heir,"
pursued the old gentleman. "But if he marries
to please me&mdash;as he will, if he marries your
ladyship&mdash;he shall have a handsome allowance
during my lifetime."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say he was a capital fellow?" cried
Oswald.</p>

<p>"My desire is to make all pleasant," added the
old gentleman; "and I hope I shall be able to
go back to Hazlemere and tell them that the affair
is satisfactorily settled."</p>

<p>"Now for the decision," said Oswald. "My
happiness and my fortune rest with your ladyship."</p>

<p>"I must have time for consideration," she rejoined.
"I should like to please Mr. Thornton,
who has behaved so remarkably well, and to whom
I feel personally indebted, and I have no particular
objection to you, Oswald, but I can't make
up my mind at a moment's notice."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

<p>"Then I am neither accepted nor rejected?"
said the young man, looking very blank.</p>

<p>"Can't I prevail on your ladyship to say
'Yes'?" insinuated the old gentleman.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and rejoined, "Neither
you nor Oswald understand me in the least. You
have to do with the most fickle creature on earth.
Were I to give you a promise now, ten to one I
should break it, and then you would upbraid me
with falsehood, inconstancy, and all that sort of
thing. Don't press me further. I repeat, I can't
make up my mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I still hope your ladyship may spend a
month at the lovely lake of Como, and that I may
have the pleasure of meeting you at Paris when
you return."</p>

<p>"Not this autumn, I think, Mr. Thornton," she
rejoined.</p>

<p>"We shall see&mdash;we shall see."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

<p>Just then, the valet entered, and approaching
Myrtilla, said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilary St. Ives is here. Will your ladyship
see him?"</p>

<p>She coloured slightly, as she answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is he doing here?" cried Mr.
Thornton.</p>

<p>"Come to take her ladyship's portrait, of
course," remarked Oswald.</p>

<p>"He has called by my express invitation," observed
Lady Richborough. "Pray don't run
away on his account. Luncheon will be ready
directly. Do me the favour to step down to the
dining-room; I'll join you as soon as my conference
with Mr. St. Ives is ended."</p>

<p>The proposition was too agreeable to be declined.
As the two gentlemen were quitting the
room, Hilary was ushered in, and they met near

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

the door. Mr. Thornton bowed very stiffly, but
Oswald gave the young artist a good-natured nod
of recognition.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," remarked Oswald to
his grandsire, as they went down-stairs; "but
that confounded fellow seems always to cross my
path."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch20">

<p>XX.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH HILARY FINDS A FATHER.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> have made very little haste to call upon
me, Mr. St. Ives," observed Lady Richborough,
motioning him to take a seat. "However, I
do not require any apologies. I have just learnt
from Mr. Thornton that you have been at Hazlemere."</p>

<p>"I was summoned there," he replied. "On
the morning after I was fortunate enough to
meet your ladyship at the Crystal Palace, I received
a letter from Mrs. Radcliffe enjoining me

<!-- vol 2 page 284 -->

to come down to her without delay, and could not
refuse compliance, though I had resolved never
to go to Hazlemere again. In obedience to the
instructions given me, I went down by a particular
train. Mrs. Sutton met me at the station
and conducted me to the house. I had an interview
with Mrs. Radcliffe, which I need not detail,
except to say that I consented to act according to
her directions."</p>

<p>"You did well," observed Myrtilla. "I am
certain she would advise you for the best."</p>

<p>"I felt so," he replied; "and though stung
by a sense of injustice which prompted a very
different course, I yielded to her entreaties, and
agreed not to depart for Paris without seeing
Colonel Delacombe. Mrs. Radcliffe assured me&mdash;as
I cannot doubt&mdash;that no one has so much
influence with the colonel as your ladyship&mdash;and
she assured me also that you are willing to exert
it in my behalf."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

<p>"My influence with Colonel Delacombe is not
so great as Mrs. Radcliffe imagines," replied
Myrtilla; "but I should like to hear something
more about Mrs. Sutton. Had you no conversation
with her? Had she no suggestions to
offer?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sutton's manner towards me is incomprehensible,"
he rejoined. "Nothing could exceed
the delight that she exhibited when she met me at
the station. If I had been really her son, she
could not have greeted me with more affection.
But before we reached the house her manner had
totally changed. Perhaps I did not please her by
my observations, for she seemed to resent them. I
am certain that she dislikes&mdash;I might almost say
hates&mdash;Mrs. Radcliffe: and she entertains no
more kindly feeling towards Colonel Delacombe.
She gives me the idea of a person in possession of
an important secret which she uses for her own
purposes."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

<p>"It is a great misfortune that she is installed
at Hazlemere, and I fear Mrs. Radcliffe will have
reason to regret the trust she places in her. If
Mrs. Sutton were not in the way, I should have no
difficulty with Colonel Delacombe. Do not ask
me for any explanation. I cannot give it. Was
she present during your interview with Mrs. Radcliffe?"</p>

<p>"No; and I was very cautious in what I said
to her, for, in spite of her professions of regard,
her manner inspired me with distrust. I ought
to mention that Mrs. Radcliffe told me she would
write to the colonel, and beg him to confer with
your ladyship. A few days ago I should not
have cared to succeed, but now I ardently desire
to do so."</p>

<p>"What has produced this sudden change in
your sentiments?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I am ambitious," he cried. "I have aspirations

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

which I ought not to indulge, but which
I cannot help indulging. At all hazards I must
speak the truth. Ever since our meeting, your
image has haunted me, and will not be dismissed.
I am an artist, and you will not wonder
that beauty, such as yours, should produce an
extraordinary effect upon me. I tried to control
the passion inspired by your charms, but it has
mastered me. Never has my position appeared
so intolerable as now. I would be something
better&mdash;something on which you would not disdain
to cast your regards. I know you will laugh
at my folly and extravagance, but at least you
will understand why I desire to attain a higher
position."</p>

<p>Lady Richborough did not appear offended.</p>

<p>"If I have any rights, as you intimated when
we last met, I am resolved to assert them," he
pursued.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

<p>"The best thing to cure you of your romantic
folly would be to allow you to remain as you
are," she observed. "But I have promised to
aid you, and I will be as good as my word.
Pray did you make Mrs. Radcliffe a confidante
of your passion?"</p>

<p>The young man looked abashed.</p>

<p>"She may have drawn her own conclusions
from the raptures in which I spoke of your ladyship's
charms," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," she rejoined. "That
accounts for a visit I have just received."</p>

<p>An interruption here occurred. Colonel Delacombe
was ushered in by the valet, who immediately
retired.</p>

<p>Hilary at once arose and prepared to depart,
but Lady Richborough detained him.</p>

<p>Then turning to the colonel, who did not manifest
either surprise or displeasure on seeing the
young man, she said,</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

<p>"I am very glad you have come, colonel. Mr.
St. Ives has just laid his case before me, and I
have undertaken to become his advocate."</p>

<p>"He could not have a better," rejoined the
other. "It may save time, however, if I state
at once that my mind is made up. This morning
I have received a long letter from Mrs. Radcliffe.
She, too, is a zealous advocate in the young
man's cause, and pleads it warmly and strongly.
But her pleading, I confess, would have been of
no avail but for a wholly unforeseen circumstance.
Doubts have rested on my mind that have warped
my judgment and feelings, and converted what
should have been affection into hate. These
doubts have just been removed. How, or by
whom, I need not now explain, but proofs have
been afforded me that I was utterly wrong in
my suspicions. Satisfied of this, I could not for
a moment hesitate to repair the injustice I have

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

done. Learning that the young man was here, I
came on instantly. In your ladyship's presence,
I acknowledge him as my son."</p>

<p>Hilary uttered an exclamation of joy, and threw
himself into his father's outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"Nobly done, Seymour," cried Myrtilla. "You
have not belied my expectations."</p>

<p>"I cannot suitably express my feelings of
gratitude," said Hilary, in accents broken by
emotion. "But this moment makes amends for
all the past."</p>

<p>"Let the past be forgotten," said the colonel.
"You will not blame me too severely when you
know all. I will endeavour to atone for the error
I have committed."</p>

<p>"Enough, sir&mdash;more than enough," cried his
son.</p>

<p>"I cannot obey the dictates of my heart, which
prompt me at once to acknowledge you publicly,"

<!-- vol 2 page 291 -->

said the colonel. "For some little time longer
you must be content to remain Hilary St. Ives.
But you need give yourself no concern in regard
to the future. Henceforward, your position is
completely assured."</p>

<p>"I beg to offer you my sincere congratulations,
Mr. St. Ives, for I suppose I must still
call you so," said Lady Richborough, archly.
"You have now obtained the position you so
much desired."</p>

<p>The colonel detected the glance that passed
between her ladyship and the young man.</p>

<p>"His position and his fortune&mdash;for he will have
both," he observed, in a significant tone&mdash;"will
enable him to marry well."</p>

<p>"You mean to leave him behind, when you
return to India, colonel?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"That depends," he replied. "If he should
be fortunate enough to marry, his wife may not

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

object to go out with us. I think I have heard
your ladyship say that you would like to visit
the country."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have said so, but I never meant it
seriously."</p>

<p>"For my own part I have the greatest desire
to visit India," cried Hilary. "It has every sort
of attraction for me."</p>

<p>"You expect great things, I perceive; but
I don't think you will be disappointed," said
the colonel. "You will find plenty of employment
there for your pencil, if you choose to
exercise it."</p>

<p>"And plenty of charming society, I suppose?"
observed Hilary.</p>

<p>"The pleasantest society on earth&mdash;especially
to ladies," rejoined the colonel. "Nowhere, as
I have often remarked to Lady Richborough,
are ladies made so much of as in India. A

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

beautiful woman is positively adored there, and
exercises a sway quite unattainable in England."</p>

<p>"A tempting description," observed Hilary,
glancing at her ladyship.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may go to India, when I have
nothing better to do," she remarked, with a smile.
"But come down to luncheon. It must be ready.
Some of our friends from Hazlemere are here,"
she added to the colonel.</p>

<p>Upon this they descended to the dining-room,
where they found Mr. Thornton and Oswald,
both of whom were very glad to see the colonel,
but amazed that Hilary had not departed. An
elegant collation was speedily served, and a glass
of champagne raised Oswald's spirits. He would
have felt far happier, however, if her ladyship
had not paid so much attention to Hilary. Neither
he nor his grandsire could understand the
remarkable change in Colonel Delacombe's deportment

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

towards the young artist. He now
treated him with so much friendliness that the
old gentleman whispered to Oswald:</p>

<p>"Begad! it wouldn't surprise me if he were
to acknowledge him, after all."</p>

<p>This impression was confirmed by a remark
made by the colonel to Lady Richborough,
seeming to imply that Hilary was going with
him to his hotel.</p>

<p>Indeed, there could be no doubt on the point,
since Mr. Thornton, being curious enough to
look out of the dining-room window, beheld
Hilary jump into the brougham, which was
drawn up at the door, and heard the order
given by the colonel to drive to the Langham.</p>

<p>Prior to his departure, the colonel had charged
the old gentleman with a message to Mrs. Radcliffe
to the effect that he meant to run down
to Hazlemere on the following day. But he

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

didn't add&mdash;as Mr. Thornton half expected&mdash;that
he meant to bring Hilary with him.</p>

<p>Grandsire and grandson lingered for a few
minutes in the vain hope of obtaining some encouragement
from Lady Richborough. Her ladyship,
however, did not relent.</p>

<p>XXI.</p>

<p class="small">EXPLAINS THE COLONEL'S ERRAND.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, Colonel Delacombe went down to
Hazlemere, as appointed.</p>

<p>He did not arrive till the afternoon, and all
the party, except the lady of the house, had
gone over to Boxgrove. Immediately on his arrival,
he inquired for the housekeeper, stating
that he had something to say to her, and Mr.
Luff conducted him to her room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton, who was engaged at the time on
some household matters, received him with all

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

the deference consistent with her station, so long
as the butler was present, but as soon as they
were alone, her manner changed, and with a
menacing; look she demanded what brought him
again to Hazlemere.</p>

<p>"My errand, as I think you might guess, is to
see you," he replied, seating himself. "A good
deal has happened lately."</p>

<p>"Yes, your designs upon Lady Richborough
have been frustrated," she rejoined, with a bitter
smile; "and if you have any designs here they
will likewise be frustrated."</p>

<p>"Before you make any further observations,
which only serve to display your malignity, it
may be as well to inform you that I saw Mr.
Courtenay yesterday."</p>

<p>The housekeeper turned very pale. He remarked
the effect produced upon her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will talk a little more rationally
now," he said.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

<p>"I care nothing for Mr. Courtenay," she cried,
recovering herself. "He can tell you nothing
that you did not know before."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. He gave me some particulars
of your history with which I was wholly unacquainted.
Hitherto," he continued, in a stern
tone, "I believed that your unhappy mother died
of a broken heart, I now know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is false," she interrupted, fiercely. "Mr.
Courtenay is my deadly enemy, and would destroy
me if he could. You do not believe me capable
of such a deed as that with which he charges
me?"</p>

<p>"I will not pronounce an opinion," said the
colonel, still more sternly. "I would fain hope
you are innocent of this foul and unnatural
crime; but after what I have heard, I can scarcely
acquit you."</p>

<p>"I am innocent," cried the wretched woman.
"As I hope for mercy hereafter, I am innocent

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

of this dreadful offence! Say you believe me,
Seymour!&mdash;say you believe me!"</p>

<p>"Do not touch me, woman!" he cried, pushing
her from him, with an expression of loathing.</p>

<p>"Oh! Heaven support me!" she cried, sinking
into a chair with a look of agony.</p>

<p>"If I did my duty," he said, after a pause, "I
should bring you to justice; but I am restrained
by considerations which you will understand."</p>

<p>"Considerations for yourself," she cried, with a
vindictive look. "You would not spare me, if
your own reputation were not at stake."</p>

<p>"I spare you for your son's sake as well as my
own," he rejoined. "The stings of an accusing
conscience, which you cannot stifle, will be punishment
enough for you."</p>

<p>"Do not condemn me unheard," she cried,
rousing herself, and speaking with impassioned
earnestness. "You have lent a too ready ear to

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

this charge. It cannot be substantiated. I can
show you Mr. Courtenay's motives for making it."</p>

<p>"I do not desire to hear them," he said. "Your
own conduct condemns you: your quarrels with
your unhappy mother, and her death, under suspicious
circumstances, seem to fix the crime on
you. But evidences of guilt are afforded by your
flight with your paramour&mdash;by your desertion of
your child&mdash;by the device adopted to screen yourself
from the consequences of your evil deeds.
If innocent, why allow it to be supposed that
you had perished in the Severn? Why conceal
your existence? Why hide yourself under a
feigned name? If innocent, why are you here&mdash;as
Mrs. Sutton? Your conduct proclaims your
guilt."</p>

<p>"It may seem to do so&mdash;but I was driven to
act as I did by remorse&mdash;not for the crime which
you believe me to have committed, and of which,

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

as Heaven knows! I am innocent&mdash;but for other
offences. I knew I should be shunned and despised,
and wished to be forgotten. I found, as I
deemed, a secure retreat, and remained in it unmolested
for years&mdash;and might have remained in
it to the end, if you&mdash;to whom I owe all my affliction&mdash;had
not appeared to trouble me. I am not
so bad as you suppose. I have sinned deeply, but
have repented. I would willingly&mdash;if I could&mdash;have
made some atonement for my errors. I might
have died in peace&mdash;unknown and respected. Of
all men, I would most have avoided you, Seymour
Delacombe. But fate has brought you hither to
perplex me&mdash;to rouse evil passions in my breast,
and prompt evil actions. I warned you not to
come. I besought you not to meddle with me.
You would not heed; and if ill ensues, you will
be responsible for it."</p>

<p>"It is useless to continue this discussion,'"

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

observed the colonel, entirely unmoved by her
defence. "I have simply to tell you that you
cannot remain longer here."</p>

<p>"You tell me so?" she said, in a singular tone,
in which a latent menace could be detected.
"What if I refuse to go on your bidding?"</p>

<p>"You will not refuse, when I tell you that by
remaining here you will mar your son's prospects."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to acknowledge him?"</p>

<p>"Not till you are gone."</p>

<p>A fierce conflict took place in the unhappy
woman's bosom. Vindictive feelings obtained the
mastery. Infernal malice blazed in her eyes as
she spoke.</p>

<p>"My son is nothing to me," she cried. "He
is devoid of natural feeling. When he was here
the other day, he drove me mad by his utter insensibility.
If he loved me, I would make any

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

sacrifice for him. I would lay down my life to
serve him. But he hates me, and thinks only
of the detestable woman who has robbed me of his
affections. I will stay to plague <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"Have you no good feeling left?"</p>

<p>"When my lacerated heart is healed, it will be
time to talk to me of good feelings," she rejoined.
"Meanwhile, I stay here. Try to remove me at
your peril."</p>

<p>"You shall go, be the consequences what they
may," cried the colonel.</p>

<p>And he arose and left the room.</p>

<p>Ascertaining from Boston that Mrs. Radcliffe
was in her boudoir, he proceeded thither at
once.</p>

<p>"That infernal woman is capable of anything,"
he thought, as he went up-stairs.</p>

<p>He was right, and he would have comprehended
her vindictive purpose, if he had seen her take a

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

letter from a private drawer, and heard her
mutter,</p>

<p>"It is well I secured this letter. The time is
come to use it."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch22">

<p>XXII.</p>

<p class="small">THE USE MADE OF THE LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Armed</span> with this letter, Mrs. Sutton left her
room. She knew where the colonel was gone, and
was about to follow him, when she encountered
Mr. Radcliffe in the hall. He had just returned
from Boxgrove, having ridden on by himself.
Struck by the housekeeper's haggard looks, he
inquired what was the matter.</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you, sir&mdash;something
important&mdash;in private," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Well, come with me to my study. We shan't
be disturbed there. Colonel Delacombe, I hear,
has arrived."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

<p>"Yes; he is with Mrs. Radcliffe&mdash;in her
boudoir," she replied, significantly.</p>

<p>"Nothing strange in that," observed the worthy
gentleman.</p>

<p>The housekeeper accompanied him to his study&mdash;a
comfortable little room adjoining the library,
in which he transacted his magisterial business.
It was furnished with a large writing-table, on
which sundry law-books were laid, together with
files of papers. Seating himself near this table,
he requested the housekeeper to take a chair
beside him.</p>

<p>"By-the-by, Sutton, have you heard the news?"
he remarked. "Colonel Delacombe, I'm told, is
about to adopt that young artist, who came here&mdash;Hilary
St. Ives. Odd! ain't it?"</p>

<p>"It may appear odd to you, sir, but it doesn't
surprise me. Ah! sir, you little know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Little know what?" he cried. "Speak plainly.
Why do you look at me in that manner?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

<p>"Because I'm so sorry for you, sir. My heart
bleeds for you. But it must out&mdash;it must out."</p>

<p>"What must out?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The dreadful secret,"' she rejoined. "I can
keep it no longer. Prepare yourself for a
great shock, sir. You will need all your firmness."</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe's looks betokened great trouble,
but the relentless woman went on.</p>

<p>"Read that," she said, placing the letter before
him. "That will tell you all. That will show
you how you have been deceived."</p>

<p>Damps gathered upon the poor gentleman's
brow, and his vision grew dim.</p>

<p>"I would rather not read it, Sutton," he said,
in a husky, unnatural voice, pushing the letter
from him as he spoke. "I don't want to learn
anything that will give me pain. I would rather
rest in ignorance."</p>

<p>This did not suit her.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

<p>"You <i>will</i> read the letter, sir," she said, "when
I tell you that it is from the young man you
have just mentioned&mdash;Hilary St. Ives&mdash;<i>to his
mother</i>."</p>

<p>"To his mother, did you say? Why, it is
addressed to my wife," he cried, snatching up the
letter to examine it.</p>

<p>"Your wife is his mother," said Mrs. Sutton,
in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>"You lie, woman!" cried Mr. Radcliffe, springing
up, and striking the table with his clenched
hand. "You lie! How dare you make such an
abominable insinuation? Quit my presence instantly!
Quit the house! Begone!"</p>

<p>"I am ready to go at once," she rejoined,
rising. "But you will repent the language you
have used towards me. My feelings would not
allow me to conceal the truth."</p>

<p>"Stay!" he cried. "I am half distracted.
You must make allowances for me, Sutton."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

<p>"I make every allowance for you, sir. I pity
you from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>He sat down. His hand shook so much that
he could scarcely hold the letter, but he went on,
pausing every now and then to wipe the damps
from his brow.</p>

<p>At last the letter dropped upon the table.</p>

<p>The mischief was done.</p>

<p>"You have destroyed my peace for ever,
Sutton," groaned the miserable man, after a
pause; "but I forgive you. What a cruel deception
has been practised upon me! How I
doted upon her!"</p>

<p>"Had you no previous suspicions, sir?"</p>

<p>"Suspicions?&mdash;no! I had the most perfect
faith in her. I believed every word she told me&mdash;every
word. I knew that an engagement had
subsisted between her and Seymour Delacombe&mdash;I
knew that she nourished a silly, sentimental

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

regard for him&mdash;but the idea of anything wrong
never entered my head. Even now&mdash;with this
frightful evidence before me&mdash;I can scarcely
believe it."</p>

<p>"I thought her conduct towards the young
man might have surprised you, sir."</p>

<p>"It did surprise me. I disapproved of her
absurd demonstrations of regard for him, though
I took no notice of them. But they bear a different
construction now. What am I to do,
Sutton? What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Act like a man, sir. Under such circumstances,
there is but one course to pursue."</p>

<p>"But I have not the heart to cast her from
me, as you would seem to suggest. Besides," he
cried, with a sudden access of tenderness, "she
is the mother of my child. For May's sake I
must endure the wrong patiently and in silence."</p>

<p>"For your own sake you cannot allow things

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

to continue as they are. The colonel must not
remain here."</p>

<p>"He shall not," cried the deluded man, transported
with fury. "He is in the boudoir, you
say, with my wife. I am half inclined to blow
out his brains."</p>

<p>"He richly deserves it, but it will be enough
if you order him out of the house."</p>

<p>"I'll go to them at once. I will not allow my
just indignation to cool," he cried, rushing out
of his study, and hurrying up-stairs to the
boudoir.</p>

<p>"They will now feel my power," cried Mrs.
Sutton, with an exulting smile.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch23">

<p>XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">AN ILL QUARTER OF AN HOUR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Radcliffe's</span> wild looks and abrupt entrance
were well calculated to alarm his wife and
the colonel, who were engaged at the moment in
an anxious discussion relative to Mrs. Sutton&mdash;the
colonel urging her immediate dismissal, and
the lady reluctant to yield assent. They guessed
what had happened, and prepared for a storm.</p>

<p>Without vouchsafing a word, and scarcely
appearing to notice them, the incensed gentleman
marched straight to the fireplace, and taking

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

down the two miniatures, which had been restored
to their places, smashed them with the poker,
and flung the fragments into the grate.</p>

<p>"There!" he roared. "Those accursed objects
will never more offend my sight."</p>

<p>He then turned round, and glared at the
astonished witnesses of his proceeding, who, while
his back was towards them, had exchanged very
expressive glances and gestures.</p>

<p>"Have you taken leave of your senses, Mr.
Radcliffe?" inquired his wife, eyeing him through
her glass, and speaking with a calmness that
aggravated his fury.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have," he vociferated, almost foaming
at the mouth with rage. "I have enough to
make me mad. I have long been your dupe,
madam, but at last my eyes are opened, and
I clearly discern the position in which you have
placed me by your perfidious conduct. I have
read the letter of&mdash;of"&mdash;the words well-nigh

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

suffocated him, but at last he got them out&mdash;"of
your <span class="smcap">son</span>! Here it is, madam. Look at it!
Can you deny that this letter is addressed to
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not attempt to deny it," she replied,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Then you glory in your shame! You
unblushingly avow that you have deceived me&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>"When you speak more temperately, Mr. Radcliffe&mdash;in
a manner more befitting our relations
towards each other&mdash;I will answer you; but thus
addressed, I shall not condescend to do so."</p>

<p>"You take it with a very high hand, madam,"
he sneered; "but it won't answer your purpose.
I am not to be imposed upon."</p>

<p>"My good Mr. Radcliffe," said the colonel,
"you are entirely under a delusion."</p>

<p>"A delusion!" exclaimed the other, exasperated
beyond all bounds by the remark. "Do you

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

mean to tell me that I am to doubt the evidence
of my own senses? I have here in this damnatory
letter proof positive of my unhappy wife's
criminality."</p>

<p>"My criminality, Mr. Radcliffe! I will not
allow such language to be used to me."</p>

<p>"You will regret your violence, sir, when you
are able to view the matter in its proper light,"
observed the colonel. "If you will only hear
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Explanations will not avail with me, sir. It
will be idle, therefore, to attempt them."</p>

<p>Then with a withering look at his wife, he
cried, "You forget, madam, that in this very
room, where you are now sitting, I beheld your
son at your feet. I heard you address him with
all a mother's tenderness."</p>

<p>"I believed him to be the colonel's son," she
rejoined.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

<p>"I don't doubt it," cried her husband, bitterly.
"You had good reasons for the belief."</p>

<p>"Mr. Radcliffe," said Colonel Delacombe,
sternly, "this must proceed no further. You are
merely an instrument in the hands of a malignant
and vindictive woman, who, for purposes of her
own&mdash;which, if I deemed proper, I could easily
explain&mdash;seeks to injure me and destroy your
wife's reputation. How came that letter, from
which you have drawn these erroneous conclusions,
in Mrs. Sutton's possession?"</p>

<p>"I never gave it her," said Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"It must have been stolen to serve the infamous
purpose for which it has been used," said
the colonel. "Call Mrs. Sutton. I engage to
unmask her villainy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was about to ring the bell, but
her husband authoritatively forbade her.</p>

<p>"I won't have her called," he said. "I won't

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

have a scene made. I am quite satisfied with her
conduct. She has done her duty to me."</p>

<p>"She is a perfidious wretch," cried Mrs. Radcliffe.
"Is this her return for all the kindness I
have shown her!"</p>

<p>"A more atrocious scheme was never planned,"
said the colonel. "I will show you the motives
of her conduct&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly satisfied with her motives,"
rejoined Mr. Radcliffe, coldly.</p>

<p>"But you are labouring under an entire misapprehension,
sir. Again, I request that the
woman may be summoned."</p>

<p>"It will answer no purpose," rejoined Mr. Radcliffe,
shaking his head. "Recriminations won't
convince me."</p>

<p>"You are a barbarian," cried his wife&mdash;"a
perfect barbarian!"</p>

<p>"You have made me what I am, madam," he
rejoined.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

<p>"I protest my innocence, sir!&mdash;protest it in the
strongest terms. Will you believe me now?"</p>

<p>"Proofs are against you, madam&mdash;incontestable
proofs."</p>

<p>"Oh! this is too much," she cried, sinking
back. "I shall never survive it."</p>

<p>"I must ring for assistance, sir," said the
colonel.</p>

<p>"Leave her alone," interposed Mr. Radcliffe.
"She has a smelling-bottle near her, if she wants
it."</p>

<p>Hearing this, his wife sprang up in the greatest
indignation.</p>

<p>"I have just said you are a barbarian, Mr.
Radcliffe," she cried; "and I now say you are a
brute. Would you allow me to expire before your
eyes?"</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of your dying. Keep quiet
and listen to me. This frightful secret has only
just been revealed to me, and the agitation it has

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

caused has not allowed me to consider how I
shall act. But I shall do nothing harshly.
Though you have deeply wronged me I will not
expose you to the contumely of the world. Your
worthy father's later years shall not be embittered
by the knowledge of your guilt. Your daughter"&mdash;and
his voice faltered&mdash;"your daughter shall
never learn it. Not for worlds would I have her
know it."</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, Mr. Radcliffe, do not go on
thus. I am your faithful, loving wife."</p>

<p>And she tried to approach him, but he gently
repulsed her.</p>

<p>"Had I known your true character, Esther,
you would never have been my wife. For our
child's sake I will bear with you. But never
again will you be to me what you have been."</p>

<p>She gazed at him as if doubting what he said,
but reading inflexibility in his looks, she uttered

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

an hysterical cry, and would have fallen if he had
not caught her.</p>

<p>This was no pretended faintness, and scarcely
knowing what he was about, Mr. Radcliffe rang
the bell violently, while the colonel bathed the
poor lady's temples with eau-de-Cologne, and gave
her the flacon of salts to smell at.</p>

<p>"Sad work!" he observed to Mr. Radcliffe;
"and to think that all this needless misery has
been caused by that accursed woman. Ah! here
she is," he exclaimed, as the door was opened.
"Now for it!"</p>

<p>But she did not come alone. May was with
her, and on seeing his daughter, Mr. Radcliffe
whispered to the colonel:</p>

<p>"Not a word before her, sir, I insist."</p>

<p>The hypocritical housekeeper flew to her
mistress, and, feigning the greatest concern at
her condition, quickly relieved Mr. Radcliffe of

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

his burden, and placing the lady in her easy-chair,
proceeded to apply fresh restoratives.</p>

<p>May was not so much alarmed as she would
have been, had these fainting-fits been of less frequent
occurrence. Nevertheless, she held one of
her mother's hands in her own, and looked on
anxiously.</p>

<p>"What has caused this, papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can scarcely tell," he replied. "Your
mamma is subject to these attacks, you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe at this moment began to recover
her consciousness. On opening her eyes, and
perceiving Mrs. Sutton near her, she pushed her
off with signs of the greatest aversion.</p>

<p>But a gesture from Mr. Radcliffe prevented her
from giving utterance to her anger.</p>

<p>"I have only waited for Mrs. Radcliffe's recovery
to take my leave," said the colonel. "Pray
make my adieux."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

<p>"You are not going," said the lady, slightly
raising herself. "You are not obliged to return
to town at once."</p>

<p>"Not exactly obliged, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, pray, stay."</p>

<p>"Yes, pray do, colonel," urged May. "Sir
Charles quite calculates on meeting you at
dinner."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't disappoint him. I will stay
with the greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>"Very glad to hear it," cried Mr. Radcliffe,
with affected heartiness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton could scarcely conceal her mortification
at this unexpected turn of affairs.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

<div class="center" id="b2ch24">

<p>XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE WARNING.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Things</span> were now in a most unfortunate position.
Without explaining his connection with
Mrs. Sutton&mdash;without detailing his early history,
which he could not persuade himself to do&mdash;Colonel
Delacombe was unable to remove the
baneful impression produced upon Mr. Radcliffe
by Hilary's letter. Indeed the poor gentleman
absolutely refused to listen to any further explanation.
The colonel therefore was compelled

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

to desist, and allow things to remain as they were
for the present.</p>

<p>Luckily there was a numerous dinner-party that
day, and this offered some distraction. Mr. Radcliffe
had to attend to his guests, and his thoughts
were forcibly turned into other channels. As he
gazed on his beloved child, who was seated next
Sir Charles, and saw how bright and happy she
looked, could he bring a shade upon that lovely
brow? No, she must never learn his griefs.
Mrs. Radcliffe put on a gay mask. Angry with
her husband&mdash;angry with the colonel&mdash;excessively
angry with Mrs. Sutton&mdash;she felt the necessity of
keeping up appearances, and tried to look lively
and unconcerned.</p>

<p>The dinner-party was exceedingly pleasant,
and numbered half a dozen out of the eight
charming girls chosen to act as bridesmaids at
the approaching ceremonial. An equal number

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

of young men had been invited, so there was
plenty of animated conversation, and possibly
some little flirting. Bridesmaids expect to become
brides in their turn, and all these were so pretty,
that it seemed likely their expectations would be
realised. Our inflammable friend Oswald was
struck with a sudden admiration of the golden
tresses and delicately fair complexion of Jessie
Brooke, and paid her great attention. He was
a sad fellow, that Oswald, and his grandsire did
not know what to make of him. If the colonel
was ill at ease as well as his host, no one found
it out. He chanced to sit next to the vicar of
Wootton, who had a very important part to
play at the ceremony, and delighted the reverend
gentleman with his conversation.</p>

<p>After dinner, there was music and a little
carpet-dance for the young folks, in which both
May and her lover took part, for though Sir

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

Charles, as we know, disliked balls, he did not
object to a quiet quadrille. Never had he passed
a happier evening, and he told May, as he bade
her adieu for the night, that he hoped they
should pass many&mdash;many such. Two days only
intervened between them and the consummation
of their happiness. On the third day May
would become Lady Ilminster, and Sir Charles
would be blessed&mdash;so he thought&mdash;with the fairest
bride in England. All looked bright&mdash;too bright,
perhaps, to last. But they had no misgivings.
Possessing everything that can contribute to
human felicity, they had every reasonable expectation
of a long term of uninterrupted bliss.</p>

<p>They parted overnight, as we have described,
Sir Charles assuring his intended bride, as he
pressed her hand, that he had never been so
happy as on that night, and she echoing the
sentiment.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

<p>They met next morning, as arranged. The
whole party had driven over to Boxgrove.
Though Sir Charles did his best to conceal it,
it was evident that he had something on his
mind, but May forbore to question him till they
were alone. She lured him out into the park,
and as they shaped their course towards a grove
his gloom increased&mdash;so much so that she began
to feel quite uncomfortable. At last they sat
down beneath a large oak, whose broad arms
completely sheltered them from the sun. Then
looking earnestly and entreatingly into his face,
she besought him to tell her what was the
matter.</p>

<p>"I have a presentiment of misfortune which
I cannot shake off," he replied, with a sad
smile. "I have had a warning."</p>

<p>The tone in which he pronounced the words
made her blood run cold.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

<p>"A warning!" she echoed.</p>

<p>"Were you never told that we have a singular
superstition?" he rejoined. "It is believed
that each member of our family is warned of
approaching death."</p>

<p>"You are saying this to frighten me, Charlie,"
said May, trying to force a smile, but unable
to repress a shudder.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not," he rejoined. "The warning
is a matter of faith with all of us. There
are too many instances on record to allow of
any doubt."</p>

<p>"You never mentioned this to me before,
Charlie."</p>

<p>"I wish I had not mentioned it now, for I
have banished the roses from your cheeks. However,
I must tell you all, since I have begun.
My ancestor Sir Alberic was accidentally poisoned
by his physician, and it is supposed that

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

the warning is given by the troubled spirit of
this man. Be this as it may, it is certain that
a dark shadowy figure is seen before any of our
family dies at Boxgrove. This I myself can
attest. On the night before the death of my
father, Sir Umfraville, I beheld the shadow."</p>

<p>May uttered an exclamation of mingled astonishment
and horror.</p>

<p>"He was ill at the time, but not thought to be
in danger," he continued. "I was proceeding
along the corridor towards his room, when I saw
a dark figure pass through the door. But I had
no uneasiness, for I thought it was one of the
servants. When I entered, my father was alone,
sleeping in his easy-chair, and breathing heavily.
I aroused him from his troubled slumber, and
he complained that he had just felt a deadly
chill strike to his heart, but I did not tell him
what had caused it. Next night he died."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

<p>May did not dare to ask any further question,
but after a brief pause he went on:</p>

<p>"You know how happy I was last night.
When I sought my couch I was still dwelling
upon the events of the day, and soon sank into
a peaceful slumber. But my repose was disturbed
by a sense of deadly oppression such as
I never before experienced. I felt chilled to
the marrow, and could scarcely breathe. Making
a convulsive effort to shake off the horrible
nightmare, I sprang bolt upright in bed, and
then by the dim moonlight that struggled through
the window-curtains I distinctly beheld a dark
shadow glide through the door. The deadly
chill was then accounted for. I instantly sprang
from my couch, but the door was shut before I
reached it. The next moment, however, I was
in the corridor. No one was there. All was
hushed and still as the grave. The moonbeams

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

fell upon the portrait of Sir Alberic, which
hangs there, as you may remember. The old
warrior seemed to gaze compassionately upon the
last of his long line. I have had my warning,
May."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" she ejaculated, fervently.</p>

<p>"Ah! it would be hard indeed to leave you
for ever, May!" he exclaimed, gazing at her with
unutterable tenderness. "Years hence, I hope
we shall be seated together beneath this tree, and
laugh as we recall the warning. But if it should
be otherwise&mdash;if I should be suddenly snatched
from you by fate&mdash;think of what I now say. My
last thought will be of you&mdash;my last sigh will
breathe your name."</p>

<p>"You will make me perfectly wretched if you
talk thus," she cried. "Ah! if I were to lose
you, I should never be happy again."</p>

<p>"Let us talk of something else. See! there
are visitors," he added, pointing out an open

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

carriage, filled with ladies, which was approaching
the mansion. "Let us go meet them."</p>

<p>She took his arm, and they proceeded slowly
towards the house. A number of persons were
assembled in the garden. The carriage they had
seen brought the two Miss Milwards and Jessie
Brooke, and after a little lively conversation, a
game at croquet was arranged, in which Oswald
and two other young men took part.</p>

<p>Leaving May with Colonel Delacombe to
watch the game, Sir Charles joined Mr. Radcliffe
and Mr. Thornton, who were sauntering along the
lawn, and begged them to step into the house
with him for a few minutes, and they all three
passed through an open French window into the
library.</p>

<p>"I require your professional assistance, Mr.
Thornton," observed Sir Charles, as they entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Most happy to afford it you," replied the

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

old gentleman. "What do you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>"To make my will," replied the other.</p>

<p>Both his hearers expressed surprise, and Mr.
Thornton thought the baronet must be joking.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly serious," remarked Sir Charles.
"I want the thing done without delay."</p>

<p>"I should be the last person to oppose your
determination," said Mr. Thornton; "and I will
carry your intentions into effect, if you desire
it, but the disposition of a large property like
yours ought to be carefully considered. I will
take down any instructions you may give me,
Sir Charles," he added, seating himself at a table
on which writing materials were placed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better retire," remarked Mr.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"On no account," said the baronet. "I desire
your presence, but beg you not to comment upon

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

my instructions. Let the instrument be as brief
as possible," he added to Mr. Thornton. "With
the exception of a legacy of thirty thousand
pounds to my sister, Lady Richborough, I mean
to leave the whole of my property, real and
personal&mdash;Boxgrove, and all my other estates, to
May."</p>

<p>"You have requested me not to make a
comment, Sir Charles," observed Mr. Radcliffe;
"but I cannot help saying that you are acting
far too generously towards my daughter."</p>

<p>"Mr. Radcliffe," said Sir Charles, with profound
emotion, "your daughter is dearer to me than
any one on earth. Except the sum devoted to
my sister, all I have shall be hers."</p>

<p>The tone in which he spoke left no doubt that
his resolution was taken, and Mr. Thornton
forbore to make a remark.</p>

<p>"I am ready to begin, Sir Charles," he said,

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

taking up a pen; "but I think you had better
delay the matter until after your marriage."</p>

<p>"Not for a single day&mdash;not for an hour," he
rejoined. "No telling what may happen."</p>

<p>"Very true," observed the old gentleman.
"Well, I'll make it as short as I can. Who are
to be the executors?"</p>

<p>"Yourself and Mr. Radcliffe, if you will undertake
the office."</p>

<p>No objections made. The old gentleman set
to work, and in a very few minutes drew up the
document, which, important as it was, did not
occupy more than half a side of paper.</p>

<p>"This is sufficiently concise, I think," he remarked.</p>

<p>And he read what he had written to Sir
Charles, who signified his perfect approval, adding
that he wished to execute the instrument forthwith.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

<p>"In that case we must have witnesses," said
Mr. Thornton. "Lend me your signet-ring, Sir
Charles."</p>

<p>While the old gentleman was placing a seal in
black wax on the document, Mr. Dancer and
two other men-servants were summoned, and in
their presence the will was duly executed by Sir
Charles, who requested Mr. Thornton to take
charge of the document.</p>

<p>"Now that the thing is done, Sir Charles,"
said the old gentleman, "I must remark that
you have hurried yourself very unnecessarily."</p>

<p>"I wished to get the business off my mind,"
replied the other.</p>

<p>Just then May and Colonel Delacombe appeared
at the open window.</p>

<p>"Not a word to her," said the baronet, with,
a gesture of silence.</p>

<p>She had come to ask him to join the croquet

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

party, and he willingly complied. He had now
quite recovered his cheerfulness, and seemed to
have forgotten the nocturnal incident that had
caused him so much disquietude.</p>

<p>By this time several more visitors had arrived,
and a large and gaily dressed assemblage, in
which the gentler sex predominated, was collected
on the lawn, where croquet was being played.
After an hour spent very agreeably, the gong
summoned the company to luncheon, and both
Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton remarked that
Sir Charles was in higher spirits than usual.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, croquet was resumed, and kept
up till six o'clock, when the visitors departed, and
our friends returned to Hazlemere to dinner.</p>

<p>Sir Charles drove May in a mail phaeton which
he had just launched. There was another dinner
party that day, graced by all the pretty girls who
had dined there the day before, together with

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

three or four others, and a very lively dinner it
was, for the champagne flowed freely. Music and
dancing followed as before. Plans were made for
next day&mdash;never, alas! to be realised.</p>

<p>When the moment for separation came the
dread presentiment which Sir Charles had hitherto
repressed again forced itself upon him. He could
scarcely bid her adieu. She, too, felt saddened&mdash;and
so they parted for ever!</p>

<p>Anxious to hide his emotion. Sir Charles
sprang into the mail phaeton, that was waiting
for him at the hall-door. He was quickly followed
by Colonel Delacombe, who had agreed
to return with him to Boxgrove. Next moment
they dashed off, and kept up the pace so well
that within a quarter of an hour they were in
sight of the park gates. It was a lovely moonlight
night, and the colonel enjoyed the drive
immensely. He smoked his cigar quietly, and

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

did not trouble himself to talk much, for Sir
Charles did not seem inclined for conversation.</p>

<p>All at once, however, he was roused from
the dreamy reverie into which he had fallen.
Something startled the horses&mdash;he could not tell
what&mdash;for neither he nor Kennedy, the groom,
saw anything, but they both heard Sir Charles
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Good God! there it is again!"</p>

<p>At the same moment the horses set off at a
furious pace, and soon became unmanageable.
Sir Charles, though an admirable whip, could
not hold them. Perhaps he was unnerved by
what he had seen. On they dashed, tearing the
ground with their hoofs, till they reached the
lodge-gates, which unluckily had been thrown
open.</p>

<p>Accustomed to this entrance, the infuriated
animals made an attempt to pass through the

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

gates, but their blind impetuosity brought the
carriage in contact with a post and upset the
vehicle, throwing out its occupants with great
violence.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe, though much shaken by
the fall, soon regained his legs, and so did
Kennedy, but the ill-fated baronet did not move.
Roused by the tremendous crash, the lodgekeeper
rushed forth, and, seizing the horses, prevented
further mischief.</p>

<p>Attention was now turned to Sir Charles, and
on raising him, it became evident that he had
sustained frightful injuries about the head. Indeed,
the colonel feared that the skull was
fractured.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable, the unfortunate man
was carried into the lodge and laid upon a bed.
He groaned deeply, but could not speak. The
colonel tended him like a brother. By his directions,

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

Kennedy mounted one of the horses and
rode off to Wootton in quest of Mr. Malham.
But before the surgeon arrived the spirit had
fled of as gallant a gentleman as ever breathed.</p>

<p>XXV.</p>

<p class="small">HOW THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT TO HAZLEMERE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night most of the inmates of Hazlemere
had retired to rest full of pleasant anticipations
of the morrow, but Luff, the butler, and Boston,
who slept at the back of the house, were roused
from their first slumbers by Kennedy.</p>

<p>The afflicting news was conveyed by the butler
to his master and Mr. Thornton, and filled them
with consternation. The two gentlemen soon
came down-stairs, and were preparing to set
out for Boxgrove, when they were stopped by

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

the arrival of Mr. Malham, who came to inform
them that all was over. Both were stunned by
the dreadful intelligence.</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton,
when he regained his speech. "How remarkable
that Sir Charles should have just made
his will. And how anxious he was that there
should be no delay. He might have had a presentiment
of his approaching end."</p>

<p>"What a frightful shock it will be to May!"
groaned Mr. Radcliffe. "Enough to kill her."</p>

<p>"I hope Colonel Delacombe is not much
hurt?" inquired Mr. Thornton of the surgeon.</p>

<p>"A good deal shaken, but otherwise uninjured,"
replied Mr. Malham. "He wished to
accompany me, but I prevailed upon him to
go up to the hall. It will be better for him to
be quiet, though he seems made of iron."</p>

<p>Having fulfilled his sad errand, the surgeon left

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

them, promising to call again early on the morrow.
But he was not allowed to quit the house without
an interview with Mrs. Sutton. Though as little
noise as possible was made, the housekeeper heard
certain sounds that alarmed her, and hastily attiring
herself, came down-stairs, just in time to
catch him. She soon learnt the terrible truth.</p>

<p>"But Colonel Delacombe was with Sir Charles,"
she cried. "Is he, too, killed?"</p>

<p>"No. Fortunately, he has escaped almost
unhurt."</p>

<p>"Fate is unjust," she cried. "Sir Charles
ought to have been the one spared."</p>

<p>"Very true. What a dreadful business! Never
knew anything so shocking. Poor Sir Charles!
killed in the prime of life, and just on the eve of
marriage with the girl he adored. Dreadful!"</p>

<p>To his horror the door opened and May came
in&mdash;a taper in her hand, and looking excessively

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

pale. As it chanced she had not retired to rest,
and being alarmed by the disturbance in the
house, instead of ringing her bell had come down
to see what had happened. On beholding the
surgeon, her uneasiness increased.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to find me here at this time
of night, Miss Radcliffe," he said. "The fact
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not disguise the truth, Mr. Malham," she
interrupted. "Sir Charles has been taken suddenly
ill. I am sure of it. You have come to tell
us so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be best to prepare her,"
thought the surgeon. "It is strange you should
think this, Miss Radcliffe," he observed. "But
don't be alarmed, my dear young lady, don't be
alarmed."</p>

<p>"Is there any danger?" she asked, with forced
calmness.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

<p>"In illness there is always a certain danger,"
he answered, evasively.</p>

<p>"But what is the nature of the attack? Speak
plainly. It must have been very sudden. He
was perfectly well when he went away."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was very sudden," he replied, glancing
at the housekeeper.</p>

<p>The look did not pass unnoticed by May.</p>

<p>"Luff and Boston were in the hall as I came
down-stairs," she said, "and I heard them talking
about an accident. But they hurried off before I
could question them. Were they speaking of Sir
Charles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sorry to say he has met with an
accident&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then my fears are realised," she cried, with
a look of so much anguish that the surgeon regretted
his words.</p>

<p>But he was spared the necessity of further

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

explanation by Mr. Radcliffe, who, having heard
his daughter's voice, hastened to her.</p>

<p>From her looks he thought she had learnt the
dreadful truth.</p>

<p>"Heaven sustain you under this dire affliction,
my dear child!" he exclaimed, clasping her to his
breast. "Malham has told you all."</p>

<p>"He has told me nothing, papa," she exclaimed.
"He has tried to keep the fatal truth from me.
But I divined it."</p>

<p>"Alas! my dear child, I cannot hide it from
you. You have lost him."</p>

<p>Crying out, as if a shot had pierced her heart,
she became insensible in his arms.</p>

<p>"God forgive me! I fear I have killed her,
Malham," he cried to the surgeon.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;no. The shock could not be otherwise
than severe. But it will pass. We must take
her up to her room, Mrs. Sutton, and you will remain

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

with her during the night. Do not distress
yourself, sir. I will answer for her recovery."</p>

<p>The tender father carried her up-stairs himself.
At the door of her chamber he consigned her to
the surgeon and the housekeeper, and paced to
and fro in the passage till they came forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Malham looked much moved, and Mrs.
Sutton was weeping.</p>

<p>"Why have you both left her?" cried Mr.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to fear," replied the surgeon.
"She wishes to be alone&mdash;to seek for consolation
where she is sure to find it. Your daughter is an
angel, sir. Mrs. Sutton will return to her presently.
Now take my advice, and go to bed. I
will be with you early in the morning."</p>

<p class="small">THE YOUNG MISTRESS OF BOXGROVE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> event could have caused a more painful
sensation than the awfully sudden death of Sir
Charles Ilminster, occurring as it did under circumstances
so peculiarly distressing. Popular
with all classes of society, the ill-fated baronet was
universally regretted.</p>

<p>It was thought remarkable that he should have
endowed his intended bride with the whole of his
large fortune on the very day on which he accidentally
met his death; but this proved the depth

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

of his attachment to her, and added to the general
regret that a cruel fate would not permit their
union&mdash;a union which no one doubted would have
been happy.</p>

<p>To May herself the splendid provision made for
her served only to aggravate her sorrow. She
understood the motives&mdash;inexplicable to others&mdash;that
had actuated him in making his will so hastily.
She recalled every word he had spoken to her,
and felt sure he had thought of her at the last.</p>

<p>As her grief, at first overwhelming, began to
abate, she was able to realise the position in which
Sir Charles's magnificent bequest had placed her.
But the wealth she had acquired could not console
her, though it might in some degree mitigate the
sharpness of her affliction. She loved Boxgrove
because he had loved the place, and because its
antique chambers, its galleries, its gardens, and
its groves recalled his image. He was laid among

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

his ancestors in the family vault beneath the
chapel attached to the Hall, and she daily visited
his tomb.</p>

<p>Nothing had been changed at Boxgrove since
the house had come into her hands. All the establishment
was kept up as it had been in Sir
Charles's time. She confided the management of
the house to Mr. Thornton and Mrs. Woodcot,
who lived with her, and if visitors came she left
the old gentleman and her aunt to entertain them.
She refused for the present to mix with society,
declaring she had lost all taste for it.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that she had given
way to gloom, and that the secluded life she now
led was caused by a morbid feeling of melancholy.
Something of her former cheerfulness had returned;
and though she had lost the bright look
that once belonged to her, and the winning smile
that constantly played about her lips had fled, yet

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

the serene and pensive expression of her countenance
heightened its interest. She was graver
than before. Sorrow had chastened her heart, but
not altered the sweetness of her disposition. Aunt
Woodcot thought her more charming than ever,
and we incline to think that Aunt Woodcot was
right. Grandpapa, whose notions of her had
become more exalted with the increase of her
wealth, hoped that she would eventually take a
very high place in society, but he was content to
wait. The young mistress of Boxgrove was now
looked upon as the best match in the county, and
as nobody supposed she had vowed eternal fidelity
to the memory of poor Sir Charles, everybody
wondered who would be fortunate enough to
obtain her hand. A great deal of court was paid
to the Radcliffes as well as to the guardians at
Boxgrove, and more than one advantageous offer
was quietly declined, without being submitted to
the young lady.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

<p>Mr. Thornton was extremely well satisfied with
his position&mdash;and no wonder. Virtually master
of a large mansion and a large establishment,
he had nothing to do but to study his own
comforts, and these he attended to most sedulously.</p>

<p>Aunt Woodcot was equally comfortable. To
her, indeed, Boxgrove was a sort of paradise,
and her only dread was that she might, one
day, be obliged to quit it. Consequently, she
was by no means anxious that her niece should
marry&mdash;unless she married Oswald, of which
there seemed little chance. Mrs. Woodcot could
now vie with Mrs. Radcliffe, had a carriage entirely
at her disposal, and was in fact a person
of considerable importance.</p>

<p>To Myrtilla, Sir Charles's sudden death had
been a great shock. She was sincerely attached
to her brother, but the handsome legacy he had
left her, in some measure reconciled her to his

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

loss. She rather envied May her large acquisitions,
but did not complain of being ill-treated.
She came down to see "the young widow," as
she called her, but was dreadfully bored by Aunt
Woodcot, and found the old house duller and
more like a convent than ever. Consequently she
spent most of her time at Hazlemere.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe had gone abroad and taken
Hilary with him. They were now at Castellammare,
near Naples, in the midst of vineyards
and orange-groves. Having received a great
deal of encouragement from Lady Richborough,
the young man was foolish enough to propose
to her, and being rejected, was still more foolish
to take his rejection to heart. To cure him the
colonel took him abroad. It must not be imagined
for a moment that the colonel and Myrtilla
had quarrelled. They were on as friendly terms
as ever, and kept up a constant correspondence.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

<p>Knowing they would interest her, Lady Richborough
showed Mrs. Radcliffe several of the
colonel's letters, in all of which he spoke of
Hilary with great affection. In the last that had
come to hand he told her that the young man
was perfectly cured of his foolish passion. "But
I am half afraid," he added, "that he has fallen
desperately in love with a fascinating Neapolitan
countess, who is staying at the same hotel with
us."</p>

<p>"Not very flattering to me," remarked Myrtilla.
"But I am glad to hear it, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"I fancied you liked him," said Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Not well enough to marry him. I wonder
why men will propose to me. They ought to
know better. I have no idea of giving up my
liberty. Were I in May's position, and mistress
of Boxgrove, nothing should induce me to marry.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

<p>"I don't think she will," observed Mrs. Radcliffe.
"She is inconsolable."</p>

<p>"Inconsolable! I don't believe that. Her
fidelity will be put to the test pretty severely
by-and-by, you may depend upon it. Plenty of
suitors will make their appearance, or I'm very
much mistaken, and then we shall see what she
will do. By-the-by, did she ever inform you that
she had her fortune told at Ascot?"</p>

<p>"She mentioned the circumstance, but did
not tell me what the gipsy said."</p>

<p>"It was a singular prediction. I laughed at
it then, but I don't know what to think now.
It may be fulfilled. Who knows? But to return
to the colonel. He inquires if Mrs. Sutton
is still with you. I am glad I can tell him she
is gone. I won't ask what she did, but I know
she was dreadfully mischievous."</p>

<p>"The mischief she has made can never be

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

set right, I fear. Mr. Radcliffe has never been
like himself since she poisoned his mind by her
falsehoods. To me she behaved infamously. I
treated her like a friend, not as a servant, and
gave her my entire confidence. She requited me
with the basest ingratitude."</p>

<p>"Have you never discovered the motives of
her malice? I know enough of her history to
be able to enlighten you as to them. You inadvertently
committed a great error in taking
her into the house. I am certain she has all
along nourished feelings of jealous dislike to you.
The colonel's appearance roused these feelings
into activity, and unluckily, as it seems, you
have placed yourself sufficiently in her power to
enable her to do you an injury."</p>

<p>"What has she to do with the colonel?" cried
Mrs. Radcliffe, startled. "I thought they were
utter strangers to each other."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

<p>"Strangers!" echoed Myrtilla. "He knew her
long before he knew you."</p>

<p>"Was she his mistress?"</p>

<p>"His <i>wife</i>," replied Lady Richborough. "And
Hilary is their son. Now you must understand
it all?"</p>

<p>"I do, I do," cried Mrs. Radcliffe. "I understand
it too well."</p>

<p>"You must not do him an injustice. When
he sought your hand, he believed that death had
freed him from the chain which he had so foolishly
imposed upon himself. It is due to him
that you should be satisfied on this point." And
she proceeded to give her the details of the
colonel's unfortunate marriage. To these Mrs.
Radcliffe listened with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>"Until his return from India he believed the
wretched woman dead," said Myrtilla, in conclusion;
"and you may conceive his horror when

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

he found he had been deceived by a false report.
Not the least surprising part of the strange
story is that she should be here&mdash;with you&mdash;and
that their son should be brought hither likewise.
It looks like fatality."</p>

<p>"Strange, indeed," said Mrs. Radcliffe. "There
has always been a certain mystery about Mrs.
Sutton, but if I had known who she was I should
have been frightened to death of her."</p>

<p>"What has become of her?" asked Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell. She left quite suddenly, and
contrary to Mr. Radcliffe's wishes. It would
seem, however, that she had made preparations for
her departure, for her packages were ready, and
she left nothing behind her. She proceeded to
London, as we suppose, but she has not been heard
of since."</p>

<p>"I fear you have not seen the last of her," observed

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

Myrtilla. "What a misfortune to be tied
so such a wretch!&mdash;and I see no chance of the
colonel's deliverance. Hilary is not aware that
she is his mother, but he must learn the secret one
of these days."</p>

<p>"Yes, however disagreeable it may be to the
colonel, an explanation must be given," observed
Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>The foregoing conversation will afford some
notion of the state of things at Hazlemere. Mrs.
Sutton was indeed gone, and no tidings had been
received of her since her departure. Her loss
was a serious grievance to Mrs. Radcliffe, and
even the servants regretted her, for she had contrived
to secure their good will. But no one
regretted her so much as Mr. Malham. He made
constant inquiries after her, and vainly tried to
ascertain her address.</p>

<div class="center" id="b3ch02">

<p>II.</p>

<p class="small">A LETTER FROM LADY RICHBOROUGH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> spring has arrived. May Day is
again approaching, but no change has yet taken
place in the mode of life of the young mistress
of Boxgrove. Grandpapa and Aunt Woodcot
still reside with her. Mrs. Trapp, poor Sir
Charles's housekeeper, who could not brook Mrs.
Woodcot's control, has taken Mrs. Sutton's place
at Hazlemere. This is the only change in the
establishment. There are rarely any visitors, and

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

consequently the house is as quiet as quiet can be&mdash;rather
too quiet, indeed, for Mr. Thornton.
The Radcliffes are almost as much at Boxgrove
as Hazlemere. Mr. Radcliffe has never been able
to reconcile himself to the loss of Mrs. Sutton.
Neither he nor his wife know what has become of
her, as she has never written to them since her
departure. Her conduct appears strange and inexplicable
to Mr. Radcliffe, but does not surprise
his wife, who is delighted to be released from the
thraldom in which she has so long been kept.
She is sometimes tempted to take Mrs. Trapp into
her confidence, but warned by previous experience,
prudently abstains. Not even to Mrs. Woodcot
has she disclosed the secret of Colonel Delacombe's
unfortunate marriage, but the thought of it often
troubles her. She never hears from the colonel
now. All correspondence between them has
ceased. But she obtains tidings of him from

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

Lady Richborough, and is aware that he is still
abroad with his adopted son. She is also aware
that he has been dangerously ill, having been
attacked by fever and ague at Rome, but is now
convalescent.</p>

<p>Things were in this state at the two houses,
when one day a communication was received by
Mrs. Radcliffe from Lady Richborough, which it
will be proper to lay before the reader. The
letter arrived by the early post while Mrs. Radcliffe
was at breakfast, but she did not read it
till she was alone in her boudoir.</p>

<br/>

<p>"You are quite aware, dear Mrs. Radcliffe,
that I do not approve of the secluded life that
our dear May is leading, and think she ought to
assume the position in society to which the large
fortune left her by my brother entitles her. A
lovely girl, not yet twenty, with the most brilliant

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

prospects before her, cannot be allowed to bury
herself alive. Poor Sir Charles would not have
demanded such a sacrifice. She has paid the full
tribute of regret to his memory, and having an
important part to play in the world, cannot shrink
from it. Such is my opinion, and such, I feel
sure, must also be your opinion.</p>

<p>"I need not remind you of the immense sensation
she produced last spring. But for her
engagement to poor dear Charlie she would have
had no end of offers. Chief among her conquests
was Lord Robert Tadcaster, who was desperately
smitten. At that time he had nothing
beyond his title to recommend him. The case is
very different now, since, as you must be aware,
by the demise of his father and elder brother, he
has become Marquis of Hartlepool. With princely
domains in Berkshire and Kent, two noble country
seats, and a splendid house in Arlington-street, the
marquis need not look far for a bride. The

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

proudest peer in the realm would be happy to give
him his daughter.</p>

<p>"You will guess on whom his choice has fallen.
The lovely girl who captivated him last spring
still remains mistress of his affections, and he has
commissioned me to write to you, and make her a
formal offer of his hand.</p>

<p>"A proposal from a nobleman of such distinction
as the Marquis of Hartlepool cannot be
otherwise than favourably entertained&mdash;at least
by you and Mr. Radcliffe. I account it a signal
honour. But in May's present frame of mind
she may be insensible to the importance of the
offer, and if left to herself might decline it. It is
to prevent the possibility of such a mischance
that I now write, urging you to leave nothing
undone to bring about a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>"I think you will do better without me than
with me; but if you fancy I can be of the slightest
use, let me know, and I will run down at once.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

<p>"Grandpapa and Aunt Woodcot must exert
their influence. Nothing must be neglected. All
sorts of good wishes to you all. Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">"Your affectionate,<br/>

"<span class="smcap">Myrtilla</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>"P.S. I must not omit to tell you that Colonel
Delacombe is in Paris on his way back&mdash;much
better, though still suffering from the effects of
the fever. Hilary is with him. Of course I
have told him of Mrs. Sutton's departure, and
that nothing has been heard of her since. I shall
write to inform him of May's splendid offer. Once
more, adieu!"</p>

<br/>

<p>In an ecstasy of delight, Mrs. Radcliffe rushed
down-stairs to communicate the joyful intelligence
to her husband. She found him in the library
with Mr. Thornton, who had just ridden over from
Boxgrove.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

<p>"Oh! I am so glad you are here," she cried to
her father. "I have such wonderful news for
you&mdash;and for you too, my dear. What do you
think? Our darling May has had an offer from
no less a person than the Marquis of Hartlepool."</p>

<p>"Why, he's her old admirer, Lord Robert
Tadcaster&mdash;only raised to the first rank of the
peerage," observed Mr. Thornton. "He was
deuced lucky in getting rid of his elder brother,
the earl."</p>

<p>"You shall hear what Lady Richborough says
about him, for it is through her that the offer has
been made," replied Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>And taking a seat, she read the letter, which
produced a great effect upon both her hearers.
When she had done, the old gentleman manifested
his delight by a chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, this surpasses my expectations," he
cried. "As her ladyship very properly observes.

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

the proposal of a nobleman of such distinction as
the Marquis of Hartlepool is a signal honour."</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe was less excited, and quietly
remarked, "I feel as much gratified as you do,
Mr. Thornton, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There must be no 'buts' in the case," interrupted
the old gentleman. "May <i>must</i> accept
the marquis."</p>

<p>"Decidedly my opinion," said Mrs. Radcliffe.
"There can be no hesitation. Where the interests
of the family are concerned, as they are
now, she is bound to sacrifice her own feelings.
But I do not see that she can raise any objection
to her noble suitor. She rather liked him as Lord
Robert Tadcaster."</p>

<p>"If she did, which I very much doubt," observed
Mr. Radcliffe, "poor Sir Charles did not share
her sentiments. I hope she will view the matter
in the same light that we do; but I have great
misgivings."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

<p>"She cannot be allowed to have her own way,"
cried Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mr. Thornton. "Lady
Richborough urges me to exert my influence over
her, and I shall not fail to do so. But if you
exercise your paternal authority, she will not
venture to disobey," he added to Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I shall simply state my wishes," replied the
worthy gentleman. "Personally, I feel honoured
by the offer. It would be a proud day to me to
see my daughter wedded to the Marquis of Hartlepool,
but I will not force her to accept him. As
far as I am concerned, I shall leave the decision
entirely to herself."</p>

<p>"I really have no patience with you, my dear,"
exclaimed Mrs. Radcliffe. "May has been allowed
to indulge her grief a great deal too long,
and it will be a reproach to us if we allow her to
continue in this state of seclusion. I have not as
yet interfered with her, because, judging by other

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

people, I naturally concluded that her sorrow
would abate, but I see no signs of improvement.
I should be as weak as the girl herself if I suffered
her to throw away this brilliant chance because
she is unwilling to cast off her sentimental
sorrow. I shall point out what she ought to do,
and insist upon compliance with my injunctions."</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton signified his approval very emphatically.</p>

<p>"You forget, Mr. Radcliffe," pursued the lady,
"that May is not yet twenty. Are you justified
in allowing her to have her own way?"</p>

<p>"Though under twenty, she is her own mistress,
and can act as she pleases," replied Mr.
Radcliffe. "If she prefers retirement to splendour;
if, from motives which I can appreciate,
she declines to marry, I shall not attempt to dissuade
her from following her inclinations!"</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton coughed dryly, and winked at his
daughter.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

<p>"All very fine," cried Mrs. Radcliffe, with a
sneer. "But I will do my best to make her Marchioness
of Hartlepool."</p>

<p>"And so will I," added the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe then arose, and intimated her
intention of writing to Lady Richborough to
thank her for her letter, and tell her how highly
honoured they all felt by the marquis's proposal,
and that no time should be lost in laying it before
May.</p>

<p>"After luncheon," she added, "we will drive
over to Boxgrove, and I will then speak to the
dear child, and ascertain her sentiments. If I
find it necessary, I shall use a little gentle&mdash;very
gentle&mdash;persuasion. Are you going, papa?" she
added to Mr. Thornton, who followed her to the
door. "Won't you stay luncheon?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "I want to astonish Mrs.
Woodcot with the wonderful news."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

<p>"I'm not sure that she will be pleased," said
Mrs. Radcliffe. "But not a word to May till I
arrive."</p>

<p>"That is quite understood," rejoined the old
gentleman. "Good-bye for the present. We
shall meet again anon."</p>

<p>With this he proceeded to the stable, mounted
his stout cob, and trotted off to Boxgrove, determined
in his own mind that his grand-daughter
should become Marchioness of Hartlepool.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p class="small">OSWALD REAPPEARS AS A SUITOR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching the mansion, he found, to his
surprise, that Oswald had just arrived, and he
was a good deal put out by the circumstance, for
he knew that Mrs. Woodcot still cherished hopes
of securing the great prize for her son.</p>

<p>"What the deuce has brought him here at
this juncture?" thought the old gentleman. "He
will be confoundedly in the way. I must try to
get rid of him."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

<p>Oswald was with his mother in a charming
little room looking upon the garden, which Mrs.
Woodcot had appropriated; and to this room Mr.
Thornton at once repaired. He greeted Oswald
with his usual cordiality, but expressed surprise
at seeing him.</p>

<p>"I am here in obedience to a summons which I
received from my mother, sir," replied the young
man.</p>

<p>"You have brought a lot of luggage with you,
I find," cried his grandsire, rather gruffly. "I
suppose you mean to make a long stay."</p>

<p>"I shall only stay as long as I can make myself
agreeable, sir," rejoined Oswald. "My mother
will explain to you why she sent for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a little project in view for him,
and calculate upon your assistance," observed Mrs.
Woodcot.</p>

<p>"Before you say any more," interrupted Mr.
Thornton, anticipating what was coming, "let me

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

give you a piece of news which I have brought
back with me from Hazlemere. The Marquis of
Hartlepool has made May a formal proposal of
marriage. The offer has been conveyed by Lady
Richborough to Mrs. Radcliffe. What do you
think of that, eh?"</p>

<p>"What do I think of it?" cried Oswald, in
dismay. "I think it an infernal nuisance!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried Mr. Thornton. "You have let
the cat out of the bag. This spoils your little
game, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I rather think it does; and though
the proposed alliance may be very dazzling, I
cannot doubt that you will give the preference
to your own grandson. Surely it will be better
to keep this fine place in our own family than
relinquish it to a nobleman in whom you have no
interest."</p>

<p>"Oswald's claims upon you are superior to
those of any other," observed Mrs. Woodcot.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

<p>"You seem to forget that he has already been
rejected. What likelihood is there that he will
be accepted now?"</p>

<p>"Every likelihood, if you will assist me, sir,"
cried the young man. "None if you support my
noble rival."</p>

<p>"You are always sanguine, Oswald," observed
his grandsire; "but I don't think you have a
ghost of a chance; so you may as well retire
from a contest in which you are certain to be
worsted."</p>

<p>"Never," cried Oswald. "I am more in love
with May than ever."</p>

<p>"With her fortune?" said his grandsire.</p>

<p>"With herself. And I shall esteem you a
very unnatural grandfather if you desert me
now."</p>

<p>"I have given you plenty of proofs of my
affection," said the old gentleman. "I make
you a tolerably good allowance. I have constituted

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

you my heir, and if you can find a wife
of whom I approve, money shan't stand in the
way. But I tell you fairly I can't and won't
help you now. This is a most important alliance,
and I shall do my best to promote it. We
have settled it amongst us, and it is to be."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear it," observed Mrs.
Woodcot. "You have very little consideration
for May's happiness. Grand though the alliance
may be, Boxgrove is too high a price to
pay for it."</p>

<p>"I'll hear no more on the subject," said Mr.
Thornton, in a positive tone. "Take my advice,
Oswald. Propose to Jessie Brooke. She'll suit
both of us."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'll forswear marriage altogether."</p>

<p>"As you please," rejoined his grandsire. "But
mark me! not a word to May before her mother's
arrival."</p>

<p>And he quitted the room.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

<p>"So our scheme's upset," cried Oswald. "The
old gentleman is dead against us."</p>

<p>"We are not beaten yet," replied his mother.
"In spite of his interdiction, I will speak to
May."</p>

<p>On leaving Mrs. Woodcot and her son, Mr.
Thornton, who did not feel altogether easy, put
on his hat, and sallied out into the garden. The
strong appeal made to him had not been without
effect, though he resisted it, but as he walked
along the terrace, ever and anon pausing to
survey the stately old mansion, or allow his gaze
to wander over the park, he could not help
feeling that it would be a pity to allow so magnificent
a place to go out of the family. Still,
he held to his determination.</p>

<p>"No, no," he mentally ejaculated, "I must not
hesitate. It is painful to me to thwart Oswald&mdash;vexatious
to give up this place, but I must do
it. May must be Marchioness of Hartlepool."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

<p>While thus musing, he saw the young lady
herself issue from a yew-tree alley at the farther
end of the garden. She was not alone, and
either his eyes deceived him or the person with
her was Mrs. Sutton. Greatly surprised, he stood
still to examine the latter personage more narrowly,
and became convinced that he was right.
For a minute or two neither of them noticed
him, but when they did so, Mrs. Sutton instantly
disappeared in the alley. The old gentleman's
curiosity was greatly excited by the incident.</p>

<p>May now advanced to meet him. Her deep
mourning set off the exquisite fairness of her
complexion, and her beauty was not diminished
by the shade of sadness that sat upon her brow.</p>

<p>"Good day, dear grandpapa," she said. "I
thought you were at Hazlemere."</p>

<p>"Just come back," he rejoined. "Your
mamma will be here by-and-by. She has got
famous news for you&mdash;but I mustn't forestall it.

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

Pray who was with you just now? Surely it
couldn't be Mrs. Sutton, yet it looked uncommonly
like her."</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Sutton," replied May. "But I
must entreat you not to mention to mamma or
any of them that you have seen her. I have
promised that her visit shall be kept secret."</p>

<p>"I suppose I mustn't ask what she has come
about?"</p>

<p>"Please don't, for I can't tell you."</p>

<p>"At least, you can tell me why she has never
written to your mamma since she left Hazlemere."</p>

<p>"I can answer no questions respecting her,"
returned May, mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Well, I think, if I were you, I wouldn't
encourage her visits. If she must come at all,
let her come openly. In any case, don't let her
persuade you to engage her as housekeeper. She
and your aunt would never get on together."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

<p>"Mrs. Sutton has no wish to take the situation,
grandpapa, and I should never dream of
offering it to her."</p>

<p>"Well, come and sit down with me on this
bench. I want to talk to you. It sometimes
occurs to me, my dear child," he observed, regarding
her earnestly, "that you must be tired
of the quiet life you are leading here."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, dear grandpapa, I am perfectly
happy&mdash;that is, as happy as I can ever
hope to be," she remarked, with a sigh. "I grow
fonder of the place every day, and never desire
to quit it. All those I love are with me, or come
to see me daily, and I care for no other society.
I do not find the time pass heavily. As you
know, I am always employed, and though sadness
will sometimes steal over me, I never give way
to gloom. Make yourself easy about me, dear
grandpapa. I like this tranquil mode of life,

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

wholly free from excitement, and my only fear is
lest something should occur to disturb it."</p>

<p>"All very pretty, but you are too young to
retire from the world, and really must return to
it. If you were some thirty or forty years older&mdash;had
entirely lost your charms&mdash;had incurred
many disappointments&mdash;I would not say a word
against the course you are pursuing. But you
are in the very spring-time of life, when everything
wears its brightest and gayest colours&mdash;as
we may see by glancing at those parterres&mdash;and
when your spirits ought to be at their best.
Grief does not endure for ever. It is not meant
that it should do so. Ere long, when the wounds
in your heart are fully healed, the image which
is now constantly before you will insensibly fade
away, and be succeeded by another. New objects
of interest will arise, and if you do not
forget the past, you will think of it without pain.

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

This is the law of nature, and your case can
be no exception to the law."</p>

<p>May sighed, but made no answer, and grandpapa
went on:</p>

<p>"You must consider, my dear, that you have
duties to fulfil in connection with your large property&mdash;duties
that cannot be neglected. You are
bound to occupy a certain position."</p>

<p>"But you and papa discharge all these duties
for me. You know, dear grandpapa, I cannot
attend to matters of business, and do not even
understand them. Whatever you deem necessary,
I will do. Hitherto you have spared me
all trouble, and I cannot be sufficiently grateful
for your kindness."</p>

<p>"I do not speak of matters of business, my
dear, but of the duties incumbent upon your
position. You cannot consistently avoid taking
your proper place in society. Already, I and

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

your aunt have been blamed for allowing you
to immure yourself so long&mdash;you know with what
justice. I can no longer, therefore, forbear to
remonstrate. The idea may be repugnant to
your present feelings, but since with your large
fortune you are not likely to remain single, let
me counsel you to marry a man of rank&mdash;of
<i>high rank</i>. You <i>can</i> do it. Think over what I
have said."</p>

<p>So saying, he got up and marched off at a
quick pace towards the farther end of the garden.</p>

<p>May was ruminating over his words, and wondering
whether they had any special significance,
when she was joined by her aunt, who
came out to tell her that Oswald had unexpectedly
arrived.</p>

<p>"But you look unusually sad, my love," said
Mrs. Woodcot, with an air of much concern.
"What distresses you? You know you can confide
all your little griefs to me."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

<p>"I fear I do not make you and grandpapa
as comfortable as I desire," replied May. "Is
there anything I can do for you? Only tell
me, and it shall be done."</p>

<p>"You perfectly astonish me, my love. Surely
your grandpapa has not been complaining? He
sometimes grumbles without reason."</p>

<p>"No, aunty dear, he has not been complaining.
But he does not seem quite satisfied with me,
and I am sure I am most anxious to please
him."</p>

<p>"You must have misapprehended him, my love.
What has he been saying to you?"</p>

<p>"He says that people blame you and him for
allowing me to lead so retired a life, and that
you ought to force me to go into society. Now
society, as you know, dear aunty, is utterly distasteful
to me. I am not equal to it. Not content
with dragging me back to the world, he
would have me marry."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

<p>"I, too, would have you marry, my love,"
said Mrs. Woodcot. "And that before long."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would have me marry a nobleman.
You think that rank would make me
happy?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't say that. Splendour, I know,
has few attractions for you. Besides, your position
is already ensured, and your fortune so
large that you require no addition to it. Circumstanced
as you are, the choice of a husband
rests with yourself, and, to ensure your happiness,
you ought to choose one whom you know
to be devoted to you, with whose character and
disposition you are perfectly acquainted, and
whose tastes are not dissimilar to your own."</p>

<p>"Such a one as Oswald," remarked May, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Exactly," rejoined Mrs. Woodcot. "Of all
your adorers there is none truer to you than he.

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

He submitted to the sentence that you passed
upon him without a murmur&mdash;but he never
ceased to love. And now&mdash;with my permission&mdash;he
ventures to come forward again."</p>

<p>May uttered an exclamation of displeasure.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, if I have done wrong, my love,
in summoning him; but knowing there was
likely to be a question of marriage, I could not
help giving the poor fellow a chance. Ah! he
loves you dearly. May."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a question of marriage,
aunt?" asked May, uneasily.</p>

<p>"You will learn that soon enough," returned
Mrs. Woodcot.</p>

<p>"But I suppose a husband is not to be forced
upon me!"</p>

<p>"You are your own mistress, my love, and
can do as you please. If you think I have presumed

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

too much in regard to Oswald, I will
send him away at once."</p>

<p>"No, don't do that, aunty. He doesn't trouble
me in the least. I fear there is some one else
who cannot be disposed of so easily."</p>

<p>"Pray don't ask me any more questions, my
love. I have told you more than I ought. Thank
you a thousand times for permitting Oswald to
remain."</p>

<p>"No thanks are due, for I cannot give him a
hope. Tell him so, aunty. Ah! here he comes,"
she exclaimed, as the young man was seen advancing
towards them along the terrace.</p>

<p>May received him with unaffected kindness,
and really appeared glad to see him, but after a
little conversation on general matters, she excused
herself and went into the house.</p>

<p>"A very affectionate greeting from my fair
cousin," observed Oswald, as soon as she was

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

gone. "I hope I may draw a favourable conclusion
from it. Have you said anything to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have opened the business."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"You are allowed to remain&mdash;that's something."</p>

<p>"Everything," he cried, exultingly. "With
your help, mother, I'll win her."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sanguine, Oswald. We shall
have to contend with them all. We shall see
what effect your aunt Radcliffe produces with the
Marquis of Hartlepool."</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p class="small">A SECRET DIVULGED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Later</span> on in the day, a long interview took
place between Mrs. Radcliffe and May, and when
the former issued from the room in which she had
been closeted with her daughter, she looked flushed
and angry, and, in answer to her husband's inquiries,
told him to go to the wayward girl, and
see what he could do with her. Mr. Radcliffe at
once obeyed the mandate.</p>

<p>"Your mamma has sent me to you, my love,"
he said, as he entered the room, "to reinforce

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

the arguments she has used in favour of the
splendid offer that has just been made you, but I
wish you at once to understand that I shall leave
you entirely to follow the dictates of your own
heart."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dearest papa. This is only what I
expected from you. Without reference to this
particular proposal&mdash;the importance of which I
feel as much as mamma or yourself&mdash;I wish to
ask you a question: do you think I ought to
marry?"</p>

<p>"I have no hesitation in answering the question
in the affirmative," he replied. "I think you
ought. Your long and utter seclusion from
society has given me, I will now confess, considerable
uneasiness, and I shall rejoice at your
restoration to the world. I shall rejoice still
more to see you wedded to one deserving of
you, and on whom you can bestow your affections.

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

In the choice you may make, consult your
own feelings, and do not be governed by our
wishes. Much may be said in favour of the
present offer, and if rank and splendour weigh
with you, accept the Marquis of Hartlepool. But
I question whether you would not be happier
with one of less exalted position. However,
decide for yourself. You look as if you had
something to say to me," he added, in a kind and
encouraging tone.</p>

<p>May remained silent. The colour mounted to
her cheeks, but she soon became pale again.</p>

<p>"Speak, my dear child&mdash;speak," he said. "You
need have no secrets from me."</p>

<p>"I will make a full confession to you, dearest
papa," she rejoined. "I will let you know the
exact state of my feelings. But I fear you will
be displeased."</p>

<p>"Have no such fear," he rejoined, kindly.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

<p>Taking a small velvet tabouret, she knelt down
upon it beside him, and looked up into his face.</p>

<p>"You look like my child of former days!" he
cried, pressing his lips to her fair brow.</p>

<p>"I would go back to former days," she rejoined.
"You may remember, dearest papa, that
at first I was strangely insensible to Sir Charles's
noble qualities and devotion. I was blinded by
a feeling for another which had taken possession
of me. Fortunately, I was able to crush it. But
of late that feeling has revived, and unless I
can conquer it as I did before, it will overpower
my resolutions, and in spite of myself I shall
love again."</p>

<p>"You are in love already, I perceive," he
observed, smiling. "Well, who has resumed his
mastery over your heart?"</p>

<p>"I will have no concealment from you, dearest
papa. The person whose image will recur to me

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

in spite of all my efforts to banish it, is Hilary
St. Ives&mdash;Colonel Delacombe's adopted son."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed her father, as if a bullet
had pierced his breast, while May, surprised and
alarmed at the extreme agitation he displayed,
regretted having divulged her secret.</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?" cried the agonised
father. "Have you had any communication with
him? Is he aware of the state of your feelings
towards him?"</p>

<p>"How is that possible, dearest papa? He has
been abroad, as you know, for many months, and
during the whole of that time I have neither
heard from him nor written to him. He was
never aware that I took the slightest interest in
him."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" exclaimed Mr. Radcliffe,
greatly relieved. "You must think of him no
more, May."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

<p>"Your prohibition is strangely at variance with
your late kind expressions. You said I ought to
consult my own feelings."</p>

<p>"But I never dreamed of this young man, or
I should have warned you against him. I warn
you now," he cried, solemnly. "There are
reasons why you can never marry him."</p>

<p>"What are they, papa?"</p>

<p>"I can enter into no explanation," he rejoined,
with a sternness to which she was wholly unaccustomed.</p>

<p>"But, dearest papa, tell me your objections to
him. Perhaps they can be removed."</p>

<p>"Never!&mdash;they never can be removed. Banish
every thought of him. If you would not incur
my serious displeasure, May, you will never
mention his name again."</p>

<p>Then pushing her from him, he arose, and
muttered to himself, "What have I done to

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

deserve this torture?&mdash;why should I be placed in
this cruel situation?"</p>

<p>She watched him with alarm, unable to comprehend
the cause of his violent emotion, but
confident in his love she came softly towards
him, and took his hand.</p>

<p>"There is something more in this than the
circumstances warrant," she said, looking entreatingly
at him. "Tell me, I beseech you,
what it is."</p>

<p>"I cannot," he replied, emphatically. "The
subject is too painful to be further discussed.
My sentiments have totally changed since our
converse began. I am now of opinion that you
ought to accept the splendid offer you have
received."</p>

<p>"But, papa, I do not love the marquis, and
do not care for the title."</p>

<p>"Love will come in time, and the title will

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

gratify my pride. That ought to be sufficient
for you. It is my wish that you should become
Marchioness of Hartlepool."</p>

<p>"I have never disobeyed you, dearest papa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then obey me now."</p>

<p>And he quitted the room, leaving her in a
state almost of stupefaction at his inexplicable
conduct.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch05">

<p>V.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. SUTTON'S CONFESSION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> day May could not follow her ordinary
occupations. Her mind was unsettled, and it
seemed as if she had quite lost the serenity which
she had only recently regained.</p>

<p>To one person only could she confide her
griefs, and towards evening she went in search
of her.</p>

<p>Quitting the garden, where she had been walking
by herself for some time, she entered the
park, and, descending the slopes, tracked a path

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

which led her through a grove of chesnuts, and
eventually brought her to a private gate, through
which she passed out into the road.</p>

<p>Descending the hill, she soon reached her
destination&mdash;a secluded little cottage, standing by
the roadside, covered by roses and eglantines.</p>

<p>This humble dwelling was occupied by an old
dame, one of her pensioners, but it was not to
see Widow Perrins that she had come thither.
Her approach was perceived by some one inside,
and as she drew near the door was opened by
Mrs. Sutton, who expressed great pleasure at
seeing her, and ushered her into a little room,
which was furnished very simply, but looked extremely
clean and tidy.</p>

<p>"How very kind of you, dear, to come and
see me," said Mrs. Sutton, offering her a seat.
"I have been expecting you all day. Dame
Perrins is in her own room, and won't disturb us.

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

You can talk freely, for, as you know, she is so
deaf that she can't hear a word we say. I perceive
from your looks that you have something to
tell me. If you want advice, be sure I will give
you the best in my power."</p>

<p>"I am very unhappy, Sutton," replied May&mdash;"very
unhappy indeed. But I know that I shall
obtain from my dear old nurse, who loves me as
fondly as ever, the sympathy which every one
else denies me."</p>

<p>And she then proceeded to relate circumstantially
all that had occurred&mdash;describing her
mother's displeasure at her unwillingness to accept
the Marquis of Hartlepool's offer, and her father's
explosion of rage at her confession of a secret love
for Hilary&mdash;to all of which Mrs. Sutton listened
with profound interest.</p>

<p>"You will now understand why I am so unhappy,
dear Sutton," said May, in conclusion.

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

"I know not what to do. My desire is to live
at Boxgrove quietly&mdash;but they will not let me
rest. Whether I shall have strength to resist the
combination against me, I cannot tell. I fear
not. Papa, upon whose support I counted, deserts
me. As I have told you, he authoritatively
enjoins me to abandon all idea of Hilary. What
can be his motive for the prohibition I cannot
tell, but I am sure he is inflexible."</p>

<p>"I will explain his motive," replied Mrs. Sutton,
after a pause. "There must be no further concealment.
You will abhor me when you learn
what I have done. I am the cause of your
father's antipathy to Hilary. I have poisoned his
mind&mdash;made him believe that the young man is
too nearly allied to you ever to be your husband&mdash;in
a word, that his mother is your mother."</p>

<p>Shocked beyond all expression, May could
scarcely credit what she had heard. For some

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

moments she could not speak, but at last she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Oh, Sutton, if any one but yourself had told
me this, I would not have believed it. What instigated
you to such dreadful wickedness?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy. I always hated your mother."</p>

<p>May looked at her with amazement.</p>

<p>"And you avow this to me, who know that
mamma showed you nothing but kindness."

"Her kindness increased my hatred. My nature
is evil. Having the means of vengeance in my
power, I used them as I have told you. The
charge was false in every way&mdash;doubly false
from me."</p>

<p>"Why from you?" demanded May, appalled
by her language and demeanour.</p>

<p>"Because the young man in question is my own
son," replied Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>"Your son!" exclaimed May, horror-stricken,
and sinking back in the chair.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

<p>"Oh! if you knew the terrible remorse I have
felt for my crime, you would pity and perhaps
forgive me," exclaimed the wretched woman.</p>

<p>"Expect neither pity nor forgiveness from me,"
cried May, shuddering as she regarded her. "The
incalculable misery you have caused would check
any such feelings. But answer me one question
You have declared that Hilary is your son. Were
you married to his father?"</p>

<p>"As Heaven shall judge me&mdash;yes! It was a
secret marriage, and productive of nothing but
misery both to myself and to him I had wedded.
He thought me beneath him, and was ashamed
of me. But he knew not, and knows not to this
hour, that my family is better than his own. I
would willingly draw a veil over this portion of
my unhappy life. But I must refer to it. Not
many months after my marriage my husband left
me. I knew he would never return. I knew

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

I had not his love. I knew he wished to get
rid of me, for he had told me so, and I was
just as anxious to be freed from him. I devised
a plan which would liberate us from our fetters
without scandal. It was to disappear from the
world. My stratagem succeeded. He believed
I was drowned in the Severn, and his belief
remained unshaken till we met again after many
years, and he recognised in Mrs. Sutton, the
housekeeper, the wife he had supposed long since
dead."</p>

<p>Astounded by the revelations made her, May
remained silent for some minutes.</p>

<p>"But you have not spoken of your infant son,"
she said. "How could you abandon him? Had
you no mother's feelings in your breast?"</p>

<p>"The sufferings I have endured may, perhaps,
serve to expiate my unnatural conduct," rejoined
the wretched woman. "I knew the child was

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

cared for by its father; but though I did not
dare to make any direct inquiries from the persons
to whom it had been entrusted, I ascertained that
it was well treated. I did more&mdash;but alas! not
all I might have done. I left my poor child to
strangers, but they were kinder to him than his
unnatural mother."</p>

<p>Here her utterance was broken by sobs, and
she was quite overcome by emotion.</p>

<p>"You say that your family is better than that
of Colonel Delacombe," observed May.</p>

<p>"I have spoken the truth," replied Mrs. Sutton.
"But what does that matter now?"</p>

<p>"It matters much to your son," replied May.</p>

<p>"He shall know all it may be needful for him to
learn," rejoined the inscrutable woman, "but there
are some things I cannot&mdash;will not tell him. I
have forfeited the right to claim him as a
son."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

<p>"How so?" cried May, in fresh perplexity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutton did not heed the question, but continued
almost fiercely,</p>

<p>"Imagine the torments I experience when I
know and feel that I am for ever debarred from
a mother's privileges. The ardent love I bear
my son will never be gratified. When I have
stood beside him the effort to stifle my feelings
has well nigh killed me. It has been said&mdash;said
falsely&mdash;that the voice of nature will always
speak out. In him it was mute. Once, when he
slept, I pressed my lips to his brow. That is the
sole solace my mother's heart has known. I
thought he could read my feelings in my looks&mdash;but
no! no! he was utterly insensible. I would
give the residue of my life for a few words from
him; but I shall never have it. I do not deserve
it. It is retribution&mdash;retribution."</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her eyes, and when
she uncovered her face, it was ghastly white.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

<p>"I shall never know peace on earth," she exclaimed.
"Life has become a burden to me, and
the sooner it is ended the better. I am only in
the way."</p>

<p>Her utter despair excited May's compassion, and
she attempted to offer some consolation, but the
wretched woman refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>Ere long, however, she mastered her emotion,
and spoke more calmly.</p>

<p>"I dare not advise you," she said. "Good
counsel cannot proceed from lips like mine&mdash;but
your life has been so pure and blameless that you
are certain to meet your reward&mdash;just as I have
met mine for my evil deeds. Obey your father&mdash;would
I had obeyed mine!&mdash;obey him, I exhort
you, as you would be happy, for disobedience will
bring down a judgment. Tell him all I have told
you. Hide nothing from him. If he then consents
to your marriage with Hilary, all will be
well. If he forbids it&mdash;yield!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

<p>While they had been thus occupied, evening
had come on, and it was now almost dark.</p>

<p>So engrossed were they that neither of them had
remarked that a listener was outside, who had lost
not a word of their discourse. A man, who looked
like a gipsy, had watched May enter the cottage,
and stealing up to the little lattice window, which,
as we have intimated, was covered by creepers,
and which unluckily was left partially open, had
planted himself so that he could see and hear what
was going on inside.</p>

<p>What he heard interested him deeply, and he
never quitted his post till May, remarking that it
was growing late, signified her intention of returning.</p>

<p>He then crept off, but concealed himself
among some trees on the opposite side of the
road.</p>

<p>Here he remained perdu till May came forth
with Mrs. Sutton, who had insisted on attending

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

her to the hall, and he then cautiously followed
them.</p>

<p>Followed them through the gate Into the park,
and through the chesnut grove, where the shade
of the trees made it sombre.</p>

<p>May had no fears. But fancying she heard
footsteps, she grasped her companion's arm, and
the latter immediately stopped. They listened
for a moment or two, but nothing occurring to
alarm them, they set off again.</p>

<p>Still the man followed.</p>

<p>As they issued from the grove, the old mansion
rose before them in all its grandeur, with a
crescent moon hanging over its summit, tipping
the vanes with silver.</p>

<p>Even at that hour, and imperfectly seen, the
park looked lovely, and as May looked down
the long sweeping glade, she could just descry
the branching antlers of the deer, showing where
they were couched beneath the trees.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

<p>In a very short space of time they had reached
the garden, and Mrs. Sutton's attendance being
no longer required, she prepared to take leave.</p>

<p>During the rapid walk she had scarcely made
an observation, but now she had evidently something
to say, but profound emotion prevented her
from giving utterance to it.</p>

<p>"I must now bid you adieu, Sutton," said May.
"I feel certain papa will desire an interview with
you; and if he does, you will not disappoint him,
will you?"</p>

<p>"If he wishes to see me I will come&mdash;<i>if I can</i>,"
she replied, with strange significance.</p>

<p>"Banish these gloomy thoughts!" cried May.
"Much happiness, I trust, is yet in store for
you."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, in a tone that sounded like
a knell&mdash;"no chance of happiness for me on
earth.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

<p>And she hurried away.</p>

<p>May gazed after her, and could just distinguish
that she waved her hand, before she disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<p>As May hastened towards the house, a scream
was heard, apparently proceeding from the chesnut
grove. She listened intently, but there was no
second cry.</p>

<p>Just then a gardener came up. He had heard
no scream, but instantly ran off to the chesnut
grove. In less than ten minutes he came back
with the assurance that her alarm was groundless.
He had been as far as the gate, and had
seen no one.</p>

<p>Early next morning, May, who could not free
herself from uneasiness, set out to make inquiries
concerning Mrs. Sutton. The morning was so
exquisite that it might have tempted her forth,
even if she had had no particular object in view.

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

Everything wore a smiling aspect, the charming
old-fashioned garden, with its smooth lawns, its
variegated flower-beds, and its alleys&mdash;the park
with its long glades, its clumps of trees and
thickets. The deer were trooping down the
slopes, the rooks cawing loudly in the trees, and
the groves vocal with melody. The exhilarating
feeling which such a morning always inspires did
not fail in its effect on May.</p>

<p>Heedless of the heavy dew upon the sward,
she speeded towards the chesnut grove, but
before reaching it she was cheered by the sight
of Mrs. Sutton, and quickened her pace to meet
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sutton," she exclaimed, "I am so glad
to see you safe and well. After you left me
last night, I heard a scream, and fancied it might
proceed from you."</p>

<p>"Yes. A ruffian stopped me in the grove, and

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

threatened me, but fled when I cried out for help.
I have not yet recovered from the fright he
caused me. The villain had been lurking near
the cottage, and overheard what passed between
us. His motive for stopping me was to extort
money. I defied him, and he threatened me.
But it will not be safe for me to remain longer
here. I was coming in search of you to tell you
this. I thought I should find you in the garden."</p>

<p>"But what have you to fear from this villain,
Sutton? He will not dare to molest you further."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot remain," she replied. "I dare
not. I know not whither I shall go. I have no
fixed plan. But I will write and let you know
where a letter will reach me."</p>

<p>"Come with me to the house now, and await
papa's arrival. He will be here this morning.
You can then give him the necessary explanation."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

<p>"No, not now," she rejoined. "It would be
hazardous for me to remain here." And she
added, hastily, "I shrink from a meeting with
your mother, and I could scarcely avoid encountering
her."</p>

<p>At this moment a blithe shout was heard. It
proceeded from Oswald, who had just issued forth
into the park, and descried them. On seeing
him Mrs. Sutton bade the young lady a hurried
farewell, and plunged into the grove.</p>

<p>Luckily Oswald had not recognised Mrs.
Sutton. Besides, he was too eager to take advantage
of the opportunity now offered him to
waste a moment in idle discourse.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! he went over the old ground&mdash;made
the same protestations of undying affection
that he made a year ago, and with pretty nearly
the same result&mdash;the only difference being that
May did not laugh at him as she used to do
formerly, but, on the contrary, looked grave.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

<p>Still he would not be discouraged, but implored
her so earnestly and so humbly to accord him a
few days' grace, and not reject him summarily,
that she assented.</p>

<p>"Give me a week," he cried. "At the end
of that time, if you do not change your mind, I
will retire for ever. But promise not to accept
any one else in the interim."</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask for such a promise,
Oswald," she replied. "Nevertheless, I give it."</p>

<p>Transported with delight, he took her hand,
and would have kissed it, if he had dared.</p>

<p>"You must not presume upon my good nature,
Oswald," she said, coldly, "I do not give you
a hope."</p>

<p>He did not hazard a reply, lest he should mar
his prospects, which he thought were brightening.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE MARQUIS OF HARTLEPOOL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Radcliffe's</span> letter (as perhaps was intended
by the writer) was forwarded by Lady
Richborough to the Marquis of Hartlepool, accompanied
by a little billet from her ladyship,
recommending him to go down to Hazlemere,
and carry on his suit in person, and assuring
him that the Radcliffes would be delighted to
see him.</p>

<p>The marquis acted upon the advice, and,
haying previously written to announce his coming,

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

was received by Mr. Radcliffe with all the consideration
due to his high rank. Of course, preparations
had been made for him, and a few of
the best people in the neighbourhood were invited
to meet him at dinner.</p>

<p>From her previous acquaintance with the marquis's
character, Mrs. Radcliffe had been rather
alarmed at the idea of having him as a guest,
but he soon set her at her ease. All prejudices
against him on the score of coxcombry were
speedily dispelled. No longer haughty and supercilious,
his manner was almost captivating; while
his personal appearance seemed also improved,
and Mrs. Radcliffe wondered how she could ever
have thought him otherwise than handsome.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe, who had certainly no predilection
for him, was not proof against the charm
of his manner, but confessed to Mr. Thornton
that he was most agreeably surprised.</p>

<p>But the marquis's most signal triumph was

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

over Oswald, who dined that day Hazlemere, and
was forced to admit that his noble rival was
a most agreeable person. It is true that the
marquis paid him particular attention, and flattered
his vanity.</p>

<p>Lady Richborough had arrived just before
dinner, having received a telegraphic message
from Mrs. Radcliffe begging her to come down,
and though she had engagements in town, she
good-naturedly gave them up, and complied.</p>

<p>One person, however, successfully resisted the
marquis's fascinations, and viewed his conduct
with a jaundiced eye. Mrs. Woodcot felt angry
with Oswald for allowing himself to be seduced
by his rival's manner, and prepared to give him
a severe lecture for his folly when they were
alone.</p>

<p>Needless, we think, to state that May was
not present. No persuasions could induce her

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

to join the dinner, but she reluctantly consented
to receive the marquis on the following day at
Boxgrove.</p>

<p>After dinner the marquis had a long t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
with the lady of the house, and told her how
passionately enamoured he was of her daughter.
Mrs. Radcliffe gave him every encouragement in
her power, and almost ventured to answer for
May. With the prestige of his high rank, his
charming manner, and genuine passion, she
thought he must prove irresistible.</p>

<p>Grandpapa was in a state of perfect beatitude
as he drove back that night to Boxgrove, and
could not find terms sufficiently strong to express
his admiration of the marquis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodcot ventured to differ with him, but
was put down instantly, and Oswald was bidden
to hold his tongue, unless he could say something
to the purpose.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

<p>"I won't hear a word against him," cried Mr.
Thornton. "He is the best specimen of a
nobleman I ever met with. May is the luckiest
girl alive to have secured him, and I shall be
the proudest old fellow in England when I am
grandfather&mdash;as I soon shall be&mdash;to the Marchioness
of Hartlepool&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>It will be seen that our convivial old friend
had not neglected the claret.</p>

<p>So far everything seemed propitious to the
marquis. The affair was in excellent train, and
promised a most satisfactory result. Never had
Mrs. Radcliffe been in better spirits than at
breakfast on the following morning. She had
almost reached the height of her ambition, and
could scarcely contain her delight. Her great
desire now was that May should be married
without delay.</p>

<p>About noon, an open carriage conveyed the

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

whole party to Boxgrove. The day was singularly
auspicious, and the park could not possibly
have been seen to greater advantage.</p>

<p>The marquis was enraptured by its beauty. He
had two large parks of his own, but neither of
them could be compared to this magnificent
domain. Lady Richborough, who was with Mrs.
Radcliffe in the barouche, excited his enthusiasm
by pointing out the chief beauties of the place,
and drew his attention to some of the oldest trees.</p>

<p>They were still slowly mounting the steep
hill, when May, who was taking her exercise in
the park, accompanied by Oswald and grandpapa,
rode towards them, and with infinite grace
and courtesy welcomed her visitor.</p>

<p>The marquis was a little disconcerted by this
unexpected meeting, having prepared himself for
a more ceremonious reception, but he did not
allow his disappointment to appear.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

<p>Unluckily the fine speeches he intended to
deliver had to be postponed to a more fitting opportunity,
and he was obliged to confine himself
to commonplace observations. However, he rattled
away in a very lively manner, and if he did not
interest May, he amused her.</p>

<p>The young lady rode by the side of the carriage
as far as the gates, and then left her noble suitor
to the care of grandpapa, and continued her
exercise in the park; nor did she reappear till the
gong had sounded for luncheon. In his efforts to
please her, the marquis was materially aided by
Myrtilla, but though he exerted himself to the
utmost, he felt that he had not made much
progress.</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Radcliffe and Lady Richborough were
convinced that May would not grant him the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
he so ardently desired, and they therefore
agreed to contrive it. But Oswald was on the
alert to defeat their object.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

<p>After luncheon, Myrtilla suggested that they
should visit the gallery, the marquis having expressed
a wish to see the family portraits. Of
course May assented, and they all repaired thither.</p>

<p>Naturally familiar with the histories of her
ancestors and ancestresses, Lady Richborough described
several of the portraits, but seizing an
opportunity when May was engaged in conversation
with the marquis, she made her escape, and
left them together.</p>

<p>The precious moment was not lost. Instantly
changing his discourse, the marquis began to plead
his suit in impassioned terms, but before he had
ended, Oswald joined them, and, regardless of the
annoyance which he evidently caused his noble
rival, remained.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch07">

<p>VII.</p>

<p class="small">AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the little incident just narrated took
place in the portrait-gallery, a stranger had arrived
at the mansion.</p>

<p>A tall, dark-complexioned, good-looking young
man, well-dressed, and of distinguished appearance.
He inquired for Lady Richborough, stating
that he had been to Hazlemere, but not finding
her, had walked on to Boxgrove. He then gave
Mr. Dancer, the butler, a letter, requesting him
to deliver it to her ladyship, and say that the

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

bearer, Mr. Hilary St. Ives, begged the favour
of an interview with her.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer bowed most respectfully, and conducting
him to the library, left him there, and
proceeded on his errand.</p>

<p>Now it chanced, at the moment Mr. Dancer
entered the gallery, that Lady Richborough was
engaged in conversation with the marquis, and not
wishing to disturb her, the butler did not immediately
go forward, and while thus stationed attracted
May's attention. Fancying he wanted to
speak to her, she went towards him, and on
hearing his errand hastened down to the library,
without staying to make any excuses to the marquis
for her sudden disappearance.</p>

<p>She found Hilary standing near the open
French window, looking out upon the smooth
lawn and the lovely parterres. He bowed formally
as he advanced to meet her.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

<p>"I am aware that you expected to see Lady
Richborough, Mr. St. Ives," she said, saluting
him. "I have hurried down before her because I
have something to say to you."</p>

<p>"I feel much flattered," he replied, again
bowing gravely. "I did not suppose that I lived
in your recollection."</p>

<p>"I never forget those I have known and at all
cared for," she rejoined; "and there are circumstances
connected with your brief stay at Hazlemere
which will always make me take an interest
in you. I hope you bring good accounts of
Colonel Delacombe."</p>

<p>"Alas! no, I am sorry to say," he replied,
sadly. "He is detained in Paris by a fresh
attack of the low fever which he caught at
Rome. He is most anxious to return to England,
but his physician will not allow him to
move at present. He has, therefore, despatched

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

me to transact some business for him, and
amongst other things has charged me with a
letter to Lady Richborough, which must plead
my excuse for my present intrusion."</p>

<p>"May I ask if the letter you have brought
relates in any way to Mrs. Sutton? You can
speak freely to me."</p>

<p>"I am not acquainted with its exact contents,
but I know it refers to some important information
which the colonel hopes that her ladyship
may be instrumental in obtaining from Mrs.
Sutton."</p>

<p>"Are you aware that Mrs. Sutton has left
Hazlemere?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But Colonel Delacombe thinks that
Lady Richborough, or your mother, may enable
me to discover her retreat."</p>

<p>"Neither of them can enable you to discover
it," rejoined May.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

<p>"Then my object is frustrated," he cried, with
a look of deep disappointment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you to find her," said
May. "But do not let me raise your hopes too
highly. There are difficulties in the way, as you
will perceive. I must tell you in confidence,
that for some weeks Mrs. Sutton has been living
in absolute retirement in a secluded little cottage
near the park&mdash;with my consent and with my
knowledge. But she intended to leave yesterday.
She had a motive for her sudden
departure, and refused to tell me whither she
was going; but I think she will write to me
soon."</p>

<p>"Possibly she may not yet have left," cried
Hilary, eagerly. "It is important that I should
see her without delay. Will you direct me to
the cottage?"</p>

<p>"Readily. It is situated on the skirts of the

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

park, close to the large chesnut grove on the left,
which you can see from this window, and is
occupied by Widow Perrins. You must tell the
old dame that I have sent you, or you will learn
nothing from her."</p>

<p>"I will return immediately," said Hilary.
"Pray make my excuses to Lady Richborough."</p>

<p>Passing through the open window, he stepped
out upon the lawn, and gained the terrace, when a
loud halloo checked him, and turning he perceived
Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing here, sir?"
vociferated that gentleman. "Stop, and give
an account of yourself."</p>

<p>Though disinclined to obey, Hilary nevertheless
halted.</p>

<p>"Lady Richborough or your daughter will acquaint
you with my business here, sir," he remarked,
haughtily.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

<p>"Ah, indeed! Pray have you seen Miss Radcliffe?"</p>

<p>"I have had that honour, sir," replied the
young man. "I must beg you to excuse me
just now. I am in haste. On my return, I
shall be at your disposal."</p>

<p>"You must not return, sir. I cannot allow
you to see my daughter again. I cannot allow
you to re-enter the house. Am I sufficiently explicit?&mdash;or
must I warn you off the premises?"</p>

<p>"Warn me off the premises!" cried Hilary,
fiercely. "You now effectually prevent my departure.
I do not propose to leave at your
bidding. Till this moment I was under the impression
that Miss Radcliffe was mistress of Boxgrove,
but it seems that you exercise paramount
authority here."</p>

<p>"As Miss Radcliffe's father, I am the best
judge of those whom she ought to receive; I

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

disapprove of you, sir, and therefore peremptorily
forbid your return. With my sanction you
should never have entered the house."</p>

<p>"Mr. Radcliffe," said Hilary, sternly, "I cannot
believe you capable of acting in this extraordinary
manner without some provocation.
Having given you none, I seek in vain for a
motive for your excessive rudeness, but as a gentleman
you owe me an explanation, and shall
render it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have spoken too strongly," replied
the other, moderating his tone. "Let me, then,
say that your presence here is calculated not
merely to cause me annoyance, but great pain."</p>

<p>"I understand it now," thought Hilary. "He
has discovered the terrible secret."</p>

<p>All anger at once disappeared from the young
man's countenance, and gave place to profound
sympathy.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

<p>"You have said enough, Mr. Radcliffe," he
observed. "I will obey you. When you learn
my motive for coming here from Lady Richborough,
you will not blame me. Let me assure
you&mdash;since it may be a satisfaction to you to
know it&mdash;that I did not seek an interview with
your daughter. It was by accident that I saw
her, and the few words that passed between us
referred to Mrs. Sutton, of whom I am in
search."</p>

<p>"You are in search of Mrs. Sutton!" cried
Mr. Radcliffe, quickly. "With what object?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir. I cannot satisfy your curiosity."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from her? Do you know
where she is?"</p>

<p>"I have come here for information respecting
her."</p>

<p>"We know nothing of her. She has left

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

Hazlemere several months ago. I have made
many fruitless attempts to find her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may be more fortunate," said the
young man, raising his hat. "I wish you good
day, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe did not attempt to stop him, for
at the moment May and Lady Richborough issued
forth from the library window.</p>

<p>"What have you done with Mr. St. Ives, sir?"
said her ladyship, as she came up. "He has
brought me a letter which requires an answer."</p>

<p>"He will be back presently," observed May.</p>

<p>"I don't think he will," said Mr. Radcliffe. "I
shall be very much surprised if he makes his
appearance here again."</p>

<p>"What have you said to him, papa?" cried
May, in consternation.</p>

<p>"Quite enough to prevent his return," remarked
Mr. Radcliffe, drily. "I have a decided objection

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

to the young man. Besides, his appearance
at this juncture is excessively inopportune."</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite admit that," observed Myrtilla.
"And perhaps it is as well he is gone. He might
have caused some unpleasantness. You must really
take your daughter to task, Mr. Radcliffe. She
has behaved infamously, and if the marquis were
not the most amiable creature alive, and devotedly
attached to her, he could not fail to have taken
offence."</p>

<p>"What have I done?" said May.</p>

<p>"Everything in your power to defeat our plans.
You almost show the marquis that you are indifferent
to him. You will not grant him a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. You allow that grand brouillon,
Oswald, to interrupt him, just as he is making a
declaration; and when I have set matters straight
you run away from him altogether."</p>

<p>"My excuse is that I wished to speak to Mr.
St. Ives," replied May.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

<p>"Will your ladyship now blame me for dismissing
the young man so unceremoniously?"
cried Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Far from it. I think you acted very properly&mdash;very
judiciously. Really, my love, we have had
rather too much nonsense this morning. It is
time to be a little sensible. Perhaps you may
not have any very strong liking for the Marquis
of Hartlepool&mdash;nor is it absolutely necessary that
you should be in love with him&mdash;but you must
allow that he is very agreeable, and if not positively
handsome, is the next thing to it. He has
a thousand recommendations, which I could
enumerate if I had time, but they may be all
summed up in the fact that he has the power
of making you a marchioness. We all desire the
alliance&mdash;papa, mamma, grandpapa, myself&mdash;we
all urge it&mdash;and if you prove rebellious, we shall
insist&mdash;yes, insist upon compliance with our

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

wishes. Have I said more than I ought, Mr.
Radcliffe?"</p>

<p>"Not a word," he rejoined. "I hoped that a
very different reception would have been given
to the marquis." Then turning to May, he
added authoritatively, "If you refuse him, I will
never forgive you."</p>

<p>Disregarding her entreating looks, he walked
away.</p>

<p>"You must extricate me from this dilemma,
Myrtilla," cried May. "I will not be forced
into a marriage against my inclinations."</p>

<p>"Don't expect the slightest sympathy from
me, my love. I am dead against you. You are
in no dilemma. Your course is perfectly clear;
and everybody, except Oswald and his mother,
will blame you if you do not take it. But here
comes the marquis. Attend to what your papa
has said to you."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

<p>Presently, the Marquis of Hartlepool came
up accompanied by Mrs. Radcliffe and Mr.
Thornton. May was obliged to offer some apologies
for quitting him so abruptly in the portrait-gallery,
and though annoyed by the treatment
he had experienced, he was easily appeased.</p>

<p>Resolved to bring the affair to an immediate
issue. Lady Richborough suggested an extension
of their promenade, and they strolled on in the
direction of the yew-tree alley.</p>

<p>To prevent May's escape Myrtilla took her
arm, and very soon engaged the marquis in a
lively discourse, which enabled him indirectly to
renew his suit. They were left to themselves,
for Mrs. Radcliffe and grandpapa, who comprehended
Myrtilla's tactics, discreetly kept back.</p>

<p>Unquestionably there is something in a dim
yew-tree alley favourable to utterances of love,
but the presence of a third person is not calculated

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

to heighten their effect. The marquis's
protestations being intercepted by Myrtilla, failed
to move May, and though her silence might
have been construed into assent, her looks betrayed
her indifference. They had nearly reached
the further end of the alley, when a tall dark
figure suddenly appeared before them. Recognising
the unwelcome intruder, Lady Richborough
endeavoured to get rid of him.</p>

<p>"Pray go to the house, Mr. St. Ives," she cried.
"I will join you almost immediately. I want
to talk to you about the colonel's letter."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship must excuse me," he said
"After what has passed between Mr. Radcliffe
and myself, I cannot re-enter the house."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?" inquired May, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "I merely returned to let
you know that my search has been unsuccessful."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

<p>"I am so sorry I cannot aid you further," she
rejoined. "But you must not go till I have had
some explanation with papa."</p>

<p>"You are very kind. I cannot remain longer."</p>

<p>And he turned to depart, but was arrested by
the Marquis of Hartlepool.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop, my dear fellow," cried the latter.
"You shall not go without shaking hands with
me. Not expecting to see you here, I did not
recognise you at first. How are you, and how is
my worthy friend, the colonel?"</p>

<p>"Do you know Mr. St. Ives?" exclaimed May,
surprised.</p>

<p>"Know him! I ought to do. He is my preserver."</p>

<p>"Your preserver! What do you mean, marquis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I repeat, my preserver. He saved my
life last winter at Rome. I will tell you the
story in two words."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

<p>"Not now, I beg," said Hilary.</p>

<p>"Yes, now," cried Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"Thus it happened. One moonlight night,
during a visit to the Coliseum, I was set upon
by brigands, who had concealed themselves in
the passages. My dastardly valet-de-place abandoned
me, and I should certainly have been assassinated
but for the gallant assistance rendered me
by Mr. St. Ives. There were three of them&mdash;three
athletic ruffians&mdash;and he had only a stout
stick against their stilettoes. But he beat them
off till the arrival of the sentinel."</p>

<p>"You greatly overrate the service, my dear
marquis," said Hilary.</p>

<p>"Impossible to overrate it," replied the other.
"You have laid me under an eternal obligation.
But you have not answered my inquiries about
the colonel. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Still in Paris. I shall have good news for

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

him when I go back. It will delight him to hear
of the alliance you are about to form. Accept
my congratulations."</p>

<p>"Would I were in a position to accept them,"
replied the marquis, glancing at May.</p>

<p>"I fear I have been indiscreet," observed
Hilary to Lady Richborough.</p>

<p>"A little so, perhaps," she rejoined. "Your
appearance was rather mal &agrave; propos. But the
affair may be considered settled."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Hilary. "Adieu,
my dear marquis. I need not wish you success,
for I know your cause is won."</p>

<p>And bowing around, he departed.</p>

<p>VIII.</p>

<p class="small">HOW HILARY FOUND THE PERSON HE SOUGHT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary</span> did not leave the neighbourhood of
Boxgrove. After a little debate with himself, he
returned to the cottage, and asked the old dame
whether she could accommodate him for the
night. At first she hesitated, but at length said
he might have the room which had been occupied
by her late lodger, and took him to it. It
was very simply furnished, but scrupulously clean.
In one corner there was a chest, which immediately

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

caught his eye, and he felt sure it belonged
to Mrs. Sutton. On questioning the
good dame as to the state of her larder, he
found that it would be necessary to seek a meal
elsewhere. Luckily, this was easy of accomplishment.
Within half an hour's walk, there was a
well-known inn, much resorted to by visitors
from town on account of its picturesque situation,
and at this comfortable hotel he knew from
former experience he could get a good dinner.
Accordingly, he set out thither.</p>

<p>Having dined very satisfactorily, he came
forth, and was standing at the door of the inn,
conversing with the landlord, when a well-appointed
barouche came in sight. It was Mrs.
Radcliffe's carriage, and with her were Lady
Richborough and the Marquis of Hartlepool.</p>

<p>No sooner did the marquis descry Hilary than
he stopped the carriage, and beckoning to him,

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

said, in a low voice, as the young man came
up,</p>

<p>"You may now really congratulate me. The
thing positively is settled."</p>

<p>We are not sure that the announcement did
not cause a sharp pang in the breast of the hearer,
but he forced a smile, and declared he was delighted.</p>

<p>"I owe everything to Lady Richborough,"
pursued the marquis. "She has won me my
bride."</p>

<p>"Expedited matters a little, that is all, my
dear marquis," observed Myrtilla. "The wooing
might have been more tedious without me."</p>

<p>"And might not have ended as it has done,"
cried the marquis.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship has a vast deal more influence
with May than I have, so I would not interfere,"
observed Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

<p>"Well, I am quite willing to take all the credit
you give me," said Myrtilla, smiling. "Don't
you think I have reason to feel proud of my
success, Mr. St. Ives?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," he replied. "But I did not
suppose the marquis required any advocacy."</p>

<p>"You are very much mistaken, my dear
fellow," cried the other. "I almost began to
despair, when Lady Richborough put in a word,
and all difficulties vanished as if by magic."</p>

<p>"Her ladyship must be an enchantress&mdash;I have
always thought so," remarked Hilary, gallantly.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry we can't take you on with us
to Hazlemere," remarked Mrs. Radcliffe. "Nothing
would have given me greater pleasure than
to see you there, had circumstances permitted."</p>

<p>"Don't say another word, I entreat," rejoined
the young man. "I am overjoyed by the intelligence
I have just received, and hope, ere long,

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

to have some good news to communicate to you
in return. Mr. Radcliffe's prejudices against me
will soon, I trust, be removed."</p>

<p>With this he bowed and retired, and the carriage
went on.</p>

<p>In asserting that he was overjoyed, Hilary
had belied his feelings. The intelligence had
greatly disturbed him. He had not recovered
when Mr. Malham drove up in his gig, and,
alighting, greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>"What, are you come to look at us again, Mr.
St. Ives?" said the surgeon. "We have had
many changes since I saw you last, and more
are likely to occur. We have lost your excellent
nurse, Mrs. Sutton."</p>

<p>"So it seems. Can you tell me what has
become of her?" asked Hilary.</p>

<p>"I wish I could. But I have no idea where
she is gone. I never could understand why she
left Hazlemere, but the house has not been like

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

itself since. Mrs. Trapp, the present housekeeper,
is not to be compared to her. Mrs. Sutton, as you
may remember, had quite the air of a lady. It
was her own fault, I'm persuaded, that she didn't
marry well."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard so," remarked the landlord,
who was standing by. "She was certainly a
superior woman."</p>

<p>"Superior? Yes, I believe you. She was
superior to any one in this neighbourhood. I'm
afraid we shall never have her back."</p>

<p>"I'm by no means sure that she ain't back
already," remarked the landlord.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Crowder?" demanded the
surgeon.</p>

<p>"Why, Frank Mowatt, one of the Boxgrove
keepers, who was here just now, told me he saw
her this very morning, soon after daylight, near
the park, and other folks have seen her."</p>

<p>"Not likely, that," cried Mr. Malham, incredulously.

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

"Mr. Radcliffe would have heard
of her return, and so should I, if there were any
truth in the report."</p>

<p>"Well, Mowatt declared he saw her, that's all
I know," remarked Crowder.</p>

<p>"Send him to me," cried the surgeon. "I'll
give him a guinea if he can satisfy me she has
come back."</p>

<p>Nodding to Hilary, he then entered the house
with the landlord.</p>

<p>Having already paid his reckoning, the young
man walked away at a leisurely pace, meditating
upon the information he had thus accidentally
obtained.</p>

<p>The Fox and Hounds, where Hilary had dined,
is situated at the foot of a hill which forms part of
the same range as Boxgrove, being divided from
the latter by a lovely valley, through which runs a
celebrated fishing-stream. The valley abounds in

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

fine timber of various kinds, and on the banks of
the river, and close to an old stone bridge that
crosses it within a bow-shot of the inn, grows a
row of tall Lombardy poplars.</p>

<p>Viewed from this bridge the scene, which comprehended
the woody heights of Boxgrove and the
ancient mansion that crowned them, was perfect.
The noble park and the stately mansion had a
strange fascination for Hilary. While sketching
in the park, he had familiarised himself with the
locality, and stamped its beauties so forcibly on
his memory that they had ever afterwards haunted
him. As he now gazed upon the enchanting
prospect from the little bridge, the temptation to
revisit these fair sylvan scenes was irresistible.</p>

<p>Descending from the bridge to the meadows,
and following the course of the river for a few
hundred yards, he struck into a footpath, which
brought him to the outskirts of the park, and

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

clearing the pales, he was presently in the midst of
the thicket that clothed this side of the hill.</p>

<p>Familiar with the spot, he knew where to seek
to strike towards the path that led to the uplands,
and pushed on without the slightest misgiving.
The thicket had charms of its own that might
have delayed him had he not wished to reach the
brow of the hill before the shades of evening,
now rapidly coming on, should obscure the beauties
of the view. It was an object with him, therefore,
to gain the footpath as expeditiously as possible,
but he failed in his design, for the intricacies of
the wood were more difficult than he imagined,
and when at length he extricated himself it had
become almost dark. Still he went on, and scaled
the hill-side with rapid steps. The uplands were
quickly reached, but the beauties of the view were
shrouded in gloom. The ancient mansion was
distinguishable, but only as a dark mass. He

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

walked on in that direction, but though sorely
tempted did not enter the garden. However, he
remained for a short time in the vicinity of the
house, as if spell-bound.</p>

<p>Lights gleamed from some of the windows.
Was May there, or had she joined the party at
Hazlemere?</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard footsteps, and perceived a
female figure moving quickly along the terrace.
His heart beat violently at the thought that it
might be May. Without considering the consequences
he hurried towards the garden-gate, and
reached it at the very moment that it was opened
by the person he had seen.</p>

<p>The person was Mrs. Sutton.</p>

<p>She knew him, and did not manifest the surprise
that might have been expected at so strange
a meeting.</p>

<p>She would not allow him to enter into any

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

explanation, but bidding him follow her, speeded
towards a clump of trees that crowned a knoll
at some little distance from the garden-gate.
On arriving there, she stopped, and thus addressed
him:</p>

<p>"I know all&mdash;why you are in search of me&mdash;what
passed between you and Miss Radcliffe
this morning, and what subsequently occurred.
I know where you will lodge to-night, and concluding
I should find you at Dame Perrins's
cottage I was going thither to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Why give up your purpose? Let us go there
at once," said Hilary.</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "I have little to say now,
and I would rather say it here, beneath these
trees, where the gloom shrouds my features, than
in the cottage. The time is not yet arrived when
we can talk freely together&mdash;when we can look
each other in the face. You have to learn who
and what I am&mdash;and till you have acquired that

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

knowledge, a meeting like the present, where
the darkness befriends me, is best for both of
us."</p>

<p>"If you have a secret to reveal to me, this is
a fitting opportunity for its disclosure," said
Hilary.</p>

<p>"Not now," she rejoined. "Though I earnestly
desire to tell you all, I shrink from the task.
You must not&mdash;you cannot learn the secret from
my lips. I should die in the effort to reveal it
to you."</p>

<p>"Must I then remain in ignorance of a matter
which is of vital importance to me to learn?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No," she rejoined. "Nothing shall be withheld
from you. I have written down a statement,
which would have been delivered to you
after my death, but which you can now read.
You will find it in the chest which you may

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

have noticed in my little chamber in the cottage.
Here is the key. When you have read
the story of my life, you will know what to
think of me, and as you think of me, can
act. We may meet again, or we may not. Do
not be influenced by any feeling of pity for me.
I do not want pity. I want love&mdash;yes, love! If
you detest me, as you may do after you have
learnt the truth, let us never meet again on
earth. I will shun you, and you must shun me.
But if you will feel that, in spite of all my
errors, you can love me, come here to-morrow
night at this hour."</p>

<p>"I will come," cried Hilary, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Make no rash promise," she rejoined. "You
have not yet read my story. I am staying with
May Radcliffe&mdash;but you must not come to the
house. At nine to-morrow night you will find
me beneath these trees. Farewell!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

<p>And without waiting for any reply, she hurried
back to the garden.</p>

<p>Greatly perplexed and agitated, Hilary made
no attempt to follow her, but after a while took
his way through the chesnut grove to the cottage.</p>

<p>When he was gone, two men, who had been
lurking behind the trees during the interview,
came from their hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Shall we knock him on the head as we did
once afore, and get the key of the chest?" observed
one of them.</p>

<p>"Tut! that would spoil all," cried his companion.
"We don't want the papers. We can
frighten Madam Sutton without 'em. We shall
find her here to-morrow night. Let us go and
reconnoitre the cottage."</p>

<p>And they moved off slowly in the direction
that Hilary had taken.</p>

<p>Dame Perrins was in no very good humour.

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

She had been long expecting her guest, and wondered
he should stay out so long. It was not
more than nine o'clock, but the old dame kept
good hours. Her little tea equipage was on the
table. The kettle was singing on the hob, and
she set about preparing a cup of tea.</p>

<p>All at once she suspended her task, and looking
at him mysteriously, and nodding her head,
remarked:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sutton has been here."</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Hilary. "I have just
parted with her. She has given me the key of
her chest."</p>

<p>"In that case, it be all right," observed the
old dame. "She told me she wanted to see you
to-night, and I thought she might come."</p>

<p>Having made her guest as comfortable as she
could, and finding he had no further occasion
for her services, the old dame locked and bolted

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

the door, bade him good night, and retired to an
inner room.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Hilary spent some little time
in reflection. Though his curiosity was greatly
excited, and though he could gratify it immediately,
he hesitated, because he felt assured, from
the terms in which Mrs. Sutton had spoken, that
some painful revelation was about to be made
to him.</p>

<p>At last he took a candle, and mounted to the
little chamber. How quiet it looked, and the neat
little bed seemed to invite him to rest, but he
had no thoughts of sleep. With a hand trembling
with excitement, he unlocked the chest.</p>

<p>It contained several documents, bundles of old
letters tied together, with other matters, but the
first thing that caught his eye was a packet sealed
with black wax.</p>

<p>Not doubting for a moment that this was intended

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

for him, he took possession of it, and,
descending to the little parlour, sat down and
broke the seals.</p>

<p>The manuscript which then met his gaze was
penned in a firm, bold, almost masculine hand,
and showed no traces of the anxiety under which
the writer must have laboured.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. SUTTON'S HISTORY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this sad story will not be perused by him
for whom it is narrated until the unhappy writer
is no more, she implores his pity and forgiveness.
Willingly would she spare him these painful details,
but he ought to know them, and she cannot
depart in peace without lightening her breast
by a full confession of her crimes.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Would I had died when I was quite young.
How many years of bitter remorse should I have

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

escaped. When I look back to that season of
innocence and happiness, I can scarcely believe
that so fair a child can have become the wretched,
despairing woman who now pens these lines.
Yet even in that child's breast there were seeds
of evil, which, not being crushed, ripened into
poisonous fruit. Excitable, wayward, capricious,
not devoid of generosity, not unforgiving, but
passionate&mdash;such was I as a young girl.</p>

<p>My mother died while I was almost an infant.
She was very beautiful, and rendered my poor
father extremely jealous, and I fear I must have
inherited some of her qualities, for she was passionate
in the extreme, and vindictive as passionate.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe, I resembled her&mdash;at least,
when I was very young&mdash;though she was far
more beautiful than I could ever pretend to be.
But it was this resemblance that made my father

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

so dotingly fond of me&mdash;so blind to my faults.
Uncontrolled as a child, I became unmanageable
as I grew towards womanhood, and my father
perceived the sad consequences of his excessive
indulgence to me when too late.</p>

<p>I was born in Jamaica&mdash;at Kingston. My
mother was a native of the Island, but of English
extraction; my father was of an ancient
family, and brother of a baronet. He was a
West India merchant, but did not prosper. He
was indolent, and not a man of business&mdash;very
hospitable, and very extravagant. He left me
to the care of my nurse, Bonita, an Octaroon,
who was devotedly attached to me, and supplied
the place of a mother.</p>

<p>Nursed in luxury, I had scarcely a desire ungratified.
My father studied every whim, and I
was treated by those around me as if I had
been a little princess. My education was neglected,

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

but I was quick enough, and learnt many
things that I ought not to have done. In short,
I was very badly brought up, as could not fail
to be the case under such circumstances.</p>

<p>In that warm climate young persons arrive early
at maturity, and before I was sixteen, my charms&mdash;such
as they were&mdash;were sufficiently developed
to attract many admirers, and I received several
offers of marriage from sons of rich merchants
and planters, but would listen to none of them. I
could not foresee the future, or I should have
married then.</p>

<p>Though I did not know it at the time, my
father was in difficulties. His large plantations
and his very residence were mortgaged to a
wealthy merchant, named Osborne. A widower,
but without family, and nearly as old as my own
father, Mr. Osborne was violently enamoured of
me, and determined to make me his wife. I detested

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

him, and did not scruple to show my dislike,
but he did not mind that. He gave my father
clearly to understand that my hand was to be the
price of his forbearance towards him. But though
menaced by the seizure of all his property, and
aware that Osborne, if thwarted, was quite capable
of any vindictive measures, my father would not
sacrifice me thus. He had written home, and
had some hopes of obtaining from his brother the
means of relieving himself from the frightful position
in which he was placed. But in the interval
Mr. Osborne became impatient, and declared he
would not brook longer delay. In vain my father
urged that he must first gain my affections. He
treated the suggestion with contempt, and my poor
father, driven to his wit's ends, was obliged to
appeal to me.</p>

<p>Then for the first time I comprehended his
position, and saw my own peril. But my detestation

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

of Mr. Osborne was increased, and I declared
I would rather die than wed him. With tears in
his eyes, my father besought me to have some consideration
for him, but I remained inflexible.
However, in order to gain time, I consented to
permit Mr. Osborne's addresses, and gave him
some slight show of encouragement. This was a
hard task to one of my impetuous nature, but I
fulfilled it with tolerable success, consoling myself
with the thought of the scorn with which I would
requite him anon.</p>

<p>At last the mail, so anxiously expected, arrived,
but it did not bring the hoped-for assistance from
my uncle. He could not, or would not, help my
father&mdash;at least, to the extent required. But he
sent out a young man, who had been a clerk in a
mercantile house, to assist him in winding up his
affairs.</p>

<p>John Bromley, the young clerk, was very shrewd
and intelligent, and, moreover, very handsome. He

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

pleased me better than any one whom I had seen
in Jamaica. On being made acquainted with the
exact state of my father's affairs, which was worse
than he had been led to anticipate, Bromley
evinced great alarm, and at once stated that the
only chance was an arrangement with Mr. Osborne.
My father then explained to him the condition
exacted by his creditor, and that no other arrangement
was possible. I was present at the time,
and the young man glanced at me before making
an observation. Reading my repugnance to the
plan in my looks, he shaped his answer accordingly.</p>

<p>"It is quite clear you are in Mr. Osborne's
power, sir," he said to my father; "but were I in
your place, I would let him do his worst, rather
than yield my daughter to him."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," was the reply, accompanied
by a groan. "I must yield to circumstances."</p>

<p>"Before you take any decisive step, sir," said

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

Bromley, "let me consider the matter, and see
if I cannot discover some remedy."</p>

<p>My father shook his head, but as I appealed to
him, he agreed to wait. As the young man quitted
the room, he said in a low tone to me, "I will save
you, if I can."</p>

<p>In the few days that followed I saw a good
deal of young Bromley, and soon found that he
had fallen desperately in love with me, nor did I
disguise from him that he had excited a corresponding
feeling in my breast. He implored me
in the most passionate terms not to surrender
myself to the hateful man, who would purchase
me as he would a slave, but to resist my father's
commands, and, if he remained obdurate, to fly.
I half promised assent, but had no serious intention
of complying.</p>

<p>Seeing no chance of escape, I consulted Bonita.
After hearing all I had to say, she reflected,

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

and then declared there was but one means of
liberation, but I might not like to have recourse
to it. I eagerly caught at the suggestion. Be it
what it might, I would adopt it. With a look that
frightened me, but did not shake my purpose, she
then said that she would apply for a charm to an
Obeah woman. I knew what that meant, but did
not forbid her.</p>

<p>I have now arrived at a period of my history on
which I cannot look back without horror and the
deepest remorse. I can offer nothing in extenuation
of my guilty conduct, but I am amazed at it.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Bonita, I paid a stealthy visit
to the hut of the terrible woman who had promised
me deliverance, and she told me that her most
potent charms would be ineffectual against my
persecutor. Only in one way could I free myself
from him, and as she said this she held up in her
yellow, skinny hand a small phial, adding that a

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

few drops, mingled with wine, or any other drink,
would do the business. I did not wait to question
her further, but, giving her my purse, which
she thrust into her pouch with a fiendish grin,
hurried away with Bonita. I allowed myself no
time for reflection. My blood seemed on fire,
and fierce thoughts agitated my breast. My visit
to the Obeah woman's hut seemed to have changed
my nature. Had she dealings with evil spirits,
as was asserted, and had one of them taken possession
of me?</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne was at the residencia that night.
He had dined with my father, and I left them
sipping their claret in the verandah, while I paid
my stolen visit to the Obeah woman. Bromley
was with them. My absence had not been noticed,
but he had been aware of it, for he knew my
errand. He regarded me anxiously as I reappeared,
and I knew what his looks meant to

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

convey. Little doubt indeed was left me on the
subject, for Mr. Osborne rose from his seat, and,
with a triumphant look, told me that I should
soon be his bride. He would have embraced
me, but I thrust him back with loathing, and
any lingering hesitation I might have felt was
then removed. He was greatly enraged, and
vented his displeasure on my father. I took
advantage of this moment to whisper a few words
to Bromley, who turned very pale, and, to hide
his trepidation, walked to a little distance in the
court. My father and Mr. Osborne had just
lighted their cigars, when our black servant,
Diego, brought in coffee and liqueurs, leaving me
to serve them, as was my custom, and I went into
the room for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now was my opportunity. Into the cup of
coffee which I designed for Mr. Osborne, unperceived
by any one, save Bromley, who was

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

watching my movements from the court, I poured
a few drops from the phial. I then handed the
cup to Mr. Osborne, but he was still angry with
me, and declined it. He was not destined to
die thus. Fate had elected another victim. My
father bade me give him the coffee. I would
have retreated, but he snatched the cup from me.</p>

<p>Horror of horrors! he had swallowed the
poisonous mixture ere I could prevent him.</p>

<p>I screamed and fainted. Bonita rushed into
the room, and, amidst the utmost confusion, bore
me off to my own chamber. They thought I
had trodden on a snake. When I recovered, I
sought for the phial, but it was gone. Bonita
had removed it, or I would have ended my
anguish at once. No discovery had as yet been
made. Mr. Osborne had departed, stating that
he should come betimes on the morrow with the
marriage contract. My father had retired to

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

rest, but I was resolved to see him, and make a
full confession of my guilt, and, in spite of all
Bonita's attempts to dissuade me, I repaired to
his chamber. He was reclining on his couch,
reading. I flung myself on my knees before
him, and implored his forgiveness. At first he
thought me distracted, but the truth soon forced
itself upon him. Overcome for the moment, he
fell back on the bed, and I was rushing out for
assistance, but he detained me.</p>

<p>"I know the effect of this poison," he said,
with a composure that astonished me. "There is
no remedy; but the effect will not be immediate,
and will give time to make arrangements for your
safety, for on my death, which is inevitable,
suspicions are certain to attach to you."</p>

<p>I told him I would not survive him, but he
stopped me.</p>

<p>"Do not add another crime to that which you

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

have unintentionally committed," he said. "My
sole consolation will be that you will escape. I
have prayed for death, but I did not wish it to
come in this way. A packet sails for England
to-morrow. You must sail by it."</p>

<p>"And leave you? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"You must go," he said, solemnly and sternly.
"I must be obeyed now. Your presence would
double the pangs of death. Seek not to move
me with entreaties. I am inflexible. Bromley
will take charge of you. I intended to send him
back by this packet, though with very different
tidings. Bonita shall also go with you. Make
your preparations to-night. You must be off
before Mr. Osborne can learn anything of the
plan."</p>

<p>Again I besought him to allow me to stay.
Again he sternly refused.</p>

<p>"As you hope for my forgiveness you will
obey me," he said. "You have the night before

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

you. Employ it, so that you can go on board at
daybreak. I shall not feel easy till you are gone.
Then I can die in peace."</p>

<p>I wept&mdash;I prayed&mdash;I clung to him&mdash;I bedewed
his hands with my tears&mdash;but I could not move
him.</p>

<p>All was done as he enjoined. How he passed
the night after I quitted him, I know not, but
when I tapped at his door, an hour before daybreak,
to tell him all was ready, he was fully
attired. At that trying moment, when I felt
ready to sink from the weight of anguish, he
was perfectly composed. His countenance was
serene in expression, though deathly pale, for he
had already begun to feel the effects of the
poisonous draught. But he bore himself so firmly
and manfully, that I felt ashamed of my own
weakness, and strove to imitate him, though I
thought my heart would burst with the effort.
Never had I loved him so dearly as then. To

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

say that I would have willingly died for him is
simply to repeat the supplication I had addressed
a hundred times that night to Heaven. His
firmness never deserted him till the parting
moment came. He had pardoned me&mdash;had
blessed me&mdash;had bade me an eternal farewell,
and I was about to leave the room, when I saw
him reel and fall back on the couch. I rushed
towards him, but he motioned me away.</p>

<p>"Go! go!" he exclaimed. "It is nothing. It
will pass. Farewell for ever!"</p>

<p>Many months afterwards, when I had reached
England, I learnt that he was found lifeless by
his bedside.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I must state that Colonel
Delacombe is even now, as far as I am aware,
wholly unacquainted with the portion of my history
which I have just related.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

<p>I suffered much during my passage to England,
but more in mind than body, and never
ceased to reproach myself with the crime I had
committed. But for Bonita's watchful care I believe
I should have died. Bromley, also, strove
to mitigate my distress. We were constantly together,
and his passion for me increased. But
mine had declined, for I began to fear him.
He wished to marry me immediately on our
arrival at Southampton, but to this proposition
I would not listen, and he became angry and
suspicious, declared that I was trifling with him,
and hinted that I was in his power, and must
comply. This menace changed any lingering
feeling of regard into positive aversion. But I
avoided a quarrel, and resolved to get rid of him
when we landed.</p>

<p>How I escaped from him at Southampton I
need not relate, but I got to London with Bonita.

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

Then I was safe. I had previously resolved not
to make myself known to my uncle, and if he
heard of my arrival in England, Bromley could
not tell him where to find me. But I had no
apprehensions on this score, and though Bromley
made diligent search for me, it was not till long
afterwards that he was successful.</p>

<p>For some months I lived in obscure lodgings
in Kensington. Bonita passed as my mother.</p>

<p>Tired of this life, which appeared wretched
indeed after the luxurious existence I had led in
Jamaica, I should have presented myself to my
uncle, had I dared to do so. But I thought the
haughty baronet would cast me off, and Bonita
was of the same opinion. However, I emerged
from my seclusion, and one day when walking
in the Park, accompanied by Bonita, I attracted
the attention of a very handsome young officer.
He made some excuse for addressing me, and

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

though I received his advances very coldly he
would not be dismissed. Having ascertained
where I lived, he contrived to meet me again.</p>

<p>Other meetings followed, and Seymour Delacombe&mdash;for
he it was&mdash;became desperately enamoured
of me&mdash;so desperately, that he proposed
marriage, though he supposed my condition far
inferior to his own. Subsequently, when the
violence of his passion had abated, he reproached
me with having duped him, but it is needless to
say the accusation was false.</p>

<p>When Bonita, whom he believed to be my
mother, told him in a decided tone that our
intimacy must cease, he became half frantic
vowed that his intentions were honourable, and
that he meant to wed me.</p>

<p>He kept his word&mdash;though not without hesitation
and delay&mdash;and we were privately married.</p>

<p>Alas! the union was fraught with misery.

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

No sooner was the step taken than he repented
it. I had left London by his desire, and resided
at a little cottage in the neighbourhood of
Bath. Bonita was always with me. Ashamed of
me, irritated with himself for having made&mdash;as
he deemed&mdash;such a dreadful m&eacute;salliance, my husband
visited his anger on me.</p>

<p>I bore his reproaches at first with patience,
but my pride soon took fire, and painful scenes
occurred between us. When he taunted me with
my lowly origin, I could have retorted that my
family was better than his own, but I forbore, as
it would necessitate other explanations, and I
would not allow Bonita to reply.</p>

<p>Our quarrels grew more frequent&mdash;more fierce.
After the first few months he rarely came near
me. My life was now a burthen. But I had
a hope of brighter days. I expected to become
a mother.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

<p>It was about this time, when I was driven into
a state bordering upon frenzy, that my evil
genius again appeared before me. By dint of
constant inquiries Bromley had traced me out.
He had learnt that I was married, and was
aware of my present unhappiness. He came
under the pretence of offering me advice and
assistance, and I was foolish enough to give
him welcome. Bonita warned me of my danger,
but I would not listen to her counsel.</p>

<p>Bromley took up his abode at Bath, in order
to be near me, and spent almost every evening
at the cottage. Utterly neglected by my husband,
and having no other society, he helped me
to pass the weary hours, but I did not foresee&mdash;as
I ought to have done&mdash;how my conduct
would be misconstrued.</p>

<p>Mischief-makers reported what was going on
to Seymour.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

<p>One evening he arrived unexpectedly and found
Bromley with me. Thrusting him indignantly
from the house, he turned his fury upon me;
heaping upon me every opprobrious epithet that
his rage dictated. He charged me with having
dishonoured him with a man who had been my
paramour before marriage.</p>

<p>Stung beyond endurance by his galling words,
and no longer mistress of myself, I snatched up
a knife, and should have plunged it to his heart,
but, thank Heaven! I was spared that crime.
Bonita flung herself between us, and tried to
obtain a hearing, but in vain. He was deaf to
her entreaties.</p>

<p>After such a scene reconciliation was impossible;
and I was not surprised to receive a letter
from my husband, informing me that he was going
to Ireland with his regiment, and would see me
no more. At the same time he enclosed a sum

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

of money, stating that the like amount would be
paid me quarterly.</p>

<p>I wrote to tell him that he had wronged me by
his suspicions, but he did not deign to answer my
letter. Perhaps he had heard that I had been
indiscreet enough to continue my intimacy with
Bromley.</p>

<p>I will pass over several wretched months. I
would fain blot them from my memory. My
child was born, and I gave him my father's name
of Alberic. I wrote to Seymour imploring forgiveness
for his son's sake.</p>

<p>My letter, like the one I had formerly written,
remained unanswered, but he sent a confidential
agent to me&mdash;a certain Mr. Courtenay. This
person's manner was kindly, and he displayed
much feeling. He told me his instructions were
to remove the child, and that if I refused to deliver
it up to him no further allowance would be made

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

me. He gave me a solemn assurance that the
child would be well cared for, but added that I
could not be allowed to see it. I rejected the proposition.
But alas! I was weak and wicked
enough to yield to Bromley's persuasions, and
suffered my little Alberic to be taken from me.</p>

<p>The punishment of my heartless and unnatural
conduct was not long delayed. Bonita was absent
at the time, but when she returned she bitterly
reproached me. From that moment she conceived
a violent antipathy to Bromley, and sought to
drive him from the house.</p>

<P>Such an existence, as I then led, embittered
as it was by Bonita's ceaseless reproaches, was
unsupportable. Bromley, who thought his life in
danger, urged me to fly with him, and the fatal
influence he had now acquired over me, compelled
me to assent.</P>

<p>Step by step I went downward.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

<p>Before my departure I wrote a few hurried
lines to Bonita, bidding her farewell, and enclosing
her a sum of money.</p>

<p>No fixed plans. No precise destination. Our
journey soon came to an end.</p>

<p>We were crossing the Severn in the ferry-boat
from the Old Passage to Chepstow. A gale was
blowing at the time. The boat was upset, and
all within her perished except myself. I escaped
by miracle, but none knew that I had escaped.</p>

<p>My marvellous preservation from a watery
grave suggested a plan to me, and I resolved to
act upon it. Lost to the world&mdash;believed to be
drowned, I would begin life anew, under a new
name.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might have returned to poor Bonita.
But my letter had killed her.</p>

<p>When she found that I had abandoned her, she
had done with life. She had brought the phial of

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

poison with her from Jamaica, and the moment
was come to have recourse to it.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the part I had resolved to enact, I ran no
risk of detection. Few knew me in England,
and the few who did were unacquainted with my
real history. My uncle had never seen me. I
had no fear of my husband. He would not doubt
that I had perished, when he read the account of
the disaster in the Severn. To one of my temperament
there was a strange satisfaction in having
severed all ties. Freed from Bromley&mdash;divorced
as if by death from a husband who hated me, I
rejoiced at my deliverance. But, on the other
hand, I had lost the truest and best friend I had
on earth. I had also lost my child.</p>

<p>For good or ill, the step was taken. I could
not, and would not, retreat.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

<p>I took the name of Sutton, and described myself
as a widow.</p>

<p>How my pride revolted against the humble
situation I was compelled in the first instance
to accept. I, who had had a dozen servants to
wait upon me, whose slightest look was obeyed&mdash;I,
the niece of one of the proudest men in England&mdash;to
become nurse to the children of a woman
whom I felt to be my inferior in every respect! I
could scarcely submit to the degradation. Yet
I discharged my duties so well, that I kept the
situation for nearly three years, and pleased my
mistress so much, that she recommended me to
Mrs. Radcliffe of Hazlemere, into whose service I
next entered.</p>

<p>I was then two-and-twenty, but I looked five
years older. Such beauty as I once possessed had
fled. My manner likewise was changed. All my
natural gaiety had forsaken me. From the first

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

my new mistress took a great fancy to me, and
was curious to learn my history. I told her I
was a widow, and that my married life had been
unhappy, but I avoided entering into details, and
she was considerate enough not to press me
further.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was in delicate health, threatened
with consumption, and I nursed her with so much
care, that I may venture to affirm that I saved
her life. I had now become indispensable to her,
was promoted to the post of housekeeper, and the
entire management of the establishment devolved
upon me. Weak, vain, indolent as she was, it
was not difficult to gain an ascendancy over Mrs.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>My authority in the house became almost
absolute, for Mr. Radcliffe, the best-hearted and
kindest of men, but also one of the easiest, never
interfered with me.</p>

<p>Having acted as nurse to May, I had won the

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

affections of that charming child, and her attachment
to me helped in some measure to fill up the
terrible void in my heart.</p>

<p>Thus my position was completely assured, and
I might have been happy, if I could but have
obliterated the past. But the undying worm
gnawed incessantly at my heart. Though hidden
from the world, I could not fly from myself.
My rest was broken by dreadful dreams. I saw
my father with a stern reproachful look&mdash;Bonita&mdash;Bromley&mdash;but
strange to say! for a time I
thought not of Seymour or of my little Alberic.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Radcliffe's weak and frivolous
character always inspired me with contempt, I
entertained a certain regard for her, till one day
she confidentially informed me that she nourished
a secret affection for one who ought to have been
her husband, and she showed me some of his
letters.</p>

<p>Judge my surprise&mdash;judge my consternation&mdash;when

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

I found these letters were from Seymour
Delacombe. A strange feeling of jealousy was
aroused. Though I knew that when Seymour
made love to Esther Thornton, he deemed himself
released by death from his marriage ties, my
jealousy of her, my anger against him, were not
lessened by that consideration.</p>

<p>And these feelings were kept alive&mdash;nay,
increased&mdash;because, having enlisted my sympathy,
as she deemed, Mrs. Radcliffe constantly talked
to me of her old lover. He had given her his
miniature, which she now produced, and hung it
above the chimney-piece in her boudoir. There
it was constantly before me.</p>

<p>I did not alter my demeanour towards her&mdash;I
contrived to maintain a semblance of respect&mdash;but
I was often on the point of betraying myself
by an explosion of jealous rage, and I resolved
to have revenge for the torture she unconsciously
inflicted upon me.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

<p>It would not be true to say that the feelings
that I once entertained for Seymour were revived
by this constant reference to him, but it brought
him to my mind, and awakened my maternal
affections, which had so long lain dormant. I
could not rest till I had ascertained what had
become of my little Alberic. From inquiries,
which I caused to be made, I learnt that he was
with Mr. Courtenay at Exeter, and satisfied that
he was well cared for I was perforce content.</p>

<p>Time went on, and for many years nothing
occurred to disturb my fancied security.</p>

<p>All apprehensions of detection had long since
ceased, when one day I received a letter that
filled me with alarm. It was from an elder
brother of Bromley, whom I had never seen, but
whom I had heard described as unprincipled and
unscrupulous. Daniel Bromley knew my unhappy
story, for John had been imprudent enough to
reveal it to him.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

<p>At the time of the disastrous accident on the
Severn, Daniel Bromley had just sailed for America,
and I think it was John's intention to join
him there. Hearing of his brother's death,
Daniel went on to San Francisco, and lost all
the money he gained in gambling and low
dissipation.</p>

<p>After a prolonged absence, and many disreputable
adventures, he returned to this country
in a wretched plight.</p>

<p>From the newspaper report of the accident he
had been led to believe that I had perished at the
same time as his brother, but on making inquiries
on the spot he discovered that the body had never
been found, and his suspicions being aroused he
made further investigations that eventually led to
my discovery.</p>

<p>No sooner did the villain satisfy himself on
this point, than he wrote the letter I have mentioned,

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

and threatened to reveal all the details of
my early life, with which he had become acquainted
owing to John's indiscretion, my unhappy
marriage, and every subsequent incident of my
career, unless he was paid handsomely for his
silence.</p>

<p>I had no alternative but compliance, and his extortionate
demands being incessant, I could no
longer supply them.</p>

<p>Rendered desperate I defied him, and he then
informed me that he should go to Mr. Courtenay,
and deposit with him a sealed packet containing
certain documents, to be despatched to India for
Colonel Delacombe, if not reclaimed within three
months. I disbelieved this menace, but it proved
to be correct, for the packet eventually fell into
my own hands.</p>

<p>It contained fearful evidences against me. I
found within it all the letters I had written to the

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

villain himself, together with a statement which he
had drawn up, charging me with parricide. He
endeavoured to substantiate the horrible accusation
by letters from his brother John, and extracts
from old Jamaica newspapers, in which mention
was made of the suspicious circumstances under
which my father died, as well as of my sudden disappearance.</p>

<p>The false villain likewise accused me of poisoning
Bonita.</p>

<p>Death at last liberated me from the relentless
extortioner, and I was allowed some years of comparative
tranquillity. With such a heavy load of
guilt on my soul, I could not have a tranquil mind,
but I was no longer in constant dread of detection
and disgrace.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Let me now turn to May Radcliffe.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

<p>Sweeter creature never breathed. Loving her
as I did with infinitely more affection than her
own mother, I became jealous of her as she
threatened to deprive me of my power. I despised
myself for the unworthy feeling, but I indulged
it nevertheless. A perpetual conflict was going
on in my breast between love for the dear girl,
and dread of the sway she was sure to gain over
her father, and which might be exercised to my
disadvantage.</p>

<p>My secret aim was to get her early married,
and I therefore encouraged an attachment that
appeared to be springing up between her and
her cousin Oswald. But I was foiled, for though
Oswald was passionately enamoured of her, she
was quite indifferent to him.</p>

<p>I was deliberately pursuing this plan, when an
event occurred that turned my thoughts into an
entirely different channel.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

<p>One night a young man, who had been attacked
by robbers, was brought to Hazlemere.
He was almost insensible from the injuries he
had received, and was committed to my care by
Mr. Radcliffe. While I was watching over him
that night, he became light-headed, and amid his
ravings frequently repeated the name of Courtenay.
Already I had been struck by his remarkable
resemblance to Seymour Delacombe,
and the mention of this name confirmed my suspicions.
A mark on the young man's shoulder
convinced me that he was my son.</p>

<p>Yes, he was indeed my son&mdash;my Alberic&mdash;whom
I had not beheld since he was an infant.</p>

<p>Oh! with what rapture I gazed upon his features.
The flood-gates of my heart were burst
open, and the long, long repressed tide rushed
in.</p>

<p>My transports of delight were soon succeeded
by emotions of terror. I had found my son&mdash;my

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

dearest treasure on earth&mdash;but I should lose him
again as soon as found. I dared not tell him
I was his mother. He would spurn me from him
if he knew all. Oh! the agony of that thought.
A thousand extravagant notions passed through
my brain. Nothing I would not attempt to keep
my Alberic near me. Mrs. Radcliffe might be
induced to aid my plan. She still loved Seymour,
and would befriend Seymour's son. But this
was the mere beginning of my wild scheme of
which the consummation was to be Alberic's marriage
with May. This scheme presented itself so
vividly to my imagination, and seemed so feasible,
that I resolved to act upon it. Nor was it so
mad as it would appear. Mrs. Radcliffe was a
mere puppet in my hands. I could move her
as I pleased. May's heart was disengaged, and
I thought her susceptibilities could be excited in
favour of the handsome youth.</p>

<p>Success in the first instance attended my design.

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

Mrs. Radcliffe, as I anticipated, took the
liveliest interest in the young man, when convinced
that he was the son of her old lover, and
a strong and lasting impression was produced on
May by Alberic's good looks and romantic character.</p>

<p>But all my combinations were destroyed by
the unexpected return of him I most dreaded on
earth. Fate, that had brought Alberic to Hazlemere,
brought his father there likewise. Flight
alone seemed left me, but I would not fly. The
conflict was unequal, but I did not shrink from
it. I knew that Colonel Delacombe feared me
more than I feared him.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="b3ch10">

<p>X.</p>

<p class="small">THE PORTRAIT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night, about eleven o'clock, May was
in her dressing-room. Seated beside her was a
woman, more than double her own age, whose
pale features bore traces of affliction. All at
once their discourse was interrupted by a tap at
the door. May's companion started up, and made
a quick exit by a side-door communicating with
the adjoining bedchamber.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she disappeared than Lady Richborough

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

entered by the other door, bearing a
taper.</p>

<p>May expressed great surprise at beholding her.</p>

<p>"I thought you meant to pass the night at
Hazlemere," she observed.</p>

<p>"I have come back purposely to have a talk
with you, dear," replied the other, putting down
the candle, and seating herself. "I hope you
don't feel very sleepy, for I have a great deal to
say."</p>

<p>"I don't feel at all sleepy," replied May. "I
almost fancy you have come to tell me that the
marquis has thought better of it, and desires to be
released from his engagement."</p>

<p>"No such thing. You have made him the happiest
of men, and depend upon it, he will hold
you to your promise. You will see him here to-morrow.
However, it is not of the marquis that I
desire to speak, but of Colonel Delacombe. I am

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

ashamed to say that I read his letter very hurriedly
this morning, and the most important part
of it escaped me. What he mentions is so curious
that I could not rest till I had imparted it to you,
so I returned to-night with Mrs. Woodcot."</p>

<p>"You excite my curiosity very much," cried
May. "What can the colonel have told you?"</p>

<p>"Have a moment's patience. I must first
make you acquainted with a strange tragical event
connected with my own family, or you will not
understand the motive of the colonel's inquiries.
My father, Sir Umfraville Ilminster, had a
younger brother, who became a West India merchant,
and settled in Jamaica. My uncle Alberic
married a Jamaica lady, by whom he had one
child&mdash;a daughter&mdash;named Barbara. My aunt
died about two or three years after her marriage.
I never saw my uncle, but I believe he was very
amiable, though unfitted for business. There was

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

not a good understanding between him and my
father, and they had ceased to correspond for some
years, when Sir Umfraville received a very urgent
letter from his brother, who it appeared had
got into difficulties. Without immediate assistance,
my uncle declared he should be ruined, and
his daughter sacrificed to a man she detested. My
father, I am sorry to say, was insensible to this
appeal, and contented himself with sending out a
clerk to Jamaica to assist in winding up his
brother's affairs.</p>

<p>"The events I am relating occurred about
four-and-twenty years ago. My cousin, Barbara
Ilminster, was then very young, but to judge from
her portrait, which was sent to my father, she
must have been extremely beautiful. My uncle's
chief creditor, Mr. Osborne, a planter, demanded
her hand, and as he could not be refused&mdash;though
Barbara hated him&mdash;the marriage was arranged.

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

But just as it was about to take place, my uncle
died suddenly. Whether he sought deliverance
from his troubles by suicide, or was poisoned, has
never been ascertained.</p>

<p>"A terrible accusation was brought against my
cousin Barbara. It was hinted that she administered
the poison. But I do not believe the
monstrous tale. If she had poisoned Mr. Osborne,
who would have forced her to become his bride,
I could understand it&mdash;but her father, who doted
upon her&mdash;no! I cannot credit the accusation.</p>

<p>"Some colour, however, was given to the charge,
because she left Jamaica, quite suddenly, in a
packet that sailed a few hours before my uncle's
death. But against this it was urged that her
father had enjoined her abrupt departure in order
to get her out of Mr. Osborne's way. Another
circumstance has yet to be mentioned which
raises grave doubts. She was accompanied in the

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

voyage by her nurse, and Mr. Bromley, the young
clerk, whom my father had sent out to Jamaica.
On landing at Southampton, Barbara and her
nurse unaccountably disappeared, and have never
been heard of since."</p>

<p>"A terrible and mysterious story indeed," observed
May, who had listened with great interest
to the narration. "It seems strange that I never
heard it before."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles and I agreed not to mention it
to you. It is one of those family histories that
are best buried in oblivion, as it reflects little
credit on our family. Sir Umfraville never spoke
of his brother or of his niece. Perhaps he reproached
himself with his conduct. Had he sent
the money to Uncle Alberic&mdash;as he might have
done&mdash;as he <i>ought</i> to have done&mdash;this dire calamity&mdash;perhaps
other calamities&mdash;might have
been averted. Heaven only knows!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

<p>"Though circumstances are against her, I do
not believe in Barbara's guilt," observed May.
"What became of her portrait, which you say
your uncle Alberic sent to your father?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen it for years," replied Myrtilla.
"But I think I can find it. Let me consider.
Yes. It was put out of the way by Sir Umfraville,
but I know he concealed it in a secret
drawer of the old cabinet in your room. I dare
say it is there still. Let us see."</p>

<p>"Some other time," said May, with evident uneasiness.
"Not now."</p>

<p>But Myrtilla would not be stayed. "I want to
look at it myself," she cried.</p>

<p>And snatching up the taper, she passed through
the side door into the bedchamber.</p>

<p>As she entered, the person who had preceded
her hastily concealed herself behind the hangings
of the bed.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

<p>May followed, and became reassured as she
glanced around. It was a large, gloomy-looking
chamber, panelled with black oak, partially hung
with faded arras, and furnished with a large
canopied bed, having tall, twisted posts, and tarnished
brocade hangings. Against the wall,
flanked by a couple of high-backed chairs, stood
the antique cabinet. The taper scarcely illuminated
the sombre room.</p>

<p>Giving the light to her companion, Myrtilla
unlocked the cabinet, and touching a spring at the
back, a secret drawer flew open.</p>

<p>As she anticipated, the portrait was there.
The features, depicted by an artist of no mean
skill, were those of a young girl of great beauty&mdash;the
eyes large, dark, and full of fire, the
complexion clear though pale, the hair dark and
silky. There was an undefinable expression in
the countenance.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

<p>Myrtilla gazed at the miniature for a few moments,
and then, handing it to May, said, with a
singular look:</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that face before?"</p>

<p>"Seen it! How should I? Ha!" she exclaimed,
as she regarded it more narrowly. "Is
this your cousin Barbara Ilminster?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, I trace a likeness&mdash;a strong likeness to
Mrs. Sutton."</p>

<p>"Barbara Ilminster and Mrs. Sutton are the
same person," replied Lady Richborough. "That
is what Colonel Delacombe's letter informed me.
That is what I came to tell you."</p>

<p>May's exclamations of astonishment were interrupted
by the sudden appearance of the woman
who was concealed behind the hangings of the
bed.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried this person to Myrtilla, who was

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

petrified with astonishment. "There is no longer
any necessity for concealment. In me you behold
your cousin Barbara&mdash;the wife of Seymour Delacombe,
and the mother of his son Alberic, whom
you have hitherto known as Hilary St. Ives. You
wonder to see me here, in your father's house,
which I could never have entered during his lifetime,"
continued the unhappy woman, still addressing
Lady Richborough; "and never at any
time under my own name. But I am here almost
against my will. I have striven to fly, but a
power, that I could not resist, has detained me.
An asylum has been offered me by May, and I
could not refuse it. I shall not need it long."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, which was broken by
Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"Whatever errors you have committed," she
said, in a sympathising voice, "I am sure you have
atoned for them."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

<p>"Heaven only knows how much I have suffered,"
rejoined Barbara. "But my troubles are
coming to an end. I have had enough time for
repentance&mdash;and I <i>have</i> repented."</p>

<p>"I fear you have still some burden on your soul
which would be relieved by confession," said Myrtilla.
"Open your heart to us, and rest assured
of our sympathy. We will offer you every consolation
in our power."</p>

<p>"I have written down the particulars of my sad
history for my son. He will recount them to you
when I am gone."</p>

<p>"You seem to have a presentiment of some
impending calamity," observed Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"I have," replied Barbara. "In all that has
occurred lately I discern the hand of fate, and the
final event cannot be far off. I have struggled
against my destiny. My desire is to find a retreat
where I can hide my sorrows, and die unknown."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

<p>"You have found a refuge here, and you must
live for your son," said May.</p>

<p>"If he bids me live, I <i>will</i> live," cried the
unhappy woman. "I have appointed to meet him
to-morrow night, but before then he will have
learnt my history, and may not come. In that
case nothing will be left me but despair."</p>

<p>"Do not alarm yourself thus needlessly," said
May. "Be sure he will keep the appointment.
But open your heart to us. You need fear no
severe judgment, and you will feel easier for the
confession."</p>

<p>Barbara yielded. They repaired to the dressing-room,
where each having taken a seat, she commenced
her relation, to which her hearers listened
with the deepest attention. They made no remark,
though now and then they could not help
exchanging a glance.</p>

<p>"I know you must condemn me," said Barbara,
as she brought her story to a close, "and you

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

will condemn me justly, for my conduct is utterly
indefensible, but I may perhaps be shown mercy
hereafter, on account of my sincere contrition,
and the agonies of remorse I have endured.</p>

<p>"You now know what a wretched, guilty thing
I am, but you do <i>not</i> know, and never can know,
what I have suffered, because I cannot, dare not,
attempt to describe to you my sleepless nights,
when my pillow has seemed stuffed with thorns,
and when I have been driven to the verge of
madness by despair. No stings so sharp as those
of a bad conscience. I have not exaggerated my
sufferings to excite your commiseration. I want
words to describe my mental anguish. I shall
find no peace&mdash;no rest&mdash;except in the grave.
Perhaps not there."</p>

<p>"Be comforted," cried May. "After so much
gloom brighter days must be at hand. You have
a son to love."</p>

<p>"If I felt sure of his love, I should wish for

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

life," rejoined Barbara. "But I believe I am
doomed."</p>

<p>"Doomed!" exclaimed both her hearers.</p>

<p>"Yes. I need not remind you that there is a
superstition connected with this house. Poor Sir
Charles Ilminster was warned of his approaching
death. I, too, have had a warning."</p>

<p>The solemnity of her manner made both her
hearers shudder.</p>

<p>"On returning to-night from the meeting with
my son in the park, I passed through the library,
the window of which had been left open, and
hurried up the great staircase without interruption
of any kind.</p>

<p>I had gained the portrait-gallery, and was
hastening along it, when a dark figure seemed
to detach itself from the wall, and bar my way.
Fear nailed me to the spot. A pale phosphoric
glimmer showed me the features of my father,

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

but white as those of a corpse&mdash;and the look he
fixed upon me was inexpressibly mournful. My
tongue clove to my palate, or I would have
spoken. As I still gazed at the apparition in
speechless terror, the ghostly glimmer died away,
and the figure melted into the darkness. How
I gained my room I know not."</p>

<p>Amid the profound silence that ensued, the
pendule on the mantel-piece struck twelve.
Warned by the strokes, Barbara rose to retire,
and Lady Richborough arose at the same time.</p>

<p>"Think over what I have told you, my dear,"
observed Barbara, as she bade good night to
May; "and if you deem it best that I should
not remain longer here, I will depart to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! you must not go!" cried May.
"Decide on nothing till you have seen your son."</p>

<p>"Well, I will trespass on your kindness till
then. Good night!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

<p>She had nearly reached her own room, which
was at the further end of the corridor, when she
heard quick footsteps behind, and seeing Lady
Richborough hastening towards her, she immediately
stopped.</p>

<p>"It is very late, but I must keep you up a little
longer," said Myrtilla. "I have something to say
to you that I could not mention before May."</p>

<p>"Come with me, then," rejoined Barbara. "I
shall not sleep, so it matters not when I seek my
couch."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch11">

<p>XI.</p>

<p class="small">A VISION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chamber assigned to Barbara was not so
large as May's, but similarly furnished.</p>

<p>On their entrance, the room looked so dark,
owing to the black oak panels and the dusky
hangings of the bed, that Barbara lighted a couple
of wax candles on the dressing-table.</p>

<p>Since she had resumed her own name, a noticeable
change had taken place in this remarkable
woman's demeanour. Her manner was prouder
than it had been as Mrs. Sutton. Seeing Lady

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

Richborough gaze at her steadfastly, she drew
herself up haughtily.</p>

<p>"I now recognise my cousin Barbara," said
Myrtilla; "and the wonder is that I did not
recognise you before. I am sorry you have not
had a better welcome to my father's house."</p>

<p>"I have had a better welcome than I deserve,"
rejoined Barbara. "Pray be seated. You want
to talk to me. Put any questions you think
proper. I will answer them truthfully. I have
nothing to conceal. I cannot darken myself in
your estimation."</p>

<p>"I have no questions to ask," rejoined Myrtilla.
"I do not want to talk to you of the past, but of
the future."</p>

<p>"The future!" exclaimed Barbara, gloomily.
"I have nothing to do with the future."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;you must have some plans. Let us
discuss them."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

<p>"Where would be the use? Till I have seen
Alberic I can have no plans."</p>

<p>"I see you do not give me credit for the deep
interest I take in you, Barbara," rejoined Myrtilla.
"You may be sure I am making no idle professions,
when I say that I will serve you, if I can,
and you will let me."</p>

<p>"I thank you much, Myrtilla, but I want
nothing&mdash;except rest. But you may serve my
son."</p>

<p>"It is too late to serve him in the way you
mean. Had I known your secret, I might have
acted otherwise. But May is now engaged to the
Marquis of Hartlepool."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for it, and you will one day
regret that you have been instrumental in bringing
about that union. She will not be happy
with the marquis."</p>

<p>"Why not? He is devoted to her."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

<p>"Maybe; but she cannot give him her heart.
That is already bestowed upon my son. This is
no idle assertion. She told me so herself."</p>

<p>"Had I known this before, the mischief might
have been prevented. But it is now too late.
The match cannot be broken off. The Radcliffes
desire it, and are pledged to it."</p>

<p>"Better their pledges should be broken than
May rendered miserable."</p>

<p>"None can know better than yourself that Mr.
Radcliffe's word is his bond. His promise will
never be retracted."</p>

<p>"A promise made in error is not binding,"
said Barbara. "When Mr. Radcliffe is told of
my marriage with Seymour Delacombe, and learns
that the so-called Hilary St. Ives is our son, his
objections will vanish, and he will rue his promise
to the marquis."</p>

<p>"Still, he will consider himself bound by it, and

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

most assuredly the marquis will never release May
from the engagement."</p>

<p>"Not for my son's sake&mdash;not for mine, but for
May's sake, I implore you to prevent the marriage.
You <i>can</i> prevent it, if you will."</p>

<p>"Impossible. I am too far committed."</p>

<p>"You will not, you mean," cried Barbara,
almost fiercely. "Mark what I say. If ill comes
of the marriage&mdash;as it will&mdash;the sin will lie at your
door."</p>

<p>"You cannot alarm me," rejoined Myrtilla,
with affected indifference, though not without
uneasiness. "But let us dismiss the subject, since
it is utterly impossible I can interfere in the matter,
even if disposed. Is there any chance of effecting
a reconciliation between you and Colonel Delacombe?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Barbara, in a decided tone.</p>

<p>"I think otherwise. For his son's sake he

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

might be content to overlook the past. A material
change has taken place in his sentiments since he
has ascertained that you belong to our family.
Shall I read you what he says in his letter to
me?"</p>

<p>"I do not care to hear it," rejoined Barbara,
coldly. "I have wronged him too deeply ever
to hope for forgiveness. He may forgive me when
I am gone&mdash;but not till then. With Alberic it
is different. He may overlook my errors&mdash;may
love me&mdash;may pour balm into my bruised heart.
Heaven grant it! Heaven grant it! Oh! with
what fear and trembling I look forward to our
meeting. Surely he will not cast me off! Yet
he may!&mdash;he may!" she added, with a look of
inexpressible agony. "What will happen to me
then?"</p>

<p>The spectacle of her anguish was unsupportable,
and Myrtilla prepared to quit the room.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

<p>"Heaven be merciful to you, my unhappy
cousin," she ejaculated, as she went forth.</p>

<p>Barbara did not notice her departure, so intense
was her affliction; but at length, becoming aware
that she was alone, she flung herself on her knees,
and prayed long and fervently.</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted, she disrobed herself, and,
being completely exhausted, soon sank into a
heavy slumber.</p>

<p>A vision, for it seemed more vivid than a
dream, arose before her, and she beheld, bathed
in glorious sunshine, and surrounded by a sea
blue as the deep blue sky, the lovely island where
she first drew breath.</p>

<p>Once more she inhaled an atmosphere laden
with the scents of tropical flowers and trees.
Once more she felt the heat of the flaming sun,
which, fierce as were its beams, seemed to exhilarate
her. Once more she heard the ceaseless

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

screams and chatter of the parrots mingled
with the screams and chatter of the negroes.
Once more her eye ranged over plains studded
with dazzlingly white habitations, long savannahs
fringed with groves of cocoa-trees, and thickets
of cactus, plantations of sugar-cane and coffee.
Once more she gazed on those bays of unequalled
beauty where she had often sailed, and those
blue mountains which she had often longed to
climb. The whole scene was before her, with its
fervid atmosphere, its fierce sunshine, its tropical
beauties, and its delights. She seemed to have
grown young again&mdash;to have become once more
an innocent child. Her sad heart beat with
pleasurable emotions, and she echoed the light
laugh of her nurse Bonita. Yes, her dear devoted
Bonita was alive again, smiling upon her
as of yore, and bringing her cates and fruits.
Suddenly she heard a voice. It was her father's.

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

He was calling for his dear little Barbara. She
flew to meet him. He clasped her in his arms,
and kissed her brow. But his lips seemed icy
cold, and with a start she awoke.</p>

<p>Was she really awake, or still dreaming?
Her father seemed to be bending over the couch,
but the expression of his countenance was
changed, and was now radiant. As she stretched
out her arms the apparition vanished.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch12">

<p>XII.</p>

<p class="small">FATHER AND SON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alberic Delacombe</span>, as we shall henceforth
style him, remained for several hours occupied
with the history of his unhappy mother.</p>

<p>There was more of the confession than we
have deemed it necessary to lay before the reader,
but the latter portion was chiefly explanatory of
the motives that had led her to quit Hazlemere.
An insane desire to disappear from the world,
of which she was utterly weary, had again beset
her, and her precautions had been so well taken

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

that she might perhaps never have been heard of
more, if her strong maternal feelings had not
overpowered her resolution and brought her back
to Boxgrove.</p>

<p>Nothing astonished Alberic Delacombe more
than to learn, as he did from the concluding lines
of his mother's sad story, that she belonged to the
Ilminster family.</p>

<p>Utterly unprepared for this revelation he could
scarcely credit it, and any satisfaction he might
have derived from the discovery was marred by
reflections that could not fail to occur to his mind.</p>

<p>For more than an hour after he had finished the
perusal of the painful story, he remained pondering
upon its details. Greatly shocked, greatly
distressed, he still pitied his mother. Though
unable to absolve her, he could not condemn her.</p>

<p>At last he sought his couch, but excitement
banished slumber. Rising at an early hour from

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

his sleepless pillow, he partook of a slight breakfast,
and telling Dame Perrins that he should
certainly return in the evening, set off for the
nearest railway station, and proceeded to town.
Restless, over-excited, and uneasy, he could not
otherwise employ the interval of time.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Langham Hotel, where he
was staying, a fresh surprise awaited him. His
father had just arrived by the night mail from
Paris, and Alberic immediately repaired to his
room.</p>

<p>The colonel, who was still in bed, being a good
deal fatigued by the journey, told him he had
started contrary to the injunctions of his physician,
but he felt so unaccountably anxious that he
would not delay his departure.</p>

<p>"I was resolved to start, co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te," he
cried; "and I do not think I am the worse for the
journey. But what news do you bring me? Have
you seen Mrs. Sutton?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

<p>The young man replied by placing in the
colonel's hands the packet containing his mother's
history.</p>

<p>"That will tell you all," he said. "When
you have read it, summon me."</p>

<p>And he quitted the room.</p>

<p>More than an hour elapsed, and receiving no
summons, Alberic became uneasy, and went up
to his father's room.</p>

<p>He tapped at the door, but all remained silent
within, and his uneasiness increasing, he entered
the room, and found the colonel fully dressed
and seated near a small writing-table.</p>

<p>Before him lay the manuscript which he had
been reading. His hands were clasped against
his brow, and he was so absorbed that he appeared
quite unconscious of his son's presence, till Alberic
touched him. He then uncovered his face,
which was ghastly pale.</p>

<p>The colonel was greatly changed&mdash;shaken and

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

enfeebled by illness. His splendid frame was
emaciated. His hair was blanched, but his dark
brows and moustaches contrasted forcibly with
the almost cadaverous hue of his countenance,
as did the large cicatrix with which his cheek
was marked.</p>

<p>Alberic gazed at him anxiously, alarmed by
the expression of his countenance, for it was
easy to perceive that a terrible struggle was
passing within.</p>

<p>The colonel made a vain effort to speak, but
his accents were broken and unintelligible, and,
rising from his chair, he flung his arms round
his son's neck, and gave way to an access of
emotion.</p>

<p>Very shortly, however, he recovered, and, as if
ashamed of the display he had made, endeavoured
to assume a cold expression. But his lips still
quivered, and the voice was husky in which he
bade Alberic be seated.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

<p>"You have read this confession," he said,
laying his hand upon the papers, but keeping his
searching eye on his son as he spoke. "What
do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me to pass judgment on my
mother, sir," rejoined Alberic.</p>

<p>"Well, if you evade my question," rejoined
the colonel, sternly, "I will put another. What
would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"I dare not ask you,&mdash;yet I would it were in
your power to forgive her."</p>

<p>A flush dyed the colonel's pale cheek, and his
eye blazed fiercely.</p>

<p>"Alberic," he cried, "I would do much for
you&mdash;but not that."</p>

<p>"Father," rejoined Alberic, "have you read
that confession attentively?"</p>

<p>"Most attentively."</p>

<p>"And does it not move you?"</p>

<p>"Deeply."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

<p>"Shall I describe its effect on me? Shall I
say how much those cries, which evidently proceed
from a broken heart, have touched me? A
fatal mistake has led to frightful consequences.
But there was a time when she was guiltless&mdash;guiltless,
at least, towards you&mdash;and when all this
misery might have been spared. I would bring
you back to that time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am not free from blame," said the
colonel. "Had I known who she was I might
have acted differently."</p>

<p>"The past is irreparable. But I would try to
save you from further self-reproach. If my unhappy
mother has not expiated her errors by a
life of penitence, she has suffered much. By
those sufferings&mdash;by your former love&mdash;I would
intercede for her."</p>

<p>"Heaven, I hope, will forgive her," said the
colonel. "But do not urge me further now," he

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

added, with a movement of impatience. "Hereafter,
I may feel differently."</p>

<p>"Your forgiveness must not be delayed, if it
is to be of avail. I am sure she has not long
to live!"</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" demanded the colonel.</p>

<p>"The impression was produced upon me last
night. I cannot divest myself of it."</p>

<p>"I do not think I shall live long myself,"
muttered his father.</p>

<p>"Then I would the more earnestly exhort you
to forgive her&mdash;and without delay," urged his
son. "Go with me to Boxgrove to-night. You
will see her. Console her with a word&mdash;one
word will suffice. You will make me happy, and
she will die in peace. Listen to me, I implore
you."</p>

<p>And he would have flung himself at his father's
feet, but the colonel checked him.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

<p>"You have conquered, my son," he said. "I
will do as you desire. I will go with you to-night.
I felt I had something to do when I could not
rest in Paris, I now discover what it is."</p>

<p>"Some good power inspired your return," cried
his son. "Had you delayed a few days, it might
have been too late."</p>

<p>"True," ejaculated the colonel, solemnly.</p>

<p>He then locked up the packet in his travelling
case. This done, he went down with his
son to the coffee-room.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch13">

<p>XIII.</p>

<p class="small">FURTHER EXPLANATIONS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> colonel ordered breakfast, and Alberic,
who had eaten nothing since he had left the
cottage at an early hour, was well disposed to join
him, and did far more justice to what was set
before them than his father did.</p>

<p>They had just finished their repast, when who
should come into the coffee-room, which happened
to be empty at the time, but Mr. Thornton and
Mr. Radcliffe. On seeing them the colonel immediately
arose, and his son followed his example.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

<p>"God bless my soul, colonel, is that you?"
exclaimed Mr. Thornton, hurrying towards him,
and shaking him cordially by the hand. "Just
returned from Paris, I suppose. Charmed to see
you back. Can't say you're looking very well,
though."</p>

<p>"I am very far from well, my dear friend,"
replied the colonel. "But I trust I shall soon
come round."</p>

<p>He then addressed himself to Mr. Radcliffe,
who returned his salutation with great stiffness
and formality. After a few matter of course observations,
the colonel drew Alberic forward, and
said,</p>

<p>"I am glad of this opportunity of presenting
my son to you, gentlemen. You have known him
heretofore as Hilary St. Ives. Pray know him
now as Alberic Delacombe."</p>

<p>"I am very glad indeed to know Mr. Alberic

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

Delacombe," said Mr. Thornton, shaking hands
with the young man.</p>

<p>Mr. Radcliffe bowed very stiffly, and merely remarked,</p>

<p>"I have been told that you had adopted Mr. St.
Ives, colonel, but I was not aware that you had accorded
him your name."</p>

<p>"He bears the name to which he is lawfully
entitled," replied the colonel, haughtily. "He is
my son, sir."</p>

<p>"Born in wedlock?" observed Mr. Radcliffe,
with a half sneer.</p>

<p>"Hear me, Mr. Radcliffe," said the colonel,
"and let what I say remove all your doubts. He
is my son by my marriage with the only daughter
of Mr. Alberic Ilminster, of Jamaica."</p>

<p>"Is this the fact, colonel?" cried Mr. Radcliffe,
astounded.</p>

<p>"The fact, sir! Do you doubt my word?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

<p>"Heaven forbid! Only I am so much
astonished."</p>

<p>"No wonder you are astonished," cried Mr.
Thornton. "So am I. Why, Alberic Ilminster,
of Jamaica, was the younger brother of Sir
Umfraville Ilminster of Boxgrove, consequently
your wife, colonel, must have been poor Sir
Charles's first cousin."</p>

<p>"Perfectly correct, sir."</p>

<p>"I presume she died many years ago?"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir. She is alive now."</p>

<p>"Zounds! you have contrived to keep her in
the background in a very extraordinary manner,"
cried the old gentleman, winking at Mr. Radcliffe.
"We never heard of her."</p>

<p>"Never till this moment," echoed the other.</p>

<p>"Again you are mistaken, sir. Both you and
Mr. Radcliffe know her, and have seen her repeatedly."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

<p>"Pray explain the riddle," cried Mr. Thornton,
with a puzzled look, which, however, changed to
a cunning smile, as he exclaimed, "Aha! I have
it!&mdash;Mrs. Sutton&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Sutton this young man's mother?"
demanded Mr. Radcliffe, eagerly.</p>

<p>"My wife and Alberic's mother," rejoined the
colonel.</p>

<p>The worthy gentleman looked inexpressibly relieved.</p>

<p>"Would I had known this before," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I always thought Mrs. Sutton a very superior
woman," observed Mr. Thornton. "But I little
dreamed who she was."</p>

<p>As the coffee-room began now to fill, they adjourned
to a private room, where they could continue
their conversation without interruption.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

<p>By this time an extraordinary change had become
manifest in Mr. Radcliffe's demeanour
towards Colonel Delacombe and his son, especially
towards the latter. He was now just as
friendly with Alberic as he had previously been
cold and reserved, and strove to make amends for
the rudeness he had shown the young man. More
than once he repeated, "Oh, that I had known
this before!"</p>

<p>When the topic on which they had been
engaged was dismissed, Mr. Thornton alluded to
the engagement that had just been entered into
between the Marquis of Hartlepool and May, and
the colonel of course offered his congratulations to
the old gentleman and Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I know the marquis very well," he said.
"My son and I saw a good deal of him in Rome,
and liked him. He is not very brilliant, but he is
amiable, and&mdash;a marquis."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it is a splendid match," cried Mr.

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

Thornton, rubbing his hands with delight. "We
are all enchanted with it&mdash;eh?" he added to Mr.
Radcliffe, who did not, however, respond very
warmly to the appeal.</p>

<p>"It is a very important alliance, no doubt," he
said; "but I think it has been entered into
rather precipitately. May has scarcely had sufficient
time for consideration."</p>

<p>"Why, what's this? You insisted upon an immediate
decision, and I think you were perfectly
right," cried Mr. Thornton. "Don't you agree
with me, colonel?"</p>

<p>"With most girls there would be none, that I
own," rejoined the colonel. "But Miss Radcliffe
is not an ordinary girl. I did not think
she was likely to be dazzled by rank and splendour."</p>

<p>"Nor is she," replied Mr. Radcliffe. "I won't
say she sacrificed her own feelings, but she consented
to oblige us all&mdash;that's the fact."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

<p>The colonel slightly shrugged his shoulders,
but made no remark.</p>

<p>"She cannot fail to be happy, for the marquis
will let her have her own way in everything,"
observed Mr. Thornton. "We mean to
have the marriage celebrated with as little delay
as possible, and, in fact, it is on business connected
with it that we have come up to town
to-day."</p>

<p>To Alberic the subject under discussion was
exquisitely painful, and dreading lest he should
betray his feelings, he got up, and moved to a
window. He appeared to be watching the carriages
in Portland-place, but he scarcely noticed
them, when Mr. Radcliffe came up to him, and,
patting him in a friendly manner on the back,
said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Ah! if I had only known as much yesterday
as I do now, a very different arrangement

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

might have been made&mdash;not so splendid, but more
satisfactory to me."</p>

<p>"I could not enter into any explanation then,
Mr. Radcliffe, even if you would have allowed
me," rejoined Alberic. "And now it is too late."</p>

<p>Here a slight cough from the colonel recalled
Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I must claim your attention for a few minutes
more, sir," remarked the colonel. "You are acquainted
with the painful and peculiar circumstances
connected with my marriage. You are
acquainted with my wife's sad story. You have
known her intimately for many years, and can
judge of her conduct during that term."</p>

<p>"Her conduct, ever since I have known her,
has been irreproachable," said Mr. Radcliffe,
emphatically.</p>

<p>"Take my testimony to the same effect,
colonel," cried Mr. Thornton.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

<p>"For my son's sake," pursued the colonel, "I
have resolved to forget the past. And though
others may censure me, I do not think you will
blame my determination."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I applaud it," cried Mr.
Radcliffe. "And I can assure you it will sincerely
gratify me to convey the joyful intelligence
to your wife."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," said the colonel. "But
she must receive her forgiveness from no other
lips than mine."</p>

<p>"Then return with me to Boxgrove to-night,
colonel," cried Mr. Thornton. "See her without
delay."</p>

<p>"It was my intention to run down for that
purpose with my son," replied the colonel. "I
gladly accept your invitation. You shall precede
us," he added to Alberic. "Meet your mother
as appointed, and tell her all that has occurred.

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

That will obviate the necessity of further explanation,
and when I see her, it will be with less
painful emotion either on her part or mine."</p>

<p>In pursuance of the arrangement, Alberic set
off for Boxgrove Park by himself, leaving the
colonel to the care of his friends.</p>

<p>The three gentlemen dined at the Langham,
and did not take their departure till late in the
evening.</p>

<p>XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE THUNDERSTORM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alberic</span> had returned to the cottage.</p>

<p>He was all impatience to see his mother, and
convey to her the joyful intelligence of which he
was the bearer. The minutes seemed to pass
slowly, but at last the appointed hour drew near,
and he was preparing to set out for the place
of rendezvous in the park when a violent thunderstorm
came on, accompanied by a deluge of rain.</p>

<p>He waited, therefore, for a few minutes, expecting
that the fury of the storm would abate,

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

but as no improvement took place, he started, in
spite of all Dame Perrins's attempts to dissuade
him. The good old dame thought he must be
mad to venture forth on such a night. The rain
was coming down in torrents at the time, and
the blue forked flashes nearly blinded him, but
he dashed across the road, and was soon in the
thick of the chesnut-grove.</p>

<p>Here an appalling incident occurred. A loud
peal of thunder rattled overhead like a discharge
of artillery. A bolt fell, and a large tree was
struck within fifty yards of him&mdash;one of its huge
arms shivered, and the bark stripped from the
side of the trunk.</p>

<p>Stunned by the dreadful concussion, he was
unable to move for a few moments, and when
his powers returned, he almost thought of turning
back, as it was not likely his mother would brave
such a storm&mdash;but he went on.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

<p>Not without great difficulty, and frequent interruption,
did he get out of the grove, and then
not at the point he expected. But for the incessant
blaze of lightning the night would have
been pitch-dark. However, he descried the clump
of trees, and strode on in that direction as
rapidly as the slippery turf would allow him.</p>

<p>Still, the thunder rolled awfully, the lightning
flashed, and the hissing rain descended in
torrents.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he underwent a new alarm. Amid
the silence that followed a loud crash, he heard
a piercing scream, and felt convinced that it proceeded
from his mother.</p>

<p>Was she in danger, or merely alarmed by the
thunder? Another scream followed, though
scarcely distinguishable amid the din of the
storm.</p>

<p>Full of terror, he hurried on, and was nearing

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

the group of trees when two ruffianly-looking men
hurst forth. The foremost was armed with a
heavy bludgeon, but the other grasped a weapon,
which, seen by the lightning, looked like a long,
sharp-pointed knife, and seemed dripping with
blood.</p>

<p>The countenances of the miscreants almost
proclaimed the murderous deed on which they
had been engaged. Alberic recognised them at
once as the two villains who had robbed and
maltreated him on Wootton Heath, and coupling
their presence on the spot with the screams he
had just heard, fearful apprehensions were
roused.</p>

<p>Perhaps they had assassinated his mother.</p>

<p>Maddened by the thought, with a fierce cry
he rushed upon them, regardless of any consequences
to himself. He was wholly unarmed,
but rage supplied him with superhuman strength,

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

and made him a match for his antagonists, though
both were athletic men. Closing with the foremost
ruffian, and catching him by the throat
before he could strike a blow with the bludgeon,
he hurled him backwards against his comrade.</p>

<p>In falling the wretch was seriously hurt by
a stroke of the knife intended for the young
man, who was thus released from one of his
assailants. The next moment he was in possession
of the bludgeon, and a smashing blow with
it caused the other ruffian to drop his knife.</p>

<p>Both villains then fled, but the one who was
wounded had not gone more than a hundred
yards when he fell to the ground exhausted by
loss of blood. There he lay, vowing, with horrible
oaths, that he would hang the comrade
who had abandoned him.</p>

<p>Alberic, however, thought no more of either
of them. A half-stifled cry directed him to the

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

spot where his unfortunate mother was lying, and
he instantly flew towards her. The lightning
gave a livid hue like that of death to her pallid
features, her eyes were closed, and but that she
still breathed, or rather gasped for breath, he
might have thought that life was extinct.</p>

<p>But the life-blood was flowing fast from a
deep wound in her side, and he strove in vain
to stanch the crimson stream.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch15">

<p>XV.</p>

<p class="small">A RETROSPECT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> the unhappy Barbara came by her fate
must now be related.</p>

<p>The last day she was ever destined to see was
spent in perfect seclusion. May and Myrtilla
passed several hours with her, but could not induce
her to converse with them. Her thoughts were
elsewhere. She was told that Mr. Malham was
in the house, and wished to see her, but she
declined. She also refused to see Mrs. Radcliffe,

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

alleging that she was not equal to an interview
with any one.</p>

<p>"Beg your mother to excuse me," she said to
May. "If all is well I will see her to-morrow.
Pray let me be undisturbed to-day."</p>

<p>It was evident that she had not been able to
conquer her antipathy to her former mistress. But
her manner towards May was most tender and
affectionate, and when they were alone together
she expressed a truly maternal solicitude for her
happiness.</p>

<p>"I wish I could persuade myself that the
engagement you have entered into will make you
happy," she said. "But I know you can never
give the marquis your heart. On no account,
however, break off the engagement, unless your
father permits you to do so. Tell him all, and be
guided by his counsel. The sole desire of my
life would have been gratified if you could have

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

been united to Alberic, but fate seems against it,
and we must bow to its decrees. Whatever betide,
may you be happy!"</p>

<p>"The marquis has been here all day," said
May; "and he must be blind indeed if he does
not perceive that I dislike him."</p>

<p>Barbara regarded her compassionately.</p>

<p>"You have been persuaded to take a foolish
step, my dear child," she said. "But your father
will never allow you to be sacrificed if you tell him
the truth. Hide nothing from him."</p>

<p>"He is gone to London with grandpapa, or
I would have spoken to him to-day. I will never
wed the marquis."</p>

<p>After this the unhappy woman begged to be
left entirely to herself for a few hours.</p>

<p>How she passed the time was not known, but
when May entered the room she found her on
her knees, and her eyes were red with weeping.
However, she was perfectly calm, and almost

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

cheerful, and continued so until evening. But as
the hour approached when she was to meet her
son, she became nervously excited.</p>

<p>As there were indications of the terrible storm
we have described, her companions endeavoured
to dissuade her from going forth, but she would
not be turned from her purpose.</p>

<p>May and Myrtilla went with her to the library.
They took no lights, and as they hastily traversed
the gallery, a dazzlingly vivid flash momentarily
illumined the long line of portraits,
while a clap of thunder shook the mansion.</p>

<p>"I must meet Alberic," she cried. "I must
learn my fate."</p>

<p>Fearful of being detained, she resolved to set
out at once.</p>

<p>"Do not go, I beseech you," cried May,
greatly terrified. "Stop till the storm has
passed."</p>

<p>But Barbara hurried on.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

<p>They had descended the great staircase, and
reached the library without being perceived.
Barbara paused for a moment only to strain
May to her bosom, and whisper a word in her
ear.</p>

<p>Just as the window was opened another vivid
flash of lightning drove them back, and almost
blinded them.</p>

<p>When the others regained their sight, Barbara
was gone. But they beheld her upon the terrace,
speeding to her destination, unappalled by
the terrors of the storm.</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve her!" ejaculated May, fervently.</p>

<p>Heaven's support was needed by the unhappy
woman. Her hour had well-nigh come.</p>

<p>She had gained the park, and though the storm
had increased in violence, though the rain beat
against her brow, and the lightning played around
her, she went on.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

<p>"I shall find my son there," she exclaimed.
"He will not fail me."</p>

<p>She did not find him. But she found others
whom she did not expect.</p>

<p>As she entered the woody ring, two savage-looking
men who had watched her approach, as
shown by the lightning, burst upon her. One
of them seized her roughly by the arm to prevent
her flight, and, brandishing a knife, threatened
her with instant death if she uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"We knew you would come, in spite of the
storm," cried the ruffian, in a jeering tone.</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman glanced around, vainly
hoping that her son would appear.</p>

<p>"Ay, you may look round, madam," cried her
captor. "You'll see nothin' on him to-night."</p>

<p>"You lie, villain!" she exclaimed. "My son
will rescue me."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, madam. What
money have you got about you?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

<p>"None. I have neither money nor valuables.
Release me at once, ruffian."</p>

<p>Both men laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"We ain't a-goin' to part with you like that,
madam," said the other robber. "You ought to
have known better than to come out on an arrand
like this, without purse, or pocket-book, or rings.
But since you've been so careless, you must come
along wi' us, and I'd recommend you to come
quietly."</p>

<p>"I will not stir from this spot," she cried,
resolutely.</p>

<p>They seized her and attempted to drag her
off, but she caught hold of the branch of a
tree, and screamed loudly for help.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" cried one of the men,
with a terrible imprecation, "or I'll make you
keep silence."</p>

<p>But she struggled to get free, and continued

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

her outcries, hoping they would reach the ears
of her son. But for the rattling of the thunder
he would have heard them.</p>

<p>The struggle continued for a minute longer.
Then giving utterance to a sharper cry, she fell
back into the arms of one of her assailants.</p>

<p>"Why, thou'st killed her, Seth Cooper!" cried
this ruffian, aghast at the dreadful deed.</p>

<p>"She forced me to do it, curse her!" cried
Seth.</p>

<p>They were debating what should be done,
when, to their great alarm, they became aware
of Alberic's approach, and laying down the body
of their still breathing victim, they rushed to
meet him.</p>

<p>The result has been already narrated.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch16">

<p>XVI.</p>

<p class="small">HOW BARBARA WAS BROUGHT BACK TO BOXGROVE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alberic</span> raised the dying woman tenderly, and
subduing the emotion that threatened to overpower him, said,</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, mother? It is your
son."</p>

<p>The words seemed to recall her to life.</p>

<p>With a cry of delight she flung her arms round
his neck, and kissed him repeatedly.</p>

<p>But the effort was too great. Her hold relaxed.

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

Her head dropped, and a shiver passed
through her frame, prelusive of death.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, dear mother! speak to me!"
cried Alberic, greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"You have read my history. You know all!"
she rejoined faintly.</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>"And you forgive me?" she asked, with
trembling eagerness.</p>

<p>"Dearest mother, I have nothing to forgive.
But I bring you my father's forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Is he here?" she cried. "Bring him to me."</p>

<p>"Alas, I cannot!" rejoined her son. "He is
on his way to you."</p>

<p>"But he will not arrive in time. I knew we
should never meet again on earth. Bid him
farewell for me, and say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here her voice became inaudible.</p>

<p>Alberic placed his car close to her lips, but

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

could not catch the words. Her eyes, however,
were fixed upon him, and did not quit him till
they grew dim.</p>

<p>Another shudder, and all was over.</p>

<p>He gave way to no unavailing transports of
grief, but continued to hold her in his arms and
gaze at her rigid features, which, seen by the
lightning, sometimes looked as if life had returned
to them.</p>

<p>From this state he was roused by shouts proceeding
from some men who had descried him
from another part of the park, and were hurrying
towards him.</p>

<p>Laying down the body, he answered their
shouts, and the men soon afterwards coming up
proved to be Frank Mowatt, the head gamekeeper,
and two of his subordinates. All three had guns,
and were attended by a couple of large hounds,
and the latter began to growl as they approached
the scene of the murder.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

<p>"Why, what's this?" cried Mowatt, horrified
by the spectacle that met his gaze. "Who has
done the foul deed? Thou?" he added, levelling
his gun at Alberic.</p>

<p>"Keep your shot for the right man," rejoined
the other, sternly. "One of the assassins is not
far off, and the other must be in the park, and
may be captured if you don't waste time."</p>

<p>His manner caused the keeper to lower his
gun, while instant proof of the truth of the
assertion was afforded by the hounds, who,
having discovered the fallen wretch, were threatening
to worry him, and had already given him
a taste of their sharp fangs. The two underkeepers
hurried to the spot, called off the dogs,
and secured the terrified caitiff.</p>

<p>"Leave this villain to our charge," cried
Alberic, who came up the next moment with
Mowatt, "and go in search of his accomplice.
You cannot fail to track him with these hounds."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

<p>"Ay, they're on his trail already," rejoined one
of the keepers. "Must we go, Master Mowatt?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure, Paul, and bring him back
dead or alive,", rejoined the head keeper. "I'll
take care of this chap, and shoot him if he gives
any trouble."</p>

<p>"Sarve him right, too," cried Paul, as he hurried
after his mate.</p>

<p>The hounds had evidently got on the scent,
and led them towards the thicket at the bottom
of the park.</p>

<p>While Alberic and Mowatt were considering
what it would be best to do under the circumstances,
the head keeper thought he could discover
some persons in the neighbourhood of the mansion,
and in order to attract their attention, he not only
shouted lustily, but fired off one of the barrels of
his gun.</p>

<p>The signal was quickly attended to. The

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

persons whom the keeper had seen were some of
the men-servants, who had been sent by May and
Lady Richborough to look for Mrs. Sutton. With
them was Mr. Malham, the surgeon, who chanced
to be at the house at the time.</p>

<p>Guided by the shouts and the report of the
gun, the whole party were soon on the spot, and
filled with consternation on learning the dreadful
occurrence. Mr. Malham was profoundly affected.
A glance at the body showed him that life was
extinct, but still he knelt down to examine the
wound.</p>

<p>By his direction a hurdle was brought, and on it
was carefully laid the body, which he covered
with his own ample cloak. Alberic was too much
overcome to take part in the melancholy proceedings,
and remained looking sadly on, with his arms
folded upon his breast.</p>

<p>The little procession then moved slowly towards

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

the mansion, the rear being brought up by Frank
Mowatt and two grooms, who had charge of the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Here we mention that Seth Cooper was captured
by the two keepers in the thicket, and being taken
by them to the Hall, was lodged with his partner
in guilt in an outbuilding until the arrival of the
officers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Colonel Delacombe had arrived at
Boxgrove, and was still in the entrance-hall with
Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton. They had just
been joined by May and Mrs. Woodcot, when
the principal door was thrown open, and Mr.
Malham came in, followed by the bearers with
their ghastly burden. Behind them appeared
Alberic.</p>

<p>Covered from head to foot by the cloak, as with
a pall, the body was laid by the bearers on an
antique carved oak table in the centre of the hall,
above which hung a lamp.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

<p>As the body was brought in, Oswald came forth
from the drawing-room, which opened upon the
entrance-hall, and was immediately followed by
Mrs. Radcliffe, Myrtilla, and the Marquis of
Hartlepool.</p>

<p>Astonishment and horror kept the throng of
spectators mute, but the climax was reached when
Colonel Delacombe stepped forward and drew
aside the cloak that shrouded the pallid features
of his wife.</p>

<p>Uttering a sharp cry, he would have fallen to
the ground, if he had not been caught by the
surgeon.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

<div class="center" id="b3ch17">

<p>XVII.</p>

<p class="small">AN EVENTFUL EVENING.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> months had elapsed.</p>

<p>The ill-fated Barbara had found a resting-place
in the family vault of the Ilminsters, and her
murderers had paid the penalty of their crime.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe was still at Boxgrove. The
terrible shock he had undergone had well-nigh
proved fatal. At last he rallied, but was for
several weeks confined to his room.</p>

<p>A large state chamber was assigned him by
Mr. Thornton, fitted up with antique furniture,

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

and having bay windows that afforded him a view
of the gardens and the park. There he sat in an
easy chair, looking very pale, very thin, very
feeble, but still very handsome; read the newspapers
or a novel; dictated his letters to his son,
or chatted with his visitors, of whom he had
plenty.</p>

<p>For more than a month Alberic had been in
constant attendance upon his sire, but since then
he had been frequently in town. Mr. Thornton,
who, as we know, played the part of host at Boxgrove,
made him feel quite at home, and he went
and came just as he liked.</p>

<p>May's engagement to the Marquis of Hartlepool
still subsisted. Owing to recent events the
marriage had been postponed&mdash;indefinitely, it
seemed, for no entreaties on the part of the
marquis or Lady Richborough could induce the
young lady to fix the day. Thoroughly impressed

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

with the importance of the alliance, Mrs. Radcliffe
prevented any positive rupture, though she could
not bring about the consummation she desired.
Mr. Radcliffe was secretly averse to the match,
but would not withdraw the promise he had given
to the marquis.</p>

<p>At length, the colonel came down-stairs, and
a few drives in the open carriage completely restored
him. A dinner-party was given to celebrate
his recovery. It was a tolerably large party, but
not at all formal, and comprised the Rev. Nisbet
Jones and Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Clifford and her fair
daughter Gwendoline, Mr. Brooke of Sandhills
and his daughter Jessie, two or three young men,
and most important of all, though we have placed
him last in the list, the Marquis of Hartlepool.
The marquis was staying at the time at Hazlemere.
The members of the family consisted of
Oswald and his mother, the Radcliffes, and, of

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

course, Mr. Thornton, who did the honours for
his grand-daughter.</p>

<p>May did not always dine with her guests&mdash;perhaps
we ought to call them grandpapa's
guests&mdash;but she favoured them on this occasion.
Lady Richborough was likewise present, and
Alberic.</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent, as the dinners always
were at Boxgrove, and passed off very pleasantly.
Everybody was delighted to see Colonel Delacombe
down-stairs again, and the colonel himself
was in very good spirits, and ventured upon a
glass of champagne, which he had not tasted
since his illness.</p>

<p>But the Marquis of Hartlepool was really the
life of the party. Placed between May and
Myrtilla, he not only managed to amuse them
both by his pleasant sallies, but contributed
materially to the general gaiety.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

<p>After dinner, the ladies strolled out into the
garden to enjoy the delicious summer evening,
and the young men, who did not care for the
claret and still less for the old port, so dear to
Mr. Thornton and Mr. Radcliffe, sallied forth to
join them. Alberic, however, soon separated
himself from the merry party on the lawn, and
withdrew to a more secluded part of the garden.
He was seated on a bench near a bosquet,
wrapped in thought, when he was roused from
his reverie by May.</p>

<p>"I have come to look for you," she said.
"You must not desert us thus."</p>

<p>"I shall not contribute to your amusement,"
he replied in a melancholy voice. "I am out of
spirits this evening, and cannot for the life of
me shake off my despondency."</p>

<p>"I thought you looked extremely dull at
dinner," she rejoined, "and wondered what was

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

the matter. But come with me. We will soon
chase away your gloom."</p>

<p>"Grant me a few moments," he cried, detaining
her. "I have something to say to
you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, taking a seat beside
him.</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised at my sadness
when I tell you that I have come to the resolution
of bidding you farewell. To-morrow I
shall leave Boxgrove&mdash;not to return. You cannot
be unaware of the hopeless passion that consumes
me. I have made every effort to conquer it&mdash;but
in vain. Nothing is left me but to withdraw
from the influence of an attraction that I find
irresistible. I ought to have fled long ago, but
I could not tear myself away. I shall suffer ten
times more from the separation, which must now
take place, than I should have done at an earlier

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

period. I must, therefore, go while I have strength
enough for the effort."</p>

<p>"No, Alberic," she replied. "I will not allow
you to depart."</p>

<p>"You are very cruel. If you knew the torture
I endure you would not bid me prolong it. Blissful
as it is to be near you, the ever-recurring
thought that I must lose you poisons my happiness,
while the conviction that you will soon
become the bride of another almost drives me
mad."</p>

<p>"You must bear the torture a little longer."</p>

<p>"To what end?" he cried, bitterly. "There
can be no hope for me. You are plighted to
the marquis."</p>

<p>"He will give me back to my word."</p>

<p>"Do not think it. He is resolved to make you
his bride. Except your father, all the rest of
your family, including Lady Richborough, are

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

most anxious for the marriage. You have made
a rash promise, and must perforce keep it."</p>

<p>"But I won't keep it!" exclaimed May, resolutely.</p>

<p>"Your father considers himself bound by his
promise. The obligation is equally great on
you."</p>

<p>"I will speak to the marquis to-night. I will
appeal to his good feelings&mdash;to his generosity,
to liberate me from a promise that was in reality
extorted from me."</p>

<p>As she arose, two persons unexpectedly appeared
before her.</p>

<p>The two persons were the marquis and Myrtilla.</p>

<p>"When you have confidential matters to discuss
you should not talk quite so loud," observed
the marquis. "Lady Richborough and I have
unwittingly heard all that has passed, and of
course I am aware of the appeal you intended

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

to make to me. On one condition, and one only
will I release you from your promise."</p>

<p>"What is the condition?" cried May, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I do not think you will consider it very
hard," he rejoined, with a smile. "The condition
I exact is that you bestow the hand which
you have promised to me on my friend, Alberic
Delacombe. You have already, it appears, given
him your heart."</p>

<p>Nothing could equal the astonishment of his
hearers.</p>

<p>"My dear marquis!" exclaimed Alberic, transported
with delight. "This generosity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is quite unexpected, I know. But you are
rather mistaken in me. I am not altogether
devoid of gratitude. Remember that you laid
me under an everlasting obligation by saving
my life at Rome. I am now able in part to
requite it."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

<p>"You have requited it a thousand fold, my
dear marquis," cried Alberic. "You have made
me the happiest of men&mdash;that is, if the condition
is accepted," he added to May.</p>

<p>"Very little doubt about that," said the
marquis. "Still, to make sure, let us have a
precise answer."</p>

<p>"There is my hand," cried May, giving it to
Alberic, who pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>"So the gipsy's prophecy will be fulfilled after
all," said Myrtilla. "You recollect what she told
you at Ascot. But what will papa and mamma
say to this sudden transfer of their daughter
without consulting them? Above all, what will
grandpapa say? I, too, have never been consulted,
and I do not at all like losing the dear marquis."</p>

<p>"You may still keep him if you choose," said
the marquis.</p>

<p>"Still keep him?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

<p>"Yes. You promised to help me to a wife, and
may still do so, if you are so inclined."</p>

<p>"Take care what you say, marquis," rejoined
Myrtilla. "I might construe that pretty speech
into an offer."</p>

<p>"It is so meant. And I here, in plain terms,
repeat it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this time the elderly gentlemen, who had
remained rather longer over their wine than their
juniors, had come forth upon the lawn, where the
assemblage was broken up into little groups. Mr.
Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton were discussing some
political questions with the vicar, and Colonel
Delacombe was expatiating on the beauty of the
evening to Mrs. Radcliffe, when the marquis and
the others were seen approaching.</p>

<p>"The marquis looks as if he had something to

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

communicate," remarked the colonel. "I shouldn't
wonder if the wedding-day were fixed."</p>

<p>"High time it should be," replied Mrs. Radcliffe.
"I am quite tired of so much delay."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Radcliffe," said the marquis, stepping
forward before the others, "I have to inform you
that within the last few minutes a slight change
has taken place in my arrangements with your
daughter."</p>

<p>"A change!" exclaimed the lady. "You alarm
me, marquis."</p>

<p>"No occasion for alarm, my dear madam," he
rejoined, reassuring her with a smile. "But
perhaps your husband ought to hear my communication."</p>

<p>"Mr. Radcliffe, your presence is required,"
cried the colonel.</p>

<p>"And mine, too, I suppose," said Mr. Thornton,
whose curiosity was aroused.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

<p>"Shall I retire, marquis?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"On no account," replied the other. "You
are an interested party. Mr. Radcliffe," he pursued,
addressing that gentleman, who had come
up with Mr. Thornton, "I will state to you in
as few words as possible what I have to say. I
cannot have the honour of becoming your son-in-law!"</p>

<p>"Oh! marquis, I did not expect this," almost
screamed Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"I presume, marquis, that you have some
reasons for your withdrawal?" said Mr. Radcliffe,
who did not look as discomposed as his wife.</p>

<p>"My reasons are not to be disputed," replied
the marquis. "I have just discovered that your
daughter entertains a preference for my friend,
Alberic Delacombe, and I have therefore at once
retired in his favour. You cannot oblige me
more than by bestowing her hand upon him."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

<p>"My lord marquis," said Mr. Radcliffe, much
moved, "I cannot sufficiently express my admiration
of your conduct. It is worthy of you."</p>

<p>"Then you consent?" cried the marquis.</p>

<p>"What says Colonel Delacombe?" asked Mr.
Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Nothing would please me more," he rejoined.
"I have long been aware of Alberic's attachment
to your daughter, and discouraged it because
I considered it hopeless; but now that there is
no obstacle I will ask your consent, and that of
Mrs. Radcliffe, to the match."</p>

<p>"You have mine, colonel," replied Mr. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"Am I dreaming?" cried Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"No, my dear madam," replied the marquis,
laughing; "both you and I have been dreaming
for some time, but we are perfectly awake now.
Make your daughter happy."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

<p>"Must I consent?" said Mrs. Radcliffe, appealing
to Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied the old gentleman.
"Since things have taken this turn we must all
consent."</p>

<p>The matter being thus satisfactorily settled,
the young couple came forward and received the
general felicitations of the assemblage.</p>

<p>"What a charming scene!" observed Lady
Richborough to the marquis.</p>

<p>"Well, you have acted admirably, marquis,"
said the colonel, coming up. "But though my
son is the gainer, I can't help feeling sorry for
you."</p>

<p>"Spare your pity, my dear colonel. I am not
so unlucky as you suppose. I have rather gained
than lost, as I am sure you will admit when I
inform you that Lady Richborough has promised
me her hand."</p>


<p>"Then, indeed, you are to be envied, marquis,
and I offer you my sincere congratulations. I
almost wonder that her ladyship was not your
original choice."</p>

<p>"The fault is Myrtilla's, not mine," said the
marquis.</p>

<p>"How is the fault mine?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Have you not told me scores of times that
you would never marry again?"</p>

<p>"Not since you were Marquis of Hartlepool.
That makes all the difference. As a younger
brother you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely. I ought to have taken that into
consideration. But I didn't. However, it's all
right now."</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the assemblage
when it was buzzed about that an engagement
had just been entered into between the marquis
and Lady Richborough, and a good deal of merriment

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

was excited among the young people, who
hardly knew whether to treat the matter seriously
or not. When convinced of the truth of
the announcement, they thought that the whole
thing must have been planned, and indeed it
looked like it.</p>

<p>When Colonel Delacombe looked for his son
he had disappeared. May also was gone. They
had wandered together towards the most secluded
part of the garden, where they could pour out
their thoughts without restraint, and interchange
their vows. But the boundless love that each felt
for the other found but feeble and inadequate
expression in words. Alberic could only tell May
that he loved her better than life&mdash;that he had
always loved her&mdash;and should never cease to love
her, while life lasted. And with this assurance
she was content.</p>

<p>Nothing half so sentimental passed between

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

the Marquis of Hartlepool and Lady Richborough.
They had a long t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, it is true,
but they did not talk of love. The marquis
made no protestations of undying affection, nor
did he indulge in common-places of any kind
which he knew very well she would not care to
hear; but he spoke about his plans for the
autumn, for the winter, and for the spring, and
quite satisfied her that it would be a very charming
thing to be Marchioness of Hartlepool.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that the change
that had occurred was a great disappointment to
Mrs. Radcliffe and Mr. Thornton. They had
looked forward to the alliance which was to
reflect so much splendour upon themselves as a
matter of certainty, and now that there was an
end of it, their vanity underwent a severe shock.
There was some slight consolation in reflecting
that the marquis was not altogether lost, since
Myrtilla had secured him.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

<p>However, before the end of the evening the
old gentleman's thoughts were turned into another
channel. Almost all the company had returned to
the drawing-room, where music was going on,
when Mrs. Woodcot asked for a song from Jessie
Brooke, who had a charming voice. The young
lady, however, was still on the terrace with
Oswald. Mr. Brooke called his daughter in, but
when she came, she begged Mrs. Radcliffe to
excuse her from singing, pleading a slight cold.
Mr. Thornton had some suspicions of the truth,
and they were soon confirmed by Oswald, who
took him aside, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've been and done it."</p>

<p>"Been and done what?"</p>

<p>"Followed your advice, sir. You told me to
propose to Jessie Brooke."</p>

<p>"I don't recollect telling you so."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you did. You told me she would
accept me, and you were right. You added&mdash;and

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

I thought it extremely considerate on your part&mdash;that
you would make a handsome settlement
upon her, and a liberal allowance to me. I hope
you'll be as good as your word."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must have made the promise,
though I've quite forgotten it," replied the
old gentleman, with a comical look that quite
satisfied his grandson. "I'll go and talk the
matter over with Mr. Brooke, and ascertain what
he'll do."</p>

<p>"You are the best of granddads," cried the
grateful youth.</p>

<p>This is the last event we have to record of that
eventful evening, when an engagement was no
sooner broken off than two others were formed,
and a third entered into immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>XIX.</p>

<p class="small">HOW THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> sure was man happier than Alberic.
Fortune, that so long had frowned upon him, had
now bestowed her choicest favours&mdash;had given
him a name, an excellent social position, and for
a bride, the loveliest and wealthiest girl in the
county. Not a wish was ungratified.</p>

<p>And May was just as happy. We have shown
that she did not care for rank and splendour, and
had she been condemned to such a life would have

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

been wretched. Even Mrs. Radcliffe and Mr.
Thornton came to this conclusion after they had
got over their first disappointment, and felt that
things had been much better ordered by fate than
they could have ordered them.</p>

<p>As to Colonel Delacombe, he was almost as
happy as his son. If he could have selected a
wife for Alberic he would have chosen May, but
he deemed the prize unattainable.</p>

<p>Let us here state that the marquis had no
reason to regret that he had yielded to his generous
impulses. With his tastes and with his
mode of existence, it is perfectly clear that May
would not have suited him, and would very soon
have been neglected and unhappy. But Myrtilla
had every qualification for the brilliant part which
she was called upon to play. As Marchioness
of Hartlepool she speedily eclipsed all her competitors
in the world of fashion, and reached the
pinnacle of her ambition.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 297 -->

<p>Nor has she been dethroned. No parties so
splendid, so attractive, as hers. Her toilettes are
perfection&mdash;her equipages the most elegant in
town. Wherever she appears, the haughty marchioness
dazzles all beholders. Her superb beauty
excites universal admiration. Yet with all her
pride she is popular, for she is good-natured, and
can be condescending when she pleases. Not
without reason is the marquis proud of her. Not
without reason does he congratulate himself on
his choice of a consort. If he has ennobled her,
she has materially heightened his influence and
importance.</p>

<p>It only remains to conduct Alberic and May
to the altar. Preparations for the marriage were
made as expeditiously as possible, and caused a
busy time both at Boxgrove and Hazlemere.
Some little delay occurred, since it was arranged
that the marriage of Oswald with Jessie Brooke
should take place on the same day.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

<p>At last, however, all preliminary arrangements
were completed. The settlements were made,
and were entirely satisfactory to those principally
concerned. Mr. Thornton behaved very
liberally to his grandson, and settled upon the
young lady, whom Oswald had chosen, a sum
equal to that given her by her father.</p>

<p>The two marriages were celebrated, under the
most auspicious circumstances, at Wootton Church&mdash;the
ceremonies being performed by the vicar.</p>

<p>Bright sunshine gladdened the hearts of those
collected in the precincts of the ancient fabric
to witness the arrival of the wedding parties.
All the bridesmaids were extremely pretty, and
charmingly dressed, and Jessie Brooke looked remarkably
well, but an irrepressible murmur of
admiration burst from the throng as May stepped
from the carriage, and was led by her father towards
the antique porch, along a path strewn
with flowers.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

<p>How exquisitely beautiful she looked in her
bridal attire! And her beauty was of a kind
to produce the greatest effect upon those who
pressed forward to gaze upon her. They were
charmed by the sweetness of her looks, as well
as by her rare loveliness. Audible wishes for
her happiness in her married life accompanied
her in her progress.</p>

<p>Amid these expressions of heartfelt interest,
which could not fail to move her, she entered the
sacred building, and, still led by her father, passed
along the crowded aisle&mdash;crowded with kindly
faces&mdash;to the altar, where a large assemblage was
already collected.</p>

<p>A wedding in a country church is always a
pretty sight, if there is any interest in the bridegroom
and bride, but the double wedding we are
now describing formed one of the prettiest pictures
imaginable.</p>

<p>No handsomer couple than Alberic and May

<!-- vol 3 page 300 -->

ever knelt before the altar; and our stalwart
friend Oswald and his fair young bride were also
noticeable for their good looks. A bevy of as
lovely bridesmaids as could well be brought together
surrounded them. Among the principal
figures was Mr. Radcliffe, who stood beside his
daughter, and who seemed much affected. Near
him was Mrs. Radcliffe. On the other side were
Mrs. Woodcot and Mr. Thornton. But by far
the most striking personage in the group was
Colonel Delacombe, whose tall, thin, military
figure towered above those around him.</p>

<p>As the newly-married couples returned to the
carriages that were waiting for them at the gates,
amid the joyous pealing of the bells, there was
quite a tumult in the churchyard. Alberic then
came in for his share of admiration, and everybody
declared that he was worthy of his lovely
bride.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

<p>There were great festivities that day at Hazlemere.
The wedding-breakfast was splendid, the
long table being decorated with flowers and
choicest fruit. There was the usual speech-making,
by far the best speech being made by
the worthy vicar.</p>

<p>After the repast, a couple of carriages, each
having four horses, drew up near the hall-door.
In the foremost Alberic and his bride set out for
Tunbridge Wells, en route for Como; while the
other conveyed Oswald and his bride to Dorking,
whence they intended to proceed to Scotland.</p>

<p>After a delicious sojourn of a couple of months
at Bellagio, Alberic and his wife returned to
Boxgrove.</p>

<p>Though they had never tired of the scenery
of the lovely Italian lake, they were not sorry to
get back. Boxgrove had charms for them that no
other place could offer, and they would not quit it

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

again during the ensuing winter or spring, though
tempted by repeated invitations from the Marquis
and Marchioness of Hartlepool.</p>

<h3>L'Envoy</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> more has to be recorded.</p>

<p>The Radcliffes still reside at Hazlemere, which
is kept up as well as ever. Mr. Radcliffe is not
quite so active as he used to be, but otherwise
in good case. Mrs. Radcliffe still describes herself
as an invalid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodcot has left Boxgrove, and resides
with Oswald and his wife in the neighbourhood
of Chester, where grandpapa has bought them a
very pretty place.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton himself, who is still very hearty,
and can get through a bottle of port after dinner
without feeling any inconvenience from it next

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

morning, passes his time between Hazlemere and
Boxgrove, though he sometimes pays a visit to
his grandson.</p>

<p>Colonel Delacombe, we regret to say, is gone.
He died in India, whither he had returned.</p>

<p>The most important change remains to be
mentioned. By the influence of the Marquis of
Hartlepool, and in consideration of the large
landed property he has derived by his marriage,
our fortunate hero has been elevated to the dignity
of a baronet, and has assumed the name of
the ancient family to which he belongs on his
mother's side. He is now <span class="smcap">Sir Alberic Delacombe
Ilminster</span>, Bart., of Boxgrove.</p>
