<p>CRITICAL ESTIMATE</p>

<p>OF</p>

<h2>MRS. STODDARD'S NOVELS</h2>

<p>BY EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>ALL lovers of true literature will consider it both
just and fortunate that Mrs. Stoddard's books of
fiction should now be reproduced in standard Library
form, as a recognition of their place among works
of fascinating interest and permanent value. These
tales, their scenes and period, antedate the younger
generation. Yet they are essentially modern, and
in keeping with the choicest types of recent fiction.
To be before one's time, in authorship, is as trying
as to be born too late. If "The Morgesons," "Two
Men," and "Temple House," had not been written
until the tempest of the Civil War was more
fully assuaged,&mdash;if in other respects the season had
been ripe,&mdash;they would have been received by the
many, as they were by the critical few, for what they
verily were&mdash;the pioneers of something new and real
in the novelist's art.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of something real, without doubt, for the keynote
of "Two Men" is surely that saying of Emerson's
which precedes it: "Let us treat the men
and women . . . . as if they were real&mdash;perhaps
they are." By the rule of her own nature, Mrs.
Stoddard was among the first to break away from a
prevailing false sentiment, to paint "things seen"
as they are&mdash;to suggest the unseen as it must be.</p>

<p>But that her stories of human life, in a down-east
village port, are "realistic," and were so in
the adverse time of their first appearance, is not
their vital claim. For they are "romantic," none
the less, and often impassioned. I find little profit
in the jealous conflict waged as to the values of
the so-called realistic and romantic schools; save
that it has brought out some good criticism,
and that every such warfare is stimulating to both
sides. Otherwise, it is chiefly an expression of
one's taste or distaste for certain writers, or his
opinion that too persistent fashions should in
their turns give way. Often it is a dispute or
confusion as to the meaning of a word. For who
can doubt that art, to be of worth, must never be
an abject copyist yet should have its basis in life
as it is and things as they are,&mdash;or that impassioned
speech and action must be natural even in their
intensity? Who does not feel that the most daring
idealism must keep within the possibilities, as we
conceive them, of nature; that Romance, with the
bird of the Danish proverb, though soaring high,
must seek its food on earth? Away then, like the
author of these novels, from the mouthing, the
stilted talk, the sentimentalism, of a pseudo-romantic
school. On the other hand, of what value is a
realistic work, with no strong personality behind
it? The true question is&mdash;how much of invention,
imagination, passion, has gone into its making?
The method is nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;compared with
the quality of the practitioner. All methods, as
time and fashion change, become the servants of
genius: it does great things with all and in spite
of any.</p>

<p>In these days of training and opportunity, moreover,
there is a notion that most things can be
effected by toil and culture; whereas, in all art,
that which is significant is the result of a special
gift&mdash;call it what you will. It comes with the
uncommon touch, the sensitive ear and eye,&mdash;with
that sixth sense, the vision which sees "what's
under lock and key, man's soul." Mrs. Stoddard's
novels appeal to us through a quality of their own.
Written, I think, without much early practice, yet
with experience of life, their strong original style&mdash;unmistakable
as a human voice&mdash;is that of one with
a gift, and the writer's instinct produces effects
which a mere artist tries for in vain. Style, insight,
originality, make books like "Two Men" and
"Temple House" additions not merely to the
bulk of reading, but to literature itself; as distinct
in their kind as "Wuthering Heights" and "Margaret,"
or even as "P&egrave;re Goriot" or "Richard
Feverel." They express an individuality: many
will like it, others may not, but it is here. The
latter class must be blind, I think, to certain excellences.
If we love nature, who sees its broad and
minute features like this woman, or puts them in
with more sure and brief touches,&mdash;rarely, and
as a background to her groups and action, and
through that innate knowledge of their subordinate
use which belongs to the true dramatic
faculty?</p>

<p>The human elements of "Two Men," for example,
seem the more notable for its narrow limits, and
for the smallness of the stage on which tragedy
and comedy are set forth. The personages are
sharply outlined; their play of thought and passion
is the more intense for an atmosphere of repression,
the Puritan air, tempered by free ocean
winds,&mdash;breathing which, many an Osmond Parke
must needs be a rover and cosmopolite. Yet one
is reminded of Thoreau's avowal that he knew the
world, for he had traveled many years in Concord.
Things and manners doubtless have changed in
"Crest," but these folk are still modern&mdash;for we
read their souls, and their speech bewrayeth them.
Generations come and go in this short tale: its
scenes of life, love and death are strangely impressive.
The commonplace is here, but not dwelt
upon, and slight actions are full of meaning; the
bustle of Cuth and Elsa at their work, Jason's trick
of throwing up his hammer and catching it on the
turn,&mdash;these are characteristic and essential. How
vividly, as the story goes on, each figure lives,
moves, and has its being:&mdash;Sarah, the typical
woman of her race, whose indomitable negative
force keeps all within the circle of her narrow will&mdash;Cuth
and Elsa, the family "help," faithful as dogs,
reflecting and commenting like a Greek chorus&mdash;the
winning, selfish, sensuous, irresolute Osmond
and Parke&mdash;the wholesome and handsome Theresa&mdash;the
noble Philippa, slow-moulded into perfect
womanhood&mdash;the provincial village-folk&mdash;among
all, over all, the grim form and visage of the heroic
carpenter, Jason Auster, the down-east village
Lincoln of our tale!  <i>Les hommes sont rares</i>,  and
here is one to remember. Such a creation, of itself,
lifts "Two Men" quite above the range of ordinary
novels. The author's dramatic gift is illustrated
by the picturesque and tragic episode of the quadroon
mother and her daughters, the crime of Parke
Auster, the fate of Charlotte&mdash;that beautiful, helpless,
exotic flower of the tropics, blighted in
the pitiless north.</p>

<p>Such a book will bear study. I have read it often,
each time with a stronger perception of its author's
individuality; Mrs. Stoddard's other novels, her
short stories, her fugitive poems, are marked by
the same qualities&mdash;they could be the work of no
hand save her own. All seek to answer Parke
Auster's question: "Such revelations come so
unexpectedly from those who are the nearest to us!
There is something appalling behind the screen
of every-day life, countenance, custom, clothes.
What is it?" Their faults, moreover, are characteristic.
A few more readers, a quicker understanding
of her work,&mdash;there being "something of
summer even in the hum of insects"&mdash;would have
stimulated her to the frequent labor which results
in constructive perfection.  Yet the wilding flavor
of these early novels might have been lost in the
process. Let us take them as they are, for so they
are worth taking.</p>

<h2>TWO MEN.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Jason Auster married Sarah Parke he
was twenty years old, and a house-carpenter.
As he was not of age, he made some agreement
with a hard father by which liberty was gained,
and a year's wages lost. He left his native village,
filled with no adventurous spirit, but with a simple
confidence that he should find the place where he
could earn a living by his trade, and put in practice
certain theories concerning the rights of men and
property which had already made him a pest at
home. The stage-coach which conveyed him
thence, traversed a line of towns that made no impression
from his point of view&mdash;the coach window;
but when it stopped to change horses at
Crest, a lively maritime town, and he alighted to
stretch his cramped legs, he saluted Destiny. Its
aspect, that spring day, pleased him; he heard the
rain of blows from broad-axes in the ship-yards by
the water's edge, and saw new roofs and chimneys
rising along the irregular streets among rows of
ancient houses, and concluded to stay. He unstrapped
a small trunk from the stage-rack, carried
it into the tavern entry, and looked about him for
some one to address. A man who had been eying
the trunk advanced towards him with a resolutely
closed mouth, and hands concealed in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Do you keep this tavern?" Jason asked; "and
do you want a boarder?"</p>

<p>"Yes siree," the man replied, in a loud cheerful
voice.</p>

<p>"What is board now?"</p>

<p>"Three dollars per week."</p>

<p>"I think I will stop here. My name is Auster."</p>

<p>"I agree; but maybe you had rather go to the
other tavern where they sell liquor, with flies in it.
I keep a temperance house."</p>

<p>"Good," answered Jason, pulling off his overcoat.
"I have got a temperance lecture in my
trunk; I wrote it last winter. I'll lend it to you
to read."</p>

<p>"I ain't much of a hand at reading handwriting,"
the tavern-keeper replied with a dubious
look; but catching sight of Jason's carpenter's
rule, his face brightened. "Guess you are a carpenter,"
he exclaimed; "just the place for you.
We are growing like the mischief since whale-oil
is so high."</p>

<p>The arrangement for board was concluded, and
Jason began life in Crest with ten dollars, two
suits of clothes, and a few articles, which consisted
of several shirts, two books whose titles were
"Man's Social Destiny," and "Humanity in
Limbo," a pincushion with <i>Forget me not</i> embroidered
upon it, and the temperance lecture.</p>

<p>Before night he had taken the bearings of Crest,
and was satisfied that he had made a good choice.
The week following he sent to a boss-carpenter a
novel design for mantel-pieces, which proved the
means of an engagement to work with a gang on
the inside of a Congregational church about to be
built. With the whistling of his plane he began to
air his theories of Socialism, Abolitionism, and
Teetotalism, and amused his fellow-workmen, who
never mistrusted that he intended to be believed,
or that he was in earnest, for his manners belied
his words. He appeared indifferent, shy and cold.</p>

<p>As the church progressed it became a place of
resort, especially in the fine summer afternoons,
when groups of young women perambulated the
aisles, sat in the doorless pews, or hung over the
unfinished gallery. One day two ladies went up
the pulpit stairs, while Jason was at work on its
moulding below; looking up to caution them
against stepping on certain loose boards on the
flooring, he saw that he was too late, for the lady
in advance was already half in the cavity under the
floor, and only kept herself up by a clutch on the
desk. Jason bounded up the stairs and extricated
her; as he did this he heard a shrill laugh from her
companion, which made him laugh too.</p>

<p>"I wish it had been you, Sarah Parke," she exclaimed.
"Thank you, sir," she said stiffly to
Jason, without looking at him.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to my help," he answered
quietly. "Of course, I owed it to you." And he
returned to his work.</p>

<p>"Who was the black-eyed girl that didn't fall
in?" he asked of one of the workmen, named John
Davis.</p>

<p>"Squire Parke's grand-daughter," he answered.
"It would be worth your while to walk into her
affections; but she don't look at carpenters, I tell
you."</p>

<p>"She looked at me," Jason said grandly.</p>

<p>"How could she help it?" replied John satirically;
"you have got such eyes!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she look at carpenters?" Jason
persisted.</p>

<p>"The Parke family are next to the Lord, in this
country, though it is not what it was once. One
of 'em knocked off his heel-tap on Plymouth Rock
the day the Pilgrims came ashore; one of 'em was
a governor; one of 'em settled here&mdash;cheated the
Indians, I guess, out of the pine woods that belong
still to the old Squire, and died universally
unlamented. I never heard any good of the name,
nor anything so very bad. There's a streak in the
family; one or two in every generation are all
streak&mdash;which means that they go to the devil. I
must say, though, that most people have a good
word for the old Squire; he ain't meddlesome. I
wonder what has come over this Sarah lately? I
see her about with folks, as if she was tired of being
by herself."</p>

<p>"The Parkes, I take it, have not understood the
correct balance between Man and Wealth."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they have, and have got all the wealth
from every man they ever had any dealings
with!"</p>

<p>"Such men delay the progress of social harmony."</p>

<p>"Speaking of harmony, will you go to the sing
to-night, with all hands? Miss Jane Moss, the
girl you pulled up from the pulpit just now, is the
head-singer in our choir. I sit behind her in the
gallery, and pass cloves and cardamom seeds over
to her every Sunday."</p>

<p>"What are you going to sing?"</p>

<p>"We are getting ready for the Dedication."</p>

<p>"If you will come round to the tavern for me,
I'll go."</p>

<p>John consented, and, at seven o' clock, made his
appearance dressed in his best, and found Jason in
his best also. But notwithstanding the change of
clothes, there was a strong piney odor about them;
also a dryness of complexion, a roughness of hair
and whiskers, and a cracked condition of the
hand, which suggested beams, boards, and shavings.
Jason had been nicknamed "The Lath." The
physiognomy of "The Lath" promised to be interesting,
if the soul should ever awaken; eyes of
light blue, fringed with thick black lashes, now
somewhat vague and wandering, would then flash
with conquering power, or diffuse tender, appealing
rays. At present, Jason was not handsome;
neither was there fascination in his bearing, attitudes,
gestures, or speech.</p>

<p>He did not confess on his way to the singing-meeting
that he knew nothing of music, but when
he arrived took a seat among the singers, and turned
the leaves of  his  music-book at the proper instant.
Opposite him, in the place of honor, sat Jane Moss
and Sarah Parke; he soon discovered that Sarah
was no more of a singer than himself, though her
lips moved, and her eyes followed the notes. She
looked at him in the middle of a prolonged "Amen,"
and perceived that he understood the sham; and
turned her head away to conceal a smile, turned
back again, and learned, as the choir burst out
again, that he was an accomplice in her fraud.</p>

<p>John Davis informed him, when the meeting
broke up, that he had about made up his mind to
ask Jane Moss if he might escort her home, though
he didn't know but that it would make her mad.</p>

<p>"Go in," said Jason; "I'll support you."</p>

<p>John, with a stiff "Good-evening," thrust his
elbow out before Jane, and she condescendingly
placed her hand inside it. A moment after, Jason
was introduced to Sarah, shook hands with her
modestly, and walked beside her without attempting
conversation; he waited for her to address
him. His deportment was so unexceptionable, that
when he left her at her door, she expressed a hope
of meeting him again.</p>

<p>It was known in Crest soon after that Jason
visited at Squire Parke's. Then it was rumored
that he spent whole evenings there, playing backgammon
with Sarah, or whist with the Squire.
And finally the town was surprised to hear that
Jason and Sarah were to be married. It charitably
said that she must be bewitched to marry a poor
carpenter, and that he knew which side his bread
was buttered on, but that he might not find it so
pleasant to get up in the world after all. It was
not allowed to be present at the marriage ceremony,
which was performed one evening in the Squire's
west parlor. Two persons besides the minister were
present; the Squire and Elsa Bowen, the housekeeper.
The next morning Jason took his place at
the breakfast-table, as an inmate of the family.
The household consisted now of six persons: the
Squire, Sarah, his grand-daughter, Elsa Bowen,
a middle-aged woman who had lived with the second
wife of the Squire for years, as housekeeper, friend, and
fourth cousin, a hired man, "Cuth," who had
been in the Squire's employ from a boy, a youth
named Gilbert, and Jason himself.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>SQUIRE PARKE had had two wives and two
children. They were dead. His first wife
gave birth to a son in the second year of his marriage,
and died shortly afterwards. In a year from
the time of her death he married another wife, who
bore him a daughter, and lived till three years before
Jason's arrival in Crest. The son and daughter
by the different wives grew up, married, and died,
each leaving a child, a boy and a girl, to the care of
their grandfather, the Squire. The girl had just
become Sarah Auster, and the boy, Osmond Luce,
was in parts unknown. As soon as his grandmother
was buried he announced his determination to leave
home, and although the Squire cried and reproached
him for being like his uncle, Sarah's father, who
had deserted home years ago, Osmond persisted in
his resolution. He must have freedom, he said;
he had paid his respects to the family myths long
enough, and he would transfer the duty to Sarah,
who believed in them, and whose authority with
them would more than compensate for the loss of
himself.</p>

<p>"You think so?" queried Elsa Bowen, who was
present when he opened the subject.</p>

<p>Osmond gave a look which silenced her, till the
Squire rose, struck his cane on the floor, and with
an emphatic "Go," left the room; then she burst out
with "You'd better try your luck with Sarah;
she won't take it so easy."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are on hand to do up the croaking,
Elsa."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will find me here, and at it, after many
a long year of your devil's wanderings. What do
you suppose became of your Uncle Osmond?"</p>

<p>"His bones are whitening in the caverns of the
deep."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Osmond rumpled his hair irritably. "I will go
to her with my quills up like a porcupine," he said.
"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"It will be more like if you go as a weasel. I
shan't tell you where she is."</p>

<p>He knew better than Elsa how Sarah would take
the news of his departure, but he carried them to
her with a reckless audacity that would have
silenced any ordinary opposition. But Sarah was
not an ordinary person; a conflict took place which
left both torn, bleeding, breathless; in one sense,
however, he was the conqueror, for he went away in
spite of it. The Squire sent him out in a vessel
loaded with merchandise for some southern port;
the cargo was sold, and Osmond, taking the proceeds,
left the port to go further south. Nothing
had been heard of him since the vessel returned.
For a time the Squire spoke of him as one not far
away; then Elsa noticed that he began to relate
the anecdotes she had heard him repeat in connection
with his own son, Osmond Parke, confounding
them with the childhood of Osmond Luce; in her
mind it was a sign that the old man had given him
up, and that he was as good as buried. In Sarah's
mind his image was not confused. As a banner
floats in the wind, he was ever floating before her
mental vision, with his flitting expressions of wrath,
mirth, and recklessness; but she never spoke of
him. Once Elsa went to a chest where some of his
clothes were packed, to see if they were damp;
dampness, according to a superstition in Crest,
being the proof of a seafaring man's death by drowning.
When she declared that they were as dry as a
bone, Sarah looked agitated, and begged her never
to speak of them again.</p>

<p>When Sarah's child was born, she spoke of Osmond
for the first time to Jason, as a half-cousin,
who bore no resemblance in character or looks to
herself. He was the only one, she said, who had
any claim on her grandfather's property, that might
ever trouble them. She doubted whether he would
ever come back, for the Parkes who had deserted
Crest never returned. There was a hectic flush on
her high cheek-bones after this conversation, but
Jason did not observe it.</p>

<p>She named her boy "Parke." He was a Parke,
every inch of him, she remarked to Jason, and
asked him to notice how much his hands were
shaped like her grandfather's. She might have
added that they were like Osmond's, too. Jason
looked at his own hands instead, and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Do you consider yourself a Parke?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am like my mother," she answered sharply.</p>

<p>Jason examined her face as if he intended to
make a study of race, and then looked at the baby
experimentally.</p>

<p>"What does the Squire think of him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What you do, I suppose."</p>

<p>The thump of a cane was heard, and Sarah
said, "Here he comes, you can ask him."</p>

<p>But he only smiled when the Squire entered and
stood by the cradle, and before he spoke Jason was
gone.</p>

<p>If Sarah had been imaginative she might have
mused on the picture before her&mdash;baby Parke,
aged three weeks, and the Squire, eighty-four
years. As she was not, she inquired which bin in
the cellar Cuth had put the potatoes in.</p>

<p>"Yah, yah, Sally; whatever bin Cuth has put
the potatoes is the right one."</p>

<p>"Grandpa, Cuth does what he likes with you."</p>

<p>"So, give me a coal, Sally."</p>

<p>She held one in the tongs for him to light his
pipe, and then moved her chair near him. His
face was never so pleasant as when he was smoking,
and she loved to look at it. He scattered
ashes over his double-breasted waistcoat, and
sparks dropped on his pantaloons, but she did not
venture to brush them off, because it would have
annoyed him. The serenity of his mien, the result
of a wonderful selfishness, was always her envy and
admiration. She thought him one of the best
men in the world, because he generally allowed
people their own way&mdash;provided their way did not
cross his. He was an amiable host to all the virtues,
but he never sought their society.</p>

<p>"When are you going to comb my hair again?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Grandpa, hasn't Elsa combed it?"</p>

<p>"Elsa has been like a gale of wind in the house
since you have been shut up."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you check her?"</p>

<p>"I should, if I had been too much in the draft."</p>

<p>She combed his long silvery locks till she was
ready to faint with fatigue, and till Parke woke up
with a cry. When he was hushed the old man fell
asleep in his chair, and his slumber was quiet,
dreamless, and deep as the child's beside him.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Jason saw Sarah's executive ability as
the mistress and manager of her grandfather's
establishment, in doors and out, and comprehended
the absolute position of the Squire, he
felt the impotence of his crude ideas, and his individual
isolation. Nothing practical could be done
in the way of equal rights with the Squire's garden,
orchard, woodland, mills, houses, and ships, presided
over and governed by the arbitrary wills of
such a man and such a woman. The prestige of possession
dazzled his view of the tenth point of
the law, and he fell down among the "nine-holes"
of the game, which is an inscrutable one to those
who do not hold a hand in it. He did therefore
what most men do, when suddenly ushered from
one sphere to another&mdash;ruled his actions according
to the circumstances he was placed in. Now and
then he made use of the phrases which belonged
to his smoldered theories. When Sarah requested
him to give up his trade, he replied that it was
better to be a carpenter than to live by the extortions
of commerce, or an undue proportion of land;
whereat she laughed so loud he discovered that
some of her teeth were as sharp-pointed as needles,
and that they gave her a tigerish look. His connection
simply with the Squire permitted him to
make up his own hand in the game he thought he
despised. Contracts were obtained on the
strength of it which brought him money, and at
the end of three years he was the owner of several
stores and houses, planned by himself, which paid
a better rent than any of the Squire's buildings.
In the beginning of his enterprises he seemed the
same to his acquaintances. They joked with him,
and laughed at him; but the jokes grew few, and
the laughs faint. Finally no one ventured to be
familiar with him, except John Davis, who was now
married to Jane Moss.</p>

<p>From the day that Jason entered the family he
suffered from an intangible something in the
Squire's bearing which deprived him of his natural
demeanor, and made him feel, by contrast, unfinished,
awkward, incapable. Whatever the influence
was, he succumbed to it, and its effect lasted long;
in fact, the Squire was the first potter that kneaded
Jason's clay.</p>

<p>The fourth year of his marriage came, and the
Squire still lived; he went his daily rounds over his
possessions in his chaise, accompanied by Cuth,
smoked, dozed, played with little Parke, and listened
affably to all Sarah had to say. It was the
calmest, most satisfying period of his life; Jason
was no trouble to her, no inconvenience to the
Squire, and not an object of interest to his boy,
beyond the knowledge that he was to be called
"father."</p>

<p>The thread of the Squire's life, strong as it
seemed, snapped suddenly at last. In the early
morning of an autumn day, Sarah, always up
betimes, heard a strange babbling noise as she
passed his door. She opened it, and went to his
bedside, and saw that the "Shadow feared of
man" had come.</p>

<p>"Grandpa," she whispered, terror-struck.</p>

<p>He knew her, and with one trembling hand&mdash;the
other was paralyzed&mdash;drew her face against his, and
vainly tried to speak. His tongue was paralyzed
also; tears burst from his dim eyes&mdash;the only
speech that was left him&mdash;and they wrung her to
the soul. She released herself and ran to the
kitchen&mdash;Elsa was not yet down-stairs&mdash;then to
the barnyard for Cuth.</p>

<p>"My soul," said Cuth, rising from his milking-pail,
when he saw her flying towards him, "what
is it?"</p>

<p>"He is going, Cuth; run for the doctor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Auster?" stammered Cuth.</p>

<p>"Grandpa," she shrieked.</p>

<p>"It can't be; I've known him forty year. But I'll go. What do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"It is death."</p>

<p>Cuth shook his head, as he started on a swinging
trot, and said to himself, "Numb palsy&mdash;I give him
up." He stopped every person he met, without
stopping himself, to say that the Squire had had a
shock, and before Jason heard of it, it was spread
through the town.</p>

<p>When Sarah went back, Elsa was busy making a
fire.</p>

<p>"What upon earth ails you, Sarah Auster?" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sarah took her by the hand, and led her into the Squire's
bedroom, and Elsa understood all.</p>

<p>"He'll last over to-day," she said presently;
"see how well he breathes."</p>

<p>Sarah dropped on the floor beside him, and
buried her face in the bedclothes. He began to
babble again. Elsa slipped out and went up to
Jason's room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Auster," she said, putting her head in at
the door, "the Squire is struck with death."</p>

<p>"Death," he muttered, starting from a sound sleep.</p>

<p>"Easy though, almost as easy as your nap. The
neighbors will be flocking in now. Can you dress
Parke? I've got to go right down again, and
Sarah won't think of any thing, except her grandfather."</p>

<p>"What are the neighbors coming in for?"</p>

<p>"Don't be droll," she said, closing the door.</p>

<p>Jason dressed, and sat down by Parke's crib. He
softly touched his beautiful hair, and put his finger
inside his little hand, which closed upon it with a
clinging grasp. He counted the network of delicate
veins in his fair temples, and watched the tranquil
motion of his white bosom. Then carefully covering
him, he went down to the kitchen. The outside
doors were already open, and people were
lingering about and talking to each other in subdued
voices.</p>

<p>"The doctor has come," said Elsa, motioning
him toward the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Gilbert," said Jason, giving his first order, "go
up-stairs and watch Parke."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be done," he heard the doctor
say as he entered the bedroom. Sarah's eyes were
fixed on the Squire's face, and she made no reply
to him.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Auster," he continued, testily;
"would you never be willing to part with him?"</p>

<p>"Sarah," said Jason, in a firm voice that compelled
her attention, "your grandfather is leaving
life without suffering."</p>

<p>"He is going out like a candle," added the
doctor, pinching his fingers together as if they were
snuffers.</p>

<p>"No link now," she muttered; "and where is
the other end of the chain, grandpa?"</p>

<p>The doctor rasped his chin, and looked at Jason,
who wore a stolid expression.</p>

<p>"Come, Sarah," called Elsa, "come to breakfast,
do. There's no use in putting off meals; they will
come round, and they must be eaten. Come, now;
the neighbors are here longing to do something for
you."</p>

<p>"Come," said Jason, raising her from her knees.</p>

<p>As she turned he met her eyes; there was a wild
look in them, which stirred his pity. He made a
motion as if to put his arm round her, but she
glided by him, and went over to the table alone.
When she returned, Jason went up-stairs to release
Gilbert. Parke was awake, and in high glee.</p>

<p>"Go away, father Jason," he screamed, "and let
me dress myself."</p>

<p>"Be good, for grandpa is sick."</p>

<p>"Then I am sick," he replied, getting into his
crib again, and shutting his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know that there are lots of people downstairs?"</p>

<p>"No," Parke answered, hopping out on one foot.
"Tell me about it, and you may dress me. But you
can't wash my face; if lots of people are here, I
won't stop to have my face washed."</p>

<p>After he was dressed, he insisted on being taken
down-stairs on Jason's shoulder, and having his
breakfast handed up to him on his perch, and tried
to balance his plate on Jason's head.</p>

<p>"Where's my mother?" he asked; "there hasn't anybody kissed me yet."</p>

<p>"Go to her," said his father; "she is in the bedroom."</p>

<p>Sarah heard the patter of his feet, and rose
to lead him to the bed. "Poor grandpa," she
said.</p>

<p>"He isn't poor," said Parke. "Why don't he
get up?"</p>

<p>The chintz bed-curtains, on which was printed a
fox-chase, in red and white, attracted him, as they
had done a hundred times. He put his hand to his
mouth, and tooted in imitation of the huntsmen,
and cried "gee-up" to the galloping horses.
The Squire began to babble at the sound of his
voice, which made him turn away frightened, and
beg his mother to let him go.</p>

<p>"Will you kiss grandpa once more?"</p>

<p>"No, not now, but to-morrow."</p>

<p>She put him down outside the door, and he ran
back to Jason, who amused him all day by whittling
boats, animals, and uncouth toys, with which
they played together.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Elsa, who was by no means
melancholy, "how little that child realizes what is
going on."</p>

<p>Jason smiled.  Would you have him howl?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't he ought to have a realizing sense of
death?"</p>

<p>"Never, if possible."</p>

<p>At dusk the doctor pronounced the Squire's
life to be ebbing fast; he would go before morning.
Elsa immediately went all over the house and
changed the order of the furniture. The chairs
were placed in rows, and all small articles were
moved into the closets. It was the third time, she
soliloquized, that she had shoved things about for
a funeral since she had been in the house; the
first happened ten years ago, and was that of
Sarah's mother, the wife of Osmond Parke, and if
ever there was a creature ready to go, she was.
"I ain't so mad," concluded Elsa, "as I was then.
It did me good to hustle the furniture round, and
wish it was that villain Osmond Parke, who was
alive somewhere, we thought; though we hadn't
seen him for years." Having finished her work,
she closed the shutters on the front of the house,
and opened wide all the doors. "If his old spirit,"&mdash;she
muttered, meaning the Squire's,&mdash;"wants to take a turn,
to see if things are according to his
ideas, he is welcome to do so." She then retired
in a peaceful frame of mind, after having read
some passages in the Bible, which reminded her of
the vanity of the world, and contained the text,
"What profit hath a man of all his labor which he
taketh under the sun?"</p>

<p>Cuth remained in the kitchen as a watcher; Jason
took care of Parke, up-stairs, and Sarah stayed
alone with the Squire. She was tormented by
irrelevant thoughts, which she constantly checked
by a strained attention to his breath, which grew
more and more difficult.</p>

<p>About four o' clock, he spoke clearly, but hurriedly,
and without a motion, these words:</p>

<p>"It all comes to this, Sarah."</p>

<p>She bent over him, and he was dead.</p>

<p>For an instant, while she looked upon the calm
face, from which Life had fled, and Death assumed
its mask, she felt as if her soul was poised on the
wings of the spirit going heavenward. It was the
first and the last sublime moment of her life.</p>

<p>Suddenly she recollected that there were no more
Parkes, and she felt a pang because she was a
woman, and had been obliged to change her name.</p>

<p>"It comes to this," she repeated, "either way."
She called softly to Cuth, and told him that it was
over.</p>

<p>"I know it, marm, I know it," he answered.
"Give me your hand." He shook it, patted her
shoulder, and continued: "Go to your bed, marm;
I've known him forty year, and I've a right to get
him ready, and stay by him; and I am a-going to."</p>

<p>She yielded the wish.</p>

<p>The funeral took place in three days, in the forenoon.
People came from far and near to see the
burial of the last of his name. Cuth took a solemn
pleasure in the occasion; he crammed the horses
that brought the funeral guests with oats, and
cursed Gilbert's mischief in exceeding the order
he gave him to mark the carriages and harness,
with their owners' names upon them in chalk.
The spectators of the long funeral procession
had the gratification of knowing that
"Capt. Smith, A 1,"  rode in one of the carriages,
and "Mr. Brown, B 2," in another, and so on through the line.
Elsa in a lustrous black silk and blonde cap poured
numberless cups of tea and coffee that day, and cut
many slices of ham and loaf-cake. It was late in
the afternoon before the house was emptied of visitors,
and then a dreadful blank was felt which
neither Jason nor Sarah could endure. She
wrapped Parke in a shawl, and took him into the
garden. Behind it, and beyond the orchard, a hill
rose, whose side towards the town was shaded by
a few tawny crooked cedars, and whose top was
covered by a small grove of oaks and a brushy
heap of rocks. Parke begged to go up there, and
she carried him in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, the red water!" he cried, as she placed
him on a rock, "and the red sky, mother. God is
burning up, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"It is only the sunset, Parke," and she began to
cry as she had not cried since the Squire died.
She was unmindful of the beautiful bay, whose
wide limits could be seen from the hill-top, of the
splendid western sky, of the red harvest moon rising
in the gray east, of the swallows circling round
the hill, of the faint columns of smoke ascending
from the chimneys of the town&mdash;unmindful even of
Parke, who, regardless of her weeping, slipped
down from the rock, and played among the fallen
leaves. A cool wind came moaning round them,
and the sky darkened; he began to count the
stars, there were not so many of them as there
were tears on his mother's handkerchief. She
wiped her eyes, caught him up, and said they must
go back to supper. Elsa had it ready. Extra
lamps were lighted and set on the table. There
should be, she said, no gloomy corners that night
for Sarah's eyes to wander in. She wished, though,
that she had made Mrs. Rogers stay; she might
have occupied that empty chair, and once occupied,
its being set against the wall afterwards
would not be noticed. Jason had not yet come in,
but she insisted on serving tea; he could have his
at any hour; he wouldn't remark whether it was
cold or hot. She seemed to be over and in every
dish, with a comfortable bustle which exhilarated
Parke and soothed Sarah.</p>

<p>Jason was plodding the beach which skirted the
south part of the town. As he watched the heaving
waters creeping towards him in the moonlight,
a thought of the Eternity which was eternally
creeping towards men came to him.</p>

<p>"By my soul," he said, "it is beautiful, though."</p>

<p>He threw a pebble into the sea.</p>

<p>"As easy as that, a man sinks there. But if
there is light, motion, color as there is here, I shall
like Eternity."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Squire left no will. Sarah informed Jason
of the fact when she felt obliged to call upon
him for aid; until she did he asked no question concerning
the property,&mdash;then he assumed the whole
control of it. He was months in mastering its
details. There were no debts, but it was widely
scattered, and existed in a variety of forms; that
part of it situated in Crest was the least productive,
and therefore he sold it. This was considered as a
thorough break-up in the town of the family interest,
and Sarah winced more than once at his innovations;
but believing in his plain sense, and that he was
probably considering Parke's future, she compelled
herself not to interfere. When he laid the schedule
of what he had retained before her, and the amount
of her income, derived principally from the ironworks
at Copford, ten miles below Crest, and the
tanyard at Millville, six miles above, she was astonished.
It amounted to nine thousand a year.</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty thousand dollars!" she
exclaimed. "Just enough."</p>

<p>"The Squire did not know how much he was
worth. I have sold all the shipping interest in
Crest,&mdash;all the houses. You only own certain tracts
of land here, which will be worth more by-and-by.
You have fifty thousand dollars in money."</p>

<p>"I don't recollect of any Parke's having so much
before. Of course, it will go to my Parke?"</p>

<p>She looked anxiously at him.</p>

<p>"Certainly, as it appears now, it is <i>all</i> yours, and
his. How much shall I pay you for my board?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense."</p>

<p>"I have a few hundreds, what shall I do with
them?"</p>

<p>She blushed, because she wished Parke and herself
to owe him nothing.</p>

<p>"You will accept my labor, but not my money?"</p>

<p>"You are my husband."</p>

<p>"Because I have given you an heir?"</p>

<p>"If you wish to be odd, Jason, I cannot prevent
it."</p>

<p>"Your heir, not mine."</p>

<p>"By the name of Auster."</p>

The expression with which she uttered the name
made him turn white. From that time he was proud
enough never to interpose his paternal feelings between
her and his child. Instead, therefore, of his
being a bond of unity, he was the means of an
anomalous condition, which is not supposed to exist
between man and wife, where there are children.</p>

<p>To all appearance the family flourished and were
happy. But one day, the day that Parke was nine
years old, Sarah beheld, "sitting at the king's
gate," her cousin and co-heir, Osmond Luce, who
had been absent twelve years. He was not alone;
a strange-looking little girl came with him&mdash;named
Philippa.</p>

<p>Day to be remembered in the annals of Sarah's
experiences&mdash;as well remembered as the day he left
his grandfather's house!</p>

<p>"Of course," were his first words, "I am foolish
in expecting to see my grandfather."</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand from his grasp, and
mechanically resumed her seat; her mouth moved
as if she was in a spasm.</p>

<p>"He is dead," he continued.</p>

<p>"Five years ago," she made out to say.</p>

<p>"And I have been as good as dead twelve years."</p>

<p>"No, not as good," she said, the lustre of her
black eyes returning.</p>

<p>"Ha, I recognize my native air."</p>

<p>"He died without a thought of you; he had
forgotten you, I believe, and forgotten all your claims."</p>

<p>"So much the better for him. Sarah, Sarah, I
have come thousands of miles with this girl,&mdash;she
is mine,&mdash;to leave her on ancestral ground. Her
mother is dead. Will you keep her?"</p>

<p>"Papa," interposed Philippa, "will you allow me
to go about this funny house?"</p>

<p>"Go anywhere," he said, and opened the door
for her.</p>

<p>Philippa immediately mounted the wide stairs,
and tried to open the door of the great clock, which
stood on the landing in the middle of the flight.</p>

<p>"Take care," cried a voice above her, "the pigeon
may fly out."</p>

<p>"What boy are you?" she asked, stretching her
slender neck to get a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me? I am Parke; this house
is mine."</p>

<p>"I have come to live in it."</p>

<p>He descended slowly, looking intently at her.</p>

<p>When he stood beside her, she said, "Tell
me about the pigeon."</p>

<p>"I will; but I don't think you are handsome."</p>

<p>"You are, indeed, you are."</p>

<p>They sat down on the stair in front of the clock,
and after taking in his hands her braids of hair, and
saying how yellow they were, he told her that one
day, when the clock was open, and Elsa was going
to wind it, a pigeon flew in from the window into
the clock, and that it still lived there.</p>

<p>"That is all nonsense," she commented.</p>

<p>"It makes a noise before the clock strikes, and I
say it is there."</p>

<p>"What does it get to eat?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then it starved to death long ago," she said
triumphantly. "Why don't you have it stuffed?
I've got a stuffed macaw."</p>

<p>"You'd better go home," Parke said.</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Must you stay?"</p>

<p>"We came with such big trunks; the coachman
said 'By vum,' when he put them by the gate."</p>

<p>"Let us go and see them."</p>

<p>They hopped out amicably, and Jason found
them on the top of one deep in conversation when
he came home to supper.</p>

<p>"What little girl is this?" he asked kindly.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask," Parke answered, "but she has
come to stay."</p>

<p>"You had better go in; it is growing chilly."</p>

<p>"If I choose to go in, I shall," replied Parke in
the mildest, most indifferent of voices. Philippa
looked at them both in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I will go with you, sir," she said, offering her
hand.</p>

<p>Parke followed them at once to the parlor. It
was dark there, and perhaps Jason did not see
Sarah's compressed lips, nor the red spot on her
cheeks; but he divined who the stranger was
before she introduced him.</p>

<p>"I am the prodigal son, Mr. Auster," he said;
"but you won't trouble yourself about the fatted
calf."</p>

<p>"No trouble," replied Jason, "it is the time of year for veal."<p>

<p>He said this so seriously, that Osmond looked at
him attentively.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Parke, "this little girl flew in as
the pigeon did, but we must feed her."</p>

<p>"Yes, or she will starve," she said, with a harsh
attempt at pleasantry which made Jason feel as if a
grater had passed over his nerves. "And I must
attend to the supper, as Elsa will go into a tantrum
now."</p>

<p>She went to her room first, however, and looked
at herself in the glass.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see how changed I am," she said with a
touch of womanly regret; "how unbecoming light
dresses are to me. I should be dressed in mourning;
yes, yes, in black from head to foot. What has he
got a child for? How can I bear it? And it has
not come into Jason's head, how much poorer we
are than we were this morning!"</p>

<p>"What a handsome boy!" exclaimed Osmond, as
soon as the door had closed on her. "Come here,
you rascal."</p>

<p>"I do not think that I am a rascal," answered
Parke; "but here I am."</p>

<p>He climbed up on Osmond's knee, and looked
him frankly in the face. They were of the same
race. Osmond, though sunburnt, hardened, coarse,
stamped with lines that spoke a wasting history,
bore a wonderful resemblance to the boy.</p>

<p>"And his name," said Jason, "is Parke."</p>

<p>Osmond looked at him again closely.</p>

<p>"Where could Sarah have picked up that man?"
he thought.</p>

<p>"I like you," Parke declared, satisfied with his
inspection.</p>

<p>Osmond kissed him twice, and smiled for the first
time since he entered the house.</p>

<p>Jason was looking at Philippa. When her father
kissed Parke, she moved her eyes as if seeking to
escape something painful. Jason went to her
quietly, removed her bonnet, unpinned her brightly-flowered
shawl whose deep fringe had trailed in the
dirt, and placed her upon the sofa.</p>

<p>"I came here to stay once too," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Cuth and Elsa," said Osmond, starting up&mdash;"I
must see them, the old souls. I know where
they are."</p>

<p>He banged the door behind him, and
passed through the rooms whistling a lively air.</p>

<p>"That whistle," said Jason to himself, "is a wind
of doctrine."</p>

<p>"The Everlasting!" screamed Elsa, when Osmond
found her, "I knew you would come back.
Now we are in a mux. Our folks will show their
gift of gab."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I am going again."</p>

<p>"What did Sarah say, Osmond? You have seen
her."</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Blood may be thicker than water, and it may
not; <i>I</i> ain't any judge." And then she sobbed.</p>

<p>"What has happened in the last dozen years?
Tell me, old girl," he demanded, carefully wiping
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Haven't had any news since Mr. Auster came
to town, and the Squire died, till this very minute."</p>

<p>"I did not expect his death&mdash;he was so hale&mdash;and
the Parkes live long, you know."</p>

<p>"You did not expect to find Sarah married,
either."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I am glad she is married, though," she continued,
with a wrathful look. "You are as much
like Satan as ever."</p>

<p>"You are not glad, and as for Satan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If here ain't Osmond Luce!" she cried, for
Sarah came in with a jar of preserves. "I thought
I should have fainted when I saw him."</p>

<p>"Elsa is the same, Osmond," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Not a day older. She is a system of wires made
of steel, and won't rust. Where is Cuth? Shall I
find him in the yard?" Elsa caught him, to pick
some threads from his coat, and then she brushed it.</p>

<p>"Where's your baggage?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In the parlor, talking with Cousin Jason."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord! You haven't come with a wife?"</p>

<p>"Ask Sarah," and he rushed out.</p>

<p>"He has brought his daughter to live with us."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, what an imbezzlement! But she has a
right here&mdash;no mistake in it, and I'll see to her."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"How he favors the Parkes! He wants the Parke
money, I suppose."</p>

<p>Sarah's eyes flashed, and her shining black
ringlets set up a dance round her forehead.</p>

<p>"Nothing like family affection. Oh pest and
the deuce take this teapot nose, it is choked with
tea-grounds," continued Elsa, not appearing to
notice Sarah, who said, after a moment's silence,
putting the jar on the table with a hand which Elsa
saw was trembling,</p>

<p>"These grapes are for tea."</p>

<p>"The fathers haven't eaten the grapes this
time," said Elsa,  turning the jar round in her hands,
after Sarah had gone, "to set the children's teeth
on edge. Sarah has got fangs, fangs, I tell you,"
tapping the jar sharply; "and yet she remembers
that Osmond liked grape preserves!"</p>

<p>Cuth was at the wood-pile. Osmond went up
behind him, and said, "Old Cuth, how are
you?"</p>

<p>For a moment Cuth did not stir; then he turned,
and said, "Curse you, if you would go, why didn't
you stay? What are you here for?"</p>

<p>"Your blessing, Cuth."</p>

<p>"You had that, you dog, along with the Squire's."</p>

<p>Osmond offered him some plug tobacco, which
he seized, threw into his mouth, and seated himself
on a log.</p>

<p>"You've come for something," he said, spitting
furiously.</p>

<p>"For half of this wood-pile, and half of you,
Cuth."</p>

<p>Cuth growled, spit high in the air, and swore a
deep oath.</p>

<p>"What has Auster done?" Osmond asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"What you would never have done, if you had
stayed here a hundred years. How have you
passed your time?"</p>

<p>"In riotous living, Cuth."</p>

<p>"Well, Auster has passed his in no living at all.
Tell me some of your adventures," and Cuth's
shaggy eyebrows lifted themselves above a savage
sparkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you been in the Spanish main?"</p>

<p>Osmond laughed so loud, that Cuth, disconcerted,
turned to the wood-pile, and began to lay
the sticks upon it with careful precision.</p>

<p>"I always thought you were mad, Cuth, and now
I know it. How have your passions stood this sort
of thing so long?"</p>

<p>"The Squire pared my heels, and pared my toes,
and cut out my tongue, and I loved him."</p>

<p>"Ah, I never could do as he did."</p>

<p>"In a measure, you are stormy though, raging
and raving, as you always were, I take it; by my
own mind just now, I take it so."</p>

<p>"Cuth," said Osmond absently, "I have brought
my daughter here. Do you think that the paring-the-heels-and-toes
system died with my grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Why, have ye now, Osmond? Well, I like that.
The child is here, hey? Sarah Parke is sharp, but
she don't bind folks to her; and she is too likely a
woman to be afraid of&mdash;or&mdash;to be, to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Loved," added Osmond.</p>

<p>Before he was called to supper, Cuth had given
him so much information concerning Jason and the
life of the family, that there was little left for him
to learn.</p>

<p>The taste of the grapes to Osmond was the link
between what seemed to be two dreams; that of
having been in Crest, a boy, and the one of being
there now, a man. A wild feeling of loss and
homesickness swept over him, and then, like a ship
in a rough sea, whose prow rises to meet the
breakers, he overrode the feeling with a determined
will. Sarah watched him with a restless, furtive
eye, which betrayed to him her unquiet soul.</p>

<p>"Not one of you has asked how long I intend to
stay!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The bread on the way to Philippa's mouth was
arrested. A loaf of cake was near Jason's hand;
he cut it in two with one blow and offered the
plate to Osmond.</p>

<p>"Elsa," he said, with a smile, and taking a bit,
"I never thought you would have allegorical cake.
Will you share in it, Sarah?"</p>

<p>She understood it, and, with a bitter look at
Jason, answered, "Not just now."</p>

<p>"None of your foreign lingo here," cried Elsa;
"I'll warrant you haven't tasted such cake since
you left."</p>

<p>"None like this, so sweet, so good," said Osmond
in a deep voice, and, with a gesture towards
Jason, "has been offered me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Philippa would like some," said
Sarah; "she has your taste, Osmond, undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she would," he cried, a light coming
into his face, "perhaps she would; 'I thank thee,
Jew.'"</p>

<p>But Philippa declined the cake, and patiently resumed
her bread. She was accustomed to her
father's vagaries; Elsa seemed to recall them too,
and asked him if he was as fond of his "reading
books" as he used to be.</p>

<p>Jason proposed cigars after supper, and he, with
Osmond, started on a walk.</p>

<p>"Philippa is an outlandish name," said Sarah,
still at the table. "How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Ten years."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to be contented here?"</p>

<p>Philippa shrugged her shoulders, and fixed her
brown eyes upon Sarah, who could not repress a
thrill of irritation.</p>

<p>"Philippa, Ippa, Ippa, Philippa," Parke sang.</p>

<p>"Parke," ordered Sarah, "go to bed."</p>

<p>"Not yet," continuing his song, "Ippa, Ippa, I
must nip her."</p>

<p>"Ippa," smiled, and pushing from her ear her
yellow curls, offered it to him. "You may nip it
if you like."</p>

<p>"I am going to play with you for a while," he
said, accepting her offer; "but you must play as
I say."</p>

<p>"Go into the kitchen, then," Sarah begged.</p>

<p>"Along with you," said Elsa.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, and Jason and Osmond
did not return. Sarah was curious enough to
muffle herself in a shawl, and dash on to Jason's
office down the street to see if there was a light
there. The rays of a lamp streamed from a hole
in the paper window-curtain; she hesitated a moment,
then went forward and looked through it.
Jason was smoking a short clay pipe. His hat was
pushed back from his forehead, and he was tilting
on two legs of his chair; now and then with a
ruler he struck at and turned over the pages of a
ledger, which was on the desk before him. His
appearance fascinated her, so much depended with
him, if he but willed so! While she devoured his
face, attitude, motions, she was gauging the depth
of his moral nature. "We never know what we are
till we are tried," she reasoned for him, in her mad
hope that his conscience was solving a problem
which could not trouble hers. "We can't make
nice distinctions always. What is duty in such a
case? Haven't we every right to what we have so
long cared for, and he neglected? <i>I</i> would punish
him." Osmond, who was beyond her vision,
spoke; she could not hear what he said, but
she saw a frank smile spread over Jason's countenance.</p>

<p>"I might have known," she thought, "that Osmond
would strike at the heart of the business at
once; and I am a fool to have dreamed that he
would not turn Jason round his little finger."</p>

<p>She would not let her anger admit that his honesty
was proof against any temptation, or rather,
that temptation could never approach him. She
turned away with a step that stirred the gravel on
the walk, and made Osmond listen.</p>

<p>"Somebody going by," remarked Jason, observing
his attention.</p>

<p>The front door was ajar, as she had left it, and
she believed that she had not been missed. Parke
had gone to bed, probably, under Elsa's supervision;
the house was too still for him to be awake.
But the girl!&mdash;no arrangement had been made for
her. It struck her, then, that she would rather have
Philippa under her eye, as a hostage. Osmond
might not cut and thrust so liberally, with his plans
and wishes, so long as she should remain in Crest.</p>

<p>"Well," said Elsa, "I have waited to hear where
Philippa is to be put, till her eyes are glued
together with sleep."</p>

<p>"Keep her with you to-night."</p>

<p>"She has a kind of way of saying prayers. I
suppose she thought she wasn't going to bed, and
that she had better mum 'em in her chair, and sleep
there. She ain't one bit like her father. I believe
she is a Roman Catholic myself."</p>

<p>"Don't notice it, Elsa, if she is; she won't be
one long with me."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Elsa, abruptly. "At
it, I conclude."</p>

<p>"No matter where they are," Sarah replied, with
a stamp of her foot.</p>

<p>Elsa slammed the door for a retort, and vanished.</p>

<p>Jason lit the lamp in his office, exchanged a little
commonplace talk with Osmond, and then became
silent.</p>

<p>Osmond lit another cigar, which he took from a
Manilla case, and asked, "How much was the old
man worth?"</p>

<p>"His estate is now worth a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I had no idea of so much."</p>

<p>"I have bettered it, since I took it in my hands."</p>

<p>"You might have cheated me like the devil."</p>

<p>Jason tapped a row of books in his desk.</p>

<p>"Sarah has supposed you would not return; I
thought you might. Look at these."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that my half is ready?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I might have been a magnate here, if my grandfather
had not treated me as a boy," said Osmond
irrelevantly, for Jason had so astonished him that
he hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>"You were a boy when you left him," said
Jason, gently. "<i>I</i> was a man when I entered
the family, and yet he never trusted anything
to me."</p>

<p>"I vow to God, if it were not for Philippa, I
would give you every dollar that may be mine;
then"&mdash;he stopped, for something in Jason's face
struck him. "Sarah would not have it so," he
resumed. "She must have Nemesis, though."</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"A relation of the owner of that sword which
was suspended by a hair over the head of one of
the ancients."</p>

<p>"Cut it," said Jason, looking up as if he saw the
sword in the air.</p>

<p>"I decided to-night to renounce my claim here,
and give Philippa all my rights; having done this,
I shall cut my stick; did you mean that? Will
you be her guardian?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why did you bring her here?"</p>

<p>"From mixed motives. I will confide to you,
however, that she is an obstacle in my way of life,
and that I have never felt a strong interest in her.
I have studied out the means of happiness for her
notwithstanding. She will be happy here; hers
is no Southern nature; she belongs to the North."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jason, thoughtfully, "she is one of
the family."</p>

<p>"And will hold her own sooner or later. I shall
plant a few ideas in her brain which will take root,
and in time bear fruit."</p>

<p>"There will be nothing for me to do."</p>

<p>"Who knows how much? I should have made
a different arrangement, had I found you a different
man. Excuse me, I shall not find a man I
dare be so frank with again;&mdash;how came you and
Sarah to marry?"</p>

<p>Jason turned white, and looked up into the air
again.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it, and let you know," he
answered presently.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jason, you are a trump. Now about
your fees, or your salary, or salvage, or commission,
whatever you may please to call the emolument of
guardianship."</p>

<p>The preliminaries were settled in a moment, and
Osmond proposed a walk round the town. His
memory was still green, he said, as they passed
through the silent streets, and he recounted boyish
episodes, which let Jason into the secret of his
character. The story of his later life was also told,
and his listener heard an experience, so different
from his own, related as a matter of course in the
history of men's lives, that he felt his past had
been but a sleep-walking. Osmond's tongue was
like a wedge, hard, insinuating, forcible; in spite
of Jason's impassibility it made its cleaving way
into undisturbed recesses, which being once invaded
might prove him a man like other men.</p>

<p>Osmond remained a few days only. He made
what he called the hereditary tour,&mdash;that of the
old burying-ground, and a few visits to his grandfather's
friends, but renewed none of his own early
associations. He could not escape, however, the
spirit of the past which Sarah evoked for him. The
fire burned on the same altar which he refused to
sacrifice upon years ago, where he might have
flung himself and been consumed. Hatred and love
were equally probable passions between such
temperaments, and equally fatal. Her manner was
so stinging, so bitter and excited towards him, his
so cool, daring, watchful, and resolute towards her,
that they were obliged to be only mindful of each
other; even Philippa, who might have been tossed
from one to the other, like a bone between hungry
dogs, was neglected. Jason had given her an
account of his business interview with Osmond,
but she made no comments upon it, either to him
or to Osmond. There was a squareness in Jason's
way of setting forth facts which made her distrust
her influence with him. Osmond was satisfied that
she had at once acquiesced in Jason's guardianship,
and so Philippa was ignored. The day he left he
was closeted with her for a long time; she
shed no tears when he departed, but Parke cried in
his arms, and begged him, with kisses, to come
again. Osmond promised, with a significant look
at Sarah, to be with them in ten years, for by that
time there would be questions to ask which he
would be old enough to answer. He demanded of
Cuth and Elsa that they should live till then, and
rode away with a careless ease which made Sarah
grind her teeth and Jason smile.</p>

<p>"He sows to the wind," said Elsa, "and always
will."</p>

<p>"And we reap the whirlwind," said Sarah, looking
at Philippa.</p>

<p>"The wind don't blow," cried Parke, looking out
of the window.</p>

<p>"I wish it did," said Philippa, whistling, as she
had heard the sailors whistle at sea; "I wish a
hurricane would come this way."</p>

<p>If the faculty to detect the principle which
directs the march of circumstances had been given
to Jason, it is probable that his history would be
impossible; he would have rendered it nugatory
from the moment that Osmond Luce returned to
Crest.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>JUST before Osmond's visit, Jason, at Sarah's
request, drew a plan for the alteration and improvement
of the old house; she approved it, and
he made a contract with John Davis to do the
work. But after Osmond's departure she informed
Jason that she had changed her mind, and thought
the house was well enough as it was. He insisted
that the contract must be fulfilled, and for the first
time there was a positive disagreement between
them; but he carried the point, and the workmen
commenced operations.</p>

<p>The old ceilings, the old partitions, and the old
windows were removed, and the foundation raised,
in order to make a terrace in front for shrubs and
flowers, and a flight of granite steps. The house
was so changed that nothing reminded the family
of its previous shape, except the wainscoting in the
west parlor, and the broad brick hearth in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Thankful to the Lord for these remnants,"
Elsa exclaimed, who partook of Sarah's ill-humor
without knowing why. Jason tried to console her
by promising that the yard below the terrace
should not be touched.</p>

<p>"As if any thing could be done here with hammer
and chisel," she said, scornfully. "I'd like
to see John Parke's row of balsam-firs cut down."</p>

<p>"Why did he plant one row to the east, and
none elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"To make it lonesome, and shut out the houses
down the street, I imagine. I have heard he was
half crazy; but he was the only one of the family
who ever planted trees. When I used to say to the
Squire that he'd better plant some, he'd answer
that he should not live to enjoy their shade, and
would not do it."</p>

<p>While the confusion and disorder of rebuilding
lasted Jason and the children were companions.
He resumed chisel and plane with an avidity which
attracted Parke, and sent him to his mother to ask
if his father were a real carpenter. Philippa
learned the fact through John Davis; she overheard
him say that he thought it a pity so good a
workman as Jason should be spoiled, all for the
sake of the very institutions he had once gone
against; he could see, though, that a man in the
downs had better try the ups of life, before he
decided that high and low were only empty names.
Philippa silently wondered at what she had heard,
and was so watchful of Jason at his work, that he
could not help, at last, being watchful of her in
return. One day, when Parke, tired of the shavings,
the blocks, and the racket, had gone to ride
with Sarah, Jason broke the silence which had
been maintained between Philippa and himself.
He was planing a long board, and she was walking
behind him, picking up the best curled shavings.
He looked back and said, "You are my ward; if
you want any thing you must ask me for it."</p>

<p>She dropped her apronful of shavings and
answered, "My father told me that I was your
ward; but he said that I was not to ask for anything
till I grew up. Do you think I am growing?"</p>

<p>He turned entirely round, looked at her, took a
measuring-rule, and, kneeling before her, measured
her length.</p>

<p>"Not a mite," he answered, seriously; "but we
will keep account hereafter of your inches. At
present you are a very small girl indeed."</p>

<p>"And ugly, too."</p>

<p>"Who said so?"</p>

<p>"Parke. Can you make him ashamed for saying
so?"</p>

<p>The question made him reflect on the influence
his non-interference with Parke might have, and
how much it might affect his guardianship, and he
instantly determined to exercise no authority with
her beyond the management of her money; there
should be no difference shown by him in his treatment
of the children. The price of existence with
the Parkes must be an eternal silence.</p>

<p>He threw down the rule with a slight laugh,
took up his plane, and while feeling its edge said,
"Little boys of nine forget politeness now and
then; he won't say it again."</p>

<p>"But it was true"</p>

<p>"Why should he be ashamed of speaking the
truth, then?"</p>

<p>"I thought you might know he said so, and not
let him hurt me."</p>

<p>"I only know how to drive the plane, the hammer,
and the saw,&mdash;my brothers."</p>

<p>"Then you are not spoiled," she said, remembering
John Davis's remarks.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," he answered, wondering
what she meant, but not choosing to ask,
for he thought he had said enough.</p>

<p>The summer was ended before the house was
done. Jason made over the premises to Sarah,
but from some unaccountable whim she refused to
buy any thing new. The old furniture was put in
the new rooms, and the old aspect was renewed as
much as possible. Then she took Philippa in hand
to train: all the indulgences that she lacked at
Philippa's age, Philippa was to lack; she should be
taught to be useful, not to enjoy herself after any
fashion of her own. What had been right for herself,
Sarah said, must be right for Philippa, whether
it suited or not.</p>

<p>"The times," remonstrated Elsa, with whom she
discussed the subject, "are different from what
they were when you were a child; besides, you
must call to mind that she has got an independent
fortune; you hadn't, you know."</p>

<p>She was not to be spoiled on that account, Sarah
replied, and money or no money, she must be
taught the sense of duty, and the practice of it.
So Philippa went through a course of dish towel
hemming, patchwork, fine stitching, knitting, muslin
work, counting spoons and linen, setting the
table and clearing it, keeping chairs at the right
angles, airing rooms, closets, clothes, and furniture,
and taking care of her own room, all of which was
intensely disagreeable to her. She was sent to
school regularly, and made to give Saturday afternoon
entertainments to her schoolmates, and return
their visits, which was never a source of enjoyment.
In short, she was confined to a system as
rigid as that of the penitentiary, with one exception&mdash;liberty
to associate with Parke, and share his
pleasures as he saw fit. To give Sarah her due,
she was just towards Philippa in all that pertained
to her material welfare; her health was guarded,
she was not subjected to fatigue and exposure&mdash;her
associations were limited to the orthodox
standard, and she was one of the family. But
Philippa never exposed to her the tumults of childhood,
its fears, its doubts, hopes and wishes. Except
for a demeanor which indicated a persistent
will, and the display of a peculiar frankness when
pushed too hard, she appeared to be a docile child;
not particularly pleasing or interesting, but quiet
and self-contained. The most noticeable fact in
her biography for several years was a fever, which
attacked her every summer, and left her gaunt and
sallow for months after. And although Sarah
watched and tended her in these illnesses, and
fretted over them, she never remembered being
kissed or smiled upon, or having her hand pressed
with an affectionate grasp. Sarah hated her.
Was it because of her hate that she allowed herself
no escape from the performance of every external
duty? Or did she believe that it was the spirit,
not the letter, which killed? Could she have
washed her hands of Philippa's life and rights,
would she have done so? Or would she, from some
strange necessity in her nature, still prefer to keep
her as her familiar demon?</p>

<p>The reflection of Parke's serene, joyous life
spread over Philippa's, and prevented her from
being miserable. At once he had engaged her
affection, and her devotion to him was as unqualified
as his mother's. He was beautiful; his
temper was perfect, and his manners were winning.
As he grew older, the mould of his childish character
enlarged, but did not change. His good-humor,
his facility to discover means of enjoyment,
his perpetual, pleasant, gentle activity, were delightful.
His atmosphere kindled all who entered
it into brightness, and created a desire to shine as
he would shine. He loved truth, was devoid of
suspicion, and took it for granted that men and
women were what they appeared to be. Fact held
the place in his nature which depth occupied in
Jason's, and a becoming way of self-gratification
contrasted with Sarah's abnegation of pleasure.
He had a cool head, a cooler heart, but a tender
disposition, and with all these traits lay hidden in
his soul the capacity for a terrible abandonment to
the passions.</p>

<p>In the course of time it began to be observed by
Jason's business acquaintances that he entered into
no speculations, and made no contracts. They
said among themselves that he must be intending
to retire, and live upon his income, which was
rated as very large. They could not guess, of
course, the truth. He decided that for himself the
little he had made since his marriage was enough,
and that he would not risk again either Parke's
or Philippa's money. He was determined that
when they came of age their incomes should be
equal. There never should be an issue regarding
the Squire's property, as far as he was concerned;
if it depreciated naturally, the heirs must bear the
loss equally. Whether he had a troubled, mist-like
vision in his mind respecting Sarah, if any question
of loss should come up between them; or whether
he had as dim a remembrance of his socialistic
principles; whatever the cause, he carried out his
plan with the tenacity of a man who has but one
idea at a time, and so tied up the property beyond
his control, that, morally speaking, he was able to
consider himself as outside of the family. From
this time of mental independence the habits of his
life changed. In order to continue his out-of-door
life he took up gunning and fishing, and spent days
in the woods, and days on the sea, but he rarely
brought home any game or fish. With his dogs he
beat the dense oak and pine woods which bordered
Crest, and acquired an occult love for every tree
he passed under. In his two-masted, sharp-hulled
boat, he coasted the shores of the bay, or pushed
out beyond the islands across its mouth, and
followed the trackless paths of ships that went
down the great deep, and the sea became one of
his deities.</p>

<p>The onus of bringing up the children, of sustaining
their position, and the claims of society, he
left to Sarah, who bore the burden becomingly.
She was a friend to the poor and the aged, because
it was the custom of the family, and she continued
the time-honored gifts of salves, cordials, and food
for the sick. She was a good member of the upper
class, for she dressed handsomely, entertained
handsomely, and was never inconveniently intimate
with it. Without a profound comprehension of
the spiritual, devoid of pious aspirations, she was
a believer in the tenets of the Congregational
Church, and had joined it a year before her marriage.
She was full of the business of religion,
and ministers were under her especial patronage.
With all her prestige, all her influence, she was not
loved abroad, nor envied; her want of softness,
her shrill laugh, her cold words, the restless expression
in her black eyes and thin lips, and her
repellant manner, made people afraid of her.</p>

<p>The years advanced through Parke and Philippa's
childhood, and brought Sarah and Jason to the
borders of middle age with a monotony which concealed
the swiftness of their flight, and kept in
check the prescience of change and loss.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>"THE snow-flowers shake with the cold," said
Elsa, "and the apple-blossoms are all of
a didder this afternoon. It's more like fall
than spring, and here we are on the edge of summer."</p>

<p>"Have you been out?" inquired Sarah, looking
at her watch.</p>

<p>"I've taken the round of the fences for the first
time this year. I tell you that Cuth is failing; he
don't attend to the garden as he used to."</p>

<p>"Don't you perceive that we are all growing
old?" Sarah asked maliciously, but Elsa turned
the subject.</p>

<p>"Philippa will be in by six, won't she?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And walk down from the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; only it seemed to me, as she has
been gone two years, somebody might have waited
upon her for once."</p>

<p>"We might have had an oration, and banners,
beer and gingerbread, if you had spoken in time.
At all events, you could have asked Cuth to put
the horse in the chaise, and drive up for her. Gilbert
must be sent up with the wagon for her baggage."</p>

<p>"I should have thought that Mr. Auster would
have staid at home to-day."</p>

<p>"He forgot that she was coming, I dare say,
though her bills only came in yesterday&mdash;heavy
ones, too; but I trust that the boarding-school
business is over now."</p>

<p>"She would go, you remember, as soon as Parke
left for college; of all the grit I ever saw, she was
the grittiest. When you told her that it was folly
for her to think of going, she surprised me even.
Are Parke's bills heavy, too?"</p>

<p>Sarah looked at Elsa with a dark face, for it
seemed as if she were trying to exasperate her;
but the old woman's countenance was imperturbable;
her round cheeks, rosy as winter apples, glistened
provokingly. Sarah could have snapped her
fingers against them with pleasure, or scratched the
smooth, glassy enamel of her shining eyes, that
were made to penetrate, not to be penetrated.</p>

<p>"A man's bills are different," Sarah answered
calmly, for after all she loved Elsa.</p>

<p>"A man! what business has he to play the man?
I could trot him on my knee this minute."</p>

<p>"You have done so often enough when he was
a troublesome child."</p>

<p>"I have; I never begrudged my time, when I
took care of him. Well, he has grown up worth
looking at. Would you like some toast, Sarah?
You are not very well?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am; but I do not object to toast."</p>

<p>Elsa proposed attending to it immediately, but
instead of going to the kitchen, she went to the
back-stairs where she had deposited a branch of
apple-blossoms, carried it to Philippa's chamber,
and put it in a mug of old transparent china decorated
with a theatrical shepherdess in a curled
wig. Stepping back to observe its effect, she mentally
remarked that it was nine years ago this very
month since Philippa came to Crest, and that time
had not changed Sarah for the better. Time, she
supposed, brought healing on his wings; it was
not so always, for something dropped from them
like corrosive sublimate in its effect, when he
passed over certain heads. Crossing the room on
tiptoe, as if she saw and avoided those venomous
fallen drops, she opened the blind of a western
window, and looked out. No sunbeam streamed
past her; but the light of a purple sky broke along
the dark walls. The woods, which circled half the
west, were still piebald with the hues of a late
spring&mdash;pale green, brown, and dingy red, and
vast purple clouds, furrowed like the sea before
the town, hung over the house.</p>

<p>"If I should die the death of the righteous,"
she muttered, "I could not say that I thought this
weather was what the Lord ought to send. It
gives me the creeps."</p>

<p>She turned from the window without observing
Philippa, who was walking toward the house, in a
green shawl which brought her in strong relief
against the slaty sky. Her own window was
scanned first, and then she looked at the front
door, but it was closed; no one was awaiting her.
As she entered the hall, leisurely untying her bonnet,
Sarah, who heard her footsteps, dropped her
work and rose to meet her with an extended hand.
Philippa took it, and an automatic movement
passed between them, which was, in meaning, a
chapter in the biography of their relationship.</p>

<p>"Why, Philippa!" said Sarah, with a smile
which did not unclose her lips, "you have grown
a head taller. Your dresses must be all too short."</p>

<p>Philippa tossed her foot out from the edge of
her skirt, and said: "I crouch when it is necessary.
Are you well, Cousin Sarah Auster? Where
is Jason? When did you hear from Parke? How
is Elsa?"</p>

<p>Elsa rushed in, crying: "Good-for-nothing girl,
you might have come home before. <i>I</i> wanted you.
You be a little better looking; hope you have got
over being yellow; guess you have at last. How
are you? I am not fit for much this spring. I'll
take your things. Gilbert has gone for your
trunks. Gilbert's wife has got a baby. She asked
me if she might name it Philippa; I told her she
had better name it Gilippa&mdash;you could make it a
present any way&mdash;and she was mad with me.
You've got on your old black silk, haven't you? it
is tattered and torn. Did you know that we had
a new minister, all shaven and shorn? You are
eighteen now. Your father will be thirty-eight
next month, won't he, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your tongue, Elsa?"
she asked; "I am too confused with it to answer
your questions."</p>

<p>"Elsa, you are the only handsome old woman I
have seen since I left you," said Philippa. "I am
glad to be where you are."</p>

<p>"Questions and all, hey? But here is Mr.
Auster."</p>

<p>"So you came, Philippa," said Jason, "before I
could beat up the harbor. I expected to be at the
d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for you."</p>

<p>She advanced to shake hands with him, but he
looked so awkward when she reached him, that she
was sorry she had made the attempt. Still she felt
that his manner was not unfriendly. He made
an effort to converse with her, but it was an
evident relief to him when Elsa summoned them
to tea.</p>

<p>When Philippa's trunks arrived, she went to her
chamber and commenced unpacking. An hour
after she was interrupted by Sarah, who came to say
that there was company at Mrs. Rogers's that evening,
and to inquire whether she would go for a
while.</p>

<p>"It is too late to dress, and I am shabby any
way," she answered.</p>

<p>"Our new minister will be there. Everybody will
be asking about you, and Mrs. Rogers will feel hurt
if you refuse to go to her house."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will go then to her."</p>

<p>"Shake out those dresses, and let me see the
condition they are in."</p>

<p>Philippa complied, and Sarah gave them a close
examination, and accused her of carelessness and
extravagance, and begged to know if it was impossible
for her to be a credit to the family.</p>

<p>"Credit!" echoed Philippa, "I don't like that
word, and do not mean that it shall be used, as far
as relates to me. As for carelessness, to please
you, I'll amend; as for extravagance, I have absolute
faith in my own money."</p>

<p>"Did you learn that at school?"</p>

<p>"From one of the family preceptors&mdash;my father,
Osmond Luce. I only mention my faith in self-defence."</p>

<p>Sarah threw down the dress she had in her hand,
and left the chamber. Meeting Jason in the hall,
she said, excitedly, "We have hatched a cockatrice."</p>

<p>"We! Who?"</p>

<p>"Philippa."</p>

<p>Jason changed his mind about going out, and returned
to the parlor, where he took a chair and
ruminated. When Philippa came in, ready for the
party, he raised his eyes and scrutinized her sharply,
and found himself wondering whether all cockatrices
had pale yellow hair that looked as if about to float
into the air like the down of flowers. There
was something strange in those speckled eyes,
though!</p>

<p>She wondered what he was so abstractedly staring
at.</p>

<p>"Are you a cockatrice?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>Sarah opened the door, ready also, and Philippa
turned a grave look towards her, with an expression
which conveyed to him that she knew the source he
had derived his question from.</p>

<p>"What now?" asked Sarah, contemptuously.
"What makes you theatrical?"</p>

<p>"Are you a cockatrice?" Jason repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Philippa, "I am."</p>

<p>The cold sea-wind blew round them as they
walked down the street, leaving Jason still in the
parlor. The monotonous fall of the waves on the
rocky beach in the distance sounded in Philippa's
ears like the old march to which she had stepped
through life beside Sarah. When they reached the
row of weeping-willows before Mrs. Rogers's door,
she said:</p>

<p>"Why put ideas in Jason's head that belong to
you, Sarah?"</p>

<p>Sarah made no reply.</p>

<p>"Tell me, upon your honor," and Philippa
stopped here, "whether my father was guilty of any
fraud or act which should deprive him or myself of
our rights?"</p>

<p>"Let go my shawl, Philippa Luce; your father
must answer for himself, and so shall you."</p>

<p>"Once for all, Cousin Sarah, give me the information
I ask for, or I shall compel Jason to give
it to me."</p>

<p>"Have you got a pistol about you," sneered Sarah,
"to enforce your demand?"</p>

<p>Philippa gently shook the shawl in her grasp, but
Sarah felt as if she was in a vice of steel. She
thought of a diversion&mdash;a piece of cunning&mdash;which
was effectual.</p>

<p>"If Parke saw you, your hand would fall paralyzed.
Philippa, let go the shawl."</p>

<p>"You are right," she replied. "But I know what
you only could say because you refuse to speak.
I am satisfied concerning my father."</p>

<p>Sarah gave a loud knock on the door, which
brought Mrs. Rogers immediately.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come right in? I am no hand
at ceremony, you know. Is this Philippa? How
do you do, my dear? Welcome home. Take off
your things, and walk in the parlor. The company
are all here."</p>

<p>She untied Philippa's bonnet and smoothed her
hair.</p>

<p>"Pretty enough," she said, "but you don't favor
your father a bit."</p>

<p>"How is Sam?" Philippa asked, smiling brightly,
for her heart was warmed by Mrs. Rogers's cordial
welcome.</p>

<p>"Sam's to sea; I guess he'll be gladder than
ever to get home. You are his favorite, you
know."</p>

<p>"I shall visit you often till he comes."</p>

<p>"So do; I am a lonesome old thing. Parke used
to come, especially when Sam was here, and I miss
him too."</p>

<p>She led the way, and at the parlor door introduced,
in a loud voice, "Mrs. Auster, and Philippa Luce,
just come home." There was a general movement,
as if a new and unexpected element was admitted,
which subsiding, the conversation began again, but
with a forced tone, as if the talkers felt a critic had
arrived. But Mrs. Rogers, to whom "kings and
potentates," to use her own expression, "were no
more than just so many worms," broke the chill,
with her loud, cheerful voice and comfortable
manner, by saying, "We were just talking, Mrs.
Auster, about having the pulpit new covered&mdash;the
old red velvet is in rags, for it has not been changed
since the meeting-house was built&mdash;and what color
we should have. I am in favor of green, on account
of its being a good color for weak eyes, you know."</p>

<p>Sarah looked towards a young man of composed
mien, who was twisting his watch-key, and smiled
when she met his eye. When an opportunity occurred,
he took a seat beside her, and asked if she
believed that "a minister had the rights of a man."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ritchings must remember," she answered,
"that Mrs. Rogers was something of a fool, though
a good-natured one, and that she had endeavored to
adapt her conversation to the taste of the company,
which consisted of the members of the church."</p>

<p>He sighed, and with an eye wandering in Philippa's
direction, said, "They make me tired of it sometimes.
Is that your ward, Miss Luce?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"She has a remarkable face."</p>

<p>"I never thought so," and Sarah glanced towards
her. "But perhaps she has a peculiar expression.
What did you think of Deacon Blair's party?"</p>

<p>"It was just like this. Introduce me to Miss
Luce, will you&mdash;if I may ask the favor?"</p>

<p>She beckoned to Philippa, who was obliged to
betray the shortness of her dress, for there was a
great space in the middle of the room to cross, but
betrayed no confusion. She bowed coolly, and took
the chair which he offered her. He blushed as he
asked her some trivial question about coming home,
and Sarah felt annoyed.</p>

<p>"Plum, pound, and sponge," interrupted Mrs.
Rogers, presenting a piled-up plate of cake.
"Philippa, you know what my cake is. I'll warrant
you did not get better at boarding-school."</p>

<p>"I did not, indeed," she answered, taking a large
piece.</p>

<p>"Ministers," Mrs. Rogers continued, "are fondest
of plum-cake."</p>

<p>"How much should a young one eat?" Mr.
Ritchings asked.</p>

<p>"You can eat as much of <i>my</i> cake as you please,
for it is made wholesome."</p>

<p>Sarah joined another group, while Mr. Ritchings
and Philippa were deciding on the merits of the cake,
but she could not help looking in that direction
occasionally. A thought that Philippa might be
considered attractive presented itself to her unwilling
mind, and she passed an involuntary criticism
on her. It was beyond her power to analyze the
character of Philippa's face, but she made a disparaging
inventory of its features. Her wide forehead,
eyebrows so arched and far apart, her pale
brown eyes, her curved solid chin, her thin lips,
could not be called beautiful, certainly; but Mr.
Ritchings at the same time came to a different conclusion.
In his opinion, those vermilion lips were
like the delicate, flaming leaves of some tropical
flower, and her beautiful yellow hair reminded him
of the plumage of a tropical bird; but her clear,
cold eyes were like the tinted iceberg, which rides
towards its fall in the summer sea. He was amazed
that so slight a creature, half-grown, apparently,
could appear so dignified, so unimpressed; yet
there was a carelessness in her manner that
amounted to audacity. She was unconscious
of his scrutiny, and not only ate her own
cake, but part of his, taking it from his plate in
pinches.</p>

<p>Somebody said that it rained, and everybody
started up to go. Jason arrived with umbrellas and
overshoes, and staid in the entry till Sarah came
out of the parlor. He had a moment's affable
sparring with Mrs. Rogers, however, on the matter
of his never coming before folks, his not doing the
good his position required of him, and his being
poor company for his wife.</p>

<p>He waved her off with a laugh, and beckoned
Philippa to hurry, but still he was obliged to wait
on the shell-paved walk while Sarah exchanged a
few words with Mr. Ritchings.</p>

<p>"Are you going to be fond of ministers, Philippa?"
he asked. "They take up a great deal of
time."</p>

<p>"Not if they are over-pious."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>EITHER the rain chilled Philippa, or her reception
at home, for she began to feel ill in a few
days after her return. Shading her eyes from the
light she crept listlessly from room to room, disinclined
to speak, eat, or sleep. Elsa declaring that
she was as yellow as saffron, thought her suffering
from one of her old attacks, but the doctor pronounced
her case one of fever, and on the ninth day
she was delirious.</p>

<p>Elsa denied her delirium&mdash;said that she was light-headed
for the want of sleep, and confused with
the doctor's nasty drugs; but one night, while sitting
by her bed, she changed her mind.</p>

<p>Philippa raised her little hand with an appealing
look, and said, "Don't bring apple-blossoms; pull
me some magnolias, mammy."</p>

<p>"I'll bring 'em in this minute, Philly, if you will
be quiet," Elsa answered, her heart in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Where's my rosary, Philip? I have not had it
since yesterday."</p>

<p>She slipped out of bed, shook the pillows, threw
the contents of her work-box on the floor, while
Elsa stood aghast and unprepared.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, Philly dear," she said,
desperately, "that you are not a Roman Catholic
now, and that you don't need your rosary?"</p>

<p>"My rosary," cried Philippa in a rage, "find it,
or I'll flog you till the blood runs. Gloria Patri&mdash;that
ends it."</p>

<p>And she began to strike on the door with her
clinched hand, crying louder and louder, "My
rosary!"</p>

<p>Sarah heard the noise and ran up-stairs; Philippa's
countenance changed when she saw her.</p>

<p>"You have hid it," she said doggedly, "and unless
you produce it I will kill myself."</p>

<p>"For the Lord's sake, Sarah, get her the beads,
if they are in the land of the living."</p>

<p>"The rosary, Mrs. Auster, if you please," said
Philippa; "look in the depths of your conscience
for it."</p>

<p>"I'll go for it," Sarah replied mildly, and whispered
to Elsa that she had no idea where the thing
was; but it was found, and Philippa consented to
go back to bed.</p>

<p>The delirium ended in a stupor. The doctor
said that her hair must be shorn, and Jason was
called to assist in the operation; he caught the
tresses as they fell, and looked upon them as one
might look upon a friend for the last time; tears
dropped from his eyes which he was not aware of,
till Sarah told him that if he was going to be
overcome by a handful of hair, he would not be of
much use in the sick-room.</p>

<p>While she lay in stupor, Cuth was seized with a
mortal illness, which compelled Jason to watch over
him. His time had come, Cuth said; he knew it,
because tobacco did not taste good any longer.
He begged Jason to bury him without having any
palavering, and to have his coffin carried out at the
back door; in consideration of having these requests
fulfilled, he made a will in Jason's favor, for he had
a thousand dollars in money, and a thousand dollars
in land. If it was all the same to Mrs. Auster,
he would like to be buried in the Parke lot. Sarah
promised him that he should be laid in the desired
spot, and he died, silently and firmly, like a wolf.
The day of his funeral was the day, also, of
the funeral of Gilbert's child; when it was over, Mary,
his wife, came to assist Elsa, and remained in the
family from that time. The day she came Philippa's
doom was pronounced; a few hours more
would close the scene, the doctor informed Jason
and Sarah. Jason wrote to Parke to come home,
and then disappeared. Sarah, exhausted, went to
bed, leaving with Philippa Elsa, whose last office
seemed to be to moisten her poor lips. Jason returned
by sundown, and wandered through all the
chambers but the one Philippa was in. The doctor
came again, and went without a word. Towards
morning Philippa's breath was so far gone, that
Elsa bent over her to learn if it had not stopped
forever; but she opened her eyes wide, and said,
"Jason!"</p>

<p>Elsa called him. He came in and kneeled by the
bed.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Jason. Thank you. Kiss Parke,"
said Philippa, in a hoarse voice, and again closed
her eyes. He thought her dead; but Elsa sent for
the doctor, who said she had fallen into a natural
sleep; that it was possible she would not die after
all; though it would be curious if she did not, for
the consulting physician, Potter, had said there
was no hope, and his death-warrants have never
failed.</p>

<p>"Sarah Auster," exclaimed Elsa, breaking into
her room an hour or two after, "that poor creature
is going to live after all. Now I can turn the
world upside down with some heart. Come, the
table has been spread three days, and not cleared;
nobody has eaten any thing."</p>

<p>Sarah rose up in bed, with a clear perception of
not being rejoiced at Elsa's tidings. She must go
on with her task! Yawning, she asked if coffee
was made.</p>

<p>"Coffin, did you say?" Elsa retorted, purposely
misunderstanding her.</p>

<p>"Elsa, are you a fool? I said coffee."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I have made, mother-wort
tea? That is bitter, you know&mdash;as bitter as
gall and wormwood."</p>

<p>"Herb-tea and medicine will run in your head
for weeks. I am glad there will be an end to drugs.
Jason has been up all night, I suppose. I'll go up
and attend to Philippa; she must have something
to nourish her immediately."</p>

<p>Jason left the sick-room to her, sauntered into
the yard, and sat down on the steps of a shed.
His dogs, Ike and Jake, came and laid their noses
on his knee.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he repeated, pulling their ears.
"Thank you. Kiss Parke."</p>

<p>The dogs whimpered and beat the ground with
their tails, while he gazed abstractedly into their
eyes, which were limpid with love and hunger.
Elsa called him to breakfast, and they followed him
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"'Tis no matter for once," she said, more amicably
eying them, as they squatted beside him, than was
her wont. Sarah came in, and Jason involuntarily
looked at her for sympathy. She saw his agitation.</p>

<p>"Well," she remarked, "the siege is raised. You
have been anxious, Jason. Philippa rivals your
dogs&mdash;doesn't she? and they are jealous."</p>

<p>Elsa wished in her heart that they had Sarah between
their teeth, and shaking the devil out of her.
Jason tossed a mouthful to them and answered:
"Hardly, but I wished her to live."</p>

<p>"If the pains we have taken can prolong life, she
will outlive us all,"</p>

<p>"You have done your best, Sarah, that I know,
and so has Elsa. As for me, my mission as usual
has been&mdash;uselessness."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help doing my best," said Elsa.</p>

<p>Parke arrived the next day, with a pair of horses
that he had hired in the town where he found
he must wait for a train to Crest.</p>

<p>"How is she?" he asked; "where is she?"</p>

<p>"In her room," his mother answered, without
deranging herself. But Elsa took him by the hand,
and led him thither. He was so shocked at the
change in Philippa, that he could not speak. Her
languid eyes rested on his fresh, fair face, and
rivers of tears flowed from them; he was touched, and
wept with her, but he felt a painful physical
repugnance at the sight of her.</p>

<p>"There," said Elsa, with a slight sniff, "if you
are going to act so, you must go right away, Parke;
the time for crying has gone by!"</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you, Parke," said Philippa.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to find you sick. How you must
have suffered! But it is over now."</p>

<p>"Look at my hair."</p>

<p>"I don't see any."</p>

<p>"Your hair will grow out handsomer than ever
in no time," interrupted Elsa.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Parke. "I hope you will be
well immediately, for I do not mean to go next term.
I shall stay here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Parke, you must go through."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"There, there," Elsa broke in, "colleges or no
colleges, you must go down-stairs, Parke."</p>

<p>"Come up early to-morrow," Philippa begged,
"and tell me what you mean to do."</p>

<p>He promised, kissing his hand to her, and smiling
himself outside the door; but as soon as it was
shut, he shuddered.</p>

<p>"So Cuth is dead, Elsa? I thought he was good
for years yet."</p>

<p>"He was tough; but it is all the same to death&mdash;tough
and rough, tender and delicate, when he
appears with his broom, we are brushed off like so
much dust into a dust-pan."</p>

<p>"Poor Cuth! he belonged to us heart and soul."</p>

<p>"For good wages. Whether he belongs to the
Parkes in heaven, depends on what they can pay
there. Gilbert can take his place here very well,
but we must hire an additional man."</p>

<p>"We must, for I mean to have additional horses.
Where's mother? I want her."</p>

<p>"Now, Parke, don't pray keep us in hot water
about this college business; go back. Are you
going to turn out shiftless, like some of your
relatives?"</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth, Elsa; do you suppose that I
am not aware of my intentions, clearly and plainly?
I have stayed from home three years because I liked
it, not because I wanted to be fitted for college, or
to go through college. Old woman, I know when
I want a thing, and how I want it, better than anybody
else."</p>

<p>He spoke so pleasantly, and with such a lively air
of interest in the "thing" he wanted, that she began
to feel personally concerned in his obtaining it.
She said no more. His mother vehemently opposed
his remaining at home; it was not worthy of him to
leave a task unfinished; he would be accused of a
distaste for scholarship. She consulted Jason
even, but obtained no satisfaction. He replied,
that he did not believe in education; he was not
surprised at Parke's being weary of playing at
knowledge; he imagined that of the two sorts of
men&mdash;those who were taught by systems, and those
who made them&mdash;Parke would prefer the latter;
and that he would create one himself and bring
it to perfection&mdash;the art of amusement. And why
not?</p>

<p>In vain she urged Parke to return. He had
made up his mind, he said, to stay at home, and he
hoped that she would not find him disagreeable.</p>

<p>In his absence, he declared, the dust of antiquity
had gathered over the house; but it was blown
away before he had been there many days. A piano
came with his baggage, cases of books, pictures, and
numberless trifles. All outside of college life, Jason
observed to Sarah, and better established at Crest
than elsewhere. Parke was so occupied that he
only found time to visit Philippa a few moments each
day, but he said so much of his plans that he left
food for thought.</p>

<p>Until she was able to leave her room&mdash;and her
recovery was slow&mdash;Jason was assiduously attentive.
Her ugly, helpless convalescence removed his coldness
and shyness; but from the day she came down-stairs
he subsided so completely into his old self,
that the remembrance of his care and anxiety
merged into the dream her illness grew to be. Her
life was absorbed in Parke.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE name of Theresa Bond appeared often in the
reminiscences of Philippa's school life with
which she sometimes entertained Parke. When she
showed him the daguerreotype of her friend&mdash;a
splendidly handsome girl&mdash;he suggested that she
should be invited to Crest. Philippa wrote her accordingly,
and the invitation was accepted. She
arrived at the appointed day, and when Parke saw
her he was satisfied with the prospect her coming
offered; so was she. That day a summer rain fell
from morning till evening; it sheeted the windows
with mist, hummed against the doors, and smote the
roof with steady blows. Jason found sufficient
excuse in it for once to remain at home, for even he
felt a curiosity regarding the visitor; his way of
gratifying it entirely concealed his object. He
lounged in the distance, or, if he followed Parke,
Philippa, and Theresa from room to room, he
appeared to do so from an interest he took in the
books, engravings, and knick-knacks, which were
strewed everywhere.</p>

<p>It was a day to discuss character, Parke said,
and to make confessions; the afternoon was before
them where to choose. It was a wonderful spectacle
to Jason, when he beheld the ease and
adaptability of Parke's manner, while seated between
the girls on a sofa. Theresa chattered like a magpie
of her passionate likings, her venomous dislikings,
while Philippa's office was that of listener to both.
Occasionally Parke took her hand, carelessly patting
it, and dropping it forgetfully, as he appealed to her
to ratify his opinions. The effect he produced reacted
upon himself, and increased his amiable vivacity.
They were happy. That summer day might have
extended over a week, a month, a year, perhaps,
and his sense of enjoyment in this happiness have
lasted. Did he recall that when the Prince, hovering
over the lips of the Sleeping Beauty, kissed
them, the palace was disenchanted?</p>

<p>Theresa played a brilliant fantasia on the piano,
which made Jason's ears ring; he went to a window
remote from the piano, and through the streaming
pane saw a pair of robins, ruffled with the rain,
flying into the branches of a fir below the terrace,
and piping a song in its shelter which soothed him.
He looked towards Philippa, who had quietly gone
to the center-table, intent upon restoring it to order.
Parke stood beside Theresa, following her music
with the delight of an artist.</p>

<p>"You play and sing by ear, Philippa says; do try
something," she begged.</p>

<p>He complied, and sang a Polish melody, so
vivacious, yet so passionate and melancholy, that
she was electrified; even Philippa felt that he sang
with a new spirit. Sarah looked in the door, a linen
apron in her hand, and passed on, with a pleasant
picture in her mind. When Parke began to sing,
Jason moved from his place, near Philippa, and
asked her, in a low voice, if she understood that
outlandish music.</p>

<p>"No," she answered; "but I like it."</p>

<p>"There's a couple of robins outside doing quite
as well, in my way of thinking."</p>

<p>He then betook himself with his book to the paneled
parlor on the opposite side of the hall, but it
was not long before his solitude was invaded.
Theresa having revealed that one of her passions
was old annuals, they came in to look over the contents
of an ancient mahogany bookcase, whose
doors, covered with green silk, had not been opened
for a long time. "Gems" were disinterred from
the top shelves&mdash;"Friendship's Offerings" and
"Keepsakes," the New Year's gifts of Parke and
Philippa's childish days.</p>

<p>"These make me feel a boy again," said Parke,
"when life wasn't 'full of sunny years.'"</p>

<p>Why not? thought Philippa. But she, too, had
chronicles for those times.</p>

<p>"Some of the pictures are deliciously funny,"
said Theresa. "'Contemplation,' for instance.
How came you by such a lot?"</p>

<p>"New Year's presents," Parke replied. "How
many belong to you, Philippa?"</p>

<p>"Seven."</p>

<p>"Do you remember that Saturday night, when
mother came home from some journey, and brought
'Tales of the Revolution,' which we both began to
read Sunday morning, and that she took it from
you, and made you go to church? I stayed at
home, and finished it."</p>

<p>"Why did she do that?" Theresa asked. "Why
did she not make you go?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't she make me go, Philippa?" Parke
echoed.</p>

<p>Jason smiled faintly, and raised his eyes to
Theresa's face; he listened for Philippa's reply,
but she made none.</p>

<p>"Why didn't she?" Parke repeated, nipping
her ear. As Philippa continued dumb, Theresa
concluded to change the subject, and Parke forgot
his question. She plunged into the annuals
again, but Jason pondered over Philippa's silence.
As he thought of it he became conscious of feeling
worried, mystified, unsettled. Why was he so?
He would not be housed another day, believing
one such day as a thousand years. What did
that young lady remind him of? Ah, the tiger-lily
in the garden, which Ike had barked at the
day before! Books, music, fine talk, did not suit
him; they were for Parke, who became them so
well. Then his thoughts wandered to the day
when he thought Philippa was dying, and to the
words which he supposed her last. He rose involuntarily,
and stretched himself to his full height;
he was towering. Theresa's glance fell upon him
and rested there. Their eyes met, and Jason, returning
her glance with an honest, unabashed
gaze, stalked out, and she suddenly returned to a
style of coiffure in the portraits of "Beauty,"
and dragged Philippa away to experiment upon
it.</p>

<p>At tea-time they reappeared. Parke snapped
his fingers at Theresa, and whistled the Bolero.
Her glossy black hair, dressed in Spanish fashion,
fastened by a high-topped shell-comb, one of Sarah's
treasures&mdash;with a red rose on one side of her head,
and a black lace scarf on the other, brought out the
warmest tints of her dusky beauty. Philippa
looked strangely unlike herself; her short hair
clung round her head in a mass of ringlets&mdash;vivid
golden rings. A wide scarlet ribbon hung down
each side of her face, on the ends of which Theresa
had pinned bunches of delicate green leaves.
A large, loose cape of spotted white lace was adjusted
on her shoulders, like a robe, and  her  bare, slender
arms were decorated with bands of black velvet.
The impassive character of her chin and forehead
was brought out by this dress, and its violent contrast
of colors revealed the ivory tints of her complexion.</p>

<p>"She is hideous," said Parke.</p>

<p>"She is not," affirmed Theresa; "she is the
American Sphinx."</p>

<p>Sarah gave a shrill laugh; not that she comprehended
the allusion, but there seemed a fitness in
it which gratified her. Jason, in his place at the
tea-table, removed his eyes from the joint he was
carving, and said: "She is the Genius of the
Republic."</p>

<p>Philippa was profoundly indifferent to her appearance.
Never was creature more free from vanity.
She composedly ate her meat and drank her tea,
forgetting that she was <i>en costume</i>, except when
the ends of her wide head-dress flapped across her
mouth.</p>

<p>With the tea night came&mdash;a harder rain and
thicker mist. Theresa threw up a window, and
from habit, Sarah and Philippa, and even Parke,
drew back from the wind and mist which rushed
in, but she delighted in the atmosphere, and expressed
a desire for a walk. Jason instantly felt a
sentiment of respect for her: and in its blush suggested
"India-rubber boots."</p>

<p>The suggestion was exclaimed against, and Sarah
observed to him, that he need not suppose, because
he passed so much of his life in India-rubbers, that
anybody besides would fancy doing so.</p>

<p>"What do you do in them, Mr. Auster?" asked
Theresa.</p>

<p>Sarah hastened to reply for him: "He lives in
the woods&mdash;going through the ceremony of carrying
a gun&mdash;or, on the water, maneuvering with a
boat."</p>

<p>"Pleasing and harmless pursuits," added Jason,
with a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>"He has stayed at home one day, though,"
Parke remarked, "because something new has
happened."</p>

<p>"I am sure we have company enough for him to
remain with us, but he never does," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"None half so delightful as the present," said
Parke.</p>

<p>Theresa blushed beautifully.</p>

<p>The voice of the sea grew loud. Its yelp sounded
through the house, fell back baffled, and wailed
despairingly along the shore.</p>

<p>"The people don't appear to mind that mad music
outside," thought Theresa.</p>

<p>"Do shut that window, Miss Bond," entreated
Sarah, "the water is terrible to-night."</p>

<p>"You will take cold," said Philippa.</p>

<p>Theresa closed it, but remained with her face close
to the pane. A moment afterwards Parke stood
beside her.</p>

<p>"You think us insensible to the influences here,"
he said; "but you do not understand what a
perpetual struggle is going on between us and
the climate. The wind, fog, damp, and rain, frost
and ice, are the causes which compel us to combat
for business, pleasure, and repose&mdash;to say nothing
of health. For my part, I like to forget 'Nature,'
as I have to-day."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a merry, restless life which prevailed now.
Something new was taking place&mdash;a different
development&mdash;and all because Theresa Bond was
paying a visit of a few weeks to several people who
interested her. They were alive with life, and did
not know it&mdash;that was her opinion. A new brand
is sometimes wanted to kindle up the embers of a
smouldering fire, and this was the office she performed;
and then "all the winds of the world blew
up the flames."</p>

<p>The individual independence of the family first
struck her. Apparently no member of it involved
another in any pursuit, opinion, or interest, except
Parke, who involved Philippa. Elsa was the only
one able to spin the threads together on the family
distaff.  It could not have been so always. There
was an air of transmitted habit grafted on the ways
of the house, which proved its age and pride. This
accounted for various incongruities in their style
of living, which at first surprised the city-bred,
aristocratic Theresa. Sarah and Philippa were engaged
much of the time in house-work and sewing.
Philippa did what she had been accustomed to do
from a child, and Sarah assisted Elsa everywhere.
There was an utter absence of ceremony and display
at the table, and over the house. Parke
smoked and read the newspapers in the kitchen,
and Elsa shelled beans in the parlor. The errands
came in at the front door, and visitors at the back
door, whenever it suited the convenience of the respective
parties, and were entertained wherever they
were met. Yet the prestige which money gives was
not lacking.</p>

<p>In spite of their different idiosyncrasies, they were
much together, and all the rooms were occupied in
common. Jason was rarely at home, it is true, but
if there, he lounged about in his odd way, brooding
in a corner of the kitchen hearth, musing in the
parlor window, sitting on the door-step, or lying
among the bushes on the terrace.</p>

<p>Theresa had no key to the family history, except
the fact of Philippa's being a pupil at Madame
Mara's. That was a proof of means and respectability,
for Madame never admitted anybody without
these antecedents. Philippa was not communicative;
she was a mystery, and mystery piqued
Theresa. She made advances towards Philippa,
who responded, but in a provoking, reticent way.
A theory started itself in Theresa's mind, which she
imparted to her&mdash;that from the negation of her
character, and the utter absence of the dramatic in
her nature, a tragedy would one day come, fall on
her, and devour her, as the wolf devoured Red Riding
Hood. Philippa not only returned Theresa's
regard, but was grateful to her for aid extended in
various ways. Theresa was a fine scholar&mdash;an adept
in the art of dress, full of finesse. Philippa was
dull at her books, devoid of taste, and devoid of
tact. Theresa smoothed away her difficulties, attempted
to polish her, with a slight degree of success,
and learned to love her still more.</p>

<p>The friendly relation immediately established between
Theresa and her family so thawed Philippa's
silence, that when Theresa one day said, "Your
Cousin Jason is eccentric," she did not parry the
remark, but asked, "Because he is quiet?"</p>

<p>"Did you never notice him really?"</p>

<p>"I have not speculated on the point of eccentricity.
Why do you ask? You say I never
study those about me."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that he has not found his
vocation."</p>

<p>"He changed it. When he married Cousin
Sarah he was a carpenter."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Theresa, eying Philippa with a
one-sided glance, like that of a cunning bird, "you
are refreshing."</p>

<p>"Jason is my guardian you, know."</p>

<p>"Are you rich enough for one?"</p>

<p>"Parke and I both are rich. We inherit our
great-grandfather's property."</p>

<p>"That is when Jason has done with his share."</p>

<p>"Jason! he has nothing."</p>

<p>"Why not? Your Cousin Sarah comes into the
property before Parke, and what is hers is her husband's."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Philippa, seriously, "it was not
fixed so. Parke and I have it all&mdash;or will soon."</p>

<p>"Jason's position, then, is inferior to his wife's,
his son's, and yours?"</p>

<p>"I never thought it. What a way you have of
representing things!"</p>

<p>"I like him," exclaimed Theresa, after a pause;
"he is dignified and single-minded; but whether
he has much heart I have not yet learned."</p>

<p>It was evident to Philippa that Theresa was upon
one of her "clues."</p>

<p>"He is honest," she declared, after another
pause.</p>

<p>"What will you do with money? When are you
going to begin to spend it?"</p>

<p>"What would you do with it?"</p>

<p>"I would not be stingy."</p>

<p>"I dare say you will call <i>me</i> so; I rarely have
generous impulses. Parke is always giving. I
think I shall keep my money."</p>

<p>"You will save it for some spendthrift; then hey
for my tragedy. Property is always dispersed in
the course of a generation or two."</p>

<p>"My idea is consolidation."</p>

<p>"Jason would help you in that&mdash;nobody else."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" Philippa cried irritably.</p>

<p>"Would Parke? Would your relative Sarah?"</p>

<p>"I won't be dragged into one of your analytical
abysses, Theresa; so let me alone."</p>

<p>"For the present, then; but I shall not give you
up, since I have seen oysters in an aquarium."</p>

<p>Parke planned admirably for Theresa's amusement.
A saddle-horse arrived one day. She improvised
a habit and rode with him constantly;
they scoured the country, inspired with the hope of
picturesque discovery, leaving Philippa at home&mdash;with
her idea of consolidation, probably. They
described their tours with animation, and Jason, if
present, never failed to say that he and his dogs
had been on the same rounds; but to Philippa
their descriptions were novel, for she knew nothing
of the country.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take walks?" asked Sarah, when
she heard her say so.</p>

<p>"Why not try boating?" Jason asked, before
she could reply.</p>

<p>"Boating," exclaimed Theresa; "oh yes, why
hasn't it been thought of before?"</p>

<p>"I can not manage a boat," said Parke.</p>

<p>"Jason will go with you," said Sarah, graciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, once," he answered, roughly.</p>

<p>"Let us have a party, then," said Parke.
"Mother, will you go?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid of the water."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Philippa, Miss Bond, myself, and
father."</p>

<p>Jason remarked that Philippa was afraid of the
water, too, and he thought it likely Parke was: but
if he could rely on Miss Bond, sufficient courage
could be mustered for a short sail.</p>

<p>Sarah thought of Mr. Ritchings, and, without
consulting any one, sent him an invitation to join
the party. The next morning he made his appearance
without an overcoat, and in a suit of summer
clothes.</p>

<p>"The merciful man!" exclaimed Elsa, when she
saw him coming in at the gate. "Who asked him?"</p>

<p>"I did," Sarah said, in a serene voice.</p>

<p>"Let him go, Elsa," Jason laughed.</p>

<p>That morning there was a land breeze, the
waves ran from the shore, and the bay looked almost
smooth.</p>

<p>Philippa brought out cloaks and thick shawls,
and recommended a lashing down of hats and
bonnets.</p>

<p>"How comes she to know that it is blowing
outside?" Jason asked Elsa. "She never went
sailing."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you forget she made a voyage more
than eight years ago."</p>

<p>"True; why, she is a woman, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"If she isn't she never will be; the time will
come, before you know it, when she will be of age."</p>

<p>"All hands, ahoy," called Sarah, moving down
the walk beside Mr. Ritchings, and accompanied
by Gilbert, who carried a basket of provisions.
She was so lively that the rest of the party were
silenced. Theresa heard her bandying jokes with
Mr. Ritchings with surprise, and concluded she
was a moral mine, and that it would not do to walk
over her. As the boat left the wharf she turned
and walked home, drawing a full breath when she entered
the door, and experiencing an unwonted sense
of relief. Through the empty rooms she passed
as if she was seeking a spirit she had no hope
of finding&mdash;the "something beautiful" which had
vanished from her life. Perhaps its airy nothingness
came the nearest to a habitation in Parke's
room. She lingered there and inspected his belongings;
they were scattered everywhere,&mdash;letters,
boots, gloves, hats, daguerreotypes, crumpled handkerchiefs.
Ends of cigars and opened books were
lying on his bed, the table, and window-seat; his
watch was run down, and all the stoppers were out
of his perfume-bottles. From this confusion there
was a subtle, delicate emanation, which could only
belong to him. Idly opening several of the picture-cases,
which contained the likenesses of his college-chums,
she came upon that of Theresa, which
he had borrowed of Philippa. Suppose he should
marry Theresa! She wondered if it would be
agreeable to Philippa! There was a belief in Sarah's
mind, like a fatality, that she was so devoted to
Parke she would not marry herself, but that his
marriage would be the most important event of her
life. All that she had done from a child went to
prove that she was to be a sort of human providence
in his career. Sarah was also fixed in a belief
that she was not a girl to be sought or loved,
or desired to be. The idea of his marriage was
painful even to herself; she questioned whether
mothers were ever glad of a son's marriage. A
bitter lonely feeling came over her, and hot tears
welled into her eyes, which Elsa interrupted:</p>

<p>"What time may we expect them?" she asked,
pretending not to see Sarah's tears.</p>

<p>"About nine, I think."</p>

<p>"And we must have a hot supper. Of course
the parson will stay to it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;why not?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; only he is after our Philippa. You
needn't contradict, Sarah. He looks at her when
he is preaching even. He hasn't had his eyes off
her this day, unless he has been sea-sick."</p>

<p>"Why hasn't Mary put Parke's room to rights?"</p>

<p>"What is the use of putting <i>his</i> room in order?
I pity the woman <i>he</i> marries."</p>

<p>"Matrimony runs in your head, Elsa."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be wise in you to think of the possibility
of somebody's being married? Or do you
expect to cut and carve everybody into an eternal
single blessedness?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ritchings is friendly and polite&mdash;nothing
more."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is all, is it? Mary says that Gilbert
says the whole town declares that Mr. Ritchings
is in love with Philippa. We'll shut the
town up."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Elsa, don't speak of it; gossip
irritates me; but I shall forget presently."</p>

<p>"Ministers are such a mark, you know," said
Elsa, her anger all gone; "but anyhow he shall
have a good supper."</p>

<p>"If you please, Elsa."</p>

<p>"What ails her now?" queried Elsa, on the way
down stairs. "Something or other discourages
me. I wish I could find out who is doing it.
Ministers <i>are</i> a mark, and I don't know that I
blame her for getting mad, but that man is in love
with Philippa&mdash;and&mdash;her money."</p>

<p>Sarah, still restless, went up garret, towards sunset,
to look over the bay. The wind had died
away, and the tide was out; the sea lay within its
rim of yellow rocks, that looked alive with stirring
snaky weeds, like a blue, wrinkled banner. Not a
sail dotted its wide surface. Jason and his companions were
not within its limits.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p>WELL out in the bay, Theresa asked, "Where
does the wind come from?  It  makes no
flurry, yet its force keeps the water flat."</p>

<p>"When it blows from the north at this time of
years," said Jason, "it blows strong; but we shall
have no flaws with it."</p>

<p>Philippa looked up at him reassured.</p>

<p>"You are scared, Philippa," he said.</p>

<p>"Let me sit on the other side," she begged;
"there is very little boat between me and the water
here."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are. I shall cross the bay presently;
with the wind behind us, the boat will
right."</p>

<p>"This is fine," Parke remarked; "we glide over
glass."</p>

<p>"Splendid," replied Mr. Ritchings. "Your father
is an excellent boatman, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"His attitude betokens security, at least."</p>

<p>He was half-lying, half-sitting; his right hand was
on the tiller, his left under his head, his legs were
crossed in the air, and his face was half hid by an
old felt hat, which was very much crushed.</p>

<p>"Isn't he an original?" Theresa said, in a low
voice, to Mr. Ritchings.</p>

<p>"Hush," he whispered, with a laugh, "they are
a tribe of originals; don't you find them so?"</p>

<p>"All but Philippa," she answered mischievously,
looking into his face. He grew very red, turned to
Parke, and asked where they were going.</p>

<p>"Pitt's Island," suggested Philippa.</p>

<p>"That's a good place," said Jason, pushing up
his hat.</p>

<p>"What is on the island?" Theresa asked.</p>

<p>"Huckleberries and wood-ticks, at present,"
Jason replied.</p>

<p>"We shall have to wade ashore," Philippa cried.</p>

<p>"Philippa is so sensible," Theresa exclaimed.
"For my part, I want to wade."</p>

<p>Jason put up the helm for Pitt's Island. It
would take half an hour to round Hawk's Point,
behind which the island lay, and a few minutes
more to reach shoal water, he said, reclining at the
tiller again.</p>

<p>Parke and Theresa crept forward, and sat down
on the other side of the sail; his boot-soles
against the ballast stones, and the edge of her skirts,
were all that could be seen of them at the other end
of the boat. The sun shone in their happy, handsome
faces, and the breeze blew; sufficient was the day
for their pleasure thereof.</p>

<p>"We shall return with red noses," he said.</p>

<p>She dabbled her hands in the water, and filliped
some in his face.</p>

<p>"If you do that again, while I am so helplessly
lying at your feet, supporting the weight of a cloak
for your sake, I'll&mdash;throw it off."</p>

<p>She looked at him lazily, and said, "What
changeable eyes you have!"</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow, and brought his
face close to hers.</p>

<p>"How handsome you are, Theresa!"</p>

<p>"So are you."</p>

<p>A pause, during which both looked into the deep,
green sea.</p>

<p>His hand fell softly upon hers; their fingers
locked, palm was pressed to palm.</p>

<p>The voices of the syrens rose from the depths of
the sea, and a wild, sweet, delicious melody floated
round the pair.</p>

<p>"We hear nothing from the other end," she said,
at last, releasing her hand.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to hear?" he asked, dropping
back in the folds of the cloak.</p>

<p>"I am not anxious about it. Mr. Ritchings is
happy, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Ritchings?"</p>

<p>"With Philippa, you know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he exclaimed with energy: "he is
nothing to her."</p>

<p>"I dare say; but he is smitten to the core with
her."</p>

<p>"<i>He!</i>"</p>

<p>"Now you are going to hate him. How selfish
you are! I wish Philippa would flirt, and worry
you to death."</p>

<p>"Can't you teach her the art?"</p>

<p>"Do I possess it?"</p>

<p>Then he whistled "Lively Polly," and closed
his eyes as if he was sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. Ritchings engaged Philippa in conversation,
and Jason was left to his thoughts, while steering.</p>

<p>"I have seen very little of you of late, Miss Philippa,"
said Mr. Ritchings.</p>

<p>"We have missed you from our house; that is
the reason, is it not?"</p>

<p>"You have been so much occupied!"</p>

<p>"A little more than usual."</p>

<p>"But you are always a good deal occupied since
your cousin came home. Do you read together?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"Is he not fond of reading?"</p>

<p>"Novels, yes."</p>

<p>"You do not like novels?"</p>

<p>"No; nor fairy stories, nor poetry."</p>

<p>"Not a literal novel, like 'Jane Eyre'?"</p>

<p>"Literal! Charlotte Bronte cheated her readers
in a new way. She threw a glamour over the burnt
porridge even, at the Lowood school, and the seed-cake
which Jane shared with Helen Burns. Did
red and white furniture ever look anywhere else as
it did at 'Thornfield'? Haven't we all red
and white articles which have never stirred us beyond
the commonplace?"</p>

<p>"The glamour of genius."</p>

<p>"Genius casts its glamour over ordinary things:
we who have none say there is a discrepancy
between the real and the ideal."</p>

<p>"But life must be illustrated."</p>

<p>"It can not be; the text ruins the attempt."</p>

<p>"Does not passion illustrate it?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Somebody says; 'Nothing is so practical as the
ideal, which is ever at hand to uphold and better the
real,' and I believe it."</p>

<p>"Shoal water," cried Parke from the bow.</p>

<p>"We are among the rocks, Jason," said Philippa,
bending over the side.</p>

<p>"I have run on the ledge," he answered, "and
shall put you ashore from it. Step from rock to
rock along the point; Miss Bond may wade ashore,
if she prefers to."</p>

<p>"Teach us, pilot, to scramble up that bank in
front," Parke remarked.</p>

<p>"There's a path somewhere," said Jason.</p>

<p>"I see a little flag-staff on the summit!" Theresa
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Down with the red flag,<br/>

Up with the black,"</p>

<p>sang Parke, assisting Theresa out of the boat.</p>

<p>Jason tied the sails and threw the anchor into
the sand, while the rest climbed the bank, and disappeared
in a thicket which bordered it. Theresa
pulled the wild shining smilax, and wreathed it
round Parke's hat and her own. They crossed a
ravine filled with half-sunken rocks and dense
bushes, and came on the face of a hill, their destination,
whose top was covered with magnificent
pines. Philippa discovered that the provision-basket
had been forgotten, and slipped into the ravine to
meet Jason and remind him of it. He had not seen it,
and both of them went back to the boat.</p>

<p>"You pushed through the swamp, did you?" he
said. "I know a better course."</p>

<p>She followed him into a dark, slippery path,
black with vegetable mould, and choked with rocks
which were beautifully stained with red-eyed moss,
green velvet moss, and a ruffled, fringed, scaly
fungus-growth of wonderful microscopic plants,
which she carefully avoided, with the idea that they
must be poisonous.</p>

<p>"Don't you call this a handsome carpet?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He was answered with a scream; looking round
and taking the direction of her eyes, he saw a lazy
snake coiled upon a rock she was about to step on;
he seized and flung it far into the bushes. Rubbing
his hands with grape-leaves, he said: "You are
afraid of every thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," she answered meekly. "How could
you take it up?"</p>

<p>"Because it frightened you, and the sooner out
of the way the better. I do not believe you can
climb this hill."</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>He caught her up, and with a few strides was at
its top, where he deposited her beside Theresa, and
told her the frightful adventure with a snake.</p>

<p>"Are you not well, Philippa?" asked Parke.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Are you in good spirits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I always am. Do you not know it?"</p>

<p>"I am awfully hungry."</p>

<p>She started to unpack the basket; Parke threw
himself beside Theresa, who declared she was in
raptures with life. The dazzling, tremulous blue
sea round her; above her stirred the green, scented,
feathery sea of the pines, and "'Ringed with the
azure world' we sit upon this smooth elastic, red
mat, commonly called pine needles."</p>

<p>"And like a thunderbolt we'll fall upon the
meal by Mr. Ritchings spread, in shadow of yon
towering tree. Come, sylvan goddess, the minister
has spread the cloth, and put a stone on each corner
of it to keep it from fluttering."</p>

<p>"Roast chicken, Miss Bond, buttered bread, tart,
cake&mdash;which, or all?" called Mr. Ritchings.</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>"We have no plates, only napkins."</p>

<p>"I prefer my fingers," said Theresa.</p>

<p>Jason asked to be excused from coming to the
table, on account of the lowness of the seats and
his inability to dispose of his legs. Parke suggested
the fork of a tree, near by, not more than fifty
feet from the ground.</p>

<p>"There is no plum-cake here, Mr. Ritchings,"
said Philippa, with a smile that warmed his spirits.</p>

<p>"I am out of office to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy I am!" sighed Theresa, with
her mouth full of chicken.</p>

<p>"I am too," said Parke, taking a bit of tart.</p>

<p>"Are the others as happy, think?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If they are as hungry."</p>

<p>"Animal!"</p>

<p>Philippa came towards them with a glass of coffee,
and Mr. Ritchings followed with a paper of sugar
and a bottle of cream.</p>

<p>"There is one spoon only," he said.</p>

<p>"How delightful!"</p>

<p>"There," said Parke, flinging a cone at Philippa,
"the inhabited world may dine now."</p>

<p>A merry chat followed. Jason offered cigars;
Philippa, a little tired, reclined against a tree, and
contemplated the white clouds which floated in the
aerial deep, and curled their edges in relief against
the pines. Theresa subsided into silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jason unlocked his tongue. "There
is something in this scene, Mr. Ritchings, beyond
ethics; it confounds and annihilates them."</p>

<p>A shade of annoyance passed over Parke's serene
face. He moved his cigar to the other side of his
mouth. Mr. Ritchings looked on the ground and
picked up a twig, but Theresa's subtle instinct understood
Jason's meaning.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said.</p>

<p>"A man does not value the Creator so much
here; he thinks of the created. Here falls the
crown of humanity upon his head in its circle of
beauty, suffering, and uncertainty. The speechless
air, the deaf earth, the blindness of substance&mdash;what
do they but render us back vagueness for
vagueness? Why was Christ tempted on a mount?
Not because he could see therefrom the kingdoms
of the earth. I read these lines in one of your
books, Parke:</p>

<p>'To her fair works did Nature link<br/>

The human soul that through me ran.'</p>

<p>I think Christ was tempted with the loss of faith
in his heroic mission."</p>

<p>"The old gent is breaking out with a vengeance,"
murmured Parke, in Theresa's ear.</p>

<p>"You must read the Gospel with a good deal
of imagination," cried Mr. Ritchings. "In what
do you believe?"</p>

<p>"In what I feel."</p>

<p>He lighted a fresh cigar. His mood changed.
He made quaint remarks that forced even Philippa
to laugh, and Theresa again thought him a genius.
Six o'clock came, and it was time to go. Sweeping
the napkins into the basket, he strode out
of sight down the hill. Philippa and Mr. Ritchings
picked up the shawls and followed. Parke
moved in a roundabout way from tree to tree, for
Theresa was not inclined to leave.</p>

<p>"The picnic opened a mine in my governor,"
he said, "did it not?"</p>

<p>"I have been struck with him from the first.
He is a genius."</p>

<p>"A what, Miss Bond?"</p>

<p>"And geniuses never have children like themselves."</p>

<p>"He must be one, then."</p>

<p>"Why do you call me Miss Bond?"</p>

<p>"I call him a prime old fellow, any way, and
you&mdash;<i>Theresa</i>."</p>

<p>"Shall I ever again have so beautiful an hour as
this, Parke? Let us never go into the world of
human beings!"</p>

<p>She clasped the trunk of a pine, and signed to
him to go on.</p>

<p>"I'll stay here forever, if you say so."</p>

<p>"You would not."</p>

<p>He was busy breaking off scales of bark, but he
raised his eyes. There was a tide of beautiful,
dangerous darkness in them.</p>

<p>"They will be waiting for us," she added, drawing
towards him.</p>

<p>"Let them wait," he said, with his lips on hers.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Theresa&mdash;again."</p>

<p>The voyage home was a silent one. It was past
eight when they reached the house, and when they
sat down, by blazing lamps, to supper, they felt
dazed, like those who come from a distant, different
land, into a forgotten home.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p>PHILIPPA'S life, though apparently so pale and
cold, in contrast with the blooming richness
of Theresa's, increased its silent forces. Theresa's
regnancy, instead of subduing Philippa's expectations
and intentions, developed them. She waited
for a favorable moment to reveal them.</p>

<p>Theresa determined to make a collection of
grasses, and for a number of days went to the fields.
After the grass came a passion for sea-weeds, which
also lasted a number of days. Parke's enthusiasm
lasted through both phases, as did also Philippa's
patience. By brook, thicket, and hedge-row, in the
shallows of the tide, among the rocks, along the
length of the rough beach of Crest, she pondered
many things.</p>

<p>At last the opportunity came, as she believed,
when the course of her empire should take its way.
It was introduced by Mrs. Rogers, who accosted
her at the church door, one Sunday.</p>

<p>"My Sam," she said, "was spoken off the River
Plate, in April, with eight hundred barrels of sperm
oil. He'll be in this fall, sure, and he hasn't a
white shirt to his name. I must make a set, and
want to borrow a pattern of the collar Parke had
on. My mind would wander from the sermon to-day.
I do wish Mr. Ritchings would be rather more
doctrinal; he would get a more lively attention
from <i>me</i>, then."</p>

<p>"Of course you shall have a pattern. We shall
all be delighted to have Sam at home."</p>

<p>"When is your Miss Bond going? Parke and
she are a handsome couple. Are they going to
make a match?"</p>

<p>"No," said Philippa, sternly.</p>

<p>"Beauty goes a great ways, Philippa, if it is only
skin deep. It is none of my business, though all
our families have been connected, as it were, for
many years, my second husband being one of the
Squire's best captains, I have thought it would be
worth your while, and Parke's, to keep the property
together. You are not much akin. Sarah
would die in peace then."</p>

<p>The Yankees rush in where angels fear to tread;
but Philippa could not help giving her motherly
friend a tight grasp of the hand. She made a
careless reply, however, and referred to Sam again;
but Mrs. Rogers understood her whole heart.</p>

<p>That evening Philippa mentally arranged a conversation
with Theresa, and the next morning, while
she was puttering with gum-arabic and sea-weed,
took some sewing and went to her room.</p>

<p>"Theresa, you have quite educated Parke."</p>

<p>"Will he be grateful, think?"</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>Theresa burst into a gay laugh.</p>

<p>"Theresa, I am going to speak to you about
Parke."</p>

<p>"Speak away, then," said Theresa, with a
haughty motion.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rogers asked me if he and you were
going to make a match. I said, 'No.'"</p>

<p>"You did!" Theresa carefully affixed the filaments
of a delicate spray on a sheet of paper,
and continued: "And why?"</p>

<p>"You must not marry him. I speak my mind,
because I am willing for you to understand my devotion
to him; it will allow nothing to stand in
its way."</p>

<p>"Not even <i>his</i> way, I suppose."</p>

<p>Philippa clinched her hands.</p>

<p>"What right, Philippa, have you to expect me to
be more generous than yourself? You are a fool."</p>

<p>"I know that I must appear so to you; but
neither he nor you know that I can do more for
him than any person in the world. I do not mean
in episodes of grass, and sea-weed, parlor talks,
and music, and the fine appearance of life. I
mean something which your capacity does not include&mdash;the
care and watchfulness of slow years,
without reward&mdash;the patience to endure all weakness,
indulgence, selfishness&mdash;the bond which begins
with a white veil, and ends in a white shroud!
There are states and circumstances which justify
us in the attempt we make to take into keeping
the lives of men like Parke Auster. I would not,"
and Philippa rose and paced the room as if she
was measuring every inch of him, soul and body,
"give in to his own resistance against me. I
will compel him finally to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"And for this," said Theresa, "you would deprive
him of the passion which is the glory, the
exaltation of life. Dear me, you are fit for human
nature's daily food&mdash;that's all. You dream that it
lies with us women to govern the destinies of men.
We may indulge them with episodes, though,
while they treat us to <i>our</i> destiny. I told you a
tragedy would come to you; you are making it for
yourself. It is possible that you may succeed in
your plans,&mdash;the tragedy will be no less; I do not
think that you will. No assimilation with Parke's
tendencies, no dovetailing with his habits, no devotion,
ever so absolute, will avail a moment when
the inclination seizes him for something different.
Now, Philippa, there is one thing I will do&mdash;not
another which may in any way refer to him&mdash;if
you say so, I will go home to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No," answered Philippa gently, and kissing her
cheek, "I wish you to stay."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was the summer of a Presidential campaign,
and stump orators were going over the country.
The celebrated Pisgah Spring, Member of Congress
from the Fourth District, was invited to
make a speech at Millville, the central village in
the county, but so much scattered that it consisted
merely of four corners, on one of which stood a
large, dilapidated meeting-house, and in which
Pisgah Spring was to hold forth. Jason was
chosen as delegate from Crest, and Sarah proposed,
as it was moonlight, that they should all go to the
meeting.</p>

<p>"Ritchings is going," said Jason, "with the
Hall family."</p>

<p>"Suppose you and I go on horseback,
Theresa?" asked Parke.</p>

<p>"I'll suppose so, with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Philippa will go in the carriage with us, Sarah,
then," said Jason. "We must start at half-past
six. Who will make me a blue rosette? I am one
of the fools to sit on the platform."</p>

<p>"All of us," cried Theresa. "Come, Philippa,
to a shop; I want a piece of ribbon."</p>

<p>It was bought, and Theresa decorated the whole
party, including the horses, with the rosettes.
Philippa wore that night a white muslin dress and
a white shawl. Theresa called Parke's attention
to the effect of the rosettes in her hair. He
remarked, that she always looked  well, except when
arranged as the American Sphinx.</p>

<p>"She is a sphinx, however. Why don't you try
to guess the riddle she propounds?"</p>

<p>"Is she more mysterious than any other
woman?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Parke," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Nothing erratic in Philippa&mdash;is there, mother?"</p>

<p>"I haven't discovered it."</p>

<p>"Prophets in their own country, Mrs. Auster,"
Theresa observed carelessly.</p>

<p>"Philippa does not happen to be in her own
country," Sarah replied, with a laugh.</p>

<p>For once Parke caught and understood an
expression of pain in Philippa's face.</p>

<p>"Philippa," he said, affectionately, "my country
is your country, isn't it? You are as much of a
Parke as I am. Mother, why did you marry a
foreigner?"</p>

<p>Jason entered and prevented her reply. He had
been putting in the horses himself, he said, as Gilbert
was obliged to take one of the saddle-horses
to the blacksmith's to have a shoe fastened.</p>

<p>"That was my business," said Parke.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you attend to it, then?" his father
asked.</p>

<p>"Because it is so much easier for me to trouble
others than it is to trouble myself. I suppose I am
very selfish."</p>

<p>He looked so remorseful that two-thirds of the
party felt eager to deny this supposition.</p>

<p>"How blue you all are," said Jason, cheerfully.
"Theresa, where is my badge?"</p>

<p>She pinned it to his coat, smiling so pleasantly
upon him, that he could not help patting her pretty
hand.</p>

<p>"You do not need a badge," she said. "Your
eyes would answer for one; they are bluer than
this ribbon, and are so much handsomer."</p>

<p>Jason comically poked his fingers into his eyes,
and said he never knew till then that he had eyes.</p>

<p>"You are a deuced coquette, Theresa," said
Parke, when he adjusted her foot in the
stirrup.</p>

<p>The atmosphere had been a strange one all day.
The sky was dun-color, and the sun rolled through
it&mdash;a ball of orange fire. A beautiful blue haze
ringed the horizon and hovered over the bay, which
had faded and fainted in the heat, and lay white
and motionless, not stirring under the penciled
shadows which rayed its edge. For a short distance
the road stretched round the shore. The
deep silence of the sea made Theresa feel silent
also. When Jason struck into a road which turned
abruptly from it, she drew a long breath. They
entered dense woods, already gray with dusk, and
alive with the mysterious stir of invisible creatures
who do not love the day, which called out some
instinct of enjoyment in her. The cool odors of
the ferny swamps, and of flowers yielding to the
night, penetrated her with a wild sense of luxury.
But Parke was silent and absorbed; he pushed
along at a rapid pace, keeping near the carriage
which preceded him. At a bend in the road
Theresa stopped her horse, while the carriage, and
Parke with it, wound out of sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, night and heat, sound and odor, why can't
I burst into apostrophe! There is something
exquisite between you and me: and why not teach
me what it is, and why it is&mdash;senseless Powers, that
overpower me!"</p>

<p>Parke turned back as soon as he missed her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Theresa?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; I stopped to get the effect of those
splendid white moths on Poll's mane."</p>

<p>"They hover round <i>you</i>, after the fashion of
moths out of the woods."</p>

<p>"Ah! I have been thinking of Philippa, also."</p>

<p>"Philippa! oh, yes."</p>

<p>She whipped the leaves from the bushes near,
with her riding-whip.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her sometimes?"</p>

<p>"I think of her always, as a peculiar girl, of
noble traits," answered Theresa, the leaves flying.</p>

<p>"She frets me. What does she enjoy&mdash;anything
really?"</p>

<p>"Living for you. Could you ask more?"</p>

<p>"I do not deserve so much from her. Why
should she be so wonderfully single-minded?"</p>

<p>"There is where she is peculiar."</p>

<p>"What will make her attend to her own happiness,
I wonder, instead of mine?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I can not tell."</p>

<p>"Look this way, Theresa."</p>

<p>"One way is as good as another, for it is dark."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, won't you?"</p>

<p>"How thick the glow-worms are now."</p>

<p>"And the moths are thicker, too. Give me your
hand."</p>

<p>She surrendered it, and he pulled off her glove.</p>

<p>"Tell me that I am not quite worthless, Theresa."</p>

<p>"I do not know," she answered, dreamily,
"whether you can be worth much to <i>me</i>. You
tempt me, as I tempt you. Suppose I tell you&mdash;this
is just the moment to confess it&mdash;that my
senses are all on your side. Confessing this, compare
me with Philippa, whose soul shines in a
lambent light, which you could go through life by&mdash;clear,
pure, calm life. Would you like it?"</p>

<p>"The comparison does not interest me much,"
he said, quietly, holding up her hand, and trying to
slip on her glove.</p>

<p>"Don't put on my glove," she said, petulantly.</p>

<p>He offered it to her, and she snatched it from him.</p>

<p>"Shall we ride on, Theresa?"</p>

<p>"Are you angry?"</p>

<p>"Confess more, then."</p>

<p>"Can <i>you</i>&mdash;on your soul?"</p>

<p>"Let us go on." And he laughed strangely.</p>

<p>"Just so," she answered, giving her horse a sharp
cut. "On and on."</p>

<p>They overtook the carriage as it entered the
town, or rather as it reached the meeting-house,
about which a crowd was gathered. It was decorated
with pine boughs, mottoes in ground-pine
and tissue-paper, and dimly lighted with candles,
lamps, and torches. An active committee had
knocked out the windows and a part of the end
wall, where a platform was raised for the accommodation
of Pisgah Spring and the delegates. The
body of the house was nearly filled with ladies. A
polite usher, however, found a front seat for Sarah.
Theresa and Philippa went to a pew under the gallery,
near one end of the platform, and Parke stood
among the men by the doors.</p>

<p>When Pisgah Spring came forward he was
immensely cheered, especially by the galleries.
Theresa happened to be looking at Jason, who was
on the platform near them, and remarked that he
was scrutinizing the supports of the gallery in their
vicinity. She forgot him in a moment, however,
and was attracted by the change in the evening sky
and the rising of the moon, which she saw through
the opening in the wall.</p>

<p>At a burst of applause for a display of eloquence
an ominous creak was heard. A pillar gave way.
The beams above Philippa and Theresa snapped,
and a rush was made to get out of the gallery; the
house was filled with cries&mdash;the audience struggled
with each other to get out. The girls clasped
hands; they could not move, the pressure was so
strong against them, by those who were endeavoring
to get out through the opening in the wall
behind the platform.</p>

<p>Jason leaped from it with an oath, and fought
his way to the corner where they were. With a
blow he demolished a sash, and thrust them through
it. They had scarcely touched the ground before
Parke and his mother were there. Theresa
trembled and wept, and Philippa, who had dropped
on the ground, quietly fainted. Jason took her up
in his arms and pushed out of the crowd, telling
Parke to be quick with some water. Theresa saw
him put his hand on her forehead, and then clasp
her close to him, throwing back his head, as if he
were making a mad appeal for help.</p>

<p>"She won't die with the fright, will she?" she
asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"She will come to presently," Sarah answered,
taking from Parke the cup of water he had found
and dashing it in her face. "Put her on her feet,
Jason."</p>

<p>"What did you say, Sarah? Who is hurt?" she
asked, struggling to stand.</p>

<p>"There is more dust than wounds," Parke
replied; "two or three are hurt, however. The
meeting is over, of course. I'll bring up the
horses."</p>

<p>"How are you?" called Mr. Ritchings, passing
in his carriage. "My coat is tom. Are you
frightened? Did Miss Philippa faint? Did she,
indeed? But she has recovered, I see. I shall
come over in the morning to your house."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Ritchings," Parke bawled.
"Come, Theresa, are you recovered enough to
ride home on horseback, or shall I put you in the
carriage?"</p>

<p>"We will go as we came, if you please."</p>

<p>They started in advance, for Jason was detained
a few moments. Meantime the crowd dispersed;
the lights were put out in the church, and the four
corners deserted. Night reigned with her ancient
silence; the dew fell afresh, the crickets came
afield, the silver spears of moonlight gleamed
everywhere, and the stars marched against the
dawn.</p>

<p>"Sit on the front seat, Philippa," said Sarah,
when Jason came up. "I want all the back seat
to take a nap on."</p>

<p>He rolled up his coat for a pillow and put it
against her head; yawning a few times, and complaining
of being chilly, she soon appeared to be
sound asleep. The silence was only broken by
Jason speaking to his horses, which were restive.
Philippa could not shake from her mind the picture
of Theresa's crying on Parke's shoulder; she was
very weary, however, and when the horses subsided
into a monotonous trot, her head drooped as
if she was falling asleep also. Jason loosened his
hold on the reins and turned to look at her; the
shawl had fallen from her shoulders; he drew it
up, and, to his surprise, she laid her head against
his breast, remaining there so motionless that he
thought her sleeping. Better for him to think so
then, if one may dare say that there are moments
when a man's soul is rightfully his own, in its
supreme and sublime selfishness. In truth, Philippa's
feelings in regard to Parke were so plain to
herself, that she believed Jason&mdash;her fellow-alien,
the only unobtrusive, kindly being she had ever
known&mdash;sympathized with her, and understood
them. As for him, his heart stopped beating, then
bounded forward, and dragged every nerve into
the terrible development which made him a <i>man</i>.
One by one his primitive instincts were revealed to
him; he knew that he was a natural, free, powerful
being. What then compelled this monarch to
still drive his horses carefully, which were conveying
his wife and ward home? Will any one
man or woman, who has noticed his or her own
autobiography, answer? May the saints forgive
Jason for ever afterwards retaining the sweet
ability which this night brought him! Ever afterwards
the summer sky and summer earth, "moving
eastward," shared with him the secret&mdash;a right
between them, which no power could annihilate,
for it was not a guilty fact, but an undying truth.</p>

<p>At last he gave utterance to some peculiar note
which the horses understood, and they flew home
at a thundering speed.</p>

<p>Jason hung about the stables till Gilbert locked
the doors and went away. He then made the circuit
of the house, and saw only a light in his own
room. He pictured Sarah winding her watch, putting
her numerous ornaments in their boxes, and
pinning her curls. A sudden desire seized him to
go to her, and give her a chance to understand
him. In a moment he was in the chamber, and
seated near her&mdash;to surprise her by seeming interested
in her toilet. She felt so constrained by his
observation that she turned from the glass, and
asked him what ailed him. His eyes wore so
eager, thirsting, searching an expression, that had
she been anything but the plain, honest woman she
was, she would have felt disturbed.</p>

<p>"You have taken cold, Jason; you look feverish."</p>

<p>"No, no. Let us talk," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you know that it is past one?"</p>

<p>"Never mind the hour. Did you notice Theresa
in the alarm to-night?"&mdash;removing from the
subject he intended to introduce.</p>

<p>"No. What do you mean?" She tied her cap
with more resignation to the "talk," and sat down
on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>"She flew to Parke, and cried, with her head on
his shoulder"&mdash;Jason shivered&mdash;"as if it was <i>the</i>
place for her."</p>

<p>"No doubt she thinks so. Most girls would."</p>

<p>"Being his mother, you flatter him."</p>

<p>"Fiddle-stick! He is rich and handsome, and
Theresa is a sharp, worldly-minded girl."</p>

<p>"Why did <i>we</i> marry, Sarah? I was neither
handsome nor rich&mdash;only a stupid, green boy, just
as I <i>have been</i>&mdash;a stupid, ignorant man."</p>

<p>"It proves, don't it, that I was not sharp, nor
worldly-minded?" And she gave one of her
abrupt, shrill laughs.</p>

<p>"Did you notice <i>me</i> with Philippa to-night?"</p>

<p>"Philippa! I have had enough of Philippa!
She didn't fall on anybody's breast, did she? She
fell on the ground&mdash;a better place for her&mdash;and
you picked her up. Why didn't you let her lie
there? But you pride yourself on your justice."</p>

<p>Jason was astonished. He saw that Sarah hated
Philippa. If he should confess to  his  wife that
through Philippa he had become a different man,
what would be the result? A more cruel hatred.
He was dismayed at the danger he had been ready
to thrust her into, for it would be impossible for
Sarah to make fine distinctions; so if there was
anything now existing in him which was damaging
to his conjugal honor, he could not make expiation
by its revelation to Sarah.</p>

<p>"She must needs faint," added Sarah, passing
her hand over her face, as if to smooth out the
evil expression there. "She has a Southern constitution.
Those Southern woman are incapable,
helpless babies."</p>

<p>"Sarah," and Jason stood up resolutely, "have
I ever loved you?"</p>

<p>"I really do not know, Jason," she answered, as
resolutely; "and, if you will force me to say it, I
do not suffer to know."</p>

<p>"Thank you." And the conversation was
ended.</p>

<p>As thankful as Jason was, he could not sleep.
He was busy cutting down the Tree of Knowledge
which had suddenly grown up before him. Practically
he demolished its leaves, blossoms, and
fruit. This was his expiation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p>AS the time for Theresa's departure drew near,
she felt impatient to be gone. Separation
was the test she thought best to apply to the relation
between herself and Parke. Had she been
sure of his feelings, she could have explained her
own; but there was such a mixture of impetuosity
and coolness, so much <i>abandon</i> at one moment, so
much hard reserve at another, in his manner, towards
her&mdash;such moods of clinging, appealing tenderness
and of trying, imperious demands, that her
self-possession was completely overthrown. Away
from the magnetism of his presence, she expected
to be able to analyze the influence which each had
over the other. She deliberated whether she would
renew the subject of Philippa's former discourse regarding
him, and so make common cause with her;
but an undefinable belief that, after all, Philippa
had not proved herself the fool which Theresa had
called her, in her estimation of the position she
would claim and assume with him, prevented. It
was possible that his temperament could be run
down by the slow, concealed, indefatigable pursuit
of a temperament like Philippa's.</p>

<p>"Well, Philippa, I shall soon be gone," she said.
"What shall you do without me?"</p>

<p>"Subside."</p>

<p>"You are a fatalist, Philippa."</p>

<p>"Human life goes on with and without precept
and example, failure or success. We have some
sustaining principle which is independent of circumstances.
Is that fatality?"</p>

<p>"The industrious apprentice does not always
come to be Lord Mayor, nor does the idle apprentice
always come to the gallows."</p>

<p>"I shall miss you, Theresa. The whole of Crest,
outside and in, is not so lively and brilliant as you
are."</p>

<p>"Thanks; I am pyrotechnical, I know. Look
about you, after I am gone, for rocket-sticks, exploded
crackers, and black wadding."</p>

<p>"I owe you something."</p>

<p>"Pay me."</p>

<p>"You have taught me the value of patience, and
you have helped me to understand how useless it is
for me to attempt to imitate you, in having any
positive pursuits. I am not like other girls, and I
shall not try to be. If you had not been here, I
should have been for some time to come tormented
with a feeling that I ought to study, to read, to
feel passions, have tastes. By what you <i>are</i>, I have
seen what I am <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"By patience&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I have had an awful trial with you, and
that I have borne it."</p>

<p>"Do write your biography: 'Philippa, A
Late Christian Martyr.'"</p>

<p>"Not a martyr."</p>

<p>"Your conceit surpasses any thing I ever
saw."</p>

<p>When Theresa's bonnet was tied, and she was on
the point of leaving the house, Sarah said: "You
are coming again?"</p>

<p>"Of course she is," Parke interposed.</p>

<p>"Will you invite me, Mrs. Auster?" Theresa
asked.</p>

<p>"If any thing depended on my invitation," she
answered, "it would be worth while to ask me for
one."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, you are too modest; ask her to
come and live with us."</p>

<p>Theresa's color rose. Sarah tossed the row of
curls along her forehead as if they had been little
bells, and her face kept a neutral expression; but
the invitation was cordially given.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Theresa," said Jason, with the
feeling that he was shaking hands with an episode,
as he walked beside her to the gate. She broke a
spray of flowers from a bush which bordered the
walk.</p>

<p>"These betoken autumn," she said; "are you
superstitious, Mr. Auster?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"There is not a flower here whose emblem is
<i>Remembrance</i>."</p>

<p>"Glad of it."</p>

<p>"Why, how ungallant you are at the last moment!
Come, I am treasuring the last words of you all.
Can you give me no better?"</p>

<p>Philippa was depositing Theresa's shawl and
basket on the seat of the carriage; his eyes rested
upon her.</p>

<p>"As if we needed emblems," he said.</p>

<p>"They are foolish," she answered, following the
direction of his glance; "but then there are fools.
Keep this flower, will you? <i>not</i> for remembrance."</p>

<p>The tone of her voice startled him; he looked at
her so sharply that she turned crimson.</p>

<p>"Give it to me, then," he said. "Is there any
thing else you could give me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>When the carriage went on, he stuffed the flower
in his vest pocket, and passed out at the gate.</p>

<p>Elsa thought that the house was like a funeral
the whole day, and recommended a course of company
year in and year out. She reckoned the
family improved by being distracted from itself.
As for Mr. Auster, she had seen him something
like folks for several times since Miss Bond came.</p>

<p>Philippa rearranged Theresa's chamber, and
made a retrospect of her visit. Her looks and
ways were so vividly remembered, that Philippa
felt almost able to assume her identity; but these
recollections did not cause any change in a resolve
to act without reference to her relation with Parke.</p>

<p>When Parke returned from the station, he carried
out a purpose, long postponed, of breaking a
filly in harness. When he was tired of the effort
he sought Philippa, and kept her with him the
whole afternoon, looking over his stock of music,
and singing the familiar songs. The old life had
begun again.

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p>SOME caprice determining Sarah to refurnish
the house, she asked Parke to accompany
her on a journey. She desired him to recollect
how many years the furniture had lasted, and
hoped that what she intended to buy would last as
long. They were absent a week. Before their
return, there were two arrivals in Crest, which
excited some interest&mdash;that of the bark <i>Unicorn</i>,
whaler, of which Sam Rogers was mate, and the
schooner <i>Emily</i>,  which brought as passengers a
family from the South, consisting of a mother and
two daughters, named Lang. The captain's story
concerning them was meager in its details, but the
gossips of Crest were obliged to content themselves
with it, as nothing more could be obtained. He
said that Mrs. Lang's passage was engaged, when
he was in port at Savannah, by an elderly planter
from the interior, who made inquiries respecting
the eligibility of the small towns on the coast of
New England as a place of residence, and decided
upon Crest. What relation he was to his passengers,
the captain did not discover; but he guessed
he was a wise old cove to send them to the North.</p>

<p>The glitter of negro blood was in Mrs. Lang's
eyes, and the negro modulation in her voice; her
complexion was a deep yellow, and she wore a wig
of dark, straight hair. Though past middle age,
her carriage was still splendid. She had been a
lithe, sinewy, gay savage, but her day was over; a
double expression was dominant in her face now&mdash;of
weariness, from some long-continued strain, and
of repose, because of safety attained. Her manners
reflected the hut, the boudoir, and the Methodist
gatherings of plantation slaves.</p>

<p>Her daughters, Clarice and Charlotte, sixteen
and eighteen years of age, were handsome. Clarice
had a brilliant swarthy complexion, shining,
curly, black hair, large black eyes, with a vindictive
sparkle, and manners which were a mixture of the
sulky and the vivacious. Charlotte reminded one of
the Calla Ethiopia, she was so tall, slender, bending,
and graceful, her complexion so smooth and
opaque, and the curves of her face so beautiful.
Her lips were always parted, her wistful light-blue
eyes widely opened, and her straight, silky,
chestnut hair disordered. She impressed those who saw
her with a pitying admiration, a wondering regret,
and a mysterious doubt. Mrs. Lang hired a cottage
on the outskirts of Crest, in a little by-street,
which Jason had cut and graded, intending to build
a row, but never had, and set up housekeeping,
without hiring assistance, or introducing herself to
her remote neighbors. Some, calling her "nigger,"
wondered if she expected that anybody would associate
with her and her daughters; if she did, she
would find herself mistaken, and kept in a repellant
attitude, in case she should make an advance;
then relaxed that indignant pride, and began to
suffer from a lively curiosity regarding the habits
of the family, and, finally, made an attempt at
acquaintance, which was met with the coldest
response. Others heard of the arrival of the Langs
with the same indifference that they heard of the
arrival of a circus, or a lecturer on the lost arts
or poetry; among these was Sarah, who, when Elsa
told her the news, on the night of her return, was
too much engrossed in her new purchases to pay
much attention to it.</p>

<p>"I walked up that way, while you were gone,"
said Elsa, "and I saw Mrs. Lang; she wears a wig,
because she is ashamed of her woolly hair."</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsa," said Philippa, "do you wonder that
a woman with white blood in her veins should try
to hide the black?"</p>

<p>"A nigger is a nigger, and the Lord means to
keep him so. I have no patience with the race;
and it seems as if He hadn't, sometimes, by the way
things go on here and in Africa."</p>

<p>"Mother," asked Parke, "didn't you buy something
for Elsa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a new front; what the shopkeepers called
a 'ventilated front.' You needed one badly, Elsa."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she exclaimed, putting up her
hand to a rusty false band of hair that wouldn't
stay on her forehead, "did you think of me,
Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Lang," said Parke, comically.</p>

<p>"Now, Parke, you need not twit me; but I must
say that youngest daughter of Mrs. Lang, who
came here to see Mr. Auster about the house they
have hired of him, is the most lovely creature I
ever laid my eyes on. She beats Theresa Bond
out and out."</p>

<p>"Does she?" Parke asked, with an air of interest.
"She is to be pitied then."</p>

<p>"Look at the shells Sam Rogers brought me."
And Philippa brought out a box for Parke to
inspect. He regretted that he had not known of
the gift, so that he might have brought a little cabinet
to place them in, and said he must visit Sam
at once.</p>

<p>"I'll make you one," said Jason, who had not
said a word of the Langs, though he knew more
of them than Elsa did, for he had seen them several
times in reference to rent and repairs.</p>

<p>"Jason, I believe you have a longing to follow
your old trade," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"It amuses me to play with edged tools," he
answered.</p>

<p>"The kings somewhere," said Parke, "learn
trades, so that if their kingdoms upset, or they are
compelled to abdicate, they can earn their living.
Who was it made baskets?"</p>

<p>"That is the case with me," remarked Jason,
"all but the kingdom."</p>

<p>"This is the first time, Parke," Elsa observed,
"that I have had a specimen of your college learning.
I conclude you got that story so."</p>

<p>"Put on your false front, Elsa, and don't be
troublesome."</p>

<p>"Theresa Bond should have stayed longer, to
see our new things," she continued.</p>

<p>"She will have the chance any time to enjoy my
choice," Sarah answered. "I do not wish to have
the house renovated for fifty years. Whoever will
disturb it, disturbs me, dead, or alive."</p>

<p>Elsa reflected upon this remark afterwards, and
did not wonder at Jason's saying "all but the
kingdom." Nobody had ever succeeded in standing
against Sarah, except Osmond Luce. Jason,
Philippa, and Parke were under her sway. If a
struggle should ever come between her and Parke,
he would either give up or die, for she would
harry him to death.</p>

<p>Parke made himself quite irritating during the
renovation; that is, he contradicted her once or
twice, and looked annoyed because Philippa showed
much indifference about any change in her own
room. One day he brought a letter from Theresa
for her to read, which contained some suggestions
he had asked for, concerning her taste.</p>

<p>"I do not want to read it," she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Theresa writes me, you know."</p>

<p>"So I supposed; but she does not answer <i>my</i>
questions in <i>your</i> letters, does she?"</p>

<p>"She might as well, though."</p>

<p>"To save postage?"</p>

<p>Something wild flew into her eyes which he saw.
All the sallow tints in her face disappeared like
magic, and a line of fire ran into her lips.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "You mean to convince
me that she can not manage me alone? Why
must I have so <i>much</i> done for me, Philippa?"</p>

<p>If she had possessed the least subtlety of feeling
at that moment, she would have given up the
contest she waged; but she only thought of
what she was herself, and how he must come to
know it.</p>

<p>"Theresa has talked with you, of course, about
me?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"I talked with her."</p>

<p>"Where is the distinction?"</p>

<p>"Parke, you do not understand yourself."</p>

<p>"Nor you. I thought you liked Theresa. Do
you want me to break with her? I have only not
to answer her letter."</p>

<p>"I do like her, and do not wish you to break
with her."</p>

<p>"Come, let us go and ride. The afternoon is
fine."</p>

<p>"Shall you answer the letter first?"</p>

<p>"No; we'll take the ride first."</p>

<p>The horses were at the gate in a few minutes,
and Parke turned them in the direction of one of
the necks of the bay. Philippa was foolish enough
to feel happy again. There could not come a time,
she believed, when her life with Parke would cease.
It would not be in the nature of any circumstance
that could happen to him that she would not, in
some way, be involved in it, and influential with it.
As for him, there was something in the atmosphere
that made his spirits rise&mdash;something more with
every mile that made them equable, fair, and full.
The vast white clouds that moved in the blue sky,
and let fall darting shadows over the still and solitary
landscape&mdash;the mild sea-wind rustling the
faded corn-leaves on their dry stalks&mdash;the grass-hoppers,
singing their last songs in the warm turf&mdash;the
purple and yellow flowers and red grass in
the ditch&mdash;the low, level fields, dipping to the
shore, beyond which he caught glimpses of the sea&mdash;the
tranquil twilight of an old pine wood, whose
needles filled up the sandy ruts, whose tops of vital
green covered a gray skeleton army of trunks&mdash;the
maples, whose leaves are the couriers of the
frost&mdash;the flickering birches, dropping pale-yellow
leaves&mdash;the tri-edged, shining grass of the salt
marshes&mdash;the whir of the brown birds&mdash;the umber-colored
brooks, with their borders of cool sand&mdash;one
and all belonged to the pleasant condition of
his mind.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p>PARKE was, and always had been, intimate with
Sam Rogers, and until the house was in order
Sam stayed at home and received visits from him,
and saw but little of Philippa.</p>

<p>The Squire's mahogany sideboard, his spider-legged
tables, looking-glasses in carved frames,
chests of drawers, and high-post bedsteads, were
removed to the garret, and left to cobwebs. The
dingy carpets, and straw-bottomed chairs, and
sofas invented by Torquemada, or some other inquisitor,
were removed, and gay French furniture
took their places. Crimson and green&mdash;drab and blue
prevailed. The somber, quaint character of
the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> vanished; its irregular air of comfort
faded in the new splendor. Some fine old
curtains of damask and Indian chintz were pulled
down, and a wretched combination of brocatelle
and embroidered lace was put in their place. The
house, in short, was more changed in Sarah's
hands than it had been in Jason's. Philippa successfully
combated the assault upon her apartment&mdash;one
of the largest in the house. There was but
one alteration: the old-fashioned white dimity
coverings and curtains were taken away, and pale-green
chintz dotted with rosebuds substituted.
She regretted the ancient white fringes&mdash;the dancing
dolls of her childish imagination. The chintz,
however, gave the room a cheerful look, which it
had never worn before. She covered the elephantine
sofa and the immense tester over her bed with
it, and the oak chairs with high backs. There
were no pictures on the walls, and no books, except
a little pile of volumes bound in leather and
marked "Osmond Luce." Nothing, in her estimation,
could be more pleasant than this room; its
plainness and freedom from small rubbish were excellences.
She pictured Theresa in her own room
at home&mdash;as she had described it&mdash;a museum of
grasses, "immortelles," weeds, plants, engravings,
coins, and china, and wondered how she should enjoy
herself in the Bond family, for Theresa had
urged her to spend the winter with her.</p>

<p>One day, when she was perched on the large sofa,
she heard Jason calling; he opened the door as
she answered, with the shell cabinet in his hand.
Seeing her on the chintz sofa, he thought of a humming-bird.</p>

<p>"Here, missy, is the thing for your shells."</p>

<p>She sprang up with thanks, the warmer for having
forgotten all about it, and asked him where she
should put it. He made a tour of the walls, setting
the cabinet in different places to try its effect, and
finally concluded to fasten it over the mantel.
Before he had finished nailing it, Sarah put her
head in at the door, and looked round with a critical
eye.</p>


<p>"I heard a pounding," she said. "What! have
you only finished that thing just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; is this the place for it?"</p>

<p>"I think so. How you have puckered the top of
the sofa-cover, Philippa!"</p>

<p>"It suits me very well," Philippa answered;
"as well as any thing can in the place of the fringed
dimity."</p>

<p>"I can remember when grandmother sewed the
fringe on. She worked hard always, but believe
she was never as tired as I am."</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" asked Jason.</p>

<p>"Yes; should you not suppose so?"</p>

<p>"I wish you to do nothing, Sarah."</p>

<p>"Things would come to a pretty pass, wouldn't
they&mdash;especially with Philippa perched on her
great-grandfather's sofa?"</p>

<p>"It is mine now, and I am glad my great-grandfather
is dead."</p>

<p>"Speaking of your grandfather, Sarah," broke in
Jason, "when do you expect to be done with your
furnishing?"</p>

<p>"Soon; and when it is once done, it is done
forever with me."</p>

<p>"Well, could I ask for some apple-fritters for
supper."</p>

<p>She laughed, and vanished.</p>

<p>"Forever," repeated Philippa, running her finger
along a line of calico rosebuds. "Forever is a
long word."</p>

<p>"But," said Jason, raising his hammer as if about
to strike the word, "there are such words, even in
this world&mdash;the same as in Eternity."</p>

<p>She looked at him with surprise, for there was
something pathetic in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yet," he continued, with a laugh, "there was
an end to grandmother's fringe."</p>

<p>"How well that cabinet looks, Jason," she said,
with a desire to give him some sort of encouragement.</p>

<p>He snapped his white teeth together, and stifling
a sigh of self-pity, threw up his hammer in the air,
caught it, turned on his heel, and left the room.</p>

<p>When they met at supper, Sarah beamed behind
a heaped-up dish of apple-fritters, for which Jason
expressed becoming gratitude.</p>

<p>"Is the struggle about over, mother, with carpets
and things?" Parke asked.</p>

<p>"About."</p>

<p>"We are forehanded with the fall, this year,"
said Elsa.</p>

<p>"Let's have a party for benighted natives, and
show them our furniture," suggested Parke.</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," said Sarah; "but we must
have company on Mr. Ritchings's account, and Sam
Rogers's."</p>

<p>"It is almost a month," said Jason, "since anything
was done for Ritchings by the female parishioners."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," cried Parke, "we'll give Sam Rogers
an entertainment."</p>

<p>Philippa laughed at the idea of Sam's enjoying
Company, but Parke was in earnest. He had a
chivalrous feeling for Sam, which did him honor,
especially as he was aware that his friendship was
gratuitous; indeed, it was the only friendship he
had ever sought. There was no similarity between
them; they never liked the same people, nor held
the same opinions. Sam never took any trouble to
please Parke, but he was not insensible to his
attachment. At first Sam flatly refused to attend
Mrs. Auster's party, but he was the earliest guest
who appeared. He came early, he said, that he
might stow himself away somewhere. He laughed
more shyly and spoke with more vehemence than
was his wont; but he did not change color, or lose
his tongue. Parke took a survey of him, admiring
his manliness. Philippa directed him to sit beside
her, if he did not wish to receive any attention.
She could not help contrasting him with Parke,
taking him for just what he was worth, as she in
her thoughts expressed; how much higher in the
scale Parke stood! Sam was all over brown, face,
hands, and hair, which last was so thick, short, and
curly, it would not part. His nose was large, and
his mouth wide; his eyebrows were close together,
and his eyes were small, but they were keen and
penetrating. Parke's serene, marble-like brow, the
faint bloom coming and going in his cheeks, his
large, sensitive eyes, his firm, beautifully cut mouth,
the indescribable, unconscious grace of his attitudes,
the movement of his head, and his air of repose
and self-possession, proved him worthy, according
to Philippa's ideal.</p>

<p>"What did you let mother have the pattern of
this choking collar for, Philippa?" Sam growled.
"I am strangled and miserable."</p>

<p>"Ha, old fellow," said Parke, "you have come
to wearing something like what I wear. Thanks,
Philippa."</p>

<p>"I could not thwart your mother's ambitious
views for you," Philippa replied.</p>

<p>"Mother is losing her wits."</p>

<p>"You are an only child, remember."</p>

<p>"Say, Philippa" (Parke had turned away),
"is Mrs. Auster as soft on Parke as she used to be? He
has grown up to be just what I thought he would be."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"He has never checked one of his tendencies,
nor had them checked. Selfish to the core."</p>

<p>"We differ," she said, gently.</p>

<p>"You are soft yourself about him, as you always
were, hey?"</p>

<p>He was embarrassed, looked down on his hands,
opened and shut them as if they were his safety-valves.
She looked at them, too, and for the hundredth
time noticed the blue stars and crescent
moon pricked in India-ink on his right hand.</p>

<p>"He is enthusiastic about <i>you</i>," she said.</p>

<p>"He is a fine fellow, and ought to go whaling,"
he answered, with an expression which denoted
that he should say no more to her
about Parke.</p>

<p>Called away, he amused himself by shuffling a
pack of cards, which he took from a table near
him, and studied Philippa. He feared that she,
too, had grown up to be what he suspected four
years ago; he knew her too well to hope that her
feelings would be changed by ordinary grief or disappointment.
All that could be done for her, in
case Parke should break her heart, would amount
to little, for she would accept no consolation. He
had dubbed himself her knight when she was a
small girl, however, and would, in his own fashion,
stand between her and harm. She would never
perceive it, so he might as well make the effort.
Who would, if not he? She never had a real friend
in her life. "Damned shame," he almost said
aloud, and struck his knee so that the cards fell in
a shower at his feet. Looking up, he saw Parke
contemplating him.</p>

<p>"Avast," said Parke, when he met his eye.</p>

<p>"Avast it is. Look here."</p>

<p>"I am looking."</p>

<p>"What about that gal mother told me of, who
has been visiting here?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you her picture, if you will step out."</p>

<p>"How many have you collected since I went
off?"</p>

<p>"My collection is small, but choice."</p>

<p>"And important, if true."</p>

<p>Parke led the way into his room, and was obliged
to look in several places before he could find
Theresa's picture, which fact Sam noted.</p>

<p>"There," said he, producing it; "isn't that stunning
to your harpooning mind? Did you ever see
a handsomer face?"</p>

<p>"I have seen a better one."</p>

<p>"Of course, you must detract. Have you a
suspicion that I am in love with the owner of that
face?"</p>

<p>"You may have more than a suspicion that you
are; but you are not."</p>

<p>He tossed the picture on a pile of books, and
stared at Parke. "It is no go," said Sam.</p>

<p>Parke returned the stare, and answered: "It all
depends on your decision, my brave tar, of course.
I have only waited for you to come from your
ancient and fish-like calling, to be settled in
life."</p>

<p>They reappeared in the parlor, arm in arm, and
Sarah remarked complacently to Mrs. Rogers, that
it was pleasant to see Sam's delight in the society
of Parke.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Mrs. Rogers replied, "which he
makes the most of, Philippa or Parke; but I
reckon he'd do any thing to please Philippa."</p>

<p>Sarah sneered; but the sneer was lost on the
good-natured Mrs. Rogers.</p>

<p>"Jason sticks to his rule still," she added, "of
not making his appearance when there is any company
round."</p>

<p>"He is a poor hand at entertaining people."</p>

<p>"Now I don't agree with you; <i>I</i> find him an
excellent companion."</p>

<p>"He does seem to be at home with you,"
Philippa remarked. "I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Trot right off, Philippa, and attend to Mr.
Ritchings; he don't take his eyes off of you."</p>

<p>Sarah bit her lips, and looked round at him
angrily.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p>THE house in the order she destined it to be,
Parke settled at home, looking forward to no
change&mdash;what remained for Sarah but repose? A
thorn grew in her spirit, which rendered nugatory
her well-earned content. She could no longer disguise
the fact that Mr. Ritchings loved Philippa.
It angered her to see that his love was not received
as a favor, with gratitude and agitation; and it
angered her to know that a man whom she
respected and admired should think of selecting
Philippa for his wife. It irritated her also to
understand that he might place Philippa in a position
where she could, by her money and name, aid
him in his career more than she herself would love
to aid him. She determined to caution him. The
caution was well conveyed; it influenced him, but
did not bring him to the point of ending his hopes.</p>

<p>Philippa was, so Sarah said, peculiarly unfitted
for the place a minister's wife should occupy.
Under the most favorable circumstances, it was
disadvantageous for him to select a wife in his own
parish; it was sure to create dissensions in all its
families, except the one he married into. It was a
familiarity on his part that bred him contempt&mdash;falling
in love, courtship, engagement, marriage,
should be performed afar off. Under unfavorable
circumstances, as in Philippa's case it would be,
the state of things would be far worse. She was
not admired; she was cold; had no friendships in
Crest&mdash;no interest.</p>

<p>"Her property is an interest, is it not?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that?" she asked
sharply. "Has Jason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jason has said nothing," he answered haughtily.
"I have asked him nothing. But if ever a girl
understood what the 'sentiment of the soil' is, it is
Philippa."</p>

<p>It is incredible, but she continued, without
actually lying, to give him an impression that
it was by no means certain that Philippa would
inherit much of the "soil"; her father was still
alive&mdash;a man of reckless character and extravagant
habits, who would prove a curse to him, should any
relation be established between them.</p>

<p>"In all the years," taking up the topic of her
character again, "I have never heard one expression
of gratitude or affection from her. I have
watched over her when ill, day and night." A real
tear shone in Sarah's eyes, which he credited, for
he knew that she had most carefully watched over
Philippa, of whose regard and devotion to Parke
he tried to speak.</p>

<p>"He makes devotion easy, you know; he has
the power and means of gratification far more than
you have. Besides, she has grown up with him,
and affection between them is a habit. She is a
creature of habit."</p>

<p>"Is she entirely devoid of passion?" he asked,
with a flushed face.</p>

<p>"There," she replied, with a contemptuous
sparkle in her sharp eyes, "you step on ground I
know nothing about. <i>I</i> do not look into such
questions."</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" he said roughly; "society
hinges on questions like these. You, a wife and
mother, ignore them."</p>

<p>She tossed her curls. "I presume we differ in
our ideas."</p>

<p>"In describing Philippa," he said, in an exasperating
voice, "I fancy you have described your
model in spite of yourself; she is not one to be
moved by a man's love, nor his hate."</p>

<p>"Experiment for yourself, then; I have spoken
for your good alone, against one whose father is
my nearest relation. You must know that I am in
earnest."</p>

<p>From the time of this discourse, his conduct
towards Philippa was a curious mixture of neglect
and watchfulness,  the  satirical and the dignified,
the perplexed and the determined.</p>

<p>To watch him, and distrust his strength, to lay
up a store of irritation against Philippa's insouciant
behavior towards him, became the task which prevented
any folding of the hands, and drove Sarah
at the old speed.</p>

<p>Mr. Ritchings haunted the house and the whole
family. If he met Jason in the street, he turned
and walked with him; if he saw Parke driving, he
beckoned to be taken up and conveyed to some
place he had no previous intention of going to.
He appeared to have discovered that Elsa was an
"original," and made frequent raids into her territory;
but he never talked of Philippa&mdash;not even to
Sarah did he again mention her.</p>

<p>Elsa met his advances with an air of simplicity
which made Jason laugh, and speak to her of the
condition he knew Mr. Ritchings to be in. He was
working, he said, against wind and tide.</p>

<p>"My opinion is," she replied, "that beaux won't
interfere much with her; but if she should ever set
her heart on anybody, she will hold on like grim
death to him. She is like her father there; he had
but few ideas, but they were strong ones. I hope
she never will fancy she loves some man."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because she will be disappointed, most likely."</p>

<p>"No she won't; she shall not be."</p>

<p>"We are all disappointed, for that matter&mdash;don't
you think so? If we reach up to a round above us
in the ladder, we have to let go the one we stand
on; then we look back on it, and are sorry we
moved. If we don't reach up, we are looking up.
Mr. Ritchings is in just such a fix."</p>

<p>"We are all disappointed, are we?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that you are. Neither death,
disgrace, nor poverty, has knocked at your door
yet."</p>

<p>"Disgrace has."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Auster, you scare me; you are
joking."</p>

<p>"Disgrace has knocked at my door with a lantern
in her hand."</p>

<p>He was forgetting himself, but her disturbed
face recalled his thoughts.</p>

<p>"She comes to most people in the dark, I guess,"
she said, hastily. "I only knew you when you
were first married; if you had any by-gones before
that, hadn't they better be by-gones? How well I
remember your wedding-coat!"</p>

<p>"Blue, with brass buttons;&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah cut it up the other day; I guess it
was moth-eaten."</p>

<p>"Did she?" A look of pain passed over his face.</p>

<p>"Do you expect Osmond Luce to come back
ever?" she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"I think he will come; why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"In case Philippa should change her mind about
Mr. Ritchings, what a nice father-in-law he would
make a minister!"</p>

<p>"He is not so bad, Elsa; he gave up his rights
to Philippa, you know."</p>

<p>"That was because he didn't want them, you
may depend; if he had, heaven and earth would
not have kept him out of them. Dilly-dallying
here won't make my pie-crust, though."</p>

<p>She vanished from the kitchen, where she had
held her confab, into the adjoining buttery.</p>

<p>Jason was moody; he seemed to himself now to
have been but a dull clod. He had droned in Crest
and had his wedding-coat cut up, while Osmond
Luce, breaking every shackle, like the bold, generous
spirit that he was, had made himself free, and
followed out his true impulses. He&mdash;Jason&mdash;too,
had been troubled with some ideas about improving
Humanity! He should be glad now to have it
proved that he had made himself a little wiser and
better than he was when he started on the tour of
life; the sunshine, the fair tideless river, had
tempted him, and he had lain on its banks, like a
hulking beast, gaping for flies. His face grew dark,
and the muscles hardened round his mouth like
iron cords; he rose and stretched his hands above
his head, striking with his palms the ceiling.  At
that moment Philippa entered by the porch door,
with a branch of maple in her hand crimsoned by
the October frost. She had been taunted by Sarah
that day; to escape her, and her own feelings, she
had gone into the distant fields, and skirted the
borders of the woods, till she was utterly fatigued.
She paused when she saw Jason; the electrical
atmosphere of a perturbed spirit passed from one
to the other; it produced in her a vague wish to be
understood by him, and in him an emotion which
made him curious.</p>

<p>"Look at this, Jason. I brought it from the
Bartlett fields; there is a line of maples blazing
up there."</p>

<p>She approached him.</p>

<p>"Have you been so far?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Gilbert is up there, with the dogs."</p>

<p>"The dogs have run away."</p>

<p>He kept his eyes fixed upon her face, but with
an expression of self-assertion and self-mastery
that made him look kingly. The branch was
extended to him; he took it and twirled it to and
fro;&mdash;a heavenly smile broke over his sorrowful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Philippa."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not going to give it to you; I
promised Theresa to gather her some autumn
leaves."</p>

<p>He was thanking her&mdash;not for the crimson branch,
but for appearing before him then, to make him
remember that at least he could suffer nobly. He
handed it back to her.</p>

<p>"Theresa must have all she wants," he said.</p>

<p>"No, not every thing."</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; do you?"</p>

<p>Surprised at the tone of her voice, he was silent,
while she stripped every leaf from the branch so
slowly that he counted each one as it fell; with
the last she looked up. Her eyes made him wonder
what the matter was with her.</p>

<p>"Do you mean any thing concerning Parke?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There is nothing wrong, I hope; he still likes
her, does he not? They like each other;&mdash;a very
happy match, I should say."</p>

<p>"I thought you might know, Jason," she almost
whispered. Then the truth burst in upon him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what, <i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"That I have believed&mdash;that I myself should
marry&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was beyond his power not to put his hand
over her mouth; he stifled the name between her
lips. She saw he knew it, but could not understand
the check. Elsa made a providential clatter
close by them, and she attributed it to that.
A wave of anguish dashed over him, followed by a
host of roaring, crawling, cruel emotions, that rent
him asunder; he felt as if soul and body were
parting.</p>

<p>"Come in the dining-room," presently he said
calmly; "Elsa is noisy."</p>

<p>Half leading, half carrying her, he placed her on
a sofa and himself beside her, and then, as the
room was darkened by blinds and shades, he
allowed his pain, amazement, and perplexity to
fight as best they might. In her profound egotism
she thought that he was considering how her wishes
could be brought about.</p>

<p>At last he said, "Can Parke make you happy?"</p>

<p>"I was happy with him."</p>

<p>"Could Theresa be happy with him?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> would not be with her."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"I think there is no engagement between them."</p>

<p>"None?" he asked, bitterly; "what were they
doing together here?"</p>

<p>"Trifling."</p>

<p>"It was that, was it? Trifles do not disturb
you then?"</p>

<p>She was abashed at his accent, but said in a
moment: "Jason, if our lot is cast with another's
we must bear all the crosses, as well as our own
hopes. My <i>judgement</i> sanctions all that I would
do. Do not believe that I am mistaken."</p>

<p>One of the parlor doors opened, and Sarah
entered with her hands full of some sort of sewing-work.</p>

<p>"You are posted here, are you?" she said, when
she perceived them; "but it is not necessary to
keep in the dark, is it?"</p>

<p>Jason rolled up the shade, and threw open the
blind.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Are you talking over business?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!"</p>

<p>Philippa felt towards her a repulsion which acted
like a charm; she wished&mdash; in a dreary way, however&mdash;that
the charm would take some shape so
she could hurt her.</p>

<p>"Philippa has talked a great deal to-day, I
believe," Sarah said.</p>

<p>"We were speaking now," Philippa replied, "of
Theresa."</p>

<p>"You don't approve of her, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sarah," said Jason; "why should
she approve of her? because she flirted with
Parke?"</p>

<p>Sarah looked very angrily at Jason; his manner
was unusual.</p>

<p>"Are you putting your finger in the pie?"</p>

<p>"If you mean a match between Theresa and
Parke, yes&mdash;I oppose it."</p>

<p>He left the room before she could reply to him.</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> influencing him?"</p>

<p>"What makes me dislike you so utterly?" asked
Philippa; "I cannot account for it."</p>

<p>"Answer me&mdash;what does he mean?"</p>

<p>"I'll answer you nothing just now."</p>

<p>"I advise you not to meddle in anybody's
love affairs, if that was the subject of your discourse."</p>

<p>"Love!" cried Philippa; "yes, that was the
word. Do you know it?"</p>

<p>She rose from the sofa, with glittering eyes
fixed upon a distant something, and clasped her hands
together with an inspired gesture which reminded
Sarah of the episode of the rosary.</p>

<p>"You are crazy," she said.</p>

<p>"I have been mad for years; do you think that
I should have lived with you if I hadn't been?"</p>

<p>Light flashed in upon Sarah's mind also. "Had
Philippa been idiot enough to expect to gain
Parke?" she thought. If it was so, she would
never allow Philippa to dream that such a thing
was possible. It was not possible, as far as
Parke was concerned, and yet&mdash;there was the property,
which might be all his again. But no, the idea of
that girl being his wife was not to be thought of.
She started up with an energetic movement, and
said: "Don't show that you are cracked to more
people than you can help. If Jason has nothing
better to do, he can listen to you. I wish you to
attend to those pillow-cases I spoke to you of."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Philippa, with the habit of obedience,
"I will."</p>

<p>"Here, here," called Elsa, from the passage,
"whose litter of leaves is this? Sarah, I want you
in the buttery."</p>

<p>Mr. Ritchings, the unconscious agent of this
development, came that very evening to the panelled
parlor, where Philippa sat stitching the
pillow-cases, and Sarah knitting. It would seem as
if that day's turbulent life included him in its
outward circling waves. With Philippa's scissors,
and on her side of the table, he snipped paper, and
talked philosophy which was full of calm bitterness.
Sarah sympathized with him, and Philippa
coldly combated. Parke had gone to pay a visit
somewhere; Jason and Elsa were absent, but
Sarah maintained the field, which he wished was
clear. She grew jocose, and compelled him to listen
to her.</p>

<p>"It is too cold to open the window, I suppose,"
he said, at last. "You should see the moon
to-night."</p>

<p>Philippa rose, threw up the sash, and stepped
out on the terrace.</p>

<p>Sarah looked up at him with a restraining eye.</p>

<p>"Why do you sit in this room so much?" he
asked, impatiently. "These dark panels oppress
me; haven't the walls the power of contracting?"</p>

<p>"You would breathe more freely outside."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Go, and have done with it," she said, suddenly,
and somewhat sadly. "Philippa has been a whirlpool
before to-day."</p>

<p>"Whirlpools have one advantage&mdash;they don't
leave a wreck behind."</p>

<p>"I thought differently&mdash;that all sorts of things
would come tossing ashore with every storm, from
their depths. I feel it is so." And she shivered.
"The house seems full to me of spoils that have
been destroyed by their ungovernable rage."</p>

<p>He had followed Philippa. Sarah laid down her
knitting, crossed the room several times, and then
stopped before a portrait of the Squire, painted at
the age of forty.</p>

<p>"She is contemplating her ancestor," he thought,
casting a look backward. "Why don't she give
up her vanity and vexation of spirit before that
representation of sublime selfishness?"</p>

<p>Philippa was pacing to and fro between a row of
shrubs and the windows. The moon, midway in
the sky, sailed up from a bank of clouds, and dispersed
them in a pearly shower of vapor which
sped its way before her. Under the horizon the
sea, struck by its waves, ran hither and thither&mdash;a
world of billows without a margin. Crest lay half
in shadow, half in light, wrapped in the mysterious
silence which is inseparable from moonlight.
Never does the soul feel so far from human life as
when a man finds himself alone in the vistas of the
moon, either in the streets of a sleeping city,
the avenues of the woods, or by the border of the sea.
Earth, swayed perhaps by her powerful satellite,
withdraws her sympathy from him, and he wanders
in a white void, wondering if he was born to be
thus annulled.</p>

<p>"Does this beauty make you feel that you</p>

<p>'Would be something that you know not of,<br/>

In winds or waters'?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ritchings asked, pacing beside her.</p>

<p>"No; I think of lunatics in moonlight nights.
There is no wind, but the atmosphere is full of
chilly moisture."</p>

<p>"Let me get you a shawl. Don't go in; walk
down the path with me."</p>

<p>She declined the shawl, but assented to the walk.</p>

<p>They went down the terrace. He endeavored to
take her hand, but she quietly folded one over the
other, and prevented him.</p>

<p>"I read a horrid thing the other day," she said,
"'Christabel.' I am reminded of it to-night."</p>

<p>They stopped before the gate. Surveying the
road below it a moment, he said, in a matter-of-fact
way, "I wish you would walk down the path of
life with me."</p>

<p>"You really wish it?" she asked, confronting
him.</p>

<p>"If you were not the coldest, most insensible
girl in the world, you would have known my wish
long ago."</p>

<p>She shook her head slightly. Cold as she was,
the sight of her at that moment of soft, subdued
light, standing under the rolling sky, the dark
trees round her, alone with him, sent his blood
warmly through his heart. She wore a dark dress,
which, with the shadows, concealed her form,
but her head and face looked angelic. Her fair, flowing
hair, her firm brow, her sweet mouth, her little
hands, which moved restlessly, made a picture
that hung in his memory long after.</p>

<p>"Believe me," she said, in a broken voice,
"I could never satisfy you."</p>

<p>"That I know. But I love you."</p>

<p>"I beg you," she said, in a gentle voice, "to
give up all hope."</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Because I can only be your poor friend."</p>

<p>"You are very young, Philippa. You may be
more yet to me."</p>

<p>"My character is not formed,&mdash;you would say?"
she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Well, let us walk back," she said, and to compel
him to do so, she placed her arm in his.</p>

<p>Sarah had resumed her knitting. She did not
raise her eyes, but began to chat as soon as they
entered. Philippa was silent. She judged that
Mr. Ritchings might be as persistent in his feelings
as she was in hers, and she did not know how to
manage him. He soon bade Sarah good-night,
but instead of going home, walked beyond the
town, till he heard the baying of Jason's dogs in
the woods. He wished, for a moment, to change
places with that "free, indifferent, rough man, the
delicacy of whose feelings would never stand in
the way of his happiness." At that moment Jason
was lying in the depths of the woods, half buried
in the falling autumn leaves, so still that the
"wingless airs" crept about him undisturbed, so
sad that the leaves were moistened with his tears.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

</div>

<p>SAM ROGERS was aware of the state of Mr.
Ritchings. They met often at Jason's, and
he was the only one of the coterie whom Mr.
Ritchings neglected&mdash;the one who alone could
have given him an insight into the real life of the
family. He called him "the whaler," and "your
awkward friend," and "the nautical man," and
asked Sarah what the attraction was about Sam,
and why Parke and Philippa were never bored with
his society. Sarah replied with some asperity,
that his courage, honesty, and perseverance had
won him everybody's respect, and that he was a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of her grandfather's. Mr. Ritchings said no
more. Sam had a fondness for chess. He induced
Philippa to learn the game, and evening
after evening they pored over it. He also professed
to have more ear for music than formerly, and
often engaged Parke at the piano. Some kind of
a nucleus was needed, he argued with himself, in
that house, for Philippa's sake&mdash;something to knit
them together and bring out their good qualities.
He wished that he could play the family as he
played chess. The winter must be passed pleasantly;
therefore when Parke suggested that there
should be a series of cotillon parties, he cheerfully
consented to be manager with him, although he
was only in the jig line himself. The visit to
Theresa Bond was put off till the latter part of
winter, and Philippa, since Parke's heart was in
the cotillons, made up some evening dresses, and
practised waltzing with him in the parlors. Elsa
called waltzing the devil's ring-round, but she
must say that she thought Philippa was an adept
in it. Sarah made no opposition to the scheme,
because it was Parke's, and said nothing in its
favor, because she was a member of the church,
which disapproved of frivolities. Her tacit consent
was borne out by the fact that most of the
dancers were children of church-members, like herself,
who said "the young will be young," and
"nature will out," in spite of the tenet that dancing
was one way of going to perdition.</p>

<p>After the first cotillon party, however, Mr.
Ritchings preached a Calvinist sermon, which
made his hearers nod and wink at each other, with
a grim sense of humor at their deserved punishment.
This was the only way he noticed Philippa's
evident pleasure in the cotillons. It made him
heart-sick as well as polemical: it was a matter in
which the line of separation was an iron chain.
Why should a man's profession compel him to take
part against himself? Why should a man's calling
be so much better than himself, that to keep up with
its demands he must play the hypocrite? Not that
he wished to dance&mdash;far from it&mdash;but he did not
wish to be excluded from Philippa, who was all
that could make him good.</p>

<p>A universal excitement prevailed when the
cotillons opened at the Crest Hall, among those
who went, and those who stayed at home; a new
sensation was felt, because they were under Parke
Auster's auspices, who had never been prominent
in any public enterprise before. Even the staid
Gilbert went to the hall entrance to see the guests
enter; when he returned, he asked Mary who she
supposed was there? Elsa, startled from her doze
by the fire, said irritably, "Your master, the
devil."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder, Elsa; but, besides him,
Mrs. Lang's girls are there."</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious!" exclaimed Mary, "well, I
never; did you, Elsa?"</p>

<p>"Who invited them?" asked Elsa.</p>

<p>"The managers, I suppose," he answered, lighting
his barn-lantern; "Parke Auster, Esq., and
Sam Rogers, Esq."</p>

<p>"You'd better confine your observations to the
barn," suggested Elsa.</p>

<p>"Think so? Well, I will." And he disappeared.</p>

<p>"It's that Sam Rogers's work," says Mary; "he
don't know who to invite, and who not to. How
should he? been whaling all his life."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," Elsa replied, rubbing her glasses
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Those girls haven't been about any to my
knowledge. I never saw either of them."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"I wonder what they have got on to-night."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Mary; do you know what you are
talking about?"</p>

<p>"I believe I do&mdash;fugitive slaves."</p>

<p>"Niggers: let them alone."</p>

<p>Mary was silenced, and Elsa took a lamp and
went to bed.</p>

<p>The Lang girls were the latest at the dance.
Parke was dancing with Philippa when they entered;
as soon as it was over, Sam Rogers went to
him to inquire how they got in.</p>

<p>"They came with Tim Jones."</p>

<p>"Did he bring them here without consulting you
as to the propriety of so doing?"</p>

<p>"He spoke of bringing them when he took his
ticket."</p>

<p>"You consented?"</p>

<p>Parke gave him a rigid stare.</p>

<p>"I did more."</p>

<p>"Have you seen them before?"</p>

<p>"Since you are getting up a catechism&mdash;yes. I
saw Charlotte Lang once with her mother; they
came to the office. I think her extraordinarily
beautiful, and that is why I did it."</p>

<p>Sam looked at his calm face with a keenness
which was mixed with admiration. He knew he
could not make him lie, yet there was something
inscrutable in his countenance which he could not
read. It wore a mask of marble.</p>

<p>"They won't get any partners."</p>

<p>"Tim Jones must look out for that. There are
different sets of people here, you observe; blue
blood would not cover the floor."</p>

<p>"Confound you!" said Sam, turning on his
heel.</p>

<p>Clarice Lang, in a short time, defined her position.</p>

<p>"If the managers ask us to dance," she said to
Charlotte, "we shall not have made a mistake in
coming; otherwise, I shall understand Mr. Parke
Auster's invitation."</p>

<p>"How, Clarice?"</p>

<p>"He is pleased to make an experiment, perhaps."</p>

<p>Charlotte sighed.</p>

<p>"You always say such things."</p>

<p>"You are a fool. Don't you see that we are a
card for once? I have no doubt but that Mr.
Auster is daring enough; he shows people that
what he chooses to do, he will do."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Jones is daring, too," said Charlotte
logically.</p>

<p>Clarice shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Several young men were introduced, and begged
the pleasure of dancing with them. Clarice refused
coldly, and Charlotte declined with a gentle grace.</p>

<p>Philippa was amazed at Charlotte's beauty. She
thought of a time, in the twilight region of early
childhood, when she had heard the sound of the
lash on shoulders as lovely as Charlotte's, perhaps;
at any rate, it cut the flesh of her race.
Suppose she were tied to a whipping-post at this
instant, what would be the tide of feeling? would
it change from the contemptuous coldness now shown
to pity and protection? She asked Parke
what he thought of her.</p>

<p>"I think she is too beautiful to be lost in this
Sahara; I pity her from my heart. It is of no use
to fight with imbecility, though; you can see how
those girls are received among the coarse boobies
here. I only asked to have them treated like
human beings."</p>

<p>"Shall I speak to them?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not best," he said quickly; "I would
rather not have you. Ask Sam what he thinks of
them," he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He danced with no one that evening except
Philippa. Several times he addressed a few words
to the Langs. While he spoke, Charlotte continually
looked at him, and continually averted her
eyes from him, and he scarcely appeared to see
her, but he felt the sure, irresistible, slow current
setting towards her. There was one fatal dower
between them! Each time that he left them,
Clarice instinctively turned to Charlotte and eyed
her sternly. All the world might have heard
what he said; but Sam Rogers watched his mouth as
the words fell from it, as if they had been reptiles
he would have strangled. When he next came
across Parke, he said, in a voice whose accent of
ire and derision it would be impossible to describe,
"I wish the yellow cook of the Unicorn was here;
I'd introduce him to those wenches."</p>

<p>"Would you?" Parke answered, flipping his
glove; "how good of you!"</p>

<p>Sam went to Philippa.</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry," he said, "that we have
undertaken these parties; there is such a mess
here&mdash;cabin and forecastle mixed."</p>

<p>"I am sure it is a success; I never saw such
universal smiling before. What is the matter with
you, Sam? You look worried."</p>

<p>"I feel like a fish out of water. How I hate
these gloves. If you are pleased, it is all right; I
was afraid you would not like it. Parke is as head-strong
as the devil; look at him."</p>

<p>He was speaking again with the Langs, who had
never moved from the seats they had first taken.</p>

<p>"Oh, what do you mean, Sam?" and she looked
vexed; "don't you approve of his noticing those
poor girls?"</p>

<p>"<i>Noticing</i>&mdash;bah! you speak of him as if he were
a lord, going round among his vassals. I tell you
candidly, Philippa, if he does go to hell it won't be
all his own fault."</p>

<p>She bit her lips with furious anger.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty friend," she said. "Why not
let him alone, and give up the pretence of being
his Mentor?"</p>

<p>"Philippa, I am nobody's friend but yours; I
do not consider all Crest as being worth the snap
of my finger in comparison with you."</p>

<p>"Then you are Parke's friend, if you are mine."</p>

<p>"Bother Parke!"</p>

<p>She looked hurt.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Sam, but you are so foolish."</p>

<p>"Never mind about my forgiveness, give me
yours; I think I am rather foolish." And he
looked at her fondly and pitifully, cursing himself
inwardly for expecting her to understand him, or
anybody else, and promising himself to immolate
his opinions and acts, in just the way she would
have him. Her hand crept under his, and if they
had been alone she would probably have pulled
his hair, or pinched him. And so the quarrel
ended.</p>

<p>When Sarah heard that the Langs were at the
party she gave her shrillest laugh, and begged
Jason to learn to dance. Such things were in
accordance with his ideas. She never dreamed
that Parke was the means of their being invited.
Not the slightest uneasiness crossed her mind as
to the place they might attain; she knew the pride
and prejudice of the most humbly born of Crest
too well for that. Had she known, even, that
Parke had been good-natured enough to invite
them, she would have felt no concern beyond ridicule;
the spirit of society was too strong even for
his wilfulness to go beyond a certain point.</p>

<p>The next evening Parke took a walk in the
direction of Mrs. Lang's house. His splendid dog
"Bruno" went with him, and when they came
opposite her windows, Parke said to him, "Speak,
Bruno!" A deep yelp brought Charlotte to the
window of an unlighted room. Man and dog
passed slowly along and repassed, Bruno slouching
with his black head close to the ground, and Parke
firmly, with his fair face upturned to the window.
He saw a curtain move, that was all; but it made
his heart knock against his breast.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Langs made no second appearance at the
cotillon parties. At the next Parke zealously
danced with the prettiest girls in the room till ten
o'clock, when he disappeared, and returned in the
space of an hour, remarking, to those standing
near the entrance, that he had been taking the air
and a cigar. In connection with these were facts
which he did not mention. He went to the tavern
stable, where he knew there were saddled horses
which belonged to some of the party, and applied
to an ostler for one, telling him there was a mistake
about a card of invitation which must be rectified at
once. He gave the man a handful of cigars as he
made the request, and in a moment a horse was
let out, and he was on his way to Mrs. Lang's.
Arrived there, he fastened the horse to the palings
of the little yard, ran up the path, and knocked at
the door. It was opened by Mrs. Lang, holding a
lamp, and shading it with her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-evening to you," said Parke.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," she answered, intent on keeping
the lamp alight.</p>

<p>"Are your daughters at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Here, Clarice, Charlotte." And she
retreated, placing the lamp on the window-shelf of
the sitting-room, so that its rays fell across Parke
on the steps, glanced down the path, revealing the
black stalks of the hollyhocks, and the dark shape
of the horse tied to the paling. Clarice came out,
followed by Charlotte.</p>

<p>"I called," said Parke, in a polite voice, "to
inquire whether there was any mistake in your card
of invitation to-night."</p>

<p>"None at all," replied Clarice; "we decline
going."</p>

<p>She turned away abruptly, and vanished, but
Charlotte lingered.</p>

<p>"You left the party to come so far to inquire?"
she said, regretfully.</p>

<p>"It was my business, as manager, to do so."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir."</p>

<p>"You could not enjoy yourself much the other
evening, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she answered, plaintively, moving
forward, and bringing her face into the lamplight,
which revealed its pure, fragile, delicious outlines.</p>

<p>He shivered at the sudden sight so palpably, that,
to hide it, he exclaimed it was a cold evening.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for keeping you." But, instead of
making a move to return, she took another step
forward. "I feel the cold, too, sir; the change in
the climate is great; there is nothing warm here."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! something." And he advanced a step.
His silky mustache almost touched the band of hair
that fell low down her face.</p>

<p>"No," she repeated, "there is nothing of the
South here."</p>

<p>The thought of Philippa flashed into his mind.</p>

<p>"I have a cousin from the South."</p>

<p>"I saw her," she said, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"I must go; I shall be missed. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Did you ride up here?" she asked, discovering the horse.</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you like to ride?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"Some time will you ride with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" And she clapped her hands with
delight.</p>

<p>"You will see me soon then; good-night."</p>

<p>"Why did you stand and palaver with that young
man?" asked Clarice, when she returned.</p>

<p>"Why, Clarice!"</p>

<p>"He would not come in daylight."</p>

<p>"Yet you called him daring."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lang closed the hymn-book she had been
reading, and looked first at Clarice and then at
Charlotte.</p>

<p>"It is of no use," she said, "for you to fret
each other; give it up so. What one wants, the
other wouldn't have. I tell you to make the best
of every thing."</p>

<p>"The best!" said Clarice, with contempt.</p>

<p>"Alive or dead, you will stay in this place.
Make a way if you can. God Almighty knows I
am content."</p>

<p>"Mother," asked Clarice, "you had a white husband."</p>

<p>"Who tole you so?" she answered, with an indescribable
grimace.</p>

<p>"I asked you," screamed Clarice.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> brought you into the world, you are my
chil'n&mdash;bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, with all
your beauty."</p>

<p>"That's the curse of it."</p>

<p>"Devil's brat," cried her mother, "your father
will find his chile, sooner or later."</p>

<p>Charlotte, who had not uttered a word during
the scene, now rose and put out the light.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" her mother asked.</p>

<p>"We are all of a color now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lang shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p>"She beat you, Clarice; she do always."</p>

<p>Charlotte unbraided her long hair, which, in the
fire-light, even, looked silky and elastic, cautioned
Clarice about the fire, and glided from the room;
but Clarice immediately followed her, and Mrs.
Lang was left alone.</p>

<p>She carefully set up the firebrands against the
jambs, squatted on the hearth, thrust her feet in the
hot ashes, and talked to herself, breaking into a
laugh occasionally, and checking it with a "Bless
de Lord." Her head dropped on her knees, and
she slept, till a loud dash of rain startled her.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, the trade-wind blows,<br/>

Ha, ha, the good ship goes!"</p>

<p>she sang, feeling about the floor for the shoes she
had kicked off, to put on, and go to bed properly
before "dose girls."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

</div>

<p>TO keep up with the improvements in Crest
made in his absence, Sam Rogers, with an
ivory cane, made occasional excursions about
the town and suburbs. Crossing a field, one gray
December afternoon, to shorten the distance to an
unfrequented road which he wished to gain, he saw
a pair of horses which he knew, toiling up the hill,
and stopped behind the stone wall till they reached
the place where he stood, and passed. He saw Parke
in his light curricle, and Charlotte Lang beside
him. He noticed that the whip was in its rest, and
that only one of Parke's hands was employed in
driving; the reins hung loosely, and the horses
went to one side of the hill and then to the other,
as they chose. Sam looked after the carriage till
it rolled out of sight; then he sat down on
the wall, wiped his face with his handkerchief, and
said: "Damned strumpet&mdash;cursed fool&mdash;coward&mdash;knave!"
He sat there a long time, staring at
the hill, before he could make up his mind what
plan to follow.</p>

<p>That evening he made the tour of the stores
where men gathered to gossip over the events of
the day, and listened to them with jealous attention,
but heard nothing that he feared and half-expected
to hear concerning that chain of circumstances&mdash;a
link of which he had seen that afternoon.
The next morning he haunted the bar-room of the
tavern, the stable, the ship-yards, and wharves, and
made several calls among his female acquaintances,
but heard no mention of the fact which was
nearly breaking his heart. On all sides he was
accosted with raillery for his rare and unexpected
appearance. "You are getting tired of your aristocratic
friends," said one; and, "Have you had
too much of the Austers?" said another; and
"We were afraid you were going to give us up
and whaling," said a third. To all of which he
growled expletives more forcible than elegant.
On his way home he met Jason, and, suddenly
wheeling about, walked with him. Thrusting his
hands into his pockets, he fell into a deep study.
Jason was reminded of Mr. Ritchings's vagaries,
and wondered whether Sam, too, had not fallen a
victim to the same trouble. He made no effort
to break Sam's reverie, but walked beyond his
own house, and would have walked still farther,
if Sam had not suddenly looked up and struck
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"How are you, Jason?"</p>

<p>"I think, Sam, I am better than you are."</p>

<p>"I vow to God, I hope you'll keep so."</p>

<p>He wheeled round suddenly, left Jason without
another word, and went home to his dinner, which
he attacked with an absent-mindedness that
amazed and distressed his mother.</p>

<p>"You eat," she said, "but you do not set any
value on your food. I thought that apple-pie
would go to the right place. I put cinnamon in
it on purpose."</p>

<p>He immediately bit a large piece, but with an
expression which by no means satisfied her.</p>

<p>"I do believe you wish you were off to sea
again, and I am no better than the pelican in the
wilderness."</p>

<p>He laughed wildly.</p>

<p>"Any neighbors been in lately, mother?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jones, Tim's mother, was here yesterday,
after some carpet-rags."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She was so bound up in rags she couldn't think
of much else."</p>

<p>"A she Lazarus."

<p>"She <i>is</i> afflicted with a bad humor," Mrs. Rogers
said, solemnly.</p>

<p>He laughed wildly again, and she declared that
she shouldn't wonder if he was coming down with
the canker-rash&mdash;it was about.</p>

<p>"The Jones family live near those Langs, don't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Jones's house is the nearest; about
half a mile from it."</p>

<p>"She did not mention them, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, she did say that they kept themselves to
themselves, as they ought to; and she said, too,
that Mrs. Lang always washed on odd days of the
week, instead of Monday. She must have queer
ways, but I believe she is regular at the Baptist
meeting."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to have a tea-party
for me?"</p>

<p>"Law, Sam, I will any day."</p>

<p>"Some day this week?"</p>

<p>"Let me see, to-day is Tuesday&mdash;well, Friday,
say."</p>

<p>"Who shall we have&mdash;the Austers."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Ritchings."</p>

<p>"Of course. Did you ever ask Elsa Bowen to
tea, mother?"</p>

<p>"Many's the cup of hyson she and me have had
together in years gone by. What a hand with
sick folks she was! We used to go watching together;
I always thought she was all the more
lively in times of distress. She never goes out now,
and I don't see much of her."</p>

<p>"She never will forsake the Austers."</p>

<p>"Not on account of any trouble they may be in,
for she is so odd: she may go from some whim.
She is proud of her connection with them; you
know she was second cousin to Mrs. Maria Parke,
the Squire's second wife."</p>

<p>"You believe one person is as good as another,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much, unless they are Universalists."</p>

<p>"I am a Universalist."</p>

<p>"Don't let anybody know it in Crest. Take
your notions of salvation to the natives, if you
want to. Dear me, how can you believe that the
wicked ought to be saved?"</p>

<p>It seemed as if her discourse soothed him. He
smoked several pipes while she ran on, and his
countenance assumed its wonted expression of
tranquillity. For a moment he could not believe in
the reality of calamity. His mother's placid face,
the tones of her voice, so free from anxiety, denied
it for him. He remembered that she had passed
through trouble, but not a vestige remained. The
material atmosphere about was alone marked with
permanence; the most trivial objects outlasted the
heaviest affliction the heart could bear. There
were the brass candlesticks on the shelf, which had
been kept bright year in and year out, in the face
of disaster and death; and the eight-day clock,
with its dull, enameled face and gilt top; and the
chair-cushions of broadcloth patch-work were kept
in their old place, while millions of men had gone
mad with trouble, and out of life. The smell of
the old wood-work, the light from the green knots
in the old window-glass, the nameless sounds which
come and go where people live, which were associated
in his mind with events of the past, and had
survived them, assured him that in such things
alone existed perpetuity. The creaking of his
mother's old chair, in which she sat rocking, and
had rocked so many years, he listened to, and compared
it unconsciously to the creaking of the
cordage of his ship which went down, carrying with
her his shipmates, and leaving him with a solitary
boat, on such a day as this, when there was a
long, unbroken swell in the sea, with silvery reflections
from the pale, cold, angry sun. What did
the sea know of that event to-day! Its gulls
dipped into the swell with their gay scream, and
chased each other, with wildly flashing wings, over
its gray surface.</p>

<p>Early in the evening he went to Jason's, and sat
down to chess with Philippa. There was an unusual
bustle in the house, owing to some kitchen
anniversary. Elsa made frequent inroads into the
parlor, where they were, and Sarah frequent exits
from it. Great fires were burning, and lamps were
alight in all the rooms. The atmosphere was
exhilarating, fixed, secured, and Sam could not
help feeling comforted. As the evening advanced
quiet settled over the house. Sarah, fatigued,
rested silently in her chair by the fire. Jason sat
by himself over the dining-room fire, with his feet
on the fender, and his arms folded. Parke came
in, and with a nod to Sam, and "How are you,
shipmate?" seated himself by the piano, and
played, at first, a loud, triumphant march, full of
reiterated notes, and then a waltz, which opened with
a silvery trickle, deepened into a wild, rushing flow&mdash;a
chaos of tumultuous, broken, whirling foam, and
ended in a vague, solemn, unvarying swell. Sam's
sensibilities, excited again, traced the spirit of the
waltz, its wild cry for possession, its unappeased
longings, its wail of satiety, its necessity for the
eternal, and its despair.</p>

<p>Jason's pale face passed now the door, and repassed.</p>

<p>It was Philippa's turn to move, but the game had
stood still. Sam gave the board a shake, which
toppled the chess-men over, with noise enough to
rouse Parke from his musical dream. He left the
piano. Sam furtively searched his face, and saw
only the same tranquil, winning beauty. But
Parke's lids drooped over his eyes. Behind lay a
world, concerning which Milton invoked the
heavenly muse to  sing,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of man's first disobedience."</p>

<p>Parke drew a chair beside his mother's. He
smoothed her glossy, waving hair, turned the curls
over his fingers, asked her about the brooch which
fastened her collar, took her hand, and feared it
was hardened with too much work; she must not
do so much for them all. She met his eyes with a
smile, and he looked into hers, with an expression
she could not read, because for her "the handwriting
on the wall" was never visible. The kind
mood expanded and included Philippa, who yielded
to his irresistible sway. Could she have understood
his face and manner, there was that in them
which would have made her soul faint with pain.
An apprehensive chill struck Sam. He felt that
<i>danger</i> emanated from Parke's behavior. It betokened
the wakefulness of a faculty which had
roused all the faculties into play. It betokened
a farewell to the relations between him and his
mother&mdash;Philippa&mdash;all! A cowardly fear assailed
him lest Parke should envelop him too, and then,
with his infernal candor, show him the sword
oscillating over their heads.</p>

<p>"What has become of Jason?" he exclaimed,
starting up. "By the way, I am going to have a
tea-party. Will you all come, on Friday?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Sarah, "we will."</p>

<p>"Of course," Parke echoed, dreamily.</p>

<p>Sam passed quickly into the room where Jason
was, instead of leaving the house by the front door,
and spoke to him, listening for some movement
from Parke. He had gone to the piano again.
Relieved from his fear, Sam went into the kitchen,
hoping to get out unobserved, but Elsa and Mary
were still there.</p>

<p>He walked round the table and asked Elsa to
give him something to take home to eat&mdash;he was
starved.</p>

<p>"Gracious, Sam, if you don't like your mother's
cooking, I can't suit you."</p>

<p>"What's the news?" he asked, peering into her
acute face.</p>

<p>"I don't go about collecting the article.
Haven't you brought some? You look wise."</p>

<p>"Yes, the devil isn't dead."</p>

<p>"Is that news? Here, take this mince-pie, and
clear out with your devil. Bury him if you can."</p>

<p>He took the pie, with a laugh, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"He is bright," said Elsa to herself, "and good.
People don't know him as well as they think they
do. And his father was a stupid man, and his
mother is a stupid woman."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

</div>

<p>THOUGH Mrs. Rogers delayed tea on Friday
evening on Parke's account, he did not arrive
till the feast was in <i>d&eacute;bris</i>,  and the company
withdrawn from the tea-table to the parlor. He
had been out with his horses, he said, too late,
though the weather was excuse enough for driving
that afternoon, so mild and soft for a winter's day.
Had anybody noticed the sunset, and the silver
mist that wrapped everything in its veil, he asked.
At Mrs. Rogers's request, Philippa came back to
the table to keep him company while she was gone in
the kitchen preparing a hot short-cake for him, and
drawing fresh tea.</p>

<p>"How pale you are, Parke!" said Philippa.</p>

<p>"Am I?" he said, without looking at her.</p>

<p>"Where did you go to-day?"</p>

<p>"Up by Millville; do you know whether father
was in the woods to-day?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"I heard his dogs, I was sure."</p>

<p>He folded his arms on the table and hid his face
in them, but raised it instantly and stared into the
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"I thought," he continued, absently, "that they
sounded like bloodhounds."</p>

<p>"But you never heard bloodhounds."</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Once."</p>

<p>"Have you?" he repeated, without having
heard her, and instantly taking a knife from the
table, he struck an empty glass near him, and
endeavored to modulate the tinkling sound into a
familiar air with an appearance of profound attention;
but his mind was dwelling with rapt fidelity
on a new and terrible joy in his possession. The
secret was no burden now, but the source of a
pride, which made him feel apart from the rest of
the world by the right it had given him.</p>

<p>Philippa was moved by his paleness, lassitude,
and mysterious excitement; a protective, pitying
feeling impelled her to go to him, put her arm
about his neck, and kiss his cheek. As a city falls
to ruin, with its pulse in full play, in the embrace
of an earthquake&mdash;so fell his sin into the depths of
his soul. He met her clear, strong, upholding
gaze, because he <i>would</i> meet it; because, come
what might to him, he never could fail to meet the
eye of any human being with an unflinching daring
for the truth. But a shadow of something prophetic
fell on him; the loss of a beautiful hope,
which he might have had. To her it seemed as if
her touch had made him a statue, he was so motionless;
every feature was set in calmness, only his
eyes grew wildly dark. Her arm fell from his neck,
and she turned away, repenting of the first caress
she had ever given him.</p>

<p>Happily Mrs. Rogers bustled in with the fresh
tea. She begged Philippa to attend to his wants,
for she only wanted to take out the tea-cups&mdash;she
shouldn't wash them&mdash;and, with a pile in her
hands, she disappeared again. Philippa poured
the tea, which he took silently and drank slowly;
he ate nothing. When had he heard from Theresa,
she asked, to break the silence. That very day he
had received a letter, which he sorted out of some
papers and gave her, with "There's nothing in it."</p>

<p>"When shall I visit her?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Before long; any time."</p>

<p>"How long do you intend this meal shall last?"
asked Sam, thrusting his head in at the door. "I
must smoke a pipe."</p>

<p>"Come in, old fellow," said Parke "I'll smoke
with you."</p>

<p>Sam filled his pipe from a box on the mantel-shelf,
and was soon absorbed; Parke, taking a
cigar from his case, lighted it, and fell to talking
on the subject of Sam's next voyage. So pertinent
were his questions and remarks relating to it,
that Sam was drawn out completely, and gave
descriptions of sea-life, to which Parke added information
so entertaining that Philippa was oblivious
of the parlor, till recalled by an ill-humored
reproof from Sarah. He had made himself so
pleasant, that Sam, in a generous moment, accepted
the excuse he offered for going home without
appearing before the visitors. A plunge into
the long, black night was what Parke most desired&mdash;"a
sleep, and a forgetting."</p>

<p>It was hours, however, before he slept. His
sagacity stood in the way of repose. His relation
with the world&mdash;meaning Crest&mdash;must be changed,
sooner or later. He had lost Theresa. A barrier
was raised between him and Philippa which she
would never cross. Of his mother he did not
think; he had been so trained that the consequences
of his wishes and will never struck him as
involving any thing of her but her compliance.
<i>But</i>&mdash;he had gained Charlotte.</p>

<p>That evening Charlotte Lang found the house
deserted on the return from her ride with Parke;
her mother and sister had gone to the evening
meeting of the Baptist society which Mrs. Lang
had joined, and which was in the progress of a
revival. Charlotte did not light a lamp, but put
away her bonnet, folded her shawl, and crept to
bed in the dark. Did the angels of Pity and
Patience guard that bed? Or waited a demon
there, to behold the spectacle of dead chastity in a
lovely shrine? Who will summon either to pass
judgment upon a drama in which they were neither
actors nor spectators!</p>

<p>Ignorant, confiding, weak, poisoned with ancestral
blood, none shall judge thee, Charlotte&mdash;but
God!</p>

<p>Her thoughts were intent upon Parke alone.
To-day he had been hers; to-morrow he would be
hers. Mother, and Clarice, and the people in
Crest&mdash;he could keep them all away. Half stifled
in her exquisite hair, what dreams came to her!
She heard again the baying of dogs along the
woody road, the rustling of footsteps among the
leaves, the murmur of a sweet, muffled voice. The
gray dusk crept round her, and the silver mist, and
the breath of love; not a false, selfish, cruel love,
but the love for life, till death; sweet, kind, tender
love; forgetting all, meaning all&mdash;but distrust,
disgust, satiety.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

</div>

<p>THE winter passed. No shock or jar deranged
the machinery which society keeps in running
order, and which sometimes runs over society,
crushing, tearing, mutilating it. Even Sam Rogers
nodded in the vicinity of its wheels, and Parke
trifled with its cogs and springs, playing a desperate
game, to test it. Early in the spring, the
owners of the ship <i>Hesper</i> offered a captain's berth
to Sam Rogers, for an Arctic voyage, which he
accepted, and prepared to sail. The cotillon parties
ended in February, but a grand ball was projected
by Parke, which included Sam in his managerial
capacity. It was postponed several weeks,
on account of the severity of the weather. Spring
arrived, with snow, gales, and rain. As soon as
the sun softened the roads into decent traveling,
the night for the ball was appointed. Everybody
had been dull before, but now Crest was astir. A
thin blueness stole up the sky, and tinged the bay,
whose waters, released from the bondage of ice,
danced upon the shore in chopping billows and
hissing foam. The pools, which had stood in the
fields and ditches, sank through the mats of dead
grass, and the frogs began to croak in a circle
round the town. Garden paths grew smooth, and
garden patches mellow, in anticipation of the burst
of leaf and bud. Elsa said the weather had been
so bad, that she wondered why the Lord hadn't
started a grove of Ingy-rubber trees, so that people
might have the stuff for shoes at hand, to paddle
in the water with. It was the way things went in
this world;  she supposed that the trees grew
where it never rained nor snowed. Jason remarked
that he was sorry to have Nature lay down her
arms: he liked the music of her bands better than
the fiddles and horns at the hall. It was a pity,
she said, that he had not been born a wild Mohammedan,
so that he might have trained as he pleased,
and nobody been the wiser for it.</p>

<p>"After the ball, Philippa," said Parke, "we will
visit Theresa."</p>

<p>"After the ball," Sam commented, "I shall be
off, thank God, in the <i>Hesper</i>."</p>

<p>"After the ball," hoped Mr. Ritchings, "something
of the old time may come back."</p>

<p>"The ball is nothing to us, Charlotte," said
Clarice Lang. "Our privileges are the same."</p>

<p>"The same," Charlotte replied, with a conscious
smile; "it makes no difference whatever to
him."</p>

<p>"<i>Him</i>," said Clarice angrily; "I wish he would
not come this way so often. Have you but one
thought?"</p>

<p>"When was he here?" Charlotte asked, too
willing to talk on the dangerous subject.</p>

<p>"I believe he comes when we are away; I know
it, you poor, silly fool; he amuses himself
by showing you attention."</p>

<p>"Mind your own business, Clarice," said Mrs.
Lang, looking inquisitively at Charlotte. "It is
for you to attend to the concerns of your soul."</p>

<p>"Pooh, I go to meeting to kill time. What is
the use of my soul to me? No more than my
body is. Both are worthless."</p>

<p>Charlotte looked at Clarice with such an expression
of denial and doubt, intelligence and superiority,
that her mother, who was still observing her,
shook her head so violently that she attracted a
wondering attention from Clarice, who asked her
if she wasn't flared.</p>

<p>"Stay at home, then, you abominable," Mrs.
Lang cried.</p>

<p>"No," said Clarice firmly, "I wish to keep out
of the way."</p>

<p>"Dear me," exclaimed Charlotte peevishly,
"what way?"</p>

<p>"For all me, he shall have full swing; when
some other whim takes his idle brains, I'll give up
religion, as you have, and bear your whining and
pining till you get over it. A little of you will suffice
his vanity, you may be sure," said Clarice.</p>

<p>"We get over everything, we do," said Mrs.
Lang, giving to the winds whatever secret thought
disturbed her. Kicking off her shoes, as she did
in moments of excitement, she broke out with a
souvenir of the plantation:</p>

<p>"Pull up de yam two feet long;<br/>

Eat up de yam two feet long;<br/>

For de massa wants us strong;<br/>

What he wants is nebber wrong."</p>

<p>While Clarice reviled her, Charlotte cried bitterly.</p>

<p>The ball made a difference to them all. It
opened the door of discovery. Two of its guests,
from a town below Crest, named Clark and Cook,
made themselves obnoxious to Sam Rogers in the
early part of the evening, by telling him they were
on the look-out for a handsome girl, with a streak
of black, named Lang. "She may be coming,"
said Mr. Clark, "as she keeps company with the
manager, young Auster; we have seen them in
our village several times. I can't say as I blame
him; she is as pretty as a pink. Ain't they talked
about here?"</p>

<p>"What will you take to drink?" Sam asked
abruptly, longing to knock him down; "there's
something below."</p>

<p>"What will you take, Cook?" asked Clark,
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, anything that's round; beer, cider, lemonade,
or switchel."</p>

<p>"Switchel be damned!" cried Sam; "come
down-stairs."</p>

<p>If those fellows were only on board his ship,
he thought, he'd truss them by the throat with a
clew-line.</p>

<p>They were ushered by him into a small room at
the back of the hall, where, on a table, stood a
candle, a few tumblers, a sugar-bowl, and a bottle
that was empty.</p>

<p>"Somebody has availed himself of all the opportunity,"
Sam said. "Excuse me a few minutes,
I'll bring up a supply."</p>

<p>Clark and Cook begged him to take his time&mdash;they
liked a chance to cool off, and he started on a
run for Jason's.</p>

<p>"There's no watered liquor there," he muttered;
"I must chisel some brandy out of Elsa,
and drink those blackguards drunk."</p>

<p>He reached a back door breathless, and entering
on tiptoe, listened at the kitchen door&mdash;there was
no sound within; of course Elsa had gone to bed!
He must have the brandy, however; so he crept
up the kitchen stairs, opened the doors of several
dark rooms, and at last opened the door of her
room. She had on her night-cap, and was reading
aloud in the Bible when he entered, "Or the
golden bowl be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Broken," he said.</p>

<p>"What are you conjuring about here for?" she
asked, surveying him with composure; "to read
my Bible, and repent of your sins, sir?"</p>

<p>"Elsa, I want a bottle of that old Cognac; quick,
they sell poison at the tavern, you know."</p>

<p>"What do you want it for?"</p>

<p>"I've got a case at the hall&mdash;a brace of strangers
who will have liquor."</p>

<p>"You needn't come here with your braces; however,
I'll ask Sarah."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;don't torment me; I am in earnest."</p>

<p>She was out of the room with her candle, and
pretended to be uncertain where to find it.</p>

<p>"It is up garret, in a demijohn."</p>

<p>"I'll go for it."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it is down cellar, in a jug."</p>

<p>"Give me the candle; you are enough to make
the parson swear."</p>

<p>"There's a bottle in the buttery; now, I recollect
Sarah opened it yesterday, to give old Mr. Weaver
a gill. Now, old Mr. Weaver"&mdash;and she stopped
short.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weaver wove a yarn as long as yours,
which will be cut short, mam." He put his arm
round her waist, lifted her feet from the floor, and
carried her down into the buttery, where, after
some exploration, the bottle was found.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Elsa, we'll drink your health,"
he said, hurrying out.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," she soliloquized, on her
way back, "if he should look upon the wine that is
red. His father drank more than any man of his
age in Crest; he was full from morning till night."</p>

<p>"Shall I mix your grog, gentlemen?" he asked,
re-entering the room where Clark and Cook sat
drumming on the table, keeping time with the band
overhead. Looking at each other, they said they
didn't think they needed it strong&mdash;they were not
used to it&mdash;but that they might be as well hanged
for a sheep as a lamb. He poured brandy enough
in each glass to make a green hand madly drunk,
mixed sugar in it, and handed it to them. It was
taken with "my respects," and winking eyes, together
with a declaration that it was "first-rate
swipes."</p>

<p>"Now for a jig," exclaimed Sam, with an air of
high satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Jig it is, and with the beauties, <i>if</i> you please."</p>

<p>Partners were found for them, and places in the
dance. Sam stood in the vicinity, to watch for the
first symptoms of intoxication, for drunkenness in
the ballroom should be put down with a high hand.
The heat of the room, the noise and the motion,
he calculated could not be borne many minutes. But
to his surprise, when the quadrille was over, they
came to him, and asked how the bottle stood.</p>

<p>"Where we left it; come, try luck again."</p>

<p>"If it is all the same to you."</p>

<p>The dose was increased and repeated; its effect
was sudden. Sam immediately proposed going
over the way to the tavern, to have a smoke. An
assent with a hooray was given, and without hat or
overcoat the party rushed over, and Sam piloted
the way into an empty room.</p>

<p>"Norr cigars," said Mr. Clark, who felt poorly
in his head; "something strong&mdash;fetch on pipes
and some niggerhead."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Sam, locking them in as he
went out, and returning in a moment.</p>

<p>"Speaking of niggerhead," remarked Mr. Cook,
who had seated himself on two chairs, and was
poising his head on the sharp slat of a third,
"Where <i>is</i> that Lang girl? I didn't see young
Auster round, either&mdash;taking a walk in the suburbs,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Let it all out, you white-livered wretch," said
Sam, furiously. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"'Mong frens, you know," said Mr. Clark,
placably.</p>

<p>"By George," answered Mr. Cook, "you had
better be milder, it would be good for you. Your
town will have news soon that will run like wildfire,
and your sprig Auster, with his damn airs,
will have a hyst."</p>

<p>"Damn," Mr. Clark repeated.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook bent forward and whispered in Sam's
ear, lost his balance, and fell on the floor, where he
went to sleep. Sam looked at Mr. Clark, who was
trying to smoke a pipe with the bowl downward,
and vainly igniting lucifer matches on his boot-soles,
his cuffs, his knees, and the carpet.</p>

<p>"You'll do," said Sam.</p>

<p>"We'll do," replied Mr. Clark. "Thank you&mdash;you'll
<i>do</i> to-morrow."</p>

<p>Before noon the next day, despite Sam's precaution,
an intangible rumor spread over town. It
was not traced to any particular source, no one
dared to meddle with it at first, but Rumor is an
"insane root"&mdash;once partaken of, its madness
grows. From "Have you heard?" the step was
taken which confirmed the truth of the connection
between Parke and Charlotte. In common with
every soul in Crest, with the exception of the
Auster family, Sam heard all the gossip. Parke
Auster's good name bit the dust. The most grovelling
details accompanied the descriptions of Charlotte
Lang's beauty and gentle manners. If the
blow had fallen&mdash;as the feeling and the tongue of
the public would, in the first flush of detection,
have had it fall&mdash;on the family, it would have
crushed Sarah and Philippa, but tongue and feeling
were soon exhausted, and the family were still in
ignorance. Sam went to Jason's every day with
the heart of a culprit. He looked into the faces of
each one for some inspiration to direct him what
course to pursue&mdash;how to temper the awful fact.
None came. The <i>Hesper</i> demanded his time, was
the excuse he gave for making his visits so short,
and for avoiding Parke. But one evening, when
Philippa had begged him for a farewell game of
chess, they met.</p>

<p>"Your last games?" asked Parke.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam answered.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind to go on the voyage with you."</p>

<p>"Better stay here."</p>

<p>The tone of his voice was so significant, that
Parke went round to the back of Philippa's chair
and mutely interrogated him. He returned the
look with one eloquent with contempt.</p>

<p>Parke quietly took a chair near him, and waited
till the game was finished, and he had risen to go.
When the outside door was reached, Parke laid his
hand on the latch, stood before him, and said,
"You have heard something."</p>

<p>"Let me pass," demanded Sam, with a husky
voice; "let me pass, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it won't be worse with me if you stay.
Sam, you know it all."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I imagine the town knows it."</p>

<p>"Everybody."</p>

<p>"Do they know," he spoke with an accent that
made Sam's blood run cold, "that I shall marry
Charlotte Lang?"</p>

<p>"Now, by God, Parke, you shall not do it! You
must not, cannot do it! Nature is against it&mdash;the
whole race!"</p>

<p>"I am a little old-fashioned, Sam; she is the
mother of my child, Parke Auster's child! Has
the town mentioned that fact yet?"</p>

<p>His tone of self-disgust, resolution, dogged daring,
and his air of painful <i>ennui, blas&eacute;</i>, suffering, are
not to be described.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll see you to-morrow; there's a man waiting
for me now, about a chronometer. Good-by.
How could you? If she hadn't been&mdash;damme,
give me your hand!"</p>

<p>Parke was crying now like a baby in Sam's arms.
He wiped his own eyes, moved from one foot to
the other, swore at the world, and everything in it,
and finally led Parke into his room, and sat up the
whole night with him.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

</div>

<p>ELSA was looking for clothes-pins that had
strayed in the greensward at the upper end of
the orchard, the next morning, when she saw Mrs.
Rogers nodding to her to come up to the fence,
the boundary between the road where she was walking
and the orchard.</p>

<p>"I am just passing along," said Mrs. Rogers.
"How be you these days, Elsa Bowen?"</p>

<p>"I am so as to be able to look after the odds
and ends; how have you been, Betsy? I haven't
set eyes on you this winter."</p>

<p>"As tough as a pine knot, or I couldn't stand
what I am obleeged to. Why don't you go out once
in a while, and keep up with what's a-going? You
might be astonished sometimes at what you'd see
and hear."</p>

<p>"See fools, and hear clack."</p>

<p>"It isn't always clack, though I'm not so sure
about the fools."</p>

<p>"What's in the wind now?"</p>

<p>"I do suppose your folks have heard nothing
about themselves, have they? I do wish Mr.
Ritchings had spoken to Jason before now."</p>

<p>"What is it, for mercy's sake?"</p>

<p>"Charlotte Lang, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elsa stooped suddenly, and clutched a clothes-pin,
bringing up with it a handful of grass.</p>

<p>"And Parke&mdash;they say there's something wrong
between them."</p>

<p>"It is a vile lie. Who says so? Where are <i>they</i>
who says it?"</p>

<p>"Now, Elsa, it is no use; the whole town knows
it. <i>Sam</i> knows it&mdash;he told me last night&mdash;and he
said, 'God help Philippa.'"</p>

<p>"God help his mother. What is it to Philippa?
It can't be so, Betsy."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rogers convinced her that it was so,
by relating all the particulars, and concluded with,
"That girl ought to be drummed out of town."</p>

<p>"The hussy!"</p>

<p>"You have got to tell the family; nobody can
do it better. There, don't take on so. I knew you
would, you faithful, attached creetur; perhaps <i>all</i>
of it isn't true, after all. I knew I must tell you.
Providence sent you out this morning for clothes-pins,
and me to buy blue yarn, so that we might
meet. I didn't see my way clear at first; I
thought of going to Sarah. I'd rather face
the cannon's mouth than her. She'll die, or she'll
carry it off with the high Parke hand. Didn't my
old man know what that was&mdash;steel springs covered
with satin; though I must say Sarah ain't
so smooth. You ain't offended with me, Elsa, for
throwing such a burden on you? 'Tis time something
happened&mdash;you ought to be expecting it;
think how long the family have prospered every
way. I must be getting along. Do take something
when you go in. Think of my Sam's going
into icebergs for four year."</p>

<p>"Sam is a credit to you, Betsy," said Elsa, with
a strong effort to resume her natural manner.</p>

<p>"But he is a man. You can't trust one, you
know. You never can guess the moment he will
fail you, and never the one he won't."</p>

<p>Elsa's search in the grass continued a few minutes
after Mrs. Rogers had passed on, but she saw
nothing there; her thoughts were fixed on the task
before her. There was no avoiding it. Parke's
death she could communicate, but to be the bearer
of such tidings put her to her trumps. She vowed
never to be in such a scrape again; she would keep
her eyes open for the future. She must be getting
forgetful and stupid, or she would have been on the
look-out for his sowing his wild oats. Yes; if
ever the shadow of what must be called living
trouble fell on the family again, she should cut and
run. She was willing, if need be, to bury every one
of them; but she could not stand the wear and tear
of disgrace and misery.</p>

<p>"Though the day of judgment is at hand," she
concluded, "dinner must be seen to, cooked, and
eaten." And she went back to the house. Every
thing through the morning was finished in her
thorough, methodical manner, but she was inwardly
debating how she should begin her story, and with
whom. Once her heart failed her. It was when
Sarah came into the kitchen to show her the new-fashioned
plaits in the bosom of some shirts she
was making for Parke.</p>

<p>"What if I should not say a word about it?"
Elsa asked herself, with her eyes raised above her
spectacles, examining the work. "It might blow
over in time, and finally come to her ears like a
spent storm. But no; some blundering booby
would give them all a shock, and they would expose
themselves to the public."</p>

<p>"Very handsome, indeed, Sarah," she said,
aloud, "but a great deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that for him, you know."</p>

<p>Here was a chance! Elsa wet her lips, caught
her breath, and&mdash;allowed Sarah to go out
without speaking a word.</p>

<p>"That villain, Parke," she exclaimed, "he ought
to be sent to State's prison&mdash;sentenced to hard
labor for his lifetime. It all comes from his having
nothing to do. How could he help having
riches left to him, though? How could he help
taking after one or two of his relations? Poor
boy!" And she cried to herself softly, wiping the
tears away under her glasses as fast as they came,
till Jason's entrance interrupted their flow. He
took a seat in the corner of the hearth, and lighted
a cigar, which Elsa thought was just the thing to
forward her purpose. Taking a basket from the
window-shelf, she sat down near him, and began to
sort its contents and study its aspect, and the probable
effect upon him of what she was about to say.
It never struck her till now how stern and upright
a look he wore. There was a certain hard, cool air
about him, which convinced her that he would go
and knock Parke down, as soon as he had heard
her story. She instinctively penetrated his view
of the case, which would be to side with Charlotte
Lang. He would take her wrongs into full consideration.
That would be awful. Still, she must trust
to his sense, which was the best she knew of.</p>

<p>"Have you been round to the stores this morning?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"What upon earth should I go to the stores for,
unless sent by you on some small errand?"</p>

<p>"Your might hear something, you know."</p>

<p>Her trepidation was painful. She thought he
would comprehend instantly something of the
truth, and it was a great relief to hear him answer:
"Elsa, what do I want to hear the gab of the stores
for?"</p>

<p>"I know you don't." And she laughed almost
hysterically. It was impossible for her to tell him.</p>

<p>"I have been on board the <i>Hesper</i>, though. She
hauled down the bay early this morning. I can't
imagine why I didn't take to the sea."</p>

<p>"It is too late, now. Are you tired of comfort,
Jason?"</p>

<p>"Comfort is tedious when it lasts too long."</p>

<p>At that instant Gilbert called Jason away, and
Elsa was glad of it. At dinner she lingered with
Sarah over a cup of tea. when the rest had left
the table and gone.</p>

<p>"Sarah Auster," she exclaimed suddenly "you
are nothing but skin and bone! You must take
medicine. The least wind would blow you
away."</p>

<p>"It's my business whether I am skin and bone
or not," she replied crossly. "I am well enough,
and shan't take medicine."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. I don't recommend anything
at all; but you are sick, you know you are."</p>

<p>The clatter of dishes which Elsa rather resentfully
made drove Sarah from the table, and Elsa
remarked to herself that perhaps their sorrows had
only just begun. Something certainly ailed Sarah,
and none of them had perceived it. She took a
desperate resolve, and went to Philippa's room and
found her embroidering a cushion.

<p>"Philippa Luce, you might as well know it as
anybody."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then," replied Philippa, calmly sticking
her needle in the canvas.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rogers told me this morning that Sam
told her last night that it was all true. It is all
over town&mdash;everybody knows it."</p>

<p>"I don't know it yet."</p>

<p>Elsa turned her back to Philippa, and began to
dust the shelf with her apron.</p>

<p>"Charlotte Lang has made mischief."</p>

<p>"Well," said Philippa, rising like an automaton.</p>

<p>Still dusting the articles on the shelf, Elsa told
the tale. Philippa was so still that she turned to
look at her. She was chewing a bit of silk floss,
and her eyes were fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>"And," continued Elsa, "<i>you</i> have got to tell
Jason and Sarah."</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, Philippa!"</p>

<p>"I never will speak of it to one human being&mdash;unless
it be to Parke, or," she added, with a frightful
hauteur, "to that slave."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Elsa, "she is Parke's slave, and you
know it. But whose slave will be Parke's child,
with your blood in its veins?"</p>

<p>"That will do," said Philippa, shuddering with
disgust.</p>

<p>"No, it won't do, Philly; don't feel so. Don't
you know human nature?"</p>

<p>"No." And she looked away from Elsa, out of
the window. The world seemed stretching round
her a wide, flat, lonely plain, over which she must
plod by herself, for she had no "human nature"
like this. An acute vision of Parke's abandonment
to a wild, isolated happiness, such as she
knew <i>he</i> could enjoy, passed before her mind, and
for an instant she felt his utter separation from her.
But not even this glimpse into the abyss of passion
suggested the idea of renouncing him. It created
a barrier against her which filled her soul with
hatred, but not with despair.</p>

<p>"We are punished for human nature, though,"
said Elsa; "and what will his punishment be?"</p>

<p>"In what he makes me suffer."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Elsa, ironically, "it will be
no injury to his mother, of course. And the pride
of the Parkes won't be taken down in Crest! The
last of them has exceeded all the evil-doers of the
name."</p>

<p>Philippa had not thought of Sarah. She had
thought of no one besides herself. But now she
asked what Jason would do.</p>

<p>"He won't have a breach of promise case, I assure
you."</p>

<p>With an inward trembling Philippa resumed her
embroidery, and, like Imogen,</p>

<p>"Pricked her fingers every stitch,<br/>

And left in every bud a stain."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Enough said, at present," she answered in a
loud, cheery voice. "I've got plenty to do, and
I'll go and do it. I'll wash my hands, just now,
of everybody's business but my own."</p>

<p>Philippa threw down her work, and with locked
hands and a rigid face turned the matter over in
her mind. She determined to show no emotion
before Jason and Sarah, let come what would.
Neither for any one, nor in any cause which pertained
to that unhappy affair, would she change
one habit, intention, or plan. She was somewhat
shaken when she went down-stairs, and met Parke
in the hall, and exclaimed involuntarily, "I know
it all&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>His hand was on her mouth.</p>

<p>"Not a word shall pass between us," he said.
"Never, Philippa. Cross the gulf in silence, or let
it be impassable."</p>

<p>The nervous pressure of his hand against her
mouth subdued her; she stood still and dumb,
with her eyes averted. His hand fell, and he bent
forward to look at her; the sight gave him a curious
sensation of pain and surprise. She was evidently
in an inward fury; he noticed her strange
eyes&mdash;the spots in them seemed alive&mdash;her scarlet,
burning lips, and her waving, vivid hair; he thought
of the "Sphinx" again, and wondered if Theresa
would not give her the name of Pythoness now.</p>

<p> I am going to Theresa, to-morrow," he said,
gently.</p>

<p>A faintness came over her, which she struggled
against. She grew so pale that he extended his arm
to catch her, but she caught hold of the balusters
for a support, and then raised her eyes to his face
so full of mad resolution and defiance that he forgot
it was Philippa.</p>

<p>"Say adieu," he said haughtily, "and kiss me."</p>

<p>She struck him so violently in the face that he
was blinded, and could not see her as she ran upstairs
again.</p>

<p>While he was gone on his visit to Theresa, Sam
Rogers sailed on his voyage to the Arctic seas. It
was between daylight and dark when he went to
Jason's to say farewell, the day before his departure.
He hoped no lamp would be lit;  he would rather
not see their conscious faces, for he supposed that
Jason had heard the truth. After a hurried chat,
he rose to shake hands.</p>

<p>"I have got to row off in a hurry, after all.
Shall I bring you an Esquimaux waiting-maid,
Philippa, or a reindeer?"</p>

<p>Their hands were grasped tightly, there was no
need of words.</p>

<p>"You'll never see <i>me</i> again," said Elsa, half jocosely,
half sorrowfully; "I am going to step
out."</p>

<p>"Who will step in your shoes, Elsa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, plenty."</p>

<p>"Elsa wants to be coaxed to live," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Live, I entreat you," he begged, and bending
over her, whispered a few words in her ear.</p>

<p>"I promise," she answered.</p>

<p>Sarah took his hand in hers, and looked at him
sadly.</p>

<p>"Four years is a long time, Sam; but I do not
know that we should doubt them, any more than
we doubt to-day. I am truly sorry to lose you."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Mrs. Auster. All hands, good-by.
I shall meet Jason outside." And waving his
hat, he dashed out. Philippa had already disappeared.
As the gate swung to after him, he saw
her standing under the firs, in the corner he must
pass. There was too much light still for him to escape,
or he would have rushed by, feigning not to see her.</p>

<p>"You sent no message to Parke," she said,
quietly, when he reached her.</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, carelessly, "I said my last
words to him."</p>

<p>"Will you send your love to him?"</p>

<p>"My love isn't worth sending to man nor
woman."</p>

<p>"You lie, Sam; it is worth sending to both."</p>

<p>"Ha! you begin to appreciate my immense
goodness."</p>

<p>"May I tell Parke, I ask, that you sent him your
love?"</p>

<p>"Tell him what you please. Give me one kiss,
Philippa?"</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe and met his lips; then
tapped him on the shoulder, with a nod which sent
him on his way smiling and sighing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

</div>

<p>WITHIN sight of the <i>Hesper's</i> sails, as she
bore down the bay next morning, Philippa
started on a walk, in the hope of finding something
on the earth, or in the air, to culminate or
dissipate her mood. Charlotte Lang also wandered
forth aimlessly, and they met in a cross-road,
beyond the town, which was bordered on both
sides by a thicket, bursting into leaf, and alive
with the songs of birds. Charlotte was gathering
violets along the edge of the thicket when Philippa
saw her.</p>

<p>"She can think of flowers," Philippa observed.</p>

<p>"There comes Philippa Luce," thought Charlotte,
bending close to the ground. Philippa
stopped in the path, like a soldier ordered to
halt.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she called.</p>

<p>Charlotte turned and, held up a handful of violets;
her hair, blown about her face, her languid,
wistful eyes, the faint color rising in her cheeks&mdash;she
was the picture of a sad, lovely Innocence.
"Will you have them?" she asked, in a singularly
melodious voice, with a childish treble in its
accent, slowly approaching. Philippa's eyes so
filled with dazzling beams that crashed down from
her brain, that for a moment Charlotte looked a
dark, vague shape, whose coming overpowered her
with hate and horror; but when she saw more
clearly, and saw the composure with which Charlotte
stood before her, an irritation like madness
possessed her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked harshly.</p>

<p>"You spoke to me, and I answered."</p>

<p>"I would have died first," said Philippa,
incoherently, and stamping her foot with a measured
thud on the ground. "Do you know the misery
you have made?"</p>

<p>Charlotte looked at her earnestly: "<i>You</i> would
have died. <i>I</i> wanted to live."</p>

<p>The maddening vision of a happiness which she
had had no part in, and could have no part in with
<i>Parke</i>, again rose before Philippa's mind.</p>

<p>The violets fell to the ground one by one.</p>

<p>"Could you 'live' no other way than by going
out of your place? You are not his equal."</p>

<p>"That is your way of thinking," Charlotte answered
with a sullen frown. "He came after me,
remember. I never asked anything of him. I
never shall. Why didn't you keep away from me?"</p>

<p>Philippa turned scarlet from the most womanly
feeling she ever had.</p>

<p>"But," continued Charlotte, "I act according to
his wishes. He governs me."</p>

<p>"Insensible, heartless, beastly African?"</p>

<p>Limpid tears dropped from Charlotte's eyes, as
pure as the fresh violets at her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, where is he?" she moaned.</p>

<p>A sound of wheels made them look round, a
chaise was coming down the road, with Sarah in it,
who was returning from some business concerning
the Dorcas Society: the floor of the chaise was
covered with bundles of work, and Gilbert was
driving it. His quick eye caught sight of the
girls, and he tried to pass before Sarah could discover
them.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Mrs. Lang's girl?" she asked.
"What can Philippa be speaking to her for?"</p>

<p>"I bleeve so," he answered, adroitly tickling the
horse to make it jump, and it went by the girls on
the leap. "Peers to me that's Mr. Auster's boat, off
the ledge there; do you s'pose he is coming back
from the <i>Hesper,</i> marm? Do tell me if you see
her sails yet, bearing off the light? I see Mrs.
Rogers about an hour ago; her eyes were bunged
up with crying."</p>

<p>She stretched her head to follow the motion of
the boat, and Gilbert said to himself that they
had had a pretty close shave of it to ride by <i>that</i>
danger.</p>

<p>Charlotte exchanged glances with Philippa when
she recognized Sarah, and an expression of painful
dismay passed over face.</p>

<p>"I wish," she cried, "that I might never set
eyes on any of you again."</p>

<p>"Amen."</p>

<p>"I wish he would take me, and go with me to
the everglades."</p>

<p>"Wish to be dead," said Philippa sternly.</p>

<p>"I won't," she answered, with a pretty, petulant
shrug; "you needn't think it. I am strong
enough to bear everything. But"&mdash;with an assumption
of dignity&mdash;"I forgive you, Miss Luce,
for your wish. Why, what is the chaise coming
back for?"</p>

<p>Philippa surmised the fact that Gilbert had been
sent to bring her home. He reined the horse
beside her with so careless and contemptuous a
disregard for Charlotte's place in the path, that
the wheels grazed her dress; she was not mindful
of his sneering face, for she was observing the
horse&mdash;an old friend. One more effectual word
Philippa longed to say, which, through Charlotte,
might pierce Parke like an arrow and cut like a
sword; but it was an emergency she had no
weapons for. She parted from her without even a
last look.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Gilbert, shaken from his stolidity
and respectful reserve; "things have come to
such a pretty pass that I think we might as well
shut up shop to our house&mdash;give up the ghost and
call it square. <i>I</i> haven't got the leastest mite of
ambition or courage left in me. To this day Mrs.
Auster hasn't found it out. What's to be done?
It must not go on so. Are they going to be
allowed to carry on so, Miss Philippa, and the
family not know it? God bless me, <i>you</i> know it.
I presume that gal was making complaint to you."</p>

<p>"Hush, Gilbert," said Philippa, much distressed,
"Wait; something will be done. You must not
put your mind upon it so."</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, with dignity. "We
are all demeaning ourselves by acting in this way."</p>

<p>It was as bitter a moment as she had endured.
Gilbert was right, but his making common cause
with her as a matter of principle, was most galling
to her pride. That he had made himself the
mouthpiece of the sense and the rights of a moral
community, her soul rebelled against. She would,
if possible, so isolate her family from its influence
and opinions, that even their vices should not be
meddled with.</p>

<p>Parke came home that day with the dash and
flavor of travel about him. At the tea-table he
gave a lively account of his meeting with a college
chum who had just returned from Germany. His
recapitulation of the stories of German life was so
entertaining, he so thoroughly entered into their
spirit, that Philippa felt as if the old atmosphere
was obliterated. He was a spectacle to Elsa, who
every moment, since her interview with Mrs.
Rogers, considered herself as walking over a volcano.
"There's something more than human in
him," she thought; "nothing will beat him down."</p>

<p>"I wish we could stay in Germany," said Philippa,
absently.</p>

<p>"By the way," exclaimed Sarah, "what were
you saying to Charlotte Lang this morning?"</p>

<p>Philippa made no answer, but fixed her eyes
upon Parke, who suddenly felt in his pocket for
his handkerchief. Elsa glided from the room without
a sound, and stationed herself before the door
to prevent ingress.</p>

<p>"The time has come&mdash;I saw it in Philippa's eyes,
and now Master Parke is going to walk on the
edge of the burning ploughshare." She spoke,
unconsciously tucking up her wristbands, as if she
contemplated being called upon to participate in
the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> when it should be at its height.</p>

<p>An ominous silence prevailed at the table. Sarah,
astonished at Philippa's not replying to her, looked
up, and, following the direction of her gaze, saw
that in Parke's face and manner which startled and
perplexed her; but Jason, looking from one to the
other, divined some evil he would rather not know
of; he rose, and opened the door to find Elsa pacing
to and fro before it like a sentinel. She waved
him back, and pushed  the  door against him so
resolutely that he turned and dropped into a chair
beside it. Philippa's eyes were still fixed on Parke
with a growing light, which to him seemed to
spread over all the room; but he bore her gaze
like a man, and it clinched the purpose he had
brooded over.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, at last, "what could Philippa
have to say to her? Imagine?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, my son, I can't," she entreated, in a
stifled voice, for she felt appalled at Philippa's face.</p>

<p>"It is probable that she reproached her; the
virtuous woman, you know, is not only so for herself,
but for the whole sex."</p>

<p>"Charlotte Lang is&mdash;what then?" asked Sarah,
her nostrils white and rigid.</p>

<p>"What she is, mother, <i>I</i> have made her; and,
as her cup of disgrace is full, so is mine, and I shall
drink it."</p>

<p>Jason sprang from his chair, with a deep oath,
and stood beside him like a tower.</p>

<p>"To the dregs, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"You understand me. Would you like to strike
me, father?"</p>

<p>"It is too late," he answered, regarding Philippa
mournfully; but she would not meet his eyes, and
turned her head from him.</p>

<p>"What's too late?" snapped Sarah.</p>

<p>Parke put a cigar in his mouth without lighting
it, twisted it apart, and, after a moment, said:
"I do not pretend to give an account of myself.
I do not know what I expected in the beginning
of this business; so far, perhaps, I have done
just as other men do; but, mother, I am going to
marry Charlotte Lang.  Not a word against it.
You may call it dregs, honor, obstinacy, or love.
It must be."</p>

<p>Sarah literally obeyed him; her composure was
so strange that Parke lost his presence of mind.
He walked up and down the room, and sobbed like
a woman; her eyes followed him, rolling in her
head, turned to stone. He threw himself on his
knees before her, and buried his face in the folds
of her dress.</p>

<p>"Don't," she said, in the voice of one waking
from a dream; "lift up your face, I am your
mother&mdash;not Philippa, not Jason&mdash;I forgive you."</p>

<p>"No, mother, I do not ask that; but I have
killed you."</p>

<p>"Philippa," she cried, angrily, "where are you?
Why have you no feeling? What passes through
your mind?"</p>

<p>"Sarah," said Jason, in a voice of thunder, "let
our girl alone."</p>

<p>"Eh," she uttered with a smile at Parke, as
if there had just been effected a bargain which
divided him, Philippa, and Jason, from herself.
Parke was hers only.</p>

<p>Philippa did not heed what was passing. She
was trying to analyze her personality, which, so
worthless to others, proved of so much value to
herself, that out of it she had built a strong edifice,
just fallen to ruin. Parke raised his tear-stained
face, and Sarah addressing Philippa said:</p>

<p>"Go to Mrs. Rogers for me, will you, and ask
her if she will come over to-morrow? She must be
lonesome without Sam. Go quick!" she ordered,
with rising irritation; "it is late."</p>

<p>Philippa rose slowly, and left the room. Jason
went out by another door immediately, and confronted
Elsa.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>"How long have you known this?"</p>

<p>"A few days. Money will settle it, Jason."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What will, you foolish man?"</p>

<p>"He is going to marry her."</p>

<p>"Cat's-foot, Jason; you are as mad as a March
hare to let him do it. Make him wait a while, and
he will give it up; he is remorseful now, and
frightened."</p>

<p>"Not frightened; he is brave, Elsa."</p>

<p>"You can't affirm that you believe he ought to
marry her!"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me; I don't know. Keep your eye
on Sarah; she has had an awful blow."</p>

<p>"Yes, the hardest one."</p>

<p>Breaking away from her, he wandered far away
that night, and the burden of his thoughts was:
"It was the deed of my own son; but, of all men,
<i>I</i> should forgive him."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

</div>

<p>A COOL note from Parke announced to Mr.
Ritchings his wedding-day, and engaged him
to perform the ceremony in his study, on a certain
evening. When he received the application, which
from his position he could not refuse, he fell into
a revery, which ended by his taking his hat,
walking over to Jason's, and asking for Philippa.
He half expected to feel a shock, to see some
change, when she entered the room, but her impassive
countenance was the same. She met his
conscious manner with one so imperturbable, that
he would have felt disconcerted if he had not come
with a purpose nothing could shake. He carefully
reviewed the period of their past acquaintance, and
then made her an offer of his future, promising to
consecrate it to her happiness. She declined it.
He made a resolute attempt at reasoning with her,
but she remained obstinately silent. He set before
her his ideas of the basis of a true marriage, and
she merely smiled in an absent way, as if her
thoughts were elsewhere. He left with a burning
heart, and an undesired sense of freedom. It was
certainly all over between them now, and the world
was all before him to teach him how to love anew.
When he woke the next morning he felt the loss of
his forlorn hope, and started upon his duties, cold
and spiritless. Even Philippa felt the end of an
episode which connected her with love, in one
heart, at least. For a moment she was mindful of
the generosity which prompted Mr. Ritchings to
come to her when under the cloud of disgrace; but
she forgot it, to count the days to Parke's wedding,
for Mr. Ritchings had told her of the appointment.
She wondered why he waited a day;&mdash;there could
be no bridal array for Charlotte! How would
they look side by side, he holding her hand and
she his, in the what-God-hath-joined-together-let-no-man-put-asunder
bond? The bond of perpetuation!
What would her father, Osmond Luce,
have said had he been present in the family conclave
when Parke declared his resolve! She
blushed at the thought that he might have laughed
at their feeble resistance&mdash;their patient yielding to
his will. Perhaps had her father been there he
might have influenced him; she recalled the incident
of their mutual fondness when she first came
to Crest, of Parke's clinging to him, and begging
him to return&mdash;while she sat aloof, silent and
neglected. That they were something alike, she
reflected for the first time; she had never dreamed
of thwarting or disputing her father's will;&mdash;how
should she have been so infatuated as to imagine
she could bend and subdue Parke?</p>

<p>After the day was appointed for the marriage,
Jason and Parke were closeted for several days.
During that time Parke made his will, but asked
Jason not to read it, who was so troubled at the
fact that he informed Philippa, not daring to tell
Sarah.</p>

<p>"If he has made his will he is going away,"
Philippa said.</p>

<p>"That is it; why did I not think of it?"</p>

<p>She rejoiced in the idea. "He would never
think of living with Charlotte Lang!"</p>

<p>"He will be a wanderer," continued Jason, sadly,
"all his life."</p>

<p>"It is far better so, Jason."</p>

<p>"I can not believe it; why do you think so?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he saw into her feelings.</p>

<p>"Shame on your want of generosity, Philippa!
Are not your own feelings deep enough for him for
you to have some mercy on hers?"</p>

<p>"I have no mercy on her miserable weakness."</p>

<p>"I believe," he said simply, "that I shall end in
hating your sex."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; for I shall stay here always with you.
And you can not shake me off."</p>

<p>His expression changed.</p>

<p>"I have no hope of your happiness here&mdash;but
you are so young yet. Could you really have been
my daughter, the idea of a lifetime in this atmosphere
would be a different one to you."</p>

<p>"There's nothing of the Bedouin in my composition.
I could not be, happy, I think, to go from home
under any circumstances. I am like lichen&mdash;a
thin crust, but a permanent one."</p>

<p>"But you will accompany Parke. Your soul and
the soul of his mother will grow round him where-ever
he is; and if you do not know that, you will
raise a tabernacle for him, where your brightest,
best self will center."</p>

<p>How strangely he was speaking of <i>their</i> following
Parke! Had he no interest in him? she
thought. But had it not been so always? She
could look back to years of indifference on Jason's
part.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered thoughtfully, "how
much my soul could gather round anything foreign
to Crest. When I say Crest, I mean our own
surroundings, you know; lately my vision narrows
to these walls, our acres, each rock and tree,
the sea before the house, the sky over it. Nothing
else can contain me."</p>

<p>Her words seemed a promise to Jason; his
thoughts sped down the vista of future years, and
he saw her beside him ever, all the powers she
had spoken of harmoniously arranged in his life.
An hour afterwards, he found Sarah in her room,
holding her head in her hands. He observed her
strange, opaque, yellow paleness, and asked her if
she was ill.</p>

<p>"Not well," she replied.</p>

<p>"Would she have any assistance?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>It was so evident to him, however, that she was
ill, that he grew anxious and impatient. He moved
about softly, in the hope of attracting her attention;
then he pushed the chairs, folded up her
work on the table, piled the books together, rustled
the papers&mdash;all to no purpose. She was motionless,
and her eyes were fixed on vacancy. At last
he went out and returned with Elsa. In his absence
Sarah had put her hands over her eyes.
Elsa shook her finger at him as she said:</p>

<p>"Sarah, you feel poorly to-day."</p>

<p>"I have no heart to set those things to rights
that we spoke of last night."</p>

<p>"Never mind that; what shall I get you?"</p>

<p>No answer came from her.</p>

<p>"Do go to bed."</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>Elsa beckoned Jason out of the room.</p>

<p>"Now, Jason," she said in a lively voice, "you
needn't worry because I say so&mdash;but Sarah is
coming down with a fit of sickness."</p>

<p>A feeling of everything's falling in upon itself to
utter ruin oppressed him. Chaos and night would
come, should Sarah go.</p>

<p>"Better get things in order," she continued;
"Gilbert has been wanting you two or three hours."</p>

<p>Hurrying back to Sarah, as he mechanically
obeyed her suggestion, she felt her head, hands
and feet, without discomposing her.</p>

<p>"Sarah, you ought to go to bed; Jason is worried."</p>

<p>Sarah refused to move. All day she sat in her
chair, but at night she called to Jason in a hurried
voice to bring her night-clothes. With a wild haste
she undressed, dropped her comb on the floor, and
thrust her black curls under her cap, swaying to
and fro. Jason was afraid to offer any help, but
followed her to the bed. With a sigh she dropped
down upon it suddenly, and as suddenly sprang up
with a terrible cry which brought every soul in the
house to the chamber. Jason threw his arms round
her: "Sarah, Sarah, what is it?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I shall die," she screamed; "I shall die."</p>

<p>"Where is the pain, mother?" Parke asked, pale
with dread.</p>

<p>"Philippa," she said "oh, my head."</p>

<p>Philippa made a movement towards her, and
stood looking upon her with a cold helplessness.</p>

<p>"Philippa," she reiterated. "What do you
there?"</p>

<p>Parke crowded the pillows together, and Jason
inclined her gently upon them; she let her head
fall back, still keeping her eyes fixed, with an
expression of terror, upon Philippa, who now came
forward and endeavored to smooth the covers.</p>

<p>"In the name of all that's good and great, Mary,
why are you so mum?" called outside Elsa. "Send
for the doctor."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Parke.</p>

<p>"Stay here," whispered Elsa.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it," he replied. "I must get out."</p>

<p>Then the paroxysm subsided; Sarah wiped the
sweat from her forehead, closed her eyes, and all
stole from the chamber except Jason. Philippa
went into the dark parlors, for she wanted to
be alone, and lament over her cold dislike
for Sarah which nothing could overcome. A thick
gloom shut her in upon herself, in the face of the
apprehension which beset her&mdash;the senseless, fatuous
pride of life, which any hour might reduce
her to pitiful straits&mdash;and betray in black relief
how unlovely a thing she was. Sarah's perpetual
coldness, irritation, and anger proved that she
at least understood her unhappy idiosyncrasy.
She exonerated Sarah from that moment, and made
no merit of the perception which led her to consider
how impossible it was for her to be considered
anything except an intruder and an encumbrance;
but her heart was not softened an atom.
The door opened.</p>

<p>"Philippa," called Parke, "are you here? I
have been looking high and low for you."</p>

<p>"I am on the sofa."</p>

<p>He groped along till he found a place beside her.</p>

<p>"The doctor thinks mother is going to have a
nervous fever; she is easy now. Father is going
to sit up to-night. What do you think Elsa
is doing?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she murmured, exquisitely alive
to the fact that his hair brushed her cheek.</p>

<p>"She is making cake that will 'keep,'" she
says.</p>

<p>"She does so, because she has been much disturbed."</p>

<p>"Did you ever think of the strangeness of
mother's character, Philippa?"</p>

<p>"I have just been thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Such revelations come so unexpectedly from
those who are the nearest to us! There is something
appalling behind the screen of every-day
life, countenance, custom, clothes. What is it?"
he added so abruptly that she started.</p>

<p>"It is <i>us</i>," she answered, scarcely knowing what
she said.</p>

<p>"I see now that mother does not love you.
What has happened between you?"</p>

<p>"My name, my coming, and myself."</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying her answer; it comprehended
her whole history with his mother.</p>

<p>"Poor girl!"</p>

<p>"No, not that&mdash;not because of her; I have had
a life apart."</p>

<p>"You have a strength of your own."</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it silently. "Revelations,"
she thought, "go only just so far." A
bar of moonlight slanted in through the shutter,
fell across their clasped hands, and made a lattice
of light at their feet. As the moonbeam entered
the room, but did not encompass it, so did Parke's
presence enter the gloom which oppressed her, but
did not envelop it. They had never been together
as in that moment; it seemed as if he had yielded
to her something of himself he was afraid to keep
that night. What protection could he feel with her&mdash;he
had fallen asleep on her shoulder! His fair
forehead pressed against her mouth, his soft hair
fell on her neck; she wished that he would sleep
forever. The moonlight traversed the floor, and
died against the opposite wall before he stirred.</p>

<p>"Oh Philippa, are we here?" he said, drowsily,
and stretched out his arms to infold her; "kiss
me."</p>

<p>She bent her head, and they kissed each other.
For an instant the life-long hunger of her soul was
stayed.</p>

<p>"You won't strike me again, Philippa?"</p>

<p>It was all over. How she had been mocked!
She started to her feet.</p>

<p>"Why did you let me sleep so long, Philippa?"
He still held her hand, though she was moving on
the floor, nor would he release her till they reached
the door of Sarah's chamber; then he asked her to
go in and inquire how his mother was. Her eyes
were wide open, but they wore a tranquil look.
Jason's head was bent over the bedside, as if he
had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>"Is Parke out there?" Sarah asked.</p>

<p>Philippa nodded. "He wishes to know how you
are."</p>

<p>"I am here," she answered, in so clear and natural
a voice, that he put his head in at the door,
and gave her a smile.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, boy," she said.</p>

<p>Jason looked up, remarking that he believed
he could be trusted as a watcher, and Philippa
glided out.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

</div>

<p>THE nervous fever changed to a fatal disease
which consumed Sarah slowly. Silent and
passive as she lay in her darkened chamber, the pulse
of household life was still subordinate to her influence;
its ways depended on her condition from
hour to hour; for the first time it tacitly owned a
common individuality, of which she was the centre.
Parke confined himself to the house absolutely;
flitted in and out of her chamber twenty times a
day, smoked perpetually, changed from chair to
chair, sofa to sofa, in all the rooms, where he carried
piles of books, which he vainly tried to read.
He dwelt upon every favorable symptom which
appeared, with a vehemence that betrayed a doubt;
the unfavorable ones he passed over with a dogged
silence. He wrote to Charlotte, in the beginning
of Sarah's illness, that she must not expect to see
him while his mother's life hung by a thread, but
that she would get well. As an occupation, a
relief, he wrote to all his friends&mdash;he wished no
nearer approach from outside life&mdash;even including
Theresa. She replied, and for several weeks a
curious, semi-oblivious correspondence was
kept up.</p>

<p>Jason watched by Sarah's bedside night and
day; he attended to no calls whatever. Gilbert
assumed authority over affairs out of doors, and
inside Elsa conducted them with quietness and dispatch.
But, as only the ordinary details necessary
were dispatched, she was tormented by a waiting
leisure which preceded a dreaded crisis; day after
day she had nothing to do but recall her experiences
in sickness and compare them with the
present, or recount to Mary, and the neighbors who
came to inquire for Sarah, the cases which had
ended in death. In the chambers of her memory
death showed so placid and commonplace an aspect
that his coming wore no terrors; but his shadow
darkened Philippa's soul. All that she looked upon
was touched with Decay; nothing had been made
to escape the vanishing Hand. A peremptory
restlessness prevented her from inhabiting any
familiar spot. Her own room now looked like a
guest-chamber; she wandered in the garden, in
the orchard, and over the hill. Many times a
day she put in order the cups and vials on the
table and mantel in Sarah's chamber, but rarely
exchanged any words with her. Sometimes she sat
near her while Jason was at his meals; then Sarah's
eyes followed her movements with an expression
which was interpreted in the old way. Once when
their eyes met Sarah asked her if Parke was married.
She shook her head for a reply, not trusting
herself to speak, and hoped that Sarah would say
more&mdash;they could at least unite on that subject&mdash;but
she turned her face to the wall. Again she
asked if the cinnamon roses had bloomed. Philippa
gathered some for her; she turned them over and
over in her hand, inhaled their perfume for an
instant, and handed them to Jason, with a motion
that they should be taken out of her sight.</p>

<p>"Philippa," she called, once more, "what kind
of a day is it?"</p>

<p>"The sunshine is level everywhere."</p>

<p>"Level! So shall I be soon. Shall you stay
here afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"And you do not wish it."</p>

<p>"I can not."</p>

<p>For the most part, Sarah was silent towards
Jason. Not a word passed between them concerning
Parke or Philippa; he accepted what her will
had enforced now, as always. If he had any hope
of a nearer, clearer communication, he was disappointed.
He vainly watched for an opportunity to
give her some fragment of himself that would leave
him with the feeling that she had some clue to his
spiritual being. Savages have a belief that when
they are in the clutches of the lion and the tiger a
happy paralysis seizes them&mdash;they do not feel the
terror of being rent asunder; it may be that there
is a magnetism of Death, in which all the powers
of life are painlessly wrapped. It seemed so with
Sarah.</p>

<p>The morning dawned when Jason saw in her
face the bewildered, flitting look of a departing
soul. He kneeled by her with a solemn mien, and
fixed his eyes upon hers, and a sad intelligence
passed between them. She said nothing, but for a
moment returned his gaze; then she laid her feeble
hand on his, and shut her eyes. He kissed her
tenderly, and she gave a sigh which plowed his
heart with anguish, and tempted him to cry aloud.
He buried his face in her pillow, and presently he
felt her hand moving round his neck, and drawing
him close to her. Then she was still. The voice
of Elsa broke the silence.</p>

<p>"She is going to heaven, Jason, swiftly, and she
does not sense it."</p>

<p>"Call Parke and Philippa."</p>

<p>Her soul passed over the threshold of the world
of spirits, just as they reached the room. Parke
saw her hands flutter, and darted forward with a
cry of "Mother!" caught them within his grasp;
their helpless deadness appalled him so he dropped
them and staggered backward. Philippa stood by
Jason, self-forgetful, absorbed in the dread spectacle.
Her brain whirled with the questions which
pressed upon her. "What is that in the place of
her identity?" "Where is she?" "Why was she
ever alive?" "What does it all mean?"</p>

<p>"It is all over," Elsa announced, in a composed
voice, laying Sarah's hands straight beside her, and
closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" cried Parke, "this is too horrible.
Talk of infinite Goodness before such a sight as
this!"</p>

<p>Philippa gave a loud, hysterical cry, at which
Jason rose to his feet, looked wildly about him,
and struck his hands out as if he could not see.</p>

<p>"Take care of Parke, Jason," said Elsa, and he
was obliged to lead him away, reeling.</p>

<p>"I'll put you to bed, miss," said Elsa to Philippa,
leading her from the room tenderly, and crying
bitterly.</p>

<p>When the doors were opened for the coffin-bearers,
the sun streamed its hot, yellow rays
through the house, and laid bare its loneliness.
Something was gone from every nook and corner.
No sweet, gracious, lovely spirit had vanished
therefrom, but a dominant, exacting, forcible presence
had gone forever. The sun's rays fell
from the wide, blue summer sky, and traveled
with the funeral procession that still afternoon
when Sarah was buried, and rested on the mound
of sand heaped beside the grave&mdash;on the black
pall&mdash;on the mourners&mdash;with a glory that mocked
the shadows of the Valley of Death.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

</div>

<p>SEVERAL neighbors remained in the house
after the procession left, to restore the rooms
to order, and prepare supper against the return
from the grave. One of them, crossing
from one parlor to the other, saw a stranger standing
on the steps before the open door. She set
down the chair she was carrying, and went towards
him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is a death in the family."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Auster's. The procession left the house
but a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Will you walk in and take a seat, sir?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no; but I'll lounge about till
the family return."</p>

<p>Sauntering down the gravel-walk, as if it were a
pleasant thing to do at that moment, he repeated
over and over again, "That girl, Sarah," then
came back and sat upon the lowest step.</p>

<p>"Whoever stayed away ten years, though," he
thought, marking an S in the gravel with his cane,
"without somebody's dying? I wonder I did not
hear the bell toll! Have they given over the custom
of letting the world know the ages of those
carried away feet foremost? Three of us left&mdash;myself,
the boy, and Philippa. I might have asked
for Philippa, but I should have been bothered by
the curiosity of these people. Will Sarah's ghost
object to my staying here? I could divide honors
with Jason, never with her. I wonder if her curls
ever came out? How many times have I tried to
pull them straight! She should not be buried
there&mdash;it's not the right kind of clay. She should
be put where there is an eternal tramp. Pah! I
could hear the worms crawl under the sod up there,
it is so still."</p>

<p>Those within were informed that a stranger was
on the door-steps, and it was concluded that he
must be a relative of Jason's, too late for the
funeral. An examination from the upper windows,
however, proved the conclusion incorrect. Some
discovered his likeness to Parke, still strong, though
Osmond Luce (for it was he) had changed in the
last nine years. His once bright hair was gray
over his forehead, though round his massive neck
a row of brown ringlets still crept. His eyes were
still reckless and gay, but deep wrinkles had
gathered round them, and the lids looked tight
and drawn, like those of birds of prey. There
was something loose in his figure, and weak, in
spite of his size and vigor. The women called
him a handsome man. How easy he was behaving,
too, out there on the gravel-walk, breaking the
twigs and flowers as if they were his own!</p>

<p>A little girl came through the open gate, and
hurried up the walk, stopping when she saw him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lang wants to know if the folks have
come home from the funeral?" she said.</p>

<p>"They have not," he replied.</p>

<p>"She sends word to Parke that he must come
up there right away. Charlotte is sick."</p>

<p>The child looked in at the windows with curiosity,
and over the yard. She had heard what
had happened, and expected to meet something
strange.</p>

<p>"What ails Charlotte?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him as soon as I see him."</p>

<p>"Right away," she repeated, but made no motion
to go, scanning the yard.</p>

<p>"You wish for a flower, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Pick that red one yonder."</p>

<p>"That's London Pride. Do you live here?"</p>

<p>"No; do you?"</p>

<p>"I guess I do."</p>

<p>"How many inhabitants in this town?"</p>

<p>"Inhabitants!"</p>

<p>"People&mdash;folks."</p>

<p>"I can't tell; mother says that most all the old
people are dead, and that the place ain't what it
was once."</p>

<p>"What was your mother's name when the old
people were alive?"</p>

<p>"Eliza Ames; now it is Smith."</p>

<p>That name carried him back twenty years. He
was walking the streets of Crest on a moonlight
night beside a handsome, gay girl, who had jilted
him, whom he was beseeching again with love!
"To this favor has she come," he thought, "an
eleven-year old, sandy-haired Smith."</p>

<p>Leaving the step, he traversed the flower-paths
till he found the bitter aromatic southernwood;
breaking off a bit, he said, "Take this to your
mother, and tell her that Prince Osric sent it to
her."</p>

<p>"It's only southernwood," she uttered with
contempt; "but I'll take it to her. Good-by, sir."</p>

<p>In a few moments he heard the sound of slowly
approaching wheels, and, planting his hat firmly
over his brows, rose to meet the persons he expected.
A number of carriages halted at the gate;
the first contained Jason, Parke, and Philippa.
Jason came forward like one walking in his sleep,
and did not see Osmond till he touched his outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jason, we meet again."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he answered, looking past him into
the house.</p>

<p>"You know me, Osmond Luce?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sarah is dead, though; you could not
come before, I suppose." And he half turned as
if to recommend him to the notice of Parke and
Philippa, who were behind him, and, pushing by
him, he went up the steps.</p>

<p>Philippa knew her father, and put out her hand
silently; he took it, and, extending the other to
Parke, said: "My poor fellow, my mother was
buried on such an afternoon as this; the sunset
seems the same. I remember that I counted the
red bars in the sky as the company got out of the
carriages."</p>

<p>Tears moistened his eyes as they dwelt on Parke,
whose tearless gaze roved the sky, showing that he
had heard the sense of Osmond's words, but he did
not speak.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Philippa; "the rest are coming
up the steps."</p>

<p>"You are the same, Philippa," said her father
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No change," she answered, as they entered the
old familiar, paneled room. "Parke, you had
better go after Jason."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Osmond, "it is the best time for
friends to keep together. We remember how
attached the lost one was to this one or that, and
feel charitable; moreover, we pity each other as
victims of the same future, and resolve a mutual
protection. After a while, though, we separate
with a fresh eagerness for our different ways."</p>

<p>"You are the same, father, I see," said Philippa
quietly.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it, Osmond," said Parke, who had
paid no attention to her request. "I am glad you
are here. Open that shutter, Philippa; the people
will stay in the other room, will they? Get me
some water, will you?"</p>

<p>"Do you draw water, Philippa?" Osmond asked
with some sharpness.</p>

<p>"When I ask her, she does," Parke said.</p>

<p>"Did you and Sarah love each other, Philippa?"
her father asked, under his breath.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I thought so. By the way," turning to Parke,
"a little girl was here not long ago, with a message
for you. Mrs. Lang sent for you because Charlotte
was sick."</p>

<p>"Is she sick!" he muttered confusedly, looking
from one to the other. Philippa's expression
underwent so sudden a change that Osmond comprehended
there was a mystery. Parke took his
hat, hesitated&mdash;"Osmond," he called. Before he
could reply, Philippa made so negative and imperious
a gesture, that Parke abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>Elsa had recognised Osmond at once, but she
thought it best not to bruit his arrival; she therefore
marshalled the guests into supper, and then
bustled in to see him. They fell into a deep talk,
and Philippa escaped from them without notice.</p>

<p>"These are wretched particulars, Elsa," said
Osmond: "have I come to see the old ship go
down?"</p>

<p>"Sarah <i>was</i> at the helm always, you know."</p>

<p>"We must lash the helm down, and let the craft
drift into smooth water again; it will, you know, in
time."</p>

<p>"No lashing for me. I am going; if I can't die,
I can move?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense; because Parke has been foolish, or
because Jason is a widower?"</p>

<p>"Put it all together, or sort it out, just as you
like. As for Parke's being foolish, he has only
been as much as a man can be&mdash; that is, not much,
you know. As for Jason's being a widower&mdash;though
he is soft, I don't think he could help it."</p>

<p>"In view of all the facts, I think that Parke had
better leave Crest."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

</div>

<p>PARKE sat by another bed of death, dull and
exhausted. He listened to Mrs. Lang's reproaches,
Clarice's accusations, and Charlotte's
dying sighs, with a stupid composure. Before
sunrise he looked upon the face of his dead mistress,
with her dead child beside her. The awe of
death was ushered in the chamber with the pale
dawn. A yellow light crept round the walls, over
the figures of Mrs. Lang and Clarice, who sat
motionless and heavy, like the mutilated statues in
the sand of Thebes&mdash;over the defaced, haggard
glory in Parke's face; over the dumb, marble
Charlotte. Not until Mrs. Lang and Clarice stole
out of the room did he move from the position he
had maintained for hours; then he stood before
the bed. Charlotte's hair had fallen across her arm
in a coil; he untwined it, and held it&mdash;the talisman
of the past&mdash;and studied the mystery in her face&mdash;that
which the dead bear away with them, and
never reveal. As dead as this prostrate, powerless
creature, were the feelings which she had created
in his heart. Their existence had ceased with
hers; but  his heart was killed too&mdash;by depletion.
How beautiful she was still! The images of the
women he had known rose up before him in their
living power, and it seemed to him that of them all
Charlotte could only die; that of Theresa Bond
glowed with color, and streamed in upon his
thoughts like a pane of stained glass in a gloomy
cathedral. Pity, though, that so much beauty, so
loving a heart as Charlotte's, must be entombed&mdash;he
wept pure tears of pity for her, which her spirit
must have rejoiced over. No hand but his, he
determined, should touch those beautiful tresses,
he had so often slept against. He called Mrs.
Lang in again, and told her his wish. Some ribbon
was found, and with that they were arranged;
but Mrs. Lang observed that his face was averted
from the child, which lay as if slumbering on the
pillow.</p>

<p>"The Lord has not taken off the babe dis time;
it was some other body."</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "that I have not seen it.
I shall not look at it; that shame may be spared
me at least. Hide it in her bosom, if you choose,
it is already hidden in mine&mdash;the monument to
remind me to hate myself; in hers, it may turn to
a pitying angel. Now keep everybody away. Send
for your minister, if you choose, no one else."</p>

<p>"Yes, my minister wanted to baptize her! Ha!
Charlotte baptized! Any of my chil'n baptized&mdash;isn't
that a joke&mdash;oh, Almighty, give me patience!"
And Mrs. Lang wrung her hands, and screamed like a maniac.</p>

<p>"Hush," said Parke, "one of you is dead at any
rate."</p>

<p>"Stay with us," she implored.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;till I go to the grave with her. After
that there will be nothing I can do for you."</p>

<p>The manner which he instinctively assumed she
understood at once, and told Clarice that Charlotte
would be buried for good with him, and they also
on the day of the funeral.</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied, "there are no more
Charlottes to seduce; why shouldn't he leave?
Mother, can't we go from here?"</p>

<p>"No; we should have to take what we are with
us, wherever we went."</p>

<p>"True, we will stay, and rub in our humiliation,
and keep the brand bright. Ashes are good where
the flesh is raw."</p>

<p>"Clarice, you are a beast of a child; Charlotte
was better. I wanted her to live."</p>

<p>"I say she was bad."</p>

<p>"Bless them that despitefully use you," sang
Mrs. Lang, "and I bless you, Clarice."</p>

<p>"Pooh, you are melted just now."</p>

<p>Parke sent a note to Philippa with the particulars,
informing her that he should not be home at
present. Philippa, for reply, sent him some money
and a change of clothes, by a messenger she picked
up outside. She then gave the note to Jason, who
read it, and returned it without comment. But it
had the effect of sending him out of doors. His
pale, stern face appeared everywhere for the three
days following. People were made sensible, such
was the force of his presence, that he was Parke's
protector. As for Osmond, the pressure of circumstances,
as he teasingly told Elsa, was such
that he thought he had better "sing small."</p>

<p>"When I hear one of your diabolical set 'singing
small,' I shall hear a new kind of music," she
replied.</p>

<p>Philippa defied the devil, as Elsa commented; it
was impossible to guess from her behavior that any
calamity was weighing upon her. She repelled
every inclination of sympathy that might have
strayed in her direction. Somehow Elsa obtained
all the particulars concerning Parke, and knew
the exact moment when he issued from Mrs. Lang's
door to follow the coffin in company with her and
a few of the immediate neighbors.</p>

<p>"I'll bet," she said, "that this day he is his
mother's own child. I should like to see how he
bears comparison, as he stands among his respectable
dead relations."</p>

<p>He was well worth the seeing. A number of
people, as curious as Elsa, had gathered about the
gate of the burying-ground, and there were loungers
down the length of the picket-fence&mdash;of that class
whose tongues are the hot-beds for starting crops
of surmises. A group of young men, Parke's
acquaintances, were waiting for his arrival with
mixed feelings&mdash;of admiration at his pluck, and
gratification at the strait he was brought to.
These persons had taken a common privilege:
funerals were not affairs that belonged to friends
and relatives merely&mdash;they were the right of the
public, who liked to feel the pulse of grief.</p>

<p>With all his imperfections on his head, Parke
never looked so much a man as when he walked up
the gravel-path with Mrs. Lang on his arm, passing
his mother's grave, whose mound rose brown
and bare among the grassy hillocks which surrounded
it, and stood before the heap of sand
which was to cover Charlotte. Then all the followers
saw that she was to be buried among the
Parkes, with his own family. This proud concession
implied more than they could define.
His self-possession was astonishing; there was so much
cold authority in his mien that not one of them
would have been willing to meet his eye. The
women retreated, but with their petty bitterness
and hypocrisy, they said to each other, "Did you
ever see such brass?" and "Isn't it a pretty thing
that the wolves in sheep's clothing are having it
all their own way?" But the men were silent for
a moment; then burst out with, "By Jove, sirs,
there's stuff! Who can blame the girl?"</p>

<p>Clarice in her convulsive weeping was conscious
of a sentiment of gratitude towards Parke for giving
Charlotte the place among the dead of his race
that he would have given her had she been his
wife. That she would be his wife, had she lived,
Clarice had never believed, though aware of his
promise&mdash;made on the day of the awful discovery
of the nature of the connection between them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lang muttered so strangely when the coffin
slid on its cords, that he pulled her veil over her
face, and held a warning arm round her. When
the minister had spoken the earth-consecrating
words, he raised his hat, and, still leading Mrs.
Lang, moved down the path; but he did not return
home with her and Clarice; after placing them in
the carriage, he turned into a solitary by-road,
and walked by himself, towards home.</p>

<p>He entered the room where Osmond sat reading,
and Philippa was sewing, and stood before
them a moment in silence. The smile which
trailed the whole past over his face struck Osmond
and Philippa with the feeling that they had not
seen him in a long time.</p>

<p>"Crystallization has taken place," thought Osmond;
"he is too young, the boy, for that."
Then he said aloud, "Crest won't do for me, my
boy, without you. Jason is monotonous, and Philippa
is&mdash;Philippa"</p>

<p>Parke laid his hand lightly on his shoulder,
turned from him, and sat down by her. She was
sewing a long seam on white cloth, which he remembered
to have seen in her hands, six weeks,
or six years, before. She looked up, full of the
effort to speak to him, but Jason entering, she remained
silent. Parke instantly rose and faced his father,
thus paying his first tribute of respect to
him. Jason turned his head to the window, to the
doors, towards Parke, and nodded to his son with a
nod which contained the old permission of full
liberty.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," Osmond silently commented,
"That man Jason is a man of genius, and an
honor to human nature. If he develops, I should
like to make a raree show of him."</p>

<p>Philippa rolled up her work, and made some stir
over her work-basket, wondering why they did not
speak&mdash;this was the occasion! Presently, as the
silence continued unbroken, with a mixture of courage
and simplicity she said: "Silence is sometimes
a want of truth."</p>

<p>"Always," said Jason; "but what are you going
to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Philippa is simply an idiot," thought Osmond.</p>

<p>"Is it not enough that I have returned?" said
Parke; "or will you have a sermon preached?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that has been preached," Jason answered.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Parke.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>LINK by link the family chain was parting. For
a few weeks Elsa transacted domestic affairs
as if under the supervision of Sarah. Jason resumed
his old out-of-doors life, and Parke went
hither and thither, driving with Osmond, playing
the piano, and skimming books. Philippa's habits
appeared the same also. But there was not a day,
rain or shine, that she did not pay a visit to the
hill&mdash;the most solitary spot in Crest, near as it was
to the streets. The cedars, brown with age,
crooked from wrangling with the sea-wind, hid her
as she ascended the path to the top, and the oaks,
the rocks, and the bare side of the grassy mound
which met the sky, protected her. There her eyes
were not tormented by the confining walls and their
familiar objects; they rested on the small treasures
which Nature offered her&mdash;grass, weeds, moss, seeds
and mold&mdash;but they rested vacantly. Not even the
higher glories of the provident Mother, the trees,
the air and clouds, the sea, immense and eternal as
was their aspect, appeased the hunger of her heart.
Parke's music became to him a new thing; he
played the changes of his soul&mdash;the accents of his
experience sounded through all his compositions;
but to her it seemed only an increased attention he
was giving the piano from <i>ennui</i>.  It was the time
when they were most together. He asked her
once if music was becoming a companion.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "the companion of a companion."</p>

<p>"This is a pretty life," Osmond thought, when
he observed them together. "Arcadian, mild,
quiet, but flavorless; the salt of life is confined to
the sea here. Of course a ripple is coming in its
current, which I shall wait for. <i>Dolce far niente</i> is
a plant that never reaches maturity in this climate;
even imported specimens peak and pine, and resemble
celery transplanted to the cellar."</p>

<p>The ripple, or a snap in the chain, was caused
by Elsa, who again informed Osmond that now she
was going in earnest. She should take up her
abode in her own house&mdash;an ancient dwelling,
standing on the bay neck, in a solitary spot, with a
few acres of arable land around it, which she had
farmed out for years without a dollar's profit. "It
was time for her," she said, "to look after her own
property." He offered to purchase it, if she
would remain with Philippa; but she declined, arguing
that it was the best thing to be done for
Philippa, who would never do anything for herself,
so long as she had her to lean upon. "I
shall tell her," Elsa continued, "that she will have
to be her own cook and bottle-washer, with Mary's
help; unless, indeed, she wants to fill up the house
with new-fangled servants, which she can never do,
on Jason's account."</p>

<p>"For all that," returned Osmond, "you will
come back."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think I ought to die in harness;
but if there is not a Parke worth living for even,
what is the beauty of staying here to die?"</p>

<p>"We shall see," he answered provokingly; but
he saw she was determined on the point. A day
or two afterwards she told Jason, who begged her
to give him lessons in house-work before she went,
for he should endure no stranger in her place.</p>

<p>"Philippa must take my place."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Elsa; what can she do?"</p>

<p>"She must learn; there won't be much to do,
the family will be small."</p>

<p>"How small?"</p>

<p>"You don't imagine Osmond Luce is going to
settle down in this spot at this late day. And
when he begins his rounds again, Parke will begin
his also."</p>

<p>Jason appeared struck. "Poor Philippa!" he
said, absently.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know a young man to remain at
home for the sake of a 'poor Philippa,' or anybody
else, when the spirit of wandering has seized him?&mdash;and
it has seized Parke."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? He has everything to stay
for."</p>

<p>"He hasn't."</p>

<p>"His estate, his associations&mdash;Philippa."</p>

<p>"And the Langs."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot those."</p>

<p>"Jason, you are the strangest man I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I wonder if <i>I</i> hadn't better go?"</p>

<p>"Now, where would you go?"</p>

<p>"To where I started from, with my trunk.
Where is my trunk, Elsa? Is there an old pincushion
in it, do you know? Perhaps I could find
the girl who gave it to me, twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"Pincushion and trunk are among the things
that were."</p>

<p>"Then I must stay."</p>

<p>"You had better, if you want things to hold together."</p>

<p>Besides some desire for a change from the scene
of her cares and sorrows, Elsa was oppressed by a
presentiment, which she did not try to account for.
To use her own expression, Jason, Parke, and
Philippa were at loose ends, and there was no
telling what changes might take place; she would
not remain to embarrass them, nor herself. They
were also of another day and generation than the
one she had lived for, and she felt herself incapable
of assuming their responsibilities.</p>

<p>She hurried away with an eagerness that was
ominous to Mary, who bewailed the necessity of
taking charge of the household. The day she left,
accompanied by Parke and Philippa, was one late
in September; the autumnal winds had not yet devastated
the woods, but the leaves fluttered down,
seeking their place of repose in the gay shroud
which the summer bequeathed. Vigorous blossoms,
red, blue, and yellow, covered the ditches
and fields, flaunting above the sere grass, forgetful
of the dance of death they were preparing for
when the winter winds should blow. The pale
amber atmosphere stained the calm sea, and blurred
the sky. Parke loved the sadness and sweetness
of the day; but Philippa, unforgiving towards
Elsa for leaving her, was petulant, nervous, and
behaved more oddly than usual. Elsa was occupied
with wondering whether Mr. Clapp's folks
would be ready to receive her."</p>

<p>"There," she said, as they turned into a lane,
at the end of which her house stood, "the bars
are down, and the Clapps are looking out; the
window blinking in the sun is my best-room
window."</p>

<p>"How you will enjoy yourself!&mdash;what a lovely
spot!" said Philippa satirically. "How agreeable
a walk must be in this lane; and the Clapps, I
judge, will be ample society for you."</p>

<p>"Not so much but that I shall be glad to see
you; you will come and tea with me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"She is never coming to tea," cried Parke; "we
are going to break with you entirely."</p>

<p>"But you won't." </p>

<p>He wilfully refused to go inside the door; but,
after he had turned the carriage, jumped out,
seized her on the threshold, and gave her withered
cheek a hearty kiss, and jumped back again.
Hurrying into the house, followed by Philippa, to
conceal that she was crying, she threw herself into
a chair, and exclaimed, "I have buried myself with
a vengeance."</p>

<p>"Go back with us," Philippa urged; "it is not
too late. You know that you are making a mistake."</p>

<p>"Go right home; I've got other fish to fry just
now than to listen to you."</p>

<p>"May their bones choke you!"</p>

<p>"Spiteful thing, good-by. Clear out."</p>

<p>"How fast that young man drives!" said Mrs.
Clapp, watching him down the lane; but Elsa
would not leave her seat till she knew the carriage
was out of sight; then she started up, and declared
she was going into the orchard.</p>

<p>"There hasn't been any windfalls yet to speak
of, and I told my old man it wasn't worth while to
turn in the hogs; they'd only make a mess on't
with rooting," Mrs. Clapp droned, but Elsa was
gone.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us," Mrs. Clapp went on, "she will
make it as lively as a hornet's nest for us. May
be she won't hire us the place another year."</p>

<p>With her cap border flying back, and her arms
folded, Elsa skirted the old orchard with fleetness.
The sound of wheels rolling over a little
wooden bridge half a mile below the house caught
her ears. She stopped.</p>

<p>"There they go, rolling over my heart! Lord
God!" and she eyed the trunk of a venerable
plum-tree with a fierce rigidity, "what is the use
of my reading the Bible all my days, if I am not
going to bear it better than this?" Something in
the look of the tree arrested her,&mdash;she darted forward,
"Upon my soul, there's borers in this tree,
and that's the reason," scanning the branches,
"there's not a plum on it."</p>

<p>The tide was checked; she returned to the house
composed, and convinced Mrs. Clapp, before bedtime,
that she was an uncommonly cheerful woman,
for her age. In a week, the Clapps, tenants at
will, were under her control, and she began to feel
at home.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

</div>

<p>"'A MIGHTY wind arises, roaring seaward,
and I go,'" said Osmond, one wild
morning.</p>

<p>"Are you 'flying, flying south'?" Parker asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; will you take a pinion with me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I am ready when you are. I have
said nothing of my purpose; I thought a suggestion
of the sort might hurry you away."</p>

<p>"I shall go to General Paez, provided he is in
retirement; would you like to be a mighty cattle-hunter
on his pampas?"</p>

<p>"I should like nothing better."</p>

<p>"Think well of it;&mdash;a life of adventure once
begun never ends, except by the casualties incident
to it, which are many. You have something&mdash;a
great deal&mdash;to keep you here; you are your own
master. I was not when I left Crest; not until I
put this ancient town far behind me did I know
what it was to belong to myself. You have almost
too much money to commence my career picturesquely."</p>

<p>"Can't we spend it?"</p>

<p>Osmond snapped his fingers. "Ossa on Pelions
of it."</p>

<p>A glimmering of Osmond's disposition dawned
in Parke's mind; he mused.</p>

<p>"You gave up your share of your grandfather's
property, didn't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't I should have made ducks and
drakes of it. Owing to your mother, I think, my
pride would not allow me, so I made it over to
Philippa. I had a trifle then, besides."</p>

<p>"Poor Philippa!"</p>

<p>"Don't be Quixotic; she is not too grateful to
me, you see."</p>

<p>"I'll leave the best of mine here."</p>

<p>"Make the offer to your father; give him what
you don't want&mdash;the income, I mean."</p>

<p>"As much as he'll take, of course; but you must
know that he has been as generous with me as you
have been with Philippa."</p>

<p>"That is, he absolutely refused to be indebted to
his wife."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that we are a lot of proud
fools together. I'll go and confer with him now."</p>

<p>"You don't mind leaving Philippa?" Osmond
asked, experimentally.</p>

<p>Parke stopped&mdash;looked into the recesses of his
hat.</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove, she will miss me. I hate to tell
her. What can she do in this cursed spot alone?"</p>

<p>"She can weave a web, like Penelope."</p>

<p>"But no suitors will drop in."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ritchings."</p>

<p>"That's over, some time ago."</p>

<p>"Sam Rogers&mdash;her paragon."</p>

<p>"Old Sam is a hero. To him she is an idol, to
be worshipped from afar; to her he is something
better than her dog, only she hasn't one&mdash;a little
dearer than <i>my</i> horse."</p>

<p>"You put him on a high pedestal."</p>

<p>"He is a noble man, but a blockhead, you know."</p>

<p>Osmond doubted whether he was so much a
blockhead, for Elsa had given him a pretty correct
impression of the strength of Sam's character; but
he did not mention his doubt.</p>

<p>"Philippa is cut out for an old maid," continued
Parke. "She is self-absorbed, not selfish&mdash;as I
have every reason to know, and nobody ever seems
to attract her; she is the most impassive creature
I ever knew, and the coolest."</p>

<p>"That being the case, I propose to send her a
King Charles, from New York."</p>

<p>It was a pleasant thought, Parke said, as he went
to look for Jason.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Osmond concluded to look
up Philippa, and study her a little. He discovered
her in the kitchen with a heated face, in the act of
compounding cake.</p>

<p>"Those little tins, those little tins," he said,
"remind me of my boyhood's sins."</p>

<p>"I expect," remarked Mary, "you scraped the
inside of 'em."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Were you punished?" Philippa asked.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Laws," said Mary, "I heard you were never
punished for anything."</p>

<p>"I was punished regularly with indulgence;
every soul in the family was devoted to me&mdash;devoted;
do you understand devotion, Philippa?"</p>

<p>"I was born a Catholic, you know," she answered,
quietly proceeding into the parlor; but he followed
her.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! do you remember the day of
your birth, and your christening?"</p>

<p>"I remember my black rosary; the one who gave
me that was devoted to me, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Philip."</p>

<p>"The deuce&mdash;your cousin. The life here,
though&mdash;you like it?"</p>

<p>"Well enough never to leave it."</p>

<p>"To follow no one's fortunes?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Ignis Fatuus</i> only chases his brother."</p>

<p>"When I go from Crest what will you give me?"</p>

<p>She hesitated so long, thinking that he meant
and wanted money, feeling no willingness to be
generous towards him, yet anxious to oblige him,
if she could do so without conferring a sense of
obligation, that he burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Whose child are you? What hour were you
begotten? When the sordid New England wind
blew?"</p>

<p>The cool insolence of his manner enraged her;
she shook her hair back, and knit her brows.</p>

<p>"Not so impassive, after all," he thought, as she
flashed upon him.</p>

<p>"You make me feel," she said, with her words
coming from tightened lips, "the torment and torture
of life. Let me alone. I'll tell you, though,
what I shall do with your money, which belongs
<i>here</i>&mdash;return it to Parke. You see that I am 'devoted'
to an idea."</p>

<p>"You are not devoted to him, I trust. If so,
you are, indeed, devoted to an idea&mdash;a hopeless
one."</p>

<p>Cooler than himself&mdash;cool, indeed, for an
icy chill crept over her&mdash;she said, in a sharp, appealing
tone, "Fathers should be the confidants of their
daughters' feelings, where there is no mother; I
confess mine to you: I am devoted to him."</p>

<p>A sad groan came to his lips; then he exclaimed
harshly: "What stuff have you in your head
about woman's constancy and sacrifice? But no!
I know you better; in fact, I understand you all at
once. If we are not the besotted instruments of a
logical Fate, what are we? I'll test it." A burning
blush rose in his face, a wild light rushed into
his eyes. "Philippa, will you join <i>my</i> fortune?
Will you go to South America with me?"</p>

<p>A spark of nature was elicited in both at last;
their faces wore the same eager, passionate, overcoming
expression. For an instant she was seized
with his nomadic spirit, and set her foot forward
as if to enter upon his free, salient, purposeless
life. With outstretched hands, he urged her in a
voice so altered by tenderness and entreaty that
she wondered at the feeling of resistance which
compelled her to struggle with the phantoms of
Liberty and Pleasure which his words had evoked.
He saw a cold shade drop over her face, and
divined that he could not shake her resolution.
He was bitterly tempted for a moment to tell her
that Parke was going with him, and let her feel
how narrow had been the chance between her and
the happiness she was trying to buy, but he forbore.</p>

<p>"I must remain," she said. "How can I tell,"
she added, so unaffectedly he could hardly help
smiling, "whether I could bear the license of your
life? I succumb to tradition and custom because
I love them. But if these barriers should be removed,
I feel I have that within which could rise,
and overtop excess. When are you going?"</p>

<p>"At an early day; none is yet named. You
are fixed, then?" resuming his careless manner;
"granite is nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Stay longer."</p>

<p>"Entreat me."</p>

<p>"What will Parke do when you go?"</p>

<p>"Hang Parke, or drown him&mdash;a puppy's proper
fate. I am sick of the beauty&mdash;he is sweet, though,
magnetic, and has a wonderfully delicate but
strong power of self-assertion. He is dull beyond
a certain limit, however, and is profound nowhere.
Do you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you say you are devoted to him?"</p>

<p>"You left me here a child&mdash;a child loves the
beautiful. Was there any thing lovely in Sarah or
Jason? Parke was lovely, and I turned to him.
He is still the same to me. Though I do not have
any proof of his goodness, I am faithless as to his
faults. Tell me, if you can, how do certain men
make a universal impression, which they do not
account for in words or works?"</p>

<p>"I see. Parke, Dante, and Shakspeare must be
great, because they have made us believe so."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"You are a kind of witch, I believe; curious
looking, too."</p>

<p>"I know I am ugly," she answered, coloring
painfully.</p>

<p>"By no means. You have good eyes; witches
always have."</p>

<p>"Yet with diabolical, revengeful yellow hair."</p>

<p>"Why, girl, what ails you? you are no conjurer,
at any rate. The truth is, you are half foreign;
in your native town I have seen dozens of girls
like you&mdash;with a difference."</p>

<p>He left her in a melancholy mood, wishing that
he had not disturbed her or himself. It was a
foolish and hazardous experiment he had been
trying; she might have accepted his life, which
was not fit for so frail and unique a creature. But
his heart had been set in motion; it plowed
through and through him, upturning memories, old
desires, and instigating new ones; he was perturbed
with the pain and longing of a boy. But
somehow his melancholy softened him to thankfulness
that one remained with power to convince him
that his soul was still alive.</p>

<p>Parke found Jason at the dock, preparing to tar
the seams of his boat, which had been hauled on a
raft; he seated himself on the cap log, near the
tar-pot.</p>

<p>"You are just in time to keep up the blaze for
me," said Jason, jumping down on the raft, and
proceeding with the work. Parke collected the
sticks within his reach and poked them into the
fire, feeling unaccountably nervous; his heart
fluttered and his hands felt weak. Suddenly he
sprang down on the raft, which tilted into the
water, so that he nearly lost his balance. Jason
calmly laid down the tar-swab, and motioning
Parke towards a box, took a seat beside him; he
felt what was coming, but looked phlegmatic.
Parke's eyes roved over the bay, whose waters
were almost level with his sight, with a consciousness
that he had been in the same scene before,
and about to say the same thing. The faded woods
opposite the rocky points shelving into the sea,
the islands lifted over the horizon, the hulls and
masts looming above him, the stagnant basin they
were floating in, were the marshals of that reality
and this dream.</p>

<p>"The tar will cool," said Jason, crossing his legs.</p>

<p>"I'll begin, then, what I have to say."</p>

<p>His voice was so agitated that Jason turned,
looked, and pitied. "I can guess what you have
to say, Parke."</p>

<p>"Do you object to my leaving home?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I propose to <i>live</i> elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why should I live in Crest?"</p>

<p>"Because you are a son of the soil."</p>

<p>"So you were, but you left home."</p>

<p>"I owned nothing, not even a father's love."</p>

<p>"Do I own the latter?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I will not interfere with your plans."</p>

<p>"Then I can go?"</p>

<p>Jason walked up and down the raft, returned
to his seat, and said: "Those Generals of Independence
will use up your money."</p>

<p>"How do you know anything about them."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that I have known nothing of
Osmond's career in Venezuela?"</p>

<p>"Will you manage as you always have for me?"</p>

<p>"If you go, I desire you to take every dollar out
of my hands; the old uncertainties connected with
the wanderings of the family shall not be renewed
in my case. I must be as free of you as you are of
me. Perhaps for your own sake it is best that you
should go; your prestige is gone. I must tell you,
however, that Osmond's hands are by no means
clean; the men of your race have single vices, and
run them hard. I warn you against him. Moreover,
I ask you not to go. I ask you to live at
home on Philippa's account."</p>

<p>"She is willing, of course," cried Parke, with
heat.</p>

<p>"Has she said so?"</p>

<p>"I have not told her yet."</p>

<p>"Go and tell her, then."</p>

<p>"At all events, I shall go."</p>

<p>"Very well. We will talk business in that case."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX.</p>

</div>

<p>PARKE went to see Elsa next, and for the sake
of reflection, perhaps, walked to her house,
a distance of three miles. She saw him coming up
the lane, threshing the thistles with a cane, and kicking
the loose pebbles down the gullies.</p>

<p>"I am barreling my potatoes to-day," she
screamed at the door, when he came within hearing.</p>

<p>"I wish you would include me with them," he
replied, taking her hand. She drew him into the
house to her own little sitting-room, and bade him
take his ease on her new moreen-covered lounge.
A wood fire burned on the hearth, which led to inquiries
concerning the merits of her woodland, and
then she asked him for news, being famished for
the article.</p>

<p>"I am going to Venezuela, Elsa."</p>

<p>"Vene&mdash;cat's foot."</p>

<p>"Cat's paw, possibly, for I mean that you shall
tell Philippa my purpose. An impression seems to
have got abroad that my going will have a disagreeable
effect upon her, which effect I do not like
to face."</p>

<p>"I shan't do any such thing for you, sir. I have
withdrawn my finger from all your pies. Since I
have eaten humble pie with you, somehow I have
lost my relish for any more of your baking. I don't
think your going will kill Philippa, however. I
suppose Jason is worried about her&mdash;there is nobody
else to take her part; he is apt to think of
other people's feelings."</p>

<p>"I never thought him apt that way; indeed, he
is too indifferent. You are a cunning, cruel woman,
and I am sorry I came to you."</p>

<p>She was angry with him for telling her that what
she had foreseen and waited for was at hand, but
rather enjoyed his calling her names. Disposed to
aggravate him, she said; "At any rate, Jason
knows when he is in the right place. I must say,
that if I admire any thing, I admire a steadfast
disposition, and that is his."</p>

<p>"I did not come to discuss his character. However,
I will agree with you on that point. He is
all that you say, and a great deal more. I find
him not only the right kind of a father, but a
<i>friend</i>."</p>

<p>"Yet he consents to your leaving home, and
with <i>Osmond?</i>"</p>

<p>"Will you, or will you not, tell Philippa?"</p>

<p>"Why has she been kept in the dark till now?"</p>

<p>"It seems to be considered my business to inform her,
and hear her opposition. She is so queer,
though, she may not mind it at all."</p>

<p>"Now you are lying."</p>

<p>"You and Sam Rogers have had a quiet way of
holding her up to me as a terror of tacit superiority.
We are mutually attached, I hope, but my idea of
attachment leaves us perfect freedom still. I trust
she would dislike this silent interference she has
been made, as much as I do."</p>

<p>"Bats, moles, and men are akin," thought Elsa;
but she said aloud, "The sooner the better. You
talk with her; I refuse flat to open the subject. I
am going up to the shore about dark, and I reckon
I'll stay all night, to look over your shirts."</p>

<p>"Never mind the shirts."</p>

<p>"Somebody must bear them in mind, or you
won't have any on your body&mdash;though I don't know
as the foreign beasts you are going amongst wear such things.
I might have known the day Osmond
Luce came back, that you would go off with him.
I did look for it pretty soon after."</p>

<p>"His influence was nothing."</p>

<p>"There is some good in him, though, if you'll
have patience to look for it."</p>

<p>"Elsa!" and Parke took her chin in his hand,
compelling her to meet his eye, "between man and
woman now, do you not think that I had better go
from Crest?"</p>

<p>"I think that you could not do a wiser thing,
and I hope you will stay forever."</p>

<p>"Enough! I am off."</p>

<p>The thistles were unmolested, and the pebbles
were suffered to rattle without his aid on the walk
home. Instead of going in at the main door, he
entered the premises by the barnyard gate. He
saw Gilbert milking in a corner, and, on the other
side of the fence Philippa going up the garden
with a shawl over her head. A resolve took possession
of him. Waiting till she was beyond view,
he leaped the fence, and followed her slowly, till
he saw her seated among the trees on the top of
the hill. A line of crimson light gleamed in the
west&mdash;the arc of sunset; overhead the purple
clouds of November rolled together and drew apart
in the tumult of the sea-wind, which tossed them as
it tossed the waves whose deep moan rose and fell
round him as if baffled by the height he had
reached.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw you," Philippa said quickly
"Isn't it cold up here?"</p>

<p>"Too cold to spend the evening, but I like it just
now. What are you up here for?"</p>

<p>"I often come."</p>

<p>"I had no idea you indulged in sunset reveries.
How far out to sea can you look?"</p>

<p>Climbing the rock against which she rested, he
peered through the bare boughs rattling over her
head, and continued: "Oh yes, the high bank at
the south end of Prince Island is illuminated with
the rays of the sun that has left us, and the outlet
next it looks like a dark tunnel. Don't it make
you think of Sam Rogers when you look out
there?" And he carelessly dropped down beside
her.</p>

<p>"I never look there."</p>

<p>"What do you look at?"</p>

<p>"Myself."</p>

<p>A conviction that his task might be more difficult
than he had supposed fastened upon him, but it
steeled his purpose, and somewhat increased his
irritation against those who had thrown it upon
him.</p>

<p>"Give me a corner of your shawl to keep off the
wind&mdash;there&mdash;this is comfortable." His arm was
around her waist, and her head was against his
shoulder. "Will you look out seaward for me?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Figuratively speaking, I shall be behind the
outlet; literally, I am going away with your father."</p>

<p>Her fingers twisted in the lapels of his coat;
she held him down with a strength that made him
catch his breath with the effort to release himself.</p>

<p>"You shall not go."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Philippa," and, tearing from her, he
bounded to his feet, "and you must consent. Do
you want me to remain in this wretched spot? I
can be little to you&mdash;miserable myself. You must
make some change, too. You have the right and
the means to be free and happy."</p>

<p>The sea roared in her ears, the wind tossed her
hair across her eyes; she threw back her head
madly, and he caught the knowledge in her face
which struck him like lightning, and she rolled
over at his feet as if she were stone dead.</p>

<p>"Why, she loves me!" he said, in a loud, stupefied
voice, looking down upon her. "My God,
what is there in me to love?"</p>

<p>He tried to raise her from the ground, but she
lay like lead, heavy and lifeless. He shook her,
rubbed her hands, pinched her cheeks, and at last
she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"I want you," she said.</p>

<p>"No, you don't. I am a worthless fellow. Do
you desire Charlotte Lang's lover, husband, in your
presence always?"</p>

<p>"I am so dizzy," she said, trying to get up.</p>

<p>"I know you are." And he wrapped her shawl
round her, kissing her hand, and then trying to kiss
her lips.</p>

<p>"Don't kiss me."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"If you do, I must remember it," and she burst
into a wild fit of crying, which drove Parke to his
wits' end. The tears fell from his own eyes without
his knowing it. They descended the hill, but
stopped again in the orchard, as if by mutual
consent.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think me a dreadful fool, Philippa,
but I never dreamed of this."</p>

<p>"It was always so."</p>

<p>Again she looked at him with unutterable
passion in her face; now he knew that he stood
by the portals of a world he alone could enter, and,
that once shut from his vision, he would never see
again. His own act had shut it out forever, and
her innocence could not comprehend it!</p>

<p>"Now, now, by God, I will go. I am not base
enough to take you&mdash;to give <i>myself</i> to you."</p>

<p>She loosed her hold, and they walked on again.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry," she said in a moment,
restored to that calmness which the sea shows after
a storm, "that I have told you the motive of my
life; it may protect you."</p>

<p>"It may, but I shall not return; and, wherever
I am, I shall escape from that protection, if possible."</p>

<p>Going on as if he had not spoken, and still
calmer, she said: "Telling it has prevented me
from dragging it around as a purpose. Telling it
has put it to death. All the care and fostering of
this motive is buried in the grave of your knowledge.
Its ghost will never rise. Was I not foolish
with plans&mdash;which even God's judgment did
not avert?"</p>

<p>It was not necessary for him to speak; he had
dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>"I shall always love you, though," she concluded,
as he opened the porch-door, "because you
are beautiful."</p>

<p>An expression of self-contempt passed over his
face; it was impossible for him to appreciate the
value of being loved for that.</p>

<p>Elsa was warming her hands by the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, surveying their pale
faces&mdash;"hum; I have been looking round this
kitchen, and it is just as I expected&mdash;a place for
nothing, and nothing in its place. I told Parke
his going away would not kill you."</p>

<p>"No more than your going did."</p>

<p>"Oh, lud a massy!"</p>

<p>Parke, lighting a cigar, went out by the same
door that he had just entered. Who can tell
what motive or train of thought led him to Mrs. Lang's?
Without knocking, in the old familiar way, he
entered her house once more. She, with Clarice,
was sitting by a table, singing hymns in rotation
from a little hymn-book in her hand. Her eyes
fell on Parke, and she stopped in the middle of a
line to reply to his "Good-evening." Clarice did
not speak. He threw off his overcoat, took a
chair near the fire-place, and sat buried in thought,
smoking cigar after cigar. The loud tick of the
clock, the wind shaking the windows, and the suppressed
yawns of Mrs. Lang only disturbed the
silence, for Clarice was as still as Parke. The evening
wore on. What fascination held his eyes to
the consuming brands? Did he see Mephistopheles
in his scarlet coat and cock's feather, with his
eternal grin? Did he hear Margaret cry; "Day!
yes, it is growing day! The last day is breaking
in! My wedding-day it was to be."</p>

<p>A despairing, louder yawn from Mrs. Lang
roused him at last; he threw his cigar in the fire,
turned from it, and, in a low voice, asked her if
there was any last favor he could do for her.</p>

<p>"You have done all the favor you could do,"
Clarice interposed, before her mother could speak.
"Sent one of us to the grave."</p>

<p>"I know it, Clarice," he replied gently. She
looked at him for the first time since his entrance.
A deep sadness was in his eyes, and his face had
grown sharp.</p>

<p>"Do you mourn for her?" she hastily asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you a lie. No."</p>

<p>"Clarice, you stop," ordered Mrs. Lang.</p>

<p>"I come to say, that <i>she</i> has sent me away."

<p>"Oh, pity, pity," cried Mrs. Lang; "it would
not be so if we were anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Slave," hissed Clarice, "to take part against
yourself."</p>

<p>Parke rose and threw his coat over his arm.</p>

<p>"Stop you, Clarice," Mrs. Lang continued. "I'll
call it the ole story then; don't <i>I</i> know that men
are men, and women are women, and I think it is
foolish for him to give up his birthright for a mess
of pottage."</p>

<p>"Go, will you?" begged Clarice.</p>

<p>"As I would take Charlotte always under my
wings, so, Parke, I will take your part," Mrs. Lang
added.</p>

<p>"Well, then, there is no enmity between us.
Good-by."</p>

<p>"Farewell," she said, and then in an undertone,
"It's all done right now, as the Lord would
have it."</p>

<p>Clarice took up the lamp to follow him out, and
shut the door upon her mother.</p>

<p>"Forget me, Clarice, in mercy to me."</p>

<p>"It is like going to the grave again, to part with
you, for all that I have hatefully said. You were
the link that attached me to a world I do not
belong to. Pray that I may die. You are lucky,
and your prayer may be answered."</p>

<p>"If you desire it, and for my own death too."</p>

<p>They stood in silence a moment, and then
parted, never to meet again.</p>

<p>"Much more of this business will kill me," he
said to Osmond the next day.</p>

<p>"Let us begone. You will rise elastic in another
atmosphere. Has Jason transferred your bank
stock?"</p>

<p>"He is about ready with his statistics."</p>

<p>"I named Garcia &amp; Co., who have a branch
house in New York, for your bankers. Jason is
singular; why does he want to wash his hands of
all your filthy lucre?"</p>

<p>"Between me and you, he has no great opinion
of managing for the Parkes."</p>

<p>"Right enough. <i>He</i> is a brick, though."</p>

<p>"Regular."</p>

<p>"Made himself after the pattern of the Hebrew
bricks, for he wasn't worth a straw when he
started."</p>

<p>"Here he is now."</p>

<p>"Now," said Jason, entering, "as far as business
is concerned, you can go."</p>

<p>"'O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,'
then," said Osmond.</p>

<p>"Better take Byron along," said Jason.</p>

<p>"No books allowed. Jason, you are an aboriginal;
I should think my way of life would suit
you.</p>

<p>"Is yours a community of equal rights?"</p>

<p>"If we can take them."</p>

<p>"Am I really going?" asked Parke of Philippa,
as she came in.</p>

<p>"It seems so."</p>

<p>"I mind leaving you, girl," said Osmond. "Take
care of her, Jason."</p>

<p>"She will take care of herself."</p>

<p>"Keep yourself safe, old fellow, for she is
alone."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better bestow that advice on yourself?"</p>

<p>"Last words don't amount to much," Parke observed.</p>

<p>"It is respectable, though, to say something,"
answered Osmond.</p>

<p>At the last moment, Parke sought Philippa, and
was alone with her till Osmond sent him away.</p>

<p>"Philippa," said her father, "a man does not escape
from the environments of ten or twenty years
scot-free, many times."</p>

<p>"You mean that we may not meet again?"</p>

<p>"That is it."</p>

<p>"Take me up in your arms, as you did on board
the ship, years ago, and I will kiss you."</p>

<p>He caught her in his embrace, and when he
released her his tears were on her face, and she
turned away weeping.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

</div>

<p>TONE and color were wanting in the details of
family life which were now mechanically performed
by Philippa and Mary. Excepting these,
each day was a disintegration, and every person
went apart to enjoy or suffer an existence which
appeared to depend upon itself merely.</p>

<p>Mary was hypochondriacal, and the grasshopper
was a burden; her mental eyes were fixed upon
the progress of an imaginary liver complaint, an
impending cancer, or a slow consumption; the
falling of the sky would have been connected with
her ailments, and noticeable only on that account.
She had long had an inclination for chronic complaints,
but Elsa's unsparing ridicule had kept it under;
when she left, it cropped out. Gilbert, her
husband, naturally a silent man, became more so
under this tic-douloureux influence; home was
finally but a deposit for clean shirts, his Bible, and
the temple of his meals. Year by year he had
grown a part of the "choring" institution which
belongs to all respectable families, for Jason had
given him full power to trade, train and work the
live stock, and it was more interesting to him than
human beings. Any thing transpiring outside of
his occupation should be disposed of and forgotten
as soon as possible; death, marriage, religion,
politics, caused time to be lost, which must be
made up by extra diligence in his business. But
Gilbert was most respectable in all his ways, and
bore a high reputation as a "hired man."</p>

<p>Mary made various comments on the subject of
Parke's leaving home, which he answered promptly,
and so completely that it was not renewed.</p>

<p>"Philippa thinks she feels bad about his being
away," said Mary, "and she does; but she would
feel worse if she was me; besides, she is a young
girl."</p>

<p>"I expect she does," Gilbert answered; "and
what if she does? Young gals always feel bad
about something; they haven't got anything else
to do; it's a pity there is gals."</p>

<p>"Mr. Auster does less than ever; but he is no
trouble at all in the house."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary for him to negotiate round&mdash;that's
my business. Folks that have learned trades
never amount to much. As for trouble, I should
like to know if men are ever troublesome? they
don't meddle with things of no concern to them."</p>

<p>"Nothing must be meddled with but cattle, according
to your way of thinking. Cattle are not of
much importance."</p>

<p>"If there was more attention paid to cattle,
there wouldn't be so much trouble among folks.
If you knew something about critturs, perhaps you
would be easier; take my advice at present,
though, and just attend to your house-work, and
your ague, and let the rest go."</p>

<p>So Philippa was allowed to rest under a cloud,
without further notice. It was a murky, smothering
vapor which enveloped her; her sympathies
were exhausted; she found nothing efficacious in
herself, or in those about her. She said of herself,
that the threads of her being were ravelled,
because that which had knit them together into a
consistent web had vanished, and could nowhere
be found.</p>

<p>Jason took to fancy-carpentering; day after day
she heard the whistling of his plane or the turning-lathe,
in a little room which he had converted into
a workshop. His labor must have been tedious
and slow, for no article appeared as its result; but,
as Mary said, he was no trouble. Philippa saw
little of him, and the time she passed in his presence
belonged merely to the routine with which he
was connected. But the cold, dull, spiritless
sphere where she moved contained a vivid, palpable
core, which the virgin silence of his soul prevented
him from laying bare. To his simple mind
it appeared as if all nature now had his secret&mdash;or
why should he feel so strange a joy in those wild
winter days! The driving snows, the cold rains
which dashed round the walls, the misty sea sobbing
under the rim on the shore, or whirling on the
tide the jagged ice, or congealing in gray calm the
northern gales which bore the prolonged cries of
the deep into the naked woods, the wintry sunlight
which fell on their delicate black boughs&mdash;on the
level, brown sodden fields, the moonlight rolling
over the ancient town in a tumult of clouds&mdash;exhilarated
him as with wine.</p>

<p>The winter was an awful one. Storm followed
storm; between December and February the
roads were scarcely passable, and no vessel
put out to sea. The old people talked of the
memorable snows and gales in Crest, and said
none severer were in their annals. The house was
so cold that Philippa closed the parlor where the
piano was, and the dining-room connected with it,
leaving for occupation the small east parlor, which
was attached to the kitchen by a square passage&mdash;a
bedroom in the Squire's time. She gave no reason
for selecting this room, nor did she explain why
she brought from the garret a set of old Indian
chintz curtains, whose deep yellow ground was
covered with long-tailed macaws in brilliant
dyes, and hung them before the windows; there
were three in the room, two facing the terrace, beyond
which, through the leafless shrubs, a line of
sea was visible, and one in the end wall, from which
the prospect was cut off by the row of Scotch firs
which bordered that side of the yard. To this
window she brought her work-basket, inkstand,
portfolio, and a few books; but she never looked
out of the front windows, always keeping the curtains
down. Here she set up a methodical system
of passing all the hours of daylight, and to Jason
the spot grew more and more intelligible. His
meals were served there, and in the evening he
allowed himself a chair by the fire while he smoked
a cigar. Never in the habit of conversing with her,
his silence was not remarked, and she made no
effort to break it. As neither had discerned the
beginning of the drama which united them years
ago, and as one was blind, and the other dumb&mdash;"what
sequel?" Fate, however, was in her house
and as much at home in that insignificant spot,
with those insignificant persons, as she was when
she sat watching Napoleon on his march to Russia.
While Jason sat by the fire in the evening, Philippa
remained by the window sewing interminable
seams; when he left the room, she folded her
work, and after turning down the lamp, moved to
the hearth, and ruminated by the firelight till bedtime.
Her thoughts were not confided to the
portfolio even, for she never opened it; perhaps
their endless repetition required no aid. Though
the same ground was canvassed night after night,
the embers and ashes made no reply; they listened
in obstinate silence to her questioning cries. Why
was it ordered that she should have no wishes
granted? Had she asked so much? Were the
environments of her life so pleasant naturally that
they must be beset with crosses? Was it supposed
that she could bear these crosses with resignation,
or cast them away as the evils of a day? These
she asked, with a dogged hate towards the power
she questioned. Jason guessed the tenor of her
feelings, and, until he heard her foot upon the
stairs, the signal that she was going to bed, he
lurked in some dark room or passage: and then
went back to her place, and looked into the fire,
and round the walls, as if he might find some clue
by which to lead her from the labyrinth of her
misery. His soul at this period, and in such
moments, if delineated, would make a picture as
affecting and as incomprehensible as those which
travelers discover in strange lands, where Nature
creates and wastes things of beauty, which thus
accidentally fall under human vision for the first
and last time.</p>

<p>Happily there is compensation for the soul for
the loss of all it can create. Jason's spirit, pure
and simple as the elements, was dominated by an
absolute and profound sentiment that made the
life-long wilderness of his heart blossom like the
rose. He was not happy, he was without hope; yet
every hour was exquisitely dear and necessary to
him. Philippa, for whom he lived&mdash;his consciousness
now dared to own, for whom he would die&mdash;existed
in the exclusive atmosphere divided between
them only; so surely was she enclosed with him,
that it seemed as if the fact had been accomplished
by a band of conspirators, who carried out by intuition
the wishes he had never expressed. For the
present this sentiment sufficed him; its power paralyzed
its inevitable growth. But the time approached
when it would no longer confine him,
when the symbols which now enchanted would
mock him to break them like straw.</p>

<p>Week glided after week, leaving the inmates of
the old mansion imprisoned in their ways, as fixed,
to all appearance, as</p>

<p>"Those old portraits of old kings<br/>

That watch the sleepers from the wall,"</p>

<p>in the Sleeping Beauty's palace.</p>

<p>The last of February he launched his boat again,
and, while sailing over the bay, he summed up
the days which had passed without an object, without
intentions, and thought their flight had been
rapid as an arrow's, while the flight of other, ordinary
days was fluttering and devious, like flocks of
birds.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

</div>

<p>PHILIPPA, with her chin on the sill, was looking
out of the parlor window one morning at
the black stalks protruding from patches of
ice, and the brown birds that hopped in the fir-branches,
or ran over the snow with alert dipping
motions, and thinking that she should be sorry
when the winter was over. She had felt it a protection,
shielding her mood with its inclement spirit.
With the spring she must resume something of her
old life. The twigs yonder, that had kept upright
in spite of the winter storms&mdash;what were they hoping?&mdash;that
they might drop at last, when new
leaves pushed through the mold? Fresh leaves,
blossoms, and fruit! Her faded self was apart
from them&mdash;yet the breath of spring must have
touched her, for she thought of the deserted hill,
its rocks, the old cedars, and the oaks. Then the
picture of the house, opened, as it used to be in
summer, rose before her; she heard the sound of
the summer sea again, and felt its cool, moist balm
in the darkened rooms; its murmur crept into the
parlor where the piano stood, and mingled with the
melody of a wild pathetic waltz, whose eternal
round involved <i>Parke</i> forever and forever!</p>

<p>She rushed to the window, thrust the curtains
apart, and sprang on a chair, to get a glimpse of
the outlet of the bay. The tide was out, for the
boulders on Gull's Point stood high from the
water; behind them was the outlet&mdash;a purple bar
of sea and cloud joined together. A boat shot
within the range of her vision, with sail looming
against the rocks; its hull bulged out of the water,
its side plowed the waves; she longed to be in it,
steering for another world, which might give
her Crest as it had been in the past. She made a
descent from the chair, and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Speaking presently, "Mary," she asked, "do you
think Mr. Auster is out with his boat?"</p>

<p>"He has been outside the Point every day this
week. He calls the weather <i>mild</i>.  It is blowing
great guns outside, I'll warrant; but if he likes it
it is all right. Mrs. Rogers has sent you a bit of a
billet by Bill Smith's boy; he told me what was in
it. She wants to come and spend to-morrow afternoon
with you, for she has some news to bring."</p>

<p>"Certainly; where's the boy?"</p>

<p>"He is coming back for the answer when he
darn pleases, he said, which will be in the course
of an hour. We ought to make cake; do you
recollect how long it is since you made any?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"'Twas the day when your father came in the
kitchen, and said the little tins reminded him of his
sins&mdash;the very last of October."</p>

<p>"And he said, '<i>Come</i>,'" Philippa murmured. "If
I had answered 'Yes,' what should I be with
<i>them?</i>"</p>

<p>Mary stared at her, and raising her voice, as if
addressing a deaf person, asked, "You don't realize,
I guess, that you have been eating my doughnuts,
and cookies, and gingerbread all this time;
plenty of them, such as they were."</p>

<p>Philippa's eyes were fixed on some remote boundary;
still she did not hear Mary, who peevishly exclaimed:
"She's off to South America. I trust
she will get back in time to give that boy an
answer; he is a sass-box, that boy."</p>

<p>But Philippa was nearer home, and grappling
with an irritating conviction, which the recollection
of that last interview with her father caused. If, at
this moment, she was with Parke, she felt there
would be a sediment in her satisfaction, because
her plans would be thwarted. Away from Crest,
he could not be to her what she had believed he
would be. The conviction was humiliating.</p>

<p>The boy returned, and her reverie was broken.
A message was sent to Mrs. Rogers; and Philippa,
roused with the necessity of doing away her ill
opinion of herself by exertion in somebody's behalf,
not only made cake, but went all over the
house, opened closets, drawers, and windows. By
night, she was in a different mood. Mary noticed
the change. She had heard an unwonted slamming
of doors, and mentioned it to Gilbert, who
replied that he supposed she was feeling her oats.
When Jason come home, wet, cold, and hungry,
Philippa had subsided into her old place by the
window, and was engaged with a book. While he
was drinking his tea with wondering eyes, he
noticed that the long-closed curtains before the
front windows were drawn apart, and asked her if
she had been looking for spring.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "has it come?"</p>

<p>"I heard a frog last night; don't the verse-makers
call the frog 'spring's harbinger'?"</p>

<p>"I don't read verses: but I fancy it was the cowslip
and the violet instead."</p>

<p>"What are you reading?"</p>

<p>"Robinson Crusoe."</p>

<p>"Robinson Crusoe!"</p>

<p>He finished his tea in silence, and she went on
with her book.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards, he knocked the ashes
from his cigar, and asked her if she intended to
plant the terrace.</p>

<p>"I have not thought about it; the geraniums
are dead in the cellar, Mary says."</p>

<p>"Shall I send for some new ones?"</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"So I thought."</p>

<p>"I never was very fond of flowers," she
answered in an apologetic tone, shutting her
book.</p>

<p>"Why don't Ritchings come here any more?"
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"He was here last week. By the way, Mrs.
Rogers has asked for an invitation to pass to-morrow
afternoon with me."</p>

<p>"She has heard from Sam, then. What is Mr.
Ritchings doing? How is his sore throat?"</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Ritchings!"</p>

<p>"Why is he poor? Because he is madly in love
with you?"</p>

<p>The tone of his voice was savage, and she looked
at him, coloring with surprise.</p>

<p>"A woman despises a man," he continued, "for
loving her, unless she happens to return his love;
is it not so? Inform me; I am green about the
sentiments."</p>

<p>"Jason!"</p>

<p>"How is it, I ask, between you and the parson?
Have you a contempt for him?"</p>

<p>An angry gesture was all her answer.</p>

<p>"Why don't you pity him?"</p>

<p>"Pity a man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a man needs it, I assure you, more than a
woman ever does."</p>

<p>"You may console Mr. Ritchings, since that is
your opinion," she answered, leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Every evening," he said to himself, "for three
months, she has kept me in this place, and then,
by some damnable force or unrelenting magnetism,
compelled me to leave it; but to-night <i>I</i> have sent
her away,&mdash;not in a nice manner, perhaps&mdash;but she
is gone, and I feel as if the room was in a state of
arrest."</p>

<p>He looked over the little table which stood by
the window; it was more disordered than usual,
and his eye fell on a daguerreotype. He recognized
it, and opened the case. It contained a
picture of his wife, taken some ten years before.
She looked at him from behind the glass, with her
cold, hard, glittering eyes; the lines of her mouth,
the black crisp curls over her polished forehead,
were no more rigid in the picture than he remembered
them in life. It was a stern relief to gaze at
the face which had always been inscrutable to him.
Could there have been any communion between
their spirits, he would have said: "Behold me
without the imposition laid upon me by you." He
would have asked, if she had yet learned the
secret of the destiny which had bound them together,
without the aim of self-advantage, or of the
higher or more exalted feelings. Though her
spirit was unseen, and silent as its image in his
hand, he closed the case with the feeling of having
made her the witness of his past and present conscience;
it was washed clean for the future. He
sought out the remaining contents of the table,
and detected a dilapidated pocket-book, with the
name of "Parke Auster," in half-obliterated gilt
letters stamped upon it; inserting his long fingers
into one of its compartments, he drew out a bill
for some sheets of music, and a little bunch of
dried flowers.</p>

<p>"The geraniums are all dead in the cellar,"
quoth Jason.</p>

<p>In another, he found a battered silver sixpence,
strung on a faded silk string, and a card, with
"Theresa Bond, 49 Graham Place," engraved
upon it.</p>

<p>"Philippa has been stirring about the house today,
and opened her graves," he said, throwing the
pocketbook into the fire. "Theresa's call is
returned, and the silver sixpence goes back to the
furnace. Parke has turned the key on his memories,
and I'll lock up Philippa's."</p>

<p>He found nothing more to attract speculation,
and after finding her place in Robinson Crusoe,
and reading a few pages, folded his arms on the
table, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was off by daybreak, Mary told Philippa,
with his dogs, a chunk of bread, and a surveyor's
scale; so she guessed he was up in the wood-lots.
Before tea-time he was at home, and, contrary to
his custom, went at once to the parlor, where he
found Mrs. Rogers, as cheerful, talkative, and
friendly as if she had seen him but the day before,
when, in fact, they had not met since the day of
Sarah's funeral, more than eight months ago. As
he had surmised, she brought a letter from Sam,
and the early part of her visit had been consumed
by its perusal, and the development of her feelings
concerning him. The letter was graphic, and
Philippa laughed over his account of a "bear-grab"&mdash;his
meeting with a dingy fellow on the ice, in
search of the northwest passage, who had, in the
warmth of his greeting, clawed him unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"I wish Sam would come home," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Now, do you? he'd be clawed home, as well as
abroad, poor fellow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what paws of velvet can do,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Cats'?"</p>

<p>"Women's paws, Philippa."</p>

<p>"Who could have the heart to torment the best
man I ever knew?"</p>

<p>"That's what I say; but did you never know of
anybody that might do it?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>Philippa blushed like a blaze of brushwood at
the intrusive torch which Mrs. Rogers applied to her.</p>

<p>"Philippa," she said, "this letter has rather
stirred me up, and I have made up my mind to
give you a piece of it, because I love you, my dear,
and because I want to see you differently situated.
I never should have opened my mouth if Parke
hadn't left you; now you know he has, you needn't
fire up&mdash;I know what's what. In my opinion, and
I tell you candidly, I wouldn't dare mention it if
Sam wasn't on the other side of Jordan, as it were,
clawed with bears and harpooned by whales,&mdash;but
as it is, it is my opinion that Sam Rogers adores
the ground you tread on."</p>

<p>"He doesn't," said Philippa, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he does; but he has had his reasons
for keeping dark; he might have been afraid of
interfering, or of looking too high. But things are
changed. What you have, you know, is your own
now, and you have got to keep it, too; and Sam is
a captain, able to hold his own anywhere; and a
sensible, better man never walked."</p>

<p>"He would not thank you for this. I am glad
he is thousands of miles from me."</p>

<p>"Of course, he wouldn't thank me&mdash;children
never thank their parents; but <i>you</i> ought to thank
me, for wanting to give you something worth living
for. You know in your heart of hearts that Sam
would stop at no sacrifice for your sake. What ails
him? You didn't fall in love with him, that's all.
Do you suppose the married state is a state of
being in love?"</p>

<p>"I believe that he would sacrifice his happiness
for me, but I could not accept it from him. I shall
not marry Sam, Mrs. Rogers."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't offer anybody else; but what are
you going to do&mdash;marry Jason?"</p>

<p>The question fell on Philippa like a thunderbolt;
Mrs. Rogers was scared at her aspect.</p>

<p>"Do you dare say that?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Others say that he will marry."</p>

<p>"I tell you that I will make no change&mdash;he will
make none&mdash;we shall live on the same terms as
now. Oh the cowardly world, that invents what it
contemns!"</p>

<p>"You lamb, you are dreadfully earnest; but
Jason is a man, my dear; do not believe that he is
going to be mewed up this way forever."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Every man has in his life a period of breaking
out. It has always seemed to me that Jason has
never had his turn; there is something smouldering
in him, you may be sure. I presume he is not
aware of it himself, but it will make no difference,
he will have his day, according to his nature. I
have noticed, over and over again, that men belie
the character the world and circumstances give
them. There was Lem Baker, till forty-nine he
was a sober man, spoke at all the temperance
meetings, and never showed the least mercy for
those who tasted ardent spirits; before he was
fifty, he was an awful drunkard. And there was
Eben Millet, who was so devoted to his wife, and
always leading about his children; one scarce ever
saw him without a child fastened to his forefinger,
and he was always talking about what his wife
thought and said and did; but on the fifteenth
year of his marriage, he went mad after a young
woman, who drove him to his grave."</p>

<p>"These cases do not prove what the race is."</p>

<p>"Race! there isn't but one race all over the
world, and Jason belongs to it,"</p>

<p>"The groveling fools talk about him, do they?
Why do people marry twice?"</p>

<p>"Although I have been married twice, I don't
think I can tell you."</p>

<p>"I did not know it."</p>

<p>"The first time was long before you were
born, when Sarah Parke was growing up.  My
second wedding came off when I was twenty-three.
I then married Mr. Rogers, who was forty-three."</p>

<p>"I almost wish myself in the Arctic seas, among
the <i>mute</i> beasts."</p>

<p>"The <i>must be's</i> are there, Philippa, as well as
here; but I am dreadful sorry I have upset you
so. How the afternoon has slipped away! I do
believe it's getting towards five o' clock."</p>

<p>Jason was a welcome sight to her at this moment.
She had been no advantage to Philippa,
that was certain; but what would become of the
wilful, innocent, friendless girl, if Jason should
bring a strange woman into the house as his wife?
That jade, Elsa, must have been of her way of
thinking, or she would not have left her. With all
her money, Philippa was no better off than the
poorest girl in Crest with a mother. Mrs. Rogers
felt little disappointment in her scheme as far
as Sam was concerned, for she had the fullest confidence
in his ability to weather any thing, from
Cape Horn to the stormiest passions which rage in
the region of the soul.</p>

<p>They sat down to tea, and her first observation
was, "What a change!" The second embodied a
joke, and the third contained the exclamation,
"Why, Jason, you are getting gray."</p>

<p>"I am old," he replied.</p>

<p>"Philippa is growing old, too; she stays in the
house too much. Did you never think the house
was damp? It has been built near a hundred
years; its beams and foundation must be rotting."</p>

<p>"It may fall on us some day," said Philippa.</p>

<p>"I hope nobody will take the trouble to unroof
us if it happens," said Jason.</p>

<p>"Be sure to let us alone, Mrs. Rogers," Philippa
added.</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Turner's house came down by the
run&mdash;you recollect, Jason," Mrs. Rogers remarked.</p>

<p>But he made no reply; he was occupied in observing
Philippa, for her last remark was an enigma
to him. If Mrs. Rogers had not been there,
he would have prayed for the walls to fall, for the
sake of solving it. She raised her eyes to his face
and was struck with an uneasy surprise; it contained
an information that caused her to look about
her, and discover where she was. With a sudden
instinct, forgetting the presence of Mrs. Rogers,
she asked him where the pocket-book was. He
indicated the fire, and asked her, in a gentle voice,
whether she had finished Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<p>"You haven't thieves in the neighborhood, have
you?" Mrs. Rogers inquired. "Becky Freeman
was telling me that her chickens had disappeared
lately."</p>

<p>"I should not be surprised if we had," cried
Philippa; "how can we punish them?"</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of rubbish, that might as
well be stolen as not," said Jason; "why should
we punish one for taking what he can't get except
by stealing?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jason, where's your religion?" asked
Mrs. Rogers.</p>

<p>"Safe enough; whenever I want to use it, it will
be at hand."</p>

<p>An argument set in between them, which was
closed by her declaring that she must go home, and
attend to her cat and parrot. Philippa accompanied
her to the gate, and watched her down the
street; instead of returning to the parlor, she
went to her chamber, and spent the evening in
darkness.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

</div>

<p>"IT is most time," said Mary, as she was taking
up the ashes in the parlor fireplace, "to be
thinking of pine boughs for the jambs, instead of
live coals."</p>

<p>"Pine boughs," echoed Jason, with a dreamy
stare at the ashes, "we won't have any."</p>

<p>"It is a very warm day, for the time of year;
the sooner we go to house-cleaning, the better."</p>

<p>"Don't upset things, Mary."</p>

<p>"This room can remain as it is for a while
longer; Philippa takes good care of it. I often
find her dusting and setting things to rights at odd
times, but she don't seem to care for the rest of the
house any longer; she hasn't said a word for or
against a thing that has happened since Parke
went away."</p>

<p>"Ah! Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"She's up-stairs; she said, just before you came
in, that she should soon remove her work-basket to
her own chamber."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"It will be cold this evening, for the wind has
changed, and a good fire will be wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I am going to the Comet
Rocks to-day; put off supper until I come back."</p>

<p>Surprised at the unusual request, she asked him
if there was more company to-day again; he repled
that he might possibly bring home some fish&mdash;that
was reason enough, was it not?</p>

<p>Afterwards she told Philippa that a word mustn't
be said against a late supper that night, for there
would be a reason for it. With the change of
wind a storm came up before sunset, which Gilbert
said was the sheep-storm; the air was filled with
a cold, rolling mist, rising and falling over the
town, as the wind compelled. Philippa, in the
restlessness which had lately come upon her,
watched its rifts, which disclosed glimpses of gray
water passing the shore in dismal haste, and masses
of half-opened leaves shedding showers of condensed
fog, or the dingy umbrellas which wavered
along the street, protecting the few loungers going
between houses and shops. But she was quiet by
the shaded lamp in the parlor, when she heard Jason's
voice in the passage telling Mary that it had
taken him a long time to tack across the bay. He
entered, inquiring for his supper, and, contrary to
his wont, in his boating costume, he threw his battered
hat into a corner, and dropped his pilot's
jacket on the Boor. Philippa could not help being
conscious of his proceedings. Would he take off
his boots, she wondered, and suspended her sewing
to look at them; they were wet and heavy, evidently,
and his trousers were tucked into them,
but he made no movement to pull them off. Her
eyes were irresistibly drawn up to meet his&mdash;he was
gazing at her.</p>

<p>"Excuse my boots," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded slightly.</p>

<p>"And allow me to disabuse myself of this
necktie; the ends blew out like a sail, and they
are wet."</p>

<p>He untwisted it as if it had been choking him
and dropped it beside him. She had resumed her
sewing, but she knew when it fell, and she knew,
too, that he was very pale, and that his pale blue
eyes were shining in strange relief against the circle
of his thick, black, curved eyelashes. Mary
had set on the supper, and was gone; but he sat
down by the fire, unmindful of it, till Philippa
called him to the table.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect the fish, Mr. Auster," said Mary,
re-entering with another dish; "so here is something
in the place."</p>

<p>"Fish!" he said, facing round in his chair;
"what fish?"</p>

<p>Philippa looked at her so impatiently that she
thought it best not to answer him, but to disappear
again and leave them to their supper. Philippa
felt there was something dangerous about Jason
just then, and preferred that he should display his
eccentric mood to herself alone.</p>

<p>"You need your tea, Jason," she said, in a conciliatory
voice.</p>

<p>He laughed, stretched out his long arm (for he
had not left the chair), and demanded: "Give it
to me, then. Come and hold the cup to my lips&mdash;I
haven't the strength to do it."</p>

<p>"Nor have I."</p>

<p>His manner, in spite of her cool reply, confused
her a little. Instead of taking her own seat at the
table, she walked round it, with a plate in her
hand, and filled it with bread.</p>

<p>"I say I am thirsty, Philippa, and hungry,&mdash;bring
me something."</p>

<p>"Take it, then." And she gave him a cup of
tea, which he swallowed at once.</p>

<p>"More tea," he begged, "and something to eat,
or I must famish."</p>

<p>She reflected. It was his determination, she perceived,
not to go to the table. She, herself, had
suddenly lost her appetite. It would not do for
Mary to find the supper untouched, and Mary at
that moment represented the whole censorious
world, which Philippa felt for the first time, afraid
of. Seizing the last dish that Mary had brought
in, she threw its contents into the fire, and then
deliberately drank some tea, and ate a morsel of
bread.</p>

<p>"Right," he said, watching her till she had finished
and called Mary in to clear the table. While
it was being done, he thought he detected Philippa
in the act of retreat, which he cut off by promenading
between her and the doors.</p>

<p>"Philippa," he said suddenly wheeling towards
her, when alone, "I am tired of reigning in hell and
serving in heaven. I would be master of Paradise."</p>

<p>"Move to another place, then," she curtly answered,
thinking how much she was to bear from
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Here</i> is my place&mdash;with you. Put down your
foolish work, for I am going to teach you something.
I, <i>Jason</i>&mdash;can you imagine it?"</p>

<p>"No. Is it a necessary knowledge you are
about to teach?"</p>

<p>"I make it so."</p>

<p>He moved a chair opposite her and sat down.
She saw him, but with false eyes. Any other
woman there would have seen a man filled with the
beauty which passion gives to the plainest, the
most simple&mdash;she would have seen her lover,
ardent, resolute, overpowering. Philippa merely
saw him in a position and mood of perplexing inconvenience
which she could not dispose of.
Doubtless he felt her obtuseness, for he remained
silent some minutes, and then prefaced his subject
with the remark: "How the wind howls!"</p>

<p>"Are you listening to that, all this while?" she
asked, irritated at his deliberate propinquity.</p>

<p>"Philippa, how do you think I have lived?"</p>

<p>"I know how, without thinking."</p>

<p>"What has been my value?"</p>

<p>"Value?"</p>

<p>"I have been a husband, a father, and your
guardian; was I any thing else?"</p>

<p>"No, not to me."</p>

<p>"I was nothing to myself, either,&mdash;for a long
time, a long time."</p>

<p>"Why should you have been more, sir? Your
relations implied all the possibilities of life."</p>

<p>"It implied little with me beyond duty. Reflect."</p>

<p>The memory of Sarah's loveless ways, of Parke's
indifferent neglect, was too clear for her not to follow
his suggestion. But what was all this to her?
The result of his life was like that of hers&mdash;disappointment;
and he must tell of it, perhaps with the
hope of convincing her that it was the common lot.</p>

<p>"You found no satisfaction in duty! Who
does? Something that we esteem, however,
pushes us on towards its aim, as strenuously as if it
were our most beautiful ideal. You wish me to
understand that you are disappointed."</p>

<p>"I was not disappointed, for I hoped nothing.
I never, at any time, in youth or manhood, was in
a position that might have accepted hope."</p>

<p>A comprehension of his intention dawned in her
mind, which he perceived by a change in her countenance.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to admit," he continued, "that
I have done well as a chrysalis? or do you intend
to warn me presently that if I break through the
traditions built round me by the masons who mortar
the mass together by plummet and line, I shall
be deprived of every claim of support from my fellows?"</p>

<p>She began to feel the recklessness which always
came over her when she was in collision with an
antagonist.</p>

<p>"Have you a hope now, Jason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one that a free man is entitled to."</p>

<p>She started to her feet, but he compelled her
back to her chair.</p>

<p>"You are going to tell me that you love me.
Well, begin, so that it may end."</p>

<p>"I love you, Philippa&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes shot sparkles and her lips made a
mocking motion, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>"And I ask you to be my wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>A gesture of anger did not deter him in his
speech.</p>

<p>"The slow years having taught me what manner
of man I am, and, with a patience equal to my own,
removed all obstacles to my desires, do you believe
that I shall not conquer your will&mdash;it shall not
stand in my way. Accept me, Philippa."</p>

<p>"Parke! Parke! Parke!" she said, between her
teeth.</p>

<p>"Will you make <i>father</i> and <i>son</i> a watchword?
Let the world do that; but, Philippa, <i>you</i> know
that I have been faithful to him till there is no need
of faith. What! Would you like to say that I am
like a whipped hound, slinking back to the place of
contention, to hold the rights I could not maintain,
except alone?"</p>

<p>He caught her hands, and drew her so near him
that she was obliged to meet his burning, pleading,
indignant eyes, and to dwell on his quivering lips,
which were as white as death. It was more than
she could bear; but she must still listen.</p>

<p>"If your love, which is now mere pride with
you, had remained where it had its birth, in the
depths of your <i>self</i>, instead of governing your
actions, blazoning itself on your existence, it would
be easy to turn its current into that vague, emotional
sea which ebbs and flows in every human
soul, but which does not sway its destiny, unless,
as you have, one commits his emotion to the public.
Who may not have felt as you have felt? We
are much alike."</p>

<p>"Now, have you finished?"</p>

<p>He passed his handkerchief over his face, to hide
a sickening agitation, for the struggle shattered
him. Philippa was so pitiless! Hard and bright
as a diamond, cold as a glacier, ignorant, obstinate,
insensible&mdash;and yet he loved her so that he swore
silently that he would never go beyond the spot
that contained her.</p>

<p>She drew her watch from her belt, and turned its
face towards him.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is late," he said.</p>

<p>Then he folded his arms and walked up and
down the floor, stopping before her at each turn, to
meet the eyes of a combatant determined to end
the subject at once and forever.</p>

<p>The fire went out, the astral lamp waned, the
storm died away, the rain ceased to beat against
the windows, the wind to roar round the house, but
the sea bayed the shore with a monotonous roar,
which echoed through the room. He resumed his
seat, and fell into deep thought. The years that
he had boasted of had cheated him after all&mdash;they
had not given him the key to Philippa's nature.
She herself did not possess it, he was convinced.
To open those sealed perceptions, that was his task&mdash;how
could it be done, where was the key? She
thought, at last, so absorbed he seemed, that he
must have forgotten her&mdash;she rose without attracting
his attention, went to the door, paused, and
looked back. Something in his attitude and his
profile gave her an impulse to go and shake him by
the shoulder, and ask him what his thoughts were;
resisting that, she was weak enough to stand by
the door, till he carelessly raised his head, and
turned to look at her. An expression of pity
and doubt passed over his face, which was now
perfectly composed, and gave her a bitter sense
of humiliation; her brain, her heart, her eyelids
were burdened with a weight which bore her
to the floor. With a faint gasp, and throwing up
her arms to drive it away, she fell forward, and he
caught her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>

</div>

<p>PHILIPPA wrote Theresa Bond, and begged
her to come to Crest. Though the letter merely
outlined the events of the past year, omitting all
mention of Jason, Theresa read it with an impression
that it had been dictated by stronger feelings
than she had given Philippa credit for possessing.
She replied that curiosity, and <i>redivivus</i> also,
tempted her to accept the invitation, but she could
not, because she was about to be married to a
youth who would not permit her to leave him. She
pretended to ascribe his refusal to a base jealousy
of the past, which she had made him acquainted
with. Philippa could imagine how  she  wanted to
come&mdash;what a monumental time they might have!
Had Philippa found a confessor yet? Was she
prepared to own that the beautiful Parke hadn't
proved a joy forever? Justice must be done him,
however; she, herself, was obliged to admit
that there had never been the shadow of deceit in his
conduct towards her. How was Cousin Jason?
Was he an exception to the sex, in the character of
a bereaved husband? Or, was he already on the
point of falling in love? She didn't believe, by the
way, that he ever had been in love; she thought
him like the aloe&mdash;that he wouldn't bloom till
towards a hundred. Think of the woman who
could gather the blossom! "Stuff," thought
Philippa, "I wish she would come and take it; I
dare say she would try." The letter concluded
with an invitation to her wedding, not yet appointed.</p>

<p>Jason brought Theresa's letter to her, and asked
what its contents were.</p>

<p>"I sent for Theresa to visit me," she replied.</p>

<p>An angry cloud spread over his face, and his
eyes flashed; it gratified her to see the calmness
which had possessed him, since their last interview,
broken up.</p>

<p>"You sent for her as a protection against me,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes; I did not know what else to do," she replied,
ingenuously.</p>

<p>"She has not accepted the invitation!"</p>

<p>"She cannot come."</p>

<p>"She will not come. Theresa understands me."</p>

<p>Philippa looked at the letter in her hand with
astonishment. Could he read it from the outside?</p>

<p>"How do you know she understands you?"</p>

<p>"Because she is a woman who has been taught
by her passion."</p>

<p>"It is a pity she is not here."</p>

<p>"It is not a pity; it is enough for me to witness
your heart of ice and steel."</p>

<p>"What do you make me out to be? I never was
romantic&mdash;less so now than ever. <i>I</i> see myself, as
a young woman, refusing to marry a man with
whom she has lived as a relative."</p>

<p>For the life of her she could not name the character
of the relation; he never had appeared like
a father, and she had never thought of him as a
brother.</p>

<p>"That is the arithmetic of the subject," he
answered.</p>

<p>"There are other reasons, too."</p>

<p>"Reasons?"</p>

<p>"Why I should not listen to you, even."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Philippa, there are none. Give me
your conscience, your will; I can keep them from
tormenting you. Shelter yourself in the abyss of
my love, which is as wide and deep as the air."</p>

<p>He was beside her chair&mdash;on the floor at her
feet; she could not resist his folding her in his
arms, nor move her head from his breast; but she
could shut her eyes against him, and she did.</p>

<p>"Little flower," he said, "live with me and be
happy, as I shall be happy."</p>

<p>She was like a statue.</p>

<p>"Give me," and he shook her in his embrace,
"this Philippa&mdash;this solitary, friendless girl, to be
the life of this solitary, friendless man."</p>

<p>No answer came from her; but when he sighed
like one in pain she opened her eyes, and they
looked upon each other from the prison of the
soul. They saw that their personality was a sacred
essence that could not be tampered with, and then
each spirit retreated to its confines. His eyes
rested on the beautiful lips, so near his own.</p>

<p>"May I kiss you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You hold me here by force; why ask for such
a trifle, that depends on your will?"</p>

<p>Although her sweet, warm breath made the current
of his blood thunder in heart and brain, he
released her as if she were a log.</p>

<p>"Does it? Then I shall never kiss you&mdash;<i>never</i>."</p>

<p>"One point, at last, is settled between us."</p>

<p>A long period of silence followed this interview in
which neither looked or spoke to the other. They
met at the table, passed each other in the passages,
or on the stairs, but made no stay together anywhere.
The silence was terminated by Jason's
being obliged to consult her respecting the division
of some land, through which a street had been
cut, into building lots. The land on one side of
the new street belonged to Parke, and that on the
other side was hers. She refused to look at the
diagram of the street.</p>

<p>"You are acting," she said, angrily, "as if Parke
were dead; and I won't sell."</p>

<p>"An agent must follow his instructions. Mine
are to raise money&mdash;to make new streets in the Republic
of Venezuela, probably. The land can be
sold to advantage, if all parties consent; a company
wants both sides of the street. Will you
sell?"</p>

<p>She proposed going to the spot; he consented,
internally cursing the infatuation, which, strong as
it was, had no power to break his own. They had
to cross a field on the outskirts of the town, and
climb a stone wall before reaching the ground.
Jason stepped over the wall with a stride, but
Philippa slipped on a mossy stone, and fell over,
with her dress hanging to it; he was obliged to
extricate her, and laughed as he did so, for which
irreverence she gave his cheek a blow with her
glove. At the next wall he took her in his arms
and carried her past the hedge-row, over a brook
bordered with alder-bushes and wild roses, and
deposited her on the disputed territory. She saw
the advantage at once of breaking up the ground
into building lots; it would increase the value of
the whole tract, especially on that side nearest the
town, which belonged to Parke.</p>

<p>"Sell it, if you choose," she said.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with your share of the
money?"</p>

<p>"Take care of it, as you always have."</p>

<p>"You choose, then, to continue me as your guardian."</p>

<p>Biting her lips, she turned away without being
generous enough to tell him that she would rather
trust him than any man in the world. The anomaly
of her position was most trying&mdash;unheard of,
and yet she had no thought of ever separating
from him. He did not walk beside her, as she had
expected, but remained by the brook, gazing into
its little brown pools, and peeling a willow wand.
When she reached the wall she stopped and looked
back, as she had done once before when he seemed
to forget her! How tall he looked against the
background of the sky! She wondered if that was
the way he passed so much of his time when in the
woods. Perhaps he was poetical; that might be
his musing secret, and he had never found anybody
to share it with. He was a strange man.
Living to live apart from human sympathy so many
years, why had he at last loved and sought her?
Tears surprised her&mdash;an involuntary tribute paid
to the honor and generosity of his nature, which
she could not suppress. He looked up suddenly,
and, observing her standing by the wall, hurried
up to her, with a gentle apology for keeping her
waiting. They returned through the main street,
and she was perplexed in trying to recall the time
when they walked together last. The street looked
pleasant, with its willows, deep yards full of lilacs
and rose-bushes on one side, and its quaint, miscellaneous
shops on the other, and she said so.
He pointed to the sea, which appeared to be wedging
up between the storehouses on the upper part
of the street, and told her how it looked the night
before in moonlight. He sauntered along the
street, and she was compelled to regulate her gait
by his. They met many people, but she noticed
that none accosted him; his slight nods were returned
by marked respect, and he was closely observed
by all who passed him with a certain air of
curiosity which puzzled her.</p>

<p>The walk induced a restlessness which would
not permit her to resume her in-door employments;
she had suddenly acquired a longing for
change, and bethought her of a promise made to
Elsa, of a two or three days' visit. She packed a
valise on the spur of the recollection, and started
for Elsa's with Gilbert. On her arrival, she found
that Elsa had been expecting her, and her reception
was a warm one. Gilbert was directed to
tell Jason not to send for her; she would take her
own time in returning.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't come, miss," said Elsa, when
they were alone, in two rocking-chairs, "I should
have made my way up to your house; there's
something in this pleasant weather that drives me
wild when I am alone. I look out at the ring of
trees round me, and feel as if they were waiting to
catch me; the fields of green, shining grass are
awful lonesome&mdash;it seems as if all human life had
passed away forever. The seed is all in the
ground, 'tisn't haying yet, and I am put to it to
pass away the time. I wish the Old Harry had the
place."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to own that you are tired of
it?"</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly."</p>

<p>"And that you would like to go back?"</p>

<p>"You've said it."</p>

<p>"What did you ever leave for, you contrary old
woman?" And Philippa felt more provoked than
ever, for having left her alone.</p>

<p>"Never you mind&mdash;I haven't gone back yet. I
don't know whether it is safe."</p>

<p>She looked at Philippa, with such cunning, crafty
eyes that she was disposed to turn away from
them.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Elsa, what an old gipsy you are."</p>

<p>"A dark-complected man is going the same road
that you are. You will meet, if a light-complected
man, who is not thinking of you, does not cross
the seas in three days, three months, or three years.
A piece of bad luck is coming from the Jack of
Spades to you all."</p>

<p>"Patience, and shuffle the cards."</p>

<p>"They are talking about Jason. How is it, Philippa?
I didn't know why I went away hardly, but
you see I found a reason after all. Clouds no
bigger than a man's hand sometimes blow over,
but this hasn't. I do mistrust that Jason means
to marry you. I don't care <i>much</i> whether you
make up your minds, you two, to be yoked together;
but I intend to keep out of the way till it
is settled one way or the other. Sarah Auster
shall not accuse me at the Judgment of making,
or marring; nor shall the tell-tales of Crest accuse
me of match-making."</p>

<p>"It is all settled,"</p>

<p>"Are you sure? I can see by your face which
way."</p>

<p>Without any previous intention of doing so,
Philippa unburdened her mind to Elsa, who heard
the recital of Jason's conduct without a single
comment The representation that Philippa made
placed her conduct in a new light before her own
mental vision, and changed him also; he was a
different man in her description from what he had
appeared in reality, and she could not account
for it.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Elsa, "that I won't come up till
green corn comes."</p>

<p>She would not say another word on the subject,
but she was astonished at the insight she had
obtained into Jason's character; making an
excuse to Philippa, she went into the garden,
with the feint of picking green gooseberries to
stew.</p>

<p>"Did you ever," she said, under her breath, as
if addressing the gooseberry-bush confidentially,
"hear the like before? It is certain to my mind,
that Sarah had no more comprehension what kind
of man she had for a husband than I have had;
live and learn, though. It is well she died. Come
to think of it, there was never any love lost between
them. Poor Sarah! I wonder I didn't see
him better&mdash;he is a remarkable man; but his fire
was put out by the Parke sun&mdash;that's the truth.
Who hasn't been put out by them, if in their way?
And Philippa's trying to put him out too, but he
has got the best of her, I'll bet. But I must stay
a while longer in my jail."</p>

<p>She carried in her gooseberries, and told Philippa
to pick them over. Then she brought out
some ends of muslin and lace, and set her to cap-making.
Various other matters were entered upon,
which seemed unimportant to Philippa, but they
served Elsa's purpose, to keep up a desultory conversation
and restore composure.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>

</div>

<p>ELSA stipulated for a week; it came to a close
before Philippa heard from home; then some
unexpected news was brought from the shore by
Clapp, who had gone thither for some stores. As
he heard it, he said, he would tell them, but
couldn't say whether the particulars were just so.
It was on a Tuesday, the day after Philippa
left her house, that Jason Auster went to the woods
with his gun, and was found there by Jehu Bates,
insensible, and with his right hand blown off at the
wrist. He lay right in a pool of blood, that made
Jehu Bates sick; but had sense enough to hold up
Jason's arm, and to tie his whip-lash round it,
which stopped the blood's running, and brought
him to so that he was able to walk to Jehu Bates's
ox-cart, that was in the woods after a cord or two
of yellow pine; and Jehu Bates brought him home,
where he now lay in a raging fever.</p>

<p>"He's been there ever since Tuesday," screamed
Elsa, "and now it's Saturday, and we have not
been sent for."</p>

<p>"Maybe he is out of his head," was Clapp's consolatory
reason for the omission.</p>

<p>With strangely cold, tremulous fingers Philippa
began to fold the articles that were to be packed
in her valise, and arranged them as leisurely and
carefully as though she were not thinking of what
she had just heard. Nothing seemed so plain to
her, so imperative, as the getting of her hair-brush,
her thimble, her shoes into this valise; but every
instant a weight was growing heavier and heavier
upon her, which impeded her progress, and was
forcing time to stand still with her, while it sped
with Jason, hurrying him to his last hour. Elsa
broke the spell by asking her if she was ready;
her own bonnet was on, and the wagon was at the
door.</p>

<p>"The corn that I didn't think of may be ripe
for the harvest," she thought; "I must go and
see it gathered."</p>

<p>Every step of the way she urged Clapp to "gee
up," or they wouldn't reach the house time enough
to be of the least use to anybody. They soon
clattered into the premises by the barnyard gate,
and she started for the porch door like a deer, forgetting
Philippa, in her eagerness to get into the
house and resume its duties, exactly at the point
where she had left them months ago. Philippa
looked over the orchard paling, and at the hill, for
it might be her last view of their familiar aspect,
and then walked towards the house with reluctant
feet. On the threshold her heart recoiled against
meeting Jason&mdash;the man she had not loved, but
could not endure to lose.</p>

<p>"Just see," said Elsa, when she entered, "this
ring of ashes on the hearth; kitchen looks as if
it hadn't been inhabited. Mary is up-stairs; the
doctor is dressing the wound. Gilbert is there,
too. Mary says he walks round the chamber outside
Jason's door in his stocking feet, day and
night, just as his dogs do in the yard. She says he
is as rational as she is, which isn't saying much.
You'd better ask the doctor for directions. I hear
him on the stairs."</p>

<p>She gave Philippa no chance, however, to speak
to him, but assailed him with questions, beginning
with asking why in the world he hadn't sent post
haste for her and Philippa. Jason strictly forbade
the sending of any message, he replied, and it
wasn't really necessary; he was getting along very
well, his fever wasn't so high, and unless mortification
set in he would be up in a few days.</p>

<p>"Mortification!" exclaimed Elsa; "do, if you
dare, let that take place."</p>

<p>Philippa slipped out of the kitchen while they
were talking, and went up-stairs. She must see
Jason, and the sooner the shock of the meeting was
over the better for her plan, which was that she
should be his nurse. She entered the chamber,
and found him sleeping. Mary sat by the bed,
fanning away the flies with a bunch of peacock's
feathers.</p>

<p>"Elsa wants you down-stairs," Philippa whispered;
"I'll stay up here now."</p>

<p>Mary relinquished the brush, and crept out,
making a series of contortions to describe the effect
of the accident upon her own condition, but not
daring to speak on account of Jason's slumber.</p>

<p>As soon as Philippa took her seat by the bedside,
he began to sigh, appearing to be in a painful
dream; his lips quivered like a child's, when it is
on the point of weeping grievously for some mysterious
reason. He moved his head from side to
side, but, even in his restless sleep, how motionless
his right arm lay outside the counterpane!
Presently he waved his left hand, and opened his
eyes,</p>

<p>"I thought we were going down," he said,
"water-logged."</p>

<p>His pallid, wandering eyes, and weak, wailing
voice, told her how terrible the accident had proved.
Every thought fled from her, except the one which
made her heart full&mdash;that she must watch him, and
care for him.</p>

<p>"A little water," he begged, without noticing her.</p>

<p>She held a glass to his lips; the diamond ring
caught his attention; he touched it with his finger.</p>

<p>"Philippa, they don't give me half enough water;
won't you let me have more?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He smiled, and tried to wipe his mouth. "It's
awkward with the left hand," he said.</p>

<p>She took the handkerchief from him, and gently
brushed his bearded face with it, and smoothed his
dry, tangled hair. While she was doing this, he
looked at her with a happy, childish gravity, and
said, "The lamp went out last night."</p>

<p>"It shall not happen again."</p>

<p>"Shall you be here all the time?"</p>

<p>"Day and night till you are well."</p>

<p>For the first time he cast a peculiar glance
towards his mutilated arm&mdash;a glance of gratitude;
he was thanking the gun. He looked back again
at Philippa, whose tears were falling in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"You mustn't cry, yellow-bird." But he began
to weep, too, and Elsa, opening the door, found
them both crying.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty one for a sick-room," she
fiercely whispered to Philippa; "clear out, if you
can't do better than this."</p>

<p>Philippa was meekly obeying her, for she felt she
had been guilty of a dangerous, weak display of
feeling, when Jason, his eyebrows knitting with
anger, clutched Elsa by the sleeve, and said, "She
promised to stay. She shan't go. Why have you
come?"</p>

<p>"There, there, Jason; Philippa is only going out
to rest half an hour, and I have only come to take
care of her clothes, and get her meals while she
waits upon you."</p>

<p>"Well, well, that will do." And he closed his
eyes with exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" said Elsa, sarcastically, stepping into
Philippa's room, as soon as he slept again; "you
could not keep from running over, could you? It's
a poor plan to be troubled with feelings at the
wrong time; seems to me you haven't calculated
right, unless you do want to kill him out and
out."</p>

<p>"I'll do what you think best."</p>

<p>"Go back and play cheerful, humor him in every
thing; and, when you can't humor him, cheat him."</p>

<p>"Will he recover?"</p>

<p>"If the Lord wills."</p>

<p>"I asked your opinion."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> dubious; still, my judgment is not worth
much, for I have had no experience in gunpowder
accidents&mdash;except in the case of Eli Coffin, whose
legs were blown a mile into the air, boots and all,
when he was blasting rocks: <i>he</i> died."</p>

<p>Philippa smiled slightly, and Elsa saw her seated
beside Jason again, satisfied that her nerves were
strung to the right pitch for the sick-room.  Her
own spirits rose to the occasion, as they always
did before positive calamity; the perils of the
imagination she could not face, but the plain facts
of misfortune she could endure cheerfully; and she
bore their progress with the more equanimity because
she herself had been so long exempt from the
various distractions of humanity. It was years since
she had suffered an acute mental or physical pain;
her voyage over the sea of trouble appeared to be
ended. This immunity had engendered the grotesque
humor which looked unfeeling, even to herself,
sometimes. She felt so light-hearted at being
able to resume her former sway in the house, that
she tried to account for it on the ground of a special
intervention to the end of bringing her back to the
family, and instinctively threw a sop to Providence
by affirming that Jason would get well to carry out
a scheme which had long been ripening. But Jason
was in no hurry, it seemed, to finish it; his weakness
outlasted the fever which supervened his
wound, till the wound was healed. He maintained
a neutral ground, which neither permitted the invasion
of death, nor allowed the forces of life to
occupy it. In case a struggle should rise between
the two powers, it was evident that he would be
quite indifferent to the result. By no word or token
did he convey to Philippa one remembrance of
his love. After the lash of feeling occasioned by
her return, when his mind was so unhinged, he accepted
her attentions as a soldier, when taken to the
rear, accepts attentions from his passing comrades
going to the front. As his illness continued, her
feelings changed; their law warred with the law
of her will. Their development was sanctioned by
his inability to triumph over them, either from
abstraction, blindness, or inclination. In spite of
her being shut in that darkened room so many
hours, her eyes grew bright, and the fine gold of her
hair seemed to gain luster. Elsa's sharp wits discerned
the change. She took occasion one day,
when Gilbert, who sometimes relieved Philippa, was
present, to suggest to Jason the propriety of his
recovery, in order to give Philippa a chance to have
a fit of sickness.</p>

<p>"Isn't she well? he asked.</p>

<p>"How can anybody be well who does not undress
of nights, has odd naps on sofas, and gets
no regular meals?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Has she been here every
night?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; haven't you been aware of it,
Jason?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I must have been, but took no
thought of it; I have troubled her too much,
then!"</p>

<p>"Oh no! A helpless man, six feet without his
stockings, with one&mdash;with only one person in his
family besides himself, is no trouble or anxiety to
that person. Oh no!"</p>

<p>He sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"Gilbert must stay up here more. Can't you,
old fellow? I am no more stupid than your
oxen."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," said Gilbert; "but 'pears to me
you are gaining now, and the cattle ain't; 'cause
you see nobody understands 'em but me, and I
don't know as anybody understands me but them;
and so it 'pears as if somebody might do better for
you than I can."</p>

<p>"How do you feel to-day, Jason?" asked Elsa.</p>

<p>"The doctor will tell you."</p>

<p>"If you don't know how you are, it is a sign you
are better. You must sit up, Jason&mdash;your strength
will never come back unless you try for it. Pull
him out of bed, Gilbert, but don't gee and haw too
much about it. Jason, if you don't get well, every
thing will go to rack and ruin."</p>

<p>"Where's my clothes?" asked Jason. "Help
me up, Gilbert; I thought I was too weak, but
Elsa knows best."</p>

<p>"Mercy on me," said Elsa, leaving the room in
search of some clothes for him. "The loss of that
hand seems to have changed his sex. He is as
spleeny as Mary; but he is coming out of that bed,
anyhow."</p>

<p>About nine o'clock that evening Gilbert made
his appearance in Jason's room in a pair of list
shoes and a woollen night-cap.</p>

<p>"Where is Philippa?" Jason asked, with some
energy.</p>

<p>"I am here," she answered, without leaving the
sofa, which the bed-curtains intercepted from his
view.</p>

<p>"You are too far off for me to speak to you."</p>

<p>Surmising what he had to say, she went to his
bedside.</p>

<p>"You have been here all this time, Philippa&mdash;it
has been hard for you; I have not known it always&mdash;I
thought you were in and out, and time has
passed so. I must have confounded night with
day. You must let Gilbert relieve you."</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered, with a pain in her
heart, because he had not always known she was
there&mdash;near him. "Good-night."</p>

<p>Gilbert snored so at his post that Jason kept
awake half the night, and finally told him to go to
the devil.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>

</div>

<p> A FEW hours of complete solitude, or his effort
of will, placed Jason on the road to recovery.
But convalescence has its pangs, and
it was some days before he left his chamber. In
that period the anniversary of Sarah's death
occurred. It was passed by him in gloomy silence.
Elsa celebrated it by an old-fashioned bake in the
oven, such as she and Sarah were wont to enjoy in
cherry-time; and matter-of-fact as her day's work
appeared, Sarah was recalled every moment&mdash;her
looks, her ways, her speeches&mdash;with an affectionate
fidelity which would have surprised her could she
have been cognizant of what she had no proof of
in her lifetime. Philippa acknowledged the day by
a visit to the hill&mdash;her first since summer opened&mdash;and
reflections on the vast difference between that
time and the present. Though last year's leaves
were replaced, last year's grass renewed, the
cedar boughs imprisoning the familiar sea-wind,
the oaks glittering with the familiar sunshine,
her heart was not moved with the association which
belonged there&mdash;</p>

<p>"The touch of a vanished hand,<br/>

And the sound of a voice that is still."</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the gray roof below the orchard,
beneath which all that made her life a hopeful and
a sorrowing one had transpired. The stork returning
from the palms of Egypt to the roof in his patriarchal
village, with the wise, bitter pain and delight
which all wanderers feel, could not hover over it
with more unreasoning fancies than her thoughts
hovered over that, which was now her most desired
shelter. It stood so near the summit of the hill, so
plainly in sight, that she thought the winter storms
must have destroyed some of the intervening trees;
but the truth was, she had not looked upon it
before with the same eyes. She examined the
trees&mdash;they were all there, in the full glory of
summer, a glory that saddened her; it was no
longer a place for her to linger in. As she
descended the path she remembered a poem which
she heard Parke read to Theresa once, and was
tormented by it, as one is pursued and tormented
by the fragment of some old melody which half
repeats itself in the brain. When she saw Jason
the words flashed into her mind:</p>

<p>"But the laden summer will give me<br/>

What it never gave before;<br/>

Or take from me what a thousand<br/>

Summers can give no more."</p>

<p>By degrees she withdrew from his room; but
it  was  still her habit, as he was in bed early, to
spend the first part of the evening with him,
which was enlivened by the exit and entrance of
Elsa, and an occasional call from Mrs. Rogers.</p>

<p>A stormy day came, the evening of which was
undisturbed. Jason and Philippa were alone, and
had not spoken for an hour; he had asked her to
open the window, and was lying with his face
towards it, listening to the boom of the sea, which
mingled with the moaning wind.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said at last, "that you have
never loved the sea."</p>

<p>"Why, Jason?"</p>

<p>"That I might have had the shadow of an excuse
for fancying that we were kin."</p>

<p>"Do you feel the need of an excuse?" she asked
complacently.</p>

<p>"Yes, I  would forgive myself for my infatuation,
which blood-letting has cured me of."</p>

<p>"Infatuation!"</p>

<p>"What name will you give it, then? How could
I have made a greater fool of myself, than when,
like a mad Quixote, I rode a tilt at the armor you
buckled on years ago&mdash;believing that I could hack
it off?"</p>

<p>She could not gainsay the good sense of his discourse,
but received it in the faith that he would
return to his folly.</p>

<p>"You have something to pardon," he continued,
his voice taking the tone of an order. "I beg your
forgiveness&mdash;not for the feeling which prompted
my assaults upon you, but for the assault; give it,
and let us be at peace."</p>

<p>She left her seat, and went to the bedside, and
kneeled down by him.</p>

<p>"Jason, you may kiss me."</p>

<p>He shook his head, with a smile.</p>

<p>"We are not mates, Philippa."</p>

<p>"I know that; but I have found a flaw in that
armor."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>She rose from her knees, and stood looking at
him with eyes that flashed a tumult of shame,
anger, and deprecation; but behind all this there
shone a new light which smote his senses, and made
him thrill from head to foot, in spite of all his
resolutions.</p>

<p>"It is only me, Jason Auster&mdash;mutilated," he
exclaimed, motioning her away, unable to bear her
eyes any longer. He pulled beside him the little
table at the head of the bed, with a shaded lamp
upon it, for a barricade between them. She
retreated just beyond the circle of lamp-light,
which revealed his face completely: it was luminous&mdash;full
of shifting expression. She sought
among its changes a resemblance to Parke; it was
a satisfaction to find nothing that reminded her of
his winning, delicious beauty in the haggard,
bearded man before her&mdash;of whom she was beginning
to feel a wholesome dread.</p>

<p>"I have but little more to say," he added presently,
with rather a husky voice. "I have made
up my mind to leave you&mdash;simply, because I have
no reason for staying. Your business affairs are
so ticketed, that you can manage them, and Parke's
also. By the way, did you never think what an
advantage your money would have been to me?"</p>

<p>She started up, crying:</p>

<p>"You will go a poor man!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I shall go to the West, where I expect
to acquire fortune and fame as the 'One-handed
Backwoodsman,' or 'The Lone Bee-Hunter.' A
poor man! Have I been a rich one ever? Ungenerous
girl, think a moment of the nonentity,
me&mdash;who, for twenty years, have managed the
Parke property&mdash;which, like a beast, has walked
and waved its horns before all the family, including
yourself&mdash;and held you in thrall."</p>

<p>He was reading her to herself! She made a
movement towards him, and, with a gasp, said,
"It should be cursed!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Philippa; you live in Crest, and the
family graveyard is here."</p>

<p>His manner was too painful; she could not bear
it, and laid her hand on the door-latch.</p>

<p>"You won't ask me to stay, then?" he said
loudly.</p>

<p>"I will tell you no lies. If you leave me, you
will take with you every hope that remains in my
heart. But I do not ask you to stay; neither will
I offer you money."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"I will go now&mdash;if you have finished."</p>

<p>"The token of forgiveness, you offered just
now," he said, in a faint voice, "I accept it."</p>

<p>"I said that you might kiss me. Shall I come
back, that you may do so?"</p>

<p>"No; go&mdash;for I do not believe in your hopes.
And I will not comfort your methodical soul, by
trussing up the interview with proper feeling and
fine words."</p>

<p>She closed the chamber-door.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

</div>

<p>CONSIDERATION for Philippa induced Jason
to write a note to Mr. Ritchings to inform
him that he was going on a tour to the West
for his health. He also told Mrs. Rogers, who
significantly remarked that his plan was a very
good one. In a day or two he was gone, without
sounding a note of preparation, with no leave-taking,
no instructions&mdash;unless giving Philippa his
office-key might be considered in the light of an
instruction. He had no destination, but stopped
by chance, as he had done more than twenty years
before, at a town hundreds of miles from Crest,
whose name he had never heard&mdash;new enough to
have a perspective of aboriginal forest, from which
the panther and the wild-cat, the inhabitants said,
had scarcely retreated. Here he sought repose,
but did not find it.  He must go farther, he concluded,
and resumed his journey. His health and
strength came back, but he was restless and miserable;
the roots of his existence tugged him backwards,
and he retraced his steps slowly, contesting
every inch of the way with resolutions, to be put
in practice at the stopping-place before him!
Within fifty miles of Crest he had reached the spot
favorable for reflection concerning the future,
giving his resolutions, for the present, the go-by;
but his reflections did not get beyond the starting-point,
which was, "If I go back to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bought a fishing-rod, and went up to the
trout streams among the hills, where he passed
many hours a day in not catching fish. In the
evenings he practiced writing with his left hand,
and chose for copy letters to Philippa, which he
tore up as soon as he saw "Jason Auster" written
at the end.</p>

<p>At the time of his departure Philippa made
resolutions also, which were better kept; she determined
to live as if all she was ever to possess
could be contained in the limits of each day. Too
much time had been wasted in expectation and
preparation for events which had never taken place,
and now never would. Her years had glided away
in getting ready for happiness; happiness must be
left out in her plan. She thought of all the old
maids she had known with property&mdash;there were
several scattered over the area of Crest&mdash;and she
remembered them as cheerful, hard-headed women,
with few amusements and a good deal of business.
Then she thought of the widows of her acquaintance&mdash;Elsa
was one, and she would apply to her
for information.</p>

<p>"What is the nature of your feelings from day to
day?" she asked her.</p>

<p>"Lord a mercy, Philippa, which way is the cat
jumping now?"</p>

<p>"I mean, have you any happiness without a particular
object to live for?"</p>

<p>"Object?&mdash;You mean Bowen. He was an
object. As for happiness, I haven't thought about
it; but I will, and let you know my conclusion
immediately."</p>

<p>"No matter, don't think; I know the conclusion
you will come to."</p>

<p>Elsa screamed with laughter, and told her she
was just cutting her eye-teeth; eye-teeth meant
that all was vanity of vanities.</p>

<p>Strong-minded as Philippa thought she must be,
she felt a great reluctance to approach anything
like business; but the time came when she was
obliged to turn the key of Jason's office. It seemed
to her, as she looked over his books and papers,
as if he had for a long time expected to be called
suddenly away. Instead of pursuing her new calling,
she cried, and went home with a headache.</p>

<p>About this time Jason wrote a letter, which he
posted. It contained a few words, so strangely
and tremulously written, that Philippa's heart felt
a pang at the sight of them.</p>

<p>"I am coming back," he wrote, "to ask your
forgiveness a second time."</p>

<p>"I have received a letter from Jason," she said
to Elsa; "he will be home soon."</p>

<p>"What did he go away for! Just for the sake
of turning round and coming back? Where is the
letter from?"</p>

<p>Philippa, ashamed to tell the post-mark, held the
envelope before her; when she spelt the name of
the town so near them, she looked at Philippa and
said, "I always knew that Jason Auster was a fool."</p>

<p>But Philippa saw that she was glad.</p>

<p>"Mind you," she continued, discovering that her
joy was detected, "I approve of his coming back,
because it is respectable to have a man about who
goes by the name of the 'head of the family';
Jason never had any thing more than the title&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Being a fool," interrupted Philippa.</p>

<p>"And I think it is a pity." she went on, "that
somebody shouldn't take care of you&mdash;you poor,
lone girl, that never was befriended in your life."</p>

<p>Tears, rare visitors, dimmed her glasses, but
Philippa could not share them; she patted her,
walked round  the  table on tiptoe, and finally put
her fingers in the dough Elsa  was preparing, and
rubbed it in her wrinkles, to smooth her old face.</p>

<p>A sentiment not to be accounted for led Philippa
at dusk to the unfrequented parlor. The air there
was tranquil and lifeless, as it is in uninhabited
rooms. She paced the soft carpet; the dry odor
of its undisturbed dust floated in the air, and
strangely reminded her of flowers.</p>

<p>"If Theresa Bond were in my place," she
thought, "she would have filled the vases here with
flowers; 'the rose of expectancy' would be visible
everywhere."</p>

<p>She took up the vases on the mantel-shelf and
looked into them. One had dried leaves in it;
she shook them out on the carpet, thinking they
were green when Parke was there; he might have
gathered them, for he had a way of bringing
flowers into the house, and placing them in vases,
books, on the floor, on the piano. The piano&mdash;when
had that been opened? She raised the
cover, and struck the keys  with  fingers that brought
out a wandering, wailing discord.</p>

<p>A heavy hand was laid on her shoulder, which
brought it to an end.</p>

<p>"Jason," she said gently, without turning round.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have just arrived. Why are you in this
room? Did I hear the lament of the lost?"</p>

<p>He sighed and she turned quickly towards him.
His arm was still in a sling. Before he comprehended
what she was doing, she took the sling
from his neck, put it round her own, and slipped
his arm through it again.</p>

<p>"My burden," she said, "that I love."</p>

<p>He enclosed her with his other arm.</p>

<p>"Jason, my protection, that I love better."</p>

<p>"My wife," he answered.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Philippa's prospect was limited to the
Scotch firs in the yard and the curtains of
Indian chintz before the parlor windows, Parke's
extended over the savannas of Apure, where the
grasses, verdant through the year, were more
beautiful than the flower-beds of the terrace at
Crest. The earthly paradise, peopled with birds of
the most brilliant colors, and almost every variety
of animal, was at present invaded by a party on a
cattle-hunt, which party, including Parke and Osmond
Luce, was composed of military men, Llaneros,
and negroes. The expedition, starting from
Maracay weeks before, had traversed an extensive
tract of country, stopping at the various cattle-farms
on the devious route to the pampas, to hunt the
wild herds of the native proprietors, or the still
wilder herds with no proprietor at all.</p>

<p>Parke, dressed in a check flannel shirt, breeches
buttoned tightly at the knee, and with a checkered
handkerchief bound round his head, was no less at
ease and looked far handsomer than any Llanero
the pampas could boast of. Seated on a stool of
stretched hide, in a hut thatched with palm-leaves,
and plastered with mud and straw, he impressed
those around him with the air of having been to the
"manor born."</p>

<p>"Our foreign friend," observed a young man,
"seems to carry us all in his eye."</p>

<p>"He plays the Llanero well, though," replied
another.</p>

<p>"He is not the desperate player our comrade
Osmond Luce is."</p>

<p>"At card-breaking, you mean."</p>

<p>"Hist, he is looking at you; you know he brought
some capital pistols from the States."</p>

<p>"How much past daybreak is it?" inquired
Parke. "I want to get a jaguar-skin before night."</p>

<p>"Time enough for that," replied young Castejon.
"But I say, sir, I have taken a fancy to that
cream-colored horse of yours. Will you part with
him?"</p>

<p>"You shall have him," Parke replied, "if you
will break for me the black stallion we saw in the
corral last night."</p>

<p>"Excuse me."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" cried Osmond. "Break him yourself,
Parke. As for the cream-colored, we'll stake
him."</p>

<p>"Play," said Parke. "Oh yes&mdash;for '<i>el ultimo
mono siempre se ahoga</i>.'"</p>

<p>"What! are you apt at our proverbs already?"
asked Castejon. "Let us go and look at the
stallion."</p>

<p>"No," said Parke, lazily. "Will you go, and
bring me a lock of his mane?"</p>

<p>"Something is going on now in the <i>majada</i>,"
cried one.</p>

<p>All rushed out except Parke and Osmond. The
latter lighted a cigar, and Parke took his knife
from his belt and examined its edge. Keeping his
eye on it, he said:</p>

<p>"The bats dropped into my hammock so last
night that I could not sleep, and with the first light
I sauntered out. I swear to you that the atmosphere
was so transparent that it seemed to bring within
my vision the terrace and the windows of our old
house. The casement didn't grow a 'glimmering
square,' but the panes glittered in the morning
light, as I have sometimes seen them glitter at
sunset."</p>

<p>"You've got the mirage&mdash;home-sickness."</p>

<p>"No I am not home-sick. But why do I ask
myself questions concerning Philippa lately?"</p>

<p>"No thought of her belongs in these scenes.
Suppose we go and shoot crocodiles this forenoon.
We might dissect one on account of its tears."</p>

<p>"Her spirit comes," continued Parke, "when I
do not call for it."</p>

<p>"And never comes when <i>I</i> do," said Osmond,
tearing a cigar to pieces.</p>

<p>"Poor Philippa!" mused Parke.</p>

<p>"You continue to believe in your star&mdash;don't
you?" Osmond asked, irritably.</p>

<p>"Certainly, in the star of my will."</p>

<p>"And that has brought you to the pampas."

<p>"And it may take me back."</p>

<p>Osmond laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a herd that when you do go back,
you will find Philippa married."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"Jason Auster."</p>

<p>"Never! It is impossible."</p>
