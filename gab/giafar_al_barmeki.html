<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Their feet had trod the burning sand
Of lone Arabia's desert land,
Obedient to the will divine
To kneel at Mecca's holy shrine;
And kingly lips have prese'd the sod,
Where knelt the prophet of their God."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that vast plain, which is enclosed and
watered by those celebrated rivers of antiquity,
the Euphrates and the Tigris, hence called by the
ancients Mesopotamia, and since, for the same
reason, named by the Arabians <span class="smcap">Al Gezira</span>, or
<i>The Island</i>, is a desolate, and to the eye an almost
boundless desert. Few roam over its bosom, save
the hardy Arab, to whom habit has rendered its
terrors harmless; the plodding merchant, with his
well-laden camels, bartering safety and quiet for
sweet gain; or perchance the solitary pilgrim,
seeking or returning from the holy city, and with
a devotion worthy a purer faith, sustaining with

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

patience, or confronting with fearlessness, the privations 
and dangers of that perilous journey.</p>

<p>In the year of the Hegira one hundred and
eighty-five, a band of travellers, far different in
outward garb and numbers from either just mentioned, 
might have been seen crossing westwardly
this plain, a few hours' journey below Bagdad.
Their way was toilsome and weary. It lay over
a waste of glazed and shining sand, that reflected
with redoubled power the meridian rays which a
summer's sun was pouring down upon their path.
Light winds breathed occasionally from the west,
cooling the sultry air of the desert. Yet grateful
as was their refreshing influence, they often became
the sources of serious annoyance; for when increased 
beyond even a moderate degree of violence, 
they raised the dust in clouds, covering the
shrinking forms of the travellers with a shower of
its heated and penetrating particles. Indeed, the
bosom of a summer's lake is not more easily ruffled 
by the breeze, than is the surface of that unstable 
soil agitated and blown abroad by the currents 
of wind which stream across it.</p>

<p>On all sides was extended an even plain of sand,
its monotony varied only by an occasional group
of palm trees, some mound of ancient ruins, or
heaps of loose soil blown into waves, where "the
north wind and the south had weaved the twisted
sand." Far behind might be seen the majestic
Euphrates, winding its slow and serpentine way
across the plain. Before them, marking the course

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

of the river Tigris, stretched a strip of date trees,
with which were intermingled the bay and juniper,
while here and there were scattered the beautiful
andrachne, enlivening, with its bright red bark and
gay flowers, the dark foliage with which it was
surrounded.</p>

<p>Shining through the trees was seen the Arrow,*
as it is poetically called, hurrying along its swift
current, remarkable for the light colour of its
waters. Beyond the river, commenced again the
vast desert, bounded to the north and west by the
snow-clad mountains of Khourdistan.</p>

<p class="small">[*The Tigris, so called from the Persian teir (arrow).]</p>

<p>Two rode foremost of the train, who from their
dress and bearing seemed its leaders. They were
mounted upon choice Arabian horses, which,
though somewhat deficient in size, possessed in a
remarkable degree that fleetness and endurance
so necessary in an animal to whose powers man's
life is oft intrusted, over those wild and dangerous
wastes.</p>

<p>After these, seated upon camels, rode a small
but venerable band. Their faces, which seemed
in gravity and sagacity to rival those of the patient
animals which they bestrode, their flowing white
beards, reaching below their girdles, and their
robes of blue, proclaimed them dervises.</p>

<p>Next followed fourscore horsemen, splendidly
arrayed. The bright mail which they wore was
in part shielded from the sun's rays by robes of

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

crimson silk, that were fastened about their waists
with rich girdles of the same material. Suspended
at their saddle bows might be seen their shining
bonnets of steel, whose places were for the time
supplied by red silken turbans, whence the name
which in after times they acquired of Kezel Bash
(red heads). Loose trousers, of a light yellow or
buff colour, tied closely about the ankle, and richly
embroidered sandals, completed their apparel.</p>

<p>Their weapons were a long lance, borne or
poised in the right hand, a crooked scimitar suspended 
from the girdle, and a longer but straight
sword which lay across the saddle under the right
thigh. In addition to these, each wore at his girdle
in front a short poniard, the hilt of which was
richly set with jewels, a weapon more for ornament
than utility, although occasionally it might be serviceable 
in close encounter, or redeem the life of a
prostrate warrior.</p>

<p>Their horses were of the Turcoman breed.
Scarcely inferior in speed and hardiness to those
above described, they moved with that proud step
and loftiness of carriage, which in the war horse is
a quality so desirable and imposing. They possessed 
also size and strength, sufficient to support
with ease, and display to advantage, the sumptuous 
and even cumbrous furniture which they
were accustomed to bear. The reins by which
they were guided were embroidered with silk, and
enriched with jewels of different kinds and value,
such as pearls, rubies, turquoises, or emeralds, as

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

the fancy of the rider prompted, or his means permitted 
him. Attached to the saddle bow of each
warrior were a hammer and nail, both of gold,<sup><a id="r001" href="#n001">1</a></sup>
with which, upon dismounting, they fastened the
bridle of their steeds to the ground; for in the
deserts which they often traversed, no tree or
shrub was to be found which might answer a purpose 
so necessary.</p>

<p>Their large saddles, though imposing in appearance, 
seemed inconvenient for close array, and
unwieldy for nice and rapid evolution, objections
which were equally applicable to their immensely
broad stirrups.</p>

<p>They were matched in height and nearly so in
years. The sun, in its course from China's wall
to the great empire of Charlemagne, looks not
upon another such array of horsemen. They were
a portion of the body guard of Haroun al Raschid.
At their head that renowned monarch had decided
the fortune of many a hard-fought day; with their
powerful aid he had oft snatched victory from the
arms of defeat, and rendered his name terrible to
the foes of Islamism.</p>

<p>Next came a band of black eunuchs, dressed in
white, with shawls of India girded around their
waists, and bracelets and collars of gold, marks of
splendid slavery, richly contrasting with the pure
jet of their skins. Each held in his right hand a
naked scimitar, of the most polished and highly
tempered material, and the scabbards, which hung

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

empty at their sides, were of pure gold, highly enchased, 
and wrought by the most skilful artisans.
In addition to these, sheathless poniards slept at
their girdles.</p>

<p>After these followed by far the fairest and most
interesting portion of the train. They were concealed 
in palanquins, a species of litter, suspended
between two camels, and shaded by a canopy of
fine brocade, which was borne along by the arms
of eight brawny slaves. These served alike to
shield the fair creatures they enclosed from the
scorching influence of the sun, and to defend them
from the rude glances of man, both equally dreaded
by those who have the care of beauty in those
burning and jealous climes. There was nothing
in the external appearance of these moving prisons,
for such indeed they appeared, to strike the beholder 
with interest, though they seemed framed
with every regard to the comfort of their lovely
occupants. Yet, in truth, one glance behind the
drapery of those curtained walls were worth the
whole array of splendour that has been described.</p>

<p>Camels laden with provisions, and all the accoutrements 
necessary for a long and painful journey,
slaves with led horses, straggling pilgrims who
had joined the train for safety, thronged in succession 
upon the road, while a band of well-appointed
horsemen brought up the rear.</p>

<p>There is something strange and incongruous
about this party, this mingling of women, priests,
and warriors. What do they here, travelling the

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

sultry desert? Pilgrims they are, returning from
the sacred city of Mecca. They have paid their
adorations at the shrine of the Kaaba.<sup><a id="r002" href="#n002">2</a></sup> They
have drunk of the holy well Zemzem, whose waters
a watchful angel disclosed to the weeping Hagar,
when the father of their race lay a thirsting infant
in the wilderness. Purified from sin, they are returning 
to their homes, filled with high thoughts of
the goodness of Allah and the sacred duties of religion, 
but soon again to enter upon the busy world,
that theatre of sin, that scene of crime and sorrow.</p>

<p>The elder of the two warriors who headed the
train was about forty years of age. His appearance 
was noble and majestic. His broad expanded
forehead seemed the seat of strong intellectual
powers; and piercing black eyes, which shot their
sharp flashes from underneath pent, overhanging
brows, indicated correctly the vigour and vivacity
of their owner's character. About the corners of
his eyes were many wrinkling lines, marks which
indulged merriment had left imprinted there; and
when he laughed, which he often did in mirth, but
oftener in scorn, from amid the mask of a coal-black 
beard were disclosed teeth of a pearly whiteness, 
which added not a little to the comeliness of
his appearance.</p>

<p>There were but few marks about the dress of
this individual which denoted his rank, nor was
the presence of these necessary to assure the spectator 
of his high station and character. Royalty
had stamped its impress upon his commanding features; 

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

his port and mien proclaimed him at once
a monarch. The same also did a cluster of priceless 
jewels which sparkled in his turban. These
told what, but not who he was. There were,
however, some tokens about his person, which declared 
the individuality, as well as the rank of
their wearer. One, and the principal of these, was
a plain scimitar, of large size and singular shape,
which hung at his side. It was the far-famed
Samsamah,<sup><a id="r003" href="#n003">3</a></sup> a weapon of fabulous renown, as celebrated 
throughout the Eastern world as the good
sword Joyeuse in the West, for the prodigies it had
wrought in the hands of his rival and cotemporary
Charlemagne. Another of these was the casque
which was suspended at his saddle bow, upon
which were engraved the words <span class="smcap">haggion azzon</span>
(<i>Strong is the pilgrim's arm</i>). The bearer of that
helmet and sword was Haroun al Raschid.
Friends knew them well, and in the darkness of
battle foes had often read the motto upon that crest
by the light of that flashing blade. In addition to
these, and with equal clearness, the discipline and
gallant equipment of his followers disclosed the
title of their leader. They wore, as it were, the
livery of that just, that generous, that heroic calif.</p>

<p>His companion was many years younger. He
was well formed, and possessed a fine and impressive 
countenance. Richly dressed, strikingly dignified, 
perhaps haughty in all his actions, he seemed
born to command; yet in his deportment towards
the calif he almost practised the servility of a slave.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

<p>"It is indeed so, Giafar," said the Commander
of the Faithful to his companion. "The toils of a
journey such as we have accomplished, were well
repaid by that self-approbation, that confidence in
the Divine favour, which are inspired by the performance 
of a duty so sacred, did these feelings
endure. But how fleeting are they! How soon
will sin and passion weigh down and deaden these
bosoms, which are now so light, so fresh, so free
from sorrow!"</p>

<p>"Life," replied the vizier (for such was his
rank), "in its ordinary round of business and enjoyment, 
brings to us trials too strong for our
resistance; and when to these are superadded the
temptations of rank, its pleasures and its cares,
what wonder is there if at times its possessor fails
in some part of those high duties which he owes to
Heaven?"</p>

<p>"Better to part, then, with crown and kingdom,"
said the calif, "if to do thus would give a title
worth more than that of king. Honour and power
are 'light as an insect's wing,' and he that seeks
and values them is lighter still than they. When
I put off these garments, and clothed myself with
the sacred veil, I felt as though I had left with
them all sin and care. I fear, lest with the ornaments 
of my rank I may have taken up pride and
ambition, or cruelty with my steel sword."</p>

<p>"Shadow of God upon earth," replied the vizier,
moved by the earnestness with which the calif
had addressed him, "these are not the days of the

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

prophets. Holy men there are dwelling here
below, who have in some part attained that purity
to which we are commanded to aspire. But who
is perfect, who is free from frailty and passion?
The duties of thy sacred office are arduous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too much so for mortal," interrupted the
calif.</p>

<p>"Our blessed Prophet," continued the vizier,
"(upon whom be salvation and the peace of God),
alone has perfectly sustained them. Why, then,
should thy soul reproach thee, if thou bendest
under a burden which no mortal save him could
support? If thou failest in aught, there are prayers, 
alms, fasting, and, above all, the sacred pilgrimage, 
to atone for thine errors, and purify thee
before the Most High."</p>

<p>"True, true; thy words are balm to me, Giafar,"
exclaimed the monarch. "And to scatter the foes
of our holy religion, to extend its proffers to those
wretches who are destitute of its blessings, merits
not this somewhat?"</p>

<p>"Much, nay, more than all," replied the vizier;
"for says not the Koran, 'Do ye reckon the giving
of drink to pilgrims, and the visiting the holy temple, 
to be actions as meritorious as those performed
by him, who believeth in God, and in the last day,
and fighteth for the religion of the Most High?' "</p>

<p>"Thou hast rightly spoken," said the calif.
"And well pleased am I, if with this arm I can
accomplish aught to the benefit of our most holy
religion, or which may redound to the glory of its

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

blessed author. Five times have I worshipped
at Mecca (peace dwell within its walls!), and as
often have I routed mine enemies in the field.
Never have I returned from this sacred journey,
but Heaven has had work for me to do."</p>

<p>"It hath strangely chanced," exclaimed the
vizier.</p>

<p>"Out upon thy lack of faith!" replied the calif.
"The decrees of Allah are from eternity, and
concerning the smallest matter chance has no
power."</p>

<p>"The arm of the high priest of our religion is
strong, and the foes of Islamism may well tremble
at its might; but if thou hadst never clothed thyself 
with a pilgrim's garments, if thou hadst never
bowed before the shrine visited by true believers,
wouldst thou shun the enemy and the oppressor?
No; thou wouldst head thy brave warriors, and
with myself at thy side, charge the infidels as thou
art wont."</p>

<p>"I should! I should!" exclaimed the calif.
"By the beard of Abbas! my bosom is warming
at the thought." Then checking himself he added,
"Ever ready is the proud soul of man, to take
upon himself the merit of his good deeds. But it
becomes thee not, Giafar, to stand like a tempter
at my side, encouraging those feelings, which now
at least should be steadily repressed. There is no
strength in this arm, save as it comes from the
Most High. His blessing be upon us."</p>

<p>As he said this, the royal pilgrim dismounted

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

from his horse, and turning his face towards the
holy city, bowed himself with the deepest humility
to the earth, while he paid his adorations to the
Supreme. His companion followed his example,
and many of the train, pausing upon their way,
recited short verses from the Koran, or the profession 
of their faith, and from the lips of all were
heard breaking, "God is good! God is great!" and
other expressions of devotional feeling.</p>

<p>With such emotions had the band described, or
most of the individuals composing it, proceeded
upon their route from Mecca. As they approached
Bagdad, however, the thoughts of home, and its
expected pleasures, projected plans for business and
intrigue, were fast infringing upon those bosoms,
which had of late been tenanted and rendered
sacred by devotion. Instead of a continual sense
of duty, there were long and frequent intervals in
their fidelity to Heaven, from which they were
only aroused at the hour of prayer, or at the exhortation 
of some good imam. The torch seemed
to burn with an unsteady flame, its uncertain and
flickering light soon to be entirely extinguished
under a mass of joys, anxieties, and all the varied
passions that crowd upon the soul. Thus many
leave the temple of God, awed by the sanctity of
the place, or awakened by the impressive performance 
of the holy rites. Their hearts are, for the
moment, filled with awe and devotion, but as their
steps lead them farther and farther from the place

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

where these emotions have been engendered, with
diminished power do they linger in their bosoms,
until the cares, or yet sooner the joys of earth,
have banished afar all thoughts of heaven.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">This world of tents, and domes, and sun-bright armory!
Princely pavilions, screen'd by many a fold;
Steeds with their housings of rich silver spun,
Their chains and poitrels glittering in the sun;
And camels, tufted o'er with Yemen's shells,
Shaking in every breeze their light-toned bells.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lalla Rookh</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> route of the travellers had led them over
the ruins of ages. The path which they had traversed 
was strewn with the monuments of years
long past. Many a scene of desolation was crossed,
which spoke with emphasis of the instability of
fortune, and told the vanity of this world's greatness 
more forcibly to the pilgrims, than the most
impressive chapter of the Koran.</p>

<p>On the banks of the "great river," the river
Euphrates, they had trodden and wondered amid
the ruins of ancient Babylon, "the glory of kingdoms, 
the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency." In

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

the plain of Shinar, they had gazed upon the remains 
of Babel's ancient tower, that enduring
monument of human presumption; and if some
had a tear for the wickedness of mankind, many
too had a smile for their folly. For to them who
could view afar the mountains of Khourdistan,
lifting their proud summits into that heaven which
the vain builders had aspired to reach, it seemed
strange indeed that they should have reared their
place of refuge upon a plain so level and so low.
Occasionally their march was interrupted by an
aqueduct or trench, vestiges of Grecian or of
Roman industry, through which the waters of the
higher bed of the Euphrates mingled with those of
its rival stream, irrigating the parched and sandy
soil through which it found a passage. Hardly a
step was taken but the foot trod upon some new
wonder, furnishing theme for admiration, and food
for serious and sage discourse.</p>

<p>Turning northwardly, they now followed the
course of the Tigris, passing upon the right hand
the ruins of Seleucia, whose rise had in a great
measure contributed to the desolation of that immense 
city just spoken of. Upon the opposite
bank of the river, were the site and vestiges of the
Ctesiphon of the Parthians, which had in its turn
avenged the wrongs of Babylon upon the abode
of the Macedonian Seleucus, and on its ruins were
crumbling the ruins of Persian Modain. Yet amid
this scene of desolation, one proud edifice was
seen rearing itself above the scattered remnants of

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

antiquity. It was the palace of Khoshroes Nourshivan, 
standing untouched, uninjured by the withering 
hand of time, which even to this day, if travellers' 
tales be true, has respected its venerable
walls. "Time spares the works of the just man,"
says the proverb; "for see! the palace of Nourshivan 
still stands amid the ruins of Modain."</p>

<p>This lofty structure was visible upon the horizon's 
edge, looming like an immense pile through
the heated and refracting atmosphere of the desert.
A forest of gigantic trees seemed to surround it,
for so were magnified the stinted shrubs that
skirted the plain, a delusion not uncommon in eastern 
countries about midday.</p>

<p>The calif pointed out the scene to his vizier,
and sighing profoundly, said,</p>

<p>"There, Giafar, is a name worth living for; the
power of the mightiest, the glory of the most warlike, 
sink into nothing before that title, 'The Just.'
I would part with my whole kingdom to possess
it."</p>

<p>" 'Tis thine, my lord," replied the vizier. "Al
Raschid* need not envy the fame of mortal."</p>

<p class="small">[*The Just.]</p>

<p>"Thou flatterest me, Giafar," said the monarch.
"My subjects have indeed bestowed upon me that
title, but shall I leave behind me a memorial of my
works, lasting as those walls?"</p>

<p>"Doubt it not, my most noble master," said the
vizier. "Ages must pass away, ere the great, the
just Haroun shall be forgotten; ere he shall cease

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

to be an example for princes, or his name fade
from the memory of mankind."</p>

<p>"Could I believe as thou wouldst fain persuade
me," replied the monarch, "did I think that this
fair fame were indeed mine, willingly would I
resign my crown into other hands. I should fear
lest some unwary action, prompted by passion or
by pride, might in a moment tarnish my renown,
and blacken its fair surface. And yet," he added,
after a moment's hesitation, "it may not be. The
burden is fastened upon my shoulders, I must carry
it to the journey's end."</p>

<p>A short silence ensued, which was broken by
Haroun.</p>

<p>"The hours of this pilgrimage have passed
pleasantly away. Accompanied by thee, by my
wife Zobeide, and my daughter, whom I love as a
jewel of great price, they have equalled the most
delightful moments of the harem, nay, have surpassed 
them, for thou hast participated in their
enjoyment. It may be we have sinned in this, for
in the pilgrim pleasure should give place to feelings
of penitence and humility&mdash;Allah, pardon our
offences!&mdash;yet I grieve that they are so soon to
end. Dost thou not regret it, Giafar?"</p>

<p>"I can never forget them, my lord," said the
young prince, slightly colouring; "they will be to
me like a dream, which haunts the mind of the
sleeper long after the slumber has passed away,
that brought the sweet vision to his senses."</p>

<p>"All happiness seems a dream," said the calif.

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

"Our misfortunes alone appear to be realities. The
happiest hours are as though they were not, but
the passage of misfortune over the soul leaves imprinted 
there its traces, and we cannot doubt the
reality of those ills, over which we still grieve.
How I shall wish for thee, Giafar, after our return!
It is true, I shall see thee in the divan of council,
and at the chase; I shall find thee at my side in
the thick fight, or before me, it may chance&mdash;nay,
thou hast been often there; we may roam together
the streets of the city, watching over the morals
and manners of my people, but in my hours of retirement, 
I shall look for thee in vain. In the sacred 
retreat of the harem thou canst not enter. I
would it were otherwise."</p>

<p>Signs of joy were visible in the countenance of
the vizier, as he listened to these expressions of his
master's affection, and more than once he would
have pressed his lips to the hem of his robe, but
as often the hand of the calif restrained him.
"Away with these vain ceremonies!" he exclaimed,
"these forms with which my rank surrounds me&mdash;I 
am weary of them. Be a brother to me&mdash;yet
not so," he added as his mind reverted to the past.
"They are false and treacherous. A son, perhaps&mdash;but 
now leave me. I would be alone. See if
the princesses are well attended. The sun yet
shines burningly, and the covering of a travelling
pavilion is not like the spreading roof, and latticed
windows of their own home. This must be cared
for. They may need repose ere entering the city."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

<p>Joyfully did Prince Giafar turn to execute the
commands of his master. He hastened to the litter
which contained the beautiful Zobeide. A sign
from her mute attendant warned him that she slept,
and he passed on to that which bore the Princess
Abassa. Reining up his steed, he hesitated as
though fearful of disturbing the fair being therein
concealed, and then, in a voice which respect and
timidity rendered scarce audible, inquired if she
were not weary, and then proposed that the caravan 
should halt, while they took a few moments'
rest.</p>

<p>A slight agitation of the curtains was seen,
a rustling as of silken garments heard, and then a
voice of surpassing melody said, "Thanks to the
kind care of our protectors, we feel no weariness,
and need no repose. I think, indeed, we but ill
obey the precepts of our most holy Prophet. Little 
of toil or danger do we encounter, no self-denial
do we practise in our pilgrimage, but thou, Prince
Giafar, and my beloved father, ye merit indeed the
blessing of Allah. Daring danger, enduring fatigue,
ye win, as it were, from Heaven, forgiveness of
your sins."</p>

<p>"Think not, lady," said the prince, "that bodily
penance can atone for error. The venerable men
who precede us would tell you far otherwise. The
strong in frame might endure suffering, under which
the weak powers would sink, yet one act of true
devotion, a single tear of sorrow and repentance,
from a being like thee, would outweigh it all!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

<p>"Is self-privation nothing?" replied the princess.
"Merits not more he who in poverty, on foot, and
alone, dares the fatigues and dangers of this desert,
than one who, surrounded by comforts, and in all
ease crosses its perilous road?"</p>

<p>"Poverty and misfortune," said the prince,
"when supported with a humble spirit, chasten the
soul, and render it deserving of reward. 'Happy,'
says the Koran, 'are they who from the bosom of
poverty cry out, We are the children of God, we
shall return to him.' But pride and self-esteem are
as often covered by the rags of the beggar, as by
the robe of the prince. Vanity and desire for this
world's favour are often mingled with the performance 
of our holiest duties, taking from their worth,
and diminishing the merit which they otherwise
would find in the eyes of Heaven. How often does
the pilgrim put on the ihram* from motives ill
befitting the sacredness of his calling, that he may
obtain the respect of mankind, that the venerable
name of hadgi&dagger; may be his, when his soul should
be wrapped in devotion, and all his care, how he
best might worship Heaven, and deserve forgiveness 
for his sins."</p>

<p class="small">[*The mantle of the pilgrim.]<br/>

[&dagger;Pilgrim.]</p>

<p>"Will my lord permit me to inquire," said the
princess, "in what manner he has performed those
duties which have led him to the sacred city."</p>

<p>"Question me not, noble princess," answered
Giafar; "a lesson of virtue, it is easy to read, but
most difficult to practise. My obligations to religion 

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

have been fulfilled, as best I could, but there
are thoughts that cannot be banished, images which
perpetually haunt the imagination, and enter perforce 
into the soul, even when religion, Heaven,
and all things sacred are claiming its entire possession."</p>

<p>"Thy thoughts, then, have been away in Bagdad, 
with thy friends at home?"</p>

<p>"Not so, fairest princess," was the hesitating
reply. "With the steps of thy camels they have
crossed the desert by day, and at night have stood
sentinels before thy tent until the morning." The
voice of the young prince faltered as he spoke,
and a sigh, unheard by him, agitated the silken
covering which hid from his sight the loveliest
creature that the realm of Persia contained.</p>

<p>Silence ensued, and the train moved noiselessly
upon its course.</p>

<p>"Prince!"</p>

<p>"I am at thy side, fair lady."</p>

<p>"How far distant is Bagdad?"</p>

<p>"A few short hours' ride. Thou mayst soon
see its towers. The Tigris rolls its waters upon
our right, and the bright sun is shining upon a
scene which thou wouldst love to look upon."</p>

<p>A fair hand parted the curtain of the pavilion,
and Abassa, veiled, looked forth. At this moment,
having passed a bend in the river, the city appeared
full in view, with its gilded domes, its towers, and
minarets, flashing afar like a "grove of waving
scimitars."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

<p>"That, then, is Bagdad?" said Abassa.</p>

<p>"It is," was the reply. "You may distinguish
hence your father's palace, for it rears itself above
the loftiest domes of the city."</p>

<p>"I see a mass of towers and clustered walls,
but can discern nothing distinctly. Yet what are
those?" said the princess; and she pointed out to
Giafar, as she spoke, a range of low tents which
were extended beyond them, upon the border of
the river.</p>

<p>"I had overlooked them," replied the vizier.
"By Allah! they are warriors encamped. I can
discern the glittering of their armour, and, as I
live, the Roman eagle flutters over their tents. I
know that standard well. In the name of the
Prophet! what can this mean? I had thought as
soon to see heaven and earth meet, as that boastful
bird take its flight over these plains. Surely thy
father must have seen them, and yet we move
steadily along."</p>

<p>"Go to him," exclaimed the princess. "Be near
him, warn him of the danger."</p>

<p>"Danger!" replied the vizier, proudly, "there
is none. We have naught to fear from those
Christian dogs. They have felt, too often, the
edge of our scimitars, to dare their temper again.
Fear nothing. I will seek thy father, and instantly
return." He bowed to his horse's mane, and
turned to depart.</p>

<p>The princess gazed steadily upon the encampment 
which had caused such dismay in her own

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

mind, and such wonder on the part of her companion, 
and she heeded not that the light airs which,
at intervals, hovered over them, had blown aside
the veil which she wore, and that she was displaying 
beauties unparalleled to the gaze of the enraptured 
prince. She was leaning forward, peering 
into the distance. One white hand held back
the curtain of the tent, while, with the other, she
was shading her fine features from the rays of
the sun. Both, as became her rank, were covered
with jewels. The nails of her fingers were, at
their roots, tinged with henna, not after the present
unseemly fashion of the country, but so delicately,
as would scarcely offend the taste of those most
unused to the custom. Her dark brown hair,
notwithstanding the restraint of a richly worked
buckle, or species of tiara, fell in luxuriance upon
her shoulders, while in front it was simply parted,
and enveloped, in the form of a double crescent,
her finely formed forehead. Glittering upon her
brow, and half concealed by this arrangement of
her tresses, shone a superb diamond, which had
once sparkled in the hair of the Empress Irene.
Her eyes were of a deep hazel colour, and their
lids were fringed with long eyelashes, that imparted 
to them a soft and melting expression.
These were painted with a sort of black unguent
or collyrium, whose dark surface softened the
rays of light in their passage to the eye, to which
delicate organ they would else have been intolerable, 
reflected, as at times they were, from a sea

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

of shining sand. Her nose was slightly aquiline;
her mouth small and arched, like the bow of the
Grecian cupid; her chin was that of a sculptured
statue, perfectly formed, slightly projecting and
dimpled. She was agitated, trembling, and the
colour had left her cheeks; but the hand of beauty
had moulded her features, and, with curious cunning, 
had there combined all the pride of her
rank, with the softness of her sex.</p>

<p>More of her person than has been described
was not visible, nor even this but at intervals, as
the wind waved to and fro her veil of silk and
gold. Yet more was not necessary to entrance
the young prince. One action, and that involuntary, 
arrested the progress of his steed, which he
had already urged upon the road, and then, as
though touched by an enchanter's wand, he became 
motionless, and gazed upon her in silent
and breathless admiration. Save the beautiful object 
before him, everything disappeared from his
sight: his companions, the hostile encampment, the
world, all but her. His own, and the exertions of
his horse, in keeping the way seemed involuntary,
or at least unnoticed by him. He heeded not the
approach of a slave, who drew near with hurried
steps, and was aroused only by the voice of
Abassa exclaiming, "A messenger from my father.
He has seen them, then, at last."</p>

<p>Turning as she said this, her eyes encountered
those of the prince, which were fastened in rapture
upon her unveiled features. Blushes covered her

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

face as with a veil of crimson; an upbraiding,
"Nay! my lord," came from her lips, and she hastily 
drew back into the solitude of her tent.</p>

<p>"Pardon, fairest princess, thine erring slave.
His life is ready to atone for his error." No answer 
was returned, and by this time the slave was
at his side, and signified to him that the calif desired 
his presence. Giafar loosed his rein, and in
a moment was at his master's side.</p>

<p>"Well, Giafar," exclaimed the calif, "what
new wonder have we here?"</p>

<p>"In truth, my lord," replied the vizier, "it is a
riddle that I cannot read. They are Romans
doubtless, as one may know by their array; but it
passes my skill to say what should bring the knaves
hither."</p>

<p>"Have we not wandered from the road, Giafar,
and are we not approaching unwittingly some hostile 
city?"</p>

<p>"There flows the Tigris, yonder glitter the crescents 
upon the mosques of Bagdad, and there&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Tis enchantment! Ride on&mdash;ride on," said
the calif, gayly, "within a lance's length, and they
will vanish."</p>

<p>"Hold! my lord, one moment," exclaimed the
prince. "Were it not well, ere we advance, to
send a messenger, and demand their purpose?"</p>

<p>"Bear the message, then, thyself," interrupted
the monarch, with a scornful laugh. "Go&mdash;ask of
those infidels, if the lord of the land upon which

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

they have set their tents may enter in peace into
his own city?"</p>

<p>"We have in our charge, sire, treasures that
surpass those of the East."</p>

<p>"Can we not guard them? Whither has flown
thy pride, Giafar? Has the air of Arabia rusted
thy scimitar, or hast thou left thy courage as well
as sins at the holy temple?"</p>

<p>"Neither, my lord," said the prince. "My courage 
is undiminished, and my blade bright, as the
foe shall see, when thou commandest me to draw
it. But let us take some precautions for the safety
of the princesses, ere we seek the encounter. It
cannot be doubted but they far outnumber us."</p>

<p>"Were they ten to one," said the monarch, "I
would not pause upon my path. And would to
Heaven, that not only these treasures, but my crown
and life, depended upon an encounter with those
knaves!&mdash;their empire being equally at stake."</p>

<p>"As thou wilt, my lord," said the vizier. "It is
thine to command."</p>

<p>"Ride on, then, in the Prophet's name."</p>

<p>At this moment their attention was directed to
a cloud of dust far off upon the plain which stretched
itself between them and the city. It approached
rapidly. "Behold!" said the prince, "a messenger
from my father."</p>

<p>"It is thy brother Fadhel, as I think," said Haroun. 
"None but one of his far-famed Kochlani
could speed so fast."</p>

<p>In a few moments the individual in question was

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

in sight. He came dashing along upon an Arabian 
of uncommon beauty, until within a few feet
of the calif's person, when, with the skill of a
practised horseman, he arrested his steed in mid
career, and a fine-looking man in the prime of life
dismounted, and prostrated himself before the
Commander of the Faithful. "Welcome, most
mighty sovereign," he exclaimed. "Lord of the
East, welcome to thy slaves."</p>

<p>"Rise, Fadhel, rise," said the calif. "How
fares thy good father? How fares the city? Nay,
rise, keep us not from the path." Having kissed
the hem of his master's robe, he rose, embraced
his brother Giafar, then mounted and rode on.
"Thou entertainest new guests during our absence," 
said the monarch.</p>

<p>"They are ambassadors from Constantinople,
my lord."</p>

<p>"Ambassadors are they?" rejoined the calif,
in a tone of disappointment; "they had near met
with a rude reception. I should have liked to rouse
the dogs. But is this thy hospitality? Couldst
thou afford no better bestowal for the messengers
of a mighty sovereign than these rude tents?"</p>

<p>" 'Twas a precaution of my venerable father's,
to lodge them without the city," was the reply.
"Their numbers are greater than should come
upon an errand of peace, and some brawl with our
jealous citizens were sure to occur during thine
absence. If they are true soldiers, they will not
grumble at their rude quarters."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

<p>"Should they do this, then, let them ever come
with messages of peace. They are sent from the
Empress Irene, thou sayst?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis rumoured, sire, that the empress is dead,
and that they bring terms of peace from the new
emperor."</p>

<p>"Ha! to renew the treaty, most like; to purchase 
a continuance of our friendship by a continuance 
of the tribute. Report says this, does it
not?"</p>

<p>"Rumours come flying in upon us like the
winds, yet in truth, my lord, I have not heard of
this."</p>

<p>"Not heard of this!" replied the Commander of
the Faithful, impatiently. "Be not so careful of
thy news. Speak out; what hast thou heard of?"</p>

<p>"The most common rumour is (and yet it is but
rumour), that the purpose of this embassy is to
refuse the tribute on the part of the new emperor."</p>

<p>A frown darkened the calif's features for a
moment; then smiling sternly he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Say they so, then? and does the Christian dog
howl after this sort? He needs the lash, and, by
the beard of my father! he shall feel it." This
was said in a tone of bitterness, that told how near
the calif's heart lay the subject on which he
spoke, and with what pious fervour he hated and
despised the enemies of his faith.</p>

<p>They had by this time approached the tents of
the Roman embassy. Clusters of arms and heaps
of armour were piled around the encampment;

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

horses were standing picketed near, but not a warrior 
was visible. Overcome by the severe heat of
the climate, they were reposing within their tents,
sunk in a state of lassitude, from which the approach 
of the pilgrim band could hardly arouse
them. At last one, and then another, looked forth,
until numerous unarmed and half-armed knights
were gazing with ill-concealed wonder at the gallant 
array which passed them.</p>

<p>"Where are these warriors," exclaimed the
calif, "who would threaten us so boldly? Our
very sun seems to have subdued them. Ha! they
look out upon us at last. Giafar, see that the men
move cheerily and firmly on. Tell them that the
eyes of infidels are upon them."</p>

<p>The march was toilsome. The yielding sand
covered at each step the foot of man and beast.
The ardent sun shone with a hue of blood, and
though well past the meridian, poured down rays
that were withering in their power, tinging with
red the dull vapour of the desert, until the very
atmosphere glowed as if on fire. The air was
calm, yet occasionally gusts of wind came from
the southern waste like the breath of a heated furnace, 
bearing along particles of fine dust or heated
sand, which at times forced the hardiest warrior
to conceal his face beneath his robe, though oftener
he received them upon his averted back, shrinking
yet unbent. But at a word from the vizier all toil
was forgotten. Each rode more erect in his saddle
and grasped his lance more firmly, or poised it

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

with lighter hand; and the thought that foes were
gazing on them seemed to inspire their very steeds.
Fresh slaves bore the pavilions which shaded the
princesses and their attendants, so that even their
wearisome duty was performed with alacrity.</p>

<p>This gallant sight seemed to have roused the
strangers. Many were seen to don their armour,
and, as though rebuked of their indolence, a few
rode forth, to scan more minutely their array, and
for some time hovered upon the borders of their
march. Yet no glance was bestowed upon them,
unless the characteristic curiosity of their sex may
have urged some tenant of those curtained litters
to look stealthily forth upon the strangers. In all
that band of warriors, not a face was averted, not
a feature moved, not a hand was raised to wipe
away the moisture which might be seen dripping
plentifully from their brows. To the eyes of their
wondering observers, they seemed stern and panoramic 
statues, borne along by the aid of some
invisible machinery; to such perfection had their
discipline been brought, and with such devotion
were they wont to observe the commands of their
leader.</p>

<p>"The drones have roused themselves at last,"
said Haroun. "In truth a goodly swarm. What
reason, Fadhel, do they allege for coming in such
numbers upon a peaceful errand?"</p>

<p>"The fear of robbers, and wandering Tartars,
my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Out upon the dogs!" exclaimed the monarch.

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

"No robbers tread within the confines of my kingdom, 
save themselves. No, 'tis a pretext false and
flimsy. The emperor would intimidate me by the
splendour of his array, by the number and excellence 
of his troops. Ha! by my life, but they
shall quail before my throne. Giafar, see that no
splendour be wanting to the reception of these
Romans. Let the remembrance of their master's
court be driven from their minds, and sink into
insignificance when compared with mine."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, my lord," replied the prince;
"thine enemies shall tremble before thee. Confusion 
shall cover their faces in thy presence."</p>

<p>The calif now relapsed into silence, which was
uninterrupted, until, at about nightfall, they entered
the city.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bagdad</span>, the once favourite residence of the
Abassidian califs, stands in a vast plain upon the
banks of the Tigris. As described by ancient historians, 
it was built upon both sides of the river

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

and in form was perfectly circular. A double wall
enclosed it, the gates of each of which were disposed 
alternately with respect to those of the other,
whence it was sometimes called Zaura, or the oblique, 
an arrangement which added greatly to the
security of the city's defences; for an enemy that
by any chance had effected an entrance within the
outer wall, was obliged to traverse some distance
between the two, ere arriving at the inner gate,
which before the city could be entered must still
be forced, and that under circumstances very unfavourable 
to the accomplishment of such a purpose. 
In addition to this, lofty turrets overlooked
the town on all sides.</p>

<p>The banks of the Tigris were adorned by the
principal public buildings, and palaces of the most
important citizens, which were partially concealed
by the groves of palm and cypress trees, that grew
in profusion along its margin. Moored fast in the
river, rippling its current with their prows, were
ranged a line of boats, over which was thrown a
spacious bridge, that afforded free communication
between the opposite portions of the city. In
every quarter were seen objects worthy of note.
Large and commodious caravansaries accommodated 
the traveller; rich merchandise of every
description was displayed to view in its extensive
bazaars; noble aqueducts and magnificent baths
contributed to the convenience and luxury of its
inhabitants. Many an ample mosque supported
its lofty dome, upon whose height glittered the

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

symbol of the Moslem's faith; tall minarets reared
themselves in singular and fantastic beauty, and
towering proudly above all these, in the eastern
and more ancient part of the city, stood the imperial 
palace.</p>

<p>Founded by Abu Giafar al Mansor, the grandfather 
of the present monarch, it had, in the short
space of half a century, become a splendid and
flourishing metropolis, rivalling the great city of
Constantine itself.</p>

<p>The ruins of ancient Ctesiphon are supposed to
have contributed to the structure of Bagdad; and,
in truth, some ready storehouse of materials might
seem necessary to account for the rapidity of its
rise. But let a careful observer transport himself
back to this city, before modern discovery had
found a passage across the sea to either Indies, and
all wonder and doubt will vanish from his mind.
Its situation seemed adapted to render it one of
the principal marts of commerce, between the eastern 
and western worlds; and its rapid growth, its
condition flourishing beyond example, justified the
choice of its founder.</p>

<p>Gold and silver from the mountainous regions
of northern India; precious stones from Egypt and
Hindostan; pearls (an article of great commerce)
from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, as well
as silks, spices, and frankincense, all found their
way into this favoured city, and from her bosom
by means of the ports lying upon the Mediterranean, 
were dispersed throughout the remote west.

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

Adorned by the liberality of a magnificent dynasty,
its wealth and splendour were unrivalled, while
the vigour of its government for a long time kept
aloof that degeneracy, which might sooner have
been expected, from the luxury and vices of its inhabitants. 
It has, however, since suffered those
vicissitudes, which have been in so remarkable a
degree the lot of the cities of Asia. The ancient
capital of the califs is now no more. Its wealth
and gorgeous magnificence have passed away. It
has met the inevitable doom which stands recorded
in the book of fate against all earthly grandeur,
and Bagdad is now a small town upon the western
bank of the Tigris, under the dominion of the race
of Othman.</p>

<p>During the reign of Haroun al Raschid, Bagdad
was at the height of its splendour. An experienced
soldier, a determined foe to the enemies of Islamism,
ready alike to defend and extend his dominions,
the power of that monarch was respected if not
feared throughout the world. From the time when
he led his father's warriors to the gates of Constantinople, 
and imposed an annual tribute upon the
trembling Empress of the Greeks, till now, victory
seemed chained to his sword, and in the language
of Eastern hyperbole, the kingdoms of the East
lay concealed in his scabbard. Nor was the vigour 
of the calif's character felt less at home than
abroad. Under his government, industry was
protected, merit rewarded, vice and oppression
promptly requited, and often with a punishment

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

fearfully disproportionate to the offence. But
though his administration of justice was stern, and
even cruel, yet it was equal. No tie of blood or
friendship could arrest its course, and if his subjects
feared the severity, they, at least, praised the impartiality 
of its execution. His enemies he spared
not; he had himself been educated in a school of
adversity; he had early taught himself to oppose
the craft, and bear the cruelties of an ambitious
brother, and he was not less ready to inflict, than
he had been to endure, those evils which the vicissitudes 
of life impose upon the unfortunate.</p>

<p>In his private character, however, Haroun was
generous, susceptible of friendship, and, above all,
prone to pleasure and mirth. It was his delight to
roam about his capital in some impenetrable disguise, 
accompanied by his favourite Giafar; to enjoy 
the merriment of some strange adventure, many
of which are in Eastern tales recounted to us. Oftentimes 
he bandied jests with the careless idler,
and heard his own name or actions the subject of
innocent raillery, or drank of the wine cup with
the licentious and jovial, while the erring Mohammedan 
little thought that the gay companion at his
side was the chief imam of his religion. Sometimes 
the monarch left terrible traces of anger upon
his path; yet oftener charmed by wit, or seduced
by congenial merriment, he remembered the culprits 
only to favour or gently to reprove them.</p>

<p>Though war was the business of the monarch,
and though pleasure charmed at times the man,

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

religion still had claims upon the pontiff, and its
duties were not neglected. In the early days of
the califate, to read the prayer of the mosque,
to expound the Koran, and to lead the pilgrim to
Mecca, were the duties of the vicar of the Prophet,
as well as to combat at the head of the true believers 
in the field. These offices were performed
by Haroun, with a readiness equal to that with
which he discharged those more congenial to his
temper. When in imminent danger from the power
of his brother, he once offered up a vow, that if
Allah would protect his servant from the dangers
which surrounded him, on foot he would traverse
the road to the holy city. His prayer was heard.
The hand of God took his brother from the world,
and Haroun ascended the throne of his fathers.
Then turning a deaf ear to those courtiers who
with more prudence than piety counselled him
not to leave his newly acquired kingdom, he listened 
to the voice of the learned doctors of religion, 
divested himself of the ensigns of authority,
and having consigned them into the hands of his
trustiest servants, proceeded, clothed with the mantle 
of the hadgi, to the fulfilment of his holy vow.
Nor was his piety unrewarded. "Eight times,"
says the historian, "he performed the pilgrimage
to Mecca, and as often defeated his enemies in
pitched battles;" a coincidence which impressed
itself with such force upon the calif's mind, that
he was said to attribute his success in arms to his
numerous visits to the holy city. In a prince of

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

Haroun's abilities, it is probable that this was
rather the result of policy than superstition, since
his subjects would more willingly obey and more
readily follow that monarch, whom they supposed
to be under the immediate guidance of Heaven. It
cannot be denied, however, that he was deeply imbued 
with the superstition of the age, and disdained
not the assistance and direction of astrology,
dreams, and omens, even in the execution of his
most important enterprises.</p>

<p>During the present absence of the calif, the
care and duties of the government were left in the
hands of the venerable Iahia al Barmeki, a sage
who had exercised the office of vizier under his
father, and had been the guide of his own youth.
His four sons in no way degenerated from the
character of their father. With talents of a high
order, they were endowed with the virtues of liberality 
and clemency, and although they filled the
most desirable posts in the kingdom, envy itself
was silent at seeing power in hands so worthy.</p>

<p>Of this favourite family, Giafar, the second son,
was most dear to the calif. He had appointed
him vizier, when his father's age prevented him
from attending to the duties of that office, and upon
his fidelity he reposed for the greater part of his
reign. The young prince was well worthy the
favour of his master. He possessed in a remarkable 
degree the qualifications necessary for that
important post. Patient of labour, resolute in action, 
a remarkable coolness as well as decision

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

characterized his counsels and his deeds. Daily
intercourse with the Commander of the Faithful
had imparted a shade of sternness to his character
while a long experience of the duties of prime minister, 
and the knowledge that he was accountable
to a superior for his every action, had taught him
prudence, and had taken from him, in a great degree, 
that impetuosity which, if it be the dower, is
also often the bane of youth.</p>

<p>All that was rude in the composition of the
young prince had been softened by education.
He was versed in astrology, the study of the Koran, 
and all the learning of the East. The history
and customs of the western world were not unknown 
to him, while in wit and song he rivalled
the most celebrated poets of the age. It was not
then a matter of wonder, that so valuable a servant, 
and so accomplished a friend, should occupy
a high place in the calif's affection. Indeed such
was his master's attachment to his vizier, that he
rarely suffered himself to be deprived of his society, 
and on his present visit to Mecca with his
favourite wife Zobeide, and his daughter Abassa,
he had commanded the attendance of Giafar, having 
left the care of his kingdom in the hands of
his venerable father.</p>

<p>After the calif's departure, nothing occurred to
disturb the quiet and monotony of the city, until
the arrival of an embassy from Constantinople.
The private train of the ambassadors was superb
and imposing, and a thousand chosen warriors

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

accompanied them; an escort necessary, they alleged, 
to protect their persons during a long and
perilous journey.</p>

<p>The purpose of their mission was kept profoundly 
secret, for they refused to disclose it,
except to the Commander of the Faithful in person. 
Rumours of hostility and defiance were
abroad, and as the bearing of the new comers
seemed to corroborate such suspicions, the prudent
Iahia refused, during the absence of his master,
to grant them admission into the city. Having
consulted the sages of the court, he caused an
ample and commodious encampment to be prepared 
for their reception, a few miles below the
city. Provisions, choice and in abundance, were
here furnished by the officers of the royal household, 
and all communication was interdicted
between the strangers and the inhabitants of
Bagdad.</p>

<p>Five times a day does every pious Mussulman
turn his face towards Mecca; but oftener than
this the good Iahia ascends the terrace of his palace, 
and looks anxiously towards the holy city.
He is not forgetful of the sacred ceremonies of religion, 
yet his prayers are of no worth. Though
he carefully avoids the approach of any unclean
thing, and purifies his person with the most scrupulous 
exactitude, yet he is unmindful of that, the
neglect of which, according to the dictates of the
Prophet, must invalidate his worship, more than
any outward omission. His thoughts wander from

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

heaven, and, while the name of the Supreme is
upon his lips, the image of his sovereign fills his
soul. Of the same fault are guilty many citizens
in their devotions. Even the muezzin, as from
the high minaret he summons the faithful to
prayer, forgets his Keblah;<sup><a id="r004" href="#n004">4</a></sup> and, as he scans the
southern horizon, thinks only of the return of his
calif.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was to be expected, 
that the first approach of the pilgrims
should be discovered by the watchful citizens.
Accordingly, on the day when our tale commences,
word was brought to Iahia, that a body of men
was seen approaching from the southward. The
messenger found the old man already aware of
their coming, and watching their progress over
the plain.</p>

<p>"Look, Fadhel," said Iahia to his eldest son,
who was standing at his side, "look with care,
thine eyes are young, and must even now discern
them."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt, my father, it is the
calif. Those red turbans&mdash;do you not see
them?</p>

<p>"I see them not."</p>

<p>"The shining caparison of their steeds, the order 
and regularity of their march, these at least
you can observe."</p>

<p>"I do, Allah be praised!" exclaimed the old
man. "Mount thy horse, my son, and greet the
calif, ere he encounter those Christian dogs:

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

some evil may chance of their meeting." Fadhel
obeyed, and in a few moments was spurring from
the gates of the city.</p>

<p>The news spread rapidly throughout Bagdad.
The walls and housetops were quickly crowded
with citizens, desirous to catch the first glimpse of
their approaching monarch. Long do they wait,
for the march of that band is stately and slow, but
their patience is at last rewarded. The sun has
not left the horizon, ere they can discern the person 
of the calif. Loud are the acclamations of
the people, as the Commander of the Faithful enters
the city; fervent prayers are uttered for the prosperity 
and continuance of his reign; thanks are
offered up in the mosque, by Haroun, for his safe
return; warm greetings pass between returning
and long-left friends; and the busy delighted
assemblage soon separate to the quiet of their
homes.</p>

<p>Night has come, and with it repose, to many
weary, many troubled souls. Even the calif has divested 
himself of his cares, and forgets them in
slumber. Giafar alone could not find rest. He
had been busily employed in preparing for the reception 
of the Roman embassy, which was to take
place on the following day. Every officer of the
household had his charge. The soldiery were in
readiness, and his experience and attention had
omitted nothing which might contribute to the
splendour of to-morrow's pageant. This occupation 
had the effect of diverting, for a time, his

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

attention from himself; and it was not until he
retired to his palace that he had leisure to turn his
thoughts inward.</p>

<p>The features of the princess Abassa were deeply
imprinted in his soul. Accident had disclosed
their beauty to his view; but no chance, no lapse
of time, and no effort of resolution, could thenceforward 
erase their remembrance. He thought
of her high rank, her sacred lineage, of the pride
of her father, and his heart drooped within him.
His future life seemed a desert, parched and arid.
Yet when he recurred to the calif's friendship,
and called to mind words which had fallen from
his lips, then, as though rain from heaven had descended 
upon this waste, all was green, and hopes
and joys freshened upon its surface. Long did he
muse upon his hopes, his fears; upon the worth
and beauty of his mistress, until nature, wearied
at last, sought refuge in repose.</p>

<p>"God is merciful!" said the young prince with
a sigh, and he consigned himself to sleep.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Allah, most high! Allah, most high! there is no God but Allah, 
and Mohammed is the prophet of God. Come to prayer&mdash;come 
to prayer&mdash;come to the temple of salvation. There is no
God but Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of God. Come to
prayer&mdash;prayer is better than sleep&mdash;come to the temple of
salvation.&mdash;<i>The Ezzan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> silver voices of the muezzins have chanted
forth the ezzan, and every good Mussulman has
obeyed the summons. The sun has just risen upon
the city. All Bagdad is at prayer. The calif
himself, in the sacred character of chief imam,
conducts the holy rites, and devotion swells in the
bosoms of his subjects, as they listen to the voice
of their pilgrim monarch. The duties of religion
are soon performed, and the mosques are deserted. 
Crowds of citizens, as curiosity prompts,
bend their way to various portions of the city.
Many throng upon the southern wall to view the
approach of those foreign knights, who are seen
advancing in solemn array. Others are attracted
to the river's banks, where many a gilded barge is
stealing from the shore, with its crimson awnings
flaunting in the air; and noble galleys, with their
decorated crews, are seen parting the waters.

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

The Tigris is pavilioned with silk and gold&mdash;the 
thirsty sunbeams can scarcely drink of its
waters.</p>

<p>The current of the populace, however, set
towards the imperial palace. In the courtyard
was ranged a portion of the battle guard of the
calif, a chosen body of warriors, which, to the
number of one hundred and sixty thousand men,<sup><a id="r005" href="#n005">5</a></sup>
were arrayed throughout the city. They were
clad in coats of mail, covered with fine white
linen, and their turbans were of the same colour
and material. Across their shoulders were hung
broad battle axes of steel; each in his right hand
grasped a ponderous mace at arms, while in his
left he bore a golden purse, in which was contained 
his yearly stipend. The sinews of war
were all there&mdash;equipment, discipline, and pay&mdash;everything 
that could delight the eye of a warrior, 
and impress the spectator with a sense of the
power and magnificence of their chief.</p>

<p>Opposite to these, and finely contrasting with
them, were drawn up ten thousand red-turbaned
horsemen, such as have been before described.</p>

<p>Three gates of the left wing of the royal palace
are presently thrown open, and from each issue a
thousand white eunuchs, while, from the opposite
quarter of the building, throng forth the same
number black as night. Their weapons are naked
scimitars born in their right hands, and sheathless
poniards which glitter at their girdles. They
enter the hall of audience to place themselves

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

around the calif's throne&mdash;fit emblems of Eastern 
despotism. Seven hundred porters swept
the dust from the steps of marble, and waited at
the numerous doors which gave ingress to the
various recesses of the palace.</p>

<p>Around the vestibule and entrance to the audience 
chamber were piled stands of arms of every
description. There were the Tartar cap and
lance, the djerrid, or dart of the Arab, the bow of
the hardy Scythian, with quivers of arrows; and
conspicuous among all were the long spear of the
Greek, the cuirass and shield, trophies of many
wars. The audience chamber itself was hung
with rich tapestry, and covered with a thousand
carpets, and costly furniture was scattered around
in oriental profusion.</p>

<p>Here and there, from the huge throat of many
a sculptured lion, issued fountains of water into
marble basins, while mingled with them reclined
the living monarch of the forest, hardly to be distinguished 
from his chiselled representative, save
by his rolling eye, and the sluggish motion of his
nervous tail. At times, indeed, they stretched their
wide jaws, and displayed to view the white and
pointed tushes with which they were furnished,
yawning hideously, yet not in anger; evincing rather, 
as it might seem, their listlessness at being
the spectators of so tame, so idle a pageant. Upon
fourscore Persian carpets crouched as many richly
spotted tigers, leashed in silk, each with his keeper
startling the astonished spectator by their terrific
yet exquisite beauty.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

<p>Trees of rare workmanship bent beneath the
weight of their golden fruit, enclosed in which, as
in little censors, were burning cinnamon, ambergris, 
and aloe wood, which diffused through the
air their sweet perfume.</p>

<p>High amid this scene of splendour was reared a
throne of ebony, upon which sat Haroun al Raschid, 
clothed in a robe and vest of the deepest
black. It was the favourite hue of the Abassides.
A rich turban of the same gloomy colour surmounted 
his brow, from which nodded three glossy
heron plumes, secured by a circlet of invaluable
jewels. Upon his shoulders hung the Burd&eacute;, or
sacred mantle of Mohammed, and his right hand
grasped the staff which once supported the steps
of the apostle of God. Upon each side the throne
waved the sable standards of his race, the "Night"
and the "Shadow," and seemed to shed obscurity 
from their folds over the gorgeous spectacle
around.</p>

<p>The calif's three sons sat upon the topmost step
of the throne, while around it stood the lords of
state and officers of the royal household. Conspicuous 
among these were the venerable Iahia and
his sons; Mesrour and Ibrahim, chiefs of the black
and white eunuchs; Gabriel, the royal physician, a
man of rare endowments; and many others, whose
grave and noble presence gave dignity to the assemblage. 
Around the hall was ranged close latticework, 
through which houris, or gentle beings
as celestial as they, were gazing, their bosoms

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

heaving with an eager curiosity, which, it is true,
seemed somewhat allied to earth.</p>

<p>All was still and motionless throughout the court,
when in a few moments the ringing of steel chains,
and the tramp of armed feet, announced the approach 
of the Grecian knights. At the instruction
of an officer appointed for that purpose, they
stooped their foreheads to the threshold, in which
was enchased a portion of that black stone<sup><a id="r006" href="#n006">6</a></sup> which
for ages has been an object of the pilgrim's reverence 
at Mecca. Yet it was with reluctance that
they submitted to this unworthy ceremony. A
few, less complying, or more adroit than the rest,
spurned or avoided the degradation, and many, as
they bent, spat in abhorrence upon the threshold,
and muttered secret curses against the impostor of
Mecca. As the strangers entered the hall, they
seemed at first dazzled by the strange magnificence
that burst upon their sight: the Eastern pomp and
apparel, the fierce beasts that seemed ready to
make their spring, and the forms of men still
fiercer, that darkened around the apartment. Yet
it was for a moment only that they permitted their
attention to be diverted by these objects. Calling
to mind their sacred character, and the high errand
upon which they came, they shook off the feeling of
awe which for a moment chilled their bosoms, and
advanced with dignity to the foot of the throne.
They were, in truth, a gallant band. Their plated
armour fitted closely to their persons, and the
plumes in their helmets drooped gracefully upon

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

their steeled shoulders. No jewels nor rich robes
adorned their dress, but the iron garb which they
wore shone like the diamond, and sat as easily
upon their frames as though woven in the looms of
India. The calif gazed upon them for a moment
in silence, then waving his hand, signified that he
was in readiness to receive their message.</p>

<p>The chief ambassador, a man with white hair,
and of dignified appearance, bowing lowly, proffered 
then a sealed epistle, which the vizier took
from his hands and presented to his master.</p>

<p>"Read it thyself, Giafar," said the calif; "read
it aloud, so that all present may hear."</p>

<p>The prince undid the seal, glanced his eye hastily 
over the writing, and replied,</p>

<p>" 'Tis for thine ear alone, most noble sovereign."</p>

<p>"Read on," was the stern reply; and the vizier
read as follows:&mdash;<sup><a id="r007" href="#n007">7</a></sup></p>

<p>"Nicephorus, emperor of the Romans, to Haroun, 
king of the Arabians, sends greeting. Let
not the peace of two mighty nations be disturbed
by thine ambition. The late empress, whom God
has taken to himself, considered thee a rook and
herself a pawn. That weak woman submitted,
indeed, to pay thee a price for thy friendship; but
know that a king has come upon the throne, who
will not render a tribute unworthy the majesty of
the empire. Be content to live in amity with thine
equals, restore the fruits of thine avarice and insatiable 
rapacity, or receive from the hands of my
ambassadors the only tribute a soldier can pay
thee."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

<p>"Ha! the hound!" exclaimed the calif. And
then, "What is the tribute that he sends?" came
sharply from between his set teeth.</p>

<p>At this demand, one of the knights strode boldly
forward, and having disengaged a bundle of swords
from the folds of silk in which it was enwrapped,
cast it down at the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>The flash of the midnight lightning is not more
sudden and startling than was the change produced
upon the haughty calif by this bold procedure.
The blood deserted his face, leaving it pale as
ashes, and his frame trembled with anger, which
he was evidently, yet unsuccessfully, striving to
master. He strained his scimitar tightly in his
grasp, while his eyes glared rapidly from one
object to another, like those of some wild beast
that is about to spring upon his prey, but is as yet
uncertain as to the individual object of attack.</p>

<p>When his emotion permitted him to speak, he
exclaimed in tones in which passion predominated,</p>

<p>"Now, by my father's beard! but this is overbold. 
Have you thought upon the value of your
lives, that you have come upon so insolent an
errand?"</p>

<p>"We have, my lord," replied the aged ambassador.</p>

<p>"Answer me not," interrupted the calif. "Yet
speak. I will listen. What warrant have you
for their safety?"</p>

<p>"The honour of a king," was the firm reply.
"And it will suffer a foul blot, great prince, should

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

but a single hair of our heads be injured at thy
bidding."</p>

<p>"You have counted too far upon my forbearance," 
exclaimed the monarch, angrily. "Here,
in mine own court," he muttered to himself, "thus
to be bearded! Blood, blood alone can wash out
this insult."</p>

<p>"It must flow freely, and from thine own subjects, 
ere we are butchered even here," exclaimed
a veteran knight, looking around at the naked scimitars 
which were bristling throughout the hall. "Yet
if there be bravery or courtesy among Persian nobles, 
let them grant us a clear field and we will
bide the encounter. For myself," he added, tauntingly, 
"I will be content to leave my body in the
sands, if my good sword cannot redeem it from
the bravest two that will dare to face me."</p>

<p>An expression of satisfaction predominated over
anger in the calif's countenance, as he saw his
nobles press forward to accept the bold challenge
of the Greek, and still more when he perceived his
favourite son Amin among the number.</p>

<p>"It is well, friends," he exclaimed; "yet fall
back. My brave son, many thanks; but it may
not be. Thou shalt hunt the foxes in their den;
but here it may not be. Fall back, Amin; fall
back, every one!"</p>

<p>All obeyed this reiterated command except
Giafar, who still kept his place near his master's
side. He had watched with anxiety the effect
produced upon the haughty soul of the calif by the

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

reading of the Roman emperor's insulting message,
and he trembled for the result. Determined even
at the risk of losing his master's favour, to deter
him from any outrage upon the sacred persons of
the ambassadors, he had advanced, and was about
to prostrate himself at his feet, when the occurrence 
just related interrupted the course of Haroun's 
anger, and enabled him to control his indignation.</p>

<p>The challenge of the Greek was not heard by
the vizier, or if heard was not heeded. His eyes
were fixed upon his master, watching in his features 
those changes that varying passion produced
upon his angry countenance. He saw that his
brow was yet unbent, that his hand still grasped
his scimitar, that he was about to descend from his
throne, and he hesitated to leave him.</p>

<p>"Stay not by my side," said the calif. "Thou
needst not fear me, Giafar."</p>

<p>"Strike at the life of thy slave, my lord," exclaimed 
the prince; "there will be many left who
can serve thee as well. But strike not a blow at
thine own honour; when once wounded, that thou
canst not heal."</p>

<p>"Nay, fear me not, I say. Thou mistakest my
purpose. I would but try the temper of these
swords&mdash;this tribute that the emperor hath sent
me. I would see," and here he smiled scornfully,
"if they are toys for children, or blades fit for a
soldier's use."</p>

<p>So sayings the calif descended to the lowest step

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

of the throne, and placing his foot upon the glittering 
blades, drew from its sheath his good Samsamah. 
Raised to the full stretch of his arm, above
the monarch's head, the weapon glittered for a moment 
in air, and then descended like lightning upon
the steel bundle, severing it completely in two, and
shivering the swords of which it was composed
into a thousand fragments.</p>

<p>A murmur of admiration ran through the court
at a feat of such dexterity and strength, and the
strangers wondered to see their best blades shattered 
like glass by the well-tempered sword of the
monarch. The calif's first movement was to examine 
the edge of his scimitar, to see if it had suffered 
from the rude concussion. The result of
this scrutiny seemed satisfactory, for he smiled
grimly, and reached the weapon to Giafar, who,
having scanned it carefully, returned it to his
master with a responding look of gratification.
Indeed we learn from the annalist of the times, that
"There was not the slightest bruise or indenture
upon its surface; proving," he adds, "both the
goodness of the blade, and the strength of the arm
that wielded it."</p>

<p>The calif having now reascended the throne,
turned to address the ambassadors.</p>

<p>"The courtesy of your emperor shall not be forgotten. 
I will well requite it," and he smiled bitterly 
as he spoke. "For every sword he hath
sent me I will bring to him a thousand, and strong
hands shall bear them&mdash;faithful hands&mdash;hands that

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

would turn them even against their own bosoms
at my slightest wish. Slaves!" exclaimed the
monarch, his face glowing with pride and enthusiasm, 
as he turned to the swarthy forms that
were ranged like bronze statues around the audience 
chamber&mdash;"slaves, have I not said aright?
Who of you has a life at his master's service?"</p>

<p>Obedient to this call numbers rushed forward,
and bent their necks to the ground in token of
their devotion to the calif's will. Haroun looked
upon them for a moment as they stooped before
his throne, and then beckoned an officer, who approached 
with his scimitar unsheathed.<sup><a id="r008" href="#n008">8</a></sup> At a sign
from the Commander of the Faithful, the executioner 
struck off the head of the foremost, and the
marble steps were deluged with blood. He looked
again upon the calif, and again the blade descended
upon its victim. Another look, and a third suffered 
the fate of the two former, yet still the ready
wretches gathered to the scimitar's edge, and even
when commanded to retire, seemed to linger for
their death, as for some dispensation from a propitious 
deity.</p>

<p>Stifled sobs, half-suppressed screams, and exclamations 
of terror, came from the surrounding
lattice, testifying the emotion of the fair beings
there concealed at this scene, one shriek sounding
loudly above the rest. At this the monarch frowning, 
turned his head hastily towards that part of
the chamber whence these sounds proceeded. All
was in an instant hushed. Silence, gloomy and

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

fearful, brooded over the assembly. Haroun
watched with gratified pride the emotion produced
upon the Roman knights at a spectacle so revolting; 
a spectacle at which even the calif's veteran
court were moved. As for the strangers, they
were stupified with horror; they stirred not, they
seemed hardly to breathe.</p>

<p>They were soon aroused, however, by the voice
of Haroun, who, turning to them with a stern
aspect, said,</p>

<p>"And now, ye misbelieving dogs, depart upon
the instant. Let not your horses' hoofs tarry upon
these plains. If to-morrow's sun finds you upon
this side the Euphrates, your carcasses shall fatten
the sands of the desert. Yet stay," he added, as
his eye glanced at Nicephorus's letter, which Giafar
still held, "your master's message shall not go unanswered."</p>

<p>He then dictated the following epistle of "tremendous 
brevity" (as it is styled by a distinguished
historian), which was written upon the outside of
the missive of the Roman emperor.</p>

<p>"In the name of the most merciful God, Haroun
al Raschid, Commander of the Faithful, to Nicephorus, 
Roman dog. I have read thy letter, oh!
thou son of a misbelieving mother! Thou shalt not
hear&mdash;thou shalt behold my reply."</p>

<p>This was sealed with the calif's signet ring, and
delivered into the hands of the ambassadors.</p>

<p>"Now away, and quickly," said the monarch,
"Yet before you depart, look around upon the

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

warriors that stand in my presence. Mark, ere
you leave this city, the many troops that are
arrayed within its walls. Note well my power,
and the devotion of my subjects. Then go, and
bid your emperor tremble; bid him keep within
the gates of Constantinople when his lord approaches. 
Let him not dare to face me in the field,
unless he can oppose me with warriors who can
die like mine, and weapons of a far different temper 
from these toys."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed to the glittering fragments 
which were strewed beneath his feet, and
glanced slightly at the headless bodies of his slaves
that lay near.</p>

<p>There were gazing on him at that moment some
gentle beings who loved him well, and who looked
to see some sign of pity and regret pass across his
features; but no&mdash;his mien was haughty, his
countenance stern and enkindled, and in imagination 
he seemed leading his troops to the rich conquest 
of the Grecian capital.</p>

<p>The Roman embassy retired slowly, and with
some appearance of dignity, but their bosoms were
awed by the calif's power, and sickened by the
display of his revolting despotism. They feared
lest a monarch so powerful, and so well served,
should make good the fierce threats which were
yet ringing in their ears. They feared lest the
desolation of war should follow close upon their
track, and enter quickly into their own land. They
looked to see the fierce calif answer with fire and

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

sword the stern message of their sovereign&mdash;a
message worthy the ancient dignity of the empire
if supported with bravery and effect, yet one which
must bring upon their heads the full fury of a warlike 
and powerful monarch.</p>

<p>After the departure of the foreign knights, the
hall was cleared of all but the lords of state, who,
assembled in full divan, held council together.
This, however, was but a mere form. Haroun
was bent on war; and his subjects were eager as
himself to wash out in the blood of their enemies
the stain upon their sovereign's honour. No time
was needed for preparation. All things were in
readiness for the field, and the calif was resolved
to lead his troops against the enemy without delay.
After a short deliberation, it was decided that the
army should set forth upon its march against the
infidels upon the following day.</p>

<p>"Giafar," said the calif to his vizier, as they left
the council chamber together, "I would see thee
to-night at the palace, after the hour of evening
prayer. I have somewhat to say to thee that
concerns thee nearly. And&mdash;dost thou hear me,
Giafar?&mdash;I have a gift to bestow upon thee that
thou little dreamst of; one, to which all former
favours are as nothing. Inquire no more of me at
present; to-night thou shalt know all. Farewell.
See that thou dost not fail me."</p>

<p>"I will not fail thee, my lord," replied the wondering 
prince, and they parted.</p>

Then sudden dropp'd a veil between.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lalla Rookh</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Indefatigable</span> as the calif was in the duties
which belonged to his high station, he was, as has
been said, extremely sensible to the pleasures of
social life. Though ready in the field, and constant 
in the divan, yet when the toils of state were
over, he delighted to surrender himself to those
enjoyments which abounded within the walls of
his palace. There, every pleasure greeted him;
sweet lutes and sweeter voices sounded in harmony. 
There, exquisite forms hurried through
the mazes of the dance, revealing, in fascinating
pantomime, their rival, yet unrivalled proportions.
Rare perfumes, rich viands, and delicious sherbets,
regaled and restored the senses, while Shiraz and
Kismische poured their forbidden but enlivening
currents.</p>

<p>At these hours the calif often sighed for the
presence of his beloved Giafar. While he was
absent, there rested a blank, a dark spot upon the

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

face of all his pleasures. Every enjoyment seemed
imperfect without the participation of his friend.
But the custom of the country forbade; the inviolable 
usages of the harem permitted not his entrance 
within its sacred precincts. There was
one method, however, by which this barrier to the
calif's wishes might be removed. As his son-in-law, 
as the husband of his daughter Abassa, the
doors of the harem would be thrown open to the
prince, nor could the most punctilious observer of
Eastern etiquette object to his admission within its
walls. Often and carefully had the Commander of
the Faithful pondered upon this subject, and no
measure in the government of his vast kingdom
occupied his attention oftener, or perplexed him
more, than the accomplishment of this purpose,
which seemed so necessary to his private happiness.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when he received
and dismissed the Roman ambassadors with such
haughtiness, as he sat in his palace awaiting the
coming of Giafar, the subject pressed upon his
mind with more than usual force. He had undertaken 
a war with a powerful nation, and was about
to bend to it with that energy which characterized
all his military operations. He was confident in
the valour of his troops, in his own qualifications
as a leader, and in the favouring power of Allah;
yet he failed not to perceive that the campaign
must be long and dangerous, and might be unfavourable 
in its issue. He himself might not return.

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

He had resolved to humble the pride of the Roman
emperor, and for this he would peril his life, to that
extremity, which his duty as a sovereign and a
commander would permit; for death, to his haughty
spirit, was preferable to defeat.</p>

<p>Thus situated, a motive besides the one already
mentioned, prompted him to give his daughter in
marriage to the prince. He wished to leave his
sons, who were yet young, under the protection of
one, united to him and to his family by the closest
ties&mdash;one, who if the chance of war should deprive
the kingdom of its sovereign, would be superior to
the temptations of ambition, and would watch
carefully over the interests of the sons of him who
had been his own munificent patron and father.
But the calif's foible was jealousy of power. He
feared lest this step might lay the foundation of
civil discord, which, though it might not interrupt
the tranquillity of his own reign, might disturb the
succession of his sons, and transfer the sceptre
into the hands of the Barmecides. This was the
thought that made him hesitate, that checked his
half-formed purpose, even when upon the verge of
resolution.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Giafar, in strange agitation,
was bending his way towards the imperial palace.
Hopes and fears came crowding in upon his soul.
He felt that he was approaching an important and
critical period of his existence, by the result of
which his future happiness was to be deeply
affected. Had his rank or fortune been less than

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

they were, he might have supposed that the intimation 
which had fallen from the calif's lips when
he last parted from him, referred to his advancement 
in one or both of these particulars. But he
was the first subject in the empire, and unless his
master resigned his crown into his hands, there
was no mark of esteem which he could now confer
upon him; save only one, compared with which
honours and wealth were of no account. When
the thoughts of the young prince dwelt for a moment 
upon this, the only boon, as it seemed to his
agitated mind, which the calif could now bestow
upon him, a vision of happiness stole with a soothing 
influence upon his soul. He was far away, in
some secluded spot, gazing into the eyes of his mistress, 
seeing there his wealth and treasure, encompassing 
in the circlet of his arms his domain, his
world, while rank and riches, as things of no worth,
were fleeting away in the distance.</p>

<p>A stifling oppression, which almost impeded respiration, 
aroused him from his revery. He collected 
himself, and proceeded more firmly on, for
his step had become slow and irregular. A few
moments brought him to the palace gates, yet ere
they had elapsed, the vizier was again lost in tumultuous 
and conflicting emotions. He composed
himself as he ascended the steps, and when he
entered the presence of Haroun, no trace of the
feelings which disturbed his bosom could be read
in his practised countenance.</p>

<p>Giafar found the calif occupied with the plans of

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

his extended expedition, and became in a few moments 
as deeply interested as his master, while
they spoke together of the state and number of his
troops, of the routes proposed, and of the general
plan of the campaign.</p>

<p>"Like you it not?" said the monarch, warmly,
as he sketched in a hurried manner a course by
which he proposed to lead his army even to the
shores of the Propontis&mdash;"like you it not, Giafar?
We will knock at his very doors. Allah be
praised, who has given his servant means to accomplish 
such a work."</p>

<p>" 'Tis a bold project, sire," replied the prince,
surprised at the extent of the calif's designs.
"Many a league of hostile country, many a fortress 
and walled town must be passed, ere you can
reach that sea."</p>

<p>"Has time dulled the scimitars of my warriors,
or age weakened mine own arm? I have bathed
my horses' limbs in those waters ere now," continued 
Haroun, his dark eye flashing as he spoke;
"and when I threatened Constantinople, what
saved that proud city? Submission and tribute."</p>

<p>"I was but a child, then, my lord," said the
vizier, "yet I have heard my father oft speak of
that war. But Nicephorus is a soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The more worthy of my arms. He will not
shun me, then, in battle. Be assured I shall seek
him there, and should the dog trust himself within
reach of my arm, with this sword will I convert
him to our blessed faith. Prostrate upon the

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

ground he shall abjure his accursed creed, even at
the feet of the vicar of our most holy Prophet&mdash;the
salvation and peace of God be upon him," added
the calif, in a subdued tone, yet his right hand was
still extended, as though present in the field he was
bidding defiance to an enemy.</p>

<p>"God grant it, sire! May you clip the wings of
the Roman eagle. Yet what part is mine in this
war?"</p>

<p>"You go not with us, Giafar," replied the calif.
"Let the care of my subjects be thine. Keep order
in the city; administer justice in the divan. Thine
own wisdom shall guide thy councils, and in the
execution of thy plans thou hast the sanction and
authority of my own name, and art clothed as with
mine own power. Thy father will aid thee in the
discharge of thy duties."</p>

<p>"My services are thine to command, sire,"
answered the prince.</p>

<p>"Strange! I thought to be hard beset with entreaties 
and prayers that thou mightst bear a part
with us in this gallant enterprise. What sayst
thou?" added Haroun, surprised at the prince's
silence&mdash;"not a word? I have known thee plead
as for life, to accompany me upon some excursion
to the frontiers, and now, when we strike at such
game, wouldst thou lag behind?"</p>

<p>"I have never tarried, sire, when thou hast
pointed out my path; but thou hast spoken; and
at the voice of the king the slave should humble
himself and be silent."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

<p>"I looked not to find thee thus complying," said
the calif, with a smile. "Thou wilt watch, too,
over all sedition and heresy which may arise
among my people, whether near or afar off. Nay,
it is near thee now; nearer than thou thinkest.
Iahia Ben Abdallah is, if I err not, plotting treason 
against my throne. I have watched him long;
often when he has little deemed that the eye of his
master was on him, have I read in the restless and
hurrying changes of his face, the workings of a
false and treacherous spirit. He waits but my
departure with the army to break forth into open
rebellion. Observe him closely. Upon the least
suspicion, do thou take his life."</p>

<p>"I will not fail, my lord, in aught which thou
hast commanded me."</p>

<p>"Yet hold," muttered the calif, musing to himself, 
" 'twere folly to be forestalled in this; he is all
craft and falsehood. I will waver no longer; not
an instant. Now that I have bethought me," he
continued, turning abruptly to the prince, an expression 
of dark determination gleaming suddenly
across his features&mdash;"now that I have bethought
me, let it be done without delay. Ere I depart
from Bagdad, bring me the traitor's head."</p>

<p>"If my lord will listen to the voice of his servant," 
said the young prince, with hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well, what wouldst thou say, Giafar? speak
freely."</p>

<p>"Thou mayst remember, my lord, that Iahia
Ben Abdallah came to thy court under an assurance 

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

of safety given to him in thy name by my
brother Fadhel, when sent by thee with an army
against him. That assurance thou hast since confirmed; 
and it will suit ill with thine honour, my
lord, thus to deal with him, without strong proof of
his faithlessness. Men will say that the promises
of princes are but as stubble, which the wind scattereth 
and the fire consumeth, when they should
prove as a band of well-tempered steel, bright and
unyielding."</p>

<p>"And what will they say of my wisdom and
prudence, Giafar, if I crush not the scorpion till it
hath stung me? if, with the power to stifle rebellion
in the cradle, I should wait until it leap forth in its
strength to peril my kingdom and my life? No;
he has forfeited his safety by his ill desert and
treachery: let him die."</p>

<p>"He is daily at court, my lord, and beareth him
like a faithful subject."</p>

<p>"Ay; and did not fears for a brother's honour
blind thee, thou wouldst see good cause for suspicion 
even in this. When Iahia first came to Bagdad, 
he led a life private and retired. He made
then no professions of fidelity, for then he meditated 
no treason. But now he seeks to cloak his
dark designs with adulation and a show of loyalty. 
I trust him not. Thou needst not plead for
him. I have spoken. Let him die."</p>

<p>Giafar saw that reply would be of no avail, and
he bowed his head in silence.</p>

<p>"Are all things ready for our departure upon the
morrow?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

<p>"They are, my lord, or nearly so. A few hours
will accomplish all that is yet wanting."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well done," said the calif. "But there yet
remains a subject of which I would speak to thee.
Months must elapse ere I can return from this
war; indeed, it may be that I shall never revisit
Bagdad."</p>

<p>"Fear it not, my most noble master," said the
prince. "Allah will watch over thy safety."</p>

<p>"I do not fear it, Giafar," was the quick reply.
"Were it written in the book of Heaven's decrees
that I should fall in this contest, and were the page
set before me by the angel who has it in his keeping, 
still I would not keep back. Yet if such
should prove the will of Heaven," continued Haroun, 
impressively, "upon thy faith do I depend
even after death. My testament&mdash;'tis in the hands
of my wife Zobeide&mdash;see that every tittle of it be
executed. Let not my sons be defrauded of their
rights; they are yet young; watch over their inexperience 
and guard their interests. Thou wilt
do it; I need not question it. Be to them what I
have been to thee; I will ask no more."</p>

<p>The vizier replied not in words, but his heart
was fully and his expressive features spoke eloquently 
of the fidelity that was swelling in his
bosom.</p>

<p>Haroun waited for no other answer, but exclaimed,
"I thank the Almighty that he has given
me such a servant! Without thee, my kingdom
were but a burden upon my shoulders, yes, and life

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

also. But thou hast well assisted me to support
them; and wilt continue yet to do so, may it
please the most merciful Allah!"</p>

<p>"With my life, sire, and long may it be spared
for thy service," replied the prince, with much
emotion.</p>

<p>"How, Giafar, can I reward thy worth? speak,
is there yet nothing which thou wouldst ask at
my hand?"</p>

<p>"My services are overpaid already, my most
generous lord," answered the vizier. "Owe I not
everything I am to thee?"</p>

<p>"True, true," said the monarch, "I have not
spared wealth and honours to heap them on thee,
so far as they have been mine to bestow&mdash;yet I
would bind thee closer to me still. My daughter
Abassa is worthy the hand of a king&mdash;nay, there
breathes no monarch, however powerful, upon
whom I would willingly bestow her. She is the
dearest treasure I possess&mdash;her virtues and her
beauties are unequalled, and the riches of India
could not purchase her from me. Yet to thee will
I freely resign her. Thy worth and thy fidelity&mdash;dost 
thou hear me, Giafar?" The prince had
stooped low, and pressed his forehead to the ground
before the calif's feet. "I give her to thee in
marriage."</p>

<p>It would be difficult for any pen, however eloquent, 
to describe faithfully the emotions of the
prince at hearing these words. The rapture of a
lover when hopes long nourished are gratified to the

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

full&mdash;the tide of bliss that rolls in upon the soul,
filling, even to bursting, that bosom whose current
despair has long stagnated, or conflicting hopes
and fears have urged into a restless storm&mdash;such
feelings many may know, but few can faithfully
portray.</p>

<p>"Thy daughter&mdash;the Princess Abassa&mdash;mine!
Let me hear it from thy lips again, sire. My
senses are confused&mdash;I may not have heard
aright."</p>

<p>"Rightly thou hast heard," said the calif, "but
in part only. I give her to thee as a public mark
of my esteem; not to gratify thy love. I give her to
thee that the strict usages of the harem may not
separate us as they often do, when I most desire
thy presence. Yet I would have no offspring of
thine dispute the succession with my sons, when
my head and thine shall lie low at the foot of some
cypress. What moves thee so? the colour is gone
from thy face, and thou tremblest like a frighted
girl! Nay, I will not deprive thee of those rights
which the customs of our country, and of our holy
religion, permit. Those bounds alone that restrain
every pious Mussulman shall be thine. Beauty
may yet spread her charms for thee, the fairest
slaves may grace thy harem, but my daughter&mdash;thou 
understandest me?"</p>

<p>The kind indulgence implied in the calif's words
had not the effect of calming the prince's agitation,
whatever may have been its nature. The red
blood crimsoned his brow for an instant, and then

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

retreated, giving place to deathlike paleness.
"My lord," was his tremulous reply, "thy servant
is quick to comprehend thy wishes," and then, after
some hesitation, he added, "and not less ready to
obey them."</p>

<p>Giafar had raised himself from the earth, and
endeavoured to compose his countenance, but
though he ordinarily commanded his features with
singular power, the present conjuncture seemed
too trying for his firmness. Conscious of this, he
covered his face with his hands; but a shivering,
like that of a chill ague, shook his frame, and betrayed 
to his observing master the existence of
some powerful and secret emotion. The calif
readily divined its nature, and addressed him with
some sternness. "Bethink thyself well of this
matter, Giafar. See that thou canst follow my
commands implicitly, for to err from them would
change the love I now bear thee into hatred as
intense. Examine carefully thy self-control, thy
fortitude. The princess possesses charms which
might subdue the coldest heart, will thine be able
to resist them?"</p>

<p>"I have felt their power, sire, but my soul is
thine; my very wishes are in thy keeping."</p>

<p>"Thou mayst have been moved by the sweetness 
of her voice, or delighted by her wit and
gayety; but thou has not seen her smile, thou hast
not looked upon her eyes or beheld the crimson of
her cheek. Thou knowest not the danger of the
trial to which my friendship would subject thee.

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

By the beard of my father! but thou shalt see her.
Thou shalt not enter blindfold upon a path which
may lead thee to thy ruin."</p>

<p>"Chance, my lord," said the prince, hesitatingly,
"chance has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"I have already seen her."</p>

<p>"How sayst thou?&mdash;seen her!" exclaimed the
calif. "Thy words border upon madness, or thou
speakest of what, in thine hours of slumber, thou
hast dared to dream."</p>

<p>Briefly, then, did Giafar relate to his jealous master 
the accident which caused the disclosure of
the princess's features in the desert, and the emotion 
which rendered her for a few moments unconscious 
of the exposure of her charms. As he spoke
of her anxiety for her father's safety, pleasure
lighted up his dark eye, and he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Ever mine own child! But how looked she,
Giafar?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful as the full moon when the sky is
without a cloud," replied the prince, enthusiastically. 
"Rightly is she named the 'Rose of Persia.'
Never thought I till then that such loveliness dwelt
on earth."</p>

<p>"But she was pale, thou sayst?"</p>

<p>"Fear, my lord, had placed his finger upon her
cheek, and stolen thence its colour."</p>

<p>"The fatigues of the journey, also," said the fond
father, "may have dimmed her beauty, and the
desert breeze, thou knowest, freshens not the roses

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

upon a maiden's cheek. I will not leave Bagdad
to-morrow, but will remain yet a day, that thou
mayst see my daughter, and decide upon a subject
which lies so near my heart. Let thy brothers set
forward with the army, immediately after morning
prayer. On the ensuing day, accompanied by
Ibrahim, and a few chosen warriors of his train, I
will follow, and can with ease overtake them. As
soon as the troops have left the city, come to the
palace; this key will admit thee through a private
staircase, into a gallery which overlooks one of the
apartments of the harem. Enter, and conceal thyself 
behind the lattice. When thou seest the princess, 
be prudent, he silent&mdash;let no sound escape thy
lips which may betray thee. And if from a regard
to thine own safety, thou shalt refuse a boon, which
may bring thee ruin instead of happiness, I charge
thee, Giafar, breathe not to mortal ear that thine
eyes have rested upon her. Thou shalt see her as
she comes attired from the hands of her maidens;
thou shalt hear her sing to her lute&mdash;thou shalt
know the full worth and danger of her attractions.
And when thine eyes have gazed upon her unveiled 
beauty&mdash;when thine ears have drunk in the
rich music of her voice&mdash;when thy soul has felt the
power of her bright glances&mdash;then thou shalt say,
if, as the husband of my daughter, thou canst obey
my wishes."</p>

<p>The wondering prince bowed low before his
master, in token of obedience; then taking from
his hand the key which was extended to him, turned
from him in silence, and departed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Who hath not proved how feebly words essay
To fix one spark of beauty's heavenly ray?
Who doth not feel, until his failing sight
Faints into dimness with its own delight,
His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess,

The might, the majesty of loveliness!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Bride of Abydos</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning the sun shone brightly
upon the land. Not a cloud intercepted his rays,
which were reflected with dazzling brightness from
shining arms and armour, which flashed and glittered 
in long array, as Persia poured forth her
chivalry from the numerous gates of the capital.
The tramp of warriors and the hard treading of
horses' hoofs were drowned at those intervals
when bands of oriental music passed along, by the
beating of tambours, the clang of cymbals, and the
wild and mournful sound of the horn, which gave
spirit, if need there were, to the step of the soldier,
and aroused in the breast of every hearer a martial
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach, a river of white
and red turbans was rolling across the plain. Here
and there, gayly floating down its current, were

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

seen streaming banners, high amid which was
waving gloomily the dark standard of the monarch.
Around this crowded the nobles of the nation, conspicuous 
among whom were Fadhel, Mohammed,
and Moussa, the brothers of the vizier. These
experienced warriors, mindful of the fatigues which
awaited them, rode steadily along, curbing with
careful hand the motions of their eager steeds, to
whose fiery restlessness their younger or more impatient 
companions gave free way, expending heedlessly 
those energies, which would all be needed
for the arid and toilsome journey before them.
Upon the walls were thousands of citizens, watching 
their departure. Turrets and terraces were
covered with mothers, wives, and maidens, gazing
veiled upon the dazzling yet melancholy scene.</p>

<p>Giafar saw them depart without a sigh. In his
bosom there was no response to the ardour and
exultation which were visible everywhere around
him. He took leave of his gallant brothers without
regret. As he pressed them in his arms, he uttered,
it is true, a few words in which he affected to envy
their good fortune, but they came not from his
heart. He lingered a while watching their progress 
over the plain, until distance slowly hid them
from his sight; then turning, he proceeded towards
the royal palace.</p>

<p>When before had he seen his companions in arms
depart for the battle, and he not eager to lead or
follow them; and why did he now rejoice that duty
kept him from the field? Why did he delight to

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

roam about the dull circuit of a deserted city,
when he might be spurring his steed at the head
of brave followers, and wandering through the
mazes of the ranged battle, his bright sword lighting 
him on his way. Struck by the change which
had taken place in his soul, he was constrained to
ask himself these questions. The answer was at
his heart, and the young prince blushed as he listened 
to its silent whisperings. War had no charms,
save to win him a wreath of myrtle. Courage
and brave deeds were of no account, but as they
might gain him the favour or possession of his
mistress.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the palace, he entered, and in
compliance with the wishes and directions of the
calif, unlocked a private door, which displayed a
staircase. Ascending this, he found himself in a
gallery which overlooked one of the apartments of
the harem. He then placed himself behind the
latticework, trembling with agitation, and awaited
the entrance of the princess. He was about to
look upon the loveliest creature of those favoured
climes, where beauty blooms in its full, its heavenly
perfection.</p>

<p>The Princess Abassa had been educated in strict
seclusion; for her rank in nowise exempted her
from those restraints which custom enjoins upon
the females of Eastern countries. Accident had
disclosed her beauty to the prince, with which exception, 
man had not looked upon her charms, save
her immediate relations, and those miserable images 

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

of manhood that flit about the harems of the
great, whose services the jealousy of their men or
the temperament of their women has rendered
universal throughout Asia. Yet the fame of her
loveliness had spread far beyond the walls of her
father's palace. Beauty unparalleled, and exquisite 
wit, were said to be her portion. The lute she
touched with the skill of Isaac, and her voice when
she sang to it sounded sweet as the angel Israfel's.
Men were accustomed to compare the blessings
and pleasures of life to her, or to some charm
which she possessed, as they would to a celestial
being in whose existence and attributes they,
through faith, believed.</p>

<p>Giafar waited with something like fear, yet impatiently 
for her appearance. He breathed quickly, 
his bosom felt oppressed, and now and then a
deep-drawn sigh came to his relief. He looked
through the lattice into the chamber below. No
living object was visible. The perfume which was
diffused throughout the apartment sickened him.
He turned to the window which opened upon the
river, and the breeze coming across its waters
fanned his cheek. Under its soothing influence he
became more calm, and in a few moments breathed
freely. A second time he looked through the lattice, 
and a little deformed black met his eye. He
was placing in due order the furniture of the
apartment. His light footsteps gave no sound as
he glided over the rich carpet. His eyes stole into
every corner of the chamber, and seemed to insinuate 

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

themselves behind each fold of hanging curtain 
and tapestry with which it was adorned.
Every irregularity in their arrangement was perceived, 
and remedied with such wonderful dexterity, 
that Giafar could not avoid admiring his skill, although 
he hardly thought himself safe from his
penetration. His task performed, the slave retired.</p>

<p>In a few moments the sound of voices and laughter 
was heard approaching, and a woman of noble
presence entered the apartment. She was closely
veiled, but, from her voice and manner, Giafar
knew her to be the Empress Zobeide. After her
came the Princess Abassa. That face&mdash;he had
seen it once, and never could forget it. But if the
glimpse which he had caught of her beauty in the
desert had sufficed to subdue his soul, now he was
absorbed, entranced, as he gazed upon the full lustre 
of her charms.</p>

<p>Her veil had been laid aside, and, for the travelling 
robe in which he had before seen her, she now
wore one of white silk, light and loosely flowing.
A vest of rich crimson fitted closely to her person,
sufficiently revealing how round and voluptuous
was the form which it affected to conceal. Her
loose trousers, although tied above the ankle, fell,
when she stood erect, even to her instep, permitting 
to be seen incased in a light sandal, a white
and delicate foot, which gave promise of a form
perfect in all its proportions. Nor would the
mind of the fortunate spectator have descended

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

from its high-wrought expectation, when the position 
of this beautiful creature permitted his eye to
ascend, in some slight degree, beyond the limits
just spoken of; for when she reclined against the
low divan, or upon one of the many cushions
which were strewn throughout the apartment, a
fair and exquisitely moulded ankle was visible,
even to where the silken band which confined her
dress below slightly compressed its polished surface. 
Encircling each limb was a ring of gold.</p>

<p>But it was only when her face was averted that
the prince could notice these interesting particulars.
His eyes are fixed intently there&mdash;his soul itself is
there. His very existence seems to be in the
ringlets of her hair, and upon her cheek and neck;
and Giafar's self is not where stands that motionless, 
breathless statue, that bears his image. "Just
Allah!" said the vizier, inwardly, "must these beauties 
which thou hast formed return to thee, like an
arrow that has not found its prey to the hand of
the huntsman? Shall these charms which deserve
love, and would so well repay it, fade, their worth
unknown, their sweet influence unfelt?"</p>

<p>Giafar was so deeply wrapped in the contemplation 
of the princess's beauty, and so absorbed by the
thrilling emotions to which it gave rise, that he observed 
not the entrance of the calif, who followed
his daughter into the apartment, and until he was
aroused from his revery by the sound of his master's 
voice, was not aware of his presence.</p>

<p>" 'Tis a strange fancy, father, but I have obeyed,

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

and you see me here dressed in the fashion you
admire."</p>

<p>The calif's face brightened with pride as he
gazed upon his beautiful child, and glancing his eye
carelessly around the chamber, he replied, "It is
well done&mdash;thy maidens have not failed in their
duty. But why is it strange, my daughter, that I
should wish to see thee thus arrayed? To-morrow 
I leave Bagdad&mdash;it may be for a long season,
and when I think of thee, it will be as I last saw
thee&mdash;thus."</p>

<p>"But," said Abassa, "while I am adorned like a
Circassian slave in the bazaars, why is my mother
thus robed? why is she covered with that odious
veil, as though there were eyes here that must not
look upon her?"</p>

<p>"Let my will suffice," replied the calif, with a
shade of sternness. "Be satisfied that it is my
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Be not angry with me, my father; I have done
wrong to question thy commands."</p>

<p>"Do not," said Zobeide, in a melodious tone,
"wear that angry countenance. I have often wondered 
that one who is so kind and gentle as thou
art, Haroun, should give way to anger, withering
and terrible as I have seen thee yield to; but, at
least with lambs do not clothe thyself with the
tiger's skin."</p>

<p>"I, Zobeide! I stern and terrible!" said the calif. 
"When hast thou seen me thus?"</p>

<p>"The fearful events of yesterday have not yet
passed from my remembrance," replied Zobeide.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

<p>"Fearful?" exclaimed Haroun, "yes, they were
so&mdash;but not to thee, not to the true believer. Thou
sawst infidels tremble, and the messengers of an
audacious misbeliever awed by the exhibition of
my power. But what was this to thee? thou hadst
no cause for fear."</p>

<p>"Those slaves, faithful beings," rejoined Zobeide,
"when they knelt at thy feet, I deemed it but a trial
of their fidelity, and my bosom glowed as I saw
them crowd to receive their death at thy command. 
But when the fatal&mdash;oh! I see them now,"
she added, covering her face with her hands, as
though she would thus exclude the remembrance
of the horrid spectacle.</p>

<p>"That scream, then, issued from thy lips? And
is it so, Zobeide? the only show of weakness
evinced by Moslem on that day came from thee.
Art thou not ashamed of such folly? By my life!
'tis a wise custom that mews you up like hawks.:
You are fit only for the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, my father, 'twas I that screamed," said
the princess, interrupting a sentence which promised 
to be anything but complimentary to her
sex. "I would rest content to be mewed up like
my own sefy,<sup><a id="r009" href="#n009">9</a></sup> and hooded, too, like him, rather
than look again upon a scene so cruel."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well," said Haroun, "that the honour of
Islamism depends not for its support upon women;
But can you regret that slaves have died in the
cause for which I venture my kingdom and my
honour? Is not my life, too, perilled every hour?

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

Do I withhold myself from danger when duty calls
me to it? Do you pity them? Slaves as they
were, could they hope for a death so honourable,
or so happy? Martyrs&mdash;they are now in paradise, 
and well will it be for thee, my daughter, well
for me, and thy mother, if our fate is so glorious
and so fortunate. To die in the cause of our most
holy religion," continued the monarch, with upbraiding 
wonder in his voice and countenance, "is
this what you regret, and for slaves? Look there!"
and as he spoke he directed their attention to one
of the many verses from the Koran, that were inscribed 
in letters of gold upon the walls of the chamber. 
"Say not of those who are slain in fight, for
the religion of God, that they are dead, yea, rather
they are living, but ye do not understand."</p>

<p>"Had the sword of an enemy struck them,"
replied Zobeide, "it were different far. But to fall
at thine own command!"</p>

<p>"What matters it how they fell, so that in their
death they brought profit and honour to Islamism?
It is the duty of the slave to die at his master's
bidding. Shall not <i>I</i>&mdash;" continued the monarch,
pointing his finger upward, while pride kindled in
his countenance, as he thought that Allah alone was
his master.</p>

<p>"I would these wars were over, father," said the
princess, "and that mankind would be content that
their fellow-men should differ with them in religion,
and not make it the subject of fierce and lasting
enmity."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

<p>" 'Tis a woman's wish, and savours somewhat
of impiety," replied the calif. "What are the lives
of the few when compared to the eternal welfare
of the many? The prophet of God has commanded
us to fight, until all nations shall have embraced
our most holy religion, and I, at least, will obey.
I will not lay aside this armour, while an infidel
lives to cast contempt upon our sacred law, until
paradise receives me."</p>

<p>"Thy life, then," said Zobeide, "must be a continued 
warfare; thine armour must be always
buckled on, and thy sword ever in thy grasp."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," replied the calif; "I shall rest
to-morrow, if to-day I have well laboured. Repose 
in paradise is the reward of him who watches
faithfully in this world. Why should I sheath my
sword or lay aside this armour? The enemies of
Heaven are mine; all, whether they blindly worship 
fire, or with impious ingenuity have framed a
belief which takes from Allah the supremacy, and
bestows it upon a fraternity of deities."</p>

<p>" 'Tis an idolatrous and fearful creed," said the
princess. "Whence is it, my father, that nations
which have excelled all others in learning give way
to error so strangely impious?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis their overweening presumption, their pride
of opinion which leads them to it," replied the calif.
"Not satisfied with what Heaven has revealed to
man, they would refine upon writings which have
been inspired by the Allwise. They mingle the
conceits of ancient philosophy with their religion;

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

they cannot forget that their fathers the ancient
Romans worshipped&mdash;what were their names,
Abassa? they have escaped my memory."</p>

<p>"They were, Jupiter, who reigned in heaven,
Neptune, in the sea, and Pluto, in hell."</p>

<p>"Right, right. Fools! blind are they. Reason
cannot open the eyes of their understanding, but,
by the blessing of Allah, this may somewhat enlighten 
them," said Haroun, laying his hand upon
his Samsamah. Upon this theme the calif always
grew warm. A good Mohammedan, for the most
part a strict observer of the Koran, a firm believer
in the unity of God, and the mission of his prophet,
he piously detested all infidels; but especially the
Christians, whom he termed idolaters; since by a
misconception of their tenets, general throughout
the East, they were thought to worship a plurality
of gods.</p>

<p>Zobeide, having by some playful remark checked
his growing anger, clapped her hands thrice, when
presently a slave entered, bearing fruits, sherbets,
and refreshments of various kinds. During the
slight repast which followed, Haroun called to
mind the business of the morning, which he had
quite forgotten in the warmth of the preceding discussion, 
and turning to Zobeide said,</p>

<p>"I leave to-morrow, thou knowest, to overtake
the army. I have given it in charge to Iahia, and
his son Giafar, to see that my testament is executed, 
if I should not return. Art thou satisfied
that it shall be so? or are there others that thou

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

thinkest more faithful, more worthy of the trust?
Thy wishes shall be mine in this matter."</p>

<p>"Is not the venerable Iahia the most estimable
of mankind, and are not his sons worthy of their
father?" replied Zobeide.</p>

<p>"Iahia is indeed an old and faithful servant of
the throne," said the calif. "I was wrong to
speak thus of him; but Giafar is young and ambitious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Giafar, father!" interrupted the princess; "can
you distrust him? His name, after thine, is oftenest 
in the mouths of the people. I have often
heard thee pronounce him the best servant sovereign 
ever had."</p>

<p>"He is brave and skilful," said the calif; "a
favourite with the nation; but he is the more to
be feared for this, should the prospect of a crown
tempt him to shake off his allegiance. Ha!
daughter?"</p>

<p>"You wrong him, father; I am sure you do.
One who is so generous, so prodigal of his own,
cannot covet that which is another's. I would
stake my life upon his honour."</p>

<p>"Thou undertakest warmly his defence, Abassa.
Hast thou not a word to say for his brothers, his
father, or is he alone worthy of thy praise?"</p>

<p>"They are all worthy," said the princess, blushing; 
"they are proverbial throughout Persia for
their liberality and bravery. Listen what the poet
says of them.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

<p>" 'I asked the dew* if it were free.</p>

<p class="small">[*The symbol of liberality.]</p>

<p>" 'It answered, "No, I am the slave of Iahia
Ben Khaled."</p>

<p>" ' "I will purchase you, then," I said.</p>

<p>" 'It replied, "That cannot be. I am the inalienable 
heritage of his family." ' "</p>

<p>She sang this to her lute, and her voice gave
double sweetness to the beauty of the verses. As
she looked up in the face of an admiring father, she
discovered an expression of smiling exultation
his eye, which he had just withdrawn from the
gallery opposite. This was unintelligible to her,
until a sigh which broke from the entranced vizier
came an interpreter to her doubts. With a scream
she flew to the arms of her mother, while sob after
sob testified a trepidation which must appear
affected, or be incomprehensible, to females of our
more free and social countries. She buried her
face in her mother's lap, and enveloped her head
and neck in her robe, with a care too undivided
to bestow a thought upon the rest of her person.
Her mother reproved her fears, and would have
persuaded her that her suspicions were unfounded,
to which she only replied, smiling through her
tears, "Hast <i>thou</i> no fear, my mother? Give
then thy veil." At the same time she reached
her hand, as though she would grasp it.</p>

<p>The terror which Zobeide exhibited at this action 
was not less than that evinced by her daughter. 

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

"Art thou mad?" she exclaimed, drawing
the veil more closely to her face, and resisting, with
some force, the efforts of Abassa to rob her of its
protection. Haroun seemed to participate in the
fears of his favourite, for approaching, he said
somewhat harshly to his daughter,</p>

<p>"Thou art a foolish child. If thou fearest to be
looked upon by thy parents, keep from their presence. 
Go! yet stay," he added, relenting, "kiss
me ere thou goest."</p>

<p>"Not now, my father," said Abassa, still hiding
her face and weeping; "but do not forget to see
me ere thou leavest, to give me thy blessing and
forgive my childish folly."</p>

<p>Her mother departed with her, and Haroun
sought the vizier in the gallery. He sought in
vain; Giafar was no longer there.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Giafar</span> left his place of concealment agitated
and confused. The charms of the princess, her
gayety and loveliness, had finished to enslave him.
When he had descended into the open air, he tried
for a moment to put some order into the reflections
which were hurrying to and fro across his mind,
that from thence might be framed a resolution suitable 
to the emergency before him. It was in vain;
he had not the power. He looked up; the walls
of the harem frowned above him&mdash;a gay prison,
which contained his world&mdash;around was a populous
waste. He pulled his turban tightly over his
brows, and with folded arms walked hurriedly
towards his home.</p>

<p>When there, he entered, and having retired to
the solitude of his own chamber, gave himself up
to the distracting emotions which were rending his
bosom. What an angel had he seen! what innocence 
and beauty! Had the idea of such perfection 

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

ever before visited his fancy? No; not in
dreams even, when the mind is all unfettered, and
passes the confines of this world.</p>

<p>"I could gaze for ever on her," he exclaimed,
"as I have gazed to-day, and ask no other happiness. 
And this blessing is offered to me&mdash;this
perpetual enchantment&mdash;to have her ever near
me, to hear the music of her voice, to dwell in the
sunshine of her smiles, and to be looked upon by
those eyes of hers! Is there in the wide extent of
Allah's universe a heaven like this? Stay! stay!"</p>

<p>Other emotions seemed now to agitate the young
prince's bosom, for he paced the apartment with a
hurried step, muttering in broken sentences the
thoughts that disturbed him.</p>

<p>" 'Tis cruel! To point the pilgrim to a delicious
shade, when his way perforce lies across the hot
desert&mdash;it were as kindly done. Yet the choice is
mine. I can refuse an offer so tempting and so
dangerous. I need not put my lips to the perfumed
cup when the full draught is not for me. Better
to be wretched alone, than make her a partaker in
my misery. Yet is this the sole alternative? Is
there no other? Allah have mercy upon me! the
blessing of our holy Prophet be with me!" exclaimed 
the unhappy vizier, prostrating himself
upon the carpet. "I know not what to do!"</p>

<p>Here for some time he remained, his face buried
in his hands, but revolving with all the calmness
which the agitated state of his feelings would permit, 
the various prospects of his future life. After

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

some moments he arose, saying, "It shall be so&mdash;I 
cannot live without her now. Time may remove
every obstacle to my love&mdash;the calif may relent.
Indeed this may be but a trial of my fidelity. Death,
too," thought the idolizing prince, "which my master 
so often and so boldly courts, may soon release
me from my allegiance;" but a thought so ungrateful 
he dared not frame into words, it slept in his
bosom. "I will tell the calif that I am ready to
submit myself to his commands&mdash;I will go instantly.
Yet have I the firmness necessary for the task?
Will he not read in my countenance all that I would
conceal within my bosom? I fear me that he would&mdash;I 
will write to him. The parchment cannot disclose 
more than therein is written. It will not
tremble at the calif's glance. Yes, I will write.
The firm ink will not grow pale, as I should, in my
master's presence."</p>

<p>He then took a roll of parchment from an adjoining 
cabinet, and after long and restless deliberation, 
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="center">"<i>To his master Haroun al Raschid, from Giafar
the slave</i>.</p>

<p>"Thy servant has gazed upon the palace of
beauty, and a chain of smiles, glances, and sweet
sounds has fettered fast his senses. Yet his heart
is in thy hands. It is a strong fortress which love
for thee will guard from every intrusion. No passion 
can enter there to dispute with thee its possession.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

<p>"Thy daughter's hand is a gift more valuable
far than all the favours which thou hast yet bestowed 
upon me. But I would not that an unwilling 
bride should cross my threshold. If the princess 
of her own free choice will become the queen
of my Zenana, the happiness of thy slave will consist 
in obedience to his master's wishes."</p>

<br/>

<p>Having sealed this letter he gave it to a slave,
with orders to place it in the hands of the Commander 
of the Faithful. Yet his mind is ill at ease&mdash;his 
reflections pain and distress him&mdash;there is no
rest for the unhappy lover. He leaves his abode,
followed by four slaves, and proceeds to the river.
There he enters a barge, and by a sign directs them
to row to his garden, a few miles down the stream.</p>

<p>It was noon. Not a breath of air ruffled the
surface of the Tigris. Its swift current hurrying
capriciously along was a picture of the vizier's own
busy, fluctuating existence; and a lesson of patience,
and consolation it might have been to the unhappy
man, had he thought upon that gulf in whose quiet
bosom those struggling and fitful waters were so
soon to be at rest. But the scene was not in unison
with his feelings. The magnificence which reigned
on the preceding day had disappeared, and the heat
of the meridian sun had driven even the fishermen
to the shore. His was the only boat upon the waters. 
All was too quiet and too still to harmonize
with the commotion within his soul. He would
have held on his way in storms, when the thunder

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

cloud had waked the river into fury, and the angry
elements were wildly striving for the mastery. As
it was, the agitation of his mind manifested itself
in abrupt orders to increase the speed of the boat,
which in a short time became so remarkable as to
draw many a silent surmise from his wondering
attendants; for in those arbitrary lands, life is often
held by so frail a tenure, as to depend alone upon
the well-pulled oar, or the swift foot of the steed.</p>

<p>Such suspicions, however, soon vanished, when
Giafar, after having landed at his villa, slowly
bent his way along the margin of the river. He
waved away the sherbets which were proffered to
him by the ready hands of his servants, but drank
of a running fountain, having first bathed his aching
forehead in its cool waters. He then wandered
through the long avenues of trees that shaded the
grounds; and having found the most retired spot,
there surrendered himself to meditation. He forgot 
what was passing at the city, he remembered
not the stern command of the calif respecting his
enemy Iahia, his near departure too, and that the
care and government of the kingdom were soon to
devolve upon him. All was forgotten except his
mistress.</p>

<p>Deep shade dwelt everywhere around&mdash;and
silence also, unless were heard the rustling of
leaves, the song of birds, and the murmuring of
adjacent fountains. "How sacred would her presence 
render this spot!" exclaimed the prince,
"What delight would be infused over these walks,

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

and how hallowed would become the shadows of
these trees. To walk here with her&mdash;to read to
her our own delightful poets, and to hear her sing
their verses. The treasures of literature shall be
brought from afar&mdash;the sages of the west shall display 
to us the jewels of their lore&mdash;together we will
love and learn. I shall envy the breeze if it plays
too freely through her tresses. I shall be jealous
of the stars lest such happiness should win them
down to rival me. I was right not to refuse such
a treasure. I shall be content with this, even if no
more is to be mine." So reasons he who has not
tasted of the cup, but not so when the bright wine
mingles in his veins, and the current of his blood is
warmed by its magic fire. The experience of Giafar 
must have taught him this, and though Hafiz
had not yet sung the power of love, he should have
known what that prince of Persia's poets has since
so beautifully taught in the song which contains the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The path of love is a path to which there is no
end, in which there is no remedy for lovers but to
give up their souls."</p>

<p>From a revery into which he had fallen he was
aroused by the sound of oars, and presently he saw
the calif's barge gliding swiftly down the current
of the river towards his abode. The fluttering
black pennant told that the Commander of the
Faithful was on board.</p>

<p>The prince rose, and hurried to the basin where
the barge landed to receive his master. At a word

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

from him be seated himself at his side, and they
returned together to the city.</p>

<p>"Art thou mad, to leave the city at such a time?"
said the calif, glancing at his countenance and his
garments, both of which bore evident marks of the
disturbed condition of his mind. "I have sought
thee throughout Bagdad, but in vain."</p>

<p>Giafar strove to appear calm, and replied,</p>

<p>"I am not myself, sire. Few are there that
could gaze upon what I have gazed on to-day, and
yet remain unmoved. Besides, I fear lest the princess&mdash;thou 
hast received my letter?"</p>

<p>"I have, Giafar, and understand thy fears. But
thou art deceived; my daughter freely consents to
be thy wife. Here, this is for thee."</p>

<p>The calif then placed in the prince's hand a
letter. It was "For Giafar al Barmeki, from the
Princess Abassa." He could have pressed the
lines to his lips, but refrained, and read the following 
verses in Arabic, written in fair and feminine
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had resolved to keep my love concealed
within my bosom, but it escapes, and declares itself
in despite of my efforts.</p>

<p>"The light wind as it visits thy dwelling carries
with it my burning sighs, and the dew of midnight
mingles with my tears, when I think upon thine
image in the garden.</p>

<p>"Triumph, if you will, in my secret and my
shame, but know the tyrant love reigns in my heart
and moulds me at his will."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

<p>Giafar could hardly trust his senses as he read.</p>

<p>"Can it be? could she have written these lines?"
were the thoughts that passed doubtingly across
his mind.</p>

<p>"Art thou satisfied?" said the Commander of the
Faithful.</p>

<p>"I am," was the hesitating reply. "My happiness 
is sealed. I shall await thy return impatiently, 
when I may obtain an honour so undeserved 
and unlocked for."</p>

<p>"Thy nuptials shall not be long delayed," said
the calif. "And the spoils, it may be of royalty,
shall grace them."</p>

<p>"May you return in safety and with honour, my
most noble master," said the prince. "May your
enemies be covered with confusion; may dust be
upon their faces."</p>

<p>"Doubt it not," said Haroun. "Fear not but I
shall take good account with the misbelieving dogs.
Hast thou seen Iahia Ben Abdallah?" resumed the
calif, after a short pause. "Hast thou seen that
traitor, and dealt with him as I commanded
thee?"</p>

<p>"Will my lord the calif pardon his slave?"
replied the prince. "He has been unmindful of
the duties which he owes to his master. Thoughts
of thy goodness, and of the favour thou designest
for him, have alone filled his bosom to-day. Save
these, all else has passed from his remembrance.
He has been forgetful even of himself."</p>

<p>"I will not chide thee, Giafar; but thou mayst

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

not dally in this matter, save at sore peril, as I fear,
to the peace and welfare of my people. His skill
and cunning, his restless ambition, his numerous
and powerful friends, all call for prompt and decisive 
action. Delay not, then; but so soon as I
have left the city, do quickly that which I have
spoken. Bid the slaves pull lightly upon their
oars; I would not yet land. So. I leave with
thee, Giafar, mine own honour, and the happiness
of my subjects. They will be well cared for;
thou needst not assure me of it. My wife Zobeide
and the Princess Abassa, I leave them likewise
with thee. The relation in which thou now standest 
to them both, makes it of right thine office to
protect and guard them. If sad, dissipate their
sorrow by well-timed amusement, dancing and
music, the hawk and hound. Minister to their
slightest wishes, if within the limits of my power
and honour they can be gratified. Thou mayst
even see them at times, and enliven their sorrow
with thy presence. I will not set thee bounds in
this, but will confide in thy judgment, thy discretion. 
If I should not return from this war (I sin
thus to doubt the goodness of Allah, yet I will
speak it), if I should return no more, be a son, a
husband to them. My sons, too&mdash;but of that I
have spoken in my testament&mdash;thou wilt faithfully
execute my wishes?"</p>

<p>"Fear it not, my most noble master," exclaimed
Giafar, pressing his lips to the calif's hand, "my
life is ever at thy service."</p>   

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

<p>"I do not fear it, Giafar. Thou seest this jewel,"
here the calif drew a ruby ring of great value from
his finger, "it was a legacy from my father Mahadi
(upon whom be peace!), a pledge of my succession
to the throne. Since it was given me it has never
been in the possession of another. When a grasping 
and malicious brother, not content with the
crown which as eldest born he had inherited, envied 
me the possession of this ring and sent to demand 
it of me, I refused to resign the treasure. I
chose rather to commit it to the deep waters over
which we are now gliding, and to the care of the
genii who make their home in its caves. Well
did they fulfil the trust. At the appointed time&mdash;but 
thou hast heard of its strange recovery from
the bed of this river; thou wert then, I remember,
far away in Khourdistan, yet the tale sure has oft
been told thee. Since that time it has never parted
from my finger. In battle it has been there, shining 
amid steel blades, and even when clothed with
the sacred veil, when all worldly ornaments are
put off from the body, as all vain thoughts should
be banished from the mind, even at an hour so
holy it never left my hand&mdash;'twas sacred!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the calif carried the ring to his forehead, 
and strong emotion was visible in his countenance. 
Having overcome this, he gazed for a
moment upon the jewel, and then pressing it to his
bosom, continued, "I am not superstitious, as I
think. I believe not in the tales of magic and enchantment 
that daily greet my ears, and confiding

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

as I do in the goodness of Allah towards his
servants, I err in yielding thus to the gloomy forebodings 
which disturb my bosom as I resign this
treasure into thy hands. Thou wonderest; but thou
heardest not the words which were addressed to
me by the strange being who, from the caverns of
the deep, rescued my long-lost treasure. They are
yet ringing in mine ears. But take it&mdash;it is thine.
It will give thee entrance into the inmost recesses
of the palace. I could part with it, Giafar, to none
but thee, and not to thee, but that I believe thy very
wishes and passions are mine; mine to control and
direct&mdash;mine by the strong tenure of true allegiance 
and firm unalterable friendship."</p>

<p>Giafar received the ring from Haroun in silence.
His thoughts were too big for utterance, but as he
pressed the hand of his master to his lips, he inwardly 
swore never to wrong his confidence, or to
suffer temptation the most seducing to lead him
from the strict path which friendship and honour
called upon him to pursue. The calif rightly interpreted 
these mute asseverations, and placing his
finger upon his lips, as an injunction of silence, remained 
buried in thought. Silently they gain the
shore, silently they ascend from the river's edge,
and silently seek together the royal palace.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Coriolanus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning the calif set forward
to overtake the army. The prince bore him company 
for some leagues without the city; then, having 
taken a warm farewell of his master, returned
to Bagdad. He returned to bury himself in the
cares of government. It was with great difficulty,
however, that he could quiet those fears, hopes, and
regrets, those wild emotions which of late had made
a chaos of his bosom. He felt himself unfit for the
duties which had been assigned him. Love was
his lord; at his high bidding he had become a slave,
and the allegiance which he owed to another clashed
harshly with the submission demanded of him by
that exacting tyrant. But the temper of the prince
was too firm, if not too upright, to be diverted by
motives however powerful from employing all his
zeal and activity in the service of his indulgent
sovereign. Irksome as were the duties which
awaited him in the execution of his trust, yet he
bent to them with his accustomed energy; and until

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

the city had recovered from the excitement and
disorder into which it had been thrown by the departure 
of the calif, he ventured hardly to bestow
a thought upon his mistress.</p>

<p>The sentence of death which the Commander of
the Faithful had passed upon Iahia Ben Abdallah
was as yet unexecuted; and although unwilling to
be the instrument of his destruction, yet Giafar felt
that the commands of his master were imperative,
perhaps just, and he durst not disobey them. Accordingly 
he proceeded forthwith to their fulfilment.</p>

<p>It will be here necessary to explain at some length
to the reader, the grounds upon which Iahia Ben
Abdallah founded his claim to the califate, and to
exhibit the strong hold which he had upon the affections 
of all Mussulmen, as lineally descended
from Mohammed through his daughter Fatima, and
from Ali his nephew, son-in-law, and vicegerent.</p>

<p>Ali, the son of Abu Taleb, was one of the earliest 
and most ardent supporters of Islamism. He
was indeed the first who embraced its tenets, with
the exception of Cadijah, the wife, and Zeid, the
freedman of the Prophet. He was the peculiar
favourite of that wonderful enthusiast or impostor,
who dignified him with the title of friend, brother,
and vicegerent, and gave him to wife his beloved
daughter. Although during the lifetime of Mohammed 
he was looked upon as his legitimate and
expected successor, it was not until that high station 
had been occupied by three intermediate califs, 
Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, that his right

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

was recognised and his merit rewarded. After
the murder of Othman, whom he in vain endeavoured 
to defend from his enemies, he succeeded
to the califate.</p>

<p>Yet his heroic valour and unequalled eloquence
could not secure his government from the assaults
of faction and rebellion. A conspiracy was formed
against him by two powerful chiefs who had been
his rivals for the califate. Having suppressed this,
he turned his arms against a more dangerous competitor, 
who arose in the person of Moawiyah, of
the house of Ommaides, a relative of the preceding
calif, who had appointed him governor of Syria.
Under the pretence of avenging the death of his
kinsman, he displayed for his standard the skirt*
of Othman stained with his blood, and having collected 
an army of fourscore thousand men, proclaimed 
himself calif, and prepared to sustain his
title and prosecute his revenge.</p>

<p class="small">[*The fingers of his wife were pinned to it; they had been
cut off while vainly endeavouring to defend him.]</p>

<p>Ali advanced against him, and in numerous sanguinary 
though indecisive engagements bore off
the advantage. To spare the effusion of Moslem
blood he proposed to terminate their quarrel by
single combat, but Moawiyah durst not encounter
the sword of his invincible rival, the "Lion of God
ever victorious,"&dagger; as the Prophet himself had named
him.</p>

<p class="small">[&dagger;Then Ali called out to Moawiyah, "How long shall the
people lose their lives between us? Come hither, I challenge
you to appeal to the decision of God." Whereupon Amrou said
to Moawiyah, "Your cousin has made you a fair proffer." Moawiyah 
said it was not fair, because that Ali knew that no man ever
came out against him, but he killed him.&mdash;<i>Ockley</i>, Hist. Saracen.]</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

<p>In a severe battle which ensued the victory was
snatched from the grasp of the lawful calif by an
artifice of Moawiyah. At the instigation of his
lieutenant, the crafty Amrou, he caused his wavering 
soldiers to advance with leaves of the Koran
fastened to their lances' points, crying out, "This
is the book which should decide our differences.
This is the book of God between us and you."
Upon this the troops of Ali threw down their arms,
and the quarrel of the two rivals became the subject 
of arbitration and treaty. By these Ali was
deprived of Syria, a considerable and wealthy portion 
of his kingdom, and not long after suffered
death in a mosque at Cufa, by the hand of a fanatical 
assassin.</p>

<p>His eldest son Hassan, a man of amiable and
pacific disposition, resigned the califate to Moawiyah, 
and retired to the solitude of a cell near
the tomb of his father. Hosein, his youngest brother, 
was of a different temper. After the death
of Moawiyah, at the solicitation of his adherents
in Cufa, he crossed the desert with a slight guard,
expecting them to rise in great numbers at his
appearance. In this he was disappointed. His
messenger at Cufa was betrayed and slain. Obeidollah, 
the governor of that city for Yezid, the son
and successor of Moawiyah, had discovered and
suppressed the threatened insurrection, and on the

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

plain of Kerbela, Hosein was surrounded by a
body of five thousand horse under the command of
Amer the son of Said.</p>

<p>"Amer drew up his men," says the historian,*
"in the evening of the ninth day of the month
Moharram, and came up to Hosein's tent, who
was sitting in his door just after evening prayer.
As they were advancing, he was leaning upon his
sword asleep. His sister Fatima came and waked
him, and as he lifted up his head he said, 'I saw
the Prophet in my dream, who said, Thou shalt rest
with us.' Then she struck her face, and said,
'Woe be to us!' Conditions were denied him by
his enemies, and he was summoned to submit
himself unreservedly to the mercy of the calif. He
desired till morning ere he returned an answer, a
favour which was reluctantly granted him, one of
Amer's men saying, 'that if a Deilamite, a nation
which they mortally hated, had asked such a small
request, it ought not to have been refused.' His
sister came to him in the night, sighing and weeping 
over the ruin of their race. 'Alas!' she said,
'for the desolation of our house! I wish I had
died yesterday, rather than have lived till to-day;
my mother Fatima is dead, and my father Ali, and
my brother Hassan! Alas! for the destruction
that is past, and the dregs of it that yet remain
behind.' Hosien endeavoured to calm and encourage 
her, and replied, 'Sister, put your trust in God,
and depend upon the comfort that comes from him;

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

and know that everything shall perish but the presence 
of God, who created all things by the word
of his power, and shall make them return, and they
shall return to him alone. My father was better
than I, and my mother was better than I, and my
brother was better than I; and I, and they, and every
Mussulman has an example in the apostle of God.'
He then represented to his friends that he was the
only victim which his enemies required, and desired 
them to leave him, and depart in safety to
their homes; but Al Abbas told him they would not,
and said, 'God forbid we should ever see the time
wherein we should survive you!' Finding that
they would not be persuaded, he commanded his followers 
to cord their tents close together, and fortify
them with a trench, so that they should not be surrounded. 
The remainder of the night was spent
in prayer and supplication, while the horsemen of
the enemy were riding round about their encampment."</p>

<p class="small">[*Ockley.]</p>

<p>In the morning, having washed and anointed,
he perfumed himself with musk, and then mounted
on horseback, placing the Koran before him. His
little band numbered only thirty-two horse and
forty foot; but their slight intrenchment rendered
them inaccessible to the horsemen, excepting only
in front. The enemy, from compassion, hesitated
to commence the combat, and one chief deserted
with thirty followers, all choosing the rather to
meet death with Hosein than to share the victory
with his foes. Various single combats were fought,

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

in all of which Hosein's men were superior, "because 
they fought like men that were resolved to
die." In each close encounter, likewise, the Fatemites 
were invincible, and their enemies were invariably 
repulsed by their courage or despair. A
body of archers were then brought up, who poured
in their arrows upon them so thickly, that all of
Hosein's horsemen were dismounted and many
killed.</p>

<p>After a short truce, which was allowed for the
noon prayers, the fight again recommenced, the
enemy still keeping aloof and discharging their arrows, 
until all of Hosein's followers were severally
slain. Overcome with fatigue, he then sat down
at the door of his tent, for his reluctant enemies
hesitated to attack him. His little son Abdallah,
whom he had taken upon his lap, and his nephew,
"a beautiful child with jewels in his ears," who
ran forth from the tent to embrace him, were both
killed in his arms. His mouth was presently
pierced with a dart while drinking, and lifting up
to Heaven his hands, which were filled with the
blood of the children, and his own, for some moments 
he was lost in prayer. An officer of the
enemy, the relentless Shamer, now encouraged his
men to surround him. As they approached "he
threw himself into the middle of them, charging
sometimes on the right and sometimes on the left,
and whichsoever way he turned himself, they flew
off like so many deer before a lion. At last one
wounded him upon the hand, a second upon the

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

neck, while a third thrust him through with a
spear. When he was searched there were found
upon him three-and-thirty wounds and four-and-thirty 
bruises."</p>

<p>His body was trampled by their horses' feet
into the earth; the head being first out off and
sent to Obeidollah. The brutal governor struck
it upon the mouth with a cane.* "Alas!" exclaimed 
an aged Mussulman, "upon these lips have
I seen the lips of the Apostle of God." The tombs
of Ali and of Hosein "the martyr" are to this
day annually visited by their votaries, and the
death of the latter is celebrated by the most extravagant 
lamentations.</p>

<p class="small">[*Gibbon.]</p>

<p>The affecting interest of the preceding relation
might perhaps alone excuse its insertion here, but
besides this it will serve to exhibit the estimation in
which the children of the Prophet's daughter, and
of his nephew, are held by the followers of the
house of Ali; and to show how that estimation is
heightened and increased, even to veneration, by
the recital or remembrance of the cruelties which
have been inflicted upon the most meritorious of
that excellent family. The story of the "Day of
Kerbela" must excite the coldest to pity, and the
mention of the name rouses in the bosom of a Persian 
the wildest emotions of sorrow and revenge.
Even yet, the admirers and adherents of that
as they meet annually together, exalt its merits and

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

recount its sufferings, until grief rises into phrensy, 
and difference in doctrine becomes a ground for
bitter and unforgiving hostility. From the opposite 
opinions as to the superiority of Ali over all
the other successors of the Prophet arises the great
schism which still divides the Mohammedan church.
The Sonnites, or orthodox, of whom are the Ottomans, 
esteem the four first califs alone as legitimate 
imams, and hold them equal: while the Schiites, 
or heretics, of which number are the Persians
of the present day, passing by Abuleke, Omar, and
Othman, look upon Ali as the first lawful pontiff, a
title which they likewise bestow upon Hassan,
Hosein, and the offspring of Hosein to the ninth
generation. In all parts of Islam, the descendants
of the Prophet are distinguished by peculiar privileges. 
Even in the Ottoman empire they are the
only hereditary nobility; they are entitled to wear
a green turban, and to be judged by their chief
alone; the meanest and poorest of that house,
though clothed in rags, bears the title of emir, or
prince, and the most excellent of the race are
thought to be more highly gifted than angels.</p>

<p>Of this noble yet unfortunate family was Iahia
Ben Abdallah a descendant. He was the grandson 
of Hassan, the eldest son of Ali, whose right as
firstborn, though obscured, and in some measure 
superseded by the merit and martyrdom
of his brother Hosein, still gave to his descendant 
a claim to the respect and affection, if not
the homage of all Islam. The house of Abbas,

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

however, was not without other rights to the
throne than those of actual possession. They were
descended from an esteemed uncle of the Prophet,
and when the first calif of that race raised his
standard against the white banner of the house of
Ommeyah, he was welcomed as the avenger of the
Fatemites; and the gloomy colours which he had
chosen were assumed in real or affected mourning
for their misfortunes. Well were their injuries
avenged; the house of Abbas triumphed, and the
blood of the Ommiades drenched the streets of Damascus. 
A single youth of that family alone
escaped, and eluding the pursuit of his enemies
traversed Egypt and Mauritania, crossed the
Mediterranean into Spain, and founded at Cordova 
the dynasty of the Ommiades, which for more
than two centuries held possession of that fair
country.</p>

<p>The power which the Abassides had thus acquired 
they still retained, and for successive generations 
they had ruled the East, feared by their
enemies, beloved and respected by their subjects,
and swaying the sceptre with a hand so firm and
vigorous, as to strengthen their power and consolidate 
it upon the firmest basis. Relying, however, 
upon the estimation in which his family was
held, urged on by hope and ambition, Iahia had
thrown himself into the conflict, and during the
reign of the present warlike and energetic monarch 
had raised a body of troops, and proclaimed
himself calif in the provinces of Giorgian and Dilem, 

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

drawing after him a great number of followers. 
Fadhel, the elder brother of Giafar, a commander 
of great ability, had been sent against the
rebel, who surrendered to him, having first obtained 
pardon for his adherents, immunity for his
own offence, with the promise of an honourable
maintenance at the capital. This treaty had been
ratified by Haroun, and Iahia, having pledged fidelity 
to the calif, came and dwelt in Bagdad.</p>

<p>His life, hitherto, had been retired and apparently 
blameless. If there was aught in his conduct 
which demanded scrutiny or deserved punishment, 
it had escaped the vigilance of the vizier,
and knowing the hasty jealousy of the calif's temper, 
Giafar feared that his commands respecting
Iahia might be the result of ill-founded suspicion,
and that to fulfil them would blemish his master's
honour, of which he was as careful as of his own.
He was also not without reluctance to shed that
blood which is so sacred to all Mohammedans,
unless for a crime clearly shown and well deserving 
such punishment. But choice was not allowed
him. Unwillingly, therefore, and with hesitating
steps, accompanied by a slave, he bent his way
towards the dwelling of Iahia, for the purpose of
executing the sentence which Haroun had passed
against him.</p>

<p>It was on the very day upon which the calif had
left the city. He had chosen an hour which the
indolence of Asiatic manners devotes to seclusion
and repose&mdash;an hour past midday&mdash;when he should

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

not fail of finding his victim. When he arrived at
the abode of Iahia, he entered the outer gate without 
knocking or giving any notice of his approach,
and having crossed the court, presented himself at
an inner door which gave admission into the more
retired portion of the building. A slave there met
him, of whom he required to see his master. "He
is in the harem, my lord," answered the slave; a
reply which, even in matters of more than ordinary 
importunity, is sufficient in Eastern countries
to deter a visitor from pressing his errand. Giafar
heeded it not, however, but bending a stern glance
upon the slave, bade him inform his master that
the vizier required his presence. The slave withdrew, 
and in a few moments Iahia entered the
apartment. He was a man rather beyond the
prime of life. He was tall and strong of frame;
his dark eye, small and full of motion, denoted the
craft which was said to make up a good portion of
his character; his chin, far advancing and square,
spoke firmness and resolution; while his beard,
slightly grizzled, and so trimmed as to project considerably 
forward, added to the expression of this
feature, and rendered it predominant over every
other. He wore a dark-coloured caftan, a vest of
crimson, and trousers of white. His turban was
green, the colour of the house of Ali, and the distinguishing 
mark of an emir or descendant of the
Prophet. He seemed pale and disturbed; his
dress was disordered, as though he had just risen
from repose, and evinced the hurry and perturbation 

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

of mind which prevented him from receiving
his guest with that form and dignity which were
his due. A thrill as of fear was visible in his countenance, 
when his eye, after resting for a moment
upon the stern features of the prince, who had not
yet spoken, turned to his swarthy attendant.</p>

<p>"Thou tremblest," thus Giafar addressed him;
"why fearest thou? Is it the consciousness of
guilt which causeth thee thus to dread my presence?"</p>

<p>"The hour is unusual, my lord, and of itself
would tell me that thine errand is of no common
kind; thy brow, too, thus fixed and frowning,
which I will remind thee thou hast not worn to me
of late, and&mdash;" Here he glanced at the slave, and
his silence was full of meaning.</p>

<p>"Iahia, son of Hassan, thou shouldst clothe thyself 
with more firmness. Be mine errand with
thee what it may, thou shouldst hear it as becomes
a man, and one who is well descended."</p>

<p>"But the time, my lord! thus sudden; when the
mind is all unbent&mdash;but a moment since surrounded
by those dearest to me&mdash;wife, children. But I
have ill said," he added, checking his emotion;
"what matters it the hour? Speak out thine
errand, Prince Giafar, since it must be."</p>

<p>Giafar was moved by the words and manner of
Iahia, and he hesitated ere he produced the fatal
mandate. In a moment, however, he held forth to
him the order of the calif for his death, saying, as
he placed it in his hands,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

<p>" 'Tis written here."</p>

<p>"How! Death!" exclaimed Iahia, after he
had glanced at the writing. "Why? for what?
How have I deserved this fate?"</p>

<p>"Thou needst not ask!" was the reply. "The
sentence, thou seest, has gone forth, and questioning 
cannot avail thee."</p>

<p>"It cannot be, my lord," said Iahia, collecting
himself, and speaking firmly, without faltering, or
show of fear. "My safety is shielded by the
promise of a noble and generous monarch. He
could not prove thus faithless to himself. 'Twere
treason against his honour to credit it."</p>

<p>"Thine unbelief will not save thee, Iahia; thy
fate is sealed. Yet I will not unduly hasten it.
Retire for a space; perform thine ablutions, repeat
thy last prayers to Heaven, and then submit with
firmness to that doom which thou canst neither
resist nor avoid."</p>

<p>"I will not suffer in silence the execution of an
unjust decree," was the reply. "I will not yield
up my life without calling heaven and earth to witness 
that I am innocent of aught which deserves
such punishment, that I am the victim of falsehood
and treach&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giafar made a slight motion to the slave, which,
however, did not escape the notice of the hapless
Iahia. His firmness instantly forsook him, and
throwing himself in a posture of supplication at
the prince's feet, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"A moment wait, my lord&mdash;till thou hast heard

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

me. If thou wilt pursue thy purpose, if I must
suffer, at least refuse not to listen to a few words
which I would fain utter in proof of my innocence."</p>

<p>"Speak, then," was the reply; "though the
short time which yet remains to thee were better
spent in repentance of thy sins and prayers to
Allah."</p>

<p>"I speak to one who, like Allah, hath power to
dispense life and pardon; one who is just and
merciful."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest a worm to his fellow-worm.
But rise, address me as man should his equal; the
slave hath no power over his brother but as my
lord the calif has commanded."</p>

<p>Iahia then rose, and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"I need not remind thee, my lord, that when I
surrendered my person into the hands of thy brother 
Fadhel, I was at the head of a numerous band
of followers. Though inferior in numbers to the
army which thy brother commanded, they were
nevertheless faithful and resolute, and thou well
knowest might have contended obstinately and
with some prospect of success for the great prize,
to gain which I had perilled my fortune and my
life."</p>

<p>The prince, by an inclination of the head,
assented.</p>

<p>"Though the chance of war seemed against me,
yet the cause which I had espoused was far from
desperate. A fortunate encounter, a midnight

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

surprise, nay, a single blow against thy brother's
life&mdash;and he did not spare himself in the strife&mdash;might 
have rendered me victorious, and would
have filled my ranks with thousands who needed
but the least glimmering of success to range themselves 
under my standard. Thus stood my affairs
when I proposed to surrender myself into the
power of thy brother, upon condition that my life
should be spared, and that I should be sent to the
court of the calif, there to reside upon an ample
maintenance which should be assigned me from
the royal treasury. True it is, my lord, that had
I been conquered in the war, my life had been forfeited, 
perhaps those of my whole house, or, at
least, want and misery had been their portion. I
will not deny that fears like these in some degree
governed me in my course. Had they not done
so, instead of standing before thee under an unjust
sentence of death, I might now be giving laws to
Islam. Thou smilest, Prince Giafar&mdash;the caprice of
fortune and of war have been stranger than this
ere now. But it is idle thus to speak. My offer
of surrender was accepted by thy brother, confirmed 
by the calif, and protected, as I thought, by
the faith of a noble monarch, I disbanded my
followers, and gave up my person, and was sent
hither to dwell in Bagdad. Here have I lived, a
peaceful subject of the calif, honouring his dignity,
submitting to his power, and in all things comporting 
myself as a loyal and true Mussulman. If
either in word or deed I have done otherwise than

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

this, I have forfeited my right to protection. Let
it be shown that I am thus guilty, and I will give
up my life into thy hands without a murmur.
Until then I am shielded by the calif's word even
from his own anger."</p>

<p>The cold damp which stood in drops upon his
forehead disappeared; a faint flush stole upon his
brow, and the pallor of his cheek was usurped by
a crimson that hurried thither, and passing, returned
again as quickly while he observed the emotion and
hesitation that clothed the features of the prince.
His voice, too, which despair had rendered calm and
steadfast, now became tremulous with hope. He
continued earnestly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think, my lord, upon the honour of thy house&mdash;regard, 
too, that of the calif. How will both be
stained should the life of one, even though an enemy, 
be sacrificed in defiance of a sacred pledge to
the promptings of ill-founded and unjust suspicion?
Thy master's name for truth and uprightness will
vanish; the title which he now bears of 'Just,'
and which, if report speaks truth, he prizeth above
all price, will be lost and torn from him. Men will
brand him as a tyrant, and future ages hold up to
scorn and detestation that monarch whose fame now
fills the measure of the world."</p>

<p>Iahia perceived that Giafar was moved, and
without giving him time to reply, he fell at his feet,
and seizing the border of his garment, addressed
him in these words, which are said by the historian
to have affected the prince to such a degree that he

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

was induced to abandon his design, and spare the
life of Iahia, although in opposition to the command
of his master: "<i>Fear God, and be not of the number 
of those who at the day of judgment will have the
Prophet for their enemy, for that they have dipped
their hands in the innocent blood of his descendants</i>."</p>

<p>"Rise, Iahia," replied the prince. "For the
present, thy life is safe. I may incur the anger of
the calif in slighting his commands, but I would not
for the kingdoms of this world, that when in the
presence of the judge, my book is opened, it should
be found written therein, that a single drop of that
blood has been shed unjustly by my hand. Yet
give good heed to thy ways. Let not ambition
tempt thee from thine allegiance. Choose not
treachery for thy portion. Punishment walks with
it hand in hand, and will not fail to visit thee, though
the merits of thy whole race should plead for thee.
Nay, rise," continued Giafar, for Iahia still knelt at
his feet pouring forth his gratitude in oaths of fidelity,
and in boundless wishes for the prince's welfare&mdash;"rise; 
if thou wouldst indeed repay me, prove by
thy life and actions that in thus sparing thee I have
not erred. Continue or become a faithful subject,
so shall I escape the anger of the calif, and rejoice
that I have granted thee thy life, even though in
defiance of his vigorous commands."</p>

<p>Renewing his protestations of innocence and
thanks, Iahia rose, and summoning his slaves,
commanded them to spread a rich collation, and

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

directed one of their number to bring a costly robe,
with which he would have clothed the prince.</p>

<p>Giafar coldly refused this mark of Iahia's gratitude, 
saying, "I will neither eat nor drink in thy
house, nor receive any favour at thy hands, until
thou art cleared of this stain. Farewell! keep thyself 
far from treachery and deceit. If thou art
already implicated in such guilt, withdraw thyself
quickly from it. 'Tis a snare which will prove thy
ruin. Thus shalt thou preserve thy life, and render
me blameless in having spared it." Having thus
said, without remaining to listen to the reiterated
vows of fidelity and gratitude which Iahia poured
forth, the prince departed.</p>

<p>"Can he deceive me?" thought Giafar, as he returned 
slowly homeward. "I will watch him
closely&mdash;I may have erred in dealing thus mercifully 
with him, and should evil come of it, hardly
shall I excuse my conduct to the calif. Yet it is
better thus. Rather should ten guilty ones escape
punishment, than one innocent suffer unjustly. I
think not, in truth, that his balance in the next world
will be light, who in this has in aught dealt unjustly
by the offspring of the most holy Prophet. Peace
be upon him!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">And he, with many feelings, many thoughts,
Made up a meditative joy, and found
Religious meanings in the forms of nature.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> far from the city dwelt a dervis famed for
his sanctity and austerity, who had given up the
interests of this world, and in solitude devoted
himself unceasingly to religious contemplation. He
was of the order of the &OElig;ulwanys, and was supposed 
to have been instructed in the rules of the
fraternity by the founder of the order, that blessed
sheik himself. It was about ten years since he
first took possession of his rude cell. His temporal 
necessities had been continually supplied by the
piety and generosity of the citizens, and neither
want nor curiosity, during the course of that time,
had drawn him from his seclusion.</p>

<p>The spot which he had chosen for his retreat
seemed framed by nature for his hallowed purpose.
It was a spacious cave, which lay deep in the side
of a mountain, formed by huge rocks, piled irregularly 
one upon the other, the entrance to which
was sheltered and narrowed by trees that on all
sides, above and around, were dipping their boughs
into its gloomy area. Lofty cedars and palms

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

bristled up the ascent of the mountain, while at its
base, the dark cypress and the triste willow drooped
their heads over a small but beautiful lake. From
the side of the mountain, many a hurrying rivulet
leaped joyously into its bosom, making in its fall
sweet music for the peris, if any there were, that
inhabited the depths to which it hastened.</p>

<p>One of these streams had with apparent self-denial 
left its companions, and turned aside from its
course to pass near the cave of the dervis. Here,
with ceaseless labour, it had framed a rude basin
of stone, for the wants of the recluse, which having
filled even to overflowing, as though conscious of
delay, it sped with redoubled velocity to rejoin its
companions. Here the old man performed his
daily ablutions, and from its benevolent stream refreshed 
the few herbs and flowers which he reared
in an adjacent garden. Yet, notwithstanding this
expenditure of its waters, the bed of that fountain
was never dry, and to many it seemed a miracle
that in the long heats of summer, when the waters
of the lake became diminished and low, when every
other source was withheld, which might give freshness 
and coolness to its bosom, that stream still
poured unceasingly its generous current. It was
a beautiful illustration of the merit and reward of
almsgiving, that duty so oft inculcated in the Koran; 
and engraven in the rock, upon its margin,
was this appropriate verse from its blessed pages:</p>

<p>"If ye make your alms appear, it is well; but if
ye conceal them, and give them unto the poor, this

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

will be better for you, and will atone for your sins,
for Allah is well informed of what ye do."</p>

<p>Beautifully variegated fish inhabited the lake,
which might be seen shining and flashing far down
through its clear waters, and clustering around the
green rocks. They were sacred. The entreaties
of the good man had obtained for his finny favourites 
immunity from the treacherous arts of the fisherman; 
and what had at first been granted as a
favour was soon claimed as a right, until, in process 
of time, it was considered sacrilege to take
them. This superstition was strengthened by the
belief that mysterious ties existed between the
dervis and the inhabitants of those waters. For
at noonday, attracted by the freshness of the stream
which entered the lake close by the good man's
cell, they might be seen crowding to the shore
where he stood. Often would he feed them with
his hands, and, if rumour might be trusted, in some
strange tongue hold converse with them. Some
there were, who asserted that while looking upon
the surface of the lake, its waters had become agitated, 
the old man had appeared rising from its
waves, and moving on his way as in an element
most familiar to him. These strange rumours injured 
in no degree the reputation of the recluse
for sanctity, which was unbounded; nay, there
were many who esteemed more highly the old
man's virtues, when they supposed him to possess
some power, or art, beyond the ordinary limits of
our nature.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

<p>His learning was extensive. None equalled
him in ancient lore, none knew so well the customs
and manners of foreign lands, and none explained
and commented on the Koran with the fervour and
clearness of Sheik Ibrahim. Many a repentant
Moslem has returned from the holy father's cell,
lightened of his sorrow, and cheered by the words
of the book of promise, as they have been adapted
to his spiritual wants by the ingenuity of that good
man. The armed warrior, when going forth to
fight the battles of the Most High, oft stooped from
his caparisoned steed to receive the blessing of
Allah, at the hands of his aged servant. Many a
lovely Persian maiden has stolen from the gay
walls of the harem, to seek the sacred solitude of
his dwelling; often for the comforts of religion,
but oftener to enjoy the freer air of those delightful
woods, and to talk with one who could tell them
tales of distant lands, varying thus pleasingly the
monotony of their secluded lives. Attentively
would they listen, as he rehearsed to them the bold
and masculine manners of the Western dames,
how they scrupled not to go unveiled, to sit in the
assembly of warriors, and to crown the conqueror
with their own fair hands; and at the recital they
would blush and rail. Yet oftener pure religion
was the sage's theme, and that excellent philosophy 
which, if it cannot sweeten the cup of misfortune,
can, by its influence, render him that drinketh insensible 
to its bitterness.</p>

<p>Hither had the beautiful Abassa often wandered,

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

to minister to the temporal necessities of the recluse, 
and to receive instruction from his lips.
Various were his lessons; astrology, history,
tales of foreign countries, their climes, their manners, 
and their wonders, all were imparted to her,
and in a style which showed that the narrator had
in person beheld those things which he recounted.
He had instilled into her mind the principles of
religion, and told her that its aim was to make man
tolerant and happy. He had taught her to judge
with lenity of the faults of others, and was well
pleased to see the delight with which her pure and
flexible spirit received these truths. Her presence
was always welcome to the good old man, nor was
the princess's pleasure less in listening to the sage's
lessons. It was no task to her to pass long hours
in his cell, and while she revered him for his sanctity, 
repeated and delightful intercourse taught
the maiden to love him as a parent and an instructor.</p>

<p>Why comes she trembling now? what is it
moves her? Her attendants are left without the
wood; she has descended from her litter, and proceeds 
on foot towards the sage's cell. For the first
time she comes with a lingering step. Now she
hesitates upon her path, and seems to doubt whether 
to proceed or to retrace the road. Then, as
with an effort conquering her timidity, she hurries
forward to gain the cell, ere her fears again rally to
oppose her progress. Why is this? whence proceeds 
this irresolution? Why, when she has

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

reached the cave, does she recoil, as though some
robber of the desert lay there concealed? She is
not the same Abassa that she once was. Then,
as she came bounding along to meet the sheik,
how light and joyous was her step, and how mirthful 
her countenance! But she is all changed.
That bosom where peace dwelt, is now tenanted
by a passion that can brook no rival in power, that
is rarely content until he has reduced, under his
imperious sway, every thought, every wish, every
hope. He enters, too, with a restless train of jealousies 
and fears, which, eager to assert the supremacy 
of their master, are active in expelling those
calmer inmates, that fill yet oppress not the
bosom.</p>

<p>When she left her home to seek the sacred city
the very birds were not so happy&mdash;so careless as
she. She knew not sadness then, for she knew
not love. The attention of the vizier Giafar, his
care for her safety and comfort upon that trying
journey, had sunk deeply into her heart, while his
accomplishments had interested and delighted her.
She ventured not to interpret his soft tones, his
now earnest, now hesitating language, as an evidence 
of his admiration; yet from that moment so
critical to them both, when she beheld his eyes
fastened in rapture upon her unveiled countenance,
she could doubt no longer. She sighed to herself
the secret that she was beloved. She had now
found, as it were, a key to that subject of which
she had ignorantly read so much, of which poets

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

had written, and she had dreamed. Verses which
she had formerly sung sweetly, yet without
thought, now covered her face with blushes, and
filled her bosom with a strange confusion.</p>

<p>What wonder was it that she should hesitate,
that she should tremble as she drew near the
dwelling of the recluse. The thought, though it
were but half formed, of concealment, threw
around her an air of distrust, which affected her
deportment the more that she was unaccustomed
to its influence. When she last left the old man
her bosom kept from him no secret; he read there
as in a book displayed, all&mdash;even her most secret
thoughts. But now, love had written there with
a pen of fire, had timorously rolled up the scroll,
and had sealed it with his own seal. How mysterious 
are his ways! These frail barriers to the
strong hand of authority become like iron&mdash;they
yield not to force. Friendship, with its gentle and
dexterous touch, can alone undo them, and disclose 
a secret thus defended.</p>

<p>She knocked lightly at the rude door of the cave,
and a voice from within was heard saying "Enter. 
Thou art welcome, daughter," exclaimed the
venerable man, who came forward to meet her
with gladness beaming in his countenance&mdash;"welcome 
as the morning to him that watcheth. But
why hast thou tarried thus from my poor dwelling? 
'Tis long since thou hast honoured it with
thy presence."</p>

<p>"Ah, say not honoured!" exclaimed Abassa;

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

"how can mortal honour that which is consecrated
to Heaven? When I first entered this cell I felt
like some unhallowed thing, passing within the enclosure 
of a sanctuary. I feel thus still, and
though thy kind care, thy soothing words, have in
part dispelled that awe, yet the charm is not all
broken&mdash;nor would I wish it, for 'tis woven, as
I think, by no malicious power&mdash;but thy blessing,
father."</p>

<p>"The blessing of Allah be upon thee, my child,
and the presence of his holy Apostle, upon whom
be salvation and the peace of God!" said the dervis, 
his face being towards the holy city, and his
arms extended over the bending form of the princess.</p>

<p>"I had need of thy blessings father," said Abassa, 
heaving a long repressed sigh; "my bosom is
now lighter than it was."</p>

<p>"What troubleth thee, maiden? Why hast thou
not sought my presence ere this? Many days
have elapsed since thou hast returned from Mecca.
I thought that the sun would not rise and set upon
thee in Bagdad, until thou hadst visited my cell.
I have looked daily for thee, and I knew not before
how much the happiness of an old man depended
upon creatures of clay." A tear was visible in
the eye of the sage, and he spoke in a reproachful 
tone, which melted at once the heart of the
maiden.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" she exclaimed; "not a day has
passed since my return that I have not purposed

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

to visit thy solitude, but there has been that <i>here</i>
that has kept me back." As the princess said this
she pressed her hand upon her bosom, and added,
"I feared to come."</p>

<p>"Feared! my daughter," said the sheik;
"none but the wicked fear this solitude. But tell
me, what has troubled thus thy peace? Wilt thou
not answer?" Her features mantled with crimson 
and she answered not. "The air is cool and
balmy," continued the old man, in a kind, encouraging 
tone; "come, let us walk together under
the shade of yon palm trees; there thou wilt unfold 
to me all that is concealed within thy breast,
and fear not that the bosom of Sheik Ibrahim is
an unsafe depository for the secrets of a maiden."</p>

<p>Abassa led the way. She had drawn aside her
veil while in the cave for the purpose of seeing
with more distinctness the features of her venerable 
friend, and when she came into the open day
heeded not that her face was still uncovered.
Well was it for the happiness of Father Ibrahim
that his thoughts were fixed on Heaven&mdash;that, buried 
in devotion, he heeded not the outward form
and beauty of woman. Yet many there are, I
ween, who would deem it a surer safeguard to his
peace, that age had chilled with its ice the old
man's bosom, and staid with a palsying hand the
sluggish current in his veins. To what a drear
cold region are we all hastening! The chill which
binds the Arctic in ice equals it not. Let the warm
sun shine down upon its chains, and they are at

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

once dissolved, but beauty's noon cannot release
from its icy fetters imprisoned age.</p>

<p>The sage looked upon her sunny beauty unmoved, 
yet with admiration, for an unusual colour
had come to her cheek that day. Benevolence
swelled in his bosom as he gazed upon her. It was
as though his eye had rested with delight upon
some fair edifice: it was not his; yet he had
adorned it with his own hands, he had embellished
it with furniture costly and rare, and he looked
anxiously that it should find an owner worthy of
the fair possession&mdash;one who would prize it as he
ought. Yet for him, content dwelt within his
humble cell. The sun had declined well down
the horizon&mdash;the breeze came freshly through the
waving boughs, roughening with its pure breath
the lake. Hardly a sound was heard around
them&mdash;their very footsteps were distinctly audible,
though they trod upon a carpet of soft verdure,
with which nature had clothed the borders of the
mountain. The hour was sweet&mdash;its influence
sank into their souls. "How delightful is this
retirement!" said the hermit; "could you not give
up the world to live at peace in such a spot?"</p>

<p>"It is not permitted a Persian damsel to choose,"
replied Abassa. "Thou hast told me that far away
to the west, maidens devote their days to solitude
and religion, but with us it is not so&mdash;why dost thou
ask, father? Thou knowest I could not, if I
would."</p>

<p>"My question has no meaning beyond its surface," 

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

answered the old man. "I would know
what value thou placest upon this world and its
pleasures. Couldst thou not resign them all, did
religion require it of thee?"</p>

<p>"I could, I think&mdash;rich jewels and robes, our
dear baths&mdash;yes, yes, I could&mdash;music&mdash;the song of
our poets, and&mdash;" She blushed and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Tell me freely, my child," said the recluse,
"couldst thou not?"</p>

<p>"Do not try my spirit, father," answered the
maiden. "Thou knowest how dear this life is to
me, thou hast thyself done much to render it so.
Thou hast stored my mind with knowledge, thou
hast taught me to study the heavens and the earth,
and as in a scroll unfolded, read there with delight.
My father, my mother, friends well beloved, bind
me here. The ear, the eye, every sense brings to
me some pleasure, and thou thyself hast told me
to enjoy them. Thou hast told me how oft man's
folly defeats the benevolent designs of Heaven, and
that abstinence and satiety are equally crimes;
why should I deprive myself of all these? besides,
I am not mine own."</p>

<p>"No, thy father's."</p>

<p>"Not his, good Ibrahim; he has given me to
another."</p>

<p>"Another?"</p>

<p>"Promised me, I meant to say."</p>

<p>The blood recoiled to the maiden's heart as she
spoke, and her cheek and lips were left pale, while
a strange mingling of sensations, of which pleasure

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

made up the greatest part, forced a tear down her
cheek, that had by this time regained its colour.
She wiped the moisture from her eyes, and covering 
her face with her veil, sought to hide those feelings 
which a maiden would conceal from all but
her lover. Father Ibrahim mistook her emotion,
and with the deepest interest inquired to whom
she was betrothed. He received no answer. "Art
thou to be sent far away, a victim of state policy,
to be made the seal of an alliance with some powerful 
tyrant that will not know thy worth?"</p>

<p>"Who is there to whom my father would consign 
me?" replied the princess. "The emperors
of Roum and Frangistan are infidels, and he would
turn with disdain as I should with horror from such
an alliance. The princes of Spain and Egypt,
though professors of our holy faith, are enemies of
the house of Abbas. No, I am to remain with you."</p>

<p>"Allah be praised!" exclaimed the dervis. "I
was a fool to think it. No one that knows thy
worth would part with thee, and thy father loves
thee well. But who is there worthy of thy hand?"</p>

<p>"Knowest thou no one that may deserve me?"
said the maiden, timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is <i>one</i>, thine equal in every quality,
save that a busy intercourse with this rude world
has made stern his soul and rendered him less gentle, 
less mild than <i>he</i> should be to whose keeping
thy happiness is to be intrusted. I speak of Giafar 
al Barmeki."</p>

<p>"Thou hast guessed rightly, father," said the

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

maiden, tremblingly&mdash;"it is he. I am glad that
thou thinkest highly of him."</p>

<p>"Can it be!" exclaimed the old man. "Has
Heaven granted my prayer? I rejoice to hear it.
Allah be praised! He alone is worthy of thee."</p>

<p>"Am I not fortunate, then," said the princess,
after a short silence&mdash;"fortunate as the damsels of
the West, that wait not to be wooed, but boldly
court the husband of their choice?"</p>

<p>"Fortune has indeed smiled upon thee," rejoined
the sage, "if thine own wishes respond to thy father's 
will, if thy heart is given where thou must
per force bestow thy hand. Yet speak not so
harshly of European maidens. Accuse them not
of forward boldness. Their cheeks would redden
at the charge."</p>

<p>"I speak but as thou hast told me, father," said
Abassa.</p>

<p>"Thou hast strangely misinterpreted my words.
In their speech, modesty and restraint reign unceasingly, 
and if they woo, 'tis but with bright
glances, and the winning attitudes of their lovely
forms."</p>

<p>"It matters little, good father. Is there not a
voice in the eyes as intelligible and powerful as
speech? Methinks neither with looks nor words
should a maiden woo a lover. The rose invites
not him that is without to enter and pluck it from its
stem, neither when he approaches who has permission 
from the master of the garden, does its bloom
heighten or its fragrance increase to entice him."</p>

<p>"But were it thy doom to be sent far away, as

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

the bride of some prince thou hadst never known
or beheld, wouldst thou not then envy the liberty
which the maidens of the West enjoy?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," answered Abassa. "Freedom
that we know not, we do not desire. I have long
looked upon my fate as in my father's hands, and
have rested secure. Even were that lot mine of
which you speak, I might be content. I could
bear it I think. But I will not nerve my mind to
evils that present themselves not. My father's
kindness has fixed me here. The plant flourishes
yet where it has been reared; when the wind scattereth 
its leaves, may they be strewn upon the plain
it has adorned."</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Father Ibrahim, as the distant
voice of the muezzin gained his ear, "to prayer!
to prayer! Hear you not the holy summons?"</p>

<p>They both knelt upon a small carpet, which the
hermit spread upon the ground, and said the namaz
of the afternoon. The prayer over, they rose, and
perceived they were not alone in their devotions.</p>

<p>"Who can it be kneeling yonder?" said Father
Ibrahim, who first discovered the presence of the
intruder. "Remain here, my child, I will accost
him. Stay&mdash;he rises&mdash;'tis the Prince Giafar.
Mine eyes have not looked upon him these many
moons. Shall he not approach?"</p>

<p>"As thou willest," said the maiden, adjusting
carefully her veil. "My presence shall be no bar
upon your wishes."</p>

<p>The old man, then, by his looks and gestures,
invited the prince to draw near.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">In silence bowed the virgin's head;
And if her eye was filled with tears,
That stifled feeling dared not shed,
And changed her cheek from pale to red,
And red to pale, as through her ears
Those winged words like arrows sped;
What could such be but maiden fears?</p>

<p class="right"><i>Bride of Abydos</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Giafar</span> came forward, and stooping to the old
man's feet, kissed the border of his garment. The
customary salutation of peace then passed between
the Princess Abassa and himself, accompanied by
a mutual bend of courtesy, with the right hand to
the breast, the prince carrying his hand to his forehead, 
and shading his eyes in token of great respect, 
as though in the presence of one too sacred
to be gazed upon.</p>

<p>"I am in the presence of the Princess Abassa?"
he said, inquiringly. An inclination of the head
answered this interrogatory in the affirmative.
"An idle question; veiled as thou art, fair lady,
mine eyes would know thee amid a thousand.
Allah shower down his choicest blessings on thee,
and make thee happier even than thou art How
hast <i>thou</i> fared, good father?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

<p>"Well, well, my son; though my mind would
have been more at ease than it is, had I seen thee
ere this. I feared lest I had been forgotten by
some who are most dear to me."</p>

<p>"Thou couldst not think it, father," said the
prince. "Business of much moment has kept me
from thy solitude. The burden of state is upon
my shoulders; I am wearied with its weight.
Distracting thoughts, too, have been working upon
my mind, and rousing it into phrensy. All these
thou shalt know, yet do not reproach me."</p>

<p>"Nay, I complain not, my son, this life is not all
sunshine. Rather is it 'a tempest in the night; at
times it lightens, and at times we are left in darkness.' 
But why is thy bosom thus disturbed?
Where is thy firmness, where thy fortitude, with
which thou hast so often striven against the ills of
life?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis gone," replied the prince. "It has deserted
me. My courage, too, has flown&mdash;nay, wonder
not, I speak truly, father, or why am I here?
Why am I not by the side of my noble master,
now, when he has most need? It had not happened 
thus," he added, despondingly, "but that all
manhood has left my bosom."</p>

<p>"Peace has its claims as well as war," said the
princess. "Is it not duty that keeps thee here?"</p>

<p>"I thank thee, lady, for thy words. Thou art
kind and gentle&mdash;thou wouldst pour balm into my
wounds, and there is no hand can do it, save thine,
on this side the grave. Yet I deserve not this

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

kindness from thee. Far from my thoughts were
duty and honour when I wished to remain behind.
When thy noble father consigned his kingdom to
my charge, I murmured not. I might perchance
have wrung from him his consent that I might share
with my brave brothers the dangers of this war;
but no entreaty, no prayer escaped my lips, for&mdash;why 
should I disguise the truth? though it might
well shame me to confess it&mdash;here was I bound.
Chains, strong though unseen, were fastened upon
me, and held me here&mdash;nay, listen to me; I have
much desired this meeting. I have long wished to
see thee, to know from thine own lips my fate.
Knowest thou this scroll?"</p>

<p>As the prince spoke, he held to view the letter
which he had received from the princess, at the
hands of her father. "Do not avert thy head. Is
not the writing thine?"</p>

<p>"It is, my lord," replied Abassa, after a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Didst thou, fairest lady, of thine own free will
write these lines? or was it at the command of another?"</p>

<p>"Canst thou ask, Prince Giafar?" replied the
maiden. "Thou deemest but lightly of my pride,
if thou thinkest that, unadvised, nay, uncontrolled,
I sent those lines to thee. They were dictated by
one who has a right to guide my pen!"</p>

<p>"Thy father? I was sure of it," interrupted the
prince.</p>

<p>"Thou art right," rejoined the maiden. "Nothing 

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

but his rigorous command could have rendered 
me so forgetful of myself, so unmindful of the
pride, the honour of a maiden."</p>

<p>"Yet had thy heart no part in what is written
here? Stay&mdash;hear me for a moment. Thy father,
thou knowest, offers me thy hand. The treasure
is inestimable&mdash;its value cannot be told. To possess 
it there is no sacrifice that I would not make,
no danger that I would not dare. But I would
refuse even a boon so dear, unless of thine own
choice thou wilt bestow it upon thy slave. A life
of happiness were dearly purchased, by a single
sigh or tear from thee. Yet give me to know that
I have found favour in thine eyes, that in some
little part thy soul has prompted the lines here
written within this parchment; give me but to hope
this, and my happiness is sealed."</p>

<p>The princess trembled, but answered nothing.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest not, fairest princess, the power
thou hast over me. In visions of the night thou art
present to my senses, and through the day thine
image is ever near me. The pains of love of which
I have often heard, but doubtingly, I now know
to be realities; emotions that I once thought held
their existence but in the poet's fancy, are now
burning <i>here</i>."</p>

<p>As the prince said this, he placed his hand upon
his bosom. His words glowed with love and pathos, 
his voice trembled, and he pressed his suit in
a manner too impassioned to please the ears of
the inexperienced maiden. She was about to

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

leave him, when he exclaimed, "Turn not away&mdash;listen 
to me yet a moment&mdash;nay, I will not, then,
address thee in the language of passion, though 
were I thus to speak my words would breathe of
fire. If thou wilt pass the pleasant hours with one
who will be thy slave, if thou wilt reign queen of
my palace and of my heart, speak but the word,
and they are thine. Thou art skilled in all the
accomplishments that can adorn thy sex. Thou
art versed in the lore of the sage and of the poet.
If these pleasures can tempt thee, they shall all be
thine. Learning from all lands shall be brought
to us&mdash;the sweetest poets shall sing their lays.
Mansor and Isaac shall tune their sweet lutes, and
the rich voice of Mousali shall beguile the hours
away, if they should linger. Though bred to war,
I am not a stranger to those pleasures which thou
lovest so well, and thou wilt soften and refine me;
thou wilt assimilate me to thyself, and daily I shall
become more worthy of thee. In the winter thou
shalt reign in my palace, and no pomp or pleasure
which thou now enjoyest shall fail thee there. In
the warm summer thou mayst wander upon the
river's banks, and roam at will, through my spacious 
gardens that skirt its margin. I know they
are unworthy of thee. If I could offer thee this
world with its treasures, it were too poor a price
to give in exchange for thee. Yet reject me not,
for I offer to thee all."</p>

<p>Abassa spoke not. Her bosom heaved tumultuously, 
and one hand stole beneath her veil to wipe

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

away the tears that she felt trickling down her
cheeks. "Wherefore dost thou hesitate?" continued 
the impassioned Giafar, persuasively. "Reject
me not. Tell me that thou wilt be mine. Thou
wilt not? Frame but one single word. Light
of mine eyes! answer me, yes. Thou canst
easily speak it. Thou wilt not reply then&mdash;thou
wilt not!" exclaimed the prince, despairingly. "I
cannot resign thee thus. If not with words, tell
me with a look. If thou wilt accept me, if thou
wilt not make me wretched, look up upon thy slave,
turn but for a moment thine eyes upon him, and
let him live."</p>

<p>Her veil was partly drawn aside, and slowly
the beautiful princess turned her eyes upon him.
For a moment they dwelt, they reposed on his.
They were floating in tears, and though no other
feature of her face was distinctly visible, in their
sweet expression Giafar read all that he wished to
know. In that glance were visible, love, dependance, 
confidence, and a thousand feelings that
words well chosen and devised would have failed
as perfectly to express. In a moment her eyes
were again cast down, and her face covered completely 
with her veil. "I thank thee, Allah," exclaimed 
the vizier, tremulously, while he covered
his face with his caftan, to conceal the emotions
that were unmanning him.</p>

<p>Father Ibrahim had taken no part in this conversation, 
and had even withdrawn a few paces
that his presence might lay no restraint upon their

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

meeting, yet not to so great a distance as to render 
the interview strictly a private one. But it
had lasted longer, and was more free in its nature,
than custom permitted to the sexes, and he now
stepped forward to put an end to its privacy.
Abassa noticed the intention of the dervis, and
was instantly sensible of her error. "I will go,
father," she said. "Do not blame me&mdash;I have
erred, but it has been unthinkingly. Forget, my
lord, that thou has seen and spoken with me. Let
me not forfeit thine esteem&mdash;forget this casual
meeting, and when my father shall return, his will
shall in all things be mine."</p>

<p>"Forget it! now, by the right hand of our sacred 
Prophet! never can it pass from my remembrance. 
It has been the dearest moment of my
life, and death alone with its gathering shadows
can efface its memory. But thou hast erred in
nothing&mdash;thou hast done naught that thine own
father would not approve and sanction, he left
me as the guardian of his household, gave me
permission to see and speak at times, even with
thee, and with the liberty he failed not to give the
power to do so. Here is the proof that I deceive
thee not; with this talisman the doors even of the
harem open to me. Dost thou not know it?" As
Giafar said this he pointed to a ruby ring which
glittered upon his finger.</p>

<p>The princess gazed upon it intently, and the
sight of the jewel seemed to awaken in her bosom
strange and unusual emotion, in which Father

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

Ibrahim apparently participated. "That ring!
whence had you it, my lord?" she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

<p>"From thy father. He placed it in my hands
the evening preceding his departure for the army."</p>

<p>"Strange! Did he present you with this as with
an ordinary jewel, or was it reluctantly and with
fear? Never thought I to see that ring on the finger 
of another."</p>

<p>"The calif seemed impressed with a strange
dread as he consigned the jewel to my possession,
and shuddering told me that it had been recovered
in a mysterious manner from the waters of the Tigris. 
He spoke also of the being who brought his
lost treasure from the deep, and of words uttered
by him which still haunted his memory."</p>

<p>"Let me look upon the jewel," said the dervis.
The old man gazed upon it attentively, then turning 
to the princess, said, "How long is it since
the occurrence of this strange event?"</p>

<p>"It is about ten years since that memorable
day," replied the princess.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou not tell the tale as it occurred, my
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Most willingly," said Abassa. "Though but
a child then, yet I have heard my father oft tell the
story, and with an earnestness which has imprinted
it for ever upon my memory."</p>

<p>They reclined at the foot of a spreading palm
tree, and the princess commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'Tis very strange.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"The</span> ring which thou hast now upon thy finger,
Prince Giafar, was a gift from my grandfather
Mahadi to my father. It was a pledge of his succession 
to the throne, after the death of his brother
Hadi, to whom as eldest born the kingdom of right
descended. Mahadi died (peace be with him!),
and his eldest son succeeded to the crown. Yet
scarcely was he seated upon the throne, when, forgetful 
of his father's wishes, he intrigued to transfer 
the succession from my father to his son Giafar, 
who at that time was a mere infant. The
principal officers of the court were sounded and
gained. All, with the exception of thy venerable
father, were the ready and submissive instruments
of the tyrant's ambition. The venerable Iahia
alone remained firm. He was resolved to oppose
so flagrant a violation of the will of the deceased
calif, and as he held the office of vizier, and possessed 
reputation for great prudence and ability,
his opposition was for a long time successful. 'Act
not thus unjustly,' said thy father to the ambitious

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

calif, 'lest all Islam rise up against thee. The
people will not reverence a child even though he
be clothed with the mantle of the Prophet. One
who cannot pray in the mosque, and exhort the
Mussulmen to piety, who cannot lead our warriors
to battle, and our pilgrims to the sacred city,
merits not surely the title of Emirul Mummininn.*
Beware, lest in trying to place the sceptre in the
hands of thine offspring, it be wrested from thine
own grasp.' The firmness of thy father was for
a time sufficient to prevent the calif from openly
pursuing his purpose. He craftily assented to his
vizier's advice, and feigned to have banished from
his mind his unjust design.</p>

<p class="small">[*Commander of the Faithful.]</p>

<p>"Meanwhile my father's actions were closely
watched. His friends were withdrawn, one by
one, from about his person, and sent on various
pretexts abroad, and he was surrounded by the creatures 
of the calif's will. All offices and posts of
honour were denied him, neither was he allowed
admission into the army, lest he should gain in
a greater degree the affection of the soldiery, who
already loved him, and whom, at the early age of
nineteen, he had led to the walls of Constantinople.</p>

<p>"Yet all hope was not denied him. That sacred
jewel, which might purchase an emir's ransom,
was still in his possession. As often as he looked
upon it his courage revived; for in it be beheld,

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

as it were, a pledge that he should outlive the
snares with which his unnatural brother was surrounding 
him, and wear the crown which his father
destined for his brow. Often has my father assured 
me that the ruby has faded, and become dim,
upon the eve of misfortune, warning him of its
approach with unerring certainty; that in the
midst of gloom and peril, when his soul was sunk
in despondency, it has brightened in colour to his
fancy, inspiring him with fresh hopes and renewed
courage. He saw, as it were, the watchful eye of
his deceased father looking out from the gem, alternately 
cheering and warning him. It was his only
hope, his only solace.</p>

<p>"One day, while walking along the banks of the
river, musing on his fortunes, he perceived an
officer of the calif advancing towards him. He
was alone, and unarmed, and the stern Harthamah
who drew near was his enemy, and a fit instrument
for an errand of blood. The Tigris, too, rolled
sullenly by, ready to cover with its waters the foul
deed. He looked upon the ring&mdash;a dim mist obscured 
its brightness. Hope vanished, and death
seemed drawing nigh. Then it was that he made
that vow so well known and faithfully observed.
Prostrating his forehead in the wet sands of the
river's bank, he besought the aid of the great
Prophet of our faith, and vowed, that if the hand of
Allah should avert the present danger, he would
visit on foot the holy shrine at Mecca, and pay
there the devotion of a grateful heart. He arose,

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

strengthened and reassured. He cast a look upon
the jewel&mdash;it was bright and smiling; and he
awaited with firmness the purpose of the calif.</p>

<p>"Harthamah approached, and rudely demanded,
on the part of his master, the ring which my father
so highly valued. On hearing this unjust demand
his rage was unbounded, and bitterly upbraiding
his brother's tyranny, he drew the jewel from his
finger. It glittered for a moment in the eyes of
the expecting officer, and was then hurled far into
the midst of the river. After a day of fear and
anxiety my father retired to rest, but no sleep refreshed 
his senses. At the dead of night, he heard
a voice calling upon his name. The sound, fraught
with gloom and ill omened, filled his firm soul
with dread. It seemed the voice of Azrael when
he calls the soul away, and bids it depart from its
frail, its earthly tenement. Raising himself from
his couch, he snatched his scimitar which lay near,
and went forth. Upon the threshold he encountered 
Harthamah, who fell prostrate at his feet,
then rose, and led him in strange silence to the
calif's chamber. Here, having drawn aside the
curtains of the royal couch, he disclosed to him the
lifeless body of his brother. The hand of God had
stricken Hadi with death, and the mantle of the
Prophet fell upon the shoulders of my father."</p>

<p>"Allah ackbar! God is great! God is good!"
exclaimed the dervis and prince simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Go on, my child, thou hast yet more to say."</p>

<p>The recital of her father's danger and deliverance 

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

had so overpowered Abassa, that for a time
she was unable to proceed. In a few moments,
however, she subdued her emotion, and continued.</p>

<p>"No sooner was my father seated on the throne,
than his mind reverted to the ring. Inconsolable
for its loss, he invited, with promise of great reward, 
divers to repair from all parts of the kingdom 
to seek for his lost treasure. All were foiled
in their attempts; the most practised in the art
had been repeatedly unsuccessful, and the calif despaired 
of its recovery.</p>

<p>"At the close of one of those days which my
father was accustomed to spend with his courtiers
on the banks of the river, encouraging and rewarding 
new attempts, an old man presented himself,
and offered, with assurance of success, to dive for
the jewel. Wretched poverty seemed his lot. His
dress was tattered, his face and person blackened
and travel soiled, and he wore the cap and belt of
a miserable Giaour. My father gazed upon the
infidel, smiled scornfully, and replied,</p>

<p>" 'Thou wearest the garb of an accursed race.
Can good come from a source unholy? Canst
thou range the depths of these waters, and restore
to me a treasure sacred and long lost?'</p>

<p>" 'Doubt it not' said the Giaour. 'If the swift
stream has not hurried it far from hence, ere yon
sun shall set the jewel shall sparkle upon thy
finger.'</p>

<p>" 'But thy limbs are feeble, old man, and the
most skilful divers of the East have in vain essayed

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

the task. Thou canst not do this, save by magic
or some accursed art, and I warn thee, at peril of
thy life, beware! practise not in my presence thy
foul craft.'</p>

<p>" 'Fear not,' replied the infidel, with calmness,
'but cast this leaden circle far into the stream, as
near as thou well canst upon the spot where the
waters swallowed up thy treasure.'</p>

<p>"So saying, he placed in my father's hands a
ring of lead, which the calif for a moment scrutinized, 
to see if magical or cabalistic characters
were inscribed thereon, and then pronouncing
aloud one of the attributes of Allah, he cast it into
the Tigris. The stranger watched it as it fell, and
then, with a mighty bound, plunged into the stream.
The waters settled stilly over his head, and all
awaited in breathless silence his reappearance. A
few minutes elapsed, which suspense rendered
doubly long to the minds of the astonished spectators.</p>

<p>" ' 'Tis the work of Eblis!' exclaimed my father;
'what mortal could exist so long beneath the
waves?' As he spoke, a being arose from the
waters bearing the long-lost ring. His countenance 
was benign, his white hair fell down upon
his shoulders, and the waters seemed to open a way
before him as he moved along. Nay, smile not
so incredulously. I but tell the tale my father told
to me. He wore a robe of blue silk, the ordinary
habit of a dervis, yet encircling his waist was the
accursed belt, that declared him a worshipper, perhaps 

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

a spirit of the forbidden fire. Slowly and
majestically he drew near to where the calif stood,
while wondering at the change, all drew back as
he approached. Even my father was, as he has
since said, awed at his presence, and received the
ring at his hands in silence.</p>

<p>" 'It is the same,' he said at last, pressing it to his
lips and forehead. 'Strange being! by whatsoever 
power thou hast redeemed this treasure from
the waters, I will not question thee. From Allah I
receive it, who often performs the noblest works by
wicked hands. Thou wearest the badge of an unholy 
creed, a sect that I abhor, whose very name
I have hunted from the face of my kingdom, yet
for all this the favour which thou hast conferred
upon me is not lessened in mine eyes, and thy reward 
shall not be unworthy of it. Ask of me any
gift that as prince or pontiff I can rightfully bestow,
and it is thine.'</p>

<p>" 'Proud prince!' was the calm reply, 'I refuse
not thy boon. At an hour when thou lookest not
for me, I will be with thee and demand it. Yet ere
I depart, hear this counsel, if thou wilt hear aught
from the lips of a Giaour. <i>Beware of thy friends</i>, for
they alone will do thee mortal hurt. From thy
foes thou shalt reap honour, wealth, and power.
The arm of thy father's son has sought thy life;
the voice of an enemy called thee to the throne
left vacant by the death of thy treacherous brother;
the hand of a hated infidel has brought to thee a
treasure much valued, long despaired of. Thus

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

will it be ever with thee. Rejoice, stern monarch,
when thou shalt hear of battles, advancing foes,
and hostile banners, <i>here</i> thou shalt triumph, but
heed me when I say, beware of those most dear to
thee, and above all, give to no man, though thou
shouldst love him better than a brother, the ring
that an outcast has restored to thee.' So saying,
the old man turned, and departing from the crowd,
was soon lost to view."</p>

<p>When the princess had finished this recital, there
was silence, and all were busied with their musings
as they pondered on the strange tale. Fearful
forebodings fell upon the mind of the vizier; for in
the uncertain and obscure future he saw the possibility 
of the fulfilment of the Giaour's warning. He
trembled fearfully, yet he was able to conceal his
emotion, though he could not shake off those fears
which the preceding recital, like the raven's croak,
harsh and ill omened, had awakened in his bosom.
Gloom affected also the mind of the princess, for
though but half informed of her future lot, yet when
she called to mind the words of the infidel, sadness
darkened upon her soul and she wept. The sage
seemed to be interested, in an unusual degree, in
what he had heard, yet his countenance wore an
expression of unruffled serenity. He was the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>"My children, listen not to those who prophesy
of things to come, as though they were of the counsel 
of the Most High. Allah, and the angels to
whom he opens the book of his decrees, can alone

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

tell us of the future. Give no heed to those who
pretend to more than human knowledge. Falsehood 
is upon their lips, and deceit in their bosoms."</p>

<p>"I have learned from thee, father," replied the
princess, "to distrust all tales of magic and enchantment, 
yet I cannot tell how the events of that day
have been performed, save by some power that is
not of man."</p>

<p>"Why dost thou think thus?" said the dervis.
"The diver who seeks for pearls in the ocean might
with ease explore the channelled bosom of an inland 
stream, and reveal to light the secrets which
lie concealed within its depths. There is naught
of magic in this."</p>

<p>"True, father," replied the princess, "but the
mysterious change in the appearance of that man,
his knowledge of the past, and his strange warning
of the future, these, oh these, are what perplex my
mind."</p>

<p>"Be at rest, my daughter," said the dervis. "I
will ponder upon the matter, and it may be that
when we meet again I can explain even these wonders 
to thee."</p>

<p>Giafar listened anxiously to the endeavours of the
dervis to allay the princess's fears, but his face still
remained clouded with despondency, and when the
departure of Abassa left him alone with the recluse,
he exclaimed, "It is in vain, father; thou canst not
alter the decrees of fate. Though the soul of the
Grecian Aflatoun* spoke through thy lips, still there

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

if is mystery, a horror in this story, which thy words
cannot dispel. The Giaour spoke truth, and the
future conceals a danger that I dread to contemplate. 
Why did my master place this jewel in my
hands, or why, rather, did he offer to me a treasure
more precious than a universe of rubies, yet rife
with temptation, disobedience, and danger?"</p>

<p class="small">[*Plato.]</p>

<p>"Forbear, my lord! Start not at the phantoms
which thine own fears have conjured up. Where
threatens danger but in thine own fancy? Fortune
now looks upon thee smilingly; the ties with which
friendship has bound thee to the calif are to be
strengthened soon by one far nearer and more
binding. Thy very happiness, I fear, has turned
thy brain, and thou art framing sorrows from thine
own imaginings, since they exist not in reality."</p>

<p>"Sayst thou so?" replied the prince; "then
listen to me."</p>

<p>Giafar then related, in a few words, all the purpose 
and command of the calif in regard to his
union with his daughter. After listening attentively 
to his words, the countenance of the old man
drooped.</p>

<p>"I understand thee now," he said. "I see the
source of all thy fears. In truth, thou hast much
cause for them. Yet everything depends upon thy
firmness, and thou art not destitute of this. Hear
me. Prince Giafar; know thyself well, before it be
too late. Search what of resolution and self-control 
is in thy bosom; look well, too, at the strong
temptation that will assail thee, that will lead thee

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

to forfeit thine honour, and to break the faith
pledged to thy master. Let not the wild passion
of youth impel thee down a precipice, where happiness, 
life, and honour will be all ingulfed. Look
well at this, I beseech thee. If it were thou alone
who should incur this ruin, I would adjure thee
turn thy footsteps from the danger, for thy loss
would pour down sorrow upon mine old head.
But it is not for thee alone; those dearest to us
both must suffer if thou errest, and the sun of life
which with me has near gone down, must set in
gloom and sorrow."</p>

<p>Giafar's lips quivered with emotion, and his
frame heaved convulsively, as the firm earth is
shaken when the elements are roused which lie
pent up within its bosom.</p>

<p>"It is too late," he said. "I have accepted the
offer of the calif; our approaching nuptials have
been rumoured abroad, and now to retract would
bring upon my head my master's fierce displeasure. 
I cannot now retrace my steps, and I am
glad that it is thus. I would not alter my decision, 
and for worlds I would not again endure the
fierce strife of passion, the throes of agony, that
gave birth to a purpose so critical, so perilous.
Farewell."</p>

<p>"Stay with me, my son," said the dervis. "Let
me whisper to thee peace."</p>

<p>" 'Tis not the time now!" exclaimed the prince.
"In the whirlwind of my soul thy words would be
unheard, unheeded."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

<p>"Consolation he will not regard," said the old
man, gazing after him in sorrow; " 'tis lost upon
him. So is the sweet sound of the lute drowned
by the harsh clang of trumpets. How wonderful
are Heaven's ways!" he continued, as he returned
slowly to his cell. "I am like a child who has
wielded the spell of some dread magician, and
trembles at the lightning, and thunder, and darkness 
that gather and gleam around him, and the
wild forms which he has conjured up unwittingly
with imprudent hands."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">Oh, passing traitor! perjured and unjust!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his interview with Abassa at the cave of
the dervis, and the relation of the strange and
threatening tale which he had heard from her lips,
Giafar relaxed in some degree from that strict attention 
to the business of state, for which he had
been ever remarkable. His heart was filled with
the beauty of the princess; doubts and forebodings,
too, overshadowed his spirits, and rendered him
alike unmindful of the present, and fearful of the

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

future. He could not long conceal this remissness
from himself. He soon became sensible that for
many days he had too exclusively devoted his
time and thoughts to his own personal affairs, and
conscious of his error, he roused himself from inaction, 
and resolved to bend with more than ordinary
severity to those labours which duty to his master
called upon him to fulfil. On the evening of the
day upon which this purpose had been formed, and
in pursuance thereof, Giafar made a secret excursion 
through the city. He was habited like a merchant 
from a far country. A wide spreading turban
of foreign material and construction, a flowing robe
of the wool of Astracan, with trousers and sandals
equally suited to the character which he had assumed, 
effectually completed his disguise, and few
even of his nearest friends could, in his present
strange apparel, have recognised the vizier. He
was accompanied by a white attendant, and by
Mesrour, in the dress of an ordinary black slave.
They roamed on through the wide and magnificent
streets of the city, keeping close by the gardens
which lay along the Tigris. Passing first through
the most spacious and well-regulated portions of
the capital, and finding nothing to attract their attention, 
they crossed the bridge which connected
the opposite quarters of Bagdad. Proceeding onward 
down a retired street, they stopped before a
mansion well lighted, from which issued sounds of
merriment and festivity, somewhat restrained, indeed, 
yet at intervals breaking forth in a degree

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

louder than was consistent with concealment, if
such were indeed the purpose of those within.</p>

<p>"Revellers!" said the prince, as, after pausing
for a moment to listen, he moved onward in his
walk. "I will look in upon them as I return to
see that they are discreet in their mirth." They
had proceeded but a few paces, when sounds of
suppressed voices, and of footsteps advancing towards 
them, were heard. Time was scarcely allowed 
them to conceal themselves hastily behind a
projecting wall, ere a party of four or five men hurried 
by them, conversing earnestly yet in whispers.</p>

<p>"Thou art sure then, Amrou, that he will be
with us to-night?"</p>

<p>"He will not fail," was the reply. "Iahia Ben
Abdallah is not one to sleep till all his purpose be
accomplished."</p>

<p>"Were I not already thus deep in this matter,"
said a third&mdash;The rest was unheard, for by this
time they had passed on. Giafar remained eagerly 
watching their steps, until he saw them enter
the mansion which a moment before had attracted
his attention, and then ejaculated in a suppressed
but bitter tone, "Treason, by this hand&mdash;and from
that base slave! but follow&mdash;we will enter their
haunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, my lord!" said Mesrour; "first suffer
me to seek out a band of the city guards or to return 
to the palace and arm some of thy household.
Thrust not thyself, I beseech thee, into needless
peril."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

<p>"There must be no delay, Mesrour," exclaimed
the prince, pressing hastily onward; "every moment 
is precious while rebels are plotting treason
within these walls. Thou mightst give the alarm,
too, and thus frustrate my designs."</p>

<p>"If Iahia be indeed present there, he will not fail
to penetrate thy disguise. Nay, my lord, I must
still remonstrate against this reckless hazarding of
thy life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak not of it, Mesrour&mdash;it is forfeited already 
by my negligence and error. I must enter
this den of traitors, I must listen to their secret
counsels, discover all their hidden plans, and learn
upon what foreign aid they count, that they build
their hopes thus high. I will, however, render my
disguise more secure. Put off thy garments," he
continued, addressing the slave, "and do thou take
mine."</p>

<p>Giafar then clothed himself in the habit of the
slave, and blackened his face and arms with a mixture 
which he ordinarily used for that purpose,
saying, when he had completed his disguise, "I
can now, methinks, defy his scrutiny." He then
turned to the slave, who was by this time dressed
in the garb which his master had thrown off. "Go
forward," he said; "we will follow as thy slaves.
Enter yon mansion boldly, call thyself a merchant
from Moussul; say thou art lodged without the
city, and returning late hast found the gates closed
against thee, and knowest not where to past the
night. Yet speak to no one who does not question

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

thee. Stay&mdash;thou mayst seem to be drunken with
wine. They will think thy tale less strange, and
be themselves less guarded. They may not heed
thee; if so, do naught which may draw attention
towards thee, but conduct thyself in all things as
thou seest others. Be wary, yet fearless. Now
onward. Mesrour, follow thy master."</p>

<p>The slave listened attentively, and when Giafar
motioned him to proceed, led the way with a grave
and measured step, the prince and Mesrour following 
at a respectful interval, as befitted the characters 
they had assumed. When they reached the
mansion, they found the portal standing open, but
on entering, the inner gate proved to be fast locked.
While Giafar was meditating upon the means to
gain admission, they were again surprised by the
sound of approaching footsteps, and had scarce
time to retire within the recess between the inner
and the outer gates, when a second party entered.
This band was more numerous than the former,
and most of them seemed to have but recently
risen from a debauch, and were still under the
influence of the wine cup. On their entrance, they
brushed so near the person of the prince, that discovery 
seemed for the moment inevitable, and
Giafar's hand was upon the hilt of his scimitar. He
soon, however, withdrew it, for he saw that he
was still unobserved by the new comers, who
passed hastily on to the inner gate, which was unlocked 
by a key in the possession of one of their
number.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

<p>"Follow them closely&mdash;enter with them," whispered 
Giafar; and, obedient to his master's command, 
the slave pressed forward, Mesrour and the
prince keeping near his person. Mingling with
the party which was entering, they found their way
into a courtyard, agreeably ornamented with vases
of flowers and fountains. This they crossed, and
ascending a flight of steps, entered a door which
opened into an illuminated chamber, the light from
which, shining through the latticed windows, had
first arrested the attention of the prince in passing.</p>

<p>A carpet was spread upon the floor, around
which reclined or sat cross legged about a score of
revellers, as they seemed. Wine in crystal pitchers, 
and in gold and silver goblets, sparkled on the
board; sherbets likewise, and fruits, both fresh and
dried, were seen in abundance. At the upper end
of the table, if thus it might be called, sat one whom
Giafar recognised as having held a post of considerable 
importance at court, but of which he had
been deprived for some fault either real or supposed. 
His dress was rich and well arranged.
Manhood with him seemed striving against age.
The former predominated in the unquenched sparkling 
of his eye, and in the fresh hue which showed
itself high up upon his cheek, where a luxuriant
growth of beard permitted it to be seen; the latter
was visible in his furrowed brow, and in his beard,
which was of a silvery whiteness. From the attention 
which he seemed to be bestowing upon
those around him when Giafar entered, and from

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

the manner in which he received the new comers,
the prince held him to be the master of the house.
He gave them a warm welcome, yet hurriedly,
and with small ceremony, and they seated themselves 
promiscuously at the board, the slave taking
his place with the rest. The host then filled a
goblet with wine, and placed it to his lips, all bowing 
to him as he drank, and wishing him health, a
compliment which he returned by touching his
right temple with the fingers of his right hand, inclining 
his head at the same time with much gravity 
to the company. After the rest had also drank,
he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Yes, friends, ye are welcome&mdash;welcome, by
the beard of my grandfather! and the rather that
ye bring not Iahia with you to disturb our merriment."</p>

<p>"We thought to find him here, my lord," replied
one of the gravest of the party which had last entered. 
"We are here on business which nearly
concerns himself, and his presence is most necessary 
to our council."</p>

<p>"True, true," rejoined Mohalleb&mdash;thus was the
host called&mdash;"I spake not as altogether averse to
his coming. He shall be welcome; but in time&mdash;in 
time. A cup of wine or two were not amiss,
ere he comes to damp our festivity with his solemn
visage."</p>

<p>"I will reprove thee. Friend Mohalleb," said a
third, the suffused state of whose countenance contradicted 
the formal expression into which he had

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

constrained his features, and suited as ill with the
sentiments which he uttered&mdash;"in truth, I will reprove 
thee. Hast thou yet to learn that wine is
an abominable thing? And therein is our law
superior to the law either of Jew or Christian, and
the book in which we have received it more excellent 
than the writings of all the prophets which
have gone before, even as our Prophet, elect of
God, is more excellent than they. Besides, we
are here together to consult on matters of great
import."</p>

<p>"I value not thy words," rejoined the host, "neither 
do I see how a draught of wine should mar
prudent counsel. If we have serious and weighty
duties to perform, good wine will render them the
lighter to be borne, or make us rather the more
willing to bear them." While he was speaking, he
filled a goblet for himself, and another, which (glancing 
his eye at those around with a smile) he
placed before his prudent counsellor, saying, "Shall
accursed Giaours partake freely of Heaven's
bounty, and the true Moslem alone abstain?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" was the reply of the person thus
addressed, as with undisturbed solemnity he forthwith 
raised to his lips and drained the cup, then
wiping his beard with great gravity, after a deep
and long-drawn respiration, he proceeded&mdash;"God
forbid! I say not totally abstain, although it were
well that with the common sort, the herd of men,
such should be thought our doctrine. I would not
have thee think me rigid in this thing; nay, thou

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

shalt not misconceive me, good Mohalleb, I will fill
yet another cup with thee, rather than thou shouldst
hold me over rigorous as touching the wine. Come&mdash;To 
the noble Iahia Ben Abdallah, our rightful
calif."</p>

<p>None refused the pledge. It was drunk deeply
but in silence, as though reason had for a moment
hovered round the board, and whispered to some
how desperate, to all how hazardous was the cause
in which they had embarked.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by one who had not yet
spoken.</p>

<p>"How shall we profit by this expected change?
What shall we gain should we succeed in our purpose 
of dethroning the present monarch, and placing 
in his seat the noble Iahia?"</p>

<p>"A calif of the stem of Ali, and a rightful descendant 
of our holy Prophet," answered one, who
with a few others sat apart, and had steadily refused 
to join in the festivity which reigned around
the table.</p>

<p>"Yet there are many who think the house of
Abbas equally worthy," was the reply; "and, in
truth, by the decision of the sword, has Allah adjudged 
to that race the supremacy. But I speak
of gain&mdash;will our lives or our possessions be
safer?"</p>

<p>"Ay," interrupted the host, upon whose brain
the wine began to do its office, and whose speech
was becoming broken and interrupted&mdash;"ay," he

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

exclaimed, "or our harems more secure, or wine
freer to us than now?"</p>

<p>"Thinkest thou upon naught else, Mohalleb, and
with a beard as white as thine? Are there not
such things as honour and religion?"</p>

<p>"True," replied Mohalleb, laying one hand upon
his bosom, and with the other stroking his beard,
and raising his eyes to Heaven at the same time
with drunken gravity, "true&mdash;religion&mdash;the sacred
race of Ali&mdash;a cup of wine&mdash;let it be full," he continued, 
warmly, "a full cup to the true descendants 
of the Prophet, and may Allah confound the
house of Abbas. and all its adherents."</p>

<p>During this while Giafar had been anxiously
watching the demeanour of the pretended merchant, 
upon whose address and gravity depended,
in a great measure, the successful completion of
his design. He was aware that the slave knew of
wine only by the name, and from the frequency
and earnestness with which he drank, he feared
lest he might proceed to some extravagance which
should betray them. More than once, under the
pretext of assisting his supposed master, he took
the cup from his hands and placed it upon the
table, plucking him at the same time by the robe,
or intimating, by some secret gesture, that he
should moderate his draughts. The slave, however,
was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to comprehend 
these mute prohibitions. He was delighted
with the wine, and, despite his fears of his master's
displeasure, drank often and freely, until his brain

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

reeled, and, forgetful of his real character and situation, 
he enacted the part which had been assigned
him with a fidelity and truth which shut out all suspicion 
of its being a counterfeit. When the prince
refused to fill his cup, or filled it sparingly, he held
it forth to Mesrour without so much as speaking,
but with an air which of itself seemed to say,
"Fill full, slave," a command which, in conformity
with his assumed character, Mesrour could not
avoid executing.</p>

<p>But with the exception of some such exuberance
of manner, the slave had conducted himself with
considerable caution and dexterity. He had
strictly followed the counsel given him by his
master before they entered. He had spoken to
no one; he had imitated, as well as he was able,
the actions of those around him, and thus far without 
having drawn upon him the attention of any
one present. The last pledge, however, given by
the host, was of a character so disloyal and heretical, 
as to bewilder for a moment the already disturbed 
faculties of the slave. He hesitated to
drink, and did not recover himself so as to place
the goblet to his lips, until those around had finished
their wine. This delay quickly attracted the attention 
of Mohalleb, who, bending his eyes upon the
slave with all the steadiness which they were able
to assume, awaited the conclusion of his draught.
This the slave prolonged to the utmost, holding
the cup raised high to his face, concealing all its
features, excepting only the eyes, which, peering

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

from between the goblet and his overhanging turban, 
returned with equal gravity the gaze of the
host. Finding that delay was of no avail, and that
Mohalleb was not to be diverted from his scrutiny,
he slowly took the cup from his lips, and disclosed
the remainder of his countenance.</p>

<p>When Mohalleb saw a face entirely unknown
to him discovered by this action, he exclaimed, in
some wonder,</p>

<p>"Friend, how camest thou here? Who art
thou?"</p>

<p>"I am an honest man, my lord, and a good
Mussulman," said the slave.</p>

<p>" 'Tis well spoken," was the reply, "yet in
some degree indefinite. There be such things as
name, country, and calling. Answer, I pray thee,
as to these matters."</p>

<p>"My name is Ganem, or 'The Rich.' I am a
merchant, and from Moussul."</p>

<p>"And by what chance, Ganem, didst thou find
thy way hither?"</p>

<p>"I will tell thee, my lord," answered the slave,
giving way to his intoxication, and attempting neither 
to resist nor conceal the inroad which wine
was making upon his faculties&mdash;"I will tell thee.
I lodge without the city, my lord, and this day
visiting a merchant with whom I have dealings, I
dined with him. We drank wine together, as you
may see, in some quantity, too&mdash;we sat so long at
table that night came on suddenly&mdash;very suddenly.
I found the gates closed&mdash;lost my way&mdash;passed

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

your dwelling&mdash;saw it lighted&mdash;entered, as you
must be aware&mdash;and here I am."</p>

<p>"We have overlooked thee somewhat long.
Friend Ganem, and thou art therefore the more entitled 
to our present&mdash;particular attention. Those
stout blacks at thy shoulder&mdash;are they followers
of thine?"</p>

<p>"They are" was the consequential reply.
"Slaves&mdash;mute slaves&mdash;thou needst not question
them. Wonder not, my lord," he continued, with
more caution, and steadying to the utmost of his
power his swimming brain, "do not wonder, I
say, that a simple merchant should be thus attended.* 
At home I rank with the first of my
calling; and I swear to you, my lord, by the prophet 
Elias, that there are as many slaves, mutes
and eunuchs, white and black, in my abode, as there
are in the palace of your vizier."</p>

<p class="small">[*Mutes at this time were rarely to be met with, except in the
palaces of princes.]</p>

<p>"If thou speakest truth," answered Mohalleb,
"thou mayst aid us much in this enterprise, of
which thou hast heard us somewhat too freely discourse."</p>

<p>"Enterprise!" exclaimed the slave, with a vacant
stare; then shaking his head, he added, "I know
not of what you speak. But this I know, that you
are a glorious old man, and your wine is the best
I ever drank."</p>

<p>"The best!" rejoined Mohalleb. "Why, the

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

wine is well enough&mdash;but for a man of thy wealth
and rank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trifles&mdash;trifles," interrupted the slave, now
perfectly at his ease, "not worthy to be mentioned.
I certify it is the best. I swear it by the prophet
Elias&mdash;the best I ever tasted; and good reason,
too," he muttered to himself. "Your climate of
Bagdad here gives it a flavour ours hath not. As
to the enterprise you spoke of&mdash;be it what it may,
I will join you, were it but to prove how much I
prize and honour your unequalled hospitality."</p>

<p>Mohalleb bowed low, and replied,</p>

<p>"I will then at large recount it to you, bearing
well in mind that you are bound to us."</p>

<p>"Bound!" exclaimed the slave, with an assumption 
of infinite dignity, "I am bound to no man.
I would join with you in this matter, but it must
be under no constraint. God keep you, my
worthy friends. I will talk with you of this at
another time." So saying, as if to satisfy himself
that there was no hinderance to his departure, rather
than from any real desire to leave the company
where he had been so well received, he arose from
the table, and with an air of importance beckoning
his slaves to follow, proceeded with irregular steps
towards the door of the apartment. Perceiving,
however, that some present were about to prevent
his exit, he returned in time to the board, so that
his change of purpose seemed entirely voluntary.
"Thou hast mistaken me, my worthy host&mdash;I am

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

not of that sort&mdash;I will be bound to no man&mdash;always 
excepting my most noble master&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thy master!" exclaimed many voices. "Thou
art a cheat&mdash;an impostor. But now thou calledst
thyself a rich merchant from Moussul."</p>

<p>"And a merchant I am," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And hast a master?"</p>

<p>"In some sort I have, friends; yes, in truth, an
excellent master"&mdash;here he raised his face towards
heaven with a ludicrous expression of devotion,
his eyes twinkling as he spoke with wine and cunning&mdash;"a 
noble master, Allah above, who is the
master of us all."</p>

<p>"Allah kerim! God is merciful!" exclaimed
many, and a dull murmur was heard around the
board. Silence then followed, as though something 
discordant and out of tune had jarred upon
the feelings of all present.</p>

<p>This, however, the slave did not heed, but flourishing 
a well-filled goblet, the contents of which he
distributed in good measure upon the garments of
those nearest him, and upon his own, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"A generous and excellent master. A cup of
wine, friends, to his welfare and prosperity!"</p>

<p>At this proposal, so glaringly impious as it
seemed, a tumult was raised on every side.</p>

<p>"Away with the wretch! beat the knave into
the street!" were heard resounding from all parts
of the table.</p>

<p>Some were about to lay hands on the pretended
merchant to thrust him forth from the apartment,

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

and, for a moment, Giafar had hopes that the craft
or carelessness of the slave, for he knew not which
to think it, would procure for him a safe retreat.
But the voice of Mohalleb, who seemed well
pleased with the convivial qualities of his guest,
was heard crying loudly,</p>

<p>"Touch him not. It was an ill-conceived and
hastily uttered jest. I would see more of him."</p>

<p>Still, many were clamorous for his expulsion,
many for confining him in a remote apartment
until morning. At this moment, while the tumult
was at its height, a heavy step was heard slowly
and deliberately ascending the steps without. All
were in an instant hushed, and Iahia Ben Abdallah
entered the apartment.</p>

<p>A frown of impatient anger was upon his furrowed 
brow, and a smile of scorn curled his lip as
he advanced. He cast a glance at their irregular
and disordered mirth, and then exclaimed bitterly,
yet in a suppressed voice,</p>

<p>"Fools! meet instruments ye are for a work
like mine! Is the prize already ours, that ye feast
thus and shout aloud? Think ye if the calif is
absent that his minion sleeps?"</p>

<p>Giafar's heart beat violently within his bosom as
he heard these words, sending the hot blood up to
his cheek and brow so forcibly, that its crimson
was visible even through his dark disguise. Other
signs of emotion, also, he could not for the moment
control. His lips were compressed, his eyes
flashed forth from beneath brows that for an instant 

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

frowned, and then his countenance became
cold, calm, and impassive. His hand, which had
sought hurriedly the hilt of his scimitar, was as
quickly withdrawn, and subduing the air of energy
and dignity that was rising in his frame, he composed 
himself into the humble and attentive attitude
which befitted his disguise.</p>

<p>"And why," proceeded Iahia, "when we should
lurk like owls in darkness, would ye make broad
day even of night?" As he said this he passed
around the apartment, extinguishing one by one
the lamps which hung suspended from the ceilings
lighting, ere he came to the last, a small taper,
which he placed upon the carpet, about which the
guests were seated.</p>

<p>"Thou art thyself an owl," exclaimed Mohalleb. 
"But let a draught of wine wash this humour
from thy brain."</p>

<p>Iahia waved aside the proffered goblet, with an
exclamation which denoted his aversion to the unhallowed 
draught, and replied,</p>

<p>"Why wilt thou, Mohalleb, thus peril our safety?
We are upon the eve of success. The calif absent&mdash;the 
flower of the army with him&mdash;our succours 
from Bassora hourly expected&mdash;yet one rash
act or word, nay, the very glare of yon lamps
which I have just extinguished, should it meet suspicious 
eyes, would lead to our destruction."</p>

<p>"Thy wisdom oversteps itself," was the reply.
"But a moment since we were a company of
friends, gayly met together, and might defy the

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

scrutiny of prince or officer; now, shrouded in
darkness, we look indeed like what we are. Light
up, light up, and then to council if thou wilt."</p>

<p>"That thou mayst see the better to fill thy
goblet?"</p>

<p>"Speak not thus scornfully, Iahia. This night's
revel has been worth much to us&mdash;more than a
score wasted in dry deliberation. It has gained us
a worthy accession to our party. Look you&mdash;him
yonder with the slaves. Nay, do not frown. If you
like him not, he is still here," and he approached his
hand to his scimitar with a significant gesture.</p>

<p>"Thou canst not have done this!" exclaimed
Iahia, as, seizing the lamp, he passed round the
table to where the supposed merchant was seated,
and scanned his features with hurried, yet accurate
minuteness. He then proceeded to subject the pretended 
slave to the same scrutiny, saying as he did
so, "This passes ordinary folly. I tell thee, Mohalleb, 
the Vizier Giafar is abroad to-night." At
this moment the lamp which he held threw its faint
light upon the prince's form and features.</p>

<p>Iahia turned pale, stepped backward a pace or
two, and then, exclaiming, "By Allah! he is here,"
drew his scimitar.</p>

<p>That of the prince gleamed in air as quickly as
though lightning had left the scabbard at his side.
Mesrour also drew his blade, and the slave, shaking
off as he best could the fumes of the wine which he
had drunk, bared his weapon and ranged himself
at their side. But they were fearfully outnumbered.

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

A score of scimitars flashed from their sheaths,
and a crowd of hostile features and strong frames
arrayed themselves before them, and on either side.</p>

<p>" 'Tis well!" exclaimed Iahia, fiercely, as he
signed his followers to stay their hands, and turned
the point of his own weapon towards the earth;
"Giafar al Barmeki, thou art mine!"</p>

<p>"Say rather thou art mine, false slave!" rejoined
the prince, with an air of immeasurable dignity, and
with a confidence of tone and manner, which gave
him a momentary ascendency over his foes. Then
turning to those who were confronting him, he exclaimed,
"In the name of the Calif Haroun al Raschid, 
I here offer a free pardon to all who will throw
down their arms, save only to the traitor, Iahia
Ben Abdallah, and the five chiefs and authors of
this conspiracy. How, Moslems! do ye hesitate?"
he continued, as he noticed the doubt and irresolution 
which was visible in the faces of all round.</p>

<p>" 'Tis but in wonder at thy strange presumption," 
replied Iahia, scornfully. "Have you no
answer, friends, to this lordly proffer?" It was
heard in a tumultuous acclamation, "Long live
Iahia Ben Abdallah, our noble and rightful calif!"</p>

<p>"Thou hearest, prince," continued Iahia; "nor
is this all: at the war cry of my house a thousand
scimitars would start up to execute my bidding.
Thou canst not now escape me. Yet listen to my
words. I hate thee, Giafar&mdash;first, for thy fidelity
to a tyrant whom I abhor&mdash;next, that I have felt
thy mercy&mdash;thou hast seen me grovelling at thy

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

feet." An expression of the bitterest enmity enwrapped 
his features as he thus spoke, and more
than once it seemed as if, impelled by the violence
of his passions, he would again precipitate himself
upon the prince in combat. He controlled himself,
however, and continued, "Yet, deeply as I hate thee,
with tenfold bitterness do I loathe the relentless
master whom thou servest. More would I give
to hurl him from his throne, than to sate my vengeance 
with a thousand lives like thine. Aid me
to do this, as with ease thou mayst, and thou shall
live&mdash;nay, more, receive my gratitude and thanks."</p>

<p>"Thy gratitude! thy thanks!&mdash;have I not known
them? and thinkest thou that to gain these, or to
lengthen out by a few days a shameless life, I would
join thee in thine unhallowed purpose to dethrone
the calif?"</p>

<p>"I look not for this&mdash;I know thee better, Giafar,"
was the reply. "Yet something thou canst do&mdash;something 
which thou shouldst deem an easy purchase 
of thy life."</p>

<p>"Speak on, I will listen, though never came
aught but baseness from thy vile lips; yet quickly,
a traitor's breath is poison to me."</p>

<p>"To-morrow at dawn of day I shall unfurl my
standard in the city. 'Tis something premature,
three days would bring us valuable succours, but
it may not be helped. Even thy death would not
now conceal our purpose&mdash;rather would it be the
signal for a vigilant search throughout Bagdad,
which we should be ill able to elude. Deliver,

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

then, this night into my hands the keys of that
quarter of the palace which contains thy master's
treasure, his jewels, the sacred relics of the Prophet,
all indeed which may influence the minds of Mussulmen 
in our behalf. Do this, and thou art safe.
Refuse, and thou hast seen thy last sun."</p>

<p>"Were I willing thus to aid thee, it would avail
nothing," replied the prince, affecting a hesitation
which he did not feel. "Those keys are in the
keeping of my father."</p>

<p>"Send for them, then. A single line written
with importunity and as in haste, with some sure
token, would place them in thy hands."</p>

<p>"It would&mdash;it would." He placed his hand upon
his brow, and stood for a moment as though in deep
meditation, and then added, "Thou dost promise
for this, to spare the lives of my attendants and mine
own?"</p>

<p>"I promise it," said Iahia.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou swear it?"</p>

<p>"I swear it," was the treacherous reply.</p>

<p>"Be it so, then&mdash;give me writing materials. I
would yet keep my life, were it but to be revenged
on thee."</p>

<p>A piece of parchment was then given him, with
an ink horn, and a reed cut for the purpose, and
Giafar wrote as follows: "From Giafar Ben Iahia
ben Khaled to his beloved father. Thy son hath
instant need of the keys which unlock the treasure
chamber of the calif. They are, as thou well
knowest, in the fourth compartment of the secret

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

cabinet. I have sudden and especial use for them.
Neither mistake nor fail. Place them in the hands
of the bearer, who will deliver to thee my signet in
token that thou mayst confide in him. Thou knowest
the ring. Fail not&mdash;life hangs upon the issue."</p>

<p>He then gave the letter to Iahia, who examined
it with care to see if there were any secret writing
thereon. Satisfied of this, he returned it to the
prince, who sealed it with his signet, then taking
unobserved the ruby of the calif from his finger, he
placed it in the hands of the slave whom Iahia had
chosen for his courage and fidelity to be the bearer
of the message, saying, "Show this to my father,
and thy mission will not fail."</p>

<p>"Should it, thy life is forfeit," said Iahia. " 'Tis
now scarce the middle watch of the night. When
the next hour shall have passed, if this errand be
not accomplished, then thou diest. And be thou
faithful and wary," he continued to the slave, "so
shalt thou meet with thy reward." Having thus
spoken, he sped the messenger upon his errand.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Tis answered&mdash;"Well ye speed, my gallant crew!
Why did I doubt their quickness of career!"</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Byron</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean while, Iahia al Barmeki was awaiting 
at his palace the return of Giafar from his nocturnal 
and, as it chanced this night, his perilous
wanderings. The stay of the prince was more prolonged 
than ordinary, and fears for his welfare,
vague and inexplicable, yet constantly recurring,
found their way per force into the old man's bosom.
His anxiety had reached its height, and he was
about to send forth some of his household to
bring him news of his son, when a knocking was
heard at the door of the apartment where he was
sitting. At Iahia's bidding one of his slaves entered,
and informed him that "a messenger waited without
who desired to speak to my lord in person."</p>

<p>"Send him quickly hither," exclaimed Iahia, in
an unsteady voice. The slave retired, and returning 
presently, ushered in the bearer of the prince's
letter.</p>

<p>It required all the old man's firmness to avoid
showing unusual and unmeet agitation, as, having
received it from the hands of the messenger, he

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

broke the seal of the missive. The hour so untimely&mdash;the 
slave unknown to him&mdash;there was
something mysterious, too, in his silent yet bold
bearing. He glanced at the superscription; it was
in the handwriting of his son, and the impress upon
the seal was that of his signet. He opened the letter
and perused it in silence. As he read, the face of
the old man became whiter even than age had made
it. "In the name of Allah! what means this?" he
exclaimed. "The keys of the calif's treasure chamber&mdash;and 
at this hour! 'They are, as thou well
knowest,' " he continued, reading, " 'in the fourth
compartment of the secret cabinet.' 'Tis there I
keep the key of mine own private armory." His eye
here rested upon the paper with agaze the keenest
and most intense, as though he would gather some
hidden, secret meaning from the lines thereon inscribed. 
" 'Tis of this, then, that he has sudden
need&mdash;I cannot mistake. 'Place them in the hands
of the bearer, who will deliver to thee my signet in
token that thou mayst confide in him.' Where is
this token?" he continued, turning to the messenger.</p>

<p>The slave produced the ring which Giafar had
given him; it was not the signet of the prince.
Iahia knew it well, and the sight seemed to have
banished all fear as well as doubt from his mind.
" 'Tis well!" he exclaimed, in a tone of perfect composure. 
"They shall be sent him; yet where left
you the prince?"</p>

<p>"Will my lord pardon his slave? I should but
disobey thy son's commands to answer. It was
his wish to keep his purpose secret."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

<p>"Who were with him?"</p>

<p>"Friends, my lord. I can say no more than this."</p>

<p>"Art thou sure that friends were with him?"
said Iahia, bending his eyes steadily upon the slave.</p>

<p>"They seemed such, my lord," was the unmoved
reply.</p>

<p>Questioning was useless. Sensible of this, Iahia
clapped his hands thrice violently together, and
obedient to the signal, four slaves hastened into his
presence. "Zeyn," he said, addressing one of their
number, "see that my household are under arms
and in waiting;" to another, "See thou that the
guard of the calif's palace be collected, and hold
them in readiness for my commands. Declare
now," exclaimed Iahia, turning sternly to the slave
before him, "declare where thou last sawest the
vizier, or thou diest quickly."</p>

<p>"My lips are sealed even by the prince's own
command," was the resolute reply.</p>

<p>"Thou liest, wretch!" thundered forth the old
man, and then by a sign he directed the slaves to
seize him. They obeyed, and having bound his
arms with a silken cord which they wore at the
girdle, they passed another about his neck, each
grasping one extremity thereof, and then like statues 
awaited the further bidding of their master.
"Answer now," said Iahia&mdash;"where did you leave
the prince?"</p>

<p>The slave answered not.</p>

<p>"Speak! there is a moment left thee."</p>

<p>The slave kept a firm silence.</p>

<p>Though scarce a perceptible motion escaped the

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

old man, yet the silent sentence went forth, and in
a moment the features of the victim were suffused
with red, now empurpled, now darkly livid. At
this instant, a convulsive motion of the lips, caused
apparently by a faint attempt at speech, caught the
attention of Iahia, and in hope, he motioned the
executioners to intermit their dreadful office.</p>

<p>A few moments were afforded the slave to regain
his power of utterance, and looking alternately at
the grim forms which stood on either side, he faintly
and slowly spoke. "Stay their hands, my lord,
until thou hast heard me. The prince, thy son,
is now at the mercy of his deadliest foe. Yet thou
mayst save him, if thou wilt. Send but the keys
of the treasure chamber by my hands to those who
hold him in their power, and he is safe."</p>

<p>"Life and liberty shall be thine, if thou wilt lead
me to him," said Iahia.</p>

<p>"Mine errand must be accomplished, or he dies."</p>

<p>"Wealth to crown all thy wishes," uttered the
trembling father.</p>

<p>A smile was the sole reply.</p>

<p>"Prophet of God, look down upon him!" exclaimed 
the old man, summoning all his firmness;
but ere he had given the fatal signal, the slave again
spoke.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou the hour, my lord?"</p>

<p>"The first watch of the morning is just at hand."</p>

<p>A wild gleam of triumph and ferocity lighted up
the features of the slave, as he exclaimed, "So soon!
Old man, thine aid will come too late!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

<p>"Away with him!" exclaimed Iahia, and in a
moment the executioners had seized upon their
victim, and the unhappy wretch, struggling and
blackening in the throes of death, was hurried from
the apartment.</p>

<p>"Allah in mercy preserve him! Yet it cannot
be. I am a child to be thus ruffled by the malice
of a slave. Hear me," continued Iahia, turning to
his attendants, who had by this time returned to
receive his further commands, and as he spoke,
firmness and self-possession usurped in his bosom
the place of trembling agitation. "Hear me&mdash;the
prince, my son, is in the power of foes, and I know
not where. Divide the slaves of my house and
the palace guard into bands of five men, and disperse 
them widely throughout Bagdad. Search
first the dwelling of Iahia Ben Abdallah, and the
quarter of the city beyond the bridge. Speak not
as ye traverse the streets, but let those who first
find the vizier light their torches, and shout, 'Allah
for the house of Abbas!' then enter to his aid.
When that cry is heard, let all hasten thitherward;
the blaze of the torches will guide you. But utter
not a sound, nor fire a torch until ye shall have
gained the spot where he is in person, then let their
flame reach Heaven, and cry, 'Allah for the house
of Abbas!'&mdash;cry loudly, as though the last trump
were sounding&mdash;'Allah for the house of Abbas!' "
here the old man raised his voice unconsciously
into a loud and echoing shout. "Ye have heard.
Away! away! Zeyn," he added, as the last of their

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

number was hurrying from his presence, "hold!
I will go with thee and thy band&mdash;yet no&mdash;these
old limbs&mdash;speed! speed!" and following hastily,
Iahia left the palace.</p>

<p>We must now return to the abode of Mohalleb.
The hour had wellnigh passed; the slave had
not yet returned who bore the letter of the
prince to his father, and Giafar's situation was
becoming every moment more perilous. Still,
hope was warm within his bosom. It was mingled,
however, with a full sense of his danger. He was
surrounded by fierce foes, imprisoned in a retired
dwelling, far from all aid, or, at least, unable to
warn his friends of his peril. His courage, however, 
did not desert him; of all present, he alone,
the threatened victim, seemed to retain his confidence 
and composure. Upon the faces of the conspirators 
sat signs of distrust and fear. Now and
then recourse was had to the wine cup, and occasionally 
a jest or laugh was attempted, but in vain;
they seemed in discordance with the chill stillness
that reigned, which, failing to dispel, they rendered
the more gloomy and foreboding.</p>

<p>"Our message has failed," said Iahia, at last,
breaking the silence. "Prince, thou hast deceived
us. Thine hour is come!"</p>

<p>"Patience yet for a while, Iahia," replied the
prince, without emotion. "The errand, as I think,
will not fail."</p>

<p>"The time must be short, or even its success
will not avail to save thee," was the answer.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

<p>Silence and expectation breathless and intense
now followed. Iahia sat stern and motionless.
Giafar, apparently calm, but with the most anxious
interest, awaited each moment what the next might
produce.</p>

<p>At last his fierce enemy arose, and turning, addressed 
his followers: "Our purpose has miscarried. 
Amrou, take with thee five men, and proceed
carefully through the streets of the city towards
the palace of the Barmecides. See if aught is stirring 
in that quarter, and bring us news of our messenger 
if thou canst. Avoid the guard&mdash;be wary
and speedy. And do ye, Selim and Youssouf, go
forth and arouse our friends. Let them arm as for
the field. Tell them to awake if they would see
the dawn." Then with a fiendish frown, and an
expression of despairing malice, he exclaimed&mdash;"But 
these at least are our victims," and in an instant 
his blade clashed against that of the prince.</p>

<p>Blows were exchanged with the rapidity of
lightning, and before the followers of Iahia could
mingle in the combat, the scimitar of Giafar beating 
down and riving in pieces the blade of his antagonist, 
had descended with fearful violence upon
his turban, cleaving it in twain, and inflicting a
deep and stunning wound upon his bare brow.
Ere he could repeat the blow, numbers interposed
to the rescue of their chief, and Giafar and his followers 
beheld themselves hemmed in by a dense
circle of fierce and skilful foes. Yet bravely was
the contest maintained. Scarce a moment had

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

passed ere Mesrour had cut down two who pressed
upon him closest, and the slave, though bleeding
from various wounds, held his opponents manfully
at bay.</p>

<p>The prince's uncommon strength, and his unequalled 
dexterity in the use of his weapon, had
kept him as yet unharmed, notwithstanding he was
the chief object of attack. All shrank back from
the deadly sweep of his scimitar, as though fate
descended upon its edge, and for a time it seemed
as if with the might of his single arm he could extricate 
himself from the dangers which were gathered 
around him. But they crowded in fast and
thick, and though a flood of gore, though many
fallen, both wounded and dead, bore terrible evidence 
to the work which his hand had wrought,
his enemies were still unwavering. If, at times,
they retired from his arm, it was only to return to
the attack with violence increased and numbers
undiminished.</p>

<p>Mesrour had now fallen, struck down by the
hand of Mohalleb, and the slave, though he drew
closer to his master, bestriding the fallen eunuch,
and maintaining an unbroken front to their antagonists, 
was evidently scarce able to wield his scimitar. 
Giafar's only hope was succour, his sole
thought but to prolong the contest. He now put
forth his strength more sparingly, content to repel
the assaults of his foes, without striving to deal
back the blows which were aimed at him from
every side. At times, it is true, when he found

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

the traitor Iahia within his reach, he could not refrain, 
he could not withhold his arm from assailing
him, but in vain; the stroke fell upon the body of
some faithful follower, who averted and received
the death intended for his master. But his enemies
now surround him, save that he has placed his back
against the wainscoting of the apartment, for the
slave has just fallen at his feet. He is deeply
wounded&mdash;his strength fails&mdash;he still resists, but
'tis vain! the combat is hopeless. Hark&mdash;a sound&mdash;'twas 
the sighing of the wind, or the distant watch
of the city&mdash;no&mdash;'tis the tramp of feet, remote, yet
fast approaching. His enemies heed it not, they
are too eager for their prey.</p>

<p>"Thou art mine!" shouted the fierce Iahia.</p>

<p>"Son of the tomb, thou liest!" responded Giafar,
as fiercely and triumphantly, for the sound of footsteps 
was now distinctly heard advancing. Despair's 
cold hand is withdrawn. Hope nerves him.
He waves his arm with a strength somewhat like
his own. The light gleaming steel flashes around
the hostile circle that environs him&mdash;that circle is
broken&mdash;it is swept down&mdash;no, two have fallen&mdash;one, 
a headless trunk&mdash;the other cloven to the
waist by that resistless blow; the rest have borne
back from its might. The trampling is nearer&mdash;it
is here&mdash;it is just without. The door opens. "Ye
have come in time!" shouted the prince, in thrilling
and widely spreading accents. They enter. Allah
in heaven! 'tis Amrou with his men!</p>

<p>But they enter confusedly, and in disarray, and

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

there is blood upon the garments of the foremost.
The shout of derisive triumph which comes from
his foes is answered and drowned by an echoing
cry without&mdash;"Allah for the house of Abbas!"
Torches throw their blaze through the latticed
windows&mdash;that cry is again sounded, and following
close upon Amrou and his retreating band, four
of the trustiest of his household enter impetuously,
and bearing back all resistance, range themselves
at the prince's side.</p>

<p>" 'Tis bravely done, and in time," he exclaimed,
in tones of exulting approbation. "I was sure&mdash;"
and the combat was furiously restored. Still they
are too few. The foe again closes upon them.
That little band receives them with unblenching
firmness; their scimitars are drenched with the
blood of their enemies, and their own is dripping
from those hostile blades. They stand like a rock&mdash;but 
as amid a tempest of ceaseless and fiercely
coming waves. The inequality in numbers, however, 
now fast diminishes, for each moment the
shouting of those without is heard anew, the torches
burn higher and brighter, and fresh slaves, singly
and in bands, rush in to the rescue of their master.
The rebels fight with the resolution of despair, but
they are unable to withstand the daring and indignant 
courage of their opponents, and in their turn
are beaten backward.</p>

<p>"Iahia," said Mohalleb, who had this night shown
himself an approved soldier, scarce intermitting, as
he spoke, the deadly work in which he was engaged, 
"our men give way. Withdraw thyself

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

from the fight. The hour is come. Thou must
sleep this night in a monarch's palace or in thy
tomb. Withdraw, and array our friends in the
streets. Thou wilt do well likewise to clothe thyself 
in armour," he continued, more careful of the
safety of his chief than of his own. "Away!
when all is in readiness raise the war cry of thy
house&mdash;at that signal I will join thee without."</p>

<p>"Canst thou hold thyself here yet for a while?"</p>

<p>"Fear me not. I will not move from the spot
which my feet now cover, save to go forward, until
thou shalt give the word."</p>

<p>"Be it so," was the reply; and Iahia, extricating
himself from the fray, disappeared by an inner
door from the chamber. Mohalleb could not,
however, make good his boast. Scarce had Iahia
left the apartment, when the arm of Giafar clove
him to the earth. Seeing him fall, his followers,
after a short and wavering resistance, fled on all
sides; some by the numerous doors which opened
into various portions of the building, others leaping
from the low windows into the court, whence they
found their way into the street.</p>

<p>"Follow the rebels," exclaimed the prince; "yet
not too far," and as his men vanished in the pursuit, 
he sank down upon the divan, breathing heavily 
and exhausted; overcome in part with fatigue,
and in part by the violence of his emotions.</p>

<p>"In the name of Allah, what means this tumult?"
exclaimed his father, who at that moment burst
into the apartment, and rushed forward to the
prince. "Art thou alive, my son?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

<p>"Alive and unhurt, my father," answered Giafar,
raising his head, but again burying it in the old
man's bosom, as he drooped thereon, embracing
him, "though hard pressed by the slaves. Thou
didst not fail," he continued, again lifting up his
face and smiling, though with an expression of
deep emotion&mdash;"I should have known it&mdash;I was a
fool to fear."</p>

<p>"But thou art faint and wounded&mdash;this blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not mine," replied the prince. "A slight
hurt," he added, as he wiped away the red blood,
yet still felt it oozing forth from a deep wound in
his neck, " 'tis nothing. Mesrour has fared worse;
yonder he lies, sore wounded, yet alive. Let him
be seen to without delay. A cup of sherbet. I
am wearied with keeping the knaves at bay," and
again he sank back upon the divan, half supporting
himself against the bosom of his father. It was
brought him. He drained it at a draught, and
exclaimed to the attendant into whose hands he
placed the empty goblet, "Speed thou to the
palace and lead down the soldiery."</p>

<p>"They are here already, my lord."</p>

<p>"Bring hither, then, my horse. Quickly!
away!"</p>

<p>"But thou hast not told me," exclaimed his
father, "what means this peril. Whence comes
it?"</p>

<p>"Treason is on foot, and this night shakes its
standard over the city. Iahia Ben Abdallah and
his followers are in arms. But 'tis no time for

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

words. Within the hour they will be battling with
us like fiends in his behalf. Question me not, my
father, but descend thou into the street, and keep
our men back from the pursuit. Let them move
slowly onward. We know not yet the number of
our foes. Nay, do not heed me. In a moment I
shall be with you."</p>

<p>Reposing for an instant after their departure,
Giafar quaffed again a goblet of sherbet, and having
hastily stanched the blood which still flowed from
his wound, he proceeded into the street. When
there, he found the guard of the palace mounted
and drawn up in order, and a portion of the calif's
household and his own on foot. Placing himself at
the head of the latter, and commanding the horsemen 
to follow in close array, he hastened onward.
The noise of the strife was heard in the distant
streets, and seemed approaching. Pressing forward 
with as much rapidity as was consistent with
the regularity of their march, they soon met with
parties of their own men retreating; farther on,
some were still engaged, as it seemed, in a most
unequal contest, and hurrying to their aid, they
found themselves in front of a numerous and well-ordered 
band of foes.</p>

<p>The encounter was fierce and desperate. Many
fell on both sides, swept down by the edge of scimitar, 
wounded with steel-beaded jerrid, or pierced
through with long lances. Yet their places were
as fast supplied, and the fray continued unabated.
The number of the rebels was every moment increasing. 

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

Iahia appeared not among the combatants, 
but was actively engaged in summoning his
followers. As they assembled, he arrayed them
in small bands, and placing them under the command 
of some trusty officer, despatched them into
the fight. Neither side gave way. A surprising
courage and resolution seemed to animate both
parties, and for a long time the issue appeared uncertain. 
Giafar, though he mingled occasionally
in the battle, watched its tide with the eye of
a chief, and at the moment when it raged the fiercest, 
ordered a body of horsemen to fetch a circuit
around an adjacent street, and assail their enemies
unexpectedly from behind. This first caused them
to waver. The prince perceived their confusion;
he heard the shout of the horsemen as they made
the onset, and at the same moment leading on his
followers, they attacked their opponents with irresistible 
fury. The rebels were shaken; they rallied; 
they again gave way, and the tumult in their
rear increasing their fears and disorder, they were
borne backward, yielding at first reluctantly, step
by step, until at last they were driven rapidly down
the streets of the city.</p>

<p>"My horse!" exclaimed the prince, as he saw a
slave approaching with his favourite steed&mdash;"my
horse! these dogs are swift of foot." Then mounting, 
he ordered the footmen to divide their ranks,
thus opening a passage, through which, heading
the guard of the palace, he assailed at full speed
the retreating enemy.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

<p>Naught can describe the tumult which ensued.
The darkness and the gleaming of torches, the
trampling of horse, the clash of scimitars as they
rang against each other, the groans of those who
fell wounded and trodden down in the press, the
cries of each party as they invoked the aid of Allah&mdash;a 
scene like this memory alone can recall, and
the imagination picture. None asked for mercy,
none granted it. Passions darker than the night,
and wilder than its strife, were careering over the
battle; citizens were foes, and brothers encountering 
fiends. Mingled together in a confused tide,
friends and foemen, hoarsely shouting, grappling
in deadly strife, falling and pressing onward, pursuers 
and pursued, dyed all in blood, swept down
the streets towards the gates of the city.</p>

<p>Here the rebels held themselves for a while, and
the battle was waged fiercely anew. In front of
his men, mounted on a steed of perfect blackness,
and arrayed in a slave's disguise, the prince carried 
havoc wherever he turned his blade. He
seemed an avenging spirit, or some fiend of darkness, 
scattering death abroad with a familiar hand;
none dared encounter him, but as he spurred forward, 
all gave way before him. Many a torch
was held aloft by his followers, that they might
discover the fortune or the bearing of their leader.
At times the glare would reveal him bounding
amid the foe, and bearing back the throng as he
waved his scimitar streaming with red blood, in
the unequal light thus thrown upon him&mdash;at times,

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

bending forward upon his saddle, his foot, incased
in its sandal, resting far backward upon the broad
stirrup, while his steed seemed to leap into the air,
and stooping his turbaned head even below the
mane of the charger which so nobly bore him, as
he dealt a blow against a foeman. Rarely did it
fail of a victim; and each time that an enemy fell
beneath his arm, Giafar's voice was heard exclaiming, 
"Allah ackbar! God is victorious!" Often
was that thrilling cry echoed on the night air, and
as often his followers knew that a rebel had bit the
dust. The contest at the gates was sharp, yet
soon decided. A furious charge upon the foe,
bravely repelled, an onset renewed, a moment of
bloody strife, then a wavering, a yielding, and the
current poured forth from the city, and spread
itself over the plain. Here the rebels made a last
and desperate stand.</p>

<p>In the tumultuous conflict within the city, Iahia
and the prince had not encountered, though each
sought eagerly to match himself with the other,
jealous lest the fortune of the fight should rob him
of that vengeance which each thought peculiarly
his due. They now met. Giafar found his enemy
near the bank of the river upon the right, where,
by every act of valour, he was stimulating his followers 
to a last strenuous effort to retrieve the
day. They assaulted each other with singular
ferocity, and the combatants on either side that
were near them paused to witness the contest.
Both parties seemed content that the issue should

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

depend upon the personal valour of their chiefs&mdash;the 
followers of Giafar, from a confidence in the
prince's prowess, and their enemies, from a hope
that their desperate fortune might even yet be
repaired by the courage and skill of their leader.</p>

<p>There was nothing, in truth, in the condition or
conduct of either, from which any presage might
be drawn as to the result of their strife. They
were equally matched. Both were practised warriors, 
both were animated by the most deadly hostility, 
and ventured their lives as though they held
them but for the brief service of that eventful night.
Both, too, had been wounded; and if the prince
was superior in dexterity and strength, these advantages 
were well counterbalanced by the complete 
armour in which his adversary was clothed.
After a brief struggle, in which each engaged with
more impetuosity and daring than suited with prudence,
both, as if by mutual consent, paused for a
moment and rested upon their weapons, as though
summoning all their energy and coolness ere they
resumed the combat. The river rolled near them,
into which, as the torches flickered in the wind, and
the faint starlight alone was visible, their eager
efforts had more than once wellnigh precipitated
them, and they drew off from its margin farther up
upon the plain.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not now escape me," was Giafar's
exclamation, as they again addressed themselves
to the encounter. "Thine armed slaves cannot
now protect thee."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

<p>"I need them not," was the angry reply; and
thus saying, Iahia fiercely assailed the prince.
Spurring their horses forward against each other,
they closed in a more guarded yet deadly strife.
Their strokes fell like rain, as fast and weighty as
though giant hands had wielded the weapons which
inflicted them. Their scimitars clashed together
with a force which would have riven them in
pieces, except for the surpassing excellence of their
temper, and have drunk deeply and repeatedly of
blood, save for the unequalled dexterity with which
they were parried. They passed and repassed
each other at full speed, showering blows in their
career, wheeling and returning with the rapidity
of lightning, each warding off or eluding the attacks 
of his adversary with great skill, yet at times
so narrowly as to cause their respective followers
to tremble for the safety of their chiefs. After a
short time, the light soil beneath their horses' feet
became disturbed to and fro by their trampling,
and rising into the air enveloped them in a cloud
of dust, entirely concealing them from the eyes of
the beholders. Still the sword strokes rang
sharply, and the voices of the combatants were
heard in various exclamations of hatred, defiance,
and exultation. The suspense of all around had
risen to its height, when presently a sound was
heard like the swift shock of steeds together, followed 
by a fall which shook the earth beneath their
feet, and at the same time Giafar's voice, exclaiming, 
"Allah ackbar! God is victorious!" was heard

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

in clear and triumphant accents from within that
veil of sand. The wind then wafting aside the
dust, disclosed the person of the prince standing
over his prostrate enemy.<sup><a id="r010" href="#n010">10</a></sup> The followers of
Iahia, uttering a shout of grief and revenge, rushed
forward to rescue the body, or haply the life of
their chief, but they were met by eager and exulting 
opponents, and after a short struggle driven far
across the plain.</p>

<p>Iahia lay prone upon the earth. Horse and
rider had been borne down in the encounter. He
endeavoured feebly to raise his head from the dust,
bleeding, and gasping wildly for breath. He in
part succeeded, and had strength left to utter, in
an altered tone, "Thou hast conquered&mdash;thy hand&mdash;but 
turn my face&mdash;" and he pointed towards
Mecca. Giafar complied with his request, and
paused to watch him for a moment as he attempted 
to mutter his devotions. 'Twas vain.
The blood, which a moment before streamed freely
from a ghastly wound upon his throat, was staid
as he sat erect, and flowing inward mingled with
his breath. Still, for an instant, he supported
himself, strongly convulsed, yet striving with his
agony; then his limbs became suddenly relaxed,
and he fell back lifeless upon the sand. Giafar
cast a glance upon the changing, stiffening features
of his adversary, as he lay prostrate before him,
then, mounting his horse, spurred hastily across
the plain. The fight was becoming every moment
more remote. The rebels were flying and falling

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

beneath the blows of their victorious enemies&mdash;enemies 
who had no touch of mercy, or thought of
sparing the foes of their calif and their God. Far
over the plain the form of the prince might still at
intervals be seen, dealing death upon the flying,
and when darkness and the tumult hid him from
sight, his voice sounding above the distant din in
that terrific exclamation, "Allah ackbar!" told the
work in which he was yet engaged. Morning
saw that conspiracy broken and scattered, and ere
the sun set upon Bagdad, naught remained to point
out the danger and the strife which had passed
away, save the lifeless bodies strewn over the
desert, and the heads of Iahia and his chief officers
frowning in death upon the walls of the city.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">He comes, from battle and from war,

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Months</span> passed away, and tidings of victory
came often from the absent monarch. Defeated
in battle, the emperor had recourse to the snare
of a deceitful truce, and after the retreat of the
victorious calif, swept without opposition the fields
which had been so hardly contested. The news of
this outrage reached the ears of the calif as he was

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

conducting homeward his wearied warriors down
the banks of the Euphrates. Burning with rage,
he recrossed the mountains of Asia Minor amid
the snows of winter, and carried desolation even
to the walls of Constantinople. Nicephorus yielded
to the storm, and a disgraceful tribute marked his
submission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prince was occupied with the
domestic cares of the kingdom. His vigorous
and skilful administration was felt in the most distant 
portions of the state, remedying disorders that
seemed too remote and minute for a supervision
less watchful than his own. The capital, however,
fell more immediately under his observation; and
the order and industry of its inhabitants testified
the respect which they paid to his authority, and
the security with which they reposed under its
protection. Often did he wander through the city
by night, to detect those crimes which else might
have escaped his notice; disguised, he suffered the
insolence, while he discovered the debauchery of
the licentious; and the boldest in guilt trembled at
the name and presence of the vizier Giafar. Assiduous 
attention to these duties, whiled the time
away; yet many solitary hours did he pass, pondering 
upon the charms of his mistress. He had
not seen her since their interview at the cave of
the dervis; yet the remembrance of that hour
almost sufficed to render him happy. He knew
now that he was beloved; and to know this was
everything to the enamoured prince. Careless of

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

his future fate, he thought only of the present, and
anxiously awaited the return of his victorious master. 
* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Spring comes like a queen, with her armies of
flowers, "brandishing the weapons of their pointed
leaves." Winter, the tyrant, flies, for the nightingale 
proclaims her sovereign's approach, and the
dove and linnet are chanting her praises in the
groves. The calif has returned. He enters Bagdad, 
as he oft had entered it before, in triumph, and
his rejoicing subjects flock to welcome their victorious 
lord. He had returned after a long but fortunate 
campaign. The terror of his arms had been
diffused throughout the remote West; the Roman
empire trembled at his name; and an embassy from
Charlemagne testified the esteem of his great rival,
flattering his pride, if it added not to the stability
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>Thus prosperous, both at home and abroad, the
monarch now turned his thoughts to an object that
interested him far more than all others. This was
the marriage of the vizier Giafar to his daughter
Abassa. His subjects are eagerly awaiting the
nuptials; naught is heard throughout the kingdom
but the praises of the prince, worthy alone, they
say, to receive the hand of the "Rose of Persia."
Friends warmly congratulate him upon his approaching 
marriage, and esteem him the happiest
of the happy. The venerable Iahia alone seemed
not to participate in the general joy. The family
of the Barmecides was already the most illustrious

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

in the kingdom, and this was distinction sufficiently
honourable, in a land where hereditary nobility
was unknown, and where rank depended upon
offices of trust, which were granted by the favour
or justice of the monarch. But the boundary which
separated them from the throne was now to be
passed. His family was about to be allied to the
sacred race of Abbas, and in the veins of his son's
sons would flow the same blood which had once
warmed the bosom of the uncle of the Prophet.
The old man foresaw the evils which might arise,
and at no distant day, from the dazzling, though
dangerous alliance, and he trembled as he thought
upon them. He knew not, however, the stern precaution 
which the calif had adopted to prevent
those dangers which he feared; and had he known
of this, instead of diminishing his anxieties it would
only have increased them, and in a tenfold degree.
Concealing his useless uneasiness, the old man,
though inwardly sorrowing, looked calmly upon
the preparations for the intended nuptials.</p>

<p>The prince has resigned his office into the hands
of his master, that the toils of public life may not
divide those hours which are destined by the calif
to social and unfettered enjoyment. The post of
vizier has been conferred upon Fadhel, Giafar's
elder brother. The contract of marriage has been
signed and sealed&mdash;the imam has recited the customary 
formula&mdash;the legal ceremonies have been
performed, and all things are ready for the reception 
of the princess at the abode of the expecting
Giafar.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Joy</span> and festivity reign throughout the city. For
three days sumptuous cavalcades and magnificent
processions are passing to and fro, throughout the
streets, bearing the customary presents from the
father of the bride, to the abode of the favoured
bridegroom. Gay robes, rich furniture, bright vases
of gold and silver, with jewels of high worth, blaze
in succession on the way. The rarest treasures of
Asia mingle with the more useful but less costly
productions of the West. "The hand of Liberality
fills the lap of desire," and all eyes are wondering
at the calif's bounty.</p>

<p>Bright lights gleam at night from mosque and
college, and from every terrace burning lamps are
sending to heaven their perfume. The nights vie
with the, days in splendour. The Tigris rolls its
waters through a plain of light; for on either side,
palace and bazaar, and the various dwellings which
skirt the stream, are pouring from their windows
a blaze as of noonday. The bridge of boats which

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

crosses the river is illuminated, and the tapers reflected 
in its waters mingle with the planets which
hold their course through the mimic heaven beneath. 
Burning torches sail eddying and whirling
down the stream like stars that have fallen, and
float unextinguished upon its surface. "The carpet 
of gayety is spread." The chanting of merry
voices, the sound of lute and tabour fall upon the
ear. Joy is heard in the light step of him that
passes, and in the breeze that murmurs gladly by.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, the bride is carried in a litter
to the palace of the prince, escorted by a numerous
band of maidens. The calif and Giafar follow,
reining noble steeds, and after them throng a numerous 
retinue of friends and dependants.</p>

<p>A long canopy of silk extends from the royal
palace to the abode of the prince, under which the
procession passes, shielded from the burning sun.
Amid loud outbursting music, they enter the prince's
dwelling, and throng through its spacious chambers. 
The apartment into which were ushered
the most important personages of the assemblage,
and into which all crowded that could gain admission, 
was a vast hall, supported by ranging pillars,
where cascades and fountains were mingling their
sounds with the music of the cymbal and tabour.</p>

<p>The hours pass gayly to the joyous guests. The
sun is gone, and his absence is supplied by a thousand 
lamps that hang suspended from the carved
ceilings and brightly painted walls. Blazing jewels,
too, that sparkle upon the richly habited throng

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

like stars, throw their bright rays upon the splendid
scene. The jest, the song, the dance, make up the
round of pleasure, and all seem happy. The delighted 
Giafar smiles, and the calif is the gayest of
the gay.</p>

<p>The princess enters often the apartment, at each
time changing anew her rich robes for garments
yet more splendid. But wealth and art are exhausted, 
and she at last appears, covered with a
veil of crimson silk bordered with jewels and
with gold. Ere he bends with her before the calif,
the bridegroom is clothed with a costly habit studded 
with gems, the gift of the Commander of the
Faithful. They approach together to the monarch's
feet. His liberal hand has showered pearls upon
the head of his bending daughter, and his lips are
about to unclose to pronounce a blessing on his
children, when&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold! forbear!" exclaimed a stern voice, and
all eyes were directed to a dark form which at that
moment glided ghostlike into the apartment. He
wore the garments of a fire worshipper. Instead
of turban, the cap of a Giaour covered his head, and
his soiled and hoary beard descended to the leathern 
belt which encircled his waist. Muttered
curses were heard throughout the hall, while astonishment 
and indignation were visible in the face
of every guest as they descried these emblems of
the outcast. All made way for him as he approached, 
gathering up their garments, and shrinking 
from the touch of the defiled infidel, and he

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

advanced through the throng close to the side of
the calif.</p>

<p>So deeply was the calif interested in the bridal
ceremonies, that he was unaware of the Giaour's
approach until he had advanced close to his side;
No sooner had he cast his eyes upon the strange
intruder than he started; then composing his countenance 
gazed upon him in silence. In an instant,
an interval of years was removed, and things long
past were present to his remembrance; for in the
person of the dark infidel who stood before him he
knew the form and features of that mysterious being 
who had rescued his father's legacy from the
waters of the Tigris. Mastering the awe that was
creeping upon him, he said, firmly, "Is it thou,
strange being?&mdash;wherefore art thou here?"</p>

<p>"In an hour when thou lookest not for me, I
have come," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Thou sayst rightly," answered the monarch,
firmly. "I looked not to see thee at such a time.
What wouldst thou with me?"</p>

<p>"Canst thou not surmise mine errand?" replied
the Giaour. "Have the years which have rolled by
since we last met, effaced from thy memory the
events of that day?"</p>

<p>"As though they were of yesterday, I remember 
them," said the calif.</p>

<p>"On that day I brought from the deep the jewel
that now adorns thy&mdash;"nay, 'tis not there, thou
wearest it not! Thou hast not parted with it?"
exclaimed the aged infidel, in a thrilling tone. "Yet&mdash;no,

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

no! thou couldst not thus despise my warning!"</p>

<p>"Question me not, old man," said Haroun, with
as much firmness as he could assume, "but proceed 
as to the purpose of thy coming."</p>

<p>"Thy promise&mdash;the boon which thou art pledged
to grant me&mdash;thou canst not have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"I remember well. In requital for thy service
on that day, I passed my royal word to grant thee
any boon thou mightst demand, so that it injured
not the honour and safety of our holy faith, and
the well-being of our subjects. Well, go on!"</p>

<p>"For that purpose have I now come&mdash;to claim
the fulfilment of thy promise."</p>

<p>"This is no place, old man. At another hour,
and it shall be thine&mdash;but the time is ill fitting. Dost
thou not mark how thy presence casts a gloom on
all around?"</p>

<p>"If the gloom of to-day dispel the darkness of
to-morrow the time is <i>well</i> fitting," replied the
stranger. Then casting his eyes slowly around
upon the assemblage, he added, "But thou sayst
aright; fear sits in the face of every guest, yet
who seems more sad than yon bridegroom, who
now clasps the hand of that maiden, her of the cypress 
form. There is mystery here&mdash;how should
this be?"</p>

<p>Anger predominated over awe for a moment in
the calif's bosom, and he replied quickly, "Thou
art over bold. Once more, I bid thee question me
not."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

<p>"As I live!" interrupted the Giaour, "that ring!
it is the same! 'Tis shining on the prince's finger.
Rash monarch! what hast thou done? Thou hast
slighted my warning, thou hast scorned my counsel. 
What shall hinder that sorrow and ruin come
not upon thee, and upon thy race?"</p>

<p>"It is written!" said the monarch, gloomily, impressed, 
despite his efforts, by the earnest manner
in which the Giaour addressed him.</p>

<p>"Naught is written but thine own folly and presumption; 
the evils which should follow may yet
be averted, if thou wilt listen to me; if thou refuse
not the boon that thou hast already promised to
bestow."</p>

<p>"Speak on then, but quickly," said the calif.</p>

<p>"My words are for thine ear alone," replied the
infidel.</p>

<p>At a sign from the Commander of the Faithful
all drew back dismayed, and wondering at the
emotion evinced by the calif at the words of that
old man. The stranger then approached more
closely to the monarch's side, and said, in a low
voice,</p>

<p>"Seek not, imperious prince, to oppose the laws
by which the God thou worshippest rules his servants. 
Thou hast joined thy children in marriage,
but thou hast fettered their union by a grievous
chain. Remove it&mdash;render them free and happy.
So shalt thou avoid the danger which now threatens 
thee, and avert such sorrow as will one day
overwhelm thy soul with its bitterness."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

<p>It was with the utmost difficulty that the calif
could restrain his anger sufficiently to await the
conclusion of the stranger's words. He did so,
however; but fire flashed from his eyes, and his
bearded lip quivered with agitation; and when the
old man had finished speaking, he exclaimed
quickly, and aloud,</p>

<p>"Accursed dog! who has counselled thee to
this? There is treason in thy words, and, by my
right hand! the traitor shall suffer."</p>

<p>As he spoke, his eyes glanced around the assemblage 
until they rested on Giafar. But the
prince was too much occupied in his own emotions
to be moved by, or even to heed the scrutinizing
glance of his master. The strange tale which he
had so lately heard, had not yet passed from his
remembrance. He could not doubt that the infidel
before him was the same mysterious stranger,
whose warning to the calif had impressed his
bosom with such fear. Amazement and awe were
strongly depicted in his countenance, as he gazed
upon the scene before him, and listened to the fearful 
forebodings of his heart. Thus absorbed, he
endured the gaze of the calif with unruffled composure. 
Haroun, half divested of his suspicions,
hesitated, seemed irresolute, then turned again to
the stranger, whose attitude exhibited a calmness,
which was the more striking contrasted with the
agitation that affected all present</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" he said.</p>

<p>The Giaour spoke not.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

<p>"Whence hast thou thy knowledge?"</p>

<p>The stranger pointed upward, and a solemn and
fearful smile lightened up his dark features, but he
spoke not a word.</p>

<p>"Say rather from thine own dark abode. No
good angel would wear that garb. Thou mayst
be Eblis's self&mdash;against whom we implore thine aid,
most merciful Allah!"</p>

<p>Talismans were sought and clasped by trembling 
hands. Prayers were uttered. Many called
aloud upon the most merciful, self-subsisting, all-wise 
Allah, or by whatever attribute they chose to
invoke the protection of the Divinity. Female
voices were also heard, mingling their sweet but
tremulous intonations in the adjurations and prayers 
that were uttered around them. Many of careless 
and dissolute lives were seen gathering around
some good imam, whose presence they would
have carefully avoided at a season of mirth; and
even in that hour of terror the saint could not repress 
his pride, as he bade them grasp the skirts
of his garments, and remain fast by his holy
person.</p>

<p>"If thou art that dark spirit," continued the
calif, when he had somewhat repressed his fears&mdash;"if 
thou art that dark spirit, leave me&mdash;tempt me
no more. That thou art an enemy to our holy
faith I know full well, from the boon which thou
hast proffered. Yet, infidel or fiend, whiche'er thou
art, thou shalt fail of thine unhallowed purpose.
The evils which might accrue to Islamism, from a

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

race too nearly allied to my house, could alone be
averted by the restraint which, as the guardian of
our faith, I have laid upon the union of my children. 
I wonder not it should displease thee.
Thou wouldst scatter the seeds of strife in the
bosom of religion, ay, within the walls of paradise,
if thou couldst. But be gone!" Here the calif's
voice echoed in thrilling tones throughout that
spacious hall. "I heed thee not. Though a
legion of fiends should oppose me, I will not alter
my determination. I will have no offspring of
Giafar al Barmeki and my daughter strive, when I
am dead, to wrest the sceptre from the grasp of
my sons."</p>

<p>All heard and wondered at this announcement.
Giafar was pale as marble, and the princess trembled, 
and leaned upon his arm for support.</p>

<p>"Is thine honour of no worth, then? Is thy
plighted faith naught?" exclaimed the Giaour.
"Thou hast promised to grant my prayer, and yet
I ask in vain."</p>

<p>"If thou art mortal, demand some other boon.
Ask for lands, rich jewels, steeds, wealth illimitable, 
and they shall be thine; but this comes not
within the bounds of my promise."</p>

<p>"For myself I wish nothing. The treasures of
this world cannot enrich one who has no part in
its cares. I plead but for others; and, mark me
well! the day is coming when thou wouldst part
with half thy kingdom, if thou couldst recall this
hour."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

<p>The calif sternly shook his head.</p>

<p>"Be not blind to their fate," continued the
Giaour. "Upon the face of yon bridegroom sit
youth and manhood, and that rich veil, if I guess
aright, conceals a fair form, and a bosom swelling
with love and hope. Need I say more? Canst
thou, by a word, extinguish the flame of affection,
and chill the warm blood that courses through
their veins? Be wise in time. Wilt thou not bitterly 
repent, when thy commands shall be disobeyed? 
Wilt thou not forgive? The punishment 
will not be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It shall be death," interrupted the calif, in the
most fearful tones. Then turning to the prince,
he said, "Hearest thou, Giafar?"</p>

<p>The prince bowed his head, and placed his hand
upon his bosom, in token of his devotion to his
master's will. As for the princess, she trembled
more violently, and would have fallen, had not
Giafar's arm supported her.</p>

<p>"And now, strange man, away!" exclaimed the
monarch. "Thou talkest in vain. I will not
listen to thee. Away! keep us no longer from the
holy rites."</p>

<p>Haroun waved his hand impatiently, and turned
to complete the yet unfinished ceremonies. When
he again looked, the infidel was gone. The spell
which the presence of the Giaour seemed to have
cast upon the monarch, vanished when the infidel
was no longer present. Suspicion and anger were
in an instant awake.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

<p>" 'Tis knavery! 'tis a cheat!" he exclaimed.
"Which way went he? Saw none of you his
departure?"</p>

<p>The astonished guests pointed in various directions, in which, as it appeared to their troubled
fancies, the Giaour had left the hall.</p>

<p>"Seek him, Mesrour&mdash;seek him all. Search
the building from court to terrace&mdash;scour the garden&mdash;drag 
him to my presence. I would again
question the slave. Away&mdash;quickly!"</p>

<p>All the recesses of palace and garden are hastily
searched, but without success. They return one
by one, and to the calif's question, "Have you
found him?" all have the same reply. Mesrour,
indeed, brought word that, in crossing one of the
walks of the court, he passed a holy man, who was
performing his ablutions before a fountain. Save
him, no person had been found within the walls.</p>

<p>"A dervis!" said the calif, quickly, when Mesrour 
had spoken. "Didst thou scan him closely?
Were there no tokens of the Giaour upon him?"</p>

<p>"There were none, may it please the Commander 
of the Faithful. He wore a white turban,
and was robed in the blue habit of a sheik."</p>

<p>"Art thou sure?" said the calif. "Have not
thine eyes deceived thee? Eblis has power to-night. 
Why didst thou not question him?"</p>

<p>"May it please the calif," replied Mesrour, "I
feared to interrupt the saint's devotions. But there
could be no deceit. A rosary<sup><a id="r011" href="#n011">11</a></sup> was in his hands,
and on returning, I heard him, as he passed the

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

beads through his fingers, call aloud upon the
sacred names and attributes of the Most High."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well, let it pass," said Haroun, relapsing
into thought. Giafar and the princess, trembling
and agitated, now kneel again at his feet, and
roused from his revery, the calif coldly pronounces 
a blessing upon their heads. The ill-omened
nuptials are over.</p>

<p>The princess, having bent lowly before her stern
father, retired, accompanied by her damsels. After
her departure all crowd around the prince, with
kind greetings, and warm wishes for his happiness;
but they are coldly uttered, and sound like mockery 
to his ear. His father and brothers look sadly
upon him, and, as they clasp him in their arms, bid
him be of good cheer. Giafar receives them with
vacant gaze&mdash;he heeds them not&mdash;his thoughts
are at times fixed upon the trying present, and at
times upon the threatening future.</p>

<p>"I have seen to-night," he whispered to himself,
"another link in the chain that is dragging me to
my ruin!"</p>

<p>Yet, however absorbing were his fears, they vanished 
from his mind, and gave way to emotions far
more poignant, as he retired from the nuptial chamber, 
and sought alone his solitary apartment.
Mockery again greets him as he crosses the threshold 
of his own chamber; for there, as though their
mistress were reposing within, the maidens of the
bride are grouped together, as is the custom, and
affect to oppose his entrance. Their feigned resistance 

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

is but short: the temper of Giafar can ill
brook such foolery, and he dashes rudely by them
into the apartment. We will not tarry by the
couch of the sad bridegroom. May he slumber, if
his thoughts will let him. Sleep, deep and undisturbed, 
such as visits not the eyes of mortals, save
by the aid of poppy juice, or black Thebaic tincture, 
should steep his senses in oblivion. He will
not else forget his cares.</p>

<p>The calif has retired, gloomy and disturbed.
Each wondering guest has departed to his own
home, and the hall is deserted. The lamps, which
shone so brightly, are extinguished by the slaves of
the palace, and darkness covers all things. But
now the moon appears with her pale light, ascending 
slowly above the horizon. Arise, chaste Diana,
shine coldly out in the heavens&mdash;triumph if thou
wilt: Hymen has deserted the sweet queen of love,
and for once follows captive in thy train.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">How welcome is each gentle air
That wakes and wafts the odours there!
For there&mdash;the rose o'er crag and vale,
Sultana of the nightingale,
The maid for whom his melody,
His thousand songs are heard on high,

<p class="right"><i>Giaour</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the marriage of Giafar to his daughter,
the calif's affection for the prince seemed to have
vanished, and in its stead fear and suspicion had
entered his bosom: suspicion, that the appearance
of the stranger, who had borne so eventful a part in
the occurrences of the nuptial evening, had been
caused by Giafar himself, in hopes that by working
upon the fears of his master, he might be induced to
retract his purpose with regard to the union of his
children; fear, lest an alliance, commenced under
circumstances so inauspicious, might terminate in
disobedience and punishment. Anger also moved
him, when he remembered that in the confusion of
his soul, he had then revealed the harsh constraint
which he had thrown upon the affections of his
children, thus rendering their present lot and their
future fortunes subjects for raillery and scoffing in

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

the mouths of a busy world. He had wished the
prince to enjoy, in the estimation of his subjects, all
the honour and happiness which should of right belong 
to an alliance so exalted and so envied, while
in reality he would bind him, by the most stern
threatenings, to err in nowise from the commands
which he had imposed upon him. Yet, in each
wish he feared disappointment. His own haste and
imprudence had already foiled the one, and the
other, and more important, was threatened by the
darkest omens. All his fond schemes appeared
frustrated. Those very means which were intended 
to strengthen the ties of friendship, seemed instead 
to have torn them wide asunder.</p>

<p>'Tis plain&mdash;the favour of the calif is withdrawn
from Giafar, and a servile and envious court look
with a cold eye upon him, who but now seemed to
stand upon the topmost pinnacle of fortune. They
thought him degraded and disgraced. They thought
that if he basked not in the sunshine of royal favour
his hours must needs be cold and comfortless, and
they pitied and slighted him. Thus the poor savage 
reasons. The brightness of the sun he fancies
is extinguished in the depths of ocean when he withdraws 
his rays from his own narrow horizon; and
knows not that they still enlighten a magnificent
and glorious universe.</p>

<p>Though deprived of the friendship of his master,
and secluded from the gayety of the court, yet, in
the sweet retirement of his home, Giafar found
peace and uninterrupted joy. Within its hallowed

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

precinct, the cares, the fears, the feverish anxieties
of the busy world dared not intrude. The stern
coldness of his master, and the chilling indifference
of hollow-hearted friends, were here alike shut out
and forgotten; here, at least, in the presence of his
bride, his own Abassa, the young prince was happy. 
Little to him were light and favour, but as
they shone forth upon him from beneath the lids of
her bright eyes; little were mirth and joy, though
heard it might be in tones of softest music, or the
glad sounds of many mirthful friends, unless her
dear voice echoed near him in its thrilling melody.
The air was heavy, and the bird's note sad, heaven's 
brightness dim, the sky cheerless, when she
was absent; and with her the season had no storms,
earth no sorrows, fortune no frowns that could
disturb him. All his gloomiest anticipations vanished 
then, and all his cares were amply compensated 
by the dear delight which her presence shed
continually upon him.</p>

<p>What a strange pleasure is it to be near the one
we love! hour after hour, day after day to watch
her. To listen to that voice sounding its music
on the soul&mdash;to gaze with timid eyes upon a face
so dear&mdash;to touch perchance a hand that trembles 
to our own, while the strange thrill that vibrates 
through the frame proves us we are not
"clay." To scan together with affected care some
book or jewel which the rapt senses heed not&mdash;when 
the bright locks are mingling with our own,
sweet heralds, that tell us that a brow or cheek is

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

near, which yet we dare not press. What magic
is there in the heart by which we know when eyes
we love are gazing on us, that tells us whose step
it is advances, although the fairy feet are yet
unseen?</p>

<p>But the festivities which ensued upon the nuptials 
are scarcely over, when the heats of summer
drive the wealthy and luxurious into the inviting
retreats of the neighbouring country. The Commander 
of the Faithful departs for Raccah, his
favourite residence on the river Euphrates, and
Giafar with his bride leaves the city, to pass the
summer months at his gardens on the banks of the
Tigris. * * * * *</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Circassia's fairest flowers are blooming in the
harem of the bridegroom, but they have no charms
for him. Music and the echoing dance resound
merrily through the palace halls, yet Giafar heeds
them not. Love led, he daily bends his steps to
the private gardens of his palace. There, verdant
trees spread their shade and fragrant shrubs diffuse 
their perfume throughout the air. Fountains
sounding "sweeter than a well-tuned lute," pour
around their murmuring waters, and singing birds
are heard breathing their sweet notes in the groves.
Beneath the feet a carpet of flowers is spread;
every breeze shakes them from the drooping
boughs, and spatters them widely around. "Beautiful 
butterflies are seen whirling through the air,
like rose leaves driven by the wind."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

<p>The Tigris rolls its waters at one extremity of
the garden, where, as though it would encroach
upon a spot so delightful, it had formed a small
bay, or slight indentation in the shore. Here the
gentler waters retiring from the rude current of
the river, seemed to lave and caress that sweet
bank, near which its enamoured waves would fain
have lingered. Naught is seen but one bright, one
perfect picture; every breath is odour, every
sound is music. Paradise seems here to display
its paths, and invite the feet to wander through, its
delightful mazes. Yet did they wind through a
trackless and interminable desert, with no less
pleasure and alacrity would Giafar have trod them,
for here, at the selfsame hour, daily walks the
princess of his soul.</p>

<p>A beautiful kiosk, built upon the river's edge,
was, by tacit consent, their place of meeting.
Vast pillars of porphyry sustained its roof, the
spaces between which were built up with white
marble, curiously carved, and reaching breast
high, thus forming a sort of parapet over which
one might lean and look down into the current
below. From this to the gilded roof close latticework 
surrounded the building, by which, during
the heat of the day, the sun's rays were excluded,
yet through which Zephyr, if he whispered ever so
gently without, found a ready entrance.</p>

<p>Perfumed lamps were here continually burning,
and odours of all climes greeted the ravished
senses. A flight of steps descended to the ground,

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

and led the way to a suite of subterranean chambers, 
consisting of baths, and apartments replete
with every oriental luxury. Slaves were in attendance 
here below, but they were invisible, and
their duties seemed performed by the ready hands
of obedient genii.</p>

<p>Here, in this delightful pavilion, the princess,
after the completion of her domestic and religious
duties, was wont to seclude herself. Here were
her lute, her books, her flowers, and here she was
sure to see one who was dearer to her than all
these combined. Here, when the sun shone warmly
at noon, refreshed by the breeze, or by the cool
evaporation from the river's surface, they read, or
talked, or sang. When evening came, the moon
was welcomed through the opened lattice, and
leaning forth, they gazed upon the heavens, and
spoke of its beauties, its inhabitants, of the angels
that dwell in every little star, vainly wishing they
might inhabit one together. When they looked
upward upon the smiling scene, they seemed content; 
yet when they gazed upon the stream below,
hurrying swiftly by them, at that vivid emblem of
their own fleeting happiness, they wept. Even
this, however, was pleasure to them; for who
knows not how sweet it is to fear, to tremble, and
to weep with one we love?</p>

<p>When the face of night darkened and frowned,
they withdrew from her chilling aspect, and forgetting 
her inconstancy, by the light of faithful lamps
pursued their pleasures. Ofttimes soft music from

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

the river's edge, chosen by the exquisite taste of
the prince, soothed and delighted them, as if the
peris and genii of the waters were chanting to them
from their deep homes. Thus passed the hours.
But little was wanting to complete their happiness.
And who below the skies can boast of unalloyed
felicity? Ofttimes 'tis a small thing mars our
joys. Does not the annoying insect disturb repose
in the delightful garden, where nature is at peace,
and whispers it to mortals?</p>

<p>One bright evening they were looking forth
together from their favourite retreat. Night had
clothed herself in loveliness. Stars, bright as the
eyes which were gazing on them, shone in the
heavens, and a mild moon held her course far
above them. Beneath were the same heavens distinctly 
reflected in the Tigris.</p>

<p>All was still, except the bulbul with his sweet
note complaining near them, and the roses hung
their heads and blushed as they listened to his
song. The breeze from the adjacent meadows
wafted to them the odour of its wild heather, and
the sweet-scented henna flowers sent up their fragrance 
from the vases in the garden beneath.
Above these, however, the perfume of the rose
was easily distinguishable; and in such profusion
was its fragrance diffused around, that the song of
the poet seemed divested of its hyperbole, and
"the dew of night was changed into rose water ere
it fell to earth."</p>

<p>They had been long looking upon this scene of

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

beauty, and talking with mutual delight of a thousand 
topics which readily presented themselves to
their minds, when their conversation took gradually 
a melancholy turn. They spoke of their future
fate, and of the many chances which might separate 
them&mdash;of their present happiness, and of their
fears lest it might soon be dissipated&mdash;dreading
even the most remote contingencies lest they should
bring them sorrow. At last Giafar proposed to
cast the horoscope of their future fate.</p>

<p>"Let us inquire of the heavens," he said, "which
seem so to smile upon us, whether, indeed, they
do not threaten misfortune and misery. Even
the stars, my life, are deceitful."</p>

<p>"I could weep to hear it," answered the princess. 
"I have been fancying that truth dwelt in
them, and wishing that this earth was as pure and
happy as all seems to be above. Why did you
undeceive me? But do they indeed frown upon
us, Giafar? They seem to smile most sweetly. I
would I knew it not."</p>

<p>"Nay, my life, I know not that they portend us
ill. Perchance our fate is written there above, in
lines as bright and cheering as their own beams.
I will look at the Ephemerides, and in a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, do not," interrupted Abassa; "why
should we wish to know the future? Let us be
content that at present we are happy."</p>

<p>"True, true," replied the prince, somewhat
sadly, and as he spoke he bent his head, and imprinted 

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

a kiss upon her hand which he had before
taken, and had held for some time enclosed in his.
A rebuking look and word chid him for his fault,
yet the fair hand was not withdrawn, although he
held it lightly between his own.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes were attracted by a bright
shooting star. "Look! look! see there!" It was
gone. "What should that teach us, Giafar?" she
said, turning towards him, after a moment's silence,
and withdrawing the hand which he still detained
in his.</p>

<p>"I know not, dearest," was the reply; "what
lesson wouldst thou draw from it?"</p>

<p>"Caution," replied Abassa. "How watchful
are the angels that stand as sentinels above! When
some evil spirit approaches the confines of those
happy regions, listening to the converse of its
blessed inhabitants, bright arrows<sup><a id="r012" href="#n012">12</a></sup> are quickly
darted at him; and, ere he can catch one sound that
is uttered, he is driven away, pursued by a shining
flame. See! again!" she exclaimed, as the same
phenomenon was for an instant again visible.</p>

<p>"True, light of mine eyes," answered the prince,
in a strain of gayety, which he hoped would enliven 
her despondency; "they should well watch
who guard paradise."</p>

<p>"And from evil spirits," she rejoined, taking for
an instant a lightsome tone; then relapsing into her
former melancholy, she continued: "But give not
a meaning to my words that they deserve not, and
do not think with jest and laughter to dispel the

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

sadness that hangs over me. I cannot be mirthful
to-night."</p>

<p>"Here is thy lute," said the prince, offering to
her one that was near them&mdash;"take it, wilt thou
not? Take it, and sing sorrow away; it will
vanish when it hears thy voice."</p>

<p>"I cannot frame my lips to song," replied Abassa: 
"but do thou touch the strings and I will listen
to thee delighted. Let it be something sad," she
continued, as the prince prepared to comply with
her request. "Thou canst not dispel my gloom;
try to sooth and sweeten it."</p>

<p>Giafar then, accompanying his voice with great
taste upon the instrument, sang a few verses expressive 
of the inconstancy of fortune, and of the
power of mutual love to render mortals proof
against its frowns. When the song was ended,
the prince perceived that her cheek was wet with
tears, and after a short prelude, he sang the following 
stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She was near me! Her tresses covered my
brow&mdash;her sweet breathing warmed my cheek, and
I said, 'Is it the west wind that brings with it so
pleasant an odour, having passed over a meadow
strewn with fragrant flowers, where the fire of
Heaven has burned the sweet-scented aloe wood?
or is it a caravan laden with musk from Khoten
that is at hand?' "</p>

<p>" 'Tis beautiful!" said the princess, blushing&mdash;"but 
I will no longer listen to thee."</p>

<p>"I will sing yet again," was Giafar's reply, as

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

he endeavoured to detain her in an affectionate
embrace. She started from his arms, however,
saying, "I cannot hear thee to-night," and approaching 
the door of the apartment, clapped her
hands, when a slave entered, bearing a tray covered 
with fruits, sherbets, and various delicacies.
Of these they partook slightly, intermingling their
repast with mirthful or sad discourse, smiling or
sighing, as the last thought prompted them&mdash;then
committing each other to Allah's keeping for the
night, they reluctantly parted.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Old Ballad</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> passed the days. But happiness is fleeting.
Time flies bringing sorrow. The prince's temper
has become fitful and varied. A frown is always
on his brow, and each day he loses some part of
that evenness of spirit which he once possessed in
a degree so remarkable. His friends, his favourite
servants, experience the effects of this change, and
wonder at his harshness. He visits seldom that
favourite kiosk, he seems rather to fear than covet

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

its sweet and hallowed retirement, as though a fair
demon tenanted the spot to charm him to his ruin.</p>

<p>He walks often by Abassa's side, pensive and
sad, and often starts suddenly away to wander in
the most secluded walks of his gardens. But the
image of his wife follows him; he cannot be alone,
he cannot rest. Her charms haunt his imagination,
and like a steel arrow in his soul, disturb and madden 
him. He pours wine into the cup, and quaffs
deeply of its unhallowed current; yet though he
may forget himself, he cannot drown the remembrance 
of her beauty, or cease, even for a moment,
to think of her, who has thrown a chain of love
around him, and holds him captive therein. He
seeks amid the wit and beauty of his harem to
find those whom he may love, and endeavours in
the society of his beautiful slaves to forget her. It
is in vain. A moment of pleasure, of mirth is
passed, and then follow the slowly rolling hours,
which are spent in thoughts of her.</p>

<p>Abassa, too, is sad. She looks for him who is
her hope, her happiness, but he is no longer near
to cheer and delight her. She seeks their loved
retreat, where she was ever wont to find him, but
he is not there. That dear chamber seems a wilderness. 
Her flowers wither. Her lute is unstrung; 
its rich music slumbers upon its loosened
chords. Her heart is like the desert, as desolate
and as burning&mdash;burning with a warm love; ay,
and another restless, torturing passion, is lighting
up its young fires in her bosom. Her soul sinks

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

within her as she thinks upon the fair forms that
are imprisoned in the gay harem. "Ah, that he
were here!" she would often murmur, "that he
were now smiling upon me. And yet, perhaps,
'tis better thus&mdash;better that he should be away. If
he were gone afar, upon some mission for my
father, or to the wars&mdash;Heaven shield him!&mdash;I
tremble while I think upon it&mdash;I should be happier,
more content than now; but to know him near
me, and yet so seldom see him&mdash;to fear, too,
alas! what now I fear." A frown, with something
of anger in it, gathers upon her brow, and the quick
crimson hurries into her cheek. But this soon
passes, and her face resumes its patient sadness.</p>

<p>The colour upon her cheek has slightly faded;
her rounded form has lost somewhat of its fulness,
and her once buoyant step has become slow and
languid. Yet is her beauty softened, not diminished, 
and the sweetness of her spirit is in nowise
altered. Complaint is written in her countenance, 
yet she speaks it not. She seems an angel,
wearied with sorrows, silently looking into the face
of Heaven her reproaches. This change in the
spirits and appearance of Abassa did not escape
the observation of the good Ibrahim, for she visited
him often, and he tried frequently to encourage
and console her. She had not imparted her sorrows 
to him, as she was wont, yet he readily
divined their nature; and approached with care a
task, which he felt to be so difficult and delicate.</p>

<p>In one of their interviews, the old man strove

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

with all his skill and kindness to cheer her melancholy. 
They were walking together in the grove
of palm trees which grew at the foot of the mountain, 
the spot where she had heard from Giafar's
lips the first avowal of his love; where, too, she
had told him, with a sweet and expressive look, the
secret which she had treasured up in her own heart.
There was the little lake, with its tributary fountains, 
hurrying with the same soft murmur into its
bosom. The palm trees were still waving in the
wind, the dates were, as then, hanging in ripe clusters 
upon their lofty branches. The birds were as
happy and their song as melodious. The good
dervis was standing before her, nothing altered.
Everything around reminded her of that long-past 
yet well remembered interview. She
looked for a moment, half expecting to see the
prince advance to complete the scene. Her
thoughts soon reverted to her present condition,
and she wept. How was she changed; health,
heart, temper, all changed, and becoming each day
more feeble, fitful, and capricious. The prince,
too, where was he? where was he now? She
turned her head, thinking to hide her tears, but not
so soon as to escape the notice of the dervis.
"Thou art weeping, my daughter," he said; "why
dost thou grieve?"</p>

<p>"This scene, father, brings to my mind the past,"
replied the maiden, endeavouring to subdue her
emotion. "I did weep&mdash;yes, a few tears&mdash;why
should I conceal them?&mdash;for departed hours. Hast
thou never done this?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

<p>"I have regretted time misspent; I have wept
over its loss, and have wished to recall it, that I
might better employ its hours."</p>

<p>"But did you never grieve for happiness that
has flown? Do you not, at times, lament the loss
of some bright moments, when joy was ever at
hand, when pleasure shed its sweet influence upon
every hour?"</p>

<p>"Happiness never deserts the innocent," replied
the dervis. "Yon birds, how gay and joyous are
they?"</p>

<p>"And wherefore should they not be so?" answered 
the princess. "The air is free to them.
Nature offers all her bounty to their enjoyment."</p>

<p>" 'Tis the reward of innocence, my daughter.
They who err not are always at peace. Many
are there in this busy world, who might receive a
useful lesson, would they but listen to the song of
those happy warblers, and ponder upon their sinless 
existence."</p>

<p>"I would I were a bird," exclaimed Abassa,
sighing heavily as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Thou errest, daughter, in thy wish. Why
shouldst thou envy them? They have no hope
beyond the present hour, no promise of felicity that
can never end. But thou art unhappy. Some
secret grief weighs heavily upon thy spirit. Is it
not so?"</p>

<p>"I unhappy, father?" answered the maiden, evading, 
though she scarce knew why, the old man's
scrutiny. "Have my lips breathed a murmur?

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

has my tongue uttered aught that could lead thee
to think this?"</p>

<p>"Do not deny me thy confidence," replied the
dervis, somewhat reproachfully. "Yet thou canst
not deceive me. I read that in thy sad countenance
which thy lips refuse to tell. I look not to thy
words. One who has lived his fourscore years, in
the varied scenes which are this world's portion,
heeds not the tongue, but regards closely the
cheek that is daily growing pale, the eye that is
saddening, and the youthful form that fast fades.
I have seen these long in thee. I have noted, too,
the sighs that often heave thy bosom, and the tears&mdash;nay, 
they are now glistening in thine eyes. Hide
not thy sorrows from me. Thou hast those which
thou wouldst fain conceal, but keep them no longer
from one who in truth loves thee. My counsel
may cheer and support thy spirit."</p>

<p>"Thou art right," answered Abassa. "Sorrow
has indeed laid its hand upon me. But tell not of
it. I would hide it from him&mdash;I would hide it
from all the world. But how have I merited this
grief?" continued the maiden. "Answer me,
father. If, as thou sayst, the innocent are always
happy, of what dark crime have I been guilty, that
I should be thus wretched?"</p>

<p>"If of none other, yet of this, my daughter: thou
hast failed of confidence in Heaven. Thou hast
not given up thy hopes into the hands of Him who
will of a surety protect and strengthen those who
repose alone upon his goodness. Thou shouldst

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

not yield up thy firmness, but wait in patience for
a happier season to arrive."</p>

<p>"I am a woman, father, weak and helpless.
Blame me not, then, but teach me to support my
sorrows."</p>

<p>The old man looked upon her for a moment,
with something approaching to wonder in his countenance, 
as the maiden thus avowed her grief, and
then answered,</p>

<p>"Be not thus overcome. The trial which is
now bending thy spirit beneath its weight may not
long endure. Changing events may soon bring
peace to thy bosom. Thy father may repent him
of his stern decree, and all happiness with him
thou lovest may be thine."</p>

<p>At these words the princess started, as if in surprise 
and uncertainty; her brow crimsoned, and
she seemed about to speak, but the dervis continued,</p>

<p>"Arm thyself with fortitude, my daughter.
Shake off, as ill befitting thine honour and thy
pride, the dominion of those emotions which
threaten to destroy thy peace."</p>

<p>The princess turned an inquiring gaze upon the
face of the old man, as though she would read his
most secret thoughts; then, as she seemed to
gather more clearly the purport of his words, an
indignant flush passed across her features, and in
a tone of dignity and wounded pride, tempered,
indeed, by respect and affection, she replied,</p>

<p>"Father, I have known thee long and loved thee

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

well. I have sought thee, when sorrow and affliction 
have come 'nigh me. I have ever listened to
thy counsel with delight, and never till now has
aught fallen from thy lips which sounded harshly
upon mine ear. But now thy words are strange
and ill advised. Nay, listen to me. I will speak
freely to thee, for thou hast been a father to my
youth. I will not question thy love or thy wisdom&mdash;but 
know, if there be aught in thy thoughts unworthy 
of me, or of the husband of my love&mdash;ay,
and of thyself, too, father&mdash;thou hast widely
erred."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my child. Forgive the eager care
of an old man. It was my purpose to console and
strengthen thee."</p>

<p>"I think no more of it. But hear me. I thought
not to impart my grief to mortal. I have oft
breathed it to Heaven, whence alone I look for
relief, but since thou hast thus misjudged me, thou
shall know all. He loves me no longer!"</p>

<p>She paused, the tears came into her eyes, and
the dervis exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Of whom dost thou speak?"</p>

<p>"Of Giafar&mdash;of my husband," was the reply. "I
see him seldom now. His presence no more
cheers my solitude. His heart is estranged from
me; there are others more dear to him than his
wife&mdash;than I. If my face is pale, it is for this&mdash;it
is for this I sigh; and if the hot and bitter tears
scald my cheek as they fall, it is through grief for
his lost love."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

<p>"Believe it not. It cannot be," replied the
dervis. "I know thy husband well. I know
that his heart is thine, that thou alone hast
power over his soul, and that power is wide and
unlimited."</p>

<p>"Why, then, tell me, why is he ever from me?
Why does he linger in the harem, there, where the
fairest of the land are grouped together, and leave
me weeping at his absence?"</p>

<p>"Is this so, indeed?" exclaimed the old man.
"Is it for this thou grievest?"</p>

<p>"Even for this," replied Abassa. "And is not
this enough? What loss more sad could befall
me? I love him, I shame me not to confess. But
have I bestowed upon him my warmest affection,
to see it thrown aside as a thing worthless and
despised? I have given him my heart, and his
caprice and neglect have pierced it to the core. I
meant not to speak thus to thee. These sorrows
are mine alone, and I would share them with no
one. Speak not to me. Let me weep. Yet no,"
she exclaimed&mdash;here the natural pride of the princess's 
character broke forth, her cheek coloured,
and her eye flashed its fires&mdash;"I will not weep. I
<i>would</i> weep for him, if danger or distance separated
us; if death threatened, I would die for him; but
I will think no longer of one who has forsaken and
forgotten me."</p>

<p>"Be not thus disturbed," said the old man.
"Thou art deceived in thy thoughts of thy husband's 
affection. He still loves thee tenderly&mdash;nay,

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

'tis that very love which keeps him from thy presence. 
His wishes for thy welfare and thy peace
alone drive him from thy side, and make him seem
forgetful of thee. Do not doubt my words. I
have seen him often of late, and he is as sad and
careworn as thyself."</p>

<p>"Does sorrow indeed disturb his bosom as it
does mine own? Does he sigh thus bitterly, and
weep? Yet no&mdash;tears fall not upon the cheek of
man, even when the keenest pangs are rending his
soul. But he&mdash;is he sad? is he silent?"</p>

<p>"He is as I have never seen him till now. He
does not weep, as thou sayst, but his brow is ever
clouded by care and anxiety; he is insensible to
those pleasures which till now have well delighted
him; the beauties of the sky and field, mine own
poor converse, which once had influence over his
soul, is lost upon him. He wanders in solitude,
alone, tracking the sand with restless and unsteady
steps, and seems rather to avoid than seek my presence. 
Even as I speak, I see him passing among
the trees of yonder grove."</p>

<p>The dervis, as he said this, pointed to a group of
cypress and palm trees, that grew in a cluster, at
some distance from the cell. There, as he had said,
was Giafar, walking at an irregular pace beneath
the shade. His arms were crossed upon his bosom,
and at times his hands were pressed quickly, and
with apparent violence against his brow. He
paused for a moment, leaning his head against a
cypress, and then hurried quickly upon his path

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

his steps becoming gradually more and more slow,
until he became, as though unconsciously, motionless; 
then starting with an air of abstraction, he
buried himself hurriedly in the recesses of the
grove.</p>

<p>"Thou seest, my daughter," said the old man,
who had followed him with his finger, until he had
passed from their sight. "Is it not as I have told
thee?"</p>

<p>The princess had watched, with an intent gaze,
the gloomy and restless walk of her husband. The
pride and anger which had for a moment been
roused in her bosom vanished; the crimson with
which they had suffused her face disappeared, and
tears came into her eyes, marking her sympathy
and sorrow. "It is so," she exclaimed. "Yet why?&mdash;yet 
why&mdash;" and she wept still more profusely.</p>

<p>"Ask not, my daughter. His griefs, it may be,
are bitter as thine own. Add not, then, thy sorrows 
to the weight of those which already oppress
his bosom. Let him not see thee weep thus. Let
him not think that thou too art sad. This would
give tenfold sharpness to the arrows that are rankling 
in his soul."</p>

<p>"Why should it be thus, father? Why should
he shut his bosom against all sympathy from one
he loves? and why should not I, if I have grief,
share it with him. This would prove a solace to
us both. We were happy once&mdash;a few short days
have scarce passed, since I esteemed my lot most
fortunate, and fondly thought that fortune could
not snatch from me my joy, save in parting me

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

from him. Then, all pleasures that this earth
could offer seemed mine, and he partook them with
me. His presence lent a charm to every hour, and
rendered every enjoyment doubly pleasing. If
care intruded its unwelcome presence upon our
peaceful joys, ere it could cast a gloom upon our
hearts, 'twas banished by his sweet words and
smiles. Wherefore should not these days return?"</p>

<p>"They may," replied the old man. "Prudence
and duty, with a stern hand, are now keeping the
prince from thy beloved presence, and that hand
holds a scimitar within its grasp. Yet be not discouraged 
by the prospect of the many evils which
await thee on thy journey through this dreary life.
Be at peace. When the storm is fiercest, the sunshine 
may be struggling through the clouds. Above
all, cease not to love thy husband, although he for
a time deserts thee; cease not to value him as thou
oughtest."</p>

<p>"I will do so&mdash;ah, yes! Allah, who reads this
bosom, alone knows how dear he is to me."</p>

<p>"Well, comfort thee, my child. If in this world
some dark clouds intervene between us and that
happiness we think should be our own, this is the
lot of mortals. Yet it is but for a time. This
world is but the threshold, the porch and vestibule
unto another, where all sorrows will depart, and
happiness, untainted by the frailties of this clay,
shall be the lot of the resigned&mdash;(Moslem). Be
patient, then. Even if thou dost tarry a while in
sorrow here, there thou shalt gain uninterrupted
joy. This is a choice that is offered to all; to give

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

up this world for another and a better. Ponder well
upon it then."</p>

<p>"Yes, father, I can wait. Happiness, thou sayst,
will come at last."</p>

<p>"Heaven, my daughter, will be the reward of
those who, with a humble spirit, support, without
a murmur, the grief which the hand of Allah pours
down upon their heads. Lay aside thy care: be
not overcome by evils, which are but temporary,
for one day, every sorrow that thou now hast may
be changed into ten thousand joys, and thou wilt
but frame a wish, and the highest and purest blessings 
shall be thine."</p>

<p>"There is one, father, without whom I would
not&mdash;nay, I could not, be happy even there."</p>

<p>"Sin may sever the nearest ties," replied the
old man; "but those who do aright shall dwell together 
in paradise, and never go out from that
blessed abode."</p>

<p>Such consolation would the good old man administer 
to the trembling and griefworn princess.
But all his care seemed to be in vain. Though she
listened attentively to his words, and came again
and again to hearken to his counsel, yet her sorrows 
would not be removed. For a short time,
after an interview with the dervis, her brow would
seem lighter, and her bosom more at ease; but
again her griefs would return with redoubled keenness, 
and though none, save the venerable Ibrahim,
knew of their nature, or their depth, yet their influence 
upon her frame was becoming each day more
visible to all.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Who that hath felt that passion's power,
Or paused, or feared in such an hour?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Parisina</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Giafar</span> and Abassa were again together in the
kiosk. A silver basin of roses freshly culled was
near them. "How like thee, my life!" said the
prince, gazing fondly upon her.</p>

<p>"There are many here, my lord," replied Abassa,
with a mournful smile; "to which of them wouldst
thou liken me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I cannot choose; they are all beautiful."</p>

<p>"Thou comparest me, with truth, Giafar," responded 
the princess, complainingly, "to a single
rose in the group. Why didst thou not rather
bring me a solitary flower, and say, 'Behold thyself!' 
'Tis ill done, my lord; thou needst not show
me my rivals, if I have them."</p>

<p>"Thy rivals!" exclaimed the prince, with ardour.
"Thou hast none. Who can compare with thee
in beauty and in worth? Look! here is thine emblem," 
he continued, and having selected the most
beautiful rose in the vase, he isolated it from the
rest, by inverting over the flower a goblet of glass.</p>

<p>"Nay, this is flattery. Thou hast chosen the
loveliest," rejoined Abassa, and bending her head,

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

as she spoke, over the fragrant group, she inhaled,
with an expression of delight, the odour which their
leaves emitted.</p>

<p>"Their perfume is indeed pleasant," said the
prince; "but why hast thou neglected this, which
thou esteemest the loveliest of them all?"

"That one?" replied Abassa. "The goblet
encloses it. Its sweetness cannot penetrate beyond
that prison of glass."</p>

<p>"Is it not like thee, then?" said the prince. "Art
thou not with all thy loveliness enclosed as in a prison 
from me? Dost thou upbraid me, that I have
culled sweet flowers, when the sweetest and the
loveliest was beyond my reach? Thy rivals,
sayst thou? ah, no! thou art the only rose that I
prize; though wherefore should I?" he added, despondingly. 
"Why should I value a flower when
its fragrance is debarred me? Shall it be ever
thus? Let me loose the chains that bind thee.
Let me free thee, as I set free this flower." As
he said this, he struck the goblet with the signet
ring which he wore upon his finger, and it fell
crushed into many fragments, liberating the imprisoned 
rose, whose fragrance, collected during its
temporary confinement, was wafted quickly to their
senses. "Yes, let me free thee," he exclaimed,
"and love long repressed shall richly repay our
cares!"</p>

<p>"What dost thou mean, Giafar?" said the princess, 
striving to repress the crimson that was mantling 

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

her features. "What dost thou mean? I
understand thee not."</p>

<p>"Let me transplant thee to some green spot in
the desert, or to one of those remote islands which
our Indian pearl divers so often tell of. There
thou shalt be mine&mdash;alone, and for ever. No care
shall come near us, or if it come, love, with its
soft hand, shall stay the intruder, and banish him
afar. Affection shall wrap us together as in a mantle, 
and we will not heed, though we may hear,
the storm that blows rudely without. Come, wilt
thou not? I have wealth sufficient to purchase
all the pleasures that this world can offer. And
without these, even if daily toil were our portion,
together we could not fail of happiness. But oh!
what mockery is grandeur when love unblest
burns with its sharp fires in the soul!"</p>

<p>Drops fell from the lovely eyes of the princess
upon the unconscious flowers. Was it <i>they</i> had
stolen the colour from her cheek and lips? Something 
had, for her face was ashy pale, as, turning
to her husband, she replied, "Does not the bulbul
lament when the rose is torn from its stem? and
are there none to weep for me? I have a father
and a dear mother; shall I pour the cup of grief
into their souls? I cannot&mdash;I love them too well.
I would go with thee to the desert, or to those distant 
islands thou speakest of, if they are not fabulous&mdash;yes, 
as our dreams of happiness; but thou
knowest, Giafar, that I cannot steal thus away
from my parents. I cannot leave them lamenting
over a daughter's ingratitude. Thou couldst not

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

love me if I should. As to my rivals, believe me,
I think not of them." A deep flush passed over
her face as she spoke. "Forgive me! leave me!"</p>

<p>"Leave thee!" said the prince, drawing her tenderly 
towards him. "Say not so. I would make
thee mine indeed&mdash;mine, beyond the rude mandates 
of thy father's power. Has not the sacred
voice of religion and of Heaven bound us together?
Why, then, should the breath of man thus sever
us?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I will not listen to thee now," she exclaimed, 
shrinking with strange fear from his embrace. 
"To-morrow I will hear thee, but oh! not
now!"</p>

<p>A frown knit the prince's brow, and approaching
a low table which stood near, he poured out a bowl
of Shiraz, and quaffed it quickly. He then remained
for some moments silent and motionless, with his
hand pressed against his forehead. "Nay, set
down that goblet," said Abassa, as she saw him
about to repeat the draught; "or if thou wilt thus
sin, drink of the light Kismische, that will not
madden thee, that will not so steep thy senses in
forgetfulness."</p>

<p>"I <i>would</i> forget&mdash;myself, my sorrows, everything, 
even thee," was Giafar's reply, as he drained
to the last drop the sparkling wine. "Thou wilt
not listen to me, then, thou sayst?" he proceeded,
controlling his emotion by a strong effort; "yet
thou wilt, when I tell thee this&mdash;I think to leave
Bagdad&mdash;start not! thou canst not feel it more
than I. The future may yet have happiness in

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

store for us. I will obtain from thy father the
government of some distant province, the care of
which may occupy my thoughts, and enable me,
for a time at least, to forget thee. Yes, I will
leave thee a while, until fortune, in its vicissitudes,
shall reunite us under happier auspices."</p>

<p>"Leave me! Do not that, Giafar," she exclaimed,
in a tone approaching to agony. "Oh! no, no!&mdash;
you are not so cruel!&mdash;you will take me with
you!"</p>

<p>" 'Tis better for us both that we should part.
This strife of passion is wearing upon us both, and
imbittering our existence. The colour is fading
from thy cheek&mdash;thy health and spirits are daily
wasting, and for myself to live thus, near thee, is
impossible. I will not linger thirsting by the fountain, 
when I am forbidden to drink of its waters.
No, though they be tempting and fair to view,
were it the fount Cafur, that flows through paradise. 
Its stream is spicy and shining, yet to stand
upon its margin, wishing, but fearing to drink&mdash;'twere 
a torment worthy the crimes of Eblis&mdash;a
place deep within his dark dominion, methinks,
were better."</p>

<p>"Thou art mad, Giafar!" exclaimed the princess, 
"thy brain is turned by that accursed
draught."</p>

<p>"I feel it not," he replied. "I am not mad!&mdash;except 
to linger here be madness. Said I not, we
must part?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was in jest&mdash;'twas but to try my

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

love&mdash;say that it was so!&mdash;I can die, but thou
must not leave me! Allah, have mercy on me!&mdash;
I have life in none but thee," said the maiden, in
an extremity of anguish. "I will do anything.
To-night&mdash;this moment, I will fly with thee." She
buried her face in her robe and endeavoured to
resume her composure. "Ah me! I am a child.
I have no constancy, no fortitude, that I should
thus desert myself. Yet think well of it, Giafar,"
she continued, more calmly. "Shall we not be
happier if we return to our old and long-neglected
pursuits? Will not reason come once more to
strengthen us, and render to us our peace again?
Can we not forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is impossible," quickly interrupted the prince.
"Love, infinite love, has taken possession of my
soul. And, after all, what is the penalty?" he continued, 
as his arm encircled her trembling form, and his
voice assumed a strange sweetness&mdash;"what is the
penalty? It is not misery, torturing and long to
be endured&mdash;it is not what we have already suffered. 
No, it is but death, and that I know thou
wouldst welcome with me!" As he said this, the
prince pressed for the thousandth time her fair
hand to his lips. It was white as the snow upon
the mountains, yet not so cold&mdash;and soft as the
rich silken cushions that were strewn about the
chamber, upon one of which knelt Giafar before
the trembling, agitated princess. "Is it not so?&mdash;wouldst 
thou not welcome death with me?"</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;thou knowest that I would!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

<p>"Be mine, then&mdash;be mine!" He drew the half-fainting 
princess closely to his bosom, while she
sighed forth, "Speak not of&mdash;nay, speak of nothing 
to me <i>now</i>." Her head drooped helplessly
upon his shoulder, and the words, "Wilt thou <i>not</i>
leave me?" were murmured faintly in his ear.</p>

<p>The spirit of love has descended into the chamber, 
and is breathing his intoxicating perfume
around them. The air is burdened with it. Their
sighs, which but a moment since might have been
heard leaving their lips, now come heavily from
their bosoms, and fail to struggle through the hallowed 
atmosphere that surrounds them. Their
words&mdash;yes, there are yet a few&mdash;murmured, muttered, 
sighed&mdash;but so low that Echo cannot answer
them, or so sacred that she durst not. * *</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *<br/>

* * * * * * *<br/>

* * * * * *</p>

<p>Love, watch over thy votaries&mdash;keep far away
the noiseless step of mute. Let not the prying
eyes of Eastern jealousy trespass upon the sanctity
of thy reign; for a fearful price must be paid,
should suspicion reach the ear of a jealous monarch
that his power has been rivalled, his commands
annulled, even by a divinity so potent and universal 
as thine own. Shield and protect, for thou
hast betrayed them. Yet if thou canst not guard,
thou canst at least console the victims thou hast
made.</p>

<p class="stanza">But were it not that time their troubler is,
All that in this delightful garden grows
Should happy be, and have immortal bliss!
For here all plenty and all pleasure flows,
And sweet love gentle fits among them throws,
Without fell rancour or fond jealousy.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> lingers in the cell of the captive, and
hovers on leaden wing over the couch of the unfortunate, 
lengthening out with heedless cruelty
his woes; but he hurries happy lovers with his
swiftest flight. How widely seems nature to have
erred in this from her usual benevolence to mankind! 
Strange and unhappy law of our existence! 
Time creeps with the wretched, and flies
only with him who is happy, or him who sleeps.</p>

<p>Never did he speed so fast away as now, with
Giafar and his sweet bride. The shining pleasures 
which ride and glitter upon his wing, shaken

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

from their hold in his swift career, fell showering
everywhere around them. Words cannot express
the happiness of the prince, during the few months
which remained of that delightful summer. He
had tasted of love ere this, and deemed himself
happy in its enjoyment; yet cold and tame were
all past pleasures, compared with those which now
delighted him. Had paradise with its bright-eyed
damsels been waiting for him, sinful man! he
would have turned him from its proffers, and still
clung to earth and to his bride. And <i>she</i>, too, his
wife; the look of care which had so long clouded
her brow vanished. Peace once more took up
her long-deserted abode in her bosom, and joy and
gladness were again lighting up their smiles in
her lovely face. The buoyancy and brightness of
youth were again hers, chastened and subdued,
though at the same time rendered more enchanting 
by a shade of trusting dependance which
infused a sweet softness into her demeanour.
With him she loved once more constantly near
her, her every hope and wish seemed gratified.
She had shared his anxieties; his sorrows had
been hers; the gloom and depression which had
shrouded his spirit had cast their dark shadows
upon her own; and now the same sunlight of
hope and happiness was beaming on them both.</p>

<p>Happy creatures! all nature took a colour from
their own feelings, and seemed to be in ecstasy
around them. The air they breathed appeared to
be changed. The song of the nightingale was

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

more melodious, the fragrance of flowers sweeter,
their lute seemed to have gained a string, so much
the greater power had it to sooth their feelings.
Their favourite poets had a meaning and a charm
they had never felt before. A chilling restraint
seemed to be removed, which till now had marred
the happiness of every interview. Their mutual
relations were altered; all was now confidence
and perfect oneness. They had not now to fear
each other, or themselves; there was nothing to
be lost or gained, but must bring the same joy or
the same sorrow to them both.</p>

<p>They look back upon the past, as the wearied
traveller, from the cool shade of palm trees beneath 
which he is reposing, glances across the
bleak desert he has lately traversed. There he
breathed hot vapours which parch the lips and
burn upon the cheek; there the seraab enticed
him from his way, mocking him with the semblance 
of a lake, tempting his eager steps, but ever
fleeing at his approach. Here the air is balmy;
breathing through the trees, it is charged with
their fragrance&mdash;sighing over the fountain it partakes 
of its freshness. Here the living waters
shrink not as he advances, but proffer to his lips
their grateful welcome. Over a waste so desolate
and weary, they had passed to this green island
in the desert, and lost in its paths, they think not
of to-morrow&mdash;they think not how short must be
their stay. They are like children in a gay garden, 
culling fruits and flowers, and revelling in

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

the luxuriance of nature's bounty; they look not
to the horizon's edge, to see if a storm gathers
there; that deep yet indistinct muttering they
heed not; they will not know that it is thunder;
and when it speaks in tones too plain to be mistaken, 
they start into each other's arms, yet still
mutually linger, until the tempest with its red
lightnings and its thunders breaks in fury over
their heads, and flight is vain. Allah Bismillah, 
who controls the elements, may they find
shelter!</p>

<p>Days of warmth and sunshine were these, but
the cold moon reigned at night, and when its shadows 
darkened around, they parted; for many as
the stars of evening are the eyes that, Arguslike,
watch within the precincts of the prince's palace.
When they separated it was cheerfully, and to
meet upon the morrow; even sleep brought them
in its visions again together, and in dreams they
rested sweetly, each by the other's side.</p>

<p>But it would be superfluous to dilate on the
happiness of the young pair. Many know&mdash;all
can imagine&mdash;who can forget the full blessedness,
the unmingled rapture of those who, despite obstacles 
that seemed insurmountable, are joined at
last in love's closest bands. Earth has its joys as
well as heaven. Allah be praised, who is the
maker of them both! He is merciful, and this
world is not so barren, so destitute of delight, as
the lessons of many a cynic would persuade.</p>

<p>Many there are in the world, who, when sorrow

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

is present or danger threatens them, fly to Heaven
for aid, and from the mouths of its servants seek
that consolation, that protection, for which they
look elsewhere in vain. Yet when the woe or the
peril is past, they cast aside the staff of their support 
and the shield of their defence. Ingrates
and improvident are they; they retain not in their
hearts the memory of kindness, and forget that
ills crowd thick upon the path of life; that danger
passed should be as a beacon to warn us of its
future approach, and direct us to a shelter. The
piety of Abassa was far different from this. Even
in the intoxication of her happiness, she forgot not
the good old Ibrahim. In hours of trial, when
her bosom had been agitated by passions, strange
and stormy, and had been shaken, as is the light
tamarind leaf by the desert blast, then had she
often sought the presence of the dervis. The
leaf is at rest, or if it stirs 'tis but a summer's
breeze, fragrant and from the land of spices, that
agitates its repose; and now, when peace has
returned to her bosom, shall she forget him whose
counsel strengthened, and whose kindness consoled 
her in the time of trial? Not so; or when
the sky changes, and winter comes, whither shall
she turn?</p>

<p>When the recluse next saw the princess, he was
struck with the alteration which had taken place
in her appearance. He called to mind the pale
and trembling maiden, who at their last interview
had looked to his arm for support, and to his wisdom 

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

for solace. He now gazed upon her, and saw
that her eye was bright, her step elastic, her voice
cheerful; and he marvelled at the change. Her
sorrows seemed to have vanished, as at the touch
of an enchanter's wand vanish the phantoms of his
art's creation.</p>

<p>Has she sought in the remote East, where, as
many say, flows a fountain rich with the treasures
of immortality, which imparts eternal youth to
him who happily tastes of its waters?&mdash;has she
found and drunk of this stream? If the Eastern
legend tells true, though the great Iskander (Alexander) 
sought this spot in vain, yet his vizier,<sup><a id="r013" href="#n013">13</a></sup>
more fortunate than himself, reached its banks,
and took "at long draughts" of its divine waters.
To those who give credence to the fable, it were
easy to explain the mystery of Abassa's returning
youth and beauty. But many doubts had the
good dervis of the existence of that fountain, and
of its power to fill or freshen this once-mingled
cup of mortality. He well knew, however, of that
peace of mind which religion can impart, of that
fortitude and patience with which soothing friendship 
can strengthen the sorrowing bosom. He
called to mind his last interview with the princess,
when his lips dropped with the honey of wisdom,
and when he poured the balm of consolation into
her wounded soul, and the enigma seemed explained. 
He gazed with delight upon her countenance, 
radiant as it was with happiness, and in
the pride of his heart he would have spoken to her

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

in words of approbation and encouragement&mdash;but
the blushes of the princess undeceived him. The
riddle was read, and the sage thoughtful and
silent.</p>

<p>But one thing was wanting to complete their
happiness. This was the friendship of the calif;
and as if Heaven meant to grant their utmost
wishes, the Commander of the Faithful returned
from Raccah, and received them again into favour.
The strange scene that had occurred on the evening 
of his daughter's nuptials seemed entirely
effaced from his remembrance; its traces were
no longer visible in the countenance or demeanour
of the calif; all was buried in silence, if not in oblivion. 
Giafar, who was, even in the Eastern acceptation 
of the word, the faithful friend as well
as servant of his master, had looked upon the
estrangement of his affection as one of the greatest
evils that could befall him. These evidences, therefore, 
of the calif's returning love, failed not to fill
his bosom with delight. If at times he distrusted
the unvarying calmness that was visible in his
master's countenance, fearing lest it were a mask
covering dark suspicion, yet oftener he banished
all uneasiness from his mind, and gave himself up
without reserve to the full anticipation of returning 
fortune.</p>

<p>Nor was the happiness of the princess less than
Giafar's, to find her father again kind. She loved
him with an affection, only to be surpassed by that
which she felt towards her husband; and now, what

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

could she ask from Heaven? All she wished was
hers. It is true, the presence of Haroun placed
upon them a restraint, at times, irksome and hard
to be endured. Great vigilance and self-control
were needed lest some sudden impulse, some unwary 
yet most natural display of tenderness should
disclose to the calif all that it was most necessary
to conceal. Yet it may be questioned, if this very
constraint, which felt at times like a chain of iron
upon them, did not heighten and render more delicious 
their hours of retirement.</p>

<p>Such is man! Pleasure that is debarred him,
or that flies from his pursuit, he ever values the
most highly. The enchanted castle and dames
there imprisoned appear rich and beautiful only
to the knight without, who must win them from
the arms of danger. When the barriers which
excluded him are surmounted by his valour, bleak
walls and withered hags alone remain, of all the
charms that enticed him to the perilous deed.</p>

<p>The report of the calif's reconciliation to his
children went abroad throughout Bagdad; and the
sight of his well-known barge, as it passed to and
fro upon the river, stopping with unvarying regularity 
at the prince's villa, confirmed the rumour.
Giafar's abode was now the frequent scene of
splendour and festivity. His brightly lighted gardens 
shone afar. Charming voices and instruments
of music threw their tones across the waters, sounding 
upon the ears of the envious and disappointed,
as the angels' song in paradise, when heard by

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

those malignant fiends who are debarred for ever
from its enjoyment. Again he was sought, again
courted. Coming together as they are wont, fortune 
and the world's favour again revisited his
dwelling.</p>

<p>Moments thus passing, what should disturb them
in the possession of such enjoyment? Nothing,
unless some thought of the future should be the
unwelcome intruder. But they sought not to know
its secrets. Surrounded by pleasure, as with the
drapery of a curtain, they wisely abstained from
looking beyond its folds. Fortune, like a kind host,
has sweetly lodged them in the fairest chamber of
nature's spacious caravansary. Why should they
peer through the closed lattice, or question the
mute hours that wait upon them, if their journey
on the morrow will be rough or no? Repose, repose, 
even till the trumpet's* sound shall rouse the
travellers to their onward way.</p>

<p class="small">[*A trumpet usually sounds at daybreak to arouse the caravan 
for its journey.]</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">E'en so my sun one early mom did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out! alack! he was hut one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now;
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain, when Heaven's sun staineth.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sighs</span> are heard in the harem, and bright eyes
are looking in vain for him who is the sun of their
narrow world. Fair forms, each of which would
grace a throne, are walking disconsolately through
latticed galleries, or adown the shaded avenues
that wind through those extensive grounds. They
meet, perchance, and smile at each other's grief,
though weeping for their own. All is one universal
sorrow. The bower of love is faded, and the
tears of its beautiful guardians water its withered
roses, though they fail to freshen or revive them.
But 'tis soon over. Except in a few souls sensitive 
and peculiarly constituted, love unreturned is of
brief duration. Amusements, or the more serious
occupations of life, soon usurp that place in the
bosom which, a while gone, seemed destined to be
occupied by ceaseless and powerful passion. Emulation 
in dress and jewels, the care of singing birds,
music and the bath, soon become the pleasures of

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

these beautiful prisoners. Their faces are again
like the day, and their eyes tearless.</p>

<p>Stay! there is one who yet weeps, who cannot
so soon forget him she has lately learned to love.
'Tis a sweet girl from the vales of Khorasan.</p>

<p>The poverty or avarice of her parents had rendered 
Khatoun a slave, and fortune gave her a kind
master in Prince Giafar. Fifteen warm summers
had ripened the wild flower, when in the perfection 
of her loveliness, she was transplanted into the
garden of the prince. She had been reared in the
shade, and had never enjoyed that culture which
is only to be acquired by an intercourse with polished 
and artificial society. She had not been
taught either to control or conceal her emotions,
nor when passion swelled her bosom to wear a face
of calmness. A child of nature, tender, sensitive,
and variable, she was now wrapped in an ecstasy of
delight, and now trembled and wept like a very
infant, when misfortune or its dark forebodings
came upon her.</p>

<p>When she first entered the palace of Giafar, no
inmate of that abode was happier than Khatoun.
She had left and regretted no humble lover in her
own land, whose image might follow her to these
new scenes of her existence, to trouble the repose
which for a long time she here enjoyed. Separation 
from her parents she had been taught from
childhood to expect, and so long and so often had
she anticipated that event, that its occurrence
formed no new era in her life or feelings, from

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

whence she might date the commencement of joys
or sorrows. Splendour of dress, the attendance
and flattery of slaves, with all the various luxuries
which were here at her disposal, contributed in no
small degree to banish from her mind the thoughts
of her old home. Besides these, in the instructions
of the various masters who were appointed to superintend 
her education, she found an unvaried
source of delight. A new world was here opened
to her view, one of poetry, music, and literature,
and she improved with avidity those advantages
which the liberality and pride of the prince placed
within the reach of every inmate of the zenana.
Alas! that so fair a sky should e'er be o'ercast,
that so bright a sun should be obscured by foul
vapours that rise reeking from the unhallowed soil
of human passions!</p>

<p>When Giafar fled from the enchantment of the
princess's presence, worn by care, and harassed by
a perpetual conflict between love and fear, he
sought among the wit and beauty of his harem to
divert his thoughts, for a time at least, from the
contemplation of loveliness which might not be his,
but at great peril. He could not forget Abassa
for a moment, yet he hoped that the fascinations
which here surrounded him, like the harp of the
minstrel, might sooth the demon Disappointment, if
it could not expel him from his bosom. Even in
this expectation, however reasonable it may seem,
he was deceived. The image of his wife was everywhere 
before him; soon tired of all the world, he
sought again her dear but dangerous society.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

<p>For a short period, Khatoun was his favourite.
Her simplicity and inexperience interested him;
her rapid progress in various accomplishments
charmed and delighted him. He himself taught
her upon the lute, and the lessons which she learned
from him were ever the best remembered. He
taught her to love too&mdash;that she never forgot. How
could she resist his accomplishments&mdash;his talents?
She had dreamed of such a lover; but to find him
hers was a consummation of her wishes, unexpected,
irresistible. She yielded to the charm, and surrendered 
her soul to the current of impetuous love.
'Twas but a leaf upon its eddying surface.</p>

<p>Giafar knew not the flame he was enkindling.
He knew not that love, which visited his withered
heart as drops of rain fall upon the arid desert,
leaving it barren as before, was shedding its influence 
upon her fresh young bosom, like a shower
upon an enclosed garden, and therein were springing 
up wild hopes, strange fears, and a thick succession 
of jealousies, griefs, and bitter disappointments. 
Had he known this, had he been aware of
the existence of that burning love and anxiety
which he was awaking in her soul, he would have
paused, he would have hesitated, ere for his idle
and transient pleasure, he destined a maiden so
innocent to a life of sorrow. But he thought not
of it. He stooped heedlessly to the violet, as he
crossed the garden; but its sweetness is forgotten
now that he has plucked the rose, and he remembers

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

not that his lips have left upon the humble flower
an impress that is blighting all its beauties.</p>

<p>"What can keep him from me?" murmured the
sad girl. "Why did he ever come to me, if he
meant to leave me thus? Ah! there is no happiness 
for a slave," she added, dejectedly. "If I
might die&mdash;yes, I should be at peace in the grave&mdash;there, 
at least, I should forget him. But he <i>will</i>
come, I am <i>sure</i> he will&mdash;and then he will be mine
again." She smiled at the thought, and turned to
look into her mirror. It reflected faithfully her
beauty, and her full bosom heaved with hope as
she gazed. "Yes, he may be mine again. There!
there!" she continued, as she arranged her ornaments, 
and added jewel after jewel to her apparel,
"is not that beautiful? But he values not jewels
nor dress; foolish creature that I am, he has told
me so a thousand times. Off! off!" she said, and
she would have divested her person of the ornaments, 
but her eye caught again for a moment her
mirrored beauty, and she desisted, adding, "yet
no!&mdash;let them remain, for they <i>are</i> beautiful." She
paused a few moments, and then continued, "He
may be mine again. He may&mdash;yet I have waited
long, till my bosom is weary with sighing for him.
I cannot help it. I shall always think upon him
while this poor brain can think&mdash;'twill not be long,
I fear, unless I see him soon. Yon bird is ever
singing," she continued, as the wild warbling of a
feathered favourite interrupted her sad musings;
"I cannot bear that note&mdash;it mocks my misery.

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

Yet 'tis alone, it has no mate, poor thing! how can
it be so happy?"</p>

<p>She approached, and threw a silken scarf over
the cage. When his prison was thus darkened,
the little warbler, after a few wavering notes, was
silent.</p>

<p>"Yet once," she continued, "I could listen to
that song for ever. I have changed since then&mdash;ah 
me! how I have changed." Tears were coursing 
fast down her cheeks. She dashed them
away, as the west wind shakes the dew from the
red leaves of the rose, and having taken her lute,
sang the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have told my burning heart a hundred times
to quench in the waters of forgetfulness the fires
that consume it.</p>

<p>"It listens not to my words, but courts still the
winds which increase its flame.</p>

<p>"Love's thousand torments will at last reduce
it to ashes."</p>

<p>The words seemed to come from her very soul.
When she had concluded her song, she placed her
hand beneath her bosom, there where the pulsations 
of the heart may easiest be felt, as if to assure
herself that the wearied organ had not yet ceased
to beat. No, it was still busy, but its hurried and
tumultuous motion threatened soon to impair its
energies, unless some balm were found that might
heal the griefs which were wearing upon her
spirits.</p>

<p>"Ravisher of hearts!" she exclaimed, apostrophizing 

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

thus tenderly the absent prince&mdash;"ravisher
of hearts! whither hast thou fled? Into what ears
are thy lips now whispering? Whom dost thou
now render happy? Yet I can bear it for a while,
if he will but return at last. I will not even complain, 
unless he leaves me for ever. Perhaps 'tis
his princess keeps him from me; yes, it must be
so. They tell me she is very beautiful. How can
I expect him to love me?&mdash;<i>me!</i> He should not
then have told me that he did. I was happy,"
continued the fond girl, with a sigh, "<i>very</i> happy,
until he came and spoke to me of beauty and love;
yes, and then I remember some bright, bright days.
Allah help me! I speak of them as past&mdash;yes, they
have passed away, and all is now night around
me. Yet have I been to blame? Now that I
know his falsehood, could I resist him? How,
then, could I keep my heart when he first asked it
of me? when he gave me for it, as he said, his
own. Yet I should have known it could not last.
Cruel one!" she exclaimed, in the words of a
favourite song, "whene'er I write thy name, I will
write false, unkind, faithless!" Bitter grief now
overwhelmed her, and sunk in despondency, she
wept profusely and in silence.</p>

<p>But tears are of no avail. Time passes. The
mild moon has completed her course, and, as
though wearied with looking upon the sorrows of
Khatoun, has left the heavens. Still Giafar comes
not. Despair and rage now mingle themselves
with regretting love, and throng successively upon

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

her bosom, tossing it into a tempest. If a ray of
hope shone upon her, it was transient as the lightning's 
flash, and seemed to render more apparent
the gloom with which she was surrounded. Often
did she weep, and walk her chamber distractedly;
often did she ponder upon the means to bring back
the truant. A butterfly, a bird, a jewel, were all
she had ever contended for before, but now a heart
was the prize, and she would not tamely surrender
it. Talismans are sought, charms woven, and all
species of enchantment are put in requisition, that
have power to recall a wandering lover. 'Tis in
vain. The more potent spell of beauty and of
love is chaining Giafar fast by the side of the Princess 
Abassa.</p>

<p>Such is life! Joys and sorrows follow each
other in constant and ever-varying succession.
The sun of happiness, though it always shines, cannot 
at once enlighten this ever-revolving orb, but
while it here tinges it with the bright hues of day,
there the night of sorrow darkens upon its surface.
Peace, visiting the unfortunate, leaves the happy,
and all are in their turn miserable. So flowers
drop one by one in the garden. "While the budding 
rose puts freshly forth its beauties, its companions, 
whose leaves were but now fully expanded,
have in a moment withered; we see them already
scattered in the dust." Life and beauty, ever departing, 
hover ever upon the flowers, and though
they often change their resting place, still dwell
always within the bower.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"We were too happy to be so long;
We were so blest in our lonely bower;
But the storm hangs over the sunniest hour,
And the serpent follows the sweetest song."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> close of summer is at hand. Giafar and
Abassa stand by the river's edge, upon the marble
steps which descend into its bosom. They are
watching the calif's barge, which has just departed. 
Its way is slow, for the rapid waters of the
river oppose its course; yet the nervous arms of
half a score of slaves overcome the fury of the
stream, and gradually propel the boat against the
current. They shun the full tide of the river, and
steal close along the shore, their oars at times
crashing amid the reeds that grow along its margin. 
Now they proceed with ease and celerity,
as they strike into some eddy that is favourable to
their progress, and now labour on with imperceptible 
motion, as they head round some jutting point
by which the river rushes with straightened and
impetuous current.</p>

<p>"He is gone!" broke from the lips of both simultaneously. 
"That point has hid him from our
sight," added the prince. The distance between
them soon diminishes, and Giafar is now close at

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

the princess's side. They look again to see if the
calif is indeed beyond their view, and satisfied of
this, the cold and indifferent demeanour which
they have worn during Haroun's presence is laid
aside. Blithely together they ascend from the
water's edge, and Giafar's arm supports the person
of the princess. Upon the topmost step they again
turn, and look with care along the course of the
stream. No object meets their eyes. They now
dismiss their fears, and walk slowly among the
spreading trees. They stop where the roses cluster 
thickly, and reposing under the shade of curtained 
flowers, discourse sweetly together.</p>

<p>"How kind is my father now," said the princess.
"All that jealousy and distrust with which he
formerly looked upon us is banished from his
bosom."</p>

<p>"It may be so," replied the prince; "yet I put
not faith in the seeming of man's countenance. I
know the craft of the calif, and the ready art with
which he can conceal the most deadly designs under 
an exterior of mildness."</p>

<p>"Your suspicions are unjust," said the princess.
"I am sure they are unjust. All traces of his anger 
have vanished. He seems as kind, nay, kinder
than ever."</p>

<p>"Kinder than ever!" said the prince. "You
have noted that then? So has it seemed to me,
although I knew not but that anxiety might, in
some degree, have given rise to my suspicions.
When, even in his mildest moments, was your father 

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

free from bursts of passion? yet weeks have
passed away of late, and not a frown has ruffled
his brow; an expression of unvarying, and, as I
fear, assumed mildness, is always upon his countenance. 
Augurs this well? Believe me, no! I
like not this unaccustomed kindness. Trust me,
my life, thy father nourishes suspicions which, if
confirmed, will not fail to destroy us. I would not
wrong him even in mine own thoughts; still less
would I disquiet your bosom by idle and ill-founded 
fears; but to guard against danger, is it not
most necessary to be aware of its approach? I
have crossed the desert when the simoom has been
at hand, yet to the careless traveller no tokens
could be seen of its approach. Not the slightest
breeze, forerunning that dread blast, disturbed the
lurid and murky air. Nature seemed motionless.
The parched earth endured, without a struggle, all
the cruelty that the fierce tyrant of the sky could
inflict upon her. At these signs I have turned my
horse's head towards a shelter, for I knew full well
that the fatal tempest was near. Had I despised
these warnings, and tarried until the angry wind
had waked the waste from its sleep, and the earth
in despair had shaken the desert from her bosom as
though she would hurl its mountains of eddying
sand into the face of her pitiless tormentor&mdash;had I
waited for this, my bones would ere now have been
whitening the plain."</p>

<p>"I still think, Giafar, that the danger of which
you speak exists but in your own fears; yet, grant

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

that it were at hand, what could we do that might
avert it?"</p>

<p>"Much, in truth," replied the prince. "Let us
beware of ourselves, let us watch with care over
our own actions, lest, in some unguarded moment,
we should betray that&mdash;" The sentence was interrupted 
and concluded by a kiss, yet it seemed
intelligible to the princess, for she coloured slightly,
and replied, "Have we not done this? What
has occurred, either in word or look, that might
strengthen my father in his anger?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my life, in any manner," said the
prince; "yet still how hard is it&mdash;I speak but for
myself, when I say it&mdash;how hard is it to control
those feelings which are swelling in the bosom.
What resolution, what firmness, does it not require
to repress, in the calif's presence, those acts of tenderness 
and of love, that would render but too
plain our disobedience to his commands. Did the
most ravishing music fall upon mine ear, my countenance 
should evince no tokens of pleasure: I
could seem insensible to rare perfumes, though
their sweet fragrance were steeping my senses in
delight. I could view unmoved, even when worn
with famine, a banquet of delicious viands, as
though I had just risen, sated with its enjoyment.
All these were easy of performance: as trials of
my self-control I should smile at them. But, dearest, 
'tis no slight task to seem unmoved when with
thee. When we look together upon some beautiful 
object, as we did upon that rich emerald to-day,

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

how hard is it to prevent my cheek from pressing
close to thine? when I stand by thy side I am
tempted, almost irresistibly, to clasp thee to my
bosom, even while thy frowning father looks in
anger upon us. Yet, it is possible&mdash;it may be
done," he added, pressing his hands forcibly over
his eyes, as though by that action he could assist
the resolution which he felt to waver at the bare
thought of the trial. "But we will talk no longer
of it," he continued, after a short silence; "let us
enjoy the happiness that we have, without thinking
upon the chances which may deprive us of it. It
is idle, it is useless, to look at the chain that is
thrown over us. Let us conceal it with roses.
And after all, the stealth and secrecy which hide
our love from all eyes, are to me no abatement of
its charm; nay, they heighten, and render it more
enchanting. What treasure do we more value
than one which every moment may be snatched
from our possession?"</p>

<p>"I grieve to hear you speak thus, Giafar," replied
the princess, reproachfully. "I could almost weep
to think that the love which you evince for me if
owing in any degree to the difficulties which have
opposed it. Can it be? If they were removed,
if all things smiled upon us, would your love in
aught diminish? If so, I pray Allah for the frowns
of my father as I would for a blessing most dear!"</p>

<p>"Talk not thus," interrupted the prince, impatiently. 
"Think not thus of my affection. Thou
esteemest it as a light thing, if thou canst say this.

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

Wert thou an angel, far above my reach or my
hopes, I would worship and adore thee; and wert
thou a slave, bought with my gold (it is profanity
to think it), yet wert thou subject to my slightest
wishes, not the less would my heart, my happiness,
be in thy hands. No time nor change can diminish
my love. Yet our stolen interviews are sweeter
to me thus, and the happiness that I possess in thee
is more enchanting, since I hold it at such peril."</p>

<p>"Man," replied Abassa, "runs his round of pleasures, 
and wearied of them all, like the spoiled child,
desires only that which is forbidden him. Why
should opposition and difficulty be ever the chief
charms for him? In war, the hazard of the attempt
may lure, more than the value of the prize&mdash;when
glory is the mistress she is to be wooed thus&mdash;must 
it be so in love?"</p>

<p>"Oh! there is a pleasure to the bold spirit, to
tread upon the verge of danger, to walk safely and
firmly where the trembling limbs of his fellow-men
would refuse to support them; there is a triumph
in it and a pride, such as the eagle feels, methinks,
when be soars upward to the sun, and gazes on
him as no other bird would dare. Feelings like
these mingle themselves even with our love."</p>

<p>"It is not so with woman," replied the princess.
"She may be true in danger, but she ever wishes
it far away. For me, I would enjoy my happiness
in peace, nay, even in obscurity."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest over confidently, my life," returned 
the prince. "Thy reason, thine experience,

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

cannot teach thee this; thou listenest to thy heart
alone&mdash;it may deceive thee. Were we away in
some safe retreat where the winds of fortune could
not blow upon us, and whence our happiness could
no more escape, wouldst thou then love me as thou
now dost? wouldst thou not wish, at times, for
these very fears, these trials which now surround
us, that they might vary the dull sameness of quiet
and unalarmed affection?"</p>

<p>"Thy words are strange, Giafar," replied the
princess. "I should not&mdash;oh, no! how canst thou
think thus? Love in retirement, and with thee,
would compose my highest happiness, and thy
presence supply the loss of all the world."</p>

<p>Their lips met, and he would have pressed her
more closely to his bosom, had not a slight movement 
amid the trelliswork of flowers which surrounded 
them made him pause. Giafar's countenance, 
however, did not change, neither did he turn
his eye to the direction from whence the sound
came. He seemed not to notice the interruption;
and a warning glance admonished the princess to
be equally prudent. For a time they continued
their gay and delightful discourse; he withdrew
not his arm which he had passed around the princess's 
waist, and she, although trembling with fear,
shrank not from his embrace; both seemed equally
and entirely unaware of the presence of an intruder. 
After a few moments, however, they arose,
and proceeded slowly together towards their favourite 
kiosk.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

<p>While walking thither, the prince had leisure to
conjecture rapidly as to the nature and cause of
the intrusion upon their privacy, and also to adopt
some method by which he might promptly, and
with certainty, free himself from the impending
danger. Some one had set an espial upon them.
Who could it be, and who was the traitor that had
dared to undertake so dangerous an office? None
but his own household slaves ever entered this garden, 
and the few who, since his marriage, had been
employed in the various duties within its walls,
were chosen for their tried fidelity. Besides, they
were never absent from the palace, and could hold
no communication with any who might wish
to employ them as instruments of their master's
ruin. "Yet," thought the prince, "a stranger
would hardly venture hither; unacquainted with
the grounds and the strict regulations with which
they are kept, such temerity were certain to be
punished with death." But whatever doubts he
had as to the instrument, he had few as to the origin
of the treachery. Upon this point all his suspicions
were directed to the Commander of the Faithful.
He could not mistake. No one but he would have
dared thus to intrude upon his domestic privacy,
or have ventured upon an expedient so dangerous
for accomplishing this purpose.</p>

<p>They were now at the kiosk. As they ascended
the steps leading to their favourite apartment, Giafar 
pressed the hand of the princess encouragingly, 
and whispered, "Compose thyself, dearest.

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

Let no word or look escape thee, which may betray
thy fears. Sing, laugh, and be gay, as thou art
wont. Our safety may depend upon thy firmness."</p>

<p>They entered. Abassa seated herself upon the
rich carpet, while the prince, with an affectation of
gallantry, handed her various sweetmeats and fruits
from a low table, serving them upon one knee, after
the manner of a slave. Each time that he presented 
her with a dish of fruit, or a bowl of sherbet,
he kissed her hand with great tenderness, as also
when they were returned to him after she had partaken 
of their contents.</p>

<p>When they had finished a light repast, the princess, 
at Giafar's request, sang a few verses to her
lute, which were followed on the part of the prince
by a profusion of thanks and applause. He then
took the lute from her hand, and after striking a
few preparatory chords, complained that the instrument 
was false, and under the pretence of seeking
one better attuned, left the chamber and entered
an adjoining apartment.</p>

<p>He opened the lattice in haste, and holding fast
his scimitar, lest in alighting its clash should betray
him, swung lightly to the ground. He then proceeded 
around the kiosk, and ascended the balustrade 
on the opposite side of the building.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say whether surprise or
indignation predominated in the prince's bosom,
when, upon advancing, he perceived one of his
own and most trusty slaves in the act of looking
through the lattice which opened upon his private
retreat. It may be that astonishment first took

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

possession of his soul, but it soon gave place to
fierce and uncontrollable anger. His eyes flashed
fire, and the blood mounted into his forehead. He
approached noiselessly, for he had put off his sandals
ere ascending the steps, and when within
reach of the culprit drew his scimitar. The sound
of the weapon in starting from its sheath caused
the wretch to turn. Horror was depicted upon
his countenance when he found himself in the
presence of his angry master; he would have entreated, 
his lips had parted, but no sound issued
from them. The arm of the prince descended
quickly, and ere a word was uttered, the shining
steel had encircled his neck. The blade was
sharp and trenchant, and dexterously applied upon
neck of the unhappy man, for the arm that
wielded it was well accustomed to the work, and a
wild whirlwind of fierce passions had lent to it a
strength even greater than its own. Yet, for a
brief moment, the blow seemed to have failed of
its effect, and Giafar read in the convulsed and still
upright countenance of the slave, all that despair
and agony can imprint upon human features. One
instant, and the tall form of the hapless wretch
stood erect before the flashing eye of his master,
the head<sup><a id="r014" href="#n014">14</a></sup> still resting as in life upon his shoulders;
the next, a thrill, a shudder, a fearful spasm, passed
across that ghastly face, and the slave fell heavily
to the floor; the head then parting from the
shoulders, rolled to the very feet of the young
prince, while from the shorn and palpitating trunk
the dark blood spouted forth in streams, staining

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

with its crimson those walls which had been so
long held sacred to love and pleasure.</p>

<p>"So, Hassan, is it thou!" said the prince, as he
looked down upon the face of the dead slave, which
he had turned upward with the point of his scimitar.
Life had not yet entirely deserted the head, and
its features seemed to shrink at the frown of Giafar.
This emotion exhausted the last remains of fleeting
vitality, and death settled quickly upon the countenance, 
binding its lineaments in fixed and awful
rigidity.</p>

<p>"The drama has commenced," continued the
prince. "Where will it end, and what victims are
yet to fall? Thou art the first, and justly so.
Who can have tempted thee to this? Can gold
have bribed thee to betray thy master? I cannot
credit it. An hour ago I would have deemed my
life as safe with thee as in the hands of a brother.
Yet wherefore should I wonder? Am not <i>I</i> a
traitor? is not my plighted word broken? is not the
pledge to my master forfeited, and am not I trembling 
even this instant lest vengeance overtake me?
Yet have I not some excuse for my fault? If I have
wandered, are not the eyes bright and the smiles
sweet that have lured me from my path? and by this
right hand, I would so wander again to be so repaid."</p>

<p>After this soliloquy, Giafar stooped to wipe his
scimitar upon the garments of the dead slave, and
having returned it to its sheath, proceeded to search
his person for some token which might reveal the
author of the treason. In his bosom he found a
purse containing a few sequins, together with some

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

ornaments which appeared to have been the property 
of a female. Among them he discovered a turquoise 
ring. As though he had gazed upon a basilisk, 
his looks for a few moments became fixed upon
the jewel. He knew it. It had been his own gift.
He started hastily to his feet, his countenance
darkened, and biting his lips in anger, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"In mine own harem! Traitress! but she shall
dearly rue her falsehood. By the right hand of the
Prophet! she shall pay for it with her life. Yet
can she have stooped so low?" he continued, after
a momentary silence; "can she have descended
thus to the vilest slave's affection? Yes, 'tis plain!
'tis plain! It was not gold that tempted Hassan
from his duty. It was not these jewels. No! no!
I see it now. I thought a richer treasure, one more
enticing, must have lured him to this treachery. I
can almost forgive him. But that <i>she</i>, whom I
esteemed so innocent and pure, whom I have
kindly treated and favoured, nay, almost loved, to
dishonour me! and with a slave! She shall die!"
he exclaimed, stamping with his foot in fury&mdash;"she
shall die ere morning dawns!"</p>

<p>Giafar was unable to regain immediately that
composure with which he wished to appear before
the princess, for his bosom was rent by passion.
He descended from the balcony into the garden,
and lingering a while in the open air, strove to
repress his agitation. When he had acquired
some degree of calmness, he again sought the
presence of his wife.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">This is above all strangeness!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lear</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> princess had been awaiting his return with
an anxiety that she could ill subdue; and as his
stay was more and more prolonged, her suspense 
became almost insupportable. When, however, 
Giafar entered with a pale and frowning
countenance, when she saw stains of blood upon
his caftan, and upon his hands, her fears overcame
her. She had sufficient strength to throw herself
into his arms, but the words which she would have
framed died away upon her lips. Even in the
agitation of his bosom, torn as it was by anger,
jealousy, and wounded pride, Giafar found words
of comfort for her. "Fear not! dearest life," he
said; "all has gone well. The danger is past."</p>

<p>"What means this?" exclaimed Abassa, when
she could find words, pointing as she spoke to the
blood upon his garments. "What hast thou done?"</p>

<p>"Done!" replied the prince, with difficulty suppressing 
his anger&mdash;" 'tis nothing. I have chastised
a prying slave&mdash;believe me! nothing more."</p>

<p>"I fear thou hast been rash in this, Giafar&mdash;thou
art over hasty in thine anger."</p>

<p>"Hasty!" replied the prince, setting his teeth

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

firmly together; "think not so. Had he a hundred
lives, they had all been forfeited. Yet I should
have punished them together."</p>

<p>"Whom?" inquired Abassa.</p>

<p>"The traitor and the traitress, both by the same
ignoble death, 'Twas ill done, to defile my scimitar 
with blood so base."</p>

<p>"Whom dost thou speak of?" interrupted the
princess&mdash;"comes not this danger from my father?"</p>

<p>"No, the falsehood exists in mine own palace,
within the walls of my very harem. I meant not
to tell thee of it, for it concerns that which I would
myself forget, and which may&mdash;yet it cannot&mdash;disturb 
and displease <i>thee</i>." Giafar then related to
the princess his discovery of Hassan's treachery,
and the token by which he traced the origin of his
unfaithfulness to a once favourite inmate of the
harem. He spoke with some hesitation of his
transient interest in the young Khatoun, but recounted 
more fully her apparent devotion, innocence, 
and simplicity; then, with compressed lip
and bent brow, he imparted to her his suspicions,
that through jealousy and desire of revenge she had
betrayed his honour to a slave, and expressed his
firm determination to punish her guilt with death,
and ended by pointing with his finger significantly
to the Tigris.</p>

<p>The countenance of the princess reddened for a
moment as she listened, but became deadly pale
again, as this mute threat escaped the prince.
"Oh! be not guilty of such cruelty!" she exclaimed.

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

"She once loved thee, thou sayst&mdash;how then canst
thou doom her so easily to the grave?"</p>

<p>"She will well deserve her fate," hastily replied
the prince; "has she not forgotten her own honour,
and tarnished mine? Besides, we walk upon the
edge of a precipice, and she must not live, if in the
possession of a secret which may betray us both
to destruction. We know not how often her paramour 
may have watched our retirement. Yes!
she must die!"</p>

<p>"What! if it be unjust?" exclaimed Abassa, "if
she be not guilty? And how knowest thou that
she is so? Thou hast no proof of her falsehood&mdash;that 
ring&mdash;nay, 'tis none. He may have stolen it
from her, or it may have been the price of some
service which he might rightfully render."</p>

<p>"What! mine own gift," answered the prince&mdash;"and 
the reward of ordinary duty which, as a slave
of the harem, he was bound to perform at her bidding! 
Believe it not. She is guilty, and she shall
die&mdash;secretly, speedily, ere her babbling tongue
can betray us. Be not thus moved! Have I not
the right? Does she not justly deserve death?"</p>

<p>"She does, if guilty," replied Abassa; "but not
by your hand. She should die under the sentence
of the law, not condemned by thee&mdash;at once her
judge and her accuser&mdash;executed, too, in secret and
in silence."</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" exclaimed the prince, interrupting 
her, "this is unmeasured folly. It exceeds belief 
that thou shouldst counsel me to it. What!

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

shall I not punish in mine own right those who
thus offend? Must I trumpet to the world that
dishonour which the walls of a prison, or the grave
might conceal? I cannot but smile at the thought.
Justly, deeply offended, and yet not the power to
punish the very dependants of my house, without
calling all the world to witness the justice, or rather,
if it must be spoken, the deep die of the disgrace!
To afford her, too, an opportunity to accuse me to
the calif of a fault that might destroy us both,"</p>

<p>"But may not her death, even if secret, betray
us? Will not my father's suspicions be awakened
if he should hear of her fate? And may he not?
Remember, Giafar, how often, as vizier to the calif,
thou hast brought to light crimes as well hidden
as this could be. If thy brother's vigilance should
slumber, yet Abou Youssouf, the chief magistrate
of the city, will not pass by thy mansion in his
watchfulness. Reflect&mdash;do nothing rashly&mdash;do
nothing which may endanger our happiness, our
lives&mdash;but above all, do nothing unjustly!"</p>

<p>"I will not, believe me, dearest," was the reply
of the prince. Then, after musing some moments,
he added, "Thou art right&mdash;to punish her as she
deserves might cause inquiry which it would be
difficult to answer. Yet she must not betray us.
In seclusion from the world she shall have full
leisure to repent her guilt, and if strictly guarded,
her silence will be as sure as though death had set
his icy seal upon her lips. 'Tis a merciful part,
too, though she deserves it not. Yes! solitude,

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

stern and cruel&mdash;yet not to her, the ingrate, the
traitress! No! the heaviest chains were mercy
to one so guilty. But come, let us seek the palace.
I have a task yet to perform ere morning, and the
night is well advanced."</p>

<p>"She shall not die then, thou wilt promise me?"
said Abassa.</p>

<p>"Believe me, she shall not."</p>

<p>They walked slowly together to the palace.
There leaving the princess, Giafar sought the apartment 
of the slaves, and having beckoned one of
them to follow him, returned to the private garden.
"Mahmoud, is it thou?" he said, as the slave approached.</p>

<p>The slave bowed low, in token of assent.</p>

<p>"Draw near. Thou hast been long in mine
household. Canst thou be faithful?"</p>

<p>The slave bowed his head again, and placed his
hand upon his bosom.</p>

<p>"Go, get thee tools, and dig, with secrecy and
speed, a grave by the southern wall: then hie to
the kiosk, where thou wilt find the body of a beheaded 
slave, which, at midnight, thou must bury.
Thou needst not shroud nor wash it; it befits not
the burial of a traitor. He has died the death of a
faithless hound. Yet lay him with his right side
towards the holy city, as thou wouldst wish for
thyself, Mahmoud. Who will assist thee in the
task? Choose some one for whose fidelity thou
wilt answer with thy head." The slave hesitated,
and Giafar immediately added, "Nay, I will myself 

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

go with thee. Impart this business to no one.
I will await thee here at midnight. Speak not a
word&mdash;a single torch will give us light enough."</p>

<p>The slave cast his eyes upward to the moon,
which was shining brightly above them.</p>

<p>"True, true!" replied the prince to this silent
suggestion of the slave, "its light will suffice. Be
secret, Mahmoud&mdash;be faithful. I have punished
treachery ere this to-night."</p>

<p>At the hour of midnight Giafar went to the place
appointed. He found the slave awaiting his coming.
Not a word was exchanged, and Mahmoud slowly
followed the prince to the kiosk. The full moon
was holding its silent course through a cloudless
sky, lighting up a lovely oriental landscape around
them. It shone brightly upon the quiet river, which
wound like a silver riband through the trees upon
their right, and gilded with its soft beams the lofty
domes and tall minarets of the adjacent city, that
lay stretched like a slumbering giant upon its
banks. In its mild lustre the marble pillars and
steps of that beautiful pavilion were revealed with
the utmost clearness, and even the most minute objects 
were rendered distinctly visible. Upon ascending 
the balcony, to the astonishment of Giafar,
the body was nowhere to be seen. There were
the walls and pavement yet wet with the blood of
the guilty Hassan, but the dead slave was no longer
there.</p>

<p>"Ya Mohammed!" exclaimed the startled
prince, "have I dreamed this deed? that quick

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

blow! that ghastly form! that headless trunk!
By the light of heaven, I should think so!" he continued, 
looking around in wonder, "but for these
red tokens of its reality. Ha!" and his eye flashed
quickly upon the wondering Mahmoud, "hast thou
prated, slave? or was it thou that removed the
carcass?"</p>

<p>"I have seen no one," replied the affrighted
Mahmoud, placing his forehead upon the pavement
before the prince's feet. "I have spoken with no
one since I received thine order; neither has thy
slave removed the body."</p>

<p>"Arise, then! search carefully around&mdash;see if
thou canst discover the print of feet, or aught
which may disclose the author of this wonder. If
it be the work of mortal, some signs may be discerned 
of human agency." They scanned the
pavement and steps with care, and looked even to
the water's edge for some track of human footsteps.
It was in vain. Naught could they discover which
might throw light upon the disappearance of the
body. After searching for some time, unsuccessfully, 
Giafar ordered Mahmoud to fill up the grave
which he had dug, and having enjoined upon him
silence as to the occurrence of the night, turned his
steps musingly towards the palace.</p>

<p>"Treason upon treason! wonder upon wonder!" 
he muttered to himself, as he entered his
chamber. "My trustiest slave betrays me&mdash;the
fairest and fondest of my harem dishonours me&mdash;the 
very spirits of the air, genii unseen, seem combining 

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

to work my ruin. But into the hands of the
Merciful One do I resign myself!"</p>

<p>Much pondering in nowise diminished the wonder 
of Giafar at an event so strange. All was inexplicable 
mystery; and time, in passing, afforded
no clue to its solution. Many within the walls of
the palace noted the sudden disappearance of Hassan, 
but in the deportment of no one was seen
aught to arouse suspicion, as to the instruments of
the secret removal of his body. To the watchful
eye of the prince nothing was betrayed that served
to lessen his astonishment or perplexity.</p>

<p>The inmates of the harem have also lost a companion. 
The place of Khatoun is vacant. She
comes no more to pluck the bright flowers&mdash;to
revel in the bath&mdash;to bring in sportive rivalry her
favourite birds to outvie those of her companions.
She listens no more with them when tales of love
or wonder are read by the sweet-voiced slaves.
Her joyous tones are no longer heard echoing
through those gay chambers, or swelling in sad harmony 
above the chords of her feebly sounded lute.
Where is she? They ask each other, where?
They look up to the highest and gloomiest towers
of the palace, seeking some token that she is still
in life. They think often of her as they thread the
mazes of the garden, fearful lest they may tread
upon her tomb. They hang inquiringly over the
river's brink, gazing with awe into its depths; for
there, they whisper to each other, may be her
grave. But the stream is voiceless; or if it murmurs, 

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

it is full sadly. It seems a dirge that rises
from its waves. The thoughts of a fearful, secret
fate trouble their fancies, and they weep, they
tremble, and resolve. Love, they whisper to their
hearts, though it may make a paradise of earth,
cannot burn beneath the waves. The sullen stream
runs swiftly to the ocean, unruffled by the sigh of
beauty, though it be her last; the heaving of the
fairest bosom creates not a ripple in those waters,
which hold it a prisoner within their depths.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> passed away, and returning winter
found the prince and princess again in Bagdad.
The occurrences related in the preceding chapter
had been almost forgotten; no clue had been found
to the disappearance of Hassan's body, and the
anxiety of the prince gradually diminished, when,
as the months rolled by, he saw no evils falling, or
threatening to fall upon them, as results of that
strange event. The danger to which they had
been exposed by the jealousy of Khatoun, and the

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

treachery of her accomplice, had been averted by
his promptness. All means that might lead to the
discovery of their disobedience seem removed, and
careful of their happiness, though they surrender
themselves to joy and love, yet it is with a more
prudent and constrained affection. They tremble
as they look back upon the precipice which they
have so narrowly escaped; they still walk along
its brink&mdash;they cannot leave the danger&mdash;yet their
steps are more wary and circumspect, for prudence, 
hand in hand with love (rare union), is
guiding them upon their way.</p>

<p>In this security, however, the prince is not
always at his ease; at times an undefinable sense
of dread weighs upon his soul. Something&mdash;he
knows not what&mdash;a vague foreboding, a sound, a
vision, tells him that misfortune is at hand. Yet
'tis but rarely that his mind is thus affected; and
even when most deeply influenced by his fears, a
look, a smile from her dispels his gloom. So the
sun drives along the mists of the morning, and
the shadows that darken successively upon the
plain, proclaim his power and his brightness as
they pass. He has not made his wife a partner in
his anxiety. She is ignorant of the disappearance
of the dead slave&mdash;the origin&mdash;the cause of all his
fears. Still she is sad. Her step is languid; her
eye sunken. Her cheek loses daily a portion of
its colour, and Care is marking with his finger his
traces upon her sweet face. She seems like one
whose bosom is oppressed with some cause for

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

melancholy&mdash;secret, deep, hidden. Yet can this be?
Giafar is often happy when she is most sad; and
what cloud can darken upon her soul, and not enwrap 
him in the selfsame gloom? Or is it the
very perfection and poignancy of her happiness
which is wearing thus upon her frame, as an
Indian sabre is said from the excellence of its
temper to eat the scabbard which encloses it? Ah!
there is a secret&mdash;a little secret&mdash;'tis told in a word,
a breath, a look, and is understood as soon. 'Tis
known! Giafar glances for an instant at her
beloved form, and then clasps her tenderly to his
bosom, while he presses upon her lips a kiss&mdash;a
kiss, in richness and in luxury unequalled, save
by the first which he imprinted upon her virgin
lips.</p>

<p>"It is so, then?" he said. "I have been
strangely blind," and again he repeated his caresses. 
"Yet be not sad, my life. Droop not&mdash;yield 
not to sorrow at its mere menace. Wait, ere
thou grievest, until it comes upon us."</p>

<p>"How selfish am I!" she replied. "Now that
you participate in my grief, it is robbed of half its
bitterness. I would have kept this from you, for
I would not render you unhappy; but soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unhappy!" interrupted the prince; "say not
so. The avowal which has fallen from thy lips
renders me insensible to the future. I know
not"&mdash;here his speech was interrupted by frequent
kisses&mdash;"I know not that I felt more delight at
the moment when thou didst first listen to my

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

love, than now to hear what thou hast told me.
There are joys whose power cannot be lessened
by the prospect, nay, even by the certainty of
future misery."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this earnest asseveration, the
prince, as he ponders upon the dangers which
threaten them, becomes thoughtful and silent. It
is true his face does not exhibit that care and
dread that are visible in the countenance of his
wife. Its expression is calm and meditative, and,
save that his brow is closely knit, is unruffled by
emotion; yet, were the extremity of sorrow to
come upon them, it may be questioned whether
he would endure its bitterness with as much fortitude 
as the helpless being at his side. He walks
the apartment, pondering upon the means that
remain to avoid his master's displeasure, pausing
at each turn to bless and embrace his wife for the
pleasing yet perilous knowledge which she has
disclosed to him.</p>

<p>"Why is it thus?" he said; "why are our
very pleasures born in danger?&mdash;that we cannot
rejoice over their possession, lest their very existence 
should deprive us of them. Shall we be
ever thus unfortunate? Yet I am ashamed, my
life, to complain of Heaven's unkindness after
having known thee. No! let the worst come. I
am prepared for it. I will cling to past happiness
as to a rock, and the fiercest tempest shall not
shake me from it. But thou, mine own, my

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

loved one&mdash;what shall support thee in that hour
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what?" exclaimed the princess, for
Giafar was unable to proceed with the cruel sentence.</p>

<p>"When thy father's anger shall fall upon our
heads."</p>

<p>"Mention it not, Giafar. I will not listen. I
will not look at it. Secure within thy love, I will
rest until the blow shall fall. I will not, if I can
help it, increase my sorrows by anticipating their
coming."</p>

<p>"Thou dost rightly; let us not think but to
avoid them. We must fly&mdash;we must leave Bagdad. 
Our home here must be exchanged for
some foreign clime, where we may yet be free and
happy. Yes! there are lands where thy father's
arm could not reach us, where new scenes and
new hopes would open to our view."</p>

<p>"Leave Bagdad!" exclaimed Abassa. "But
yes&mdash;with thee I could, though my heart is rooted
here, like the moss which has fastened upon its
walls. Let me, while I think upon it, weep, for
where shall we find a land so sweet, so well
beloved?"</p>

<p>"The sun shines upon many as fair," replied
the prince. "Egypt and India boast of bright
skies and rich groves. This earth is all a garden&mdash;why 
should we not range it freely?"</p>

<p>"Does the rose bloom as sweetly in the lands
you speak of, or does the bulbul sing with as

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

pleasant a note?&mdash;it would not sound so to mine
ear. Besides this, superstition and impiety sway
throughout the East, and Egypt, worse still, is
ruled by misguided tyrants of our own faith."</p>

<p>"Shall we seek the West, then?" said Giafar.
"Europe's fields are fertile and fair."</p>

<p>"I have heard that they are; and I have heard,
too, of the war and rapine which have laid them
waste. Each noble strives there with his brother,
for the lands which their own arms have ravaged.
Every home is a castle, and every temple a fortress. 
Their maidens are not so peaceful and so
happy as our own. The prey of the ruthless, and
the prize of the most skilful in fight, their hours
must needs pass in terror and disquietude. I
should feel lonely in their halls."</p>

<p>"Thou sayst truth. Strong hand alone keeps
wealth and power there. 'Tis a rude tenure; yet
couldst thou fear with my arm to protect thee?
The wealth which I might remove from hence
would purchase me a goodly domain, and buy
from their princes and their priests freedom for
the exercise of our religion. For the rest, this
sword will suffice. It shall gain me safety both
from peer and vassal. It shall gain me honour
and a name. In deeds of chivalry and nightly
emprise I will bear me with the bravest, and in
their own wild games will I foil the unbelievers.
Smile not, my life, 'tis no vain boast. Thine eyes
shall see it, and thine own fair hand shall crown
me, as is their custom, with the victor's wreath."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

<p>"These are dreams, Giafar," said the princess,
smiling at his momentary enthusiasm, though her
own face glowed as she spoke with the same proud
emotion, "Thy heart is firm, and thine arm
strong; yet a stranger, unfriended and alone, thou
wouldst be borne down in the rude strife that passion 
and interest light up in those lands. Even
should fortune crown thy brave deeds with the
fairest success, yet thou couldst not be happy
there, or I, at least, could not. I have planted
flowers, and their roots have twined deeply into
the earth. I have reared birds whose song is
sweet music to mine ear. Friends, too&mdash;father&mdash;mother&mdash;all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would thou hadst left those words unspoken,"
said the prince; "thou hast touched a chord in
my bosom that vibrates painfully. Yes! there are
here some brave friends that I would not leave.
My brothers, too, whose love is as a kingdom to
me&mdash;generous and true are ye!&mdash;but what avails
regret, if destiny must part us?"</p>

<p>"Do not speak so sadly, my dear lord," said the
princess. "Compassion may yet touch my father's
heart. He may repent him of his purpose, and
spare your life and mine."</p>

<p>"I think it not; stern and unsparing is he in his
purposes of vengeance. Yet grant it; should he
give me life, burdened with his displeasure, it were
a torment save for thee. I have held a place most
worthy in the eyes of the kingdom; my counsel has
been prized in the court, and my sword feared in

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

the field; envy and hatred I have trampled beneath
my feet, as I would crush a scorpion into the sand&mdash;and 
to live a thing forgotten and unhonoured&mdash;<i>here</i>, 
where I have ruled, to hold my life as a gift,
which I may possess but must never enjoy&mdash;not
even for thee could I do it. What say I?&mdash;by this
hand I would!&mdash;for thee I would live in bondage to
my very slave. But glory&mdash;honour&mdash;think you
that my bosom is dead to their call?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had been sated with their possession," 
answered Abassa. "How often have I
heard you call them the cloud, the meteor, the
mirage of the desert. How often have you blessed
the fortune which led you to retirement, far from
their turbulent control."</p>

<p>"Yes, when they might be mine, I spoke thus;
but now that I must yield them up, I feel how dear
they are to my bosom. But I will not loose my
hold upon them&mdash;no, they are mine by right; and
if stern fortune and my master's coldness bar to
me here the road, I will gladly&mdash;so thou wilt go
with me&mdash;wander to some remote land, where the
way is open to renown. It is to be found where
brave men dwell together, and the boldest and
worthiest hand will ever seize it. Death or disgrace 
awaits us here; let us not abide its approach&mdash;come 
with me, and in lands as fair as this, I will
work thee out as fair a fortune. Come&mdash;there is
still time."</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, a knocking was
heard at the door of the apartment, and a slave

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

entered with a sealed paper, which he placed in in
the hands of the prince. It had been found, he said,
in the courtyard of the palace. Within were written 
these words: "Giafar, beware! The bow is
drawn, and the arrow is ready to take its flight.
What thou knowest, thou knowest; but if the shield
of innocence cannot protect thee, fly, and with
speed." The handwriting was unknown to him;
there was no impress upon the seal, nor any mark
by which he could conjecture as to the writer of
the letter. He trembled, and his face became pale.
He read the writing again attentively, and a third
time gazed vacantly over the lines. He heard the
voice of Abassa, as she inquired anxiously as to
the cause of his emotion, but the words fell indistinctly 
upon his ear. "Just Allah!" he exclaimed,
"can this be so? The storm comes soon upon
us." He then put the scroll into the princess's
hands, saying, "Here&mdash;read!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" exclaimed Abassa, striving with
trembling eagerness to place the paper before her.
"What means this dreadful writing?&mdash;nay, I cannot 
read; tell me the purport of the lines."</p>

<p>"All is known, I fear!" answered Giafar; "and
this comes as a warning, that I should provide in
time for safety. But weep not, do not unman me
with thy tears. Help me rather to think how this
danger may be averted."</p>

<p>"All is lost, if this speaks true," he muttered to
himself, resuming his hurried and irregular walk
across the chamber. "Instant flight alone can

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

save us, yet even that may be in vain. If my
master's suspicions are aroused, it will be hard indeed 
to elude his vigilance. Whither, too, should
I go, and thus hurriedly? Ah! I should have laid
up a secure retreat against this hour. I should
not have waited thus, like a vessel far from the
haven, until the bursting of the tempest. What to
do?&mdash;whither to turn? I might throw myself into
the arms of my country's foes, and win the name
an outcast and a traitor, a disgraced prince, and
dishonoured subject. To serve under the green
banners of the Fatemite? I could not do it; and
the white standard of the house of Ommeyah
would reproach me for my dark treason, did I
march beneath its shadow. Sooner let confusion
and shame blacken my face. To tear this crescent
from my turban, and to place there the cross of
the Christian&mdash;ay"&mdash;and he laughed scornfully
as he spoke&mdash;"or to doff turban, and put on the
helmet of the Greek&mdash;to take up their impenetrable 
armour, and their craft, and their cowardice.
Oh! Mohammed, assist me&mdash;thou art my prophet&mdash;thy 
religion is mine, and I will serve but one God.
No, I may be a traitor&mdash;nay, I have been one&mdash;but 
an apostate, a foe to Islam?&mdash;never! But 'tis
vain to talk thus&mdash;could I do these things, could I
flee with safety to myself and her, would not my
father and brothers yet remain behind to endure
the calif's vengeance? Would not his hand fall
heavily upon them, while I, the guilty one, would
be far distant, drawing my breath in ignominy and

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

shame? No, <i>I</i> must suffer&mdash;not they. It is inevitable. 
Yet hold&mdash;resistance, ay"&mdash;and his eye
shone, as though fixed upon some bright and passing 
vision&mdash;"I might wake up the bold spirits
whom I have so often led, and with the aid of my
brave brothers make head against the tyrant. By
the life of Mohammed! 'twere well done&mdash;at but a
word from me, they would be in arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were well done?" exclaimed the princess, 
aroused from the state of stupor into which
she had been thrown by the clear and commanding 
tones of her husband's voice; "why dost thou
frown so angrily, and grasp thy scimitar?"</p>

<p>"It offers a brave chance for safety," continued
the prince, not hearing or unheeding her words&mdash;"a 
noble one&mdash;I have played many a game more
hazardous for him&mdash;why not one blow for myself&mdash;for 
life&mdash;for love&mdash;for everything? I have seen
it all&mdash;his anger has been long smothered, 'like
live coals hid under the dark ashes.' When the
fire shall burst forth nothing can quench it save
my blood&mdash;or his own&mdash;yes, his own&mdash;and what
should hinder me? shall I not strike?"</p>

<p>"What dost thou mutter, Giafar?" again interrupted 
Abassa. "Whom wouldst thou strike?
What hideous fancies disturb thee? Canst thou
not look upon me? Wilt thou not answer me?"</p>

<p>" 'Twas nothing," was the reply&mdash;"an evil spirit
was at my side, tempting me to madness&mdash;but he
is gone&mdash;thou, my good angel, hast driven him
away. No, I could not do it&mdash;Allah forgive me

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

for the thought! He is my sovereign and my
father, and may the waters of hell boil fiercely and
for ever in this bosom, if I raise an arm against
him. Yet peace, my life," he continued to Abassa,
who was again about to speak, "a moment, and I
shall be myself. My thoughts are feeble and wavering&mdash;my 
firmness seems shaken and uprooted;
but fear not&mdash;this weakness is passing. Where
is my prudence?&mdash;where my pride?" he exclaimed.
"If the crisis of our fate is near, shall I not meet it
as befits me?&mdash;shall not my courage rise, rather
than sink, as perils thicken around me? If the
emergency is fearful and trying, can I not become
equal to it? How else do I differ from the common 
herd of men? Why have I led armies to the
field, and, as vizier to the calif, conducted the various 
business of the state, if I cannot do this? if I
cannot ward off danger with address, or meet it,
when inevitable, with fearlessness and calmness?"</p>

<p>Inspiring himself with the thoughts of the past,
Giafar called pride to his aid, and by an uncommon
effort divested himself of fear, and banished from
his soul all tremour and emotion that might derange
the nice balance of self-counsel. He was now a
noble specimen of Heaven's workmanship. Coolly
brave&mdash;carefully meditating&mdash;ready for the worst&mdash;and 
supporting, upon the shoulders of a giant
resolution, the falling ruins of hope and happiness.
When he next spoke his manner was entirely free
from that agitation which but a moment before
had so violently moved him. He seemed as though

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

he were musing upon some most trivial circumstance 
of life, rather than pondering upon a subject, 
on which depended his own fate, and the life
of the one most dear to him.</p>

<p>"Let me look upon this scroll again," he said.
"My father cannot have written it, nor either of
my brothers. Had they known this, they would
themselves have come and spoken with me. They
would have concerted for me the means of flight,
and offered me their counsel&mdash;ay, and lives. They
would have urged me to it&mdash;not left it to the warning 
of these uncertain lines. They know, likewise,
that while there is the shadow of a fear for their
safety, I would not fly and leave them to suffer in
my stead. Whoever wrote this knew me not. No
friend would urge me to such baseness&mdash;and what
stranger is there in Bagdad who, for the safety of
a broken and a ruined man, would dare to pen
these words? I cannot fathom the mystery. The
calif?&mdash;by Heaven, a ray of light breaks in upon
me!&mdash;is it not he? Deep hidden is his craft. As
I live it can be no other! He would urge me
to flight, that I might give that damning evidence
of my guilt. He would have me depart in the vain
hope of safety; but the quick messengers of his
wrath would soon overtake the fool, the self-condemned 
one. I understand it now. But this
brings hope again to me," he continued after a short
pause. "If my master has written this, he cannot
know of my disobedience; or why wish for my
flight? Why not at once point me to the proof,

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

the condemnation, and let the sword of the executioner 
do its work upon the traitor's body? No,
his suspicions may be awakened, but are not as yet
confirmed. Here can be no doubt. And what
evidence, unless I give it by flight, can be produced
as proof of my guilt? Khatoun cannot be heard
beyond the walls of her lone prison. She may not
even know of my fault. I may have stifled the
treason in its birth, before her base accomplice could
return from his guilty errand. Hassan's lips, too,
will no more unclose to accuse me. His body has
been spirited away, yet no art, no bribes, nor threats
can make him breathe the secret. It is true, he
was found dead within the precincts of the kiosk,
close fallen behind the lattice, as though he had
been slain, while in the very act of watching the
retirement of his master. The silence, also, which
has rested upon his fate. These may have engendered 
suspicion. Yet how easy were it to disclose
a crime which would excuse his punishment, though
executed suddenly and rashly&mdash;a crime which I
might well wish to keep hidden from the world.
How easy to produce the partner of his guilt, and
prove the baseness from her own lips. But this
were hazardous, and might plunge me into the very
danger that I would avoid. What surety have I
that she would confess her fault? Might she not
rather, in the presence of the calif, charge me with
disobedience to his commands? and he himself
will question her. Would she not, if it is in her
power, inform my master of that which may prove

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

my ruin? This must be cared for. I must see
her ere I proceed a step farther. If she has the
power to destroy me, and with it the will to do so,
she must die. I have almost forgotten her falsehood. 
I hate to think upon it; still more should I
grieve to visit her with vengeance, even though
just, since it has been thus long delayed. But why
should I hesitate, when the lives of others, and those
innocent, are perilled by her treachery?"</p>

<p>During this while, Abassa had been a silent spectatress 
of her husband's agitation. Now and then
she answered his self-addressed inquiries as though
they had been made to her, and at times put some
question to the prince which he noticed not, neither
replied to. Turning to her now, he said, "Thou
must keep within thine own apartment. Think
not if I have been blind that others will be so. The
eyes of anger and suspicion are sharper than those
of love. Thou mayst conceal this yet for a time;
meanwhile a way may offer to escape the fate
which now threatens us. There is yet a remedy
for our fears, perchance; or if all should fail, I will
throw myself upon the calif's mercy, though small
chance were that in truth for safety. Retire now,
my life. Refuse to see even thy father should he
visit thee. Deny him upon the plea of sickness.
Betake thyself to thy chamber, and if need be, to
thy couch. In truth," he added, pressing his lips
to her colourless cheek, "thy face is wan and pale.
'Tis a hard lot for thee to struggle thus with fortune. 
Yet hope still&mdash;still be thyself."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

<p>"Wilt thou not soon return?" said Abassa, embracing 
him tenderly, as he turned to leave her.
"I shall do naught but weep while thou art away."</p>

<p>"I will not be long absent," was the reply. "I
will see the slave Khatoun, and learn from her the
extent of her knowledge and of her treachery.
Then will I decide her fate, and the path which I
myself must pursue. Farewell! may Heaven
shield thee!" Having again affectionately embraced 
the princess, Giafar departed.</p>

<p>A few words may be necessary to explain more
clearly the fears and the purpose of the prince. He
was well aware that the situation in which the
body of Hassan had been found was, of itself, sufficient 
to indicate the intention with which he had
stolen into that secret retreat; and the punishment
which he had suffered seemed to have overtaken
him suddenly, in a place ill fitted for a deed of
blood, and to all appearance while he was busied
in watching the private hours of his master. The
purpose of the culprit and of his destroyer seemed
equally evident&mdash;that of the one to discover, and of
the other to conceal the secrets of that retired kiosk. 
Besides this, the silence which had been observed 
respecting the death of the slave, would be
additional evidence to him who discovered and removed 
the body, that such was the offence for
which he had been thus summarily punished. In
one way, however, and in one alone, could these
appearances be accounted for, which threatened so
much the safety of the prince. There was a crime

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

so irritating in its nature, so galling to the pride
and hasty jealousy of a Moslem, that it might well
excuse both rashness and secrecy in the punishment 
of the offender. Upon the evidence which
he had of such a one, Khatoun had been imprisoned, 
and for such, was it the intention of Giafar
to declare that Hassan had suffered; and to defend 
the care with which he had concealed his
death, by the plea that pride had led him to throw
a veil over the dishonour of his harem. But Giafar 
was well aware, that his mere assertion would
avail but little with the calif, and would contribute
in no degree to remove his suspicions, unless enforced 
by evidence clear and conclusive in its character. 
For this purpose it would be necessary to
produce the faithless Khatoun, and obtain from her
an acknowledgment of her own guilt and that of
her accomplice. But in taking this step it was to
be feared that, irritated by her imprisonment, and
through the hope of gaining the favour of his master, 
Khatoun would accuse him to the calif of the
very fault which he was so desirous to conceal. In
his present visit to her, then, his purpose was twofold&mdash;one, 
to discover if she had succeeded in her
espial upon his actions, and possessed the power as
well as the will to betray him; the other, to induce
her, by promise of pardon, to assert, in the presence
of the calif, the guilt of Hassan, and to confess her
own. If she were ignorant of his secret, or, knowing, 
would not reveal it, her life, though justly forfeited 
by her falsehood, should be spared. But

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

should he gather, either from her words or demeanour, 
that his danger would be increased by
her appearance before the calif, it was Giafar's intention 
to put her to death forthwith; for which
course, to his jealous and proud spirit there needed
no excuse.</p>

<p>The interview which he sought was a task that
he ill liked. He burned with indignation at the
bare thoughts of her offence, and he felt that to see
and question her of her guilt would be a severe
trial of his temper. It was, however, necessary
for his safety that he should do this; and arming
his bosom with double patience, he proceeded, with
a heavy and unwilling step, towards her solitary
prison.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">                Oh, couldst thou but know,
With what a deep devotedness of woe
I wept thy absence&mdash;o'er and o'er again
Thinking of thee, still thee, till thought grew pain,
And memory, like a drop, that, night and day,
Falls cold and ceaseless, wore my heart away.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lalla Rookh</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> where was she, the sensitive, the sad one?
where was the unfortunate Khatoun? Grief was
not sparing her&mdash;misfortune and care were doing
their utmost to shatter and destroy her health and
happiness; and love&mdash;he that can dull the sharpest
edge of calamity&mdash;had spread his wings and flown
from her. Deserted by one whom she had deeply
loved, she strove in vain to wean her affections
from his memory. She remembered the fond
looks, the burning words, and the dear caresses
which he had lavished upon her; they were blessings 
for which she had never hoped; but when once
they had been hers, when she had known their
charm, they had become essential to her happiness&mdash;a 
very part and portion of it. She thought upon
their loss, and her bosom was deluged with sorrow.
But the inconstancy of Giafar, although the heaviest, 
was not the only blow which had fallen upon

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

her heart. Lone and desolate, she was wearing
her life away in confinement, and pining in solitude
over the loss of liberty as well as love.</p>

<p>When the prince became enthralled by the
charms and possession of his wife, when he came
no more to her as he was wont, wonder and grief
were the first emotions of Khatoun. "How could
it be?" she thought. "Was he sick or absent?" It
might, nay, it must be one of these; and she wearied
her brain with framing and varying all those excuses, 
with which confiding love will so long and
so easily buoy up the hearts of its victims. But
these could not always support her. There is a
limit even to the flattery of hope. She had heard
of Giafar's presence in the palace; from the terrace
she had seen his well-known form walking down
the avenues of cypress and chenar trees, that throw
their branches high above the wall which separates
that private, that sacred garden from the common
enclosure of the palace grounds. And yet he came
not, and yet she would not despair. Daily would
she ascend the terrace to watch for him, and as
often could she discern the prince, and once, as
she thought&mdash;yes, she could not doubt&mdash;a female
walking by his side. Then she knew she was
deserted.</p>

<p>Ere she yielded to deep and settled sorrow, a
cloud of jealousy and anger passed over her, shaking 
her bosom with its tempest. Harassed by
these unsparing and pitiless passions, burning with
a wish to know the cause of the prince's inconstancy, 

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

she hoped, by tampering with the fidelity
of Hassan, to obtain from him the desired yet torturing 
knowledge. Fortune, however, did not
favour her design. On a sudden she found herself
secluded from her companions, and confined in the
closest solitude in a remote apartment of the harem.
All amusements were here denied her. She was
attended by an aged female, who held no intercourse 
with her except by signs, and although she
used no harshness in the execution of her duty,
yet carefully watched her. When winter came
she had been removed to Bagdad, in a litter, alone.
No one saw her&mdash;none knew of her existence.
Yet here her confinement became less rigorous.
Her books, and flowers, and birds were restored
to her. Her lute was alone withheld, and she was
forbidden to sing, lest the sound of her voice should
discover her imprisonment. She was allowed,
also, to visit at certain hours the bath, and to walk
in a retired court, but always accompanied by her
mute and vigilant attendant.</p>

<p>Deeply did she brood over her misfortunes. She
had been bitterly deceived in those fond hopes,
which love and expectation had awakened in her
young bosom. She had been, as she often sighed
to herself, betrayed and wronged by the very
being, upon the wings of whose love, as on an
eagle's, she had for a time soared above this world.
She had lost sight of its cold and selfish joys in
her flight towards heaven. To fall, then, from
this height upon the chill earth, to wake from a

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

blissful dream to the dreary reality of desertion
and despair, was of itself enough to inflict upon
her peace a deep and irremediable wound. But
to wake to solitude&mdash;to find herself deprived of the
society of her companions, and of those resources
which might alleviate in some degree her sorrow&mdash;this 
she could not endure. She was fast sinking
under an accumulated weight of woe. Her form
had become weak and wasted, like a rose leaf
withered in autumn, and grief had robed her once
crimson cheek with his pale, sad livery. Her
beauty had faded, her joys were buried in the past,
and hope even had deserted her, save that which
looked for the approach of death, as to the certain
coming of a friend that would not deceive her.</p>

<p>She was sitting alone, not, as formerly, thinking
upon her love and blighted happiness, but pondering
upon the future, the quiet grave, the ever-blooming
paradise. She was sitting alone and weeping,
when she was aroused by some one entering the
apartment. Contrary to her custom, she looked
up, for it was the step of a stranger, and the almost
forgotten sound caused her bosom to palpitate with
a thrilling presentiment. She turned her head,
and to her astonishment beheld the prince standing
near her. Weak as she was, his unexpected presence 
overpowered Khatoun; her heart fluttered
wildly, she tried to speak, but an hysterical scream
alone came to her lips, and she sank back feebly
upon the divan against which she had been reclining.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

<p>Her frail and faded appearance, so changed
from the bright and happy being whom he had last
seen, somewhat moved the prince. He uttered an
exclamation of pity, and stooping forward, raised
her gently, and supported her for a moment in his
arms. This kindness affected the young girl powerfully; 
tears, fell in profusion from her eyes, and
looking fixedly in his face for a moment, as though
to assure herself that it was he, she exclaimed,
affectionately,</p>

<p>"Is it thou, indeed, my lord? and art thou come
at last? I had ceased to hope for this."</p>

<p>Giafar shrank from these expressions of tenderness. 
He placed her abruptly upon the carpet
where she was seated when he entered, and replied
with some severity,</p>

<p>"Can the sight of one whom thou hast injured
bring thee pleasure? If so, thou hast it&mdash;look
upon me."</p>

<p>She gazed up at him through the tears which
were streaming from her eyes, and replied,</p>

<p>"Injured thee! what canst thou mean, my lord?
Methought"&mdash;here she looked sadly around her&mdash;" 'twas 
<i>I</i> had some cause for complaining. This
lone chamber&mdash;this weak and wasted frame bear
witness to my sufferings. Canst thou tell me how
I have deserved them?"</p>

<p>"Peace, Khatoun!" quickly replied the prince.
"Falsehood will not avail thee; thy crime is
known, and thou owest much to my clemency that

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

thou art still in life. Add not to thy guilt by denying 
it."</p>

<p>"Guilt, my lord!" exclaimed the trembling girl.
"Speak, and charge me with it; but torture not
with thine upbraidings one who has little strength
and less firmness to bear them&mdash;above all, from
<i>thee</i>."</p>

<p>"Here, look upon this," said the prince, placing
before her eyes the ring which he had found upon
the body of Hassan. "Ay, tremble; well thou
mayst. Deny thy crimes if thou canst."</p>

<p>At the sight of the jewel, Khatoun seemed dismayed. 
She hung her head, and exclaimed,
"Pardon for thy slave! pardon for one who,
blinded by passion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold!" interrupted Giafar, and his frame shook
with anger: "thy shamelessness surpasses even
thy guilt. Avow not so boldly thy dishonour, or
thou shalt yet suffer the fate of thy paramour."</p>

<p>"Paramour!" exclaimed Khatoun, in wonder:
"whom dost thou mean, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Hassan, the slave&mdash;traitress!"</p>

<p>"Hassan, the slave, my paramour!" said the
startled girl; "the slave Hassan!" and she half
raised herself from the recumbent posture in which
she had remained during the interview. The flush
with which anger had for a moment reddened her
pale cheeks departed, and her face, as she raised it,
was colourless and calm; it were hard to tell,
whether firm and suffering innocence, or cold despair 
was written in its lineaments. "It is false!"

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

she continued, lifting her eyes to heaven, and pointing 
thither with her extended finger. "Though the
lips of an angel had spoken it, it were false. How
canst thou charge me with this baseness? Thou
hast betrayed and deserted me, and wouldst thou
find an excuse for thine unkindness in alleging guilt
to me? 'Tis ill done, my lord. I am defenceless,
and alone, I have no protector but Allah; spare
me then! I upbraid <i>thee</i> not&mdash;I complain not. I
can still suffer, still alone and in silence&mdash;but oh!
speak not thus cruelly to me."</p>

<p>"Strange!" muttered the prince to himself,
almost staggered in his belief of her treachery;
"she wears the face of an angel upon her falsehood, 
if she indeed be guilty. Thou deniest it,
Khatoun," he again addressed her: "but tell me,
didst thou not give this ring to Hassan, one of the
slaves of the harem? Go, go, guilt is written in
thy face&mdash;my scimitar almost starts from its sheath
to visit vengeance on thee."</p>

<p>"Draw it, my lord, and strike: it cannot wound
me more deeply than thy words have done. Yet,
if thou wilt hear me?" she added.</p>

<p>"Speak, then," said Giafar: "say it was lost, or
stolen from thee; or own at once thy guilt."</p>

<p>"Neither of these, my lord; I gave the ring to
Hassan&mdash;nay, hear me&mdash;'twas not for love of him.
Oh no! no! how couldst thou think it?" she said,
earnestly, the marks of horror and aversion which
were visible in her features at the hideous thought,
testifying to the sincerity of her reply.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

<p>"Thy words, thy looks are like truth, but I trust
them not. Would gold, would this toy, have
bribed my most faithful slave to betray me? It
cannot be&mdash;thyself, thy love&mdash;ay, these were the
lures. Why, too, shouldst thou part with this, mine
own gift to thee?"</p>

<p>"What had I, my lord, that was not once thine?
I have kept this, and these&mdash;see," she said, showing 
him various rings that encircled loosely her
emaciated fingers&mdash;gifts which Giafar had forgotten, 
as things of no account, but which the enamoured 
girl had treasured up as the memorials of
happiness which had once enchanted her.</p>

<p>The prince smiled mournfully, and with a feeling 
of self-reproach, as he noted the fondness with
which she gazed upon these mementoes of past affection. 
Repressing, however, his compassion,
he said, "Yet why didst thou give aught to the
slave? Why, if thou art innocent, didst thou wish
to ruin and destroy me? Was it thy wounded
pride? thy jealousy? and could no sacrifice but
my death appease thee?"</p>

<p>"Thy death, my lord? I understand thee not.
How could my folly endanger thy safety? I will
tell thee why I gave the ring. When thou didst
first leave me, grief overwhelmed this bosom: I
will not speak to thee of what I then lost, for I
would not reproach thee with thine unkindness.
Hope still, for a season, bore up my spirits, but
soon fled, leaving my desolate heart cheerless and
unsupported. I waited long, and in vain, for thy

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

coming, till my heart sickened&mdash;jealousy and suspicion 
entered my soul&mdash;thou knowest not their
poison, my lord. I thought, nay, I was sure, that
thou didst love another. I had seen&mdash;Allah, support 
me!&mdash;I had seen thee when thou little thoughtst
these eyes were watching thy steps&mdash;and she too&mdash;ah 
me! those hours. Pardon me, my lord, one
moment, and I will proceed." Her agitation here
completely overcame her; she gave free way to
it, and attempted not to restrain her tears, or the
sobs that were breaking from her bosom, so fast as
to impede her power of utterance.</p>

<p>"Calm thyself, Khatoun," said Giafar, much
moved: "banish this emotion, this recollection of
the sad past, and proceed more firmly."</p>

<p>With a strong effort, the unhappy girl continued:
"I was ignorant who she was, the partner of thy
retirement, the cause of mine unhappiness. All
the feelings in my bosom seemed to concentrate in
one strong wish to discover my rival; to know
her name, her accomplishments, and beauty, that I
might judge from thence if her power over thee
were likely to endure, or if I might hope soon to be
again blessed with thy love. Thus actuated, urged
by jealousy and fear, I addressed myself to Hassan.
He was, I knew, one of the slaves who attended
in thy private garden, and I endeavoured to induce
him, by the richest bribes in my possession, to obtain 
for me the information which I so much desired.
Often he denied me, but granted to my
tears at last, what he refused to gold."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

<p>"He did? ay, and told thee that the princess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> the princess, then!" exclaimed Khatoun. 
"My heart told me it was she, but I knew it
not till now. I never saw the slave again; he
came no more to me; and soon I was removed to
solitude, debarred from all pleasure, even if it could
come to one so wretched&mdash;but 'tis past. Thou
hast regretted thine unkindness, and pardoned me,
hast thou not?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;I have," said the prince. "Thou hast
indeed been wronged; thou hast erred, but art not
guilty, as I thought thee. I have been much to
blame. Canst thou forgive me?"</p>

<p>Unused as her ears had long been to words of
kindness, on hearing these expressions of regret
from the prince's lips, she looked up at him in wonder, 
but spoke not&mdash;her heart was full. He took
both her hands in his, and raising her to him, looked
compassionately upon her, and said, "Thy face is
pale; thou art indeed changed. I pity thee, Khatoun&mdash;I 
owe thee amends for this."</p>

<p>"Heed it not, my lord," she replied, while she
bedewed his hands with her tears; "heed it not,
for thou canst easily repay me. Words like these
come to my heart like showers long delayed upon
a withered garden; they have already made me
forget my sufferings." Giafar had supported her
lightly in his arms, with a feeling chaste and passionless, 
as though they encircled an urn which
held the ashes of departed love; but as Khatoun
continued, she settled more securely and confidingly

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

within their clasp. "Shall not those days return?
Shall I not leave this prison? and will you not love
me again, as you once did, and come to tell me of
it? This would indeed smooth my path to the
grave&mdash;nay, I think it would recall me thence, to
life and happiness."</p>

<p>The prince hesitated to remove her from his
affectionate yet cold embrace, into which she
seemed to have taken refuge, as in a safe haven,
from all the storms which had scathed her. He
spoke not for a moment, for he knew not how to
answer, but pressed his lips in silence to her pale
brow. The kiss thrilled to her heart, where all
the blood in her weak frame had concentrated&mdash;it
returned, however, to her cheek in a deep flush,
when she heard the prince's reply. "Khatoun, it
cannot be! thou knowest not what thou askest. I
would not needlessly distress thee, for thou hast
suffered much already from my folly and blindness&mdash;nay, 
cruelty if thou wilt; but it is better thou
shouldst know at once that my heart, my very
being is bound up in another. It cannot be!&mdash;forget 
me! forget the past, and be thyself once more."
For a moment it seemed as if pride would come
to the young girl's assistance; she attempted to
extricate herself from his firms, but in vain. So a
flower struggles against the first breathings of the
blast, and as it falls again to earth when the tempest 
has fully come, so in a moment she drooped
upon his bosom weeping. "I am very weak," she
said, when she could find utterance. "I cannot at

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

once control my feelings; indeed I never could, as
they whose minds have been trained and strengthened 
by education. I was ever somewhat wayward. 
I am ignorant too, thou art aware. I know
nothing but what I have learned from thee, and
this lesson thou hast forgotten to teach me. But
it will not be always thus. I shall conquer this
love of mine. I will watch my heart, and constant
care shall at last free it from the tyrant; yet be a
kind master to me, and I will ever be thy faithful
slave."</p>

<p>"I will be a guardian and protector to thee, Khatoun," 
replied the prince, "but a master no longer&mdash;thou 
art no more a slave, thou art free. I owe
this to thee. Go where thou wilt&mdash;seek thine own
home, or remain here if thou wouldst rather, in my
household&mdash;the choice is thine."</p>

<p>Her countenance brightened not at this gift,
though inestimable, of liberty, but she replied&mdash;"I 
wish it not. I came hither ignorant, and thou
hast enlightened me&mdash;alone, and thou wert kind to
me&mdash;friendless, and for a while thou lovedst me.
Though thou art changed, yet I would not leave
thee. I have no home but here, no liberty but in
being thy slave."</p>

<p>"Well, it shall be as thou wilt," replied the
prince&mdash;"thy books, thy lute, the freedom of the
harem are restored to thee. Henceforth be happy&mdash;thou 
wilt forget thy sorrows ere a moon rolls
by."</p>

<p>"I can easily forget my <i>sorrows</i>," answered

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

Khatoun, sighing, "but I cannot so easily drown
the remembrance of joys that have once been mine.
But talk not of happiness to me, my lord; I look not
for it upon this earth&mdash;it has gone, never to return.
But heed it not. I can be content perhaps&mdash;content 
to pass the few days that yet remain to me,
thinking of thee, till they are ended. 'Twill be
my last sad solace, to dream of love that has for
ever departed."</p>

<p>"Forget me, as one unworthy of thee," said the
prince. "Be advised, Khatoun, receive thy liberty
at my hands, and seek elsewhere a lover, a husband, 
and a home. I will endow thee richly, and
there are many youths in Bagdad would strive for
the possession of thy fair hand. Think well of it,
thy heart may yet burn with new hopes and new
joys; and in these thou shalt forget him, who must
forget thee. Remember! there is no refuge <i>from</i>
love but <i>in love again</i>."</p>

<p>Khatoun looked in wonder upon the prince, and
answered, "Dost thou say this, my lord! love
again? how blinded have I been? Thou hast
never known this passion, or thou wouldst not
speak thus lightly of it. Love another! sayst
thou? it is impossible! Were the treasures of earth
and heaven offered to me, I could not be bribed by
them to do it. I could not frame a thought, a wish
for any, any one but thee. Love another! I could
no more do it than&mdash;ask thine own heart, my lord,
if I speak not the truth&mdash;than thou canst love
Khatoun."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

<p>"Thou sayst rightly," replied the prince, silenced
by this direct appeal to his own feelings; "the
affections will not be controlled. Think no more
of it&mdash;these palace halls are free and spacious;
every pleasure shall here wait upon thee, and time
will soften, if it does not remove thy sorrows."</p>

<p>" 'Tis as I thought!" he exclaimed, when he had
retired a few paces apart, and meditated for a
moment upon the prospect before him. " 'Tis as
I thought. Those lines were written by the calif.
Ay, it was a treacherous snare, one worthy of my
crafty master. But with the aid of Heaven I may
avoid it My fault is as yet undiscovered, and but
for Hassan's death might even be unsuspected.
From that quarter comes the danger&mdash;I cannot
doubt it. How, since she is innocent, can I excuse
that deed? How can I satisfy my doubting master?&mdash;and 
every slight suspicion must be driven
from his mind&mdash;all his misgivings banished, ere I
can fly hence with safety. If she would own herself 
thus false, if with her own lips she would confess 
the deed I deemed her guilty of, all might be
well. Yet, can I urge her to it? Can I bid her,
suffering and innocent as she is, thus wrong her
honour? I cannot&mdash;'tis too cruel! Yet why should
I not? 'Tis her own folly that has brought this
present danger upon us. I must not be wanting
to myself&mdash;to <i>her</i>, my trembling, innocent wife, in
this peril. I must close up every avenue through
which destruction may enter to devour all I love.
The evil is but temporary, and should not weigh

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

for a moment against those which threaten our
safety. Lost fame may again return, and the
world's favour is soon regained; but death's cold
grasp is ruthless and enduring&mdash;its icy hand will
not release its victim."</p>

<p>With the air of one who has taken some trying
resolution, and has steeled his mind to its execution, 
he now turned and addressed the young slave.
"Thou wilt be happy here&mdash;fear not but thou wilt;
and when death shall take me hence, as it soon
will, Khatoun, I will not leave thee without a home,
and without wealth sufficient for all thy wishes."</p>

<p>"Thou affrightest me with those gloomy tones,
my lord," she answered. "Why talk thus? Danger 
cannot surely come nigh such as thou, so powerful, 
so well esteemed."</p>

<p>"It is nearer than thou art aware. My stern
master is even now marking me for his victim.
Thou dost start! thou weepest! know thou art
lamenting one whom thine own folly has destroyed."</p>

<p>"<i>I!</i>&mdash;how? how have I done this?" said the
terrified girl. "It cannot be."</p>

<p>"Were it not so, I would not charge thee with
it. Thou hast heard, doubtless, bruited throughout
the palace, the strict command by which the calif
has enslaved my marriage with his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Some rumour I have heard&mdash;some strange
rumour; but held it as an idle tale&mdash;the busy
scandal of the harem, rather than truth."</p>

<p>"And of the threatened doom?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

<p>"Nothing, my lord, so may Heaven bless me,
nothing."</p>

<p>"That it was <i>death?</i>"</p>

<p>"I knew it not. Allah preserve thee from the
fate! But how does this point to me, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Most clearly. How were my disobedience
known save for thee? Safe from all danger, I
rested in security, until thy jealousy sent Hassan
upon his ill-fated errand. Then came discovery&mdash;then 
fear and danger&mdash;and death follows close
upon the victim's track. If thou hast not known
of this&mdash;if thy lips have not imparted the secret,
yet thy base messenger has disclosed all to the
angry calif. Yes, Khatoun, death comes to me at
thy hands. I have deserved this, thou wilt say,
for I have deeply injured thee; but the princess!
she has not harmed thee, yet she must equally
suffer."</p>

<p>Khatoun listened to the prince's words with a
countenance in which doubt and terror seemed
equally mingled. As he proceeded, the latter emotion 
predominated more and more, until he had
ceased speaking, when she was silent for a moment, 
following out in her own thoughts the chain
of evidence by which Giafar was led to accuse
her as the author of his ruin, until she seemed to
have reached the last link, and as she found it centered 
in her, that her jealousy and anger had caused
this danger, wonder was no more seen in her features, 
but chilling horror, like a driving wind, swept
across her pale face, and she exclaimed in piercing

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

tones, "I see it!&mdash;it is so&mdash;have mercy, Allah!
But I will die with thee, Giafar. Upon thy grave
will I breathe this worthless life away to expiate
my folly."</p>

<p>"No grave will enclose the traitor's body," replied 
the prince, with melancholy and cruel sternness. 
"This carcass, torn and mangled, will be
scattered to the winds of heaven, or wither upon
the walls of Bagdad, a hideous monument of the
calif's vengeance. Scarce a vestige will remain
of him who now speaks to thee, for friends to weep
over&mdash;if there are any left to mourn me!"</p>

<p>"Hold! hold!" shrieked the young girl, wild
with horror; "these words will kill me. Yet no&mdash;speak 
on, speak on. Death I would welcome&mdash;or
thou canst do it with this steel, Giafar," and she
grasped convulsively his scimitar, and half drew
the blade from its sheath.</p>

<p>Giafar raised her from his bosom, where she had
fallen in the exertion, and looking upon her more
mildly, said, "Pray not for this, Khatoun. No&mdash;live 
to redeem and save those whom thy folly has
endangered. It may be that thou canst repair the
evil thou hast wrought."</p>

<p>"How? tell me!" she interrupted, quickly;
"will my life, torture, courage&mdash;anything to do or
suffer? Tell me in haste&mdash;I cannot bear this
agony." 'Twas pictured in her face, agony, torturing, 
piercing, such as her weakened frame could
not long support.</p>

<p>Giafar trembled for a moment, lest he had overtasked 

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

her powers of endurance, and hastened to
reply&mdash;"Mind not my words, Khatoun; they
were harshly spoken. Thou canst without suffering 
or danger do that which may save me from
threatening ruin. I would not have spoken thus
sternly but to render thee sensible of the horrors
that thou thyself hast brought upon me, and upon
one I love, that thou shouldst the more readily do
that which may dispel them."</p>

<p>"Was it necessary to do this, my lord?" said
Khatoun, reproachfully, but still trembling with
emotion. "Dost thou not know that I would give
my life for thine, that I would do anything to serve
thee?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me calmly," replied Giafar, "and
then answer. Thou alone art privy to a secret
which might destroy me; no one living but thee
knows of my fault. Hassan is dead&mdash;yes, this
scimitar is yet stained with his blood. From thee,
then, and thee alone, can come the proof which
must condemn me."</p>

<p>"I will not breathe it, Giafar," exclaimed Khatoun, 
interrupting him&mdash;"no threat, no torture can
unclose my lips when thou bidst me be silent."</p>

<p>"This is not enough; no common denial can
avail. The calif himself will question thee, and
thou wilt find in him a stern interrogator. Thou
must frame the falsehood with a face of innocence.
There must be no faltering of the voice, no look
of fear, no trembling, to betray thee to thine observing 
judge; this were worse than idle."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

<p>"Oh! I will do this&mdash;nay, how could I do aught
else, for I know naught, save from things own words,
that could injure thee. Is this all, then? Give me
a task more difficult, more dangerous&mdash;one which
may prove my penitence and truth."</p>

<p>"I have not told thee yet," replied the prince;
"strengthen thy mind to hear me, for the task may
not be easy to perform. Do not smile so confidently, 
but listen: I have fears&mdash;no matter why&mdash;'twere 
needless to inform thee&mdash;that the death of
Hassan is known to the calif. It was done in secret.
I waited not for the law to award the sentence of
his death, but smote him swiftly and surely, while
busied in his base purpose, in the very act of watching 
my most sacred hours. Even where he stood
he fell, ere he could turn him from the treacherous
deed. Silence like that of the tomb, for which I
destined him, has rested upon his fate. But I have
had a sure warning that his death is known to my
master&mdash;the hour is hardly passed that brought
with it a token of discovery, and a threat of punishment; 
thence is my only source of fear. Could
I avouch to the calif some plea for his execution,
one which would fully justify its secrecy and despatch, 
then would I bid defiance to danger. There
is one&mdash;canst thou not guess it? the crime of which
I held him guilty, and in which till now I deemed
thee a partaker; this would serve such purpose.
Thou seest this?"</p>

<p>"Most plainly, my lord," answered Khatoun.
"But whither tend thy words?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

<p>"When my master shall charge me with his
death&mdash;when he shall accuse me of having destroyed 
him that I might remove a witness of mine
own fault&mdash;how shall I answer? He is innocent
of that crime by which I hoped to palliate the
deed. Seest thou not how thou canst avert this
danger? Bear for a while the imputation of this
guilt, and satisfy the calif that his suspicions are
unfounded. Dost thou not comprehend?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not yet!" said the young girl, drawing
her breath with difficulty, and compressing her
pale lips. "Go on! tell me all!"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> told thee, Khatoun," said Giafar, unwilling 
to repeat what he had said, "but thou wilt not
heed me."</p>

<p>"Will not my life suffice? Take it, and then
say what thou wilt of me. I could not bear it living, 
but in the grave I shall not hear this baseness
uttered of me. Will not this satisfy thee?"</p>

<p>"Thy death!&mdash;I ask it not. Thou wilt live to
be the guardian and protector of thy master; own,
but for a time, this thing&mdash;'tis but a word&mdash;and
safety and happiness shall come to us again."</p>

<p>The poor girl wrung her hands in anguish, and
looked wildly to heaven, while Giafar was speaking, 
but not the slightest moisture bedimmed her
eyes. This was a trial too keen, too humiliating
for tears&mdash;or it may be that the sources which
should have supplied them had been drained by
her continued sorrows. When he had ended, she
exclaimed,</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

<p>"Oh, no! no! do not ask it of me. Not for the
lives of thousands would I own myself so vile a
thing. Thou mayst say it of me, my lord, if it
will avail aught, and I will not open my lips to
assert mine innocence. If the calif should inquire
of me if I am thus guilty, I can be silent. But
never could my tongue&mdash;to think&mdash;a slave&mdash;the
words would choke my utterance. Do not look so
angrily upon me. Frown not. I would perish
for thee&mdash;but ask me not with mine own voice to
proclaim such evil of myself."</p>

<p>"I am not angry with thee, Khatoun," said Giafar, 
relentingly, "my frowns are not meant for
thee. No, they are for the cruel, threatening horrors 
that surround me. I blame thee not for this
refusal. Let it pass. Farewell; others besides
thyself can suffer firmly. Allah strengthen her
and thee too! Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Stay! stay!" she exclaimed, detaining him
with a slight grasp. "I shall yet do it. Urge me&mdash;entreat 
me&mdash;I cannot at once consent."</p>

<p>"Hear me, Khatoun," said Giafar. "I will not
urge thee; I will not even repeat my wish to thee.
I do not wonder that thou shouldst feel thus keenly.
'Tis hard to bring the lips to speak our own shame&mdash;even 
for man 'tis hard; but for thy helpless sex,
whose fame a breath&mdash;a word&mdash;may spot irrevocably, 
'tis doubly so. I have asked too much of
thee. Mind not what I have said. Forget it.
Let it not dwell a moment in thy memory."</p>

<p>"I will do it, my lord," said the young girl, assuming 

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

a desperate firmness&mdash;"I will do all you
wish. Yes, bring me to the calif, and you will
wonder to hear with what effrontery I will own
such baseness of myself. By this I shall redeem
my errors&mdash;shall I not?"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt do more than this," said Giafar,
pressing her compassionately to his bosom. "Thou
wilt load me with a debt of gratitude that I can
never repay. And bear in mind, Khatoun, this
evil is but for a time. If I escape the fate that
now hangs suspended over my head, fear not but
that this stain upon thine honour shall be all wiped
away; and if I perish, my latest breath shall avow
thine innocence. All the world shall yet praise
thee for the generous deed. There is a gay life
before thee, and, believe me, thou wilt not the less
enjoy its blessings, for that thou hast served, even
with more than life, an unworthy master."</p>

<p>A melancholy smile played upon her features as
she listened to this vain encouragement of the
prince, and she replied,</p>

<p>"All this is nothing to me. Talk not of honour
and the world's esteem; they have but little value
in mine eyes. Think you it is for these I hesitate?
Ah no! a secret shrinking, a dread repugnance to
a crime of which I cannot think but with a
of horror&mdash;'tis this that is so hard to overcome.
But I have resolved&mdash;for thee I have resolved 
to do even this. I would fain imagine,
standing, as I think I do, upon the borders of the
grave, that it is for justice, for mercy, for the sake

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

of thine innocent, thine unoffending wife, that I
make this fearful sacrifice. But 'tis in vain. I
cannot thus deceive myself. No, it is love that
prompts me. Let me, for the last time, avow it;
and here, in the view of all the evils I have brought
upon thee, for ever I renounce it. Remorse and
penitence alone remain. Yet I have one request,
my lord; the princess&mdash;she must not think this of
me. Spare me that degradation. Let her not
believe that one whom you have loved could ever
fall so low."</p>

<p>"She shall know all, Khatoun. She is as generous 
and gentle as thyself, and thou wilt for ever
gain her esteem and her affection."</p>

<p>"May I not see her? May I not be with her
for the few mournful days that remain to me? No
one will smile upon me now. My companions
will all shun me&mdash;yes, some that once loved me
well. Where should I turn? As well dwell here
alone, in this prison, as wander deserted and solitary 
through the harem, all scorning me as I pass.
I shall not bring reproach upon her in the solitude
of her chamber. I will attend her and be her
<i>slave</i>."</p>

<p>Giafar hesitated ere he replied. With the attachment 
which the young girl still manifested
towards him, he felt that it would be far more conducive 
to her peace if she were separated from his
society. He feared, too, that her heart would be
often pained to witness the warm love which he
bore to Abassa, a feeling which would be frequently 

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

displayed in kind looks and words, and the
many endearing offices which declare its existence
as well as minister to its life. She quickly divined
the cause of his delay, and said,</p>

<p>"Wherefore dost thou hesitate, my lord? Fear
not but I shall be faithful. Doubt not my constancy 
of temper. What is there left on earth for
one like me but to serve, while I yet live, those that
I love&mdash;to rejoice in their happiness and to weep
over their sorrows. I think of nothing beyond this
now&mdash;save it be the grave."</p>

<p>"It shall be so," replied the prince. "Thou
shalt be with her, Khatoun, and ever share her
fortune."</p>

<p>After bidding her a kind farewell, Giafar departed.</p>

<p>"Am I steeled to sorrow?" he exclaimed, as
soon as he had left her presence. "Do not mine
eyes weep? Or is it triumph and hope that bear
me thus up? No!&mdash;a tear!&mdash;Allah be praised!
this heart is not of stone. How have I wronged
this faithful girl. To what a trial have I urged
her. She will do it, and all through love for me&mdash;her 
cruel master&mdash;it may be, her destroyer.
Were it but my own life, how gladly would I yield
it up to spare her this anguish. But my wife&mdash;my
innocent wife&mdash;perhaps my whole house&mdash;Heaven
shield them! I will no longer dwell upon it. She
shall be well repaid for all her sufferings. There
is yet light around me," he continued. "All is, I
think, secured. Upon the morrow I will seek my

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

master, and banish all his doubts. Deep guile
must be upon my tongue. I must frame my lips to
falsehood, and coin a tale smooth as the one which
the first serpent whispered to our erring mother.
'Tis a vile part to act, yet will not want some
merit if borne with courage and with skill. Even
ill is not all ill, if well and bravely done. My
stern master has watched, most like with cruel
pleasure, the care which has concealed the death
of Hassan, waiting like the ambushed tiger to grasp
his prey. But to the craft, he has not joined the
patience of that fierce beast. He could not wait
until the victim was within his reach, as soon it
must have been, certainly, and without hope. Too
eager in his vengeance, he has left the covert, and
leaped to meet his victim. Now that I watch the
spring, I may perchance avoid it. He himself
has warned me, and I will not slight his words.
Heaven arm me with courage, and pardon all my
falsehood! I struggle for a rich prize."</p>

That threatening, rested on him&mdash;his cheek

<p class="right"><i>Play of the Assassin</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rumours</span> are current throughout Bagdad, which,
if well founded, must implicate the safety of one of
the most important personages in the kingdom. It
often chances that he, whose happiness is most nearly
concerned in such secret and spreading whisperings,
is the last to hear of their existence. Friends
are, it may be, ignorant as himself, or hesitate to become
the heralds of ill fortune to one they love. He
walks in blindness even to the verge of the precipice, 
and perishes, perhaps, for lack of that knowledge 
which, if timely, might have turned him from
danger.</p>

<p>Thus was it with Giafar, when on the day succeeding 
the one on which he had held the interview 
with Khatoun, he bent his steps towards the
royal palace. The purpose of his visit to the calif
was to remove the jealousy which he knew his

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

master entertained against him, and by the testimony 
of Khatoun to establish a belief of his innocence. 
But he knew not of the mine that was
ready to spring beneath his feet. Many dangers
which had encompassed him seemed removed, or
fast vanishing; hope buoyed up his courage, and
led him to expect a favourable termination to his
fears.</p>

<p>Not thus unapprised, however, was the calif of
the reports which so nearly concerned the prince's
safety. Willing tongues bear the tidings of another's 
fault. They have reached the ears of the
monarch, and his haughty spirit is aroused. Suspicion 
had long slept within his bosom, and now,
aroused as it was by the voice of rumour, woke
into distressing, torturing certainty. He walks the
palace halls with a brow frowning, and features
black as night. He stamps upon the marble floor;
the sound, reverberating through the vaulted chambers, 
falls upon the hearts of his slaves, and chills
them with fear. They flee from his presence; or
if, perchance, they meet him, their faces are in the
dust. They dare not look upon him in his anger.
The venerable Iahia alone ventures into his presence. 
Haroun turns from him, exclaiming, "Thy
son&mdash;thy son&mdash;old man! Let him look well to his
head."</p>

<p>"Which son, my lord?" said Iahia, tremblingly;
but the old man's heart well told him which.</p>

<p>"Giafar&mdash;the wretch!" was the stern reply.</p>

<p>"He is here, my lord," and as Iahia spoke the
young prince entered.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

<p>Giafar saw, in the frowning and impassioned
mien of his master, an index of the tempest within
his bosom, and divined immediately some new
cause for fear. It was the momentary depression
caused by this feeling, probably, that rendered his
prostration before the calif more prolonged and profound 
than ordinary. Or perhaps, he so demeaned
himself, that he might gain time to divest his features 
of the agitation that for an instant shook
them; and to collect and reassure his self-command 
ere he arose. He had scarcely time to effect 
this, if such was his purpose, ere the voice of
Haroun sounded on his ear, in those withering and
thrilling tones which that monarch could so well
assume.</p>

<p>"Well mayst thou hide thy face in the dust, vile
slave! well mayst thou crouch to earth, and grow
pale in the presence of thine offended master."</p>

<p>"Shadow of God upon the earth!" replied the
prince, with all the composure which he could assume, 
"is it permitted to thy slave to speak?"</p>

<p>"Speak, but weigh well thy words," answered
the calif; "for thou standest upon the verge of the
tomb."</p>

<p>"Anger sits in the face of my lord. His ire is
aroused against his servant. Yet, ere the blow
falls, may he not know the crime for which he is
to suffer?"</p>

<p>"Thou art trifling with thy life, slave, to speak
thus to me," said the monarch. "Canst thou not
guess thy fault?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

<p>"It were false, my lord," answered Giafar, "to
say that I could not. I know too well the origin of
all thine anger and thy distrust against me, though
I thought not that they were thus aroused. This
paper, brought to me by some unknown hand, first
informed me that I was held by thee as one guilty
of falsehood and disobedience. It threatens punishment 
likewise, and counsels flight."</p>

<p>"Whence came it?" said the calif, scarce looking 
at the scroll.</p>

<p>"I know not, my lord," answered Giafar; "neither 
can I divine its purpose."</p>

<p>"Hast thou heard naught besides this?" inquired
Haroun, sternly. "Knowest thou not of the tales
that ring throughout the city? tales of thy falsehood, 
and of my credulous folly? Hark, as thou
walkest the streets, to the tongues that proclaim
thee a false subject, and a perjured prince. By Allah! 
the very winds are bearing my dishonour
widely throughout the kingdom. But thou shalt
die for it, Giafar."</p>

<p>"They speak falsely, my lord, that so speak,"
answered the prince, enduring, unmoved, the withering 
look which accompanied the calif's words.
"But what avails denial when the sentence has
gone forth? The life of the slave is in the hands
of his master."</p>

<p>"Thou sayst rightly," said Haroun, quickly.
"And were it not so, I should look to see thee,
scimitar in hand, disputing my authority. But with
all thy treachery, thou art not thus far gone in folly
and in madness."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

<p>"How, my lord, against thee!" exclaimed the
prince. "Let the blow descend then at once, since
thou deemest me thus faithless. Yet hear me
while I assert, that were the doom of a traitor now
to be executed upon this body, it could not fall upon
one more faithful, more devoted to thy service."</p>

<p>"That time is past when thou mightst have said
this, Giafar," answered the calif, yielding somewhat
in the severity of his tone, though still speaking
with fearful and gloomy calmness. "A year since,
and had a prophet told me that thou wouldst thus
stand before me a false and sentenced man, I would
have spurned him. But the will of Allah be done!
Thou art surely guilty, and as surely shalt thou
suffer. All thine art is vain. Though practised
in cunning, it cannot avail thee now. Hast thou
not dishonoured and disobeyed me? hast thou not&mdash;but 
there is a partner in thy guilt. Ye have
sinned together, and together would I question ye.
Together," he added, after a short pause, "together
ye must suffer. Return to thy house and bring
hither the princess my daughter."</p>

<p>Giafar's heart sank within him at hearing these
words. It was a task to which his bold and ready
courage was scarce equal&mdash;to endure the searching
scrutiny of his master, and he knew that the gentle
spirit of his wife would not support her in the trial.
He answered, however, firmly, "She is ill at ease,
my lord&mdash;fitter for the sick couch, if she be not
already there, and for the care of the physician,
than to come forth from her chamber."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

<p>"Ha!" said the monarch, with a penetrating
glance&mdash;"what aileth her?"</p>

<p>"Little skill of the hakim have I, my lord, save
it be for wound of sword, or prick of barbed arrow.
Strange fancies seem to disturb her brain, her frame
is feverish and feeble; more than this I know not."</p>

<p>"She shall be well cared for," said Haroun.
"The physician of our own household shall bestow
his skill upon her. Go seek Gabriel Bact Jeschoua,
and bring him into my presence."</p>

<p>Giafar was silent, bowed lowly, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"How sayst thou, old man?" said the Commander 
of the Faithful to Iahia, after the prince had
departed&mdash;"how sayst thou? Is not the bird taken
in the snare?"</p>

<p>"It may be so, my lord," replied Iahia; "yet
mine eye could see no fluttering in the captive, no
consciousness of guilt, no fear."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest not thy son, Iahia, though thou
hast reared him, if thou lookest for these. I well
believe he would not tremble on the bridge Al Sirat,
could mortal boldness avail in that perilous passage."</p>

<p>"Should he be guilty, as thou thinkest, is there
not forgiveness in thy hand?" inquired the old man.
"Remember his past services, my lord."</p>

<p>"They are forgotten," answered the calif; "and
were they without number, would be all obliterated
by the black ingratitude with which he has repaid
my kindness to him. Speak not in the traitor's
behalf."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

<p>"He is my son, most mighty sovereign, and, as
I hope, no traitor. If not for his own sake, for the
sake of these white hairs that have grown gray in
thy court, forgive him. Remember! paradise is
reserved for him who pardoneth offences."</p>

<p>"Who art thou, worm!" exclaimed the calif,
indignantly, "that thou shouldst withstand my
wrath? Should his whole tribe plead for the slave,
it would not shield him, though, by the beard of
my father, it might peril much their own safety."
The reply of Iahia was prevented by the return
of the prince, who entered followed by the hakim
Gabriel. The years of Gabriel Bact Jeschoua
(or the Christian Gabriel, as he was called, from
the creed which he professed) were about threescore 
and ten. He was remarkably tall and spare,
yet his flowing robes, and his long but thin white
beard, which reached nearly to the ground, gave
him an impressive appearance. His face was pale
and meditative, and his eyes wore that haggard
expression, which is the result of long and frequent
watching, yet there was a mildness about his features 
that was peculiarly attractive. After he had
arisen from a precise and grave prostration before
the Commander of the Faithful, Haroun thus addressed 
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast not been so wrapped in thy studies,
learned hakim, as to have forgotten that Giafar al
Barmeki is my son-in-law?"</p>

<p>"I know it, sire," answered the hakim.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

<p>"And the terms of that union thou mayst likewise 
remember?"</p>

<p>"Something I have heard of them, strange, and,
as I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will not tax thy wisdom, good Gabriel,"
interrupted the calif, "for an opinion as to their
fitness. Such were my commands. How if they
have been disobeyed? if mine authority has been
slighted, mine honour trampled in the dust? What
thinkest thou of it?"</p>

<p>"An offence most heinous, exceeding heinous,"
replied the sage.</p>

<p>"Ay!" exclaimed the calif, "and by Allah! I
swear the punishment shall amply equal the offence.
The scimitar will not wear its edge after having
passed over the guilty one and his house."</p>

<p>"Knowest thou, my lord, that this evil hath been
done?"</p>

<p>"I well know it," answered the calif. "I tell
thee, hakim, that the dishonour of my house is in
the mouths of all Bagdad. The very children at
their play prate of the false Giafar, and his doting
master. Hast thou not heard these things?"</p>

<p>"Some rumour of this sort reached me to-day,"
replied the physician, "but I turned mine ear from
the tale. The wise man hearkens not to the scandal 
of fools, and the voice of the multitude is no
meet counsel for princes in their anger."</p>

<p>The calif noted the reproof which the words of
the hakim conveyed, and answered, "Thou hast
spoken wisely, Gabriel. But when the people cry

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

'there is fire within the walls,' let the sage look for
the spark. Rumours the most improbable are
always reared upon some foundation, though it
may be slight. I do not heed these, however. I
will be just. I will not punish the traitor, save
upon the full proof of his guilt. Listen, learned
hakim, I have this for thee to do. Go to the prince's
palace, there thou wilt find my daughter. She is
ill, and may need thy care. Enlighten thyself
well as to the source of her complainings, and&mdash;mark 
me well!&mdash;return not hither until thou art
assured whether&mdash;the curse of Eblis light on busy
tongues!&mdash;whether these tales that are abroad be
true or no."</p>

<p>"Alas! my lord, thy servant cannot do this. His
skill is unequal to the task. There may be others
in thy court who can serve thee better in this
thing."</p>

<p>"What dost thou in my household then, or with
those robes, if thy skill is naught, when most
needed?" exclaimed the calif, angrily. "By this
hand, if thou wilt not obey&mdash;or cannot&mdash;I care
not which&mdash;I will have thy beard torn from thee,
and, stripped of thy grave apparel, thou shall be
scourged from the city gates."</p>

<p>"Thou urgest me to a task beyond my power,
most potent sovereign. My lord cannot know how
dark, how difficult is the duty which he has assigned 
his servant. Diseases, like the chameleon,
are ever changing their hues&mdash;to know them we
must still study them anew. Yet more are they

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

like that strange insect which takes its colour from
the surface upon which it creeps. The All-wise,
in his power, has framed man of the same clay,
yet not alike. The sinews, the nerves of thy frame
are far different from those of a frail and delicate
maiden, and the sickness that would scarcely make
thee droop, would wellnigh part soul and body in
her. Each mortal differs from his fellow, so likewise 
differ in them diseases. Small skill is requisite 
to apply ointment to the wound, but 'tis most
difficult to probe it. 'Tis easy to administer a
healing drug, yet hard to know whence comes the
pain that needs its succour. This is an art which
is only acquired by years of daily toil and midnight
study, which the wisdom of ages has not yet perfected, 
and will not, as I think. To know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, prate no more of thy craft," said the
calif, cutting short the old man in his speech. "I
have heard enough. Away to this duty, and fail
not, when thou shalt return, to account to me fully
of all that I shall inquire of thee. Speak not, but
away."</p>

<p>The tone and manner of the calif were decisive,
and admitted of no appeal. Sensible of this, the
sage retired, much disturbed by the errand on
which he was employed, muttering, as he took
leave, "I will go&mdash;Esculapius aid me! Thy servant 
will go, my lord."</p>

<p>It were a vain attempt to describe the feelings
of the young prince, as at his master's command
he followed him into a retired apartment of the

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

palace. The doubt&mdash;the fear&mdash;the irresolution
that made up the anguish of his soul, words cannot 
speak, nor pen describe them. Yet, like unwritten 
paper, Giafar's countenance told nothing
of what was rending his bosom. He might pass
unharmed through the dread ordeal of his master's
scrutiny. Clothed in the armour of cool and unbending 
courage, he had hoped to come unscathed
from the flame. Yet now, if such should be the
issue of his address, even while exulting in his escape, 
might come the ill-omened messenger, the
prying hakim, with damning evidence of his disobedience, 
to plunge him deeper into ruin. Which
way to turn?&mdash;what path to follow? To throw
himself at the calif's feet, confess his guilt, and beg
submissively for pardon?&mdash;no, <i>that</i> chance he had
cast away. He had appeared before his master
with a face of innocence; and now to do this, were
the effect, plain and glaring, not of contrition, but
of despair. "No!" said Giafar to himself, "it
would be vain. The way is steep and dangerous,
but it lies straight before me, and by Mohammed, I
will tread it firmly, and with courage, if the steps
should be my last." He cast a glance at his aged
father ere he left the hall, and in his looks he read
that which nerved and strengthened him; in them
was seen sorrow, deep and heartrending, yet
mingled there, was proud exultation, as he gazed
upon his patient, bold, and suffering son.</p>

<p>The apartment to which the calif led the way
was a small and darkly furnished chamber. A

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

curtain of black velvet hung from the ceiling, shutting 
out, for the most part, the light which entered
at the windows, while the few rays that escaped
from behind its folds were reflected from walls
painted in sad and gloomy colours. A single
taper was burning, which threw its flickering and
uncertain light upon the dusky furniture of the
chamber.</p>

<p>"What may thine anger portend, my lord?"
said the wondering Giafar, when the calif had
seated himself.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, slave, and then answer. With
all the ingratitude that is infused into thy base soul,
thou canst not deny my goodness to thee. I have
heaped honour and riches upon thee, and upon thy
father's house. Even to the full extent of my
power, I have done this. I have allied thee to my
family, have given to thee in marriage my daughter,
and upon thine enjoyment of all these favours have
placed but one restriction. This thou hast transgressed&mdash;nay, 
deny it not. 'Twill but increase
thy guilt."</p>

<p>"Hear me, my most noble sovereign. I am
guiltless of this," said the prince, throwing himself
at his master's feet. "I know that my life hangs
by a single thread; yet in the face of this danger,
while breath remains in these nostrils, I will not
cease to declare mine innocence."</p>

<p>"Recall what thou hast said," exclaimed the
calif. "Confess thy guilt, and die at least honourably, 
if thou hast not lived thus. The proofs are

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

most clear, and thou well knowest cannot fail fully
to condemn thee. A member of thine own household 
is here to attest thy guilt."</p>

<p>"How!" said the prince; "of mine own household? 
Who? Confront me with the wretch. In
my presence he would be dumb, or speak but to
avow his falsehood."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the monarch, and he clapped his
hands thrice together and called loudly on Hassan.
At the sound of that name Giafar started, then
turning, looked upon a sight which struck him with
horror. The curtain had been drawn, and in the
full light which came from two capacious windows,
the murdered slave was standing as in life erect.
His face was of the hue of death, pale and ghastly,
and his glaring eyes were fixed steadily upon the
prince. One hand rested against his bosom, while
the other pointed to heaven, as though in an appeal 
to the Divinity for the truth of some asseveration, 
which had but just passed from his cold and
closed lips. No voice was heard, it is true&mdash;it
seemed as though the slave had but that moment
ceased to speak, and was looking accusingly upon
Giafar for his reply. How! had the grave given
up its victim? Had the vindictive spirit returned
to its mutilated body, for vengeance against the
author of his death? This sudden and startling
display of terror shook even the firm nerves of
the prince. He was bearing up and striving
against his fears, when the stern voice of his master 
sounded on his ear, saying,</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

<p>"Look upon him, Giafar! Look, if thy fears
will let thee. He will speak anon, and charge
thee with thy treachery."</p>

<p>And to the fancy of the prince the lips of the
slave seemed to unclose, as if about to speak; but
he waited not to hear if sound or words came from
that chilling spectre. Overcome with horror, he
bowed before the calif's feet, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Guilty, my lord! guilty!"</p>

<p>Haroun smiled in vindictive triumph at Giafar's
acknowledgment of his guilt, and seemed about to
pronounce some dreadful sentence against the culprit, 
perhaps even summarily to execute it with
his own hands. But the prince's fortitude had forsaken 
him for a moment only. It was not in his
character to surrender hope and life without a desperate 
struggle. Yet had his own fate alone depended 
upon the issue of that trying moment, it
had been fixed, sealed beyond recovery, and the
utmost infliction of the calif's vengeance would
perhaps have been a welcome release from the
dread trial of that hour. But he endured and
struggled for others besides himself. With a glance
like that of the lightning upon the perils that surrounded 
him, he gave one thought upon his wife,
his father, and his brothers, and then, though looking 
every moment for the return of the hakim,
with the last evidence of his guilt and the seal of
his condemnation, he collected all his firmness, and
slowly raising his head, added,</p>

<p>"<i>Guilty of the death of the slave</i>."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

<p>The calif's brow darkened in disappointed anger, 
and he exclaimed, "How, wretch?"</p>

<p>"Guilty of the death of Hassan, my lord," replied 
the prince. He had not time for more. He
saw that the calif's scimitar was unsheathed, and
raised above his head, and he bent his neck to receive 
the stroke&mdash;pronouncing, at the same time,
aloud, the confession of his faith. "There is no
God but God, and Mohammed is the prophet of
God." But the blow fell not, and Giafar felt like
one recalled from the dead, when he heard his
master's voice saying, "Speak on, Giafar; I will
yet hear thee."</p>

<p>The prince lifted up his head from the dust.
His face was calm and unmoved. Despair had
well composed its lineaments, and he answered
firmly. "I am guilty of this, my lord. He betrayed 
and deceived me, and I slew him. It was a
rash act, yet he well deserved his fate; for he had
violated the honour of the harem; and for this, if I
merit death, I am ready to suffer it from thy hands,"
and he bent his head again before the calif's feet.
Fierce and contending emotions struggled within
the monarch's bosom, and under their influence, his
frame trembled like a leaf shaken by the wind. He
clutched his scimitar with a convulsive grasp,
viewed for a moment its shining surface, cast a
glance at the prostrate person of the prince, and
then, as though afraid to trust the weapon within
his hands, hurled it hastily from him, to the farthest 
end of the apartment. At the sound of the

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

scimitar, as it fell clashing and clanging upon the
floor, the prince looked up, and said, "Is my
crime forgiven me, my lord? and do I owe my life
to thy clemency?"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt drive me mad, Giafar. Why didst
thou own this paltry crime, as though it were one
I could not pardon? Was it thy purpose thus to
torture me? Thou well knowest that I would forgive 
thee the death of a thousand slaves like this;
for thou art," he added, moved to admiration, for a
moment, by the prince's wonderful composure;
"thou art, in bravery and firmness, the same Giafar 
that I once well loved. But why do I speak
thus to a traitor? Thou art doubly dyed in ingratitude. 
Thou hast courage only to oppose, and
firmness to withstand, thy master. But, answer
me&mdash;is it thy custom to shed blood in the rich kiosk, 
and punish guilt in the chambers of thy retirement? 
Why, too, hast thou kept his death a
secret!"</p>

<p>"I smote him," answered the prince, "there,
where I first discovered his treachery, upon the
instant, in a burst of anger; and was it strange,
my lord, that I should seek to hide such dishonour
from the world?"</p>

<p>"I grant it may be as thou sayst. Yet there
has been another victim to thy suspicions&mdash;a female 
slave, one whom thou art said to have once
loved. For what was she punished?"</p>

<p>"Was her name Khatoun, my lord?" inquired
the prince.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

<p>"Ay," answered the calif. "I am not ignorant
of the dark deeds that are done within the walls of
thy palace."</p>

<p>"She was a partaker in Hassan's guilt, my lord,
and well deserved to share his fate."</p>

<p>"I believe thee not," said the calif, angrily.
"Thy tongue is steeped in falsehood. She knew
of thy disobedience&mdash;<i>this</i> was her crime. She was
a witness, as I doubt not, of thy guilt; and for this,
wretch, was she slain."</p>

<p>"She was not slain, my lord," answered the
prince, quickly.</p>

<p>"Thou liest, slave!" said Haroun, breaking forth
into ungovernable rage, and seizing the poniard
which he wore at his girdle; "by this hand, thou
liest! The grass is not yet green over her grave.
She sleeps her long sleep, by the southern wall of
thy gardens upon the Tigris."</p>

<p>"That grave is tenantless," exclaimed the prince.
"It was destined for yon traitor's body. Khatoun
yet lives, my lord; thou mayst see, and speak with
her, if thou wilt."</p>

<p>"God grant that thy words are truth!" exclaimed 
the monarch, rising and pacing the apartment; 
then striking his hand upon his agitated bosom, 
he added: "But if thou hast deceived me,
thou shalt be torn by wild horses for this. I did
not think there breathed a mortal who could move
me thus&mdash;not even thou, Giafar, as thou wert once.
And as thou wert, so shalt thou be again to me, if
I find thee worthy. If not, if thou hast done me

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

this wrong, woe to thy head! If thou art guilty,
thou art deeply so; and for every step thou hast
taken in treachery and deceit, a deadly wound shall
be inflicted upon thy house. Thyself, thy father,
thy brothers, shall all suffer; even <i>she</i>&mdash;thy wife,
and, as I thought her once, my daughter&mdash;shall feel
the weight of my vengeance. And, I charge thee,
Giafar, if indeed thou hast not disobeyed me, keep
that commandment well."</p>

<p>"Ah! my lord, recall it," interrupted the prince,
prostrating himself before the feet of the calif. "It
is the origin of all our sorrows. Thy bosom is now
estranged from thy children, and all our happiest
moments are poisoned by distrust and fear. The
beauty and virtues of the princess, thy daughter,
have not failed to enchant and enslave me. Wilt
thou not recall that dire restriction!&mdash;wilt thou not
give her to me again, and make me thy son indeed?"
These words were uttered by the prince in an
earnest and impassioned manner, and for the purpose 
rather of effectually quieting the suspicions
of the calif, than through any hope that his prayer
would be favourably received. He was not disappointed 
when he heard his master's reply.</p>

<p>"Thou askest in vain, Giafar. My purpose is
unchangeable. See to it that thou swervest not
from my commands."</p>

<p>"Thy wishes shall be law unto thy servant,
though a life of care and disappointment be mine,"
answered the prince, in a tone of resignation.</p>

<p>"Ere night comes," said Haroun, "send hither

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

that female slave. I would myself question her
concerning her guilt; and come with her thyself,
Giafar, I would have thee present at the interview.
When thou returnest to thy house, change thy garments&mdash;cleanse 
thyself from all impurities, and
prostrate in the dust, return thanks to the Most
High, who has this day preserved thee from death.
I myself owe these devotions to Heaven, and as
much in alms as would feed the poor of the city
for the space of seven days, for I have wellnigh
done that which, if thou hast spoken truth, I had
given my right hand to recall." Then bending
himself in the posture of prayer, this superstitious
and arbitrary, yet generous monarch, repeated the
namaz of midday, adding, ere he arose, this prayer:
"Oh sovereign Arbiter of celestial mercy and
celestial vengeance! oh supreme Ruler of the
hearts and minds of mortals! save us from the
torments of the tomb<sup><a id="r015" href="#n015">15</a></sup> and from eternal fire!
There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his
prophet."</p>

<p>The prince had stooped by the side of his master, 
but rose not when their devotions were ended.
His feelings had overpowered him. The energy
which till now had supported him, seemed to have
vanished with the danger. Mind and body were
equally unnerved, and he remained for some moments 
with his forehead to the ground, like one in
a dream. He was recalled to himself by the sound
of the calif's voice.</p>

<p>"Arise, Giafar! let not the thoughts of the danger

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

which thou hast escaped unman thee. If thou
art guiltless, thy life is safe. Go, now, in peace."</p>

<p>"Am I deceived?" said Haroun, when Giafar
had left his presence: "I know his art&mdash;<i>skill</i>, I
have often called it. There breathes not a man in
Persia who could deceive me, save himself. Yet
what matters it? the return of the hakim will resolve 
all my doubts. Vengeance will be sure,
though for a time delayed. Should he prove false,
though a spirit from heaven should plead for him,
it were in vain. But I well hope it is not so. 'Twill
be a dark day, even for me, that day that dawns
upon mine anger."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Approach&mdash;'tis kindly done,
My learned physician and a friend.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Sir Eustace de Grey</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean time, Gabriel, the physician, was
proceeding, with slow and unwilling steps, towards
the abode of Prince Giafar. When he arrived at
the outer entrance of the palace, at the accustomed
signal a slave admitted him, to whom he showed
the signet ring of the prince, and requested to be
conducted to the presence of the princess. The
slave looked upon it, pressed it to his forehead as
a mark of recognition and reverence, and then

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

beckoning the physician to follow him, led the way
across a spacious court, up a flight of steps, and
having traversed a long gallery, at last stopped before 
a closed door. He was about to knock for
admission, but the physician restrained him. Some
one within was reading. Gabriel hesitated to interrupt 
the study, or more probably, the devotion,
of the person thus engaged; and he listened for a
moment, and heard a female voice pronouncing the
following verses from the Koran: "By the brightness 
of the morning, and by the night when it groweth 
dark, thy Lord doth not forsake thee, neither
doth he hate thee. Truly, thy life to come shall be
better than this present life; and Allah shall give
thee a reward, with which thou shalt be well
pleased. Did he not find thee an orphan, and hath
be not taken care of thee? Did he not find thee in
error, and hath he not guided thee into the truth?
Did he not find thee poor, and hath he not enriched
thee? Therefore oppress not the orphan, neither repulse 
the poor, but declare the goodness of the Lord."
When the voice had ceased reading this beautiful
and impressive chapter, Gabriel, having been announced, 
entered. The princess was seated near
a window, veiled; and a female attendant, who had
been reading at her feet, rose, and, at a sign from
Abassa, left the chamber. The embarrassment of
the hakim was evident as he approached the lady.
He drew near, however, respectfully, and having
made a grave obeisance, thus addressed her;
"Most noble princess, health and peace be with

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

thee! I am sent hither by thy father, the illustrious 
Commander of the Faithful. Shadows, he has
heard, darken the fair mirror of thy health, I have
come to inquire news thereof."</p>

<p>"Sit, learned hakim," said Abassa. "The presence 
of the physician is ever welcome in the chamber 
of the sick."</p>

<p>"Thrice happy is thy servant to bring his skill
to thine aid; and he will ever prize it the more
highly, if it can serve in aught to comfort and relieve 
the daughter of my most noble master, and
one so worthy."</p>

<p>"It will be well bestowed," said the princess,
"if it can call back the flush of health to my cheek,
and give to this fainting frame that strength and
elasticity which were once its own."</p>

<p>"And yet, if I judge aright," said the hakim,
"the colour of the rose is upon thy cheek, although
the veil which thou wearest in part conceals thy
features."</p>

<p>" 'Tis often thus," said Abassa, and faintly smiling, 
she threw aside her veil, and left her fair face
entirely exposed to the view of the hakim. "The
colour comes at times upon my cheek, but like a
restless truant leaves it soon."</p>

<p>"Thou art right, thou art right; thy face is now
like marble," said the old man. "In truth a wondrous 
change. Thine eyes are languid and sunken,
thy face is pale and emaciated, and has lost, I think,
somewhat of its bright complexion. Now that I
note intently, it bears those marks which I have

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

seen oft inflicted by care and sorrow. These are
the lot of many poor, many unfortunate, who want
those things whereof thou possessest abundance&mdash;whose 
very bread is the wages of toil and beggary.
But how can such guests find entrance at the gates
of this palace?"</p>

<p>"Does sleep always alight upon the softest pillow?" 
said the princess; "or content dwell unceasingly 
in richly curtained chambers?"</p>

<p>"Not so, in truth, not so," replied the hakim;
"yet there are many enjoyments which wealth
and rank may obtain for their possessors, a small
share of which would gladden the hearts of the
poor."</p>

<p>"Yet how many wants are there, which wealth
cannot supply; and when these are felt, its gilding
may conceal but cannot alleviate our sorrow. A
draught of absinth, methinks, would seem more bitter, 
when drained from a rich goblet, than from the
earthen vessel of the poor. Yes, happy are they who
dwell in the valley of obscurity. Clouds and storms
gather about the high places of fortune, and the
descent from thence is fearful. What says the
poet: 'There are stars without number in the
firmament, but the sun and the moon alone are
eclipsed.' "</p>

<p>"I cannot gainsay what thou hast said," replied
the physician, moved by the melancholy tone in
which she had spoken. "Wealth and enjoyment
ill teach us how to bear the coming of misfortune,
and care lays its heaviest hand upon that bosom,

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

which before has never felt its touch. Far may it
keep from thee, most noble lady!"</p>

<p>"With thy permission, learned hakim?" said the
princess, offering to cover her face with her veil.
He bowed assent, and then placing his long white
fingers upon the arm which the princess at his request 
held out to him, he proceeded to count the
pulses as they hurried through her feverish frame.
This process was conducted with wonderful gravity 
and deliberation. The wise man's head was
thrown to one side, his brows were knit, and his
eyes, scarcely visible between their nearly closed
lids, were peering steadily into vacancy. The
corners of his mouth were drawn down to their
utmost extent, the under lip advancing far before
the upper, while in the many wrinkling lines thus
formed upon his visage, seemed to dwell a superhuman 
sagacity. The unoccupied hand was at
intervals passed over his countenance, as though to
settle its features more securely into their unnatural, 
though sapient expression. Occasionally he
would bend his ear close to the pulse which he
was counting, as though by that organ he expected
to gain some important and necessary information.
But while the mind of the worthy hakim seemed
thus occupied about his exterior, it was in truth
differently and actively employed. With his accustomed 
care, he had given himself time to ascertain 
what share of that irregularity which the pulse
of his fair patient manifested, should be attributed
to his own presence and purpose, and what might

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

duly be considered as owing to the disturbed condition 
of her bodily health. At last he seemed satisfied. 
"Quick, quick&mdash;how unlike mine own!"
he muttered, placing his fingers upon his own
wrist; "yet, by the beard of Hippocrates! my
pulse surely beats not as it is wont! What is it that
drives the blood through my veins at so strange a
rate?"</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, however, to describe this whole
scene. It will be sufficient to say that it was conducted 
with all that solemn gravity, that pretension 
to mysterious and wonderful wisdom, which
may truly be called oriental, an appellation not inapplicable 
to some professors of the art at this present 
day. "Dost thou watch under the night air,
or sleep beneath the rays of the baleful moon?"
said the physician, after a silence of some moments.</p>

<p>"When at my husband's villa upon the Tigris,
I often watched the stars and studied the wonders
of the heavens. It was my delight to do this, and
often midnight found me lingering thus employed.
It has not been so of late." A sigh came from her
bosom as she spoke of those hours. All was summer 
then. But now the winds of winter were
howling around that sweet kiosk, and the storms
of fortune, more pitiless, were sweeping across her
own once happy heart.</p>

<p>"The luxurious life and sumptuous fare of the
present race," proceeded the hakim, "weaken the
frame, and are disease's most fruitful source. The

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

time has been when a few dates, and a portion of
barley bread, have composed the meals even of the
Commander of the Faithful&mdash;"but now, how different 
is it!"</p>

<p>"My meals are ever frugal," said Abassa; "indeed, 
my peevish appetite rejects even our most
common viands."</p>

<p>"May it not be that the unwholesome air of this
crowded city affects thee?"</p>

<p>"I have thought often of that," she replied; "at
least, I am sure I should be happier away from
Bagdad."</p>

<p>"Sayst thou so!" was the reply. "Travel and
change, then, would restore thee. I will speak of
this to thy father." During a short silence which
followed, Gabriel walked twice or thrice across the
chamber, with irresolution pictured most strongly
in his countenance; at last, however, he seated
himself upon the carpet, close to the princess, and
spoke, hesitatingly, as follows: "I will not trifle
longer with thee, lady. Upon an unpleasing duty
have I come, and it is meet that thou shouldst know
its purport. I know that which I would give half
my wealth and skill to unlearn; but I know all
which thou wouldst wish concealed."</p>

<p>Abassa's head drooped, and after a short pause,
she replied, "The treasures of knowledge are
thine, learned hakim. I have little art to oppose to
thy skill. If thine errand is accomplished, go in
peace."</p>

<p>Gabriel was moved by the mildness of her reply. 

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

A tear glittered in his eye, and he answered,
"I cannot depart, and leave thee sorrowing thus.
I stand like a reed shaken by the blast; I would
serve thee&mdash;I would remove, if it were possible,
thy misfortunes; but duty, safety&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hesitate not, good hakim. Let not the griefs
of one who has no claim upon thy compassion affect 
thee. Thou mayst bring destruction down
upon thine own head, but canst not lighten, by the
smallest atom, the weight of sorrow that is to fall
upon me."</p>

<p>"I could&mdash;by this hand, I could! Doubt it not!
my means are less limited than thou thinkest.
Thou mayst yet live. Follow the counsel which I
will give thee, and thou mayst still escape this danger."</p>

<p>"Escape!" exclaimed the princess&mdash;"can it be?
Are safety and happiness yet in store for us here
below? But deceive me not," she added, distrustfully. 
"Trifle not with one whose life depends
upon thy words."</p>

<p>"Thou art fair, lady," said the kindhearted
man, weeping; "thou art beautiful as the day; and
the graces of thy mind surpass even those of thy
body. I cannot see thee perish. I know the duty
I owe to thy father, yet I am a Christian, and my
creed teaches me to assist the unfortunate. I cannot 
see the light of the world extinguished, the Rose
of Persia torn and scattered in the dust, when a
word from me&mdash;yes, but a word, would revive and
rescue it."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

<p>"Thou hast sojourned long enough in my father's
court to learn its flatteries," said Abassa. "Sweet
words are like the rich confection, which the physician 
uses to disguise some nauseous drug. This
is needless&mdash;I am not a child, and so thy remedy is
salutary, I can take it, be it bitter as it may."</p>

<p>"It is both salutary and sure," replied the old
man; "and thou shalt know it, though thy father's
scimitar be suspended over my neck. Listen to
me!"</p>

<p>The princess listened.</p>

<p>"Medicines of rare and wondrous efficacy are
in my hands. Take of them, as I shall direct thee,
and all which thou wouldst wish concealed may
for ever remain so." Abassa seemed not to comprehend 
the purport of the physician's words. She
cast an anxious, inquiring look upon the hakim's
countenance, who repeated them more clearly, and
added, "Fear them not; a child might take of
them, and be unharmed."</p>

<p>The princess was much agitated, and it was
some time before she could compose herself sufficiently 
to reply. When she did so, her speech
was interrupted by sobs, and her voice was inexpressibly 
sad and sweet. "How dark it is! thou
hast thrown a torch's light upon my path which
thine own breath has extinguished. I have asked
for life, and thou hast given me death. I have
wished for happiness, and thou hast proffered to
me crime. Thy trade has made thee cruel, hakim."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

<p>"I cruel!" exclaimed the old man. "Not so,
by Mohammed! Thou mistakest. I would have
thee live&mdash;I would have thee happy."</p>

<p>"I think not, that with a settled purpose, thou
wouldst wound my soul. It were unjust to think
so. Speak no more of it! Urge me not to that
which would render life a torment, and thought an
utter curse! Draw not one, who has already
much wherewith to reproach herself, still further
from the path of duty."</p>

<p>"And <i>that</i> leads thee to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To death&mdash;I know it," said the princess, finishing 
the sentence which the physician had not the
heart to conclude. "Better to die, than live with
such a weight of guilt upon my bosom. Even now,
expecting the approach of fearful suffering, I am
not destitute of consolation. There are some who
yet love me, and in whose smile I find life, even
when death has taken hold upon my right hand;
and if Allah will look kindly upon me, and forgive
my faults, I think I could die content. Yet, it is
hard to part with <i>him</i>. To give up life were nothing."</p>

<p>"Yet pause one moment, ere thou dost reject
mine aid. There is, in my proffer, evil to no one,
and mercy to all. Thyself, thy husband, and his
whole race&mdash;thy father, every one that is dear to
thee, must suffer, if my counsel is rejected. No
one, not even the unconscious and innocent cause
of all these evils can escape. I would have thee
live, as well for thy father's happiness as for thine

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

own. I would not have his honour tarnished, or
his peace destroyed, by the punishment which his
ungovernable anger will lead him to execute upon
all."</p>

<p>"My poor father!" murmured the princess,
weeping. "Giafar and I will sleep in the tomb
sweetly, but what a gloomy remnant of life will be
his. When the storm of his indignation shall have
passed, and swept us all away, who is there that
can supply that place in his bosom, once occupied
by his friend and daughter? Tell me that, good
hakim. Must he be wretched? will there be none
to support him? Tell me that, and I will answer
thee more firmly."</p>

<p>"There will be none then living that can do so.
Remorse will imbitter, if it does not shorten his
lonely life, and Islamism will lose her firmest protector."</p>

<p>The unhappy princess seemed moved by an agitation 
that threatened to tear her slender frame to
pieces. After enduring this in silence, she fell
forward with her face upon her lap. Gabriel
thought she had swooned, and raising her, threw
aside her veil. She was deadly pale, but consciousness 
had not forsaken her. The kind-hearted
hakim now threw himself with his face at her feet,
and poured out all the ardour of his soul, in one
earnest and impassioned entreaty that she would
listen to his counsel. The lady trembled, gasped
for breath, and for a moment her resolution seemed
to waver, and the old man expected exultingly

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

her assent. But her countenance became gradually 
firmer, her eye increased in brightness, until
it shone with lustre almost supernatural, and she
replied, in tones strangely thrilling,</p>

<p>"Thou canst not tempt me. If my happiness
here were alone concerned, I would follow the
counsel thou givest me, and for the sake of others
be wretched. But my thoughts are above this
world. This life is to me a point; but there is a
vast region of existence before me, and I would
not separate myself for ever from all that I love.
My support under the evils which I am now suffering, 
and those which are yet to be my lot, is the
thought of that paradise where we may all meet.
Stay me not, then! Oblivion will there hide the
sorrows of this life, and my father, stripped of his
anger, will become reconciled to his child."</p>

<p>"Thou art right, lady, thou art right," exclaimed
the old man, much affected. "Thou art framed
for heaven, and perchance thou wouldst not be
detained&mdash;thou wouldst not linger from thy home.
This earth is no place for one so beautiful and
pure."</p>

<p>"I think not so," replied Abassa; "this world is
fair. To dwell here with those we love, at peace,
untroubled by the storms of passion that make a
chaos of man's bosom&mdash;this were a foretaste of
heaven's joys, nay, paradise itself."</p>

<p>"I speak not," said the sage, "of the pleasures
promised by thy Prophet&mdash;I speak not of gardens
of perpetual delight watered by spicy rivers, of

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

sweetest sounds, of fruits, of fairest forms, which
make up the paradise of the Moslem&mdash;but of that
pure heaven which the faith that I profess offers to
the sincere followers of its tenets. There, no care
nor passion can enter the soul; they are shut out
for ever from that blessed abode. There, is no father
and no son&mdash;no husband and no wife&mdash;all earthly
ties are forgotten; the passions that agitate this
clay are all exchanged for love, infinite and universal&mdash;love 
untainted with the weakness of mortality, 
and unalloyed by its frailty and fear."</p>

<p>The princess shook her head, a sad smile touched
her features, and she replied,</p>

<p>"Tell me not of it, hakim. Thy heaven I cannot 
understand. I can feel benevolence for all,
but not that love, that sweet relationship which
binds me to some few on earth. If there is aught
within this soul which tells me that it is eternal, it
whispers that its best emotions, above all, its love,
shall equally endure. Existence would be wearisome, 
methinks, even though clothed in immortality, 
were it divested of that affection which has
rendered it so happy here."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt convert me to thy creed, should I
talk longer with thee," said the hakim. "Yet must
thou perish? While looking on thee, methinks I
would with mine own life redeem thine from destruction. 
Can it not be? Stay! lend me thy
hand once more."</p>

<p>The hakim then placing his fingers upon the
pulse of the princess, repeated the process which

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

has been before described, and with equal care and
deliberation. To judge from the hesitation and
doubt which were expressed in his features, the
results to which the sage now arrived seemed by
no means so conclusive as before, and when he
spake his words confirmed this conjecture. They
were slowly uttered, and interrupted occasionally
by mysterious ejaculations, which, to the ears of
the uninitiated, might have given great weight to
his words.</p>

<p>"The blood courses speedily through these
veins&mdash;thy face is pale and emaciated&mdash;thy frame
languid and appetite impaired. What may all
these import? Without doubt, many things. The
changes of the air, the influence of the moon, and
study, if protracted and wearisome, would all
affect thee thus. I may have erred. I have, at
least, evinced my folly and presumption, in thus
hastily declaring what I have said of thee. I
know nothing. I am a child in mine art. I know
nothing, and can say nothing which may disturb
thy peace."</p>

<p>"Think well of it, good Gabriel," said the princess. 
"Pause, ere thou incurrest that very danger
from which thou wouldst in vain attempt to extricate 
another. Thou knowest my father's temper.
He will ill brook disobedience from thee, or trifling
in this matter. Thou mayst destroy thyself, but
my fate is inevitable; thou canst not avert it."</p>

<p>"Now, God forbid!" ejaculated the old man, fear
and compassion blending together in his countenance, 

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

and giving it an expression of complete irresolution. 
"I have told the calif how hard a duty
he hath assigned me: I have told him that I was
unequal to the task; yet he hath driven me to it.
Am I a beast of burden, that I should be forced
thus to my labour? Should Wisdom be compelled? 
Is not the mind free? I will not think,
then, otherwise than it may suit my purpose. I
think thee innocent, and I will so avow unto thy
father."</p>

<p>"This will not profit us, good hakim," said the
princess. "Thy kindness may avert destruction
for a time; but will not my father's anger visit us
with a heavier doom at last? Thou art perilling
thine own safety thus to act."</p>

<p>"Each day is as a year to thee," replied the physician. 
"Let thy father's jealousy be once allayed,
and all may yet be well. By my counsel thou shalt
retire from Bagdad, to thy husband's villa, or elsewhere, 
for the unwholesome air of the city suits
thee not. There thine ills may be all removed.
There the colour will come again to thy cheek, and
health will revisit thy weakened frame. As for
mine own safety, if I heed it not, fairest princess,
why shouldst thou? Besides, shall I not tell the
calif all I know of thee? I shall tell him that the
brightness of his fair daughter's eye is dimmed,
that her face is pale, and that the current of life
runs feverishly; and what more? nothing&mdash;nothing 
but these. If, in the pride of my art, and
through presumptuous folly, I hastily judged beyond 

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

this, it must pass for arrogance and error.
Methought I had been wiser. My years are
many, and I should have learned, ere this, how deceitful, 
at times, are all the resources of an art,
which yet, understand me, lady, yet merits the appellation 
of divine. Thou knowest my purpose.
Thy servant knoweth nothing, and can say nothing 
that may prejudice thy safety. Yet soft!"
he added, lowering his voice, and looking carefully
around the apartment. "I have a strange tale to
tell, which may concern thy husband nearly."</p>

<p>"Say on, good Gabriel," exclaimed Abassa,
alarmed at the ominous expression of the hakim's
countenance.</p>

<p>"Let no word of this escape thy lips, save to
the prince, thy husband; for my life were of short
space should the Commander of the Faithful know
that I have spoken of this thing. Ere the summer
had passed away, one evening, while seated in my
house, I was aroused by the entrance of two slaves
bearing a leathern sack. Having deposited their
burden upon the floor, they retired ere I had time
to question them. After their departure, I undid
the sack, and to my surprise and horror, found
within the head and trunk of a slave, apparently
just executed. I had not recovered from the astonishment 
into which I had been thrown by this
occurrence, when the calif stood before me. He
was evidently much disturbed by anger, and abruptly 
commanded me to sew the head carefully
upon the body of the deceased, and to embalm the

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

corpse, so that it might, if necessary, be preserved
for many months. It was in vain to expostulate,
and I proceeded to the duty assigned me. While
thus employed, I noted carefully the countenance
of the victim; and though the violent and sudden
death which he had suffered had much distorted
his features, yet I recognised in them a favourite
slave of thy husband. After the performance of
my duty, the calif, having enjoined silence upon
me, departed, and the two slaves again entered,
and bore away their horrid burden."</p>

<p>" 'Tis strange! what may this mean?" said
Abassa.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," replied the hakim. "I ventured
not to question the Commander of the Faithful, for
his countenance was dark with anger. Since then,
I have heard no more of this mysterious transaction. 
Inform the prince of what I have told thee.
He may divine the purpose of the calif, and prepare 
himself against the danger. But breathe no
word of this to mortal, save himself."</p>

<p>"Fear me not, hakim," said the princess&mdash;"fear
me not! I tremble&mdash;strange horrors surround us.
Yet let fortune deal with us as it will, thy kindness
can never be forgotten."</p>

<p>"May it effectually serve thee," answered the
physician. "Be not, however, too sanguine in
thy hope. The calif is stern and subtle. His eyes
will search this bosom even to the piercing of its
inmost recesses. I will endure his questioning
with what firmness I may; and wrapped in the

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

dark mantle of my mysterious art, it will go hard
if I do not evade his scrutiny. Farewell!&mdash;peace
be with thee! Remain assured my promise shall
not fail."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that it will not," said Abassa.
"Thou hast dealt compassionately with me, and
though thy counsel has been in part unthinking,
and somewhat harsh, yet it was kindly meant, and
I thank thee."</p>

<p>"Doubt it not&mdash;doubt it not!" replied the hakim. 
"Heaven's blessing be upon thee."</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, after the customary salutation, 
the kind-hearted Gabriel withdrew.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Richard II</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a trembling and weary spirit Giafar returned 
from the calif's palace to his own home.
His fortitude and self-possession had well availed
him in his interview with the Commander of the
Faithful, but they had been severely tested. The
terrific trial had depressed his courage, and had
exhausted his powers of endurance. Mind and
body were equally harassed, and it was in a condition 

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

every way unfit for such a crisis, that he
found himself in the presence of the princess, to
learn from her lips the result of an interview upon
which depended life, happiness, everything. He
had entered the chamber unheard, and stood for
some moments by her side ere she perceived him.
Her face was buried in her robe, but the sobs
which were breaking in frequent succession from
her bosom, confirmed his worst fears. "All is
known!" exclaimed Abassa, as soon as she was
aware of his presence; and throwing herself upon
his bosom, she fastened her arms about his neck,
weeping bitterly, and through a strange weakness,
tears were dropping down the cheeks of the proud
Moslem.</p>

<p>After a few moments the princess subdued her
emotion, and at Giafar's request related the particulars 
of her interview with Gabriel the physician. 
To this account he listened with earnestness. 
Life hung upon her lips. He trembled as
he heard&mdash;'twas as he had feared, and now there
was no hope. His interest deepened, however, as
she proceeded, until she spoke of that counsel
which the hakim had given her, and of his assurance 
of their safety if it were followed; when he
seemed to drink in the words as they fell from her
lips. A shade of disappointment passed across his
brow, as she recounted her refusal of the old man's
advice&mdash;yet it was momentary&mdash;by an instantaneous, 
though visible effort, he banished it from
his countenance. A smile of triumph played about

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

his mouth&mdash;his eye kindled as she related the
strange tale respecting the dead Hassan&mdash;that
snare, at least, had been shunned. But this feeling 
of exultation vanished quickly, and when she
had concluded, he exclaimed, in accents of despair,
"It is so, then!&mdash;nothing can save us now&mdash;there
is no hope!"</p>

<p>"How sayst thou, dearest Giafar?" answered
the princess. "Is there none? The promise of
the hakim&mdash;his pledge of secrecy and concealment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put no trust in it," he replied. "His courage
is not equal to his kindness, and the calif would
tear the secret from his bosom, were it locked by
thrice his cunning."</p>

<p>"Thou art strangely moved," said Abassa.
"Thy brow is damp, and thy cheek pale. The
emotions that disturb thy mind so fearfully, preclude, 
perhaps, the cool and even exercise of thy
judgment. Let it not be thus, my lord. Recall
thy fortitude&mdash;bring back thy firmness and thy
hope, which seem so suddenly to have deserted
thee."</p>

<p>" 'Tis as thou sayst, Abassa," returned the
prince: "hope and courage have departed from
me. Yet wonder not&mdash;I have endured that to-day 
which must have crushed them, had all my
nerves been steel. My judgment likewise may
have suffered in the conflict; yet little art is necessary 
to know that the purpose of the hakim will
not avail us in our present peril. Buried in his

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

books, and unused to the rude contact of a jarring
world, even if he has the craft, he wants the fortitude 
which might bear him through the trial.
There was a way&mdash;but it matters not&mdash;thou hast
rejected it."</p>

<p>Abassa seemed not to notice the concluding
words of the prince's reply, but answered, "Thou
canst not tell, Giafar. If the spirit of a brave and
skilful man is at times shaken and borne to earth,
so, thou well knowest, is the courage of the peaceful 
hakim&mdash;ay, of a very woman, often exalted to
a level even with that of the bravest. For the
truth of Gabriel, I would answer with my life, and
for his firmness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou needst not speak of it," interrupted the
prince. "Cast a bulrush into the swift Tigris, and
if that feeble obstacle can arrest the current of the
stream, then will the firmness of Gabriel Bact Jeschoua 
effectually oppose thy father's anger. I tell
thee, my dearest life, within this hour I have stood
in the calif's presence, armed with all the constancy 
that I could assume&mdash;and thou well knowest 
there are few that can compete with me in this.
I have spoken falsehood with a face unmoved and
innocent. Yet all has been wellnigh in vain. Confession 
has been upon my lips, and the thoughts
of thy safety have alone repressed its utterance.
Had mine own worthless life been all that was at
stake, I should have yielded it. Twice has thy
father's scimitar been lifted over my head, and as
often has his hand been disarmed by my unvarying 

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

composure. Thinkest thou that the mild Gabriel&mdash;the 
peaceful and unskilled hakim, can endure 
such scrutiny?"</p>

<p>"I fear it is as thou sayst," replied the princess,
trembling, as she saw those hopes removed which,
but a moment since, had filled her bosom with encouragement. 
"What, then, is left us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but despair," was the reply; and they
were then silent for a moment, the princess weeping 
in his arms, and Giafar shaken by agitation that
he had not the power to control. At last he spoke,
looking upon her in deep anguish, and in a voice
that emotion rendered weak and faltering. "My
best beloved Abassa, from me have come thy sorrows. 
By my rashness art thou plunged into this
misery. Why art thou so meek? Upbraid me&mdash;reproach 
me as the author of thy ruin, and I will
bear it better. Yet, dearest, I swear by our misfortunes, 
that I have erred through love alone.
Pride and ambition have had no part in this our
fate; and were it not for thy sufferings, and the
destruction of those as innocent as thyself, I would
not murmur&mdash;perhaps I should not regret. But I
cannot think, without self-reproach and horror,
upon the fate of all that is most dear to me. Thou
wouldst shudder hadst thou heard, as I did, the
cruel threat which fell from thy father's lips to-day. 
My life&mdash;the lives of all my race, must be
sacrificed. Even thou, mine own beloved! thy
youth, thy loveliness and worth will not save thee&mdash;solitary 
imprisonment&mdash;perhaps death itself!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

<p>"Oh! he will surely give me death," interrupted
Abassa; "I could not bear separation from thee.
There will be no eye then to smile upon me&mdash;no
voice to encourage&mdash;no bosom to shelter and protect 
me. This would be worse than death."</p>

<p>"Rend not my soul by the recital of thy griefs.
This is the sharpest shaft fate has within her quiver. 
Oh! if I alone might suffer&mdash;Allah hear me!"&mdash;and 
the unhappy Giafar prostrated himself in the
attitude of prayer&mdash;"upon my head be all the punishment&mdash;all 
the destruction&mdash;but spare, oh spare
the innocent!"</p>

<p>Abassa had bowed herself at his side, and was
offering up a silent prayer that she might share the
fate of her lord, that death itself might not separate
them. "Yet, after all, we should not despair," exclaimed 
the prince, rising from his posture of supplication. 
"Let us not desert ourselves. The
counsel of the learned Gabriel affords as yet a hope.
Saidst thou not that he could save us from destruction? 
Tell me once more?&mdash;there may be yet
time."</p>

<p>The princess looked upon him tremblingly, and
answered, "I have told thee all, my best beloved!
I have told thee all&mdash;there is no hope but in Heaven; 
for thou knowest, Giafar," she continued,
fearing and anticipating his reply, "that though I
would give my life for thine, yet I cannot do that
which would separate us for ever. By such a
crime, I should be unworthy of thee, and should
look for abhorrence from thee instead of love. If

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

wretchedness, if death itself, must come to me, let
them at least find me innocent."</p>

<p>"Yet thou shouldst look, ere thou castest away
our last, our only chance for safety. Owe we not
something to others, who have not participated in
our disobedience, but must share our punishment?
Be not hasty, but think well of thy life and mine
own&mdash;though 'tis worth naught save for thee: ponder 
on the fate of my father, brothers, nay, our
whole house."</p>

<p>"I have thought of all this," said Abassa, violently 
agitated; "and you know not how my bosom 
has been shaken. But, I have resolved, I
think&mdash;yes, resolved to die&mdash;ay, and&mdash;'tis horrible
to think it!&mdash;to be unmoved even by thy fate, and
the sufferings of those most dear to thee. You
gaze upon me in wonder&mdash;you think me cruel&mdash;mad, 
but I am not. No&mdash;am I so in wishing to
spend eternity with thee? I would bear long and
patiently, the sharpest stings of misfortune, to avert
this blow, while there remained to me a surety
that all would pass away, and that with thee, at
last, I should be happy; but ask me not to err
thus; knowing, as thou dost, that such sin must
part us for ever."</p>

<p>"Nay, but hear me! Listen to me a moment."</p>

<p>"I will not listen to thee. Speak not of it.
Urge me not," she exclaimed, in an agony of fear.
"If thou forsakest me, whither shall I turn? If I
have loved thee too well&mdash;if I have transgressed
the commands of my father (may Allah bless him),

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

still these faults Heaven may pardon, since I have
repented, and am punished here. But, assist me,
Giafar! let not the thoughts of life, of all that is dear,
shake my purpose. Let me not lose thee for ever;
comfort me with thine assurances&mdash;say Heaven
has yet in store some happiness for the unfortunate,
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, brightest star, we shall meet in paradise!"
exclaimed the prince, raised above this world,
above all thoughts of friends, of life, or death, by
the sweet, yet unbending fortitude of his patient
wife.</p>

<p>Abassa's weak frame could not support her
longer in this trying scene. She had swooned under 
the violence of her emotions, but ere consciousness 
deserted her, these words had fallen upon her
ear. She was sensible of the kiss which Giafar's
lips had imprinted upon her forehead, and a sweet
smile was visible upon her senseless features. The
prince bore her to a couch in an adjoining apartment, 
and having seen signs of returning animation, 
left her to the care of her attendants.</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;no! I cannot urge her to it," he
exclaimed, when he had returned to the chamber
where their interview had been held. "Shame on my
want of manhood. If she can meet death with such
calmness, cannot I? Oh! if my death were all,
I would welcome it. But she, whom I love better
than life&mdash;my aged father&mdash;my noble brothers&mdash;all
to suffer; 'tis too horrible! my soul sickens at it;
ruin, utter ruin, and brought upon them by me, on

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

whom they look with pride and affection; whom
they esteem as the prop and support of our noble
house! I shall drag them with me in my fall. Ah!
I have been to blame. I should have remembered
that the lives of others were in my keeping, and
not have thrown them thus away. To fly&mdash;to resist&mdash;to 
crawl to the feet of the calif, and implore
his mercy! mercy for all but me! Oh! that
with this aching head I could purchase safety for
them all. I once hoped to die under the shadow
of swords, amid the pushing with lances, and the
ringing of steel-headed arrows, with the standard
of the crescent waving its folds above me. Now,
I must beg to fall ignominiously, if I may fall alone.
I shall never more quench my flaming sword in the
blood of the infidel. My steed will never bear me
again over the rich harvest of this right hand&mdash;'changing 
his amber hoofs to the red cornelian,' in
the dripping blood of foes. Farewell, renown! it
has been the breath of my nostrils, and I thought
to be embalmed in its good odour. But I must die
a traitor's death, and with a traitor's name. Allah, 
in his mercy, aid me! I am indeed lost!"</p>

<p>The countenance and mien of the unhappy prince
gave unerring testimony to the crowd of wild
thoughts and despairing fears which were thronging 
into his mind. Now, the rushing blood dyed
his features with crimson, and his eyes shot forth
fierce and unnatural fire; then, in an instant, as
though by some secret mechanism, his face became
blanched, and like marble. Yet, in the midst of all

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

his wretchedness, when Giafar thought for whom
and for what he was suffering, a shade of composure 
came upon him. When he reflected&mdash;if that
might be called reflection which passed through a
mind so suffering and so convulsed&mdash;that the joys
of moments past were far above the horrors of the
present, and that he could not suffer to the degree
in which he had been blessed, something like triumph 
was visible in his features, as lifting up his
head, and straightening his limbs, he paced, with a
firm step, the apartment. And in this mood, it
may be, that he would have remained, had his fate
alone occupied his thoughts. But accumulated
terrors, with a mountain's weight, bow his soul to
earth. He cannot reflect, he cannot act, he can
do nothing but despair. His courage is gone
from him&mdash;his ready skill and daring fail him when
he has most need. The lion's heart and arm are
covered with the coat of the timorous deer. Will
he not turn at bay ere the hounds fasten on him?</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">It was a fearful light to see
Such high resolve and constancy,
In one so young and fair.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Marmion</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weary hours of that gloomy day passed
heavily to the young prince. They lingered by
him in their flight, as if, fearing that his moments
were drawing to a close, they would fain prolong
his wretchedness, and keep him from the sweet
sleep which awaited him, when time and its troubles 
should have ceased to agitate his aching heart.
If, for a few moments, he was enabled to call off
his thoughts from trials which were past, it was
only to fix them upon others more severe which
were yet in store for him. He gathered no confidence 
from the assurances of the hakim; he would
not dream of hope; but in that stern insensibility
with which a Moslem so often resigns himself to
the decrees of fate, he awaited the doom which
seemed inevitable. Gloomily and in silence he
thus remained until evening began to draw near,
looking upon every present moment as perhaps
his last. But the fading light, which reminded
him of the passage of the hours, revived, in some

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

degree, his hopes. He had expected ere this to
be visited with his master's vengeance. It warned
him, also, that the time appointed by the calif for
the questioning of the slave Khatoun had wellnigh
passed. His heart drooped when he thought of
the trial which awaited that sweet girl. But shall
he hesitate now? No&mdash;his all, and more than all
was at stake; and though the chances were fearfully 
against him, he resolved to play, with a careful 
and even hand, the game upon which this rich
venture depended. Bracing his courage, he proceeded, 
though with a heavy heart, to prepare the
young slave for her interview with the stern and
suspicious calif, and escort her to the palace.</p>

<p>He found her in the same solitary apartment
which she had so long occupied, and from which
she had not wished to be removed until after her
interview with the calif, when she should have
redeemed her fault, as she expressed it, and deserved 
the favour of her who was to be her future
mistress. Her feebleness seemed to have increased
rather than diminished. Her eyes were glassy
and dilated, and their dark brightness contrasted
strongly with the extreme pallor of her skin, giving
to her countenance an expression wild and almost
unearthly in its character. Her face seemed more
emaciated than it was when he saw her the evening 
before, and her pale lips were compressed
firmly together. Her breath was drawn quietly,
and at times a deep inspiration or sob interrupted
its regularity. She seemed as though she had

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

been severely racked by a storm of vehement and
convulsing emotions, from which she had come
out, marked, indeed, by their power, but preserving
her firmness, and the resolution which had been so
assailed.</p>

<p>"The trial is awaiting thee, Khatoun," said the
prince, approaching her. "Art thou prepared?"</p>

<p>"I am, my lord," she replied, without turning
her eyes upon him. They were fixed vacantly
in air.</p>

<p>"Look upon me, Khatoun. Thou hast much
changed since I last saw thee. Why is this?
Dost thou repent thy purpose?"</p>

<p>She bent her look towards him, and gazing in
his face with a gleaming wildness, she replied,</p>

<p>"Oh! I have had a fearful conflict. The passage 
to the tomb were light to its terrors. But I
repent not. No! I am resolved. Do you not
think," she continued, glaring upon him with a
countenance in which a frightful sternness was
as strongly depicted as such an expression could
be in features so soft and feminine&mdash;"do you not
think I am resolved?"</p>

<p>"Speak not so strangely," said the prince, supporting 
her frail form against his bosom. "My
soul is pierced with thy grief. I cannot bear to
see thee thus."</p>

<p>"There, then!" she exclaimed; the rigidity
which dwelt upon her features melting into a flood
of tears. "But it has unnerved me. I was firm.
but now&mdash;ready to tell that tale&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

<p>"Recall thy fortitude," said Giafar, interrupting
her; "but not with it that strange gloom which
but a moment since sat upon thy face. The calif
even now awaits thy coming. Mind it not; the
trial will not equal thy fears, or, at the worst, it
will soon be past. Thou wilt this night rest
sweetly after thy generous task, the sweeter for
the recollection of thy fidelity and kindness."</p>

<p>"<i>Shall I sleep thus, my lord?&mdash;and to-night?</i>
I had a thought like this. My griefs will all be
ended then, <i>to-night</i>, thou sayst?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless they will, Khatoun. This trial over,
and it shall be my care that no sorrow nor misfortune 
shall approach thee. In the fairest balls of
my palace, and in the presence of my grateful wife,
thy life shall pass calmly away, untroubled, undisturbed&mdash;unless 
it be"&mdash;he added, and he trembled
as he spoke&mdash;"by the blow which shall fall with a
heavier weight upon me and upon my house.
Thou shalt not fail of a shelter while one of my
name and race lives to protect thee."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," she exclaimed, observing his
emotion. "Come, I am ready. The night is
here&mdash;the hours are passing. Come, we may be
too late."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou be firm?" inquired the prince.</p>

<p>"Do not fear me&mdash;I shall," was the reply.</p>

<p>Giafar, trembling, supported that trembling girl
to her litter. He placed her therein with kind and
sedulous care, and having directed the slaves to
proceed at a slow pace towards the royal palace,

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

he turned his own steps thither also. His courage 
wavered as he entered his master's presence,
but was instantly reassured by the open brow with
which the calif greeted him, and by the expression
of satisfaction that was diffused over his stern
features. He found him in earnest conversation
with Gabriel Bact Jeschoua. Haroun turned for a
moment from his discourse with the physician, to
welcome the prince.</p>

<p>"Thou art come in time," he said. "Is the
slave with thee, Giafar?"</p>

<p>"She waits without, my lord."</p>

<p>"It is well. I doubt not but thou hast spoken
truly, hakim," said the calif, continuing the discourse 
in which he had been engaged when the
prince entered; "thou wouldst not trifle with me,
as I think."</p>

<p>The face of the old man was clothed in imperturbable 
gravity. No emotion, not the slightest
shade of feeling, flitted across his solemn and sagacious 
visage, or disturbed, in the most minute
degree, the formality of his settled features.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me, may it please the Commander 
of the Faithful," he replied, "to deceive
thee in the smallest matter, still less in a case of
such magnitude, such importance. Even if I
would do this, it were perilous, in sooth."</p>

<p>"Thy wisdom does not much mislead thee,
Gabriel," replied the calif, with a grim smile.
"Thy rarest drugs would serve thee little, if,

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

knowing otherwise, thou hast deceived me in this
thing."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid I should do this!" exclaimed
the hakim.</p>

<p>"Enough. I believe it not." The calif now
addressed the prince. "The slave is without, thou
sayst, Giafar? Gabriel, admit her. Knows she
the purpose for which we have commanded her
presence?"</p>

<p>"I have imparted it to her, my lord."</p>

<p>"Thou needst not have done this, Giafar."</p>

<p>At this moment, Gabriel returned, followed by
Khatoun. She was closely veiled, and came forward 
with a trembling and faltering step, supporting 
herself with difficulty, until she reached a low
seat, upon which she sank down, with evident
marks of exhaustion and debility.</p>

<p>"Let the slave remove her veil," said the Commander 
of the Faithful.</p>

<p>Khatoun hesitated a moment, and then endeavoured 
to obey the command of the calif, but was
apparently unable. Her hands trembled, and
after a few vain attempts, they fell helpless at her
side.</p>

<p>"Remove thy veil, Khatoun," said the prince;
"it is the Commander of the Faithful bids thee."</p>

<p>The mild tone in which this was uttered
sounded harshly in the ears of the calif, and he
darted a piercing glance upon Giafar, as though
he would read his inmost soul. Khatoun, however, 
seemed encouraged, for with a struggling

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

effort she complied, and drew aside the veil which
concealed her face with a heavy sigh, as though
she had completed a task which had called forth
all her powers. The sight of her features, so pale,
and so mild in their expression, diverted the calif's
thoughts from a train into which suspicion was
about to lead them, and addressing the prince,</p>

<p>"Is she ill?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"She is, my lord. The imprisonment which
she has suffered has preyed severely upon her
health."</p>

<p>"And remorse, Giafar&mdash;remorse! Or is she so
hardened in her guilt that she has not felt its
sting?"</p>

<p>"It may be remorse, my lord," was the prince's
hesitating reply.</p>

<p>"Cast thine eyes around thee," said the calif,
now turning to Khatoun, "and answer if thou
seest any in this presence to whom thou owest
duty and fidelity?"</p>

<p>"I do, may it please the calif," was the reply,
"Thyself, my lord, the Commander of all the
Faithful, to whom, as a sovereign ruler, and as
the chief imam of our religion, homage and reverence 
are due; also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, proceed," said Haroun, for she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Also, the Prince Giafar, my master, to whom,
as a faithful slave, I owe all honour and affection."</p>

<p>"Thou hast well spoken," said Haroun; "and
if thine actions had in everything comported with

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

what thou hast uttered, thou wouldst not now
stand before me accused of a base and loathsome
crime. When thou didst first become an inmate
of thy master's palace, didst thou not then feel towards 
him those affections which it was thy duty
to cherish? Look upon him! Giafar, look upon
the slave!"</p>

<p>Khatoun gazed upon the prince calmly; but it
was evidently with an effort that Giafar bent his
eyes upon her mild features. There was nothing
upbraiding in their expression; yet self-reproach
and sorrow rendered him for a moment unable to
endure the sad yet firm gaze which she fixed
upon him. The calif noticed this, and exclaimed,
eying the prince with a keen glance, "Dost thou
not hear me, Giafar? Avert not thine eyes, but
look upon her as I command thee."</p>

<p>Recalled to his firmness by these words, the
prince looked upon her with steadfastness.</p>

<p>"Answer me, Khatoun, didst thou not love him
then?"</p>

<p>"I did, my lord," she replied, with a faint smile,
"I did love him <i>once!</i>"</p>

<p>"And at that time the prince bestowed upon
thee his favour and presence, and graced thee indeed 
with all which, as a favourite inmate of his
harem, thou couldst rightfully expect from his affection?"</p>

<p>"In truth, I thought so <i>then</i>, my lord."</p>

<p>"In possession, then, of all that a slave could
wish, the esteem and love of thy master, thou hast

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

descended to the vile crime with which thou art
charged. Light and false of heart, thou hast given
thyself to a slave, and betrayed thus basely thine
own honour, and defiled thy master's."</p>

<p>Khatoun was violently agitated. She trembled
as though the words of the calif had the power of
an ague upon her frame, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Art thou not guilty of this?" resumed the calif,
in a tone of severity. "Hast thou not thus erred?"</p>

<p>She placed her hand upon her bosom, and bowed
her head in silence.</p>

<p>"Nay, speak aloud," exclaimed Haroun, yet
more angrily. "Let me hear thy voice. Thou
mightst well blush to commit such baseness; but
if shame could not deter thee from this crime, it
shall not shield thee from avowing it. Raise thy
head, and own without delay thy guilt, or assert,
if with truth thou canst, thine innocence."</p>

<p>The young girl cast a wild and imploring glance
upon Giafar, and the sight of his agitation recalled
her firmness. He was shaken by various passions,
pity, self-reproach, and fear, and their influence
showed itself in the changing colour of his cheek,
and in the restlessness and tremour which pervaded 
every portion of his frame; tokens, as she
read them, of apprehension and distrust of her
fidelity. Collecting all her energies, and speaking
with all the steadiness which her weak voice could
assume, she replied, "I am guilty of this crime!"</p>

<p>"And with Hassan&mdash;a slave of thy master's
harem?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

<p>"Even so, my lord&mdash;even with that slave," she
answered, in a tone yet firmer.</p>

<p>The transient fortitude which had supported
her vanished when she had thus spoken, and the
flush which had for a moment tinged her cheek,
gave place to a deathlike paleness, and she buried
her face in her trembling hands. Giafar's emotion 
was scarcely less visible than hers.</p>

<p>"Why dost thou tremble thus, Giafar?" said
the calif. "What passion or what fear is it which
thus shakes thy firmness?"</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed ere the prince was
able to reply. "Should I listen unmoved, my lord,
when the story of my dishonour is told in my very
hearing?"</p>

<p>"Thou feelest deeply the wound which this
slave has inflicted upon thine honour?"</p>

<p>"Most deeply, may it please the calif."</p>

<p>"Thou holdest it, then, as no light crime, which
the lapse of time may bury in forgetfulness, but one
which stings most sharply, and can be healed by
naught but punishment and revenge!"</p>

<p>"Even revenge, my most gracious master, cannot 
do this. My hurt lies deep beyond its reach."</p>

<p>"In truth, her crime is black and treacherous,
and thou canst not fail to think thus of it."</p>

<p>The prince bowed his head, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Thou dost not answer me," exclaimed the
calif. "I would know from thine own lips thy
thoughts as to her guilt."</p>

<p>"I esteem it, my lord," replied the prince, speaking 

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

slowly, and strongly exerting himself to appear 
calm&mdash;"I esteem it base!"</p>

<p>"Well, proceed," said the calif, glancing his eye
alternately from the slave to her master.</p>

<p>"Most vile, and most ungrateful!"</p>

<p>"And deserves&mdash; Speak on&mdash;dost thou not
hear me, that thou glarest with such wonder
upon my face? Her punishment&mdash;what should
it be?"</p>

<p>"She has already paid the forfeit of her crime,
my lord."</p>

<p>"Must I again bid thee answer, slave? Thou
hast heard my question. What sentence is meet
for the wretch who is thus guilty?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless, death, my lord!" uttered the prince,
faintly.</p>

<p>Under the searching vigilance of the calif's eye,
Giafar had not ventured to cast a glance upon
Khatoun. Had he done this, he would have seen
that which must have silenced the avowal which
the suspicious anger of the calif was extorting from
his lips. With feelings of indescribable horror,
she had listened to the expressions of reproach
and contumely which her master had lavished
upon her conduct. But when she heard that
dreadful sentence of condemnation coming from
the lips of one that she loved, one who knew how
little it was deserved, her agony was terrible and
overwhelming. Her features, which before were
of an intense paleness, now became tremulous and
quivering; her eyes glared upon him as though

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

they would burst from the sockets, her lips, white
as her cheeks, were half unclosed, through which
her breath was drawn with laborious yet hurried
effort, heaving and depressing her bosom, as with
the throes of death's last convulsion.</p>

<p>The calif turned to her, and exclaimed, unheeding 
her anguish, "Thou hast heard the doom
which thy master has passed upon thee. What
sayst thou? dost thou deserve it?"</p>

<p>She was able to utter, but with extreme difficulty, 
and gasping feebly for breath&mdash;"I shall not
complain, my lord."</p>

<p>"For thou art guilty?"</p>

<p>"For I am guilty!"</p>

<p>"And by the beard of my father's father, thou
shalt suffer for this folly! Giafar, thou hast spoken
a just and true sentence. It shall not fail of execution. 
See thyself to it. Ere morning, tell me,
and with truth, that yon culprit has ceased to
live!"</p>

<p>"It shall not need, my lord," exclaimed the hakim, 
pointing, as he spoke, to Khatoun. Her face
was overshadowed as with the gloom of death, her
eyes closed; her features, agitated for an instant
by an expression of extreme agony, became fixed
and motionless, and she fell forward lifeless upon
the floor.</p>

<p>"Be thyself, my lord&mdash;all is over! Remember
thy wife," whispered Gabriel to the prince, as he
started forward to raise the fallen Khatoun. But
these words had no power to restrain him. He

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

was unmindful of the presence of his watchful master, 
he saw no object, he thought of nothing but
the stricken and prostrate slave who had sacrificed
her life and fair fame for his safety. He rushed
forward, exclaiming, "I have slain her!&mdash;my preserver! 
my deliverer!" and stooping, he lifted her
face from the earth, and supported her in his arms.
Gabriel followed him, his gravity somewhat disturbed 
by an occurrence so unexpected, saying
quickly, "Give place, my lord. Thou art little
skilled in such matters."</p>

<p>"It shall not be. I deserted her while living&mdash;in 
death, at least, I will support her."</p>

<p>"Thou art mad!" whispered the hakim, as he
stooped to relieve the prince from his senseless
burden. "I have a life, my lord, which I have perilled 
freely for thee. If thou carest not for thine
own safety, at least, bethink thyself of mine."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the hakim, the calif had not noticed 
his agitation, or his secret whispering to the
prince, his attention was at the moment directed to
the falling slave. But when he saw the prince rush
forward, when he listened to the words which
came so unguardedly from his lips, his countenance
darkened, and he exclaimed, angrily, "Giafar, what
meanest thou? resign the slave to the care of the
hakim. Waste not thy grief upon the dead. The
living may yet need all thy sympathy."</p>

<p>These words aroused the prince, who had been
already in part recalled to himself by the words of
Gabriel, and placing the drooping form of Khatoun

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

in the arms of the physician, he arose, standing
mute before the angry frown of his master. "How
is this, Giafar?" said the calif, eying him sternly.
"What means thine emotion?&mdash;and thy words?
Explain them quickly, as thou valuest thy life.
Thou needst not kneel. Stand erect, and speak to
me, while mine eyes are upon thy face."</p>

<p>"I will not deny, my lord," replied the prince,
with unblenching firmness, "that I deeply regret the
fate of this unhappy slave. She was once the favourite 
of my harem. She was once innocent and
pure; then, no one was more faithful or more kind
than she. Influenced by some strange jealousy, she
has erred, it is true, from her duty; yet I remember 
what she once was. I remember, too, the punishment 
which she has endured, the severe imprisonment 
which has wasted her as thou seest, and inflicted 
upon her bosom suffering worse than death.
I think of these, my lord, and wish this blow had
been spared her."</p>

<p>"But thou grievest for a traitress, Giafar! Why
call her thy preserver? what has she done to merit
such a name?"</p>

<p>"And is she not, my lord?" exclaimed the
prince, with unaffected warmth&mdash;"has she not
saved me from thine anger? When I first obtained 
evidence of her guilt, in the violence of passion, 
I had wellnigh punished her with death; but
the prayers of the princess prevailed with me, and
I consigned her to imprisonment. I little thought
that the time would so soon come, when I should owe

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

my own safety to the presence and confession of
that slave. I trembled when I entered her solitude
to-day, to advise her of this interview. She was
borne down by sorrow; and I feared, lest from a
feeling of hatred and revenge, she might deny her
falsehood, and place in peril the life of him who had
been the author of her imprisonment. But thou
hast seen, my lord, how different has been her temper. 
Thou hast seen with what fidelity she has
given, as it were, her life for mine. Her constancy
in this has redeemed her errors, and I cannot but
grieve for her sad death."</p>

<p>The calif answered not. He continued for some
moments looking upon the prince, steadily, but
with a vacant gaze, as though musing upon the
sincerity of his reply. Gabriel, in the mean time,
had been engaged in attending upon the lifeless
Khatoun. Anxiety for his own safety at first interfered 
with this duty, and he could not avoid lending 
his ear to the words of the prince as he accounted 
for his emotion to the suspicious calif.
As he listened to his exculpation, his self-possession 
returned, and he busied himself, with his accustomed 
thoughtfulness and alacrity, to ascertain
the state of the senseless form which he supported.
He examined attentively her pulse, but it replied
not to his careful touch. He placed upon her half-closed 
lips a glossy curl, which had escaped from
beneath her head dress, but no breath stirred the
light ringlet. He listened for the beatings of her

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

heart, but all seemed still. The old man ominously
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Is the slave still alive?" inquired the calif,
speaking for the first time since Giafar's reply to
him.</p>

<p>"I fear not, my lord," answered the hakim.
"Life seems to have departed. It were well if she
were taken from hence."</p>

<p>"Let it be so," said the calif.</p>

<p>"Whither shall she be removed, my lord?" inquired 
the prince.</p>

<p>"It matters not. To thine own palace, if thou
wilt. Let Gabriel see to her."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, my lord."</p>

<p>"And listen, hakim," said the calif, recalling
him&mdash;"if thou canst recover her with thine art, a
purse of gold shall be thine. Look to it. Fidelity
is a rare virtue in these our days."</p>

<p>They placed the lifeless form of the young girl
in a litter, and she was borne to the prince's palace. 
Gabriel followed hastily, to lend his skill and
care in restoring her, while Giafar pursued slowly
his sad and solitary way towards his abode.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borne</span> down by grief and self-reproach, Giafar
returned to his home. Life seemed a burden too
heavy to endure, when laden with such horrors
as had crowded thickly within the compass of a
day. Art and precaution had preserved his own
life, it is true, but had destroyed a lovely and innocent 
being; one whose devotion had interposed
between himself and his master's displeasure, and
had saved him from imminent peril. His own
safety was of light moment to him. The sting
that pressed most deeply into his soul, was the
thought of that ruin which he seemed destined to
pluck down upon the heads of all who interested
themselves in his safety. One true heart had
broken, rent asunder by his own harsh and selfish

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

counsel, and others might follow; how soon, Allah
alone could tell.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at his own abode, he found Khatoun 
still lying as one dead, and the princess, who
was aware of her innocence and fidelity, watching
anxiously near her. He bent over her fragile and
emaciated form, and gazed with anguish upon her
senseless features. He had often seen them beaming 
with hope and joy, when a smile, a word from
him, would inspire her with double life. But now
those features were motionless. Now, epithets
the most endearing could not move her, could not
crimson her cheek, or alarm, with the soft terrors
of love, her once timid and palpitating bosom.
What loveliness had that deep insensibility bound
up in its stern embrace. But love could not awake
it, no! nor remorse nor hope.</p>

<p>She lay pale and motionless. No breathing
that was perceptible moved her bosom, or passed
from her bloodless lips. Her small, white, and
almost transparent hands, were cold&mdash;they responded 
not to the soft pressure with which they
were clasped by that sad pair who were so mournfully 
tending her. Her features still preserved
that rigidity of expression which had fallen upon
them when she sank, in the calif's presence, under
the ruthless sentence which he had passed upon
her. Her eyes were closed, and an expression of
ghastliness had settled about her mouth that was
painful to behold. She looked not as the clay
should look when the soul has departed in gladness, 

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

when the sweetness of the tenant spirit still
lingers about its deserted mansion, telling us that
its last interchange with the body, its moment of
farewell, was one of pleasure, or at least of peace.
Her face wore not that mild and quiet calmness
which is so looked for by the eyes of grieving
friends, and which so cheers the desolation of their
hearts. Giafar marked this, and the thought fearfully 
augmented his anguish.</p>

<p>They watched her long. All the care of the
hakim had been bestowed upon her, until he had
relinquished his efforts in despair. Yet still they
hung over her, stationed mute and motionless on
either side of her low couch, waiting for some
sign of slow-returning life. Midnight had come
and gone, and their hopes were dwindling to a
feeble spark within their bosoms, when the silence
of the chamber was broken by a soft, yet deep and
long-drawn sigh. Again all was silent. They
waited in breathless expectation, gazing in hope
upon her. In a few moments the same low sound
was again heard. It seemed like the sad murmur
of some hovering spirit echoed through the apartment. 
Giafar took the silver lamp, that burned
dimly, and cast its flickering light upon her features. 
No life was seen there&mdash;no motion. Still
they bend over her; a feeble heaving of the bosom
is soon seen&mdash;their eyes are fastened on her&mdash;and
again a sigh comes faintly from her lips. Giafar
tightened the slight pressure in which he detained
her hand, and the princess placed to her lips a

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

handkerchief moistened in some aromatic liquid.
Aroused by this, her eyes unclosed feebly for a
moment, but, without a sign of recognition, they
again quickly closed.</p>

<p>Now followed a deep sleep. During this while,
Giafar and Abassa spoke not save by signs. They
looked with smiling encouragement on each other,
as though they had no wish beyond the recovery
of the stricken Khatoun, as though they had no
griefs of their own, no dangers, and no fears.
Notwithstanding, however, these signs of returning 
life, the hands of the young slave regained not
their warmth, and her delicate feet, which the
care of the princess had wrapped in the softest
furs, were still cold as marble.</p>

<p>A long hour passed by, when, sighing as before,
her drooping lids were heavily lifted, and she
awoke slowly from her slumber. Her attention
was first directed towards the hand which the
princess held, by the warm pressure with which
Abassa clasped it. Seeing it enclosed within another, 
she raised her eyes faintly, as though looking 
for the owner of that kind hand which so carefully 
embraced her own, until they rested upon
the beautiful yet dimmed features that were bending 
so compassionately over her. She gazed in
wonder, until, being sensible of the presence of
some one on the opposite side of the couch, she
turned her head upon the pillow, when her eyes
encountered the prince. She started, as memory
returned, bringing in its train the scenes in which

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

she had enacted her sad and fearful part; then,
with a smile of peculiar sweetness that lighted up
her face almost to brilliancy, she bent an earnest
glance upon the princess. She attempted to press
her hand to her lips, but had not strength sufficient,
and would have spoken, but the words were murmured 
inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Rest thee, Khatoun," said the prince.</p>

<p>"Rest thee, my sweet girl," said Abassa, in kind
tones. "Speak not, but sleep."</p>

<p>She again closed her eyes for a few moments,
and then said, in a low voice,</p>

<p>"This is most kind&mdash;to die thus."</p>

<p>"Do not say this, Khatoun," said the princess.
"We have been weeping over thee as over one
entombed, but thou art returned to life and happiness."</p>

<p>The young girl shook her head faintly, and
replied,</p>

<p>"I have no wish for life. To one who has felt
the woes that have of late disturbed my peace,
death, and to die thus, were blessedness."</p>

<p>"But sleep, Khatoun," said Giafar. "Thou art
weak; to speak, even, may sever that thread of
life which we thought had parted. Sleep, sleep,
and talk when thou awakest."</p>

<p>"The time is short, Giafar," she replied. "I
shall sleep sweetly soon, and full long. Remember 
the words"&mdash;she paused a moment for lack of
strength&mdash;"the words you spoke to me. They
are fast fulfilling. And were it not better&mdash;better

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

to die thus"&mdash;she here looked alternately at those
two who were weeping over her&mdash;"with these
tears dropping upon my unworthy brow&mdash;than
by the sword, the axe, or some hideous instrument
of death? The stern sentence of the calif&mdash;heard
you it not?&mdash;how fearfully it sounded!&mdash;I shall
escape it."</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, she would have continued,
but Giafar interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Fear not that fate, Khatoun. The calif has
relented from his purpose, and will be well pleased
to hear that thou art restored to life. Be calm&mdash;preserve 
thy hope&mdash;all shall go well. Thy fame
shall be restored. These lips shall disavow that
story of thy dishonour."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, my lord," exclaimed the young
girl, with more strength than she had hitherto
evinced. "I know the grief you feel to see me
thus&mdash;'tis written in lines of agony upon your
face. But think you it was yon fearful scene that
has brought me thus early to my grave? Oh no!
Death has long been busy in this bosom. I well
remember when the blow was struck&mdash;but 'tis no
matter now. I am destined soon to depart. Think
not to detain me from the tomb by placing thine
own life in peril. Shall I die more sweetly to
think that thou hast done this? No! let me
breathe my last, fondly hoping that I have saved
thee from destruction."</p>

<p>"Thou hast indeed done this. But imbitter
not the life which thou hast preserved by sacrificing 

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

thine own. Be composed&mdash;ere an hour is
past, I will bring thee a full pardon from the
calif."</p>

<p>" 'Twill be in vain. Need I repeat it, my lord?
Speak to him, lovely princess; thy words"&mdash;she
hesitated a moment&mdash;"thy words can move him.
Tell him, with thine own sweet voice, it will be in
vain. Tell him I am dying. Is it not so? That
hand, is it not cold? This voice, is it not growing 
fainter? Tell him this&mdash;tell him to live for&mdash;thee."</p>

<p>"I cannot," exclaimed Abassa, pouring a flood
of tears upon the face of the dying girl. "I cannot 
dream of happiness unless thou mayst live to
share it."</p>

<p>"Think not of me," was the reply; "I am eager
to depart. I shall find a home in paradise. I am
wearied with grief&mdash;there I shall be at peace. I
am weak&mdash;there I shall find strength. My life
has been a sad sojourn; fear has been my constant
companion on the way, but I shall be 'secure at my
journey's end.' I have erred often, but I am penitent. 
Thank Heaven, I yet live to ask pardon
for that falsehood. It was upon my lips even as
I fell&mdash;and what a falsehood! I had no time for
prayer&mdash;no word&mdash;not one, for mercy. But I am
yet here," she continued, after a slight pause, her
voice scarcely sounding above a whisper, and her
eyes turned steadfastly to heaven&mdash;"and will not
Allah forgive his servant? I remember what I
have professed during my life&mdash;that God is God

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

alone, that he has no partner in his glory, and that
Mohammed is his prophet."</p>

<p>Her strength had by this time become nearly
exhausted, partly from the exertion which she had
made in speaking, but more from the fast approach
of death. She was unable to converse, except in
broken and almost inaudible sentences, and sensible 
that her efforts for this purpose were in vain,
she remained silent, save for the low muttering of
her devotions, awaiting the coming of that messenger 
whose summons she so longed to hear&mdash;of
death, of the deliverer, him who should rescue her
for ever from her woes. Giafar and Abassa stand
beside her couch, each holding a hand which they
feel growing every moment less sensible to their
clasp, and more rigid and unyielding in the stern
embrace of death.</p>

<p>"I have brought this fate upon thee, my faithful
and hapless one," exclaimed the prince in deep
anguish. "Speak once again, and tell me that I
am forgiven." The grief of a woman could not
be more apparent and more uncontrollable than
that which overcame the firmness of Giafar. It
was displayed in a deep groan that burst suddenly
from his bosom, and in the tears that were wetting
his hands with which he strove to conceal such
weakness. The emotion of the princess was in
like manner extreme. Khatoun strove in vain to
reply, but to Giafar's reiterated entreaty for forgiveness, 
she answered with a sweet smile, one
which could not be mistaken. He felt that he was

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

fully and freely pardoned. The dying girl endeavoured 
to draw his hand to her lips, but finding
herself too weak, she loosed the one which was
detained in the gentle clasp of Abassa, and tried
with the united strength of both to effect her purpose. 
Ere she did this she cast an entreating
glance upon the princess, as though asking for
permission and pardon for that last caress. Abassa's 
face was in an instant drooping over her, the
tears falling in a shower from her eyes, and she
exclaimed, "Ask me not. Thou hast saved his
life and mine own, and thou deservest him more
than I." A smile fleeting as the hues of the fleeting 
rainbow shone upon her features, and she feebly
pressed their united hands with a kiss, for Abassa
had assisted in her weak attempt to raise that of
the prince to her lips; but she soon removed them,
for they interrupted that breathing which was becoming 
every moment more laborious and impeded,
and again her eyes faintly closed.</p>

<p>They watched that dying slave&mdash;that lone girl&mdash;and 
wept as for a sister o'er her sad and early fate.
But they cannot keep her back&mdash;they cannot detain 
her from the bright path which is opening before 
her. She does not mind them now. Her
soul trembles upon her quickly moving lips, and is
just departing. She heeds not the pressure of
those dear hands&mdash;she feels not the tears that are
dropping warm upon her icy brow&mdash;she cannot
hear the words of grief and bitter sorrow that are
murmured near her. She hears no voice but one&mdash;the 

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

voice of that stern spirit, as he calls upon
her soul&mdash;and quickly it obeys. Though leaving
a bosom that heaves with hurrying throes, though
parting from lips panting and gasping for the faintest 
breath, yet in a moment it is away, and all is
marble, or as motionless. One convulsive shudder 
as the tyrant enters his domain, and the sad,
the lone, the beautiful, is for ever still.</p>

<p>When death had set his signet upon her features, 
with that stern fixedness and pallor, of which
there is no counterfeit, after gazing for a moment
upon the sweet smile that still lingered about her
lips, they left the couch, and retired still to weep.
Far from her home, that gentle being had come to
find love, a changing lover, and a grave. Even
for him who had deserted her she had died; repaying 
neglect with truth, forgetfulness with unalterable 
fidelity. She was too gentle to bear the
blighting frost which had destroyed the young
blossom of her hopes. She had borne sorrow
until its very malice had befriended her; and her
spirit, wearied with griefs, has passed where they
cannot follow.</p>

<p>Gathered in early spring, this sweet wild flower
from the sunny vale of Khorasan, had bloomed for
a short summer amid the gay gardens of Bagdad;
but rude winds laid it soon low, and it now fades
beneath the green cypress upon the banks of the
Tigris.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p>Verily we sent down the Koran in the night Al Kadr. And
what shall make thee understand how excellent is that night?
The night Al Kadr is better than a thousand months. Therein
do the angels descend, and the spirit Gabriel, by the permission
of their Lord, with his decrees concerning every matter. It is
peace until the rising of the morn.&mdash;<i>Koran</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a holy night in the Moslem's year.
The "night of excellence" it is called. Upon this
night "many wonders, secret and invisible, are
performed. All inanimate things adore God; the
waters of the sea lose their saltness, and become
fresh and sweet, in these mysterious moments."
This is the hour for devotion. This is the hour for
praise. Upon this night are the Divine decrees for
the ensuing year brought down from the highest
heavens, and given to the charge of angels to execute. 
This is the hour for prayer; ere the scroll
is written, ere the decree has gone forth. Let the
sinner, though his crimes were numberless, then
turn in supplication to the Most High, and it were
worth heaven to him. Prayer upon this night is
better than the prayers of a thousand months. Yet
it hath not pleased the all-wise Allah to reveal the
time of this night to mortals; no saint nor prophet
hath declared it. Watch, therefore, and pray continually, 

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

lest it escape. "Since you know not,"
says the Koran, "the time of this night, so act that
each night may hold you the place of this."</p>

<p>When all the world is sleeping and at rest, Abassa 
watches, weeps, and prays. Many a lone hour
she passes in supplication to Heaven, that her sorrows 
may be removed away. In the silence of the
night many a tear falls from her eyes to earth, and
many a sigh is wafted as grateful incense to that
land from whence only she can look for relief. No
one on earth can aid her now. Whither, then,
should the trembler turn? To Heaven. Alas!
that we so long delay our approach to that sure
fortress; that we should wait till sorrows or dangers 
gather around us, and drive us to its shelter;
and then how are our hopes deadened, our confidence 
destroyed, by the thought that it is our need,
and not our will, that urges us. Though her own
griefs press sorely upon her spirits, yet she forgets
not the departed Khatoun. She often mingles
with her devotions a prayer for her peace, and
weeps too, as she remembers her constancy and
truth.</p>

<p>Is prayer of none effect? Is Heaven pitiless?
or has mercy, that sits above, bending for ever from
the clouds, retired deep into yon blue abyss, wearied 
with her gentle office? Spring comes; yet
with it comes not peace. The crisis of her fate
draws nigh. Months of misery have saddened and
thinned her face; feeble and trembling, she looks
not for relief, but in calm despair awaits that hour

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

which should bring the mother joy and a new love,
but from which she expects naught but grief and
danger. She has not failed to leave Bagdad, to
court the pure air that wanders unconfined through
those pleasant gardens upon the Tigris; she visits
often the good old Ibrahim, and in his bosom reposes 
her sorrows. Yet all these avail not. Paler
and paler becomes her cheek, deeper and deeper
her gloom; her danger nearer, her hope more distant.</p>

<p>Giafar is with her, sad and comfortless. His
courage and endurance had been tried to the uttermost, 
and had yielded at one time to the severe
pressure of danger and horror that had descended
upon him, as the staunch bark bends to the sweeping 
winds, and stoops into the deep, labouring and
o'erpressed by the thick-coming waters. Yet, as
that bark emerges from the waves, and dashes again
undaunted through the deep, so rose from their prostration 
the fortitude and firmness of the prince, impaired 
in nowise by the trials which had, for a
time, endangered them. In addition to this, however, 
he had passed through the furnace of affliction, 
and sorrow had done that which terror had
not been able to accomplish. It had permanently
depressed his spirit; it had clouded his face with
gloom, and rendered him, for a long time, deaf to all
consolation, even though whispered by the dear
voice of his wife, and insensible to all pleasure,
though shared and sweetened by her presence.
The fate of the gentle and hapless Khatoun had

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

laved his soul with the waters of grief, and had
torn away its best defences, and now, remorse and
self-reproach were rolling in upon his untrenched
bosom.</p>

<p>The death of that soft being who had so loved
him, and so suffered for him, filled his soul with
regret. He remembered the love which he had
so lightly given her, but which she had treasured 
up like gold refined, and though custom
authorized, and religion sanctioned all his actions,
yet the evil was too plain; it had, as it were, become 
palpable by her sufferings. He remembered
the sacrifice which she had made for him; he called
to mind her last hours, when even Heaven was
almost forgotten, and her thoughts seemed bound
up in him, and in his safety. Memory was a fiend
to torture him. He had endured worse than death,
and, save for his duty to others, would long ere this
have given up his life into his master's hands.</p>

<p>He prostrates himself in prayer often for the
happiness and safety of his sorrowing wife, and
often for the peace of the departed Khatoun. He
scatters alms with prodigal hand, and begs the
prayers of sheik and imam. They bless his
piety, and pray for the sweet dead. He reared no
marble over her tomb. He paid no outward testimonies 
of sorrow; but he has written out, as he
had promised, a fair epitaph; the story of her innocence 
and truth, that in after times the world may
know of her fidelity, and weep over her unhappy
fate.</p>

<p>Summer comes. The hour is past. From the

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

strict seclusion of her chamber, the princess comes
forth changed. Her eye again smiles, again she
seems almost happy. Can it be? Have her
prayers been heard? Is Heaven propitious? Has
she found the night Al Kadr? Of great power is
prayer. The angels stoop to listen, and with permission 
of their master, bring down the wished-for
blessing. Of great power is prayer. It opens the
gates of paradise. It brings peace from its high
mansion to dwell in the hearts of the unfortunate.
It strengthens, it sooths, it blesses. Mourner, be
glad&mdash;murmurer, be still! There is a heaven replete 
with joys and blessings; there is a hand
which from that high storehouse scatters them
abundantly upon this earth. If they descend not
at once upon your heads, be patient, be resigned.
Even in the darkest hour, when hope seems farthest 
distant, light and relief may be most nigh.</p>

<p>During this time the calif had clothed himself in
kindness. The bold demeanour and readiness of
Giafar had shaken his master's belief of his disobedience; 
and the report of the hakim, and the testimony 
of Khatoun, sufficed to remove all jealousy
from his mind. If any cloud of distrust darkened
upon him, it was when he thought of the agitation
which the prince exhibited during the confession
of that unfortunate girl, and the anxiety which he
manifested for her fate. But with the moment
vanished the anger and suspicion, and his mind,
welcomed with delight the return of past, yet not

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

forgotten pleasures. The importunity of the physician 
Gabriel for the health of the princess his
daughter had prevailed with the Commander of
the Faithful, and he had given Giafar permission
to retire with his wife from the crowded city to
the seclusion of his summer gardens. He often
heard tidings of her welfare; that she was still
weighed down by sickness and gloom; yet when
the summer came he visited her retirement, and
found her freed in great part from that depression
which had so long overshadowed her peace. She
still wore the marks of sorrow upon her countenance, 
but they were fast vanishing. Her cheek
was regaining its colour, her eye its brightness,
and her sweet face its smiles. Well pleased was
Haroun to behold this change. If a lingering fear
yet hovered over him, it did not influence his demeanour, 
nor his feelings towards his children.
The malice of fortune seemed, at last, exhausted,
and, through very inconstancy, she again was
kind.</p>

<p>At length the calif, for the seventh time, turned
his face towards the holy city. His motive for
the pilgrimage was not religion alone, though its
duties were always pleasing to the monarch. It
was his purpose to leave the succession to his
three sons conjointly, and to this effect he had
written his testament. He was desirous that the
disposition which he had made of his kingdom
should be known during his lifetime; and to render 

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

it doubly sacred in the eyes of his subjects, he
wished it published to the world under peculiar
religious ceremonies. It was his intention to
affix, with great solemnity, his testament to the
wall of the sacred temple at Mecca, that pilgrims
from all parts of Islam might there peruse it, and
learn to hold it in reverence, as the will of the
high priest of their faith; and that under circumstances 
well adapted to inspire them with veneration 
for their religion, and for him who stood in
the place of its Blessed Author. His wish to do
this was not the less, when he thought that the
relation in which the prince stood to his family
might one day give to the world a pretender to
his crown, either in the person of Giafar himself,
or of his offspring. He himself might soon be laid
in the dust; and even if the prince had hitherto
been obedient to his commands, yet when his own
strong hand wielded not the sceptre, the temptation 
of a crown, superadded to that of love, might
prove too powerful for his allegiance.</p>

<p>Sumptuous and splendid beyond the memory of
former times, was this pilgrimage of Haroun al
Raschid to the holy city.<sup><a id="r016" href="#n016">16</a></sup> Troops of attendants,
richly dressed, armed slaves on foot, mounted
guards, composed an endless cavalcade; and a
numerous band of grave imams, and doctors of
the law, dignified the procession with their presence. 
Soft carpets were spread out over the waste
of sand, upon which walked the calif and his sons,

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

surrounded by the principal officers of his household. 
Tempting fruits, refreshing drinks, and
delicacies of every description, awaited the pilgrims 
at various stations on the road; and the
rude Arab wondered to see the gorgeousness
and splendour of cities strewn across the desert.
Snow from the mountains cooled their sherbets
and viands; and camels laden with it abundantly,
bore that hitherto unknown luxury to the astonished 
inhabitants of Mecca. Pride and self-complacency 
mingled with piety in the monarch's
bosom, as he thought upon his power, his pomp,
and sacred duty, and journeying in all ease and
safety, he slowly approached the holy city.</p>

<p class="stanza">Clasp me a little longer on the brink
Of fate! while I can feel thy dear caress;
And when this heart has ceased to beat, oh! think,
And let it mitigate thy woe's excess,
That thou hast been to me all tenderness,
And friend to more than human friendship just.
Oh! by that retrospect of happiness,
And by the hopes of an immortal trust,
God shall assuage thy pangs when I am laid in dust.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers must once more glance at the summer 
gardens of Prince Giafar. With the season
had returned their loveliness. The river rolled by
with its wonted celerity. The rose and henna
were still denizens of that dear spot. Nature's
melody was again heard, cheering those whose
bosoms were untenanted by sorrow, but falling like
bitter mockery upon the hearts of the careworn.
There was the delightful kiosk&mdash;the zephyrs were
breathing their sighs through the faintly resisting
latticework, causing it to tremble as they entered.
Within, enjoying their freshness and their music,
was seated, as in times past, the Princess Abassa.</p>

<p>The flight of two years, and the anxieties which
had crowded themselves into that eventful period,
had somewhat changed her&mdash;had thrown, as it

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

were, a veil over the radiance of her charms, but
had left them more soft and touching. A light
shade of crimson tinged her cheek, her forehead
was pale, but still intellectual and noble in its outline, 
and her eye had a melancholy sadness in its
expression, and was somewhat sunken within its
orbit. Her dark hair had lost nothing of its luxuriance, 
but still fell in profusion down her neck, covering 
her shoulders. Care, not crime, had stamped
its lineaments upon her lovely face, and his less
ruthless hand, though it had dimmed the brilliancy of
her beauty, had not dared to profane its sweetness.</p>

<p>Giafar was reclining near her feet. To look
upon his calm, unruffled brow, one would not deem
him a partaker in those griefs which had left their
impress upon her features. If anything was visible
in his countenance beyond firmness and reflection,
it was a shade of anxious, sad tenderness, with
which he gazed upon his wife. His own sorrows
seemed not to have affected or altered him&mdash;yet
they were the same with hers; the same were
their fears, too, and the same their danger. Parents&mdash;they 
wept an infant separated from them
since the first moment of its being. Lovers&mdash;they
feared lest the discovery of its existence might
lead to their mutual destruction. The ruin which
they had so narrowly escaped had been averted by
the firmness and fidelity of the hakim Gabriel. By
his counsel, the princess, ere the winter had passed,
had left the city, to seek, in the retirement of her
husband's villa, the health which she had lost.

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

Great prudence, seconded by extreme good fortune, 
accomplished all their wishes, and the heavens
seemed once again to smile upon them. Yet still
they were free neither from anxiety nor danger.
Their infant child had been sent to Mecca under
the care of a faithful slave, there to be secretly
reared. It was by no means improbable, therefore, 
that the calif, during his sojourn there, might
be informed of its existence. Yet this state of suspense 
was one of comparative enjoyment. Despair
had been hitherto their dwelling-place, and to pass
even a step beyond its borders was something.
Yet this could not long endure. The return of
the calif was near at hand, and their uncertainty
must soon terminate in security and happiness,
or in the fulfilment of their most dreadful anticipations.</p>

<p>"How slowly creep the hours!" said the princess. 
"Will he not soon return?"</p>

<p>"Weeks must yet elapse ere we shall see him,"
replied the prince. "The duties of religion still
detain him near the holy shrine. Allah grant that
they may sink into his heart and soften it! May
he return kind and forgiving!"</p>

<p>"You look upon his coming with great dread,
Giafar," said the princess, "since you utter so
earnestly that prayer."</p>

<p>"I will not deny it. Dark forebodings have
been haunting my mind of late, which I am unable,
even in thy presence, to shake off. It may be that
I am so used to tremble that I start at a shadow.

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

He whose vessel is returning richly laden, fears
the smallest cloud lest it should bring a tempest
We have so much to lose that I cannot but dread
even the most remote chance of danger."</p>

<p>"Have we not," replied the princess, "escaped
those which have threatened us tenfold more than
this present? why, then, should we distrust the
goodness of Allah which has hitherto preserved us?
For myself, I await with impatience the return of
my father. We shall then hear of our dear, our
absent child, or we shall at least know if its existence 
is still a secret. Its fate is bound up in ours.
Alas!" exclaimed the disconsolate mother, "what
rude hands may be now tending it&mdash;but no danger
can come near it&mdash;can there?&mdash;my father even in
his anger would not harm it&mdash;would he, Giafar?"</p>

<p>The prince hesitated to answer the torturing
question. "Fear it not," he replied&mdash;"tyrants alone
trample upon the unoffending, and Al Raschid,
methinks, would spare the helpless and innocent."</p>

<p>"What grief, what ill fortune to lose it thus!"
said the princess; "to be deprived of the dear pleasure 
of supplying its wants, hushing its cries, and
watching its smiles. It seems as if Heaven sent
us its blessings only that we should know their
value and then lose them. My child is taken from
me&mdash;if I should be deprived of thee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grieve not, light of mine eyes!" interrupted
the prince; "Allah will watch over its welfare&mdash;all 
its wants will be well supplied by the faithful
hands in which we have deposited it; and I well

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

hope that the day is not far distant, when it will
be restored to thine arms in safety. But weep not&mdash;tears 
are sad omens!" He was interrupted by
a slight tap at the door of the apartment, and a
slave entered and placed in his hands a letter.
The prince glanced at the seal and turned pale.
"How! the Commander of the Faithful returned!"
he exclaimed&mdash;"who brought this missive?"</p>

<p>"A horseman, my lord."</p>

<p>"Has he gone?" inquired the prince.</p>

<p>"He departed without drawing his foot from the
stirrup," replied the slave.</p>

<p>"Said he nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my lord."</p>

<p>Giafar waved his hand, and the slave retired.
Abassa, who had watched his countenance, and
saw that he trembled as he opened the sealed
epistle, listened with terrible agitation as he read
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="center">"<i>Haroun al Raschid, to his trusty servant Giafar,
greeting:</i></p>

<p>"I am now at Anbar. Before I enter Bagdad
I would advise with thee respecting an affair of
weight. Mount thy horse, and spare not the spur
until thou art here. Farewell!"</p>

<br/>

<p>"Allah be praised! my fears were awake too
soon," exclaimed the princess, her face brightening
as she listened. " 'Tis well&mdash;is it not?&mdash;speak,
Giafar!&mdash;why dost thou not answer me?&mdash;why

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

dost thou look so anxiously? These are not words
of anger&mdash;kindness and love breathe throughout
these lines&mdash;smile!&mdash;why dost thou not smile?
Is it so?" she exclaimed, in a piercing tone, catching 
terror from his looks. "Are we lost?"</p>

<p>"Life of my soul!" said Giafar, clasping her to
his bosom, "be not thus shaken&mdash;the buffetings and
storms of fortune have loosened the firm fabric of
thy mind, or thou wouldst not from these lines
gather such fears."</p>

<p>" 'Twas from thee, 'twas in thy face that I read
them," she replied, encouraged by his words.</p>

<p>"I was moved more, then, than I thought. I myself 
have lost that constancy, that steadiness of
soul, of which I was once too proud."</p>

<p>"Wonder not, then," replied Abassa, "that I, a
woman, should sometimes quail, even at imaginary
danger. Oh, Giafar! I live in thee&mdash;on thee I depend 
for fortitude, for firmness. See!&mdash;I am calm
again&mdash;thy words have reassured me."</p>

<p>"Mistake me not, Abassa. I would not have
thy bosom give entrance to ill-founded hopes or
needless fears; the one would uselessly torture, the
other bitterly deceive thee. These lines are fair
and flattering. I cannot read destruction in them;
but experience has ill served me, if I should take
them as they seem. 'Tis true, it matters not. My
duty leads me to my master, though it were to
leave my head at his feet. Yet, I would fain know
if I am to return to thee again, or if I must part
from thee now for ever. Let me read this scroll

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

once more. There is a strange coldness in these
lines; I cannot recognise my master in them: yet
there is no anger here. But why await me at
Anbar? All is inexplicable! And then&mdash;his sudden 
return. How strange! By Allah! he must
have crossed the desert with the speed of lightning. 
For what?&mdash;why such haste? One cause
I can imagine, and but one. There is no open revolt, 
no secret plotting, no foreign incursion&mdash;no,
nothing of these can have led to his return. Heaven 
protect us if my fears are true! Stay!&mdash;let
me consult my horoscope. It may be that the
stars will vouchsafe some token by which I may
explain this mystery."</p>

<p>He then took his astrolabe, and placing the
ephemerides before him, was about to cast his
horoscope, when suddenly&mdash;"Hark!" was the
exclamation of both. A clear voice came from
the river, singing the following verses in Arabic:
"He governs himself by the stars, and thinks not
that Allah is the ruler of the stars, and that his
will must infallibly be accomplished." Every syllable 
fell distinctly on their ears.</p>

<p>"How ominous are those words!" said Giafar,
letting the astrolabe drop from his hands. He
threw open the lattice and looked out upon the
Tigris. A single boat was floating down the
stream, while its pilot was lightening his labour
by song. The words which he had chosen were
strangely applicable to the condition of the prince,
and impressed upon his mind a gloom of which he

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

was unable to divest himself. " 'Tis so," he said,
" 'tis so!&mdash;the will of Heaven be done!" and then
added, in the words of an Eastern proverb, " 'When
the hour of destiny is come, the prey runs to the
feet of the huntsman.' Farewell, my own life!&mdash;farewell! 
I will take leave of thee as though it
were the last. Be firm&mdash;be resolute. All is not
lost. We may again meet&mdash;again we may be
happy. But if Allah has so ordered it that
thine eyes should no more behold me, thou wilt
not regret, dearest, that we have taken this last,
this sad farewell."</p>

<p>Tears, loud sobs, and, intermingled with them,
half suppressed screams, testified the grief and
despair that were rending Abassa's heart, as, infolded 
in her husband's arms, she received and
returned those embraces which had been so dear,
and which might never be hers again. "Let me
charge thee, mine own life, give not thy soul up
to grief, until thou shalt hear that the worst has
come upon me; for it may be," continued the
prince, while he vainly attempted a smile, "it may
be, that my fears deceive and unman me." His
lips dwelt for a moment upon her pale forehead,
and he proceeded. "Should it be otherwise, however, 
when thou first hearest that&mdash;nay, do not
tremble thus!&mdash;when thou first hearest of my
death&mdash;delay not one moment&mdash;fly with this ring&mdash;it 
is thy father's fatal gift&mdash;fly with it to the
good hermit. With him thou wilt be safe, and his
counsel will direct thy future life. Farewell!&mdash;despair 

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

not&mdash;forget me not&mdash;still live&mdash;thou art a
mother, and mayst yet regain thy child. Fear
not that I shall forget thee! In paradise I will
await thy coming; no bright-eyed houri of them
all shall tempt me from thee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay&mdash;stay with me!" exclaimed the princess.
"If death comes, let it find us together. Sorrow
will soon kill me; and is it not better, Giafar, that
I should die with thee, than linger here a short,
sad time, and then follow seeking thee, trembling
and alone?"</p>

<p>"Did I know," replied the prince, "that the sentence 
for my death had gone forth, I would await
it here; but thou forgettest we have much to hope,
if our fears, our grief would let us. I will seek
the calif, and at his feet beg yet to live for thee.
It may be, even if he has discovered our disobedience, 
he may in some part relent from his purpose. 
He may not punish us with death. I will
not, then, increase his anger by slighting his commands. 
No, I will go to him. Farewell, once
more! Mahmoud shall go with me, and bring
thee instant news of my fate."</p>

<p>"There is yet a fleeter messenger," said the
princess&mdash;"a winged one. The swiftest steed
would creep to my impatient senses."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well thought of," replied Giafar.</p>

<p>The princess left the apartment, and in a moment 
returned with a carrier pigeon fluttering in
her hands. "This will not delay," she said. "It
will not wander, Giafar; I have taken it from its

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

young. Go&mdash;go, dear bird, and return quickly, a
messenger of joy!" She then enclosed the unconscious 
bird in a small coffer, bedewing it with
tears the while, and gave it to the prince.</p>

<p>Kiss answers kiss in long and lingering succession. 
Embrace begets embrace even until nature's
power to grieve is exhausted. They half part, and
again are fast locked in each other's arms. Their
tears stream again in a mingled current down their
closely pressed cheeks, and the loud sobs that rend
Abassa's breast seem bursting from the bosom of
the prince. Their souls seem interchanged&mdash;he
leaves his own with her when he departs, and
carries hers to death with him. He has torn himself 
from her for the last time, and casts not a
glance behind upon her drooping form, lest it
should have power to withhold him from his departure. 
He rushes hastily from the apartment.
He descends&mdash;seeks the slave Mahmoud, and
places in his hands the coffer containing the fleet
messenger of the princess, and then they mount
and away.</p>

<p>Fast they fly over the plain. The speed at
which they ride serves to divert the attention of
the prince from the tumult that is raging within his
bosom; and sensible of this, he urges his steed to
the exertion of his utmost powers. Mahmoud follows 
close upon the track of his master. They stop
for naught, until the sun proclaims to them that the
hour of prayer has arrived. Having found some
clear stream where they may perform their ablutions, 

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

they alight, and repeat the namaz of noon.
The devotion of many years seems concentrated in
that short and earnest prayer. This done, they
delay yet a moment, until they have refreshed their
panting horses in the running stream, and then they
mount, and speed upon their road.</p>

<p>In this way they had ridden until an hour past
midday, and were within a short distance of Anbar, 
when Giafar perceived a solitary horseman
speeding towards them. As the distance diminished 
between them, he recognised him. It was
Jasser, a man of stern and sanguinary temper; and
well chosen, if for the execution of a tyrant's vengeance. 
The misgivings which passed through the
mind of the prince were soon changed into horrid
certainty, when, upon his near approach, the officer 
showed him the signet ring of the calif, and demanded 
his sword. Giafar hesitated a moment,
then loosed his scimitar from his girdle, and resigned 
it into the hands of the officer. Jasser then
abruptly produced an order from the calif for the
prince's head. Even in that trying moment, the
firmness of the prince did not forsake him. He
read the order without emotion; examined the
well-known writing of his master, and scanned inquisitively 
the seal which was stamped upon it.
Nothing was wanting&mdash;no formality had been omitted. 
He was well accustomed to the simplicity of
Eastern executions, and felt that his fate was
sealed. "When was this given?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Anbar."</p>

<p>"How seemed the Commander of the Faithful?
Overcome with anger, or did he place this in your
hands with hesitation, or reluctance?"</p>

<p>"Neither, my lord; but with perfect calmness.
His words were these, as I bowed low before him,
to receive his commands: 'Jasser, turn thy horse's
head towards Bagdad; upon the road, coming
hitherward, thou wilt meet with Giafar al Barmeki&mdash;bring 
me his head!' "</p>

<p>"What! no token of regret, no tremour, no faltering?"</p>

<p>"Mine eyes saw none of these, my lord."</p>

<p>"And is it thus that he has pronounced a sentence 
of death against a well-tried and faithful servant? 
It suffices. Mahmoud!"</p>

<p>The slave drew near, and Giafar, having taken
from his hands the coffer, knelt upon the sand, and
traced on a small piece of parchment the simple
word "Farewell!" Having taken the affrighted
bird from its prison, he fastened the folded parchment 
under its wing, and then proceeded to bathe
its parched feet with vinegar in which roses had
been steeped, that it might not be tempted from its
homeward flight to settle upon the cool waters
which lay beneath. "Stoop not from thy flight,"
he said; "let no stream lure thee by its freshness,
lest its waters obliterate what I have written. Her
tears will wash it soon away. Dost mind me?" he
continued. "Bear it swiftly, and safely home&mdash;<i>there</i>, 

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

where is thy heart and mine! Go! 'tis the
last earthly intercourse between us."</p>

<p>He has committed the impatient bird to the air,
and is watching intently its departure. Quickly it
speeds away, and as fast come thronging into his
mind thoughts of his helpless wife&mdash;how much he
should have said to her of consolation, of fortitude,
of heaven! Merciful Allah! he has written but
a single word, and his messenger is a speck, scarcely 
visible upon the horizon. "Back! back!" shouted 
the wretched man, franticly. The sound of his
own voice recalled him to himself. He turned&mdash;the 
minister of death was at his side, in readiness
for his dread task. In a moment he composed himself; 
and placing in the hands of his slave a purse of
gold, and the jewelled poniard that he wore, he
said, "Take these, Mahmoud&mdash;thou deservest
them. Return with speed, and when thou next
seest the princess, thy mistress, tell her"&mdash;his utterance 
was choked for a moment&mdash;"tell her
that thine eyes have beheld me treading upon the
verge of the tomb, and that I trembled not, my
voice did not falter, neither did my heart fail me,
but when I thought of her. From me tell her to
be patient and resigned. If death should visit her,
bid her fear not. Say&mdash;remember well, Mahmoud!&mdash;say&mdash;except 
this brief taper be extinguished, 
the morning will not dawn. Those words,
methinks, will sound sweetly to her ears. Go!"</p>

<p>Giafar then turned to prepare himself for death.
He repeated aloud the confession of his faith&mdash;"There 

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

is no God but God, and Mohammed is the
prophet of God." This done, he lays aside his
turban, and gathering his robe about him, bends
his neck to the stroke of the scimitar. Upon the
gloom of death which has settled on his countenance, 
a light flashes, and instantaneously like
lightning a thought of hope darts across his mind.
He lifts his head&mdash;the scimitar is uplifted, but the
blow has not yet fallen. "Stay, Jasser!" he
exclaimed, and rises from the earth. "Stay!&mdash;there 
is yet time, and, it may be, yet a gleam of
hope for me. Do not wonder that I should cling
thus to life&mdash;I have much to live for. Did you
receive this order for my death after the prayer of
the morning?"</p>

<p>"I did, my lord."</p>

<p>"It may be," said the prince, "that the calif was
heated with wine, or moved by some sudden and
undue anger, and would regret the execution of
this sentence against me. Return, and tell him
that his commands have been obeyed. If he repent, 
I shall be still in life; if not, my head is always 
ready."</p>

<p>"It cannot be, my lord," replied the stern officer. 
"It were trifling with mine own life, thus to
neglect the commands of the calif. His words
were plain, and I must not wander from them."</p>

<p>"I cannot fly, Jasser. Escape, did I meditate
it, were impossible; for who throughout the calif's
wide dominions would shelter or aid an outlaw
and a traitor?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

<p>"Thou art well esteemed, Prince Giafar. Thy
family is most powerful, and the many discontented 
spirits which are scattered throughout Persia
would readily rally round the standard of rebellion, 
when raised by one whose rank and name
would offer so fair a prospect of success."</p>

<p>"These are vain fancies of thine own creating,
Jasser."</p>

<p>"I have spoken as from myself, my lord; but if
I err not, the calif harbours against you the same
suspicions."</p>

<p>"Can it be?&mdash;enter such thoughts into my master's 
bosom? I have but little hope, then, if I have
aroused his fears. But let us return together into
the calif's presence; there I will lay my head at
his feet; and bear well in mind, Jasser, that if the
Commander of the Faithful should repent him of
my death, upon thy head will he visit the punishment 
of thy precipitation. Stay!" added the
prince, seeing him hesitate; "there is not wanting
a witness of my request." Giafar was about to
beckon the slave Mahmoud, who had withdrawn
a short distance from them, awaiting anxiously the
fate of his master, but Jasser replied, "It shall not
need, my lord&mdash;thy wish is granted; and now to
horse, for Bagdad. The sun is fast descending
down the sky."</p>

<p>"To Bagdad?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to the calif."</p>

<p>"How!" said Giafar, "is the Commander of the
Faithful in the city?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

<p>"He returned this morning, my lord, by the road
beyond the river."</p>

<p>"Well, away then, in the name of Allah! I
would not tarry from my fate."</p>

<p>Their voices were now drowned by the rapid
motion and trampling of their steeds, and Giafar,
riding hard by the side of the rude soldier, retraced
his road to Bagdad.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must now return to the unhappy princess.
Fell heavily upon her poor heart the sound of their
departing horses' hoofs, as Giafar, followed by the
slave Mahmoud, rode quickly away. She listened
with a feeling of wintry desolation as to the departure 
of her last hope, until her ear could no
longer distinguish the sound from the loud and
quick throbbings of her heart. Then she sank
into a state of stunning despair. He was gone&mdash;the 
shield with whose defence she had breasted
often the assaults of fortune, and her foreboding
heart told her he would no more return.</p>

<p>After remaining for some moments in a state

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

approaching to stupor, she arose and ascended to
the roof of the kiosk, there to await the return of
her fleet messenger. As she attained the terrace,
she caught a glimpse&mdash;the last, she whispered to
herself&mdash;of her dear lord, speeding across the
plain; but the gathering dust and distance increasing, 
in a moment snatched him from her sight.
There she remained, like the lone mariner upon
his driving vessel, after the pitiless sea has swept
away the last companion of his danger, helpless,
and looking, though hopelessly, for relief. She
strove to strengthen and support her soul with
prayer; she tried to fix her wavering thoughts on
heaven; but if her hopes are there above, her
heart, her happiness, are yet fluttering upon the
earth ere they take wing.</p>

<p>Pallid and trembling, she fixes an intent gaze
upon the spreading horizon, watching wildly for
the coming bird. Now she is absorbed in her
griefs, and her eyes seem to wander, or to gaze
without precision and distinctness upon the space
before her; then again collecting herself, she directs
them with searching scrutiny above, around, wherever 
she may expect her winged herald, fearful, as
she turns her sight towards one point of the horizon, 
lest it shall have emerged quickly from some
other.</p>

<p>She now starts convulsively. Some sudden
pang&mdash;no!&mdash;she sees it coming. She rises panting&mdash;she 
throws back the locks, that are streaming
around her face. She leans eagerly forward to

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

catch the flutterer&mdash;a moment, and it is in her bosom. 
She attempts in breathless haste to loose
the scroll which she perceives fastened under its
wing, but her fingers refuse their office. She
drops her hands at her side, for it is in vain&mdash;she
must first calm her trembling frame. Again she
essays the task; and having taken the parchment,
she glances upon the writing. "Farewell!" She
can see no more&mdash;she dashes her hand across her
eyes, as though to remove the mist which, as she
thinks, obscures her vision, and bends her head
again to read, but the pitiless paper tells her nothing 
but "farewell." There is a gasping for
breath, a scream, a struggling with thick-coming
horrors, a wild throb of an almost bursting heart,
and all is still. Sense and misery together have
deserted the unhappy princess.</p>

<p>As one who has gone to rest, and must rise ere
the night is over to watch or depart from home, is
true to the appointed hour, and needs not to be
aroused from sleep, so was it with her. She had
swooned alone. No maidens were near with their
kind offices to revive her, to dash refreshing water
upon her brow, to bear her where the coolest
breeze might "visit her pale cheek," or with reviving 
odours to restore her senses. No&mdash;a task yet
unperformed, the last request of Giafar, seemed
even in insensibility to weigh upon her thoughts,
and her soul returns quickly to her lifeless body to
send the sweet clay upon its errand.</p>

<p>She revives soon, and pressing the ring to her

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

lips, descends, agitated, speechless, and motions her
maidens to attend her and prepare her litter. Her
slaves bear her quickly to the hermit's cell. She
enters in haste, and ere the old man is aware of
her coming, drops senseless in his arms. Water
was brought from the fountain without, and poured
plentifully over her pale brow, and in a moment
she again revived. Her voice sounded in a shrill
shriek, as clasping the hands of the hermit within
her own, she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"It is over, father! My dear lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The prince, thy husband, what of him?" said
the dervis, hastily.</p>

<p>"Slain!&mdash;murdered!" was all her tongue could
utter.</p>

<p>"Allah have mercy!" said the old man, bending
in anguish to the earth. "Is it so, in truth? Did
thine eyes behold it?"</p>

<p>"These eyes, sayst thou? Thinkst thou, father,
I could see it and yet live? No! no! this will
tell thee&mdash;here&mdash;'tis written"&mdash;and she placed in
the hands of the old man the parchment which the
bird had brought to her, and related to him hurriedly, 
yet weeping the while, and in broken sentences, 
the departure of the prince, his fears, his
last charge to her&mdash;all, all, ere he could ask&mdash;the
fleet messenger&mdash;its quick return&mdash;and then, pointing 
to the scroll, and with eyes that would pierce
into the old man's soul, she exclaimed, "Thou
knowest all. Is there&mdash;but no&mdash;yet tell me, is
there hope?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

<p>Striving with his emotion, and repressing the
throes of grief that shook his aged bosom, the hermit 
directed his finger to heaven, and replied,</p>

<p>"Yes, there is hope above&mdash;hope for him&mdash;hope
for&mdash;hark!" As the hermit listened, his
and agitation returned. The quick gallop of a
horse urged to full speed sounded near and nearer.
It stopped suddenly without, and in a moment the
slave Mahmoud burst breathless into the cell. The
habits of servility and respect in which Mahmoud
had been rigorously trained, were too strong even
for the deep interest of that moment, and ere he
spoke he bent in obeisance to the ground before the
feet of the princess.</p>

<p>"Speak&mdash;speak, Mahmoud&mdash;what of thy master?" 
exclaimed, at the same instant, both Abassa
and the hermit.</p>

<p>"I have seen the writing of death&mdash;I have heard
the last prayer uttered&mdash;I have beheld the victim
kneel, the sword uplifted&mdash;yet the blow has been
staid. The prince, my master, is even now upon
the road to Bagdad."</p>

<p>A few words sufficed Mahmoud to relate what
has been told at length in a preceding chapter.
He had hardly concluded his account ere he was
interrupted by the dervis&mdash;</p>

<p>"The calif&mdash;where is he?"</p>

<p>"Approaching the city slowly with his train&mdash;at
least I heard this upon the road," answered the
slave.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

<p>"Allah be praised! who watches over the safety
of his children. There may yet be time."</p>

<p>"He lives, then!" exclaimed the princess, when
her emotion permitted her to speak. "Oh, take
me to him! take me to my father, that at his feet
I may implore him, in words that no lips save mine
can utter, to spare my husband. Quickly, quickly,
good father!"</p>

<p>"Be calm, my daughter," said the old man, himself 
trembling with the deepest emotion, as he led
Abassa into an inner apartment of his cell. "All
shall be done which may avert his fate. Nay, do
not distrust me. I have power of which thou little
dreamest. Remain here till my return; repose
with confidence upon mine aid. I work by means
of which Heaven alone has knowledge." Thus
saying, he took the ring from the hand of the wondering 
and almost unconscious princess, and then
turned to the slave, exclaiming, "And now, Mahmoud, 
help me to thy horse. I must ride as though
the avenging spirit were behind me. Speed me,
most merciful Allah, upon mine errand!" Uttering 
this ejaculation, the dervis rushed from her
presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> his arrival at the holy city, the Commander 
of the Faithful, having fulfilled the customary 
duties of a pilgrim, proceeded forthwith
to the performance of that ceremony, which was
the principal object of his visit to Mecca.</p>

<p>Great pomp and splendour were displayed in
the celebration of this rite, but the description
thereof, though it figures largely in the annals of
oriental magnificence, is in nowise necessary to
our narration. We will omit it, therefore, and be
content with noticing the following incident, which
bears somewhat upon our story. "When the officer 
who was appointed for this purpose," says the
historian, "was about to affix the testament of the
calif to the wall of the sacred building, a gust of
wind snatched it from his hand, and wafted it
across the temple." This was considered a bad
omen for the tranquillity of the young princes'
reign, and was indeed fulfilled by the dissension

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

which raged between the royal brothers after the
death of their father.</p>

<p>This accident affected the mind of the superstitious 
calif in no ordinary degree. After the
completion of the ceremony, he retired from the
assembly, and having commanded that no one
should intrude upon his solitude, shut himself up
within his tent. The hour for the prayer of sunset 
passed, yet unmindful of the call of the muezzin, 
the Commander of the Faithful came not
forth to join, as was his custom, the public devotions 
in the mosque. The evening was well advanced, 
and his attendants were wondering at this
unusual seclusion of their monarch, when a man
presented himself before the royal tent, and demanded 
admission into the calif's presence. His
name was Jasser, and he bore the rank of an officer 
of the calif's guard. Mesrour, the chief of the
black eunuchs, who was there stationed, refused
his request with but little ceremony; and to the
plea that his business was pressing, replied, "The
old tale, Jasser, and one too common to pass with
me&mdash;it must wait, man&mdash;it must wait."</p>

<p>"I tell thee, Mesrour, my business will not wait,
without, it may be, sad detriment, such as thou
wouldst ill like to answer for."</p>

<p>"Were it the life of thy father, Jasser, I care
not. I would trouble the calif for no such matter.
He is gloomy and sad&mdash;disturbed, as I think, by
yonder pageant. Away, till morning&mdash;not for

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

thee, nor thy whole tribe, would I enter his presence 
till I am bidden."</p>

<p>"Far be it from a worm like me to think of life
or length of days, when the peace and honour of
my lord the calif are threatened; and no less a
matter is this. The danger be on my head if thou
admittest me&mdash;if not, be it transferred to thine."</p>

<p>"If thou art jesting, Jasser, thou hast chosen an
ill place and time. But if thy words are in serious
truth, I must perforce admit thee. But be advised; 
wait until the calif shall come forth. He
will then listen to thee with patience."</p>

<p>"On my head be it, Mesrour," exclaimed the
officer, pressing forward to obtain entrance. "I
tell thee, admit me quickly. I have that for the
calif's ear to which he would hearken were he
kneeling at the shrine of the Kaaba&mdash;though not
with patience, in truth."</p>

<p>"Enter then, since thou wilt not hear counsel,"
was Mesrour's reply; and stepping aside, he permitted 
Jasser to pass into the calif's presence.</p>

<p>Long was the interview between the Commander 
of the Faithful and the officer; and when
Haroun came forth, it was in furious mood. The
lamps which shone in front of the royal tent shed
but an imperfect light upon his countenance, but
when he spoke, his voice was tremulous with anger. 
"See that the slave be imprisoned!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And the child, my lord?" said the officer, laying 
his hand involuntarily upon his poniard.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

<p>"No, no, not as yet," was the answer of the
monarch; "let it be kept under strict guard, but
see that it is well cared for."</p>

<p>Jasser turned to depart, but the voice of Haroun
staid him. "Hear thee, Jasser, I have again
bethought me. Thou mayst deal with it as I at
first told thee, but not with steel&mdash;thou mayst
spill no such blood. The cord&mdash;and let it pass
quickly."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord," was the reply, and the soldier
hastily withdrew.</p>

<p>Haroun then approached the eunuch, and said,
"Mesrour, wake me at the earliest dawn, and
choose six well-appointed horsemen to attend me.
I take the road towards Bagdad."</p>

<p>"To hear, my lord, is to obey," replied the wondering 
Mesrour, and he turned to depart.</p>

<p>"Stay, Mesrour&mdash;hie thee after that man, and
tell him I revoke the order which I gave him.
Thou knowest not&mdash;bid him imprison and not slay.
Take my signet with thee."</p>

<p>Early on the following morning the calif, having
left the greater part of his train at Mecca, entered
upon the desert, followed only by Mesrour, Jasser,
and six chosen horsemen. In such haste did he
take his departure, that many things necessary for
their comfort and convenience upon the road were
forgotten. Their store of water and provisions
was inadequate to their wants; and although they
travelled with speed almost incredible, yet they
endured many hardships ere they emerged from

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

the sandy wastes of Arabia. For many days the
rare stream and scanty fruits were their only sustenance. 
Even these at last failed them, and the
hardiest of the calif's train with difficulty could
support themselves under their privations. Such,
however, was the tumult in the monarch's soul,
that he seemed insensible to corporeal sufferings.
At last they pressed too hard upon him. When
he contrasted his present condition with the pomp
and pleasure with which he had so lately crossed
the same road, he was overheard by Mesrour to
exclaim against the fickleness of fortune, and confess 
the weakness of his power, when in the hands
of the Most High.</p>

<p>When he had arrived at Anbar, a small town,
distant not many leagues from Bagdad, he halted;
and having informed himself of the state of his capital, 
sent an officer to arrest the Barmecides in
secret. On the following morning he despatched
a message to Prince Giafar, requiring his presence
at Anbar; then gave an order for his execution
into the hands of Jasser, upon whose cruel and ferocious 
temper he could depend; and having directed 
him to set forward upon the road to meet
the prince, after the return of his messenger, he
crossed the river, and proceeded to Bagdad.</p>

<p>The pitch of excitement to which the calif had
been wrought by the discovery which had been
made of the existence of the infant son of the
Prince Giafar and his daughter, at Mecca, had supported 
him under the many privations which he had

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

endured on his journey through the desert, and had
rendered him insensible to their severity. When,
however, the blow was struck which punished the
offending prince, and placed within his reach the
family of the culprit&mdash;when his mind had fallen
from that high tone to which it had been strung by
indignation and anxiety; then it was that he felt
their full effects upon his weakened and exhausted
frame. The sentence had been issued, and its execution 
intrusted to one, who, from his natural
sternness of character, and his known hostility to
the prince, would abate, in no degree, its harsh performance. 
Nothing now could save him who once
was as the light of his eyes, and as the lifeblood
that warmed his bosom. This thought weighed
heavily upon his spirit. He had, by one word, uprooted 
and torn away those ties which, like tendrils, 
fresh and green, had twined about his heart,
and had grown until they had fastened their roots
firmly in his bosom, and become like strong bands,
such as the massy oak sends deep into the soil. Yet
could that word be unspoken, could the decree return 
unexecuted into the hands of him who sent it
forth, it may be doubted whether anger, pride, and
unbending obstinacy, would not have forbidden its
recall.</p>

<p>He rode slowly and gloomily towards the city.
He spoke no word to his attendants, and even
Mesrour, who, since the disgrace of the Barmecides, 
had chiefly enjoyed his favour, could draw
from him no sign of recognition. His countenance

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

was haggard, and resembled that of one worn by
some painful disease or wearied with long watching. 
His frame seemed possessed of strength
scarce sufficient to support its weight in the saddle, 
and when their horses were urged to a rapid
pace, or moved over a rough and tortuous path, he
seemed to falter in his seat, and once or twice was
seen to bend forward, even to his saddle bow.</p>

<p>All Bagdad was in commotion. The Barmecides 
had been arrested, and it was rumoured that
they were to suffer the severest penalties of the calif's 
anger. Few, indeed, were there, whose hearts
were not chilled by this dreadful news. Groups
of citizens were collected together in the various
streets of the city, wondering, inquiring, and lamenting, 
as they heard of the meditated, but unmerited 
vengeance of the calif. " 'Tis the fatal cry
of the celestial camel,"<sup><a id="r017" href="#n017">17</a></sup> was heard passing from
mouth to mouth&mdash;that ominous sentence, expressive
to a Moslem of some general, some public calamity.
And such would be the ruin of the Barmecides;
noble, generous, and brave, they were the benefactors 
of the people, the pillars of the throne, and
there were none who could fill their place, either in
the service of the monarch, or the affections of his
subjects.</p>

<p>Making his hurried way through the assembled
crowds, was seen an aged Giaour. The marks of
aversion which all bestowed upon him were unheeded 
by the infidel, and he hastily urged his steps
towards that portion of the city which the calif was
about to enter. Once or twice he turned to those

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

near him, and addressed, as it seemed, some earnest 
interrogatory, but he received no reply, for
each, as he drew near, turned from the outcast in
abhorrence, and showered curses upon him as he
passed. Unimpeded, though repeatedly threatened, 
in his progress, the Giaour pressed forward
until he reached the more compact crowd, which
environed the immediate march of the Commander
of the Faithful. "Allah ackbar! God is great!"
he exclaimed, with strange inconsistency. "I am
not, then, too late!" Having thus said, he assayed
to force his way through the dense circle that separated 
him from the calif's person. At any other
time, his efforts, for this purpose, would have been
visited with summary and serious punishment, but
all were too busied, too deeply interested, in the
passing scene, to notice the intrusion.</p>

<p>The return of the calif was not welcomed, as
was their custom, by the joyful shouts and loud
acclamations of his subjects.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">                "No man cried, God save him!
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home!"</p>

</div>

<p>All were silent, a gloomy, wondering terror sat
upon the faces of all.</p>

<p>Yet the emotions which disturbed the bosom of
the monarch were of a nature so agitating and absorbing 
that he noticed nothing of this. He rode
along in profound silence, with his eyes fixed before 
him, upon the neck of his charger; and seemed
to be insensible whether he was passing through a

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

populous city, or still wandering upon the desert
road.</p>

<p>From this state of stupor he was suddenly
aroused by the Giaour, who, rushing from the
crowd, threw himself before his horse's feet, and in
a loud voice demanded a boon.</p>

<p>"What means this?" said the Commander of the
Faithful, turning to Mesrour, who rode nearest
him.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell, my lord," was the reply. "Let
the slave be driven from thy path."</p>

<p>"Nay, look upon me again, most mighty sovereign," 
exclaimed the Giaour, holding up to view a
costly ring&mdash;"dost thou not know me?"</p>

<p>The calif glared upon him for a moment; then,
as he recognised his features, he started, and replied, 
"Ay, I remember well! What wouldst
thou with me?"</p>

<p>"A boon&mdash;a promised boon!"</p>

<p>"It shall be thine. Mesrour, give him audience
on the morrow. Thou hast heard&mdash;stand from my
way."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;this moment&mdash;or it will be all too late!"
exclaimed the infidel, grasping his horse's bridle,
lest he should trample upon him, and with a strong
hand detaining the monarch from his path.</p>

<p>A strange sight was it to his wondering subjects,
to see the forbearance of the calif at this audacious
deed. They looked every moment to see his scimitar 
flashing from its sheath, and striking the bold
wretch to earth without delay. But Haroun was

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

like one in a dream. He seemed uncertain how to
act, and looked around, as though for advice and
assistance. In the twinkling of an eye, swords
were drawn, and voices were heard from the
crowd&mdash;"Strike the slave to earth. Cut the infidel 
in pieces. Away with the accursed dog." But
loud above all these arose the voice of the old man,
exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Pardon for the Prince Giafar!"</p>

<p>At these words all were hushed. The calif
reeled in his seat, as though he had received a stunning 
blow. Recovering himself in a moment, he
looked wildly around upon his train, and with a
hollow voice inquired,</p>

<p>"What said he?"</p>

<p>"Pardon for Giafar al Barmeki!" exclaimed the
Giaour.</p>

<p>"Well, it shall be so," he replied, in the same
strange tone; "let the prince be set at liberty."
Then, seeing the amazement and horror which
were depicted upon the countenances of his attendants, 
he exclaimed, "True&mdash;they have slain him!
Fool! thou hast come too late. He has been murdered!"</p>

<p>At this announcement the suppliant seemed overwhelmed, 
and a moment had passed ere he was 
able to say,</p>

<p>"The princess&mdash;thy daughter!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of her?"</p>

<p>"Spare <i>her</i> life."</p>

<p>"It is safe for thine entreaty; but never will I see

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

her, or call her daughter again. Why dost thou
linger? what more wouldst thou?"</p>

<p>"Pardon and safety for the Barmecides&mdash;the
innocent!"</p>

<p>"Not one of them," was the stern reply.
"Their very name shall perish. For <i>his</i> sake they
should all have lived; but I will not endure their
sight, no, nor the mention of the name, since <i>he</i> is
dead. Mesrour, to thee I give the execution of
the sentence, and with thy head shalt thou answer
for its fulfilment. Let the chiefs of the family be
imprisoned, and, for the rest, let all that bear the
name be driven into exile; let their goods be confiscated, 
their dwellings razed to the ground, and
threaten with death those who shall dare hereafter
to breathe the name of their race." At the hearing
of this command, so stern and so unjust, a murmur
ran through the crowd which served to increase
the ire of the calif. Indeed, he seemed to be lashing 
himself into fury, as though the workings of
indignation might drown in his bosom emotions
that were far more torturing.</p>

<p>The boldness of the fire worshipper seemed foolhardiness 
to those that heard him, when he thus
addressed the calif,</p>

<p>"Unjust and cruel prince! how wilt thou answer 
to the all-wise Allah, for the abuse of that
power with which he has intrusted thee? Thou
wilt one day tremble before his throne when thou
art questioned of thine office!"</p>

<p>It was evidently a sore trial of the calif's

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

patience to listen to so severe a reproof from a
despised infidel. He did so, however, his fingers
during the while grasping and straining his sword
hilt, until the Giaour had concluded. Then his
blade was in an instant unsheathed, and spitting
upon the ground in token of abhorrence, he exclaimed, 
as the weapon flashed aloft,</p>

<p>"Dog! dost thou profane with thine unhallowed
lips the name of the Most High?"</p>

<p>But ere the blow had fallen, the old man had
thrown aside his unhallowed garb, and the calif's
arm was arrested in mid air; for, instead of belted
Gheber, stood before him, clothed in the garments
of a sheik, the revered and sainted Ibrahim.</p>

<p>"What mystery, what magic is this?" exclaimed
Haroun.</p>

<p>"No magic, my lord," replied the dervis; "and
the mystery is easily explained. Years have
passed away since I first entered thy dominions,
wearing the weeds which I have just cast aside.
In that garb I plunged beneath the waves, and
redeemed from their depths thy long-lost treasure.
Having thrown aside the garments of a Giaour
while beneath the waters, and having cleansed my
face from the filth and impurities with which I had
disguised my features, I reappeared to your eyes
robed as a dervis. Do not refuse belief&mdash;to one
who had been unequalled as a diver in the gulf of
Ormus, this deed were easy of performance."</p>

<p>"But thy words, as thou gavest me the ring?

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

That warning&mdash;whence came it? How fearfully
has it been fulfilled!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless from Heaven, my lord, for I know
not why I uttered it. But avert the evil which
yet thou mayst. Forget not that thy promise is
given. Spare, oh spare the Barmecides!"</p>

<p>"Thou hast thy boon, old man. Abassa, her,
who was a princess and my daughter, thou hast
preserved from a doom as terrible as that which
has fallen upon her guilty, her ungrateful husband."</p>

<p>"If not for thy word's sake, in justice, in mercy,
for the sake of thy soul's welfare, punish not the
innocent."</p>

<p>"Thou talkest in vain," was the stern reply.
"Allah alone can avert their fate. I have spoken.
Pass to thy solitude&mdash;forget this world. More
than mortal, thou hast detached thyself from its
enjoyments; why, then, shouldst thou burden thyself
with the sorrows that mingle here? Thou art
self-denying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me not so," interrupted the dervis. "It
is thou, rather, that shouldst merit this name. I
have indeed given up the things of this world,
which are of no value, but thou deniest thyself
those which are inestimable&mdash;the blessings of
eternity."</p>

<p>"Leave, then, learned sage," said the Commander 
of the Faithful, unmoved, "the things of
this life, which thou hast resigned, to one who has
yet an interest in them. They will but distract

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

thy mind from heaven. Depart to thy cell. Betake 
thyself to prayer and penance. Thou hast
mine answer. Stay me no longer; it is in vain."</p>

<p>The sage buried his face in his robe, and the
proud but unhappy monarch passed on.</p>

<p>Anxious to learn the first tidings of Giafar's fate,
the old man retired without the gate of the city,
and there awaited the return of the officer who
had been intrusted with the execution of the prince.
Long he tarried, looking earnestly across the plain
which stretched itself to the south of the city, until
the sun had reached the edge of the horizon; when,
afar off upon the road, he perceived a cloud of dust.
It approached, and a horseman, yes, two, are seen
urging their steeds rapidly towards Bagdad.</p>

<p>"Is he alive? Can it be? Allah is merciful!"
exclaimed the sage, in trembling accents.</p>

<p>In a few moments, to his indescribable joy, the
dervis recognised the form and features of Giafar;
and now they thunder by him into the city. The
prince was unarmed, his garments soiled and
dusted, his face pale, and he noticed not the good
man as he passed him on his way to the royal
palace. Uttering aloud his exclamations of delight,
the dervis turned and hastily followed them.</p>

<p>With a ray of hope yet glimmering in his bosom,
Giafar, accompanied by the executioner, had urged
his horse in haste over the plain. The one upon
which the officer was mounted had been ridden
hard, and being unable to endure the rapid pace
at which they spurred along, had fallen through

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

fatigue. Some time elapsed ere his place could be
supplied; yet, notwithstanding this occurrence, by
dint of great exertion they had been enabled to
reach Bagdad ere sunset. They rode into the
city without abating their speed, and turned their
course towards the mansion of the calif. When
there, they dismounted, and Jasser with the prince
ascended side by side the palace steps. At the
door of the apartment where the calif was sitting
they paused, and Giafar, turning without apparent
emotion to his stern companion, said,</p>

<p>"Enter, and tell him that my head is without."</p>

<p>Jasser entered the calif's presence, and the
prince, listening with dreadful interest, awaited the
result without. After the entrance of the officer,
there was a momentary silence, which was broken
by the voice of the Commander of the Faithful.</p>

<p>"Thou art returned, then, Jasser?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am here, my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Have my commands been obeyed?"</p>

<p>"They have, may it please the Commander of
the Faithful; the head is without."</p>

<p>Naught but the imagination can depict the intense 
and agonizing emotion with which Giafar
awaited the calif's reply. To his attentive ear,
there is a tremour in his voice, which causes him to
tremble with hope. It is not his master's&mdash;he
would not know it for his. Yet a moment wait.
There spake the calif&mdash;that is the monarch's voice,
clear as in the hour of battle. Its dreadful intonations 

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

fell like ice upon the warm bosom of the
prince.</p>

<p>"Thou hast well done, Jasser. Bring it to me."</p>

<p>Does the earth rock, or is it fancy? No! to
the senses of the unhappy Giafar, the fabric of all
human things is tottering from its base. At the
rude voice of his master, hope flies away, and death,
with all its bitterness, enters his soul. He lays
aside his turban, he gathers his garments about
him, he kneels, and bares his neck for the executioner. 
Confused sounds, as of many waters, fill
his ears; light flashes across his eyes; he can see
nothing&mdash;he can hear noth&mdash; Listen! 'tis his
name! Again! 'Tis Azrael!&mdash;'tis the angel of
death, and thrice he calls on Giafar. His hour is
come!</p>

<p>At this moment the dervis, who had just gained
the palace, came hastily forward, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Forbear! Stay thine hand! There is yet
pardon&mdash;"there is yet life for him."</p>

<p>"Away!" replied the sanguinary Jasser, "Hinder 
me not in mine office."</p>

<p>The old man rushed into the calif's presence;
but the scimitar descended quickly. Impelled by
envy, hatred, and ambition, it fell, severing with its
merciless edge the neck of the unfortunate and
accomplished prince. 'Tis over, and Abassa is
alone. Her name, and his God's, were the last
words upon his lips. May he dwell with them for
ever. May his feet stand firm upon that perilous
bridge, which stretches its narrow and dangerous

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

passage over the abyss of darkness. Let no storm
sweeping wildly across that vast country whither
he has gone, hurry him from the path which leads
to paradise, but, angel led, may he find that blessed
abode, regain his deserted one, and be at peace!
And shall he not? If he has prayed, or given
alms, or performed any good work, has not the
angel that stands ever at his right hand, written it
down ten times?<sup><a id="r018" href="#n018">18</a></sup> If he has sinned, by the kind
providence of Allah for seven hours must the evil
spirit wait, ere he can record it; for peradventure
he may pray, or ask pardon.</p>

<p class="stanza">            And back upon thyself revolves
The pains, the sufferings, all the deadly tortures
Which thou hast brought on others.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Tragedy of Orre</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Commander of the Faithful had retired 
to his palace, after his encounter with the
hermit Ibrahim, he bitterly repented the precipitation 
with which he had urged the execution of his
once-loved favourite. Here had occurred an opportunity 
for compromising with his anger and
pride, nay, even a necessity to pardon, in redemption 
of plighted promise. But it came all too late.
The minister of death had departed, the sentence
was in his hand, and probably had by that time
been executed.</p>

<p>Regret was unavailing, and its manifestation
unworthy the dignity of his character. After his
mind had recovered from that state of prostration
and stupor, into which, from various causes, it had
been thrown, nothing in the deportment of the calif
displayed the remorse which was rending his
bosom. His countenance was unmoved, and his
voice firm. 'Tis true, at the entrance of the messenger 
of justice, when he first inquired after the
fate of the prince, anxiety predominated slightly

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

over his self-possession, showed itself in his face,
and agitated his voice with that tremour, which
lighted up a fleeting and vain hope in the then
living bosom of Giafar. This emotion, however,
passed in an instant, when Jasser announced to him
that the deed was done&mdash;that the fate of his victim
was sealed. He appeared well satisfied that his
commands had been obeyed, and awaited, with an
inward shuddering, the officer's return with the
head. At that instant, a voice and the hasty step
of feet were heard without, and the dervis rushed
in wild haste into the apartment, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"He is alive!&mdash;he is without! Speak but a
word, and save him!"</p>

<p>The calif rose in trembling agitation, and would
have spoken aloud, but ere the words of mercy had
passed his lips, a sound was heard, which in an
instant sealed them. It was the dull sweep of the
steel as it passed across the neck of the victim, telling 
harshly of his fate. Then the aged Ibrahim,
overcome with horror, rending his robe, bowed
down upon his face and wept aloud. Then the
calif knew that all was over&mdash;that his friend had
suffered even at his doors, almost in his presence,
when a word, nay, the very sound of his voice,
would have sufficed to save him. The trial was
too terrific. He grasped his beard with an unconscious 
hand, plucking up his sable hairs by the
roots, and sank back in horror upon the divan from
whence he had arisen. The scream of anguish
from which he with difficulty refrained, was suppressed 

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

into a stifled groan; and wafted across the
apartment, seemed like the echo of the murdered
Giafar's death sigh. But, in truth, no such sound
of terror came from the prince's lips, even when
the steel was doing its work upon him; and tenfold 
more than his sufferings, was that which it
inflicted upon the heart of the listening, living
calif.</p>

<p>The exertion of all his self-command was insufficient 
to enable Haroun to endure with dignity
and calmness the presence of Jasser, when he returned 
bearing in his right hand the prince's head,
yet warm and dripping with blood. He turned
his eyes from the horrid spectacle, and said in
a whisper, every syllable of which was distinctly
audible, "How is this?&mdash;the head yet wet!&mdash;when
was this done?"</p>

<p>"But now, my lord, without the door of the
apartment," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Why thus in my very presence?" asked the
calif.</p>

<p>"It was at the request of the prince himself, my
lord," said the officer, "that it was thus delayed."</p>

<p>"Why?&mdash;for what purpose?"</p>

<p>"He hoped that my lord the calif would relent
from his anger, and regret his death, when he
heard that the sentence against him had been executed."</p>

<p>"Fool! fool!&mdash;he should have known his master 
better. Let it suffice;" and with his face buried 
in his hands, the calif remained silent. After

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

an abstraction of some moments, he raised his
head, and seeing Jasser yet standing in his presence, 
he said, "What dost thou here?"</p>

<p>"I await thine orders, my lord, respecting the
body of the prince."</p>

<p>"Ah, true!" ejaculated the monarch, shuddering. 
"Call Mesrour and Ahmed," The officer
obeyed.</p>

<p>Upon their entrance, Haroun, with his face
averted in abhorrence, pointed to Jasser, and exclaimed, 
"There&mdash;that wretch!&mdash;strike off his
head.<sup><a id="r019" href="#n019">19</a></sup> I cannot bear in my presence the murderer
of Giafar." The command was executed immediately; 
and by an order equally arbitrary and unjust, 
the vindictive Jasser suffered the same fate
which he had just inflicted upon the innocent
prince.</p>

<p>Night was now beginning to cover the day with
her sable mantle, and the monarch went forth.
As he crossed the threshold, he started aside like
a frighted steed, that swerves from the path at
some sudden object of terror. The ready hand of
an attendant of the palace had thrown a cloth of
white linen over the body of the beheaded prince,
but the form, the posture, and above all, the spouted 
gore that stained the spot, told the calif what
rested beneath that shroud of white. He hurried
on, anxious to escape from a scene of such horror,
and the following day saw the Commander of the
Faithful far from Bagdad.</p>

<p>Many months elapsed ere he returned to his

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

capital. When he did so, his first and melancholy
duty was to cause the severed members of the
prince's body to be taken from the walls of the
city, where, as was the custom, they had been exposed. 
They were carefully interred, and the
tears of the repentant monarch and sorrowing
friend were poured freely upon his grave. It was
made in his gardens by the swift river. There
a mound of earth, at the head of which stood a
turban rudely carved in stone, for a long time told
the spot where rested the remains of the vizier
Giafar.</p>

<p>During the calif's absence, the sentence against
the Barmecides had been rigidly executed. Iahia
and his three sons were confined in a narrow
prison, where they lingered until death released
them from their sorrow. The sons, young and
vigorous, struggled long with their sufferings; but
their aged father, overcome with grief, soon sank
under the weight of his misfortunes. After his
death a paper was found in his bosom, containing
the following sentence: "The accused goes before&mdash;the 
accuser will soon follow&mdash;both to appear
before that Judge with whom legal forms and
writings will avail nothing." "The calif," says
the historian, "could not read it without tears."</p>

<p>The entire family was banished into the remote
provinces of Persia; and though after the death of
Haroun al Raschid many of them returned to
Bagdad, yet it was to revisit, in a state of the most
miserable poverty, the scene of their former magnificence. 

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

Various and interesting are the tales
which are related of the return of individuals of
that unfortunate family, and of the gratitude and
kindness with which they were often received by
those who had once been dependants upon their
bounty. Thus passed the race. Yet notwithstanding 
the stern decree of their destroyer, their
name was long in the mouths, and their memory
in the hearts, of the Persians.<sup><a id="r020" href="#n020">20</a></sup> Many poets have
found ample theme for song in the history of their
virtues and their misfortunes. Their prosperity
was unexampled in the annals of the nation; for
with their power they preserved the affections of
the people. Their fall was terrible; a memorable
instance of the instability of worldly happiness.</p>

<p>"<i>Nursling of fortune</i>," says an Eastern poet,
"<i>thou who suckest the milk of prosperity from her
impoisoned breasts, boast not thyself too much of
the happiness of thy condition, while thou art still
in the cradle of life, suspended and tottering. Bethink 
thyself of the time when thou hast seen the
grandeur of the Barmecides</i>."</p>

<p class="stanza">"But is not thy bright home sad to thee?
Can another world give bliss
Dearer than our love in this?
Dost thou not sigh in thy bower for me?</p>

I left my father's halls for thee:
Death for thy sake is sweet to me;
Our love was formed for eternity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exiled</span> remotely, the once beautiful Abassa
passed the short remainder of her life. From the
first burst of grief and horror which overwhelmed
her, when she heard of her husband's unhappy fate,
she gradually settled into a state of quiet, but
heart-corroding sorrow. The return of the old dervis, 
that brought her news of the prince's death,
also announced to her the sentence of banishment
which her father had pronounced against herself.
But the blow had fallen that had crushed her happiness&mdash;to 
all grief that might follow she was insensible. 
This life was banishment to her. The
world one place of exile. Her refuge was heaven,
her home was there, and there, awaiting her, as he
had said, was her lord. In parting with her sad
mother, she evinced no sorrow; and the weeping

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

Zobeide wondered to see her daughter so calm, yet
comfortless.</p>

<p>A few drops of comfort that assuaged, in some
degree, her woe, were shed upon her bosom by the
presence and kindness of the good Ibrahim. He had
left the quiet of his hermitage, and accompanying
the princess in her banishment, devoted himself to
what he thought the only duty which remained to
him on earth&mdash;to comfort his beloved pupil and mistress. 
For a few years he took off part of the burden 
which weighed upon her heart. At last, however, 
his faculties fast decayed. His eyes grew dim
and thickly glazed. His ear, upon which fell with
delight the voice of Abassa, closed to all sound.
His voice lost its silvery clearness, and became
thick and impeded in its utterance. Tired with
the toils of life, a sweet sleep came upon the old
man; yet, though paradise proffered to him its rest,
he would have waked longer, and still watched
over the happiness of his princess.</p>

<p>Not long tarried behind the lone Abassa. After
the loss of the good dervis she quickly drooped.
Like a weak flower, that has lost its sole support,
she yielded to the weight of her sorrows. Unknown
hands bore her to the tomb, and none strewed flowers 
o'er her grave, save a favourite slave, who gave
that affecting testimony to the virtues of her mistress.</p>

<p>It is not thus we would recount her funeral obsequies. 
Friends in ready alternation, with hurried
steps, should have borne her to the grave. The

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

low, sweet chant of the muezzin, telling that a
princess has departed, and the quick tramp of a
long train of mourners, should have sounded in the
"Cities of Silence." Bagdad's fairest daughters
should have hung garlands upon her tomb. But
she died in a land unknown, and unbeloved. Harsh
tyranny cast its wintry blight upon her&mdash;and
"Persia's Rose" sleeps unlamented, far from the
palace of her sires. There the thorn, the willow,
and the cypress, form a gloomy, yet sacred shade;
and the rose and sweet briar are creeping in wild
luxuriance over her neglected grave.</p>

<p>We have related her sad story with a heavy
heart. We have attended her trembling steps
along a rough and weary way, till they have led
her to the tomb; and it is with feelings of relief,
mingled with regret, that we leave her to rest
sweetly, in its deep and enduring stillness. She
has lingered full long alone amid her sorrows, and
a kind welcome awaits her whither she has gone.
Why grieve, then, at death, if happiness comes hand
in hand with the stern visitant? Why shield the
bosom from the stroke, when peace flies winged
upon the welcome dart? Yet has she fallen early&mdash;fallen 
young&mdash;ere youth had thrown its warm
garment fully upon her, its livery of beauty and of
love. The roses upon her cheek were too fresh
so soon to fade; her bosom was too young and
warm to grow thus early cold. They may not
murmur to depart, who have passed the meridian
of life, or declined well down its vale. They have

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

eaten and drunk; they have had their portion;
they must soon look for the end. "Privileged
guests, they cannot always be seated at the board."
But to be called away when the alarm is ringing
to the feast, or when the sweet viands are half
tasted; when flowers are in the path, but none are
gathered; when the cup is filling; when love and
beauty are dawning in their earliest and brightest
hues; when life is so dear&mdash;when it is young.</p>

<p>Weep for her, ye maidens, who are yourselves
thus blithe, and thus attached to this sweet world.
Weep for her, ye in years, if ye have a young
friend that ye fear to lose, or the memory of one
already gone. Weep for her, ye youth, if ye love
one like her, and tremble for her safety; or if,
grieving for the past, ye cherish the sweet image
of the departed. Yet mourn not over long, either
for your own griefs, or for the fate of this unfortunate. 
Happiness, doubtless, has many a home
besides this earth. Shall not those, then, that have
departed, of a surety find it?</p>

not rare in oriental history. It is related of Aba Taher, a Carmathian 
chief, that having made an inroad into Persia, even to the
gates of Bagdad, with no more than 500 horse, and being summoned 
by an officer from Abussage, the general of the Calif Moctader, 
to surrender, he demanded of the messenger how many
troops his master had with him. The officer replied, "Thirty
thousand." Abu Taher then made answer, "There are yet wanting
to him three such men as mine." Whereupon having commanded
three of his followers into his presence, he ordered the first to
plunge a poniard into his throat, the second to cast himself headlong 
into the Tigris, and the third to leap from a precipice. His
orders were instantly obeyed. The Carmathian then turned to
the officer, and said, "He who has such soldiers counts not the
number of his enemies. For thyself I offer thee good quarter;
but thou shalt soon see Abussage thy general chained among my
dogs." This threat was fulfilled.&mdash;<i>See D'Herbelot</i>.</p>

first of the Arabian prophets. In the midst of a pagan festival,
at Higjeaz, he caused a female camel, with her young one, to
come forth from the bowels of a dense rock, which prodigy effected
the conversion of a great number of idolaters. A little time after,
however, they returned to their errors, and Ahmer-Semoud had
the impiety to hamstring the camel, whose cries, together with
those of her young, brought down upon them the anger of God.
A fearful voice was heard over all Arabia, which struck with
death all the tribe of Semoud&mdash;a name since held in horror among
the Arabians. Since that time public disasters are always announced 
by these words: "It is the fatal cry of the celestial
camel."&mdash;<i>See D'Ohsson</i>.</p>

<p><a id="n018" href="#r018">18.</a> It is an article of Mohammedan belief, that
every man is accompanied through life by a good and evil angel.
They have also a tradition, that the angel who notes a man's
good actions, has the command over him who notes his evil actions; 
and when a man does a good action, the angel at his right
hand writes it down ten times, and when he commits an ill action, 
the same angel says to the angel on the left hand, "Forbear
setting it down for seven hours; peradventure he may pray, or
ask pardon."&mdash;<i>Sale's Koran</i>.</p>

<p><a id="n019" href="#r019">19.</a> The death of Jasser, the executioner of the
prince, is thus related by D'Herbelot.</p>

<p><a id="n020" href="#r020">20.</a> We read in the same author, upon whom we
have drawn so largely for our facts, that the Calif Haroun forbade,
on pain of death, that any person should make mention of the
family. Notwithstanding this decree, an aged man named Mondir 
was accustomed to place himself before one of their houses
which had been abandoned, and mounting upon a heap of earth,
which served him as a sort of tribune or desk, he entertained the
passers by with a recital of the noble actions of the family of the
Barmecides, making at the same time their formal panegyric.
The calif, having heard of the boldness of this man, ordered him
into his presence, and condemned him to death for having disobeyed 
his commands. Mondir received his sentence with a
smile, and only requested that he might be heard by the calif, before
the execution should take place. This favour having been granted
him, he made a long discourse, in which he related with much
force the obligations under which he lay to the family of the Barmecides. 
The calif, who had listened patiently, was moved by
his words, and not only pardoned him, but presented him with a
vase of gold which lay upon the table. Having received this
present from the hands of Haroun, after having prostrated himself 
at his feet, according to the usage of the court, the old man
exclaimed, "Behold yet another favour which I receive at the
hands of the Barmecides!" "These words of Mondir," continues 
our author, "have since passed into a proverb throughout
Asia."</p>
