<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THIS book is founded upon an original drama,
written and printed for private circulation by the
author in 1863. The novel itself has been written
some five years. The title only is of more recent
date. On the occasion of the Farewell Dinner given
to the late CHARLES DICKENS, of whom all eulogy in
these pages is felt to be superfluous, he used these
words: "I am SO VERY HUMAN!" The author trusts
that in adopting this expression as the title of his
work, he has done no wrong to the memory of that
great artist and genial man. He is conscious of having
attempted to deal with a difficult and delicate subject;
but he also trusts that the spirit in which it is
treated will be considered an ample justification.</p>

<p>One word with regard to the Lawyers. As the
author has said, there is nothing personal, nothing
pointed at individuals, in this book. If he could, without
offence, name some, who are exempt from the
sweeping charges he has directed against a system,
he would do so. There are solicitors whom he
regards with feelings of friendship, gratitude, and

<!-- vol 1 page viii -->

esteem. Next to these he has been most condemnatory
of the Police. There are many admirable
men in that Force, whose merits shine the
brighter for the difficulties and temptations surrounding
them. Some of the superintendents and
inspectors are worthy of the highest praise. Some
of the ordinary constables display great forbearance
and kindness, and are not less efficient on that account.
The writer wishes to see the Police better
paid, and chosen invariably from a better class of
men. Moreover, he has reason to believe that many
of the duties imposed upon the Police are most repugnant
to them, as for instance the hoop crusade,
and the late illegal attack upon the match-makers'
procession. The Police should not be centralised, nor
organised as an army in our midst. They should be
under local supervision and restraint. And above all,
those who take the night charges should, he ventures
to suggest, not belong to the Force, but be appointed
by the rate-payers. The author merely mentions
these things to show that he is not animated by a
mere blind fury against the guardians of order, but
would ameliorate their condition as the first step
towards the social improvement he is desirous should
take place. As it is, the seeds of revenge and hatred
are widely sown by the tyrannical interference with
the small traffic of the poor, and the constant refrain
of the pitiless "Move on." Since these pages
were written, how many illustrations of the evils, which
he has reprehended and pictured, have forced themselves
upon the unwilling attention of the public.</p>

<p>There is one thing which may possibly be deemed

<!-- vol 1 page ix -->

a mere author's invention, namely, the sudden blindness
of Blanche Aubrey, and her as sudden recovery
of sight. This is not the case: similar examples
might easily be quoted. A friend writing to the
author from Pesth, some time after the play was
printed, mentioned as an incident which had excited
singular interest in that city, the case of a young and
beautiful married lady, possessed of rare accomplishments
and well-known in Society, who suddenly lost
her sight without any apparent reason, and as suddenly,
after several months, recovered it. A late
suicide of a married lady of wealth and position in
New York, bears a striking resemblance to the attempted
act of Blanche, both in its causes and the
actual features of the act. Lastly, if it is considered
that there is a tinge of superstition, <i>infra gli
altri difetti del libretto</i>, especially with regard to
dreams, presentiments, coincidences, and the like,
the author pleads the example of the greatest men
who have not been able to refuse their credence
to that which philosophy cannot fathom. Who is
able even to define dreams? <i>'Ονέιρατα τά σκοτίας τέκνα,
θάυματοστε νεφέλαι φρενός μὲν σκιάι του φόβου μελαγχιτὢνες
ἄγγελοι, φωτὸς δε ὀυ πολλάκις ἐυάγγελοι πάρεισι φιλοι.</i></p>

<p>THE DENIZENS OF THE WELL.</p>

<p class="small"><b>Prologue&mdash;Apologue.</b></p>

</div>

<p>"EFTSOONS," quoth the Newt, "we shall be
thrown upon the bounty of an unfeeling world; for
the well is certainly getting dry. I shall look out
for a situation in an aquarium, which I am told is
the best thing going for a person of my brilliant
colour, elegant form, and engaging manners."</p>

<p>The Frog said, "I shall give an operatic entertainment,
with the assistance of the numerous and
talented Tadpole family. I shall engage Mlle. Souris
Chantante of the principal theatres at home and
abroad. We will perform 'Le Lac des Grenouilles,'
and 'Le Vieux Rat Polisson,' 'Opera bouffe,' in
two acts. My cousin, Herr Bullfrog, will be the
conductor, I know."</p>

<p>"And I," said the Toad, "who am not so personally
attractive as you others, must, I fear, finally
retire from the world altogether, and betake myself
to the silent system of conventual obscurity in the

<!-- vol 1 page xii -->

centre of some huge stone. But, before doing so,
I will pawn the precious jewel of adversity, which I
still wear in my head. Can any one tell me where I
am likely to get the most money advanced upon it?"</p>

<p>The Newt shook his head, and the Frog croaked a
bar from Verdi's "I Lombardi," in a gay and even
insulting tone. It was evident that they had no
respect for an old lady's misfortunes reduced to so
contemptible a shift.</p>

<p>The Little Fish said nothing; perhaps he had
nothing to say. At all events, he could not say it,
if he had; for he was not a "talking fish." But
he thought, that when the last drop of water should
fail, he would certainly die a miserable death, and he
silently gasped "a prayer for rain," and commended
himself to the mercy of an all-wise and all-powerful
Providence.</p>

<p>While the Newt, the Frog, and the Toad were
thus closely communing together, there came by
some mischievous boys, and one of them spying the
Toad (for the Frog crept nimbly aside, and the Newt
crept into a crevice), threw a heavy brick, which
appeared to crush her entirely. They then went on
their way, laughing and whooping, to school. The
Frog and Newt came out, after the sound of the
urchins' voices had died away, and recommenced their
conversation.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected," said the Frog. "A fit
ending to such an ugly, slow, useless old thing. I
always said she would come to grief with that wonderfully
'precious jewel' of hers, of which she was
continually prating."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page xiii -->

"I can assure you," observed, in turn, the Newt,
"that I for one never thought her other than a complete
nuisance and a bore. I am glad, for my part,
that the nasty, spiteful, venomous hag is gone. Some
folks are not fit to live. It's lucky that we are going
to move, for her remains will certainly poison the
well."</p>

<p>This character given to the Toad was neither charitable
nor fair; for she was a harmless, obese person,
who never did any one any injury in her life. We
are happy to record, that she was only inconvenienced
for a few years until the well was cleared out, when
she obtained her liberty.</p>

<p>At that moment a shadow darkened the speakers
and their abode. Down came a long-necked heron
with heavy flapping wings, and the Newt, having
crawled at the moment three parts up the side of the
well, which, to say sooth, was not very deep, was
improved off the earth in a twinkling, and carried
wriggling in mid-air to be swallowed at leisure as a
bonne bouche and alterative by the lordly fowl.</p>

<p>As soon as the Frog had recovered from this
second alarm, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, he's gone, and perhaps it's all for the best;
for there will be all the more water here, until I have
completed my arrangements. Besides, I never could
really esteem such a crawling style of friend. How
about the aquarium now? But I never believed that
any of those disgusting mortals, idiots as they are,
could be so ridiculous as to found a hospital for
him."</p>

<p>Back came the urchins from school. They had got

<!-- vol 1 page xiv -->

a half-holiday, and approaching the well stealthily,
they peeped into it again to see if there was any
more fun. The Frog was so busy reckoning up the
bad qualities of the Newt, and considering the improbability
that, had he lived, any one could have been
found to do anything for such an elongated pretender,
he did not perceive his danger until it was too late.
He was literally caught on the hop, and the boys who
could not reach him otherwise, cruelly flogged him
to death with some boughs which they had picked up
on the road.</p>

<p>The Little Fish only remained. You can imagine
what a stew he was in. He nearly swooned outright,
when the idlest urchin caught him in an improvised
hand-net made of a dirty pocket-handkerchief tied to
the forked ends of a stick, and put him into a small
green can.</p>

"This monster will certainly boil me," thought the
Little Fish. But the can was furnished with air-holes,
and the Little Fish breathed more freely through
his gills than he had done for some time; and he
again commended himself to the will of Providence,
with but slender and fishy hope, it must be owned.
Presently the boys took him to a beautiful large pond,
and put the can into the water. They amused themselves
for some time with looking at the behaviour
of the Little Fish, who lay still at the very bottom of
the can, awaiting his fate. At length one boy pushed
the other, and they soused the can somewhat deeper
in the water than they intended. It was a grand
opportunity for the Little Fish. Out he shot with a
whisk of his tail, and darted like an arrow into the

<!-- vol 1 page xv -->

deep recesses of the pond, where he met with a
number of companions, to whom he modestly narrated
his escape&mdash;of course merely by dumb show,
after the manner of fish, <i>&agrave; la</i> fin, as we might say.</p>

<p>He told his tale so often, and was so f&ecirc;ted and
flattered on account of his presence of mind and
daring (as if he had any of the latter, poor little
fellow!) that at length he grew extremely conceited
and proud. He thought that his wonderful escape
was all owing to his own cleverness and resources.
As he was boasting of these one day as usual, quite
forgetful of all around save his immediate admirers,
a huge Pike, who had marked him for an easy prey,
made one rush at him, and swallowed him up, story,
vain-glory, arrogance, ingratitude, and all, and he was
no more seen among fish.</p>

<p>"De nobis fabella narratur!" It is thus with
men. "L'homme propose et Dieu dispose." Of
course we should make a good use of our opportunities,
when they are sent by an Almighty hand.
To-day the poor man gets a living, to-morrow
the rich man fails. But whatever we may do,
or whatever may be done with us against and
above our will, be assured that we can count on
nothing for certain; that the finest schemes may be
crushed, and the poorest, and humblest, and smallest
creatures swim, while the jaws of Fate are always
agape to swallow the insane boaster, who deems himself
so clever, that he can afford to be forgotten of
Heaven.</p>

<p>But the truth is, neither Heaven forgets, nor the
Evil One, who hovers between earth and sky, or lies

<!-- vol 1 page xvi -->

concealed in the rushes of the deep waters. It is
better to live even in shallows, if you put your trust
above, than to disport amid the treasure-chambers
of ocean itself, without gratitude to the Divine mercy,
and devoid of constant faith.</p>

<p>IT was nearly twelve o'clock on a wet and windy
night in London, in the month of August, 18&mdash;,
and but few were out who could help it in that
usually popular thoroughfare, the Strand. We might
occupy pages in describing, after the school of the
inimitable Mr. Dickens, what a wet night in London
is; but then we could not do it like him; and as many

of our readers live in London, most of them have been
there, and in foul weather too: and, finally, as all
of them live somewhere, and have probably seen some
town or other on a rainy night, and therefore need
only imagine a larger town, a dingier atmosphere,
more wet, and wider discomfort, in order to picture
to themselves London on such an occasion, we shall
not attempt to furnish a word-photograph of the
scene, however well or indifferently it might be executed.
A young gentleman of "fashionable and
prepossessing appearance," so far as one could judge
of him, who had just issued from his chambers in
Garden-court, Temple, was proceeding westward at
a rapid pace on his way to one of his clubs, the
Kemble. He paused at a cab-stand near St. Clement's
Church, and looked hard at the dripping
drivers without eliciting a movement on the part of
one of them; and so apparently altered his mind,
and determined to walk, although unfurnished with
an umbrella, an article which we may mention <i>en
passant</i> he very seldom, if ever, carried. Inky spots
from the dye of his hat already began to drip upon
his nose; but he cared nought for the rain, and
thought, probably, if he thought anything about the
matter, as follows: "The cabs there are nearly all
Hansoms, and the seats are, doubtless, damp, if not
sodden with wet; and as for that solitary four-wheeler, 
the prospect of turning poor cabby out
of his sleeping berth is certainly not inviting. He
is slumbering with the windows shut, and the reek
of mouldy capes, coarse tobacco, and onions, would
be overpowering, as soon as one could sufficiently

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

arouse the wretched being to cause him to tumble
forth mechanically, and mount his wet box, in a state
of blasphemous, vehicular, sixpence-a-mile somnambulism. 
Poor devil! Let him sleep, and dream of
a gorgeous paradise of gin-palaces, where all the
fares are on a reckless scale of Haymarket-to-Cremorne 
extravagance, where even cherubs are counted
in as extra passengers, and policemen and summonses 
are unheard of and unknown." Such in
reality was his train of thought as he took stock of
the cabs on the stand by St. Clement's Church, and
sturdily concluded to walk on. The theatres had
just closed, and no shops were open, save those
sacred to coffee, eel-pies, china bowls full of green
apples stuck in the window, shell-fish, and tobacco.
Our hero had passed Goodwin's, that still even then
celebrated, dingy oyster-warehouse, where some
of the choicest spirits of the age have sat far into
the morning&mdash;the old "Chronicle" men, when it
was a newspaper, Charles Dickens, Douglas Jerrold,
the lamented Thackeray, and how many more?
Perhaps, such a place was hardly ever graced with so
goodly a company as might be constituted of the
various literary, journalistic, legal, and parliamentary
celebrities whom we have seen there. Truly, a
strange dirt-begrimed retreat, open till any hour of
the morning, and now shut up, at any rate as an
intellectual resort, for ever and a night. What has
not been penned and planned there? What flowers of
thought, and wit, and fancy have not wreathed that
rickety parlour, together with its dense cigar-smoke,
until it was as richly decked, at least in imagination,

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

as a bower of the Muses and Apollo, ornamented by
the hands of the goddess Flora herself? Dear old
Chlo&euml; and neat-handed Phyllis, jealous of the comforts, 
as of the attentions and demands of your separate
respective customers and favourites, were ye not
also there, nimble of tongue and frying-pan, ready
of gridiron and repartee, and jokes and songs? How
strong-minded and man-like you had become through
constant chatting with your guests on equal, nay, sometimes 
superior, terms! How well do we remember
when the stout old mother sat knitting in that sacred
back-parlour, and the thin old father reading his
newspaper when his day's out-door business was
done, while the daughters cooked for, talked to,
quizzed and rallied authors and journalists, politicians 
in and out of parliament, artists, philosophers,
and wits; men, too, who have since become judges
of the land and ministers of state, and whom
it were invidious now to name. All is over.
The old folks are dead and gone, and the young
grown old and scattered&mdash;who knows whither? But
it was a strange place after its kind, perhaps as
strange as any that has existed since the sign of the
Mermaid was painted by some peripatetic limner
of the Elizabethan period. Long before "Pickwick"
was written, that old house was rendered notorious
by a less pleasing association, of which the old people,
at least, seemed almost, if not quite, as proud. For
thither the murderer Thurtell and his associates and
victim were wont to repair. There, possibly, the
former planned his atrocious deed, and frowned upon
his cowardly and cringing accomplice, Hunt. Well,

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

after all, Time has long ago glazed, and varnished,
and mellowed the remembrance of that celebrated
crime. One would not sup the less merrily in Holyrood 
Palace or Berkeley Castle for the thought of
still more atrocious acts once perpetrated there. Besides, 
has not antiquity been known to consecrate the
most flagrant assassination in the eyes of the rigid
denouncer of an Orsini or Berezowski in these later
times? The quaint, old, dingy shop is long since closed,
buried beneath the countless oyster-shells of the past,
as utterly as if it had never been. Where is the singular 
remnant of humanity, that eccentric Caliban,
hight "Alphonso," as wild and preternatural in appearance 
and belongings as any of the most abnormal
creations of Mr. Dickens's most imaginative mind? A
being whose language was chiefly an inarticulate
growl, who slept on a cellar-shelf, who never put off
his ragged vestments, nor washed the mask of dirt
from his rugged face. Such was the minister of those
virgins of molluscous fame, and such as he was, he
crept to Billingsgate and slunk back every morning,
for full thirty years, unknown and without a name;
though a species of tradition whispered he was once
a gentleman, a man of education, and well born.
His real story not even his employers ever knew.
Where is the gifted "Ephemera," the glory of
"Bell's Life," that most eloquent and classical writer,
of such low-lived habits and tastes, who charmed the
public for a week, and then the public-house charmed
him, so that he would disappear and return coatless, 
vestless, and shoeless, to be refitted, and a pen
put in his hand again, wherewith to coin fancy,

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

and with it gold, to relapse into bestial intemperance
again?</p>

<p>But whoever might be revelling at this extraordinary 
establishment on the present occasion, our
hero passed its yet unclosed door untempted and unmoved, 
because unmindful of the attractions therein,
at least upon this occasion. Otherwise, he was by no
means</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">Parcus dearum cultor et infrequens.</p>

</div>

<p>But he walked quickly and steadily on, bound for
a different haven in the storm. He had already
passed four "gents" arm-in-arm, singing a cheerful
bacchanalian ditty, asserting perennial devotion to
the charms of a certain "Nancy," on a second floor;
he had also met six or seven libels on womanhood,
whom his rapid pace deprived of all opportunity to
accost him, save that one stopped short and sent
after him a volley of semi-articulate, and certainly
most superfluous abuse; also a brace of jovial
Templars; item, one poor, thin, plain sempstress returning 
to her comfortless home; item, a reporter
hastening with copy from a public meeting at St.
Martin's Hall; next a man with an illuminated hat
inviting the public to participate in the prurient
comicalities of the Coal Hole; also at divers corners
five policemen bent on levying black-mail, and one
ditto talking to a female on a door-step, and doubtless 
thereby fulfilling the duties of his calling; and,
finally, perhaps about a dozen other night-birds on
the wing&mdash;when he suddenly came face to face with
an "object," and as suddenly halted and looked intently 
at it, as if it were a bleeding nun, or the

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

semblance of an absconded washerwoman, who had
not sent back a fortnight's linen at least. For be
it known, the "object" which stood before him was
a something in female clothes, or more properly
rags. What was it? And who and what was he
whom we have thus described, and who is thus
pausing to gaze at it? The "object" was a beggar
girl, presenting a truly squalid and deplorable appearance. 
The gentleman was Arthur Aubrey, then
a resident in the Temple, though of no profession,
a young fellow of some means, whose father had
recently died, and who was engaged to be married
very shortly to a beautiful girl named Blanche, an
orphan without money, and a governess. On seeing
him, the squalid beggar-girl, who was barefooted as
well as in rags, started back, and seemed to shriek,
only the sound was inaudible. Then, after a brief
pause, she turned and fled swiftly away without a
moment's hesitation. Mr. Aubrey took to his heels
and pursued her. Certainly it was no "love chase"
that! Let us endeavour to describe the being thus
pursued. The ruins of a discarded servant-of-all-work's 
bonnet stuck to her dirt-coloured hair, and
her clothes clung to her, as if conscious that they
were past pawning for the price of a single glass of
gin, and that they could only continue awhile to
escape the teeth of the mill, or the last rottenness of
the sewer, by holding on to her attenuated frame.
Her eyes were bleared and glazed, as with intense
suffering, and two hollow black and livid rings around
them spoke of ill-health, and possibly brutal usage.
Yet she was very young, and there was, under the

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

circumstances, a painful suggestion of beauty and
intelligence in her aspect. Shall we add that there
was an occasional expression approaching even a hint
of latent goodness in that small oval face, whose
almost death-like whiteness gleamed through its mask
of dirt? One moment, you could not help thinking
of a child that had cried itself to sleep, and awakened
with its little features stiffened and unwashed. She
had the peculiar forlorn and pensive look resembling
in the opposite sex that of a religious zealot of the
Father Ignatius type, or of an ascetic clergyman who
had tried his constitution severely by excesses at
college before entering into holy orders a new man.
Thus, too, an insensible female Bacchante will sometimes 
resemble a dying Ophelia, and we have seen an
exquisite picture of the latter strangely but powerfully 
suggestive of the expression of a female victim
of intemperance. This being fled rapidly; and but
for her worn-out slippers which flapped on the sloppy
pavement, and&mdash;hear it, ye votaries of fashion!&mdash;but
for a distorted crinoline dangling round her lean
form, she would certainly have escaped. There was
something eminently ridiculous in such a pursuit. So
Mr. Aubrey thought; but on the other hand, the girl
had bolted like a hare, and it is a kind of sporting
impulse to pursue anything which runs away from
you. But surely he knew that wretched ghastly
being? Yes, they had met before. Suddenly, she
crossed the Strand somewhere beyond the Lyceum
Theatre, and ran up a street on that side. Ha! there
is no outlet. She is caught then. Sullen, crouching, 
and with head averted from the pursuer, she

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

stood like a scarecrow on a half-cultivated field at
night, animated by the wild and gusty storm into
motion, and the semblance of life. Truly, there is
much in dress, and we do not wonder that ghosts
always stick to it. By force of rags alone, a scarecrow 
reminds us of humanity, and humanity in turn
may come to suggest an effigy put up to frighten birds
from a field.</p>

<p>"So you see, you silly girl! it was no use to try
and get away from me," quoth Arthur Aubrey good-humouredly, 
as soon as he recovered his breath.
"Come, why did you scamper off like that?" I am
not going to give you in charge to a policeman. Don't
be afraid."</p>

<p>The girl gave no answer.</p>

<p>"Come, tell me what you have done with the
money and clothes which you had&mdash;let me see&mdash;only
a fortnight ago. What, all gone! And where is the
poor baby?"</p>

<p>She started and hoarsely muttered something which
sounded like "At home."</p>

<p>"Well, you have a home then now&mdash;that is something. 
But tell me where are the clothes? Why did
you not go to Birmingham, as you said you wanted
to do?"</p>

<p>She again muttered to the effect that they were
stolen from her.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mr. Aubrey; "I see it all
now," And he spoke the truth. "Here! take
this;" and he whose charity had been imposed upon
gave her a handful of loose silver, and bade her take
care of the poor child. "Above all, my good girl,"

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

he said, "do not trouble yourself to run away when
you next meet me in the Strand. I shall neither
injure you, nor notice you. There go away&mdash;no
thanks!" It was a strange compressed glance of awe
and admiration which that child of shame and misery
shot aslant at Arthur Aubrey, as she slunk away&mdash;let 
us hope to seek her poor infant in the rookery
where she had left it. For she loved the child&mdash;poor,
pale, blighted blossom as it was&mdash;and by a strange
contradiction lived for it, after the manner that she
did live, and lived for it alone.</p>

<p>A fortnight before, Mr. Aubrey had met this
creature in the Strand. Strange to say, she was out
in the full blaze of a sunshiny day. It was her
habit during some three or four months at least to
do this. Many of our readers may have beheld this
very mid-day apparition, sometimes bonnetless and
always in hideous rags, not far from the dark fetid
arches of the Adelphi, as if she had just issued
from them. At night, many such creatures are
abroad, but rarely is one so wretched seen by day.
The police did not apparently meddle with her.
Probably they did not like to touch her. That there
are chartered beggars in some localities must be well
known to every Londoner. We presume that these
generally pay their footing to the guardians of
order, and possibly even this creature did. It would
be hard to say. But it would have puzzled the
stoutest myrmidon of the Force to have arrested
her. Not to speak of her noisome contact, her
"clothes" would not have resisted a rough grasp,
and then she could not well be knocked on the head

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

and dragged away, in the interests of Society, half-naked 
and bleeding at noon, through the Strand. She
always came out about that hour, and remained but
a short time&mdash;probably sufficient to collect a day's
subsistence by tacitly receiving the alms dropped
into her hand. She had evidently not the honour of
the acquaintance of a certain benevolent marquis,
at least at the period when our story commences.
Arthur Aubrey, struck by her horrible appearance
of destitution, had one day actually stopped her,
regardless of a crowd which gathered round them,
and questioned her. Nay, he told her to meet him
again, and kept the appointment at dusk as punctually
as a lover. Alas! possibly she had once made such
an appointment, and kept it once too often. She
told him her story, such as it was. She had her child
with her then. She had friends in the country near
Birmingham. "If she could return, they would receive 
her. But she could not walk thither, could not
go in those rags." So Arthur Aubrey gave her five
sovereigns and a letter to a lady of the demi-monde,
asking her to bestow some cast-off clothes on his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e; and the lady destroyed the peace of mind
of her maid for six months, and left a thorn rankling
in her mind for the term of her natural life, by the
excessive generosity in which she fulfilled Arthur's
wishes. Certainly the "creature" did not want a
pink silk slip for her own wear, and might have dispensed 
with lace-trimmings to her linen. But the
donor was a very fine lady indeed, with a right good
heart for all that, only that she was utterly ignorant
of the poor and their wants; and she did not see the

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

"beastly creechure," as Mrs. Frisby, the lady's-maid,
with more truth than she usually lavished, called her,
and so she sent her a sovereign too, which was commuted 
into a shilling by Tomkins, the footman, who
didn't think missus ought to be robbed like that! The
result of all this was, that the "creature" indulged
in a fortnight's consecutive debauch, after which her
landlady turned her out with two black eyes on a
rainy night, the very one on which Aubrey had again
met her, the baby being taken in by an intemperate
female friend, while she went out once more to beg.
So she had lied the first time when she said she had
no home, and lied also the second time when she said
she had. But there was some shame still left lurking 
in the depths of her soul, where a ray of goodness 
seldom penetrated to give it life. Had Arthur
Aubrey threatened her she would either have sullenly
defied him, or told him a different falsehood, and
tried to impose on his foolish charity again. Let
her go, at least for the present. We can promise our
readers, although they may not be much fascinated
by the first introduction, that they shall certainly
meet her again during the relation of this history.
Fact is said to be stranger than fiction, and certainly
we have no occasion to borrow anything from romance.</p>

<p>For the present, we will revert to Mr. Aubrey and
his affairs. He, at any rate, was not the heartless
libertine, if such there were, who had seduced this
forlorn outcast from the paths of virtue, and the
blessings of home. Alas! there are men in London,
prosperous, affable gentlemen, by scores and hundreds,
whom Society is proud to recognise, and on whom

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

beauty and fashion smile, practised and habitual
scoundrels, received even at Court (would that Her
Gracious Majesty knew them for what they are!)
who have peopled our thoroughfares with these living
ghosts, these painted tawdry beings,</p>

<p class="small">Whose souls being buried in lust's grave, at night<br/>

Their mortal frames walk forth, reversing Death.</p>

<p>Can the monsters who do this feel remorse? No!
If they were capable of repentance, they could not
do it at all. Ghastly shapes and cowardly fears may
assail them, when sick, old, and dying. But the
ruffian who feigns the divinest passion of our nature,
or who promises marriage, in order systematically to
deceive and to betray, and who can leave his victim
to perish body and soul in the streets, is beyond the
pale of humanity and devoid of any redeeming trait.
Yet mothers will still smile on the reformed rake, and
fathers invite him to their board, intrusting to his
foul keeping the happiness of their beloved children,
and even not unfrequently an only daughter, the one
lamb in their domestic fold. It is nothing new or
strange! Occasionally the Divorce Court startles the
world with the revelations of the after-hours of such
a match, and the married brute is revealed to the
world unchanged in manners as in nature, even by
the mature aid of hypocrisy, from the selfish, cruel
sensualist that he was in his "wild bachelor days."
Arthur Aubrey was not this style of man; but we
confess ourselves not sorry to have recorded this little
episode in his career, since our readers' indignation
will, in all probability, hereafter be greatly aroused
against him. We would fain show the better side of

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

his nature, and make a favourable impression at first.
We would also in some degree portray his general
character and principles. He was thoughtless, impulsive, 
extravagant, but generous; a libertine, but
not wicked at heart. He had never wronged or
ruined a woman, but he had grievously sinned in
morals. His vices were manly, his virtues exaggerated. 
He gave and lent indiscriminately, and
thought himself, because his flatterers and parasites
continually told him so, an excellent fellow, with
good taste, discretion, and judgment in the choice of
acquaintance, &amp;c. He denied himself nothing. Why
should he? He was young, healthy, and full of
capacity for enjoyment, to which the worldly means
were in his case added. He had culled the fruits
of pleasure as yet without satiety or remorse. He
believed in mankind, and being vain and thoughtless, 
and giving himself no trouble to seek and court
real and valuable friendships, he was surrounded by
false friends, and a crowd of well-dressed, plausible
persons, who were in truth the very scum of humanity
and refuse of mankind. But we must reserve our
further description of our far from faultless hero for
our next chapter.</p>

<p>WE were endeavouring at the close of our first
chapter to describe the character of Mr. Aubrey. A
spoilt child of fortune, he had never learnt the value
of money, and therefore even his profuse and eccentric 
alms-giving was less estimable than it might
otherwise appear in the eyes of Charity herself. He
was much liked by his "friends" and acquaintances,
that is, by the society in which he moved, and only
intensely hated by a select few. These were two or
three individuals whom he had found out, persons
whom he had most liberally patronised, but whose
rapacity, or notorious profligacy, had at length opened

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

even his eyes, causing him to decline their intimacy
or further acquaintance. That some persons dislike
those who have benefited them, as much as those
whom they have injured, is, we fear, a remark of
wide application. And the point where the change
from fictitious love to unfeigned hatred, from pretended 
respect and affection to real envy, malignity,
and contempt, generally occurs, is exactly where the
benefactor ceases to be able or willing to do more, or
the recipient can dispense with further services.
Hereafter, we shall have occasion to observe a large
increase to our hero's at present by no means numerous 
circle of enemies and detractors.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey had "a taste," as it is called, for
music and the fine arts generally. He belonged to
two "literary and dramatic," as well as two or three
yacht clubs. He was a good rider, fencer, and shot,
wrote poetry, and had published a play, or dramatic
poem&mdash;of course "every one," by which we mean his
numerous circle of friends, said that the latter was
rather an improvement on Shakespeare than otherwise. 
But then, "Shakespeare would not do now,"
they added. "We want deeper thought. Look at
Browning and Tennyson." As those gentlemen did
not happen to be present, it was difficult to follow
the injunction; but every one looked very wise, which
answered the same purpose, and as Shakespeare said
nothing, judgment was allowed to go by default.
Mr. Aubrey had been the owner of a magnificent
yacht, which was wrecked off Falmouth just prior
to the commencement of this history, through the
negligence of the jolliest and best-meaning of master-mariners, 

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

whom Aubrey had taken out of prison,
and placed upon his sea-legs. In recompense for
this, the devoted seaman took to toasting his generous
patron's health so often in that patron's own wine
and brandy, that his sea-legs frequently exaggerated
their nautical duty, and the vessel was left to the
guidance of the next in command. In addition to
this, the worthy captain took to smuggling in his
patron's yacht, which enabled him to exhibit his
gratitude to the owner by some appropriate presents.
The fact is, that Aubrey had received intelligence
when at Naples, which induced him to hurry home,
leaving the vessel to follow him, so soon as wind and
weather would permit. The captain's orders were to
proceed to Southampton and meet his owner there;
but it suited him better to stop at Falmouth, so he
made for that harbour; having resolved, by the
connivance of a friend there, to send in a bill for a
new boom, and thereby convey the idea that he had
lost one in a gale off Falmouth. But his intentions,
however good, were baulked by the result of a little
indiscretion, which occasioned the real loss of
boom, vessel, and all. The grateful fellow went on
shore as soon as he arrived, leaving the yacht riding
at single anchor. The mate, who had doubtless another 
mate on shore, followed his example, until all
the crew had slunk away with the exception of a man
and couple of boys who had been shipped at Vigo.
About two A.M. it blew a hurricane. Let us do the
captain justice. It was fine weather when he quitted
the vessel. So the yacht went after her crew, that is,
on shore, and so ended the history of Arthur Aubrey,

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

Esq., as a yachting man, and vice-commodore of the
"True Blue Club," whose members were bound to
have been at least one thousand miles from London
in their own vessels.</p>

<p>The assistance rendered to his vessel in her breaking-up 
moments was touchingly expensive. His
friends and well-wishers in the port, after indignantly
and insolently refusing in his name the advice and
assistance tendered by the admiral and dockyard
authorities, hired a steam-tug at forty pounds an
hour to pull the yacht off the rocks, and made such a
breach in her bottom, or rather side, that she must
have sunk had she floated. To provide, however,
against this danger, they broke up her compartments
with axes at low water, and filled her with casks and
barrels bought at any price from a neighbouring
brewer and nearly all the publicans in the county of
Cornwall. This little process caused her deck to
burst up, and finished her career very summarily. A
broken piano-frame, carried to a music-shop in the
town, was repaired by order of some one or other,
and cost Aubrey forty-five pounds; and every other
bill was in proportion. A marine artist painted the
wreck, not by order; but the attention was so considerate, 
that about a fortnight after, on presenting
the picture to the owner of the wrecked vessel, he
got a bill accepted, under peculiar and distressing
circumstances, by our foolish friend for two hundred
and sixty-three pounds seven shillings and tenpence.
It made the artist, whose father, or uncle, or son-in-law, 
or somebody or other, was rescued from self-destruction 

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

thereby, grateful for ever: so much so,
that he never was known to come near his benefactor
again, being doubtless anxious to avoid recalling to
his mind the distressing loss of the yacht. There was
a pilot engaged to take the vessel to the port of London, 
had she been saved, but the event did not come
off, owing to her total loss. This man dying soon
after, his widow* brought an action against Aubrey
for two hundred pounds for detention, and recovered
it, as the widow of a pilot ought.</p>

<p class="small">[*This would suggest doubt, but for an explanation. A pilot has a
most instant remedy for the remuneration of his duties, and very properly 
so. In this case Mr. Aubrey had compromised the matter at
once by paying the man a large portion of his demand. But the
latter neglected somehow to erase the debt from his books, and so
Aubrey had the pleasure of paying nearly twice the amount originally
claimed. We knew a similar case, in which the pilot who had brought
a dismantled yacht round from the south coast to London, made an
overcharge, but accepted a portion of the claim, and his widow recovered 
the whole amount nearly seven years afterwards, the man having
lived nearly six years afterwards, and the law allowing a year to the
executors.]</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey's nominal income at this time was
some three thousand a-year. It was said that there
were valuable mineral lodes under that part of his
property which was in Cornwall, the remainder being
in the adjoining county of Devon. His father's will
was a curious one, but of that anon. Suffice it to
say that he had only a life-estate, and was bound by
curious restrictions, penalties, and forfeitures. His
father was a rich shipping agent, who would not
bring him up to his business, being determined
that his only son should be Lord Chancellor, the old
gentleman having an immense respect for the Law.
<i>Now</i>, perhaps, the distinction has lost some of its

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

charms, at least in the eyes of scrupulous men.
"Where is the boasted integrity of the British merchant 
now-a-days?" cries in revenge some pert young
barrister of the period. But this is a subject which
we are by no means called upon to discuss.</p>

<p>In person Arthur Aubrey was tall and decidedly
good-looking. His hair was dark, with an auburn
tinge, his eyes dark blue, his hands and feet small.
His face was oval, and there was a melancholy look
about him when in repose, which had a great charm
for the majority of the female sex. His portrait
would have been very useful in advertising for a wife.
He had a craving for novelty and excitement, was
much spoilt and petted by the ladies, and pursued an
object, when he had set his heart on it, with all the
eagerness of a child.</p>

<p>He is now in love, desperately in love, and we
may add, honourably so. Although much beneath
him in present social position and wealth, he had
never thought of his darling Blanche save as a wife.
Small credit to him! He was free to marry whom
he pleased and whom he could. Moreover, she had
at first firmly and determinately rejected his suit,
and removed herself beyond his ken, and, consequently, 
his power to renew his advances. He had
found her again by accident&mdash;just found her at the
period when our history begins. And he is now
making off to his club to pen her a love-letter, such
a letter as none save the votary of a real passion based
both on the senses and the imagination could write.
Our readers shall judge for themselves:</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

<div class="small">

<p class="right">"Kemble Club, August 20, 18&mdash;.</p>

</div>

<p>"MINE OWN, MY BELOVED BLANCHE,&mdash;In three
days I shall be with you to claim you as mine&mdash;yes,
mine for ever. Cruel little tyrant, to have deferred it
so long, when you have confessed that you love me&mdash;love 
me. I like to write these words, and repeat
them aloud. Before I knew you, I do not seem to
have lived at all, so different are my sensations, so
changed is the aspect of everything. Ah, dearest
Blanche! how severe a trial it has been to me to
let you remain, in obedience to your commands, with
that sordid family, whose treatment I can only, in
some degree, forgive; because it was there that I
met you again, my beloved, mine own. What a
noble sense of duty in you to stay until the period
of your service shall have expired! <i>Your</i> 'service,'

think of the probable result, had I not met you, had
you remained there amongst those brutal, ignorant,
purse-proud wretches. You would have faded like
a spring rose, Blanche, in that horrible atmosphere
of selfishness, vulgarity, and pretension. And now,
within three short days, I shall rescue and claim
you as my own. My friend, Lady Margaret Courcy,
will call for you, and take you to her home, where
you will at least find sympathy and appreciation,
and whence I shall shortly bear you away to mine.
Now, don't destroy my little plot, my small plan
of revenge. Lady Margaret will call, as if to engage
you as a 'companion,' in their sense. The great
contractor's daughters, who would give a year of

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

their lives to make such a county acquaintance as
'her ladyship,' will overburden her with attentions,
and speak enviously and depreciatingly of my
Blanche. And then you will be sent for, and be
clasped to the breast of my dear friend, who will lead
you to her carriage, and bid them good afternoon in
her stateliest style. I think I see it all, like a scene
out of a play. And then, then, my Blanche will be
restored to her proper rank. Alas! no. She should
be a queen! an empress! What a vain, inconsiderate
being am I to deem myself worthy of such grace,
such beauty and accomplishments! Blanche! Blanche!
Are you sure that you do love me, that you will love
me always? Society will pay its court to you. Flattery 
will seek to turn your head, and win your heart
from me. No, no! I have no fear of the truth, the
constancy of my patrician, my haughty, beautiful
Blanche. She has said that she loves <i>me</i>, and Blanche
never can love but once. Do I not remember her
own sweet, noble words, when, with impatient presumption, 
I first flung myself at her feet, and was
rejected with maidenly dignity, my suit baffled, but
not spurned. I remember with what ineffable sweetness 
she replied, in answer to my breathless inquiry,
if she already loved another: 'No, Mr. Aubrey, I
will not deceive you, or even question your right to
ask. You have paid me the highest compliment in
your power to offer, and I am grateful, although,
permit me to say, beyond measure surprised. I do
not love any one, and never have possessed for any
more than a friendly regard. If I seem melancholy,
as you are pleased, with generous interest, to suppose 

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

that I am, it is not because my affections have
ever been engaged. But, believe me, should anything 
so improbable and so little to be desired ever
occur, the heart of the poor governess can only be
bestowed once, and for ever. And now, deeply
thanking you for your preference, suffer this interview 
at once to terminate our acquaintance and
commence my esteem! Under these circumstances
you will only wound my pride if you renew the
subject.' Such was the substance of what you said,
whilst I was vainly urging you to listen to my suit.
When, within three days, I ventured, tremblingly,
to present myself at the house again, you had left
the plain but worthy persons under whose roof I
had found you so singularly a second time. I did
not tell you then where I first met you and fell in
love with you; for I loved you at first sight, Blanche.
You had gone and left no clue, no trace to your importunate 
and almost despairing lover. Providence
was kind indeed. I saw you accidentally a third
time. I had the ineffable delight to render you some
small service, and to hear from you, at a time when
you were softened by affright and peril, that you had
thought of me since my rash and sudden proposal,
and not unkindly. A gleam of hope shot into my
breast. I determined this time to wait. I wooed
you with bashfulness and silence, as though you
wore a Peri's wings, and were ready to fly out of my
sight on the utterance of an incautious syllable, a
word too loudly spoken. I watched your smiles, each
expression that flitted over your face. I approached
you as gradually as a hermit, dwelling in the forest

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

fringe of some eastern plain, might seek to gain the
confidence of a wild and shy gazelle.</p>

<p>"At length I was rewarded; I saw a smile brighten
for me on my advent. I knew that I was regarded
as a friend, as one at least not to be shunned. I redoubled 
my assiduities, but took care not to break
the spell of delicate forbearance. Then I absented
myself for a short time, bidding you a respectful
farewell, and saying nothing which might lead to an
assurance of my return. I thought that I perceived
a shade of regret on those delicate features, as if a
cloud had passed over the sun, or a window-curtain
been momentarily drawn, whilst I was gazing on
some beautiful masterpiece of Guido or of Raffaele.
I returned soon from my hiding-place in a neighbouring 
village, again to visit on business the coarse
and vulgar millionaire, whose dwelling you illumined
with the rare effulgence of your charms. I watched
you whilst I talked to him. I saw a flush of pleased
recognition, and my heart beat wildly whilst I spoke
huskily and incoherently of strata, and inclines, the
cost of engines, the depth of shafts, of faults, and
croppings out, and royalties, while you alone occupied
my thoughts, and flitted like a white-robed nymph
through subterranean passages of fancy that should
have been peopled only by sooty gnomes. What
a fool old Grimshaw doubtless thought me, and
how blind I considered him, and to think that his
daughters should have continued so ignorant as to
what brought me to Cokely Manor! Well, at length
I spoke again, and you confessed that I was not
indifferent to you, and that evening I returned Miss

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

Jenny's angry frown with a smile of triumph, and
met with glorious indifference Miss Georgina's languishing 
stare. Was it excusable that I had been so
very civil to these amiable spinsters in order to be
near thee? Did I not in creating a tender interest
in their gentle bosoms, thereby avenge many a malignant 
insult, many an act of petty paltry spite towards 
my beloved? In three days, oh, joy! I shall
be free to visit you under auspices how different, to
clasp you to my heart as my affianced bride, to ramble
with you hand-in-hand, like children free and unreproved,
in the beautiful demesne of my noble friend.
Oh, pure and exquisite joy! Am I&mdash;am I worthy
of it? No! no! yet I will try to be; my love for
thee will purify and exalt me. Last night I had a
dark and dismal dream&mdash;I thought we were wandering 
together in the sunshine. The birds were carolling
amid the green trees around, and I gazed into the
depths of your eyes, as if to find out the source of
that mysterious light beaming from within, which I
have never seen in those of any other human being.
I am told, dearest, that it is the peculiar light betokening 
genius of the highest order&mdash;there I do not
look vexed, if I say that I think you possess that
genius, that you might be a Malibran and a Ristori
in one, if fate had so favoured the world as to have
caused your debut on the stage, for which you were
destined once, and from which with sacred instinctive
modesty you so early shrank. To return to my dream.
Suddenly, as we wandered thus, I thought that a
film grew over your eyes. As I gazed in alarm, your
face and form seemed to fade rapidly, until all colour

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

had passed away, and you looked like the phantom
of yourself. I thought that in your features I could
trace an ineffably sad and pained expression. As I
looked round me for aid, I fancied that the sky grew
leaden-hued and then grey, and the trees yellow
while their sickly leaves heaped the ground, and
eddied in the moaning wind. A few moments more,
and your cold form eluded my grasp and glided from
my arms. The ground was covered with a sheet of
drifting snow. The naked trees were whitened with
the burden of winter. Then all became indistinct
and dark, until I groped about in midnight. I spread
out my arms and folded them empty upon my breast;
for you were no longer there. And then I awoke.
Foolish fond dream! How it chilled my soul, and
even now weighs on my spirits! Shall I interpret it?
We shall live and love and grow old together, like
that couple in the beautiful song of Burns. And now
dearest, good-night! Angels attend thee!"</p>

<br/>

<p>Even more in this strain followed, but our readers
have probably had enough. Our Law Courts show
what even sober, worldly, middle-aged "parties" will
write, when they have quaffed the delicious nectar of
the rosy god.</p>

<p>Our friend Arthur was a very romantic young
gentleman, and very much enamoured. He felt all&mdash;more 
than he wrote. Having at length finished and
sealed his letter, and dropped it among the letters in
the box of the club writing-room, which were lucky
to escape being reduced to tinder by the contact of
such an inflammable missive, he felt a considerable

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

longing for supper, and it being too late at the club,
and a hot baked potato at that moment recommending 
itself to his excited fancy, he betook himself to
the Cave of Harmony in Covent Garden, and thence
to the Temple, and to bed.</p>

<p>Do not be disgusted, fair readers. It is only your
anxious, unhappy lovers, who lose their appetites.
Your lovers in Arthur Aubrey's ecstatic but healthy
state of mind can enjoy their bodily comforts with
delicious zest; and why not, pray? Since Blanche
had been engaged to our hero, and all had been
arranged for their speedy union, it was wonderful
how her appetite had improved, even in the distasteful 
company which still surrounded her, and how
regardless the saucy creature became of the sneers
directed against her by her "young ladies" in consequence, 
which would have sent her to her own room
hungry and in tears, but that a few short months
before she had plighted her faith to Arthur, and she
was far too happy to weep at their brutality.</p>

That never-tiring patience doomed to spite,<br/>

Meaner than words could picture. Her scant meals<br/>

<p>MR. GRIMSHAW was a self-made man, and lived
in a mansion like a nobleman's, but not as a nobleman 
lives. He was one of a class which modern England 
delights to honour, a successful contractor and
a mighty railway engineer, though he was entirely
ignorant of scientific engineering, as he was of
geometry, and, in fact, of all science. He was also
a great coal-owner and iron-master in the land. Mr.
Grimshaw had risen from the underground ranks.
The precise manner in which he came up to the
surface was by no means generally known. Had he
pitched all his fellows out of the "bowk," or iron
receptacle for man and material that travels up and
down the pit? Was he an admirable economiser of

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

truth, or, to speak plainly, a talented liar, totally
devoid of all scruple, modesty, and conscience, and
had he a knack of asserting his own pretensions to
get on in this world at great risk to his comfortable
status in the world to come? These are admirable
modes of achieving success in their way, and may
lead to the first place in a village or an empire, the
presidency of a republic, the chair of a parish board
of guardians, or the representation in parliament of a
midland manufacturing town. The fact is, however,
that Mr. Grimshaw had a sort of gift for finding out
veins of coal, and getting hold of them to the partial
if not total exclusion of their legitimate owners.
He had also a genius for getting into partnerships
and disposing of his partners and their claims. Perhaps, 
during the interesting period when he went a
"coortin'," or courting, the identical lass in the north
who became the Mrs. Grimshaw of our narrative, he
studied the business habits of that remarkable bird
the cuckoo. The first partner he had was the owner
of a coal-mine, to whom he had served his apprenticeship 
as butty, and then viewer. The natural
sagacity or luck of Grimshaw had developed itself in
tracing and following certain dips of the coal in his
employer's mine, and had won for him a kind of local
reputation. One day he presented himself to the
gratified and unsuspecting owner, and boldly asked
him for a loan. The other good-naturedly asked him
what he meant to do with it. Grimshaw hesitated,
or seemed to do so, and scratched his head reflectingly.
He then disclosed the fact that in the exercise of his
detective or perceptive faculty in the search for coal,

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

he had found out a wonderful secret. He knew, he
said, where a fortune might be made at a moderate
cost. He could obtain, for a mere song, the goodwill
and plant of a deserted shaft, in comparison with
which a gold-mine, or a diamond-mine, was nothing.
Pressed to reveal the locality, he hesitated, and went
away; but when recalled to the subject, spoke to the
following effect: He owed all in life he possessed, he
said, to his employer, and was accordingly grateful.
He had saved a little money, and he had, since they
last met, got the promise of a loan sufficient to carry
out his scheme. But the grateful fellow could not
forget his benefactor. He had, therefore, determined
to yield to his gratitude and remembrance, and to
offer him a share in his splendid discovery first. All
he asked in return was a share&mdash;a small share, say a
fourth or fifth&mdash;in his owner's original pit, the Great
Brambleberry, and he in return would give him a
one-half share in the profits of his new discovery.
The offer was accepted. Articles were forthwith
drawn up, and Brown and Grimshaw were thenceforth 
partners in both adventures. The Great Brambleberry 
remained what it was, or rather increased
greatly in value under Grimshaw's management
during the next dozen years, but the Little Hemlock
for once baffled even his sagacity. In fact, after a
few thousands were spent on it, it was abandoned as
before; but Brown and Grimshaw remained partners
in the Great Brambleberry undertaking. Subsequently 
Grimshaw launched forth into many enterprises. 
At the time of the commencement of our
history, Mr. Brown had long since entered a surface

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

stratum of clay as a final resting-place from all
worldly cares, and especially from his partnership
with Grimshaw, who had latterly treated him with
great harshness and rude contempt. During the old
man's life Grimshaw had gradually got a third, then
half, and then nine-twelfths of the Great Brambleberry 
mine. After Brown's death he easily acquired
his son's remaining shares in the concern, at a time
of great panic and depreciation, when Grimshaw himself 
felt much alarm, or said he did, and offered to
sell his own nine-twelfths at a fair valuation to the
son of his late patron. At the time of our readers'
introduction to Grimshaw, he is part owner in a dozen
mines, and shareholder or director of nearly as many
flourishing concerns. If Grimshaw has a weakness,
it is for a lord&mdash;if he has an overwhelming aspiration,
it is for a baronetcy. He is always attended by a
number of young civil engineers, whom he employs
in all directions, but never pays. Many of them
have been his pupils, and are very promising. So,
indeed, is he. It is wonderful how he sucks their
brains, and moulds them to his purposes. Woe to
them if they rebel; for it is no trifle on the threshold
of the profession to offend the "great Grimshaw!"</p>

<p>Grimshaw, in his "castle," surrounded by these
young fellows, always forcibly reminded us of an
ogre. Now and then one would disappear, shot off
by the monster, like a pellet out of a steam-gun, to
Spain, Sweden, South or New South Wales, America,
or Iceland, to report on a projected railway or a mine.
As we missed him, we thought of the nursery rhyme,
and whether his "bones were ground" to make Grimshaw's 

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

bread. For the rest, Grimshaw was sometimes
familiar enough with his body-guard. He would order
one to sing now and then to please him, or another
to dance, or insist upon the most bashful young fellow
of the lot making a speech after dinner. Now and
then he would place his hand affectionately on the
shoulder of one or other of them, and, lowering his
hoarse and unpleasant voice into a sort of devil's
whisper in a sick-room, give every one an opportunity
of admiring those mighty lessons of wisdom which
Success was good-naturedly imparting to a disciple;
whereas, the truth was, Success was learning all it
could from the disciple.</p>

<p>We do not by any means affirm that all the self-made 
successful men, whom England honours, are of
the Grimshaw class; but that he represents a certain
type of them there is no doubt whatsoever. Some
day it will be delightful to read the biography of such
a man. He much desires it to be written, and to
furnish the notes for it himself. We shall hear how
he went to a Sunday-school, and lent money at interest
to his companions; how he never drank beer until
he was twenty-four years old; and made a model
traction-engine out of a broken tea-kettle and an
abandoned go-cart during his sullen but mechanical
puberty. Grimshaw is esteemed pretty generally as
a rough diamond. His coarseness is looked upon
very favourably by several very refined personages;
and his savage irony passes muster for estimable
candour and frankness, in the eyes of superficial
observers. There is great power in the man,
wonderful energy of self-assertion and greed. He

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

will occasionally spend a thousand pounds in a single
entertainment; but is an awful screw to his family,
fond as he is of them. Such is the man, grasping,
cunning, ostentatious, and avaricious; brutal as the
associations of his origin, unscrupulous as the means
of his success.</p>

<p>It is in the bosom of this man's family that we
find Blanche Lavigne, and certes it is a hard resting-place 
for any one, not to speak of a beautiful young
orphan lady. Mr. Grimshaw owned a wife, four
daughters, and three sons. Mrs. Grimshaw was a
very simple person, but not very amiable. The
Misses Grimshaw ("two," as the papers speak of
young ladies at court or a ball) were not very comely,
but evil-minded and ambitious, as only persons of
their breed and in their position can be.</p>

<p>There were, however, two much younger sisters,
quite children, of a far better nature. One, at least,
the youngest, was a charming child. The fact is she
was not too old, at the advent of Blanche as her
governess, to catch the sweet infection of her kind
heart and refined and delicate manners. The three
young male Grimshaws were bear-cubs, of whom the
youngest and best was under the sole guardianship
and control of the gamekeeper. Mr. Grimshaw did
not shoot, but he stood in a kind of awe of his
keeper. It was not from early associations, for
Grimshaw had never been on a poaching expedition
in his youth. The fact is that he did not exactly
know what to do with him, or expect from him, when
he first had him. His butler was for long a source
of misery. He did not feel quite so comfortable with

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

his after-dinner clay pipe in the presence of that
potentate, until a certain hard-up lord, who happened
to be in his iron clutches, had visited him and borne
him company in smoking a long "churchwarden" in
the princely dining-room of Cokely Manor. In truth,
Grimshaw often keenly studied the behaviour of his
victims with a view to the coveted baronetcy and
future presidency of the Civil Engineers. When
philosophical, he would say, that he had found out
that a lord and a pitman were "both of the same bit
of stuff," and had much the same tastes, motives, and
dispositions.</p>

<p>For the two elder bear-cubs, they were both carefully 
graduating in the genteel vices of the day, and
were grafting monkeyism on the original beardom or
bearhood of their dispositions in a way that afforded
the highest satisfaction to old Grimshaw, who wished
his sons to be perfect gentlemen, so far as tailors,
horse-dealers, opera and sing-song, cigars, slang, affectation, 
and perfumery could make them; although he
was by no means liberal in the allowances which he
made to enable them to live like gentlemen. In truth,
Mr. Grimshaw had a great wish that they should
become fashionable "sharps" rather than "flats," and
chuckled amazingly over a report of the elder having
won some heavy bets from a college chum, and the
second having sold an unsound horse to a young
gentleman whom he met at the cottage of a tutor by
whom he was for some months vainly "coached" for
his examinations at a seaside retreat in Cornwall.
The elder rather patronised "the little governess,"
and bestowed on her his flattering attentions. The

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

second confined himself to practical jokes, such as
burning her dress with a fusee, or wrapping his terrier
puppies in her best shawl. Of the two, she rather
preferred the attentions of the latter to those of the
former.</p>

<p>It was the third day after Arthur Aubrey had
written that love-sick epistle, which we hope has made
a due impression upon our lady readers. The Grimshaw 
family has partly assembled at breakfast. There
is the great senior who is reading his letters, the
maternal Grimshaw who looks vastly perturbed and
angry, the two elder sons, and the four daughters,
that is the Misses Grimshaw (two) who had come
out, and the two Misses Grimshaw who hadn't.
These, with the manager of a neighbouring colliery
who had ridden over early with a report, and a brace
of the young C.E.s aforesaid, who were watching
every look and gesture of the great man with awe
and admiration, made up the party.</p>

<p>"Extrordinary conduck!" quoth Mrs. Grimshaw.</p>

<p>"Really, ma," bleated the eldest daughter, a
scraggy damsel, who looked as if she had been
buried like a potato or kidney-bean somewhere in a
covered-in coal-shaft, and grown painfully extended
in the direction of a crevice for light; "really, ma,
it is awfully cool of her, and I wonder that you
stand it as you do. Only think, pa!" this was
addressed to her great parent himself, "Miss Lavigne
has not thought proper to make her appearance down-stairs 
at this hour."</p>

<p>"What's that?" growled the person appealed to.
"Send her away, then. There's more of her sort to

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

be had for money;" and he chuckled abruptly at the
thought, and relapsed into the sordid calculations in
which he was engaged.</p>

<p>"But, pa, she's going. Her time is up this very
day. Only we requested her yesterday to stay, until
we are suited with another."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested bear-cub number one, rather
good-naturedly for him, "little Lavigne is ill. She
may not," he added, "like the thoughts of leaving
our family." With that he pulled up his shirt-collar.
It was plain enough what he thought. "Shall I
inquire?" he added, rising.</p>

<p>His elder sister nearly shrieked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fred!" she exclaimed, "how can you demean
yourself so, to inquire after the health of a
governess? What next?"</p>

<p>As she uttered these last words, she became aware
that the object of her remarks had entered the room,
and stood looking around for a chair, which, massive
as it was, in accordance with the rest of the hall
furniture, lately purchased at a bishop's sale, she was
allowed to lift from some distance to the table without 
the slightest offer of assistance. The two young
civil engineers, it must be owned, were deeply mortified, 
but they dared not for their lives get up and
assist the governess in that house. We know a lame
little scrofulous nobleman of high descent who would
have risked breaking his neck to reach that chair,
and we know a wealthy peer, who has the reputation
of being a gallant man, who would have willingly
knocked him down to do it. But the latter would
have contrived to insult her in the operation of handing 

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

that chair far more than the mute assumption of
her inferiority manifested by the brutal rudeness of
the whole Grimshaw <i>boutique</i>, father, sons, and all.

<p>Lovely, fresh, and radiant, Blanche looked like the
ideal incarnation of a beautiful May morning, as she
fairly shone upon that sordid assemblage gathered
there. We must except, as far as possible, the two
young engineers, who couldn't help it, and had their
future bread in view.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a simple light-coloured cotton
wrapper, her mass of rich dark billowy brown hair
gathered neatly together, and restrained by ribbons
of nearly the same hue. She looked like</p>

<p class="small">Aurora [not Aurora Floyd]<br/>

Or the goddess Flora,</p>

<p>as the song hath it. Her hair, our lady readers will
have observed, was not "blue-black," that wonderful
sensation colour lately imported by the novelists, and
which we previously, in our ignorance, should have
attributed to the effect of some "invaluable dye."
In person, Blanche Lavigne was above the medium
height; her figure was exquisitely rounded yet slender;
her eyes were gloriously, brilliantly black: her nose,
chiselled as by a Greek sculptor, was slightly aquiline;
her lips full and scarlet; her contour girl-like, but
affording a promise of womanly perfection. There
was something tremulous in her glance, and a sweet
timidity in her expression and attitudes, mingled with
a species of innocent assurance wonderfully fascinating 
to behold. Her voice was low and sweet, but
clear as a silver bell. Such was Blanche Lavigne,

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

as she stood a few moments with one fairy-like hand
(she wore six-and-a-quarter gloves) on the back of
the chair, apologising for her lateness. She either had
not heard, or would not hear, the remark made by
Miss Grimshaw just as she entered.</p>

<p>"I hope, madam," she said, "you will pardon my
absence from prayers this morning. It is the first
time I have ever been absent; and, as I go to-day, I
have had my little packing to attend to."</p>

<p>"You will be pleased, Miss Lavigne, to remember," 
said Mrs. Grimshaw, grandly, "that my two
youngest daughters, Miss Victoria Hamelia Dudley
Grimshaw, and her sister, Miss Violetta Rosina
Haraminta, have been waiting twenty minutes for
their usual instruction in the planner, and that this
is geogrifey and 'istory day, as well as persition drill
and the classicks."</p>

<p>Having delivered herself of this speech, which we
have endeavoured to spell somewhat like her pronunciation, 
Mrs. Grimshaw placed one hand over the
other across her broad and deep bosom, and kept
beating time with the open palm of that one hand
upon the red knuckles of the other, as if pausing
for a reply.</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam, I am very sorry. I am quite
ready now," said Blanche, relinquishing her hold
upon the chair, which she had placed opposite a
cup of weak tea long since poured out, and a plate
of bread-and-butter, thick but not plentiful, which
was what she usually had for breakfast, even when
the table groaned under a profusion of viands. "I
do not want anything this morning, I assure you,"

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

(as if she had been pressed, poor girl! to take anything). 
"Come, my dears," she added to the younger
girls, "if you are ready;&mdash;it will be our last lesson,
you know," and Blanche sighed; for she did not at
all like leaving little Violet, poor child! whom she
really loved, to the mercy of all the bad influences
around her.</p>

<p>"So you have made up your mind to go to-day.
Miss Lavigne?" said Mrs. Grimshaw, increasing the
rapidity of her hand-thumping.</p>

<p>A bow was the only answer.</p>

<p>"I insist upon it that you take your breakfast,"
said the lady of the house. "You must not say
that we starved you, you know."</p>

<p>"Besides, ma," observed Miss Grimshaw, thoughtfully, 
"she may want a breakfast soon."</p>

<p>The face of Blanche flushed crimson, as it well
might. The two young engineers shifted about uneasily 
on their chairs. Mr. Grimshaw looked up
inquiringly from his letters.</p>

"I say, come, Georgy," quoth the elder bear-cub,
"that's coming it rather strong, eh? Draw it mild.
Such a pretty gal, as our governess, ain't likely to
want a breakfast; no, nor nothing else," he added,
in a lower tone, "for long, if she likes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Fred! if you are her champion, <i>I</i> have
nothing to say," was Miss Grimshaw's answer. "But
I dare say ma'amselle is not hungry. She has doubtless 
had something with the servants."</p>

<p>So saying, with this, as she deemed triumphant
stab, Miss Grimshaw gathered up her muslin, and
sailed majestically towards the door.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

<p>Blanche turned and trembled. A tear was in her
eye, a response quivering on her lip. Miss Grimshaw 
looked round to note her success.</p>

<p>"I suppose, ma," she called out, "Miss Lavigne
will want a testimon&mdash;&mdash;I mean a character, before
she goes. I believe that early rising is somewhat
of an essential in these matters."</p>

<p>"Nay, Georgy," said the second sister, Miss Jenny,
who had been remarkably silent all the time, probably 
thinking what she could say more spiteful than
her sister, "Mr. Aubrey, our late visitor, can testify 
as to Miss Lavigne's very early habits on some
occasions. He met her before seven o'clock in the
flower-garden, my maid tells me, more than once, of
course accidentally."</p>

<p>"These insults!" stammered poor Blanche. "Mr.
Grimshaw, I appeal to you for protection;" and she
burst into tears, a weakness of which she might not
have been guilty, but for a certain consciousness that
there was some foundation for Miss Grimshaw's insinuations, 
and that her botanical studies had been
prosecuted with unusual ardour during Mr. Aubrey's
last visit. It was after her engagement to him; but
what did they know of that?</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" was all she got out of her protector. 
"I advise you, ma'amselle, as being under
this roof"&mdash;here he looked awfully towards the two
young civil engineers&mdash;"to take care what you are
about. Mr. Aubrey is a dangerous person. You
should have avoided having your name mixed up
with his. I trust that no impropriety has taken
place here. You can do what you please, miss, when

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

you have left my house&mdash;&mdash;Eh! What? tears?
Come, young woman, I am only speaking for your
good. Young persons should be cautious, you know
cautious."</p>

<p>During this speech Blanche had left the room
sobbing violently.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, mother?" said Mr.
Grimshaw, almost fiercely, to his lady. He generally
spoke, from long habit, in that tone to her. In early
life he had beaten and kicked her into subjection,
but respectability and gentility had long intervened
for her protection. "Has any one been caterwauling
in my house, madam? Or is it some of your tricks,
Georgy?" he said to his eldest daughter, who had
just re-entered the room.</p>

<p>The only reply vouchsafed by that young lady was
a toss of her head, and a few words, among which
"thing" and "wretch" were distinctly audible.</p>

<p>The majestic mother, spouse of our successful and
self-made Colossus, arose, saying with dignity:</p>

<p>"If that young person applies for a character, all
I have to say, Mr. G., is, that I shall tell no lies.
There ain't a respectable governess to be got anywhere 
now-a-days."</p>

<p>By this she referred, or seemed to refer, to some
remembered epoch when respectable governesses were
to be got; though a stranger might have thought,
and every one who knew her might have been certain,
that she could have had very little to do with the
class in earlier life; unless, indeed, as scullery-maid
in some household, where, as she would have said, a
governess was "kep."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

<p>Blanche dried her eyes, took a rapid glance at
Arthur's last effusion, tried to smile, was successful,
and devoted herself to the instruction of her young
pupils for the next two hours. She was then summoned 
to the presence of Mrs. Grimshaw, who, with
great pomp and solemnity, handed her a five-pound
note, her last quarter's salary, and asked her if
she had got any one to fetch her boxes. The meaning 
of this was that she would not allow any of her
servants to carry them to the lodge, and it gave her
the opportunity of adding that she hoped, if Miss
Lavigne had engaged any one, it was a respectable
party, as she did not like any low people there. To
this Blanche timidly responded that she believed a
lady would fetch her.</p>

<p>"A lady!" quoth Mrs. Grimshaw, with an injured
air. "Then I suppose, ma'amselle, you have got a
place. However," she added, "it will be my dooty
to see her; though, of course, if she likes to take
you without a character she can do so. Only, understand, 
you will please not to refer to me afterwards, 
if you should happen not to suit."</p>

<p>At this moment, the noise of carriage-wheels and
a loud ring at the door startled Mrs. Grimshaw from
her propriety. "Oh, ma!" screamed Miss Georgy,
bursting into the room in a perfect flutter of excitement, 
"here's Lady Margaret Courcy come to return
our visit, and we are such frights to receive her."
So they were; but in a different sense to what she
intended. Now, it must be told, that Blanche had no
idea of suffering Arthur's little scheme of vengeance
to be carried out, if she could help it. But the fact

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

is, she had no power to do so. For a few moments,
Mrs. Grimshaw stood uncertain how to act. Her
mental vision took a rapid survey of her wardrobe&mdash;of 
a magnificent structure called a cap, in which
she looked like the great-aunt of Vertumnus; of a
mauve-coloured satin robe, brilliant as that in which
Mr. Buckstone might figure in his impersonation of
a female character&mdash;and then the door opened, and
the gorgeous Grimshaw servitors announced the
Lady Courcy, a very plainly attired old lady indeed,
who might have been in morning attendance on the
Queen herself, so far as the moderation of her costume 
was concerned. This venerable gentlewoman,
whose white hair and pleasing regular features were
most prepossessing, albeit a slight air of severity was
habitual to her, advanced with dignity and bowed
low to Mrs. Grimshaw and her two daughters, for
the amiable Jenny had followed her in.</p>

<p>"How do you do, my lady? Will your ladyship
be pleased to take a seat? I am sure, your ladyship,
we are very proud of this early visit; so kind, my
lady. We are quite 'hong dishabill,' your ladyship,"
uttered Mrs. Grimshaw, "My daughters were just
speaking of your ladyship. My love" (to Georgy),
"just ring the bell. Her ladyship will stay and
luncheon with us." Having thus delivered herself,
Mrs. Grimshaw thought of Blanche, and said, with
cold severity, "Miss Lavigne, you may go. I have
no more to say to you."</p>

<p>"But I have," cried the old gentlewoman, holding
out her hand to the escaping Blanche. "The truth
is, I have come for my young friend here. I fear,"

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

she added, mischievously, "you will hardly forgive
me for running off with her."</p>

<p>No flower in the wished-for cap of Mrs. Grimshaw
which bloomed at that moment on the coverlet of that
matron's couch, unconscious of its owner's desires
and regrets regarding it, exceeded in depth and brilliancy 
of colouring the crimson hue that overspread
her face, on hearing Lady Courcy's announcement.
The young ladies looked at each other with a most
expressive glance of dismay and wonder.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand, ahem! my lady, that your
ladyship wants a governess&mdash;I mean a companion?"
at length stammered Mrs. Grimshaw.</p>

<p>" 'A companion,' certainly yes, for a short time,"
replied her ladyship, glancing laughingly and affectionately 
at Blanche, who in her turn coloured, but
with a very different hue. "My dear!" turning to
Blanche, "are you nearly ready?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grimshaw was uncertain what line to adopt.
She was not a woman of fine tact, but she felt instinctively 
that somehow or other Lady Courcy was
most favourably disposed in relation to the governess.
The intense hatred which she, Mrs. Grimshaw,
cherished at that moment towards Blanche was
rather greater than that felt by Queen Eleanor for
Fair Rosamond. That jealous historic Fury proffered
her victim a choice of deaths. Blanche would have
had none at Mrs. Grimshaw's hands. She would
have flavoured the poison with senna, and jagged the
knife&mdash;no! she would have strangled her with her
own hands. Indeed, in speaking of it to her
daughters afterwards, she said, with appropriate

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

action, "I could have throttled the hussy, that I
could." But as it was, she said:</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am delighted to hear it, your ladyship.
I am sure we are so sorry to part with dear Miss
Lavigne."</p>

<p>Lady Courcy was a woman of severe integrity,
and felt she had somewhat compromised her strict
notions of truth, by her first speech, intimating that
she thought they would be sorry to lose Blanche.
So she said: "I believe that this dear girl and
your youngest child are tenderly attached to each
other."</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, had any one in the house, save
the master, dared to suggest this, Mrs. Grimshaw
would have resented it with fury as an insult. As
it was, she remembered that little Violet had been
crying at Blanche's approaching departure, which she
was expiating at that very time in the school-room
with very red ears, and a long sum in addition to
pore over; so Mrs. Grimshaw immediately rang for
her. The eldest Miss Grimshaw was a woman of
decision. Had she been a Vivandi&egrave;re in the first
Napoleon's army, we might perhaps have read of a
female marshal of the Empire, quick, daring, resolute, 
and intrepid, as all or any of those worthies.
A mighty effort had restrained the outburst of her
passion, and left her face like a distorted smiling
mask with real eyes looking through it, fortunately
with glances which could not kill. Without hesitation 
she seized her cue and flung herself into
Blanche's arms, sobbing as if her heart would break.
It was a masterly move; for she longed to cry, and

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

give vent to her spite, and in this manner she could
do it.</p>

<p>Her sister's emotion took a milder form. That
young lady intimated, with considerable composure,
that it was a great consolation to her particularly,
and she was sure would gratify her papa, to know
that their dear friend Miss Lavigne was so fortunate
as to obtain such a home. Here she sighed, and then
she added na&iuml;vely, "We shall not lose her altogether,
because I hope we may be permitted sometimes to
see her at your ladyship's house." Then poor little
Violet was brought in to the general rescue, having
been fiercely threatened and cautioned as she was
dragged down-stairs, and&mdash;O wicked mamma Grimshaw! 
for you yourself had left the room to fetch
her&mdash;had also been bribed not to let the cat out of the
bag. She, poor child! cried real tears of sorrow at
parting. Blanche could not help asking if she might
see her now and then, to which there was a responsive 
chorus of, "Oh! Miss Lavigne, we hope you will
come often to see us," and then they all fell to kissing
poor Blanche, and Mrs. Grimshaw rang the bell; and
when the Cokely Manor "Jeames" appeared, that
lady actually said these words, which we blush to
record: "Tell the coachman he need not put the
horses into the britzska for Miss Lavigne, as she will
accompany the countess." So earnest, thoughtful,
and affectionate had they all become, that when,
after declining lunch for the fifth time, the countess
rose to depart, Blanche, like a dear little fool,
actually began to forget the injuries and insults
lavished on her, and to fancy that they did, somehow 

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

or other, mean at least a portion of what they
said. And so they did, a very small portion, perhaps;
for they began to regard her as the friend of the
great county lady; and their remembrance of the
"governess" was fainter before Blanche left, than
any one who did not know human nature could
possibly believe; and in one thing they especially
deceived themselves, and became less hypocritical
every instant. They very nearly forgot that they
had treated her unkindly and brutally in the least.
And it is a fact that had Blanche only stayed that
day and evening until bedtime, they might have
begun really to like her. For Blanche was very
loveable at all times, and especially so as Lady
Courcy's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and friend.</p>

<p>"But you know, mamma," said Miss Georgy,
speaking of the affair afterwards, "we could not
have acted otherwise with a governess, and at twenty
pounds a-year, too," quite forgetting by whom the
price of her services was fixed.</p>

<p>As Blanche rode home with the countess, the
latter attempted once or twice, as delicately as possible, 
to draw her out with regard to her treatment
at the Grimshaws. The truth is that she was tolerably 
aware of the facts from her own observation,
as well as Arthur's indignant comments. But Blanche
dexterously evaded the subject, or could only be
induced to talk freely and fondly of her poor dear
little pupil Violet.</p>

<p>There are families and families, governesses and
governesses. We ourselves have known one of the
latter class, who drank neat spirits secretly; and

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

another who was fond of romping with the menservants. 
But for a beautiful, sensitive, pure-minded,
accomplished, and delicate girl, it is too frequently a
sad and painful career, a protracted martyrdom; it
is too often to run the gauntlet of petty annoyance
and unfeeling insult, alone in a crowd, unpitied, and
only noticed by contempt and uncharitableness; with
the consumption hospital or a garret for the goal
of a life without sympathies and an existence without
hope.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE NUPTIAL KNOT.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">After the ceremony, which was touchingly performed by the Hon.
and Rev. Sidney Slowcoach, assisted by the Rev. Chasuble Pyx, and with
a full choral service, the happy pair, so soon as they had partaken of a
sumptuous d&eacute;jeuner furnished by Messrs. Bridecake and Orangeblossom,
of Bond-street, left in one of Mr. Longacre's most elegant new "broughams
de noces" for Paddington Station, whence they proceeded to the Marquis
of Alicompane's seat at Everton Toffy, proffered for the occasion with
the exquisite sweetness of disposition for which that accomplished
nobleman is so eminently distinguished. After passing three or four
days in that delightful abode, where art and nature have exhausted
themselves in order to offer every attraction and solace, even to personages 
of the most exalted station, it is understood that the newly
united couple will leave England for a tour through Switzerland and
Italy, and afterwards proceed by the Dardanelles in his lordship's
splendid schooner-yacht the <i>Eglantine</i>, built by the eminent Messrs.
Skyscraper, of Cowes. We may add that it is expected that they will
arrive at Odessa, that magnificent monument of British magnanimity
and moderation, about the month of February, on a visit to his Excellency 
Count Hango Tigrevieff, the celebrated Russian general and
diplomatist, whom it may be remembered is a near relation by marriage 
of Lord Craven de Yieldingham, the successful negotiator to
whom we are indebted for the sudden and humane termination of the
late distressing and disastrous war.&mdash;<i>Morning and Evening Gusher.</i></p>

IT is very odd how Society will continue to plot, in
order to make those which ought to be the most
delightful moments of life the most uncomfortable.
Not to speak of the awful ceremony called a dinner-party, 
where the general demeanour of the company
is often quite as effectively iced as the wine, and

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

where one starves in the midst of plenty, like a
modern Tantalus in tight boots overwhelmed with
superabundant drapery, with head and shoulders
showing like those of a despairing shopman, who
has unrolled mountains of feminine attire upon the
counter of his magnificent firm; not to mention a
fashionable "drum," or ball, where the atmosphere
of the dazzling salons resembles that of the Black
Hole of Calcutta&mdash;just consider our customs at a
wedding! The bride is magnificently attired, and
stared at almost into hysterics, after being laced
nearly to fainting point. Then she is ruthlessly disrobed, 
to be again squeezed into a travelling-dress,
and whisked away on a fatiguing journey to a sufficiently 
distant place, possibly undergoing rapid sojourns 
at hotels, as if the newly-married couple were
pursued by detective officers, or the Furies were hot on
their track. How few tempers can possibly stand
the test of a honeymoon conventionally administered.
It is all very well to talk about knowing the worst
of each other, at first and at once; but how often a
bad beginning makes a bad ending. If a pair could
only impose upon each other with a month's amiability, 
they might keep up the delightful delusion to
the last. But how ill-omened a commencement it is for
the husband to have to swear at drunken post-boys, or
to be bothered at a railway station, to find fault with
extortionate landlords, to storm at imposition and
discomfort everywhere; and how sad for the young
wife to be tired, and worried, and flurried, and jolted
into headaches and ill-temper. Then there is the
frequently fatal mistake of confining two persons to

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

their own society for a month, upon which we need
not enlarge. How they find out each other's weak
points! It puts us in mind of a preliminary round
of sparring in a prize-fight. No, no, we do not
approve of the Siamese solitary confinement principle
outside, any more than inside, prison-bars. Let
people who are destined to live together for the rest
of their lives commence as they mean to continue;
that is our maxim. As for rushing over the Continent 
under such circumstances, it is the wildest
delusion, too often comprising every discomfort,
beginning with sea-sickness and ending with fleas.
Our opinion is that a British newly-married pair
should commence their wedded lives in a neat and
sensible manner <i>at home</i>, and that honeymoons
should be annual if not perennial treats; not mere
flashes in the pan at the commencement of disunion.</p>

<p>"A very pretty argument," quoth our cousin Ada,
"in order to mulct us poor women in a shabby
manner of our few privileges. Before we sink down
into ordinary humdrum existence, you surely need
not grudge us a month's holiday."</p>

<p>"A month?" we replied; " 'tis very suggestive of
the treadmill, or of a sentence to imprisonment
for that period. Why should we be more thoughtful 
of our convicts' comfort than our own? We
have improved their condition vastly, why not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hand was here placed over our mouth, which we
gallantly saluted of course, a proceeding which, for
the time at least, effectually closed our remarks on
the absurd customs which make the first four weeks

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

or so of marriage too frequently an attempt to be
ecstatic in the face of overpowering difficulties.</p>

<p>The marriage between our young lovers took place
in London, at St. George's, Hanover-square, and was
duly recorded in the "Morning Post." As that shabby
notice, warning, or admonition of "No cards," had
not then crept into practice, cards were sent amongst
others to the Grimshaws; not, we must say, by
Blanche or Arthur, but by a certain pert but pretty
and good-tempered lady's-maid, who, on Blanche
leaving the Grimshaws, had given notice in the
most independent style, to the great disgust of the
ladies of that family. Susan had been an early discoverer 
of the love affair between Aubrey and
Blanche, and had made up her saucy mind to live
with the young couple. There was no harm about
the girl, who was of an affectionate and steadfast
disposition, but she cherished very strong hatreds
as well as attachments, and had her own views of
things, and stuck to them; there was, in truth, a
considerable amount of "servantgalism" about her,
mixed with excellent qualities of head and heart.
Though perfectly honest, and never helping herself
to anything, she hated a mean "missus;" though
averse to ill-natured scandal, she would talk about
the neighbours, what they did and what they had,
and what they said, and what was said of them. If
masters and mistresses only knew what servants do
say and think&mdash;ay, and know about them! But
they go on, as if they were surrounded by automata.
A clever, faithful, and confidential servant is a character 
constantly occurring on the stage. One reason

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

is that he aids the plot so essentially. Such an assistant 
would be invaluable to a man of the world
desirous of being well posted in the affairs of those
with whom he came in contact. We do not say that
such assistance would be either dignified or proper.
A true gentleman knows barely anything of his
neighbours' business. He is neither curious nor
prying. But the vulgar, not being preoccupied with
thoughts of a high order, are at once telescopic and
microscopic in their observations of that which does
not, or ought not, to concern them.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey's marriage was a private one&mdash;i. e., it
was remarkably public, if we consider the number
of strangers who gazed eagerly at the ceremony so
dear to female curiosity and so provocative of female
excitement. What crowds of Englishwomen will
wait in the street to get a peep at bride and bridegroom! 
It matters not whether they are ill or well
sorted, old or young, handsome or ugly. The interest 
is the same, the remarks only differ. "Well, I
never! What a fright!" or, "Poor thing! she does
look well, doesn't she?" "It's quite clear she has
<i>him</i> for his money;" or, "He's married <i>her</i> for her
fortune, I should think." "What a guy!" "What
a love!" "What a brute he looks!" "Well, she
<i>is</i> a duck!" It matters not&mdash;a marriage is a marriage; 
it is the triumph, the "gaudy day" of
womankind; on that day man succumbs, and generally 
looks foolish; he is the prisoner of war on
parole of the sex; he bows to the majesty of
womanhood. Of course he may be a fortune-hunter, 
dissembling and lying at the altar, but

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

though in masquerading guise, he still does homage
at the court of Hymen that morn; he is caught that
day, though he may never be tamed; wild as the
courser of the desert, he still receives the mark as
surely as if he were, as he may be, the most domestic
animal that ever meekly submitted to his fate.
<i>Habet!</i> he has got it; he is no longer a sprightly
bachelor or sullen monozoist, deriding the golden
fetters or the rosy bonds. Look at him, feminine
world! take your fill of staring, daughters of Eve!
matrons and maids, ladies and seamstresses. Gaze at
him, slipshod girl! with or without the forgotten
beer; crossing-sweeper and apple-woman, schoolgirl
and apprentice, "marchioness" of drawing-room or
scullery, it is your brief and joyous privilege! Be
he sheepish or unconcerned, humble or defiant,
doubtful, repentant, or exultant, there he is! Is he
recalcitrant, or does he hug his chains? No matter,
look at him; look him in or out of countenance;
smile at him or with him; applaud or insult him&mdash;there 
he is; he is yours for the nonce! Behold him,
whatever he is, submitting to the yoke, stepping,
skipping, or stumbling over the line, walking under
the triumphal arch, yielding obeisance, offering fealty;
behold him, we say, crowd, squeeze, push, stand on
tip-toe, stare! He is the vassal of Hymen, your own
particular deity and idol; in a few minutes he may
drive off, or walk away with undiminished arrogance, 
creation's lord and master. Never mind, you
have seen him submit; he may turn out a Petruchio,
a wife-beater, a matrimonial monster, or even a
felon; he may leave his bride at the church-door&mdash; nay, 

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

will he not thereby only furnish you with the delicious 
food of scandal?&mdash;he may be an incipient
Bluebeard, or a practised poisoner; he may break
every vow, rend every tie, shatter the temple which
he has just built up into a thousand fragments; or he
may be a ph&oelig;nix about to rise from the ashes of
bachelor existence, the pink of perfection, the topaz
of the tea-table, the very spaniel of the domestic
hearth-rug, or, better still, the great, tame, obedient
Newfoundland dog, ready to fetch and carry, to go
out when bidden and return when summoned! All
this signifies nothing to the occasion, save as you are
pleased to speculate upon it, with all that feminine
tact and discretion which you know so well how to
exercise in another's case: it has nothing to do with
the one great fact that you are assisting in the
ceremony of the submission of another male to the
rod of Hymen, be it wreathed with flowers or twined
with snakes. Mark him well, note his every act,
glance, and gesture, follow him with your eyes, until
he is out of sight! Are you not all priestesses of the
solemnity, petticoated flamens of the mystery, eager
witnesses of the act, or deed, for good or for ill?</p>

<p>And if this be your temporary portion in the
bridegroom, what of the bride? Is she not decked
out for your admiration, your sympathy, your pity,
your envy, your criticism, your amusement, your
delight? Diminutive charity girl! whose eyes are
starting from your head like little dirty stars shooting
madly from their spheres, are you not part proprietress 
of her, her veil, her orange-flowers, her Honiton 
lace, her blushes, or her pallor, and those of all

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

her bride's-maids, be they two, four, eight, sixteen,
or any number? Is it not a spectacle for your
especial approval or condemnation? The feelings of
the whole female world are represented by, and entranced 
in, that ceremony. We believe that a female
hermit, or a Bushwoman, would catch the sweet or
bitter contagion, would understand the ceremony at
a glance, and pause at, if she did not rush to the
church-door. How women like a marriage! "Here
she is!" "There she is!" "She looks pale!" "She
looks red!" "Poor thing!" "Ain't she happy?"
"She's crying!" "She's not!" "What beautiful
lace!" "Well, I would have had something better
than that!" "She's pretty!" "She's plain!"
"She's ugly!" "She's frightful!" "What a Maypole!" 
"What a dump!" Continuez, mes dames!
Faites votre jeu, mes demoiselles! Le jeu est fait.
Thus it goes, and will go to the end. Could any
woman, under any circumstances, resist having "a
good look at the bride?" It was a startling announcement 
that there are no marriages in Heaven.
All the more reason, dear ladies, and you, my little
charity girl, who are taught to read your Bible, why
you should make the most you possibly can of them
on earth.</p>

<p>Well, our young lovers were united, as all young
lovers should be; and as few are, in the bloom of
youth, and in the possession of worldly wealth and
comfort. There were not many invited to the
wedding, but those present were select; and the
Misses Grimshaw (two), who had come up to their
town residence in Langham-place, would have given

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

much for the distinction. For, did not a lord give away
the bride, and was not Lady Margaret Courcy there?
Above all, was there not a paragraph in the "Weekly
Flunky," and one in the "Court Crawler," and might
not their names have been in these? It is one of the
severest punishments to some persons to find one whom
they have despised and ill-used at some former period
of their lives become rich, celebrated, or powerful. If
you have treated a humble and unknown individual
very kindly and generously, it is hard to bear a cut
from him or her, when he or she has left you far
behind in worldly position and advancement. But
this pang is nothing to the remorse felt at having
snubbed a Garibaldi, an Empress Eug&eacute;nie, or a
Napoleon, before they were distinguished or fortunate. 
We remember well the lamentations of a
certain well-known litt&eacute;rateur, very popular in the
demi-monde and in second-rate London society, and
sometimes admitted to higher circles, who knew
Napoleon III. when they both visited Lady Blessington 
at Gore House. This gentleman used to relate
how he and the prince used to leave together in the
evening to return to their respective quarters in the
same locality or direction. "Would you believe it,"
he would say, "I used to make an excuse, and cut
his company as soon as I could, he was so uncommonly 
silent and dull? And now he is an Emperor.
Only think, my good fellow!" We could not sympathise 
with his grief.</p>

<p>AFTER their marriage, Arthur and Blanche Aubrey
settled down to live in Queen's-square, Westminster,
where they gave very elegant and exclusive entertainments. 
At their parties, the wife's splendid talents as

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

a musician, and her magnificent contralto voice and
singing, drew around them both artistic and aristocratical 
society. Their soirees were very charming
in a true, as well as false, sense of the term. Thither
flocked the worthy, as well as unworthy, celebrities
of fashionable London life. Painters, poets, authors,
and scientific personages mingled with the great and
small titled personages, who admired beauty and
patronised talent. Had Blanche exercised her will
according to her wishes, many would have been
banished from their luxurious little salons, who were
frequently to be met there. But as these guests were
chiefly of the male sex, she did not care to interfere
with Arthur's ready invitations. Amongst their
visitors was the Duke of Chalkstoneville and Acres,
whom she disliked instinctively, and of whom she
had heard that he was a very dissipated man; the
great Mr. Stingray, a distinguished writer, whom
she dreaded, and would have hated, only that in her
happiness and innocence she was incapable of hating
any one; Sir Harry Luckless, whom she did not
dislike, but pitied, as a foolish good fellow led astray.
Then there was Viscount Oglestone, who so unmistakably 
admired her, that she shrunk from his odious
look and presence&mdash;a sallow debauchee grown careful
of his useless existence at the mature age of fifty,
who paid particular attention to Arthur, easy fellow, 
and held him by the button in the Park that
he might leer at his wife. The Duke of Chalkstoneville 
and Lord Tipton and Wednesbury were also
assiduous in their attentions. The former invited
both Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey to his magnificent entertainments, 

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

and the latter persecuted them with his
opera boxes and dilettante talk. Personally, the
Duke of Chalkstoneville always reminded us of a
certain tall beadle of the Burlington Arcade, if we
could imagine that tremendous official in plain
clothes. But then the duke himself was not always
plainly attired, and there is not so much difference
between distinguished liveries after all. The beadle
of the B.A.'s uniform was more a "livery of seisin,"
so far as small boys are concerned; the duke's a
"suit of court," as it would have been called in the
olden time. Possibly, when his grace was gorgeously
arrayed in Court attire, the resemblance might have
been even more striking. We ourselves never saw
the duke save in plain clothes, when he did not
appear like a nobleman, or even a beadle of the
Burlington Arcade. The beadle on his part was not
deaf, like his grace. The beadle lived in or up a
court; his grace only occasionally went to Court as
"Hereditary Grand Showman of the Chimpanzees,"
a sinecure which brought in some seven thousand
pounds a-year, and as "Principal Stick in Waiting,"
an arduous task for a deaf and gouty nobleman, had
there been anything whatever to do, the post being
only worth four thousand seven hundred and fifty
pounds per annum. Among these young married
persons' female acquaintances was dear old Lady
Courcy, the type of a real English gentlewoman, and
Blanche's truest friend and protectress. Then there
was the good-natured and kind-hearted Mrs. Filmer-Dawson, 
a more indefatigable lion-hunter than Jules
Gerard himself, and an active politician, than whom

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

none could be more amiable; since she always sympathised 
with the unfortunate, and befriended the
hapless refugee. Lady Madeiraville was a rattling,
gossiping matron, of French extraction and manners;
full of insignificant anecdote and back-stair stories
of Court life. Then there was the dreadful Mrs.
Blewbore, a sort of tea-tray Medusa and Minerva in
one, who contrived to cram all kinds of clever personages 
into her dingy drawing-rooms; and who
was, without exception, the most malignant and mischievous, 
as she was the most slimy and disagreeable
being in "Society." Her, Blanche tried to avoid,
but could not. For be it known that Aubrey had an
aunt by marriage, who was a strict ally of Mrs.
Blewbore, and blest with a grown-up family, educated
abroad, of the most accomplished description, and to
them Arthur was very necessary as a stepping-stone
to circles in which they could not otherwise hope
to move. Mrs. Pushforte was the daughter of an
atheistical engraver and reprobate, whom Pushforte
had married in a fit of delirium tremens in early life.
Old Brown, her father, plied him with "Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity," secret societies, and gin-and-water, 
most suspiciously compounded; until one
evening he held a pistol to the intoxicated youth's
head, and accused him of seducing his elder daughter.
The younger and prettier one had already been
seduced, and was living with a nobleman, who supplied 
Mr. Brown with the means of furnishing his
house, and finding an unlimited supply of the aforesaid 
gin-and-water for his guests. Since then Mr.
Pushforte had chiefly lived abroad in the society of

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

counts and musicians, demireps, and other "charming
people." At length he died at Dieppe of a broken
constitution and a puffy heart, and madame brought
over her daughters to try their luck in England. As
soon as Arthur Aubrey married, she wrote to congratulate 
him in her own strain on his union with so
"charming" a creature as Blanche. For once the
intriguing old wretch spoke truth, and at the same
time she gained her purpose. Blanche was annoyed
by her fulsome flattery; but she could not get rid
of her. It was she who introduced the great Mr.
Stingray at a conversazione given by Mrs. Blewbore,
who, by the way, never afforded anything save weak
tea and muddy coffee at these intellectual treats. It
suited Stingray to visit Aubrey, not only on account
of his dinners, but the dukes and lords whom he met
there. For Stingray, whose satire of "The Dirt-eaters 
of Flunkinopolis" had gained him great renown, 
would himself undergo the severest difficulties
to stalk down a lord, and would invest a duke's residence 
with the craft and patience of a wild-fowl
shooter, the arts of a Vauban, the sinuosity of a
serpent, and the underground experiences of a mole.
The haut-ton of the nobility constituted to him an
Olympian conclave, which sometimes he would storm
like a Titan, and sometimes approach in the guise of
the meanest insect. Impudent and humble, cynical
and supple, satirical and fawning, by turns, he
climbed his ladder of life, clinging to all above, and
kicking at all below him at each successive rung of
his crafty advance. With undoubted talent, and
even genius of a most unpleasant kind, he lashed and

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

branded the very meannesses which formed the staple
of his daily career. But he could be gushing and
maudlin enough in his pretended sentimentality,
when it suited his purpose.</p>

<p>In person Mr. Stingray was short, stout, and bull-necked. 
His hair, which was of a reddish tinge, was
close-cropped. He was pock-marked and freckled,
and wore very wide trousers to hide bandy legs. Let
us relate an anecdote of this most amiable personage.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in the early part of his career,
he sought out a nearly starving artist at Rome, a
fellow of small merit and less pride. He was the
son of an English officer of rank, stern in his repudiation 
of a bad artist, and worse man. Stingray
looked at his pictures, questioned him, and thrust
twenty pounds, in Italian coin, into his hand on
leaving.</p>

<p>"Botherby, my boy," said he, "take it! It is
half of all I have, until I get to England and make
some more. I did mean to stay a month longer
among you fellows of the Caff&eacute; Greco; but I must
now return at once. Be sure and don't say a word
about this little affair. I should have all the fellows
here thinking I am rich; and God knows I am not.
There, good-bye to you. Ta, ta! Botherby. No
thanks," (applying his handkerchief to his eyes).
"Of course. There, there! I know you are grateful
and all that."</p>

<p>"Such generosity&mdash;&mdash;" began Botherby, who
really was affected at the prospect of the <i>mezzi caldi</i>
he would imbibe and the dinners he would devour at
the Lepr&eacute;.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

"If," rejoined Stingray, "it would do <i>you</i> good&mdash;
and, yes it might&mdash;it might, perhaps (<i>pause</i>)&mdash;to
let some of the fellows know that I had aided you, I
should not so much mind, when I shall have gone
away; but it would be better for your sake to say
that I imposed the strictest secrecy. They will think
all the better of your heart, if you should mention it.
Say that I insisted&mdash;as I do insist (<i>playfully</i>)&mdash;that
you should not. But it may do you good, Botherby,
to say I helped you; set an example to others, and
why should I care what any one says?"</p>

<p>This was uttered as if he had just done something
wrong, and defied the world.</p>

<p>"Why should I care? I only want to put something 
in your way, man. There, keep up your spirits.
I will send you another twenty pounds, when I get
to England and receive a little amount&mdash;all I have to
look to in the world, on my arrival. We artists"&mdash;
Stingray did a little caricaturing&mdash;"must help each
other, eh? Is not that it? Of course it is."</p>

<p>And the "dear old fellow" wrung Botherby's hand,
and begun to descend from the artist's sky-parlour
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Quattro
Fontani.</p>

<p>"Hi, Botherby!" he called out to that individual,
who had sunk into an arm-chair, considering what he
should have for breakfast, and what establishment
he should patronise, "would you like me to see the
admiral when I return to England? I might do
something with him, you know."</p>

<p>Botherby, who followed him down the stairs,

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

eagerly assented, and they had a few minutes' conversation 
on that topic.</p>

<p>"And, Botherby," added Stingray, finally, "I
want you especially to see little Chatterleigh, the
archdeacon's son, you know, from me to-day, and
tell him that I am obliged to leave to-morrow and
have not time to call. Do the civil for me, in fact.
He is a good fellow, and might do something handsome 
for you, if it were suggested to him somehow
indirectly; and if he did take it up, he would talk to
every one, and I should not wonder if there were a
handsome subscription, and you will be set up shortly,
and I shall find you a great painter when I return to
Rome. Don't cut poor Stingy, then; <i>you</i> don't
think I'm so stingy after all? Addio!"</p>

<p>As Stingray descended the steep and dark flights
of stairs leading to the artist's wretched abode, his
mutterings were somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>"Hem! a stiff investment that. How the fools
will talk about it! Dare say I shall get the
'mopuses' back from the old admiral. I'll take care
<i>he</i> hears of it. Confound the fellow! How his room
smelt of garlic. Saw a trap for sparrows on the roof&mdash;believe 
he lives on them, and on what I call street
salads. He paint, indeed? Faugh! The beast
wanted me to accept one of his 'pictures.' Not such
a fool. He would have said he had sold one to me for
twenty pounds, the scamp, and ruined my prospects
as a connoisseur. Wonder whether he will talk.
Think he will. Touched him upon the right place.
Chatterleigh will tell every one in six hours. Botherby

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

will get drunk and maudlin on <i>mezzi caldi</i> at the
Belle Arte or the Greco this evening, and call me
his saviour. Some men would not <i>see</i> this sort of
thing, but I do. I'll give Botherby three months to
be worse off than ever, i.e., if he don't get '<i>dil trees</i>,'
and die on the proceeds of my touching generosity.
Ha! ha! Good thing for me if he does die, confound
him! as soon as he has told the story sufficiently.
People will say, 'You remember poor Botherby,
don't you? Man of good family&mdash;son of an admiral&mdash;nearly 
starving at Rome&mdash;died last autumn. Well,
that eccentric creature. Stingray, did one of the
noblest actions,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And the old fellow
would be safe to fork out in that case. Shall I go
back and offer him twenty pounds more on the nail,
to kick the bucket at once? Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Never was a better investment made of forty
pounds than this of the noble-minded and generous
Stingray. Botherby told every one whom he knew,
and several whom he did not know, constantly for
weeks after. Nay, he narrated the circumstance to
at least fifty artists at the billiard-table in the Corso
that night. We are not quite sure which was more
applauded at Rome ere long, the gratitude of
Botherby or the generosity of his patron. We don't
exactly know what the artist himself thought of his
patron's motives; for the former was a cynic in his
way, and soured by privation. But at least he knew
that another twenty pounds was promised, and he
behaved with the greatest discretion and judgment
in his observance of Stingray's instructions. When,
indeed, he got very drunk, which he did every evening, 

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

with the exception of those occasions when he
became intoxicated earlier in the day, nature supplanted 
art, and he would weep over the narrative
of Stingray's benevolence in a manner most edifying
to behold. And though he sank lower and lower
in estimation, save with respect to the praise he
merited as an apparently grateful beast, his benefactor 
rose higher and higher, until Stingray's
noble conduct became stereotyped in the minds of
the British residents and visitors at Rome. Moreover, 
in due course of time, various excellent impressions 
found their way to England and to the wide
circle of London society, and the story of Stingray's
benevolence was repeated from the boudoir of the
Duchess of Mortmainterre (so well known for the
extent of her deer solitudes and her sympathy with the
enslaved negro), down to the "Cave of Harmony,"
in a less refined but equally intellectual atmosphere.
In the former the story was lisped in the way of small
talk with more or less effect; in the latter it was
specially retailed, with equal shallowness of purpose,
by the enlightened and philanthropical individual
presiding over the establishment of supper and of
song.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear boy" (offering you a pinch of snuff, and
holding one suspended between his own finger and
thumb), "you ought to know who sits there, when
he comes" (takes the pinch), "which I assure you
he does very often, nearly always I may say in the
season, the great Mr. Stingray, who wrote, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
and behaved so generous to the poor artist at Rome.
Ah, I see, you know the story. I hope you are being

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

attended to all right. William, have you attended
to this gentleman?" (offers another pinch of snuff.)
"Good-night."</p>

Stingray was right, so far as Botherby's immediate
cravings and necessities were concerned. Little
Chatterleigh gave him five pounds himself, and
swore with his most comic oath, that Stingray was
the "jolliest old trump, sir," he ever knew. A
certain British consul, or general agent and dealer
in pictures, curiosities, groceries, coins, and cameos,
who represented our noble country abroad, put down
his name for twenty scudi, which he never paid.
And, lastly, a London tea-merchant and his lady on
their travels, actually bought a pair of pictures from
the bearded and interesting artist. One of these was
the "Pifferari," represented by a man and boy&mdash;we 
need not go from London in order to paint such
now&mdash;and the other, the "Adoration of the Madonna," 
consisted of a girl in a coarse blue dress with
something like a square napkin partly folded on her
head, and with enormous ear-rings, kneeling in front
of a sort of doll's-house, fixed in a corner made by
two walls. These are the kind of things which some
persons go to Rome to paint; and others, fortunately
for those who paint them, to buy; a fact even more
astonishing. Botherby was a handsome fellow enough,
and had he not been a tipsy fool might have married
the eldest Miss Hyson, who sketched in the Coliseum,
and whose drawings of the Baths of Caracalla, and
Views of P&oelig;stum, are so greatly admired at Souchong
Lodge, Peckham Rye.</p>

<p>As it was, Miss Hyson was merely provided with

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

a sentimental regret, which she continued to exhibit
until after her marriage and the birth of her first
child.</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray's act in itself was kindly enough.
What could be more amiable than to relieve a poor
artist, and give him the money so much needed by
him in his distress? Still, we who are behind the
poetic and artistic curtain, know how and why it
was done. The best people believed, as they were
intended to do, in the genuine goodness of such an
act.</p>

<p>The wretched Botherby was never completely sober
again during the brief remnant of his artistic career.
He drank the vile rum of the country in so frantic a
manner that he died, and was buried by his artistic
associates, just as the eloquence of Stingray had prevailed 
on the admiral to settle three hundred pounds
a-year on him, paid quarterly; and about a month
after the stern but honourable veteran had repaid,
not without emotion, the forty pounds which his son's
cynical benefactor had so queerly invested. The
letter containing the advice to Torlonia, with a few
words from his father, severe but touching enough,
had the old man's agony been revealed by those stiff
characters penned with a trembling hand&mdash;that letter
lay unopened by the dying artist's pallet, as his
rakish associates took their last look of him. Long
after that drunken scapegrace lay mouldering in his
grave was Stingray the honoured guest of a melancholy 
old man, who always wrung his hand with
vehemence at parting, though he said nothing; and
when that old man died he left Stingray a thousand

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

pounds, a presentation sword, his naval orders in
diamonds, a gold snuff-box, a portrait of himself in
uniform, and a portfolio of faded and execrable designs 
and sketches done by the son whom he had
once repudiated, which were suspiciously blistered by
something that looked as if they had been some time
or other in the vicinity of the Icelandic geysers, and
consequently sprinkled with drops of scalding water
like tears.</p>

<p>Shall we here narrate the elaborate ruse by which
Stingray got admission to the exclusive Whig literary
circle of Amsterdam House? Shall we tell of a
trick which he played a brother author which would
have caused the double-faced Janus himself to blush
at such paltry perfidy? We think we have not
space here.</p>

<p>Stingray had known Arthur Aubrey very slightly,
some four or five years before&mdash;in fact, at Rome.
Soon after Aubrey was married, he met our philosopher 
on his cob in Rotten Row. The latter
grasped Arthur's hand with emotion, and said:</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, dear boy&mdash;pardon me,
permit me&mdash;but such a case as yours&mdash;I know all&mdash;evokes 
our better sympathies&mdash;touches chords"&mdash;his
bridle was here squeezed on the left pocket of the
vast white waistcoat of the man&mdash;"I heard of it all&mdash;I 
said such an attachment, such a match, is an
honour to human nature. I congratulate you both.
May I call and be introduced to your beautiful
bride?"</p>

<p class="small">THE RATTLE OF A FASHIONABLE DRUM.</p>

<p class="small">The hold which a man has on the "world," as he is in the habit of
terming that very minute portion of it, the "society" immediately
surrounding himself, through the instrumentality of banquets and other
magnificent entertainments called "parties," may be likened to a chain
of any size or strength, from one appertaining to an Italian greyhound's
collar to the cable of a three-decker, or of the <i>Great Eastern</i> herself.
There is a series of links connecting the Amphitryon in the most
delightful manner with human sympathy, gratitude, and regard. But
no matter how thick and long that chain may be, let only the last
and latest link, which joins it to the present moment, be wanted, and
all is gone in an instant&mdash;vanished, as if it had slipped into an unfathomable 
depth. Every former link, nay, the whole chain from end
to end, slides into the ocean of Oblivion, and is for ever lost to sight.&mdash;<i>From 
the Note-book of Solomon Trustall. Chapter last</i>.</p>

<p>LET us now transport our readers to a reception at
Aubrey's house. The rooms are not large, but everything 
is in excellent taste, especially for a parvenu,
as the guests themselves admit.</p>

<p>We will imagine the rooms crammed, and that
Blanche Aubrey has just sung one of her most
exquisite Italian songs, accompanying herself on the
harp.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame," said a portly Italian, who had
crept into an excellent berth by worrying a Liberal
Lord Chancellor, as no Englishman could do, until it
became absolutely necessary to give him something in

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

order to get rid of him&mdash;"ah, madame, why are you
so rich? It is a cruelty, a theft, a crime, I swear it,
I&mdash;why are you not of the opera, I say it? What
voice! What pronunciation the most gracious! In
our Italy you should be easily prima donna, first of
the first. Oh!" and he kissed his fat dusky fingers
with a species of ecstasy. "Sentite! in my country,
the young men should draw your carriage, instead of
horses."</p>

<p>"A donkey carriage!" growled Stingray apart.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Blanche to the signor, "I
prefer my ponies even to so flattering a mark of
distinction. Do you know, Mr. Stingray," she added,
"I had a thoroughly English compliment paid me
the other day. A great City merchant said to me,
after listening very attentively to a song which I had
attempted, 'My dear madam, if you were only on
the stage, you would make three thousand pounds a
year.' Can you imagine a Frenchman or Italian
saying that?"</p>

<p>"They would as soon think of speculating upon
the salary of a seraph," replied the signor.</p>

<p>"Or considering," quoth Lord Madeiraville, "the
exact amount that Mr. Lumley would give for the
services of a real Peri for the ballet at Her Majesty's
Theatre."</p>

<p>"Yes," observed Stingray, "they are so disinterested, 
so unpractical, your countrymen, signor;
when they ally themselves to a daughter of Albion,
they look only at her worth."</p>

<p>"For instance," drawled Sir Harry Luckless,
"there is Miss Debrett Stumpey has had forty-nine

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

offers from foreign counts, one for each year of her
age, I fancy, and they all declared it was for herself
alone they sought her, which must be considered
satisfactory proof."</p>

<p>"At any rate," observed Arthur, "the compliments
of foreigners are more felicitous than ours."</p>

<p>"My countrymen have great admiration for de
Inglees ladies," was all that the signor deigned to say
in answer to these remarks.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Stingray, "the English
are the most polite people in the world. Look at a
French table d'h&ocirc;te! Who ever saw an Englishman
help himself to the best parts of a chicken, and then
push the dish containing the drum-sticks violently
over to a lady sitting opposite to him? An Englishman 
will take off his great-coat in a shower of rain
to protect a lady from the wet. We have all the
practical and most valuable elements of politeness.
What foreigner would have acted as Raleigh did to
Queen Elizabeth? A new velvet cloak was something 
in those days. A French knight would have
paid a compliment to her feet, as he handed her
through the puddle, with one hand on his heart and
a look of languishing adoration. You know the
story, do you not, signor?"</p>

<p>"But, yes, I know."</p>

<p>"What would one of your countrymen have
done?"</p>

<p>"Diverted the royal attention from the puddle by
some sublime nonsense on the stars, which he would
have doubtless likened to her eyes, while leading her
into it," was the suggestion of Luckless.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

<p>"Good!" said the signor.</p>

<p>"Contrived to lead her round the obstruction with
the utmost gallantry," continued Lord Madeiraville.</p>

"Bah!" said the signor.</p>

<p>"Snatched a page's cloak and flung it down instead
of his own?" observed another of the circle.</p>

<p>"But how?" said the signer. "Ecco! signorine
e signori. I will tell you, in the first place, a poor
Italian like your most humble servitor would have
had a cloak of velours in cotton unworthy of the
sacrifice. I would have taken your royal mistress in
my arms, and carried her over, after which I would
have knelt in a clean place, and prayed to have my
head cut off in punishment of a presumption so
tremendous."</p>

<p>Great laughter followed the signer's declaration.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven!" said Stingray, "that you
had lived at that period to make so charming an
alteration in the page of history. No doubt, signor,
but my Lord Burleigh would have received the royal
mandate to make you at least Court librarian."</p>

<p>"Egad!" said Sir Harry, "I believe that the
signor would have married our immortal Queen Bess,
and they would have reigned ever after in Tilbury
Fort, with the store-houses crammed with maccaroni,
and the cellars full of orvieto and vino d'asti, and
surrounded by articles of virt&ugrave; in mosaic and
bronze."</p>

<p>"It would have changed our whole style of architecture," 
lisped a young disciple of Vitruvius.</p>

<p>"We should have had opera a century earlier,"
said Lord Madeiraville.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

<p>"Listen," said the signor, whose good humour was
as imperturbable as his resentments were fierce and
enduring; "it might not have been worse for your
poor Albion, had I been the consort of your great
Elisabet. In the first place, I would have made it
one great crime to teach any charming blonde English
miss to sing and make music, who has not the voice
and the taste to learn ever to please us. Ah! what
false compliments we should be spared! What torments 
we should lose! In my country no one is
forced to learn to sing and play, when the Nature
says not. In the painting, it is different. The bad
pictures hide themselves. At least one is not forced
to look or to admire. But it is terrible what one
must endure in the English society with the bad
singers, who have paid hundreds of pounds to excruciate 
their hearers. Ah! signor" (to Stingray), "I
was sorry for you last evening. It was at the great
Mr. Goldborough's, where you were forced so politely
to compliment the daughters of the house. The one
sang loud as a cornet-&agrave;-piston, with no ear at all for
music; and the other had some ear for the music,
with no voice. Signor Stingray has asked continually
for one more little song, and I do believe he should
have turned over the leaves, only for a young Tedesco,
who anticipated him."</p>

<p>"Hem!" growled Stingray, "a man must not be
a complete savage, you know."</p>

<p>"Besides, Goldborough gives about the best
dinners in London," said Sir Harry. "His chef is
superb."</p>

<p>"I see," said the Italian, in his own language;

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

"then it was the stomach of my friend that praised
the singing so ardently." Foreigners have this
advantage in English society, they can say so much
that is not admissible in the native tongue.</p>

<p>"It was your conscience, signor, and your ears
that I pitied," he continued; "but I see now I need
not have so done."</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray smiled grimly and superciliously.
He was considering his revenge.</p>

<p>"In my country," said the signor, "one hears a
fine voice somewhere, anywhere, in the streets. One
is struck with the melody, the natural grace and
power of the singer. The gem is picked up and
polished. We do not care to teach even the daughter
of a Borghese, or of a wealthy Prince Polonia to sing,
if she have not the gift of Nature. Here the child
of a banker must have masters to cultivate her most
marked imperfections at any price. And what is the
result? My dear friend Stingray dines with the
papa, and, in complimenting mademoiselle, praises a
different artist."</p>

<p>"My dear signor," said Stingray, "pray spare me.
I am no judge of music, in which your countrymen
excel. Who can wonder that a people deprived of
liberty should cultivate melody in their bondage? I
protest that I am no flatterer. There is one thing,
signor, which I hope you would have done for us,
had you fortunately lived a contemporary of Leicester
and Burleigh, and married our virgin queen, an idea
which delights me much. I hope you would have
sent back all the Italian organ-grinders to their own
country, and hanged their detestable padroni without

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

the slightest compunction. Under those circumstances 
I would willingly have pledged you my
allegiance."</p>

<p>"I would have forced you to supply them with
better organs, my friend," replied the Italian with
dignified composure. "What! it is you who cause
and encourage the evil, and then you complain. As
the signor minister here would say" (turning to a
gentleman with a very unpleasant expression of face,
who had just entered) "where there is no market,
the supply will cease. Is it not?"</p>

<p>The personage just appealed to shrugged his
shoulders, and replied that he was hardly prepared
to admit more than a moiety of the proposition to
be correct. If a thing were continuously forced upon
the market when there was no demand, it was quite
possible that a demand might be created. He then,
amid breathless silence and admiration, uttered two
or three sentences of such astounding length, that it
became a marvel how he could possibly light on his
legs, as he did, with all the finished grace of an
acrobat, at the end. Certainly there was little or
nothing conveyed in these rhetorical flourishes, not an
idea, nor even an expression worthy of being remembered 
or recorded; no golden apothegm, or felicitous
thought. But the style was perfect, and the language
correct and scholastic; every word fell into its place
as if by a conjurer's art. He was not a magician,
much less an inspired prophet or lawgiver. His was
truly the eloquence of national decline. He was the
spokesman of expediency and compromise; the orator
of mediocrity, and the specious abandonment of all

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

that by which England achieved greatness, and
which our forefathers held dear. As a nation cannot
be made without virtues, so it cannot be mined without 
cleverness. There is the skill to make, and the
skill to mar. There are the arts that build, and the
arts that usher to destruction. It requires a sage to
found, a sophist to destroy. Knowledge supplies the
place of wisdom; and shallow learning, the deep and
philosophic instincts of greatness. In the Right
Honourable Felix Sowerface were combined, with
curious infelicity, the policy of elegant concession to
England's enemies and of sardonic antagonism to her
friends. He was the polished advocate of internal
corruption, and of external enmity, peril, and disgrace. 
His state-craft was exactly the reverse of
that of a Cromwell or a Pitt. His face was not
handsome, nor intellectual in the highest sense, not
even up to the mark of the ability which his bitterest
denouncers could not but acknowledge. His conduct
suggested the idea of a Jesuit without religion, of a
Machiavelli without a prince. Such men are born in
the dotage and decay of empire, to shine with a false
light, to lead astray from principle and virtue with
the tawdry glitter of false sentiment, hollow sophistry,
and fluent pretence.</p>

<p>In the decline and fall of a nation, are there not
appropriate ministers born naturally to the occasion,
as heroes and statesmen are born to rough-hew and
cement her greatness? As the epochs in the history
of an empire, so are the men. And one thing is
certain as it is remarkable, viz., that the false politicians, 
the false poets, philosophers, and orators

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

infinitely exceed in their transient glory and fame
the contemporaneous meed awarded to the real children 
of genius and the true representatives of patriotism 
and grandeur of soul. What honest man,
what example of real worth and sagacity, was ever
lauded like the Right Honourable Felix Sowerface in
his day? Why, even Nelson before his death was
scarcely feted like some of our late pseudo-heroes and
incapables during the Russian war. In the present
age, laudation has been so vulgarised in its excessive
and false application, that we have lately become apprehensive 
that when the next extraordinary humbug
shall die, there will be no praise left! Equestrian
statues have lost their dignity; even burials in Westminster 
Abbey are threatened with loss of distinction.
When lately one of the worst incarnations of the
modern spirit of the age became defunct, whose
godless theories and practice, were they carried out,
would reverse, in the persons of Englishmen, the
theory of Lord Monboddo, and rapidly reduce the
stunted operative to the condition of the ape, such
spasmodic threnodies were raised by a sort of newspaper 
chorus, that we felt inclined to exclaim:
"There <i>can</i> be nothing next!" When a good and
most virtuously domestic prince was lately taken from
amongst us, the laudation was so injuriously fulsome,
that a living tyrant of old Rome could hardly have
exacted more. In China, such things are, doubtless,
estimated at their proper worth. When the "Celestial
Light of the Universe" disappears, we know that an
emperor is dead, and that another "Light" is ready
to be set up. But in England we are not yet all

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

quite accustomed to this verbal ecstasy, which marks
both the softening of the brain and the corruption of
the heart of a community. The Right Honourable
Felix Sowerface was an adept in laying on the adulatory 
gold-leaf on the national idol for the nonce. It
was wonderful to hear him keeping up this rhetorical
game of shuttlecock with the leader of the Opposition
in the House. You knew that neither meant an iota
of what he said. And yet by this sort of art each
held his place in public estimation, and their spasmodic 
admirers cried, "What a capital speech!"
even if they had not read a line of it in the
"Times," and only heard of it in the skimble-skamble 
conversation in a railway first-class carriage. 
Nothing save the most abject confessions of
the Litany can express the state of all concerned in
this millennium of "sham." Such was the right
honourable gentleman who had just entered the
Aubreys' salons, the observed of all observers, the
most honoured, because the most recherch&eacute; guest of
the night. True, neither host nor hostess exactly
liked the man; but they were no politicians, and had
neither probed nor sought to probe the great social
bubbles of the day. The Right Honourable Felix contrived 
somehow or other to mix up the great Italian
question with the organ-boys and their monkeys.
He spoke of foreign dungeons, as if England had
neither workhouses nor prisons. He had much to
say about the liberties of the Sicilian and Florentine 
people; but he questioned the liberties of the
poorer classes in England to drink beer after a certain
hour, or to indulge in a little street music and song.

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

It was difficult to connect all, or anything that he
said, but it was somehow blended into a harmonious
utterance of verbiage that to many seemed irresistible 
in its logical force and grace; and whilst he
spoke his sardonic countenance was distorted with
a smile, which Mephistopheles might have envied,
but which was generally pronounced intellectual in
the highest and most refined degree by those whose
opinions bore weight. The sun alone refused to
flatter or disguise the man. His photographs would
certainly not have favourably impressed any one,
not recognising in them their distinguished and
well-known original. The Right Honourable Felix,
finished by saying that the upper and middle classes
were alike concerned, as a matter of taste and public
convenience, to put down that which without doubt
exercised a most disturbing influence on the elegant
culture of the age. "The fine ears of the ancient
Greeks," he said, "in the period of their widest
and broadest freedom, would not have endured the
cacophony of these peripatetic pests whose miseries
imported them, in pursuit of the charitable obolus,
from some petty and distant state."</p>

<p>Here Arthur broke in. "In my humble opinion,
it is a great cruelty to put down that which affords
so great an amusement to the poor. I have seen
what perhaps no one here has witnessed, the delight
of a troop of children in a court or alley, in some
populous and wretched part of this great town,
dancing to the music of the poor organ-man, who
looks smilingly on the ragged little beings circling
around him. It is not those who really have music

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

in their souls who create all this fuss about street
music. It is your stock-fish, your vegetable calculators, 
your Professor Cabbages, and your selfish,
thrice selfish epicureans and kakistocrats, your pharisaical 
impostors, who drink wine at their clubs and
mansions, but would deprive the labourer or mechanic
of a draught of beer in a comfortable bar, who grudge
the slender amusements of the poor."</p>

<p>Blanche looked at her husband approvingly as he
paused.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Mr. Aubrey, that you can seriously
defend these dreadful creatures? I thought you were
a real lover of music," observed Lady Madeiraville.</p>

<p>"So I hope I am," replied Arthur; "but I hope also
that I am attuned to a higher harmony&mdash;that of the
heart." Emboldened afresh by the expressive eyes of
Blanche, he continued, turning towards the Italian&mdash;"Your 
great Rossini, signor, did not despise street
players, when he said that it was the most flattering
sign of his success to hear one of his airs ground on a
barrel-organ. I repeat that it is a most touching sight
to see, as I have, a crowd of children on a Christmas
Eve dancing round one of these good-humoured
fellows in an otherwise dismal or dreary court, or on
a summer night in the suburbs, while their parents
stand in their squalid door-ways gazing pleased and
approvingly on the small, humble delights of their
ragged offspring. Who would not endure some inconvenience 
to afford this harmless recreation to
thousands of poor children, who have so little to embellish 
or amuse their childish life? I do not wish to
talk politics," he continued, "but I cannot help

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

thinking that our selfish over-legislation in this and
other respects is storing the waters of hatred and bitterness, 
which may some day burst their embankment, 
and spread ruin around. Your oligarchy, nay,
your legislative assembly, such as it is, which a
party oligarch holds in the hollow of his hand with the
division list of the House, as he comes down to make
his conventional speeches, this oligarchy, I repeat,
dares to do more to annoy, irritate, and disgust the
people, than any despotic ruler in the world. Parliament 
and the police interfere with the petty liberties
of the poor in the most paltry and illiberal manner.
The small fruit or fish vendor who comes to the poor
man's door must of necessity charge a percentage as
a recompense for constant liability to imprisonment
and black-mail. Whilst your clubs and private
mansions afford every indulgence to the rich in their
week-day and Sabbath potations, the tired mechanic
is exposed to the devices and machinations of a
Pharisaical Sir Andrew Aguecheek, eager to balk his
thirst and to baffle all his requirements. The police
are encouraged to treat the lower classes with more
insolence and brutalising brutality than would be used
by an army of occupation in a foreign country. And
lastly, forgetting what a short radius your refined
musical circle can boast, and that although there is a
"Beggars Opera," there is no opera for a beggar, or
even a working man, or small shopkeeper, or the
majority of the middle classes. Legislation, with a
refinement of selfishness, led by a trader giving
himself more ridiculous airs of taste and sensitiveness, 
forsooth! than were ever murdered on all the

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

barrel-organs and hurdy-gurdies in creation, stoops
to interfere with the enjoyment of millions to gratify
the affectation and frigid cruelty of a few pretenders
to fine taste."</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravissimo, Signor Arturo!" rolled forth
the deep voice of the Italian. "Then you at least
would not banish my poor countrymen. What says
the signora?"</p>

"Nay," said Blanche, timidly, "I think always
with my husband. We neither of us like the German
brass-bands, chiefly of youths and boys, who, unlike
their countrymen generally, are in the habit of playing 
such frightful discords at all hours. But they
appear, for certain reasons, to be less persecuted than
the organ-players."</p>

<p>"You are eloquent, Mr. Aubrey," said Stingray,
sarcastically. "We shall see you in Parliament soon,
and then you can advocate the cause of your friends.
But I fear you will only expose yourself to ridicule
in these days."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Blanche, "that ridicule! How it
numbs and destroys earnestness! I wish we were
more earnest in these days; but it seems to me as if
all were acting in the present age, and too often
acting only burlesque into the bargain."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Aubrey," quoth the good-natured 
Lord Madeiraville, "there's a good deal in
what your husband says, and I own it never struck
me before. If ever I am called upon to consider the
matter in a public point of view, I must confess that
I shall think over its various bearings very carefully."
And his lordship adjusted his legislative neck-tie, and

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

looked towards Blanche for an approving smile. Unfortunately 
for his hopes, her smiles of approval were
reserved entirely for her husband.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried the signor, "at least, dearest lady,
there is no danger to the conscience of our dear friend
Stingray, if he should applaud <i>you</i>. Give us, I pray
you, madame, a melody of Schubert. It will be
apropos of our mention of the brave Tedeschi. For
my part, I am of no country. I love all good music
and musicians. Or an air of Hal&eacute;vy, or better still
that charming French <i>chansonnette</i> of the young
Breton. Come! I will turn over the leaves; Mr.
Stingray cannot do it very well, I know. He will
banish my poor countrymen for making the discord,
because he does not like any music. Come, madame!"
and he began humming, "<i>La mer m'attend, je vais
partir demain!</i>"</p>

<p>Blanche sang it with touching tenderness, and
when she had finished, the signor heaved a sigh like a
hot puff from Vesuvius, and Sir Harry Luckless felt
a moisture in his eyes, which annoyed him greatly.
Sir Harry was not heartless; but how is it that a bit
of pathetic acting on the stage will sometimes cause
the most unfeeling persons in real life to cry like
children? We do not think that Nero would have
wept over the "Sorrows of Werter;" but we
fully believe he might have sobbed heartily, had he
witnessed the late Mr. Farren's delineation of Grandfather 
Whitehead at the Haymarket Theatre. Speaking 
of that theatre, we remember once to have gone
with a celebrated Yankee inventor to see Miss Cushman 
play Meg Merrilies. That very morning our

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

Transatlantic acquaintance had witnessed the mutilation 
of a girl's arm by the machinery of his works,
and had treated the affair with the utmost indifference, 
looking upon it as so much material used up,
and calculating the least possible amount he might
have to pay for it. That evening he fairly wept at
the mimic touches of passion and sentiment which
were certainly wonderfully rendered by the great
actress. Again, we have known ladies with the softest
and tenderest hearts in real life almost incapable of
being moved either by a novel or a play.</p>

<p>One of the few persons utterly untouched and undelighted 
was the Right Honourable Felix Sowerface.
We need scarcely say that he felt bitterly offended by
Arthur Aubrey's daring speech. With an "agrodolce" 
smile of the most fascinating bitterness, he
took an early opportunity to bid his hostess adieu.
As he returned homewards, he was probably occupied
in scheming how to bribe the Irish tail in the House
of Commons, without alienating the Scotch members
from his faction. It was a task that might have
puzzled a Mazarin, a Richelieu, or a Loyola. The
two former, however, intrigued for the State, as well
as for themselves; the last for a Society and a Creed.
Mr. Sowerface had no object, save to keep in office,
and indulge in his hours of leisure in the accumulation 
of <i>rococo</i> monstrosities and a taste for the
display of useless and pedantic learning. He was,
indeed,</p>

<p class="small">Not versed in elements of saving policy,<br/>

But deeply skilled in all the arts<br/>

That usher to destruction.</p>

<p>And this, England will some day find out, with

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

regard to a modern breed of statesmen, of whom Mr.
Sowerface may be taken, not only as a specimen, but
as a type.</p>

<p>It was the worst period of the Crimean war, and
the conversation naturally turned to the horrible and
heart-rending sufferings of our army, which were then
being made known by the newspapers to an indignant
public. A young and talented barrister, Mr. Ernest
Delolme, spoke with cutting severity on what he
termed "The Tragedy of Errors," at that time being
acted in the Crimea. He gave a rapid sketch of the
blunders, and the inconsistencies, save in ruin and
mischief, not to say the treasons, of the authorities up
to that time. In using the word "treason," he said
he did not mean it in the old State sense. He meant
treason to our soldiers and sailors, or treason to our
allies. "Look," he observed, "how the Turks are
sacrificed. They were actually beating Russia at
every point, when the allies intervened, just in time
to save Russia from the disgrace of her reverses on
the Danube." The Turkish fleet, he said, was in fighting 
trim, when British orders from Constantinople
occasioned the massacre of Sinope. The Turks were
fully aware of the danger of their light squadron, and
were about to order the main body of their fleet into
the Black Sea, when the interference of the English
ambassador at Constantinople prevented their coming
to the rescue. Then the Russians, after that terrible
massacre, were allowed under the silent British guns
to remove all their stores, arms, and garrisons from
the Eastern Coast to Sebastopol, against which we
hurled our armies and fleets; when we had given

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

them sufficient time for preparation. A fatally unhealthy 
station for the British troops was fixed on, in
the teeth of warning, with an obstinate deliberation,
which looked like an evil purpose, even if it were
only the result of inconceivable folly and self-blinded
ignorance. We refused the aid of the Circassians
and of the Poles. The latter he could understand
as being in accordance with the traditional iniquity
of our Foreign Office, which saw Poland partitioned
and repartitioned, and thereby became a chronic accessory 
to that terrible crime against humanity. But
the former he could not understand, if treason to
England herself were alien to our councils. What
price should we not hereafter pay for that unheard-of 
proceeding!* As for the clothing and victualling
blunders, these were the mere details of imbecility,
compared with the criminal shortcomings and deliberate 
sacrifices of our fearful impolicy in the East.
Why give Russia time to make things snug at Sebastopol? 
Why strike upon her shield at all? Why
spare Odessa, especially after the affair of the <i>Tiger?</i>
We were actually directing the war, if it were a war,
against the lives of our own gallant tars and soldiers.
How singularly fatuitous was the appointment of our
generals!</p>

<p class="small">[*This was written some five years ago, and is given as it was written.]</p>

<p>In this strain he ran on, and such was the feeling 
at the moment, that no one seemed disposed
to challenge or contradict him. Alas! how much
more was there to condemn, before the end; and
who could have dreamt that the whole affair would

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

have been condoned by an apathetic nation, with
the connivance of the chief impeachers, and with the
assistance of those who were the first to denounce
that monstrous misconduct which threatened to blot
out a thousand years of England's glory with two
short years of official incapacity and shame? What
has become of the "credulity and connivance" accusations 
of the enraged tribunes of the people, seeking
with burning words to arouse England to a sense of
the mighty sacrifice and crime? The history of that
war and its period has not yet been written: although
<i>petit-ma&icirc;tre</i> cleverness, specious verbosity, well-simulated 
earnestness, and partial spite have combined to
write and print volumes of clever twaddle, anecdotes,
fact and fiction, declamation and exaggeration, and
call it a true record of that stupendous "sell." Alas!
the very smartness and acerbity occasionally indulged 
in only conceal the fact that such works are
really penned in the apologetic interest of official
misdeeds. What might not be written, if the truth
were written? What was it that paralysed the right
arm of England in attitude to strike? What secret
orders muzzled the bull-dogs of our fleets? What
saved, as it had spared, Russia at England's expense?
What was the tale of Kars, over which the heroic
General Km&eacute;ty mournfully smiled to the end of
his days? What priggish narrative of a smooth
"speciosity" might unveil the curious darkness of
those deeds? And, lastly, what has all this to do
with our narrative, and the fortunes of our heroine?
Not much, it must be confessed; but still it is sometimes 

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

allowed to novelists, good, bad, and indifferent,
especially to the narrators of true histories, to indulge
their discursive faculties.</p>

<p>Mr. Ernest Delolme was soon voted a bore, as he
deserved to be, for indulging in such political rhodomontade 
at such a time and place, or any time
and place. Long before he had finished, he had
only got one hearer, a very shy young gentleman,
who was very glad to be talked to by anybody, and
who said "Oh!" and "Ah!" and "Bless me, do you
think so?" and "Really, is it possible?" in the
most praiseworthy manner. Even he was glad when
his tormentor was compelled to leave off during an
exquisite performance on the piano, which resembled
hundreds of mice running up and down enchanted
glass stairs, accompanied by dreadful groanings and
rumblings in an underground kitchen, and the occasional 
crash of plates. The enthusiastic barrister
was just demonstrating the truth of some absurd
charge of connivance between the British and Russian
Governments in relation to hides, horns, tallows, and
a South American tariff, and the proclamation of
our blockade of the Northern Ports on the wrong
day according to the Russian calendar. But by the
time the fantasia on the piano was ended his sole
hearer had escaped, and every one was talking about
his or her hobby, or whatever they could find to talk
about, including the Aztecs, the Opera, the Empress
of the French, the prospects of the grouse season,
the Divorce Court, the new and extremely improper
novel by a female writer, the latest City failure, and
the last vicious, spiteful morsel of scandal about

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

every one's clear friend. It was dreadful to hear what
awful aspersions were smilingly uttered, what stabs
were given by the finished Gladiators and Amazons
of Society; with what relish these moral cannibals devoured 
the reputations of the absent with the sharpest
appetite and sauce. In this business the most blas&eacute;
and languid of the company excelled the rest.</p>

<p>The above is an attempt to transcribe the Babel of
Aubrey's rooms on the occasion of a musical entertainment, 
or "th&eacute; chantant," or whatever it might
please any one to call it. To say that the host and
hostess did not come in for their fair share of unpleasant 
criticism and rampant abuse, would be to
disguise a painful truth. They did. Not even the
sweet, unaffected Blanche escaped. As for her
husband, <i>Que diable allait il faire?</i> He deserved all
he got. He was a kind of unconscious "snob" to
give those parties; and to allow himself to be transported 

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

thus out of his proper sphere, which was not
the high circle of fashion in which he moved, or
which moved about him. He was spending far too
much money, and what return was he likely to get
for the investment?</p>

<p>It would be absurd to pretend that Blanche did not
instinctively comprehend the attentions paid to her
by her husband's distinguished friends. She did not
appreciate all their coarse aspirations hidden under
the fulsome flatteries and vapid compliments which
the vanity of women too often esteems far more than
dignified politeness, and the timid courtesies of true
manhood. Her knowledge of the wickedness of the
world, and the heartless libertinism of fashionable
society was, indeed, but small. Her pure nature
interpreted aright an audacious look or impertinent
though veiled remark, without reflection or analysis.
Gifted as she was with great firmness, still her spirit
shrank like the sensitive plant, ere the contact of evil,
at its near approach. When the good-natured but
dissipated Madeiraville was a trifle too ardent in his
sympathies, her large eyes dilated with a species of
inquiring wonder which caused his stare of admiration
to fade into the most ordinary glance, expressive of
commonplace salutation or remark. She moved
among the <i>rou&eacute;s</i>, old and young, intellectual or
stupid, who crowded the salons of her small but
exquisite dwelling, like an unsophisticated lady in
Comus, untouched by charm or spell. She needed
no brothers to rescue her from the enchanter or his
impure throng; simply because her innocence and
her artistic genius combined with repellent force

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

to keep all harm away, and purify each moral taint
in the heated atmosphere floating around her. She
did not care for the praises, the homage, the adoration 
lavished upon her. She was enshrined in domestic
love, and deaf and blind to all outside her own blameless 
thoughts. Like a star she moved in her own
sphere, and as a star she shone high above all
debasing influences: the bad-hearted of her own sex
hated her; but, in most cases, she did not see or feel
their hate. The fact was, ay, and the poetry of it,
too, that she was happy. Felicity is apt to be unconscious 
of envy, and slow to apprehend wickedness.
Still Blanche had her likes and dislikes, and there
were many whom she would have banished from her
society, only that she did not like to dictate to, or
disturb Arthur, in his choice of associates. On his
part, silly fellow, he was proud of his wife's beauty
and accomplishments, and proud of the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of the
society which he kept. He did not perceive that he
moved in a sphere above his own rank, according to
the social scale, solely on account of the fascinations
of his charming wife. He did not consider that to
her beauty, her magnificent voice and musical genius
and culture, her grace and daring as a horsewoman,
and her varied and splendid accomplishments, he
owed his own toleration by dukes and duchesses,
lords and ladies, who would otherwise never have
deigned to acknowledge his existence. It is quite
true that he was a gentlemanly and scholar-like man,
with the reputation of being well off, and that he was
distantly related to one noble family of some provincial 
weight; but there are hundreds of young

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

fellows, who have greater advantages than his, who
do not congregate at their houses the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the
beau-monde, with cabinet ministers, distinguished
writers, and artists, and occasionally even royalty
itself. For a certain royal highness, accompanied, or
rather led, by a certain military poodle with beautifully 
combed locks, which no hairdresser's window
could surpass, had been there, and had been heard to
affirm with martial emphasis that the little Aubrey
was a dashed fine creature, by dash! Now, it is
clear that Mr. Aubrey, so far as all this went,
although a very independent, fine fellow, and possessing 
the entire and devoted affections of her who thus
ennobled him, was only the husband of his wife.
Did he love her with equal devotion? We shall see.</p>

<p>It is certain that when a man is really in love and
truly infatuated, his love becomes a representative of
the firmer, stronger, and more consistent character of
his sex. Such cases are rare, it may be; but as the
works of man are as a rule greater, weightier, and
more durable than those of woman, so is his faith
more lasting, and his folly or frenzy more persistent.
As a rule, men are not capable of purer attachments
and deeper devotion than women; but the rarer
examples are greater and more elevated in the male
sex. Love in man, when blended with passion, must
always touch the imagination as well as sway the
senses. The highest love is, of course, refined by
the domestic affections, and elevated by respect.
But there are two things that, in ordinary men and
cases, have a great deal to do with both the fervour
and constancy of attachment. One is the fear of

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

losing the affections of the beloved object, and the
other the undisguised admiration of Society. Vanity
and jealousy, or jealous fear, are thus undoubted
safeguards of love. There is an early love of the
"John Anderson" description, and a poetic love,
which are beyond the necessity or influence of these
unworthy auxiliaries. But how many men are there
who delight in exhibiting the fine creature whom
they own, not exactly <i>&agrave; la</i> Gyges and Candaules,
but animated by similar feelings to those of the ill-fated 
monarch who paid the penalty of his indiscretion? 
And, again, how dangerous a guest of love is
security! How rarely can a woman afford to let a
man know that she is wholly devoted to him, if she
be so! If possession itself be perilous, how much
more so must be absolute confidence in a woman and
unrivalled dominion over her heart? There are some
to whom this certainty would be the fondest tie, the
last and strongest bond of union; but they are few
indeed. Arthur Aubrey knew that Blanche was
utterly and entirely his own; he knew that her
exquisite and delicate nature would never suffer her,
under any circumstances, to love again. At the same
time he was proud of her. She appealed to his
imagination, and he had, at least, plenty of distinguished 
rivals in the field, if the titled and moneyed
profligates who shook him by the hand and held him
by the button, and partook of his hospitality and
proffered to him their own, could, for one instant, be
allowed to call themselves by so fair a name.</p>

<p>Of all the men who visited the Aubreys, the one
whom Blanche disliked most, apart from those whose
marked attention awakened instinctive aversion, was

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

Mr. Stingray, author and wit. It is not difficult to
understand this. Many persons of much greater
knowledge of the world and experience of life
devoutly believed in Stingray's worth and candour.
They saw in his morbid fierceness of attack merely
the indignant denunciation of vice and folly. They
did not perceive in him the baseness and meanness
which constantly served his own selfish and egotistic
ends. He had early discovered the cowardice of
Society, and he treated it accordingly. He aimed at
being feared, and succeeded. The fact was, that he
hated all good and noble natures, and unceasingly
lampooned all that was earnest and single-minded
among mankind, either of the present age or the
past. The greatest denouncer of tuft-hunting and
toadyism, he would lay such plans to be invited to
the table of any eminent personage, that they would
have done credit, as I have before narrated, for
obstinacy and perseverance, to the French <i>petit Hercule</i>, 
M. Pertuiset, who is said to have lain in wait in
an African forest six hundred nights to bag his twenty-sixth 
lion. While painting with the finish of a Dutch
master, and varnishing with vitriol, if one may imagine
such a process, his admirable pictures of the petty
arts and contemptible aims of Brown, Jones, or Robinson, 
to elevate themselves in the social scale, Mr.
Stingray out-heroded the beings whom he thus
exhibited, by exercising far more disgusting artifices,
and practising still more disreputable tricks in the
constant prosecution of his own self-advancement.
Nay, he was more vulgar than the worst educated
and lowest of the individuals whose eccentricities it

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

was his pleasure and his forte to denounce. He
would call one man a "snob" for hiring a couple of
extra footmen on the occasion of giving a dinner-party, 
and another for boasting of his acquaintance
with a lord, and a third for talking loudly at his
club; whilst he himself would talk in an elevated
tone of dining with Palmerston yesterday, or running
over to see Devonshire at Chatsworth. Some of this
had forced itself on the notice of Blanche; but it
was the unkindly spirit of the man that chiefly
offended her feelings and wounded her sympathies.
It was his custom invariably to deride and ridicule
the Irish people; that is, when he dared do so, either
in speech or writing. Was there anything in the
generous and impulsive character of the Celt that
was highly antagonistic to his nature, or had he ever,
as one might fairly surmise, been kicked by an Irishman? 
Blanche could not forget that her mother was
the daughter of an impoverished Irish house; and,
perhaps, this intensified the strong dislike which she
unquestionably entertained for Mr. Stingray. He
worshipped success, she reverenced virtue even in
difficulties. He sneered at the errors of the head,
she was a warm advocate of the heart's generous
promptings. Thus, though she did not and could
not entertain a notion of the intense bitterness of
mind which actuated this terrible censor of Society,
yet she felt and knew enough to dislike him exceedingly. 
He had forced his passage to the front rank
like a huge chimney-sweep, blackening all he touched,
and yet every one sought to secure him for their
parties and <i>r&eacute;unions</i>, partly for conciliation's sake,
and partly because he was the fashion in high circles.

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

In this way he added to the celebrity of Arthur
Aubrey's distinguished little circle. Blanche endured
him, simply because to have objected to him would
have been held as something perfectly monstrous;
and on one or two occasions, when she would have
omitted his name from a list of invited guests,
Aubrey had appeared mortified, and surprised at her
forgetfulness. To her he was a sort of moral upas,
shadowing and blighting for a time all her enjoyment, 
her very trustfulness in her own happiness and
domestic bliss. She could not even sing so well
when he was present. The advent of some men will
exercise a chilling influence on the merriest group.
Innocent pastime becomes at once ridiculous when
they are nigh. Everything puts on a different aspect,
as if a cloud had suddenly obscured a smiling landscape. 
They bring with them heartache, headache,
cynicism, and discontent. Such a man was Stingray. 
He professed to be very fond of little children;
but they ceased to play in his presence, and could not
be won even by his presents to respond to his caresses.
"Ah! my little man," he would say, with a grin
meant to look benignant, "we shall know each other
better by-and-bye." In endeavouring to ingratiate
himself with small folks, he would always insidiously
appeal to their bad passions or instincts. If it were
a girl, he would encourage or draw out the spirit of
coquetry or curiosity, if he could. If a boy, he would
tempt his pugnacity or greed. And all this he would
do in so natural and pleasant a manner, that it required 
a moral detective to discover his meaning and
intent.</p>

<p>SOME time or other, it might be one or two o'clock
A.M., after the night when the conversation of which
we have attempted to give some faint echoes in our
last chapter, had taken place; when all the guests
had withdrawn, and left the Aubreys their Paradise
untenanted by serpent or by beast; in the pleasant

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

hour, we say, of love and confidence, before retiring
to sleep, when Blanche had sung to her husband one
dear song, all for himself&mdash;she said to him during the
chat which ensued, as follows:</p>

<p>"Did you notice, love, how bitterly Mr. Stingray 
spoke of the new judge, who has been attacked
so vehemently in some of the newspapers for his
summing-up, as they call it, I believe, in that dreadful 
murder case of the religious attorney at Sluice-in-the-Wold, 
in Clodshire, or some such locality? If
you remember, the man of law had legally plundered 
his own mother, and left her to the tender
mercies of the workhouse; he had driven his only
sister from home shoeless in a snow-storm, and caused
her dishonour and suicide; and had so overworked
and baited his step-son, whom he had got in his office
as a kind of drudge, and whom he had previously
robbed of everything by his legal machinations, that
the poor wretch went mad and dashed out his brains
with a stool in his own office."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Arthur, "it was a clear case
of manslaughter, even in the strictest point of view.
Morally speaking, it was justifiable homicide, and
that, in my opinion, should have been the verdict.
Only what attorney would be safe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you wicked creature!" said Blanche, "but
really, I dare say, that a good many are as bad."</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur, "I know one or two in this
country, whom I believe capable of anything, and
not unlike the man who was murdered&mdash;I mean
punished&mdash;in so terrible a manner. If I recollect
aright, it was found, after his death, that he had defrauded

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

every one, speculated in all the moneys intrusted 
to him, drawn up sham mortgages, and I don't
know what besides."</p>

<p>Blanche nodded assent.</p>

"The fact of the lawyer being at family prayers
before tea, when the assassin rushed in," she continued, 
"excited all the sanctified world against the
prisoner. Don't you remember how the ladies of
Credlington subscribed for a tea and prayer service
for the Reverend Jabez Howle, after he had been
acquitted, through the looseness of the surgical evidence, 
for beating a sickly page-boy to death?"</p>

<p>"All this is very true, dear," said Aubrey; "but
you were speaking of Stingray. He said that the
judge was much to blame for talking sentiment to
the jury, and directing a verdict of manslaughter.
Well, I don't see that Mr. Stingray has said more
than many others."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he has," replied Blanche. "He heaped
the most malignant sarcasm on him. He said he
never was a lawyer, and was only known as the
author of a feeble, but laboriously polished drama;
he the great advocate, the ripe scholar, the accomplished 
orator, whose genius all the world agreed to
admire. And all this, because it happens that one or
two journals, from some personal pique, have systematically 
written him down. Do you know that it
was the judge who first made Stingray known; that
for years he has been a diner at his table, and his
constant guest; that for years he followed him and
flattered him, his generous patron, and warmest friend,
at a time when he most needed one? Now, he is his

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

worst enemy, and all to please and pander to his
calumniators. He pursues him in a manner quite
<i>acharn&eacute;</i>, as the French term it, and in such a tone,
too. 'My poor friend,' he says, 'what a dreadful
mess it is! I always said he was unfit for the Bench.
He must resign, and what is worse he will never
regain his practice. It is very sad, poor fellow! for
he has nothing but his salary, and has been enormously 
extravagant. Those parties are not given for
nothing. Open house, you know'&mdash;yes, the house
always open to him, to Stingray, the false friend!&mdash;and 
then he apes candour, and says, 'I tell him so
myself; I said, "my dear judge, it is a frightful, a
dreadful blunder." Between ourselves, his nerves
are upset. He never can recover it. How could he
make such a fool of himself? It is ruin, perfect,
frightful, hideous ruin. You cannot think how
grieved I am,' he adds; 'but what can one say in
such a case?' Now," said Blanche, "the story
about the judge's nerves, I can answer for it, is
false; for I saw his wife yesterday, and she said he
was quite cheerful and happy, and Lord Madeiraville
told me that the Government think nothing at all of
it, and that the Prime Minister expressed himself
most kindly, and the Lord Chancellor smiled and
said that his learned friend had only shown a heart
worthy of one of the brightest intellects and clearest
heads that had ever adorned the judicial bench in
England, and the newspapers are beginning to alter
their tone, and Sir Harry Luckless says it is 'a sell,'
and a 'mare's-nest,' you know his phraseology, dear,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

<p>Here Arthur stopped her in a manner that even a
loving wife, in the full exercise of female oratory,
could not complain of. "And," he continued, "you
are his advocate, my darling little Portia, and that is
worth all the world besides. So you think Mr.
Stingray very wicked, and treacherous, and cruel,
and all that. But it is the way of the world, my
dear, and it would be highly impolitic in us to make
an enemy of him."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Blanche, "what is the use of making
a friend of such a man? There are friends who
constantly make use of the opportunities afforded by
intimacy to frame an indictment against their greatest
benefactors. When the time arrives to throw off
the mask, should any base and selfish motive arise,
they are well posted in your weaknesses, your misfortunes, 
and your faults; and should they fail, in
fact, they supply the invention, to which dates and
circumstances give an air of truth, of vraisemblance,
which otherwise would be wanting. Let Mr. Stingray
be my enemy rather than my friend; if the remarks
which he made to-night be a specimen of the Dead
Sea fruit of his friendship. If ever he should turn
against us, Arthur, depend upon it we should fare no
better at his hands."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," replied her husband, "of all
he can do, when that terrible epoch shall arrive.
Besides, what <i>could</i> he say against <i>us?</i>"</p>

<p>"It is not the truth one has to fear in such cases,"
said Blanche.</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Arthur, "let him say that we
lead quite a cat-and-dog life; let him accuse you of

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

extravagance, and me of inconstancy; let him say
that we were never happy together; in fact, let him do
his worst, and how much the worse shall we be for it?"</p>

<p>And he pressed her affectionately to his heart as
he said it.</p>

<p>"As for the judge," continued Aubrey, "he can
defend himself; and, upon my word, I think he did go
a little too far for a judge. Not but what," he added,
laughing, "as a private individual, I more than coincide 
with his words. I am not sure that the act of
vengeance on the attorney was not a praiseworthy
deed&mdash;a species of martyrdom. I should not be sorry
if half of the whole army of lawyers were shot or
hanged to-morrow, or all of them&mdash;let me see, about
sixteen thousand, I think&mdash;struck off the rolls of mortality 
in a heap. What a crowding there would be
at a certain place; worse than the jetty at Margate
about the end of a hot July. The whole system of
solicitors or attorneys is a gross excrescence, and
was never intended by our ancestors to exist in the
monstrous shape that it does. By-the-bye, dear,
remember that I have to go and see my lawyers&mdash;I 
mean Grinderby and Cousens&mdash;to-morrow. There
is something they want to see me about, and I rather
think it is of an unpleasant nature about a mortgage
that should have been paid off. Do you know I
have sadly neglected my business affairs since my
poor father's death? First I went abroad, and then
I fell in love with you, which drove everything else
out of my head; and since we were married, we have
done nothing but amuse ourselves. Heigh ho! I
must see to all these things some day, or there will

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

be a mess. Now, don't you think Phil Cousens is a
capital fellow&mdash;quite a model lawyer, so pleasant and
friendly?"</p>

<p>Blanche shook her head.</p>

<p>"My love," she said, slowly and gravely, "you
do not like me to interfere or even talk about your
matters of business, much less to express my opinion
about those whom you employ and esteem. You are
far better able to judge of Mr. Cousens than I am.
You have known him a long time. But, since you
ask me, I reply to you like a dutiful little wife, that
I do not like Mr. Cousens at all."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Blanche, you are in a strange
mood to-night for such an amiable dear creature as
you are. Nothing save aversions and dislikes!"</p>

"Of Mr. Stingray," said Blanche, "I spoke thus
freely, because he made me angry to-night with his
abominable treachery, and I look on him as an acquaintance 
rather than as a friend. Of Mr. Cousens,
your intimate associate and lawyer, you asked my
opinion and I have given it. In the first place, if I
might venture to say something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out with it, you wicked and merciless satirist!
Out with it. Madam Timon and Cassandra in one&mdash;what 
dreadful things do you apprehend from poor
Phil?"</p>

<p>"I was going to observe," replied Blanche, "that
I have heard my father say, that no one should
employ a friend as a lawyer, or make a lawyer a
friend. He used to say the same thing of doctors,
but in a less degree."</p>

<p>"With all due respect," put in Arthur, somewhat

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

eagerly, "I don't agree with your father! What!
because one knows and esteems a fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Esteems?" interrupted Blanche, "say, rather,
'likes'&mdash;you don't, you cannot esteem Mr. Cousens!"</p>

<p>"Well, 'likes,' if you prefer it," he returned. "I
was about to say, that simply because one likes a
man, according to this doctrine, one is not to put
anything in his way, not to employ him, not to do
him a good turn in the way of business. Was I not
right to cut that precious old stupid firm, under
whose advice my father made a will, long enough to
furnish litigation for a century, or so long as the
property supplied funds, if any one interested, however 
remotely, were only fool or knave enough to
commence it? Why it was through old Brewer, the
senior partner, who helped to concoct that precious
document, that I was made only a life tenant with
a clause of forfeiture; that proper powers of leasing
minerals were left out, contrary to my father's express 
intention, and which has shut me out of thousands 
a-year, and that I am tied and bound as never
man yet was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, dearest," said Blanche slyly, "I have heard
you say more than once, that it has probably been
the means when you were younger and&mdash;and&mdash;more
careless, and thoughtless, of retaining the estate in
your hands at all, and saving you from utter ruin."</p>

<p>"I say foolish things sometimes," was the rejoinder. 
"I tell you, Blanche, that this will is
enough to drive a man frantic, when I think of all
the expense, bother, and trouble that it causes, and
that I cannot do anything with the property at all."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

<p>"Well, dear!" said his wife, "of course, you know
best; but as for Mr. Cousens, I don't think he is a
man of sufficient weight and dignity of character to
transact your affairs. Be assured he is a heartless
sort of man, capable of flattery, and far too much
of a coxcomb."</p>

<p>"What prejudiced creatures you women are," said
Aubrey; "I declare this is all because he wears a
white hat, with crape round it, and patent-leather
boots in the morning."</p>

<p>"And a very good reason too," rejoined Blanche,
laughing. "The fact is&mdash;say what you will&mdash;he is
no gentleman."</p>

<p>"Poor Phil!" said his friend and client. "I am
sure he admires and esteems you sufficiently. He
said only the other day, that he considered you the
most beautiful, amiable, and accomplished being he
had ever met with."</p>

<p>"Which I consider a piece of great impertinence,"
said Blanche. "Tell me, do you invite such homage
from your solicitor?"</p>

<p>"Nay, he did not say it to me."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it, Arthur," said Blanche haughtily
and composedly; "for to tell you the truth, I should
have thought such a speech made to you greatly
wanting in respect, and have augured ill of your
affairs from it."</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity," was Aubrey's reply; "you astonish
me, Blanche, I must own, with the tone of your
remarks, and the severity of your views. Stingray
has made you quite misanthropical, I declare, in a
single night."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

<p>"Remember, dearest," said Blanche, "that you
have never asked my opinion of Mr. Cousens before.
I own that from the first I mistrusted and disliked
him. His vulgar, fulsome compliments, when he
congratulated us on our marriage, and many other
things, have combined to strengthen the view I have
taken. I sincerely hope that it may turn out to be a
wrong, or at least an exaggerated one. Do you remember 
that day at dinner, when he made a sort of
boast that he never forgave an injury, nor omitted
to be revenged, if offended? Do you call to mind
what he said about killing any one who had done him
a wrong?"</p>

<p>"It was only bounce and nonsense," said Arthur.
"Phil is the best fellow alive. Didn't he cause me
to forego the prosecution of the rascal Johnson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Blanche, "but Johnson had injured 
you, not him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur, "what do you infer from
his idle fanfaronade?"</p>

<p>"Merely, that he is cowardly, egotistic, vain, and
treacherous, even if less vindictive that he describes
himself to be," was the answer.</p>

<p>"My dear Blanche," said Arthur, lighting a bougie,
"I assure you that for once you are entirely mistaken. 
Phil Cousens may be absurdly over-dressed,
but is a sharp man of business, I can tell you; he may
talk nonsense sometimes&mdash;must we be condemned
for that?" he asked in a rallying tone. "He may
speak of revenge, but he is the kindest-hearted fellow
in the world. Did he not nurse me as carefully and

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

tenderly as a woman, when I lay sick of a fever in
the Mediterranean?"</p>

<p>"And has he not had the conduct of your affairs
ever since?" interrupted Blanche. "Has not your
purse met his private necessities? You should not
give me your banker's book to add up, if you don't
wish me to know these things. If ever you should be
in adversity&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;it is not 'honest
Phil' who will minister to you, depend upon that.
And now I won't talk any more upon these odious
topics, and I shall go to bed."</p>

<p>Arthur would fain have convinced her that she was
mistaken about Mr. Cousens's character; but she playfully 
refused to listen or respond any more. He tried
to elicit her opinion of Mr. Grinderby, the senior
partner of the firm, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Come," said Arthur, "<i>he</i> never wore shiny boots
in the morning or the evening either, I should think;
and I don't believe that he ever praised you or any
other woman in his life. There is an ascetic and
eccentric being for you, Blanche! I should think
Grinderby would fairly take to his heels at the sight
of a petticoat approaching his dingy chambers."</p>

<p>It was a slight mistake. Mr. Grinderby had done
more mischief, in his spider-like way, than half the
young bloods who make the Haymarket hideous
by night. He had an establishment at Hoxton presided 
over by a black-browed beauty, who fought
with him occasionally, when she had indulged in an
extra glass of gin. At that moment he wore two
slips of black plaister on his cheek, which even his
clerks attributed to a scorbutic affection of the skin.

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

He was a coarse and calculating, cold-blooded, but
fiercely sensual old hypocrite. And he had dared
to regard Blanche herself with an expression in
his glassy grey eyes, that would have caused her
to shudder, had she met his look. For he admired
and hated her at the same time. He admired
her person and hated her mind. With his strong,
square jaw, bull-neck, and undersized figure, his
fierce appetite and pitiless temper, he resembled
a human hyena, as much as a London attorney
could; and when he shambled forth on a foggy
night, and sought the Hoxton omnibus on his road
to his pleasant retreat, few things more noxious
and venomous went prowling forth from their secret
hiding-place and lair in the howling deserts of Africa
than this parchment-faced, dyspeptic lawyer with his
evil frown, and the livid circlets of indigestion and
sordid plotting round his spectacled, malevolent eyes.
It need hardly be affirmed that Blanche did not regard 
the senior partner Grinderby with much esteem.
True, she had seen very little of him in comparison
with the elegant "Phil." Her interviews with the
former were brief, and had been limited to two. Still
he was not likely to prepossess her in his favour. She
was reluctant, however, to offend or annoy her husband 
by any further condemnation of any one whom
he was pleased to take into his confidence. As it
was, he showed a little, just a little temper about her
aversion to Cousens.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I must say I have often heard
the proverb, 'Love me, love my dog,' but I never
yet heard, 'Love me, love my lawyer.' "</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

<p>Arthur could not help smiling at the oddity of the
comparison. Somehow, a recollection stole over him
of a noble dog of the St. Bernard breed, which he
had shot for attacking Cousens when that gentlemanly
young fellow was on a visit at his country-house.
The circumstances were these. Some years before,
Arthur had, with thoughtless rashness, unloosed
G&eacute;ant, who was kept chained in the court-yard of the
mansion of a certain sporting baronet where he was
staying. The animal was known to be so fierce
that the servants looked on in fear and anxiety lest
he should turn and rend the stranger, who, however,
patted him, gave him a stick to carry, and took him
out for a morning stroll. During the stroll man
and dog got so friendly and familiar, that Arthur
took quite a fancy to G&eacute;ant. On meeting his host
at breakfast, he was congratulated by him on his
escape, and censured for the risk he had run. "I
would have bet ten to one," said Sir Frederick,
"that he would have had you down when you went
up to him. If you like to have him now, he is
yours; for my servants are all afraid of him, and he
does not in consequence get properly cleaned and
fed." Arthur accepted the gift, and the dog became
his constant companion when in the country, and
grew quite docile and good-tempered. Still it was
considered dangerous for a stranger to approach him
when chained up. Among the boasts of Mr. Cousens
was one that he could awe a dog by the terrors of his
eye, and consequently that he could walk up to the
most ferocious mastiff or bull-dog and pat him with
impunity. On that gentleman arriving at the hall,

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

Arthur had, notwithstanding, especially cautioned
him against G&eacute;ant. "No fear," said his dashing
legal adviser, "Phil's awake! Not a dog in Europe
dare bite me." Now the fact was, that Mr. Cousens
was by no means courageous in a canine point
of view. He was rather more afraid of dogs than
the ordinary run of men. But one day after lunch,
having imbibed much claret, he strolled out alone
and took it into his head to accost G&eacute;ant, who
lay outside his kennel beating the ground with
his tail, and looking upwards, as Cousens thought,
in the most good-humoured manner. "Poor fellow,"
said the accomplished Phil, "lie down then." As
the dog was lying down, he could hardly be said to
obey the instruction. "So, that's a good dawg,"
continued young <i>Fieri-facias</i>, whose inflamed visage
at the moment suggested the name. G&eacute;ant arose and
shook himself lazily with a kind of repellant air, as if
he sniffed a bill of costs as the price of so much unnecessary 
polite attention. Upon this Phil stooped
and picked up a twig, which he held menacingly over
the superior animal. A low growl might have warned
him, but it did not. He was in an exultant mood.
Aubrey had just placed confidence in him, and ecstatic
visions of plunder and betrayal rushed through his
brain. He had just settled the fact that he should
have Aubrey's business; and he felt, to use his own
language to himself, that it was four hundred pounds
a-year to him for life. He was thinking whether he
should and could dissolve partnership with Grinderby,
and set up for himself with such a client as Aubrey
for stock-in-trade. Why should Grinderby, whom he

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

always hated, and whose life-blood he could have spilt
at that moment, in his thoughts, as freely as his
patron's claret; why should Grinderby, who sneered
openly at the patent-leather boots, participate in this
mighty haul due to his, Phil's, "friendship" and
cleverness? True, Grinderby was a capital lawyer,
and he, Phil, knew nothing of the business, but could
he not get a managing clerk? Ha! the idea emboldened 
him. At that moment G&eacute;ant personified in
his eyes the obedient, grey-haired, and somewhat bald
legal menial with the blue bag, who should fetch and
carry his law for him. Yes, it should be a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>,
that he should be at least slightly bald, and he would
keep him at arm's length, thus. "Down, sir, down!"
he said, advancing a step, and giving G&eacute;ant a smart
flick. "Down, I tell you!" Now G&eacute;ant, who had
never carried a blue bag in his life, nor done a dirtier
action than it falls to the lot of every dog to do,
and who did not know what was meant, and who
would have been a great deal more savage had he
known, and who in all probability did not like Phil's
legal odour, and still more probably was guided by
the mysterious instincts of an honest dog, suddenly
responded by leaping up and seizing Phil's arm just
below the elbow in his capacious jaws. Visions of
legal and accomplished robbery, conceit, vanity, and
the fumes of Lafitte and Chateau Margaux fled
all at once, and the dapper Mr. Cousens actually
screamed with pain and affright. Here was a <i>ca. sa</i>.
against which he had no legal remedy. Out rushed
Aubrey, attracted by his friend's cries for help, and
seizing a heavy implement used in brewing, which

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

lay near, struck the dog on the head with such force
that he loosed his hold of Cousens, whom Aubrey
instantly dragged back. But being still within the
radius of the animal's chain, quick as thought he
seized the now almost fainting lawyer again, this
time getting even a better hold of him above the
elbow. In vain did Aubrey pound the dog with his
fist. G&eacute;ant had served his writ and held on like a
chancery suit. Had Cousens at that moment come
into a marquisate with thirty thousand pounds a-year,
the unity of the dog's purpose would not have been
disturbed. Aubrey had been shooting at a mark that
morning, and had left his rifle loaded in a little room
adjoining the back entrance close to where this scene
took place. To dart into this room, seize the rifle
and shoot the dog through the heart, was, as the
foolish novelists say, "the work of a moment." G&eacute;ant
rolled over; and after a few struggles, his ghost
howled mournfully on the banks of the Styx, provoking 
a return from Cerberus. As he stretched out
his fore-paws in a last convulsive effort, he gave
Aubrey a look so fond, so piteous, and so wonderfully
expressive, that it would have furnished Landseer or
Ansdell with a suggestion for the delineation of the
death of the ever-famous Brach Gellert himself.
Mr. Cousens staggered against the wall, sick, torn,
and bleeding. After drinking a glass of brandy,
and being assured that the dog was dead, he gave
his late adversary a kick, accompanied by a ghastly
look of detestation and a curse, and went into the
house to await the arrival of a surgeon from the
neighbouring town of Lyborough. As for G&eacute;ant,

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

he was buried about one o'clock A.M. by the light of
"a lantern dimly burning." For, as Aubrey's keeper,
a stalwart Highlander, observed, "there's a rough
lot aboot here, that needn't know he's gone, puir
fallow." In truth, long after his death his memory
served as a terror to the nailers and miners, who
were wont to stray over the grounds in gangs, accompanied 
by bull-dogs and curs, and often with a
pair of short gun-barrels, and the accompanying stock
stuck in the capacious pockets of one or other of
them. Strange to say, or rather naturally enough,
on consideration, the part of G&eacute;ant was universally
taken in the servants' hall that evening.</p>

<p>"I wish he had killed him outright," said Mr.
Tops, the groom.</p>

<p>"A nasty fellow! what rights had he to go teasing
the dog?" said Mary, the housemaid.</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, the poor creetur knowed what he
was a doing of," said stout Mrs. Wilkins, the cook.</p>

<p>"I wish master mayn't repent of it," quoth Jem,
the gardener. "Dogs know pretty well who they're
biting of. We shall have all the fruit stolen now.
If <i>he</i> arn't a thief, as the dog got hold on, may I never
grow early grass again!"</p>

<p>The gamekeeper said nothing, but he puffed the
smoke from his pipe with a great air of disgust and
anger. <i>He</i>, at least, had lost a staunch ally and
supporter. "I wish I had been there," he thought.
"He'd have let go for me, I'm just positeeve. It's
varra odd, he wouldn't obey the maister. Puir
fallow! he had dootless a strang reason for sic a
behaviour."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

<p>All this did not come to Arthur's ears; but he
thought of G&eacute;ant and his expiring look, after his
conversation with Blanche about the dashing Phil
Cousens, and the question <i>would</i> intrude itself, in
spite of his better (?) reason: "Was the friend false,
and the dog true, after all?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">A LONG ARM OUT OF THE GRAVE.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>To disinherit an idle or disobedient son is a luxury of property which
an Englishman alone knows how to enjoy in a thorough and systematic
manner. To shut one eye and look through a glassful of ruby port
or purple claret with the other, and to say, "I've cut him off with a
shilling, sir, I have&mdash;&mdash; Let him starve with the girl whom he has
chosen; yes, sir, starve!" and then to drink your wine with a smack
of the lips, and throw yourself back in self-satisfied contemplation of
the rosy future you have provided for the young couple, so far as is in
your power, is a delectation worthy of the haughty islander alone. A
French father cannot so indulge himself by law, except on the English
stage.</p>

<p>The "I've made my money, sir, and can do what I like with it"
boast, is one pre-eminently characteristic of a nation which prostrates
itself before the "gilded veal" with such splendid devotion, that were
the soil sufficiently clayey, the entire national features would be self-cast 
in mud.</p>

<p>A slighter and weaker variety of the modern "noble Roman" progenitor 
type exists in the person of him who leaves his estates or
money burdened with conditions, forfeitures, and the like. In this case
a man loves his worldly substance so well, that he cannot make up his
mind to part with it altogether even at his death. He thus leaves a
phantom to guard his treasures, a jack-in-the-box which pops up
whenever the lawyers open their tin cases, screeching out, "Aha! you
thought I was dead, did you? You're mistaken, you see!" Alas! his
name still lives in the attorney's office; it is uttered in Chancery-lane;
it is bandied to and fro like an invisible shuttlecock in the Law Courts;
it becomes not unfrequently a byword and a curse in the second and third
generations of his posterity and kind. And sometimes the phantom
outlives the substance, till there remains nothing of the property so
tied up and guarded save perchance a few empty deed-boxes, whereon
is painted a litigious name!&mdash;<i>The History of a Will. By Cramer
Whittaker. Introd</i>., vol. i.</p>

</div>

<p>IF a man be desirous of strongly perpetuating his
memory, for a time at least, in this world after his
departure, there is a more sure method than to leave

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

behind him a pillar or a monument, a "storied urn"
or an "animated bust." That is, provided he be
possessed of a large fortune in land and houses,
shares and funds. Let him only make a long and
complicated will, with half a score of codicils, and
thus succeed in stretching, as it has been called, "a
long arm out of the grave." He will be remembered,
if not with gratitude, yet with satisfaction, by the
lawyers; counsel, solicitors, and judges. He will be
constantly thought of by his family and those directly
and indirectly concerned, and his name will be kept
before the public very sufficiently by the reports in
the newspapers. Nay, it may even become a precedent 
and a household word, like Thellusson, or the
Baron de Bode: the latter a victim in a somewhat
different way to injustice and the glorious uncertainty 
of the law. There is, at least, no danger of
such a one being forgotten for some time to come.
The father of our hero&mdash;for so we suppose we must
call him&mdash;had made a will of portentous dimensions.
It had been his delight and recreation of an evening,
after dinner, when a respectable, elderly, muddle-headed 
lawyer of the old school waited on him,
time after time, and the document was concocted
by the pair over sundry bottles of port wine;
the client first indulging in a nap, with a doyley
over his head, while the old lawyer sipped, and
blinked, and cracked his walnuts, and looked wondrous 
wise, awaiting the fresh instructions of his
patron. Between them they had tied up young
Aubrey wonderfully tight. He was, it is true, left
heir and legatee to his father's estate and fortune;

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

but he could not anticipate the rents, or mortgage,
or sell, or become bankrupt, without incurring the
penalty of forfeiture. Among the old man's hobbies
was the idea that valuable seams of lead and silver
lay under the chief part of his land. Indeed, he had
spent some thousands in mining operations just before
his death. But, although his instructions to Arthur
were peremptory not to work the mines himself, but
to lease the royalties, by some singular oversight he
had left no power to do so. Accordingly, after his
death, Arthur was compelled to abandon the shafts,
in spite of the flattering prospect which presented
itself. Nothing could then enable him to lease, save
a special Act of Parliament, which he had not a
chance of getting; since the interests of powerful
neighbours, including the lord lieutenant of the
county, were arrayed against him. The old City
shipping agent, his father, fond and proud as he was
of his only son, justly considered him an extravagant
fellow, and had the worst possible opinion of his
habits of business, his knowledge of the world, and
his prudence and sagacity. True, he had unintentionally 
done everything in his power to make the
young man what he was. He was generous and
miserly to him by turns&mdash;only that the miserly fits
were the longer and more frequent. He was always
talking economy and prudence at him. He expected
him to occupy the position of a gentleman, and yet
denied him the means. He would not let him ride,
shoot, or cultivate any accomplishment, if he could
help it. He disgusted him by endeavouring to
drive him, <i>nolens volens</i>, to the Bar, for which

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

Arthur had not the slightest inclination. When
a mere child, he would torment him by calling him
Lord Chancellor, and making him recite before his
guests. One of his earliest presents was "Blackstone's 
Commentaries," and he would pester the boy
with points of law, and legal anecdotes about the
wonderful career of shop-boys and errand-lads who
became judges. He rigidly forbade him all amusements, 
tried to stop the desultory reading of which
Arthur was very fond, and stripped his early life of
every flower and green leaf which he thought would
interfere with the solid pursuit of wig and woolsack,
a silk gown and the inevitable lord chancellorship.
Often did the young man try to persuade his father
to bring him up to his own business; since to dream
of a commission in the Army or Navy was sheer rebellion 
and idiocy in his father's eyes. The youth
was sent at a tender age to a public school, and in
due time to college. At the latter he fell an easy
victim to the system of credit, which has ruined so
many impulsive and generous youths on the threshold
of life. How else could he keep the company of the
wealthy scions of aristocratic houses, which his father
expected him to do, on an allowance more suited to
the requirements and position of a Bible clerk? But
then, argued the father, "did not the late Lord
Quirkborough educate himself on eighty pounds a
year, and live to be Chief Justice of England?" Then
came the inevitable humiliating exposure of the debts&mdash;the 
bitterness, the reproaches, the harsh ratings,
and heart-burnings; after which young Aubrey was
placed <i>en penitence</i> in a City lodging, and allowed

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

three pounds a week, paid by his father's cashier,
whilst he was supposed to study the law, being duly
entered at an Inn of Court. Study the law? He
borrowed all he could&mdash;a few thousands on the absolute 
reversion of a sum of money coming to him
under his mother's marriage settlement&mdash;and he
studied "life in London," in a way that his father
little dreamt of: or the voluminous will would have
been annulled by an extremely brief codicil, and some
hospital have been so much the richer by the chief
portion of the young gentleman's inheritance.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey, senior, died, however, without acquiring 
this painful knowledge, and with a far higher
opinion of his son's prudence and conduct than he
had ever before entertained. For about a month or
so before his death, the old gentleman suddenly sent
his heir down into Devon and Cornwall to collect his
rents, an act with him of unprecedented trust and
confidence. We do not insinuate that he ever
doubted the strict honour of his son, but he had
always treated him as a child in money matters; and
although he would talk with him, and pretend to
consult him in a general way, he never suffered him
to know anything about his financial position, nor to
attain any practical knowledge of his affairs. When
Arthur met the tenantry, they were delighted to see
the young squire among them, and, by some strange
chance, they paid up their rents on that occasion
better than ever they had been known to do before.
Arthur carried the money to his father with a complete 
and excellent account. He did not even pay

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

his expenses out of what he had received, and said
nothing about them until the old gentleman questioned 
him. The latter was greatly cheered and
delighted. He inquired what his son had spent, and
seemed highly pleased when he looked at the account,
in which there was not a single extravagant item.
He paid it, and added, with great ceremony, a five-pound 
note, telling his son he had earned the money.
After dinner, to Arthur's astonishment, his father
sent out for a couple of cigars, and lighting one in
the most awkward manner, desired his son to smoke!
If there was one thing which the elder Aubrey disliked 
it was to see a young man smoke, and Arthur
had never known his father indulge in such a luxury
before. Old Aubrey knew that his son had acquired
the habit, and had often severely rated him about it.
He now informed him that, at proper time and in
moderation, such a thing might be tolerated. He
looked upon a man who smoked in the forenoon as a
scamp and a profligate; but now his son was his
guest, and he wished him to make free and enjoy
himself. Arthur could scarcely believe his senses.
A third glass of wine, and an invitation to smoke the
abhorred weed, and with the paternal participation
too. Was this a snare, a quaint artifice, to draw him
out? No, he dismissed the thought. At length his
father bade him good-night, embraced him tenderly,
and uttered a few broken words of commendation,
which brought the tears to the eyes of both. A fortnight 
passed, and the old man would not suffer
Arthur to omit a day in attending upon him. One

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

morning a message came for him to call earlier than
usual. He found his father in a somewhat excited
state.</p>

<p>"Let us take a turn in the garden," said the old
man, feebly; "I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>They walked together for about ten minutes,
during which Mr. Aubrey gathered a rose, and spoke
of its delicate beauty and wonderful organisation, of
the bounties of Nature and Providence, and of his
own approaching dissolution.</p>

<p>"I shall never see this garden bloom again," he
said.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he changed the conversation, and
told Arthur that he desired a prompt and important
service from him.</p>

<p>"I am going to the City," he said; "I want to
discharge my cashier, Mr. Manvers."</p>

<p>"Discharge Manvers?" cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and why not?" answered his father, in
an angry and querulous tone. "I have determined
to dismiss him this very day. He is a violent man,
and I want you to go with me and protect me if
necessary. I am ill, sir, very ill, and I need your
support."</p>

<p>"But what has he done, sir?" inquired Arthur;
"I thought he possessed your implicit confidence. I
thought that Mr. Manvers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen," interrupted Mr. Aubrey. "I am certain 
that he has robbed me, robbed me of thousands.
It was only yesterday that I suspected&mdash;made the
discovery. He has robbed me for years, and to-day
he must go. I have ordered the carriage, and you

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

must go with me. I am very ill." Saying this, he
leaned heavily on his son, and added, "Come, sir, be
ready!"</p>

<p>Arthur was astounded. He thought his father had
lost his senses.</p>

<p>"What! Manvers a thief? Manvers, the trusted,
confidential cashier of twelve years' standing; Manvers,
who had paid him his three pounds per week stipend;
Manvers, the type of the respectable City clerk,
who had all his father's papers, knew all his secrets,
drew all his cheques, had the control of thousands;
Manvers, whom his father had lately presented with
a hundred guineas on his recovery from a brief
illness, and who wrote a hand like copper-plate;
Manvers, the portly, the clean, with his filbert-shaped, 
beautiful nails, and white waistcoats; Manvers, 
who was so patronising to him, Arthur Aubrey,
in spite of their relative positions!"</p>

<p>He looked at his father with fear and trembling.
Had he taken leave of his senses? Was this strange
fancy the result of an overdose of some opiate prescribed 
for his complaint? Was that firm brain
softening under the terrible influence of a mortal
malady? His doubts were soon set at rest.</p>

<p>"Arthur," said his father, "you know, of late
years, I have not myself paid much attention to the
business."</p>

<p>Arthur did not exactly know this, but he bowed in
assent.</p>

<p>"I have left my books and cash matters entirely
in the hands of that man. All my deeds and papers are
in his keeping. What if he should be a scoundrel?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

<p>"But he cannot be, father," cried Arthur, "Consider, 
sir, how he is respected in the City. I have
known that man myself to be quite unhappy because
the books did not balance by a few pence."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Aubrey, "he keeps his books
beautifully, by double entry, which, strange to say, I
never understood."</p>

<p>"About three months since," resumed Arthur, "I
called at Bingley's Wharf," (the name of Mr. Aubrey's
place of business), "and I found Mr. Manvers quite
vexed and irritable. I called," he added, with some
hesitation, "for the arrears of my allowance. When
I asked him for it, the desk was covered with bills,
cheques, securities, and what not, and the cash-box
was at his side. He opened it, and showed me gold
and notes in profusion. 'Young gentleman,' he
said, 'I am sorry to refuse you; but I have no order
to pay the money from your father, who is in Scotland. 
I cannot give you anything until his return,
or until I hear from him. For all that this box
contains, I would not pay a sixpence without his
order.' I urged him in vain. I told him that he
knew it was due, but his resolution was immovable.
I told him how much I wanted the money. 'Not to
save you from a gaol,' he answered. 'Look here,' he
said. 'Do you see these figures?' And he pointed
to innumerable sheets covered with them. 'I am
wrong in my balance only threepence-halfpenny, and
I have been up all night striving to find out the
error. No, sir,' he added, 'with all due respect to
his employer's only son, John Manvers cannot endanger 
his character for strict commercial integrity.

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

That money is not available, not a penny of it, without 
orders; I would not do it to save my life.' I
then asked him to lend me a portion of the amount,
but he said he had not got it, as he had remitted
all his own spare cash to bury his father in North
Wales."</p>

<p>"He lied, sir!" shouted the old man. "Listen
to me. For the last five or six years I have been
doing twice the business I ever had, and my profits
have been smaller. With all my experience, I have
been a hoodwinked fool. I have placed unlimited
confidence in this man, and he has robbed me, I tell
you. After his illness, six months ago, I made him
a present of one hundred pounds, and he protested
that it was a boon of inestimable benefit. But Providence 
has caused him to unmask himself, and put
foolishness into his mouth to betray him. Only yesterday 
he came here on business. I was a little
better, and made him stay to dinner. He drank
more freely than I have ever known him to do, and
protested that he indulged thus, owing to his joy at
seeing me so much better. At last, he suddenly said
that he wished to ask my advice in a matter of great
importance to himself. I replied that I was at his
service. He then asked me in which railway line
I thought the safest and best investment could be
made. I answered that I did not care for any;
for that I had never been bitten by the mania, and I
judged there would be a great and sudden depreciation. 
'But,' I added, 'there is the London and
North-Western, in which I myself have some five
thousand pounds. There is not much danger there

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

to your friend&mdash;for I presume it is a friend for whom
you are anxious to invest in that particular species
of stock.' I then asked him if he would tell me
who the person was, for whom he was making the
inquiry. To my surprise, he replied&mdash;for himself.
'Allow me,' I said, 'to congratulate you, Mr. Manvers. 
May I ask how you have been so fortunate as
to receive this accession of capital?' 'Oh,' he replied,
in some confusion, 'it is a mere nothing; a few
hundreds left me by my father, who died lately, sir,
as you are aware.' 'Oh, indeed!' I replied, 'I am
glad to hear it. Well, I think you cannot do better
than invest in the London and North-Western.'
And so the matter dropped. But I knew that his
father had died a bankrupt. That man, sir, has been
robbing me for years."</p>

<p>Arthur Aubrey could not bring himself to the
same conclusion. He suggested that Manvers had,
perhaps, been lucky in one or two small speculations,
admitting fully the danger of such a proceeding on
the part of a merchant's cashier. Perhaps he had
acquired the money by some fair and simple means;
but did not like to tell all his secrets, and so had
substituted an invention, not altogether innocent or
creditable, but still far short of the elder Aubrey's
grave suspicions. The old man only shook his head.</p>

<p>"He has robbed me," he said, "and I shall dismiss
him this very day. He is a violent man, and may
resist or abuse me. You are strong, and a boxer. I
had you taught early. You must accompany and
protect your father in his old age and illness. He
has often protected you."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

Arthur sighed and acquiesced. He was accustomed 
to acquiesce in his father's views. Besides, he
was bound to support him, morally and physically,
were he right or wrong. Accordingly, they went to
the City together.</p>

<p>On the way, Mr. Aubrey was silent. When they
arrived he saluted Mr. Manvers and the other clerks,
and entered his private room&mdash;that room where Arthur
had received so many severe rebukes, admonitions,
and scoldings. The old man read his letters, and
looked at the "Times." Then he called Manvers in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manvers," he said, "is there not a cheque to
sign? Have you filled it up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it is ready," was the reply.</p>

<p>Arthur saw that it was for eight hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"You will see and pay it yourself, Mr. Manvers," 
said Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied the cashier. "I am glad
to see you so much better, sir, to-day."</p>

"I shall never be better, Mr. Manvers," was the
answer. "I see the Bank of England has raised its
discount to seven per cent. It will be higher yet.
It is a beautiful day. Will you order the carriage
round for me?"</p>

<p>And the old man, assisted by Arthur, put on his
great-coat, and left without any further observation
or comment. All the way back Mr. Aubrey was
silent. Not a word did he say about Manvers. Even
when Arthur said, "I am glad, father, that you seem
to have changed your mind," he looked at his son,
but did not reply. When Arthur took his leave, all
that he said was, that he thought he might want

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

him early the next day; and if he did, he would
send a special messenger to the Temple.</p>

<p>The next day the messenger came early indeed, so
early that Arthur apprehended the worst news. His
father had passed a wretched night, and wished to see
him immediately. On arriving, he was shown into
his father's room. He found him in bed, and was
greeted by him with feverish impatience.</p>

<p>"Reach me pen, ink, and paper," he said, "and
sit down there."</p>

<p>Arthur gave them, but the invalid required his aid
to prop him up. He wrote, however, boldly and
firmly as ever, as follows:</p>

<p class="center">"TO MR. JOHN SWINDLES MANVERS.</p>

<p>"SIR,&mdash;On receipt of this you will at once deliver
to my son, Arthur Aubrey, possession of all my property 
in your hands, with the keys of my safes and
drawers, and obey him as myself in everything.</p>

<p class="right">"EDWARD AUBREY."</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said to his son, "I expect you to
act as a man, and carry out my instructions to the
letter. If you do not, you must abide by the consequences; 
and, hark ye, I will find those who will.
You will go at once to the wharf. My carriage is
waiting. You will call Mr. Manvers into my private
room, and tell him you have my orders to take possession 
of everything, and to dismiss him instantly
on the spot. You will take the keys of his drawers,
and suffer him to remove nothing, not a letter nor a
paper. You will lock everything and come back.

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

Stay, you will first go to my bankers, Messrs. Jones,
Browne, and Jones, and ask them to recommend you
an experienced accountant in whom they have confidence, 
to commence an examination into my books
to-morrow without fail. You will agree to pay whatever 
they think fit to name for his services.</p>

<p>"My dear father," said Arthur, "what cause can
I allege?"</p>

<p>"Say it is my will. Tell him to go quietly, and
you will make an excuse for him to the other clerks.
Let him say he is ill, if he likes. Add, if you please,
that you know I have left him five hundred pounds
to assist in administering my will; and tell him, if
you like, that if all is right, as you hope and believe
it will be, that he shall have that and two hundred and
fifty pounds besides from yourself. You may say five
hundred pounds if you please; you will never have to
pay it. Go, sir, at once. What are you stopping
for? Go, I say. Be off!"</p>

<p>"But, father," said Arthur, "what if he should
set me at defiance and refuse to go? What if he
should say that&mdash;that&mdash;you are ill, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mad, sir, I suppose you would say!" cried his
father. "What then, sir? Obey my orders, or I
shall despise you for a poor weak-spirited fool. It is
not too late. I will send for my lawyers, and leave
my fortune to a hospital, and give you an annuity
of three hundred pounds a-year, paid quarterly, for
your life."</p>

<p>"There is not a man on the premises but will prefer 
to obey Mr. Manvers rather than me, should he,
as he may and probably will do, refuse to yield to so

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

sudden and extraordinary a mandate," rejoined the
young man.</p>

<p>"Arthur," said his father, "if Manvers should
dare to resist my authority vested in your person,
seize him by the throat, as you are my son, and call
in the aid of the police. Don't let him remove a
paper. Allow no subterfuge. Accept no excuse.
Not another word, sir. I order you on my death-bed 
to take that paper, and instantly to discharge
that man. Hesitate one moment, and I will never
see your face again. Nay, I will curse so faint-hearted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Arthur. "Your orders shall be
obeyed to the letter, come what may."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned to leave the room. As he
left, the old man stretched his arms towards him.
Arthur tenderly embraced his father, as tears
streamed down the faces of both.</p>

<p>"Go, my boy, and God's blessing be with you!"
were the last words he heard.</p>

<p>It was a dismal journey to the City for Arthur that
day from Dulwich. The more he thought of it, the
more convinced he felt that his father was labouring
under a delusion. Should he call and consult his
father's solicitors? No! that would be an act of
disobedience. He would do precisely as he was bid;
but deal as kindly and gently with Manvers and his
character, as he possibly could. It would be awkward, 
if the trusted cashier, the honoured servant
of his father's commercial house, should resist him.
How shocked would be his pride, his feelings of
integrity! How amazed, how startled, how grieved,

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

how enraged he would be! Then Arthur reflected
what a cipher he himself had been in that establishment, 
where his father had caused him to be treated
more like a disreputable poor relation than an only
son and heir. The consciousness of newly acquired
power was all damped by his father's desperate state.
For, after all, Arthur dearly loved, though he feared,
the old man. He began next to think what he should
do if Manvers resisted the authority with which he
was armed. The naturally indignant confidential
clerk and cashier might even dispute the authenticity
of the document he held. "I should not like to lay
hands on him," thought Arthur to himself. We must
do him the justice to say, that this reflection did not
in the least arise from the consciousness that Manvers
was not only a remarkably powerful man, but a
bruiser of considerable pretensions. Like some very
respectable, steady men, Manvers affected to know,
or did know, every notability in "fast" life, male or
female, about town. He was posted in the history
of all, for the last half-century or more, from Ginger
Stubbs and Madame Vestris to Sambo Sutton and
Mrs. (not Lady) Hamilton. According to his own
account, he had, when a very young man, a night-house 
encounter with Deaf Burke, and had knocked
the "deaf un" out of time in a very few minutes.
It is astonishing what respectable men will volunteer
in the way of confession sometimes, as to their deeds
and misdeeds of twenty or twenty-five years ago, in
their hot youth. It is true that the credibility of
this achievement only rested upon the assertion of
Manvers himself; but it made a wonderful impression

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

upon the youthful imagination of Arthur. This,
however, rather excited his combative propensities
than otherwise. Had he not held his own in a glove-fight 
with Hammer Lane, concerning which there
was no possible fiction, but a good deal of hard-hitting 
reality? Had he not, only a few days before,
challenged a whole array of draymen and brewers to
fight a fist-duel, because he had been bespattered
with grains from the establishment, as he passed by
while the carts were loading? Unable to see the
individual who had indulged in this not very agreeable 
practical joke at his expense, Arthur had rung
the counting-house bell of that eminent firm, the
Messrs. Maltby and Hopkins, and having stated
what had befallen him, requested that all the gang
might be summoned together that he might detect
the offender. Then, in spite of the enormous proportions 
of a son of Anak among them, nearly six feet
and a half high, he abused them roundly, and dared
the fellow who had thrown the grains over him to
come out and meet him like a man. Finding that
no one responded, he called them a set of dastardly
fellows, and made them heartily ashamed of the trick
that had been played by one or more of their fellows.</p>

<p>"Supposing," shouted Arthur, "that you had
spoiled the best suit of clothes of some artist, or
mechanic; some poor teacher obliged to dress well,
going his daily rounds, would you have been pleased
by that, you pitiful sneaks? Come, I'll give the man
who did it a sovereign to stand out and face me.
What, you dare not! I am ashamed of such a lot of
un-English rascals."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

<p>The men actually cheered him as he left the place,
and I fancy they never again saluted a passer-by
with a shower of hot grains. So it must not be supposed 
that Arthur would have shrunk from an encounter 
with Manvers, because of the heavy weight
and reputed prowess of that gentleman, had he not
known him so intimately and respected him so long.
But he felt that the very idea of a personal contest
with Manvers was distasteful. It was like contemplating 
sacrilege. He would about as much have
relished a solemn obligation to trip up a bishop in
St. James's-street, or to give the Lord Chancellor his
quietus with the mace on the occasion of that high
functionary coming out of the House of Lords, with
no more consideration for his person than a policeman
has for the skull of a British costermonger, or the
limbs of an "unfortunate" female who has omitted
to pay him for an unwritten license to follow her
sad vocation in the streets.</p>

<p>"There's no help for it, and it must be done,"
was Arthur's conclusion, as he entered the broad
gates of Bingley's Wharf about eleven A.M.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">HOW A PAINFUL DUTY DEVOLVED ON ARTHUR
AUBREY.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Mistrust white-headed clerks! They can be hired ready dressed by
the month, or the week, or the day. The modern British clerk is a
reflex of the modern British merchant. As a commercial and financial
rule, mistrust all outward respectability of appearance, all that looks
solid and rich; as you would magnificent offices, gorgeous furniture,
and a board-table big enough to hold Sir John Dean Paul's religious
library and the securities of &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; themselves. These
are the shallowest devices of the dishonest promoter, the scamp director,
and the general limited-liability humbug in all his phases.&mdash;<i>Notes on
the Nineteenth Century. By a Ruined Shareholder</i>.</p>

<p>MR. JOHN SWINDLES MANVERS was a portly personage, 
with an excellent judgment in steel pens, and
of considerable sapiency in various small matters of
London life. He generally wore a black frock-coat
and trousers, and a double-breasted white waistcoat
of dazzling cleanliness. His complexion was somewhat 
pale&mdash;it might have been called pasty&mdash;his
glossy hair, and, for that period, rather exuberant
whiskers, were nearly black; his teeth were regular
and shining; and his grey eyes were by no means
forbidding in their expression. Any jury would
have been impressed most favourably by his appearance. 
Altogether, he was what is called a fine man,
and in these days would have presented the beau id&eacute;a

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

either of the promoter of a limited liability company,
or of a touting shopman in St. Paul's Churchyard,
with a liberal salary for his good looks and seductive
and imposing manners. His age might have been
thirty-six or thirty-eight. He prided himself greatly
on his penmanship, and never made, or at least left, a
blot in his books. Sometimes he might be seen obliterating 
some such things with exquisite pains; on
which occasion his right-hand full shirt-cuff would
be turned up, as he wielded with a sort of counting-house 
grace the white-handled office penknife, which,
with a square and solid piece of india-rubber, was
always somewhat ostentatiously displayed on his
desk.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," he said to Arthur, laying
down the "Times" as the latter entered: "how is
the governor this morning? I trust his health is
improved."</p>

<p>The tone and manner of Mr. Manvers in making
this natural inquiry were indescribably bland and
considerate. They resembled those of the head of a
mourning warehouse in the West-end. Mr. Pettingall,
the second clerk, looked up sadly, and the rest eagerly
awaited the reply. Arthur shook his own head and
Mr. Manvers's hand simultaneously, and a tear
gathered in his eye.</p>

<p>"Will you step into your father's room, sir?" said
Mr. Manvers, persuasively.</p>

<p>It was the touting shopman's, not the limited-liability 
promoter's style of address on this occasion.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Manvers," replied Arthur; "I have
something to say to you. I wish to see you alone."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

<p>"Is it all over, sir?" said Manvers, when they had
entered, in a rapid and excited manner, and with an
anxious gleam in his eyes that might have seemed
strange to a prejudiced observer.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Manvers," responded Arthur, "my
poor father is not so well: but I hope he has yet
many years in store."</p>

<p>Mr. Manvers shook his head in turn.</p>

<p>"I fear, sir," he said, "that he will never recover.
Your father, sir, will never enter this room again."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said Arthur, "why do you think
that?"</p>

<p>"He has been failing rapidly of late," answered
the clerk; "it is only a question of days. You are
aware, sir, of the position I hold; your father's confidence 
is largely&mdash;I may say entirely&mdash;reposed in
me. I need not say that when the deplorable event
happens, you may depend upon everything being
done that may tend to soften the calamity to you.
You look sadly distressed&mdash;indeed, ill, Mr. Arthur&mdash;you 
must take great care of yourself; health is the
first blessing, sir, and if, by-and-bye, you should
think fit to take a few weeks' run on the Continent,
there is nothing to prevent it, sir, nothing. I believe
that everything belonging to your respected father
is in my safe keeping. Ah, sir, how often have
I wished that the governor had listened to me, and
brought you up to this fine business. It is a pity, a
great pity, but your interests will be carefully administered, 
as you must be aware."</p>

<p>"Mr. Manvers," said Arthur, "you are, I trust,
forming conclusions far too rapidly. My father's

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

case is not so hopeless as you seem to think. This
very morning he has acted with unwonted vigour,
considering how prostrate he has been, and he has
sent me here charged with a peremptory mandate
and a solemn duty."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," said Manvers; "and pray what may
that be?"</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Manvers," said Arthur, "my
father's peculiar views and conduct towards myself;
and you will be glad, I am sure, to learn that he has
within these last few days entirely reinstated me in
his affections and his confidence. He thinks now
that I have not yet sufficiently represented him, and
he desires to make a complete alteration in that
respect."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," observed Mr. Manvers, "nothing can
be more proper. I can tell you, that it is entirely
owing to my representations to him; I have always
begged him&mdash;I may say implored him&mdash;to treat you
differently; to make every allowance for a young
man of gentlemanly style and habits like yourself.
'You ought to treat Mr. Arthur more like a man,
sir,' I was constantly saying to him; 'considering,
too, the fortune he is to inherit.' I am delighted to
hear it, sir." And he rubbed his hands. "What
may be the amount?" he continued; "it will give
me great pleasure, very great pleasure, to cash the
cheque."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," said Arthur, dryly; "it
is not a cheque which I hold here," observing, as he
spoke, that Manvers looked inquiringly at the paper
which he held nervously crumpled in his hand.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

<p>"Oh," said Manvers, "I thought that the governor 
had come out strong at Last. Well," he
added, coarsely, "you can afford to wait now without 
much difficulty. It won't be for long, depend
upon it, Mr. Arthur. You won't see your father
here again, sir. It was only this morning that I was
talking to his barber, Jenkins, about him; and he
agreed with me that there was no mistaking the
symptoms this time."</p>

<p>Arthur felt extremely shocked and disgusted, both
by the tone and matter of these remarks.</p>

<p>"I trust, Mr. Manvers," he rejoined, after a pause,
"that both you and Mr. Jenkins are mistaken. But
to come to the object of my errand. You know that
I have been much with my father lately; constantly
backwards and forwards to Dulwich from the
Temple."</p>

<p>Manvers nodded acquiescence. For a moment
Arthur paused to collect himself, and this gave the
clerk the opportunity to say:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, very expensive, I dare say, and you
have not had your money for the last six weeks.
Ahem! under the circumstances, I shall have no
hesitation to advance anything in reason. Fifty or
a hundred pounds are at your immediate disposal."
And he made a motion to leave the room.</p>

<p>All this had grated inexpressibly upon Arthur's
feelings; and although he saw in it but a vulgar and
time-serving anxiety to stand well with the heir of
one whom Manvers evidently thought as good as
dead, it gave him courage to proceed with far less
compunction than he would otherwise have felt.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

<p>"Do me the favour," he said, "Mr. Manvers, to
sit down. I have a very painful duty to perform.
It is my father's wish, or rather order, that you
should at once give me possession of everything
belonging to him, and leave at least for a time&mdash;take
a holiday, as it were, in order that&mdash;that&mdash;my control
may be unquestioned, I suppose, and&mdash;and things be
put straight."</p>

<p>"What!" shouted Manvers, leaping to his feet,
"what did you say? Your father is raving, sir, mad,
delirious&mdash;and you, you don't mean seriously, you
are joking&mdash;ha! ha! capital!"</p>

<p>"It is not exactly the time or occasion I should
select for jesting," replied Arthur, coldly.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said Manvers; "but this is too
good. I can understand your poor father being no
longer in possession of his faculties; but I should
have thought that you, sir, would scarcely have
brought such a message seriously."</p>

<p>"My father," said Arthur, "is in the perfect possession 
of all his faculties. See here his handwriting,
as firm and strong as ever." And he held the mandate 
for Manvers to peruse, who glared at the document 
as if he would have consumed it. "I have, in
obedience to this paper, to request your immediate
withdrawal, and that you will surrender everything
into my hands as my father's representative."</p>

<p>"And do you suppose, sir, that I shall suffer you,
in obedience to the whim of insanity, to discharge
me, like an errand boy, at a minute's notice? Do you
know what and who I am, and what character I bear?
Do you think I will suffer my character in the City

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

to be ruined thus by you, sir, or your father, because
he has taken an over-dose of morphia, or because
his brain is affected by the near approach of death?
No, sir, I shall not do it. I am not such a fool. Is
this the way my honest services and hard work of
twelve years are to be rewarded? No, sir, John
Manvers is too good a man for that&mdash;his name is
known and respected in the City, sir. I have done
my duty to your father, sir." And he struck his
breast just over the silver hunting-watch in the left
pocket of the white Marsella vest, whose snowy hue
seemed to attest his integrity. "And by G&mdash;d, sir,
your father shall do his duty to me!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Arthur, "you refuse to go?"</p>

<p>"Refuse! Young gentleman, are you in your
senses to think that I shall be guilty of such folly?
I trust John Manvers knows his duty to his employer
a little better than that."</p>

<p>"Then," said Arthur, firmly, "I shall be compelled, 
much against my will, to enforce my father's
commands."</p>

<p>"And if," cried Manvers, in a transport of fury,
"I choose not to go, what then? Your father left
me his executor, and I shall discharge the trust.
What do you know of his affairs? Nothing! There
is not a man in this place who will not obey me,
rather than you. Take care what you are about,
young man, before you assail my character. Come,
come; let us understand each other and be friends.
It is evident that your poor father is nearer to his end
than even I thought."</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Mr. Manvers!" returned Arthur, loudly

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

and fiercely; "I am no child to be bullied by an
insolent and, perhaps, dishonest clerk."</p>

<p>Manvers turned pale, and made as if he would
strike him.</p>

<p>"Try and eject me from these premises, if you
dare," he cried; "you'll soon find yourself mistaken."</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!" returned Arthur, calmly. "Silence!
I say. If you attempt any villainy&mdash;yes, villainy is
the word&mdash;I shall call in the police. I will have you
up before a magistrate within an hour, and where
will your boasted character be then? It is you that
must be insane to talk thus. I tell you that I begin
to suspect your honesty, and to think that you have
really robbed my father, as he says."</p>

<p>As Arthur uttered the last words, Manvers made a
rush towards him; but sank half-way, as if completely
abashed and cowed, into a chair, and, covering his
face with his hands, burst into an agony of tears.</p>

<p>For a few moments, Arthur gazed at him with
wonder; and then his heart softened as he beheld the
distress of the man whom he had so long been taught
to respect and revere for his sterling qualities and
commercial rectitude. He had never before seen a
strong man of mature age give way in such a manner,
and sob and cry like a child.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said he, approaching Manvers,
and placing his hand kindly on his shoulder, "I dare
say it is very hard to bear. I can assure you this
mission has caused me the deepest pain. But it
can't be helped, you know; and if you will be guided
by me, you will make the best of it. I have thought

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

all along, that it is only a suspicious fancy my father
has got into his head. Leave quietly&mdash;say you are
very much indisposed. I will do everything to avert
a thought of evil. I pledge myself, in case all is
right, as I am sure it is, not only to pay you the
bequest under my father's will, but to make a handsome 
addition to it. Come, my father is waiting for
me. Take your hat; say you are going somewhere in
a natural tone, and do not return to-day&mdash;that is all.
Write a letter to Mr. Pettingall, stating that you have
a headache, a cold&mdash;anything. Come, come, Mr.
Manvers, be a man."</p>

<p>Manvers looked up fiercely at him.</p>

<p>"You do not understand this, young gentleman,"
he said&mdash;"how should you? You do not know the
feelings of a man of business, the delicacy of a City
reputation. I have served your father well and
faithfully" (his voice faltered) "for twelve years, and
this is my reward. I tell you it cannot be concealed.
Every one will know it&mdash;will point at me, and say,
'There goes Manvers, the suspected clerk, who was
turned off by a youth, his employer's son, at a moment's 
notice.' I cannot bear it&mdash;I will not. It will
kill me. Let me entreat you, sir, to reflect; to think
what you are doing. Do not commit this injustice.
Your father will be the first to repent it, and to
blame you. Tell him some plausible story, such as
you would have me tell. Say you have executed his
wishes. If he recovers, he will thank you; and if
not, you will be spared an injustice which you would
bitterly regret."</p>

<p>"I have never told my father a lie in my life,"

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

said Arthur; "even when I risked all in telling him
the truth. Would you have me commence on his
death-bed? I think you take an overstrained and
unnecessarily strong view of this matter. You can
absent yourself for a week without suspicion. I
dare say by that time my father will be satisfied.
After all, there is nothing so strange and monstrous
in his wish to place everything in his son's hands."</p>

<p>"There is more than that. Some villain has been
at work with my name, and tampered with your
father's suspicious character."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," responded Arthur, "I don't think he
has been so suspicious; at any rate, with regard to you.
It appears to me, that for years past he has confided
too much&mdash;ay, you may start, I repeat, too much&mdash;for 
any man to confide to another, alien in blood and
family ties. And now, like many men who have
been over-confiding, he has rushed into the opposite
extreme. All that I can say is, that I did everything 
in my power to persuade him not to adopt this
proceeding; but in vain, and I have now no alternative. 
Will you oblige me, therefore, by delivering
up all keys, books, and papers in your custody; in
short, all the property you hold of his in your possession?"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the reason of this?" said
Manvers. "Of what does your father complain?"</p>

<p>Arthur hesitated. At length, however, he said:</p>

<p>"I believe, Mr. Manvers, that you made certain
statements about some property&mdash;an inheritance, in
short, which did not correspond with the impression
which my father had received."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

<p>"Fool! fool! that I was," cried Manvers. "And
is this all? I can explain everything in an instant.
If you will wait a quarter of an hour, I will write
him the fullest explanation. It was a little vanity. I
did not like&mdash;in short, I told him that it was my
money, when it was that of a cousin, who has just returned 
from the Mauritius. If you will kindly take
my written explanation to him, I can never be sufficiently 
grateful. I will dedicate my life to your
service. It will save me from disgrace."</p>

<p>"If these great commercial swells," thought
Arthur&mdash;"these men whose probity is such a
cherished valuable, that they speak of it, as if no
one out of their sphere had any honesty at all&mdash;if
these men of figures and calculation will tell unnecessary 
fibs, why they must put up with the consequences. 
I cannot do anything of the kind," he
said, aloud. "Come, come, Mr. Manvers, let us
end this unpleasant discussion. I call upon you to
assist me in carrying out my father's wishes. Remember 
all you have said to me about business-like
promptness, obedience to orders," he said, cheerfully.
"After all, there is nothing so dreadful in this
ordeal. A little holiday, nothing else. You ought
to be glad of it."</p>

<p>Manvers raised his face.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are doing, young
man," he said. "Arthur Aubrey, if I go away from
here a disgraced man to-day, I shall put a pistol to
my head when I get home, and blow out my brains."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Mr. Manvers," said Arthur, in a tone
of surprise; but with less commiseration than might
have been expected from him; "this is folly, indeed."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

<p>"My blood be on your head!" cried Manvers. "I
cannot, and will not, endure this disgrace in the
City."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Arthur. "You will think
better of it. Compose yourself, and give me the
keys."</p>

<p>"In a few moments, sir," replied the other; "since
it must be so." He then requested Arthur to wait,
whilst he plunged his face into cold water. "I presume 
you will have no objection to my removing my
own effects&mdash;the contents of my own drawers?"</p>

<p>"Not a paper&mdash;not a thing," said Arthur. "Such
are my orders, and I will abide by them to the letter.
Besides, how would it look to the clerks? You will
spoil everything, as I had planned it."</p>

<p>Manvers appeared resigned; he gave up his keys,
and, walking into the clerks' outer room, he huskily
wished Arthur good morning, and abruptly retired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manvers is not very well," observed Arthur
to Mr. Pettingall. "I have advised him to go home
and recruit himself."</p>

<p>"He has been working very hard indeed, sir,
lately," said Mr. Pettingall. "Look at those figures!"
he said, pointing to sheets upon sheets covered with
minute calculations. "And then, sir, your poor
father's illness weighs upon his spirits; as, indeed, it
affects us all deeply."</p>

<p>And Pettingall hastily brushed his coat-sleeve
across his eyes, and turned away to clear his throat.</p>

<p>"Good fellow! honest, attached creature!" thought
Arthur to himself. "But I own I can't make
Manvers out. Shoot himself, indeed! Good God!

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

if he were to do so. But he never can be such a fool.
How very susceptible these City men are; how they
count all the small change of life, both in paying and
receiving. Well, making every allowance for him,
Mr. Manvers is not quite the man I took him for."</p>

<p>"Mr. Manvers has not taken the key of his
drawer," suddenly observed Pettingall. "I never
knew him do such a thing before. I think I had
better lock the drawer and send him the key immediately."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Arthur; "give it to me. Mr.
Manvers has no secrets from me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pettingall looked amazed, and seemed to
hesitate.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "Mr. Manvers would hardly
like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Arthur, "I may as well say to
you that I stand here, by my father's desire, in his
place, and that every one here will obey me as they
would do him. I have his authority here. I have
just shown it to Mr. Manvers. As I presume there
would be no hesitation in handing that key to my
father, if he requested it during the absence of Mr.
Manvers, I think I may as well retain it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, certainly. I am very glad. I
make bold to congratulate you, sir, on assuming your
proper place. Not," added Mr. Pettingall, "that this
is a time and season for congratulation."</p>

<p>And he again showed signs of deep emotion. Mr.
Pettingall had only been there for seven years; but
he was much esteemed in the office. He was a young,
short, stoutish, dark man, of very ordinary appearance, 

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

quite dissimilar from the imposing Manvers.
Arthur mentally resolved to esteem Pettingall highly
and place great reliance on him, in consequence of
his evident attachment to the head of the house.</p>

<p>"There is something in this City view of things
after all," he thought. "Poor Manvers! It is
enough to distress him, such a sudden upset. I
must make it up handsomely hereafter, if the worst
should happen, and my poor father's end indeed be
near."</p>

<p>"Will Mr. Manvers return this afternoon, sir?"
inquired Pettingall.</p>

<p>"Hem! Yes, no&mdash;really I can't say," replied
Arthur. "He is very unwell, and I told him to take
a little repose. At any rate, I shall be here in the
morning with a gentleman, who will go through the
books just as a matter of form. Kind of satisfaction&mdash;to 
you all."</p>

<p>Pettingall and the clerks looked at each other, but
said nothing for a minute or so, during which Arthur
read, or seemed to read, the "Times," which Mr.
Manvers had left on his desk. At last he said, in an
indifferent tone:</p>

<p>"Where are all the books&mdash;I mean cash-books and
ledgers of the firm?"</p>

<p>"Everything is in Mr. Manvers's custody, except
what is in actual use," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! very good," said Arthur. "I shall be here
to-morrow early. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And he shook hands with Pettingall, and went out.</p>

<p>A youthful clerk had left the office during the conversation 
above recorded; and the news had spread

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

all round the wharf that Mr. Arthur Aubrey had
been nominated to the command of Bingley's Wharf,
<i>vice</i> Manvers, who retired. When, therefore, Arthur
issued forth, at least a dozen wharfingers were in
sight in the yard. The foreman came up and said to
Arthur, touching his cap:</p>

<p>"Do you want the carriage, sir?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Arthur, "I'll walk to it, if you
please."</p>

<p>"Allow me, sir," said the foreman.</p>

<p>And whipping Arthur's great-coat off his arm, he
shambled rapidly down the yard to call the carriage
up. The rest of the men touched their hats.</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" thought Arthur, who had never
received such attention there before; "they all feel
deeply for my father's illness, and are anxious to
show it in their rude, honest way. It is very creditable 
to them. Who says that human nature is unkind
and selfish, after all?"</p>

<p>And he went on his way with a heart, though sad,
warmed by these kindly sympathies on the part of
these humble fellows.</p>

<p>"I say, mate," quoth Jem to Bill, <i>his</i> senior lieutenant, 
"don't you wish you was him? Won't he
make the shiners fly? Ain't he ready to jump out
of his shoes? I should think the old un couldn't die
quick enough like for un, eh?"</p>

<p>"It's a poor heart that never rejoices," returned
the other, with a grin. "If your governor had kep
you as short as hisn did he, I thinks as how you'd
like to hurry the hundertaker a little; and if yer
didn't hown to it, I should say yer was a hout-and-hout 

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

liar, I should! I say, wot's come over old
Manvers? I see him go out looking like a choked
pig."</p>

<p>And the pair adjourned to the neighbouring public-house, 
the Badger and Bootjack, to exchange further
comments on the probable change of ministry that
was looming in their commercial horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettingall said nothing to his subordinates and
repressed the inquiries as to the health of Mr. Manvers, 
which were rather pointedly put to him. That
afternoon, he assumed an air of reticent dignity previously 
unknown to him. As he sat on his high stool
in a meditative mood, he surveyed his more humble
confr&egrave;res in a similar abstracted, superior, mild, and
rather grand manner to that with which a Life Guardsman 
on sentry duty at the Horse Guards is wont to
contemplate a butcher's boy patting and stroking his
horse's neck or nose. It was evident that Mr. Pettingall 
was revolving vast contingencies in his mind.</p>

<p>Arthur hastened home, and found his father waiting 
his arrival with the fretful impatience of a sick
man. He exhibited great satisfaction at the result,
and immediately turned round and fell into a calm
slumber. A few days afterwards he died, after telling 
his son that he felt at peace with all men, and
confident of mercy. According to the creed of some
this was highly incorrect; seeing that although he
had conformed all his life to the forms of the Established 
Church, he was in reality, as he told his son,
Unitarian in belief.</p>

<p>"I feel," he said to Arthur, "like a traveller about
to set forth on a long journey. You will follow me

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

after an interval, and we shall see each other
again."</p>

<p>These were nearly his last words, before leaving the
world in a much happier frame of mind for thinking
that he had disposed of Mr. Manvers. Whatever may
be said to the contrary, it is certain that the affairs
of this world occupy the mind in the majority of cases
with greater force and intensity immediately previous
to dissolution than at any other time. Men seldom
feel so anxious about mundane matters, as they do
just before they are about to relinquish them for ever.
Many even make preparations for themselves, as if
they wanted a new abode, new furniture, and new
clothes. We once knew a very shabby fellow seized
with cholera, who had a perfect craving for a new
hat, scarf, boots, &amp;c., a couple of days before his
death. We remember, too, a lady who died with the
upholsterers actually executing her orders for hanging 
new pictures, and arranging fresh furniture. She
would have everything spick and span, and every
detail of domestic comfort thoroughly arranged; and
this in a new dwelling, and for no one save herself.
How frequently have moribund persons a mania for
the purchase of articles utterly useless to them! Mr.
Aubrey, however, seemed chiefly anxious on account
of his son; and he who had carefully withheld all
knowledge of his affairs from him during his life,
became painfully solicitous to give him the most complete 
information, as the shadows of death began to
darken every sense.</p>

<p>The first thing that aroused Arthur from the deep
despondency of grief was a note from the accountant,

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

in whose hands he had placed the books of his
father's establishment. The note merely stated the
fact that after a prolonged research he had found a
singular erasure in an entry of the sum of thirty-five 
pounds, and on referring to another book had
discovered that the sum was there entered as sixty-five 
pounds. This was no less than five years
before the then date. Doubtless Mr. Manvers, in
whose handwriting these entries were, could explain
this, he said. He, the accountant, recommended that
Arthur should request an immediate interview with
Mr. Manvers on the subject. Arthur accordingly
wrote. The same evening came a letter which filled
Arthur with astonishment, disgust, and grief. It
was an abject confession from the confidential clerk,
the model cashier, the honoured City institution,
whom banks would have trusted&mdash;had trusted with
thousands. Manvers stated his follies, and temptations; 
his first fall, on the occasion of this very
erasure; the misery he had undergone ever since,
and his fearful remorse. Would the son of his late
honoured master, noble and generous as he was, so
far pity and forgive him, as to allow him to proceed 
to a foreign land, and there either retrieve an
honest name, or seek a distant grave?&mdash;Arthur was
sick at heart; an early belief was crushed, and the
object of his veneration was not only degraded, but
had assumed the character of a snivelling felon!
No, he could not prosecute him, he could not place
that familiar face and that spotless white vest in the
dock. Let the villain go and expiate his crime, as
he had said. So he wrote to Manvers, and told him,

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

that if he would at once leave England, and pledge
himself never to return, he would not punish him
for his crime. We need hardly say that the pledge
was very eagerly given. Manvers wrote a penitent
letter from Liverpool; but he did not sail&mdash;at all
events, then. What he delayed his journey for, we
shall shortly see.</p>

<p>He went for a short time to the Channel Islands,
where he indulged in deep-sea fishing, as if he had
been an innocent man; and slaughtered scores of
harmless gulls, puffins, sea-swallows, and oyster-catchers, 
like a brute as he was. Thence, when
Arthur Aubrey was safely out of the way, he stole
back to London, and executed a little commission for
himself, as well as a purpose which we shall see developed 
very shortly. Mr. Manvers knew no scruples,
so soon as his City reputation was gone. He was
always a profligate at heart. The extravagance of a
woman had first led him to commit an "error" in
his employer's books; but had he escaped this
temptation, he had in him the makings of a most
respectable personage of the modern City type. What
a loss he is to the commercial world in the present
financial era! What a part he might have played
in the great Overreach and Gurnet swim! What an
official liquidator was lost in him! In America, the
finer part of his capacity was in great measure wasted.
His persuasiveness, his grand demeanour, the respectable 
side of him went for little or nothing. But
the fact is, from the moment when he lost his position
in the City, Manvers degenerated into a mere vulgar

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

ruffian. He was too dissipated and demoralised to
go in for hypocrisy a second time.</p>

<p>Strip your alderman, who now persecutes poverty
from the bench as a crime, of his civic robes, his
banker's book, and his false assumption of a virtue&mdash;Spartan 
only towards others, Epicurean for himself&mdash;and 
what shall he be? Poorer in virtue than the
lowest he has condemned. Circumstance bribes the
rogue to be honest, and drives the honest man to
transgress the law. The successful swindler is lauded
for his ostentatious benevolence, whom the canonisation 
of Ser Cappelletto* would have as suitably
befitted. If modern life is so great and complex a
lie, what must future history be! We do not say
that there is no good in the world&mdash;far from it&mdash;perhaps 
there is as much as ever; but it is wonderfully 
mixed up and confused, and is generally on the
losing side in the battle of life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">MR. PETTINGALL IN THE THUMBIKINS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">A grey-haired, unconvicted felon, who lived to prosecute a dishonest
clerk of his own in the fiercest spirit of revenge. He gave up lending
money on bills&mdash;so often as he did not like the security; and brought
up his children in the love of Mammon, the fear of discovery, and the
morality of trade. He was very much shocked at the inability of his
eldest born to keep straight in the broad path of propriety. And
truly had the father been a different man, and had he taught his son
a nobler lesson, he might have had some reason to complain of his
cruel lot. As it was, the prodigal returned one night clothed in mock
repentance and real scurvy, and with his hair cropped strangely short.
The father assigned to him a top room in the house; and though he did
not kill the fatted calf&mdash;possibly because veal was not then in season&mdash;he 
gave him food and medicines, an odd volume of sermons, a pot of
balm of Columbia, and a suit of his brother's clothes. So devoted to
punctuality did the young man become, that, so soon as he was
restored to health, he carried off all the watches of the family, together
with the silver spoons, and even his mother's trinkets, as a filial remembrance 
of his early youth. All this the father told with tears and
lamentations to a customer whom he had just plundered, by means of
false samples, of five hundred pounds. "It is hard, sir," he said, "very
hard, is it not? when he might have stayed here and done so well."&mdash;<i>Sketches 
of Character. By A. Scacciato, Esq.</i>, vol. i., p. 19.</p>

<p>MR. PETTINGALL sat in state in the little parlour,
which once he was wont to enter with his heart in
his shoes and his pen behind his ear, in obedience to
the summons either by bell or voice of the late Mr.
Aubrey, his inflexible employer. The furniture was
unchanged. There was the same crimson flock paper,
the same dingy red curtains, the same old office table,

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

the same two iron safes&mdash;a small one placed over a
large one&mdash;and the same tall, antiquated, stained-wood
escritoire, with its drawers and brass handles below,
and its dark pigeon-holes above. Thence the old
gentleman was wont to produce his bottle of sherry
and biscuit, or his medicine phial, just as it happened.
Thence had Arthur had many a single glass of wine,
when he called on the "governor." No one in that
office would have thought of declining the offer of
one glass of wine, or of expecting two, from the
old merchant. Mr. Pettingall was deeply reflective.
Before him stood a decanter of port, as if to moistify
his meditations; and a dish of filberts, as if occasionally
to afford a light distraction. A gloomy picture or
two had been added to the walls; for be it known,
Mr. Pettingall, in a very small way, was an art-collector 
and purchaser. His essays in this way had
hitherto been chiefly confined to the purlieus of the
New Cut, and the neighbourhoods of the Westminster-road 
and Hoxton. He had scarcely as yet pursued
the Shades of Rembrandt and Murillo into the more
western region of Wardour-street. Mr. Pettingall
seemed ill at ease. He looked at his watch, and
uttered something like a curse. His ill-looking countenance 
wore its most sinister expression, crossed
with occasional gleams of mistrust, fear, and doubt.
He stepped up to the old escritoire and took forth a
box of choice cigars. He lit one and puffed it impatiently. 
He then rose and paced the room. The
weather was cold, but what was it that shone on his
dingy brow? Unquestionably it was a drop of perspiration. 
He wiped it away, and listened intensely.

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

Suddenly&mdash;yes, no, yes&mdash;there was a ring at the
bell. A heavy step was heard in the passage, and
the door was opened by a tall, big man in a great-coat 
buttoned up to his ears, and with a seafaring
cap drawn over his brows. The old woman who had
followed him to announce his arrival was dismissed
with the intimation she would no longer be required;
and the stranger, locking the door and proceeding to
divest himself of a pair of spectacles, a false moustache, 
and the aforesaid cap and great-coat, displayed
the identical features of the magnificent Manvers.</p>

<p>"Hem!" he said, "devilish snug, by Jingo! and
how goes on my virtuous successor?"</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said Pettingall; "hope you're
well." If ever a lie were manifest by its very utterance, 
this was.</p>

<p>"None of your humbug," said Manvers, flinging
himself down; "never mind about my health&mdash;have
you considered what I asked you in my letter, and
are you going to do it, that's all?" And he helped
himself to a glass of wine, which he drank, and then
to another.</p>

<p>"Governor's port?" he observed; "know it well&mdash;sly 
dog, Pettingall&mdash;got the key of the cellar&mdash;got
everything as I left it&mdash;bin, No. 50, 1820 vintage."</p>

<p>"It is some that Mr. Arthur left out for me," said
Pettingall.</p>

<p>"Devilish kind of him!" growled Manvers. "More
than I'd do. Do you know what I like about you? It's
your dashed innocence, you mealy-mouthed beauty.
And you think I'm going to stand all this&mdash;do you?"
he roared.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

<p>Pettingall's face turned dingy white, a sort of
parchment hue. "What do you want with me?" he
said. "Can't you let an old friend alone? It's not
safe for you to be here, you know."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" replied Manvers. "And suppose I
make it unsafe for you too, my fine fellow? Now,
look here, Mr. Pettingall, confidential executor, and
gentleman by courtesy. Let us understand each
other at once. In the first place, am I to have those
cases or not?"</p>

<p>"How can I do it?" said Pettingall. "What
excuse can I make? It is as much as my position is
worth."</p>

<p>"Your position? <i>My</i> position!" replied Manvers.
"Confound your impudence. Do you think I am
going to stand this humbug? Say what you like
about it. I leave your excuse to your brilliant talent.
Ha! ha! <i>your</i> talent! If you can't deceive him,
curse him! you are a fool!" And Mr. Manvers
forthwith lighted a cigar, and puffed away with the
utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I will let you have the cases," said Pettingall,
slowly, "if you will promise not to come here
again and&mdash;and risk your liberty in this desperate
manner."</p>

<p>"Thoughtful beggar!" Mr. Manvers was pleased
to observe.</p>

<p>"And I will let you have the salary that was due
and fifty pounds besides, if you will accept it," said
Pettingall; "though I sell some of my pictures to
make up the sum. I shall risk everything by doing
so," he added; "but I can't see an old friend and

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

associate about to sail for America in the want of a
few pounds."</p>

<p>"And suppose I don't choose to go to America?
But come. Have you my desk safe?"</p>

<p>Pettingall nodded an eager acquiescence.</p>

<p>"And unopened?" said the other.</p>

<p>"Unopened," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What a dashed fool!" was the gracious remark
of Mr. Manvers; but as he did not specify whom he
meant, the exclamation did not so much matter.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" he added.</p>

<p>"In my room," replied Pettingall.</p>

<p>"Bring it here!" said the ex-clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettingall rose and left the room. During his
absence Mr. Manvers employed himself with a rapid
scrutiny of the contents of the escritoire, and took
a peep at a large and dingy banker's book. Pettingall
returned and put down on the table a small plain
desk, to which Manvers eagerly fitted a key. He
took out a document in a sealed envelope and turned
it over.</p>

<p>"This will do," he said. "Now then listen to me.
Are you on the square, since the old boy died?"</p>

<p>Pettingall hesitated, as if he did not comprehend.</p>

<p>"Come! come!" said his tormentor, "This won't
do with me. Do you think I don't know why you
have kept that desk and those cases for me, as I
ordered you; yes, ordered! I will stand none of
your cursed nonsense. Why what next? Don't I
know that you once indulged in a little mild peculation
yourself, you cowardly humbug? Don't I know about
Judas Levy and the little bills? Don't I remember

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

a certain day when I caught your honesty tripping?
Now, it remains with me to expose you, or not;
and by &mdash;&mdash;! it shall suit my convenience and my
interest."</p>

<p>"Manvers," said Pettingall, with livid features
and trembling limbs, "you know that I long since
replaced the few pounds, that I only&mdash;only anticipated, 
to save myself and my wife from ruin.
Since then, I swear, that with the exception of giving
you up these cases and that desk, which, after all,
are your own, I have never wronged my employer
of a penny. I&mdash;I&mdash;don't want to be dishonest. I
want to gain an independent position by the means
which are now in my power. I will be your friend,
I swear, if you will let me. But don't ask me to&mdash;to 
rob Mr. Arthur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff! Bosh!" responded Manvers. "I know
your little game; you are too great a coward to put
yourself in the grasp of the law, that is all. You
want to grow fat on commission jobs and percentages&mdash;do 
you? You want to sell the business to a Company, 
and grab the appointment of manager&mdash;you
see, I know all. Look here, you twopenny-farthing
rogue! how came you by this wine? Now, listen,
I'll have five hundred pounds within a fortnight.
Don't interrupt me with a parcel of lies. I have
looked in that book there, and I know what you have
at your command. Don't tell me you can't. I'll
teach you how, and safely, too&mdash;safe as a church&mdash;safe 
as the Bank, ha! ha! Besides, you fool! you are
only anticipating what it must come to. You can't
finger all that money, without some of it sticking

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

to your fingers&mdash;not in dust&mdash;but nuggets! Eh?
Choose at once. If you don't follow my instructions,
I'll expose you&mdash;I will, by &mdash;&mdash;! I'll write to that
conceited young sprig, though I hate him like poison,
and put him on his guard. Aha! who knows but
that he will condone my mistakes in return for the
friendly warning? Take your choice, and quickly.
Friend or foe with Swindles Manvers. At any rate
I know enough to ruin you. Pledge yourself to
follow my instructions; and I will leave this rotten
old country within a month, and for years, if not
for ever. As for him, I carry my revenge here;"
and he tapped the desk. "Some day I may make
terms with him, but not now. He will run through his
fortune fast enough, without your assistance or mine.
And then we shall see. Take your choice. You have
safe cards to play. His lawyers are ready to join in
to-morrow. They are a precious couple, I can tell you,
and no mistake. I knew old Grinderby when he visited
his clients in the Bench, and concocted many a rum
plant with Sam Stevens and Will Clark. Now, which
is it? Come, man, I am your best friend after all.
You don't want to be Lord Mayor of London all in
a hurry in these precious days, without a little jolly
swindling, do you? I say, you couldn't spare a
fellow a dozen or two of this exemplary tipple to
drink luck to his pal on the voyage to America, could
you? I'll just leave the address. Don't send too
much&mdash;say a couple of dozen, and ditto of the very
dry sherry. I'll leave you the address, my boy."</p>

<p>Pettingall sat rocking to and fro on his chair
in something very nearly approaching agony. His

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

spirit had collapsed as if with a species of mental
Asiatic cholera. Well did he know the desperate
character of the man before him, the man who
had quailed before Arthur's virtuous indignation, and
yielded tamely to right; but who cowed and utterly
terrified his mean nature and guilty conscience.
Pettingall had always entertained a sort of instinctive 
fear of Manvers, increased and strengthened by
the daily contact into which he was brought with
him in the exercise of his subordinate vocations.
He remembered too well the affair of which Manvers
had so unceremoniously reminded him; and although
he had so far atoned for the offence as to replace the
trifle he had made use of, he knew the full demerit
of its commercial bearings, which would doubtless be
done ample justice to by his unscrupulous adversary,
should he ever denounce him. It was true that
Pettingall had marked for himself an "honest," that
is, a safe and respectable career. He had hugged the
idea of becoming a prosperous and highly respectable 
member of Society. Why not? The chance
was in his grasp. Douceurs and pickings, commissions 
and bribes, to these he had no repugnance;
nay, he had well pondered on the golden harvest
which the future would open to him. The insinuation
of Manvers, that he designed to sell his employer's
interests and the business connexion of the late Mr.
Aubrey to a Company, was too well-founded in fact.
He had already spread his lines in pleasant places.
He had conceived a plan to induce the spendthrift
heir to sell Bingley's Wharf, which was not in the
entail, for a sum far below its value; and he had concealed 

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

from him his knowledge that a railway was
about to be constructed, which would come through
a portion of the premises, as well as the fact that a
most advantageous purchase might be made of some
adjoining buildings, which the elder Aubrey had
always had a hankering after, and which would
nearly double the value of the property. Already he
had induced Arthur to let a portion of the wharf at
a much reduced rent, but only at a yearly tenancy.
But as for actual embezzlement and book erasures&mdash;as 
for bold rascality, the more dangerous game which
Manvers had played&mdash;Pettingall shrunk from such a
career with alarm and dread; he desired to pride
himself on his honesty and scrupulous exactitude.
Full of the most virtuous intentions in this respect,
he actually believed himself to be one of the most
worthy, meritorious, and scrupulous men of his class
in London. He was conscious of his immense opportunities, 
and the unprecedented confidence placed
in him. He had a considerable sum in book-debts to
collect, concerning the details of which his employer
was entirely ignorant. He actually despised his
patron for such exceeding folly; and it would not
have taken much to convince him that he had a
right to plunder him of possessions and treasures
thus carelessly regarded, and left, as it were, unguarded 
in the street. How often, too, this feeling
occupies a rogue and lures him to the act of plunder&mdash;a 
combination of envy and spite mingled with a sort
of ownership grown out of the handling of the coveted
wealth, until a species of self-justification almost
arises. When, for instance, a lawyer has had the

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

custody and management of an estate, how soon
does he come to regard the owner as a legitimate
prey, an excrescence and encumbrance on his own
property! How he will undersell, and underlet, and
run up costs; to prevent the reinstatement of the improvident 
heir, or the embarrassed proprietor! And
this all in the legitimate line of business; doing, as it
were, but justice to himself, in recompense for the
trouble he has undergone! In how liberal a spirit
he will talk to the tenants, and in how territorial a
manner he will glance his eye over improvements, and
generally identify himself with the soil! In this
lawyer-ridden country, one is often obliged to bestow
unlimited confidence in men who have served an
apprenticeship to the devil and all his works; and to
place deeds in their hands, and to hand over papers
and money, without even a receipt; while they trust a
client with nothing in return. In this way, a solicitor
who has got possession of all his client's deeds, leases,
&amp;c., will actually, on reluctantly returning a single
unimportant document into his hands, write out a
formal acknowledgment that the man's own property
is restored to him. The lawyer positively regards the
owner of the estate which is managed in his, the
lawyer's, office, not only as a victim and legitimate
prey, but as an enemy, and an intruder on his own
demesne.</p>

<p>To return, however, to Manvers and Pettingall, the
big rattlesnake and the smaller reptile. Pettingall
heaved a deep sigh. His boasted integrity, his
golden, safe career, were threatened&mdash;his little empire
was overthrown&mdash;he was under the fascination of an

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

evil and a desperate eye, and the wretched little rascal
shivered and shook as with an ague. He felt that it
was in vain to resist.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" at length he
asked Manvers in a husky voice. "How can I give
you five hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough," replied the other; "five thousand 
pounds, if I were not the most considerate and
easily satisfied fellow in the world. Look you here!
you will shortly pocket among the whole lot of swag
five hundred pounds that should have been mine by
the will. Just hand over the stumpy, and you can
easily repay it, if you like to be so green. Have you
not thousands of pounds of book-debts passing through
your hands? Why should there not be a tolerable
percentage of losses on these? He will never go
into it."</p>

<p>"No," replied Pettingall; "but some one else
may."</p>

<p>"But you need not make such an error as I did,"
quoth Manvers. "You have my example to profit
by."</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," remarked Pettingall, "I expect
Mr. Macgregor, the accountant, here this very night
at ten o'clock, and it is already half-past nine."</p>

<p>It was Manvers's turn now to change colour. With
a tremendous oath, he cursed the officious blackguard,
as he called the poor man who had discovered his
villainy in the simple exercise of his vocation.</p>

<p>"Can't you square him?" he asked Pettingall.
"Perhaps he has got a large family. By-the-bye,
how many do you reckon&mdash;three or four is it?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

<p>Pettingall winced. In his vision of an honourable
reputation, the future of his boys had largely mixed.
He had thought of the free-schools, whose doors
would open to his City influence; and for a moment
he felt as if he would brave all, and set Manvers at
defiance. It was a dangerous observation for the
tempter to make. Perhaps the latter saw it; for he
immediately added, "What a pity for such a jolly
old buck-rabbit as you to run the risk of losing a
situation like this, and of being turned out of his
hutch without any chance of greens. Well, you are
safe from John Manvers, if you will only play fair
and stand the mopuses. After all, what risk is there
in what I ask you to do? Don't sit shaking there
like an idiot, or I'll double the figure. Why, the
money will be payable under the will, long before you
are even called on to render an account, and you will
have fifty opportunities of making it in the mean time
besides. I wish I had not been such a flat, that is
all. But it was my first shy that did the trick, before
my hand got steady&mdash;and now you stand in my shoes.
I remember, for a whole week after, I was just
such a snivelling, trembling wretch as you. I dared
not come near the place, much less open the books.
That's what did me. Dash it! I actually never put
the first little affair straight at all. I have had thousands 
since, ay, and spent them too. I stood to win
ten thousand pounds on the Derby once, and I nearly
made a fortune in railways; and now here I am, with
perhaps a cool thousand to the good, about to seek
my fortune in a land, where it is easier to make money
than to keep it, considerable, I calculate. Well, good-night, 

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

my boy, and don't forget the wine&mdash;the same
as we are now drinking, mind." And Manvers swallowed 
a bumper, and deliberately resuming his disguise, 
quitted the room. The fate of Pettingall was
sealed. When Mr. Macgregor came, the worthy clerk
was so far beside himself, that anything like business
that night became an impossibility. Amongst other
things, he pondered over the document to which
Manvers, in regaining it, fixed such evident importance, 
as the means at once of revenge, and putting
the screw on Mr. Arthur, as Pettingall was accustomed 
to call him. What could it be? Then came
the sickening thought of the proposed embezzlement;
for it was nothing less. That night when Mrs. Pettingall, 
being greatly disturbed by the uneasy slumbers
of her liege lord, laid her hand on his shoulder to
awaken him, as she thought, from a paroxysm of
nightmare, he leaped up in bed and prayed for mercy
in such piteous and appealing tones, that the worthy
lady was nearly frightened out of her wits. Yet it
was not conscience that afflicted the honest fellow&mdash;far 
from it; but that which in the meanest natures
so often supplies its place and is mistaken for it,
both by the subject himself and those who witness
his tortures&mdash;the abject writhings and contortions of
a selfish fear. For our own part, we do not believe
that deliberate scoundrelism, such as that which plots
and poisons, or robs the orphan and the widow, ever
<i>repents</i>, in the true and proper sense of the word.
How can it? A murderer, whom a single act has
doomed to wear the brand of Cain, may feel the
deepest repentance&mdash;seeing that his deed might be

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

an aberration&mdash;whether resulting from passion, revenge, 
drink, jealousy, or even the temptation of
money. But does a dishonest attorney, or a perjured
usurper, who has won his way to power by a thousand 
acts of deliberate villainy and atrocity, ever feel
thorough conscientious remorse? We think not.
The latter may dread the assassin; he may be appalled 
at the thought of the Deity, to Whom he must
account after death. The former may become outwardly 
religious, and delude himself and the weaker
portion of Society by affecting good works. If a
sanguinary pirate of twenty years' practice in revolting 
deeds should incarcerate himself in La Trappe,
or found a hospital for incurables, what is it but the
moral cowardice of a ruffian physically decayed?
Superstitious criminals there are, especially women,
who may believe that they can compound for a career
of subtle infamy by mere purchase. There is a
religion which finds it practically convenient and
remunerative to teach this. To a certain extent, such
persons may be sincere in deluding themselves&mdash;from
the coarsest bandit to the most accomplished intriguante. 
Undoubtedly many who are called very
wicked, and who have committed various crimes against
the law, may really be struck with a true sense of
their misdeeds, and make all the reparation to man and
Heaven in their power. But your cool, calculating,
selfish, and unscrupulous scoundrel cannot alter his
nature. Truly the &AElig;thiop may not become white,
nor the leopard change his spots. Mr. Pettingall was
essentially a dirty little knave, with a great deal of
fear in his composition. He was anxious not to incur

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

the danger of appearing in a criminal dock; but from
the first he designed to betray his master's and
patron's interests, so far as he safely could, in the
furtherance of his own interests; while wealth and
respectability were the idols which he had set up to
worship. Alas, for the uncertainty of human wishes!
The huge form of the desperate, felonious Manvers
compelled Pettingall to outstep his inclinations, and
commit the vulgar crime of embezzlement, instead
of only depreciating his employer's property by
underleasing it, and finally causing it to be undersold, 
and variously turning the very valuable business
connexion of the late Mr. Aubrey to his own profit,
instead of that of Mr. Aubrey, junior. To be brief,
in a very short time Pettingall was discovered to have
received moneys for which he never accounted, and
flung himself abjectly on the mercy of Arthur Aubrey.
Between Mr. Pettingall and Messrs. Grinderby and
Cousens, there had always been the most pleasant
business intercourse conceivable. It was, therefore,
a sharp and cruel thing on the part of that firm to
urge Aubrey in the strongest manner to prosecute
Pettingall. On this occasion Mr. Grinderby went
almost too far in the severity of his remarks and the
strength of his advice.</p>

<p>"You may do as you please, sir," he said to Arthur&mdash;who, 
by the way, had gone to his solicitors with the
most positive determination to prosecute, and, in fact,
to instruct them to get a warrant&mdash;"you may do just
as you like, sir, in the matter; but I conceive that
you are bound, in the interests of Society, to punish
this fellow. I know you may not like the publicity,

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

the trouble, and the expense. You may be inclined
to allow him to refund a portion of his ill-gotten
gains, and to follow into exile his guilty partner and
instructor, Manvers, by far the greater villain of the
two, sir, in my opinion, whom you have already
let loose upon Society, as I understand, in America.
I trust, sir, if I may say so, that as a client of this
firm you will not on this occasion show such mistaken
lenity. Nay, looking at it as a question of morality
as well as duty, I shall, indeed, regret, deeply regret,
if you take any other course."</p>

<p>As Mr. Aubrey declared himself perfectly firm,
and that his mind was fully made up to prosecute a
man who had been guilty of such base ingratitude,
there did not appear to be such strict necessity or
occasion for the strenuous advice and strong representations 
of Mr. Grinderby. The latter dwelt
greatly on the evil example set by Manvers, and
suggested that Aubrey himself was not entirely free
from blame, for not having prosecuted him, thereby
leaving Pettingall exposed to his machinations.</p>

<p>"Example, indeed!" said Aubrey, "I can see no
mitigation of his villainy in that. Do you mean to
say, that my leniency encouraged him to rob me?
That only proves him to be a blacker scoundrel."</p>

<p>"You must make allowance for the circumstances
by which you yourself surrounded him," quoth the
legal Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>These suggestions only irritated Aubrey at the
time, but they dwelt and rankled in his mind afterwards. 
Grinderby's argument was that the example
of Manvers and his impunity had corrupted Pettingall, 

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

whereas Aubrey insisted upon it that these very
things ought to have kept him out of mischief.</p>

<p>Alas! it is circumstance which impels and allures
to crime; not example which deters men from it.
We remember just after the astounding revelations
which resulted from the suicide of the late Mr.
Sadleir, whilom a Lord of the Treasury and M.P.,
being shown a quantity of handwriting and a number
of his signatures by an official in the Treasury, who
held a very responsible post. He spoke of the suicide's
career with a mingled expression of awe and wonder,
and especially expressed his amazement that a man
in such a position, and with such opportunities, should
have lost himself so entirely.</p>

<p>"Who could have thought it of him! Many a
time," he said, "he has stood here chatting with me,
and I assure you he was the last man in the world I
should ever have suspected."</p>

<p>Only a twelvemonth afterwards we called on a
matter of business on our friend.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. &mdash;&mdash; in?" we asked cheerfully of a subordinate.</p>

<p>"No, he is not."</p>

<p>"Will he be in to-day?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is very likely."</p>

<p>Such were the brief questions and answers; and
we went away with an impression on our mind that
the under-strapper not only answered us in a rude
and abrupt tone, but eyed us in a somewhat peculiar
and offensive manner. Great Heaven! the next
news we had was that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had absconded, and
the officers of justice were in pursuit of him. The

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

last, yes, positively the very last being in the world
who we should have thought was likely to commit a
folly, much less become capable of a crime. A quiet,
self-possessed, amiable, and thoroughly business-like
man; a man of law and formul&aelig;, of facts and figures.
To be sure, he was the son of a strict and severe
clergyman; and extra piety and morality seldom go
either with the personalty, the paternal blessing, or
the entail. But the surprise and the shock were
stupendous. To this day it is incomprehensible,
almost inconceivable to our fancy or belief. Yet
he had gone; bolted with a paltry sum of Government 
money; stolen it too in notes easily traced, with
a fatuity utterly inexplicable; and was taken soon
after landing in America with his trifling plunder,
and actually released; so great was the scandal,
and so small the amount. He had fled with a vulgar
and depraved companion, whom he had married, and
who deserted him as soon as he was left without
resource. And this female, who drank, and swore,
and played him false under his very eyes, had
tempted him into vicious expense, and in spite of
his capacity, his attainments, and the post which
he held, one of substantial advantage and brilliant
promise for so young a man, turned him into a
common felon, within one year after he had moralised,
philosophised, and pondered over Sadleir's colossal
frauds and the dreadful lesson of his tragical end;
with its memorials before him, and constantly recurring, 
in the exercise of his daily duties, to his
sight.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">A FLEMISH EXTERIOR OF WEBB'S FIELDS, WITH
SOME EULOGY ON LAW AND LAWYERS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The people asked for a "Code," and their rulers gave them new
Law Courts. In order that due consistency might be observed, these
were erected on a scale of Satanic grandeur in a poor and densely
populated quarter; and the inhabitants had legal, though scarcely
equitable, notice of eviction, and were left to make their own arrangements 
with the workhouse, the prison, and the grave.&mdash;<i>Chronicles of
Great Britain</i>, 1800&mdash;1900.</p>

<p>THE advice given to Aubrey by Mr. Grinderby
respecting the punishment of Mr. Pettingall, directly
operated neither one way nor the other on that gentleman's 
determination or proceedings. He felt, in
truth, greatly outraged and proportionately indignant.
Moreover, he had reason to suspect that the loss
he had sustained through Pettingall was very serious.
For, unlike those of Manvers', his peculations were
not merely direct, and applied to his own benefit;
but he had robbed him on commission, as it were.
He had suppressed and compromised debts; he had
underlet and undervalued everything; he had told his
employer that debtors were ruined, or on the verge of
insolvency, who were able to pay, and obtained from
the too easy and credulous-Aubrey (who, be it admitted, 

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

was lazy and hated business withal) receipts
in full for the payment of a mere fraction of his
just claims; he had sold off the remaining stock for
a mere nothing; he was suspected of making away
with a considerable amount of property, which could
not be traced at all; he had been party to a fraudulent
sale of Bingley's Wharf and the adjacent property,
under false and lying representations of its declining
value, whereas its value had really very much increased; 
and, lastly, he had sold and transferred the
whole business connexion of the late Mr. Aubrey,
which his possession of the books and knowledge of
the affairs enabled him to do, to the very Limited
Liability Company who had bought and taken possession 
of the premises, and with whom he had secured
himself the berth of secretary and managing director
on a salary of eight hundred pounds a-year. As,
under the old r&eacute;gime, he had only three hundred
pounds, which Aubrey had increased to four hundred, 
with numerous presents and benefactions, it
must be owned he had done well for his own benefit,
in proportion as he had ruthlessly sacrificed every
interest of his patron and benefactor. But he was
not content with all this. He actually had the greed
and impudence to bring a charge against Aubrey of
nearly two thousand pounds as percentage for collecting 
the debts! It was the resistance of Aubrey
to this monstrous attempt at extortion, which first
led to the detection of Pettingall's true character and
nefarious proceedings.</p>

<p>At first, Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens seemed to
adopt the notion, as a matter of course, that Aubrey

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

must pay this money and satisfy the claim. They
"did not see how their client could avoid doing so."
Of course, they expressed their great disgust that
such a demand should be made; but, legally, they
said that Aubrey had not a leg to stand upon. That
gentleman, however, called in another accountant,
and he went into a second examination of the books.
It was not Mr. Macgregor this time; but Mr. Playfair, 
a gentleman whose acquaintance our hero had
accidentally made, and who was a man of singular
sagacity, honesty of purpose, and possessed of vast
powers of investigation into any matter in which
figures were concerned.</p>

<p>Master Pettingall had no chance in such hands.
In a week he was blubbering on his knees at Mr.
Playfair's feet. That gentleman simply said:</p>

<p>"It is not my business to squeeze the life out of
you, or even to kick you down-stairs. I am not a man
of impulse, and I have seen a great deal of rascality
in this world. But I recommend you to rid me of
your presence in the shortest possible time; for fear
I should be tempted to go beyond my duty, and do
something which, as a man of business, I may
repent."</p>

<p>To Pettingall's attempted whinings about his wife
and children, Mr. Playfair merely said:</p>

<p>"How dare you, who have forgotten them, while
planning and plotting this heartless and wholesale
robbery, day by day, and night by night, ask me,
who am a stranger, to be so much more merciful
than yourself; and to commit an act of injustice and
dishonesty, which it would be, to intercede for you

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

with him, whom you have plundered and wronged?
Get out of the room, sir, do you hear me? and be
quick. You abuse my patience, you scoundrel, you
do. What!"</p>

<p>Here he made a step towards Pettingall, who disappeared 
in a clammy mist of terrified tears, and
with the perspiration of detected guilt exuding from
every pore.</p>

<p>It was but a very short time after his late recorded
conversation with Mr. Grinderby, that Arthur Aubrey
might have been seen by any idle office lad, or still
idler conveyancing pupil, who had nothing better to
do than to watch the movements of strangers, wending 
his way across the dingy legal barrack-yard
known as Webb's Fields, which at some remote
period we may presume had some title to that name,
towards the particular fly-trap, whose entrance was
distinguished by Messrs. Grinderby and Cousen's
illustrious names. Mr. Aubrey was deeply wrapped
in meditation, which was of an engrossing but by no
means pleasant kind.</p>

<p>Not being, therefore, at all in a philosophical
or inquiring mood, he entirely omitted to notice
the peculiar characteristics of the locality, which,
were in great force that day. He did not remark
the seedy, mildewy, whity-brown-aproned, washed-out-looking 
porters, who stood in twos and threes, as
if they had brought a message from some grim old
departed lawyer in the World of Shades which required 
no answer, and would be thankful to any one
who would send a note to the same place, and give
them sixpence to pay Charon for ferrying their emaciated 

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

spectres over the Styx. He failed to observe
the stout policeman threatening to eject a weazened
old woman of eighty years and upwards, who was
tending and guarding the toddling frolics of a very
small and dirty female child; the extraordinary
number of flaunting females, and girls, apparently
of the milliner class, who seemed to have legal
appointments in the Fields, and consultations in its
chambers; the dissipated, rake-helly fellow lounging
across in shooting-jacket and smoking-cap, pipe in
mouth; the dirty state of the windows; the pert,
lawyer-like air of the sparrows; and the tameness
of the pigeons, which fancy might easily have imagined 
were animated by the spirits of departed
clients, and fed with a sort of mild poetic reparation
at the expense of the benchers, or, rather, of the
bloated funds of the Fields. All this was utterly
unnoticed by the hurrying and pre-occupied Aubrey,
who with rapid strides bisected transversely that
dismal, old, dissipated, insolvent-looking manufactory
of legal abomination and sin. Nay, he passed unnoticed 
even the salutations of two very pretty and
attractive young ladies, who must, at least, have just
gained a lawsuit, or have received information of a
legacy; or otherwise have had some great stroke of
good fortune connected with Themis, so irrepressibly
joyous and exuberantly delighted did they seem.
Yet so bent was Mr. Aubrey on the demolition of
the double-dyed rascal Pettingall, that jovial and
free-spoken as he ordinarily was, he did not observe
the salutations and remarks lavished upon him by
these light-hearted and fair-haired demoiselles. An

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

inquiry after his maternal parent was lost in air, and
a theory advanced as to his good-nature fell for ever
dead and unanswered, so far as he was concerned.
Even an altered tone and style in their observations,
so soon as he had passed them, entirely escaped him.
The fact is, his thoughts were bent on the Old Bailey
and vengeance; and Webb's Fields, with all its past
traditions and present features, its beauties and
blemishes, its pebbly gravel, which might have been
triturated from the stony hearts of generations of
defunct attorneys long since struck off the rolls of
mortality and gone home to another, and, let us
hope, so far as their bedevilments are concerned, a
better world&mdash;Webb's Fields, with its benchers and
wenchers, its clerks and its sparks, its fogeys and its
bogeys, its knots of porters, if not its porters' knots,
its pigeons, sparrows, nursery children, dining-halls,
pump, and clock, was to him</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">A simple square and nothing more.</p>

</div>

<p>"Simple!" with its gravel cemented with widows'
tears; its pavements worn with the weary feet of
baffled litigants, heavy with ruined hopes, but lighter
for the loss of the gold which the rapacious talons of
the legal harpies therein congregating had filched
and torn away? "Simple!" with the true stories
that might be told of it peopling with ghastly shapes
and curdling with their dim and dreary revelations
the dull and misty air? "Simple!" with <i>fi. fa</i>. and
<i>ca. sa.</i> whispering in the gusty breezes that whirled
the dust of dead men's bones, and yellow parchments,
and unswept offices in your face, and echoing by

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

night the shrill scream of oath from the slums that
border the greater portion of two sides of the
parallelogram, whose corner-stone was surely laid
by a prince, the "Prince of Darkness" himself,
who "was a gentleman" by Act of Parliament, be
it understood? "Simple!" with its interminable
web of delay, and malice, and form, and falsehood,
and robbery, and deceit, through which the wealthy
suitor may flounder, but the poor client leaves his
empty sucked-out case, and brittle shiny wings, with
which he flew in, either unawares, or because he
couldn't help it, or was a fool, like the poor gilded
fly? "Simple!" with all those hungry business dens,
and their remorseless occupants within, writing and
copying like grim and galvanised Death to feed their
grimmer and grimier life of sin, "to eat and drink,
array themselves, and live?" "Simple!" with those
strange supplementary haunts of eccentric penury,
and cheap and vulgar debauchery which fill up the
vacancies of this charming abode, and people its
windows with stray lights, when the greater portion
of the legal denizens have washed their talons towards
dinner-time, and gone home to the bosom of their
affectionate families in suburban squares?</p>

<p>This is Webb's Fields, as some view it; but by no
means all. We suppose that the young widow of a
drowned sailor regards the sea with different eyes
from Miss Clementina at Margate, with a volume of
Byron, Bulwer, or Marryat in her hand. This is the
jaundiced view of a man of griefs and losses&mdash;of one
who has known what it is to wait weary hours in a
lawyer's office, when the clerks look sneeringly at

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

him, and say audibly one to another: "Oh! it's only
old Sadcase, him as lost all his property in that suit&mdash;you 
know&mdash;Weasel <i>v</i>. Sadcase, in which Serjeant
Squeezer made that famous speech. It's in the last
volume of Scribbler and Squitty's Reports." This is
the view of the plundered and cleaned out; the out-at-elbows 
client with a sick wife and large family,
who want port wine and sea air, and possibly better
food and more of it, and who had been rich, but
for the common practice of Webb's Fields. Bless
those lively young clerks, it is no more to them than
dissecting to an enthusiastic Sawbones, when he is
appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Guy's! This
is nothing but a mere morbid view taken by broken
clients and ruined men. It is not shared in, believe
us, by prosperous gentlemen, and those who can
afford to change their lawyers and tax their bills.
Yes, it is upon the carcass that the legal vulture
principally thrives and feeds. You, my lord, and
you, madam, with your ample fortune, may not
appreciate, or even understand, this bitterness of reproach, 
this minute description of things and of places
unknown in your experience. Your sleek family
solicitor is a pleasant and comfortable personage.
He only now and then puts you out of temper;
because he delays your daughters marriage settlement, 
and is so unconscionably slow in the re-investment 
of that mortgage money of yours which has
been paid back so long. You don't suspect that he
is playing with the money. Oh dear no! He is far
too trustworthy and respectable a man. We hope
for your sake that his speculations may never entirely

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

go wrong. Until then, you will continue to consider
our delineation of human spiderdom harsh, exaggerated, 
and untrue. We trust, fair sir and proud
lady, that you may never have cause to alter your
opinions. Whether we ourselves have suffered or
not from the iniquity of the legal system and practice,
we shall not tell. Suffice it to say, that we have seen
enough of their workings to adopt the black and
morbid view, which we have just now endeavoured
to convey.</p>

<p>But then we go much further than suffices for the
condemnation of a mere portion of the attorney gang.
We denounce their whole existence as a national
blot, as an excrescence, and an unnecessary evil, of
pernicious and fungus-like growth. We say that the
whole standing or sedentary army of "solicitors," as
they are called, ought to be abolished and put down,
not only on account of individuals, but the State.
Here in England, we have nearly twenty thousand
men apprenticed from boyhood to the master and
originator of all evil and wrong, creating and fostering 
enmity, malice, uncharitableness, in order to produce 
litigation in its worst forms of injustice, absurdity,
and excess. Worse than this, the elections of the
whole country are in their hands. Who practises,
and shields, and encourages corruption and bribery,
direct and indirect, but your solicitor? Who knows
the secrets of the rich and great, and bullies and
persecutes the poor and the small? Who goes about
like a lay Jesuit spreading suspicion, disunion, hatred,
and mistrust in all circles? Who widens the breach,
nay the gulf which unhappily exists between classes,

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

between the higher and the middle, and the lower
classes of the community? Who is the curse of town
and village, of city and farm-house alike? Who
but the legal agent and inquisitor, the rich man's
prompter to harshness, and the poor man's deadliest
foe? Who, when a man is down in the world,
counsels his creditors to lose more money, rather than
give him a chance to retrieve his fortunes, or ever to
get his head again above the slough of ruin and
despond? What is the answer to the agonising plea
for time? "I can do nothing in it. It is in the
hands of my solicitor." It is not so in America, a
new country&mdash;it is not so in France, an old one.
At least there is nothing so universal and so bad.
And what does the solicitor do besides, in the capacity
of active curse? He is an obstacle in the way of all
rational reform; all cheap transfer of land, or personalty; 
all simplification of titles, and leases, and
wills; and the easy and common-sense recovery of
debts. He is the foe of equity and compromise, and
recovery of every kind, save "fine and recovery," and
concurrent monstrosities of form. All this is nothing
new, and yet it is not so very old. It is not so very
long, since the birth and growth of the modern
attorney-at-law out of the old scrivener and notary.
Why should not men keep their own deeds, and make
their own transfers, purchases, sales, mortgages, and
the like, with the aid of law-writers, and public registrations, 
and the best counsel to be had direct, depending 
on success and character for reputation, whose
fee should be paid by the client himself; ready
money, or credit, just as may be settled between the

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

pair? The counsel might say at once, "You have
no case, my man;" or, "I advise you to make the
best terms you can;" or, "I'll fight your cause and
see you through it. You shall pay me so much, if I
succeed; if not, nothing." What monstrosity it is,
that an attorney can recover his bill of costs, whilst
an advocate has no remedy! What a mighty hotch-potch 
of iniquity the whole system is; and how it
withers and depraves many of the finest energies and
qualities of tens of thousands of Englishmen. The
most beneficial use made of solicitors is by rogues.
They profit by all the chicaneries and worst features
of the law. The best education for a swindler is a
legal one.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby was an excellent and enthusiastic
lawyer. To him the law was what it is to too
many, the study of malevolence, avarice, trickery,
and legalised fraud.</p>

<p>THERE is no sentiment or feeling in the administration 
of British Law. In civil cases, the longest
purse generally wins, especially when coupled with
the most unscrupulous practice. In criminal cases, it
is an excellent thing to have plenty of money, not to
bribe the judge, but to purchase the whole panoply
of just or unjust defence, and, above all, to command
that consideration, commiseration, and interest which
money always insures in this mercantile country.
How much better your "alibi" looks, if you have
twenty thousand pounds! How much less probable
does your alleged crime appear, if you are worth one

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

hundred thousand pounds, more or less! What chance
has a needy suitor or defendant when pleading before
a well-to-do and respectable Themis! Truly Justice
is blind in England, and holds the scales. You may
have been victimised to any extent by a lawyer,
made penniless and driven mad by chicanery and
delay, and it shall avail you nothing; since you cannot
legally introduce this into the case, and place it on
record in due form. Nay, the judge will instruct
the jury purposely, that they must not allow themselves 
to be biassed by anything which does not form
part of the strict issue before them. "You must
dismiss from your minds the facts incidentally brought
before you that the plaintiff seduced the defendant's
wife, after ruining him by the most complex conspiracy; 
that he spent moneys intrusted to him on
parole, and sold him to all his enemies. The question
is, does the defendant owe the plaintiff six shillings
and eightpence on this transaction, or did the prisoner 
knock the prosecutor down, or call him by an
actionable term?"</p>

<p>In France, the whole history is elicited by the
Court by a series of interrogatories, and circumstances 
are taken into consideration. There, a man
is allowed to have a heart, feelings, and passions.
There, systematic scoundrelism is exposed and dealt
with. Here, it is favoured by the friendly intervention 
of the Law. In France, if we are informed
aright, "of lawyers and notaries there is no end" in
the galleys of Toulon. They are not fenced round
with impunity, as they are here. There are single

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

lawyers in the galleys; they ought to link "firms"
with a connecting chain. They are clothed in
coarse canvas trousers and shirts, branded with their
numbers (as they put their real or imaginary clients'
initials on their tin boxes), and they wear a woollen
jacket to keep them warm during the remainder
of their earthly career. "Their faces, close shaven,
bronzed by exposure to the sun, and brutalised by
crime, are fearful to behold;" and "their repulsive
appearance is heightened by their hair being notched
short in lines running round the head, in order to
facilitate their recognition, should they escape."
This is what they do with dishonest lawyers in
France. In England, it is different. We were
about to say that there are no dishonest lawyers
in England, that is, judging by the results to themselves, 
not their clients. Perhaps the converse of
the proposition is nearly true. The present laws
of England, however, seem principally to be made
for rogues. "Who," wrote, in effect, a powerful
journalist, some years since, "prevents that scoundrel
from being taken by the neck by the police, as in
France, and dragged before the Tribunal within an
hour? Who but these execrable difficulty-makers,
the lawyers?"* "The law itself is too weak for the
lawyers; they defy it, obstruct it, ignore it, render
it futile and abortive;" that is, when it suits them
to do so. Even to take a whole department as a
specimen, "Doctors' Commons threatened to be immortal, 

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

until the Doctors were guaranteed compensation, 
when they discovered that they were a superfluous 
nuisance, and abated themselves."</p>

years ago. We can only quote from fragments without dates.]</p>

<p>But how does England deal with her erring legal
pets, the too funny "gentlemen by Act of Parliament," 
who now and then o'erstep, in their zeal for
practice, even the wide limits which they have assigned
themselves? Pentonville and Portland are not their
just destination, unless they steal pocket-handkerchiefs 
or spoons, which would argue a want of success
in their legitimate professional career.</p>

<p>"A solicitor convicted of wilful and corrupt perjury!" 
(See daily papers.) This is really distressing.
We thought that such agreeable latitude was allowed
in the exercise of the calling. This man being convicted 
must be more honest than many of his fellows.
He has had to do with other attorneys, and they have
been too much for him.</p>

<p>"The Liquidator of the Bogus Bank, limited, <i>v</i>. two
Attorneys." In this case the Court evidently recognises 
fraud; but, for some motive, through some distorted 
freak of the judicial mind, lets the afflicted
beings off.</p>

<p>"The Lord Chief Justice '<i>regretted</i>' " (Did he
now?) "that attorneys should mix themselves up in
schemes for concocting Companies. Such duties were
not <i>strictly professional</i>" (Indeed!), "and said that
such companies are mere delusions, by which the
public are induced to invest money, which is spent
in legal charges and in winding-up the undertaking," 
&amp;c. &amp;c.*</p>

<p class="small">[*The above was literally said. The lawyers in question thus idly
branded by the judge, not only got their costs, but a large sum for
promotion out of the Company, and escaped without even the mention
of their names!]</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

<p>Such are among the notes and remarks we find in
our Diary of the blank day of blank, A.D. 1867.</p>

<p>If an ordinary person, guilty or not guilty, is
accused of any crime whatsoever&mdash;if he is the manifest 
victim of threatened extortion&mdash;does the Press
conceal <i>his</i> name? We suppose that in the last case
we have quoted, either it is a special privilege of
attorneydom, on its trial, not to be named or specified; 
in which case it is a gross and monstrous
anomaly and folly; or the newspapers were afraid
lest these interesting legal Siamese Twins should
commence all manner of proceedings against them.
We have seen this sort of thing before. When an
attorney has to show cause why he should not be
"struck off the rolls," the same delightful reticence
is observed. The interesting victim of rabid and
vindictive clients, this boa-constrictor worried by
rabbits, this hyena lugged bruised and bleeding into
court by new-born babes, remains anonymous, more
unknown, probably, than the author of "Junius;"
because, unless you are fortunate enough to know
very few solicitors indeed, you cannot even guess
at his name. Why this insane forbearance, this
corrupt buffoonery on behalf of "gentlemen," who
know so well how to take care of themselves as your
attorneys? It is simply a part of the abuse and
absurdity of the whole British system of Law, from
base to apex of the pyramidal iniquity built with the
skulls and bones of thousands and ten thousands of

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

victims to the rapacity, extortion, avarice, delays, and
complex injustice which the Law prescribes, encourages, 
necessitates, defends, and practises.</p>

<p>What is a solicitor?* we ask. It is a word of
modern date. It is meant perhaps to be more genteel
than the word attorney. Or, was it devised in order
to divert attention from the original birth and existence 
of our "legal friend"? The atourney would have
been the champion in the lists, of those who could not
fight for themselves, in the days of chivalry. Fancy
a real attorney in our sense existing in those times!
Such a one fought by proxy for the minor, the sick
person, the aged and infirm. Thence he came to be
the licensed representative and interpreter of the
ignorant: of those who towards the latter part of
the Dark Ages could neither read nor write. He appeared 
for Higg and Snell, the offspring of Saxon
serfs. Are we still so benighted and ignorant as to
require such services now? He would seem to have
shown the cloven foot very early; since we find that
by the Statute 32 Hen. VI., it was enacted that
there should be "but six common attorneys in Norfolk, 
six in Suffolk, and two in Norwich, if that shall
seem reasonable to the justices." Again, we find in
"An exact Abridgement of all Statutes in force and
use from Magna Carta until 1641, by E. Wingate,
of Grayes Inne, Esq.," published in 1660, that "if
an attorney delay his client's suit for gain, or demand
by his bill more than his due fees and disbursements.

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

the client shall recover against him his costs and
treble damages, and he himself shall be for ever disabled 
from being an attorney or solicitor any more."
This would make fine havoc were it really acted upon
in the present day. You tax a solicitor's bill now,
and must get a large proportion disallowed, or have
to pay the costs of taxation. But whatever you get,
it does not invalidate a modern attorney's practice.</p>

<p class="small">[* It means especially the lawyer who practises in equity, but the
terms are now confounded. Every attorney is "&mdash;&mdash;, Esquire,
<i>Solicitor</i>."]</p>

<p>Again, "If an attorney be found notoriously in
fault, he shall forswear the court, and never be admitted 
in any other court."</p>

<p>"Notoriously in fault!" What now-a-days comes
up to, or does not come up to, this phrase? We presume 
that it is far too severe to characterise the two
attorneys whom "the Lord Chief Justice regretted
should mix themselves up in schemes for concocting 
Companies," which "are mere delusions, and by
which" (he said) "the public are robbed, while nothing 
is spent, save in legal charges and in winding-up 
the undertaking." At all events, even their names
are held sacred, while that of any one not belonging 
to this privileged class is by no means thus
shielded, on a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> charge, whether he be
guilty or not guilty of anything imputed to him.
When fraud and artifice are reduced to a system, in
order to plunder under the mantle of respectability
and the protection of authority&mdash;and this in every
circle and department of a country, public and private
legislative representation itself being for the most
part in the lawyer's hands&mdash;what must be the issue?
The evil increases, until it would seem that nothing
short of revolution can shake the demon off the

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

nation's neck. And how much more deadly and dangerous 
the revolution, which should arise from a web
of oppression and injustice spread over all classes, than
that which the iniquity of a single tyrant or succession
of tyrants and their ministers might engender? It
would be like a nation rising against itself, and no
one could foresee the solution or the end.</p>

<p>Among the many facetious stories told of the appreciation 
in which attorneys have been held is the
following, which, however well known, we do not
scruple to give here. Peter the Great, Czar of Muscovy, 
being in England in Term time, and seeing
multitudes swarming about the Great Hall, wherein
are held the three superior Courts of judicature, is
reported to have asked some one about him "who
all those busy people were, and what they were
about?" Being answered, "They are lawyers, sir."
"Lawyers!" returned he. "Why I have but two in
my whole dominions, and I design to hang one of
them the moment I get home."</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, there is more amusement to be
derived from the consideration of a plain English
statute, when statutes were plain, taken in connexion
with what has been the reality of the case nearly ever
since, and what the state of things is now. By 4
Hen. IV., c. 18, it was enacted that "none should
be admitted, but such as were virtuous, learned, and
sworn to do their duty." The virtue of the craft&mdash;whatever 
they may swear to, like the Sultan at his
installation as a Knight of the Garter&mdash;is, we should
think, on a par with the philanthropy of a crocodile
or the vegetarianism of a shark. Again, the Statute

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

(An. 1403) recites this item: "For sundry damages
and mischiefs which have ensued before this time to
divers persons of the realm by a great number of
attorneys, they shall be good, virtuous, and of good
fame."</p>

<p>The subject is very tempting for a jest. Attorneys
could at one time only employ two clerks (<i>vide</i> Maryham's 
"Complete Collection of Statutes relating to
Solicitors"). We do not know if that law has been
repealed; but probably it has. If not, they break the
law with impunity in this, as in many other things.
The 33 Hen. VI., c. 7 (1455), recites "a practice of
contentious attorneys to stir up suits for their private
profits."</p>

<p>Even in those days we learn that people "dared not
complain of y<sup><span class="small">e</span></sup> extortions and y<sup><span class="small">e</span></sup> oppressions" of the
attorneys. By the 3rd Edw. I., a penalty on any
attorney was inflicted for <i>deceit!</i> He was imprisoned
for a year and a day. It has long since been permitted
that a lunatic may appear by attorney; and a whole
nation of lunatics avail themselves of the privilege.
An attorney formerly could not practise in gaol.
Heaven knows what they may or may not do now;
since the fraternity have managed to wriggle out
of almost every penalty and disability formerly imposed 
upon them. But we cannot help thinking
that a gaol would be a very proper place for
many to practise in, but not on behalf of their
clients.</p>

<p>Formerly under-sheriffs were not allowed to be
attorneys. This has been repealed, 1 Vic, c. 55, like
everything else that stood in the way of chicanery and

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

wrong, under pretence of "amendment and consolidation." 
Heaven save the mark!</p>

<p>In a speech of Lord Bathurst in Parliament in
1737, he is reported to have said, speaking of the
causes of riots and tumults, and referring to the insurrection 
of Wat Tyler, that "the people complained
that their domestick enemies, the lawyers, ruined
them with vexatious suits and extorsive fees." This
he gave as one of the chief reasons for that rebellion.
This evil has been going on ever since; it is at this
moment greater than ever. Politically the lawyers
are corrupting the whole State. Their fraud, oppression, 
and corruptions, are assisting to bring about
revolution now. Since these evils cannot be, or are not,
amended or reformed, they will bring about a violent
deliverance, if they do not destroy the nation as a first-rate 
power. Parliament is chiefly returned by lawyers.
Lawyers draw the bungling Acts of Parliament,
through which they themselves teach men to break.</p>

<p>No man is so much afraid of the law&mdash;even such
as it is&mdash;being brought to bear upon himself and his
own alleged or imputed misdeeds, providing it be by
a sufficiently rich man&mdash;as a lawyer. The reason of
this is obvious. If by some miracle the attorney has
justice on his side, he knows that he may be cast by
the law; if he has acted wrongly, he is instinctively
reluctant to be exposed. Nevertheless, almost every
one shrinks from attacking a solicitor. Yet we have
known one, soundly thrashed and kicked before his
own clerks, to put up with the inconvenience and
indignity, without applying to the police, or even
commencing an action. The attorney now-a-days is
a most important part of the social system of Great

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

Britain. Fifty years ago, he was still kept somewhat 
in check. Barristers were tabooed, and struck
off the bar-mess, who were found guilty of "hugging,"
or even associating with attorneys. Judges snubbed
them, and kept them in order. They were frequently
ordered out of court. Lately, when Mr. Chisholm
Anstey acted as judge in India, he dealt with what
he considered to be fraud rather harshly, i.e., justly,
and the whole legal set combined against him. Here,
in England, the power of this abnormal and wholly
unnecessary, unconstitutional, and <i>illegal</i> body, is
enormous. It undermines all Society; it is a standing 
menace against honesty, and union, and peace
among men; it exists and flourishes by the practice
of the basest acts and the lowest trickery. Woe betide 
him in temporary difficulties, he shall never lift
up his head again! The simplest business is protracted 
and delayed in the cruellest manner. A
lawyer wants all your deeds and papers. You send
them to him. He runs you up and delivers a bill of
costs. You object to it; he retains your papers&mdash;you 
go to another lawyer, who, ten to one, will not
press him, and they both plunder you. These are
the mildest cases. On the other hand, rich creditors
place their debts in their lawyer's hands, and then
will listen to no proposal for time from a debtor who
is only desirous to pay. They refer you to their
lawyer; the lawyer back to his client. The debtor
is the shuttlecock, and it ends with a writ and its
consequences. The client may lose his money in
ruining the debtor, and does it all under his lawyer's
advice. We have known enormous expenses incurred

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

in a client's name, whose estate was in the lawyers'
clutches, whilst he was starving. There is a daily
correspondence about him which costs pounds. He
visits his own property on foot, and speaks to a tenant.
The tenant leaves him to touch his hat to a man in a
brougham. He asks who it is. It is a solicitor's
clerk. He is sent there that day to go through a
farce of pretended inquiry, because the office has a
clerk at leisure, and business must be made. A man
has a legacy left him and is ruined by it. A case
like this has been painted by Charles Dickens. And
the beauty of it is, that these very lawyers do not
pretend to understand law or equity. They state a
case for counsel, which you must not do for yourself.
The counsel's fees are not recoverable, forsooth; and
a lawyer sues his client thus for money which he has
not disbursed and possibly never will pay. Counsel
do not <i>always</i> receive the fees which solicitors have
charged and received on their behalf. Why are the
honour and honesty of this especial class of men to
be blindly trusted to&mdash;they who give no trust? If
you take your deeds to a solicitor, he lays his legal
paw on them as a matter of course, and while you
owe him six and eightpence, he keeps them. If you
want, in the mean time, to look at one of your own
leases, you are lucky to get it the first time you call,
and the solicitor insists on a receipt from you! But
is the guild, the body, without stain or suspicion even
of enormous criminal frauds? By no means. Look
at that case of Cheslyn Hall, a wonderfully "respectable 
and eminent practitioner," some time ago. But
why particularise one? Attorneys, if they can manage

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

it, always spare men of their own profession, or rather
trade. It wouldn't be desirable, they say, to press
matters too far. They don't advise their clients to
prosecute, or go to law with an attorney.</p>

<p>We have spoken of trade. What is attorneydom,
save a trade, and that of a not very exalted character?
They don't sell you law, at least, not directly&mdash;they
go to the barrister for that. They sell you forms of
law over an imaginary legal counter. They are not
even as apothecaries to surgeons or physicians, for
the latter send you to the former, but the solicitor
consults his physician for you. He poisons you with
his legal drugs under the cover of superior advice.
These men, who, half a century ago, hardly or seldom
ranked as gentlemen, who did not presume to call
themselves "esquires," who could not get into a
respectable club, now affect not only gentility, but
exclusiveness. Yet they are admitted into Society,
as we once heard remarked, like the knaves among
the court cards of the pack. We saw lately the case
of a low provincial fellow of this description who, in
defending a dishonest cad against a just claim,
addressed a letter to a neighbouring squire, and
colonel commanding a regiment, "Mr." So-and-So.
This insolence is common in the trade. The solicitor,
who sells forms and procedures of law like a cheesemonger 
(only that the trade is not so direct or honest),
gives himself airs, keeps his clients waiting in his
ante-room purposely, and acts generally in a manner
which one hundred years ago would have caused him
to provoke and receive a batooning or a hearty kicking. 
Things are changed, and we have made such

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

astonishing progress! Have we? Yes, certainly, in
some things. Railways, for example. Apropos of
these, there is the tourist solicitor. You cannot leave
him behind anywhere. <i>Post equitem sedet atra cura;</i>
you travel second-class on account of that enormous
lawyer's bill which you have just received. Your
solicitor travels first-class, for the same reason.
Attorneys are always going express <i>somewhere</i>, and
we fear that the country is going with them.</p>

<p>It is of no avail that the dramatist and romancist
are continually holding up the mirror, and telling us
what a pattern scamp the modern solicitor often is.
Look at the varieties of the breed. You have the
money-lending solicitor, the military and clerical
solicitor, the thieves' solicitor, the gaol solicitor, and
the solicitor, par excellence, of women of the town&mdash;the 
legal adviser of felony, and of the "Social Evil."
"Social Evil," indeed! Attorneydom is <i>the</i> "Social
Evil" of the age. And these men are not to be
exposed by name!</p>

<p>Once more, "In <i>re</i> an Attorney (in the case of
the Bogus Bank, limited) <i>v</i>. two Attorneys." These
masked gentlemen have probably got a swinging bill
of costs out of the plundered shareholders of the
Bubble Company which they themselves, the said
attorneys, entirely "concocted," besides the promotion 
money. But "oh, no! we never mention them,
their names are never heard." My Lord Mortgage,
or Squire Cashless, clients of a firm thus protected
by the amenities of a swindling era, reads perchance
a report in the papers headed as above, without the
slightest consciousness that his own legal advisers and

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

"eminent" solicitors, are the very identical pair of
"concoctors" described.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he says, "how fortunate I am in
commanding the professional services of men beyond
suspicion, like Cuttle, Cuttle, and Fyshe."</p>

<p>Yes, beyond suspicion, when their names are thus
concealed; but let Lord Mortgage and Squire Cashless 
look out! They shall never extricate themselves
from the legal embrace of Messrs. Cuttle, Cuttle,
Fyshe, and Co., till there is nothing left of them save
dry bones. In the mean time it is refreshing to know
that the elder Cuttle gives most delightful parties
in Tyburnia, that his charming daughters were lately
presented at Court, that the elder son of Fyshe is
a field-officer of Volunteers, and keeps a yacht off
Erith, and the younger rides a white Arab in the
Park.</p>

<p>As for stealing spoons and forks, we can hardly
imagine such straightforward and comparatively innocuous 
wickedness as simple burglary or larceny on
the part of an attorney who was likely to succeed in
his trade. Yet one lately <i>was</i> tried for this sort of
offence. It might have enhanced his legal merit and
embellished his fall, if he had sent in a bill of costs
to the party robbed&mdash;say some old lady client&mdash;including 
such an entry as, "To consultation with
Bill Sykes and another outside your area gate, when
we decided not to attempt anything that night,
six shillings and eightpence." "To conference with
your servant-girl, when she stated the locality of
your plate-chest and where you kept your keys,
thirteen shillings and fourpence." "To long interview 

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

with Mr. M'Pledgit, the pawnbroker, when he
informed us that your silver was so old-fashioned
that it was only fit for melting down, and it was
finally decided that it should go to the melting-pot,
one pound one shilling. To cabs, refreshments,
bribes, postages," &amp;c. . . . .</p>

<p>Again, the solicitor may tell his client falsehoods,
not white, but of the blackest dye; but he will be
hardly such a bungler as to commit perjury, if he be
worth his salt, unless the temptation is very overpowering 
indeed. Falsehoods! The current mark of
the trade is falsehood and pretence. The vexatious
and ruinous delays of a solicitor's office are three
parts of them sheer invention and palpable lies.
When he lends you Miss Pokeby's, an old lady's,
money on mortgage, and insists upon six per cent.,
is it not his own capital that he invests on such
favourable terms? You have to call twenty times&mdash;he 
can't see her&mdash;she has gone out of town&mdash;she is
unwell&mdash;her money is at a bank on deposit, and she
had to give notice. He grins and rubs his hands;
he enjoys the agonies of your suspense. He is running 
up a swinging bill of costs, besides getting
six per cent., and charging you twice his legitimate
plunder. There is an expression, "Honour among
thieves." There is a sort of necessary honour, even
on the Turf in its present degraded state. There is
none necessary to attorneys. On the contrary, it is
dishonour on which they thrive. Look at the respectable 
West-end firm of Walker and Walker.
They have persuaded their client Perkins to get
judgment against a man in temporary difficulties,

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

who only wants time to pay, and who offers <i>proof</i>
that he is raising the money to satisfy the claim of
the obstinate British tradesman Perkins. They write
to that debtor: "Dear Sir,&mdash;In answer to your letter
we have to inform you that we have seen our client
as to your request for time. Will you oblige us with
a call the first time you are passing?" The debtor
sends a friend, who is followed by a couple of Jew
bailiffs, posted at these "respectable" solicitors' door,
to arrest the debtor, should he call in the expectation
of the friendly arrangement they have suggested.</p>

<p>A man in temporary difficulties was lately sued for,
let us say, one hundred pounds, by the eminent City
firm, Guffin, Runnacles, and Bunks. He got the
money, and called on them directly after judgment
was obtained. He asked one of the legal triad whom
he saw whether they would take seventy pounds down,
and the remainder in a month, as it would be a great
convenience. "If you will be kind enough to sit
down for a few minutes," was the answer, "we will
send over to our clients" (a banking firm close by),
"and ask them. I have no doubt they will accede
to your request, sir." The "Times" was given to
him to read, and he waited an hour. During that
time the legal "gentleman" came in some three or
four times. "Sorry to detain you so long," he observed. 
"The bank partners must be engaged."
And he conversed quite amicably. At last he came
in, and said very sharply, "Our clients are not in,
sir. You'd better settle this in the proper quarter.
It's out of our hands." "Oh!" says the debtor,
"will you not take the money, then? If I must do

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

so, I am prepared to pay all." "You'd better settle
the matter elsewhere," was the reply; and the attorney
opened his door, outside of which a sheriffs' officer
was waiting, who had been sent for, in place of the
pretended bank message. The officer himself said
it was "sharp practice," and "anything but gentlemanly 
conduct" on the part of the firm; but his
prisoner had to proceed with him to a place of detention, 
until detainers were searched for, &amp;c. &amp;c. Had
it happened that there were heavy detainers, these
solicitors would have lost their clients' money. A
short time afterwards the same partner in this gentlemanly 
triad was forced to hear the truth, and
threatened with a horsewhipping by an officer in the
army, whom he bound over to keep the peace. The
officer told him that he was "a liar, a scoundrel, and
a swindler," which in these days is oftener a greater
offence than to merit those titles. And this was a
most "respectable" and "eminent" firm!</p>

<p>These are samples of a body of men who, having
got rid of all the conditions, restrictions, and penalties 
imposed upon them, when their fraternity was
inaugurated, and their first practice allowed by a hesitating 
and cautious State, have gradually wriggled
out of the observance of all salutary and precautionary 
restraint, as snakes cast their skins, until
they are now coiled round every institution, public
and private, throughout the land. The attorneydom
of the nineteenth century is worse than the priesthood 
of the Dark Ages; for this reason, that it
thoroughly degrades the national character, and
undermines and injures all truth and principle,

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

honour and integrity, justice and morality. It has
a finger in every pie, a hand in every business, a grasp
upon all property, the garotter's clutch on the owner
of nearly every estate. Such an abuse has it become
that it makes Magna Charta valueless, and freedom
a mockery and a joke. As for the Law, upon which
malpractice is founded, it is a huge&mdash;we had well-nigh 
said chaotic&mdash;mass of rotten and pernicious
absurdity, from a newly-established County Court,
where the amusing farce of petty oppression and chicanery 
might tickle the risibility of a vulgar and malignant 
Diable Boiteux, up to the heavy dead-lock of
an appeal to the House of Lords, whose select senile
conclave of three solemnly toss the legal halfpenny&mdash;in 
jest or earnest, which is it? Let the victims tell.
If the money only lasts, and their lordships are
equally divided&mdash;that is, out of four, we will say, two
are asleep, and of the other two one has been judge in
a previous stage of the same affair, then counsel may
invite the withdrawal of the judgment of the junior
law lord present.* Let us imagine such judgment to
be on the plaintiff's side, it is he who thus elects to
be in a minority, and he can then "allege error in
the record," and "submit the whole matter for
review to the Court of Exchequer," &amp;c. &amp;c. where
there are four law lords, it is evident that each party
may win two tosses&mdash;one cries "heads" twice, and
the other "woman." There <i>are</i> two "heads," somewhat 
the worse for wear, and two "women," old
women, perhaps. What is to be done? Begin again,

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

my noble sportsmen! You must not shoot off ties,
so recommence without drawing your stakes. It is
not, however, the law which we are anxious to touch
upon. We only say that the wilderness is suited to
its jackals, the disease to the vermin whom it produces, 
and by whom it is produced.</p>

<p class="small">[*<i>Vide</i> "the Slade case," which will doubtless form a distinguished
precedent of high-class litigation. Since settled, as it might and
should have been at first, by the parties concerned.]</p>

<p>Is there no remedy for all this? Assuredly. Let
common-sense and self-preservation, let the Press and
Parliament intervene. Let the advocate be restored
to his position. Let the solicitor drop his name and
business, and become the scrivener and law-writer,
and the attorney for the ignorant and illiterate protected 
by heavy penalties as before. There should be
no idle counsel, no nominal barristers seeking for
patronage or place. At least, the examinations should
be made such as to insure the highest talent at the
Bar. There should be a Supreme Court as in America.
Counsel should be permitted to see their clients. A
distinguished Counsel might keep a staff of fifty clerks
and law-writers, if he pleased. Only let not these
men be licensed practitioners, vultures, kites, and
harpies of the law. Suppose that a client comes to
some great Counsel. He is told that he is too busy to
see him, and betakes himself elsewhere. This would
prevent that which so often happens, the acceptance
of a brief by a great man, who cheats&mdash;yes, cheats
his client by never reading his case, or uttering a
word for him in Court. Let us suppose that he sees
him and hears a verbal statement. "Well, my good
man!" he says, "you have no case, or you have a
case. I will undertake it, or I will not undertake it.

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

You had better not go to law, or you had better fight
it out. You have a defence, or no defence." Or, he
might say, "Go to one of my scriveners and reduce
the facts of your case to writing. I will then give
you an opinion." It would be quite fair to make a
bargain, in the case of a poor man, or any man&mdash;why 
not? It must be remembered that the barrister
would depend upon his character as well as ability
for a great business. It may be said that this could
not be done in the present voluminous state of the
law, and with our ridiculous forms of sale, transfer,
mortgage, together with the complication of precedents, 
and the ponderosity and obscurity of title-deeds. 
Of course not. We want a code, we want a
perfect system of registry for all titles, mortgages,
sales, transfers, &amp;c. &amp;c., and we want simplicity of
form. Without this, attorneydom must continue to
flourish, like the upas-tree, surrounded by the dead
and dying virtues and moralities of the nation, and
the bones and carcasses of the thousands of victims 
whom it has robbed and murdered. In these
days, if a man steal your purse, he does not steal
"trash;" he takes that without which a good name
goes a very little way indeed; nay, without which it
very often ceases to be a good name. For now, more
than at any period in the world's history, money
makes the man. We do not speak of those whom no
amount of money will make happy, or educated, or
content, or well. We do not mean those who have
enough to live upon, and who can afford to despise
riches. But we speak of those who are stripped of

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

all; and when the lawyers once get a good hold of
you, they seldom leave you, whilst anything remains
to be engulfed in the legal maw.</p>

<p>There are honest attorneys of course. The aloe
flowers, but not often. Your honest solicitor is as
common as a black swan, when the Roman poet
wrote. We include "Writers to the Signet" in
Scotland, who may be supposed now and then to
produce a swan, black or white, amongst them. We
ourselves know a most praiseworthy firm. They have
a sound and extensive practice, and can afford to be
what they are, conscientious, and even occasionally
Quixotic and generous. Their charges are high to
those who can afford to pay, but the article they sell
is good, and may be depended on. Doubtless, the
conscious partners will blush when they read this
eulogy. Nathless, could we pronounce the doom of
the craft, not even for the sake of these would we
save all, and say, "peradventure there be fifty
righteous found." After all it is the system, not the
men, against whom our observations are levelled,
and as we have written in the interests of our fellow-citizens, 
we pray that this gentle satire may be so received 
and understood.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE SPIDER IN HIS DEN.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">" 'Justice?' " said that brisk little elderly counsel, Mr. Phunne, who
is making a very good thing at the Bar. "I should have thought you
knew better than to talk of that. Law is much more powerful than
justice, don't you know? Ha, ha!" and he laughed a merry little
pleasant laugh. " 'Nonsuit?' Of course the plaintiff was nonsuited.
Why, Serjeant Gabbleton had only five guineas on his brief, and he
wasn't paid even that. 'Then why did he take it?' Well, I can't
exactly say. But he got finely complimented by the Court for the
manner in which he behaved. I dare say it has paid him well enough.
'New trial?' Don't he wish he may get it? Where's the money to
come from? 'Ill-used?' I should think the poor wretch was. Bless
you, you should have heard what his own junior counsel said to me in
Court. He thought <i>he</i> was going to conduct the case. But Gabbleton
came in at the last moment. 'Never read his brief?' I dare say not.
Why should he? That was the last thing he wanted to do. 'Burning
shame?' I don't say it wasn't. But Gabbleton knows what he is
about. He is as clever and rising a man as there is going. 'You'd like
to expose him?' Pooh, pooh! So would a good many, I dare say.
Are you the Quixote of universal humanity? Ha! ha! ha!"&mdash;<i>Everyday 
Conversation anywhere</i>.</p>

<p>MR. AUBREY was not quite so long in reaching
Spider-court as we have been in recording a very
brief portion of his journey thither. The buildings
were of redbrick, and of modern date. We forget the
history of their erection; but it is rather pleasing to
imagine that there was a fire there at some period,
which caused a portion of the Fields to be rebuilt.

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens had their names
painted in large white letters over a black door. This
was, doubtless, a necessity; but rather a contradiction, 
since their names were, or ought to have been,
blacker than any door, whether it led to Chancery or
the infernal regions. One naturally thought of the
business of the place, to turn black into white, and
the reverse, by all the arts of falsehood.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey gave a smart double rap, and was
duly admitted by an unwholesome clerk.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Cousens in?" inquired Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I'll see, sir, if you'll step in."</p>

<p>As if he didn't know; but this is part of legal
etiquette and caution. So he wrote a name on a slip
and took it in.</p>

<p>"Ah! Aubrey," quoth the cheerful voice of Phil
Cousens, stepping briskly out of his room, attired 
in a dark cut-away coat and black-ribbed
trousers, with shiny boots as usual; "step in, step
in!" And he rubbed his hands. "Punctual, eh?
Grinderby will be disengaged in a moment&mdash;got a
painful case&mdash;woman in tears, children, and all that.
Deuced nuisance&mdash;can't get rid of her. Well, how are
things in Queen's-square? Mrs. Aubrey well, I
hope? Sold the bay nag yet? Here" (to clerk,
whom he had rung for during these questions, to
which Aubrey appropriately responded), "tell Mr.
Grinderby that Mr. Aubrey&mdash;no, say the gentleman&mdash;is 
here by appointment, will you?"</p>

<p>"Have you arrested the scoundrel yet?" asked
Arthur, as soon as the clerk had disappeared on his
errand.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

<p>"Well, no; but he is all safe, ill in bed."</p>

<p>"It's a mere pretence. He'll give you the slip
yet!" cried Arthur, who, like many very amiable
men, was furious and impatient when his anger was
aroused. "I really do wish that you would be a
little more energetic, Cousens. Most clients wouldn't
stand such inattention to their wishes. I really
wonder Mr. Grinderby should be so slow about a
thing like this."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," replied Phil, "don't be so impatient. 
I assure you no time has been lost. You
know what a safe card Grinderby is, especially in
such a matter as this. I dare say all is ready, and
the arrest can take place this very afternoon, if you
like. Stop! Perhaps you are in a hurry; I'll call
him in."</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Cousens opened a door as if to go
in search of his senior partner; but, on second
thought, he went out another way, leaving the door
which he had opened slightly ajar, no doubt accidentally; 
if lawyers ever do anything accidentally in
business hours, except make mistakes in their charges,
but never in their clients' favour. It should be stated
that Mr. Cousens could communicate with Grinderby
either through the clerks' office, by which way
Aubrey had entered, or through a small room which
led to the den of the head of the firm.</p>

<p>That gentleman duly made his appearance with
Cousens, in the course of a very few minutes.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Aubrey," he said, after the usual
salutations, "and what are we going to do with this
fellow Pettingall?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

<p>"Nay," replied Arthur, "I came to ask you what
you had done. I am anxious that the matter should
be delayed no longer."</p>

<p>"You know what I think, Mr. Aubrey," rejoined
the lawyer; "but of course you will act as you
please. It is not our duty, or, I may add, our desire
to influence a client in such an affair. Prosecutions
are expensive, and our motives might be misunderstood. 
People are always ready to impute blame to
the profession, whatever happens. We are your
mere agents, sir&mdash;your mere agents to carry out
your views, always provided that it is fitting and
legal to do so."</p>

<p>"Then," said Aubrey, good-humouredly, "I wish
you would carry them out, and as speedily as
possible."</p>

<p>"I will, however, go as far as this, as I think
strongly, perhaps too strongly in a professional point
of view, in this matter&mdash;I will say, Mr. Aubrey,
that I greatly deprecate any consideration which you
may think fit to extend towards this man Pettingall.
I am aware that you cannot replace the loss&mdash;for I
fear he is worth little or nothing&mdash;but the base ingratitude 
of the man has shocked my feelings,
blunted as they ought to be, and, to a certain extent,
are, by the experiences of a profession which too
often brings us in contact with the worst, the vilest
of mankind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Grinderby," said Aubrey, interrupting 
his dyspeptic Mentor's harangue, "I don't think
you need say one word to prompt me to a sense of
duty. My mind is made up, and I never felt more
inclined to be firm."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

<p>"I rejoice to hear it, sir," observed Grinderby;
"but I hope you will not be offended, if I tell you
that I cannot place quite so much confidence in your
firmness as I could wish. Your heart is too good,
sir, much too good for this world. Excuse me, I am
a lawyer, and an old one; and I have seen so much
of these things. I have studied the amiability, the
goodness&mdash;the&mdash;the, if I might say&mdash;the sentimental
generosity of your character, and I said to Cousens
this morning&mdash;did I not, Cousens?&mdash;our client, Mr.
Aubrey, will not prosecute this man. And I have
my fears&mdash;I say my fears, and my doubts still."</p>

<p>"I told him I knew you better," said Phil to
Aubrey. "Soft-hearted, I said, he may be, and has
been, God knows, enough. Look at his noble conduct 
towards that rascally Swindles Manvers, but he
will never be such a fool as this would come to. I
said 'fool,' didn't I, Grinderby?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, sure enough, Mr. Cousens," replied
the other, "and I reproved you for using such an
expression. Every gentleman has a right to do as
he likes in such a matter; and if Mr. Aubrey likes
to be robbed and plundered with impunity, he can.
We have no right to dictate to him. Nor did you
speak so confidently until this morning. Come!
come! Mr. Cousens, tell the truth. Didn't you say,
only yesterday, that you felt positive Mr. Aubrey
would never prosecute this man? Ask him!" he
added, addressing Aubrey, and pointing to Cousens,
who sat nursing his knee and looking at the lustre
of his inevitable patent-leather boots. "Didn't you
tell me only yesterday, sir," continued Grinderby,

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

addressing his partner, "that you were afraid&mdash;yes,
afraid, sir&mdash;that our client, Mr. Aubrey, this gentleman 
present, would not act with firmness on this
occasion?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did say I did <i>not</i> think he would prosecute," 
was the answer; "but I think better of it
now."</p>

<p>After delivering himself of this opinion, the accomplished 
Phil commenced picking his teeth, although
before lunch-time, and consequently in mere anticipation 
of a tough chop at the Crow in Fleet-street.
But the fact was Phil had just started a gold toothpick; 
a present, as he said, from a lady client. If
that assertion was true, it was really a pledge of
affection, as Phil assuredly bought it at a pawnbroker's 
in a neighbouring lane. Perhaps the lady
was his cousin.</p>

<p>"I don't know, gentlemen," said Arthur, rather
haughtily, "why you should be pleased to think me
so weak. I came here to prosecute, and prosecute
I will; even though you make it distasteful by
urging me in such a manner, and paying so bad a
compliment to my good sense."</p>

<p>"No offence, Mr. Aubrey&mdash;no offence, sir," said
the elder partner. "Goodness of heart, although
mistaken and in the extreme, even to condonation of
the blackest crime, is all that Mr. Cousens has ventured 
to impute to you; and surely this need not
anger you, sir, as I hope it does not. But it is my
duty&mdash;yes, my duty&mdash;to advise you against a step
foolish in itself, and which, if frequently indulged
in, would uproot the foundations of Law and Society,

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

and make us a community of robbers&mdash;yes, of
robbers and thieves."</p>

<p>"Upon my word," replied Aubrey, "this is utterly
uncalled for. I have come here, I tell you, for the
purpose of prosecuting this scoundrel, as he deserves."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it, sir," said Grinderby,
rubbing his hands. "I trust, I beg, I entreat you
not to relinquish your purpose."</p>

<p>Here he rang a bell, and a clerk duly appeared.</p>

<p>"Is that person gone?" he asked, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, sir; she said she would wait till you are
disengaged."</p>

<p>"Order her to leave the office instantly," thundered
Grinderby. "Mr. Cousens, sir, will you see to
this?"</p>

<p>That gentleman, with apparent reluctance, shrugged
his shoulders, and left the room <i>vi&acirc;</i> the clerks' office.
In about two minutes he returned, when sobs and
exclamations in a female voice were plainly heard
from the adjoining apartment, the door leading to
which had, as we have stated, been accidentally left
ajar.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Phil. "Go yourself, Grinderby. 
I can't stand that sort of thing. I never
could. Poor soul! poor soul!"</p>

<p>Grinderby rose, took a pinch of snuff emphatically,
and said, addressing Arthur:</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a few moments. I have no such
tender scruples; but my junior partner here is too
much devoted to the ladies to be proof against a few
female tears. I shall send for the police, if necessary,

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

Mr. Cousens. They, at any rate, are not likely to
display a sickly sentimentality."</p>

<p>Saying this, Mr. Grinderby left the room.</p>

<p>"The police!" observed Cousens, as the door shut
on the head of the firm&mdash;"the police, indeed! They
are not likely to display any scruples in such a case,
mournful as it is. A policeman would lock up his
own sober old mother on a night charge, and enter
her as 'drunk and incapable' on the charge-sheet for
five shillings, or swear that his own sister&mdash;libel or
no libel&mdash;was a street-walker, in order to gratify his
inspector, and prove himself a smart officer. Isn't
that your opinion, Aubrey?"</p>

<p>The misdoings of the police were a great hobby of
Arthur Aubrey's; and he would have expatiated on
them for half an hour, only that his curiosity was
piqued, and, let us add, his manhood aroused, by the
idea that a woman was in tears and distress, and at
the mercy of old Grinderby, whom at that moment
he particularly disliked.</p>

<p>"May I ask," he said, "is it any secret who the
person is whom I hear sobbing so frightfully?"</p>

<p>"Well," responded Cousens, "I don't know what
Grinderby will say, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" interrupted Arthur, "I don't wish you to
reveal the secrets of the prison-house. I have no
right to inquire about a thing that don't concern
me."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Cousens, "it <i>does</i> concern
you. I differ from Grinderby, so far, that I can't
see why you should not know all about it. I don't

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

think we have any right to hide it from you, and why
should we? Grinderby was making signs at me all
the time not to tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Concerns me!" exclaimed Arthur, "and not tell
me? A woman's voice in grief? What does this
mean, Cousens?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is," said the other, "just before
you came, we had a visit from Pettingall's wife, poor
devil! and her four children are with her. Grinderby
ordered her out; but the woman was faint, and so I
showed her into the clerks' second room, and let her
sit down. Unfortunately you came in, just as the
door was about to be opened for her exit. She heard
your voice, and insists upon seeing you."</p>

<p>"Well, and why not, pray?" inquired the client,
rather angrily.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said Cousens, bringing the gold
toothpick into active show, "Grinderby is of opinion
that you will relent; that you can't stand the water-works, 
and the babies, and all that sort of thing.
Grinderby is a stickler for justice; and in this case I
must say I am with him; and he thinks you had
better not see Mrs. Pettingall and her 'kids,' and I
am decidedly of his opinion. That's about it," quoth
Phil, who could not quite separate the phraseology
of his unofficial life from the language of conventional
attorneydom. In fact, when Grinderby was not present, 
Phil's style of conversation resembled that of the
professional gentlemen employed at the once notorious
Judge and Jury Club, presided over by the late Chief
Baron Nicholson.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

<p>At this moment, hysterical screams were heard,
mingled with the cries of children. Mr. Cousens rose
suddenly, saying:</p>

<p>"Confound it, how came the door open?"</p>

<p>And he shut the side-door just as Mr. Grinderby
made his reappearance by the other.</p>

<p>"Most irregular and improper," said that gentleman. 
"Pray excuse me" (to Arthur), "there is a
woman in hysterics. I told Jenkins to empty the
contents of the water-jug over her, and I have sent
for a policeman. Now, Mr. Aubrey, I am at your
service. You wish an immediate arrest, I presume?
I congratulate you on the determination, sir; quite
right, very proper indeed."</p>

<p>And the grim and dyspeptic senior rubbed his
hands.</p>

<p>"Stop," said Arthur; "I understand that there is
a person who&mdash;that woman, in fact&mdash;wishes to see
me. I do not know why I should be denied to her
without being consulted, Mr. Grinderby."</p>

<p>"Have you mentioned to our client who the party
is?" asked Grinderby, addressing his partner in a
very emphatic manner.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. Cousens, "I don't see how I
could help it exactly. We can't treat a gentleman
like Mr. Aubrey as if he were a child. He asked me
who it was, and I told him."</p>

<p>"And he did quite right, Mr. Grinderby," said
Arthur, indignantly. "I shall see Mrs. Pettingall.
I am not one to shrink like a coward from an unpleasant 
interview on this or any other occasion.
Why should I not see her?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

<p>The West-end partner whistled, and Mr. Grinderby
gathered up his papers.</p>

<p>"It is contrary to my advice, my strongest exhortations, 
Mr. Aubrey," said the latter; "but I
have no more to say. My belief is that you will
yield to the solicitations and hypocritical whining of
this woman, if you see her; therefore, we had better
defer taking instructions for a prosecution until that
event has taken place. In the mean time, perhaps
you will excuse me for a few minutes."</p>

<p>And so saying, Mr. Grinderby bowed and left the
room for his own particular den.</p>

<p>Aubrey walked up and down.</p>

<p>"Why should I not see this poor creature, victim
of her husband's crime?" he said. "I am not a
Minister of State to be denied thus; I am not Grand
Lama of Thibet or Emperor of China, whose presence-chamber 
cannot be approached save by approved 
embassies. Why should I refuse, in the name
of common courtesy and humanity, to see her?"</p>

<p>"You had better not," quoth Phil.</p>

<p>"Pray why?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Phil, "you are such a devilish
soft-hearted fellow, that if you do see her, you will
never prosecute her infernal husband, that's all."</p>

<p>"You seem to think me very weak; but when
I tell you that my mind is made up, and that
nothing can shake it on that head, perhaps you will
cease these very unpleasant remarks. I tell you
frankly that I think Mr. Grinderby went unnecessarily 
a great deal too far."</p>

<p>"With the best intentions," said the other.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

<p>"As a legal adviser, probably yes," rejoined
Aubrey; "but, even professionally, beyond the
mark."</p>

<p>"It can't matter to us," said Mr. Cousens, "in a
professional point of view. Of course <i>I</i> always speak
and act as a friend into the bargain. Now, just do
be advised, and let me send this wretched creature
away."</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the reply; "Arthur Aubrey is not
one to shrink from a scene, however painful, when
he thinks his duty as a man and a Christian is
involved."</p>

<p>"Then," said Phil, "I'll just tell the lady that a
man and a Christian will see her&mdash;that is, if she is
not already gone, as I rather think she is." So saying, 
Mr. Cousens left the room. "No such luck!"
he said, with a grimace, on returning; "she has just
come to, poor thing! They have wetted her bonnet-strings 
rarely, and there is a constable sitting by the
stove ready to eject her if necessary."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," said Arthur, "I think it perfectly 
brutal to send for one at all. Here is a poor
creature come to plead for her husband, and you
treat her like a felon! Let me see her at once, if
she has come to see me; though I cannot let her
husband escape the penalty of his ungrateful fraud,
I may soften the blow to her, and perhaps do something 
to save her from starvation and the streets.
Come, let me see her at once."</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens shrugged his shoulders, pocketed his
gold toothpick, and led the way.</p>

<p>We will not ask our readers to witness the very

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

painful scene which took place, but will now peep
into Grinderby's den. He sat writing for about a
quarter of an hour, as if quite indifferent to Aubrey
and all his belongings, at the expiration of which
period Mr. Cousens walked in.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the senior.</p>

<p>The gentleman addressed laughed heartily, and
sat down.</p>

<p>"Is it all right?" inquired Grinderby.</p>

<p>"As houses," was the response. Had it been any
one else, he would have said "as a trivet," or "as
nails;" but "houses" had a legal and substantial
sound.</p>

<p>"He won't prosecute," quoth Grinderby.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Cousens; "neatly managed,
I must say; very neat, indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"A prosecution in this case, Mr. Cousens, would
not suit the firm."</p>

<p>"I don't think it would, precisely," replied the
junior partner of that firm.</p>

<p>"This woman is worth a Jew's eye," said Grinderby. 
"She's none of your instructed and doctored
sort. I thought she would have pulled my coat
off this morning, as if I were an angel of mercy.
Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>There was something so ludicrous in the notion of
old Grinderby as an angel of mercy, that Phil's eyes
were almost blood-shot when he recovered from a fit
of laughter.</p>

<p>"It was exceedingly well contrived," continued
Grinderby. "The thing was to get them accidentally
thrown together, and to offer all the opposition we

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

could. I hope, Mr. Cousens, that your client is not
offended by what I said. But do you feel certain of
the effect? Arc we not building too surely on his
weakness?"</p>

<p>"A dinner at the Radnor!" cried Phil, "against
the balance of the widow Tomkins's estate, after our
costs are deducted. Here it is, seven pounds, seven
shillings, and fourpence halfpenny, out of two hundred 
and ninety-two pounds, eleven shillings, and
threepence."</p>

<p>"The balance, after all payments of debts, funeral
expenses, and other liabilities whatsoever!" responded
Grinderby.</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," rejoined Mr. Cousens, "as
you generally are. Such is the amount which the
firm will hand over to the widow at the latest possible
date. Egad! I shouldn't wonder if she were sued
for the cost of her mourning yet, before she receives
it."</p>

<p>"I trust," said Grinderby, with dignity, "that you
do not mean to impute undue delay or severity to the
firm?"</p>

<p>"To the firm, yes," replied Phil, grinning; "but
not to either of us. What a fine thing is this
amalgamation of interests! As a member of the
firm I protect your interests, when, otherwise, I should
neglect my own. As a member of the firm, you do
the same by me."</p>

<p>It is thus that a money-lender always knows a
"party," who may be prevailed on to advance a sum
at usurious interest. The "party" is the remorseless
being who sues when the accommodation bill is "duly"

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

dishonoured. We have known "my friend," who
does the needful, actually abused by one of the
fraternity, for asking more than sixty per cent., and
for issuing a double writ with more than usual
promptitude. " 'Pon honour, it's too bad," says
such a one. "I tell my friend he's too greedy; but
what's to be done?" And he afterwards laments the
remorselessness of his "friend" in selling up the
borrower's furniture without an hour's delay, after
his promissory note has become due, under a bill of
sale. Nay, he will go through the form of promising
to remonstrate with him&mdash;"upon his soul he will"&mdash;and 
does it without the slightest success!</p>

<p>Grinderby and Cousens understood each other,
both collectively and individually, just as well as a
money-lender estimates the avarice and vindictiveness 
of "his friend." About twenty minutes more
elapsed before a clerk knocked at the door and informed 
Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens, that Mr.
Aubrey had left the office, without expressing a wish
to see either of them, after sending for a cab and
placing Mrs. Pettingall and her children in it. The
firm exchanged looks, and when the clerk had retired,
it burst into a fit of laughter, which lasted some
little time, the only difference between the respective
cachinnation of its members being, that the senior
partner indulged in a silent, and the junior in a loud
style of laughter.</p>

<p>"I think you would have lost your bet, Mr.
Grinderby," at length observed the sprightly Phil.</p>

<p>The only reply was conveyed by the medium of an
exhaustive pinch of snuff.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

<p>"It's all serene," at length quoth Phil, with vast
delight.</p>

<p>"I wish, Mr. Cousens," said Grinderby, "that you
would not indulge in slang, at least during business
hours. With your style of dress I have long ceased
to interfere." And he regarded, with a slight elevation 
of his iron-grey brows, his partner's elegant boots,
which that gentleman happened at the time to be
gazing at with the most triumphant complacency.
"But," added Grinderby, "I wish you could make
it convenient to attend divine service at least once on
the Sabbath. As a member of the firm, sir, you
would find it greatly to your advantage; much more
than by frequenting, as I have been pained to hear
you still do, that disreputable resort of thieves and
prostitutes, the Escurial, which is doing more to
demoralise the middle and lower classes of this country
than a dozen Haymarkets."</p>

<p>"I really think," answered Phil, "that the firm
has nothing to do with my private life and pursuits;
and as for church, I should like to know who is the
spy upon my conduct on Sundays."</p>

<p>"The firm, sir," replied Grinderby, "requires that
you should at least preserve the common decencies of
life; and let me tell you, that attendance at church
has its commercial as well as its heavenly aspects.
Oh, Mr. Cousens, think of your immortal soul! Spare
a little time to put in an appearance in the Court of
Common&mdash;I mean, of Divine Justice. That inestimable 
woman, Mrs. Grinderby, has long lamented
your heathenism to me. 'Depend upon it, Mr. G.,'
were her words this very morning, 'the young man
can never prosper who neglects his pew as Mr.

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

Cousens does.' Why, sir," continued Grinderby,
with animation, "I don't believe you have looked
into the inside of your hat these twelve months, save
to identify it in a worldly point of view at some
carnal rout or party. 'Tis awful to neglect your
Maker thus."</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Grinderby looked up at a spider's
web on the ceiling above him, with an air that would
have been creditable to Exeter Hall at a May meeting. 
Phil muttered something in reference to the
maker's name in his hat, which it is prudent to suppress 
in these pages.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," he said, rather impatiently,
"for you to find fault with my occasional amusements, 
but where would be our West-end connexion
without them? Look at the little accommodation
business for Lord Ernest Albany in the Burlington.
Why the firm will make, let me see, nine hundred
and fifty pounds by that affair alone."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grinderby, "but it was very near
losing the whole of the capital advanced."</p>

<p>"We stood to lose a hundred and twenty-five
pounds," replied Phil, "and we clear nine hundred
and fifty. It is not <i>quite</i> a thousand per cent., but it
might have been if you would have advanced more;
and all this is owing to my visits to the Cave and the
Escurial, which you are pleased to speak of so disparagingly. 
Every man to his taste, and if I like a
little harmless indulgence better than"&mdash;"canting"
he was about to say, but checked himself and said:
"better than religious restriction, I don't think the
firm has much to complain of, that's all."</p>

<p>Had Mr. Grinderby been in other company, he

would probably, so fond was he of the phrase, have
indulged in a blasphemous allusion, after the fashion
of a celebrated preacher, to a "firm" above, of whom
Phil took no cognisance whatsoever. There is awful
blasphemy to be heard in our streets, on our railways, 
on our steam-boats, and in our rural districts.
A man bred in London may boast with a kind of
pride that he has heard the worst of everything.
He is mistaken, if his sense of hearing has not experienced 
the cacology of a provincial village&mdash;some
"Sweet Auburn" of the period. But all the imprecations 
of the ignorant and debased are as nothing,
if not flavoured with the hypocritical leaven. The
coarsest swearing is meaningless, compared with the
tropes and figures of the falsely devout.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby did not think fit to pursue the subject
of religion any further that day. Whenever very
successful, he became proportionately pious on the
occasion; when he lost, his piety suffered. So great
a hypocrite was Grinderby, that a sufficient amount
of prosperity might have prevented his vicious nature
from ever cropping up to the surface. We think it
might have ended in his deceiving even himself.</p>

<p>"So you think, then, it is all right," he resumed
to his partner, after a pause, "and that this foolish
profligate client of ours will not prosecute Pettingall?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it," was the reply of
that <i>jeune &eacute;l&eacute;gant</i>. "What do you imagine he has
gone away for, without seeing either of us?"</p>

<p>"It would have been very awkward and detrimental
to that firm, had he determined to proceed to extremities; 

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

there is such a prejudice against our profession. 
We should have been made answerable for
all our client's follies and weaknesses. Then, too, the
affair of Swindles Manvers might have been told in a
manner very injurious to the firm."</p>

<p>"It might," said Phil, whistling half a bar of one
of his favourite airs. "And I don't see how we
could have got out of it either."</p>

<p>"There was the sale of Bingley's Wharf, and the
disposal of the business by that rascal Pettingall,"
rejoined Grinderby, reflectively; "and we did not
make so much out of either, as we ought to have done.
That was your doing, Mr. Cousens."</p>

<p>"I admit," said Phil, "that we were slightly done
there. But, excuse me, that was owing to your
scruples&mdash;timidity, I should say."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Mr. Cousens, it does not do to be
enterprising without prudence in this world. You
would soon have got the firm into a mess. What I
say is, that you did not sufficiently protect our client's
interests at first, so as to secure a fitting compensation 
for the manner in which the firm showed itself
disposed to listen to sense and reason. And I must
say, for my part, that my feelings were most conscientiously 
enlisted on the behalf of the purchasers.
When I tell you, sir, that Mr. Thompson, the manager
of the new concern, and the executive purchaser of
the property, is one of the most regular of our congregation, 
and a worthy member of the Peckham
Branch of the Pious Pilgrims of the New Redemption,
I think you must admit that I could conscientiously
make some sacrifice on his behalf of the worldly interests 

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

of so prodigal and ungodly a reprobate as this
Arthur Aubrey."</p>

<p>"But he ought to have paid more for it as a
Christian," suggested Cousens.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Yes, I think that full justice was
not done to the firm," said Grinderby. "When the
unrighteous are given into our hands for a spoil, there
should be no sparing. It would steady your hand
greatly, Mr. Cousens, were you to become a member
of our church, and cement the interests of the firm in
a remarkable degree. But," he added, in a lower
tone, "it is given to our hands to work with strange
instruments, and we must not question the ways of
Heaven. Is the <i>ca. sa</i>. out in Duplex <i>v</i>. Singleton?"</p>

<p>"It is, this morning," was the reply.</p>

<p>"We must see Pettingall after this, and get him to
sign a paper, which will place him at the mercy of the
firm, without apprising our client."</p>

<p>"He is to be manager of the new Company," observed 
Cousens; "and I shall manage so that he pays
back a small sum to our client, with which we will
credit him in costs, which will prevent Aubrey from
ever taking advantage of his discovery. It will be a
compromise of felony. Ha! ha! I shall say that he
is repentant, and has sold up everything to enable
him to offer this small amount towards replacing the
sums he has abstracted. When did you last hear of
Swindles Manvers?" asked Cousens, carelessly.</p>

<p>The brow of Grinderby grew black, and for a
moment abstracted.</p>

<p>"He sailed for the United States last week. Why
do you ask?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

"Oh!" said Cousens, "I heard that he had changed
his name, and been engaged in some very desperate
undertakings. I was told that he had even been supposed 
to be implicated in that dreadful murder of
a jeweller in York, and that the officers are after him."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Grinderby. "Not a word of
truth in it. Manvers is not such a fool as that comes
to. He has done quite enough to make citizenship
in a new and enterprising country more advantageous
for him, than stopping here to annoy us. I am very
glad he is gone; and I trust, at any rate, he has done
enough to make his return here a most remote contingency."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Cousens. "I never could make
out precisely what you had to do with him; seeing
that the firm was out of all the transactions between
him and our client."</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said Grinderby, "the fellow introduced 
himself to me, and gave me considerably more
insight into our client's affairs than I could have
easily obtained elsewhere. But he is not likely to
trouble us any more." After a pause he continued:
"I wish you would go to church sometimes, if only
occasionally, Mr. Cousens. You might then go to the
Escurial or anywhere else, twice as often, without
half so much danger to your reputation."</p>

<p>What answer Mr. Cousens might have made to this
recurrent allusion to one of his favourite haunts will
never be recorded; since a clerk knocked at the door
and presented a slip of paper, on which was written
the name of the firm's devoted client and victim, Mr.
Arthur Aubrey.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

<p>"Say that we are particularly engaged with a City
client, Mr. Snap," said Grinderby, "and will see him
in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. Snap evinced no surprise at these instructions,
and did as he was told. For about a quarter of an
hour the pair were occupied, one in reading a newspaper, 
and the other in writing letters. Mr. Grinderby
then rose and slammed the side-door with some
vehemence, after which he touched a hand-bell,
which act was duly followed by the appearance of
Mr. Snap.</p>

<p>"Show Mr. Aubrey in," said Grinderby.</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you," said that gentleman,
somewhat abruptly, "that I have changed my mind.
It is not my intention to prosecute Mr. Pettingall. I
know all you would say" (to Grinderby, who smiled
harshly and contemptuously, like a gleam of November 
sunshine in the chambers where he practised),
"but you must allow me to be the best judge of my
own affairs" (a bow and a shrug from Grinderby),
"Of course," he added rapidly and pleasantly, "you
are acting quite rightly as my legal advisers in
urging me to prosecute. I should do the same if I
were in your place; but it does not suit me. I don't
like the trouble; and I hate to be bored by a confounded 
lot of snivelling." Mr. Aubrey finished his
sentence, with an affectation of impatience and anger
which he did not feel. The truth is, he had been
deeply moved by the entreaties of Mrs. Pettingall,
upon whom the discovery of her husband's dishonesty
had burst with overwhelming effect. "What a pity,"
resumed Aubrey, "that these scoundrels will marry

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

and have children like other men. She gave him an
excellent character as a father and husband."</p>

<p>Grinderby knew that Pettingall beat his wife, and,
what is still worse in a woman's eyes, neglected her;
but he said nothing, and did not even smile. How
strange a thing it is that scamps and heartless profligates 
are generally so much more faithfully served,
and even passionately loved, by the women whom they
have once deceived, than good men. There are
women who esteem sterling qualities; but their love
is generally subservient to their reason. There is no
romance in <i>their</i> affections. Poor Mrs. Pettingall!
although her brutal husband escaped punishment, and
became a wealthy and prosperous man, she never
recovered the shock and dread which his criminal
conduct, and its detection by Aubrey, occasioned
her. She became, as we shall have occasion to
narrate hereafter, a confirmed lunatic.</p>

<p>Pettingall was always very pathetic in alluding to
his "affliction," as he called it, to his friends and
acquaintances in after life; and talked of the heavy
expenses which it entailed upon him, just as if the
poor lady had been confined in a private lunatic
asylum regardless of cost. As his weight increased
and his cheeks became fatter, the expression of his
grief became gradually more difficult to convey,
until it became so completely conventional, that those
who knew him treated his sad communications as
they would do a mere British barometrical remark of
commonplace salutation. He would roll a duly lubricated 
cigar between his commercial thumb and finger
and speak of "my sad burden, you know," with an

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

indifference that bordered on satisfaction. As he set
up a snuff-box about the same time that his domestic
calamity befel him, the habit of recurring to the two&mdash;i.e., 
grief and box&mdash;became inseparable. In this
there was some aptitude, as the shop-sweepings in
his favourite mixture imparted a moisture to his eyes,
which was extremely proper and edifying under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"May I ask," said Mr. Grinderby after a pause,
during which Phil had attempted at least three airs
out of the "Sonnambula," and three times recalled
himself to a sense of propriety and partnership in
the firm&mdash;"may I ask if there is any proposal on the
part of this repentant family to restore any portion
of the proceeds of their embezzlement? You are
aware, I suppose, that Pettingall has a collection of
pictures and some expensive furniture for a man in
his position?"</p>

<p>"Really," said Aubrey, "I did not think of that;
but if I could recover something I should have no
objection. My expenses have lately been somewhat
heavy, I can assure you, and I fancy I have lost
some thousands by this man."</p>

<p>"You had better not appear in the matter yourself," 
observed Phil. "If you like to place it in our
hands, and authorise us to act for you, we will see
what amount can be recovered. It is a matter which
will require great firmness and caution. I should
think Pettingall would cut up for at least five
hundred pounds, with the aid of a little adroit menace
and the broker. I would not leave the scoundrel a
bed to lie on, nor a table on which to write."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

<p>"Nay," said Arthur, "you must leave the poor
woman and her children their bits of things."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" quoth Phil, arranging his collar as if
before an invisible glass; "I wonder how many
babies' cribs it would take, under the appraiser, to
pay for a pound of Beckington's best brand of
regalias?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, what a notion!" said his client.
"No, no, I will not have any such barbarity."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," observed Mr. Grinderby, with provoking 
calmness, "Mr. Aubrey considers a gallery
full of paintings essential to the domestic comfort of
the helpmate of a dishonest clerk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By no means," interrupted Aubrey. "I wish
only to be guided by the commonest dictates of
humanity."</p>

<p>"If," returned the elder lawyer, "Mr. Aubrey
will be kind enough to favour us with his instructions, 
I will see them carefully carried out. Suppose
that we leave the houseful of furniture to the wife,
and sufficient money for the purposes of emigration&mdash;say, 
one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds.
Of course," he said, "Mr. Pettingall is not likely
to get another berth in this country, without a
recommendation for honesty; and that at least you
cannot give him?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Aubrey. "I think," he
added, "your present view of the case is alike sensible 
and humane; and I give you full credit for
your suggestion, and liberty to act in my name."</p>

<p>The lawyer hastily wrote a few lines on a sheet of
paper, and handed it to Mr. Aubrey, who at once

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

affixed his signature and handed it back. It simply
empowered Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens to settle
all business relations between their client and Mr.
Pettingall; and to discharge the latter from his
employment, on such conditions as should seem desirable 
and expedient. This done, the trio separated.
Aubrey went home to dinner, and to impart to his
gentle wife the merciful course he had adopted, certain 
of an ample reward from her beautiful eyes and
lips; and Phil Cousens betook himself to his hair-dresser, 
and thence to a little banquet for four in the
Haymarket; after which he contemplated visiting a
music-hall in order to witness a daring performance
on the trap&egrave;ze, for which the coarse and brutal proprietors 
deserved an indictment at the sessions, instead
of a "champagne notice" in the newspapers, and the
renewal of their license to deprave and poison the
British public, while smaller ruffians only&mdash;reversing
the physical order of things&mdash;stuck in the obstructive
meshes of the magisterial net.</p>

<p>THAT evening saw Grinderby and Pettingall wonderfully 
confidential together over a bottle of the
identical port wine which Manvers had recognised as
a sample of the 1820, bottled by the late Mr. Aubrey,
who little thought, poor man! what throats it would
moisten, or it may be imagined he would have hesitated 
before laying it down. The old man was hard,
but honest. He was one of the last of the type of
the old English merchant, whose word was as good
as his bond. Such is often still the case; but then it
happens often that both are valueless. A brisk trade
too frequently means now a successful fraud. The
only period of honesty now is whilst a name is being
built up; upon which to cheat well and widely. The
greater the name now, the more apprehensive we have
reason to be of the extent of the impending crash.

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

One shoulders unconvicted felons at every turn of the
commercial mart, and England (not France) has
become one great gambling-table, where Credit presides 
as croupier, and the boldest and cleverest black-legs 
win the largest prizes and the most frequent stakes.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby was an acute and subtle angler;
but he was not displaying his piscatorial powers on
the occasion of his interview with Mr. Pettingall.
He was merely applying the screw; or, to adopt a
more convivial figure in honour of that t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
symposium, the lemon-squeezing process, and very
sour and elongated did Pettingall's visage become
during the operation. If our readers could imagine
a successful thief falling into the clutches of a more
powerful old bandit, and arguing over the appropriation 
of the plunder, he will have some idea of the
transaction. His first fright being over, soon after
the return of his wife, the delinquent clerk had rushed
into an extreme of self-gratulation. When Grinderby
called, he was positively in an exultant state. If
Aubrey had foregone the prosecution, what else could
he do? Pettingall had no less a sum than three
thousand pounds very advantageously invested. He
was confident that his managership and secretaryship
of the "New United Shippers and Barge-owners'
Association Company, Limited," built on the secret
and dishonest transfer of his late employer's business,
would be secured to him; for if not, he was in a
position not only to upset the sale of Bingley's Wharf,
but to reveal the whole conspiracy by which the
business was secured to the Company. His detection
by Aubrey fell on him like a thunderbolt. For eight-and-forty 

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

hours he had been on the point of realising
his securities, and proceeding to Sweden or the
United States. But he had counted with desperate
assurance in no little degree on the weakness and
good nature of Arthur Aubrey, and the connivance
of his legal advisers: and the result showed he was
not mistaken. But now here was old Grinderby,
armed with plenipotential powers, which the latter
took care to inform him extended from compromise
to prosecution; and the old lawyer, with the most
friendly manner of which he was capable, while
shutting one eye to look through a glassful of the
ruby juice of the grape, and fixing the other with its
cold spectacled glare upon the guilty wretch with a
patent corkscrew power of extraction, stated that he
would have no less a sum of money than twelve
hundred and fifty pounds from him as the price of
escape from transportation. Nor would Grinderby
bate one penny of his demand.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, dryly, "if you have not
got the money; but with good conduct and your
abilities you will soon get a ticket-of-leave, and
smart accountants are highly prized in a country of
such wonderful commercial expansion as Australia.
How ever will you manage without smoking, after
committal? They don't allow it in Newgate, you
know. You must have robbed your employer very
clumsily, not to have acquired more than double the
sum I have mentioned. And I fear the new Company 
has been sadly ungrateful. By-the-bye, what
is the salary to be affixed to your new position? I
trust it is sufficient to secure your future integrity."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

<p>In vain did Pettingall writhe and quiver under the
merciless chaff of his grim interrogator. In vain did
he declare that he had not the amount named, or
half of it, in the world; and that he could not raise
it, if he sold off everything, including the pictures.</p>

<p>"The more fool you," was the only response.
"How could you sacrifice your integrity" (dwelling
on the word) "for so small a consideration?"</p>

<p>Pettingall ventured to mutter something about
"unfortunate speculations."</p>

<p>"What! with your employer's money&mdash;how doubly
rash," was the only answer. "Look you, if this
were true," he resumed, "and not an infernal lie,
as I know it to be, I would spend money to add five
years to your term of penal servitude. I would not
be disappointed by your folly, any more than I will
be bilked by your rascality. Look here, business is
over, and I have no objection to another bottle; but
by&mdash;&mdash;" (here the old hypocrite swore a dreadful
oath), "if you don't shell out before I have done with
you to-night, and I don't mean to lose the last
omnibus to Peckham, I'll give you fifteen years, as
sure as my name is Grinderby."</p>

<p>Pettingall groaned, as he felt himself nailed to this
species of mock auction, at which he so unwillingly
sought to bid for freedom from the consequences of
his crime and ingratitude. But he did bid, and with
every glass of wine swallowed respectively by the
unequal pair over their unholy negotiation, the market
rose gradually but surely. The wine, which made
Grinderby the fiercer and firmer, and more sarcastic,
only flustered the weaker instrument in the plunder

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

of their respective client and employer. By the time
Pettingall had risen to eleven hundred pounds, and
was fairly blubbering over his pretended incapacity
to give more, the second bottle was finished; and
Grinderby pulled out his massive watch and held it
towards the failing lamp. He then replaced it in his
fob, under the capacious flaps of his long grey vest,
and buttoned his coat and great-coat deliberately
over it.</p>

<p>"Time's up," was all he vouchsafed to say. "We
shall meet next in Newgate."</p>

<p>An eccentric fancy skipped into Pettingall's half-muddled 
brain, and took such firm hold there that he
could not shake it off. As he stood irresolutely gazing
with his red and fishy eyes at the movements of Grinderby, 
he thought how he should like to be a small
street boy of the predatorial class, and butt with his head
full at the portly stomach of the irritating old lawyer,
and tug at the seals and ribbon of that monstrous
turnip of a watch. The idea possessed him so strongly
that he burst into a convulsive fit of laughter, mingled
with sobbing, which Grinderby took to be hysterical;
and, in consequence, very nearly relaxed his determination, 
and was on the point of taking the eleven
hundred pounds, thinking that Pettingall had really
stated nearly the truth of the case, when the latter,
mistaking the lawyer's involuntary motion for the
final signal of his departure, suddenly gasped out:</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Mr. Grinderby&mdash;I'll do it, though I
have to sell these spoons."</p>

<p>If Grinderby smiled, it was internally; for he
evinced not the slightest surprise or emotion as he

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

quietly unrolled his comforter, and stepped out of his
great-coat again.</p>

<p>"No time like the present, Mr. Pettingall," he
said, in a brisk tone. "I congratulate you on your
resolution. Of course," he continued, "I must have
the money to-night. Got it, I dare say, up-stairs?
Oh! I nearly forgot to say that our firm must do
the business of the new Company. I dare say, however, 
that has already occurred to you."</p>

<p>"Indeed," muttered Pettingall, "it is impossible.
Our Mr. Thompson has already got his son-in-law in.
Besides, it would not be worth your while. There
would not be a chance of anything but regular
business."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what our firm wishes," said
Grinderby. "You need not be in the least afraid.
We want a City connexion; and, besides, we only
put the screw on our poorer clients, and fools like
this Aubrey. I tell you, it will pay us to do the
Company's business well and cheaply&mdash;I may say on
the square. Remember, I have set my mind on this
business, and will have it; or you may keep your
paltry twelve hundred and fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"I promise you to do my best," said Pettingall;
"but if I can't do it, I can't."</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied Grinderby, "I shall only
pledge you to act under my instructions, and I have
no fear of the result; but as the other business must
be ended here, and the money paid, and the papers
signed and delivered, you must do me the favour to
give me the best pledge you can."</p>

<p>And he accordingly dictated an oath to the unresisting

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

clerk of a nature to make the hair of an
unsophisticated person stand on end with affright.</p>

<p>He then produced a sort of release in blank, which
he filled up with the respective names of his client
and the guilty clerk, and inserted the sum of two
hundred and fifty pounds as the consideration money,
which caused the heart of the perplexed Pettingall
to bound and palpitate with momentary astonishment 
and delight. He was soon, however, disenchanted.</p>

<p>"The thousand pounds," said Grinderby, "I will,
if you please, appropriate for the firm."</p>

<p>We need scarcely say that this partook of the nature
of a species of legal fiction, as the accomplished Phil
Cousens touched only a moiety of two hundred and
fifty pounds, which Grinderby assured him was all that
his utmost diplomacy could extract out of Pettingall.
The battle had to be fought over again about the production 
of the consideration money&mdash;we do not mean
Mr. Aubrey's share. For that, his legal adviser was
perfectly content with a promissory note payable on
demand. Not so with the thousand pounds. The
matter was, however, finally settled by the production
of nearly six hundred pounds in notes and gold, which
Pettingall kept, as Grinderby had shrewdly suspected,
in case of a sudden emergency, and the deposit of
securities and shares representing eight hundred
pounds incerta in flourishing Companies of the period,
it being understood that these were to be restored the
next day, on payment of the remaining amount.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Grinderby, after duly reinvesting
himself in his outer garments, "I have only just one

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

more word to say&mdash;it is one of caution for your sake.
This document will remain with me, and it will not
be my interest to destroy it. As long as it remains
in existence you will be safe, at any rate, from any
punishment which my client can demand or exact.
It will never be for my interest that this affair should
see even a partial glimpse of light. I will be frank
and candid. It might injure the firm, were it to do
so. But if you know enough to breathe suspicion or
scandal upon us, we, on our part, have it in our
power to ruin you, position, prospects, and character.
Be advised by me. Be silent and keep square. You
have sufficient temptation to act honestly in future;
and the richer and more respectable you grow,
the greater stake you will have in keeping things
dark, and acquiring a character for trustworthiness.
You have had a narrow squeak. Master Pettingall,
and have been let off very cheaply, take my word
for it."</p>

<p>With this, Mr. Grinderby put his hat and gloves on
with the deliberation of a family doctor at a funeral,
and went out into the bright, calm moonlight shining
on St. Saviour's Church, Southwark, with the air of
a philosopher conscious of performing a charitable act.
And in some such light no doubt he regarded it.
Does any one imagine that honesty and dishonesty
are always read by the same lantern, be it that of
Christian faith or heathen discovery?</p>

<p>That night Mr. Grinderby did not find his way to
Peckham. The last 'bus had been gone nearly forty
minutes. True, he might have taken a cab, and he
did; but the driver must have misunderstood his

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

directions, for he drove in exactly an opposite direction. 
When the firm was unusually busy, either in
or out of term time, Mr. Grinderby often slept at the
office. There was the old laundress to attest it, and
a bed which the late Duke of Wellington might have
approved for shape and hardness. But about three
hours later some one very like the senior partner of
the firm of Grinderby and Cousens might have been
discovered, by the interposition of a new "Devil on
Two Sticks," getting much the worst of it in a
drunken scuffle with a lady of considerable personal
attractions, but of haughty and resolute mien, flushed
with bacchanalian indulgence, in an elegantly furnished 
cottage in the Grove of the Evangelist, N.W.
The supper-cloth covered a portion of the floor instead 
of the table, and the remains of a lobster-salad
ornamented the hearth-rug with an additional raised
pattern. So earnest had the lady shown herself in
her desire to possess a token of the old lawyer's affection, 
that a lock of his grey hair was twined round
and among the diamond rings that sparkled on her
taper fingers.</p>

<p>"You old wretch," she said, "I'll teach you to
look at another woman, that I will."</p>

<p>Was this person jealous, then, of our respectable
elder of the New Branch of Deliverance at Peckham?
We must profess ourselves unwilling to doubt a lady's
word. All we know is, that when she wanted anything 
which her protector was unwilling to give, she
invariably imputed to him some act of gallantry,
which she proceeded to avenge on the spot. As these
encounters always ended with a maudlin reconciliation, 

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

the coveted present invariably followed as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>That very night, at the same hour, did Mr. Pettingall, 
after his third glass of brandy-and-water, put
the lighted end of his cigar into his fish-like mouth,
just before staggering into his bedroom to seek the
slumbers of which he stood in need. It was remarkable 
that whereas in his cups Grinderby's legs always
failed him long before his head, Pettingall acquired
an increased bodily vigour from drunkenness, but
very soon lost his head. On this occasion, furious
with rage, and boiling over with anger against his
tormentor and plunderer, Grinderby, he ordered his
pale and trembling wife out of bed, and&mdash;must we
write it?&mdash;beat, ay, and kicked, her unmercifully.
The poor creature crept away to a sofa, weeping as if
her heart would break. That night a vessel broke
on her overtaxed and tortured brain; but it was not
until the second day after, so inattentive to her condition 
was Pettingall in his sullen and morose mood
of baffled greed and impotent vindictiveness, that he
discovered the condition into which his combined
guilt and brutality had driven the unhappy lady
whom he had sworn to protect and cherish. The
first half-hour that some little domestic necessity
caused him to direct his attention in a less resentful
temper to his wife, he found her a moping maniac,
from which state the doctors held out not the slightest
chance that she would ever recover.</p>

<p>WE must now return to the elegant and accomplished 
Mr. Philip Cousens, with his patent boots and
easy off-hand style. He proceeded that evening, as
we have above narrated, to his favourite haunt, the
Escurial, a gorgeous music-hall, consecrated also to
Terpsichore, where Young England, and too often,
to its shame be it said, Old England, delighted to
congregate and unbend; there the "delighted spirit"
of Phil Cousens bathed itself in a congenial flood
of youthful cynicism and slang; there he and his male
companion in the little dinner for four, which we
alluded to in our last chapter but one, mingled their
empty heads with those of scores and hundreds of

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

other "pleasure"-seekers, floating, cork-like, upon the
ocean of snobbism around. It was an ocean whose
deity might easily have been pictured to the imagination, 
rising in an apotheosis of tobacco-smoke,
in the likeness of a bleary, leary old "gent," with
the beard of a Silenus and the hoofs and horns of
a goat. The transformed genius of Britain, too, what
should she resemble? No longer the Minerva-like,
the chastely and severely beautiful goddess, to whom
fancy once lent a form; not the Britannia of heroic
Old England, but a Britannia Theatre impersonation
in pink "tights," or a lightly-attired coryph&eacute;e of
the Escurial itself, an example of the studied attractions 
of the place, with saucer-like muslin skirt,
"four inches shorter, sir, than on any other boards
in England, by &mdash;&mdash;," as the manager was wont to
boast. Or shall we imagine a modern Britannia, in
the person of the buxom lady in the striped dress
with red high-heeled boots and little bells attached to
them, who jumps about yelling her <i>double-entendres</i>,
with her arms akimbo, to an enraptured audience;
and then hops off the stage on one leg, the incarnation 
of brazen effrontery, a fish-fag in satin
stays?</p>

<p>Look around you, curious and inquiring philosopher! 
Consider, respectable citizen of Great
Britain! Is this scene a nightmare or a reality?
We have abolished the cock-pit and the dog-pit, we
no longer bait bears and bulls, the Ring is on its last
legs, and the Turf has at least three rotten legs to one
sound one, if it has one sound one left; while the
legs of the noble steed threaten to become the last and

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

least requisites for success. But what is <i>this?</i> What
means this crapulous assemblage, this saturnalia of
villainous aspect, this crush of Jew and ill-looking
foreigner, of thief and "swell," of "gent" and
"snob?" words of modern meaning and extraction;
this seething vulgarity, these insolent looks, these
depraved regards&mdash;whence comes that coarse and
brutal laugh, that loud-voiced slang? Is this the
reproduction of some lewd rites in vogue before the
Flood, or is it suggestive, as it is provocative, of the
fiery wrath to come?</p>

<p>Nonsense! away with such fancies, such absurdities. 
This is only the Escurial in its glory, a
popular place of entertainment, highly patronised
and greatly frequented in this refined and sentimental 
age.</p>

<p>We must narrate that Mr. Cousens and his friend
had quitted their two friends of the dinner, before
repairing to this place of chaste and elegant recreation; 
for providing which the spirited proprietors
actually affect to consider themselves entitled to the
gratitude of their fellow-countrymen. On that very
afternoon a splendid service of plate had been presented 
to the chief caterer and manager by his admirers 
in recognition of what they were pleased to
term his great energy, untiring enterprise, and generous 
devotion on the public behalf. This meant the
engagement of one of the largest troupes of dancers
ever collected in Paris, and causing them to wear a
less amount of clothing than had ever been known
before, during the performance of a series of voluptuous 
gymnastics called by courtesy dancing, which

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

had led to the deaths of half a dozen or so through
cold and consumption, and nightly threatened the lives
of several more. It included a more thrilling and
perilous series of feats upon certain ropes and bars
affixed to the roof of the building than had ever been
previously attempted, which was greatly enhanced in
interest by the fact that a fall would in all probability
have insured the sensational deaths of one or more
of the spectators below. It included a covered
refuge for a large body of French and English
courtesans lately driven from their wonted open-air
beat by the severity of a magisterial Lord Angelo,
and by the cruelty of a police force, which enjoyed
the reputation of being rather more brutal and demoralised 
than any section of the criminal population
of the metropolis, whom they were supposed to keep
in check. It included the opening of certain beer
and wine cellars below, where persons of known
immorality and the "nobility" generally&mdash;which
would seem to comprise a great many ill-favoured
foreigners, and a considerable portion of the lost tribes
of Israel, which seemed to have turned up for the
occasion&mdash;were at liberty to congregate; and to sit,
stand, smoke, drink, or converse with such ladies of the
ballet as chose between the acts of the dazzling scenes
on the stage to come down and sit, stand, drink,
smoke, and converse with them in this engaging
Pandemonium of paint, sawdust, oil, stench, beer-barrels, 
and seedy, squalid waiters, below. This was
the cynosure of raw swells and vicious clerks and
shopmen, the charming retreat of the capitalist of
panics, of the "limited liability" promoter, the fast

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

stockbroker, the "lord" of protested cheques and
dishonoured bills, the dishonest director, and the
financial M.P. Nor let us leave out of the enterprise
the engagement of a lady contortionist with her
husband, said to be Moldo-Wallachian, and who may
have been, if there is a quarter so called in Whitechapel; 
and of a staff of comic singers, whom the
bills and posters of their astonishing qualifications
could alone adequately describe. There was a stoutish
lady with ample skirts, clocked silk stockings, and
high-heeled shoes, who danced and sang, and did
what is technically called a "break-down" with such
a genial overflow of vulgarity, that the reciprocal
raptures of delighted gentism were fully awakened.
The yells and howls of applause nightly elicited by
this lady from the seated portion of the audience,
who drank in every word and gesture, and who belonged 
to the respectable class of the Escurials&mdash;in 
so far that every female was not of necessity a
woman of the town, and every youth or man not
absolutely and unmistakably in search of <i>Cythera
communis</i>&mdash;the yells and howls of delight, we say, at
the songs and capers of this lady, were something at
once deafening to the ear and gratifying to art. Then
there was the "great" Smith, the "greater" Jones,
and the "greatest" comic singer in the world, the
"stunning" Robinson, whom the youth of England
were there taught to venerate, to imitate, and to
admire. Such were some of the claims which the
illustrious manager, the patriotic and the philanthropic 
Slimy Cash, Esq., put forth to receive the
silver tea-service in particular, and the gratitude of

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

the British nation in general. This great man was
that evening at the perihelion of his well-earned
glory and substantial success. Had not a select
party from the House of Commons visited the Escurial, 
and even inspected the <i>sacra penetralia</i> below?
True, these were swept and garnished for the occasion,
a select party of the ballet only was formally introduced, 
and cautioned to behave with a bewitching
modesty of demeanour which</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Might well have fired old Saturn;</p>

</div>

<p>an unexceptional collation was prepared, and the
wines and liqueurs were of the best. Above all, the
whole rout of common roysterers were excluded, and
not one of the Hebrew fraternity to be seen&mdash;not
even Isaac of York himself could have gained admission 
by anything short of a princely introduction
that night. The senatorial party pronounced, as
they had a right to do, the arrangements and the
conduct of the whole establishment to be faultless.
Only an Irish member showed some little discontent
at not having an opportunity of pushing his researches 
as to the morality of the ballet a little
further than perhaps the occasion warranted. But
the ardour of legislative inquiry was doubtless fired
beyond the bounds of frigid conventionality by the
severe test which, in the strict exercise of duty, he
subjected the quality of the supposed Escurial champagne. 
This little episode was, however, amply
atoned for by the parting benediction bestowed on
the smiling Slimy Cash by the chairman of the
Committee himself, who was pleased to say that he

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

had never passed a more agreeable evening in the
exercise of his parliamentary duties during a period
of thirty years. Moreover, after the stage machinery
had been examined and explained, did not the aforesaid 
grave and reverend chairman himself, a distinguished 
and advanced Liberal and Reformer, shake
hands with the enraptured Slimy, and compliment
him on being one of the pioneers of the improvement
and civilisation of the age? The last attempt at remonstrance 
on behalf of the legitimate drama was
very shortly disposed of by the said enlightened
chairman, when inflicting in the person of one of its
most honoured interpreters an insult so coarse and
brutal before a Committee of the House of Commons,
that the excited and sensitive artist took to his bed
for a whole fortnight in consequence thereof. The
result of all this was that the Escurial was in full
swing and riot; the police were squared in a manner
most agreeable to their feelings; the stipendiary
magistrates lent the weight of their decisions and
influence to the side of success; and Slimy Cash,
Esq., and his coadjutors were on the high road to
fortune, retirement from business, the respectability
which is ever the handmaid of realised wealth, ancestral 
halls, and deer-parks in Surrey or elsewhere;
and, lastly, seats in the Senate of a venal and admiring 
nation.</p>

<p>Was it to be wondered that Slimy Cash, Esq.,
was in excellent trim and spirits that night? He
who did all this, and only in return charged his
fellow-citizens one shilling each admission; and
nothing, as some said, to a large portion of the female

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

acolytes to this temple of the three most charming
of the nine muses in Apollo's train; he who had that
day been feasted at a sumptuous banquet at the
Crystal Palace, and presented with a splendid testimonial, 
in words which would appear in all the next
day's papers without the expense of payment as an
advertisement; he who had freely imbibed wines
which he knew to be not his own, and, therefore, to
be trusted in a sanitary point of view, as not likely
to result in utter prostration the next morning, was&mdash;who 
can wonder at it?&mdash;in the seventh heaven of
delight smoking a presentation cigar in his own especial 
Pandemonium. That evening his very imprecations 
were softened; and the only Peri of the ballet
whose eyes and limbs he had consigned even to a worse
place than the Escurial, had remarked to a lady friend,
that he had done it quite mild-like, and even good-naturedly 
for him. Had the wretched acrobat, hanging 
that night by his great toes from the ceiling in
the immediate vicinity of the chandelier, fallen upon
the managerial head, graced as it was with ambrosial 
curls, and crushed the great Cash into a shapeless
lump of clay, and stopped all the sordid calculations
of his brain, and left him only distinguishable from
any other wiped-out nonentity, by the glittering
gewgaw on his dirty hand, which, somehow or other,
no amount of soap and water ever seemed able to
clean, and by the Californian massiveness of his well-known 
Albert chain, there is no doubt but that the
world would have been the gainer, whilst he would
have died a superlatively happy man. Alas! the
Nemesis which followed in his footsteps that night

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

was but a small and limited expression of the wrath
which the atrocious vulgarity and hollow abomination
of his success had created in the bosoms of the Fates
and Furies, who, for some wise reason or other,
delayed to snip the vital ropes of his own particular
trap&egrave;ze and let the wretch down with a run!</p>

<p>The vengeance which the Fates meditated that
eventful evening was of the smallest and the paltriest
kind. A puny little wandering Nemesis, bent on
mortal mischief, had, as we have recorded, drawn
thither, by some invisible string, the elegant Phil
Cousens and his companion at that particular time.
Phil himself was, as he said, disgustingly sober, but
his companion was in the first stage of Circean enchantment. 
He had already drunk the blood of the
monkey, and a single glass of the Escurial brandy
initiated him into the lion stage. In this state he
dragged Phil with him to the door leading to the
underground department, which we have endeavoured
to describe. Unfortunately for Phil, who, it must be
owned, wanted to shake his friend off, and had no
desire to make the descent which immortalised the
tuneful Orpheus in such dangerous companionship&mdash;much 
as he coveted admission alone&mdash;unfortunately,
we say, for Phil, and for an innocent and harmless
personage who had entered the Escurial from mere
curiosity, in total ignorance of the habits of the place,
and who was altogether a cleanly and domestic gentleman 
of high culture and moral worth, the guardian
of the sacred retreat objected to the tipsy deportment
of the elegant Mr. Cousens's friend. The fact is, that
the management, inflated by success, had lately grown

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

very particular in their instructions to the "officers"
of the establishment; so an altercation took place,
during which Phil and the stranger stood passively
inside the forbidden door.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Mr. Cousens, pulling at his
friend's coat-tail, "this won't do. Don't kick up a
row, or we shall get into trouble."</p>

<p>And he endeavoured to persuade his friend, whose
leonine state of drunkenness was fast developing
itself, to retrace his steps. But the "trouble" came
sooner than Phil expected. For, behold! the pottering 
little Nemesis we have spoken of directed thither
the haughty steps of no less a person than the great
Slimy Cash himself, who at that moment felt himself
a potentate worthy of taking his place in a parterre of
kings.</p>

<p>"Here <i>is</i> Mr. Slimy Cash," quoth the door-keeper; 
"you had better ask him."</p>

<p>Upon which Phil's friend took the advice of
Cerberus, and rather roughly addressed the monarch
in his own Escurial, urging his claims to admission.</p>

<p>"Just be off, will you?" was the response; "you
have no right here. We only admit gentlemen to
the 'cellars,' and them, too, as we know."</p>

<p>"I tell you I have been down a dozen times
before," urged Mr. Cousens's friend.</p>

<p>"And I tell you, you're a liar," was the uncourteous 
rejoinder.</p>

<p>The answer was an extension, by the action of the
biceps muscle, of the right arm of Phil's friend
in a longitudinal direction, and also in the direction
of Mr. Slimy Cash's inflamed visage. This is the way

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

we lately saw a blow described in the epistolary correspondence 
between two duellists in a French newspaper. 
Another and another similar extension succeeded, 
followed by the extension of the great man
on his own boards in an extremely bruised and bleeding 
condition. But retaliation quickly followed.
Half a dozen tall fellows in a kind of police uniform,
a portion of the army of the Escurial, quickly appeared 
upon the scene. And oh! that we should
relate such injustice&mdash;not only was the unoffending
Phil soundly thrashed and pommelled, and ejected
by a kick, as with the force of a catapult, from the
premises, with a couple of black eyes added to his
sum of suffering and indignity, and his watch, chain,
studs, and shirt-front subtracted from his worldly
goods; but the mild and amiable stranger, who at a
little distance stood quietly smoking and ruminating
on this, to him, strange and incomprehensible scene,
was suddenly pinioned by one hired bully, whilst another 
ruffian planted a succession of shoulder-hits on
his handsome and expressive face, which was literally 
held up to the blows of his assailant, who had
been an unsuccessful, because currish and cowardly,
aspirant to the decaying honours of the King. Stupefied 
and covered with blood, the unfortunate gentleman 
was "rushed" along a dark and narrow back
entry into the street, into which he was most ignominiously 
kicked by his brutal assailants. And there
he lay, stunned and senseless, for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>Phil Cousens and his friend suffered in one sense
a still more degrading and protracted infliction. For

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

they were pushed, dragged, and carried, neck and
heels, through the dense mob of blackguards and
Cyprians who stood around and behind the seated
portion of the audience and filled the passages and
entrances of the place. The original cause of the
brawl, Phil's friend, whose intoxication had now
become complete&mdash;him, the special deity who watches
over drunken men, preserved at least from abrasions
and contusions, and landed hatless, it is true, but
comparatively uninjured, in the street. There he
offered "to fight any one for a season ticket to
Exeter Hall&mdash;no, dash it, I mean Spurgeon's chapel.
I'll fight any gentlemen present (hiccup) for a ticket
to Spurgeon's chapel and a new hat&mdash;I want a new
hat." A good-natured policeman put him in a cab.
"Drive to Barnes'!" he shouted, meaning a night-house 
in the Haymarket. And to Barnes Common
he was driven, having fallen asleep the moment the
cab-door was shut.</p>

<p>Not so, as we have already recorded, with the
sprightly and fascinating Phil. His own creditors
would hardly have recognised him, as he was left
panting and breathless by his ejectors, outside the
building into which he had so lately entered on such
excellent terms with himself and the world at large.
A victim of assault and battery, with broken eye-glass
and damaged optics, the crown of his hat knocked in,
and studless as a nobleman whose entire stable has
been unreservedly sold off, the first thought of Mr.
Cousens was an action against the proprietors, with
swinging damages; and the second, what sort of
figure he should cut in Webb's Fields in the morning.

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

The image of Grinderby, severe and ironical, rose before 
his impaired vision, and sobered him to a correct
estimate of the calamity which had overtaken him.
He saw the impossibility of damages, and groaned
not only in the spirit, but aloud. Then thoughts of
opposing the license of the Escurial flashed across
him, only to be banished as hopeless from his brain.
Sadly and slowly did Phil pick himself up, and ruefully 
and mournfully did he hail a four-wheeled cab&mdash;he 
had not spirits for a Hansom, to betake himself 
to his third floor in Maddox-street, Regent-street&mdash;a 
sadder, but not a better man. There let us leave
him to bathe his face in cold water, and devise falsehoods 
of the most varied and ingenious description,
which he dismissed successively as impotent to deceive 
Grinderby, cursing the Escurial and all connected 
with it, and vowing he would never enter
such a low place again.</p>

<p>We must now return to the stranger, whom we
have left lying stunned and unconscious in a dark,
narrow, and unfrequented street at the back of the
Escurial.</p>

<p>ABOUT twenty minutes might have elapsed, during
which no one took any notice of the insensible victim

<!-- vol 1 page 257 -->

of the brutality narrated in our last chapter, when a
brace of thieves, very much out of luck, who were
just deliberating on the inducements held out by the
casual ward of that district as compared with those of
Shoreditch, where they had slept the previous night,
stumbled upon what they first took to be a drunken
man lying in the street. Quickly did they show that
they at least were no Pharisees and Levites to pass by
on the other side. Without a word expressing surprise, 
or emotion of any kind, they darted rapidly to
the rescue, like a brace of shadows suddenly let loose
from a very dark wall to contend for the privilege of
attaching themselves to the body of some prostrate
Peter Schlemihl, who might be supposed to offer a
vacancy for an unemployed umbra on the spot. Gently
and tenderly did one of them lift his right arm and feel&mdash;not 
the stranger's heart, to see if any signs of life beat
there, but his watch&mdash;not his pulse, but his pockets.
Skilfully and dexterously did the other possess himself 
of a handful of souvenirs, in the shape of his
purse, card-case, and other trifles. Then, acting in
admirable concert, they turned him round, as if bent
on exhibiting the process recommended to resuscitate
the drowned, and felt in his coat-pockets behind,
whence they took a small volume with gold clasps, a
pocket-handkerchief, and other trifles. Doubtless,
with the excellent object of giving him a better opportunity 
of respiration, one of them next proceeded to
whip off his black silk tie. What further they might
have done, we know not. All we do know is that at
that moment&mdash;as if owing to their kind attentions&mdash;the 
injured man opened his eyes; and a Cain-like

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

scowl flitted over the face of one of the wiry and
undersized ruffians, whilst he lifted his head, with a
muttered oath, as if to dash it down again with
violence on its stony pillow.</p>

<p>But listen! a footstep approaches. These Good Samaritans 
are unwilling to be seen in the exercise of
their charity. They lay his head down softly, and
listen; as you might fancy a couple of Red Indians
disturbed in the act of scalping a victim by the thud
of the approaching gallop of a patrol of Texan
Rangers. "Hook it!" was the brief whispered remark, 
uttered so simultaneously that we are not quite
sure whether it really proceeded from both, or disengaged 
itself from the dirty comforter which acted
as respirator to only one of the pair. The sound of
the caution thus uttered might have reminded you
of the hiss of a snake from out of his blanket in the
serpent-house in the Zoological Gardens, where
foreign reptiles are far more tenderly housed than
pauper British children. A moment&mdash;and the pair
of guilty shadows have gained the midnight darkness
of the gloomy wall, whence in due time they emerged
at a convenient distance, and added two more to the
number of unholy gainers by the licentious traffic of
the gorgeous Escurial that night.</p>

<p>During the next few moments the stranger had
groaned once or twice, opened his eyes, striven to
rise, and finally crawled towards the solitary lamp-post 
at a corner of the street, which served to make
darkness visible around. Meanwhile, a female figure,
dressed in dusky, faded habiliments, very much in
unison with a pale and careworn young face, and

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

delicate and small features expressing the deepest
chronic anxiety and grief, approached him, and stood
gazing with a sort of subdued expression of curiosity
and interest on his proceedings. Then, as if comprehending 
suddenly that he stood in need of aid, she
stooped and helped him to rise and gain the lamp-post, 
where he leaned for a few moments collecting
his thoughts, and gaining strength to speak.</p>

<p>"I will reward you handsomely," he said at length,
"if you will kindly lend me your assistance to get
away from this place. Good Heavens!" he added,
"I have been robbed too. My watch and purse,
even my gloves and handkerchief, are gone."</p>

<p>"Take mine, sir," she said; "it is quite clean,
although it is in holes. Let we wipe the blood away
from your face. You must have been garotted by
some wretches, who have left you here."</p>

<p>In a few words he explained to her what had occurred.</p>

<p>"Am I much disfigured?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Here is a terrible lump on your forehead, and a
gash under the right eye, and you seem to have had
a cut on your nose with something sharp&mdash;possibly a
ring. These wretches are in the habit of wearing
large rings on purpose to inflict a greater injury. Or
perhaps it was a knuckle-duster."</p>

<p>"A knuckle-duster!" quoth the injured gentleman, 
with a puzzled air. "Oh! I see, something
like the classical cestus, I suppose. Surely the bridge
of my nose is not broken?" he asked. "No, it has
escaped, thank Heaven. And now," he said, "I
cannot reward you; for everything of value about me

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

is gone. Stop! Where is the main entrance to this
atrocious <i>guet-apens?</i> I must and will give these
cowardly scoundrels in charge. Can you find me a
policeman, my good friend?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" she replied, "I am not one to give advice
to a gentleman like you; but I know a little&mdash;too
much&mdash;of these things. Are you prepared for all
that you will have to face in the morning?&mdash;the publicity, 
the police-court, and, above all, the newspapers? 
Excuse me, sir," she added, "for my boldness; 
but I thought you were hardly in a fit state to
judge of the matter calmly, sadly beaten and treated
as you have been."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the stranger. "Indeed,
when I reflect, I could not have done a more foolish
and ruinous thing. It might mar every prospect I
have in life. I suppose," he added, with an attempt
at a smile, which we must characterise as a ridiculous
failure, "that I must pay the penalty of my rashness
in entering such a place. I assure you it is the first
time I ever did such a thing in my life. I was impelled 
by a silly curiosity, and it will be a lesson to
me as long as I live. And now, my friend, you will
add to the favour by giving me the shelter of your
roof and a little soap and water, that I may refit, and
make myself a little less hideous, before I return to my
hotel."</p>

<p>While saying this the pair had advanced, the
gentleman in evident pain and difficulty, aided as he
was by his fragile and yet, strange to say, strong
companion, nearly the whole length of a dark and deserted 
street.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

<p>The freshness and purity, so to speak, of the gentleman's 
words and tones had shot a strange sensation
into some true womanly recess of that forlorn female's
heart.</p>

<p>"I dare not ask you into my place," she said; "it
is not a fit one for you&mdash;it is not, indeed."</p>

<p>The young man&mdash;he was about twenty-three years
of age&mdash;regarded her with evident interest. Slight,
dark, and singularly graceful in his appearance; a
thin moustache, and a fringe of glossy whisker alone
redeemed his face from the charge of being too
feminine in his appearance. But for these the young
woman would have taken him for a clergyman&mdash;a
class she had only come into contact with in the
person of the mechanical divine who had buried her
child but a fortnight before in Brompton Cemetery,
and who was fast becoming imbecile from the melancholy 
and monotonous nature of his daily employment. 
We do not include a pretender whom she once
met in the shape of a tract distributer, who polluted
his holy calling by visiting his "lost and erring sisters,"
as he called them, and using the opportunity it gave
him for the most depraved purposes. But this gentleman 
was what she thought in her heart a clergyman
should resemble.</p>

<p>"If you can take me in," he said with a smile of
mingled sweetness and dignity, "you need not be
afraid. I care not how humble is your abode, and I
will amply reward your kindness."</p>

<p>The girl looked, paused, and hesitated; but an irresistible 
inclination led her to assent. Nor was this
inclination by any means divested of common and

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

selfish motives; for mingled with it was the worldly
craving that he would somehow prove a valuable
friend. And yet no thought of impropriety flashed
across her imagination for a moment. She thought
to herself that a change in her luck might be at
hand&mdash;that something very good was about to happen
to her&mdash;had she not just picked up a little steel horse-shoe 
broken from a brooch or shawl-pin?</p>

<p>"Well," she said, with a momentary look that
might have become a vestal martyr beaming from
some painted window in the glory of a summer eve&mdash;a 
look that was, strange to say, almost angelic in
its expression, in spite of her worn features and eyes,
from which the lustre, and hope, and joyousness of
youth seemed to have fled and for ever departed&mdash;"well, 
I do not think I could easily refuse any
request to you. You seem so good and noble," she
added, with something which almost did duty for a
blush suddenly overspreading her countenance, and
as suddenly disappearing, as if it were a momentary
reflection of flame.</p>

<p>To speak the truth, the aspect of her face, taken in
connexion with her general surroundings, would
have suggested little save low dissipation and habitual
vice to the practised eye, but to Lord Egbert Montreville&mdash;for 
such was her companion's title and name&mdash;it 
spoke only of privation and want, a piteous tale of
a poor needlewoman's distress.</p>

<p>"And what is your occupation, may I ask?" pursued 
Lord Egbert. The girl looked down and answered 
not a word. "I mean, do you work at any

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

business&mdash;such as a milliner's, for example? I hope
you do not think me very curious," he said.</p>

<p>A slight spasm quivered over her expressive face,
followed by a shade so dark that the young man
actually looked up, as if he fancied something had
flitted over their heads. A sudden and violent attack
of pain in his hip, where he had received a severe
kick from one of the myrmidons of Mr. Slimy Cash,
caused him at the moment to stagger and lean rather
heavily upon his companion. To his surprise, he
perceived that she was trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not annoyed you by asking your
occupation; but judging from"&mdash;(here he involuntarily 
looked at her shabby attire and hesitated)&mdash;"from 
the hour at which you are abroad," he said,
with some confusion, "I&mdash;&mdash; Pardon me, it is very
possible that you have known better days."</p>

<p>His companion shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have known but few days," she said, "but those
of poverty and shame." (Defiantly.) "I don't
think you will go home with me if I tell you what
I am. But what would be the use of lying? I am
what man, not God, has made me! but you need not
be afraid of coming home to my lodging, sir," she
added, "for all that. You are different from any
one to whom I ever spoke in my whole life before. I
know a good man when I see one; because," she
added, bitterly, "I suppose I have met so many that
are bad."</p>

<p>To say that Lord Egbert was greatly shocked and
surprised would be an exaggeration in which, as

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

faithful historians, we shall not indulge. But he was
both a little surprised and shocked. Like a true
gentleman and Christian, as he was&mdash;ay, and an
eccentric young nobleman to boot&mdash;one of the most
delicate of that chivalry now, alas! become so rare
even in its rougher attributes and ruder shape&mdash;he
replied, almost lightly, though there was deep feeling 
and pity mingled in his tones:</p>

<p>"Nay, you have not frightened me, though I am
very sorry for what I have just heard. I cannot tell
you how sorry, my poor girl." And he purposely
leaned a trifle more heavily on her arm, as they continued 
to pursue their way. "And now I will tell
you something of my own history," he said, almost
gaily. "I am engaged to be married almost immediately 
to a young lady, and we are going out to a
distant colony, where I am nominated to an appointment. 
And I am truly grateful to you for your aid,
and, above all, for your good sense, which prevented
me from rushing into a disgraceful notoriety, which
might have required more explanation than I should
have cared to give, and perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;have
injured both my prospects and happiness."</p>

<p>"I am sure," said his companion, with a voice
slightly husky and unsteady, "that the lady, if she
is worthy of you, would never have thought any
harm. I am sure that <i>I</i> should not, but then I am very
different from a lady like her. I sometimes wonder,"
she added, almost childishly, "what a virtuous young
lady, who has never known any of the wickedness of
this world, is like&mdash;I mean to speak to, and all
that."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

<p>"She is an angel!" cried Lord Egbert.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied his companion, "but then, you see,
I don't know much about angels, except that they
have wings. I sometimes dream that even I have
wings in my sleep."</p>

<p>Talking in this manner, with an eccentricity of
confidence on the part of the young nobleman, and in
a tone and style on the part of his companion, interesting 
from its simplicity and earnestness, though
mingled with a kind of latent desperation and hopeless 
abandon, which it was saddening to feel rather
than observe on the part of one so young, and apparently 
friendless and forlorn, the pair proceeded
slowly on their way through some of the poorest and
dingiest streets past the Seven Dials. But we must
pause for a moment to afford our readers some insight
into the character, habits, and disposition of Lord
Egbert Montreville.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE LADY ELFRIDA.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">A gentle youth;<br/>

Yet full of strong desires&mdash;to be a man;<br/>

And fight the World's great battle on the side<br/>

Of Truth and Justice. We would call him "girl;"<br/>

But never spirit set a lance in rest<br/>

More firm and dauntless.</p>

<p>LORD EGBERT MONTREVILLE was an enthusiast,
a visionary if you please, a man altogether unlike
what one ordinarily meets with in this world. With
a constitution far from robust, he had led a life chiefly
of seclusion and study; he avoided the society of
men of his own age, from utter indifference if not
aversion to most of their pursuits. He was the
youngest son of a noble family possessed of great influence 
on the Tory side of politics; but his peculiar
views led him to entertain rather ultra-liberal principles 
in many things. He was an ardent friend of
all oppressed nationalities, and possessed the confidence 
of such men as Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Kossuth. 
With the cause of Poland his young name
was identified, wherever the pulse of one of her
hapless sons beat defiance and hatred to the oppressor's 

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

iron rule. For the poor of his own land,
he had a sympathy as painful as it was ardent or
deep. This was by no means the first time he had
talked familiarly with a poor creature in the street.
Nay, he had ventured into many a fever den and
haunt of misery and vice. Nor had he ever had
reason to repent these visits; for the lowest thieves
had never sought to injure him, in return for his
goodness. Their instincts taught them what he was;
and so far they showed themselves superior to the
bravoes of the Escurial, who had so maltreated him
that night. For the ignorant robber and necessitous
thief is far nearer the footstool of Divine mercy and
forgiveness, than the prosperous pander to the vices
for which Society and hypocrisy compound. At
Harrow his girlish face and retiring habits had won
him the nickname of the Lady Elfrida. Yet, strange
to say, even among boys, there was something in his
earnest innocence and generous nature which won
him, from the most brutal and tyrannical, both friendship 
and respect. The Lady Elfrida was petted and
caressed by some of the most fiery spirits among the
elder youths and leaders of the school. Thus he had
long escaped the bullying persecution which most
neophytes underwent. With a favourite chum, he
would pass his leisure time in reading well-thumbed
romances from the chief pastrycook and librarian of
the village, or in strolling about the extensive pleasure-grounds 
of one of the masters of Harrow, which
were, under certain restrictions, not unfrequently
thrown open to the boys. Here he would walk with
his young companion, their arms round each other's

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

necks, singing or reciting such fragments of song
or ballad as struck their boyish imagination and
fancy. At length an incident occurred which brought
out the manly and heroic part of his character, but
caused his early departure from the school. One
day Lord Egbert, then about fourteen years of
age, observed several of the boys engaged, with all
the cruelty of which boys are capable, in teasing
and torturing an old crazy creature, known to
them by the name of "Mad Bess." The chief of
the tormentors was a boy, a year older and half a
head taller, and far stronger than Egbert. This
young brute had just burnt the poor old creature
with a lighted fusee, which he managed to place in
her tangled grey hair, and which caused her to scream
with mingled torture and affright. Lord Egbert ran
to her assistance, and with some difficulty removed
the burning fusee from her elf-locks; but his motives
being misapprehended, the old witch-wife, as they
called her, severely scratched and clawed his face in
requital, which caused the young mischief-makers
exquisite delight. The chief bully especially taunted
and reviled him for his pains, called him a "girl,"
and asked him where his petticoats had been left.
All this and more Lord Egbert would have endured;
but when the other produced a fresh fusee, and
threatened not only to set the old woman alight again,
but to punish the "milk-sop" who interfered, he
told him firmly that he did not care for himself, but
he would not see a finger laid on the poor old creature 
by such a cowardly sneak again. Then the boys
gathered round, and the bully said, "Will you fight

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

me?" and Lord Egbert said he would; and the party
adjourned to the grassy slope beneath the school-house, 
which was the Campus Martius of their
youthful encounters; and Lord Egbert accepted a
second, took off his jacket and waistcoat, and appeared 
in the juvenile ring. As it happened, none of
the elder lads were about. For a quarter of an hour
Lord Egbert seemed nearly at the mercy of his
bigger opponent; and even some of the young scapegraces, 
who usually delighted in a good "mill," declared 
he was a plucky fellow, and should have no
more of it. But Lord Egbert, bruised and bleeding
as he was, and knocked down again and again, came
up pale and stern to the encounter each time, and
bade his friends mind their own business and see
fair play, in a cool and resolute though piping tone,
and so the unequal contest continued. To the surprise 
of all, the red-headed bully, who was somewhat
full in flesh, began at last to breathe thickly and show
symptoms of distress, and three whole rounds passed
without the Lady Elfrida being floored a single time.
Then the tide of battle wavered and changed, and
amid the ringing cheers of those joyous young
patrons of the ring, the bully at last fell before his
youthful opponent, more from exhaustion and the
effects of his own exertions in inflicting punishment,
than from the force of the Lady Elfrida's slender
arm. In a few more rounds, the boys discovered
that the puny and effeminate lordling was actually
fighting for points, and was gradually closing one of
the windows of his burly opponent's savage and vindictive 
soul, with as much purpose as the renowned

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

Thomas Sayers, when he gradually blinded Heenan,
and the fruits of his prowess were snatched from
him by systematic trickery on the part of those
in the opposite faction, when they saw it was only
a matter of a few minutes, and that their champion
would soon be swinging his huge arms about,
helpless, in the dark. Not so the Harrow boys&mdash;they 
had no money on the event&mdash;they were young
Englandites bent on fair-play, and their sympathies
were with the "little un" and the weaker side. A
second time did Master Osborne Clark, the braggart
and animal torturer, embrace his mother earth; but,
unlike Ant&aelig;us, he rose weakened by each successive
fall. Then the boys' enthusiasm knew no bounds.
Up went caps and jackets into the air, and the cries
of "Go it, little un!" "Pitch it into him, your ladyship!" 
"Close his other shutter!" "Don't go in
for a fall!" resounded over the field. A few minutes
after, the blinded and crest-fallen bully was led ignominiously 
from the field; but the victory cost Egbert
dear. Another minute, and he fainted in his second's
arms. A surgeon was sent for, and the boy taken
home, whence the family physician imperatively forbade 
that he should be sent again. His constitution
had received a severe shock, he said; and he would
not answer for the consequences, if the lad returned
to school. Such was the boy, father of the man,
whom we have seen assaulted and kicked out of the
Escurial in so unprovoked and ignominious a manner.
Such are the contrarieties, the injustice, and absurdity
of human life, wherein no man who is a living actor
in it can say what a day will bring forth, into what

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

snare he may fall, what mishap may occur to him, or
whether his life and character are assured to him for
an hour. Such was the man whom, with unsuspecting 
confidence, we see accompanying a frail and
apparently most dangerous female to her dwelling,
impelled only by an absurd and altogether insufficient
want, if it really were one, which could have been far
better satisfied at any coffee-house or apothecary's
shop which he passed on his eccentric course.</p>

<p>WE left our ill-assorted couple wending their way,
as best they might, somewhere in the unenticing
neighbourhood of the Seven Dials.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed, for one instant, that our
bruised knight-errant and his attendant damsel passed
through the dingy quarter of the town where they

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

shortly found themselves, without eliciting comment
or remark. Low-browed cads and belated hucksters,
and the vagabonds who hang about the corners of
the streets, round "sloop"-stalls and potato-cans,
were profuse in their loudly uttered remarks and
criticisms.</p>

<p>"My eyes, Bill, twig that genteel cove with his
heye in mourning and his 'ead in a sling."</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, Jem," a shrill voice would cry, "here's
a nobleman in disguise come hup to town to sell his
father's hold clothes."</p>

<p>"Vy he's been a fightin' along with that bloomin'
beauty."</p>

<p>"I say, hold chap," another would exclaim, "hi!
you with the torn 'andkercher, can't yer afford better
duds for yer fancy gal than them rags of hern?"</p>

<p>"Here's a swell as have been fightin'!"</p>

<p>"I say, Sal, you're in luck to-night. What
the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; air you bin arter?"</p>

<p>Such exclamations as these were far more frequent
than amusing; except perhaps to the ignorant and
depraved utterers of them. And, oh! ye law-givers
and law-makers, and ofttimes law-breakers, in power
and in affluence, have you ever studied the worst
features of the back slums of London? Have you
ever thought of what an execution-mob multiplied by
four score, ay forty score, would be, if ever it were let
loose in this wealthy England? Have you thought
what the poverty-stricken masses would do, in their
brutal ignorance, and with the festering hatred of
their hearts, if they were ever once unchained amongst
you? The deeds of the French Revolution would

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

pale in insignificance before the cannibal revenge of
the lower classes in this country. And who could
wonder at&mdash;we had well-nigh said&mdash;who could blame
them? Have you clothed and fed them, have you
educated them, and brought them up with the knowledge 
of God in their hearts? Your emigrants,
whom you might have made an element of strength,
had you sent them out to your own magnificent
colonies, as you might have done with a blessing, in
the idle ships of your proud navy, only waft back a
burning curse from their rebellious hearts. And
here at home you lack sailors and soldiers, to maintain 
your misused power, and are burdened with a
costly machinery that can scarcely keep your criminal
and pauper population in check. Some such thoughts
as these hastily flitted through Lord Egbert's brain,
as he passed through the squalid streets, where
humanity had almost lost its distinctive traits in the
repulsive features and expression of the hideous and
unearthly-looking wretches around. How loathsome
appeared their food-shops, where "luxuries" which
thousands would have deemed themselves too happy
to have the pence to purchase, were repulsively displayed; 
meat-shambles, with their flaring gas-lights,
from whose diseased "cag-mag" the pampered beasts
at the Zoological Gardens would turn. Then there
were stalls of molluscous products unknown even by
name to consumers above the lowest class; fish-counters 
where stale plaice showed their typhoid-like
spots, alongside of heaps of bruised sprats, and Dutch
herrings impregnated with more than Dead Sea salt.
Decayed vegetables, and goitred apples of Cretin

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

growth; dirty and ill-baked bread of clammy appearance 
and unwholesome hue; clothes-marts that seem
to threaten the air with contagion, and the earth with
parasitical life; coal-sheds where damp and stony
fuel costs the poor man one hundred per cent.
more than the rich, with long credit to be added
in on their side, ever pay&mdash;these are some of the
temptations which invite the working man to lay out
his hard-earned wages, in order that his wife and
little ones may eat the scanty dole which sometimes
supports, and not unfrequently poisons, the springs
of existence in their shrunken veins. Beyond this,
there is a depth far lower still; the penniless vagrant
and the starving outcast, whose dying moans curdle
the icy blast and infect the damp and noxious atmosphere 
of the narrow and greasy street, the blind alley
and the murderous slum. And beyond this again lie
the police-court, the gaol, the hospital, the workhouse,
and the grave!</p>

<p>What are the enjoyments of the poor? None,
literally none; save those which are blistered by Sin
and Shame, and breathed on by Death. You, legislators 
and Pharisees, who take such a morose delight
in worrying with over-legislation those who have so
little to solace the toils and miseries of life, what is it
that inspires your selfish aims? You would ruin the
trade of the respectable licensed victualler by robbing
the poor man of the means of refreshment and necessary 
sustenance, through the iniquitous restriction
of your arbitrary laws. You make his Sunday a
day of brutal impiety, a day sacred to drink and
blasphemy; drink within legal and stated hours for

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

drunkenness, and blasphemy throughout all, from
haggard morn to ghastly night. You carefully and
piously close every institution that could possibly
instruct and divert his mind, while you loll in your
clubs and carriages, quaff your claret at any hour of
the Lord's Day, indulge in swinish gluttony, and
finish with cards, or a "little music," which the
most decent or hypocritical sinners among you call
"sacred," with an effrontery which makes your
servants grin, and your sons and daughters smile
over the hollowness of your hearts. The very waste
in your kitchens would provide all the hungry
wretches in your cities with a meal; yet you deny it,
and give it not. Lo! on your palace-roofs and
housetops brood vast phantoms of vengeance, sitting
darkly with closed wings, until the hour arrives, as
vultures await a feast, after the encounter of armed
hosts.</p>

<p>The singular and unequal pair, whose proceedings
we have endeavoured so far to commemorate, at
length reached a row of somewhat tall but unwholesome-looking 
houses situated in the debatable land
between St. Giles's and Holborn. Achilles'-buildings, 
as we will call them, had formerly been the
abode of respectability, and even distinction, about
the period when Addison's "Spectator" astonished
the public with its fine writing. Somehow or other,
they had degenerated, as human beings sometimes
do, till they became the habitation of thieves, forgers,
magsmen, and felons of every degree. A corner
house, rather larger than the others, was converted 
into a den of notorious infamy in its day, and

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

received the nickname of "The Greenhouse," it might
be difficult to say how or why. Perhaps it was kept
by a matron of the name of Green; perhaps it was
owing to the fittings of some one of its numerous
apartments; perhaps it was originated in an allusion
to the verdant nature of the fools and profligates
allowed within its precincts; perhaps, and more
probably, it had at some period boasted green blinds
and curtains, or a green door. We leave this to be
determined by the curious in such matters, who are
always poking their noses into the rubbish of some
ignominious dust-hole of antiquity. Certain it is, that
over that house, for nearly a century, there had hung
the gloom of crime and mystery. Dark and terrible
deeds were said to have taken place in it; and unquestionably 
one horrid murder had been committed
there in the present century, the perpetrator of which
never paid the penalty of his crime. Some forty years
before, an attempt had been made to cleanse and
purge these polluted dwellings. For a time, two or
three decent families made an effort to reside there,
while the rest remained tenantless; until decay set in
and all the remaining windows were broken. Then
they relapsed into something approaching their former
state. A clan of low Irish, and some poor families
of workmen, settled there. Gradually it became a
crowded rookery of poverty, squalor, and disease.
The houses in their interior economy resembled some
of the worst flats in the Old Town of Edinburgh.
There was a fetid smell common to all, blotched and
yellow walls, broken staircases, and general dirt,
decay, and wretchedness. In most cases the grey

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

old grimy doors, whose strength had outlived the
violence of drunken inmates and visitors, as well as
the frequent attacks of constables, were never latched,
or effectually closed, either by day or night. A low
beer-shop flanked the other end of these gloomy habitations, 
whence shriek, and oath, and brawl often
startled the hurrying passer-by, from dusk to midnight. 
Two or three cellars were open by day for
the sale of second-hand shoes and boots, and slop-clothings; 
whence might be seen poking and protruding 
various hooked-noses of the sausage type
appertaining to the chosen people, from paroquet to
macaw size, from the promising proboscis of snivelling 
infancy and dirt-pie beatitude, to the mighty
shadow-stretching "Wellingtonius giganteus" of the
patriarch of the slums. Into by no means the least
forbidding of these houses did Lord Egbert follow
his companion, who pushed its door open, without
the slightest appearance of hesitation or fear. To say
that he felt quite at his ease would be a statement in
which we should be sorry to indulge.</p>

<p>For throughout this narrative to state truthful
facts is our chief endeavour and pride, even at the
risk of offending those to whom the trite aphorism,
that "truth is stranger than fiction," is not present
to act as sponsor and defender of our relation. To
narrate common and every-day events is an easier
task than to unravel the dark web of mystery and
improbability in human events. The human heart
itself is always sufficiently strange and subtle in its
promptings and windings, its desires and concealments, 
to afford ample scope even for the chronicler

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

of the ordinary occurrences of life in a parsonage or
a village to amuse, and even astonish, if he or she
have the genius to do so. We have taken rougher
and bolder work in hand. We might skim more
pleasantly over the surface of life, and yet suggest
many things to the credit side of the devil, with a
laxity of purpose, or a design not to be found in
this work. Nor are the reflections scattered throughout 
these pages of a character either to flatter or
please the respectable hypocrites of Society, or of
that most pernicious deluder, both of himself and of
others, the British optimist of the nineteenth century;
the man of gas and steam, of Crystal Palace (closed
on Sundays) and high art, the babbler about "geist,"
whatever that may be, the philanthropic blower of
starving rebels from great guns in the red mist of
blood and shamble-stench of smoke, the remedial
patchwork agitator of plans to repair the tattered,
shattered, hopeless humanity of the lower classes, as
you would stop an inundation with a spadeful of
sand, or stanch the bleeding wounds of a nation with
a pinch of the nap from the sterile brim of a Quaker's
pretentious hat. Our diatribes will only meet with a
healthy response in youthful or earnest hearts; in the
breasts of the old who have stood aside and apart
during the riot of a godless age; in the feelings of
men who have still something of the old Cromwellian
spirit surging in their veins; or in the Falklands who
grieve over England amid the rage of party strife, and
the conflict of mediocrities in the emulous struggle
for place and power which destroys our greatness
and barters away our rights. To those whose minds

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

embrace any grand and generous scheme of regeneration, 
we alone address the moral of these pages.
Alas! could our existing laws put down all rampant
and external vice, there would be none save hypocrites 
left. As it is, they only foster and increase it.</p>

<p>Lord Egbert's refined senses and culture caused
him to sicken and shudder at the objects by
which he found himself surrounded. Yet not less
patiently did he wait in the reeking passage whilst
his improper acquaintance sought and lighted a
guttering dip, with which, shading it in a somewhat
downcast and timid manner with a hand which might
have been almost transparent, but for its manifest
dingy hue, she lighted her aristocratic companion up
the rickety stairs. There was some trace of the
ancient uses and substantial prosperity of the house
still discernible in fragments of scrollwork in the
ceilings of the landing-places, and in the oak banisters, 
in which deep cuts and dilapidations had
become rounded by use, and greased by the contact
of many a dirty hand. The ground-floor passage
might be characterised as tomb-like and frowzy; one
might have fancied oneself in the sepulchre of all the
modern tribe of Nathan&mdash;it was like coming on the
remains of a full-flavoured family of Roman money-lenders 
in Pompeii or Herculaneum, or perhaps it
might be better described as resembling a sniff of the
pit of an East-end theatre on a Saturday night under
a plentiful dispensation of "paper" from a Hebrew
lessee. From a room on the first floor came sounds
of oaths and revelry; from the second, a noise of
oaths and wife-beating; from the third, oaths alone.

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

From one of the garrets on the fourth floor they
heard the voice of a child crying and moaning as if
from hunger&mdash;a wail of the great London wilderness,
that, often heard, causes some to disbelieve in the
existence of a God at all; and some to believe that
there is, and must be, a Supreme Being to rectify
the injustice visited even on babes and sucklings
here, in another and a far different world. The
opposite and remaining door was ajar, and Lord
Egbert and his conductress silently entered. The
room was poorer but certainly cleaner than he expected. 
All the furniture consisted of a wretched
wooden bedstead, with apparently but scanty clothing;
a deal table; a single visible chair, on which from
sheer pain and exhaustion he sank down; a box which
apparently served occasionally as a second seat; a
washing-stand, and an empty bird-cage. Yes, there
was something else. A child's cot, carefully covered up,
stood on a second chair, which it partially concealed,
in a corner of the room parallel with the bed. "Good
Heavens!" thought Lord Egbert, as he glanced from
his companion, who was busy doing her best to light
a fire in the narrow grate, "is it possible that a
young mother can leave her child and rove abroad in
the streets in this manner?" He shuddered as he
thought that perhaps maternal instinct drove her
wolf-like to prowl forth in search of sustenance by
night. Thinking thus, he rose softly, and approached
the cradle to look at the sleeping babe. Very gently
and slowly he lifted the humble coverlet, and peeped
within, expecting to see a pale and sickly little face
of slumbering innocence, for it was evident in his

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

thought that the little occupant slept. Perhaps the
mother, impelled by dire necessity, had given it a
dose of one of those terrible sedatives which the poor
are forced to use, and which sometimes turn a fretful
doze into everlasting sleep&mdash;an "elixir," or "cordial,"
prepared and sold by the skeleton apothecary, Death.
Had he thought more curiously, he might have
wondered that the young mother did not rush to her
child's cradle to see how it had fared during her
absence, and perhaps imprint a passionate kiss on
its little brow or lips. But then he was not much
experienced in maternal ways. So he peered into
the cradle in a very benevolent manner, considering
his age and sex, somewhat curious to see what sort
of an atomic image of humanity was reposing therein.
But there was nothing there. Yes, there was a little
withered bundle of violets, which, sooth to say, had
been bought in the streets, and which, could tears
have revived them, would have looked as fresh as
when they were gathered in a nurseryman's grounds
somewhere between Wandsworth and New Brompton. 
Could the red core of the mother's anguished
heart have revivified their cut stalks, as we read in
the recipes of the "Family Herald" that sealing-wax
properly applied will do, they would have bloomed
in that cradle for many a day. Why are some
children born but to die; nay, why are others born
to live, we would say? To one a gilded fuss, and the
pomp of servile over-care that may kill equally with
neglect; to another a very brief and uncomfortable
inheritance of "Trismus neonatorum"&mdash;nothing save
workhouse convulsions to notify that a soul has lived

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

to hear a few groans in this world, and gone back
thither whence it came, to furnish a blank little page
in the Divine Judgment Book above. To this last,
a mere shiver of the knocker on the door of human
existence, promptly answered by the voice of Fate,
"There is no room here!"</p>

<p>Better this than to be swaddled in a palace, and
buried wrinkled and grey-headed in a cathedral,
leaving none to shed a tear, after having caused a sea
of tears and blood to flow during a weary lifetime of
unhallowed deeds.</p>

<p>Very quickly, but still gently, did Lord Egbert
suffer the covering of the cradle to shroud its silent
emptiness again. He saw with pain that the mother
had observed his action, by the added rapidity and
confusion of her fingers, as she sought to thrust the
falling sticks of wood through the bars of the grate;
nay, he heard it in the agitated rustle of the paper
with which she renewed the failing experiment to
create a blaze. He saw her lithe frame sway to and
fro, as, still on her knees, she reached the candle from
the ground by her side to set a light to her handiwork 
again. As the fire suddenly flared up, he
noticed what he had not seen before, that she was
in a sort of shabby apology for mourning. Why
should he have noticed that? So many women wear
black, who are not in mourning, and so many wear
mourning who are not in black. One may dress in
sombre clothes for a sick hope, or a guilty life, or
because it is becoming, or because the wearer has no
other garments to put on. Lord Egbert was in a
dilemma&mdash;he did not know exactly what to do.

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

When they meet as perfect strangers for the first time,
under odd circumstances, and without introduction,
people are very apt to be extremely confidential and
tell each other all their secrets, especially if they are
sorrows and complaints. On the other hand, the ice
being once broken, one naturally wants to know
everything, just because one knows nothing at all.
So Lord Egbert spoke out accordingly, and said:</p>

<p>"I fear you have had a sad loss very lately&mdash;have
you not?"</p>

<p>Then she uprose and told him all about it, with
clasped hands and streaming eyes, and frequent adjurations 
to Heaven. She asked God to witness how
she loved her child&mdash;all that she had ever had to
love in this world. And she said that He also knew
that she wished to die, and follow her boy to his
grave, as soon as it pleased Him to release her from
a life of utter misery and woe. She had first thought
of starving herself to death, "and that" (with a
bitter laugh) "would not be very difficult, you know.
I should not have to buy anything for that." But a
kind friend&mdash;a poor creature little better off than
herself&mdash;had come in and forced her to eat. It
was she who helped to bury the child&mdash;it was done
very respectably, she said, and they had a mourning-coach&mdash;"and 
I could not refuse her well&mdash;could I?"
she said, "when she knelt by me and entreated me
to live?" The last few days she had felt quite careless 
and numb-like, and didn't care how things went.
But the few words he had spoken to her had somehow
put quite a new feeling into her heart. The story
was nearly all true; except that she had not confessed 

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

that after the first shock was over, she had felt
more anxiety to live and do something better for herself, 
than ever she had experienced before, and that
when she first saw Lord Egbert, she somehow fancied
that he would bring her luck. Perhaps she had not
very carefully analysed her own feelings, and was
scarcely conscious of her exact mental state herself.
Then, with all the volubility of grief, when it finds a
sympathising listener, or indeed any listener at all,
she went on to tell him, that she had been very, very
bad, and that her evil habits had indirectly caused
her poor child's death. She told him that she had
been a confirmed gin-drinker, and a beggar in the
streets, sunk in the lowest depths of penury and vice.
But there was one thing, she had always avoided
when she could. Just before the child's illness, she
had twice met a kind and disinterested gentleman who
had bestowed on her a bountiful alms.</p>

<p>"Not a gentleman like you," she said, "but quite
a gay and careless sort of man; yet, oh! very kind
and good. The first time he gave me money, it did me
more harm than good. I deceived him, and I think
there was a curse with it. For I left my poor dear
angel that is gone to the care of strangers, and went
out and treated a parcel of wretches, and lost all
recollection for days. It was like a hideous dream
of leering faces and gay dresses, and jingling glasses
and flaring lights," she said; and the poor creature
passed her hand over her brow. "But I beg pardon,
sir, I am detaining you. Will you not wash the dirt
and blood away?"</p>

<p>Lord Egbert requested her to go on. He wanted

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

to know, how the change, which must have taken
place in her since this awful period of depravity and
dissipation, had set in.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she said, "the money all went; and I
was beaten, just as you have been, by some women
whom I could afford to treat no more, and my poor
child showed symptoms of sickening, and I went out
one dreadful pouring night in sheer desperation and
horror&mdash;I don't know for what or wherefore. If I
could have got a little drink, I think I should have
drowned myself off Waterloo Bridge. I knew a
girl who had done it; and there was another who
had sworn a solemn oath she would do it any time
with me. I went to her lodgings; but she was in bed
quite stupefied with drink, and I could not get even
the price of a glass from her. Well, sir, I was wandering 
along, thinking if I should be able to pick up
a few pence, before the public-houses were closed,
when I met the gentleman who had assisted me so
generously, again, face to face, in the Strand."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," interrupted Lord Egbert,
"how it was that you first met him, and how he came
to assist you so amply and generously as you say?
For it seems, however charitable, an unwonted and
eccentric act."</p>

<p>"I can only tell you, sir," she answered, "that he
seemed a very rich and thoughtless gentleman, though
I ought not to say so, for Heaven knows he had
thought enough for me; and he met me one afternoon 
about the same place in the Strand, and I
noticed that he looked very hard at me indeed as he

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

passed by. I must tell you that I was very different
then to what you see me now."</p>

<p>Lord Egbert frowned and bit his lip, but said
nothing. To his surprise she resumed:</p>

<p>"I was then literally a heap of rags, swarming
with vermin, and with scarcely a shoe to my foot.
I don't think such a figure was to be seen anywhere, 
unless, perhaps, in the worst part of Bethnal
Green. Some of the people who were used to see
me called me the 'Phantom!' and 'Rags!' and others
nicknamed me 'Blue Ruin!' and I don't know what
besides."</p>

<p>Lord Egbert's face brightened. He had feared
that she was about to tell him that she was far more
attractive then. And attractive he could easily
imagine that she had been, and might be again.
Indeed, there was an indefinable charm of natural
grace about her even then&mdash;a sort of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and
vivacity, combined with pathos, which interested him
in a wonderful degree.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she continued, "the gentleman
turned and passed me again, and then turned back
quite suddenly. 'My good creature,' he said, 'do
pray tell me, are you obliged to come out like this?'
and then he asked me all about myself. I don't
know what put it into my head," she continued,
sadly, "but I answered him with a whole string of
lies, and said I had a home in the country, not far
from Birmingham; and that if I could get there I
should be all right, only that I had not money to pay
the fare, or any clothes to show myself in among

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

respectable people such as my relations were. I
assure you this was a sudden thought; for I never
used to tell any lies, or, in fact, to say anything
about myself. People would often drop money in
my hands, and go away without uttering a word. So
that I had very little occasion to lie to them. But I
was possessed by some wickedness that day which I
have never been able to account for. Well, he gave
me five pounds, and a handful of silver besides, and
a lady's address, who he said was to give me some
clothes; and if she gave me one, she gave me twenty
pounds' worth of things&mdash;silk dresses and linen, all
marked with her own initials; and if I did not go
to my relations, the things very soon went to the only
relative I ever knew&mdash;I mean the pawnshop&mdash;and in
a fortnight I was worse off than before, with the addition 
of the bruises I received, and my poor dear
baby sickening to die."</p>

<p>"And tell me what you did when you met the
gentleman a second time?" said Lord Egbert.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she replied, "I felt so ashamed&mdash;miserable 
and degraded as I was&mdash;that I turned
and ran away as fast as my legs would carry me.
To my utter surprise and astonishment, the gentleman 
followed me. He would never have caught me,
if I hadn't turned up a sort of street with no outlet,
you know, where he ran me into a corner."</p>

<p>"And what did he say then?" pursued her interrogator. 
"Do you know, if your story were a little
less strange, I should find a difficulty in believing
in it?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is a bit more strange than that

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

you should be here now," was the quick answer; a
proposition in which Lord Egbert could not but tacitly
acquiesce.</p>

<p>"He only asked me," she resumed, "why I ran
away in that manner, and gave me a lot of loose
silver, with a sovereign amongst it."</p>

<p>"And you have never seen him since?" said Lord
Egbert.</p>

<p>"Never!" was the answer. "That night I went
home quite sober&mdash;and did all I could, but too late,
too late, to save my poor murdered innocent. But
he never looked up any more. He had caught a
cold and fever through my drunken neglect of him.
Do you know, sir, that if I had done my duty by
him, I think I should be almost glad that he was
removed out of this wicked, wretched world&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The world," said Lord Egbert, "is often what
wicked and wretched people make it."</p>

<p>"It may be so," she exclaimed, "with many; but
not with me. I never had a chance to be either good
or happy."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have one now," was the grave
and quiet answer, in a tone which admitted no doubt
both of the speaker's power and intentions to carry
out what he said; "that is," he added, after a pause,
"if you have the determination and resolution to
will it yourself; for the chance is all that I can give
you."</p>

<p>All the answer that the bereaved mother made was
to kneel down by the side of the empty cradle, and
with streaming hair and eyes to utter a few incoherent 
expressions of pain and sorrow, mingled with

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

gratitude and hope. As she knelt, the solitary candle
flickered in its socket, and the cold and bright moon
shed an unearthly radiance over her features, while
the tall dark figure of Lord Egbert stood erect like a
father confessor listening to the recital of a dying
Magdalen's sins, and the avowal of her repentance.
And the young man of birth and fashion silently
put up a prayer for all human creatures of sin and
misery, and for her whose strange story had filled his
heart with gentle pity and interest.</p>

<p>The greatest patriot and philosopher would not have
despised that scene. Either a Garibaldi, or a Victor
Hugo&mdash;we grieve not to be able to name a great
Englishman of equal breadth of dignity, and catholic
nobility of soul; but there doubtless exist many who
are unknown to fame&mdash;might have acted like Lord
Egbert under similar circumstances, were their sympathies 
withdrawn from a wider circle, and their charity
from a grander and more comprehensive range. Many
professors of philanthropy and world-graduates, and
hollow success-vaunters of the day will authoritatively
put down Lord Egbert as a sentimental fool, and
declare with a sneer they consider him little better
than a lunatic for his pains. Perhaps so; but it is
certain that he was unconsciously imitating, at a
humble distance, a great example set nearly two
thousand years ago, which a large portion of mankind 
have been constantly preaching, and not practising, 
nearly ever since, in the most remarkable manner. 
We cannot help thinking that, if the Saviour
Himself were to appear now in London, and conduct
Himself, as He once did in Galilee, by the banks of

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

the Thames, He would be committed as a rogue and
a vagrant by a metropolitan magistrate or a city Lord
Mayor, if His poverty secured Him from the considerate 
attentions of a mad-doctor. The cry would
not be "Crucify him!" but "Lock him up! Lock
him up!" What should we think of the eccentricity
of a bishop, who despoiled himself of even one-half
of his worldly goods, who acted up to any part of his
hebdomadal profession of faith? The Ephesian
shrine-makers of old were true to Diana, whose
creed was probably not a difficult one to follow; but
we continue with avidity to make the shrines, and
yet practically to deny that God in whose name they
are manufactured, with the most perfect and complete 
contrariety that human ingenuity ever furnished. 
There is earnestness in the customs of
Dahomey, and devotion in the ministration of a
Thug; these mean what they profess, and act it.
Not so the modern Christian doctrinaire, whose principles 
and practice are antagonistic, in proportion to
the fervency of his teaching and the ardour of his
zeal.</p>

<p>The great bell of Westminster sounded the hour of
midnight funereally through the air, as if it were
tolling for a nation's death.</p>

<p>"Well, my poor girl," said Lord Egbert, "I will
just avail myself of your kindness to improve my appearance 
a little; and then I will ask you to light me
down-stairs. But what is your name and address?"</p>

<p>"Kate Darrell," was the reply, "seven, Achilles'-buildings."</p>

<p>"Will a note find you?" asked Lord Egbert.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

<p>The reply was in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then I will write," he said, "and make an
appointment; and in the mean time we will both
consider what is best to be done for you. Your education 
does not appear to have been entirely neglected."</p>

<p>"Alas!" she replied, "I can scarcely write at
all."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought so," observed Lord
Egbert, "from the manner in which you speak."</p>

<p>"I am very quick at learning, I believe," said Kate,
as we will now call her. "I am told I should make
my fortune on the stage."</p>

<p>Lord Egbert shook his head. Inexperienced as he
was, he knew how utterly meaningless, ninety-nine
times out of a hundred, is such a remark. "I think,"
he said, "you would find dress-making, or a little
shop, more profitable; but you shall do as you like.
But which is it to be, tragedy or comedy?" he asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>"You must not judge of me as I am now," she
answered. "I used to be the merriest, and, some said,
the funniest girl alive. It seems a long time ago,
although I am barely eighteen now. Though I have
never known any real happiness or comfort, but been
nurtured amid scenes of misery, that you cannot
even imagine, I am sure; yet when I have had the
slightest opportunity, I was always the leader in mischief 
and fun. It was that which got me at last into
the frightful habits I have told you of, and from
which I was saved alone by that gentleman's act of
kindness, and, oh! that I should say it, the loss of

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

my child. I have never touched a drop of anything
stronger than tea since; not even on the day when I
buried him, though they pressed me very hard to
drink then, and drown my sorrow, as they said. If
I had not had the strength to refuse, my sorrows
would have been drowned by this time, and myself
with them, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>During all their conversation, Lord Egbert never
once alluded to the father of the child, nor asked her
any leading question as to the particular events of
her life. He rightly guessed that there was nothing
in it that could be remedied or improved by meddling
with griefs that might or might not be healed and
cicatrised by necessity or time. The truth is, that the
father of the child was dead too&mdash;lay peacefully
slumbering in the vicinity of Sebastopol, wrapped in
a gorgeously tasselled dressing-gown, which he was
wont to wear in life; and which one of his brother
officers, the self-appointed sexton of his brigade, himself 
formerly one of the gayest men on town, had
chosen for his winding-sheet of glory in such hurried
obsequies as he could afford. Nor was the gallant
and tawny Captain Durant very guilty, so far as Kate
had been concerned. In truth, he had been very kind
to her, and fully meant to be more so; but the shell
which killed him, one of the very first after landing,
also exploded in a certain genteel lodging in Albany-street, 
Regent's Park, and very direful were the consequences 
thereof. There were many fond and dear
ties severed besides those of matrimony and relationship 
by that Russian war. Many a slender, lily-like
being, whose wedding-ring was not placed on her

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

finger at the altar, or by a license, that we can properly
term "special," bowed her head and died, when one
name had met her burning gaze, and the newspaper
had fallen from her opening fingers convulsed with
grief; ay, perhaps, more than out of a like number
of wedded wives; for these had not lost every tie in
this world, and the former had. Nay, there were
flaunting widowhoods, even in the Casino, and the
"Rooms," which were not altogether devoid of deep
feeling and regret, as some more real widowhoods are.
Thus it appears that Kate had known some few
months of comfort in her life; before sinking into
even worse depths of wretchedness than had signalised
her early career.</p>

<p>That night, or rather morning, as she crept beneath
her narrow coverlet, after Lord Egbert had departed
to his luxurious hotel, she felt the strongest presentiment 
that she was on the threshold of a new phase of
existence; that, in her own phraseology, her luck
had changed, and that she was about to enter on a
new and promising career. We will leave her to her
dreams, strange and mingled as they were, half of
heaven and half of earth, now bright with innocence,
and now with worldly pomp. We will leave her to
wander, dressed in a spotless robe of white, through
summer meadows, leading her prattling boy, picking
celestial daisies and buttercups at her side. We will
leave her to curtsy among a bevy of duchesses at a
Court ball, while Lord Egbert, in a magnificent
uniform, with a beautiful fairy on his arm, smiled
approval on so distinguished and fashionable a d&eacute;but.

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

We will let her rustle among the gorgeous personages
of a theatrical scene, while poor Captain Durant
bowed approval from a side-box. Gradually his
features change and stiffen; and the bouquet he was
about to throw to her feet turns into a bunch of
decayed and contorted weeds, as if in mockery, at her
feet. She would kick them away, but they change
to serpents, and crawl up her limbs. Horror! she
is in rags again; and 'tis a grinning skeleton that
is mopping and mowing at her, yet somehow in the
likeness of the cross young man, assistant at the
pawnbroker's shop. Stay! he throws a bundle at
her. He rejects her pledge. What is it? She tears
it hurriedly open. It is her lost child's little frock
and under-clothes, and tiny ragged shoes. Next a
Shape rises, and mocks her with hoarse screams. 'Tis
the gin-fiend! Avaunt! avaunt! With a choked cry
she is about to awake; but we will not wake her.
With the pale flock of trooping dreams we will glide
softly away from her bedside. We send poor Durant
back to the bloody trench, and the child to his little
grave, so small that it looks hardly like a real thing,
but a mound which children themselves might have
heaped up in their innocent play. We follow Lord
Egbert's noble semblance away, till it glides at
cock-crow through the closed door of the Colonnade
Hotel. And then with a wave of the enchanter's pen
we transport our readers elsewhere. We return this
puppet to its chest, and take out another and another
for brief use, to be put back in its turn. For on this
very morning, ere early London has rubbed its eyes,

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

and finally settled that it is awake; and while the
representatives of the night-bird section of the public
are severally seeking their matutinal roost&mdash;printers,
policemen, newspaper writers, and the like&mdash;we intend
to lay aside our puppets for a triennial rest, and not
to open our galanty show for at least three years, and
in the second volume of our tale.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">BACK TO QUEEN'S-SQUARE.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>The silver orb of Diana shone in the solvent sky like a new florin
just issued from the Mint of Space; the golden stars and constellations
seemed like sovereigns and half-sovereigns hoarded by grandam Nature
until that very date; the Milky-Way showed far off and filmy, like a
distant bill of exchange drawn by Time on Eternity, and indorsed by
an Almighty hand, when Sir Mammon, standing under his Belgravian
portico, suddenly bethought him of that universal panic when the Bank
of the Universe (limited) itself shall break; and thence began to consider 
the nature of the account to be demanded of him hereafter&mdash;his
smooth-written diary of selfishness; his cash-book of avarice and greed;
his small credit column of good deeds and his heavy debit of evil in
the great balance-sheet of life.</p>

<p>And this giant of Cunning, this Colossus of worldly success, cowered
like the ragged school-child he had once himself been; as he sought
in vain to cast up the accusing figures of Doom on the greasy slate of
Memory, smeared over by whining Repentance, ere blotted out for ever
by Death.</p>

<p>Under the blue vault of the silent midnight heavens, his soul stood
stripped and shivering; and he felt like the ghost of a rich man buried
yesterday among the forgotten dead, whose earthly pomp and mansion
had passed away from him, as fleeting clouds from the pale clutch of a
spectre, or shadows from the voiceless whisper of a shade, and whose
treasures were already delivered up for a spoil to those who had amassed
them not.&mdash;<i>The Lucubrations of Arthur Aubrey, Esq. From his
Commonplace Book in 185&mdash;</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>THAT very night Arthur Aubrey and his beautiful
wife had sat up somewhat late, as they were often
wont to do, interchanging their views of life and
manners, discussing their friends and acquaintances,

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

their past, present, and future, and things general
and particular. The subject they had started,
apropos of some topic of the day, was the action of
circumstance upon human actions, and whether a
great deal of soi-disant merit was not born of circumstance, 
and a great deal of crime and wickedness
of misery and want. In this argument Aubrey
showed himself a severe censor of all shortcomings
and backslidings. He said that a thief must be a
thief at heart, in order to become one at all, and
that even necessity was no excuse.</p>

<p>"When you hear," he said, "of a man being
driven to drink by misfortune, it is only because an
excuse is wanted for that which must sooner or later
come out." Prosperity would have developed, according 
to him, the very same latent propensity in the
same man.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Blanche, "you have had no trials&mdash;you 
have known nothing save luxury. You do not
know the temptations of the poor."</p>

<p>"Now," rejoined Arthur, "there are bad husbands, 
you know. I suppose, if I were to turn out a
wretch, under temptations, you would make excuses
for me?"</p>

<p>"Would I?" said Blanche, archly; "but could
you be tempted, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Arthur, "not easily, perhaps, my
love; but circumstances, you know, may be so very
strong, according to your theory. I am sure you
would become my advocate in such a case."</p>

<p>"The crimes of the heart," returned Blanche, "are
precisely those which would plead no 'extenuating

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

circumstances' successfully to me. But regarding the
temptations, for example, of the poor and destitute&mdash;if 
I were starving, would you not break the law
for me?"</p>

<p>"I see," answered Arthur, "that you are bent on
my conviction as a thief. Who can say 'no,' under
such circumstances?"</p>

<p>"If we had a child, and it lacked sustenance," cried
Blanche, "do you think I would not snatch a loaf
from a baker's shop for it? What mother could
restrain her desperation?"</p>

<p>"Yet," said Arthur, "but a few years since, under
the sanguinary laws of England, women were hanged
for such deeds. The starving mother of a starving
child has been executed at Tyburn for stealing a
penny loaf."</p>

<p>Blanche shuddered. "I cannot," she said, "trust
myself to think, much less speak, of such a deed."</p>

<p>"And even now," rejoined Arthur, "the mother
thus acting under the holiest impulse of nature,
would be torn from her offspring and flung into a
gaol, thence to undergo penalties almost worse than
death. But what can Society do? This very night,
there are hundreds perishing in London from want
of common necessaries. The muster-roll of Death,
during a sharp frost in England, is not less numerous
than when cholera stalks lurid through the land. But
you would not suspend the action of the law to let
the suffering poor help themselves? I repeat, what
can Society do?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Blanche, "you can't expect political
economy from me. But I cannot help thinking that

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

in this rich and prosperous country, the governing
powers are criminally to blame to permit such a state
of things."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the poorer classes too," said Arthur;
"are they not improvident in the extreme? Do they
make the best even of what they have? Can they
cook the food they get? Why, not one working
man's wife out of twenty is capable of the commonest
duties of a housewife. Soup, for instance, is almost
unknown to them; and you see the bricklayer dining
on bread and cheese, when for the same money he
might enjoy a nourishing meal. Nor do the men
cultivate their gardens properly, when they have
them. I tell you there are faults on all sides,
Blanche."</p>

<p>"They are ignorant, because they are not taught,"
retorted Blanche; "there is no sympathy between
class and class. I really believe that the middle
classes are the most selfish and repellent of all.
Now," she said, "just look what I do! Look
at my poor people. I actually teach them cottage
economy, and I help to maintain more than a score.
And I'll answer for it, it does not cost you twenty
pounds a-year."</p>

<p>"Not if you take it out of your dress money, my
love," was the answer, accompanied by a smile of
approval.</p>

<p>"And do I not dress well enough to please you?"
said Blanche, demurely. "If not, you are harder
to please than Lady Madeiraville, who is constantly
coming for patterns to your little wife, and who declares 
that somehow she can never get anything so

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

well made as my dresses, though I positively cut out
the last six for her with my own hands."</p>

<p>"Hem!" observed Aubrey, "I suspect that you
must lend her something more than patterns, before
she can rival you in dress."</p>

<p>"What is that?" demanded Blanche, who knew
perfectly well the reply that would follow.</p>

<p>"The most enchanting figure in Christendom,"
replied her husband, passing his hand round the
waist of his beautiful wife, who looked radiant with
innocent delight.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you always love me thus!" murmured
Blanche.</p>

<p>We will not follow Aubrey in his impassioned declarations 
that he must, should, and would; and never
possibly could, help loving her with a love so great
that it was beyond increase, and yet which time
would augment with a cube-rate multiplying power.
After this blazing bouquet of protestations had irradiated 
the serene fancy of Blanche, as some gorgeous
display of divine pyrotechny the calm quietude of a
summer evening sky, it gradually died away, leaving
her mental atmosphere from zenith to horizon flooded
with roseate effulgence, and suffusing her cheeks
with the warmest blushes of delight. These insensibly
paled down to the wonted delicacy of the shell-like
hue of her complexion, as the pair resumed their
every-day and worldly conversation, with the gratifying, 
but by no means original remark on the part
of Aubrey, that he did not think there was a happier 
fellow in the world than himself.</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, "things don't go very well

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

with me in the way of fortune, and that sort of thing.
Somehow," he said, "I seem to pay more for everything 
than anybody else. If I get into a lawsuit, it
don't matter what the case is, I am sure to lose; I
am constantly being robbed and done by everybody;
and as to economising, I find whenever I do try it,
that I am always let into some greater and unexpected 
expense."</p>

<p>At this last remark Blanche smiled. "And
pray, my dear," she said, "when did you ever try
to economise?"</p>

<p>"Why, I rode home on an omnibus from Kensington 
the other day," replied Arthur, gravely,
"and gave the conductor a sovereign instead of a
shilling. I came from Oxford last Tuesday, second-class, 
and lost my purse, and what is more, it always
happens so, somehow."</p>

<p>"Then pray," said Blanche, "avoid such absurd
economies in future. I really think it serves you
right. It is all very well for a millionaire, or a miser;
but why should a gentleman do such things?"</p>

<p>"Then you don't think a millionaire can be a
gentleman?" inquired Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Not easily," was the reply. "Only think of
that horrid Mr. Moneysworth. Such persons are
always as offensive as the gnome king in a pantomime. 
I think Midas must have been an extremely
vulgar and fussy fellow. How odious he made himself 
to Apollo; and that other rich example, Cr&oelig;sus,
must have been a very offensive personage with his
treasures and his wealth. Men with such enormous
means are scarcely ever gentlemen, and you know

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

what the Bible says of a rich man's chance of redemption."</p>

<p>"Then," interrupted Arthur, "you would only
admit gentlemen into heaven?"</p>

<p>"Something like it, I confess," answered Blanche;
"gentlemen in spirit. They may be coal-heavers, for
all I know or care, not 'gentlemen' like George IV.;
but those of nature's type. What does some old
writer beautifully say about the Saviour Himself?
'That He was the first and truest gentleman that
ever lived,' or to that effect."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Aubrey, "I suppose I must
pay a tribute to Fortune in something. Did you ever
hear the story told by Herodotus, about Polycrates,
the tyrant of Samos? His good fortune was so extraordinary 
that he got frightened&mdash;I think he must
have had some such a darling beauty of a wife as
you&mdash;no, that he couldn't, but something approaching 
it, I mean&mdash;and everything succeeded with him,
so he threw a most costly ring into the sea, and a fish
swallowed it, and was caught and cooked for his dinner,
and thus he got it back again, and then he despaired,
for he knew the gods must be meditating some great
coup against him, and at length his luck turned all
at once, and he went to the 'demnition bow-wows,'
as Mr. Mantalini says. At any rate, I hope I need
not fear that. Look at that trial the other day,
Aubrey <i>versus</i> Learyclod. There was an old vagabond
who ruined his farm and shamefully despoiled the
place. I had got a verdict for eight hundred pounds,
when the defendant's counsel, my own friend Salfort&mdash;cleverly 
retained against me, although I instructed

<!-- vol 1 page 304 -->

those precious country solicitors, Messrs. Adderfang
and Badderogue, especially to make sure of him&mdash;discovered 
a flaw in the pleadings drawn by Browning,
the first pleader in England. Consequently, he moved
for a new trial, and then I was advised by my solicitors, 
that the fellow was not only dying, but on the
verge of bankruptcy. Adderfang said, that under the
circumstances, they would forego their own costs, and
so I consented to stop proceedings. And what is the
result? Learyclod has taken another and much
larger farm, and looks as hearty as one of his own
prize-bullocks, and Adderfang shot his own toe off
when rabbit-shooting; and died of mortification, I
suppose, because he couldn't bring an action for
damages against himself; and his partner now repudiates 
his agreement, and I have to pay three hundred
and fifty pounds odd, besides losing my damages.
Now I must say that Phil Cousens would have managed 
matters better than that."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Blanche. "Look at the
recovery of your father's debts. I mean all that
Pettingall has left you to recover; and the horse
case with that dreadful dealer, whom you put as you
said on his mettle and conscience, to furnish you with
a horse for me, telling him that you would give him
his own price; but that you wanted it in a hurry,
and to have no trouble. You said he would not cheat
<i>you</i>, because you had dealt with him at Camford, and
taken his son out hunting with you, his first season,
when he was a little boy in a round jacket. I do
believe that horse represented all the known maladies
in farriery, and all the vices of the manege. It was

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

like one of those demon ponies in Irish fairy-tales&mdash;a
veritable Phooka. Master Cousens did not bring that
to a very happy conclusion; any more than he paid
you for smashing your mail-phaeton and laming poor
Dinah, when you lent them to him so very much
against your will and better judgment."</p>

<p>"Why, you little rogue," said Aubrey, "you are
impeaching my wisdom and superiority of judgment,
by narrating all these disasters."</p>

<p>Blanche sighed, in spite of herself. She feared
sensibly that her husband's generous and confiding
nature would some day or other seriously impair, if
it did not ruin his fortune. She only felt for him,
not herself, should such sad results accrue from his
easy nature, and, it must be said, uncalculating and
reckless improvidence. How little was he capable of
enduring poverty and its concomitants!</p>

<p>"Ah!" she uttered aloud, concealing these dismal
forebodings, "it matters little to me about these
things. I care only on your account if they vex and
annoy you, and darken your opinion of the world
and its denizens. There is but one thing I value, one
jewel that I shrine in my heart of hearts&mdash;your love.
Were I deprived of that, I would not wish to live:
nay, I would not survive it."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to say you would kill yourself?"
inquired Arthur, smiling.</p>

<p>"There would be no need of that," replied Blanche.</p>

<p>"Come! come!" said her husband, "don't let us
talk so dismally. I shall have you maintaining the
theory that suicide is permissible next, under certain
circumstances."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 306 -->

<p>"And is it not?" inquired Blanche, "if one has
nothing left in this world to live for?&mdash;I dare say it is
very wicked to say and feel so; but according to my
ideas, there are circumstances against which it is impossible 
to struggle and to live."</p>

<p>"My dear love," said Aubrey, gravely, "no possible 
earthly contingency can justify any one in laying
violent hands upon the life given by Providence. Tell
me one if you can."</p>

<p>"I could give you a dozen," answered Blanche.
"The first, if you ceased to love me."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied Arthur. "Continue
with the remaining eleven."</p>

"Imagine," said Blanche, "a patriotic victim to
despotic tyranny, such as exists now in Naples; a
man who had conspired against the government under
cruelties and enormities, when, as Schiller says, an
appeal alone remains to the justice of Heaven, and
the sword becomes lawful&mdash;imagine such a man,
devoted to his country, cast into a dungeon on suspicion, 
and tortured to induce him to reveal the names
of his friends and relatives implicated in the plot&mdash;if
plot you can call that, which is the vindication of
outraged manhood, and the sacred rights of citizenship 
and domestic life. Think, if after the first day's
horrible sufferings on the rack inflicted by some
fiendish tribunal of priestly assassins, he felt that his
powers were failing, and that the secret which he
prized far more than life would be wrenched from his
agonising lips, and that on the morrow he might, as
it were, involuntarily and unconsciously betray his
beloved associates and dearest friends&mdash;his father,

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

brothers, sons, and the wife of his bosom. Would
not that man be justified in restoring his soul, unspotted 
by the calamity of so hideous a revelation, to
the Maker on whom he cried in vain to finish his
sufferings, and spare him that dread ordeal again?
You are silent. Do you remember the story of the
father and his son suspended by a single rope over
the side of a precipice, when the former felt that
the rope must break with their combined weight, and
so, with a parting admonition to his child to hold
on, threw up his arms, and fell, rather than risk
a dearer life? What! silent again? Would not a
prisoner in the hands of the Red Indians, who knew
that torture was his certain doom, be justified in anticipating 
his death? Was not the deed of Guyon,
the physician of Marseilles, who dissected the body
of a victim of the plague, an act of suicide? Was
not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

"Stop! stop!" interrupted Arthur. "These are
noble acts of heroism and self-sacrifice, with the
exception of your third instance. If one were about
to be tortured by Indians, there would still be hope
of aid. You have read your 'Last of the Mohicans'
to very little purpose, I fear. Besides, there is Captain
Mayne Reid, in whose delightful romances a rescue
always intervenes at the critical moment. Come!
come! you have delighted, but not convinced me,
with your eloquence. Again, what comparison is
there between the desperation of slighted love, and
any one of your examples, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"And do you think," returned Blanche, "that any
torture which inhuman ingenuity could devise, could

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

excel or equal the pangs I should endure were you to
slight or deceive my love?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said her husband, "you frighten
me. Suppose you were to take it in your head to become 
jealous on mistaken grounds? You might rush
headlong at a conclusion and take poison, you know,
and find out your error too late."</p>

<p>"I should at least die comparatively happy if I
discovered myself mistaken," rejoined Blanche.</p>

<p>"You really alarm me with these ideas of yours,"
said Aubrey; but, in truth, he did not look half so
much alarmed as flattered by these expressions of his
wife's love.</p>

<p>Alas! what a dangerous thing it is to entertain or
to inspire such love, i.e., if there is a chance of the
beloved object proving unworthy, or of becoming unworthy 
of it oneself. And who can say what changes
may occur in human life, whose very essence is
change? Of one thing we are certain, which is this,
that it is better for both man and woman to conceal
rather than display the full extent of passionate
attachment, the hidden fountain in the inner court of
the temple of their love. And this especially holds
good with the latter. The two greatest safeguards to
a man's love&mdash;next to his children, if he have any&mdash;are 
vanity and the excitement of doubt. A man
is vain of the possession of a beautiful woman, to
whom others pay court. We are also apt to cherish
most enduringly that, of the possession of which we
do not feel quite assured, and which we feel that there
is a possibility we may some day lose, if we cease to
bestow on it the utmost care and attention. It is

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

actually true that, in cases of early disappointed love,
there have been instances of greater and more continuous 
devotion to the shadow, than the substance;
to the joyless memory, than the fruition of love.
There are exceptions, of course, to this worldly theory;
and as some, we fear, will term it, this libertine rule.
But how rare is the union of two matched together in
equal wealth of love, lasting and perennial; how
seldom is it, either where fortunes are suitable or not,
that a pair are joined together in that which is, then
indeed, "holy" matrimony, whose hearts are set,</p>

<p class="small">Like watches timed for some long perilous trip;<br/>

Their voyage, life.</p>

<p>When such matches are made on earth and in heaven,
one might well let loose the reins of poetic imagination, 
and believe that the angel c&eacute;libataires applaud,
if they do not envy, such mortal bliss. Our friends,
Arthur and Blanche Aubrey, have made a fair start
together. Let us wish them well; for they seem
to merit and to enjoy the fairest prospect of lasting
happiness.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey carried on their philosophical 
and domestic conversation for some time, as
on a former occasion, which we have commemorated.
It was nearly three o'clock when they retired to their
sleeping apartment. The same moon shone through
the window of their luxurious apartment, which irradiated 
the sleeping face of Kate Darrell, streaming
through the casement of her dreary little garret, and
lighting with unearthly gleam the mobile workings
of her expressive features, as she lay smiling or
frowning through her phantasmagoria of changing

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

and contradictory dreams. Strange, that Aubrey
should on that very occasion have narrated to Blanche
his rencontres with that "lost and wretched being,"
as he termed her, as an example of the impossibility,
according to his theory, of arresting depravity in its
downward career. Strange, that Blanche&mdash;gazing
with her great liquid eyes at the moon, forming, at
that moment, as it were, the apex of a triangle of
mysterious sympathy between beings whose lives
and histories were so dissimilar, that it seems an
insult to connect them even in the melancholy comparison 
of thought&mdash;should have shivered as she did,
and turned cold.</p>

<p>"I feel," she said to her husband, "at the mention
of that frail wreck of humanity, a sort of mingled
dread and horror mingled with compassion which I
can scarcely express. Do not laugh at so odd a
fancy; but I seem to have a dim and indistinct sort of
dream-like notion, as if I myself had once wandered
in the wet and dreary streets without hope in heaven
or home on earth."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said Arthur, "you have sat up
too late, and the fire is getting low. Let me mix
you a glass of negus. You are trembling all over, I
declare."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear that superstition," inquired
Blanche, in a half-dreamy, absent manner, "about
some one walking over our graves, when a sudden
cold shiver, like this, has seized us, we know not
why?"</p>

<p>"You little goose," was Aubrey's answer, as he
tenderly folded her in his arms, and imprinted a kiss

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

on her spotless brow, "one would think you had
been gossiping with a monthly nurse," and he laughed,
but not merrily, at the conceit. "Here, dip your
rosy beak in this, little love-bird!" and he playfully
extended to her the not unwelcome glass of negus, in
which he had been dissolving the sugar with a most
determined air. "And now 'To bed, to bed, cries
sleepy head!' " Let us attend them to the door, and
lock up this pair of puppets also in our chest, not to
be drawn forth again for three years of human happiness 
and woe.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">SWELLS ON THE PROWL.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">And silly, soulless, but patrician faces<br/>

Of libertines. Ah! maddened, curst career&mdash;<br/>

Mistaking ever for the frolic Graces<br/>

The tawdry Thyads round slain Reason's bier.</p>

<p>THE moon shone on, undimmed even by a passing
cloud: she went through no ceremony, however
brief, of taking the veil that night in the blue and
frosty sky, while the stars glittered in their courses,
bright witnesses in the memory of Time.</p>

<p>On sin and sorrow, on joy and revelry, on the
unconscious sleeper and the prowling thief, on deeds
of murder and rapine, on the watcher in the fold, the
student in his lonely room, on the agonising face of
the swimmer sinking beneath the waves, on forests of
chimneys, on masts and trees, on the countless ripple
of the heaving deep, on the dead and dying in the
battle-field, whose bristling limbs and contorted
agonies looked like a rehearsal of the day of resurrection, 
when fire and dust, and the pulverised worms
of buried ages are to render up and disgorge their

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

prey, and life is to take form again; on breathing
thought and on slumber, on rock and fountain, on
mountain-top and gorge, on valley and spire, island
and desert, graveyard and hamlet, on monumental
effigies and painted semblances of mankind, that pale
moon shone alike, sometimes adding horror, and sometimes 
beauty to the scene. Look where she silvers
the old lawyer's hoary head, and touches with tender
grace the powdered features of the courtesan, till the
pallor of dissipation melts into the expression of a
saint. See how she floods yonder ruins with glory,
and fringes with soft radiance the outlines of that
desolate wreck. She is not treacherous and deceitful&mdash;accuse 
her not; for the tides of human passion
ebb and flow with wilder and more uncertain motion
than the tides of ocean charging along the shifting
sands, and rolling along the rocky channels of the
impetuous firth. She illumines with mocking ray
the desecrated memorial over the fallen soldier's
grave; but what sent him thither to die? The cruel
instincts and tyrannous ambition of his fellow-man!
She gilds the dark cypress of yon cemetery chequered
with white tombstones; but she lends no coldness to
the hearts which help to people it with the victims of
desertion and neglect. She rather fills the soul of the
stranger with tenderness and silent ruth, as he lingers
to gaze around him in the mysterious beauty of her
hallowing light.</p>

<p>Behold, where from a choice reunion of jovial
wits and <i>litterateurs</i> of the period rolls the portly
form of the great Mr. Stingray towards his chambers
in Waterloo-place! He chuckles over the recollection 

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

of the last spiteful thing he had said, to damp
the ardour of a young artist painfully struggling
with difficulties and ill-health. He nods familiarly
to the chaste planet, as if she were a familiar acquaintance 
of his; some duchess, or courtesan of
distinction, guiding her equipage in the Hyde Park
of the skies. "Ah! old girl," he mutters, kissing
the tips of his fingers, "you are shining in full force
to-night." Had the moon looked seedy and out of
luck, we verily believe that Mr. Stingray would have
cut her in his semi-drunken snobbishness, so complete 
a worshipper of prosperity and success was our
estimable friend. "I wonder," quoth he to himself,
"how the deuce that ass Aubrey contrives to spend
so much coin. One thing is certain, it can't last.
Confound the beast, I should like to see him come
down in the world, with his select parties, and that
precious sentimental piece of goods he has picked
up and married. I must find out who she was. She
had no money, that I know; for Cousens, the flashy
one of those two queer customers of solicitors of his,
told me as much. Let's see, I've dined there three
times this month. Every dinner must have cost him
thirty pounds, if it cost a penny. And he thinks he
does it very fine, <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>, forsooth. He must load
his confounded table with &eacute;pergnes full of flowers
and fruit, and sport a French chef, must he? I could
hardly see my <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> for the absurd display; and
the best thing I said all the evening was lost in
consequence, after I had led up to it so beautifully.
As for her, I should like to meet her begging in the

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

streets," This was said apropos of a poor creature
asking him for a trifle. "If you are not off," he
said, fiercely, "I'll call a policeman. Go to &mdash;&mdash;!
I am glad they invited me for Thursday," he continued; 
"because the Duke of Chalkstoneville will
be there. I like to talk to him. He's so deaf; it's
an excuse for speaking loud. Every one listens, and
some tyro says, 'That's the witty Stingray, who
writes those clever things in the "Scorpion." ' Ha!
ha! I declare I never saw a brighter moon in Italy,
Aubrey's wife looks like an Italian. Quite a classic
face, as that odious Sir Bullfrog Leapfrog said. I
wonder whether anything will come of Madeiraville's
admiration? I suppose he is not attracted much by
the husband's society. Not exactly! I should like
to know who is. 'Aubrey <i>versus</i> Madeiraville!'
what a leading article I would write for the 'Fulminator'! 
Shouldn't like the fellow to pocket the
damages though, unless he really is spoony on her,
and then it would only help him on his road to ruin.
Then there's that blackguard Luckless, he would do
better; because he couldn't pay, and both sides
would be sold." At that moment a jovial voice crying, 
"Holloa, Stingray!" caused him to turn round
and perceive the very man who furnished the immediate 
subject of his thoughts by his side.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Sir Harry! I am delighted to see you&mdash;the 
very last person in my thoughts, 'pon honour!
and Hedger Boshleigh, too, I declare! My dear boys!
this is fortunate. What say you to a brandy-and-seltzer 
at the 'ken?' "</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

<p>"All right, old boy!" was the response. "Here's
Boshleigh was just saying he should like to look in
somewhere."</p>

<p>Mr. Boshleigh was an artist in water-colours, whose
affectation was only equalled by the utter hollowness
and selfishness of his character. Under the guise
of extreme frankness, he did not trouble himself to
conceal this. He declared himself to be what he
really was; perhaps in the hope that such astonishing
candour would not be credited. He would help
himself in the most jocose manner to the larger
portion of a delicacy, or drink two glasses to his
neighbour's one, at dinner, and boast of it in the
most open and cordial manner. If you asked him to
dinner, and he did not come, he would own that he
had met some one in the interim, who had tempted
him with better fare.</p>

<p>"Like you, very much!" he would say, with a
coarse laugh; "but couldn't resist turtle, you know.
Don't get turtle every day&mdash;dine with you to-morrow,
old fellow!"</p>

<p>He would tell you how he cut an old friend, because 
he was going down in the world. "Can't afford
to know a man who might want to borrow a 'fiver'&mdash;shouldn't 
like to refuse a friend a 'fiver,' and you
see, I never have one to spare. Wish I had&mdash;wouldn't 
be such a fool as to lend 'em, though. What
do you think happened to me last Christmas Day?" he
was once heard to say, "Dined with family, and all
that&mdash;carved the turkey&mdash;lots of nephews and nieces&mdash;helped 
them all, and slipped a nice lot of tit-bits
on one side of dish under the lee of turkey. Saw

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

youngest nephew eating as if he would choke himself. 
The confounded young rascal timed it exactly
to the moment when I had finished helping all
round, and then shoved in his plate for more&mdash;was
going to cut him a drumstick. 'Thank ye, uncle,'
said the young viper; 'I'll just take those brown bits
on the other side!' Should like to have carved him
for a select party of New Zealanders. Never wished
so much to be rich, that I might have cut him out of
my will, and let his parents know it." Amongst other
things, Boshleigh had been studying "art" at Florence,
where he made Stingray's acquaintance. They knew,
hated, and respected each other. Boshleigh spoke
of Stingray in a gushing manner, and called him
"that dear creature, all heart, sir!" "Qual cuore!"
he would say; for, amongst other things, Boshleigh
would bore you with his execrable Italian, spoken in
the loudest tone. Stingray was generally said to talk
a great deal from his heart. But then, what a heart
it was to talk from. Boshleigh was always speaking
of "La bella Firenze," and "Roba di Roma," and
"Albano," and "Trasteverini," and "una bellissima
ragazza," or "una donna graziosa, bell' assai!" he
would drawl out. And this sort of thing imposed
upon some persons, as every piece of pachydermatous
impertinence of self-assertion does, more or less.
Stingray knew and appreciated his man, but never
said anything spiteful of Boshleigh, whose good word,
perhaps, he valued; for the fellow had a dry, caustic
touch of ironical humour about him, that sometimes
told, especially when he was backbiting any one to
whom he owed an obligation, and these were not few.

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

"I never did him any kindness," said an eminent
judge once in our hearing, of some one who had
said an ill-natured thing of him; "why should he
hate me?"</p>

<p>The trio went on conversing towards the Haymarket. 
On the way Stingray tried to draw out
Sir Harry Luckless about Mrs. Aubrey; but to the
surprise of that sapient man of the world, with very
little success, or, rather, with marked failure. In
fact, Luckless talked much more like a gentleman
than is common among the well-dressed libertines of
the present cynical and unchivalrous period.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is. Stingray," said the fast
young baronet, who was by no means usually fastidious 
in his conversation, "she's an angel, by &mdash;&mdash;,
and I don't care to hear you talk of her in that sort
of way; and what's more, I won't stand it from any
man, and now you know."</p>

<p>So saying, he withdrew his arm from that of the
wit, who had some difficulty in pacifying him.</p>

<p>"Why, Luckless, what on earth has come over
you?" inquired Stingray, somewhat disconcerted.
"You're not the sort of fellow to take these things in
earnest. I only said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what you said," retorted Sir Harry;
"I don't care to hear even her name mentioned in
this atmosphere. She's too good for any of us to
know or talk about."</p>

<p>"E superb' assai!" drawled out Boshleigh, "non
ho mai veduto una&mdash;una&mdash;&mdash;" Here he stuck, his
Italian vocabulary being at fault.</p>

<p>"Come, come," quoth Stingray; "since it is such

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

an earnest case with Luckless, we had better take
care, and so had Aubrey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" interrupted the incorrigible Boshleigh; 
"il marito, hay? yaas, he had better look
out, and study the horn-book of matrimony. Luckless 
is a dangerous admirer. But you've no chance
against Chalkstoneville. A duke, you know, caro
mio! even with the gout, and deaf as a post&mdash;he
don't find others deaf&mdash;it is long odds, even against
Sir Harry Luckless. Fancy the old sinner making
love, saying something very insinuating, and putting
up his ear-trumpet for the blushing response. How I
should like to drop the tea-caddy on his toes, or a
marble paper-weight, or any other little trifle of the
kind."</p>

<p>"His grace," said Stingray, "always reminds
me of the beadle of Burlington Arcade, especially
on a drawing-room day, except at one particular
time."</p>

<p>"When may that be?" asked Boshleigh.</p>

<p>"When I pass by the Arcade," returned Stingray,
"and then the beadle reminds me of him."</p>

<p>"Arcades ambo," said Boshleigh; "but the beadle
has the advantage in one thing. He is not deaf like
the other shepherd."</p>

<p>"No," replied Stingray, "or else he would lose
his situation, whereas the duke would continue to
hold his, were he blind and dumb into the bargain.
The beadle, too, holds himself more erect; and is
altogether a superior specimen of humanity, and his
moral character is unimpeachable, or how could he
be respected as a beadle? Besides which, he is the

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

son of his parents, or at least reputed so to be. But
the duke is the duke with fifty thousand pounds
a-year, after all, and therefore is fifty thousand times
a better man, without counting the title."</p>

<p>The speaker would have fawned, lied, wriggled
like a worm or an adder, and sacrificed his greatest
benefactor without remorse, to have gained the
entr&eacute;e of Chalkstoneville House, and to have been
invited to join the duke's country circle; but, nevertheless, 
he was truly animated by the contempt which
he expressed. Sir Harry, when the talk about the
duke had dropped, took the opportunity of informing
both of his companions that the conversation was
very displeasing to him, involving, as it did, the name
of a lady for whom he cherished the most profound
admiration.</p>

<p>"I'm with you for the 'ken,' " he said, "or anywhere 
else you like; but if I hear the name of Mrs.
Aubrey even alluded to again, I shall go that instant.
Nay more, I shall consider it a personal offence. It
is very seldom that I am in earnest about anything;
but I am this time, and I must say I think it will
be deuced uncivil of you to annoy me, when you see
I don't like it. There are plenty of women to talk
about I am sure, without dragging in her name."</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at the door of the
"ken," where Sir Harry knocked with his stick; and
the porter, after honouring the trio with a stare, the
result of which seemed to be satisfactory to his mind,
said, "I hope I see you well, gents," and opened the
door with a degree of promptitude and decision,

<!-- vol 1 page 321 -->

not to say violence, which was highly complimentary
to the party.</p>

<p>"Full to-night?" inquired Stingray.</p>

<p>"Stunning!" was the emphatic answer, with which
agreeable announcement we will, if our readers allow
us, leave these three ornaments of polite and moral
life to enjoy, as they may, the intellectual pleasures
of the "ken."</p>

<p class="small">THE GREAT BINSBY.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">So great, so soft, so corpulent, so good,<br/>

A very prince of butlers, Spoongrand stood;<br/>

Most butler-like of princes had he been,<br/>

Should we in truth a nobler man have seen;<br/>

Though on our knees we had adored his "place,"<br/>

His "stars," his "garter," and his full fat face?<br/>

No! had our Spoongrand grandest spoon been born,<br/>

Arch table-spoon of gold, not servile horn,<br/>

He still had been himself&mdash;the good and great&mdash;<br/>

His own bland wisdom murmurs&mdash;"Sich is fate!"</p>

<p>MR. BINSBY, P. G. M. of the United Butlers'
Branch of the Grand Metropolitan Aid Society for
the benefit of the retired veterans of the three
"Services," whose seal of office bore a Tir-bouchon
"argent," and three folded Doyleys "or" upon a
sable Hammercloth, with the motto, "Pro bono
publico servimus," which some low and evil-minded
persons declared meant that the chief aim and ambition 
of the members of the confraternity was to
obtain some time or other the goodwill of a public-house&mdash;Mr. 
Binsby, the great, bland, and dignified
ruler of the house of Aubrey, which he honoured by
his (ad) ministration, sat in state in his well-worn

<!-- vol 1 page 323 -->

arm-chair, at the head of the supper-table of the
male and female functionaries of the various departments 
of domestic economy in that establishment.</p>

<p>It was the same night on which we have introduced
our readers to the parlour of the worthy Mr. Pettingall 
in Thames-street, the villa of the benevolent
Grinderby in the Grove of the Evangelist, the Circean
orgies of the Escurial, the dingy attic of Kate Darrell
in Achilles'-buildings, the drawing-room t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
of Arthur Aubrey and his enchanting wife, and
lastly the Corinthian promenade of Mr. Stingray and
his friends in the vicinity of the Haymarket.</p>

<p>Mr. Binsby may be described as of genus homo,
species cork-drawer, ordo magnificent. He was a
wonderful specimen of his class. His stature was
lofty, his chin double, his whiskers <i>cotelettes de mouton</i>
in style and cut, his chest expansive, <i>&agrave; la</i> pouter
pigeon, his flesh soft, his voice sonorous, and his
manner calm and impressive. His appearance, on
taking the air when the hall-door was open, was so
extremely awe-inspiring, that his very look has been
known to scare away mischievous urchins, and to
cause a showman who had commenced the usual
preliminaries of that popular entertainment "Punch,"
suddenly to shoulder his peripatetic theatre, and like
Longfellow's Arabs, with their folded tents, to</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">As silently steal away.</p>

</div>

<p>He once frightened a sensitive little washerwoman's
girl, who mistook the house, and whose evil fate
prompted her to ring the visitors' bell, to such an
extent, that she went home and was subject to epileptic

<!-- vol 1 page 324 -->

fits, until she attained the age of sixteen. Not that
there was anything savage or ogre-like about Mr.
Binsby&mdash;far from it; but there was something awful
in the concentration of so much conscious importance
in so fine a man. Imagine a whole civic Corporation
looking out of one pair of eyes from an aristocratic
doorstep, and you have some notion of the mesmeric
influence exercised by such a personage over the
poor and timid. But Mr. Binsby would have been
imposing in any sphere of life! What a pity, for
the honour of England, that he was not Lord Mayor
of London, in some year of particular fraternisation
with our Gallic neighbours. What an effect he would
have created in Belgium! As it is, we are constrained
to send over some little civic Mouldy, Wart, or Feeble,
some absolutely thin and absurdly insignificant being,
as the representative of that Gogmagogic Majesty,
which is supposed to lock the gates of Temple Bar,
and which once struck Wat Tyler to the ground. This
had led to awkward and perplexing mistakes. On
one occasion the quaint, old, gilded Mansion House
post-boy, or Guildhall jockey, was seized, <i>nolens
volens</i>, just as he was about to seek refreshment
amongst his compeers, and borne in triumph by a
gesticulating crowd of Mossoos to the chair of honour
at the royal f&ecirc;te. Could this have happened, Binsbio
duce&mdash;had Binsby been mayor? Never! we say
emphatically. It could not have been!</p>

<p>True, there are beings in England, so roughly
nurtured, and so coarsely constituted, that they reverence 
nothing truly great, and worship no divinity
at all. There are boys who have no respect for

<!-- vol 1 page 325 -->

beadles; there are youths who chaff the Life Guards
in their own sentry-boxes; there are persons who
laugh aloud at the apron of a bishop, and would pick
the pocket of a Commissioner of Lieutenancy for the
City of London in full uniform, or of a peer in his
robes, if they could only get at it. And to crown
all, there are godless and profane wretches who would
remain unawed even by the Binsbian aspect in its
severest phase. There was a Hansom cabman, who
on departing from the door, after depositing a guest,
facetiously asked that great man, if he didn't feel
weak about the knees with supporting so much
dignity. There was a newspaper boy, who having
been reading in the "Family Herald" an account of
the habits of the cetaceous tribe, stood grinning at a
safe distance, and propounded the inquiry to Binsby
himself, whether he often came up to the surface to
blow off his steam! There was a young vagabond,
who belonged to a neighbouring dispensary, who
asked him in allusion to his complexion, and a certain
puffiness of flesh which certainly did characterise
him (as it latterly did the great Napoleon), if he
wasn't weaned upon muffins; and finished by a positive 
assertion that he was the original fat boy in
"Pickwick," grown to manhood since that inimitable
publication first came out.</p>

<p>On these&mdash;as we are glad to record they were&mdash;rare 
and exceptional occasions, Binsby would slam the
door with a solemn severity which never degenerated
into violence, and simply withdraw himself from the
vulgar gaze. It was like the august retirement of
the hippopotamus in the Zoological Gardens to his

<!-- vol 1 page 326 -->

inner apartment, when a bushel of shelled marrowfats
wouldn't tempt him forth to take a plunge for the
gratification of the plebeian throng. Plebeian, did
we say? The Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief 
of the British Army, might pine for that sullen
and ponderous presence, in vain. On the occasion to
which we have just ventured an allusion, Binsby felt
that had he been a mere Piccadilly beadle, he might
have sought vengeance; but that as a Belgravian
butler, he could only pity and despise such ignorance.
Mr. Binsby, as a rule, never hurried himself. Scurrying 
and bustling were the chief of all things in the
world which he disliked. Only once was he known
to manifest some symptoms of haste, and that was to
escape from a house where the people had evinced
decidedly low habits; in fact, where the mistress had
actually upon one occasion entered the kitchen unannounced, 
and the master forgot himself so far as to
keep duplicate keys of the cellar. "I felt myself quite
out of my spear," he remarked&mdash;a favourite mode
of expression of his&mdash;"and I acted according to the
emergency of the situation." Mr. Binsby's favourite
study was heraldry. Not that he read much, considering 
as he did such an occupation, with the exception 
of glancing over the "Morning Post" every
morning, rather derogatory to his dignity than otherwise. 
He had no respect for literature, as a profession. 
"It isn't that authors don't make much
money," he said; "officers in the army is seldom
rich, unless they turn their uniform to a good account
in the way of marriage, which I have known some
in another branch of the Service do, especially when

<!-- vol 1 page 327 -->

their understandings was good" (and here the great
man would scan his own legs with complacency);
"but the truth is, that literary habits is so doosidly
low. I knew an unfortunate party as once moved in
a very high spear, in fact he was attached to royalty,
until he took to dissipation and lost himself, pore
fellow! He came at last to our society for aid, after
a parrylitic attack, and he told me confidentially, that
he had on one occasion actually come down so low
as to do duty at an authors' club. Reduced as his
circumstances were, even he couldn't stand that long.
They smoked clay pipes all day long, which is nothing," 
added Mr. Binsby, reflectively, "when the
tobakker's tolerable and at prepper times. I sometimes 
do such a thing myself. Even the clergy
don't always object to their churchwardens" (and at
this feeble joke he indulged in a genteel laugh). "But
these literary fellers were by no means pertickler as
to what they smoked, according to my friend; and
was fond of rattling coppers in their pockets, and
there was not one of them that put on a clean shirt a
day, and didn't ink the table-cloth, which no gentleman 
could endure. They were mostly all of them
Radicals, too, he said, and their conversation was
blaspheymious in the heggstream. Now, if I have a
weakness" (and here Mr. Binsby would smile, as if
the notion of <i>his</i> having a weakness were something
which the world would hardly admit, even at his own
suggestion) "it is for clean linen, and if I've a respect, 
it's for the distinctiuns of Society." These were
doubtless some of the reasons for which he did not
immerse himself deeply and devotedly in the study

<!-- vol 1 page 328 -->

and science of the "belles lettres." Possibly, too, in
early life, his continual attendance on the bell had
interfered with his application to letters. His knowledge 
of heraldry was therefore somewhat confined
and peculiar. Still he had an extensive knowledge
of the crests and devices of various families. Panels
of carriages, and the hatchments of deceased noblemen, 
furnished him with constant objects of contemplation 
and means of enjoyable acquirement. And
considering that the family of Binsby was not ancient
in a genealogical point of view, whatever might be
said to the contrary, and although it was true in the
vulgar and facetious view of a Tennyson, that he
might be descended from the "grand old gardener,"
like the rest of mankind; yet, as he actually was the
eldest son of a market-gardener at Peckham, i.e., if
his mother did not also deal in "slips," he could
scarcely lay claim to an illustrious genealogical tree,
or date back his own origin further at least than the
first syllable of the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>Probably, had Mr. Binsby's feelings been consulted
in relation to science, he would have declared in
favour of the congenital theory of species, which is so
destructive of the poetical climax of the bard, to
which we have referred above. No doubt maternal
Binsbian ancestors existed at a very early period,
which we are inclined to believe, from a very antique
coprolite jaw-bone of an old woman having been
found on the family estate of an Irish branch of the
"butlers," supposed to have been of cannibal propensities, 
whose head had evidently been snapped off, and
swallowed by one of the antediluvian monsters with

<!-- vol 1 page 329 -->

which we are so familiar in the pleasure-grounds of
the Crystal Palace, as there was no other portion of
the skeleton found near. The deinotherium had evidently 
made no bones of dining on that progenitress
of the Binsby race. Was there not also a portion of
the skull of a female found in a Roman kitchen-midden 
in London Wall, which was palpably that of
a cook of the period, whenever that might be, from
the culinary fragments which surrounded it, together
with an immense quantity of the reliqui&aelig; of the exact
varieties of shell-fish to which all the members of the
Binsby family are so partial at the present day?
Much, it is true, might be advanced by the exponents
of an antagonistic theory. But as anthropology is
more capable of elucidation, or an opposite process,
by separate and successive controversial essays, than
by debate or discussion, admitting of answer or
refutation on the spot, we invite Professors Huxley
and Busk to answer us through the medium, if they
please, either of a volume published at their own expense, 
or of the "Anthropological Review." Only
we do not pledge ourselves to read their speculations,
as we consider that the jaw-bones of old women
might be allowed to remain silent, when they have
got below, say, a tertiary crust of that crustiest of old
ladies, mother Earth. To recur to our modern Binsby,
his parents' real name, it should be mentioned in the
course of truth and antiquarian research, was Bugsby,
but in whatever respect that might have been held in
a mariner's or bargeman's eyes, he felt with reason
that such a patronymic was hardly admissible in the
"Service" to which he had the honour to belong.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 330 -->

<p>There was great merit, therefore, because great
unselfishness in Binsby's administration and study of
heraldic lore. It was curious how he quartered himself, 
as it were, on the shields of the great families
with whom he happened to be successively identified
in pursuing the duties of his profession. On these
occasions, when speaking of their heraldic pretensions, 
he would say: "We bear a cock rampant on a
chevron gules," or "Our motter is 'Nomen et numen,'
though what new men has to do with it I must confess 
I don't exactly see." Or "Our fammerly came
in with the Conqueror." Or "This house is of Scotch
extraction. We are lineally descended from the
Haggis of Haggis, twice hintermarried with the well-known 
barrownites of Brose." There was something
sublime in this elevation to heraldic blazonry and
genealogical lore on the part of Binsby, when we
consider that he was liable at any time to be compelled 
to provide himself with a new coat-of-arms at
a month's warning. It was touching, when one
considered it in all its full-flavoured simplicity and
earnest single-mindedness of credulous infatuation.
Was it altogether an infatuation? We will not speak
of the peculiar genealogical influence occasionally
exercised by servitors of the Binsbian mould and
stamp in ancient families, in preserving them from extinction, 
or, what is worse, utter degeneration of body
and mind. The stalwart heir of more than one noble
house has resembled a stout footman, rather than his
noble but effeminate papa. The contemplation and
company of robust personages has a physiological
as well as moral bearing, highly suggestive it may

<!-- vol 1 page 331 -->

be, but no less practical in its consequences and effect.
But this is a matter for metaphysical speculation,
rather than the pages of a work like this. To pursue,
however, another train of thought, must we not admit
that the whole science and detail of heraldry depends
very much upon faith&mdash;upon the belief that you had
a great-grandfather, that your great-great-grandmother 
was chaste, or that she wasn't somebody else?
Would there ever have been a pedigree sought
out and published of the Empress of the French,
which pedigree includes in her ancestry Bruce and
Wallace, if we mistake not, and nearly every Scottish
notability, save Macbeth and the Laird of Cockpen&mdash;would, 
we say, this pedigree ever have existed&mdash;if the
ancestors did&mdash;had not Napoleon III. fallen in love
with a certain charming young lady of mingled
Spanish and Scottish descent? Of course we do not
include the utter and acknowledged fictitious absurdity, 
so much fostered by the modern system of
crested envelopes and stamps, and emblazoned notepaper. 
The way in which some persons who cannot
even boast of a father, but are ashamed to own the
honest man, i.e., if he were honest, which they are
not, go into this sort of thing, only stationers and
engravers, and that erudite body, the Herald's College,
can tell. These are the folks who connect their own
two names, or two last names, if they have more, or
their own and wife's surname, with a hyphen, as
Smyth-Wilkins, or Clark-Rogers. If you look for
Wilkins in the "Court Guide"&mdash;he was only promoted
to the Commercial Directory a few years ago&mdash;you
either don't find him, or it says, "See Smyth-Wilkins." 

<!-- vol 1 page 332 -->

His daughter Sarah, formerly "our Sally,"
drops her final h, and comes out as Sara. "Chi Sarah
Sara!" This is only fair, as her father always supplies
an unnecessary h at the beginning; of a great many
words. It is a habit he acquired at Court&mdash;a court in
Whitechapel; and no court in Europe can guide him
out of it. He may be more fortunate in the next
world, for he does already drop it both in heaven and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>To revert to the real humbug, the true genuine
absurdity. Was not Binsby&mdash;if we could imagine
him in <i>cuerpo</i>, with his mutton-chop whiskers developed 
into the full bushy luxuriance of a beard&mdash;as
proper a man as was ever depicted in the form of a
supporter of the most gorgeous emblazonment? Was
there not lately a picture in the South Kensington
Portrait Gallery, representing a worthy of the Elizabethan 
era, the exact similitude of <i>the</i> Binsby, at
present connected with the Aubrey family? There
was, to the very trick of the judicial beetling eyebrows, 
and the exact over-lapping droop of his
majestic jowl. We ourselves believe that the world
has never been without a Binsby, since the time of
ancient Babylon the Great, and probably for ages
before that comparatively recent period in the history
of mankind. We can imagine a Binsby, chief-butler
to Pharaoh, telling his dream to Joseph, the boy in
buttons of that Semitic establishment, surrounded by
the culinary hieroglyphics of an Egyptian servants'
hall. The only inconsistency of our friend lay in
the transfer of the Binsbian interest from one family
to another, together with his mercenary allegiance.

<!-- vol 1 page 333 -->

But in this he only followed the example of the great
families from whom he, or any one else, might happen 
to claim descent.</p>

<p>After all, it was but a sort of new quartering
on his shield; his pantry displayed a collection of all
the coats-of-arms he had ever borne, or helped to
bear, in the vicissitudes of the noble families he had
known. Such a man, sober, unmarried, Protestant,
and chaste&mdash;severe, yet bland; proud, but courted;
stately, and affable; weighing sixteen stone seven,
yet treading softly in his well-polished pumps&mdash;was
the august autocrat, reminding one of Vespasian
rather than Nero, of Trajan rather than Caligula, of
Alexander Comnenus rather than Commodus, who
ruled over the destinies of the Lower Empire of
No. &mdash;, Queen's-square, at the exact period of which
we speak.</p>

<p>This great man, then, was sitting in his arm-chair
awaiting supper on the evening which we have sought
to immortalise, when the following conversation took
place. But as Binsby deserves a whole chapter, ay,
though it were of the most high and puissant Order
of the Garter, to himself, we will leave him thus
photographed in the memory of our readers, a "thing
of beauty," and "a joy for ever," and proceed in our
next chapter to display him mingled and confused
with the lesser personages who derived second-hand
lustre and dignity from his magnificent presence.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">THE SECOND SALLE-A-MANGER OF THE FAMILLE
AUBREY.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">When I thinks of the traps as I've driven, the bar-parlours as I've
set in, the wager-dinners as I've eat, and the glasses round as I've had
a share in, I says&mdash;"What is life?"&mdash;<i>After-midnight Soliloquy of a
Commercial Traveller</i>.</p>

<p>"I WONDER," quoth Mrs. Susan, Blanche Aubrey's
maid, to Mr. Tops, Arthur Aubrey's groom, as they
sat conversing in the servants' hall, on the memorable
night when the events took place which we have
narrated in the preceding chapters&mdash;"I wonder that
missus and master don't leave this racketing London
to the fine folks that is fit to live in it, and take some
delightful place in the country. I am sure if I was
them, I wouldn't stay in town a day longer, and
missus is so fond of flowers."</p>

<p>"Did you hever 'appen to know a swell as did
hexackly what he liked, or what he was cut out
special for by Natur, Susan?" observed Mr. Tops.</p>

<p>After saying this much he paused for a reply; and
then quaffed a draught of his supper beer in a manner
that would have created envy in a blas&eacute; aristocrat
hesitating between champagne-cup, or any other expensive 

<!-- vol 1 page 335 -->

compound, languidly unable to excite his too
frequently indulged and consequently vitiated taste.</p>

<p>Mr. Tops paused for a reply, but getting none,
continued his observations.</p>

<p>"Cos if you did, I never did, and that's hall
about it."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Tops," said the lady's lady at last,
"I can't say that such an idea did ever strike me. I
should think that 'swells,' as you call them, are just
the people who did follow their own fancies."</p>

<p>"It's the loikes of we," observed Jane, the housemaid, 
a fine buxom Staffordshire girl, with hair of
the hue which has since become so fashionable, "as
is obligated, in a manner of speaking, to do as we
oughtner to be obligated no how. Look how sarvints 
is worrited. If I wanted to go furren now, do
you suppose I'd get a chance? In course I don't
want to do no such a thing. It don't seem much like
England, as it is, in a place where a French man-cook 
is kep."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say," remarked Susan, "that
Monseer Isidore keeps himself very much to himself,
and I don't see that we have any call to complain of
his company."</p>

<p>Miss Jane tossed her head, and made a remark to
the effect that, for her part, she thought the mounseer
rather resembled a murderer at Madame Tussaud's Exhibition 
than a person who ought to cook victuals for
an English family. The fact is, that poor M. Isidore
had been rather captivated by the rustic fair one, who
expressed her scorn of her admirer, like a true coquette
of her class and condition.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 336 -->

<p>The great Binsby had been revolving the proposition 
of Tops, and was so absorbed by it as to pay no
attention to the remarks of the women. At length
the oracle spoke; and the whole kitchen, animate
and inanimate, from the dish-cover laid down by
Betty, the scullery-maid, to the cat which ceased to
pass her paw over her ears, and sat solemnly blinking
round, from page to spectacled housekeeper, from the
elegant Susan to the flippant Tops, seemed suddenly
impressed with awe, and to come as it were to attention.</p>

<p>"There's a deal in what Mr. Tops has observed,"
said the great man, at length. "I've been a many
years in the 'Service,' and I've seen, I may say, a
sight of tip-top company in my time, and what's the
conclusion I've arrived at?" (Pause.) "The conclusion 
is, that masters is masters of everything, except
their own wishes, and their own affairs, generally,
including in a meejority of cases their missuses; and
that servants is servants, and <i>as</i> such is called upon
to act according. Now I never did hardly know a
gentleman as did act according. If he's rich, he
wants to be richer; if he's in society he wants to
better that society; he's always trying to do something 
beyond himself like, and a imitating his neighbours 
in a manner that is very unbecoming. If <i>he</i>
don't think it, his wife says, 'My dear, the Smythes
gave clear turtle as well as thick, last week at that
dinner of theirs, and we only had thick; or they had
four extra waiters, and we only had three,' and so
she puts him on to outdo the Smythes. Of course, I'm
talking of them as spend their fortunes, and not of

<!-- vol 1 page 337 -->

the mean-sperritted creatures as spend no fortune at
all, and saves all their money for somebody who
wishes 'em dead, and don't thank 'em even for dying,
when they've got it. That's not according to any
sort of living. They are to be pitied, they are. But
as for saying that any gentlefolks live as they like, or
where they like, or how they like, of course I know
better."</p>

<p>"O cri! Muster Binsby," interrupted the boy in
buttons, "wouldn't I like to be a gentleman, and
wouldn't I jest 'ave a rare blow out whenever I felt
peckish, and go reg'lar to the theayter."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you young himp of hevil,"
was the majestic man's reply. It must be reluctantly
admitted that even Binsby himself, when exasperated,
aspirated his h's, and was apt to forget his Lindley
Murray. "A gentleman," resumed Mr. Binsby,
"may say, 'next year I'll do so and so,' but does he
do it? Of course he don't, and if he tried ever so,
his friends and relations wouldn't let him. Some
has daughters to be married, and some has sons to
start in life, and all is slaves to Society, and fashion,
and circumstances, and what they call their circle of
acquaintance and the world. I tell you their lives is
all a imposition, from family prayers before breakfast, 
to counting the bottles of wine that's been drunk
after the last guest has gone, and a blessing with him,
which is sure to be some very shy gent who's been
standing in doorways and corners all the evening,
and has warmed up unpleasantly by drinking half
tumblers of wine after supper."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Binsby," cut in Tops, "I'm sure

<!-- vol 1 page 338 -->

you can't accuse our guv'nor of that kind of game.
He don't count his bottles. He's the wrong sort to
go for to do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Nor I didn't want to, young man," replied the
butler, whose words gurgled with solemnity and
slowness, like the contents of a thick bottle of port.
"I was illustrating life in its various faces, and I was
jest a going to observe, when you whipt up my plate,
as I may say, before I'd done, which is not the practice 
in the spear I'm accustomed to, that our young
people behave themselves, according, as much as any
that ever I served with, and I would give them an
excellent character to any gentleman of my acquaintance. 
Not wishing to detract from their merits, I
must say that Arthur Aubrey, Esquire, is not rich
enough, in my opinion, to venture on mean and dishonourable 
actions. It's only a nobleman or a banker
who can afford to count the wax candle-ends after
an out-and-out fashionable cram. I've known a
bishop do it; but then they can do anything short of
cold meat on Sundays. But if you mean to say,
any of you, that our young folks up-stairs follow
their own inclinations, and do what they feel inclined
to do, I dissent entirely from your preposition, and
consider your views unphilosophic and shaller."</p>

<p>"It's as true as gospel," eagerly remarked the
housemaid Jane; "I believe, if it wasn't for what
other folks say, missus would be as nateral as one of
we. As it is, she can't go outside the door without
a lot of preparation and rubbish, and Mr. William
here to follow after her, as stately as a funeral, or
else the carridge. She isn't half so gay and lightsome, 

<!-- vol 1 page 339 -->

I've heerd Susan here say, as she was before
marriage; for all she was a governess, and loves our
young master."</p>

<p>The butler frowned at this allusion. It was clear
that he didn't like any allusion to a fact so detrimental 
to the dignity of one of the "young people's"
antecedents.</p>

<p>"When I was used to take the cheer in the hall of the
Reform Club," he said, "I'd a deal of time for reflection 
on the life of the harristocrisy and upper classes.
And the conclusion I arrived at is, that they've a deal
more care and a good deal less pleasure, than some
that occupies a different spear altogether. I allude
particularly to gentlemen of my own perfession. We
have, I may say, a wider choice of life and observation. 
Of course, I speak of gents only that is settled
and married. There isn't a worse set of slaves in
Europe, or Ameriky, for that matter, than people
moving in Society. From morning to night, and
abed for all I know, they're always thinking what
some one else will say about them. If a man daren't
eat peas with a knife, or drink beer with his dinner,
or enjoy an apple on his own doorstep, that is, if he is
minded to, is that liberty? If he's got a dozen horses
in the stable, can he ride any one of them he likes?"
A shake of the head from Tops. "Isn't he obliged
to be sweltering in London in the hottest month of
the year, or to close his windows and his shutters if
he don't leave town? Mustn't he dress for dinner,
whether he likes it or not, and does he get the best
of what's to eat and drink in his own house?"
Approval all round. "And mustn't both he and his

<!-- vol 1 page 340 -->

wife receive visitors, and be civil to them, when
they'd as leave take as much physic, or poison, for
the matter of that? What folks don't like&mdash;if they're
ever so fashionable&mdash;they're always ruining themselves 
to purchase, and what they'd like to have,
they never can somehow by any means afford. All
they can afford is show and pretence, and such like.
But if they'd the heart to do good, and I believe a
many has, only it's invisible, and we can't see it, are
they ever in a position to do it? They've got to give
lots of money in charities, as isn't charity at all, to
my mind; but if the wife says to the husband, 'My
dear, there's our poor cousin Robert starving for
want of bread,' what's the answer? 'We must look
at home, my dear. I can assure you, we're living
above our means.' And so they all are; except, as
I said, the poor pitiful creatures that don't live at
all. And that's the chief secret of the unhappiness
which I feel myself called upon to testimonialise to
as a veteran in the Service."</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this speech, Mr. Binsby
looked around for approval, and applied himself assiduously 
to the leg of a pheasant.</p>

<p>"It's all very true, sir, doubtless, what you say,"
said the footman, a nice quiet young man, who had
just joined, as Mr. Binsby would have called it, and
who had a profound respect for his senior officer and
commandant, "and I don't mean for a moment to
contradict it; but I should like to try a little of their
unhappiness up-stairs, that's what I should. If I
was a gentleman, missus is just the sort I should like
to be unhappy with."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 341 -->

<p>"If you was one of them," replied Mr. Binsby,
with patronising grandeur, "perhaps you'd do as
they does. As it is, young man, you only expose
your ignorance." Saying which he relapsed into the
requisite amount of abstraction required by his agreeable 
occupation.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "I'm free to confess that it
hoften licks me to know what the nobs is a drivin' at.
As for master, he don't take 'arf so kind to the stables,
since he's been mixed hup with all these swells. Now
and agen he do come to smoke his weed of a morning,
but what is it? Yesterday he says, 'Tops,' says he,
'the dook says that the little bay 'oss ain't a good
match for the t'other. I think I must get a customer
for him, Tops.' 'Well,' says I, 'sir, there ain't no
dook in Hingland as can find a better-matched pair
than them two 'osses. Pr'aps he's arter him hisself.' 
And that's what, in my opinion, he was
arter."</p>

<p>"And that's not all he's after in this establishment," 
observed Mr. Binsby. "He ought to be
ashamed of himself, that's what he ought to be. I
should like to tell him a little of my opinion of him.
I'll warrant he should hear it for all his deafness."</p>

<p>"Then, there's Sir 'Arry Luckless, he didn't like
the colour of our pheayton," continued Tops, "and
master's a goin' to have it new painted. I'd see
him blowed first, that's what I would. It's hall for
want o' summit to say, for I heerd him hadmiring of
it to missus like winking. I'd paint him."</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Susan, "that Sir Harry is a
very nice, civil-spoken gentleman. It was only last

<!-- vol 1 page 342 -->

Tuesday he gave me half a sovereign, and such a
nice&mdash;&mdash;" Here she paused and looked down.</p>

<p>"Nice <i>what?</i>" cried Tops. "I thought you was
a different sorted one."</p>

<p>"Such a nice smile, to be sure," continued Susan;
"and I'll just trouble you, Mr. Tops, not to insult
me with any of your imperence, if you please. What
were you pleased to think he should give me? I'd
advise you to keep your insinuations to the stable,
and not to trouble me with them. I wish you good
evening. I'm going up to missus. I don't allow no
one to insult me, groom nor barrynet." And, so
saying, she swept out of the room.</p>

<p>"There now, you've been and done it," said the
housemaid.</p>

<p>"I've known a man's head punched for insulting
a respectable young woman like that," quoth the
new footman, between whom and the illiterate Tops
a tacit rivalry had already commenced as to which
should keep company with pretty Mrs. Susan.</p>

<p>"You'd better come and do it," said Tops; rising
and falling into an attitude that would have done
credit to the late Sir Thomas de Sayers of that ilk.</p>

<p>In justice to his rival, we must record that he by
no means displayed the white feather. "Oh! if
that's your game, come outside," he said, "and I'm
your man."</p>

<p>And now the Muses of History and of Song might
have to record deeds of desperate valour inspired by
Cupid and Bacchus. But a deity appeared "from
the machine" worthy of the occasion, and interfered,
in the majestic person of the portly Binsby.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 343 -->

<p>"Forbear, rash knights," he said, or rather didn't
say; but what he said was, "None of this 'ere here,
if you please. Mr. Tops, I thought you knew better.
As for you, young man, I make every allowance;
but just drop it, drop it, I say! Don't be alarmed,
ladies."</p>

<p>We are bound to observe that this last remark
was not uncalled for. The housemaid, in tears,
had thrown herself unreservedly into the arms of
Tops, and the scullery-maid was alternately blubbering 
and calling, "Perlice!" while the housekeeper,
a staid and silent dame, showed unmistakable symptoms 
of going into a fit. "Hold your tongue, you
owdacious young varmint, or I'll kick you out of this
establishment!" The boy in buttons, to whom this
was addressed, had actually ventured to utter the
astounding words of "Go it, Tops!" but shrunk
away abashed from the imposing Binsbian rebuke.</p>

<p>"Allow me to remind you, gentlemen," continued
the mighty pacificator, with a wave of his hand
which approached sublimity, without wholly abandoning 
the ridiculous, "that duels is hobsolete, and
cannot by any manner of means be permitted in the
Service. And in an establishment which I've the
honour to preside over, it can't even be heard or
thought on. Why, the only thing the people up-stairs
show sense in is in their quarrels. In the present
state of Society, there's such a sight of lying and
backbiting they couldn't afford time for duelling,
even if the newspapers would let 'em. Even the
officers in the other Services&mdash;I mean the Army and
Navy&mdash;have left it off. And what do they do? They

<!-- vol 1 page 344 -->

apologise, or bring their actions, or refer it to a Court
of Honour, which I'm willing to be on the present
occasion. Mr. Tops, you'll apologise to the lady;
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, I forget your surname, young man, but it
don't matter, you'll oblige me by offering your hand
to Mr. Tops."</p>

<p>"I've no objexion to do anythink to oblige you,
Mr. Binsby," said the good-humoured Tops; "but
you'll own when it come to talkin' of punching of
'eads, that it's about time to strip the clothing off,
and as for Ma'amselle Susan, I'd as leave starve
my 'osses as hoffend her, if I knowed it."</p>

<p>"I am sure I'm quite agreeable," said his opponent; 
"if the right thing is done by the lady. Here's
my hand, mate, and I'll stand glasses round with
pleasure."</p>

<p>"We don't stand glasses in this establishment,
sir," observed Mr. Binsby; "but you can do what
you like in regard to that preposition, when you're
next out on duty with the family equipage, or at any
house you think proper to patronise on the first convenient 
occasion."</p>

<p>In this manner was the Temple of Janus closed
by the janitor of Aubrey's household, whose next
proceeding was to produce a bottle of cordial brandy,
and administer a restorative to the fluttered housekeeper; 
after which, with many pleasant little
speeches, and on the part of the females little amiable
pretences that they never did take anything so potent,
the "petty ver" offered, in the language of the euphonious 
Mr. Binsby, was passed round.</p>

<p>"Consider," said that dignitary, "what an example 

<!-- vol 1 page 345 -->

we should set the up-stairs harristocrisy, if we
were to demean ourselves by low-lived fights and
quarrels. The weapon of the nineteenth century is
tongues; and if a adversary gets the better of you at
that, you've only got to say that you treat him with
contempt, or that he is beneath your notice."</p>

<p>"But suppose he should say the same?" inquired
Tops.</p>

<p>"Then," returned Mr. Binsby, "you may eggspress 
your regret that you live in an age which
prevents you from inflicting personal chastisement,
or you publish the correspondence, when in all
probability you're bound over. All you don't do is to
fight; for if both the principels was mad enough, the
seconds wouldn't let 'em for their own sakes. Who'd
run the chance of being hanged for another man's
quarrel, and with all them penny papers calling him
a murderer in their leading articles?"</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Jane, "from all I've heard,
there's that old Stingray would have a fine time of
it, if duelling wasn't put down."</p>

<p>"And serve him right," cried Tops. "He's as
vicious as the devil's favourite saddle-'oss, and as
mischeevyous as a monkey. Now, from what I've
heerd, not only master and missus say, but a sight
of gents' grooms as knows him, he ain't fit to live
within ten miles of any racing-stable in Hingland.
He sets more folks by the ears than enough, and he
ain't got a good word to say for nobody. And look
at the tricks of all them cures of lawyers that get
mixed hup with hevery one's bisness! D'ye mean to
tell me it wouldn't be better for So-ci-ety, or whatever

<!-- vol 1 page 346 -->

yer call it, if a few of them was shot now and then?
As for the law, if a cove prigs a hankercher off a
hedge, or out of a pocket, he's precious soon pulled
hup with a round turn; but there's no law for all
them vagabones as goes about doing nothink but
lying and doing mischief. I wish the good old times
was back agen, and I don't care who knows it."</p>

<p>"Right you air, Mr. Tops," said Mr. Binsby,
"provided they was back again, you see; but we
must act all according, that's where it is. Act according, 
and you'll be righter than ever."</p>

<p>"And this here Stingray, and the lawyers, is to
go on lying and blackguarding every one according,"
responded Tops. "Is that right? Becos if it is, I
don't know nothink, and what's more I don't want
to."</p>

<p>"As for Mr. Stingray," replied the magniloquent
butler, "it would afford me for one the sincerest
gratification, if he was never to set foot in this house
again. I know he's a low bleyguard, as you were
pleased to intimate, though Society tolerates him and
calls him a great writer. I am quite aware of what
he has been pleased to write against the Service."
Here Mr. Binsby paused, as if the subject were too
painful and disgusting. "But I can only say that
I regard him, and all like him, with the contempt he
merits, and I never pour him out a glass of sham,
but I wish it was poison. I couldn't afford to do it
myself, as it would be anything but according; but
I did say to one of the hextra waiters at our last
dinner, as had taken a drop reyther early, as those
sort of persons are reyther apt to do, that if he spilt

<!-- vol 1 page 347 -->

the gravy over him, I should consider it in the light
of an accidental occurrence. And he did spill it,"
added Mr. Binsby, slowly and reflectively, "and perhaps 
overdid it a little&mdash;I might say a great deal, and
not be far out neither. But I was as good as my word;
and that very individual waited yesterday at his
Grace the Duke of Chalkstoneville's deyjeunay, and
that individual is likewise engaged here for our
dinner to-morrow. Mr. Stingray may look carving-knives 
at him if he likes; but he can't say but what
it was an accident, after all."</p>

<p>"I honly wish I'd got the job to drive him home
of a dark night in our boldest dog-cart&mdash;the one as
goes errands and sich-like," quoth Tops. "I know
where he'd find hisself, afore we'd got 'arf way to his
lodging."</p>

<p>"I should like to damp the old wretch's bed for
him," was the housemaid's contribution.</p>

<p>"Et moi aussi," quoth M. Isidore, who had
come in towards the close of the conversation with
the whitest of white caps on his head, and a silver
bed-candlestick in his hand, upon which sparkled a
brilliant of the first water. "I would like ver' veil to
make him von leetle vol-au-vent to heemself, and I
vould give to heem vot you call feece, poisson&mdash;ha!
ha! he should say yesterday, 'I do not carry myself
too vell&mdash;I 'ave de evil at de stomach'&mdash;de peeg, de
blagueur dat he are. I should say, 'Ah! Monsieur
Steengrai, you not carry yourself vell to-morrow. Eh
bien! den you come no more to dine veet us, dere is
all.' Ah! Meess Jenny, vat vicked eyes, you make
me fear. Bon soir, mesdames! Bon repos. Monsieur

<!-- vol 1 page 348 -->

Beensby; to-morrow we shall be ver occup&eacute;s&mdash;diner
de seize couverts&mdash;sixteen is it not? This good
Monsieur Aubrey he likes mosh to give de diners
recherch&eacute;s. He sall vot you call dam de expense&mdash;is 
it not? Monsieur Steengrai, he vill come&mdash;oh,
yes! Adieu!" And the good-humoured Frenchman
went chattering out of the room, singing a vaudeville
air to himself up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Good-night, mounseer!" was the ascending
chorus; for it was impossible for the most bigoted
household to dislike Frenchy, for all the fun they
made of him behind his back. Besides, there is a
great masonry in hatred of the same object; and it
was quite evident that Mr. Stingray was by no means
popular among the D&icirc; Minores, in what Mr. Binsby
was wont to call, with a degree of phonetic propriety
which was not unappreciable, the second "sally-mangy" 
in the "petty maisong" of our young people
up-stairs.</p>

<p>"She ain't one o' my sort, nor yet no beauty, and
though I don't like a 'oss to be a white-stocking'd
one, I likes it in a gal, and this 'ere one isn't over
clean in the fetlocks one way or hanother," remarked 
Mr. Tops to himself the first time he heard
Mr. Binsby dignify the servants' hall by the above-mentioned 
name; "but I don't think a gal ought to
be called no sich a name, even if she do happen to
be a Sarah, and nothink better nor a kitchen-maid,
as cleans the pots and kettles. Somebody must do
it, that's sartain; and agen, if she's second mangy
Sally, who's the first, that's what I wants to know. If
I thought hold Binsby meant&mdash;&mdash; But no! I never

<!-- vol 1 page 349 -->

heard him say a word agen <i>her</i>, and he'd better not.
It wouldn't be good for him, vile I'm in 'the Sarvice,'
as the old himage calls it. Let's see, which on 'em
is called Sairy hup-stairs? I've got it. It's Mother
Pushfort's red-nosed filly, as married that old bald
general; she's a Sally, and an uncommon mangy
lot they are and no mistake. Master's got into a bad
stable haltogether. It don't take much of a prophet
to reckon them up. And them Pushforts is about
the worst of the whole biling. Why that hold
woman would do any dirty action to get squeeged
into one of the dook's parties, and see her name in the
papers. And the darter, oh, scissors! how she do
lay it on to Lady Madherewill. I'd turn 'em hup
pretty quick, if I was master. Would I leave that
hangelic creetur, as he's owner of, among sich a lot?
Not if I knowed it. I'd as leave turn the winner of
this year's Hoaks into a knacker's yard, or a hospittle
for cab-'osses, if so be as sich a hinstitooshun existed
hanywheres in this here charrytible metrolopus." So
saying, Mr. Tops executed half a score of winks
directed at vacancy, apparently intended to convey
the impression to inanimate nature that he was "all
there;" whistled a few bars of a popular melody;
felt in his pockets for a halfpenny, tossed it up, apparently 
speculating mentally on woman; caught it;
cried "tails it is," and proceeded to look "arter the
'osses" with a serenity which many a Serene Highness 
might well have envied.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">GONE TO THE AMERICAN BAR.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Whar do you hail from, stranger? Whar ar you bound to? What's
your bis'niss? Let's liquor up.&mdash;<i>States' Inquisition, passim</i>.</p>

<p>AT that very time, but not exactly at the same
hour, Mr. Manvers, after visiting various bars in New
York of the most refined and elegant pretensions, as
far as gas, liquor, language, and manners generally
were concerned, and after partaking of a diversified
series of "smiles," "cocktails," "mint-juleps," "eye-openers," 
"corpse-revivers," and other drinks remarkable 
for the ingenuity both of their concoction
and nomenclature, considered himself in a fit and
proper condition to be initiated into the mysteries of
the "United Association or Neck-or-nothing Blood-waders," 
whose threefold objects were to chaw up the
rotten English aristocracy, to annex the British Isles,
and to make Queen Victoria squirm.</p>

<p>"Yes, sirree," said an enthusiastic young lady
lecturer, who had just delivered an address at the
Apollo Rooms in favour of the association, and who
looked in her bloomer costume something like Robin

<!-- vol 1 page 351 -->

Hood as performed, say, at the Theatre Gravesend&mdash;"yes, 
sirree, and the b'hoys will do it, as sartain as
Cain whipped Abel."</p>

<p>"I calculate," remarked a tall Yankee, spitting
with admirable dexterity between Manvers and the
lady, "our General Winfield Scott would have made
your Duke of Wellington smell sulphur in jest about
the time he could draw one boot on. <i>Con</i>siderin' he
was some pumpkins in Europyan scrimmages, it's
perhaps fortunate that he served his time out and
got safely buried, before we had finally concluded to
annex your country."</p>

<p>The following is a portion of the speech delivered
on the occasion by Hon. Cincinnatus Chopper Hogg,
senator, from Applesarseville, Ohio:</p>

<p>"We see, gentlemen, a fellow-citizen hyar tonight, 
who has defied tyranny in its incestuous
cradle, and taken a sight at monarchy in its spirit-squelching 
home. The bloodthirsty catamounts of
despotism are howling on his footsteps over the
tremenjus whale-pond of the stormy Atlantic,
but I tell them in the name of this enlightened assemblage, 
in the name of Ada Camilla Ancrelina
Lexington Pants, whose soul-dazzling sentiments
have jest gone slick down into the deepest spring
in your hearts and struck ile, I reckon"&mdash;(immense
applause)&mdash;"I tell these stumped-out skunks of antediluvian 
despotism, that the sooner they slide and
make tracks home, and tell Madame Victoria to
shut up that old curiosity-store and rag-shop of
hers, the British Constitooshun, the better it will
be for their constitooshuns, unless they prefer

<!-- vol 1 page 352 -->

being accommodated for glory in a coat of tar and
feathers. You see hyar, I say, in this stranger,
whom we welcome tew-night, a forest plant of
freedom which has busted out of that darned old
mouldy hothouse of the Britishers to spread his
eagle wings in a dazzling atmosphere of action. He
has come, as it were, like a critter out of an exhausted 
receiver to breathe the free air, and to suck
the free drinks of an enlightened republic through
the straw of equality" (cheers) "tendered to him
by the Goddess of Liberty herself, attired in the
pantilettes of our beautiful female costume&mdash;a
straw, gentlemen, cut by the sickle of emancipated
labour from the illimitable expanse of those waving
corn-fields, where the setting sun gilds with gorgeous 
splendour a wilderness of ungarnered grain,
and laughs to scorn with the happy opossum in
the gum-tree and full-fed fetterless 'coon&mdash;as they
grin over the ten-foot loam of the inexhaustible sile
of our glorious river valleys&mdash;the petty rotation-system 
and agricultural insolvency of that top-booted, 
busted-up, old fossil blow-hard, John Bull."
(Tumultuous expression of rapture.) "I tell yew,
fellow-citizens and Blood-waders," continued the
inspired orator, "that when the Pilgrim Fathers
quitted that darned little island thyar&mdash;that is, if
they ever did quit it; for I du myself believe that
if this glorious country war ever discovered at all, it
was done by a natyve American&mdash;the only fammily
of trew grit they left behind them was that of the
illustrious stranger whom we welcome in this hall
to-night. If, gentlemen, you doubted the fact, his

<!-- vol 1 page 353 -->

name alone would prove it to you. I pronounce
that name aloud, and call on yew for a cheeyr to
shake the dust out of the trestles of the rotten
coffin-throne of monarchy to St. James's, London,
with a forty Niagara power of American acclamation&mdash;three 
cheeyrs and a tiger for Washington Otis
Lafayette Shofel Winch. He can hit straight out
from the shoulder, and weighs over two hundred
and twenty pound."</p>

<p>We need not add that the cheers were deafening
and unanimous. It will be seen that Mr. Manvers
had paid a handsome tribute to his adopted country
in his change of name. We will not trouble ourselves 
to republish his speech in answer, which was
hearty and so much to the purpose, that it formed
two or three splendid headings for the next issue of
the "New York Renegade," in the following style:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>IMMENSE SENSATION! EDITOR COW-HIDED AGAIN!!</p>

<p>SPEECH OF A DEMOCRATIC BRITISHER.</p>

<p>THREATENED ANNEXATION OF THE BRITISH ISLES.</p>

<p>THE BLOOD-WADERS CONCLUDE FOR INSTANT
INVASION.</p>

<p>BARNUM IN THE ASCENDANT. A ROYAL "HAPPY
FAMILY" BESPOKEN FOR HIS MUSEUM, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>An escaped criminal makes a first-rate indignation
rebel and patriot in a foreign clime, and Manvers lost
no opportunity of painting his country in the blackest
colours. Unfortunately he was furnished too readily
with texts, which only required to be handled with a

<!-- vol 1 page 354 -->

little dexterity to still further inflame the virulence of
Transatlantic resentment against the Old Country.
The Sutherland evictions, the wrongs of Ireland, and
the starving poor of England, lost nothing in his
hands; and when he proceeded to declare that the
rotten-hearted oligarchs of Great Britain hated and
feared the free institutions of the States, and that the
ladies of the Court were instructed not even to dance
with a Yankee Attach&eacute; at that old rabbit-hutch of a
palace at St. James's, the speaker made a hit beyond
his most sanguine expectations. He was the lion&mdash;we 
beg pardon, the "old boss," the live alligator, the
real grit, the striped and spotted ring-tailed painter
of the evening, and if the "drunk" had lasted long
enough, and no fresh excitement had occurred to
wipe him out, his admirers would have been ready to
run him for President, had there been no legal impediment 
to such a proceeding.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Mr. Manvers and his political
prospects, his money was soon spent, and the sympathy 
of his admirers and adherents vanished with it.
We must do them the justice to say that, had his
pocket been much better stored than it was, they
would nearly, if not quite as soon, have got tired of
him, and pronounced the fatal verdict of his extinction,
in the craving after some fresh excitement. The
sentence of "Let him slide!" is nowhere so easily
and certainly pronounced of a new favourite as in
that wonderful country, where Society is represented
by a series of dissolving views, and where whole strata
of men and measures vanish, and give place to new,
not less completely, but somewhat more rapidly than

<!-- vol 1 page 355 -->

the geological periods of the earth's formation. Washington 
Otis Lafayette was soon pronounced a fossil,
and shelved accordingly. On the occasion of his last
stump speech against England, his happiest efforts
fell utterly dead on the ears of the assembly; and
when he showed symptoms of disgust and indignation,
he narrowly escaped gouging and even lynching, and
was forced to make an ignominious exit. In vain
did he make&mdash;it must be owned in an intellectual
point of view&mdash;a most successful effort to adopt the
style and sentiment of the great Cincinnatus Chopper
Hogg, and tell his hearers that he could run a better
and bigger island than Britain from a spoonful of
melted metal into a wash-hand basin of dirty water.
In vain did he facetiously remark that the country was
so small, that a man could not safely get out of bed
in the morning without danger of stepping over the
side of the island. In vain did he denounce Queen,
Commons, and institutions. The temper of the mob
was different; and he was denounced for his pains in
libelling our beloved and respected Sovereign as a
mean-spirited skunk and scoundrel. True it is that
he had attempted an "operation" in American notions,
especially in revolvers and torpedoes, for the purposes
of invasion; and another in Catawba wine and peach-brandy, 
with the avowed determination of forcing on
the haughty islander the products of the Western
hemisphere, so soon as a Republican Proclamation
should be dated from St. James's. True it is, that
he had contracted for ten thousand hickory handles to
furnish bill-hooks for cutting down the hedges of Kent
and Surrey, and dislodging the defenders of those

petty counties; but the game was soon up, and his
hotel bill had become unpleasantly proportionate to
the colossal characteristics of the favoured abiding-place 
of the bird of freedom. So Manvers "sloped,"
and tried billiards down South; but it didn't answer.
He migrated to California; but was unsuccessful at
the diggings. He then returned northward, and
actually for some time existed as touter in an establishment 
for the plunder of poor emigrants on their
landing. At last, however, he joined a spirit-rapping
confraternity in the capacity of bully, and picked up
a tolerable livelihood.</p>

<p>Here let us leave him at present, having already
somewhat anticipated the present date of our narrative. 
Throughout all his vicissitudes there was
something which he clung to and cherished&mdash;something 
in the shape of a soiled deed or lease, which he
would occasionally unfold from its resting-place near
his gorilla-like bosom, and look at with mingled
passion and exultation. Then, after a coarse onion-flavoured 
supper, he would breathe curses in the supposed 
direction of England, and shake his clenched
fist with malignant spite and triumph. For whatever
it was, he seemed under the impression that it could
only be made use of to his own benefit, were he to
return to the Old Country, which did not exactly lie
within the sphere of his calculations. As it was, it
sufficed to feed revenge, and soothe his tortured spirit
with the feeling that some one whom he hated suffered
through his possession of that mysterious document.</p>

<p>Clever as Manvers was in a certain line, he found
Yankee smartness on its own ground more than a

<!-- vol 1 page 357 -->

match for him; and he longed to get back to England
to make use of his new observation and acquirements.
Had the epoch of his expatriation been a few years
later, he might have shone as a Fenian leader with
brilliant success. But in that respect he lived before
his time, like other heroes who have not made their
mark in their generation.</p>

<p>If, however, Fortune was so far cruel to John
Swindles Manvers, <i>alias</i> Washington Otis Lafayette
Shofel Winch, <i>alias</i> Dr. Mordred Orfila Grinder,
she has not been niggardly in her after-supply of a
sufficient crop of rascaldom to meet the exigencies of
the demand and the occasion.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">A DIGRESSION AND A DEFENCE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The earliest story-telling we are acquainted with is undoubtedly of
Eastern origin. Of this, the Arabian Nights' Entertainments may be
taken as the best known popular and meritorious example. These may
be considered in one respect as essentially digressive; since story is
included within story, like the ivory balls in a Chinese puzzle. This
example has been followed by some of the best modern writers; not
only so far as story-telling is concerned, but in actual digressions of
the author. Whether this be regarded as an insidious attempt on a
writer's part to introduce his own sentiments and opinions, tacked on
to his legitimate narrative like a parcel of superabundant trimmings or
embroidery, or as the mere exhibition of a rambling and loquacious propensity, 
it is not our intention even to attempt to determine. But if a
romance may aspire sometimes to accomplish a higher mission, than
merely to impair the memory and weaken the understanding by peopling
the brain with characters without reflection&mdash;mere clothed lay figures
and painted puppets set in motion through an ingenious tourbillon of
events&mdash;to end most commonly in the commonest catastrophe of
marriage, then the author may justly be allowed occasionally to ride
his own hobbies as best he may. And this even at the peril of bringing
down upon his head the stern censure of the Genius of criticism, who
either condemns his style, or has been hit in the eye by some chance
date-stone flung at random from the speculative attic-window among
the crowd of passers-by.&mdash;ARBELLINUS. <i>Philosophic Inquiries</i>, vol. ii.
chap. viii. pp. 93-4.</p>

<p>OUR fantoccini are put to bed for a time, and consequently 
we, in the capacity of showman, having
our hands temporarily disengaged, feel inclined to
embrace the opportunity, and make a speech on

<!-- vol 1 page 359 -->

behalf of our story and ourselves. Therefore, ladies
and gentlemen, be kind enough not to walk down
and refresh yourself just at present, although the
drop-scene has just fallen on Act I., and the entr'acte
has in reality commenced. We shall not plead profit
and expediency as our excuse for anything that we
may have uttered, or made our characters utter, to
offend the delicate susceptibilities of the "world."
This we leave to the fast authors and authoresses of
the period, who write up or down to the depravity
and false taste which they recognise as their market,
and increase the craving by pandering to its demands.
We could, had we been so minded, have far more
easily have shunted ourselves into the recognised
grooves of fiction. Nay, as the critics cannot put us
either into the confessional or the witness-box, we
are not disposed to confess what we may have already
done in this line. A "great thing" was open in
dashing ritualistic romance, seasoned with bigamy,
and husband-poisoning <i>quan. suff</i>. A slashing financial 
bubble story of the day has, we admit, suggested 
itself to our humble capacities, illustrated
by some well-known characters. But we felt that we
should have been treading on too dangerous ground.
We could not easily have steered clear of personality;
for in depicting this style of roguery, who could have
escaped&mdash;we mean, of course, in the great commercial 
world? Of the resentment of the mere
minority of detected rogues, we, of course, should
have not felt so much apprehension, at least for
periods varying from five to fifteen years to come.

<!-- vol 1 page 360 -->

But of the vast and powerful body of the unconvicted
rich and unscrupulous, united in the common instincts 
and interests of self-protection, we must own
we stand in wholesome apprehension and fear. What
deadly enmity might we not have incurred at the
hands of the righteous who are not yet forsaken!
No, we are not distinguished for prudence; but
we cannot afford to excite the anger of the larger
half of this prosperous commercial community. Look
at all the clever schemers and swindlers who have
sold out in time, or settled money on their wives, or
whom the law can't catch, or refuses to tackle. The
other day we inquired after the health of a financier
of some celebrity, whose utter smash and exposure
we looked for every morning in our daily paper.</p>

<p>"Just done the neatest thing I've heard for many
a day," was the answer from a friend of an appreciative 
turn and faculty. "Don't you remember
hearing of his return for Sneaksborough?"</p>

<p>We answered that we did perfectly well, but that
he would never take his seat; as there was a valid
and powerful petition for corruption and bribery cut
and dried.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" laughed our informant, "is there?
That's all you know about it. The petition is quashed,
that you may rest assured of; and what is more
Jobkins has pocketed a thousand pounds clear gain
by his election, after paying all his expenses."</p>

<p>We looked our astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" we said.</p>

<p>"Most people pay something to get into Parliament, 
don't they?" asked our friend; "more or less

<!-- vol 1 page 361 -->

one way or the other, especially for such a cursed
rotten place as Sneaksborough, where every vote is
counted and valued. Let me see, it was done last
time for just treble the money he made; but it turned
out a good investment for the scamp who got in
then. Well, you see, our friend Jobkins cast a
wolf's eye upon Sneaksborough, where there was a
great depreciation in the staple trade of the town just
then&mdash;and is now, for that matter&mdash;and he accordingly 
went in for a large foreign contract in
coloured shirtings&mdash;twenty-eight thousand pounds
was the figure. He managed to get rid of this
for thirty-three thousand pounds, thereby clearing
five thousand pounds. It cost him two thousand
pounds to get in, and another neat two thousand
pounds to bribe the petitioners to squash their virtuous 
endeavour. So that you see, as I said, he got
his seat clear, and a thousand pounds in the bargain.
Decidedly the cleverest thing of the day, and I've
known a few smart ones, and no mistake, old fellow."</p>

<p>Now, the fact is, there is another great difficulty
in holding up the mirror to the financial world.
When almost every one is, and must necessarily be,
a rogue, in order to succeed in acquiring position and
fortune, how is the novelist to distinguish and select
his materials? It is a perfect <i>embarras de richesses</i>,
or, more properly, <i>des riches</i>. One wants lights as
well as shadows in painting every view of life. There
are honest men still with money, made or inherited
by their fathers, and there are many more honest
without it. There are honourable professional men,
even of eminence, <i>rari nantes in gurgite vasio</i>. There

<!-- vol 1 page 362 -->

are poor rogues with feelings and a conscience. There
are noblemen like Lord Egbert, and noble women like
Blanche. There are good-natured, well-meaning
personages like Madeiraville, and worthy and zealous
crotchet-mongers like Mr. De Lolme. There are
mixed characters like Arthur Aubrey, whose follies
and vices do not originate from the heart. Then
there is a large and safe choice of model villains in
every profession and walk of life, whence one may
pick out examples without personality, or peril of
incurring the pleasant penalties of libel, true or false.
One does not impeach all the profession, in branding 
the professional villainies of Grinderby and
Cousens; nor render oneself liable for a breach of
privilege in sketching the portraiture of the Right
Honourable Felix Sowerface, M.P. In painting a
brace of lawyer's clerks, we have not injured a large
and deserving body of our fellow-citizens; and in our
picture of the Escurial and its frequenters, although
we are thereby conscious of running a tilt against
a huge demoralising institution of the age, we are
certain that no one can pretend to recognise the
exact specimen or locality which has furnished our
materials. As for the general and particular reflections 
on men and manners, on fashions and
frivolities, the freaks of our puppets, and the showman's 
running commentary on them and their surroundings; 
as to our political and social diatribes,
and the evils that we see, or seem to see, spreading
and festering like a gangrene around, we beg to
apologise most particularly to every one who feels
hurt by anything that we have said. It shows, at

<!-- vol 1 page 363 -->

least, that there is some conscience and self-appreciation 
extant.</p>

<p>And depend upon it that those who affect to be
offended on behalf of others are tarred by the same
brush which we have flourished so sacrilegiously&mdash;at
least, in their imagination. If that be sound, which
our sense and feeling, rightly or wrongly, teach us
to denounce as rotten; if we are deluded in our
conclusion that her commercial prosperity, and the
former proud success of her arms, have led to the
waste of England's elements of strength, the selfish
neglect of her industrious poor, the insecurity of her
shores, the diminution of her power and prestige,
and the insincerity of her statesmen and public men,
then we are also willing to apologise for a delusion, as
impotent and harmless, as it is complete. If we have
endeavoured to sift the country's social relations, and
found that they are all based on hollowness and wrong;
that there is no sympathy between class and class;
and that never in the history of the world was there an
age of base metal, such as exists in Great Britain in
the present era; and if our facts and theories, our
deductions and conclusions, are alike false and uncalled 
for, then we must plead our want of penetration 
and our ignorance of right living.</p>

<p>If human flesh and blood are not held cheaper here
than the hunter's game in a boundless wilderness
teeming with life; more worthless than the carcasses
of wolf or rat, while the luxury of the few boils down
the essence of millions of their fellow-creatures' bones,
with a cynicism more atrocious than that of the
Roman gluttons who cast their slaves into their eel-stews 

<!-- vol 1 page 364 -->

to fatten and flavour the slimy luxury to the
correct patrician taste, then our fancy is mistaken;
unless, indeed, it should be conceded that such things
do exist, and that it is essential they should be as
they are.</p>

<p>Possibly Moloch and the Minotaur of Crete do
not demand their yearly tribute of maidens sacrificed
in street and in mill to lust of man and greed of gold!
And the ladies of England, they combine their
forces, do they not, in virgin cohort and matronly
phalanx, to rescue and defend their doomed or erring
sisters?&mdash;"sisters," did we say? we ask pardon for
the mistake. These ladies of wealth, and beauty,
and rank, they do not rather excuse Moloch for his
fantasy, and pat Minotaur on the back. "Naughty
demon," and "funny monster," they do not say.
Of course, the poor foreigner, or the denationalised
Englishman who suggests such a libel, is worthy
of the pillory, and of the stones which furnished St.
Stephen's cairn. Out, blasphemous rascal! Hit
him on the mouth, young hero of the Escurial and
the Lady's Ride, "darling fellow" of your sister,
and "dear boy" of the night-house keeper, and your
other "friends." Hitherto, <i>ingenuus puer</i> of the double
face, and habitation, and language&mdash;no, not quite
language; since the drawing-room rather patronises
the argot of the casino and the slum&mdash;hither! and
pronounce our condemnation in your "awfullest"
style. We are <i>not</i> "awfully jolly;" do not, therefore, 
commend us to your present Hetaira, or your
destined bride. Here is a gentleman of fortune, who

<!-- vol 1 page 365 -->

shall assist you in denouncing us. <i>Non olet</i>. His
money does not smell. True, he is a felon; but an unconvicted 
one&mdash;what is that to you or us? He gives
first-rate spreads, and has a vote in Parliament,
interest without principle, dear boy! He might get
you appointed to a commissionership to examine into
the crowded state of the charnel-houses of the poor.
Think of that, and honour his success! He has built
his domestic edifice of respectability on the ruin of
a thousand shareholders, and got clear of the meshes
of the financial snare in time. We are only supposed
to be writing on a second floor for bread and fame.
You had better take a lesson from his book than ours.
Here is a clergyman. What was his text on Sunday?
"Go, and sin no more." He preached from it an
excellent sermon, written by a needy contributor to
a sporting paper, who is secretary to a casino, and
has a large family to bring up in sin, prosperously if
he can. He paid for it, and preached it too. What
more do you expect from him? He left his sermon
in the vestry-room; its precepts and practice at the
church door. He will condemn us to his lady admirers 
in terms of the strongest reprobation. What
is that book of poems, reverend sir, that you hold in
your hand? "Hermaphroditus, a Classical Drama,"
and "Lays of Sapphic Love." These are only semi-imaginative 
pruriencies, the lacquered filth of Greece
and Rome, the "nude and the antique," and the sensually 
"sublime." That which the age should reject
and condemn is Truth, in modern garb of broadcloth, 
in crinoline or in rags. This is what it likes

<!-- vol 1 page 366 -->

not; dares not listen to. Conceal your moral ulcers,
Respectability! Beggar! hide your sores in the
street.</p>

<p>And now, ere the curtain rises on other and different 
scenes, we once more bid you, dear reader,
pause, ere you question the reality and vraisemblance
of our personages, or the conduct of our tale. Our
moral you will not&mdash;cannot&mdash;condemn. You, sir,
are a father and a husband; you, madam, a sister, a
mother, or a wife. Be you what you may, you are
human in your sympathies. You love virtue&mdash;at
least, in the abstract&mdash;do you not? You would roll
back the tide of reproach that threatens to overwhelm 
England; if you could do it by a wish, by
a thought, apart from your own passions and prejudices, 
and the circumstances which benefit you, or
hem you in? And you, young lady or gentleman,
if you are not too pure and innocent to enter a theatre,
or read a newspaper, or walk by daylight in our public
streets, neither parent nor guardian, neither lover
nor brother, need fear that you will suffer any diminution 
of your innocence and purity by the perusal
of these pages. Would that the pages of real life,
the panorama of breathing forms and beings around
you, were better and purer for your sakes!</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">A JEWEL IN A ROUGH SETTING.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The old merchant took from a worn and greasy purse a small packet
of folded linen of such dingy hue and unwholesome aspect, that it
looked like a shred which had escaped the flames in the sweepings of a
leper's hut, or a decayed fragment of dress detached in the last shiver
of an expiring pauper, and left at some closed workhouse door in the
night, a contribution to the huge rag-mill of civilised greed. Carefully 
unfolding this uninviting cover, the hoary trafficker in gems exhibited 
a diamond of such surpassing lustre, that it would have made
the mouth of ducal Brunswick water, while worthy of being pawned by
the princely hand of an Esterhazy himself. "Ha!" he cried, as the
jewel flashed the brighter for his trembling grasp, "you Christians
judge everyting by his outward dress, but vere sall you find soche a
treasure in a monarch's heart? Ven you find him, listen to old Posn&auml;i&mdash;keep 
him and sherish him ash your lifes. He is more precious dan

tousands&mdash;tyrants mit deir soldiers, ploonderers mit deir slafes."&mdash;<i>Stories 
of Unlettered Graves. Story III.</i>, chap i.</p>

<p>"YOU'RE a spicy hinwestment, you air," observed
a curious-looking individual, apparently addressing
a new street besom, as he threw it down, with an air
of great exasperation, in the centre of a clean crossing
nearly opposite St. George's Church, Hanover-square,

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

about three p.m. on a Saturday afternoon, just three
years after the events which we have narrated in the
preceding volume. "Not a drop of blessed rain 'as
fell, since I took to this ere bis'ness," he continued.
"It couldn't be wus, hif I'd bin and prayed agen vet
veather, like the Harchbishop of Middlesex hisself,
hassisted by the hunited clargy of Hengland; not
that I never saw no good cum of their hinterference
vith the veather horfice. As if they wos humpires
of wot the correct card orter be, and could work the
horacle hever so much better than Natur. It's wot I
calls cheek, and no mistake, to be heverlastin' axing
Providenx for sumthin'; and findin' fault with this,
and worritin' about t'other. It's wot the nobs don't
take from we. Jest think, hif I was to ring the
Prime Minister's airey bell, much less cum a double
knock at his front door, and ax him jest to stop his
huniwersal tackses, 'cos I vanted to keep a brace of
bull-pups, or vun either, for that matter. I expex I
should werry soon find my road to quod special.
Holloa! here's a swell a comin'! Now then, show
yer muscle, will yer, and wot yer could do, hif the
streets wos muddy."</p>

<p>And with this injunction to himself, the individual
picked up his besom and began to sweep the clean
road with a series of flourishes, that would have done
justice to the most talented pantomimist, about a yard
in front of a portly and well-to-do personage. The
latter said, somewhat good-humouredly:</p>

<p>"Confound you, don't raise the dust in that
manner."</p>

<p>"Ax yer pardin. I wish yer honour'd come down

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

with it," was the ready rejoinder. "It's very dry,
sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, you idle rascal, and that's why you've no
business here," observed the other.</p>

<p>"No bis'ness?" was the reply, "ven I bought the
goodwill of this ere harrystocratic station for 'arf a
couter and a pint of rum honly last Vensday!"</p>

<p>"You've no business here on a fine day like this, I
tell you," rejoined the gentleman.</p>

<p>"If you'd written to say you wos a comin', I'd
a looked at my barromyter," replied the incorrigible 
crossing-sweeper. The gentleman laughed and
tossed him a penny, which he caught, spit on, and
pocketed, calling out after his patron, "Thank ye,
sir; it's the first 'arf-pint I've raised this blessed
arternoon. If you'll send a tellygraf the next hout-and-hout 
vet mornin', I'll lay down some red carpeting 
for yer, and bring my very best silk humbereler
vith the mother-o'-pearl 'andle."</p>

<p>So saying, the individual abandoned himself to a
fresh ebullition of sweeping, as if it were a matter of
conscience quite essential to his peace of mind.</p>

<p>We shall now attempt to describe the appearance
of the "Downy;" for such was the appellation by
which he was known to the circle of his private and
public acquaintance, to which some added the patronymic 
of "Cove," making his total nomenclature the
"Downy Cove," or, as he would frequently insist
upon it, "Downy Cove, Eskvire, gent at large, and
of nowheres else pertickler." He was a thin, very
pale, and, if one could possibly use such a term,
fair young man, of any age from twenty-four to

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

thirty, or upwards. He looked as if he had been
rained upon all his life, until all the colour had been
washed out of him, and then well ingrained with
dirt during a particularly dry summer. He gave
you the idea also of being in the last stage of inanition 
and consumption, whereas his constitution
was in reality of iron, and his strength enormous.
He would shoulder weights, and carry them with ease,
under which men of herculean build would stagger.
As for wet or cold, he could apparently defy the elements. 
He very seldom enjoyed an opportunity of
taking off his clothes; and no amount of generosity
on the part of any one had ever been known to improve 
his dress, for the reason that he invariably
turned any contribution of this kind into money with
the utmost despatch. To this man comfort was
utterly unknown&mdash;we mean in the sense usually
attached to it. He had his little comforts; but they
were chiefly connected with the delights afforded by
a tenth-rate public-house. Gin was his weakness,
and skittles his forte. He was not a drunkard&mdash;partly 
from necessity and partly from choice. But
if he took one glass of gin, which he was not always
prevailed upon to indulge in, and could get more, the
desire of which was an inevitable consequence, then
he would become</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">O'er all the ills of life victorious.</p>

</div>

<p>So thoroughly jolly, so supremely happy, and so
superlatively good-natured, though disposed to be
argumentative and patronising on such occasions,
was he, that policemen have been known to abstain

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

from taking him into custody, while stern and sullen
landlords would relax occasionally from the severe
discipline regulating their public department, and
allow him to remain after all his money was expended, 
and even sleep on a bench in the tap-room,
instead of turning him out into the street on a rainy
or foggy night. Nor was this altogether disinterested
on their part; for his "company" was so much
esteemed, on account of his conviviality and humour,
that he frequently greatly increased the demand for
" 'arf-pints" and "two-pennorths." Deeply impressed
with the conviction that honesty is not the best policy
in this world, according to his experience, he yet possessed 
the merit of being scrupulously honest.</p>

<p>Just before the period of our introduction to him,
the "Cove" had lost what he called a "reg'lar
hincome" derived from window-cleaning and carpet-beating 
in the Temple, owing to the new police regulations 
of the Inn, and the introduction of a more
pretentious rival, so that he was in a very forlorn and
dilapidated condition, even for him.</p>

<p>His birth and parentage were mysteries which
he never revealed. Probably he could not. We do
not believe that he ever enjoyed even the advantage
of a workhouse baptism. He had escaped registration 
and dodged the Census. It must be owned that
he was an exceedingly clever and handy fellow. He
was a carpenter, locksmith, whitesmith, and blacksmith; 
he could put down a carpet or put up blinds
and curtains against any man. His chief glory,
however, lay in moving furniture, especially if the
job was what he called "special;" that is, one which

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

required secrecy and despatch&mdash;in short, a flitting.
We are afraid that our honest friend's sympathies
were rather on the side of tenant than Landlord, on
these occasions; but this was mere sympathy with
the poorer and weaker side. Yet this pariah of civilisation, 
this Arab of the streets, had done things, for
which he was virtually entitled to the Victoria Cross
and the Royal Humane Society's gold medal. Once,
at the imminent risk of his life, he saved half a dozen
human beings, chiefly children, from being burnt to
death, and the praises of the firemen, very gallant
fellows, no doubt, but not the right recipients of
praise or bounty on this occasion, were duly recorded
in the papers. As for the Downy, all that he got was
hearty abuse, and the threat of being locked up by an
active and intelligent "officer" of the C Division,
who displayed remarkable energy in endeavouring to
prevent any life from being saved at all. This useful
guardian of the public peace and morals was possessed 
of a leading idea, namely, that no one, save a
fireman, ought to enter a house in flames, though its
inmates were screaming for aid from a top window;
and as no one save the Downy seemed inclined to
enter, he was for some time thrust back by the active
and intelligent officer, whereby three lives were
actually lost. The policeman was rather complimented 
than otherwise on the inquest; and the absent
Downy was described as a young man somewhat active 
on the occasion; but, as the policeman roundly declared, 
a well-known associate of thieves. The poor
fellow was laid up, severely burnt, for at least three
weeks in the hospital. He had saved many persons from

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

drowning, especially in winter, in Hyde Park, where
he was a distinguished character for sweeping, sliding,
skate-fitting, and facetiousness. Once he plunged in
when a wholesale immersion had taken place; and
some wretched urchin stole his coat, cap, and waistcoat,
which happened to be a little better than usual. It
may be thought that, after saving no less than five
persons on this occasion, and for a time actually
losing the free use of his limbs in consequence, from
which he miraculously recovered, something would
have been done for him. No! the "active and intelligent 
officers," who were ready to take the drowning 
persons into custody, if they could have got at
them, and a brace of officials of the Rescue Society,
who would neither stir themselves nor let any one else
have the use of their ropes and appliances, divided all
the honour and profit among themselves. We beg
pardon, not all, for Bumbledom had its share. The
master and matron of the workhouse where the bodies
were laid out got one hundred guineas and a handsome 
tea-service for acting respectably under the
public gaze on the occasion, on the day that the
crippled Downy got a sovereign out of the poor-box
from the "worthy and benevolent magistrate" to
whom his case was made known. There was some
vague talk started by disinterested spectators of procuring 
him the <i>bronze</i> medal of the R.H.S.; but the
Downy "didn't seem to see it," to use his own expression. 
In fact, he looked upon the proposition
rather in the light of an insult than otherwise. Had
Her Most Gracious Majesty been made acquainted
with the circumstances through a proper channel, it

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

is probable that be would have received another
pound, but she was not. It may be thought that all
this would have embittered his disposition, and made
him cynical and morose. Not a bit of it. He was
as ready to dash into a burning house, or plunge
amidst broken ice into sixteen feet of water, as ever.
It imbued him with some degree of contempt for the
institutions of his country, that was all, and about
these at times he would express himself somewhat
strongly.</p>

<p>"Holloa!" quoth this remarkable individual to a
wretched-looking girl with a few bunches of faded
flowers in her hands. "Whose garden was you
robbin' last Friday was a fortnight? Surely you
don't hexpect to find hany vun green enough to buy
that lot, do yer? They looks as hif they'd been worn
by the female patients in Bedlam, and then been
slep upon by a workus hundertaker's man as died in
a fit of blue ruin."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him vacantly; but replied nothing, 
as she feverishly and nervously sorted and
twisted her faded store.</p>

<p>"Come, young woman," continued the Downy,
"I didn't mean no reflexshuns upon yer bis'ness. It
ain't no wusser nor mine, I'll lay a penny. There, I
didn't mean to hurt yer feelinx. Stop them water-works."</p>

<p>"Mother's a dying, and I haven't taken a farthing
to-day," sobbed the girl. "The doctor said she was
to have wine, and we haven't a bit of food to give
her, and I'm that tired I don't believe I can get
home&mdash;indeed I don't."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

<p>"You're a honfeelink brute, Downy, that's wot
you air," said the Cove, addressing himself, as was his
wont sometimes. "If I'd got it, vich I haven't, you
should 'ave sumthink to take 'ome, my dear," he
said; "and if you'll wait here now, till I gets a stroke
of luck, blowed if yer shan't go 'arves, that's all about
it. Set down on them steps; here's a gent a comin'
in a precious hurry, and no mistake."</p>

<p>As he said this, no less a personage than the
amiable Mr. Grinderby came up "at the double,"
much in the style of an elderly Volunteer as depicted
in the French "Charivari."</p>

<p>"Here, you fellow," he said, as soon as he could
get breath enough to speak, "is there a cab-stand
hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Get you vun in a brace of jiffies, guv'nor, if
you'll wait, and put yer bag down a minnit," was the
reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby gruffly assented, and did as he was
recommended, and the Downy laid down his besom,
and ran off rapidly towards Regent-street.</p>

<p>"Buy a flower from a poor girl, sir?" said the
young female, rising from the steps of the church
and approaching Mr. Grinderby. "I haven't taken
a penny to-day, and my mother is sick and starving
for want of bread."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" cried Grinderby, flourishing his umbrella;
"keep off, or I'll give you in charge, you slut, you.
D'ye think I want to catch a fever from your beastly
flowers? Here, policeman! Take this female into
custody for begging," he said, addressing one of the
Force, who just came up.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

<p>"Now, then, move on, will yer? or I'll make
yer!" was that worthy's address to the girl. "Ah!
you want a night's lodging, do yer?"</p>

<p>And with that he made towards her, and seized
her by the wrist, so that her flowers fell on the pavement, 
where they lay like withered hopes on the
letterless gravestone of an unknown despair.</p>

<p>"Oh, good sir, kind sir, let me go, my mother's
dying!" she screamed out.</p>

<p>At this moment a four-wheeled cab drove up with
the Downy on the box. He opened the door, and
Grinderby got in, shouting:</p>

<p>"To Paddington Station, as fast as you can
drive."</p>

<p>"Ax yer parding, ain't yer goin' to give me
nothink for fetchin' it?" cried the Downy.</p>

<p>"No!" bellowed Grinderby. "Here, policeman,
look after this man and woman. Drive on you; will
you?"&mdash;to the cabman&mdash;"d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"I ain't deaf," said "cabby;" evidently trying to
give an opportunity for the reward due to his summoner.</p>

<p>"Policeman," cried Grinderby, "do your duty. I
ordered this fellow to drive on, and he is loitering
here."</p>

<p>The policeman seized the reins of the horse with
one of his red and horny hands by way of answer,
and pushed him on his haunches, and then kicked
him in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Do you hear the gentleman?" he said. "Drive
off, or it will be the worse for yer. What! yer

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

won't go on, won't yer? I've got yer number, and
I'll summon yer to-morrer, I will."</p>

<p>The unfortunate driver thought of his wife and
children, and said:</p>

<p>"No, offence, sir, I hope. I couldn't start no
sooner."</p>

<p>The "officer" was somewhat pacified: officers of
the Force like to be called "sir." It is a tribute
which they exact from the harried costermonger and
street stall-keeper. Under their distinguished chiefs,
they affect the military style, and as they are drilled
with the sabre, and put through military evolutions
in the barrack-yards of the Guards, there is some
little reason for it; and perhaps this is why they
affect the style and manner of an Austrian army of
occupation in an Italian town in this particularly free
and independent country of Britons.</p>

<p>As Grinderby drove off without giving him sixpence, 
our specimen of the Force felt inclined to be
savage at the expense of some one; and so he turned
round very fiercely on the girl and the Downy. For
some reason or other&mdash;probably because he was lazy,
and didn't see that anything could be made out of the
pair&mdash;he contented himself with a warning and a
few menacing gestures, and walked on.</p>

<p>"Hi, Bobby!" shouted the fearless Downy, when
he had got some paces off; "leave us a slice or two
of yer carrots, will yer?" alluding to the colour of
the "officer's" hair, which would have done credit
to a modern chignon; "I see yer sniffin' the cold
meat along hall them aireys," and other expressions

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

of the kind, which caused the policeman to face
round, and regard him in a threatening manner more
than once, before he had proceeded fifty yards on his
beat.</p>

<p>But the Downy in this instance showed more
valour than prudence; for it chanced that a young
fellow of dashing exterior passing rapidly by, and
observing the forlorn appearance of the girl, tossed
a shining sixpence in her lap, just at one of the very
moments when an unusually successful sarcasm of
the Downy caused the "Bobby" fully to face round,
as if hesitating whether to return or not. In a
moment he arrived at a decision. Rapidly retracing
his steps, he approached the shrinking girl, and
seizing her a second time by the arm, he dragged
her up and shook her violently.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said; "I told yer to move on,
didn't I? Come along quiet, or I'll give yer something 
to make yer."</p>

<p>The girl screamed and cried:</p>

<p>"I must go home, I tell you. I won't come. My
mother will die!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yer won't, won't yer?" was the rejoinder;
"then we'll see."</p>

<p>"Here, take this," shrieked the girl, giving him
the sixpence; "it's all I have, but let me go."</p>

<p>It was well for some one, perhaps for himself temporarily, 
but certainly for the Downy, in the contingent 
perspective of a broken head, hard swearing
on the part of the "officer," and the other active and
intelligent fraction of the Force within sound of his
rattle, that the policeman did let the girl go at that

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

precise moment. A street besom is not a handy
weapon for a sudden row. The twigs are not efficacious 
either to floor your antagonist or to grasp as a
handle. But such as it was, it was brandished in the
air, and had already executed a preliminary flourish
in the strong thin arms of the washed-out young
man, when the policemen pocketed the ransom and
released his Briseis. He then confronted the Downy,
hardly able to credit the possibility of a meditated
attack. The latter did not fear the newspapers of
the next morning; nor had a "month" any particular
terrors for him. Respectability must witness such
outrages committed in a "free country," and content
itself with writing to Scotland-yard or the Home
Office; a mode of proceeding which is a complete
waste of time, paper, ink, and a postage-stamp or
two, as the Yard pitches it into the waste-paper
basket, and the Office refers it back to the Yard.
But the Downy's passion was aroused, and he didn't
care "wot cum of it." Probably the "officer" on
his part did not much care to push matters to extremities, 
and was in haste to expend the ransom;
since the day was cold and dry and his complexion and
occupation thirsty. So he eyed the other as a glutted
hyena about to drink at a convenient stream might
regard the intrusion in his path of a starved jackal,
and merely indulging in a brace of scowls, turned
on his heel with a hand adroitly slipped upon the
head of his staff, in anticipation of the encounter
which he was content to shun. Perhaps he was not
very brave, that "officer." As a human hyena,
women and children were his natural prey. We

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

have spoken of the Downy's imperturbable good
humour. So thoroughly accustomed was he to such
scenes and events, so utterly contrary to his experience 
was anything else, that after a few expressive
grimaces, he quite acquiesced in the abject necessity
of the situation. Like the conquered but unconquerable 
Prometheus, he had long been known,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small"><i>τὸ τἢς ̓'ανάγκης ἔστ' 'αδήριτον σθένος</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>"Vell," was his reflection, half uttered to himself
and half to the girl, "I wouldn't be in his beadle-crushers 
when he's wanted by his Chief Commissioner." 
And he pointed significantly downward in
a direction which was not that of Scotland-yard nor
that of the residence of any earthly authority, unless
it might be at the antipodes, which certainly at that
moment did not enter into his calculations. "I vish
I'd got him someveres handy in a good carpet-beatin'
ground werry secluded and priwate; I'd fetch the dust
hout of his huniform for him. Come, don't be down-'arted, 
young 'ooman, I'm blessed if I don't earn a
bob for yer, afore yer a quarter of an hour holder.
I never was here afore vithout collaring vun, and I
don't mean to begin to-day, I can tell you. As for
that Bobby, let me ketch him in Hyde Park the first
Reform Meetin', and if I don't mark him my name's
not Downy."</p>

<p>The girl sat shivering and moaning. She hardly
noticed what he said. She had not even picked up
her scattered flowers. Grown in a crowded nursery 
ground for purposes of gain, in the mould
brought from a desecrated churchyard, cut by rude

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

hands, and left to be trampled into dust or mire by
the heedless passers, their brief existence seemed an
epitome of her own. Did she think all this? Not
a bit of it. She was thinking only of the hopeless
poverty of her East-end dwelling, and the face of her
sick mother turned towards the door in the faint
agony of expectation, perhaps of death itself.</p>

<p>The quick eye of the Downy, in the mean time,
scanned the few persons who approached and passed
by, with the practised gaze of an expert. Now and
then, he would burst into a sudden activity of sweeping, 
in proportion as his hopes of coin were more or
less excited. Shy men, without coppers to spare,
would avoid his crossing, others would make for him,
as if they wished to run him down. Shabby and
seedy persons would pause, and make an excuse, "I
haven't a copper about me, my good fellow;" or,
"I'll give you something next time," were their
most frequent remarks. To these he always respectfully 
touched his cap, and honoured them by one
or two slight flourishes of the "hinwestment." At
length his patience was rewarded. In full dinner
costume, with spotless white tie, and his last pair of
soiled evening gloves on his broad fat hands, the
gloves of the day being carefully stowed in the pocket
of his paletot, came our old friend Mr. Stingray,
with appetite sharpened by a glass of absinthe just
quaffed at V&eacute;ry's. He looked at his watch and he
looked at the church clock.</p>

<p>"Hem!" he said to himself, "I shall be late; and
I never keep my worst enemies waiting for dinner,
when I am going to dine with them myself. It spoils

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

the cook's temper, and endangers both the fish and
the sauce. Things are apt to be cold enough when
one is punctual. Here, you sir" (to the Downy),
"can you fetch me a cab?"</p>

<p>"That I can," replied the latter, too earnest to
waste a word in his usual style of conversation.</p>

<p>"Be quick, then! Mind, if you don't return with
it in five minutes, I shall not wait."</p>

<p>The Downy merely nodded, and ran up the street,
where we have already seen him disappear on a
similar errand. This time the girl was silent. Perhaps 
it was because she had no flowers to offer&mdash;perhaps 
she did not consider Mr. Stingray's face
sympathetic. There is no disciple of Lavater equal
to your beggar. We don't believe that Sir Robert
Hardun is ever importuned in the street by a real
professional cadger. We think it probable that the
Marquis of Gravesend, a really benevolent man,
though sometimes eccentric in his mode of showing
it, may have imposed upon the hopes of many of
his poorer fellow-citizens. Stingray observed the
girl sitting with her head almost bent down upon her
knees, and a desire to see if she was pretty in her
rags impelled that great cynical philosopher to address 
her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, my girl?" he inquired, 
in tones as little harsh and grating as he
could, without very much trouble, make them.</p>

<p>The girl looked up with a blear and blank expression 
of pain.</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted the philanthropical satirist.</p>

<p>The fact is, he had seen enough; and felt rather

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

angry with the poor wretch for disappointing his
vague expectation, that she might be pretty.</p>

<p>"You had better be off," he growled. "The
police don't do their duty, or you wouldn't be
allowed to sit there in that manner. It's disgraceful
in a civilised community."</p>

<p>Alas! the police had done their duty, in the person
at least of one of them, who was at that moment
smacking his lips in a neighbouring public-house
over the drops, as it were, of blood wrung from his
victim's veins.</p>

<p>"My mother is sinking&mdash;dying for want of food,
sir," uttered the girl at last; "will you bestow a
trifle on me in Heaven's name? She is ill of a
fever."</p>

<p>"The devil she is," interrupted the startled
"satyr"-ist, retreating several paces. "How dare you
bring contagion into the streets? If I could only
see a policeman," he added; "but they're all down
the areas, of course. Couldn't you invent something 
a little newer than that eternal sick mother of
yours?" he asked brutally. "I dare say you have
made a pretty harvest of it. Got a pocket full of
pence? Wouldn't take broken victuals, eh? Come,
I'll wager this half-crown you wouldn't."</p>

<p>And he balanced one he had taken a minute or so
before from his trouser-pocket, as if to mock her
with the coin.</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir," said the girl, "I haven't taken
a penny besides the one that good young man gave
me&mdash;him that's gone for the cab."</p>

<p>"I don't think he's coming back with the cab,"

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

muttered Stingray. "But, I say, how about this
generous rogue in tatters? Has he been making
love to you?" The girl looked up inquiringly. "Very
shocking!" quoth Stingray: "cheap immorality of
our London beggar population. Must make a note
of that. Reminds me of one of Burns's poems&mdash;let
me see. Will do for an after-dinner anecdote, with a
little embellishment <i>&agrave; la</i> Balzac. 'Cupid en <i>haillons!</i>'
good title for an article in the 'Rye-mount.' Do better
for the 'Babylon Diary'&mdash;call it the 'Romance of a
Doorstep,' or the 'Crossing-sweeper's Bride.' Ha!
ha! It's as well for you" (sternly to the girl) "that I
don't see a policeman. Ah! here's the cab at last."</p>

<p>The Downy at this moment made his appearance,
mounted on the box as before.</p>

<p>"So you've been an infernal time about it, sirrah!"
he said to the Downy.</p>

<p>"Couldn't help it nohow," replied that worthy.
"There was not a blessed vun on the stand, shofel
or four-vheeler, and consekently I had to hook it as
far as the Circus. The fact is," added the Downy, in
a confidential tone, "there's a werry mellancolly
waterman on that stand as is handy here, and it's
my hopinion that his 'ead's turned vith too much
prosperity, and he's took the last cab hisself, on
haccount of its slowness, and gone to dround hisself
in the Serpentine, or to wisit his wife's relations."</p>

<p>"So, so! you're a humorist, my man," remarked
Stingray, who had already taken out his note-book
from force of habit; "but I'm already late, and so
here, my fine fellow, take this to spend with your

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

young lady friend&mdash;here, no thanks! Drive fast,
cabman. Notting-hill. I'll direct you."</p>

<p>"Vell," quoth the Downy, "hif hever I judge of a
job agen by the hugliness of his mug, I'm jolly vell
blessed, and I hopes he'll henjoy his wittles, that I
do. Here, young 'ooman, here's luck. Didn't I say
so? Come along, vill yer! till I melts the shiner?
I'll stand a pot of sixpenny, and give yer a bob, s'elp
me Californy."</p>

<p>And he tossed the half-crown so high that he
missed catching it, and it fell flat on the pavement
with a sound that seemed to excite the Downy to a
fresh phase of emotion. As he picked it up, which
he did instantly, he placed it between his teeth, to
which it seemed to convey a galvanic shock. In a
moment he started at top-speed, flinging the hinwestment 
(his besom) twenty yards before him the way
he took, which was the same direction in which
Stingray had vanished rapidly from sight, comfortably 
reclining in the four-wheeler with his legs on
the back cushions.</p>

<p>"Hi! stop the cab! It's a bad un! It's a bad
un!" shouted the poor fellow.</p>

<p>Full fifty yards the Downy ran, and then stopped
short, like a schoolboy who has pretended to start for
a race in order to "sell" a companion, whom he allows
to get a-head and run on. Ruefully did he scratch
bis head, and mournfully did he retrace his steps to
his sad companion's side.</p>

<p>"Look, here's a duffer!" he observed, showing her
the half-crown bent nearly double with his teeth.

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

"The wicious, aggerawatin' old willain, to come this
game over me, and I know he knowed it hall at the
time. And I might a' knowed it, if I'd honly believed 
my heyes. With a face fit to frighten a child
into fits, and to think I couldn't reckon him hup,
and let him walk hover me, as hif I was vun of them
born and heddicated hidiots as is meant to be done as
round as hoops hall their blessed lives, and don't know
a half-couter from a new brass farden."</p>

<p>And as if to relieve the violence of his feelings, the
Downy took his besom and went through the ceremony 
of sweeping the crossing briskly for full half a
minute. As for the girl, she fairly burst into a fit of
tears, and cried as if her heart would break. She
had already spent her fifteenpence, after her own
wish&mdash;for she determined to compound with the
Downy for a penn'orth of spruce for her own drinking, 
and then there was the penny he had already
given her. She would not have deemed it grateful or
lady-like to refuse to take anything with her benefactor. 
She had bought, in imagination, an ounce
of "tea," a quarter of a pound of sugar, a loaf of
bread, two ounces of butter, a halfpennyworth of milk,
fourteen pounds of coal, and a penny candle, and expended 
the remaining twopence&mdash;would it be twopence
or twopence halfpenny?&mdash;in half a quartern of gin.
Or could she make it threepence, and so get threepenn'orth 
of brandy? And all this was shattered&mdash;and 
not to be! It was too much. A vision of a
rapidly flowing stream lipping the arches of a dismal
and dingy bridge actually took possession of the poor
creature's fancy. Oh! if the rich could enter for a

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

brief while the inner world of the every-day life of
the poor, could think with their jaded brains, feel
with their aching hearts, crave with their entrails,
see with their eyes, speculate with their thoughts, and
add figure by figure their daily sum of miseries and
wants&mdash;would or could prosperous humanity remain
colder than stone or marble, more diabolical in inflicting 
torture than the Arch-ministers of evil themselves?&mdash;would 
not the mandate of the Great Teacher
be done, and not mocked with lying lips and deceitful 
phrases?&mdash;would not the West meet the East with
waggon-loads of abundance?&mdash;would not waste be
uprooted from our hearths, and riot and profligacy
rush dishevelled from our mansions, never to return?&mdash;would 
not the hosts of the united armies of Charity
gird up their loins for the grand crusade of practical
benevolence, and the Queen of all the land lead them
on?</p>

<p>The Downy looked downcast and puzzled. He
gazed at the girl, whose hopes he had fed and entertained 
so delusively; and the honest fellow felt
"beat," as he called it, and at a loss how he could
venture further on a little encouraging chaff and the
assurance that his luck would turn. The fact is, he
didn't quite believe in it himself.</p>

<p>"Blest if my sweet little cheerup that sits hup
aloft," he observed to himself, "ain't dropt clean hoff
his perch. As for myself, it's no pertickler consikenx;
I'm used to it. But ven I've made a gal, like this
vun here, believe as I'm goin' to see her through it,
and things turns hout so howdacious bad, it gets over
me haltogether&mdash;that's wot it does."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

<p>And for want of any resource he began to whistle;
ever and anon stealing a look at his disconsolate
companion, and wishing for various sums, some very
limited, and others sufficiently extensive, as people
are apt to do under similar circumstances. He
thought if he had a pound&mdash;if he had five pounds; he
never had five pounds in one lump in his life. And
strange to say, so simple and generous are some of
the despised poor, this chance acquaintance of his,
this miserable being introduced to poverty by
wretchedness, figured largely in all his schemes of
extravagant expenditure, if he had but the "shiners"
and the "flimsies." He thought of something he
had heard of the National Debt, of the gilt on the
Lord Mayor's coach, and what was its probable worth,
of the plate he had seen through windows in Park-lane 
and elsewhere, where Dives sat at dinner with
his guests late on summer evenings, before the
blinds were drawn down; he thought and thought
and envied, like Sinbad's guest, the porter of Bagdad;
but he might have thought, until all London, present
and future, sank into the grave of buried empires, no
travelled alderman of Cripplegate or Bishopsgate
Within or Without would have asked him to enter
and sit down at his board and entertained him with
food and wine, and with tale and song. The chief
charity and brotherhood of civilisation, like fairyland,
lives only in the fiction which amuses the idle. We
are all so good in our plays and our novels, our poems
and songs&mdash;i.e., our sympathies and feelings are so
catholic, so natural and grand. People sit in a play-house 
and see a representation of Charing Cross

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

covered with snow. There is a dying girl, or a fainting 
boy. Is it possible for well-dressed persons to
pass by and not relieve such misery? Monsters in
human shape! Of course the angelic somebody
comes at length. Let those who have wept over the
mimic scene leave the doors of the theatre and meet
with its reality. Would ninety-nine out of a hundred 
pause, if they saw a fellow-creature lying stiff
and stark on a doorstep? Not they. Where are the
police? Is there not the workhouse? Do they not
pay poor-rates and subscribe to charities? A man
without money is no longer a man, save in song.
The song is as popular as ever, but where is the man
who is reverenced as a man for himself alone?</p>

<p>To return to the Downy. We verily believe that
at that moment he was capable of robbing a bishop in
order to relieve that girl, black-hearted scoundrel and
garotter as he would have been, whom justice would
have sentenced to be flogged with a new cat-o'-nine-tails, 
whilst his agonies would have been gloated
over by men whose whole lives are one series of extortions 
and cruel robberies of poorer men, of widows
and orphans, and beggared outcasts, as they sit in
their prosperity, reading their newspapers at their
breakfast-tables, groaning with the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>Six, seven, and nearly eight o'clock, and no luck
had yet fallen to the Downy's share. The girl sat
still waiting, ever and anon dropping into an uneasy
doze, while the sweeper's besom was still plied with
occasional bursts of vehemence, succeeded by longer
and longer intervals of languor, if not motionless despair. 
At length a tall and good-looking gentleman

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

approached, and pausing half-way across the street,
eyed the Downy with a scrutinising air. When, as
the latter expressed it, he had completed his "portray
for the R'yal Hacademy, size of life and twice as
nattyrel," he appeared satisfied with the scrutiny.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," said he, "I like your appearance. 
You look honest, and I believe you are. I
want you to undertake a little job for me, and you
shall be handsomely rewarded. It is a very simple
matter indeed. It is merely to deliver this note in
Park-street, and to ascertain whether the lady to
whom it is addressed is at home, whether she acts at
the Thespis Theatre to-night; and, if you can, who
has been there to-day. I will furnish you with the
means to drink and treat any one whom you may get
hold of to give you the information I require. The
first part you may ask at the house when you deliver
the note&mdash;I mean as to whether the lady is at home,
and whether she plays this evening; the remainder,
as to whether any guests are dining there, and who
they are, I must leave to your ingenuity. You look
sharp enough. You can meet me at eleven o'clock
exactly opposite the Thespis. Here are five shillings.
I will give you five more when I meet you."</p>

<p>Once more did the Downy fling the "hinwestment"
on the ground, but this time with a very different
feeling.</p>

<p>"And hif I'm axed by any one, ven I'm making
t'other henquiries, who sent me, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As you don't happen to know me," interrupted
the gentleman, "you can't very well tell."</p>

<p>"Exactually," said the Downy. "I suppose I may

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

say it was a short, white-haired party, or a stout,
helderly gent, or the bishop of hanyveres, or a furren
prince? It von't matter, so as I don't discribe the
party as did send me."</p>

<p>The gentleman nodded assent.</p>

<p>"You're just the fellow I wanted," he said. "It
is a matter on which I can't employ any of my own
people."</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied the Downy.</p>

<p>"Now then, be off!" said his employer. "But
wash your hands and face first, like a good fellow,
will you?"</p>

<p>"None of my clubs is in that direxion; but to
oblige you, I'll make free with the pump-'andle. I
jest vant to say a vord to this poor creetur afore
startin'&mdash;her business is pressin'&mdash;shan't be a blessed
minnit. You may depend on me, guv'nor, to be
there in time."</p>

<p>And touching his cap to Arthur Aubrey; for it was
he, looking, however, somewhat changed from what
he was the last time we saw him, the Downy stooped
down over the girl, and, whispering two or three
words of rough and hasty encouragement, put half of
the money he had just received into her hands and
rapidly ran off.</p>

<p>The action was not lost on Aubrey. Approaching
the girl, he soon gathered from her what had passed,
and was greatly struck by the generous conduct of
the Downy. As we shall not meet her again, we may
as well mention that she was made happy for at least
some time to come. Nor had the Downy much cause
to complain of the liberality of his patron. On meeting 

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

him again, and proving that he had well and
faithfully executed his duties, he was presented with
an amount utterly incommensurate with the service
rendered. To use his own language, such treatment
as he received made quite a "feller-creetur" of him.</p>

<p>"Arter all, if honesty ain't the best policy, it's werry
satisfactory to the feelinx to be told yer honest,
hespecial ven vun ain't squared by good fortin in a
gineral pint of view. Sartainly I wosn't brought hup

bad lot. As for this young nob, he's a right-sorted
vun, and I honly hopes as he can afford it. But if
he's spoony on <i>her</i>&mdash;&mdash;" Here the Downy whistled
long and low. "If there's anythink that licks me,"
he continued, "it's the chice sum of these swells
makes of a fancy gal. They wants vun as hall the
rest of the lot is arter. But there's no reconcilin'
their fashins. Hall I can say is that it vouldn't be
the style of courtin' as vould suit the book of the
Honnerabel Downy Cove, Eskvire, if he was a nob.
Not exactually the vay as he'd bestow his young
affexions. But wot can jot hexpect from them poor

the mounseers for their cookin', and drinks winegar

philosophical reflection, "ven I vishes with the mokes

many of 'em a sight of good if they was forced about
vunce a veek to sweep a crossin', and to get hup

of the Lodge, Bedfordbury; that is, ven the funs is
heasy, and a joey ain't no hobject."</p>

<p>And so saying, he betook himself to Clare Market
for a pound of pork-chops, and thence to a public-house 
to cook them, and wound up the evening by
taking the chair at a free-and-easy in a cabman's
night-house, into which, after giving a few specimens
of his convivial talents, he found himself suddenly
voted by universal acclamation.</p>

<p>There he inaugurated the proceedings by proposing
a fine of one halfpenny to the general drinking fund
for every profane oath, which was looked upon as
vastly comical, and carried with great applause. The

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

result at first was highly in favour of morality. But
in spite of the guard which every one endeavoured to
set on his tongue, the accumulation of liquor was so
great, that the chairman was called upon by an
arbitrary exercise of his power to rescind the rule of
the evening. This being done, it was moved by a
distinguished Hansom cabman, who wore moustaches,
and had formerly been an undergraduate of Oxford,
and seconded by a veteran 'bus-driver, a man of
capes, asthma, rheumatism, and experience, that a
fine should be imposed upon any member or stranger
present who should not include an oath in every
sentence he uttered.</p>

<p>We are sorry to record that this new dispensation
barely realised fourpence halfpenny during the whole
remainder of the symposium. And a dispute about
fine number ten resulted in such sparring and bickering, 
both verbal and physical, coupled with language
of such an awful description, that even the Downy,
accustomed as he was to a great deal, got disgusted
and vacated the throne.</p>

<p>"A joke's a joke," he observed to a friend after
retiring, "but this beats the literariest lot as even I
ever heerd on. There's a gent as I've only heerd
speak of, for I never see him, which writes religious
harticles in the newspapers, and they do say is the
hout-and-houtest foul-mouthed vun in London. But
as for most of these cabbies, I should think the werry
hanimals they drive vould be ashamed of their langvidge. 
Vell, harter all, who can vunder? They
never gets a kind vord from no vun; nor ain't believed 

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

It's hard lines to be on the box in all vethers, and
to be treated aforehand as hif you wos livin' by
cheatin', instead of drivin' hall sorts heveryveres."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, young feller," said his
companion, a very quiet and respectable man in his
way, with a large family, and a patch in his great-coat 
for every one of his thirteen children, which
made his upper Benjamin, like Joseph's, a coat of
many colours, though probably rather dingier in hue
and coarser in texture than that of the Israelitish
worthy&mdash;"I'll tell you what it is, there's no knowing
how drivers is put upon by the public. Why, there's
a pal of mine as is summoned reg'lar from the stand
to take up at the Reform Club. There's three
members of Parliament, and one of 'em weighs nigh
upon eighteen stone, if he weighs a farden, as clubs
together to be driven to the House reg'lar for a
shilling. Ain't it enough to make any man swear
when he sees that stout member coming down them
steps, after keeping him within half a minute of the
quarter of an hour a-talking to the other two? And
he calls himself a friend of the people, and says it's
all owing to him that bread is cheaper. But if ever
I see tyranny writ plain on a man's face, it's writ on
hisn. And if some of them have made bread cheaper,
haven't they took it out of us in fares, as if men and
'osses could be found to do it? Swearing, indeed! 1
should like to know who wouldn't swear, if he was
forced to drive them three members close on a mile
for sixpence, and the extra sitter. I know where I'd

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

drive 'em fast enough, if I had the job, as soon as
look at 'em. And what's more, I wouldn't charge
anything for doing of it."</p>

<p>As the cabman with a large family did not name
the locality to which he was willing to drive the stout
member of Parliament and his two friends on such
advantageous terms, we must leave it to the conjectures 
of our readers.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE LITERARY DINER-OUT.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">There is no better passport to Society than ill-nature cleverly expressing 
itself.</p>

<p>THE act of Mr. Stingray, recorded in the previous
chapter, may appear too fantastic in its wickedness.
But are there not individuals, whose very Joviality at
a time when "all man's best feelings" are said to
"possess him," induces them to fling red-hot halfpence 
to mud-larks and beggars, or to distribute
loathsome capsules resembling bonbons to ragged
little children in the street from the window or
balcony of a sumptuous dining-room at Greenwich
or Black wall?</p>

<p>After all, there was nothing so uncommon in Mr.
Stingray's conduct. Doubtless, to pass counterfeit
coin knowingly is criminal enough; yet how many
say, "Well, it was given to me." And these invariably 
select a poor person as most likely to take it,
utterly oblivious or careless of the fact that it may
ruin an innocent fellow-creature in a humble sphere
of life. "It will do for a 'cabby,' " we have heard a
man worth his thousands a-year say of a bad shilling

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

which he had received. "You had better throw that
half-crown away," we have ourselves observed to one
who had just discovered a counterfeit coin in his
change. "Not I, it will do for a cabman; he'll
manage to pass it, I'll warrant," was the answer.</p>

<p>The great satirist chuckled, as he extracted
from a different pocket, before drawing on his clean
white gloves, the well-calculated fare for the cabman, 
who had all the way been nursing great expectations 
from a party who gave half a crown for
fetching his cab. Let us leave him to connect himself 
by inference with some story of the most sentimental 
benevolence in his conversation with the lady
whom he sat next at dinner, no other than the wealthy
Miss Debrett Stumpey,* of whom mention has been
made. Their chief talk was about the spiritual
destitution of Spitalfields. The worthy Archbishop of
Middlesex, whose Notes on the Epicene Creed had,
when a younger man, made such a sensation in the
religious world, was then collecting a large amount
of money for the purpose of building churches in the
poorest district of his diocese. Strange that it never
occurred to the worthy archbishop that the hearers of
Christ were physically fed by Him who preached the
doctrines of charity and love.</p>

<p class="small">[*A reviewer has kindly observed: "What shall we say of sneers
directed at the benevolent and charitable lady whom he describes under
a flimsy disguise&mdash;as Miss Debrett Stumpey?" The lady whom the
reviewer probably means is only known to the author by fame for
deeds of munificent charity and goodness. He could not caricature
her, if he would, simply because he lacks the knowledge and materials,
and certainly would not, if he could. Which, then, is to blame&mdash;author 
or reviewer?]</p>

<p>The miracles of the present day are moral and not

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

physical. It seems miraculous that enlightened
benevolence should remain so completely blind to the
real requirements of the poor.</p>

<p>"What beautiful flowers!" remarked Stingray to
one of his fair neighbours; "yet, does it not seem
almost a barbarity to cull these floral darlings of
nature for a single evening's entertainment?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dote on flowers!" was the young lady's
response. "Were you at the flower-show yesterday?
No! Dear me! We were. The Prince and Princess
were there. To-day is the first of the half-guinea
days."</p>

<p>"I shall wait until it comes down to a shilling,"
said Stingray. "An author can't afford more."</p>

<p>"Oh, you amusing creature!" lisped the young
lady, who was not in her first, nor yet in her second
season.</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to be allowed to use real
flowers on the dinner-table" said Stingray. "We
should encourage the artificial trade, and Rimmel
could scent them, you know."</p>

<p>"How very funny!" said the young lady.
"Mamma," to a lady across the table, "do you
know what Mr. Stingray says? He says that people
ought only to have artificial flowers on the dinner-table, 
because of the artificial flower-makers."</p>

<p>"I thought it was a most unhealthy employment,"
observed a middle-aged gentleman of a vaguely
inquiring turn of mind, who was in the habit of
saying "indeed!" after every answer to a question
that he elicited.</p>

"It depends upon the manufacture." replied Stingray. 

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

"Now, the green used in ladies' dresses is very
deadly both to the maker and wearer."</p>

<p>"Oh, you odious thing, you want to frighten one,"
said the young lady: "but I don't believe there can
be any harm in this beautiful colour."</p>

<p>"Ah," quoth Stingray, who had now got the conversation 
round to the proper point, and obtained his
cue, "I remember once meeting a poor creature
engaged in this sort of work. She was dying fast
of consumption, the result of her efforts to sustain a
dying mother. In the course of my inquiries, I
visited the manufactory and saw the process." (The
old rascal had read it all up in that week's "Lancet.")
"It was like a factory, where the labour was carried
on by ghosts."</p>

<p>And he then launched into an eloquent description
of all that he had read that morning, considerably
embroidered for the occasion.</p>

<p>"And the young girl whom you relieved?" asked
the inquiring gentleman, "what became of her?"</p>

<p>"I did not say that <i>I</i> relieved her; I am not rich
enough to indulge in such delightful caprices."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Stingray, how can you say so?" observed 
the young lady next him. "We know better.
But tell us about the poor girl."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;that is, I mean, some friends of mine&mdash;got
her into Brompton Hospital; but it was too late,"
said Stingray.</p>

<p>"How charming of you!" was the ladies' chorus.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" rejoined Stingray, "you don't
think I did such a thing; you don't know what a
hard-hearted, unfeeling old fellow I am!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

<p>And they certainly did not, although more than
one guest at the table had formed a by no means
flattering estimate of his character. But the idle,
empty, gossiping, and contemptible part of the world,
as well as a great many who took what others said
for granted, deemed Mr. Stingray to be a man of the
finest feeling and most gushing benevolence.</p>

<p>"That dear Sting," they said, "what a noble
creature, eccentric and severe in his satire; but such
a heart!"</p>

<p>Thus the world deceives and is deceived, ever mistaking 
self-assertion for merit, and unscrupulousness
for power.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Chalkstoneville's on Tuesday?"
asked Mr. Stingray of Miss Debrett Stumpey.</p>

<p>Oh, the dear old duke&mdash;yes, I would not miss it
for anything; besides, one meets everybody who is
anybody there."</p>

<p>"Then I shall meet you," said Stingray.</p>

<p>"How can you find time to write all your dear
delightful books," said the lady, "and go out as you
do?"</p>

<p>"It is part of my vocation," replied the great
writer. "I pick up materials, you know. If, for
instance, I want a model of magnificent Charity, am
I not fortunate if I can gaze on the very lineaments
of her expressive face, and hear with my own ears
those silvery accents, which have carried comfort,
and especially spiritual requirements, to the homes of
so many?"</p>

<p>The lady blushed even a deeper yellow than her
wonted hue, and smiled a wealthy smile on the audacious 

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

flatterer, who paused to give his sally due
effect.</p>

<p>"They do say," she rejoined, "that you are so
naughty as to caricature all your friends in your
wicked, delightful, charming novels."</p>

<p>"At any rate, I do not caricature those whom I
honour and revere, dear Miss Debrett Stumpey,"
said Stingray, in the most insinuating accents he
could muster, which greatly resembled, we should
imagine, the tones of the frog who "would a-wooing
go." "And I have met one, ere now," he continued,
"whose virtues it would be as impossible to portray,
even in earnest, as to do them sufficient justice in
one's heart."</p>

<p>And the monster actually pressed his serviette, as
if involuntarily, over the exact spot where his watch
was tick, ticking, and recording on its honest dial
the moments which were insensibly bringing him
nearer and nearer to the verge of his hypocritical
career.</p>

<p>"But I own," he said, "I am tempted, <i>entre nous</i>
now and then to pin a few real beetles, wasps, and
butterflies for my museum."</p>

<p>"I declare, you dreadful creature, I feel quite
afraid of you," said the young lady on the other side,
who overheard this last sentence uttered in rather
a louder tone than Mr. Stingray's immediately previous 
remarks. "Are you not sometimes afraid lest
the wasps should sting you in turn?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray slightly frowned. The fact is he had
a few days before received some very severe personal
affronts from a clever young journalist and author,

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

in retaliation for an outrage of the most heinous kind.
He had by no means the hide of a rhinoceros, so far
as his own feelings were concerned; and like some
political bullies of the present day, could not endure
even the slightest criticism on his own character,
conduct, or motives.</p>

<p>"My sweet young friend," he whispered to the
young lady, "if I could catch you in my net, I would
not injure the delicate texture of your beautiful wings
for a thousand a-year. I spoke of butterflies, and not
Peris, you know."</p>

<p>As he often dined with that young lady's father,
we will not question his truth.</p>

<p>"But only fancy, my dear Miss Stumpey, what
temptation one is sometimes subjected to! This
morning I had a visit from Mr. Snobbington. I
dare say you have seen him; drives a gorgeous
curricle in the Park. What do you think he came
for?"</p>

<p>"Really," answered Miss Stumpey, "I cannot
imagine. A subscription, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pas si b&ecirc;te!</i> Only an invitation to Chalkstoneville's 
next grand ball."</p>

<p>"What impertinence!" cried the lady. "And
what did you say?"</p>

<p>"The fellow will expect me to bring him to a
reception at Debrett House next," said Stingray, with
admirable flattery.</p>

<p>"Do tell me what you answered. I am dying to
know," rejoined Miss Stumpey.</p>

<p>"I told him that I would on one condition. But
you'll be shocked, if I tell you what it was."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

<p>"Nonsense," rejoined Miss Stumpey; "do, do tell
me, there's a good creature."</p>

<p>"I counselled him to commit a dreadful crime as
the price of acceding to his request," said Stingray,
gravely.</p>

<p>"A crime! What can you mean, you dear, delightful 
thing?" cried Miss Stumpey.</p>

<p>"Yes, a crime," returned Stingray; "one so
dreadful that the ancient Romans excluded it from
the programme of possibility in their code of punishments."</p>

<p>"I declare you quite frighten me," said the lady.
"I don't know that I shall allow you to go on."</p>

<p>"You must know that the fellow has a father, as
most of us have, or have had," pursued Stingray.</p>

<p>Miss Stumpey bowed her acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Well!" she said.</p>

<p>"No! It is not well; that's just the point," said
Stingray. "It's ill enough with him. Fancy having
a living progenitor who is a large general dealer in
Houndsditch, supplies half the paper mills in England
with rags!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so! How dreadful!" was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"It's a sad thing for poor Snob," continued Stingray, 
who inwardly wished that he had such a father
to supply him with luxuries. "But he couldn't
help it, you know. Only, why should he want to
know us?"</p>

<p>"Ah! why indeed!" quoth Miss Stumpey. "But
people never do know what is good for them."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

<p>"Well," said Stingray, "I said to him, 'This is the
ambition of your life, is it not; to have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of
Chalkstoneville House?' 'I'd do anything to obtain
it,' he replied. 'Then,' said I, 'nothing is easier.
Murder your father! If undiscovered, so much the
better. That will amazingly simplify the affair.
Should, however, the parricide be discovered, consider 
the <i>&eacute;clat</i> you will gain. You can furnish bail
in any amount out of the old boy's coffers, on condition 
that when you surrender, your friends who are
bail for you can keep the amounts you have furnished
them for the occasion&mdash;&mdash;' "</p>

<p>"But, excuse me,? interrupted Miss Stumpey, "I
thought murder was not a bailable offence."</p>

<p>"No more it is," replied Stingray, "but what
of that? Well, I proceeded to tell Snobbington that
if he did this, he would be quite a lion, and that no
party at Chalkstoneville House should be considered
complete without him, before trial, and that after
trial and execution, he should be as near as possible
to George the Fourth's effigy and coronation robes at
Madame Tussaud's."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Miss Stumpey; "and
did you really say all this?"</p>

"Did I not?" was the answer. "And, what is
more, I really thought at first he was almost tempted
by the grandeur of the reward to undertake a more
than Roman action. If he had, what genius could have
celebrated the deed? Macaulay would be quite unequal
to the task. I am not so sure about Bon Gaultier."</p>

<p>"How absurd! you ridiculous man!" said Miss

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

Stumpey, hardly knowing whether to take it in
earnest or not. "You don't mean to say that the
man really thought of murdering his father?"</p>

<p>"Don't I?" replied Stingray. "Depend upon it,
he would have annihilated the old rag-picker to get
an invitation to our dear duke's parties, could he
have done so safely. And he would disown his
mother, too, to get invited by you."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, I shall never tempt
him. It's astonishing what these low people will do,
is it not, Mr. Stingray?"</p>

<p>That gentleman answered that it undoubtedly was;
and he cited some rare instances of toadyism; but
forbore to mention his own performances in this line,
we may be sure.</p>

<p>They then talked about Patti, and Turner's pictures, 
and croquet, and the last Horticultural F&ecirc;te.
Miss Stumpey imparted the information that there
was but one frame-maker in England who could
make a frame for a Turner. As we do not intend to
advertise a single tradesman in these volumes, we
shall not give the name of the inspired artist in
frames, who had so successfully imposed upon Miss
Stumpey's credulity, or been so fortunate as to inspire
a whim in that wealthy virgin's head. Why should
not Miss Stumpey talk nonsense about the pictures
which she purchased? It is a wonderful thing to
hear wealth prattle about high art; but possibly not
so instructive to record it, as it would be difficult.
Perhaps, after all, your great Manchester manufacturer 
is the least objectionable patron of art. He
buys his pictures from accredited middlemen, like the

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

illustrious Flake of Wardour-street, who tells you,
"S'elp, me&mdash;that 'ere is the best bit of stuff Danby
ever painted," or the great Pasticcio, who was a
courier, and farms rising artists. He only states
the price that he gave, and then shows you the
certificate of the picture's authenticity. To him a
Stanfield is a Stan Held, and nothing more. He does
not affect to criticise. His admiring friends are
spared at least that ordeal.</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray was dining with the editor of a
powerful literary journal&mdash;one of the most insufferable 
coxcombs and humbugs of his country and
period&mdash;who wore a cloak with a pose, as if he were
a bad style of statue descended from a supposititious
pedestal; and who walked down the Strand as if his
aim were to strike the top of his unpleasant cranium
against an imaginary ceiling at every step. This
man, by some inconceivable freak of fortune, had got
his round, undistinguished person thrust into a distinguished 
square hole, as one of the intellectual
sign-posts of the age. He probably did more to
check genius and choke merit, while fostering pretence
and mediocrity, than any other loud-voiced vulgar
charlatan of his day. His vanity and malignity were
well known and widely appreciated, but still he sat
in judgment, and could make or mar a reputation.
The ponderous dulness of his organ crushed with
elephantine weight the struggling wretch against
whom the tyrant directed its malignant fury. Like
the elephant, he never forgot the smallest provocation
or offence. But unhappily it was not always necessary 
to offend him, to draw on you the full weight of

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

his malice. If you were poor or unknown, or had
not been recommended to him; if you were truthful
or earnest&mdash;nay, if you were original&mdash;it was enough
to excite his wrath and provoke his instinctive condemnation. 
On the other hand, the shallowest
"priggism" was sure to find in him a patron and a
friend. The verdict of the "Centipede" was a Hall
Mark. Never mind if it passed fraud current,
branded an honest man with ignominy, or destroyed
a Keats. If some unfortunate victim appealed to
a law court against a more monstrous act of injustice
than usual, his own counsel would throw up his brief
with a hypocritical appeal to respectability, and the
judge would compliment him. A British jury believes
in a paper with twenty-four pages of advertisements.
No amount of fact as to the particular assassination
in question could disturb their minds. They would
as soon convict of kleptomania a bishop with twenty
thousand pounds a-year, and as many aristocratical witnesses 
to character as would furnish an Anti-Reform
Demonstration reaching from the Carlton to Apsley
House. If the journal said a man's French or Latin
was bad, it was bad. No matter whether he were a
teacher of languages or not, <i>doctus utriusque lingu&oelig;</i>.
No matter what errors its own writers made in their
"&aelig;sthetic" twaddlings or "esoteric" strainings after
fine writing. A Corsican vendetta was nothing to
the resentments of this cynical and finical print,
which would stab and poison to the fifteenth cousinship 
of a chronic feud. Sometimes a base instinct
and a coarse judgment would alone suffice to dictate
a "slashing cut up." There were two or three men

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

of intellect connected with it; but they were well paid,
and sealed the bond, which delivered them up body
and soul to the guidance of the man in the cloak,
mask, and poniard. The "Satirist" in its worst days
never inflicted a tithe of the real mischief done by
this arbiter of literary taste. For whose existence
did it embitter&mdash;whose hopes did it shatter&mdash;whose
steps did its bravoes and bloodhounds track to the
grave? The struggling, friendless author, the earnest
writer and poet, the man who either could not or
would not scribble in its grooves, or bow down before
the idol which it had set up. If the literary Gregory
did not levy black-mail, his prosperity demanded its
victims, and pursued them as unscrupulously. To
blast an author's reputation basely and unfairly is
surely as prejudicial to Society as to threaten to calumniate 
the domestic relations of a duke. Nor was
any expedient too small and too vile to accomplish
the purpose in hand. Misquotation was a common
mode of attack. Who cared for the author's indignant 
denial if, which was not always the case, he
could get it inserted in another journal? He was
only set down as some poor disappointed wretch
smarting under an adverse criticism. "Criticism!"
One smiles bitterly at the name. It meant in those
columns an atrocious conspiracy or a panegyrical job.</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray stood well with this individual. They
were flamens of the same unholy temple, priests of
the same Juggernaut. They both studied the religion
of prosperity, the piety of success.</p>

<p>"Capital affair!" observed Mr. Hugag Thugly,
the gentleman in question, to Mr. Stingray across

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

the table, "that of the Honourable Captain Helshot
in the Pacific!"</p>

<p>"Didn't notice it particularly," was the reply.
"What was it? Shelled a nest of pirates, or something 
of that kind?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a capital sketch of it in the
'Illustrious,' done by young Fussell of the <i>Devastator</i>, 
on the spot."</p>

<p>"Indeed! What was it about?" inquired the
mild and vaguely informed gentleman whom we
mentioned just now.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Mr. Hugag, "we had a
squadron there, the same which had been so long
cruising during the war in search of the Russians,
who kept so wonderfully out of their way, when a
British missionary came on board the <i>Devastator</i>,
and represented that he had received some insult
from a petty chief in one of the Friendly Isles. I
think the natives objected to his efforts to Christianise
the chiefs youngest daughter, or something of that
kind. Of course the thing was not to be tolerated.
So Helshot went in and shelled half a dozen villages,
and the missionary stood on the paddle-box and
assisted in guiding the vessel up the creeks. The
natives threw javelins from their canoes, but they all
fell short, and then the missionary went below, and
the steamer ran them down like fun."</p>

<p>"<i> Ὥστε θύννους</i>," put in Stingray, who had received
a college education.</p>

<p>"Just so," replied Mr. Hugag, who thought it
was a nautical phrase in which Stingray had indulged, 
relating to the tonnage of the vessel employed. 

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

"They killed fifteen hundred men, women,
and children of these piratical cannibals; but the missionary 
nobly saved the life of one little girl, whom a
midshipman pulled out of the water, and christened
her on the spot after Her Most Gracious Majesty.
He has brought little Victoria to England, and placed
her at an orphan school&mdash;charming trait, was it
not?"</p>

<p>"That man ought to be made a bishop," observed
Miss Stumpey.</p>

<p>"You have only to say so," said Stingray, "and
the thing is done."</p>

<p>"But is there any evidence that these people are
pirates and cannibals?" asked the mild gentleman.</p>

<p>"I should think there was," said Mr. Hugag.
"They roast hogs entire in holes dug in the ground,
and bake them with red-hot stones. You may depend
upon it that wretches who do this would not be very
particular if they had the opportunity."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the mild gentleman, "I don't quite
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it our people knew what
they were about. It is this sort of doubt and sickly
sentimentality which leads to so much mischief."</p>

<p>"But how came Captain Helshot, who, I see, is
made an admiral and has got the Cross of the Bath,
to let the Russians slip from between his fingers as
he did?" inquired another of the party.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said a young gentleman who had
shown some symptoms of impatience during the conversation, 
"the Russian javelins don't fall short&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The look which the two despots of the dinner-table 

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

levelled at that daring youth did not fall short.
Nothing abashed, however, he returned to the charge.</p>

<p>"It appears," he said, "that the missionary had
resided there three years, and been well and even
kindly treated. I don't quite understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think you do, sir," interrupted Mr.
Hugag. It is quite a mistake to suppose that rudeness 
is not an element in modern polite conversation.
"I rather imagine," he continued, in a voice which
utterly precluded any other from making itself heard,
"that the Spanish difficulty is nearing a happy solution."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the vague gentleman. "I should
have thought that something would have been done,
considering what England has submitted to."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the indignant youth, who had not the
fear of the "Centipede" and literary assassination
before his eyes, "I don't know what we shall submit
to next. Our ships fired into, our people imprisoned,
our Church forbidden and anathematised, and the
graves of Protestants desecrated, and dead bodies
actually flung into the river&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After what we did for them," said the vague
gentleman; "first in driving the French out, and
then expelling Don Carlos&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A most unlawful act," interposed the irreverent
young man.</p>

<p>"And putting their present queen on the throne,"
said the vague gentleman.</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it," observed Hugag, "that
Lord Yieldingham knows what he is about. He said in
the House the other night that it was not in accordance 

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

either with the feelings or wishes of the British
Government, or those of our illustrious ally, to interfere 
with the internal regulations of Spain, especially
those relating to so delicate a matter as religion; and
in relation to the alleged attacks upon British ships,
he had ascertained that the vessels were within three
miles of the Spanish coast, and that it had been represented 
to him that the Spanish Admiral, Rascaillos, 
under whose orders the ships had been fired
upon, was extremely short-sighted. As to the crews,
they had the ordinary Spanish legal mode at their
disposal for obtaining liberty and redress."</p>

<p>The vague gentleman shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't quite see," he said, "why France should
dictate terms to us."</p>

<p>"I consider it a most fortunate thing," was the
remark of Mr. Hugag. "The Emperor is one of the
most enlightened men of the age. He is devoted to
England, sir. I was one of the late deputation which
had the honour of waiting upon him. Nothing could
be more flattering than our&mdash;I may say, my reception. 
The Emperor inquired after Mrs. Hugag, and
of the services which, he was pleased to say, I had
rendered to France and to civilisation by assisting the
French representative, M. Vaurien, during the Great
Exhibition of 1851. That man, sir, is the glory of
the age."</p>

<p>"Well," said the vague gentleman, "I don't quite
see it&mdash;that is, I should like England to be better
prepared&mdash;I mean her navy and all that."</p>

<p>"Pooh-pooh!" said Stingray; "our defence is our
increased market for French goods. What did Mr.

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

Sowerface say to his constituents the other day?
'Let every English labourer and mechanic consume his
pint of <i>vin ordinaire</i> a day, a consummation which I
devoutly hope to see realised, and war will become
impossible.' And so it will."</p>

<p>"We have happily put down duelling," said Mr.
Hugag, "and shall ultimately make war, which is
merely duelling on a larger scale, impracticable. As
that great man, Mr. Chimpanzee, said the other day
in reply to a letter addressed to him by his brother
Moses, of Ogreton, another great European war is
simply an impossibility&mdash;as impossible as a war on
the North American Continent, where there is a
standing army of only nine thousand men."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" shouted Stingray; "not much danger
there, I should think."</p>

<p>"But I don't see that France is disarming," interposed 
the reckless young man.</p>

<p>"That will come, sir," said Mr. Hugag, authoritatively. 
"The Emperor has privately intimated as
much to Mr. Chimpanzee, with whom he has been
frequently closeted of late. All that France wants
is coal and iron&mdash;steam-coal to develop her mercantile
marine, and steel for fancy articles and scissors."</p>

<p>"Scissors!" exclaimed the vague gentleman. "Indeed! 
How very odd! To think that the <i>entente
cordiale</i> should depend upon scissors and sour wine!
I should have thought&mdash;&mdash; But I wish that Mr.
Chimpanzee would take the opportunity to say something 
about Cayenne."</p>

<p>"A mere penal settlement for the brigands who
would disturb the public peace," said Mr. Hugag,

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

authoritatively. "Portland Island with alligators,
nothing more."</p>

<p>"Why should not every country have a similar
penal settlement?" asked Stingray. "I wish we were
as sensible. It would be a wholesome check upon our
predatory classes. Our system is far too expensive."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" cried the younger disputant;
"would you defend that horrible tyranny?"</p>

<p>"I defend the cause of order, sir," said Mr. Hugag;
"and if Cayenne assists to maintain order, I don't
see what it has to do with us. We are bound, if anything, 
to sympathise with our illustrious ally."</p>

<p>"No such crocodile sympathies for me," said the
incorrigible young man. "And I can't see why we
should interfere to massacre a set of poor, weak,
ignorant natives in the Pacific, and endure these outrages 
at the hands of stronger states. Why should
we not have shelled Cadiz or Malaga on the same
principle? I think that the British Government is
far more short-sighted than the Spanish admiral.
And I believe we shall all be obliged, before very long,
to arm in defence of our own liberties, property, and
lives."</p>

<p>"Absurd!" said Mr. Stingray.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" added Mr. Hugag. "Depend upon
it, England will never arm again."</p>

<p>"Then she will lose her colonies, and sink to the
condition of a fifth-rate power."</p>

<p>"She is better without her colonies," said Mr.
Hugag.</p>

<p>"She will become the industrial workshop of the
universe," said Mr. Stingray.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

<p>"She will become an island of emasculated chimpanzees," 
said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I really must say," said the vague gentleman, 
"that these doctrines are new to me, and, if
I might hazard a remark, it would be to the effect
that if the agricultural interest is destroyed, and the
manufacturing interest is dependent on the will of
our armed friends, I apprehend that the latter might
decline under the effects of a hostile competition, and
we should no longer be able to continue to purchase
food supplies, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coffee, gentlemen," said the butler, saving England 
by his opportune entrance from her fate.</p>

<p>"Rank protection!" growled Mr. Hugag.</p>

<p>"Obsolete twaddle!" sneered Mr. Stingray.</p>

<p>"I must put a black mark against this young
springald's name," muttered Mr. Hugag, fumbling
for his note-book. "He will be publishing a pamphlet 
one of these days, or a volume of poetry entitled 
'The Sword and the Lyre,' or some such rubbish, 
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The critical assassin grimly smiled; he was already 
misquoting his late antagonist by anticipation,
like an expectant cannibal gloating over a promised
repast.</p>

"IT was a doosid select thing, I can tell you,
Snob," said Cornet Swellingham to Mr. Sidney
Snobbington "of that ilk," which meant a villa at
Clapham Rise and part of a small house in Piccadilly, 
as the pair were breakfasting together one
morning in the latter locality. "And doosid slow,
too," he drawled, after a yawn. "Thought you were
to be there?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

<p>"No," said the other, "went to the Opera instead.
A fellah can't be everywhere, you know."</p>

<p>"Come now, no lies with me, Snob, old fellah.
You know you would have given your eyes to be
invited. I thought Sting was to have done the
needful for you?"</p>

<p>"Not he," replied the other. "Not but what
he's prwomised often enough. I will say, that when
you say a thing, you do it; the difficulty is to get you
to prwomise."</p>

<p>"You should not ask too much. Snob," said Mr.
Swellingham. "I'm always open to anything in
rweason. Have you seen Aubrway himself lately?"</p>

<p>"Saw him in the Park yesterday, driving splendid
crweechure," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Gwacious! What, one horse! Not a gig?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Mr. Snobbington. "I mean a
woman."</p>

<p>"Not his wife?" asked Swellingham.</p>

<p>"Should say not," replied the other, "unless the
fellah has two."</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," said Mr. Swellingham, "that puts
me in mind. I heard Stingway say, last Thursday,
in the Park, when Lord Fitznoodle drove by in
his curwicle with Mrs. Bouncer as his side, that it
was rank bigamy, and two fellahs from Oxford seemed
awfully amused. Can't see it, can you?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do," answered Mr. Snobbington.
"Fitznoodle is a widower, and he hasn't marwied
Mrs. Bouncer."</p>

<p>"These clayver fellahs," continued Swellingham,
with an air of reflection, "are like the judges in the

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

law courts. They say the stoopidest things, and the
barwisters immediately laugh, and then all the attorneys, 
until the whole Court joins, including the very
usher, except the parties to the suit, you know; and
when they've all exhausted themselves, the judge
cries 'Order!' himself, like a blessed old hypocritical
Punch. But, I say, isn't this fellah Aubrway going
the pace a few?"</p>

<p>"Well, I must say," said Snobbington, "I think
it is very bad taste not to keep things a little darker.
He needn't pay such open and undisguised attention
to other women, and drive them in the Park. I'm
no moralist, but there are two ways of doing everything. 
I really feel very much for his wife."</p>

<p>"Why, what next?" said his friend. "Are you
coming out in the sentimental line? What would
Stingway say?"</p>

<p>"He may say what he likes," returned Mr. Snobbington, 
"but she is a splendid crweechure, and I
should like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To console her, doubtless," interrupted the other.
"Well, why don't you try? But I hear that her
sight is going. You had better make haste, or your
manly attractions will be lost upon her."</p>

<p>"Now, don't chaff a fellah," rejoined Mr. Snobbington, 
"but intrwoduce me, as you prwomised."</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;I? Do you mean to say that I promised 
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you did nearly," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Hem!" said Swellingham. "You see the thing
is not easy. Their house is so small, and they know
so many good people, they can afford to be so very

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

exclusive. But I'll try one of these days. In the
mean time, Snob, you must let me have that money I
spoke about, I tell you. The fact is, I can't do
without it."</p>

<p>Let us pause to describe these worthies. In the
first place, they were about the same age, some thirty
years. Swellingham was tall, dark, and decidedly
aristocratic. Snobbington was fair, florid, and by no
means unprepossessing. Although their circumstances
were very unlike, their habits were similar, for this
reason, that Snobbington endeavoured to imitate
Swellingham in everything that he did. They lived
together in chambers in the same house in Piccadilly, 
and as their alliance was mutually convenient
and desirable to both, we need express no wonder at
its oddity. It was shrewdly suspected that Snob,
as he was called for the sake of brevity, paid "Swell
Fits'," which was Swellingham's nickname, share of
the rent as well as his own, and that he lent him
money, and was generally conducive to his comfort
and luxury in this world. For Fits was the fifth
son of a selfish old baronet of the clubs and coulisses,
and had very little besides his pay as cornet in the
Third Blues upon which to live on the very best of
everything the world could afford; and Snob was
the only son of a wealthy tradesman, whose calling
he, Snob, fondly trusted that nobody knew. Like
Sir Piercie Shafton, Snob was a plucky fellow, and
accomplished in the science of small arms; and therefore 
no one ventured plainly to allude to his origin
in his presence, although indirectly and obscurely he
was greatly chaffed and ridiculed, on account of his

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

absurd proclivities and mania for being considered
an appurtenance of the haut ton of London. There
was, however, one man who roasted him openly
without the slightest reticence or remorse, and this
man poor Snob reverenced and feared to a childish
extent. This arbiter of his fate and happiness was
Mr. Stingray, who, for his own reasons, however,
allowed him to exist, but in a state of constant
torture. It suited Stingray to keep him alive; but
constantly impaled, as an ardent entomologist would a
gilded beetle, or a butterfly, a Coleopterus metropolitanus 
magnificus, or a Camberwell beauty, as the case
might be. After all, Snob was not half so bad as
Stingray himself in doing "kotoo" to those above
him in social rank, but the manner was different.
Poor Snob's propensities were so undisguised and
open, a child might have read him, whereas Stingray
affected to hate and despise the gods, before whom in
secret he bowed down, and whose worship was the
chief object of his life. As for Fits, he allowed Snob
to imitate him in everything, save dress; and in his
objection to this he was absolute. "No, Snob, my
boy," he would say, "I don't mind riding your
horses, or going anywhere with you; and as for
Pond, my sufferer, he may make your clothes, and you
can pay him for both, but you shan't wear the same
things as myself at the same time." For the rest,
Fits never quizzed his friend openly in public, nor,
to his credit be it said, did he allow him to be ridiculed 
behind his back. With all the folly, and
laxity, and absurdity, and, must we say so, dissipation 
and profligacy in which the pair indulged,

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

they had both redeeming traits of character. They
were neither cowards nor cold-blooded seducers, neither
blacklegs nor hypocrites. They were men of fashion
of the period, spoilt by the period, aping all the fantastic 
and frivolous manners of their age; and even
sometimes superficially, from mere want of head, or
head training, imitating superficially and exoterically
the heartless and libertine expression of a vicious
habit of thought and conduct. Let us add, that Fits
actually talked like the men of his class in "Punch,"
and that Snob did his best to excel his patron; and
that the latter had a permanent <i>liaison</i> with a very
pretty, and otherwise well-conducted, but uneducated
young woman, who had been a housemaid in his
father's establishment, and by whom he had already
four or five children. This was an affair that Snob
kept quite in the dark. Not, we blush to record it,
that he was ashamed of its immorality, far from it.
The fact is, it was scarcely immoral enough; and the
girl's antecedents (she was still young) were not
such as Snob felt socially proud of, whilst he would
not have been seen in Bond-street with his small
family for a trifle. But there were stories and
legends current, like that of the appearance of the
sea-serpent, of Snob being seen by one or other of
his fast friends driving down to Snaresbrook, or some
such retreat, on Sunday, with a string of merry little
creatures holding on to his coat-tails, and a young
creature all curls and smiles proudly hanging on to
his arm. Nay, there was a story of his being seen in
the act of propelling a perambulator, a double one,
trebly occupied, in a very out-of-the-way part of the

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

suburbs. But, as one story founded on fact sometimes 
begets a young family of myths, we will not
vouch for the truth of that humiliating narrative.</p>

<p>For some time after Swellingham's announcement, 
the pair puffed their cigars, which they had
just lit.</p>

<p>"Who is it," inquired Snob, as we shall call him
for the sake of brevity, "that Aubrway is running
after now?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied his friend, "that girl who has just
come out at the Thespis, and plays such tricks with
the manager and the rest of them."</p>

<p>"What Dareall?"</p>

<p>"Yaas!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"And the best part of the joke is, that she can't
endure the sight of the fellah, and is pawsitively
helping to wuin him out of sheer contempt," said
Fits.</p>

<p>"I heard yesterday that Aubrway is nearly cleaned
out," rejoined Snob.</p>

<p>"I should think he is," was the reply. "Levy
Moss told me last night that he has got lots of
his paper, and don't mean to renew a single
oblong."</p>

<p>"And to think that his parties should be among
the best in London. It says in the 'Post' here, that
there were three dukes, and let me see, nine peers
there in that little place of theirs at their last night's
'th&eacute;.' Do, my dear Swellingham, try and get me a
card for their Sunday nights, if you can. See about
it while there is time, my dear fellah!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

<p>"Quite impawsible!" was the answer of Fits, delivered 
with a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"And Levy Moss won't renew his bills. What a
shockingly unequal world we live in!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! so I say," cried his friend. "Why
haven't I half your money? I could spare you a very
decent aristocratic connexion in return. Come, come,
I dine there to-morrow, and I'll do what I can for
you. But it stwikes me that Levy Moss is your
man."</p>

<p>"Levy Moss," cried Snob. "Why he doesn't visit
there surely?"</p>

<p>"No!" quoth Fits; "but he soon will. You can
follow the sherwiff's officers when they take possession. 
Stingway says he dines there in constant expectation 
of seeing them come in, like the man who
always went to Van Amburgh's performances in the
hope of seeing him devoured by the wild beasts. Poor
Aubrway! Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! pore Aubrway," echoed Snob; "but
do get me a card, before it is too late."</p>

<p>"Get me that two hundred, and I'll do the best I
can," returned his friend. "But you see when a fellah,
or a fellah's father has been in a wetail trwade, it is
veway difficult to take him anywhere, that is, where
any one goes. It would be far easier if you were a
needy nobleman, suspected of having poisoned your
own nieces for their money, especially if you'd got it,
I should say. Talking of poisoning, it wouldn't so
much matter if you were a brwewer. Society is
doosid odd. It don't mind brwewers and bankers,
and people in the coal-line, if they're only in a sufficiently 

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

large way of business. A brute of an ironmaster 
will pass muster, where a brassfounder or a
tinman stands no chance. I must say I can't see
why brwewing beer should be thought more corrwect
than baking brwead, or killing sheep. Why wasn't
your governor a brwewer, my dear Snob, instead
of a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! my dear fellah!" interrupted Snob. "I
wish you would be more cautious."</p>

"There's no one within hearing," said Fits. "I
wish you would afford me some prwetext besides
mere money. If you were an amateur artist, for
example, or belonged to the 'Melodious Vagrants,' or
could assist in charwades, or cut out paper figures.
You don't even bet! Can't you manage to lose a few
ponies to Lord Sevensthemayne or Colonel Nobbleham! 
But I'll see what's to be done, and you must
let me have fifty out of the two hundred down now."</p>

<p>Neither shabbiness nor thrift were among Snob's
failings. He really liked Swellingham; partly because 
he was proud of knowing him, and being allowed
to call him by his baptismal name, or its abbreviation
Fits, and partly because Swellingham was a man
any one might have liked, when divested of his
outward affectation and nonsense. As for Snob
altogether, his heart was right enough, when he was
not intent upon imitating Swellingham's worst absurdities 
and peculiarities, and especially his pretended 
libertinism and worldliness. These two men
were mere puppets of the period, creatures of the era
in which they lived. It was the fashion to appear
selfish and heartless, and they sought to be no better

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

than their superiors. Had it been the rage to visit
hospitals and attend soir&eacute;es at Bedlam and Colney
Hatch, they would probably have done it with the
utmost vigour and delight. You can't blame a man,
who is born in the nineteenth century, if in some
degree he comports himself accordingly. If he does
not, he is pretty sure to come to grief, or at least is
not likely to be a successful personage, a "man of the
time." Suppose that a man speaks the truth in Parliament, 
such truth as every one feels, but judges it
inconvenient to say aloud, what is his fate? He is
extinguished by clamour, and becomes the butt of the
House. If you brand a great and powerful man in
public with the infamy for which he is notorious, in
that second world of modern daily life, the world of
conversational masonry in which truth is occasionally
spoken&mdash;what is your fate? It would seem as if the
crimes of the denouncee infected you, the denouncer.
The mischief lies in the publication of such things.
They may be as notorious as Scandal can make them,
only Libel must beware. This is the safe-guard of
every prosperous sinner, whose vices are undivulged
before any public tribunal, and only furnish pleasant
small-talk at the clubs and private dinner-tables of
men. But human nature is not so universally bad
after all; and there is a good deal of sterling virtue
about, which might assert itself, if men were not
ashamed of it, and if it were not old-fashioned, inconvenient, 
and absurd.</p>

<p>When Cervantes ridiculed the extreme follies and
excesses of chivalry, he doubtless did not anticipate
an epoch of lawyers, when the unselfish assertion and

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

maintenance of all truth and honour, and the unpaid
rescue of all innocence and virtue should be termed
"Quixotism," and dealt with like the aberrations
of La Mancha's knight. Had he done so, he would
possibly have preserved the memoirs of Amadis and
Don Galaor, and burnt, in the interests of posterity,
the lucubrations of Cide Hamete Benengeli in their
stead.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">MATRIMONIAL NEGLECT.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">There is no cruelty greater than that of a heartless woman towards
a man who adores her, but for whom she has no regard, save that of
your "man of feeling" towards a woman whom he is forced to live
with, when his affections have grown slack.&mdash;<i>From the Note-book of
the late Solomon Trustall, LL.D</i>.</p>

<p>IT was noon in Queen's-square. The domestics of
the Aubrey family had been astir some two or three
hours. The great Binsby had aired himself on the
clean door-steps, and taken in a whiff of fresh air,
and a drink of the glorious sunshine of a fine morning, 
and then retired with dignified seriousness to the
discharge of his daily duties. Tops, the groom, had
called for orders, but hearing that "master" had
sent a note to "missus" the previous evening, and
had not returned home all night, profited by the
opportunity to remain below, and endeavour to obtain
an interview for the purposes of courtship with Mrs.
Susan, the lady's-maid. Blanche Aubrey, tired and
anxious, had not yet made her appearance. In due
time, Mrs. Susan came down, and Mr. Tops, under
the pretence of asking if her mistress would want the

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

carriage, which he knew perfectly well she would not,
followed her into the drawing-room, where the following 
conversation took place:</p>

<p>"Now stop a minute, do, can't yer? What's the
hurry?" quoth Mr. Tops. "Wait till the bell rings.
You air such a bolter, you air. Never quiet a
minute, like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, that will do," replied Mrs. Susan. "I
don't want any of your comparisons to brute animals,
if you please. Besides" (tossing her head), "I'm not
yet in harness, you see; no, nor likely to be for that
matter, neither."</p>

<p>"Now, don't say that, Susan, when you've promised
me so often."</p>

<p>"Promises, Mr. Tops, are nothing on a lady's part
before marriage, as they don't seem to be on the side
of your treacherous sex after. I wonder you can
have the impudence to ask me, considering how your
master goes on. I couldn't expect you to behave
decently with such an example."</p>

<p>"Masters," returned Tops, oracularly, "is one
thing, and grooms is another, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope for the sake of the poor deluded creatures
who marry them, that they are," said Susan; "but
I'm not disposed to make the trial. But is your
precious master ever coming home? Wherever is he
got to?"</p>

<p>"You see, my dear," replied the knight of the
curry-comb, "a man must be somewheres. The governor 
is hout hall night, and hain't said where he is?
Well, as he hain't ere, he must be there."</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Susan.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

<p>"Why somewheres else, of course," was Mr. Tops's
unsatisfactory answer.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> know where he is," said Susan, "well
enough. Cannot you give a plain answer to a plain
question?"</p>

<p>"Not to sech a pretty gal as you air, as would win
the Beauty Stakes heasy in a canter," was the gallant
reply.</p>

<p>"None of your flattery, sir. Is the governor, as
you call him, coming home this morning or not?"</p>

<p>"I should think he was," answered the incorrigible
Tops, "for his home ain't likely to go to him, like the
mountain to the Turkish gent, as I read of in the
'Sporting Life' yesterday. Talking of him, I can
put you on to a cheesy thing for the 'Chester.' A
young man in Sir Joseph's stable has give me the
tip. Now do let me put a quarter's celery for you
on to Mahomet. Its ten to one, and the hevent's
sartain."</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed!" returned Mrs. Susan. "It may
do for the Duchess of Marylebone and the Honourable
Miss Fitz-gent to send their coachmen on such errands.
They have no characters to lose."</p>

<p>"Marry come up!" exclaimed Tops, with energy.</p>

<p>"Marry, indeed!" said Mrs. Susan. "I'm in no
such hurry. This is only my third season, I'd have
you know, Mr. Tops."</p>

<p>" 'Marry,' Susan," replied that worthy, "is an
expreshun used at the Spring's Theayter, Pentonwill,
in Elizabeth Ann's drayma, as the great Mr. Stingray
says."</p>

<p>"And pray," inquired Mrs. Susan, with an indignant 

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

toss of her head, which, as Tops afterwards
said, put him in mind of a chesnut filly with tasselled 
nets shaking off the flies on a summer day;
"who is Elizabeth Ann? One of your girls, I
suppose. But tell me, whatever does make master
go on so, fretting that poor dear creature's heart out
as he does? Tell me this, and I'll go with you to
Kew Gardens, my very first Sunday out, I promise."</p>

<p>"No bribery!" cried Tops. "Don't think to
come old Sairey over me. Purity of helection and
huniversal sufferin', is my mottar. Why I'd sooner
rob master than tell on him, and hif I was a genelman,
I know which I'd excuse fust. The fact is, me and
master is in training for Parlimint, besides which,
we're a writing a book on the gory liar, the great
story-telling babboon of Afrikey. Now, suppose me
and you was married?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Tops," replied the lady, "just for a
moment, for the sake of argument, I'll entertain so
ridiculous an idea."</p>

<p>"Pink tops, white cords, real orange-blossoms,
and sech a blow out! Kew Gardens and 'everlasting 
devotion,' as I heerd master say to missus when
they was fust married."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Susan, "and if I was fool enough to
have you, you'd be just such another."</p>

<p>"That," observed Tops, gravely, "is a event
scratched clean out of the book of time."</p>

<p>"You mean the marriage?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>"No!" he replied; "I mean that hever I should
be sech another as master, arter the event. As hif
you didn't know what I mean!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

<p>"Well, but what is your master after?" rejoined
Susan. "Is it only gambling, or is it some designing 
wretch of a woman? Let me only come near her.
I'd tear her eyes out; I'd spoil her looks for her, the
creature, the female, the thing&mdash;&mdash;" And here she
seized Tops by the arm.</p>

<p>"Jest pinch a trifle softer&mdash;jest a trifle!" said that
individual. "You're a reckoning some one up finely,
you air. What's the caper?"</p>

<p>"Caper, indeed!" retorted the indignant Abigail.
"A caper, you call it, you wretch! Here's my poor
dear lamb of a mistress deserted for some brazen
hussy. Hi! hi!"</p>

<p>"Jest pull up, will yer?" said Tops. "I can't
stand them waterworks."</p>

<p>"You're no better than your master," rejoined the
weeping lady's-maid.</p>

<p>"No better nor master!" exclaimed Tops. "That's
coming it rayther too strong. Ajew, young woman,
ajew!" and he pretended that he was about to depart.</p>

<p>"There! go along with you," said Susan. "I'm
sure you're not wanted here."</p>

<p>"I'm going fast enough," answered Tops, reapproaching 
the object of his affections.</p>

<p>"If that is what you call going, I say 'stop!' "
said Susan.</p>

<p>"It hain't no use axing me to let out on the governor; 
that's what I've come back to tell yer," observed 
Tops. "When I follows master, I sees nothink,
I hears nothink, and I knows nothink, and if I did, I
tells nothink. If I was to deceive him, I should deceive 

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

you, afore I'd got well down to my work in the
collar of materimony, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tops, Tops!" literally cried the equally
faithful soubrette. "Think of that poor creature in
her affliction. Were it not that I should have to
leave her in it, I would never take so much as a cup
of tea in this unhappy house again."</p>

<p>"There hain't a groom, nor a coachman for that
matter," replied he of the stable, "no, not in hall
this ere village of London, as likes his young missis
better nor I do ourn. To please her I'd wait at table
in Berlin gloves, and look arter a garden and a one
'oss chay. But for all that, I tells no tales on master,
Susan: as a man, I don't split on a man."</p>

<p>"Go, then," replied Susan, indignantly, "and
help him to deceive a poor lady like her. Go, sir,
to your master and welcome for me; but never
breathe an odious syllable of love to me again;" and
with that Mrs. Susan flounced angrily out of the
room.</p>

<p>Mr. Tops gave suppressed utterance to a long
whistle, which it must be owned expressed a good
deal. "Kicked clean over the traces!" he said.
"What a power of chaff she do cut, surely. Shall I
turn master up, or not? I must say he don't behave
according, as that old pictur' card of a Binsby calls it.
Hallo! here he is. Let hisself in with a door-key at
twelve o'clock!"</p>

<p>As he said this, Mr. Tops endeavoured to make his
escape before the "governor," as he styled him, could
get up-stairs; but meeting him on the landing,
touched his forelock, and said:</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

<p>"I've just come in to know what horders there is
to day, sir?"</p>

<p>"You here, Tops?" said his master. "Put the
chesnut four-year-olds into the mail-phaeton, and
come round at two o'clock to Wilton-place, you know.
Look sharp! What are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"The near chesnut 'oss is lame, sir, in his hoff
fore-leg," replied the groom.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" said his master. "How did he
get lamed, eh?"</p>

<p>"He shan't drive her in our trap, if I can 'elp it,"
quoth Tops to himself. (<i>Aloud</i>.) "He's very badly
bruised in the frog&mdash;picked up a stone on Saturday."</p>

<p>"Well, put the mare in," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"What! missus's mare?" asked Tops.</p>

<p>"Yes, you fool," was the ungracious answer.
"You know your mistress will not ride again, and
she goes beautifully in double harness."</p>

<p>"I've jest give her a dose of physic, sir," replied
Tops, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Dash it!" cried his master. "This is too bad;
with seven horses in my stable, I have never one to
ride or drive."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," said Tops, "if I can't please
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! you rascal! say no more. You can leave
when you please," said Aubrey. "This comes," he
added to himself, "of putting confidence in a groom;
yet I thought he was faithful and attached to me. I
suppose I ought to have raised the scamp's wages,
when I trusted him."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

<p>"Well, sir," said Tops with some emotion, "I
hope you'll find one as will sarve you as true as I've
done, and take care of the 'osses. I've lived with
yer since I was a bwy (boy), and a better master I
shan't see, that's sartain, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, sir?" inquired Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mister Aubrey, sir, if I dared say. I was
so happy, when you and missus used to drive out
together, and now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now, sir?" was Aubrey's interrogation.</p>

<p>"There is one has 'as took her place, as hain't
fit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! you confounded rascal!" thundered his
master. "Lectured by my groom? Ha! ha! I suppose, 
sir, that you think I ought to have raised your
wages&mdash;you fancy that I have not tipped you sufficiently, 
eh? Look you, you will leave this house
to-night. Not another word. Begone! Send Thomas
to me. I will see if he can harness the lame horse&mdash;eh! 
and the one in physic. Be off, sir! No, stay, and
listen. Go and put the chesnuts in harness, in the
phaeton, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Arthur, sir," almost blubbered poor
Tops, "but I can't see missus&mdash;&mdash;" and the honest
fellow fairly burst into tears, and ran down stairs
to hide his emotion in the stable, so soon as he could
get there, and to impart his sorrow to the horses.</p>

"So!" said Aubrey to himself, "a pretty state of
things! I hope I did not speak too loud. Ha! here
comes my wife, with that precious maid of hers,
Madam Susan. If I could find a way to get rid of
her too, it wouldn't be amiss. I hate the sight of

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

the confounded prying fool. These sort of people
are always making mischief with their pretended
interest and sympathy. But the women set up such
a howl, when their privileges are attacked; and I
suppose it is one of them to keep an idle, curious,
impertinent minx like that."</p>

<p>During this muttered soliloquy, Mrs. Aubrey had
slowly descended the stairs, and now stood before her
savage and indignant husband.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Arthur?" she said, in accents that
might have melted a Cheyenne Indian, had he been
less infatuated.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Aubrey. "Who else should it
be?"</p>

<p>"You forget my infirmity, dear Arthur," said the
poor lady.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" was the rough rejoinder.</p>

<p>As he spoke their eyes seemed to meet, but, alas!
it was not so. There was no speculation in her
beautiful orbs. She was blind, stone blind; and yet
he could answer her thus!</p>

<p>"Dear Arthur," she said, "I am so glad you have
returned. I heard your footsteps half down the
street."</p>

<p>"Did you indeed?" he said carelessly.</p>

<p>They entered while speaking the room where
Aubrey had just held his brief conversation with
Tops.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she replied, "it were better were it not so.
Every change of tone reaches my heart through these
unwilling portals" (pressing her hands on her ears),

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

"and sometimes I wish I were deaf as well as blind,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"Oh! for Heaven's sake, Blanche, do not give me
a dose of the sentimental. One would think you were
dreadfully treated," was the semi-brutal response.</p>

<p>"Nay, Arthur, when have I complained? But
to-day&mdash;&mdash;" she urged.</p>

<p>"Well, well, to-day&mdash;what of it? Last night I
was kept out, but I explained it all in my note. We
played at whist at the club till five, and I went home
to Swellingham's chambers, rather than disturb you
and the house."</p>

<p>"Disturb me? Do you think, then, that I slept?"</p>

<p>"I should hope so," was the careless answer.
"Look here, Blanche," said her husband. "Do
not be so dreadfully querulous. I own that yours is
a sad trial and affliction; and I am sure I do all that
I can under the circumstances. Is there anything I
can do to please you?"</p>

<p>One would have thought, from the manner in which
he spoke this, that he was the most attentive of husbands, 
quite a marital martyr, in fact.</p>

<p>A ray of pleasure shot across the face of Blanche,
and for a moment the old sweet flush returned to her
cheek. Her eyes had lost but little of their beauty,
although there was a kind of cloudy indistinctness in
their regard. They looked more like the eyes of a
saint in some picture mellowed by time. She had
not grown old; but she looked as if an age had swept
over her, and carried with it all the brightness and
freshness of her young life.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

<p>"Oh, Arthur!" she said, "come home early, and
give me one entire evening. I have had such a strange
dream this morning about us both. I know it is
dull for you; and yet you said, when this terrible
affliction first threatened me, that you cared not, if I
could reconcile myself to my fate, since you could
never know a jealous pang, never find your home
deserted. And yet, dear, before I became blind, you
had not much cause to blame the truant disposition
of your wife."</p>

<p>"I suppose," returned her husband, "you mean
to say that <i>I</i> am a truant. Pray cease for once to
allude to your affliction, as you call it. I am sure I
never speak of it more than is absolutely necessary.
Of course, I am very grieved that you cannot come
out and accompany me as you did before; but you
can hardly expect me to remain at home always."</p>

<p>"Cannot come out!" breathed poor Blanche to
herself. "Oh, Heavens! does he ever ask me?"
(<i>Aloud</i>.) "Nay, dear Arthur, though I cannot ride
out on horseback, I could go with you in the carriage
sometimes. Oh! do, dear, take me out with you in
the phaeton to-day. I should so like it."</p>

<p>The guilty conscience of Aubrey here touched him
to the quick. What was the meaning of this? Did
she suspect anything? Had Tops really betrayed
him? No, no! Her manner was far too affectionate
for that. So he said aloud:</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot to-day. Your faithful groom
has made a hospital of the stables, and I have just
discharged him in consequence."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

<p>"Discharged Tops?" exclaimed Blanche.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered her husband, "and why not,
I pray?"</p>

<p>"Poor Tops!" she said. "Oh, Arthur, how
changed you are!"</p>

<p>"Changed!" vociferated Aubrey. "It is time to
change, when a man has no peace at home for tears,
and reproaches, and sentiment, and that sort of thing.
I tell you, I hate this snivelling and crying. What
have I done? What do I do, to merit it? Is there
anything in the world you want? Did I not send to
Paris last Tuesday for Doctor De Latour for your
eyes? Do I not load you with presents and luxuries?
Do I not put up, for your sake, with the insolence of
your maid? Have I not given up my intention to
shoot this year in Scotland! Good God! Mrs.
Aubrey, what would you have?"</p>

<p>"Yourself&mdash;your heart, Arthur," was the reply.
"I was a poor governess, I know, when you married
me. Nay, do not frown and be impatient. You saw
me accidentally and courted me, and I refused you,
left the kind people who then sheltered me&mdash;for your
sake, not for mine, Arthur, for I loved you from the
first. You followed me, and discovered me in my new
situation, where I was treated like a menial, in the
great contractor's service, weeping over an insult just
received from one of his purse-proud daughters. You
claimed me, and I was yours, because you willed it&mdash;
yours by a love whose pride rose to the level of your
impassioned generosity."</p>

<p>"Well, well, dear! it is all quite true. It is not I

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

who remind you of all these things. What have you
to complain of? Are you sorry that you accepted
my hand?"</p>

<p>"For your sake, I am. For myself, I grieve as
little as I may. You fancied that you loved me.
You did love me for awhile; and now I were far
happier and better back again in the sordid coal-owner's 
family, than living here a burden and an
annoyance to you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, Blanche!" said Aubrey,
softened by her appeal, "you are no burden to me,
love. How can you talk so? There, don't cry.
You drive me away from you, I declare. Do you
mean to say that I neglect you, because of your unfortunate 
calamity?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Arthur!" she replied, eagerly, "you are
too generous for that. You cannot help it, dearest!
Other eyes, not darkened like these poor orbs, flash
on your path&mdash;others can participate better in your
pleasures and your amusements. I no longer attract
others&mdash;I who cared not to attract any, save you
alone, and you have grown careless of one so entirely
your own. But let me say no more. I thought not
to have said this. In the long weary hours of the
night, I think that if I could only talk to you, you
would love me again as of old. But it is not so. I
only weary you. Forgive me. You are going out,
are you not, dearest? Do not let me keep you, but
come home earlier for the sake of your health. I
could have wished that to-day&mdash;but no matter."</p>

<p>"What of to-day in particular?" asked Aubrey.</p>

<p>"It is an anniversary," she replied.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

<p>"An anniversary? Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of the day," answered Blanche, "when you
married an orphan girl, who brought you no dowry,
save her heart."</p>

<p>"And a dear good little heart it is," he replied.
"There, love, don't be so dismal. I declare you
make me quite miserable. There, I will stop at home
all day; though I had promised&mdash;that is, I will come
home at four, in time to take you out before dinner.
I want to bring you a little present&mdash;a bracelet. It
was to have been a surprise."</p>

<p>"A surprise!" thought Blanche, "and he did not
even remember the anniversary of our wedding-day.
If you knew how happy you make me, dearest," she
said aloud, "you would often be thus kind to me;
indeed you would."</p>

<p>"There, good-bye, God bless you, dear!" said her
husband, who felt at that moment what a scoundrel
and hypocrite he was, and determined to buy the costliest 
bracelet that he could obtain on credit. Such presents 
often resemble the "conscience money," which
a superstitious rogue pays to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, to the astonishment of poorer and honester
men. We knew a rakish husband once who never
omitted to take a handsome present home, whenever
he deceived his wife.</p>

<p>Arthur Aubrey imprinted a hasty kiss on the fair
brow that pillowed itself a moment in renewed hope
and happiness on his breast, and then hurried off,
saying:</p>

<p>"I'll be back at half-past four punctually. There'll
be lots of time, as we dine at seven, you know, dear."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

<p>Blanche sighed involuntarily at the loss even of
the half-hour thus carelessly intimated; but, on the
whole, she felt more joyful and contented than she
had done for weeks; and when Susan entered, in
a quarter of an hour, she found her still standing
where Aubrey had left her, with a smile on her face
so radiant, that as that faithful attendant described it
soon afterwards to Tops, it put her in mind of a saint
on a painted window in one of those foreign Catholic
churches in France.</p>

<p>"Come," said her mistress, "I want you to take
in my green silk-fluted dress with the purple trimmings 
that I had from Paris last month. I don't
want to look thin, you know, and I mean to wear it
to-day. Don't you remember how your master admired 
it, the day I first put it on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mum!" said Mrs. Susan, aloud, "it does
become you beautiful;" and to herself, "I'd see
him far enough before I put on anything he admired,
that I would, the nasty, unfeeling, selfish brute. I
should like to know whose fault it is, the dear angel
has grown thinner. Ugh! I should like to strangle
him in it, I should, and all such wretches. Well, I
wish him no worse than to see himself as I see his
wicked conduct at this blessed minute."</p>

</div>

<p>AN explanation is due of the change which had
come over the dream of the Aubreys' domestic bliss.
But three years before, we saw them "loving and
being loved," to borrow the title of a charming novel
by Mrs. A. Maillard. How was it that Blanche
had thus realised the awful affliction which we have
thus incidentally described? How came it that the very
nature and character of Aubrey had undergone such
fatal transformation in so short a time? The truth
is, to answer the last interrogation first, that Aubrey
had lately fallen into evil ways. Surfeited with his
wife's affection; subjected to the worst influences, and
the most pernicious examples; growing desperate in
the face of ruin, that seemed approaching him with

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

gigantic strides; living a dissipated and useless life;
constantly under the exciting influence of wine,
though far from being a tippler or a drunkard;
stifling thought, and hating himself for what he was
when he did think, Mr. Aubrey was a changed man&mdash;the 
victim of frivolity, bad habits, idleness, and enduring 
"le p&eacute;nible fardeau de n'avoir rien &agrave; faire."
Blanche's affliction at first alarmed and shocked, and
then bored him. It is a hopeless case when a man
comes to say of the dearest tie of life, "What a
bore!" There was something unutterably mean and
cowardly in his conduct, and he knew it; but yet
persisted in his course. If it were possible to sustain
a single mitigating plea for him, a single "circonstance 
extenuante," as the French are apt to do for
their worst criminals, it was that his union had not
been blessed with offspring, and he had at first longed
deeply and tenderly for a child. Now, he had ceased
to regret this deprivation, and was rather inclined to
look upon it as a piece of luck. So selfish, so hardened 
and blinded, had this man become; the spoiled
child of fortune, deaf to sense and reason, squandering 
his last resources and means of redemption in
heartless extravagance, borrowing money at ruinous
rates of interest&mdash;in short, leading just that life which
astonishes us now and then in the revelations of our
Bankruptcy and Divorce Courts; when we can only
refer the actions of such a man, who has spurned
every blessing, and embraced ruin and disgrace with
open arms, to the restless promptings and unaccountable 
caprices of a disordered brain.</p>

<p>The commencement of Aubrey's neglect of the

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

being whom he had so ardently wooed and won took
place about a year before the period of the conduct
which we are now reluctantly compelled to describe.
For six months or so, it had been very gradual, and
his angelic partner had herself unselfishly encouraged
him to seek amusement and distraction from home.
Poor thing! She said to herself, "I must not tire
him of home;" and not only accorded him unquestioned 
liberty, but would say to him playfully, "I
must not pin you to my apron-strings," and "you
see, dear, what a sensible little wife I am." So he
went about shooting and yachting with his friends,
and visited Doncaster and Newmarket, and at last
actually went to Paris for a fortnight alone. From
that visit, which she at least in appearance cheerfully
permitted, though, to speak the truth, it cost her
many secret tears, might be dated the actual era of
neglect and even harshness. Then Blanche began to
pine and fade. She became visibly thinner and lost
her beautiful wild-rose tint. One would have thought
this might have reclaimed her husband's truant and
fickle heart. At first he displayed some sympathy
and regret. But in place of telling her that he must
remain more constantly at home, he continually told
her that she did not go out sufficiently often. Why
did she not visit this friend, or that? Why did she
not go to balls, or concerts, without him? There was
the carriage, why did she not drive out oftener? There
was her horse, why did she not ride it unattended,
save by her groom? Other ladies do it. Besides, did
she not know plenty of ladies, who rode on horseback
in the Park? Then he was always engaged in affairs&mdash;business 

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

with the lawyers. This was his frequent
excuse for being fretful and short in his answers.
Other wives would be delighted to have so much
liberty. There was one odious phase of married
selfishness on the part of a husband, in which he certainly 
did not indulge. He never grudged her any
expense; never denied her any amount of money.
Alas! he had no occasion; for she was as economical,
as he was thriftless. Not mean; for she had her
little charities, and no household was ever better administered; 
but though she little knew their real
position, she easily divined that Aubrey was overstepping 
the bounds of prudence, and living above
his income. And besides, she never forgot in her
own mind that she brought him no dowry, no accession 
of fortune. When they were married, she had
persistently refused a settlement, much to the regret
and annoyance of Lady Courcy, who held such a
disposition to be at once a prudent and a necessary
thing.</p>

<p>Poor Blanche! Could she have gone out cheerfully
without her husband; could she have indulged in
ever so slight a platonic flirtation; could she have
contrived to make Aubrey feel the slightest insecurity
in the tenure of her devoted affections, how much
might she have been spared! We are inclined to
think that, even had she known "the way to keep
him," she would not have acted otherwise; could not
have played a part; could not have sullied the virgin
purity of her soul by even the passing shadow which
a plot to retain her husband's affections must necessarily 
have reflected upon it. For that shadow must

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

have been cast by some other man. Certain it is that
Aubrey's jealousy would not have been very easily
aroused. And, to enhance all, she was left, by the
sudden death of Lady Courcy, without either counsellor 
or true friend. That estimable lady saw, with
inexpressible grief and pain, the blight which threatened 
her young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e's happiness, and she was on
the point of warning her, when she was unhappily
removed from the scene by the stern summons of
death. Latterly Blanche had fallen into a sickly and
nervous state. Still she complained not; and her
faithful maid, Susan, with that young person's confidant 
and admirer, Tops, were the only individuals
who really knew the sum of her suffering and its real
cause. True, a physician had been called in. On
this Aubrey insisted. Perhaps he thought to repair
through medicine the ravages which his own neglect
was making with such cruel and effective haste. The
physician prescribed air and exercise, and change;
and these, apart from her husband, Blanche mildly
refused to take. She did not say why; but she neglected 
the doctor's commonplace injunctions, with an
uncomplaining resolution which her husband called
obstinacy, and which sometimes made him very angry
and unkind. At length, one night, when he returned
home and found her sitting up, to his great annoyance 
and disgust, he observed a peculiar expression
in her face, which caused him a pang of alarm and
self-reproach.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven," he said, "Blanche, that you
would go to bed, like a sensible woman, and take

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

more care of your health. Why do you go on like
this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur!" she replied, "you know how ill
and nervous I have been lately. It is not my fault,
dearest, indeed it is not."</p>

<p>"Your fault?" observed Aubrey, "why no, not
exactly, though I do think you are very obstinate in
not going out more, and taking better care of yourself.
You remain at home, until you get your head full of
sick fancies."</p>

<p>"Fancies!" said Blanche, meekly; "I wish they
were fancies. Are the dreadful shooting pains in my
head, fancies? Oh, Arthur! you would not say so if
you knew; and now, this very evening," she said,
"you don't know what a fright I have had. Do
you know, dear!" she continued, rising and trembling 
in every limb, whilst an ashy pallor spread
over her beautiful face; "do you know," she
uttered very slowly, "I believe that I am becoming
blind!"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" said her husband. "Mere fancy!"
But he was forced to admit the dread truth of the
fact, when Blanche staggered into his arms with a
shriek, and cried with shrill, small voice, that seemed
torn from the inmost depths of an agonising breast,
"I cannot see you, husband, dear. I cannot see
you," and then burst into a passionate fit of sobbing,
which could not be controlled.</p>

<p>"Not see me?" cried Arthur; "nay, look again.
This lamp does not give the best of light. You are
tired, dear. It is a passing cloud of indigestion. It
is something floating before your vision. 'Musc&aelig;

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

volitantes,' the doctors call it. Why I have had it myself 
more than once," he added, cheerfully. "Come,
look at me now. Don't you see me smiling at your
foolish fears?"</p>

<p>"I hear your voice&mdash;I feel the pressure of your
arms," replied Blanche, still sobbing, and panting
like a wounded bird; "but I am blind, stone blind.
I saw darkly, as it were in shadows, before you came;
and now I see nothing, nothing at all."</p>

<p>Aubrey felt her weight suddenly press heavily upon
him, and perceived she had fainted in his arms. He
rang up the household, and sent for a physician,
who prescribed remedies, and ordered the room to be
darkened, and said that her sight would soon be
restored.</p>

<p>But it was not. And what is more, the cause of
it seemed to baffle all the faculty. There was no
cataract formed or forming, no spot, no film; but
those large and beautiful eyes suddenly became deprived 
of sight, and for three months Blanche Aubrey
had been totally blind. For awhile, Aubrey's attentions 
had been incessant; but they soon fell off, and
at the time we have again raised the curtain on our
dramatis person&aelig;, his neglect was as complete and
cruel, as it was unstudied. On the very night when
the mantle of darkness fell on his devoted partner, he
had, by some strange coincidence, been introduced to
a fascinating creature, who now already occupied all
his spare time and thoughts. He had never received
the slightest encouragement from her; and this, if
anything, made his conduct more despicable and unpardonable. 
Were it not strictly true, such folly

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

and wickedness would seem impossible. Alas! of
what is human nature not capable? Our motives
are as varied and various in their intricate workings
as our countenances and their expressions, and more
mysterious, because they are unseen.</p>

<p class="small">Each breast a whirring clock whose dial lies,<br/>

Each face false dial to that plotting breast;<br/>

Each heart the weight its brief sad task that plies,<br/>

Till the vext puppet gasping sinks to rest.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Nature's curled darlings as bad
as Arthur Aubrey, and many worse. He was vain,
imaginative, idle, and pampered. But the man was
not really bad at heart.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cry our fair readers. "The wretch,
the unfeeling brute, the monster!"</p>

<p>"My dear madam," we reply to one, "what
shall we say about a certain affair in which your
respectable husband was involved, when he married
you?"</p>

<p>There was a poor girl committed suicide in the
Hoxton Canal a few days after the wedding, who&mdash;&mdash;But 
you know all about it, and considered him, we
believe, rather in the light of the victim on that
occasion, although <i>he</i> was not drowned, nor put even
to the cost of a cheap funeral, when the violent, and,
as you are assured, scheming and drunken girl of
eighteen, the daughter of a diabolical small farmer in
Huntingdonshire, met her end. Shall we explain to
you, mademoiselle, how your affianced lover has just
quietly put an end to his domestic felicity in the
Regent's Park&mdash;fair girl, pony-carriage, love-birds,
Java sparrows, Newfoundland dog, cottage piano, and
all? After nine years' domestication there, it seemed

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

rather hard; and so that good-for-nothing hussy
doubtless thought it, when the furniture was sold up.
Ah, we see you know it already; and yet you will
marry dear Charles, and not be very angry with him,
so that you are certain it is all ended, all over with
<i>her</i>. A man must sow his wild oats, you know.</p>

<p>All we say is, that there are plenty of worse instances
of heartlessness than that of Aubrey, of which no one
takes any account at all. We do not mean to defend
or palliate his offence for one moment. We should
like to kick such a fellow down-stairs, to upset his
phaeton, break his leg or arm, and otherwise punish
him for his criminal folly, his stupid sin. All we
mean to say is, that Society frequently condones, if it
may not be accused of patronising, worse conduct
than that of Aubrey towards his hapless and beautiful 
wife. Look at that tawny officer and gentleman,
who deliberately wins the foolish affections of a
friend's wife, to leave her within a few short months
lost and blighted, to die, or worse. Yet such men
are received in almost every house; mothers fling
their daughters at their heads, if they are rich; and
fathers invite them to dinner. They have been a
little "wild," that is the term. Some people call it
"gay." He is a "gay" deceiver, a Lothario, the
ladies say; whilst shrinking from the contact of the
less criminal partner of his guilt, as if she were a leper,
or smitten with the plague. This is, of course, when
they are legally found out. We know how Lycisca
would have blamed Valeria in the Roman tale, had
the alleged misdeeds of the latter been mentioned in
the drawing-room of the former. But does not this

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

kind of thing extend throughout all classes? The
policeman bears loud witness against the ticket-of-leave 
man; the attorney-at-law denounces the thief.
Justice is an excellent thing, when it is well administered; 
only unfortunately that is so rarely the case,
one begins to doubt the abstract existence of such a
phenomenon in human affairs. "Tomkins is an
excellent fellow when he is sober," said an Irish
panegyrist; "the mischief of it is that he is always
drunk."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE SIREN IN HER CAVE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Aha! pious sir or virtuous madam, do you deny it? Must you
shut your eyes to it? Does it not exist? Is it not a sufficiently
marked portion of modern existence? Do you ever drive in the Park,
madam? Do you read your daily paper, sir? Have you never seen
the "Saturday Review" on this and kindred subjects, such as French
manners, and the female attire of the period? I think you will find
the matter&mdash;treated seriously, of course&mdash;in one or other even of the
"Quarterlies." Ha! young lady, what is that which you asked your
brother just now? Whether the "belle Imp&eacute;ria" has not changed the
colour of her hair? <i>You</i>, at any rate, <i>folle mignonne!</i> know what is
going on around you, in this doll-show of a female fashionable world.
<i>You</i> are well versed in the equipages of the demi-monde, and can tell
whom Lais and Phryne have entangled in the false meshes of their yellow
tresses, or on whom the dark-browed Rhodope, hight Cora, smiles with
the fascination of a <i>Succube</i>, unscathed of the Inquisition and "Maistre
Johan de la Haye." You talk of it, think of it, and sometimes envy
and imitate the style, do you not? Truly, when you pass these Sirens,
you put no cotton in your ears!&mdash;<i>From the Note-book of Solomon
Trustall, LL.D</i>.</p>

<p>SEATED in a moderately sized drawing-room, furnished 
richly, but with exquisite taste, in a small
but aristocratic-looking house in Wilton-place, the
day after the events which we have just narrated,
was a young lady, who might have numbered some
two and three and twenty summers. Her form was
slight, but rounded; her head small, and placed on
her slender throat with admirable poise; and her

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

hands and feet, the latter cased in a small pair of
white moccasins, embroidered with moose-hair, by
Indian skill, were of the most delicate proportions
and shape. Her mass of light-brown hair, which
was shot, silk-like, with a golden hue, was thrown
off the face, and formed into a roll behind, confined
by a simple stiletto of gold, in a style which a sea-nymph's 
toilette could not have surpassed in perfect
but unstudied grace. The expression of her large
grey eyes was most peculiar. At one moment they
had an almost animal-like vivacity and brightness,
reminding the gazer involuntarily of those of a beautiful 
tawny pard; at another, they had a soft and
beseeching look, which might have been worn by
Helen, when she besought favour and forgiveness at
old Priam's hands. Then there were rare moments,
when an intense melancholy which shadowed her
whole aspect filled those grey orbs with an undefinable
tenderness, so sympathetic and so sorrowful, that
you could not help thinking of what Beatrice Cenci
might have been, had her young life been spared,
when dreamily gazing in some conventual retreat at
the dark cypresses and pines bordering her garden
walk in the glowing sunset of an Italian eve. But
these moments were rare indeed, and those who were
privileged to witness them were few. Her general
expression was one of extreme archness and gaiety,
mingled with mutinerie and daring. The shape of
her nose was quite suited to give effect to this
expression. It was a Greek nose spoiled for the
purposes of classical sculpture by being slightly
retrouss&eacute;; but we can venture to say that no one

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

would have wished it to have preserved a severer
regularity of outline. Her mouth, too, was a trifle
wide, at least, so it seemed by the breadth and fulness
of her lower lip. It was, perhaps, a slightly sensual
mouth; but curved with the sweetest good-nature.
Her teeth were exquisitely pearly and regular; her
brow wide, but by no means lofty. This arose from
no want of intellectual development, but from the
simple fact that her hair grew low. Her complexion
was clear, but not dazzingly white. If we were to
search for a poetical comparison, we should prefer
calling it ivory, rather than alabaster in its hue. But
the colour of her cheeks, which never increased much,
though it might and did vanish sometimes, leaving a
forlorn wanness in its place, was like that of a winter
rose, or the pink inside of a sea-shell. Perhaps we
have been most forcibly reminded of her by one of
those statuettes <i>en biscuit</i> which we see now so often
in the shop-windows&mdash;one of a girl with head thrown
back and arms stretched behind her; a saucy, provoking, 
mischievous, laughing demoiselle, infinitely
more attractive than Joan of Arc, and other statuettes
without turned-up noses and bewitching coquetry of
attitude and expression.</p>

<p>We have been at all these pains to describe this
young lady, because it is necessary to state that she
could not be called either handsome or beautiful.
Imagine her plainly and unbecomingly attired, and
carrying a parcel or a bandbox in the street, and you
might pass her a dozen times without particular
notice. You would never say, "What a handsome,
what a striking girl!" But if you ever happened to

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

be placed for a brief time in her society, if she
once attracted your attention, if you noticed her
<i>espi&egrave;glerie</i>, her wit, her humour, her singularity of
ideas and expressions, her playfulness and rapid elegance 
of movement, startling but never boisterous,
abrupt but never angular, wayward, capricious,
shifting as Undine, but Undine with a soul, it is
certain that your very prejudices would be disarmed
and captivated, and if you did not come away her
lover, you would, at least, her friend.</p>

<p>She was dressed in white muslin, with a light blue
tunic in points. Round her waist was a blue-and-gold 
cord, with tassels of the same colours. The
only ornament she wore was a gold crucifix, with
four turquoises of remarkable magnitude, and turquoise 
ear-rings, each a single stone, mounted in
plain gold, in ears which seemed even smaller by the
contrast with a certain massiveness in these ornaments.</p>

<p>Shall we describe the furniture of the room? We
will simply say that it was chiefly of white and gold.
There was not a single mirror or looking-glass
around. But the pictures were chiefly representations 
of the fair occupant herself, and they were
certainly curious in their variety of costume and
style. There was one, a kit-cat, life-size, which
represented her leaning out of an opera-box, dressed
in a rose-coloured domino, with the hood thrown
back and a mask in her hand. In one water-colour,
she was depicted driving a pair of grey horses in a
phaeton with marvellous ease and dash. In another,
she was mounted, and in the act of taking a fence and

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

some four or five yards of water at a flying leap, with
a gentleman in scarlet and his steed half-immersed
beneath her horse's feet. Half a dozen prints of her
in various theatrical costumes, and a variety of photographs, 
next engaged the attention, and a set of
crayons completed the series. One of these represented 
her leaning back, dressed as an Odalisque,
and smoking a cigarette. In another, she was attired
in a species of Bloomer costume, and appeared with
a small double-barrelled gun in her hand, at what
was apparently a pigeon-match, with&mdash;alas! that we
should record such bad taste&mdash;a very pronounced
bull-dog at her feet. The third was a woodland
sketch, and in this she was seen accompanied by a
brace of spaniels and a terrier, brushing the early
dew, in a tunic of Lincoln green and with a golden
baldric, at the "pheasant hunt," as our neighbours
would call it. A grim forester a few yards behind&mdash;keeper 
we should call him now-a-days&mdash;attested, by
a leash of slain "long-tails" and a hare which he
carried, her Amazonian prowess. A billiard sketch,
a skating party, and a river scene, in which a young
lady in a blue Garibaldi, pulling in an outrigger,
whom, without much difficulty, we might easily
conclude to be the same versatile and ubiquitous
divinity, completed the series.</p>

<p>Seated on an embroidered ottoman, which was
certainly not her own work&mdash;for the needle was not
this young lady's forte, and a sewing-machine was
about the only thing, as one of her admirers said,
in which she could not be backed to distance any
one of her sex, age and weight, in a canter&mdash;and

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

leaning upon a table, covered with nick-nacks&mdash;among 
which was a jewelled riding-whip under a
glass-case, won in a steeple-chase, as was duly recorded 
on an accompanying gold horse-shoe&mdash;the fair
subject of our somewhat elaborated description was
engaged in looking over a number of cards and notes,
to some of which she accorded but slight interest,
while with others she seemed amused, or pleased. At
length, she opened one, which evidently caused her
no little annoyance, if not disgust. She bit her lip
and frowned; and then, rising, tore it into minute
fragments, and flung it into the grate. Then her look
of displeasure deepened and softened into that twilight 
gloom of retrospective thought which we have
before touched upon and endeavoured to describe.
It was as if the contents of the note had reminded
her of some dark mystery, some forgotten trouble.</p>

<p>"I must put an end to this," she mused. "It
suits neither me nor him. It recals things I would
forget&mdash;do forget, save for these obtrusive annoyances. 
I hate that man for the very kindness which
he once conferred on me, when I couple it with
this odious persecution now. Ah! if he only knew.
Let me see&mdash;what shall I do? I have tried to disgust 
him with vulgarity and caprice, with the extravagance 
of my demands, and the insolence of my
slights. Yet he comes fawning like a spaniel to my
feet again. And then, to think of his cruelty to that
poor creature, his wife! I have ordered my door to
be shut in his face, in vain, I am sure to meet him
somewhere&mdash;he knows all my set. Come what will, I
will put an end to it this very day, if I have to insult

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

him publicly, if I strike him with my whip in the
Park. No, no, I could not do that, when I think
how he once&mdash;&mdash; Well, no matter, it must and shall
be done. He is my <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, a shadow in the path
of my career. How late Luckless is. Poor Harry,
he can't keep an appointment even with me. I
believe that he was even born late; and married
he certainly never can be, as he would not be in time
for the ceremony. Of all my crowd of flatterers and
admirers, the only one whom I am perfectly at ease
with, is Harry. I let him see me, even in my black fits,
my moments of shuddering depression. He executes
all my little commissions, even those of charity, which
any one, save he, would make fun of, or treat with
ridicule and contempt. He is the only one before
whom I can be entirely natural, and need never act.
And yet I do believe that there is no one else for
whose opinion I really care. Dear Harry, how well
his very faults become him, fit him like an unpaid-for 
coat; while the selfish vices of others disfigure
them like the costumes of an English masquerade,
which they never can carry bravely or at ease. Let
me see, where have I shot him off this morning? I
said to him yesterday, 'I wonder you don't get tired
of these commissions. Some day I shall fire you off
as usual, and you will not return.' 'Ah!' he answered,
'I am just a boomerang in your hands, you cruel creature! 
It matters not how you throw me about, I am
sure to return to your feet.' Heigho! I really do think
if ever I were silly enough to marry, I should choose
Luckless for a husband. Nobody ever did take care
of him, I'm sure; and I believe I could manage him

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

to perfection, without a touch of whip or spur. Ah!
there he is at last. Now if it were any one else at
the door, I should rush off to put my hair straight,
or to see how I look, or keep him waiting just for
mischief, or form's sake, or send my dear old
stupid sheep-dog, Lacy, to mind him, until I had read
my new part, or tried on a dress, or done anything,
save hurry myself to grant an audience, whoever the
visitor might be."</p>

<p>Such were the real sentiments of the fascinating
young actress, to whom half of the rou&eacute;s and coxcombs
of London were paying their homage at this period,
not to mention a good number of respectable wealthy
hypocrites, and a few earnest fools besides. For she
had lately taken the town by storm, and her appearance 
at the Theatre Royal Thespis, as <i>the</i> goddess of
burlesque, was the theme of universal comment, admiration, 
and delight.</p>

<p>Among her more prominent admirers was Sir
Harry Luckless, whom she knew previous to her
d&eacute;but, and who was popularly supposed to have introduced 
her to the great manager, actor, and playwright, 
Methusalem Wigster. Also the Duke of
Chalkstoneville, whose conquest she achieved attired
as Apollo, on her first appearance in the burlesque
of "Marsyas," in which the puns were so plentiful,
and yet so indistinct, that it was like a milky-way
of wit, or, as the author would have doubtless written,
"whey." No one could discern a separate star or
constellation of cleverness in its composition; but
the whole was pronounced, in the words of a modern
critic, to be "scintillating with the brightest coruscations 

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

of genius." The fact is, the author was himself 
a dramatic critic, the surest way in these days to
get a footing on the stage. "You should read it in
italics, my boy," said one of the successful playwright's 
admirers. "By Jove, sir, there is a pun in
every line, only these confounded actors and actresses
won't italicise in their delivery, as they ought."</p>

<p>We must own that the difficulty of the burlesque
interpreter was great. Conceive such lines as the
following put in Cupid's mouth, to a tune founded
on "Lesbia hath a beaming Eye." It must be understood, 
as a matter of course, that Marsyas was represented 
as an Ethiopean serenader with a banjo.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Ma's eye has (Marsyas) a glance of fire<br/>

To frizzle this unhappy nigger, oh!<br/>

When great Sol his truthful lyre (liar)<br/>

Twangs, in mangrove thicket twig her, oh!<br/>

Sitting with her doves at play,<br/>

That cooey, cooey, o'er his failure,<br/>

All the long Algerian day (dey),<br/>

On Afric's shore in South Australia.</p>

<p>(CHORUS, <i>with dance</i>.)<br/>

Ri tum chokee, Tantia Topee tight;<br/>

For he's got no friends, and it sarves him right.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding all that sense might urge, and
possibly did urge&mdash;only no one listened to it&mdash;against 
this astounding rubbish, the burlesque was
pronounced a "screaming" success; and when the
fascinating actress to whom we have just introduced
our readers, in her private bower, appeared in blue
satin trunk-hose, and seemed to play on a gilded
"testudo," the sounds which were rendered by the
fat thumb of the leading violinist in the orchestra,
the applause was tremendous, and all London was

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

set humming, whistling, and singing, not only "Ri
tum chokee Tantia Topee tight," but the charming
songs of "Buskins and Garters," and "Skin him
alive, oh!" with which Apollo himself, or rather
herself, enraptured the audiences of the Thespis.
If, on the one hand, it may he said that folly and bad
taste could go no further, it must be admitted on the
other, that they were charmingly embellished by the
archness and elegance of the <i>d&eacute;butante</i>, who certainly
could not be held answerable for the style of entertainment 
in vogue. Nay, her acting and appearance
on the boards of the Thespis Theatre would really
have redeemed even worse stuff than that of which
we have just given a sample. Be that as it may,
Miss Dareall soon became the "rage," and was at
that moment, in spite of Exeter Hall and morality,
the most popular woman in London. Exeter Hall,
did we say? Why "la belle Imp&eacute;ria" herself, of
whom we have made mention in the heading to this
chapter, was not more run after by the Church,
of course merely to see her act, and condemn the
follies of the day, than was our bewitching actress.
Who did not go to see her? Who that had been
once, could help going a second time, and a third?
What critiques were lavished on her by the Press!
Every one was enamoured of her, more or less, after
his several fashion. As for Methusalem Wigster, she
could do just what she pleased with him. She
actually made him appear charitable and good-natured. 
He gave a benefit, at her suggestion, for
the wife of his stage-manager, who had run away
with another woman, and left her with his three

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

children to starve. He increased the salary of the
ballet-girls and "soups" under her threat to leave
such a miserly hole, if he refused to comply. The
great Drivel of the "Daily Blight" wrote a column
and a half about her, under the heading of "Realistic
Pulchritude of the Modern Stage."</p>

<p>There was but one dramatic critic whose comments
were an exception to the rule. This gentleman feigned
the most virtuous indignation at her success. We
need hardly say that he was one of the most distinguished 
moral guardians of social ethics in his generation. 
At the same time, it is only fair to state that
he did it solely in the interests of a music-hall, in
which he had privately invested some fifteen years'
earnings on a highly moral and religious serial, and
the proceeds of a pen, which had been also for a still
longer period devoted to writing a certain species of
biographical works and social sketches for the book-sellers 
in Holywell-street, Strand. It must be said
for him that he did everything with an eye to business. 
He had no heart, no feeling, no sympathy,
and apparently no bias. Literature to him was mere
copy furnished by a facile talent, according to price
and demand. Nor is this the only remarkable instance 
of literary versatility which has come under
our notice, although in its peculiar phase of depravity
and successful hypocrisy, it stood perhaps alone.</p>

<p>We once knew a gentleman who wrote an account
of prize-fights for a well-known sporting paper, and
the most orthodox articles for a Church Review
of ponderous celebrity, at one and the same time.
He kept a rusty black suit and a relay of "white

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

chokers" at the office of the sporting paper, wherewith 
to indue his outer man for the discharge of
his more sacred calling. He was the first specimen
of "muscular Christianity" with whom it fell to our
lot to become acquainted, and a very worthy fellow
he was, with a large wife and small family dependent
upon his intellectual exertions. A bishop in the
grooves of prosperity is one thing, and a dog-stealer
out of luck is another, and there is a great worldly,
if not unworldly difference between them; but if
they have both of them children whom they maintain,
wives whom they love, and parents whom after their
individual fashion they cherish or honour, there is a
wonderful magnetic chain of sympathy which unites
their hearts. None can say where the bishop ends
and the poodle-abstracter begins, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.
Which is the greater libeller, ourselves thus generalising, 
or a modern novelist of a different school
describing the minutest thoughts and incidents of
the episcopal inner life? Strip the earthly mean and
great to the buff, and what are they? Let all mankind 
bathe together, and scramble for the clothes!</p>

<p>When the British public is entertained by an
actress, or for some reason or other more especially
a great vocalist of the fair sex, it is singularly tolerant
of scandal. It actually deifies immorality, personified
in a songstress. If she happens to be a foreigner, her
very vices enter into household conversational stock,
from a bishop's palace to a back parlour in Bloomsbury. 
Materfamilias, who would drive away a
servant-girl to perish in the streets for the slightest
exhibition of levity, thinks nothing of asking if "la

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

diva" is still living with the last nobleman or male
dancer she "ran away" with, while that model of
propriety, Miss Clementina Popham, of Cadogan-place, 
Belgravia, and Bournemouth (it was formerly
Gravesend which she patronised) inquires if that
dear, wicked, handsome Pollio, the <i>primo tenore</i> of
the season, has broken the last <i>amourette</i>&mdash;in which
the upper and middle circles of Society take such a
lively interest.</p>

<p>Some such thoughts as these may have passed
through the little racer-like head of the petted young
actress, as she looked at the timepiece, which represented 
an unlucky Cupid just caught in the clutches
of the fell Destroyer, while chasing a butterfly lit
upon a full-blown rose with malachite leaves. "How
late he is," she poutingly murmured; "but it is no
use being angry with him. I dare say his excuses
will be as amusing as ever. That man could not be
in time, if he were intrusted with a reprieve for his
dearest friend, who was left for execution." At that
moment the door opened, and the servant announced
Sir Harry Luckless.</p>

<p>That individual approached with a comic expression
of regret on his handsome Irish face.</p>

<p>"Upon my honour&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Upon your honour, sir, I really don't know if
I shall accept your apologies. Come, shall I make
your excuses for you? You were on your way,
when you met an old friend who just wanted your
name for a month to a bill, an 'oblong' as you
foolish creatures call it, to save his credit, as if he
had any to save, and you couldn't help obliging him,

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

and there was not a place where they sell stamps
handy, and then you just went into the 'Rag' for
five minutes to write it, and met young Snaffles of
the 141st, who wanted you to look at his new mare,
and then you got talking about racing, and made a
bet or two, and you forgot to wind up your watch,
and didn't know the time&mdash;of course there are no
clocks in the club&mdash;and then you took the very slowest
cab that you ever rode in. There, you see I know
all about it. Don't say a word more. I forgive you.
You can't help it. Now, have you seen to all my
little affairs? Not one I dare say."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have!" said Sir Harry; "the man says
he must keep Topsy a fortnight longer at least. He
thinks it is distemper."</p>

<p>"And the harness?" inquired the lady.</p>

<p>"Will be ready on Tuesday. Wheeler and Biffin
had to send to Paris for the bells."</p>

<p>"And the opera box?" she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Sams has kept his word. He could have had
double the money this morning."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, and did you give the money I told
you to those poor people?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry assented.</p>

<p>"Yourself?" she continued.</p>

<p>"Never was in such a place in my life&mdash;wasn't
comfortable till I had a bath after, and changed my
clothes&mdash;gave them to my groom, 'pon honour. What
a strange girl you are, to send a fellow on such an
errand. How do you know I will not get a fever?
But you are such a dear insinuating creature that I

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

couldn't refuse you, if you asked me to live a week
in the Seven Dials."</p>

<p>A shade passed over the lady's face. "What did
the old man say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Egad!" cried the baronet, "he was so astonished
that he said nothing at first. He cried like a child,
and then kissed a lot of little dirty imps that came
running in to his call from all the surrounding
gutters. You told me on no account to say whence
the money and things came, and so he called me an
angel sent by a saint of heaven, or a saint sent by
an angel, I forget which. Faith! if I'm a saint, I'm
the first Luckless that was ever canonised. But you
are an angel, you know, and I expect some night or
other to see you fly right away, to that old rascal
Methusalem's astonishment, through the ceiling of
the theatre, leaving nothing but unpaid milliners
bills and broken hearts behind you."</p>

<p>"I'll have you to know, sir, that I don't owe a
milliners bill in London. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Then," quoth Sir Harry, "they give longer credit
in Paris than I fancied, that's all."</p>

<p>"Bless the man! I don't believe he ever paid
ready money for anything in his life," said the lady;
"unless, indeed, it might be a tavern dinner or a
turnpike. But, tell me, did you not feel happier for
the good you did, and the enjoyment you bestowed
on that old man and those poor children? Did you
not feel that you had done something in this world
better than winning a match at billiards, or a bet on
the Derby?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

<p>"Well, upon my word," said Sir Harry, "I did
feel a kind of satisfaction as I came away; and I
really think if I had the money, I should like to do
that sort of thing, now and then, you know. I never
saw an old fellow in such ecstasies for a 'fiver.' "</p>

<p>"Five pounds! You did not give him five? I
only told you two," she said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sir Harry, "didn't you? I forgot.
But I hadn't change, and, upon my word, I thought
if you gave something, I might as well do the same,
you know. I was deucedly lucky the other day&mdash;won
fifty on Charity."</p>

<p>"Then I've half a mind not to pay my two pounds,"
rejoined the actress. "Here they are, however.
Nay, I insist; and what is more, I shall not make you
my almoner again, if you do such extravagant things.
Look after your own poor people, sir, and don't interfere 
with mine. I've half a mind to be very angry
with you."</p>

<p>"You are the oddest girl in the world, and I don't
care where the other comes from." observed Sir Harry,
twirling his moustache. "But what could a fellow
do, if you will send him to such places? It's all
very well for Mademoiselle Floret to tell you of them,
but you should just see once for yourself."</p>

<p>"Did you see to the fresh groundsel for the birds?"
asked the deity of the Thespis, quite suddenly.</p>

<p>"The people in Covent Garden will send an old
man whom they know, regularly. Now, there's a
fancy! As if your servants couldn't get it any hour
in the streets."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

<p>"Oh! if you think so much of the trouble, I won't
ask you another time. I tell you I'm very fond of
my birds. When I was a poor girl, I would walk
miles on a Sunday to fetch something green for my
feathered prisoner, to whom I could not afford a
comfortable cage."</p>

<p>"That was when you were at school, I suppose?"
asked Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"At school! yes, at school with a very stern
mistress. We did not have too much to eat, I can
tell you," was the remark of the actress.</p>

<p>"You had an excellent French master, at any
rate," said Luckless. "Count Adolphe de Mareuse
tells me that your accent is perfect."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, with a little laugh, "I learnt that
entirely at a finishing school. I was speaking of my
early days."</p>

<p>"What was the name of the place where you were
treated so badly; was it an old-fashioned establishment?"</p>

<p>"Very," she replied, answering the last question
first. "We called it the Rookery."</p>

<p>"In Yorkshire?"</p>

<p>"No! no! in Middlesex. But come," she added,
"I hate talking of my school-days. You have done
pretty well, sir, and may stay half an hour longer,
and talk with me, before the bears and monkeys are
out. My animals of the Zoological Gardens come to
see me, instead of my going to visit them, except on
Sundays, you know, when an especial ticket is required."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

<p>Let us change the style of our dialogue. As we
have not introduced the lady by name, we will call
them, after a late example, Lui et Elle.</p>

<p>LUI. And pray, what animal am I?</p>

<p>ELLE. Oh, you? None at all; a sort of Irish
stag-hound, only they don't fetch and carry, you
know.</p>

<p>LUI. I suppose I must take that for a compliment.</p>

<p>ELLE. I should think so, indeed. You should hear
what some of them are in my catalogue.</p>

<p>LUI. Tell me.</p>

<p>ELLE. Not now. Let's think of anything else.
Tell me some news.</p>

<p>LUI. Well, the whole town is ringing with your
exploits; but you know that.</p>

<p>ELLE. The town is easily astonished.</p>

<p>LUI. You are more and more the rage, I can
assure you. Royalty itself does not name a larger
medley of articles&mdash;hats, cloaks, boots, carriages, and
harness, parasols, driving-whips, toast-racks, soap and
perfumery, jackets, crimping machines for the hair,
crinolines, cotelettes&mdash;they are all called by your
name. And there is a new photographic portrait out
every morning.</p>

<p>ELLE. Have you seen that one of me on the white
Arab?</p>

<p>LUI. I should rather think I have. It is as <i>r&eacute;pandu</i>
as "Mappin Brothers," which nearly drives
me distracted, in the Hansom cabs. But how do you
manage so many escapades in a week?</p>

<p>ELLE. Why, my dear friend, only one-half has any
foundation in truth, as you must know, and that

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

half is pretty sufficiently embroidered, and then I
never contradict the <i>on dits</i>.</p>

<p>LUI. You would have enough to do, though I'm
not sure if people wouldn't believe them all the more
readily.</p>

<p>ELLE. When I read in the "Court Twaddler,"
that I horsewhipped a coal-heaver and a brace of
noblemen, broke a bank at Baden, passed myself off
as a bishop's daughter, and ended by throwing a Jew
millionaire out of the window&mdash;what does it matter?
That moral humbug, the Public, is by turns shocked
and amused, and the daughters of propriety and
decorum wear their dresses higher or lower, and trim
their dresses according to any whim and fancy, with
greater zeal and industry than ever. I think of
coming out as a Quakeress next, and I will wager a
dinner at Richmond, that half a score of duchesses,
fifty peeresses, and commoners without end, will
appear in drab and poke bonnets within a week.</p>

<p>LUI. Ha! ha! why don't you ally yourself with
the wholesale houses in the City, and get five per
cent, on the profits of every new fashion?</p>

<p>ELLE. Such a suggestion is worthy of Manchester.</p>

<p>LUI. Positively you are a wonder&mdash;the marvel of
the age. Oh! if you were only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>ELLE. What?</p>

<p>LUI (<i>Confused</i>). Nothing, nothing, I assure you.
I don't know what I was about to say.</p>

<p>ELLE. Don't be mean, Sir Harry; speak the truth.
I know what you would have said.</p>

<p>LUI. I meant as careful of your reputation, as you
are fascinating.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

<p>ELLE. What then?</p>

<p>LUI. You might marry any one you pleased.</p>

<p>ELLE (<i>With flashing eyes</i>). Listen! Had any
one else dared to insinuate what you so nearly said
just now, I would have served him as I am reputed
to have done the Jew millionaire. Do you think I
<i>can't</i> marry whom I please? Do you think reputation, 
as you call it, necessary to enable a woman like
me to marry? Why, it is just <i>my</i> reputation, such as
it is, that I should marry on. I am supposed to be a
Siren, who ruins fools. And yet my secrets and my
sins are only known to myself. Society furnishes
me even with vices out of its decorous imagination.
Ha! ha! And do you think I could not make one
fool the more, if I pleased? And suppose, sir, for
the sake of argument, that I am not virtuous? Suppose 
that I despise virtue? Why do these prim
gentlewomen imitate me? Why is vice, as you are
pleased to call it&mdash;yes, you, reckless libertine as you
are&mdash;their study and their model? I tell you that
I only know and recognise virtue as the selfish institution 
of you men, whose very contact ought to be
spurned by true innocence. I only know it, I say,
by the awkward imitation of my follies, and by the
cant and uncharitableness that it evokes.</p>

<p>LUI. Don't be so vehement: one would think you
were acting something.</p>

<p>ELLE. Virtue! Yes, in forced marriages and prudential 
motives. Suppose I were to speak, as many
a girl in my position doubtless could. Suppose I
said to you, "Man, I never was virtuous. I never
knew virtue, never saw it, never felt it. It was not

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

in the workhouse where I was born, possibly of a
'noble' father and an erring mother. It was not
in my academy of the gutter, or the low lodging-houses 
where I was dragged up. It was not in the
bricklayer's field, where I first listened to the voice of
a rustic betrayer. Ha! ha! Not in the gaol to which
I was once consigned, ignorant at least of the imputed 
offence which sent me thither. What do I
owe virtue? Plenty of cheap tracts, and a Bible,
which I could not even pawn; but not bread, nor
care, nor clothes, not love, nor Christian sympathy,
nor a home." How dare you talk to me of virtue,
wretched libertine that you are? Away! Do not
pollute the air with your false breath prating to me
of virtue, I say.</p>

<p>LUI. I did not say a word about it. Pray, are you
coming out as a trag&eacute;dienne? Is this out of a new
sensation play? What a strange, funny girl you
are!</p>

<p>ELLE. Yes, yes! Old Methusalem of the Thespis
declares that melodrama is my forte. I thought I
would give you a specimen of my powers. <i>Changeons
tout cel&agrave;</i>. Has my Lord Cheltenham given up his
little Agapemone in the Grove of the Evangelist,
since he took the chair at the anniversary dinner of
the Society for the Promotion of Morality among the
Feejees?</p>

<p>LUI. Come, come. There is one thing quite sure.
You have much more good in you than you like to
own. Don't pretend any wickedness to me. I don't
believe in it. My opinion is that you are the best
and noblest little creature in the world. And talking

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

of that, I want especially to appeal to your better
nature. Do you know you are doing sad mischief in
a certain quarter?</p>

<p>ELLE. I should rather think I am, in a good
many. To destroy the peace of families is the reparation 
I ask for giving my inventive faculties such
constant exercise. Look at this! (<i>Puts on a flower-pot 
hat</i>.) Is this a stroke of genius?</p>

<p>LUI. Most bewitchingly frightful, indeed. Rotten
Row will look as if its fair visitants had made a razzia
on the Botanical Gardens, and robbed their exotic
beauties of their temporary dwelling-places, the
earthen pots. It only wants a green veil and a hole
in the top for ventilation. Why the women's brains
will actually sprout. But do be quiet for one moment. 
You know Arthur Aubrey?</p>

<p>ELLE. Know him? I promised to drive his horses
in the Park this very afternoon; but he shows such
desperate eagerness to keep his appointments that I
invariably break mine.</p>

<p>LUI. Well, now. I want you to cut him altogether.</p>

<p>ELLE. Upon my word, sir. Ha! ha! If you are
coming out in the jealous line, I shall positively be
denied to you altogether.</p>

<p>LUI. Nonsense! Listen. This man, who is acting
so absurd a part, has an angel for his wife. If she
hears of his running after you it will break her heart.</p>

<p>ELLE. Break <i>what?</i></p>

<p>LUI. Her heart, I said.</p>

<p>ELLE. More idiot she. Why, the man follows me
like a shadow.</p>

<p>LUI. Call her what you please; you do not, cannot

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

think it. And though I may provoke your laughter,
I will appeal to your friendship for myself. I love
her myself.</p>

<p>ELLE. YOU? (<i>With darkening face and apart to
herself</i>.) And he tells me this!</p>

<p>LUI. With a love of which you can form no possible 
conception.</p>

<p>ELLE. Of which I can form no possible conception! 
(<i>With a small shrill laugh.</i>) Of course not.
How should I? Except on the stage, you know.
Well, so you want me to lure this person's husband
more completely into my toils? Well, well, for so
great a friend as you are, Harry, I will do it.</p>

<p>LUI. No! no! You mistake me utterly. I want
you, on the contrary, to decline his lightest attentions, 
to repel him with scorn, never to suffer him to
speak to you again. But do not, I implore you,
mistake me. Were he dead, she could never be
mine; never belong to any one save to the man who
is so utterly unworthy of her, and who now follows
you with such desperate infatuation.</p>

<p>ELLE. What bad taste! To desert this paragon,
and to follow me. Don't you wonder at his choice?
But I say, Harry, what fun! Only fancy you
sentimentally in love. What confidence you must
have in my honour and principle, to feel assured I
shall not tell such an excellent joke to all our acquaintance.</p>

<p>LUI. Do you know that accomplished, exquisitely
beautiful as she is, this deserted wife, is blind? Yes,
within this last few weeks, that calamity has overtaken 
her. She weeps at home in darkness.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

<p>ELLE. There, there, that will do. Am I to keep
virtuous folks straight? Am I to restore married
couples to their duty, and snivel out, "Bless you, be
happy!" What is this Mrs. Aubrey to me? As for
him, all I know is that I dislike the fellow, and that
he bores me. It seems that he is a mean, heartless
scamp. I suppose, therefore, that <i>I</i> ought to love
him. But I have no power to send him to the penitentiary, 
or what might be worse, to the loving arms
of his precious wife. And what claim has she on
me? Would she move her little finger to save me
from the grave, or worse? Besides, you silly fellow,
do you think he would not find some one else to
make love to, if I declined his precious homage? I
tell you I hate her, I hate him, I hate you, and all
your selfish sex.</p>

<p>LUI. Now do be quiet, there's a dear good girl.</p>

<p>ELLE. I will trouble you to ring the bell. I want
my lunch. I am not like these artificial minxes who
gormandise in their bed-chambers, and can eat no
dinner, poor things! I am as hungry as a hunter.
(<i>Aside</i>.) I thought if there was any one in the
world whom he loved it was myself. (<i>Sighs</i>.) But
no matter! (<i>Aloud</i>.) You are spoony on a blind
woman, are you? You shall take me to the Park,
and point her out. She can't see us, you know.</p>

<p>LUI (<i>Shaking his head</i>). She is never there.
Don't be a monster, Kitty!</p>

<p>ELLE. I am determined to see her somehow; and
when I am determined, you know&mdash;&mdash; By-the-bye,
is this your forty-ninth or fiftieth pure attachment,
Harry? (<i>Dancing a few steps and humming a popular

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

air.</i>) Do you know what Madame Claudine says of
my dancing? Oh! I wanted to tell you of my
answer to that odious young wretch, Master Robert
Dupe Postobit. Because, forsooth, I am on the
stage, he thought he might insult me by the offer of
an "establishment," as it is called; whereupon he
came here, the ignorant, impudent young monkey,
and laid his heart and fortune at my feet. I was
considering what I should do&mdash;whether I should
horsewhip him myself or not&mdash;when he wound up by
saying that he is very short of ready money just now;
but will have twenty thousand pounds a-year when
his old dad, Sir Robert, is turfed; an event which
he strongly suggested would come off very speedily.
This gave me the cue. I heard him out with the
most polite attention, and then rang the bell.
"Floret," said I, "show the young gentleman to the
door, and mind you don't admit him again, until his
father dies."</p>

<p>LUI. I heard, in addition, that you threw his hat
out of the window.</p>

<p>ELLE. The inventive faculties of Society are decidedly 
slow.</p>

<p>Here the pair were interrupted by the entrance of
Floret, who announced "Mr. Aubrey."</p>

<p>"It's the gentleman," she said, "who has called so
many times lately, and he says that you expect him
by appointment."</p>

<p>"Do I, indeed?" said her mistress. "Then I
suppose he must come in. Oh! pray, don't go away.
Sir Harry. We have no secrets."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you have or not," was the

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

somewhat sullen reply; "but I can't endure the
fellow, and wish to go."</p>

<p>"Stay five minutes, I tell you," said the actress.
"Here, Floret, tell Lacy to come in shortly. My
sheep-dog, you know. Her attendance is a homage
which I pay to propriety, in return for the many
which propriety bestows on me, you observe."</p>

<p>"Incorrigible girl!" said Sir Harry, after a pause,
when Floret had left the room. "I cannot think
you are in earnest, after what I have told you."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Then you shall see," was the lady's
rejoinder, as Floret re-entered and announced Mr.
Arthur Aubrey.</p>

<p>Sir Harry took up his hat, and bit his lip in
silence.</p>

<p>WHO and what was this <i>d&eacute;butante</i> on the boards
of the Thespis, this Siren who entranced the <i>jeunesse</i>
and the <i>vieillesse dor&eacute;e</i> of London with her follies and
fascinations, her feats of horsewomanship and reckless 
escapades? Who was this creature of the demimonde, 
who set fashions to peeresses and their

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

daughters, whom duchesses sought to imitate, and
whose mode of dress and even deportment panting
Respectability laboured always at a respectable distance 
to attain? We can only impart such knowledge,
as a random collection of <i>on dits</i> and anecdotes picked
up at the Clubs and across the railings in Hyde Park,
enables us to furnish. She was known to the world
as Kitty Dareall; and her appearance driving a pair
of thoroughbreds in the Park, first attracted attention,
rather less than a year before the period we introduced 
our readers to her in the last chapter. Since
then her career had been brilliant and wonderful,
rapid as the pace of her coursers, meteoric as the
gleam of her tresses floating in the wind, as she
dashed past the admiring crowd of men, not women,
who were loud in her praises; for her own sex copied,
but did not praise or admire her. It was known that
she had been <i>en pension</i> at a somewhat expensive
seminary in Paris, and that she had some aristocratic
friends during the eighteen months or thereabouts
which she passed there, including two or three ladies
of high rank.</p>

<p>The eccentric Mrs. Grewsome, wife of the great
Latin historian and M.P., was wont to patronise her,
and took Sir Bullfrog Leapfrog there, to admire the
progress she made. He was profuse in his admiration 
of her small classical head; and would soon have
exhausted all the capital letters in a moderately-sized
printing establishment, had it been called on suddenly
to set up in type the expressions of his extravagant
encomia. Then there was the strong-minded but
good and pure-hearted Lady Tredarno, who called

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

her a "gifted being," and an "intellectual marvel."
"Full of feeling and talent," she would say, "and so
natural. Quite a study, my dear."</p>

<p>Once, and once only, when our young friend had
been in Paris some ten months, a lady and gentleman 
called, who evidently took a great interest in her
fate. They had just arrived from the West Indies,
and the gentleman seemed deeply suffering from ill
health. He appeared in the capacity of her guardian.
Young, noble, and amiable, this couple seemed to
lavish on her every attention, which was met with an
earnest respect and dutiful homage by the mysterious
young stranger, who evidently entertained towards
them the strongest sentiments of veneration and love.
After a few weeks, however, the young lord and his
wife&mdash;for such was their rank&mdash;returned to England:
thence, as it was said, to sail again for the West
Indian colony, of which he was governor. They wrote
every week; and then at last there came a pause, and
then a letter with a black seal, and an enclosure, not
from him or from her. They and their infant child had
died within a week; he of consumption, and the wife
of fatigue and fever consequent upon watching and
grief. The young lady at the seminary assumed a
garb of the deepest mourning, which did not belie
her feelings and her heart. She mourned over their
loss intensely for a short time, and then suddenly
her whole demeanour changed. She who had been
so gentle and retiring became brusque, reckless, and
undisciplined in her manner and behaviour. She
seemed as if she had suddenly thrown off a mask of
piety and decorum, and was careless of opinion or

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

remark. Though, in one sense, her conduct was
irreproachable, as she did not give the slightest cause
for scandal with any one of the opposite sex; yet she
not only utterly disregarded her religious duties and
observances, to which she had been wedded before,
but seemed to lose, together with faith and hope, all
care for worldly approbation or censure. Cold and
reserved as she had previously been, she now grew
flighty and talkative. A sort of perilous desperation
seemed to have seized upon her. Both teachers and
pupils were amazed at the change which came over
the reserved and silent English girl. Her masters of
music and dancing, who had before only noted her
amazing progress, and set it down to her studious
habits as well as natural genius, were now perfectly
amazed by the airs which she assumed.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, since the death of her
beloved guardian and his wife, she took the utmost
interest in theatrical matters. About ten months
more passed thus, when she suddenly announced her
determination to leave and proceed to England. As
no one appeared to exercise any control over her,
there was no opposition offered. The music-master
made her a declaration of love, and the dancing-master 
offered her his hand and name. She laughed
at both alike. From the remittances she received,
she paid the amount which she was indebted to the
mistress of the seminary, and took her departure
alone, deeply regretted by some, an object of hatred
to others, and of wonder and speculation to all.</p>

<p>Who was this young girl, thus launched upon the
world alone; so self-possessed and confident, so delicate 

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

in appearance and yet so strong, so shadowed
by grief and yet so gay and almost defiant in
manner? It was an enigma which none there could
solve. The young Englishwoman had made no bosom
friends, no confidantes, at the finishing institution at
Le Valois, Paris. When she arrived there, no one
could make her out at all. She had more the air of
a nun who had passed through her novitiate, than of
a young parlour-boarder who had still to make her
way in the world. Her progress in mental culture
was, as we have intimated, something marvellous.
But the oddest part was that in the short time she
spent there, she seemed to grow so much younger
that it fairly puzzled them all. She evidently throve
on the new diet and climate, and to the most remarkable 
extent. Instead of making her pale, constant
study seemed to impart bloom to her cheek. M.
Th&eacute;ophile Maillard, the handsome young drawing-master, 
from whom she did not take lessons, declared
that she devoured the roses in the garden, where she
used to walk for hours intent upon her books. Being
a lady-killer, he once ventured to slip a billet into her
hand. She took it, and read it, and said:</p>

<p>"But what is this, then, sir? I have no maid-servant; 
if I had, I scarcely know if I could permit
the addresses of a bad subject. As it is, I shall not
be very angry at a jest this one time."</p>

<p>And she returned his scented billet with a low,
mocking <i>r&eacute;v&eacute;rence</i>, which nearly drove M. Th&eacute;ophile
to a supper at the Maison d'Or, regardless of expense,
and "charcoal for one" afterwards.</p>

<p>But what was the mystery of this young person?

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

Why was the almost religious enthusiast, the amateur
nun of the establishment, transformed into a creature
of wayward worldliness and wild <i>insouciance</i> thus
suddenly, on the death of those to whom she was
apparently so ardently attached? It was as if with
their funeral obsequies, the tragedy of her life had
ended and its comedy begun. We do not speak of
the first month or six weeks of absolute prostration
and sorrow. But was this real? Or was she a
demure sinner, a sly hypocrite suddenly emancipated
from thraldom by their unexpected demise?</p>

<p>Let us follow her to the solitude of her chamber;
let us hear what she says at night to herself, as she
sits looking vacantly into the past, or questions herself 
of the present and future. She has evidently
lost some great end and object of existence. She is
like a vessel adrift, dragging her anchor and n earing
a mighty quicksand.</p>

<p>"They are dead and gone," she cried; "for whose
sakes I believed in all&mdash;the justice of Providence and
the goodness of mankind. What have I to live for
now? They have perished in their beautiful youth;
he so noble, so calm, so brave, and generous; she
so lovely and devoted to him. Even their little child
too. All are gone. There is no trace left of them
in this world. What should I do, who only lived
through and for them, whose sole recompense was in
their smiles of approval, whose sole encouragement
was in their kind and sympathetic words? I should
go mad, if I were to live this dull life of discipline
long, without object or reward. Nor have I the

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

means. Sainted angels! look down and forgive me;
for I was not worthy of your care!"</p>

<p>Then she would weep, but not pray, as had been her
wont; and sit thinking far into the night, until her
brain was nearly crazed with conflicting thoughts and
emotions. Gradually, however, these wailings of a
tortured spirit became less frequent; and more worldly
longings and fancies re-entered and took possession
of her soul. She became, if possible, more than ever
devoted to her studies.</p>

"I have but a short time to remain," she mused;
"my money will but barely last out till midsummer
here, and then give me a fair start in London, say of
a twelvemonth, to obtain a footing on the stage&mdash;yes, 
that must be my career. Mrs. Grewsome and
Lady Tredarno will assist me, I know. I must never
be poor again. No, I would rather die than endure
that horrible, that loathsome poverty! I could not
now. I wonder what would have been my fate, had
my benefactors lived. But I never seemed to think
or to care, whilst they were alive: I only cared to
satisfy them. And now I am alone, utterly alone.
But I will triumph; I will be rich and powerful.
Pardon me, ye bright angels!" (And she would fling
open her window and lean out; gazing on the glittering 
heraldry of Time, as if the stars were interested 
parties in the troubled repentance or resolve
of every murky little human brain.) "Pardon me,
you know what I was and am! For you, I would
have been anything that you wished or thought fit.
But you are gone, and what does it matter now?

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

You will never smile on me any more; never reward
me with even a look. Heaven knows how little
worthy I ever was of your pains. But I would have
laid down my worthless life for yours, could I have
done so, and shown at least that the poor girl whom
you rescued from want was not ungrateful. I would
die now, if I knew it would please you; but forgive
me if I seek to fight the world again with its own
weapons. Some day, for your sakes, I may do some
good action, who knows? I may help some miserable 
creatures, if I become rich. 'Rich!' yes, that
is it. Sir Bullfrog said that I was born for the stage;
and he is a great man. And Mrs. Grewsome, too,
she has great influence. In my sleep last night,
I dreamt I was poor again. I thought a lank and
ghastly Form seized me, and shrieked in my ears, 'I
am WANT, and I come to claim my prey. You are
mine!' I thought he dragged me through filthy
streets and alleys into a dreadful house with broken
windows; for all the world like those in the corner
of Stamford-street, in the Blackfriars-road. Up a
dusty staircase with cobwebs that clung round me
like bits of floating crape hanging from the ceilings
and walls, into a squalid garret with a pallet bed and
a broken chair, where he left me shivering with cold
and fright, until I awoke screaming aloud, 'Want!
Want!' It was once no dream. Anything, anything, 
save that! I dare not, will not be poor again.
I have money enough to maintain me, until I can
carry out my plans. If I fail, I will die; but never
be poor again!"</p>

<p>A few months after, a young lady, richly but elegantly 

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

attired, took her departure in the Boulogne
packet for Folkestone. Strangely enough, there was
no less a personage on board than the great Methusalem 
Wigster, on his return from Paris to his
theatrical duties, with two or three of the latest and
most successful French dramas duly adapted for the
English stage in his portmanteau, a cigar in his
mouth, a glass of brandy-and-water in his hand, and
mighty thoughts revolving in his brain, as to the
precise amount of indecency, immorality, and blasphemy, 
that a British audience would not only stand,
but applaud, and the exact shape in which it should
be administered. As the shores of France receded,
an occasional grin intensified the perpetual smile
which he wore off the stage, as naturally as, and even
more constantly than, his wig or false teeth, since
we believe that he left off these to sleep. He was
thinking of his forthcoming announcement in large
posters of "La Dame Potiphar," a piece which had
just created a great sensation in the French capital.
In this drama the character of Joseph assumed a
completely novel and French complexion. He was
not only guilty, as any co-respondent of the Divorce
Court need be; but he cherished a sublime affection
for Pharaoh's only daughter. It was to conceal the
evidence of her mother's guilt that he sacrificed the
chief butler of his royal master. "La Dame Potiphar" 
turned out a great success; while the astute
Methusalem duly at times, when returning thanks at
a dramatic dinner, or making a beautiful speech
about almshouses for decayed actors, lamented the
decline of the British drama with a vicious twinkle

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

in either optic, which was delightful to observe.
There, however, he was, like a jolly old dramatic
bagman chuckling over the proceeds of a successful
trip, with "La Dame Potiphar" in his valise, cheaply
translated by a dramatic (!) newspaper critic, and a
charming piece besides, ready cut and dried, in which
a heroic brother sacrifices the reputation of his sister
in order to save the credit of his adored one with her
rich husband. She has a husband, of course, or it
would not do for a moral audience.</p>

<p>Before the packet reached Folkestone, our adventuress&mdash;for 
such we must call her&mdash;made such an
impression upon Methusalem, that he actually promised 
her an engagement on their arrival in town.
It was found, however, necessary, that she should
devote at least a year to study; for which purpose
she took apartments in Soho-square, which soon became 
the scene of fashionable reunions, where the
number of gentlemen greatly predominated over
that of ladies. For a time Mrs. Grewsome and Lady
Tredarno continued to patronise the young actress,
and the former actually planned a match or two for
her intellectual wonder; one with a middle-aged
baronet, and the other with a rising barrister in the
Temple. If these matches fell through, it was not in
either instance the gentleman's fault. This greatly
annoyed Mrs. Grewsome, who ceased to visit her
proteg&eacute;e; and in turn Lady Tredarno found that her
"strange girl" was becoming far too conspicuous
and too fast. No one could breathe a word of actual
slander, and probably there was no reason for it.
Sir Harry Luckless was the only gentleman visitor

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

admitted to anything like familiarity. But the
"world" could not explain how an actress <i>in posse</i>
could have horses, and equipages, and jewellery, and
an apparently inexhaustible wardrobe. So her female
acquaintances were confined to third and fourth rate
actresses, and the companionship of her "sheep
dog," as she called her, the discreet Lacy, a gentlewoman 
who was said to be the widow of an officer,
and she was too, and of a sheriff to boot, i.e., a
sheriff's officer, who left her a very small income and
an "honourable" name. Gradually, Miss Dareall's
vivacity outstepped all bounds of decorum; she became 
the most celebrated, or at least notorious,
demirep in the metropolis. But let it, again and
again, be fully understood that no one had any positive 
charge to make against her conduct. A very
Diana in the chase, it must be owned that she did
not merit a reputation quite as spotless as that of
the goddess. She courted and defied calumny; and
not a woman in London but was ready to return a
verdict of guilty against her, and to state cases without 
end. Only a few men, and these among the most
profligate on town, recorded their belief in her innocence. 
Mr. Stingray declared that she lived on the
testimonials to virtue volunteered by her eager crowd
of rich and aristocratic admirers. Certain it is, that
any wealthy old, or young fellow, was only too proud
to be her banker. Noblemen and commoners vied
with each other in their anxiety to anticipate her
most extravagant fancies, and execute her costliest
commissions. It was generally considered that, as
soon as she had been a sufficient time on the stage to

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

be married from it, she intended to make a brilliant
alliance and enter the ranks of the ennobled actresses
of England. There is no doubt that she need not
have waited for this. Had her actions been flagrantly
immoral, it would scarcely have diminished her chance
of "marrying well." A Criminal Court and an accusation 
of murder have furnished an interesting young
lady prisoner with an excellent matrimonial advertisement, 
ere now. The wonderful assurance and exploits
of Miss Kate Darrell, which caused her to be called
"Kitty Dareall," her dress, her style, her racy "sayings 
and doings," including some repartees and practical 
jokes which convulsed all London with laughter;
the new fashions which she set, and the old which
she put down, with imperious, if not imperial, authority, 
rendered the sketch which Sir Harry Luckless
submitted to her own view, and which we recorded
in the previous chapter of this eventful history, by no
means either a caricature or an exaggeration.</p>

<p>And is it possible that this being, gifted as she undoubtedly 
was for good or for evil, could, within the
short space of three years, have risen from the lowest
depths of human degradation to her questionable pre-eminence? 
All that we can say is, that it was not only
possible, but true. Nor does the case stand by any
means alone. We know of a more recent one at
this moment, which strikingly resembles in many of
its details that which we have endeavoured to narrate
in these pages.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">A DUCAL PHILANTHROPIST.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Never since "the year one" of modern fashionable life was such an
audience gathered in the pit of this elegant little Parisian theatre.
Duke shouldered marquis, and ambassadors trod on the toes of royal and
imperial princes. The lovely d&eacute;butante appeared as Dan&auml;e, in the
"Proverbe" of Alphonse de Crapaudet, "P&egrave;re qui perd et fille qui file,"
since adapted by one of our most popular burlesque writers, and about
to be produced at the Theatre Royal St. Holywell, under the title of
"A Crisis in the Affairs of Acrisius." Her costume nearly approached
that of Innocence itself. The Duke of * * * offered fifty thousand
francs the next day for the satin boots she wore on the occasion.&mdash;<i>From 
the Fashionable Intelligence</i> (<i>for British wives and daughters</i>) <i>of
the</i> "<i>Court Twaddler</i>."</p>

<p>WE left Miss Dareall and Sir Harry Luckless
expecting the entrance of Mr. Aubrey. That gentleman 
and Mrs. Lacy very speedily made their appearance.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear Mr. Aubrey," said Miss Dareall; "I'm
so delighted to see you. You called before, I think;
both yesterday and the day before?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Arthur, between whom and Sir
Harry a very stiff salute had passed, "I have called
several times, but not been fortunate enough to find
you; you are so very much occupied with your various
engagements."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

<p>"I am very busy indeed," she said. "I have to
attend a rehearsal every other day now."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And what, may I ask, is the name of
the new piece?" inquired Aubrey. "I presume it is
a burlesque?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the actress. "It is called
'Fayre Rosamond.' "</p>

<p>"I need not ask what part you take," said
Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am the charming favourite, of course," she
replied. "The scene is laid at Rosherville Gardens,
and I am poisoned with South African sherry, after a
pas de deux with Queen Eleanor, and an egg-dance to
myself. If I don't break an egg, my jealous rival
agrees to spare my life, on condition that I am apprenticed 
to a religious sewing-machine establishment at
Haggerstone, and consent to leave off crinoline and
cut off my back hair. A wily page in the King's service 
boils the eggs hard, and I am on the point of
embracing the alternative, when the Queen unluckily
takes it into her head to make some egg-flip on the spot,
and discovers the ruse. Furious at the discovery, she
rushes at me with a carving-knife and a wine-glass of
the dreadful mixture. I drink it, and sink insensible
on the stage, as the King comes in disguised as a
market-gardener. There is a grand <i>pas d'&eacute;claircissement</i>, 
during which I recover, join in a Scotch reel,
and the King proposes to abdicate, and that all three
should emigrate to Utah. An exquisite scene of the
valley of the Great Salt Lake succeeds. The forty
wives of Brigham Young are discovered wheeling
forty double perambulators, with an advertisement of

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

an establishment for the sale of those street nuisances
in Soho-square. The perambulators are all doubled
up, and turn into models of Chinese baby-towers, and
a general dance of the whole corps de ballet concludes
the piece. What do you think of that? Isn't it
charming?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Aubrey, dryly. "I know not whether
to admire most, the good taste or sense of such a
performance. I believe a burlesque writer of the
present day would parody the Massacre of St. Bartholomew 
or the Crucifixion itself, or even that of the
Innocents."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the opera of the 'Flood,' by the
great French composer, what's his name?" asked
Sir Harry. "Shem's wife has a lover, who follows
the slow-sailing ark by means of a swimming-belt,
and is hidden in the hold. He finally escapes in the
disguise of a male ape whom he killed on board, and
so lost a whole branch of the great Simian family to
the world."</p>

<p>"Not I," said Miss Dareall. "I am told that
there is a wonderful rain effect produced in the overture 
by pouring sackfuls of dry peas on the big drum.
The first scene is an umbrella dance; is it not?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry nodded assent. "Then," he continued,
"there is a comic under-writer of a sort of antediluvian
Lloyd's, limited&mdash;a bubble Company, of course&mdash;who
is found in the fork of a hollow fir-tree on Ararat, and
who duns Noah for a heavy amount. The ark encounters 
a yacht from Babylon, and a heavy swell
describes the whole thing as a smartish shower. Ham
lays down the principle of negro emancipation in a

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

duet with his mother, and the rest of the <i>dramatis
person&aelig</i> are made up of a kind of nautical mythology,
consisting of Neptune, the Tritons and Nereids, the
Sea-serpent, and a French Davy Jones, who is a
cross between a Breton boatswain and a marine Devil
on two Sticks."</p>

<p>"I don't know what we are coming to," said
Aubrey; "but, upon my word, I should think the
stage before the Flood, if there were any, must have
greatly resembled our present style of dramatic and
operatic productions. But how does the author account 
for a full <i>corps de ballet</i> on board of the
ark?"</p>

<p>"Well, considering that there is one on board of
the Spanish Armada in a late popular production, I
don't see much harm in that," observed Miss Dareall.
"Perhaps they were all drowned afterwards, or caught
cold and died of consumption before the world was
properly aired again."</p>

<p>"Have you got the greys or the bays, or whatever
they are, at the door, Mr. Aubrey?" she continued,
after a slight pause.</p>

<p>"The chesnuts," answered Aubrey, with some
little hesitation, before Luckless. "Yes, they are at
your service."</p>

<p>"I will not be a minute getting ready," said the
lady.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Mrs. Lacy. "Have you forgotten,
dear, that you told the duke to call at three to take
you to the Horticultural?"</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind," was the answer; "and
now I'm going to change my dress, which is much

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

more important. I shall not be a minute getting
ready."</p>

<p>And she ran out of the room, followed by Lacy.</p>

<p>"May I ask after the health of Mrs. Aubrey?" inquired 
Sir Harry of his companion, so soon as they
were alone together.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, very well, thank you; that is, not very
well, I mean. You know what a terrible calamity,
poor thing! so sad for me. I am forced, you know,
to seek a little relief, a little distraction, and that sort
of thing. Very sad, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sir Harry; "so I have been telling
Miss Dareall. Confound the rascal!" he muttered
between his teeth, "I would shoot him, if that were
any use. Yes (<i>aloud</i>), I said your generous devotion
was wearing you out. (<i>Aside</i>.) Selfish scoundrel!
(<i>Aloud</i>.) Certainly a man who could neglect such a
woman under such circumstances must be a brute
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Sir!" began Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Ah!" broke in the other, "I see you feel the
same indignation that I do at the bare thought of it.
How different is your conduct! Forced to seek
relief from your incessant care and sedulous watch
over one so beautiful and amiable visited by such a
calamity! You are indeed a wonder, a very ph&oelig;nix.
I trust, sir, that you may meet with your desert."</p>

<p>"Does he dare?" said Aubrey to himself. (<i>Aloud</i>.)
"What do you mean, may I ask? I do not quite
understand."</p>

<p>"Mean?" was the reply&mdash;"mean? Why, that
Mrs. Aubrey may not remain blind. What should I

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

mean? What would any one wish who knew her
and you?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Aubrey, colouring deeply, "if you
intend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment they were interrupted by Kitty,
attired in a rich, plain black velvet dress, which set off
her slender form to the utmost advantage. A row of
gold buttons of a classical design, from Etruscan
models, just sent over by Castellani of Rome, ornamented 
the dress, beginning small at the throat and
gradually increasing in size, till the lowest on the
border of her skirt was as large as a crown-piece. A
hat of minx-fur, with a single eagle's feather fastened
by a coral aigrette, completed her toilet, which was
certainly of a most piquant description.</p>

<p>"Show me a woman in Society," she said, "who
can dress thus in the time. Novel wager! The
celebrated Kitty Dareall, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martha Grub, will dress
against any woman, catch-weights, for a thousand
pounds. As, of course, it would be the fashion to
imitate me, I should be presented with a testimonial
by husbands. A votre disposition, monsieur," she
added, giving her arm to Aubrey. "Bye, bye, Luckless!"</p>

<p>"Stop, dear!" interposed Lacy. "Whatever shall
I say to the Duke of Chalkstoneville? There is the
doublest of knocks at the door."</p>

<p>"Come out this way, Mr. Aubrey," said Miss
Dareall, running to another door. "Tell the duke
to smother himself in his strawberry-leaves, or hang
himself with his own garter."</p>

<p>And she ran out laughing, followed by Aubrey;

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

but leaving Sir Harry Luckless, who had not time to
make his exit before the door opened, and the duke
appeared, ear-trumpet in hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir Harry Luckless, you here?" said his
grace. "Where is our fair friend? Where is she?
Where is the charming Kitty?"</p>

<p>Here he was seized with a violent fit of coughing,
which gave Mrs. Lacy time to implore Sir Harry, in
a whisper, not to contradict her.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said the duke. "It's nothing but
the dust in the streets. I never was better in my
life." And he coughed again so violently that he
grew purple in the face, and Sir Harry good-naturedly 
assisted him to a chair. "Oh dear!" he
resumed; "I beg pardon, I declare. Tell Miss
Dareall that I have kept my word, although I had to
quit the lev&eacute;e early on purpose. Ask her to come
down directly, if she can. I have brought the
diamonds and the vouchers for the ball, which she
was so anxious about."</p>

<p>"Indeed, your grace!" said Lacy, curtsying;
"Miss Dareall will be delighted, I am sure."</p>

<p>Upon which the faithful attendant received a jewel-case 
and a sealed envelope from the duke, and left the
room.</p>

<p>"Plague on it!" said the duke to Sir Harry, who
was an amused spectator of the whole proceeding, "I
wish she would be content with diamonds without
vouchers. Between ourselves, I shall get into a
scrape some day; I know I shall. I don't mind telling 
you, but I am sadly afraid this may reach the
ears of&mdash;&mdash; Eh? But I am too useful to the Government 

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

and too much courted by the Opposition to
feel much alarm. Oh dear! Oh! this cough."</p>

<p>"Indeed, duke," said Sir Harry&mdash;who was a great
favourite with many exalted personages who could
appreciate his really gentlemanly though libertine
qualities&mdash;"indeed, I am aware you can do almost
anything. Look at that affair of the review at Bumpkingham 
and the postmaster's two daughters."</p>

<p>"Ah," quoth his grace, whose deafness often
caused him to reply <i>&agrave; tort et &agrave; travers</i>, "so you've
read my speech in the 'Morning Post,' have you? I
am told that Wilberforce and the rest of them are
delighted with it."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Lacy re-entered.</p>

<p>"Your grace," she said, with the deepest reverence, 
"I was not aware that Miss Dareall had
gone out. She left her kindest regards with her
maid, and she waited until past three; and as she
thought your grace would be detained, by your official
duties, she is gone to see a lady friend, who is very
ill, at Barnet, and she will see your grace to-morrow,
or any day your grace is pleased to appoint, at two
o'clock; she will be so sorry when she knows your
grace has done her the honour of this visit."</p>

<p>"Did she leave no message for me?" inquired Sir
Harry, who could scarcely control his inclination to
laugh outright.</p>

<p>"La, Sir Harry!" answered Lacy, with a slight
dip, "to be sure she did. She said if you would be
kind enough to look at poor Fido, who has eaten
nothing since yesterday afternoon, and see to him,

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

she should be so much obliged, and you can look in
again as soon as ever you please."</p>

<p>The Duke of Chalkstoneville, who did not fail to
catch the sense of the duenna's shrill tones through
his ear-trumpet, seemed at first somewhat puzzled,
and not a little angry; but being very good-natured
in his way, especially where ladies were concerned,
his anger, as Mrs. Lacy well knew, was not likely to
be very durable.</p>

<p>"Confound it, madam!" he began; "why she
knew I was going to Bumpkinghamshire this very
evening. To-morrow," he continued, addressing
Sir Harry, "is the great agricultural dinner; and I
have to give the first prize, consisting of a smock-frock 
and a guinea, to the labourer who has set the
best example for morality for sixty years out of three
parishes. My dear madam, will you kindly return
those vouchers to me. I would rather present them
myself. You can give her the diamonds, of course.
At any rate I shall get out of that scrape. Eh? eh?
what do you think?"</p>

<p>His grace was, after so prolonged a speech, seized
with such a violent fit of coughing, that at one time
it seemed as if Bumpkinghamshire would lose one
of its noblest pillars of morality, so shaky did the
ducal rewarder of virtue appear to be on his legs.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my lord duke," rejoined Mrs. Lacy, as
soon as he could be spoken to with safety; "I wish
it was in my power to obey your grace's commands."</p>

<p>"Heyday, madam! What! what!" said his grace,
"I presume you are not like a post-office, where a

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

man can't get his own letter back when it is once
put in the box?"</p>

<p>"I can send a messenger, if your grace wishes it,"
whimpered Lacy.</p>

<p>"A messenger!" cried the duke. "What do you
mean, madam? Have you not got my letter?"</p>

<p>"I never was so vexed in all my life. I hope
your grace will not be angry." (Here she pretended
to cry.) "But the truth is, I knew that my dear,
kind Miss Dareall was so anxious to know about the
ball, and I was so anxious to tell her of&mdash;of&mdash;your
grace's kindness, that&mdash;that&mdash;I despatched her groom
instantly with your grace's letter and the parcel to
Barnet after her. Hi! hi! But," she added, with
vivacity, "I will take a cab instantly and go after
him."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear madam, I could not wait, I
assure you. Was ever anything so unfortunate?"
said the duke. "Give her my kind regards when
she returns, and tell her not to injure her health by
watching over her sick friend. Good girl! good
girl!" And his grace bowed to Mrs. Lacy, nodded
to Sir Harry, and toddled towards the door, where he
paused. "Nothing infections, I hope?" he inquired;
"not scarlet fever?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o&mdash;o, your grace," returned the confidante,
nearly choking herself with her handkerchief; "only
a baby, and Miss Dareall is to be godmother. Such
a fine boy, your grace&mdash;one of her dearest and oldest
friends. Bless his little heart!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said his grace to himself, and feeling in
his pocket; "no, it's not mine, certainly; but, let

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

me see; you are a very good lady; eh, ma'am, oblige
me." And he put a bank-note in her hand. "Lay
it out for the little stranger&mdash;eh? eh? That's it&mdash;thank 
you&mdash;good afternoon."</p>

<p>And his grace toddled out, as Lacy flew to the
bell, and thence to the head of the stairs, and then
followed him to the street-door, reappearing a minute
or two after with a remarkably amiable expression of
countenance, which almost seemed to justify the
duke's compliment to her good-nature.</p>

<p>"Infection! scarlet fever!" cried Sir Harry.
"Do you know the consequences might have been
serious? I never was so near bursting a blood-vessel 
in my life. You beat little Toole at the
Adelphi. You haven't sent the groom, of course
not; didn't I know that she is gone to Richmond?
Ha! ha! let's have a look at the sparklers." Mrs.
Lacy quietly took the case from her pocket, and displayed 
them with great composure. "But, I say,
there's a flaw in this big one in the middle, and the
rest are not&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;rose-cut, or
whatever it is&mdash;I mean, not so valuable as they look.
I know Kitty's taste well. She won't care for these."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if she sent them back," said
the lady. "She will, as soon as look at them, if she
doesn't like them. She will be pleased with the
vouchers, though, I know. I wouldn't have let him
have them back for a trifle."</p>

<p>"But about poor Fido?" inquired Sir Harry,
laughing. "I thought you had lost him?"</p>

<p>"So we did, a month ago," said the faithful Lacy.</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Sir Harry, "I think I stood

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

godfather to that Barnet baby uncommonly well. I
am glad, however, that you did not appeal to me to
corroborate your tale, because that would have been
awkward."</p>

<p>"La, Sir Harry!" said Mrs. Lacy, "of course I
knew such a gentleman as you wouldn't betray a
lady's secret; nor yet like to be found out in a fib."</p>

<p>"Found out?" said Sir Harry; "that is the last
thing I should think of."</p>

<p>This was beyond Mrs. Lacy's powers of appreciation. 
To her fib-telling was a virtue, if undetected.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Sir Harry," she responded; "how odd
you gentlemen are! But what would you be if the
ladies didn't deceive you a little sometimes? I am
sure you would not like to know all."</p>

<p>"Faith, not I!" answered the baronet. "It would
destroy a good many pleasing delusions; wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it might," was the reply. "Look at the
dear old gouty duke. I am sure I wouldn't hurt his
feelings, if I could help it, by telling him that Miss
Dareall had gone out with that fellow for a drive."</p>

<p>"Putting aside the christening present for the
baby at Barnet," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "what is a baby more or less
in a town like Barnet? Besides, if the truth must
be spoken, I do know a lady there which has just got
a beautiful baby, and a finer boy the duke himself
couldn't wish for. But they say he doesn't wish for
any; as I dare say you've heard, Sir Harry. Well, if

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

I was a duke, I shouldn't like to be without chick nor
child."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have a dozen than the gout," said Sir
Harry.</p>

<p>"Go along with you!" was Mrs. Lacy's response.</p>

<p>"To Barnet?" asked Sir Harry. "But I say, do
you think it possible that Kitty can really mean to
encourage the attentions of this man Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she encourages anybody much,"
said Mrs. Lacy. "But I did think till this morning,
that if there was any one in this world that was
poison to her, as one might say, it was this very
Aubrey. Why, she has never let him put foot in this
house, since the first time he came here with Mr.
Stingray, till this very morning. But then she is so
contrary. She is not like any one else. I never
know what she will do the next moment, and I
don't think that she knows herself. The only thing
she has kept to at all is this theatre business, and it
wouldn't surprise me if she was to turn that up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried Sir Harry, "and leave all the
folks at the Thespis, pit, boxes, and gallery, waiting
for her at night, while she is off to Paris, or the Isle
of Wight, or Brighton."</p>

<p>"That's just what I've expected for the last fortnight," 
said Lacy. "Only let any piece she is in have a
long run, and see how she'll bolt. It's only the constant 
change of parts and dresses that will keep her,
and so I made bold to tell Methusalem Wigster,
Esquire. What a dear, nice, old, merry gentleman

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

he is. 'Mrs. Lacy,' he says, 'there's always a private
box for you and any of your friends whom you
like to ask; and be sure and let me know if Miss
Dareall gets any nonsense into her head, in time to
prevent it, if possible.' And that I will, you may be
sure, though for that matter it mightn't be much use
neither; but I do love to see her on the stage, and
who knows what it will lead to?"</p>

<p>"All this puts me in mind," said Sir Harry, "that
I quite forgot to ask her to speak to Wigster about a
girl I want to get on in the ballet. She's both pretty
and clever; only there's been illness at her home,
and she couldn't keep her engagement at the Escurial,
while she nursed her little brothers and sisters. That
brute Slimy Cash dismissed her with a volley of oaths,
and I've sworn never to enter the place again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lacy shook her head. "You're a sad fellow,"
she said, "with your girls."</p>

<p>"I assure you," said Sir Harry, "she is as good
and virtuous a creature as exists in the world."</p>

<p>"Though she knows you?" retorted Lacy.</p>

<p>"Though she knows me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And very poor?"</p>

<p>"Very poor."</p>

<p>"Then you've only to tell some one we know,"
said Mrs. Lacy, "and she'll see her righted. There
isn't a tenderer-hearted, sweeterer dispositioned girl
than Kitty Dareall in the world, and I don't care
where the other comes from, with all her fancies and
funny ways; and, what's more, if you like to leave
the particulars with me, I'll see it done, if I have
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

<p>"Send a special messenger to Barnet," interrupted 
Sir Harry, laughing.</p>

<p>"La, Sir Harry! How you do reckon a person
up! I hope you don't think there was any harm in
it."</p>

<p>"Who, I, dear Mrs. Lacy? It's no affair of mine,
but I can't help laughing when I think of it." And
Sir Harry began to cough and imitate the duke.
"You're a good (<i>cough</i>), kind creature (<i>cough</i>),
ma'am."</p>

<p>"There's one thing you haven't done, as he did,"
said Lacy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," said Sir Harry; and he took
out his pocket-book. "Only I haven't a hundred
thousand pounds a-year, you know."</p>

<p>"I wish you had," said Lacy, "that I do; there's
none I should like to see better with it. Bless your
good heart! I was only joking like yourself. I wouldn't
touch a penny of your money. I'd sooner burn my
fingers off. There, put it back again. What do you
take me for?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Sir Harry, "you'll offend me, if you
don't."</p>

<p>"Then offended you must be. No! I won't, I tell
you, there!" cried Mrs. Lacy. "Come, I must be
off; I've got all the dresses to look after. She plays
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sir Harry, "if you are such a dear,
obstinate creature, I must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he actually snatched a kiss from the cheek of
the middle-aged duenna.</p>

<p>"Go away, do, you audacious, impudent fellow!

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

I am sure <i>you</i> have no kisses to spare," said Lacy,
smiling most graciously. "Dear me, it's past four
o'clock, I declare."</p>

<p>Sir Harry kissed the tips of his fingers, and made
a courtly bow, as he departed.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lacy, "if I was a young lady like
Kitty, I know I'd rather stitch my fingers off for a
man like him, than be mistress of a duke's mansion
with twenty thousand a-year."</p>

</div>

<p>WE must now accompany the triumphant Aubrey
and the dashing actress in their drive. Infatuated as
was that reckless, and in this respect heartless, profligate, 
he was hardly prepared to face the fashionable
crowd in the Park, considering his social and domestic 
ties. At least there was a struggle between
shame and vanity in his mind. Ninety-nine out of a
hundred of the men about town would have given
much for such a chance as to be seen steering the
inimitable and irrepressible Kitty Dareall through
the double row of carriages by the Serpentine; and
a very large percentage of married libertines would
have jumped still more eagerly at the chance. But
there were circumstances connected with Aubrey's

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

appearance in public with so celebrated a character
as Kitty, which invested the act with peculiar drawbacks. 
It was, doubtless, in the worst sense, a
triumph; for Miss Dareall had never shown such a
marked preference for any one before. She always
drove her own horses, and rode alone, attended by a
groom; seldom encouraging any one to ride by her
side for more than a minute or two, just to exchange
courtesies, and, possibly, communicate a stray <i>on dit</i>.
Therefore, to appear driving her in his own carriage
was, as he knew, a thing that would immediately
furnish scandal and conjecture to all London. Only
a week before, she had actually laid her whip smartly
across the shoulders of a noble lord, supposed to be
inspired by a wager, who had been so devoid of
manners as to persevere in riding alongside of her
pony carriage, and in boring her with his impertinent
remarks. The public on that occasion sided with
her, and condemned the discomfited Lord Charles
with the verdict of "Served him right." But Aubrey
well knew that there was something in his own case
beyond common imprudence or folly. His triumph
was a <i>l&acirc;chet&eacute;</i>&mdash;an act of cowardly baseness. He was,
at least, cowardly enough to feel that it was base,
without possessing the self-control to avoid it. So,
when he approached the Park by Constitution Hill,
he felt anything but comfortable. What if the news
should reach Blanche! He felt as if the eyes which
envied would condemn him, and that those which
utterly condemned would blister him. It was, therefore, 
with a great sensation of relief that, just as
they passed St. George's Hospital, Miss Dareall intimated 

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

that she would prefer a short drive in the
country, avoiding the Park.</p>

<p>As they dashed along the road, he regained his
spirits and self-possession, whilst his fair companion
listened in silence to his endeavours to amuse her.
She appeared to be in a thoughtful and pettish
mood; but, sooth to say, the truant husband attributed 
this to some annoyance she had received that
morning. Perhaps she did not like her new part;
perhaps that odious, impertinent Luckless had annoyed 
her. On Aubrey alluding to the duke's visit
and disappointment, and contrasting it with his own
felicity, the lady laughed aloud so abruptly and
sharply, as to cause her admirer to turn round and
look at her, and thereby endanger the safety of the
mail-phaeton by grazing the wheel of a waggon in
the narrow part of Kensington, where the road turns
abruptly to the left. A shout of opprobrium and
derision greeted him, such as the lower order of the
British cockney is apt to indulge in on such occasions. 
One would think, to hear the expressions
of drivers and coachmen, on the slightest possible
provocation, and frequently with none at all, that
driving must be the most ill-conditioned pursuit in
the world. It is only necessary for two men to be
driving opposite ways, or to get blocked up together,
through circumstances for which neither is at fault,
to create in a moment the deadliest enmity towards
each other in their breasts. Could they leave their
respective charges, they would take each other's
lives, like a pair of Corsicans, or partisans in an
old Scottish feud. Aubrey uttered an apology for

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

his bad driving, which he garnished with a somewhat
commonplace compliment to his fair companion's
charms.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she replied, rudely enough, "don't make
any excuses for your awkwardness; I don't mind
a spill in the least. I thought you were not much
of a whip."</p>

<p>Aubrey bit his lip; but his vanity whispered that
this was either badinage or coquetry. Perhaps she
wanted to try his temper. So he answered, gaily
enough, that he should be glad to take lessons from
the queen of horsewomen and charioteers.</p>

<p>"And now, whither shall we drive?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You may go to Richmond, if you like," she answered. 
"So that I'm in town at eight, I don't care.
I don't play to-night, and so I have made up a party
to go to the Surrey Theatre, of all places in the world,
to see some transpontine celebrity tear a passion to
tatters. I have not ordered dinner at home; and so,
if you please, we can get something there. We
actresses have good appetites. We don't live on air,
I promise you. But don't let me interfere with your
arrangements. You may be expected home to dinner,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not in the least," stammered Aubrey.</p>

<p>The fact is, at that moment he recollected not
only that he was expected home, but his promise
to his wife, and the anniversary. Did his conscience
not give him a severe twinge as he thought of her,
so young, so beautiful, and so afflicted, and of his
own base neglect and faithless behaviour? We
believe that it did; but still he hardened his heart.

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

At any rate, he did not suffer his thoughts of home
and Blanche to interfere much with the attention
which he lavished on the unappreciative Miss Dareall.
That young lady became every minute more defiant
and disagreeable in her mode of repelling his courtesies. 
Any one would have thought that her object
was not to fascinate, but to disgust her admirer.
Strange to say, Aubrey, usually rather refined in his
ideas, did not at all appear to take that view. Her
undisguised vulgarity passed current for natural wit.
He compared her in his mind with Peg Woffington
and Mrs. Bracegirdle. He did not observe the contempt 
and sarcasm with which she received his
advances. Probably, she understood thoroughly how
to deal with a lover of this stamp. A votary of false
love is like a votary of Bacchus. He sees neither
the repulsive lineaments of his idol, nor the absurd
and revolting antics of which he himself is guilty.
Or, rather, he is like a fanatic who has imbibed the
Indian <i>cannabis sativa</i>, or bhang. He cares not for
wounds or blows; he clasps insults and injuries to his
bleeding breast. He shouts "Ev&ouml;e! ev&ouml;e!" or whatever 
is equivalent to that classical expression of
drunkenness; he wallows in mire, and dreams that it
is a nectarean current whose golden waves bear him
along in a delirium of sunshine and joy. He is in
short a lunatic crowned as it were with the broken
straws of sherry-cobblers trodden in the dust and
mud of a mental Cremorne. Throughout all this
delusion, however, <i>surgit amari aliquid</i>; there is a
wrong flavour in every dish. A Scotch madman
declared that every delicacy of which he fancied that

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

he partook tasted of porridge; and there was very
good reason why it should, considering that it was his
standing dish. There is a vein of unpleasant reality
running through our Berserkar's frenzy, which he
cannot get rid of. The picturesque scenery will look
like pasteboard every now and then, and the enchanted
carbuncle will resolve itself into the aspect of common
glass. Is it a pity or a gain that false pleasures have
still their drawback, even while the demon continues
loyal and the delusion lasts? We have always
doubted whether Faust could be supposed actually to
believe in the reality of the mock Helen, whom he
saw. Certain it is, that as the fair <i>d&eacute;butante</i> of the
Thespis rattled on with the most unequivocal bad
taste, and displayed all the exaggerated humours of
her sex, Aubrey did not feel quite at his ease. Perhaps 
the thought occurred to him, "What if this
irrepressible Siren were really mine? What if I
were the guardian and possessor of these mercurial
charms?" Perhaps he trembled on the threshold of
so much happiness. Perhaps the pale image of the
suffering Blanche arose occasionally, as the phantom
of Gretchen on the Brocken smote the senses of the
dazzled and bewildered Faust. Then the fascination
seized him again. Was not the fair creature at his
side, whom all London&mdash;i.e., all the London he knew,
and a good deal besides&mdash;admired and adored?
Certainly the divinity was loud in her voice, and
somewhat coarse and unlady-like in her ideas. Twice
she had called him a fool, by way of answer to some
observation he had made. When he talked of love,
and music, of poetry, and flowers, she laughed outright 

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

in his face. When he asked her if she admired
Tennyson, not exactly in such prosaic phraseology,
but endeavoured to lead her to display her aesthetic
perceptions of the chief of the modern poetic school
of song, all that he elicited was "Combien?" accompanied 
by a yawn. When he spoke of the exquisite
new old style of painting of which Rossetti is king,
the drawings and portraits of Sandys, and such topics
of enlightened talk, she asked him whom he thought
the best "photo-grifer" to take a woman on horseback, 
and expatiated on the fast beauties of a low-crowned 
round man's hat as the most becoming
equestrian covering for a lady's head. Then she
declared she was dying of thirst, and must have a
glass of "pale." So they actually had to pull up at
a roadside public, to the infinite horror of Tops, who,
however he might affect such a proceeding on his
own account, when waiting with the trap anywhere
for his master on the road or in town, by no means
approved of it under present circumstances. But
then, was not all this, in Aubrey's mind, a delightful
contrast to the staid hypocritical humbug of polite
life? Perhaps it was. At all events his gratified
excitement and vanity received no serious check. As
they approached Richmond, Miss Dareall became
even more outrageous in her open warfare against
propriety and decorum. She insisted upon changing
places with Aubrey and driving the "trap." She
struck the near chesnut a smart stroke with the whip,
against Aubrey's earnest caution and entreaty, and
endangered the safety of the party, the horses actually
bolting for half a mile along the road, which, to judge

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

by her shrieks of laughter, afforded her infinite
pleasure and delight. She accused Aubrey of being
afraid, and finished by being sullen and savage, in
which mood she arrived at Richmond, at the inevitable 
"Comet and Stay-lace," where a collation was
immediately ordered by Aubrey, in obedience to the
loudly expressed wishes of the lady, who jumped down
so suddenly as nearly to knock over a brace of waiters
and an aged and attendant groom.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Tops to himself, "whatever can the
governor be about? I am glad it's the last time I'm
likely to be one of sech a party of escaped loon&agrave;tics.
If I hadn't already turned the governor up this morning, 
I'd do it when we got home. As for her&mdash;&mdash;"
Here the feelings of Mr. Tops found vent in a prolonged 
whistle; after which he followed the horses
into the stable to see that they were properly done,
and to examine into the quality of the Richmond
oats, or at least that sample of them afforded by the
resources of the "Comet and Stay-lace." During
the drive to this chosen retreat of metropolitan
recreation, Mr. Tops had displayed a demeanour
something between that of a Roman freedman
mourning over some patrician disgrace, and the
cynical ease of haughty indifference which modern
servitude assumes, when regarding with serene contempt 
the pretensions or follies of its temporary
employer. Mr. Tops had sat in the phaeton with
folded arms, as much as possible on one side, and
behind his master. His countenance was as unmoved
and inscrutable as that of the Sphinx. The severest
criticism of bystander or passer-by would not have

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

elicited a spark of anger or intelligence from his
eyes; much less a gesture of impatience from his
person, or a comment from his lips. A Sphinx with
a turned-up nose, and a cockade in its hat, and bearing 
the slightest resemblance to a London groom,
might be a curiosity; and yet the expression of Mr.
Tops was at least as fixed as that of the Egyptian
deity. Let it not be understood that he by any means
despised or hated Miss Dareall. Strange to say, he
rather at that moment coveted the post of groom to
that lady. He admired her horsemanship, her style,
and her daring. "She is a rare plucked un," he would
say, "and no mistake." The relation, however, which
he held towards his own "missus," whom he respected
more than any human being, utterly precluded the
realisation of the idea which had certainly presented
itself to his fancy. He saw that she treated his
master with utter contempt and derision, and he liked
her for it. He did not like her in "our pheayton."
His indignation was colossal when Aubrey, some few
days before, had sent Grey Leila, his dear mistress's
own mare, round to Miss Dareall's house, for that
young lady to try her paces in the Park. Indeed, so
strongly did he object to such a sacrilege, that he
would not take the animal round himself, nor even
saddle and bridle her. He deputed "a young man"
whom he knew, to do a thing which he found so distasteful. 
Had Aubrey ordered him to ride after her,
he would have given warning that instant. But to
say that he disliked Miss Dareall on private and personal 
grounds would be far from true. Had Susan
known what was going on, how she would have hated

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

her&mdash;her good qualities in all probability more than
her bad. How she would have derided her dress,
horsemanship, dancing, swimming, skating, everything 
in which she excelled. Probably she would
have found most fault with the only redeeming part
of Kitty's reputation. "Oh, she's a nice modest
dear," she would have cried; "the hypocritical
Jezebel!" But men do not judge of the opposite sex
thus. Had Aubrey been unmarried, Tops would have
greatly commended his taste in paying attention to
a young lady so much after his own heart as Miss
Dareall. In a word, he condemned his master, and
not the enchantress.</p>

<p>On entering the "Comet and Stay-lace," Miss
Dareall declared herself dying of hunger. She and
Aubrey were shown into a room looking upon the
river, over a pleasant garden, and when the waiter
submitted the bill of fare, she was so fanciful and
capricious that it was with difficulty any conclusion
could be arrived at, at all. The order, however,
once given, was speedily attended to; but when the
repast made its appearance, she declared she could
not touch a morsel of anything, declined all or any
of the wines specially demanded by Aubrey, and
in which she had the chief voice, sulked, pouted,
frowned, and suddenly rising, protested she could
not stay an instant longer, and desired that the
horses might be put to immediately. When Aubrey
demurred to this, and begged her to take a morsel
of refreshment and remain an hour&mdash;one short hour
longer, she turned upon him almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "here I am, and what have

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

you to say? You have been very anxious to entertain 
me, and I have given you the opportunity. It
appears to me that you have not exactly succeeded.
And now let me ask you to what precise idea I am
indebted for all this constant attention, this exceedingly 
demonstrative solicitude" (and she made a
most provoking curtsy). "If you have any idea of
coming out as a burlesque writer, certainly I will do
the civil thing with Wigster; but I must not encourage 
your hopes. He is overstocked with pieces.
In fact, I told him the other day, that the best thing
he could do would be to make a bargain with a
waste-paper merchant; five pounds a ton is not to be
despised in these days. Dramas weigh heavily, especially 
when in five acts, and farces tell up in number.
There, don't look angry. Your piece is not sent in
yet, is it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Arthur, not knowing whether
to pretend to look amused or not, "though I plead
guilty to have written more than one play, I have
not flung myself upon the tender mercies of your
impresario."</p>

<p>"What do you want, then?" asked Miss Dareall,
assuming a look of stolid inquiry.</p>

<p>"Can you ask me?" returned Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I do ask you," said the lady. "I have asked
you, I believe. Do you wish me to repeat the
question?"</p>

<p>Aubrey was what is called a lady's man, very
popular amongst women in all ranks; but he felt rather
disconcerted by the abrupt manner of the actress.</p>

<p>"You must long have seen&mdash;have known," he

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

began, "my too evident admiration of&mdash;of&mdash;qualities
so admirable, so adorable&mdash;that&mdash;ah, dear Miss Dareall! 
who can, who would resist charms that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she interrupted him, so that we cannot exactly 
say how his declaration might have terminated.
During these few words she had been impatiently
beating a sort of tattoo with one of her small feet;
but as if disinclined to hear more, she rose, drew
herself up, and advanced a pace towards him.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" she began, with an indefinable taunting 
regard, "and have you brought me to Richmond 
to hear this sort of rubbish, of which I am
sickened every day of my life? Do you want to
rehearse burlesque here with me? If so, you are
guilty of a presumption, a conceit, an insolence, that
I confess I did not think was in you. I really must
compliment you upon the sublimity of your impertinence. 
So, sir, you thought, I suppose, that you
had won a simple girl's heart by your bouquets and
your grimaces."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Dareall! listen, I beseech, I entreat
you!" recommenced our hero, feeling, it must be
owned, excessively foolish.</p>

<p>"No!" she answered, "I request, I command
you to listen to me. But first, there is something to
be done, a little act of restitution. Here, sir, are
sundry trifles which have gone astray." And she
produced a packet from a small reticule which she
had brought with her. "Your letters and notes,"
she said, "I need not and cannot return. They were
burnt; sometimes partly read, and sometimes, I
must confess, unperused; unless my maid has a taste

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

for such light literature. There is no knowing what
rubbish may entertain a servant-girl or a milliner,
especially when the theme is love. Love! did I
say? It is a commodity of which I must profess my
ignorance; unless, as some good-natured folks might
say, it may be the market value of the thing. Well,
if there is such a reality as love, I profane it in connexion 
with your audacious vanity."</p>

<p>"Miss Dareall!" began Aubrey, "if you wish only
to insult me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," she interrupted, "have you not sufficiently
insulted me? You have brought this on your
own head. You brought me to this place, you
have arranged this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, and you shall hear
me. When you have heard all I have to say on this
matter, it will then be a question how far I may
pardon you for the insult you have offered me; on
one condition."</p>

<p>"If there is a condition I can offer to gain your
regard," cried Aubrey, "name it, I pray. Unfortunately 
as I am situated, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" she cried. "In the first place oblige
me by taking back these baubles, which I never
meant to keep. The flowers which you sent were
invariably, by my orders, thrown away. This cross,"
she said, "is a pretty thing enough. I must compliment 
you on your taste in jewellery. I wish I could
do as much in matters more important. Take these
where you should take them; take this, where it may
grace a purer bosom and a fairer throat. Not a word.
Take them, I say, or I will fling them at you!"</p>

<p>Aubrey obeyed in silence. The truth is, he was

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

fairly embarrassed and overawed. There was something 
equally beautiful and terrible in the aspect of
this young girl, so suddenly transformed from
frivolity and vulgarity to the majesty of rebuke.
He had never seen her attired in a tithe of the fascination 
which she now wore. She looked like some
graceful denizen of the forest; a female panther or
puma, aroused in defence of her young. Her lithe
and supple form fell into every attitude of natural
grace as she spoke; a bright colour glowed in place
of the usual soft and delicate bloom of her cheeks,
and her large grey eyes seemed to dilate and expand
with light. As we have said, she owed more to
expression than to strict beauty; and certainly on
this occasion, her varied expression conveyed a charm
often wanting to features of a more classic and regular
turn. It must be owned that Aubrey's position was
exceedingly absurd, and that he most richly deserved
it. Ashamed, irritated, and still more fascinated
than ever by the object of his guilty and insane
passion, he stood very much like a schoolboy detected
and arrested in some flagitious act, disappointed and
afraid, yet full of impotent rage.</p>

<p>"Sit down, I beg of you," said Miss Dareall.</p>

<p>Aubrey mechanically obeyed her, and awaited what
further she might say. Still he was not without
a hope that she had merely been trying his temper
and patience, or had been playing a part, and would
alter her tone. She advanced to the window and
looked out upon the fair garden and the bright river
which flowed past its bounds.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

<p>"It is early in the year," she said; "but how
beautiful that gleam of sunshine on the water. Why,"
she cried, turning round fiercely upon him, "did you
bring me into the country? I tell you that I hate
it; the beauty of nature maddens me; the sunshine
and green fields stir all the gall within my breast.
I would only be brought amidst fields and trees and
flowers to die&mdash;do you hear me? to die!"</p>

<p>"Are you ill, Miss Dareall?" inquired Aubrey,
"or have you lost your senses?"</p>

<p>"Listen, sir," she replied, "you are, I believe, a
gentleman. I know little or nothing of your private
character; for I have never cared to inquire. I
never liked you, nor in truth disliked you. I only
see in you one out of a herd of selfish men who flatter
a woman, out of mingled vanity and fashion, and tell
her, with the nauseating professions which it were
a charity to imagine they themselves believe, they
cherish for her the passion of love. But for two
reasons, I would treat you as I would any other out
of the herd. I would encourage you for interested
motives, or spurn you for the choice of a wealthier
rival and dupe; deceive and disappoint you if I
encouraged you, and hate and scorn you in either
case alike."</p>

<p>"To what does this tend? What reasons do you
mean?" asked Aubrey, with increasing surprise.</p>

<p>"It once fell to your lot to do me a kindness. The
act and the motive were perhaps scarcely worthy of
each other, but into that I will not inquire. I will
give you credit for both alike."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

<p>"A kindness? May I ask what it was?" said
Aubrey. "Believe me, when I say that I have not
the slightest idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor ever will have," was the reply. "Suffice it
to say that it was done. But for that we should
probably at this moment not be&mdash;here. But for
that, and another reason, I certainly had not taken
the trouble to accompany you to Richmond this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I adjure you, if you have any feeling, any kindness 
in return, since you say I had the good fortune
to do you a favour, tell me at least some motive," said
Aubrey, "some reason for conduct so extraordinary,
and language so strange."</p>

<p>"Feeling? Ought I to indulge in such a luxury?"
she answered. "Is not that a monopoly of the aristocratic 
and the virtuous heart? What if I tell
you, then, that somewhere here" (placing her hand
upon her heart), "very deeply hidden and known
only lately even to myself, and to myself alone, is
something which, had it the opportunity of expansion, 
could it live in the atmosphere of falsehood and
deception around, might make me loathe myself
almost as thoroughly and deservedly as I despise
you!"</p>

<p>"What can she mean?" exclaimed Aubrey. "Is
she mad, or is it&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in all that you would surmise.
You cannot imagine the truth," was the reply.
"But if you have a heart, a soul; if you have ever
known the love and care of a mother, which I have
not; the affection of a sister, pure and gentle, as I

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

have only known the sisterhood of frailty and shame,
you will not seek to misunderstand that which I am
about to say, and you will, at least with these advantages, 
attempt to rival me in the common attributes
of humanity which are supposed to raise us above the
level of the brutes."</p>

<p>"To what can all this tend?" uttered Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she continued, "that there is a great
moral distinction between such a being as you would
make me&mdash;nay, such as I am&mdash;and yourself. You
would, and could, return to Society and decorum, to
sister and mother, to your wife, into company to
which I might not aspire, forsooth! whence I should
be thrust forth, if I intruded myself. What is this
difference which exists between you and the frailest
of my sex? I tell you that, compared with your
present conduct, the darkest error&mdash;sin if you like&mdash;of 
my history is innocence itself."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" inquired Aubrey, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Can you ask me?" she replied. "Man, if I
were to name it, if there be justice, it should strike
you&mdash;<i>blind!</i>"</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You have a wife&mdash;have you not?" she continued.
"Her name is Blanche!"</p>

<p>"Silence! silence! I insist upon it!" cried Aubrey.</p>

<p>"What! Do I sully her name by pronouncing
it?" resumed Miss Dareall. "A wife! I say again,
young and beautiful in spite of her affliction, and
who loves you in proportion to the contempt which
you merit at her hands. Oh, I know all! You are

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

breaking her heart to follow me who despise you,
and you are even offended that I should mention her
name, miserable impostor and hypocrite that you
are!"</p>

<p>At this last insult, Aubrey could contain himself no
longer. He sprang to his feet and looked towards
the door, as if for escape. The look was not lost
upon her, who continued:</p>

<p>"Be seated, sir, I pray. Well, then, shall I tell
you that I am not fit to breathe her name? Oh, I
am speaking truth. Shall I disenchant you further?
Shall I tell you the whole story of my life? Nay,
'twould be safe with you; for the sake of your own
vanity&mdash;one of the strongest holds upon a selfish
man. Shall I tell you the story of the last three
months, the last fortnight, while you have been besetting 
my door&mdash;the lies and the pretences, the
woman's artifices, the flattery of the old, the cajolery
of the young? Shall I tell you how I was fished up
by the hair with a chance drag, ha! ha! from the
mud and filth of London streets&mdash;how I was lost in
drunkenness, in penury, and sin? You start, do
you? You shrink&mdash;how dare you shrink, man, from
me?"</p>

<p>She paused awhile, as if to collect herself; and
then resumed, whilst Aubrey stood as if rooted to the
floor in a deprecating attitude, but uttered not a word.
The truth is, that he was shocked as well as ashamed.
There was a terrible earnestness about this creature,
which could not leave him in doubt as to the truth
of what she said. The fact is, when a man meets
a beautiful woman who is the centre of adoration,

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

he does not at first trouble himself to consider how
she came there. Miss Dareall's antecedents were the
last thing into which it had as yet occurred to Aubrey
to inquire.</p>

<p>"Well," she continued, "I was taken, and redeemed 
from penury and its attendant horrors by a
Saint in Heaven, whose memory I reverence too
much to tell you more than that I owe him life,
education, and such prosperity as I now enjoy. Had
he lived&mdash;&mdash; But why do I prate about myself?
Only to tell you what it is that you approach with
your <i>fade</i> flatteries, your sickening daily dose of
admiration. Never approach my door again, I tell
you, or my male friends shall hound you from it,
my female acquaintance jeer at you; until your
name becomes a byword for spurned and rejected
pretensions&mdash;menial love. But no, no; I will not
continue thus. Sir, I beg and implore you to return
to her who pines for your presence in your home&mdash;who 
may be dying for all that you know at this very
moment, deserted and alone."</p>

<p>Aubrey started with conscious horror that it might
be so. The tones of the strange being who thus
rebuked him had suddenly changed. Her accents
were the spoken contralto of pathos itself.</p>

<p>"They tell me," she continued, almost in a breath,
"that her eyes are beautiful as ever. Is it so? Oh,
shame on you! shame on you! to deprive her, so
stricken, of the daily and hourly solace of a loved
voice, of words of tenderness and affection. Believe
me, you love her still. You are playing with your
choicest blessing, like a child. You are not utterly

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

bad and heartless. If another were at her feet now,
would it not madden you? It would! it would!
You start at the very thought."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is too much!" cried Aubrey, moved and
repentant.</p>

<p>"Hear me!" resumed the actress, from whose face
every vestige of colour had flown, and whose eyes
were now misty and clouded, as if unseen tears had
gathered behind them, that waited a signal to break
forth. "I have never had any real happiness in this
world. Let me owe to you at least one good action
in my life. If I cannot love you, let me, at least,
honour and respect your memory as a friend. Let
me think of you kindly and gratefully in the few
moments when I do think, and perhaps I shall sometimes 
owe to you better and happier thoughts. See!
I implore you, with clasped hands, to do this." And
here she suited the action to the word. "You will go
to her&mdash;will you not?&mdash;who loves you so well, who is
so worthy of the best man's love? I have heard of
her actions at a distance, her noble charity, her
benevolent heart. You will go to her, will you not,
and abandon for ever this mad infatuation, which
must seem to you like a hideous dream?"</p>

<p>Aubrey made no answer, but turned away, and
covered his eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she cried, "I have conquered. I see that
you are deeply moved. You will go to her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will, I will," he answered, huskily. "I swear
it!"</p>

<p>"I need no oath," she said, in accents of bitter
melancholy; "I have heard too many&mdash;known too

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

many broken. But I believe your word. I have
marked your every gesture. I know that you have
only neglected her, because you felt so secure of her
love. But bethink you always, should you trifle
further with that love, a rival may step in whom
Purity herself may not baffle&mdash;the skeleton seducer,
Death!"</p>

<p>"Villain! blind and selfish villain that I have
been!" was all that Aubrey could utter.</p>

<p>"I was speaking the other day," resumed the
actress, "with one who knows her well, and who
loves her with all the devotion of a generous heart."</p>

<p>"Ha! who is he?" exclaimed Aubrey. "I will
chastise him, be he who he may."</p>

<p>"How like a man!" she returned. "You have not
the right, even were he only less culpable than you
have been yourself. But, believe me, your anger is
without cause. He is too noble to take such an
advantage, even were he cursed with the chance. I
tell you he respects her, as she deserves and commands 
respect."</p>

<p>"Tell me, at least, who he is," said Aubrey.
"You may do so safely, if it be as you say, and I
believe your every word."</p>

<p>"One whom I once thought&mdash;&mdash; But that weakness
is past," she answered; "although it may have wrung
my heart silently; more than I have dared to acknowledge, 
even to myself. Nay, do not ask me. It
is a woman's secret, though never to be told. Go,
Mr. Aubrey, to your beautiful and confiding wife.
I have a presentiment that I shall see her soon,

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

although at a distance, and unknown. For between
us there is a gulf deeper than yon darkening stream.
And now, farewell!"</p>

<p>"And will you not give me your hand?" he asked,
as she moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"In token of this compact alone," she answered;
giving it to him, with a calm and sad dignity, which
contrasted strikingly with the impetuosity of her
previous address.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay!" he exclaimed, as she would have
passed him on her way out. "And you, yourself,
singular and gifted being, what of yourself, your own
career? You are not happy. I seem to have read a
world of sorrow in your eyes just now, when you ceased
to upbraid me so bitterly, and appealed only to my
better feelings; to a soul that is not dead to repentance 
for my folly. Tell me, are you really devoted
to your present life; and this wild, exciting career,
does it fill your heart? Something tells me that it
will not last. Some day you may need a friend in the
true sense of the term, one whom you have rescued
from evil and won to good. If ever you need
assistance, you will come to me for it, will you
not? Henceforth, I promise to live a new life, to
abandon the associates with whom I have too long
vied, and to devote myself to her whom I have
treated with such cruel neglect. You, too, will
change, will you not? And then, believe that in
him to whom you have read to-day a lesson which
he has so well merited, you will find a brother, a
friend!"</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself about me," replied Miss

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

Dareall. "I know not what I may do yet. I am
changeable as my career, fickle as my involuntary
fate. But order your horses round, and hasten home.
How strangely dark it has grown. We are about
to have a storm. There! Did you see that flash?
The day has been unusually close and oppressive.
There again! Pray make haste, or you may be
detained here for hours."</p>

<p>"No, no! I fear no storm," said Aubrey. "But
you? Am I to leave you here? How are you to get
home? Let me see you at least to town."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Miss Dareall, smiling; "that would be
a bad beginning. Consider what remarks might be
made. They might even reach <i>her</i> ears; and then&mdash;&mdash;
I think you have run sufficient risk already in driving
me here. Order your carriage round. Must I
insist?"</p>

<p>Aubrey left the room, and returned in a minute.
"I have obeyed you," he said; "and now, I suppose, 
I must bid you farewell."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "and for ever! Cease, I
beg of you, to think of me at all; unless a thought of
what I have been, nay, am, cause you to cling closer
and more fondly to her by whose pure affection you
are blest."</p>

"It may sound like an impertinence under the
circumstances," said Aubrey: "but once more remember, 
that if I can ever be of any service to you,
I implore you not to forget me then."</p>

<p>"I will not forget, Mr. Aubrey," she returned
hurriedly, but kindly; "but pray do not prolong 

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

this interview; good-bye, and may you be
happy."</p>

<p>Aubrey bowed very low, and left the room hastily.</p>

<p>"How little he thought," mused Miss Dareall to
herself, "of the service that he once rendered me.
And it is only three years ago. Heavens! what a
flash!" she exclaimed, as the lightning quivered
along the black arch of the storm-cloud whose
summit already reached the zenith, illuminating the
dark landscape and the winding river beneath.
"Well, I must see about getting back to town. I
feel quite faint for want of refreshment. I wish that
tiresome waiter had not taken everything away. I
declare I really felt nearly all that I said. I must
make haste and get rid of all this goodness, or else I
shall be quite unfitted for the theatrical world of spite.
I am sure that even old Wigster would make love
to me, if he dared, with his affectionate and paternal
style. Well, considering the youthful parts he plays
on the stage, one need not wonder much, if he forgets
himself sometimes off it. After all, why should he
not, when Juliets over fifty are in vogue? And that
burlesque the other day which looked as if it was
played by the inmates of dramatic almshouses returned 
again to visit the scenes of their former career!
As for Luckless, I don't believe half that he said
about his love for Aubrey's wife. Poor Harry! he is
always in love with some one, and latterly I thought
that if ever he was earnestly smitten, it was with
poor little me. Some women would hate her for it;
I do not. Gracious me, what a storm! I should
like to see this Mrs. Aubrey, just once. When Harry

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

told me of her blindness, I recollected all about her.
It was she who succoured that poor girl, who worked
for my maid, Floret. The poor thing was betrayed
and deserted&mdash;all in the regular and approved style
of such things. Mrs. Aubrey&mdash;it was before she was
blind&mdash;heard of it through her maid, and actually
went to see her, without a tract or a sermon. She
took her child in her arms, spoke to her like a sister,
got her out of her troubles, and never so much as
spoke a word of condemnation or reproof. Floret
almost cried when she told me of it. Well, I hope I
have done her some good in return."</p>

<p>After thus uttering her thoughts aloud, Miss
Dareall looked out of the window, shook her head,
rang the bell, and ordered, to the waiter's intense
surprise, a glass of wine and a biscuit.</p>

<p>"Well," said that worthy to another gentleman
of the same cloth, as he went out to execute the
command. "This is the finest start that I ever see.
Here's a couple come here; gent orders first-rate
dinner&mdash;female party quite the lady, and seems as if
nothing would please her&mdash;and they finish by touching 
nothing, not so much as a spoonful of soup.
Gent pays for everything just the same, and I
clapped in a bottle of wine as he didn't order along
with them as he did, but didn't drink; but he never
so much as looked at the bill. Now, there's folks as
comes here, as eat and drink everything they've
ordered, and then question everything in the bill.
'Waiter,' they say, 'was there three glasses of
curassoey? I thought there was only two.' But,
lawk, I know my customers in a minute. I can tell

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

'em&mdash;ah! by the way they wear their gloves, if that
was all. If a gent don't put on his right-hand
glove, and squeezes it all up like, though it's new
French kid, I guess he won't add up the hitems of
his bill, no, nor count his change neither for that
matter. But for a regular out-and-out mean hunks,
give me a rich earl, like that old Tipton and Wednesbury, 
or the Markis of Spitalfields. It's lucky
that there ain't many of such a scaly lot. There's
the earl, he never pays waiter nor driver; and as for
the markis, he'll step into the bar about one o'clock,
and he says to the missus quite gracious, 'What
have you got for dinner, to-day?' says he; so they
tell him roast leg of mutton, or pork, as the case may
be, for they're up to his little ways. 'Ah!' he says,
'I think I could eat a bit, if you was to cut me
plateful, and send it up-stairs.' Then they say, just
for form's sake, 'We've everything in the 'ouse, my
lord. Your lordship can have whatever your lordship 
pleases.' 'You're very good,' he says, 'but I
wouldn't have you take the trouble of cooking for me.
If you do 'appen to 'ave such a thing as a nice
potato,' he'll say, as if he didn't know there was.
Then by-and-bye he comes into the bar again, and
asks what he has to pay. 'I can't think of charging
you anything, except the beer, my lord,' says the
governor. 'I assure your lordship, we feel so honoured,' 
he says. 'I can't hear of such a thing,'
says the markis. 'I only hope your lordship could
make shift to eat it?' says the missus, smiling.
'Never enjoyed anything so much in my life, ma'am,'
he says, quite politely; and he hands her a shilling,

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

out of which she takes twopence, or fourpence, or
whatever it may be for the beer. 'Well,' he says to
the governor, 'my esteemed and worthy friend Tomkins,' 
he says, 'I suppose I must let you 'ave your
own way, but it's only on one condition, you know.'
'And what may that be, my lord,' says the missus.
'Why, that when my friend here,' says the markis,
condescendingly, ' 'appens to come by Pinchin Castle,
he shall come and dine with me.' 'Ah! my lord,'
says the governor, quite overcome, 'you're too good,'
he says. As if he didn't know all the time that the
servants at the castle, which is nine miles off, without 
counting the havenue, is all on board wages,
ever since the markis prosecuted his cook for stealing
the dripping, at Mumboro' Spring Sizes, just three
years ago this very month. But as I heard old Rumford 
of the 'Angel and Umbrella' say, 'I wish I had
a few of the same sort to drop in here. I'd stand 'em
vittles, ah, and drink too,' says he. 'Look at the
custom the haiystocracy brings with 'em, wherever
they go,' he says. And it's true. A lord who comes
reglar, is worth his weight in silver, except to waiters.
But then, if he brings them to the house that do
pay us, why I suppose, in the end, he may be said to
benefit we. As for the markis, I will say he is very
pleasant and well-spoken&mdash;he'll talk to any one by
the hour, and always calls every one by his name.
But I never did see any one hated like that Lord
Tipton. You should hear his own servants reckon
him up. He don't grudge himself anything, nothing 
isn't good enough for him; but he is as proud
as he is mean, and that's saying a good deal&mdash;that is,

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

a deal more than I should like to have said of me, if
I'd got as much in a year, as they say he has in a
day."</p>

<p>During the garrulous old waiter's talk, which was
partly to himself, and partly to any one he could get
to listen to him, Miss Dareall had finished her
biscuit and her toilet, and was hurrying through
the hall to gain the fly which was waiting to
convey her to the station, when an exclamation of
surprise and delight arrested her steps, and turning
round she saw Sir Harry Luckless in the act of
taking off his great-coat, and accompanied by a lady
and gentleman, who were being ushered into the
very room she had left.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! Kitty, how fortunate!" cried
Sir Harry; "that is if you are alone, as you seem
to be. Here I am, a wretched 'third party' with
Swellingham (you know Swellingham?) and Ada
Montmorency, of the Hesperides. Do take pity on me
and join us. But whatever brought you here? Are
you really alone?"</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed," she replied.</p>

<p>"I thought you went out with that fellow Aubrey,"
said Sir Harry; "of course, just because I asked
you not."</p>

<p>"So I did," she answered; "but not as you are
pleased to imagine, in order to annoy you. For once
I have been in earnest. I have done all; more than
you asked me. I came here with him, and he has
returned home, alone, full of repentance, and determined 
never again to neglect his afflicted wife."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

<p>"You are a dear, good girl," said Sir Harry; "but
come, do tell me all about it. I was quite puzzled
to know what on earth you meant; what induced
you to drive out here with him? I met Stingray,
as we came through Knightsbridge, and I pulled up
a moment! 'Whom do you think I saw just now?' he
said, and then he told me about you and Aubrey
driving past. He said you were so busy talking that
you didn't see him, though he was crossing the road.
Didn't the horses shy at anything? For I am sure
he is ugly enough. 'A pretty scandal there'll be to-morrow,' 
he said; 'I only hope it won't come to Mrs.
Aubrey's ears.' And then he said something, for
which I could have struck him; only that it would
be so ridiculous a thing to have an affair with a
literary celebrity, you know."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Miss Dareall; "I detest that
man, for his utter badness of heart. Society photographs 
him as a kind of virtuous sage, hiding his
kindness under an eccentric mask. But I know him,"
she said.</p>

<p>"A brutal allusion to her blindness," replied Sir
Harry, "worthy of the man. But he has learnt to
pass current his most diabolical remarks and suggestions 
by a sort of sugared confectionery of poisoned
words, as, for instance, 'Have you heard that Wiggins 
is about to be sold up, poor dear old boy!'
or 'Isn't it a sad affair that of Lord Fitzpavin and his
wife? Poor thing! poor thing! It was not her fault
after all, considering the circumstances&mdash;was it?'
But we must not stand talking here in this manner.

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

Join our party, and let me escort you back to town
in the train. Didn't you say you were going to the
Surrey Theatre this evening?"</p>

<p>"I had some idea of it, I believe," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Sir Harry, "what can be
better? We'll all go together, get out at Waterloo,
and set the elements at defiance. Have you dined?
No; that's capital. Come in, and let me introduce
you to Montmorency. Swellingham is not half such
a fool as he affects to be, I assure you. I rather like
the man. I knew him do a fine thing once; and do
you know he has always pretended ever since that it
was a mistake, and he didn't mean it. He saved a
man and his wife from drowning in a canal: and
when they turned out to be small tradespeople in
the City, Swell declared that he himself fell in, and
that the drowning people caught hold of him whether 
he would or no, and that it took nearly the
whole of Price and Gosling's stock of perfumery to
cleanse him from their touch. And the best joke is
that he himself is a tradesman's son. But come in,
there's a dear Kitty."</p>

<p>Miss Dareall signified her acquiescence.</p>

<p>"I never required a little cheerful conversation
more than I do now to restore me to the delights of
this sinful world," she said. "Do you know,
Harry, I have preached such a sermon that I ended
by almost converting myself. If goodness is only
half as infectious as wickedness, I advise you not to
come near me; unless you want to reform and take
to out-door preaching, or build a little Bethel all your
own, and become a second Burgeon. What a lot of

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

braces and slippers you would get from the female
part of your congregation! Here, tell them to send
that conveyance back to the stable. The driver is
getting quite wet."</p>

<p>So saying, she entered the room, and introduced
herself to Sir Harry's companions with all the nonchalance 
in the world.</p>

<p>WE must now follow Aubrey, who drove rapidly
back to town, heedless of the gathering storm. Behind 
him the Sphinx-like Tops, chuckling inwardly
at the manifest symptoms of a quarrel between
his master and Miss Dareall, which he plainly read.
Since his marriage, Aubrey had not thought so
deeply and seriously as he did now, subsequently to
his interview with the actress. The scales had fallen
from his eyes. "It is I; it is I," he said, "who
have been blind. But I will make amends for all.

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

We will quit this hated and pernicious atmosphere of
London life. We will go to Switzerland and Italy.
I must economise for a year or two, and then we will
take a pretty seaside house, and I will devote myself
to literary pursuits, and perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;become 
famous as a writer. This, with a little boating,
shooting, and fishing, will afford me sufficient occupation. 
If my dear, noble Blanche should not recover
her sight, I will show that I am worthy of her love.
Bless her, poor darling! how brutally I have behaved
to her of late!" Strange to say, he had never felt
such warm, earnest, nay, even passionate love for his
beautiful partner in life, as at that moment. The
words of Miss Dareall had not only disenchanted
him of his penchant for that eccentric young lady
herself; but they had restored to him the real and
abiding sentiment of his heart. Her suggestion that
he might in any way, or from any cause, lose Blanche,
pierced his very soul with a vague sense of dread.
Lose her? No! He felt that, without her, life would
be a blank! And by his own folly, cruelty, and
neglect! It was not to be thought of. He would
rush to her, clasp her in his arms, avow in general
terms the senseless conduct of which he had been
guilty, and promise never to leave her fair side unguarded 
any more.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "coward! unfeeling brute that I
have been! But I will make ample amends. And,
oh! if aught on earth can bring back the sight to
her sweet eyes, it shall be done!" Yet as he approached 
town, strange to say, Aubrey felt a disinclination 
to return home immediately. True, she

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

expected him; but if she waited an hour or two
longer, it would be the last time he would keep her
waiting in anxiety, or break an appointment with
her. So he drove to one of his clubs, and told Tops
to return, and to tell his mistress, with his best love,
not to wait dinner, but to expect him for certain
before ten.</p>

<p>If we must analyse the mixed motives which led
to this conclusion, they were as follows:&mdash;In the first
place he was flushed, sick, and excited; he did not
like to rush straight into her presence from that of
the Siren who had just voluntarily broken the spell
of her enchantments. He wished to collect his
thoughts, to regain his moral equilibrium, before
meeting her whom he had wronged. Besides, he had
a little design. There were all these presents he had
received back from Miss Dareall. He would take
them to the jeweller, who should exchange them on
his own terms; and he would purchase a magnificent
present for his wife on the anniversary evening of
their wedding-day. The price allowed he would
remit anonymously to the actress. It must be owned,
that for a man involved in debt, if not hopelessly
embarrassed, Aubrey was most magnificent and
princely in his ideas. He would do all this, dine
alone at the club, smoke a single cigar, and then,
calm in his virtuous resolve, seek Blanche, never,
never to neglect and desert her again! How happy
she would be to travel, to visit Italy&mdash;it had been one
of her fondest wishes, her most favourite desires. He
sighed as he thought that she could not see those
blue skies, those lilac mountains, those golden sunsets 

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

and brief purple twilights; but, at least, he
thought, I will be her interpreter, her link of communication 
with the outer world. And she will be
happy, yes, she will be happy; for she loves me as I
do not deserve to be loved. And so, thus thinking
of plans for future happiness, he betook himself to
the jeweller's shop, which occupied an hour or so,
and thence returned to his club, where he partook of
a simple dinner alone, with an appetite sharpened by
a mental ease and comfort which he had not known
for some time. It was about half-past eight, when
he sauntered up from the coffee-room to the smoking-room, 
which he found empty, and then with one of
those large full-flavoured cigars, which are so grateful
to a smoker now and then, when he devotes himself
systematically to the full enjoyment of a "weed,"
Arthur Aubrey sat down, and gave himself up to the
sober contemplation of the new life which he promised
himself. And then, he thought, if we should have
a child, a boy! or a little girl with Blanche's great
soft eyes, and long silky hair. And so the time
passed, and another hour crept on, as the timepiece
over the mantelpiece kept up its monotonous tick,
tick, until he began to think about returning home,
and just as he thought he really must move, his head
drooped, the remnant of his second cigar fell from
the releasing grasp of his finger and thumb, and Arthur
Aubrey slept. It was a quarter-past ten when he
awoke from a confused dream, and endeavoured to
recal the varied incidents of the day. As he stretched
himself and looked around, a gleam of blue light
illuminated the circular skylight of the smoking-room,

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

followed by a crash of thunder so startling and
instantaneous that it thoroughly finished the awakening 
process and restored him to his full consciousness
of all that had passed, why he was there, and where
he ought to have been at that hour. "Good
Heavens!" he muttered, "the storm has returned
with a vengeance. What tremendous rain&mdash;nay?
surely it is hail, by the sound." Another and another
flash and peal followed. He then remembered, as he
hurriedly descended the stairs, that he had dreamt of
a military execution, which was somehow mixed up
with Blanche, whose white and agonising face he saw
through the smoke of the musketry staring with the
glazed orbs of Death.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is no cab on the stand in the
square, sir," said the grey-headed porter, "but I'll
see," and he stepped outside in the storm, and blew
his whistle. Aubrey waited two or three minutes
with ill-concealed impatience. "It's a dreadful night,
sir," said the porter; "I thought it wasn't all over
this afternoon. I don't think I ever saw the lightning
more vivid. Hadn't you better wait, sir? There's
sure to be a cab return just now."</p>

<p>"No, Williams," replied Aubrey, "I don't mind
getting wet. I am anxious to get home. Mrs.
Aubrey is so very nervous in a thunder-storm,
especially at night."</p>

<p>The porter looked grave, and bowed respectfully.
He had heard of Aubrey's delinquencies as a husband. 
How little do such men as Aubrey think who
is taking stock of their offences. How ashamed
would he have been, had he known that he was the

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

subject of discussion among those decorous flunkies,
when off duty, or in their leisure moments at the
club. Aubrey rushed out and rapidly pursued his
way out of the square towards his house. A very
few instants sufficed to soak him to the skin. There
was something in the elemental strife which seemed
in unison with his thoughts. It was a little penance
he was paying for his neglect. He would tell Blanche
how he had fallen asleep, and the eagerness with
which he sought to repair his error. With what
fond solicitude she would receive him, dear, dear
girl!</p>

<p>"Hum!" quoth the old porter, as he scratched
out Mr. Aubrey's name in the hall day-book. "It's
no wife that's taking him out like that. Folks like
him can wait for cabs, when it's wives that is waiting
for them. It's all very well for him to say so, and I
don't object to the crammer; for I am one of those
that like to see a gentleman keep up appearances,
but still for all that he don't come over me. If his
wife sees him atween this and four in the morning,
I've not been hall-porter of this club these four-and-twenty 
year. She's a nice lady is Mrs. Aubrey, too.
Well, it is not always the nicest as is run after most,
leastways by them that has the best right. Let's see,
there was one of them pink notes again this morning,
scented till the place smelt like a doctor's shop.
What was it the butler told me yesterday he heard
one of our gents say about Mrs. Aubrey? Oh! I
know; he said she was gone blind. Well, she'd need
to be blind to his goings on, poor thing; that's all I
have to say about it. I wonder some folks ain't

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

afraid of being struck blind, or dead either for that
matter, in such a storm as this, when they're deceiving
their own flesh and blood: and going to church, too,
on a Sunday, looking as solemn as undertakers. But
their wives is as bad mostly, if all's true as I've heard
spoken. There's that old Chalkstoneville visits these
Aubreys, and the very sight of him ought to be
enough to make a modest woman fly the country.
I've been a married man these seven-and-twenty
years; but if he was to come a sniffing and a coughing 
about my premises, me and the lady that owns me
would be two in a jiffy, if she was to put up with it.
But perhaps he don't mind it, seeing as the duke
could come down heavy with damages. Such wretches
don't ought to be husbands, and if I had my way
they should never touch a penny of the money. I'd
give it towards an asylum for some of them poor
creatures walking about the streets to-night. It's
mostly married men, and men that get married after
all they've been and done, that brings girls to shame
and want. The law wants altering, like a many
other laws in England. Why, as I was saying to
Mrs. Williams yesterday, don't some of these religious
humbugs, that are so very anxious about the souls of
the poor, that they wouldn't let them buy so much as
a red-herring or a bunch of radishes on Sunday, give
us poor club servants a holiday? Perhaps they think,
by denying the lower classes, as they call them, everything 
in this world, they make them more sure of
going to heaven. But the system don't work, in my
opinion, according to their notion of compensation.
It's more likely to end in neither rich nor poor being

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

saved; for if the rich begin by being selfish, they
drive the poor into being vicious, and so the old
gentleman gets the best of both sides." How long
Mr. Williams's soliloquy might have lasted we cannot
say, but just then another member of the club drove
up in a Hansom to get his pink notes, besides which
he wanted a cheque changed. At the great club
of Civil and Religious Progress, they don't change
cheques. Possibly the Committee consider it would
be too tempting to some of the Irish members, whose
sanguine temperament might lead them to overdraw
their accounts, especially at a late hour of the evening. 
For the "Progress" boasted a large representation 
of those legislative patriots, who, some say, are
ever seeking to exact that justice in personal instalments, 
which they are willing to forego for Ireland
as a whole. Graft the vices of a trading Saxon
community upon Celtic necessities and corruption,
and the result is prejudicial to both nations alike.
Nothing of their country remains to such men, but
her eloquence without fire, and her brogue without
grace. Well may the countrymen of Grattan, of
Curran, and of Burke, desire the restoration of that
local self-government which it was equally a blunder
and a crime to disturb!</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">THE COBRA ON THE HEARTH-RUG.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">But great and varied as was the genius of this gifted writer, that for
which the nineteenth century will chiefly prize him was the geniality
of his disposition and the overflowing tenderness of his heart. While
scathing with his fiery satire the littlenesses and the basenesses with
which he saw the circles he mixed in teem; while watering the flowers
of the mock Eden of fashionable society with a can of vitriol, in
which one might imagine that scorpions were dissolved, he has been
known to arrest the progress of a whole party of his admirers in the
street, to purchase the freedom of a lark or thrush from its small prison
in the possession of a street urchin; to make a "circumbendibus," as
he called it, to avoid crushing a snail, or to relieve the necessity of a
beggar woman with a half-crown, which he would pleasantly borrow
from the richest and meanest of the satellites who revolved around
the mighty planet of his social career. He was emphatically a good
and great creature in the best sense of the word.&mdash;<i>From the future
Epitaph of Mr. Stingray, written by his bitterest enemy in life, to accompany 
a cartoon in the</i> "<i>Weekly Bosh</i>."</p>

<p>AS soon as Mr. Tops had made his horses comfortable 
after their rapid drive, and seen the "pheayton"
extra-carefully cleaned and put into the coach-house,
he repaired to the Maison Aubrey, in order, if possible, 
to obtain an interview with Susan, and acquaint
her with the decided step he had taken. He knew
that so long as Blanche needed her services, it was
not very likely that Susan would be induced to leave
her by marriage or anything else; and, to tell the

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

truth, Mr. Tops did not feel over comfortable at the
thought of the separation that would ensue between
him and his charmer.</p>

<p>It was quite nine o'clock before Susan came down,
and she looked both sad and cross, when she did make
her appearance. At first, she was evidently about to
treat Tops to a little "trainin' for materimony," as
he somewhat technically called it. But when he met
her at the top of the kitchen stairs and implored her
in his simple fashion to pull up and listen, for he had
something very particular to say, Mrs. Susan condescended 
to lend him her best attention. The truth
is, she saw at a glance that something extraordinary
had happened, and flattered herself that at last the
fidelity of Tops was shaken, either through the
strength of his attachment to her, or owing to some
new and flagrant misconduct of his master.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "Mr. Tops, what have you got
to say so very particular? I dare say it would have
kept very well until to-morrow; or for ever, I dare
say, if the truth was told, as far, at least, as I am
concerned;" and she tossed her head scornfully.
"But, perhaps, first you'll have the kindness to inform 
me where you left your brute of a master?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Tops; "I left him at the
club. Didn't Mr. Binsby give you the message I left
for your missus?"</p>

<p>"And a pretty one it was, like the rest," replied
Susan. "I wonder you're not ashamed to carry such
messages. I'll tell you what, Mr. Tops, there'll soon
be an end to this. That poor angel up-stairs is dying
as fast as she can&mdash;dying of his neglect and unkindness. 

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

Oh!" she cried, as a tremendous peal of
thunder burst over the house, "I wonder he isn't
afraid to be out such a night. Here, come up into
the front drawing-room a moment, if your boots is
clean. I shall be nearer to missus, if she should
want me sudden. I wonder she hasn't rung before
this; she's so mortal afraid of tempest."</p>

<p>"Susan," said Tops, slowly, when the pair had
arrived in the pretty and elegant little room so often
desecrated by the fashionable world; "I've been and
done it. That's what I've got to say; now you
knows it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Tops?" asked Susan.
"Do you mean that you have given notice?"</p>

<p>"There ain't no notice about it," replied Tops.
"Me and master had some words. I told him I
didn't happrove exactually of his goings on, and the
wheels of his temper took fire, that's hall; and I told
him he could suit hisself."</p>

<p>"You won't leave for a month, at any rate?" inquired 
Susan, looking rather alarmed.</p>

"To-morrow morning," replied Tops, "when I've
fed and watered the 'osses, I takes leave of them and
master for hever. I dessay old Binsby will settle
hall hup between me and the guv'nor, as I don't
want no words about it. He's been a very good
master to me, and I never had a sitiation as was
more comfortable. I'm not one as'll say different,
though we can't hit it together hany longer."</p>

<p>"Bless me. Tops," said Mrs. Susan, "I'd no idea
you were going to be so sudden."</p>

<p>"Nor I neither," was the response. "But when

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

things breaks down, and nothink you can do can
mend 'em, what's the use of looking on and making
yourself unhappy? I never see a pair run better in
harness than master and missus, hup to the last stage
or two."</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Susan, "though you don't express 
yourself very clearly, I know what you mean.
Go on, and tell me who's caused the stage-coach, or
family carriage, or whatever it is, to run so uneven."</p>

<p>"There never was a pair run better," resumed
Tops, "nor them two creeturs for a couple of years
and hupwards. And if this misfortin has overtook
her, as it can't be doubted that it 'ave done, what
of it? Them as is blind ain't so likely to shy, and
requires a trifle more tender 'andling. That's where
it is and what it is; and you couldn't say more, hif
you was to talk for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"And so you're going to leave us so sudden?"
said Susan, with some little indication of feeling, and
a slight tremor in her not unmusical voice, which
Mr. Binsby was once heard to say he had taken for
the young madam's. "And it's all my doing. Don't
shake your head, sir, like that. I know it is. It's
owing to what I said this morning. Well, we shall
see each other sometimes, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tops, "if I don't accept a hoffer to
take a lot of 'osses over to Rooshy."</p>

<p>"But you never will?" said Susan, showing more
concern than she had yet indicated.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Tops; "it depends, you
see."</p>

<p>"Upon what?" was the rejoinder.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

<p>"Upon the voice of my charmer," replied Tops;
"whether she tells me to stop or not. That's where
it is, you see."</p>

<p>"Really," said Susan, "you're talking hiroglyphics. 
I didn't know charmers had anything to do
with the plans of grooms. But I suppose it's some
of your betting phraseology."</p>

<p>"I think it's you are trying to puzzle a feller,"
said Tops, "as is yourn, and yourn honly, if you'll
honly say the word. And as I'm going to-morrow,
I thought you would&mdash;&mdash;" And here Tops fairly
broke down, and his voice trembled with uneducated
pathos, quite as effective in its way as the lisp of the
most elegant votary of the little blind god.</p>

<p>"Well," said Susan, "I don't know but what&mdash;&mdash;
We shall see each other sometimes, and I don't know
but that some day, I may even consent to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be Mrs. Tops!" exclaimed that personage.
"Hooray!" and he threw his hat up and caught it,
and then seized Susan round the waist, and imprinted 
a chaste salute upon her lips.</p>

<p>"There, go along with you, that'll do! What a
cap I shall have! What is the man about! One
would think I was a 'oss, as you call it. But you
really must mend your grammar."</p>

<p>"Grammar be blowed!" cried Tops; "you've got
larning enough for a four-'oss coach, let alone two.
We don't want larning in the public line. I can
chalk hup the beer with crosses, and you can keep
the books, and hedicate the babbies as much as you
please. I'll give you your 'ead, Susan; I'll give you
your 'ead, and I know you'll bowl along the tarnpike-road 

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

of life like a&mdash;like a butterfly. I'll give
you the box-seat, and what can any young 'ooman
wish for more?"</p>

<p>"And when do you think you will return from
Russia?" asked Susan very demurely, smoothing her
apron.</p>

<p>" 'Tain't likely I'd go now, if the Hemperor was
to ax me hisself," was the answer. "Do you think
I'm going to bolt clean off the course arter a start
like this?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," replied Susan, "you do snatch
a body up quick. But I suppose I must have you, if
it's only out of compassion. Have you heard of any
situation near?"</p>

<p>Tops executed a series of nods and winks, ending
with a face somewhat expressive of disgust. "I'm
going to let myself down, Susan, very low; but a
few score of them kisses of yourn, once or twice a
week, will pull me hup agen all right. I've thought
of living with hold Lawyer Grinderby, if master'll
give me a note of reckymindation, which he can't
very well be off doing of; it's unkimmon low, and
hold Binsby will turn his nose hup as hif he smelt
pison; but it's hall for your sake, Susan, and since
you've said the word, I'll live with Old Scratch hisself
to be anywheres near you."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment," said Mrs. Susan;
"but Mr. Grinderby is quite bad enough to show me
that you really do care for me a little."</p>

<p>"I should recken he were," rejoined Tops. "Why,
he honly keeps two 'osses, and they're forty year
hold, if they're a day."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

<p>"Forty years old, Mr. Tops?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "between 'em, I'll pound it;
and a landau, as they calls it, which the springs is so
stiff, and the leather so musty, that when it is opened,
it puts me in mind of a grin on his own blessed
parchment face."</p>

<p>"Well," said Susan, "I suppose I am in for it.
But there is one great obstacle to our union;" and
she accomplished a very sentimental sigh.</p>

<p>"Hobstacle?" eagerly inquired Tops in a fright.
"Whatever do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The name!" answered Susan. "However can
I be called 'Mrs. Tops?' "</p>

<p>"Go along with you. How can you skeer a feller
like that?" asked the owner of that monosyllabic
patronymic.</p>

<p>"It's the name that 'skeers' me, as you call it,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"I knowed a young man," observed Tops, "as
lived at Epsom, as changed hisn to Plant-a-jenny;
and if I don't hendanger the fammerly hestates, I
ain't pertickler. Look here!" he added, pulling
out a "Racing Calendar," "what do you say to
'Caracticus,' or 'Heclipse?' They was both on 'em
winners."</p>

<p>"We'll see about it by-and-bye. But now that
I've been so stupidly good-natured, and that master
has discharged you, besides insulting your feelings,
you won't mind telling me a little&mdash;just ever so little,
of his goings on. Won't you, dear James?"</p>

<p>"Is that the voice of my Susan, as I hear a

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

tempting me to sech a hact? Say you're only a
trying it on."</p>

<p>"Is this your confidence?" asked the lady. "Do
you call this giving me the box-seat, or whatever
nonsense you were talking just now?"</p>

<p>"But there ain't no seats yet," replied Tops; "the
carridge ain't only jest hordered."</p>

<p>"Besides, you stupid fellow," resumed the insidious
Susan, "do you think I would do missus, or master
either for that, any harm?"</p>

<p>"That's not the pint," replied Tops.</p>

<p>"Which is?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"The honner of J. Tops, Esqvire, which he has
never suffered to grow yaller yet, and don't mean to
neither, which pison honly cleans, as it does real tops&mdash;the 
most beautiful hobjict in Natur', Susan, when
they air cleaned proper."</p>

<p>"Now, do go away," responded Susan; "I shall
have missus here directly."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Tops; "say what you like of
master, he halways knowed what 'osses is, and how
things should be done. Come, don't be angry with
a feller, when you know he can't help hisself;" and
he again embraced the not unwilling object of his
affections.</p>

<p>"Help himself?" returned Susan; "I think you
do help yourself, and rather freely too. But since it
is the last time you will have the opportunity in this
house, I suppose I must put up with it. Good-night,
Tops. I'm not angry."</p>

<p>"I'm as 'appy as a sand-boy, and wouldn't change

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

places with the lad as'll win the Derby, or the stud-groom 
of the Hemperor of Rooshy, though I'm going
to live with that hold limb of Satan at Peckham, and
drive them pair of twenty-year-hold hanimals of hisn
with noses like the Duke of Wellington," cried Tops,
as, with a variety of pantomimic gestures of an
amorous description, he left the room.</p>

<p>"I can't say," soliloquised Susan, "but what I
like him better for his obstinacy. There's the bell at
last. Then master is returned;" and she went to the
door and listened. "That's not his step," she said,
after awhile; "who can it be at this time of night?
A quarter to ten, I declare. I hope there's nothing
wrong. Oh, lor!" she said, as Mr. Stingray made
his appearance, "it's that old wretch of an author.
Whatever can he want at this hour?"</p>

<p>"A very late call, Mrs. Susan, this," observed that
individual, seating himself very deliberately, "and on
such a night too, though I think the storm is breaking. 
I hear that Mr. Aubrey is out. I wanted most
particularly to see him. Is he generally away from
home at this hour?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Susan, "that is, not always."</p>

<p>"Not always! hem!" observed the philosopher.
"And your mistress is gone to bed unwell, is
she?"</p>

<p>"No, not gone to bed. But she is not very well.
Do you wish to see her, sir?" replied Susan.</p>

<p>"By no means," was the answer; "I will stay
here. Don't go away, my dear; I don't bite.
Your master and mistress ought to be very happy
together?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

<p>"Yes, sir," said Susan, "certainly."</p>

<p>"But it's very sad!" rejoined Stingray, pathetically.</p>

<p>"They say he knows everybody's business," quoth
Susan to herself. "Perhaps I may learn all about
master's goings on, if I'm only sharp enough. Did
you want anything, sir," she asked aloud, "before I
go to missus?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray beckoned her to him, and finding
that she did not approach him, he walked close up to
her. As he did so, possibly he caught sight of a
form slowly entering the room, through the already
open door. It was that of Blanche Aubrey. Noiselessly 
she felt her way, till she reached the table, and
then she felt about, until she put her hand upon a
tall high-backed chair, one of the two she had herself 
worked in embroidery with flowers and birds.
In this she sat down unperceived by Susan, and with
her face turned away from them.</p>

<p>"What was you pleased to say, sir?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>Blanche half raised herself, as she became aware
that there were others in the room. Nay, she was
on the very point of asking who it was, when Stingray 
said:</p>

<p>"What a pity it is, my dear, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Susan at a venture.</p>

<p>"To think that your master should neglect his wife
for such a woman," rejoined Stingray. "So distressing! 
Some people think it will all come right,
when he has sown his wild oats. But it's too late,
I think, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded poor Susan, whose curiosity,

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

it must be owned, was far exceeded by her anxious
dread.</p>

<p>"The doctors give no hope of Mrs. Aubrey's sight
being restored&mdash;do they?" pursued Stingray.</p>

<p>"No, sir," uttered Susan.</p>

<p>"Poor thing! I felt sure of it. Never <i>is</i> restored
in such cases. How fortunate could she always
remain blind in another sense&mdash;I mean to your master's 
incomprehensible infatuation for that good-for-nothing 
hussy, with whom, doubtless, he is at this
moment; and who, between ourselves, laughs at him
all the time."</p>

<p>"There is, then&mdash;&mdash;" exclaimed Susan, but checking 
herself, she said, merely; "yes, sir, indeed, it
would be quite a mercy."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Stingray, "there he lingers,
chained to her triumphal car by the multiplicity of
his rivals. Would you believe that a man could be
so utterly absurd as to be jealous of such a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, no&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;" replied Susan, "just what
I was thinking of."</p>

<p>"And to think that the whole world is laughing
at the farce, and that his wife should be the only one
not to know it," continued Stingray. "Of course,
you don't ever drop a hint, eh?"</p>

<p>"Me, sir?" replied Susan; "oh dear no, not for
the universe."</p>

<p>"Very proper. I respect your principle, although
a revelation might lead to good. Your mistress
might bring him to his senses, threaten him with Sir
Crossbill Crossbill. Besides, it is impossible that she
should remain ignorant much longer&mdash;not very likely,

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

with such a rival as Kitty Dareall, whom I saw the
day before yesterday riding your mistress's white
Arab in the Park."</p>

<p>"Kitty Dareall! My mistress's white Arab!"
stammered poor Susan. "Impossible! that is, yes,
sir, of course, just so."</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray chuckled, and glowered through his
spectacles, which looked like danger-signals on a
railway line, as the light from Susan's candle fell
upon them. "She actually didn't know a word about
it," he said to himself. "It is too bad, isn't it?" he
continued, addressing Susan rather more loudly than
one would have thought necessary, considering how
close they were to each other: but then Stingray
was in the habit of speaking loudly. "He might do
it more quietly, eh? Awful character, that Kitty!
Of course, child, you know all about her. Can't tell
you much you don't know." And the playful man
chucked Mrs. Susan under the chin. "Oh, you
wicked little creature!"</p>

<p>As Mrs. Susan often declared afterwards, she
could have run a carving-fork into him at that
moment for daring to lay so much as a finger on her;
but at the time she saw fit to dissemble.</p>

<p>"Don't, if you please, sir," she said, with a curtsy.
"I dare say I've heard a good deal more than I
ought; but if you'd please to tell me a little
more."</p>

<p>"Delightful human nature!" quoth Stingray, half
aloud. "Well, my dear," he continued, "Kitty,
whom, as you know, your master follows with a
devotion worthy of a better object, as he doubtless

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

did your poor mistress before marriage; Kitty, of
whom my foolish friend Aubrey is the greatest of
the deluded victims and adorers&mdash;Kitty is a sleek
tigress, a fascinating monster. You have heard how
she knocks folks about like ninepins, and sets half
the fashions in London; how she horsewhipped Lord
Eppingforest, fought three policemen, and hoaxed
the Archbishop of Middlesex, all in a single afternoon: 
and then appeared in the stage-box of the
Thespis Theatre, looking as demure and glossy as if
nothing had happened. Of course, you know that
the Duke of Chalkstoneville, and Sir Harry Luckless,
and half a score more, are the constant supporters
and ministers of her extravagance and absurdity.
It is, indeed, to be lamented that amid these your
poor master, my friend Aubrey, should be the chief,
as he is the most deluded of her victims. But,
considering the example set him by others, perhaps
he is not so much to blame as everybody says he
is; and even now, could he be brought to a full
sense of the wrong he is inflicting on his beautiful
and accomplished wife, he might still, if not too
late, make a tolerably exemplary and attentive husband; 
that is, as the world goes, my dear!"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Stingray helped himself to a considerable 
pinch of snuff; and Susan, no longer able to
restrain herself, burst into a fit of crying.</p>

<p>"Why, how now?" exclaimed the great philanthropical 
satirist. "What have we here? You're
not really crying, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not too late! not to blame!" cried Susan, repeating 
his words. "Oh, oh!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

<p>"Dear me!" said Stingray, "considering you
knew all before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is false. I knew nothing, save that my poor,
dear mistress is neglected by a monster. Oh, oh!"
rejoined Susan, still weeping. "And you," she
added, turning sharply round upon Mr. Stingray,
"are a brute to tell me."</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity!" said that gentleman. "We are
in our tantrums. Well, as your master doesn't seem
to be coming home quite so soon as your mistress
expected him, I think I won't wait any longer.
There, good-bye, my dear." And Mr. Stingray
made a clumsy and ineffectual effort to pat her on
the cheek, which was returned by a slap delivered
with no little energy that narrowly missed his
face, for which it was intended, and was delivered 
somewhere between his ear and the collar of
his coat.</p>

<p>"So, so, pretty pussy!" he cried, "you're getting
dangerous. Now, mind you don't repeat a word
that I have told you to any one, though it is known
to all the world, I say, all the world!"</p>

<p>With this cheerful piece of information Mr. Stingray 
put on his hat, and walked briskly to the door.
"Mind and tell your master that I called, when he
<i>does</i> return," he said. "I shall be at the Kemble
Club to-morrow at two o'clock. It's about a dramatic
charity I want to see him, and the arrangements for
poor dear Bob Diltrees' funeral at Kensal Green."</p>

<p>With this Mr. Stingray kissed his huge paw, by
way of adieu to Susan, and left the poison which he

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

had so carefully distilled into her ears to work as it
might. Did he observe that other occupant of the
room? Had he caught a glimpse of her white
dress and that pale cameo-like face, gleaming brighter
for its dark surrounding of tumultuous hair? Had
he beheld her, as she glided across the apartment with
her brief blind gaze turned a few moments towards
them, ere she sank trembling and convulsed into the
gorgeous high-backed chair? Had he seen her, as she
rose up once, and once only, during his conversation
with Susan, and showed a countenance so wan and
ghastly, with the tips of her slender fingers pressed
on her brow, like props to a fallen gable, like supports 
to a reeling brain? Had he seen that wild, distracted 
and appealing stare into vacancy? It is
charity to suppose that he had not. It is a question
that had better, for the credit of human nature,
remain unsolved.</p>

<p>As his heavy tread was heard descending the stairs,
Susan cast a glance of mingled hatred and relief at
his departure after him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I should think your friends'
burials were just what you delight in, you ill-omened
old raven, you! It just suits you to see your ugly
name in the newspapers along with a lot of humbugs
like yourself. You never thought of helping the
poor gentleman when he was alive, and now you
make a rare pretence with your private theatricals
and rubbish, just to make a fuss about your own
names. I should like to know how much the widow
and children, poor things, are likely to get out of it,

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

when you've had your dinners and speeches out of
the fund, as you call it. I wonder whether Tops is
gone. I should like to let him know what I've heard,
and whether it is possible to keep it from coming to
her." And the kind-hearted girl dried her eyes as
well as she could, and hastily left the room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">NEVER ANY MORE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">A broken lute on a darkened floor,<br/>

A faded token of love long o'er,<br/>

The sound of a footstep to a door<br/>

Which once came often, but comes no more.</p>

<p>BLANCHE, who had sunk down in the chair with
her throbbing temples pressed between her hands, remained 
for some minutes perfectly still and motionless. 
There was no sound to be heard in the room,
save the monotonous ticking of the large French
timepiece, though the heavy mutterings of the retreating 
storm ever and anon caused the windows to
rattle slightly. Suddenly, with a sharp, piercing, but
stifled cry, like that of a wounded creature in a brake,
Blanche once more rose, and tottered a step or two
from her chair, till she reached the table, which she
grasped convulsively by the edge. There she stood
awhile, with dilated nostrils and heaving bosom. Then
she steadied herself, undid the bracelets from her still
beautiful arms, and laid them carefully on the table.
Her watch, set with brilliants, her chain, her magnificent 
rings, and even her diamond ear-rings followed.
Listen! she is talking, with low and husky voice.

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

Hush! what is it she says? There is something in
the tone of her voice that speaks of accents nearly
numbered on this earth, of a life about to be cut short&mdash;her 
words sound like echoes from the ante-chamber
of Death!</p>

<p>"I have had a terrible dream, Arthur, dearest
Arthur!" she said. "Where are you? Ah, where?
What was it that voice said, whose every accent burnt
into my brain, until I could hear no more? My
husband faithless? And with whom? Blind, blind,
oh, so blind, and deserted, betrayed! On the anniversary 
of our wedding-day, too! He spoke so kindly
when he went out. Can it be true, all which that
dreadful man spoke about, and said that everybody
knows, save one alone, myself? Yes, yes; I have
felt it long, dreamt of it, all but known it, and now I
know. What hour is it?" As she said this, she felt
for the watch she had laid down on the table, and
pressed a repeater. "Ten o'clock!" she continued.
"Ten! His last gift, his last! It was a cruel gift;
for it told me the hours of his absence. It will do so
no more. When he comes home, he will be spared
one sin, one falsehood more, and then he will be
free&mdash;free as he could desire. What is that noise?
'Tis the storm and the wind without." She listened
a few moments, and then continued: "There is no
one here to witness my despair. He will come here and
find the trinkets, the presents, with which he thought
to lull the dark suspicions of my heart. But he will
see the blind, neglected wife no more. He can give
them to <i>her</i>. I left the cloak and hood, which I
sometimes put on to watch for him, when it grows

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

cold late into the night, in the corner behind my
harp. Let me get it, and then&mdash;&mdash;" Whilst uttering
these last words she felt her way with incredible
skill and patience, until she found the articles of
which she was in search, and then guided herself by
the wall to the door. "The storm outside rages. And
now, without a tear, I go forth blind into the night.
But I cannot stay here any more&mdash;no, no, not
here!"</p>

<p>She left the room-door ajar, and felt her way down-stairs 
into the hall. Anon came the brief patter and
dripping of the rain and the noise of the wheels of a
passing cab, as she opened the street-door. Then the
door closed harshly and reluctantly, as if conscious
upon whom it shut. The noise of the closing door
was heard by Susan as she came to the top of the
kitchen-stairs, very red about her cheeks and eyes.
She knew all the servants were below. "Who can
it be?" she thought. Then the idea of thieves possessed 
her violently. So she ran down again, and
called Mr. Binsby, who listened to her story with an
air of patronising incredulity, which at any other
time would have roused Susan's ire. At last, he
condescended to look through the rooms on the
ground-floor, through motives of politeness; but in a
manner which would have tempted any looker-on to
wish that a thief might bolt from underneath the
table between his legs and upset so much importance, 
which was, at least, equal to that of an acting
member of the Court of Lieutenancy of the City of
London about to sign the commission of an ensign
of Volunteers. The page, however, at Mrs. Susan's

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

suggestion, peeped under various articles of furniture, 
and the footman looked into the closets and
cupboards. Mr. Binsby at length shook his head in
token that further search was not to be made.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Susan; "I am as certain that
some one opened and shut that street-door as that I
stand here; and whoever it was went out, or else they
must have been in the hall directly after."</p>

<p>"The hats and coats is hall right," said Mr.
Binsby, conclusively, and the search was ended.</p>

<p>Susan, still in dread, went up-stairs, accompanied
by the under-housemaid, whom she requested to go
with her. They looked into the drawing-room together, 
before going up to Mrs. Aubrey's room.</p>

<p>"Missus said she would lie down nearly two hours
agone," said Susan, "but she can't be asleep; at
least, if she is, it's the first time I've known her do
such a thing, while that cruel brute stayed out as
usual. But either she or some one has been here;
for I shut the drawing-room door, after old Stingray
had gone, I'm as sure as&mdash;&mdash; Lor! whatever's this?"</p>

<p>The two girls had entered the drawing-room
together, and Susan's eye had fallen upon the little
heap of jewellery on the table. For a moment she
appeared stupefied, and then rushed out of the room
and darted up-stairs. She came down again pale
and breathless.</p>

<p>"The door! the door!" she gasped, and then ran
to the top of the stairs, and shrieked out, "Missus!
Mrs. Aubrey! missus! She's run away&mdash;gone such
a night as this! and she blind, too! Here, don't
stand staring there," she cried to the housemaid;

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

"run down and tell them. We must all go after
her."</p>

<p>Then she rang the bell furiously, while the housemaid 
hurried down-stairs.</p>

<p>"Whatever can be the meaning of this? Ah!"
she cried, "if she heard what that old wretch was
saying. He spoke loud enough, and the door was
open. Oh, my dear mistress, I shall never see her
any more!"</p>

<p>So saying, she ran down-stairs, in order to send
all the domestics in pursuit, and found Mr. Binsby
looking up from his chair with the same look of incredulity 
with which he had listened to the story of
the street-door.</p>

<p>"Have you looked in her bed as well as elsewhere?" 
he inquired, putting down his newspaper,
and looking over his spectacles at Susan, as she
entered with a face and manner which caused him
to drop his jaw slightly, and finish his sentence more
abruptly than he would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>"Make haste! all of you, and go after her!"
screamed Susan. "I tell you she's gone out, and
such a night as this, too. It was her I heard shut
the street-door. She's heard&mdash;Mr. Stingray talking&mdash;she's 
gone out&mdash;I shouldn't wonder&mdash;to destroy&mdash;herself. 
Oh! my dear, dear mistress, we shall never
see her any more!"</p>

<p>And the faithful creature wrung her hands in an
agony of tears. A change came over Mr. Binsby's
whole deportment. His face grew so fixed and serious,
that as the page was after heard to say, "It was
horful to see him. He looked just like 'Amlet in

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

the play, honly hever so much holder, you know."
Then Mr. Binsby lost his self-possession, and grasping
a candlestick, although the lamps outside were all
lighted&mdash;a circumstance which he was often wont to
narrate afterwards&mdash;he hurried up-stairs, followed
by them all, and opened the street-door. All was
silent outside. The pale blue lightning gleamed
on the wet pavement, and lit up the architectural
varieties of the neighbouring houses, converting
shadows into lights, and lights into shadows, showing
a desperate tom-cat springing with arched back across
the road outward or homeward bound on the first
opportunity after the storm, and revealing the shining
oilskin cape and ungainly form of a distant policeman 
turning a corner. But nothing else was to be
seen.</p>

<p>"Here!" said Binsby, with energy; for, strange to
say, he had surrendered his incredulity instantaneously, 
and accepted Mrs. Aubrey's departure as a
fact on Susan's last revelation. "Here, my boy,"
addressing the page, "you go with them," pointing
to the cook and housemaid, "that way; and you,"
he said to Susan and the footman, "foller hup the
street. I'll go and speak to the perlice. You
two," he said, to the scullery-maid and second housemaid, 
"stop here. Some one must be left in the
'ouse."</p>

<p>No one would have recognised Binsby at that
moment. He looked a third less large, and all his
importance had vanished. For he dearly loved and
respected his young lady; though he did say some
weeks after, that if she had been in a different position 

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

before marriage, such a dreadful thing couldn't
have happened.</p>

<p>"And why so?" asked Mr. Binsby. "The reasons
is hobvious. If people of rank was to give in to
jealousy, there'd be an end to all their marridges."</p>

<p>But Mr. Binsby, at least for one night of his life,
neither sought the repose needed by his weighty
frame, nor uttered a single pompous or unnecessary
phrase.</p>

<p>The whole party had scarcely disappeared on their
search, and the plaintive cries of Susan had only
just become inaudible from the steps of the Maison
Aubrey, as she looked in search of a white, prostrate
form down the gloom of a neighbouring street, when
some one hurriedly opened, with a latch-key, the
door which they had just quitted, and bounded up the
familiar steps into the brilliantly illuminated drawing-room 
of his tasteful and luxurious home.</p>

<p>"Blanche! dearest Blanche!" cried that ever-welcome 
intruder&mdash;before his eyes grew accustomed
to the light, and he saw that he addressed only the
inanimate furniture of the room&mdash;"forgive me this
last unkindness, and I will never, never come home
late any more."</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v2ch13">

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">OUR SENSATION-HEADER.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The Republic of Venice had its one Bridge of Sighs; the limited
monarchy of Great Britain its half-dozen, and that in its chief metropolis 
alone.</p>

<p>IT may seem impossible that Blanche could have
got clear away from the house that night, but she
did so in a very short space of time. Had she been
asked how, she could not have told; nor did she ever
remember distinctly how the first half-hour passed.
She fell repeatedly, and heard once or twice, without
regarding them, the hoarse challenges of the drivers
of vehicles, probably cabs, from which she must have
had a narrow escape. The first thing of which she
had a distinct recollection, was the voices of children
surrounding her, probably in the entrance of some
narrow court or alley, where the neglected little
wretches were playing, if it could be called play, at
that hour, while their parents, if they had any, were
possibly thieving, or perhaps working hard and late
to eke out their miserable existence. She heard a
girl's voice calling her "lady," and pleading hard for
a halfpenny.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

<p>"I will give you this," said Blanche, with hollow
accents, feeling in her pocket for some loose silver
which she happened to have there, "if you will lead
me to Westminster Bridge; for I am blind."</p>

<p>"Let me go! No, I'll take the lady! I knows the
shortest way! Get out, will yer! I was fust!" and
similar cries surrounded her on all sides.</p>

<p>"It's me as spoke first," said the voice that first
begged from her; "I'm Nelly Brown; father's dead
and mother's out charing. Please, I know the way."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," replied Blanche, in husky
tones; "you shall go with me and guide me!"</p>

<p>The news soon spread that a young lady, "drest,
oh, so beautiful!" and blind as Sal Tomkins's old
man, who had a board hung round his neck, and a
little dog to lead him, and who earned an excellent
living, with the connivance of the police, somewhere
in the West-end, had chartered little Nelly Brown
to lead her to Westminster Bridge: the consequence
was, that for some time Blanche and her guide were
followed by a crowd of small children, asking the
former to chuck a ha'penny, and jeering the latter
unmercifully; but Blanche heeded them not. Ere
long, however, the appearance of a policeman fluttered 
the ragged tribe of young Volscians; and the
pair pursued their way unmolested, at least by the
juvenile gathering of little ragamuffins which at first
dogged their steps. More than one policeman hesitated 
on his beat, as if irresolute whether or not to
challenge their future progress. But these apparently
saw nothing to justify such a proceeding, and certainly 

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

there was not. Twice they were subjected to
the attentions of amatory prowlers, struck by the
figure, dress, and beauty of as much of the countenance 
of Blanche as they could discern. But each
gallant, after a look at the fixed stare and strange
expression of the mysterious lady, thus led along by a
dirty beggar-girl, slackened his pace and dropped off;
nor was Blanche in the slightest degree aware of the
fact of their scrutiny or baffled chase. A hag-like
old woman hung on their skirts some time with villainous 
intent of plunder; but as Blanche had left
every object of jewellry behind her, the prospect
did not seem sufficiently tempting to induce perseverance 
in such nefarious project or attempt. A
drunken navvy did actually seize her in his arms, when
they neared the bridge just opposite the venerable
old Abbey, which loomed grand and indistinct against
the dark pile of thunder-clouds beyond. The beggar
child beat him with her small dirty paws, and cried
"Let the blind lady alone!" and he relinquished his
hold and staggered away muttering to a companion,
"I say, Bill, here's a go. S'elp me &mdash;&mdash;! I got hold
of a blind woman for a fancy gal."</p>

<p>At length they were on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Lead me to the side," said Blanche, "and let me
lean upon the parapet. I can hear the water beneath.
Tell me exactly where we are." The child described to
her as well as she could where they stood. It was on
the Houses of Parliament side, just clear of the terrace.
The bridge was very silent and nearly deserted. In
fact the other end was completely blocked by works

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

and scaffolding, and the passage of vehicles was entirely 
interrupted. Every now and then a distant
flash of lightning illuminated the river over towards
Lambeth and Chelsea. "Thank you!" said Blanche
very softly to the girl, "that will do. Here is your
reward. Run away home and make yourself happy
with it. It is honestly earned. Good night!"</p>

<p>The girl paused, and looked at the money under a
lamp. She had never had so much; and she longed
to run home and acquaint her mother, who must be
back, she thought, by that time. But she did not
like to leave that kind afflicted lady on the bridge
alone. Young as she was, there was something which
alarmed her instincts.</p>

<p>"I can stay, lady, if you like, and take you back,"
she said; "mother don't mind my being out late, and
Betsy Staples will tell her what I'm a doing of."</p>

<p>"I am not going back," said Blanche. "Go home
as fast as you can; I assure you I have no need of
you more. Take the money to your mother. Farewell!"</p>

<p>The child eyed Blanche with a puzzled expression;
but she was too young to appreciate the situation, and
the temptation to get home with the money was great.
So she curtsied in the dark to her blind charge, and
said "Good-bye, kind lady;" and started off at a
rapid walk, which, after she had ineffectually looked
round to see what Blanche was doing once or twice,
soon quickened into a run.</p>

<p>Blanche Aubrey stood in the shadow of the great
filagree-palace of British misrepresentation, as Big

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

Ben dismally told out eleven o'clock. She could
not see</p>

<p class="small">Where the lights quiver<br/>

So far in the river<br/>

From garret to basement;</p>

<p>but she could hear the rush of the broad and bubbling
river, and her full heart and burning head throbbed
to be at rest. The low parapet was so tempting; besides 
she <i>could</i> not live. She had no home left, no
husband, no wish, no world. She was impatient to
be released from trouble and pain; and to free him
from a clog, a burden. She had lived only for him;
and to her he was more than dead. All the principal
scenes of her life crowded through her troubled brain,
and with them some of the most trivial. She thought
of a dress she had not finished, and what would become 
of it, and whether it would be trimmed in anything 
like the fashion she had designed. She thought
of a walk by the river-side when she was a child,
and made chains out of dandelion stalks. She
thought of a white hat which her husband had worn
the first time she ever saw him, and how becoming it
was to his clear, dark complexion. But the predominating 
thought was extreme weariness and disgust
of everything. She had once dreamt that she was
drowned, and it was not painful. On the contrary,
the water bore her along with a delicious murmur,
between fragrant and flowery banks unto a broad expanse 
of ocean, when gradually recollection was lost,
and then she awoke. She longed to dream that
dream over again. And then her lips moved mechanically 
in a simple prayer. Poor creature! on

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

the brink of that fearful crime, she dared to address
the Creator on behalf of another, and that other, him
who had so cruelly wronged her, and who was now to
be to her no more.</p>

<p>Strange to say no resentment mingled that night
with her feelings towards Aubrey. She seemed to
accept everything as a natural result of her calamity.
But while she still stands there, pausing but not irresolute, 
ere the round black guilty world slips globe-like 
from her numb feet, and the last fatal plunge
into eternal gloom is taken, we must beg our readers
to observe a strange, dim figure of a man, at no great
distance from her, and to listen to a very different
soliloquy from a very different style of human being,
before he became conscious of the propinquity of
Blanche Aubrey on the bridge.</p>

<p>This mortal, whoever he was, had approached within
a few paces, coming from the Lambeth side of the
water, just as the little girl disappeared in the dark
on the other side.</p>

<p>"Blest if that 'ere lightnin' ain't put my pipe out,"
he remarked aloud to himself, as he hitched round a
piece of sacking from his shoulders, and banged it a few
times against the stone parapet in order to get rid of
the superfluous wet. "Reyther a damp night this
for a hout-door lodger vith the key of the street.
Vell, I suppose Sir Richard Mayne know'd I was a
goin' to sleep here to night, and so he has 'ad a barrier
put up this werry arternoon at t'other end of the
bridge, that I may not be vakened by the homnibuses. 
Werry kind and thoughtful that of the Chief
Commissioner of the 'Bobbies.' Now, here's a piece

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

o' scaffoldin' werry 'andy. I likes my boards dry, and
as for softness, vy ain't I myself 'downy'? Says I
to myself, 'Cove! don't be a wictim to too much
luxury; you 'ad tripe and inions for supper last
night, and was cut down this mornin' at seven in
a fourpenny lodgin'. Your feller-citizens is werry
considyrate of you, Downy; they know too much
sleep ain't good for your constitooshun. So down
you comes with a run on the floor, and gets turned
hall at vunce into a parlour-boarder. I pities them
folks in feather-beds as is afraid o' lightnin'. Let's
consider my kimmershal transackshuns a little, afore
I retires for the night. I opened and shut seven cabs
this arternoon, and 'eld vun 'oss, and showed vun
gent the vay to the Cross, and collered honly threepence 
ha'penny. If it hadn't been for a good-natured 
cabby, I should have gone vithout a blessed
drain of anythink this blessed night. I'll jest turn it
afore I sees another Bobby. I never could sleep
comfortable in the cage, and as for 'movin' on,'
the Cove ain't hambitious, and he don't feel novays
hanxious to himmortalise himself by diskiverin' the
secret of perpetival motion."</p>

<p>So saying, he laid himself very carefully down on
some covered boarding, supplied by an unfinished
workman's hut.</p>

<p>As he did so, a policeman came by and turned his
bulls'-eye full upon him. The Downy seemed at first
doubtful whether he should counterfeit sleep or not.
But on second thoughts, he opened his eyes, nodded,
and executed an unmistakable wink.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

<p>"Good night!" he said, "I hopes Mrs. Robert is
vell, and the fammerly."</p>

<p>The only reply made by the "officer" whom he
thus addressed, was a shake of the head, as he continued 
on his dreary beat.</p>

<p>"Now that's wot I calls kind," remarked the
Downy to himself, "and desarves a large lump o'
cold meat at the very next airey he comes to." With
that he partly rose up, in order to shift his position
and make himself more "comfortable," before addressing 
himself to sleep. At that very moment a
distant flash of lightning revealed to his astonished
gaze a tall white female form leaning over the parapet
about thirty yards off, on the other side of the bridge.
The Cove was not superstitious&mdash;he was not versed
in the supernatural lore of his country; and therefore 
he did not for a moment think that it was a
ghost that he had seen, however spectral and apparition-like 
the figure of Blanche appeared.</p>

<p>"Holloa!" he said, "another of them poor creeturs
as is tired of a merry life. I dessay it would be a
mercy not to hinterfere vith her, but I can't see it
done and sleep here 'appy. No, I can't see it done;
nor wot's more, I von't, not if I can 'elp it." And
so saying, he stealthily approached Blanche, until he
could hear her passionate murmurs of distress.</p>

"The poor child led me faithfully," she said. "The
money I gave her will make some poor creatures
happy. All the treasures of the world could not
reconcile me to life. How, as I came here, I wished
some vehicle would crush me, and spare me the commission 
of this crime!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

<p>"Ah! there it is!" whispered the Downy, "jest
wot I thought, crime and soocide. I vish I'd got
some of them as caused it here."</p>

<p>"I have not been very wicked," continued Blanche;
"unless it was in loving him so dearly and so well.
I noticed how low this parapet is, as I passed here
blithe and happy, just before my poor sight fled, and
he ceased to love me. Oh, Arthur, Arthur! I forgive 
you!"</p>

<p>"I vish I'd the 'andling of him, that's all,"
muttered the Downy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur!" she resumed, "we shall meet
again. Merciful Spirit of Eternal Love, forgive me,
as I do him! The water rushes beneath. I hear it
plashing. The distant thunder sounds my knell. The
unseen lightnings have scorched my brain, which
all the rain could not cool or moisten. Now, now!
Farewell, world! Arthur! Love! Forgive him,
Heaven!"</p>

<p>"Not if I knows it, young 'ooman!" shouted the
Downy, making a dash at her. But he was a
moment too late. She had thrown herself over the
parapet.</p>

<p>She was gone! So desperate was the bound he
had made to reach her, that he narrowly escaped
pitching headforemost over the parapet, and, as it
was, he fell forward sprawling upon it; for the next
half second grasping the wet stone with his hands
and arms to save himself. In a moment he recovered
his balance, and with a hoarse shout for help, he
dashed round to the steps of the bridge, which
fortunately were not very far.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

"Help! A woman over the bridge!" he shouted
once again, ere he flung his coat off and plunged into
the stream. As we have said, he was a strong and
bold swimmer, accustomed to emergencies such as the
present one; and well for him was it that he was so,
besides being gifted with an eye keen as that of hawk
or hound. The tide bore Blanche up awhile; and her
white dress rendered her floating form visible to the
Downy's keen and practised sight. But it was long
before he reached her, and then came the terrible
struggle to get back. Fortunately, there were several
floating rafts and barges moored along the terrace-side, 
and two or three steamers with chains hung
round. Meanwhile, a boatman, who expected an
early fare, a gentleman in training whom he rowed
down to Chelsea to get into his outrigger every morning, 
and who had accordingly moored his boat somewhere 
near the bridge, had got alarmed about its
safety at high-water, and had come down to look
after it just then. He speedily got in and rowed towards 
the struggling pair, amid the acclamations of
the three or four persons already congregated on the
bridge.</p>

<p>"He's got 'em safe enough," cried one of them.
"I see 'em by the lightning, quite plain. Down there,
all of you, to the right by the steps."</p>

<p>It had already recommenced raining heavily, which
accounted for so few being on the bridge, where the
sole person remaining near the scene of the catastrophe 
was a benighted orange-girl, who looked with
less excitement and eagerness than might have been
expected, over the parapet, at that portion of what

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

was going on beneath, which the darkness allowed to
be seen. As she looked, she rested on the parapet
her basket of swelled oranges, which had remained
unsold, possibly on account of the rainy and
tempestuous day. While thus employed, a party of
four persons, two male, and two female, approached
her. They had come from the Surrey side of the
water, but were fashionably dressed.</p>

<p>"Only think," said one of the party to another, a
lady, as they approached the orange-girl. "Only
think of there being no cab to be got, and such a
night, too. It's enough to give one bwonchitis, or
diptheywia."</p>

<p>"And such a low part of the town to pass
through!" said the lady. "I never was so frightened.
And there's Miss Dareall, as usual, making fun of it
all. What spirits and courage that girl has!"</p>

<p>"Yaas," replied Mr. Swellingham, for that was
the worthy's name; "she goes through life like a
steeple-chase. I own I can't keep up with her."</p>

<p>Here, with the prevailing idea which besets street
vendors, that every one must be in want under all or
any circumstances of the article which they may
happen to sell, the orange-girl slung round her basket,
and addressed them with the usual drawl.</p>

<p>"Any oranges, fine St. Mikils, two a penny, sir:
won't you buy any, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I say," quoth Mr. Swellingham, "what's the
wow? I heard a shout as if some one was being
dwowned."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, young woman?" said the
elder of the two ladies to the girl.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

<p>"It's a girl they're a trying to get out of the water,"
replied that individual. "Do buy some oranges;
they're only two a penny."</p>

<p>"How howwid!" cried Swellingham; "but we
weally can't help her, 'pon honour. Can we?"</p>

<p>"Where? Where is the poor creature?" cried
the younger lady, whom we may as well inform
our readers at once was no other than Miss Kate
Dareall, on her way home from the Surrey Theatre.
The orange-girl pointed with her finger towards the
steps.</p>

<p>"There, by this time, if they've got her. But I
don't think she'd a chance; let alone the likelihood of
her having struck agen somethink in the fall."</p>

<p>Miss Dareall did not wait for her to finish, but ran
on towards the steps, followed closely by Sir Harry
Luckless, the fourth of the party.</p>

<p>"Do, kind lady, buy some oranges, they're fourteen
for sixpence. Do ma'am! I haven't sold one to-day," 
continued the persevering huckster, addressing
the remaining lady.</p>

<p>"Go away, creature, you'll soil my dress!" cried
Miss Ada Montmorency, of the Hesperides corps de
ballet, whose mother had been, up to within the previous 
eight years, a priestess of the soi-disant "real
St. Michael," herself.</p>

<p>"A curse on you with your finery!" cried the
girl, who was really a good-looking specimen of her
class. "My oranges are cleaner than your hands,
ay, or heart either, I'll warrant. It's the likes of
you that makes poor creaturs drown theirselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Swellingham raised his attenuated umbrella.

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

Let us do him justice, it was not to strike; for he
was a good-hearted fellow enough; but the girl
interpreted the movement differently.</p>

<p>"You hit me?" she cried, "you brute; I'll scratch
your eyes out."</p>

<p>Mr. Swellingham prudently declined the combat;
and hurried on with his fair convoy as quickly as he
could, pursued by a volley of abuse from the girl who
followed close on their steps.</p>

<p>"Police! police!" cried the Montmorency.</p>

<p>"Cab! cab!" shouted Swellingham. "Wherever
can Sir Harry and that madcap girl have got to?"</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," said the ballerina, "they have
not waited for us, or perhaps they have secured a
cab at the stand by the House of Commons there,
and are waiting for us. Do pray let us hasten
on."</p>

<p>And the twain did accordingly hasten on, passing
the steps down which Miss Dareall, followed by Sir
Harry, had run; the latter pair just arriving when
the boatman, assisted by the four or five persons who
had found their way thither, was in the act of lifting
the form of the insensible Blanche out of his skiff,
while the dripping Downy stood shaking himself on
the stair like a lean and famished Newfoundland dog,
whose wet coat clinging close to his ribs, shows the
real attenuation of his shape.</p>

<p>"Is she saved?" cried the actress. "Oh! only
tell me that the poor creature breathes." And she
shuddered as the leaden-hued water swirled through
the dusky piles, and came close, with a lapping, eager
sound, to her feet, as she stood gazing at the now

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

ascending group, while they bore their inanimate
burden to the first platform of the stairs.</p>

<p>"She's safe enough to come round," answered the
Downy, who was too exhausted to assist them as yet;
"that is," he added, "if she ain't took pison as well,
as vun on 'em did vunce as I saved from drowndin'
afore."</p>

<p>"Believe me, my brave fellow," said Sir Harry,
"you shall be handsomely rewarded for this."</p>

<p>"So I'm allers told," replied the Downy, drily; if
such a term could possibly be applied to him at that
moment. "But, mind yer, I don't look for more
than a kivarten of gin, and may be a trifle for baccy.
Somehow I generally saves them as has no money
for theirselves, and vot's more, don't thank no vun
for a doin' of it. But the Downy Cove ain't noways
pertikler to a trifle. As for the duckin', I've been
vet enough these four hours, and this is honly goin'
into it a little in the wholesale line, arter takin' of it
in instalments. As to the Royal Humane Society's
gold medal, I may be perwailed upon to accept that
ven I gets it, along with the freedom of the City of
London. Meanwhile, I ain't a goin' to ax the Lord
Mayor to dinner to meet the Prince of Wales, until
I gets my new dinin'-room furnitur French polished,
and all the faramerly plate back from Hadmiral
Poppem, my wenerable and respected huncle."</p>

<p>During this speech, the others had been busy in
chafing the hands of Blanche, and endeavouring to
restore animation to her insensible frame. Among
these Kate Dareall was the most active and sensible
in her proceedings. "Look, Harry!" she cried,

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

"she breathes! she moves! Never mind her wet
cloak. Leave it for one of these poor creatures. I
will see that she has all that she wants. She looks
like a lady. But the story is plain enough. There
is not a ring or ornament about her. Get a cab
handy, some one. Take off your great-coat, Harry.
Thank you, that will do. I will reward all handsomely. 
Stop! I will do it now. Here, my good
man," she said to the boatman, "take this five-pound
note, you deserve it. And here is a sovereign a piece
for the rest."</p>

<p>One of the party quickly ran up for the cab.</p>

<p>"Look, Harry," continued Miss Dareall, "how
beautiful she is!" And she pointed to the alabaster
face that lay pillowed on her knee, while the long
dark tresses of the rescued sufferer swept the dank
and dripping stairs. "Help me to wring her long
hair," she continued.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" cried Sir Harry, turning as
pale as Blanche herself. "What do I see?" And
he staggered back, and possibly might have fallen
into the water, had it not been for the ever-ready
Downey, who had finished his brief toilet, and already
performed a little double-shuffle on the stairs, to
restore the circulation of the vital fluid within.</p>

<p>"Hold hup, guvernor," he shouted, "hunless
you're good for a swim. Blest if I could save any
more of yer this turn; no, not if you was to hoffer
to set me up in the public line, and give me the
deckerashun of the Bath."</p>

<p>Sir Harry stared about him wildly; and grasping
Miss Dareall by the arm, hoarsely muttered something 

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

in her ear, which caused that young lady to let
Blanche's head fall from her knee upon the sharp
edge of the granite stair.</p>

<p>"It is Mrs. Aubrey!" were his words. "God in
heaven! What can have happened. What has
done this?"</p>

<p>The actress uttered a single exclamation of surprise; 
and then instantly regaining her self-possession, 
"Hush, hush! Calm yourself, Harry!" she
whispered. "Not a word! not a word!"</p>

<p>At that instant the man who had run for the cab
returned to say that one awaited them above.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the success of Miss Dareall's
friendly design, the few persons present, besides the
boatman, and the Downy, and themselves, were all
of the humblest class of persons, and none had the
desire to busy themselves more than was needed, or,
now that they were recompensed so generously, to
remain upon the scene at all.</p>

<p>"Here you brave man," said Kitty, addressing
the Downy, "where do you live? Is it anywhere
near here?"</p>

<p>"Live?" replied that individual; "uncommon
handy, to be sure. Vestminster Bridge scaffoldin'
is vere I hangs out at present. Wery harrystocratic
neighbourhood, spacious premises, and well wentilated 
too. It's no use writin'. There ain't no number
on the door at present."</p>

<p>"I see," said Miss Dareall; "I might have known,
had I thought a moment. Then you can come
with us."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

<p>The Downy nodded his acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Can you help me to bear her up these stairs?
There! there! gently&mdash;that's right; run and open
the cab-door ready for us, will you, Harry, if you're
not utterly dumbfounded? Not to be wondered at, if
he is," she said, as Sir Harry mechanically sprung
forward to obey her. "There, there&mdash;so, gently&mdash;gently," 
and then the party quickly ascended the
stairs. Under the guidance of the actress, Blanche
was safely placed inside, having once or twice opened
her blind eyes with a dreary, languid stare; and Sir
Harry and Miss Dareall supported her between them,
while the Downy was instructed to mount the box,
and stop at a public-house at a sufficient distance
from the scene; for the twofold purpose of avoiding
the mention of any address, and of getting some
restorative both for Blanche and her preserver, a
proposition to which the latter had probably as little
objection as if he had been listening to a two hours'
sermon on temperance on the hottest Sunday in the
State of Maine.</p>

<p>The cab had just turned the corner, and the four
bystanders were wending their way over the bridge
to the nearest public on their side of the water, near
"Hashley's The&aacute;yter," as they termed that place,
long sacred to equestrian delight, when the poor
orange-girl came shuffling back, after her vain
pursuit of Swellingham and the Montmorency, to
learn what had come of the drowned woman; for
such she had decided she must be. At the top of
the steps she saw something lying. It was Blanche's

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

cloak, which Sir Harry had taken possession of, and
let fall in his agitation, as he well might.</p>

<p>She stooped and picked it up, and then laying her
tray on the ground, commenced folding it up. "Poor
creetur," she said to herself. "It ain't no more use
to her, whoever she was."</p>

<p>"Holloa!" cried the active and intelligent officer,
who had been on a little visit in his turn to a public,
to get his accustomed half pint with a drop of something 
warm. "What are you doing of there?" and
he snatched the mantle roughly from her hands.
"Who have you been a robbin' of, eh?"</p>

<p>"There's a woman been and drownded herself,"
said the girl. "Indeed, sir, I didn't steal it. I
picked it up just here."</p>

<p>"Picked it up, did yer?" shouted the "active
and intelligent officer." "A likely tale! A woman
drownding is there? Here! help! fire! murder!
theives! Here!" and he sprung his rattle, which
speedily brought a brace of confreres to his side, besides 
a little mob of the unwashed, or rather, to speak
more correctly, the washed, as it happened that
stormy afternoon and night.</p>

<p>"Here, Bill! she says there's a woman drownding
somewheres. I knows her well enough. She's been
a begging here all the week."</p>

<p>And with that he dealt a kick to her basket, which
sent her oranges rolling into the mud of the street,
and down the bridge-stairs, where they were speedily
chased by sundry of the pauper population of our
merry island home.</p>

<p>"A drownded woman, eh? Come along to the

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

station, my beauty, and I'll give you a night's lodging
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray, sir, let me go!" shrieked the girl.</p>

<p>"What! you <i>won't</i> come, won't yer? then I'll
make yer," was the answer. "What! prigging a
drownded woman's clothes by your own confession,
which is wanted for hevidence of felony? I'll lock
yer up, that's what I will. Here, Bill, lend a hand!"</p>

<p>In vain did the luckless orange-girl fight and
struggle. With torn hair and dress, and shoulders
pinched black and blue by the fierce grasp of three
stout policemen, and, we regret to say, not without a
severe blow or two on her bare head administered by
a zealous young Irishman recently affiliated to the
Force, she was borne off, with cries and resistance
growing fainter and fainter, until she was finally
flung, wet, muddy, bleeding, and nearly senseless, in
the cold and reeking cell, where half a dozen "unfortunates," 
whose chief crime was abject poverty, and
homeless want, were already incarcerated before her,
awaiting the solemn farce of beadledom in the morning, 
when the comfortable Rhadamanthus of the day
should have breakfasted, and be ready to furnish the
newest legal paraphrase of the story of Dives and
Lazarus to the full satisfaction of a Christian land.</p>

<p>Reader! Is this sketch exaggerated? No, it is
far below the average cruelty of such nightly events.
The victim should have had a sickly baby in her
arms, and three more vainly awaiting her return
home to their squalid den in helpless hunger and
dirty tears. She should not even have suggested the
appropriation of anything not her own, but have had

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

nothing save the rags on herself and child, and a
copper coin in her clammy clutch dropped into her
lap by some passing stranger unsolicited even by an
imploring look. Then the picture would have been
more perfect, we own; and the wisdom and mercy of
the Court might have manifested itself either by
giving her "a month," or discharging her, according 
to the temper and digestion of the "worthy
magistrate," or the zeal of the "active and intelligent 
officers," who had marked her as their own.</p>

<p>Again the ponderous bridge was cleared of the
actors in the second little sensation scene which had
enlivened its monotony that night. But the news had
somehow spread that a woman had jumped over, or
been pushed into the water, and a British crowd
quickly assembled, as only a British crowd can.</p>

<p>"There she is!" cried one. "I see her floating
ever so far up. She's 'arf way to Vauxhall by
now. I tell you I see her plain, just opposite that
chimbly."</p>

<p>The excitement became great; and so remarkable
were some of its consequences, that various trifles
were magnetically affected by it, including a snuff-box,
three pocket-handkerchiefs, and a purse containing
one pound ten shillings, so as to cause them to vacate
their owners' pockets in a most remarkable way, and
be transferred to those of two or three of the crowd
apparently most interested in the fate of the drowning
person "half way to Vauxhall." And not a policeman 
was in sight! What is that chorus borne along
by the wind? "We won't go home till morning
till daylight doth appear." Presently, a dozen young

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

fellows came along, arm-in-arm and in line, singing,
shouting, and yelling at the top of their discordant
voices; they bonnetted, abused, and insulted every
one, especially females, in their path. They saw a
garotted man lying insensible in the street, but
as one of the party suggested that he was "drunk,
&mdash;&mdash; drunk, by &mdash;&mdash;!" and appeared quite capable
of forming a correct judgment, no one attempted to
ascertain its correctness. Presently Big Ben boomed
forth the midnight hour, and the bridge again became 
silent, and the river rushed back towards ocean,
and the shadowy panorama twinkled with innumerable 
lights, and the stars shone out in the sky cleared
from the last driving storm-cloud, and mingled with
the earthly gleams reflected in the broad bosom of
the river, as the true mingles with the false.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE FEELINGS OF THE FIRM.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">He shall be as benevolent as a lawyer who sits nursing his leg and
listening to the tales of one whom his own client oppresses. You shall
touch his feelings as readily as a baby fumbling a cocoa-nut extracts
thence the milk of sustenance. Your freedom shall be like that of a

You shall hardly stir the devil within him to malice, so surely

<p>IT was Monday morning in Webb's Fields, and the
Law might be said to be generally refreshed and renovated 
by its varied observance of the Sabbath-day.
Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens sat, three years older
in legal practice and worldly experience, in their
chambers in Spider-court. The former was a little
more troubled with dyspepsia; the latter suffered
from a slightly increased periodical attack of king's
evil, a weak chest, and corns. His bootmaker had
philanthropically forgotten to make the necessary
arrangement for them on his last, when furnishing
him with his latest supply of inevitable patent
leathers. After all, there is a great unseen compensating 
power ever at work in human affairs. A
ruined litigant had just left their office in perfect
health. The ways of Providence none can dare to

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

arraign, who believes in another world; but even
here below the golden cup of prosperity does not
always overbrim with sweetness; the iron ladle of
poverty sometimes assuages a wholesome and honest
thirst. Mr. Grinderby's eldest son could scarcely be
termed his hope, and occasioned him a great deal of
disquietude. He did not accommodate himself to
his father's views and ways of life; a circumstance
which did not emanate from an ungrateful disposition 
or a barren heart. Mr. Cousens had bestowed
his affections, such as they were, upon a worthless
and disreputable woman, whom he had cleverly
tempted, as he thought, from her allegiance to his
own chief associate and "friend," whereas she cared
for neither, and had long since bestowed her liking
upon a grocer's apprentice in Tottenham Court-road,
unknown to both. The friend had displayed a great
deal of very inconvenient jealousy; and the knowing
Phil had merely been made use of at a moment,
when she could no longer hope to divert suspicion
from her misdeeds, and avoid being thrown upon her
own resources and the doubtful chivalry of the gay
young dispenser of figs. Moreover, delightful to
relate, the astute Mr. Cousens was actually so far
infatuated by this Casino-frequenting Dalilah of
thirty, that he was on the point of entering secretly
into the holy bonds of matrimony with her. Yes,
she was on the point of making an honest man of
him at last. All this may have been exciting as it
was strange; but it did not tend to happiness. Phil
laughed as usual, "but not merry." Moreover, the
circumstances under which the &eacute;claircissement took

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

place between Mr. Cousens and his injured friend
were not of a proud and gratifying character. The
friend was a West-end client of the firm, and up to
a certain period Mr. Cousens had been an upright
counsellor, so far as to lose no occasion to influence
his "fidus Achates" against an extravagant expenditure 
on the lady in question. All at once, his tone
changed, and as he was general referee and arbitrator 
of their frequent quarrels, Orestes took advantage 
of the situation to urge Pylades, to the great
surprise of the latter, to bestow a round sum of
money down upon the lady, and act generously in
the matter. Unfortunately, Orestes' reasons for
giving this advice were hardly so plausible as they
ought to have been, in order to carry conviction to
the bosom of Pylades.</p>

<p>"If I were you, old fellow," said the former, "I'd
settle it one way or another. She's so fond of you,
you see, that she can't bear you to show a want of
confidence in her. 'Let him only treat me as a
woman ought to be treated,' she said to me last Wednesday, 
'and he'll soon see whether I care for him or
not.' And it's worth trying, in my opinion," added
Phil, "with a woman like that. She has such a
high spirit, you see."</p>

<p>"True," returned Pylades, who had especial reason
to know it, dating no further back than that morning;
"and what would you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>"Give her one thousand pounds down and the
furniture of the house in the Grove," replied Phil,
cheerily and decisively. "That's what I should
do. Look here, old fellow! you can't expect that

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

woman's affections, without showing confidence in
her. She's full of pride, and she said to me, 'Let
him do something for me, and then he'll see what I
am.' Of course it's no business of mine; but since
you ask my advice," said Phil (which the other had
not done), "I give it, that's all." And the friendly
man of law balanced himself on his chair between
the desk and wall, and threw up a small ruler a little
way, which he caught, as if he were practising honest
sleight of hand.</p>

<p>"And suppose, if I did, she was to bolt?" inquired
the other.</p>

<p>"Let her!" magnanimously returned Mr. Cousens.
"Let her, I say. And if you're the man I take you
to be, you wouldn't regret the outlay, that's all."</p>

<p>"Hem!" said the other, "it's all very well to talk;
but a man don't like to be done."</p>

"It's my opinion," quoth Phil, still throwing up
his ruler, and speaking very slowly, as if the occupation 
were of much more moment than the advice,
"that she'll no more bolt from you, old fellow, than&mdash;than&mdash;this 
ruler." At this moment he nearly
overbalanced himself, and the ruler came down with
some violence on the floor.</p>

<p>"Then you really advise me?" said the other.</p>

<p>"I advise&mdash;nothing!" said Phil, recommencing to
"toss the caber," as he facetiously called it. "I
certainly believe the woman loves you" (here he narrowly 
escaped being hit on the head); "and she
thinks you don't really care for her. Women are
strange beings," added Phil. "Look at Joan of Arc,
and Mary Queen of Scots, and the Maid of Saragossa. 

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

By-the-bye, did you ever see such a likeness
as there is between a certain party and that print?"</p>

<p>"Well, now you say so," replied Pylades, rather
flattered by the idea, "I rather think there is. I
wonder I never noticed it before. The fact is, Phil,
I don't mind telling you, that Mabel has grown very
queer-tempered of late, and if I thought any little
thing I could do would do any good, you see, why I
wouldn't much mind risking a little, eh?"</p>

<p>"You know best," replied Phil; "but perhaps
you'd better wait a month or two, and see about it."</p>

<p>"And the Derby so near?" said Pylades, reflectingly; 
"and Cremorne just going to open?"</p>

<p>What these events had to do with the matter, probably 
the speaker could best explain himself; but
Mr. Cousens understood him for all that.</p>

<p>The fish had swallowed the bait, and the troller
could very well afford to slacken his line now. So he
merely remarked that he was a "dear old fellow,"
knew his own affairs best, and that all he had to say
was, that he, Orestes, should not be in a hurry, if he
were Pylades, "you know." The consequence of all
this was that Mr. Cousens received implicit instructions 
immediately to prepare the papers settling the
one thousand pounds, and bestowing the furniture of
No. 64, Lorrimore Villas, upon this faithless Circe,
who wore a gipsy hat in the rural vicinity of the
Haymarket.</p>

<p>But it chanced that Pylades, who made over the
furniture the very next day, and who was to complete
the gift of the thousand pounds, which necessitated
a transfer of stock, on the following Monday, received

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

information of such a startling character on the
Saturday following his interview with Orestes, that
he called at that worthy's chambers on Sunday, and
put the matter to him in an ingenious and most
inconvenient form. He wanted, he said, to ask his
friend Phil's advice on behalf of another friend, who
was suffering a shameful wrong at the hands of a
man whom he trusted, and who was bound to him by
every tie of gratitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens was all attention. "You know, old
fellow, I'll give you or any friend of yours the best
advice I can," he said.</p>

<p>The fact was he scented a new client.</p>

<p>"It's a very delicate affair," said the other; "because 
it won't bear publicity, you see. But what
should you think of a fellow who behaved as follows?"
He then gave a sketch of his own position and
Cousens's advice, without naming amounts, names,
or particulars. "And all the while," he said, "this
lying, pettifogging rascal, this fair-spoken, treacherous
scoundrel, was intriguing with the wretched woman
himself. Now, would you advise my friend," he
continued, "to kick and horsewhip him, as he deserves, 
and thereby to publish his own folly and
absurdity, as well as the whole affair; or to treat him
with silent abhorrence and contempt, and never
speak to him, or have anything to do with him
again?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens tried to laugh, but the effort was
hysterical, and produced only a slight rattling in his
throat.</p>

<p>"What do you advise?" said the other, staring

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

him in the face, not in the eyes; for his own were
fixed on the pattern in the carpet; and the ghastly hues
of a chameleon altogether in a bad and unhealthy
way, were chasing each other over his mottled face,
ordinarily rather highly coloured with a sort of scrofulous 
flush.</p>

<p>"All's fair in love, you know," he began at
length.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the other, "and in friendship too.
No, no! my kind, disinterested, considerate friend,
it is a lie, a foul lie, to say that all is fair in love.
It is the pretext of the seducer and swindler in one&mdash;the 
basest insult he can offer to the deity whose very
mention his lying lips profane." The poor fellow
had actually become eloquent in his wrongs. "It is
a lie, I tell you, at the best, friend Cousens, and you
know it. There is nothing fair in love but truth,
and no love without it." He was thinking of all the
falsehoods which had imposed upon his own foolish
passion. "And at the worst," he shouted, "at the
worst, in such a case as this, there is no dock bad
enough in which to place a man who dares to offer
such plea; no punishment sufficiently degrading; no
criminal of the ordinary stamp, thief, forger, murderer 
though he be, bad enough to be consigned to
the same cell&mdash;for he has stolen, forged, and murdered 
the only attributes which make us better than
beasts that prey on each other, better than the
skunk, or the rat, the crawling, noisome reptiles of
the sewer. Excuse my heat," he said, "my dear
friend Phil, but don't you agree with me? I can't
think of it with patience; and whatever you say out

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

of friendship to keep me cool and calm, I know you
must think as I do. Why, you look quite agitated
and moved yourself. No! I can't stop and smoke
to-day, dear old boy!" (Mr. Cousens had made an
abortive effort to put a cigar in his own mouth.) "I
need not have asked your advice. I knew you would
feel indignant; but don't be anxious about my friend.
I shall tell him to cut the blackguard, that is all,
never to speak to him, nor to shake hands with him"
(and here he went through the process of wiping
his hand with his handkerchief) "again; to shut
the door on him, as I am going to shut this, and
leave him to his own thoughts and conscience, eh?
Good-bye, my dear friend. Thank you, thank
you! Good-bye!" And Pylades left Orestes looking
not only as if a bomb-shell had exploded at his feet,
but as if he should like one to explode at that
moment.</p>

<p>Gradually his injured feelings took the form of
wrath. "The cursed idiot!" he said to himself; "as
if one could help it; as if any one could have loved
<i>him</i>." And here Mr. Cousens rose, and adjusted his
shirt-collar in the glass over his chimney-piece. His
eye thence fell on his Sunday pair of patent boots.
"It's lucky," he muttered to himself, "that the fool
hadn't the pluck to speak out what he meant, or I
might have had to kick him down-stairs." As there
was no one present to hear him, this little piece of
brag presented a curious psychological phenomenon.
The taste of the day is, as we are informed by some
publishers, minute mental analysis. The novel-reading 
public delight in the minutest dissection of

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

a country curate's heart, under such circumstances as
guilty love for his married cousin, or they are interested 
in the motives of the Bishop of Boreham's
lady, when she invited Mr. Squabchick, the radical
independent preacher, to her most select conversazione. 
The warmest fancies of an unhealthy girl's
mind articulately developing themselves are at a premium, 
providing that the said heroine is sufficiently
plain; and isolated&mdash;say in a Cornwall vicarage. It
might, therefore, be worth our while to dissect and
expose Mr. Cousens's inmost thoughts and metaphysical 
condition. He had no more idea of kicking the
stalwart Graham, for such was his "friend's" name,
than of engaging in single combat with Mace. Why,
then, did he talk about kicking him to himself?
Of course men like to deceive themselves, and be
deceived sometimes, against the convictions of their
own reason; but why indulge in such tremendous
and groundless bounce as this, when the other mental
half of Mr. Cousens&mdash;and considerably the bigger
half&mdash;was only congratulating that gentleman on the
turn which his friend's resentment had taken? "After
all it might have been worse," thought that portion
of the reasoning Mr. Cousens. It is a contradiction
which we are unable to explain. He deemed himself
lucky to have escaped personal chastisement at the
hands or feet of Graham, and yet talked to himself
aloud about the necessity which might have arisen of
kicking him. Perhaps he addressed this deceitful
soliloquy to his boots.</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens next proceeded to consider matters
generally in relation to the offended client of the firm.

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

"I must tell Grinderby something or other to account
for his leaving us, which won't be difficult, as his affairs
are in my hands. I must put him up to retouching
his last bill of costs, as we shall get no more out of
him. Confound him! How did he find it all out?
Let's see, she's got the furniture, and to-morrow would
have had the 'thou.' besides. Well, it can't be
helped. I must see her this evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens did call at No. 64, Lorrimore Villas,
that evening, and had a stormy interview with its fair
occupant, who accused him of ruining her prospects.
Many savage and bitter things passed; and finally the
astute, worldly Mr. Cousens, under the influence of
sundry vinous and spirituous potations, actually promised 
marriage to the vulgar and violent Circe, who
hated and despised him in her heart. But she had
long nourished the ambition of being Mrs. Cousens,
and her mingled reproaches and allurements were
eminently successful on the night in question. The
fact is that Mr. Cousens had long been immersed in
the "wretchlessness of unclean living, which is no less
perilous than desperation." Not only does such a
man's taste become more vitiated by indulgence; but
even his worldly intelligence deserts him at his utmost
need. The way of a man stricken by the fascinations
of a depraved woman, is as wonderful and incomprehensible 
as anything that Solomon declared his inability 
to solve. Mr. Cousens knew that he was about
to do a foolish, if not a fatal thing: moreover, he was
thoroughly ashamed of it; but still he had no power
to resist. He had at first triumphed in his successful 
baseness, and then in turn it swallowed him up.

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

He had entered the serpent's haunt, in a pleasant
and jaunty manner, and was encircled in the pestiferous 
folds of the constrictor, while rejoicing in his
criminal success.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived that with this weight of
consciousness on his mind, and the recollection of the
biting sarcasms of Graham festering in his breast,
Mr. Cousens, in spite of his double stimulant of pale
ale, like the Irishman in Lover's charming song, was
"not himself at all," on the Monday morning to
which we have drawn our readers' attention in the
beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>To use his own expression, "Phil was far from
being alive." The subject which occupied the two
members of the firm was the distressing and ruinous
state of Mr. Aubrey's affairs, and the terrible catastrophe 
which had occurred to his wife. No one had
seen Blanche since. It was openly stated and noised
abroad that Mrs. Aubrey had committed suicide.
There was the police case of the orange-girl and the
wet cloak found in her possession, which she said had
belonged to a "drownded" person, and it was recognised 
by the frantic Susan as having been worn by
her mistress. Strange to say, Mr. Cousens had not
heard a word of it, previous to his arrival at the office
that day. He had heard, "Awful suicide of a lady!"
cried in the streets. He had seen, "Distressing
suicide!" on the newspaper placards; but he had not
looked at any paper that morning, nor made any inquiry 
as to the person to whom these announcements
referred. To say that even he was not shocked, in
the common acceptation of the term, when Mr. Grinderby 

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

imparted the intelligence of Mrs. Aubrey's supposed 
dreadful end, would be almost condemnatory
even of his shallow feelings and heartless disposition;
but he was too full of his own affairs and troubles to
dwell upon it, after a few moments devoted to astonishment, 
except so far as it might be regarded in a
business point of view. Again, other feelings supervened. 
Mr. Cousens had always hated Mrs. Aubrey.
He knew that she fully understood him and disliked
him. All this he remembered. The coldness and
formality of her tones, her frigid and condescending
politeness, and the early check she had given to the
genteel freedom of his address&mdash;all this occurred to
him: until ere long he began to regard her tragical
end with a sort of savage complacency and approval.
Mingled with this was the rancour he had lately
felt towards Aubrey, who had been anything but
friendly or familiar with him of late. As for
Grinderby, he was anything but chagrined at the
occurrence. It was a deadly social blow to Aubrey,
and consequently suited his book well. The ruined
client was to him as a stranded vessel to a wrecker.
Not a plank must be left to hold together; and if the
doomed ship could be branded as a pirate or slaver&mdash;why, 
so much the better. Everything that tended
to sink Aubrey in the estimation of the world would
diminish sympathy and inquiry as to how the firm
had assisted in and profited by his ruin. The suicide
of blind Mrs. Aubrey, occasioned by her husband's
disreputable escapades, was a finishing stroke to
that client's reputation, beyond anything which Mr.
Grinderby could possibly have anticipated. But he

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

did not think it necessary to state his real sentiments 
to Mr. Cousens, any more than that gentleman
felt inclined to reveal his secret notions unreservedly
to him.</p>

<p>They had accordingly together duly deplored the
calamity which the senior partner had narrated to
the junior. We shall pass over all that portion of
their conversation, before they came to the consideration 
of the event in a business point of view.</p>

<p>"As you say," observed Mr. Grinderby, after the
preliminary tribute to decency had been paid, and
there had been a considerable pause, "as you say, a
most distressing event; but the firm must not be
prejudiced by your feelings, Mr. Cousens."</p>

<p>It is due to that professional gentleman's reputation
to mention that Mr. Cousens had not rendered this
observation necessary by exhibiting any very alarming 
degree of emotion.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Aubrey was no friend of mine," replied
Cousens; "and as for the firm, she never evinced any
respect or partiality for it whatsoever. Quite the
contrary; but we cannot help our feelings, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Cousens," said Grinderby, with a hideous
contortion, "think of the frightful wickedness of the
act!" And he rose and walked up and down, as if
the idea overpowered him. "As for our client, Mr.
Aubrey, quite independently of this, he is a ruined
man, sir, a ruined man.</p>

<p>"It is a bad job for him," continued the senior
partner, after a pause, "that he is so tied up by the
clauses of anticipation in his father's will; he can't
raise a penny on the estate."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

<p>We will continue the conversation that ensued
between the pair in the first person, so that it may
lose nothing by the interpolations which would
otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>GRINDERBY. The firm, Mr. Cousens, the firm must
not suffer by this break up. (And he rubbed his
hands, as if in anticipation of the salvage.)</p>

<p>COUSENS. Bingley's Wharf sold badly enough.</p>

<p>GRIN. Had our client waited a month longer than
he did, it would have realised fifty thousand pounds
at least.</p>

<p>COUS. Yes, the railway came right through the
warehouses. And you knew it for at least six months
before.</p>

<p>GRIN. Hush! It suited the firm to place no impediment 
in the way of the sale. I am sure we did
not recommend so imprudent and hasty a step. At
least, I can speak for myself; and I hope, I may say I
sincerely trust, that you did not. No! I thought
not. None can impeach the conduct of the firm. I
burnt Mr. Pettingall's letter informing us of the fact.
That letter was marked "private." I really do not
consider that we were bound, even in equity, to take
twenty-eight thousand pounds out of the railway
directors' pockets, to put them into those of our client.
It would have been a public robbery, sir. As I said,
I burnt that letter. Never keep such things by you,
Mr. Cousens. There is no saying when they may
turn up. Your health has been far from satisfactory,
lately. I hope you don't keep anything that might
compromise the firm. I wish you were a trifle, just
a trifle, more cautious. I admit your good qualities&mdash;excellent 

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

<i>touter</i> for West-end business, and as unblushing 
as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>COUS. Yourself.</p>

<p>GRIN. The devil! Don't interrupt me, pray. Well,
I was going to say, that by the default of his father's
confidential managing clerk and cashier, Manvers, at
present, I believe I may say, a distinguished citizen
of the United States, our client lost at least ten thousand 
pounds to commence with.</p>

<p>COUS. Have you heard then from Manvers lately?</p>

<p>GRIN. Do, pray, hear me out. You are so very
impetuous, Mr. Cousens. I was about to observe that
the firm did its duty there. I said to our client:
"Prosecute, sir, prosecute. You owe it to Society.
It is true that you have known him since you were a
child, and were taught to venerate him, when he
dispensed the weekly trifle which your late lamented
father allowed you, his only son, in order to teach
economy and habits of business. It is true," added
I, "that you find it difficult to divest your mind of
a sort of traditional reverence for those colossal piles
of figures, which were his boast in your father's
counting-house, and to which he, this defaulting
clerk, used to point so complacently, telling you that
he could not endure to be a halfpenny wrong in his
balances, and that he sat up all night upon one occasion 
in order to find out and rectify a mistake of that
very trifling amount."</p>

<p>COUS. Yes, yes. They were minute calculations to
defraud, extending over a period of years.</p>

<p>GRIN. A period of five years only, Mr. Cousens; if
I remember aright. Well, the discovery of the embezzlement 

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

was remarkable enough. His impunity had
made Manvers reckless. A natural disposition of the
criminal mind! Let's see. It was just about the
time that you picked your client up, nailed the business, 
ha, ha! of the "Aubrey Estates, entailed," in
your very neatest slap-dash manner. I am content
to work here in gaiters; you are the roving partner in
patent leather boots. I toiled and moiled; while you
went yachting with our rich client in the Mediterranean. 
I think you were consumptive about that
time. I do hope it is not now the case. You don't
take sufficient care of yourself, indeed you don't. Well,
you were an interesting invalid then&mdash;chest weak,
eh? How agreeable you must have made yourself!
You nursed him in his illness, rode his horses, drank
his wine, borrowed his money, without any inconvenient 
documents passing between "gentlemen and
friends," called his yacht yours, on shore, when he
was not present, spouted his poetry&mdash;wonderful self-sacrifice 
that&mdash;and made love to his mistresses, who
made love to you in return, in order to keep in with
the second self, ha! ha! the lawyer and the man of
the world.</p>

<p>COUS. Really, Mr. Grinderby, this is a most extraordinary 
display of facetiousness, which I am at a
loss to appreciate or comprehend. When you have
done&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>GRIN. The subject is so tempting, Mr. Cousens,
that I have lost the thread of my narrative, got back
into the recitals, as it were. Ha, ha! I was saying&mdash;what 
was I saying?&mdash;Ah! that I urged our client
to prosecute Manvers. It was all of no use. Our

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

client nobly permitted Manvers to emigrate to America; 
where, but for an unfortunate restriction in the
laws of that enlightened country, he might yet become 
President of the United States, and receive an
autograph letter from the Queen, without the little
formalities he was accustomed to here, such as,
"Victoria, by the grace of God, greeting," &amp;c. Do
you take? It suited the firm very well that Manvers
escaped the penalties of the British law, and found a
wider scope and area for the exercise of too great
daring for this old-fashioned country. (Here Mr.
Grinderby helped himself plentifully to his accustomed 
stimulant.)</p>

<p>COUS. Yes; but he did not go then. There was a
suspicion afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>GRIN. Of a darker crime, of a more dangerous error.
True, but he baffled his pursuers. I know, of course,
what you allude to. Yes, he returned from Jersey
or Guernsey, whither he betook himself at first, and
succeeded, previous to the murder business, in corrupting 
Pettingall, the other remaining confidential
clerk. Then came Pettingall's detection. I urged
our client still more strongly to prosecute him. "This
man," said I, "has a wife and seven children." Was
it seven or nine? I really am not quite certain.
"Do not let your too generous heart be influenced by
this circumstance," I remarked. "The parish will
take care of them. His wife," I added, "may waylay
you and bathe your feet with her tears. She is
actually in this office at this moment for that purpose." 
Or, let me see, it was you, I think, who told
him that, with your usual inadvertence. I have often

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

wondered how you could be so thoughtless, Mr.
Cousens. Then we heard a sob from yonder room.
I presume that you had left the door ajar by accident;
but I will not be on oath that it was. If it was, all
I can say is, that it was very careless of you, Mr.
Cousens. That sob was well timed for Pettingall.
Our foolish and now ruined client insisted on seeing
her. It was all over in five minutes. Pettingall is
now manager of a flourishing Company, raised on
the very business connexion of our client's late father.
I dined with him on Sunday. He has some superb
pictures and port wine. I often think of the disinterested 
conduct of the firm on that occasion, in
urging the adoption of the severest measures; for it
certainly would not have suited us that Pettingall
should have been prosecuted any more than Manvers.</p>

<p>COUS. All this is so exceedingly well known to me,
that I wonder you should take the trouble to repeat
it. May I ask what you are driving at?</p>

<p>GRIN. If I could only school your mind, Mr.
Cousens, into more painstaking habits, more categorical 
precision!</p>

<p>COUS. You would die happy, I suppose. But pray
continue your amusement.</p>

<p>GRIN. I was never more in earnest. Seriously,
I wish to bring the whole matter clearly before
you; and to do so necessitates a little patience
on your part, and prolixity on mine. Where
was I?</p>

<p>COUS. You were remarking that it did not suit the
firm, that Pettingall should be prosecuted any more
than Manvers.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

<p>GRIN. Just so. (<i>Takes snuff</i>.) Allow me to congratulate 
you on your attention. Well, then, Pettingall, 
who had control over everything after Manvers
had left, was supposed to have informed our client of
his exact position, of the purport of the will, of the
value of the property, assets, liabilities, and so forth,
besides the fact that our client's Life Estate is liable;
and not, as appears to have been supposed by him
until now, the whole estates, including that portion
entailed upon his cousin, for the very heavy annuities
paid out of them. Otherwise, it would have been
our duty to inform our client of this trifling circumstance. 
I must say that his carelessness and ignorance 
of business were unparalleled; but the firm,
sir, the firm could not help that. I wonder, however,
that you never apprised him of the fact, Mr. Cousens.
He is your special client, you know. Then, what
with the burning down of his family mansion, uninsured&mdash;very 
deplorable event that&mdash;the lowering of
his rents by the flexibility of his country agents, the
absconding of the tenant on his largest farm, leaving
a year's rent unpaid, and the land greatly impoverished, 
and his weak and absurd direction of the
will of an aged aunt who was devoted to him in
favour of a female cousin, thereby making her a
present of a sum of nearly twelve thousand pounds,
a portion of which he actually owes, and for which
he is about to be vicariously sued by that pious and
business-like woman, who has cleverly transferred the
debt&mdash;all this, sir, coupled with his own ridiculous
expenditure, has, I deeply regret to say, brought our
client to the veryge of ruin by the forfeiture of
his estate.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

<p>COUS. I thought there was a chance of raising the
whole amount from the "Albatross," or some other
large insurance office, on a policy to cover all?</p>

<p>GRIN. That is his own preposterous notion. I am
surprised, Mr. Cousens, that you should have encouraged 
such an obvious delusion. Pray, sir, what
security could he give for payment of the premiums?</p>

<p>COUS. Then you mean to say that it is all U.P.
with him?</p>

<p>GRIN. He has not the ghost of a chance, sir. At
this moment he is not really worth the price of a
dinner at an eating-house.</p>

<p>COUS. And you gave a cheque for ten guineas on
his account to a charity-school last Tuesday!</p>

<p>GRIN. Hem! Possibly I was wrong there. But
I was not quite prepared until this morning for the
final stoppage&mdash;the winding-up order, as I may say,
Mr. Cousens.</p>

<p>COUS. And he is not yet aware of the real state of
his affairs?</p>

<p>GRIN. Um! I thought it only just to prepare him
a little the other day. You were not here&mdash;some
private business, I think&mdash;assignment of furniture
<i>re</i> Graham and lady, if I am not mistaken&mdash;was it
not? I conveyed a faint foreshadowing of the truth.
But, I must say, I don't think that he realised it at
all perfectly. You see he is still surrounded by
certain substantial tokens of wealth&mdash;houses, furniture, 
horses, and the like. A little string has to be
pulled yet, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>COUS. The shadows alone remain. A pretty dissolving 
picture, as one may say. I should think that

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

all this, coupled with Mrs. Aubrey's suicide, will
bring down his pride at last with a run.</p>

<p>GRIN. Pride goes before a fall, Mr. Cousens. You
must feel for him deeply, who have been so intimate
with him. I never was. I am happy to say, sir, that
he never was a personal friend of mine.</p>

<p>COUS. If you mean to wound my feelings unnecessarily, 
Mr. Grinderby, all I can say is, that I suppose
I must put up with it! But I must remind you that
much even of my undoubted intimacy with Mr.
Aubrey was a mere matter of business.</p>

<p>GRIN. So much the better, sir, so much the better.
There is less chance of sentiment interfering with
duty. Oblige me by a sight of the ledger. Thank
you! Hem! hem! (<i>reading it</i>). You must make
our bill of costs heavier.</p>

<p>COUS. It can't be done; I believe we have
charged him even for acknowledging a basket of
game. I have debited him a guinea a day and expenses, 
even for my most friendly visits. I met him
in Chancery-lane the day after the intelligence of
the wreck of his yacht, the vessel in which I made
that trip to which you have been pleased so facetiously
to allude. You will see entered: "To conference
with you, when you stated the loss of your pleasure-vessel, 
thirteen shillings and fourpence." I mention
this to show you that I have done my duty scrupulously 
by the firm (<i>with emotion</i>), sinking the feelings
of a friend utterly in my treatment.</p>

<p>GRIN. I thought he had rather dropped your
friendship of late?</p>

<p>COUS. No, Mr. Grinderby, no, sir; on the other

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

hand, I have rather dropped his. The fact is, I could
not bear to witness such extravagance, and&mdash;certainly
he has behaved ill, sir, very ill; but I referred only
to the past. Unfortunately, Mr. Grinderby, I am
burdened with a heart, yes, sir, a heart! (And here
Mr. Cousens lightly and airily tapped the left side
of his somewhat contracted pectoral department.)</p>

<p>GRIN. You haven't been butcher enough to charge
that in the bill, have you? Listen, Mr. Cousens.
Always, as a "principle," put down double to a poor
client, but treble to one in difficulties. In a case like
this, it is a principle which admits of almost unlimited
extension. But be careful how you make your bill
out against a rich client to whom the transfer of his
business is not only a possible, but an easy undertaking.</p>

<p>COUS. Really, Mr. Grinderby, you talk to me as
if I were a child, a boy scarcely out of my articles.
But it is your pleasure to insult me this morning.
Continue, sir, I beg.</p>

<p>GRIN. Old Dick Scrimpshire, to whom I was
articled in the country, the best lawyer I ever knew,
who would have charged his own mother's executors
for attending her funeral, if he had been able; a
man who never had a feeling in his life, and always
acted on principle to the last, once handed me a silver
bed-candlestick, on which was a complimentary inscription 
to himself from the Lord Lieutenant of
his county, also a man of principle, and the most
pedantic hypocrite of his day, a nobleman who took
honours at the university without talent, and bored
all Cidershire successfully on the strength of it

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

during his whole lifetime, a man who gained a reputation 
for charity without ever giving away a penny,
and set the most delightful example of goodness to
his neighbours that possibly could be conceived.
Well, I naturally observed to old Scrimpshire, that
it was no wonder he was so rich, and able to live up
to the requirements of a splendid Elizabethan country
mansion, with such clients as his lordship. "Stop,"
he said, "my boy, there's no hurry. What did you
think of the sentiment I uttered at family prayers
this very evening?" I was obliged to own I didn't
know: for I had been looking at a pretty housemaid
between my fingers as I was kneeling, and didn't
notice exactly what old Scrimpshire was saying. I
was a brand, sir, then, a brand, since saved out of
the burning. "I never got out of Lord Mortington," 
said he, "anything but the value of that
candlestick. And what's more," he said, "I've got
five noble lords for clients; and I never made a
penny by the whole lot." "Then, sir," said I, "I
don't understand anything at all; for I should have
thought that was what made you rich." "That!"
replied old Scrimpshire, "that be blowed;" and he
suited the action to the word, blowing his own candle
out. Not that, if all was true, he much liked the
dark, didn't old Scrimpshire. "I'll tell you what,
young man," he continued, "I never made a penny
directly by the whole lot, and you may throw old
Sir Phipson Feckenham," naming a well-known
wealthy country baronet who was his client, "into
the bargain. Not but what this sort of thing is
worth money," he added; "for when you've got the

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

rich and titled for your clients, you can do as you like
with the rest. Never make out a heavy bill against
a man that can take his own part, lad Grinderby,"
he said. "There, take thy light, and don't forget thy
lesson. It will make a rich man of thee some day
when I'm dead and buried. I loved him as a father,
Mr. Cousens, which don't mean more than a proper
respect for the inheritance, and I've acted up to his
saying ever since."</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens was somewhat surprised at his
partner's garrulity; but he said nothing more, save
to ask whether or not he should make Mr. Aubrey
any more advances, if they were requested.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cousens, sir!" answered Grinderby. "How
can you ask such a question! Yes, certainly, on the
valid security of two friends, and I think it would
puzzle him to find one in the world. Otherwise not
a penny, sir, not a penny. We have all his deeds
and papers, I think?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said Cousens, "including the maps
of his estates, and his own deeds of gift to half a dozen
small annuitants, including his late father's coachman 
and butler, the half-yearly dividends of which
are due, by-the-bye, to-morrow. I suppose I may
pay these?"</p>

<p>"Pay nothing, sir," returned the senior; "but
receive everything. We shall have, as it is, to forego
a portion of our bill of costs, though I have kept it
down from time to time, in anticipation of his ruin.</p>

<p>"Is the declaration out in Aubrey <i>v</i>. Flitter?"
asked Grinderby.</p>

<p>"No," answered Cousens.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

<p>"Then stop it!" said his partner. "We cannot
afford to carry on litigation any further for a fellow
like him."</p>

<p>"But we are certain to recover heavy damages,"
interposed Cousens.</p>

<p>"Fie, Mr. Cousens," retorted Grinderby, "I
thought you knew better than that. There never
was a case yet came into Court of which the issue
was certain; that is, unless either plaintiff or defendant 
should happen to be unable to fight it out
for want of money. And even then there is always
the dread of bankruptcy. Don't talk to me about
the rights of a case. I'm proud to say, sir, that the
law is above such paltry trammels. 'The better the
case the less chance of a verdict,' is my motto. I
thought you knew better than talk such sentimental
rubbish, Mr. Cousens."</p>

<p>"As you please, sir," replied Cousens; "I wish to
be guided entirely by you in this matter."</p>

<p>"We are ready for the painful event," returned
Grinderby, taking a prolonged pinch of snuff. "Of
course we shall speak with great consideration, and
in a style due to the character and feelings of the
firm. He will be at first enraged, and then astounded;
and will finally seek out a respectable firm to attack
us, and tax our bill. So much the better. A sharp
practitioner might give us trouble, if he saw his way.
It is no use concealing that such a man as old
Scrimpshire could put the worst construction on our
conduct and motives. There is no saying, unfortunately, 
what some members of the profession will do.
Are you attending, Mr. Cousens?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

<p>That gentleman implied his assent; but the fact
was, his thoughts had really wandered off to Lorrimore 
Villas.</p>

<p>"The state of the case is as follows," resumed
Grinderby. "Our client owes one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-four pounds sixteen shillings and
ninepence halfpenny, arrears of interest on the mortgage 
effected by his late father, and which he ought
to have paid out of the personalty on the demise. I
think you persuaded him to invest in Ecuador Bonds
or Paraguay Securities, or something of that kind, at
the time?"</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken, I assure you," interrupted 
Cousens. "I did nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"Not the least consequence," said Grinderby;
"the advice was not written, I suppose. Now, I
must contrive to alarm the mortgagees suddenly,
who still believe our client to be a rich, extravagant
young dog. I think we had better not apprise the
other creditors as yet. Then, if we put an execution
at once into the house, and force a sale of the settled
property through the assignment by Aubrey's cousin,
which I spoke of, and in which matter the assignees,
a country firm, only await a hint from me, I think
we shall have managed the business pretty well, Mr.
Cousens, pretty well."</p>

<p>"But I can't quite see the ultimate advantage you
are driving at," said Cousens. "Might we not have
made more in the end by saving our client&mdash;mind I
speak entirely without feeling in the matter&mdash;and
wouldn't it have been a safer game?"</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby cast a curious glance at his partner,

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

as if he would have read his inmost thoughts, even
had they fled for concealment down into the very toes
of his patent-leather boots. The scrutiny seemed to
reassure him. The fact is, Mr. Grinderby had a
much deeper, and darker, and blacker design, and
one in which both partners of the firm were not intended 
by him to participate.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied, "it would not. It was my
earnest desire to have saved Mr. Aubrey from absolute 
ruin, if it had been only for your sake, who are
his friend. Ahem! stop! an idea strikes me. Don't
you think, as you are so shocked by this deplorable
and afflicting event, you had better go out of town
for awhile, and leave the present painful duty which
devolves on us, on me? Suppose you took the
feelings of the firm down with you to the Isle of
Wight, or Boulogne&mdash;what do you say to Boulogne
for a week or so? You can come back before there
is any chance of meeting our client there, you know.
But between ourselves, I think that Whitecross-street
will be the outside limit of his excursions this year.
A trip to the East! eh? Not so bad, that. Won't
entitle him to membership in the Travellers' Club
though, will it?"</p>

<p>The proposition suited Mr. Cousens extremely
well at the moment, for more reasons than one. The
fact is, he did not want, on mature reflection, to be
obliged to kick Graham; nor, to say the truth, did
he care much to meet the first violence of Aubrey's
wrath. So he assented with a mere formal expression
that he had no desire to shirk work. How long this
already long conversation would have extended even

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

then, it is impossible to say; for Grinderby was evidently 
in the mood to talk. Like all reserved men,
when he did break out, there was no stopping him.
When any one wanted him to converse, he would be
unpleasantly taciturn. He was like the singers commemorated 
by Horace:</p>

<p class="small">Ut nunquam inducant animum cantare rogati;<br/>

Injussi, nunquam desistant.</p>

<p>A knock at the door, however, relieved Mr.
Cousens from any further penance; for however interesting 
the subject Mr. Grinderby had ventilated,
the junior partner felt he had had enough of it.
Besides, his nerves were unstrung, and he wanted
another glass of "bitter."</p>

<p>"Come in!" croaked the harsh voice of Grinderby.</p>

<p>A shy-looking individual, we mean in personal
appearance, not manners, entered. He looked like a
cross between a waiter at a fifth-rate tavern, and a
billiard-marker in the City. He wore a monkey-jacket, 
of which the blue edges were grown whitish
with use, and the left sleeve presented the appearance 
of a pen-wiper; and why shouldn't it, since it
had done good service in that capacity? His black
hair was parted and plastered down the middle, and
his face resembled one of the Lipari islands, subject
to continual eruption.</p>

<p>"The writ for the widow Tomkins is ready, sir,"
said this individual.</p>

<p>"Very distressing, Mr. Slurker, indeed I may say
a painful necessity; but the firm must do its duty,
sir, irrespective of its feelings."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

<p>There was a slight earthquake, a suppressed upheaving 
of the surface, visible in the seat of the
eruption. Mr. Shirker would have grinned, but
dared not. The fact is, he had heard the remark
before, and was prepared for it.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Mr. Slurker," continued Grinderby.
"If Mr. Aubrey should call, I will see him, as Mr.
Cousens is going to Boulogne for his health. He is
greatly shocked, sir, by intelligence which has reached
him this morning. As I shall be very busy, you
can let Mr. Aubrey wait for half an hour in the
clerks' office when he comes. Do you understand,
Mr. Slurker?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied that worthy; "offer him 'The
Times'?"</p>

<p>"Hem!" said Grinderby, "why no, not exactly to-day. 
That might be inconvenient, Mr. Slurker."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it might, certainly," replied Slurker.
"Then I'm not to offer him 'The Times'?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! get along with you. Do as you
like. After all, the firm has not time to study
feelings."</p>

<p>Mr. Slurker looked puzzled, and made his exit.
He remained in perfect ignorance of Mr. Grinderby's
meaning till lunch-time, when he took a spell at the
police reports. As he did so, the eruption grew
a trifle paler.</p>

<p>"The infernal old vampire!" he said, "if he's got
a heart at all, which I very much doubt, it's a precious
sight harder than a grindstone. Poor thing! poor
thing! And such a beauty! I remember she quite
took my breath away the day she called at the office.

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

I never saw a woman to compare with her for looks;
no, not even in the Argyll Rooms." And Mr.
Slurker fell into a reverie, in which he figured as a
red-cross knight, slew Aubrey in single combat, consigned 
Grinderby to the deepest dungeon under his
castle moat, and as a reward, married Blanche, whom
he saved from the foaming waters by grasping her
with one arm round her waist, and holding on with
the other to a weeping willow, such as he had seen
somewhere between Cremorne and Mortlake. And
they say that chivalry is dead in the human mind!</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, sir!" said Cousens to Grinderby,
as soon as Mr. Slurker had vanished, "you surely
don't think, do you, that Aubrey will come here <i>to-day?</i>"</p>

<p>"Why not?" returned the other; "where else should
he go? What fitter place can there be, than a
solicitor's office under such circumstances? Besides,
he could not have cared for her much, if all tales are
true. As far as he is concerned, I think it is about
the only good thing that could happen to him. What
could he have done, sir? And what could she have
done? I don't suppose she would have liked being a
governess again!"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Cousens, "he must feel it."</p>

<p>"Feel a fiddlestick!" quoth Grinderby. "What did
he cause her to drown herself for, then? But if he
does, I should like to know where so wholesome a
check upon feeling is to be found, as here? For the
solace of misery by counter-irritation, I'll back Webb's
Fields against all the world, especially in the case of
a ruined client."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

<p>Mr. Cousens said no more. Of the precise nature
of Aubrey's domestic offences, perhaps he was a
better judge than Grinderby, who, though an offender
in that way himself, was not so from idleness or
vanity. He also knew better how to estimate the
nature of the terrible chastisements that had fallen
upon his client and quondam friend. He knew that
that day, ay, and for weeks, and probably months,
it was highly improbable the shadow of Arthur
Aubrey would darken the doorway of the firm in
Webb's Fields&mdash;ruin or no ruin, threat or no threat,
advantage or disadvantage. But, on the whole, he
favoured the notion of getting away. He preferred
to escape the immediate chance of meeting anywhere, 
or anyhow, the ruined client and the betrayed
patron and injured friend. Besides, there was the
Graham business, as we have said. So he merely
asked Grinderby, if he should want to see him again
before his departure, which that gentleman answered
in the negative.</p>

<p>"But," he added, "I should be glad if you could
meet me at the 'Ferret and Blue Bag' to lunch, at
two o'clock. I am going home thence. The fact
is, I have promised my girls a walk. I am shortly
going to send Mrs. G. and the young people down
to Herne Bay for a month. I shall come up to town
every day by railway. Ah! Mr. Cousens, what an
opportunity for religious study that affords. When
I live out of town, I always bring up my Bible and
a volume of sermons in the train. I wish I could
prevail on you to do the same," he added. "We
busy lawyers are too apt to lose sight of our immortal

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

reversions in the unremitting prosecution of our
mundane affairs. For my part, I never think that
business prospers during the week, if I neglect my
religious duties on a Sunday. You are a sad heathen,
Mr. Cousens, a sad heathen, sir. It looks ill even
in a worldly point of view. I wish you would attend
church regularly."</p>

<p>The heathen partner duly promised to meet his
pious associate at the tavern he had mentioned, and
the pair separated, Mr. Cousens to purchase a yachting-jacket 
and glazed hat of nautical pretensions for
his trip, and Mr. Grinderby to his own especial den
to knit the final meshes of Aubrey's doom.</p>

<p>They had barely left the room, when the sandy
head of their junior common-law clerk, whom some
would have termed an errand-boy, was thrust in.
Approaching Mr. Cousens's table, he laid thereon a
copy of the "Law Times," which had just come in,
peeped about to discover if he could pick up any information 
from an open letter, picked up some scraps
of torn papers from the floor, put them together, before
consigning them to the waste-basket, to see if there
was any secret he might glean, and then indulged in
the following remarks, accompanied by a series of
winks and grimaces which would have done credit to
the late eminent comedian Mr. Robson, or that most
promising chip of the old block and living likeness
of him, his son. "Ritooral-looral-loo!" said this
worthy to himself. "Ain't the governors agoing
to have a jolly flare-up with our swell client, Mr.
Aubrey! We shall quite miss him, I declare. Such
prime cigars he smokes! Quite an ornament to

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

our office. And then the tin boxes, all lettered so
conspikuous&mdash;the 'Estate of John Aubrey, deceased,'
'Life Estate of Arthur Aubrey, Eskvir,' 'Aubrey's
Trustees,' which the other two resigned immediate,
and never did nothing, as I've heard say, that he
might ruin hisself more easier under the directions
of this gallus firm of ourn. They've got a precious
firm hold of him. Ha, ha! and a personal friend,
too, of Phil Cousens, honest Phil, gentleman by Act
of Parlyment! I should like to have such a friend
as him, I should. Don't I wish Aubrey would kick
our senior pardner all round the Fields. And if he
was to, wouldn't I like 'em to be a sight bigger than
they are? And wouldn't I wish all the porters
and perlice fur enough whilst he was doing of it,
that's all?"</p>

<p>IN the lofty and well-ventilated apartment devoted 
to the "weed" in that semi-aristocratic, demi-plebeian, 
literary, dramatic, and artistic establishment, 

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

the Kemble Club, were assembled, after
dinner, some six members and a brace of strangers,
among whom, for some little time previous to the
moment we have invited our readers to look in upon
them, there had prevailed a truly British silence,
combined with that effort to appear unconscious of
the presence of others, which is so characteristic of
the manners of the unintroduced Englishman. We
do not mean to say that they were all unacquainted
with each other, seeing that the two strangers had
each severally dined with a member; but it is
awkward for any two out of a party not generally
acquainted with each other to carry on a conversation
before all the rest. It is odd how forced and unnatural
such talk usually seems to the rest of the company.
It generally sounds like bragging, or indiscretion, or
bad taste, or impertinence. So the fellows in the
smoking-room of the Kemble apparently thought,
as they sat and glared occasionally at each other,
and sipped their brandy-and-seltzer, or coffee, and
puffed their cigars, and looked at their boots and the
ceiling, and felt if their white neck-ties were all
straight and right.</p>

<p>"What's your idea about the Ministry&mdash;think
they will go out?" ventured to remark a member to
his stranger.</p>

<p>"I really don't know; I suppose they must," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," was the rejoinder. "I
should hardly think they will. Wonderful old fellow,
Pam!"</p>

<p>"Very," said the other, apparently not over strong

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

in politics. "Have you heard what the Admiral
has decided about Kafoozelum?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Going to the Warwickshire?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall."</p>

<p>There were two fellows present who knew that the
bets on Kafoozelum were decided to be void, on
account of an "error" in his age; but they contented 
themselves with severally looking superior to
the speakers, and did not impart the information.</p>

<p>Said the other stranger to his entertainer:</p>

<p>"Awfully good cook yours. I shouldn't think
there is a better anywhere; except, perhaps, at the
Windham. Do you know what they give him?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. I should think three hundred."</p>

<p>"That's not much, is it?"</p>

<p>"No! I suppose not."</p>

<p>"We give ours four, but we are going to give
him five. Old Lord Belleford offered him six to
leave the club, but he said, 'No! he had made the
club, and he wouldn't leave it.' "</p>

<p>"What a brick! He deserves a thousand."</p>

<p>"What I wonder at is," rejoined the other, "how
a man can ever reconcile himself to what you may
call a domestic feed afterwards."</p>

<p>"True," replied his entertainer. "I dined with
Toppington Somers not long ago&mdash;splendid house&mdash;only 
eight guests&mdash;no hens, except Mrs. Topp, who
is rather fast. Would you believe it, I was nearly
poisoned by the smell of the dinner as I went in?&mdash;put 

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

me in mind of a burnt-offering; ha, ha! thought
what was coming. Dinner rather late, guests all
waiting, Mrs. T. smiling, evidently uneasy. Host
looking carving-knives, because he was using none.
Well, I told them a lively story about a Russian
dinner-party, at which every one was poisoned with
the soup, by the cook, whose daughter had been ill-treated 
by a noble&mdash;a cook with any <i>amour-propre</i>
would have done it after dinner in the coffee&mdash;saw 
by expression of Toppington's face, that his
cook was a <i>mauvais sujet</i>. Well, just as I had
finished describing agonies of Russian party, in we
went to dinner. Some one had asked me what soup
it was that was poisoned, and I answered at a shot
<i>bisque d'&eacute;crevisse</i>. Only fancy my delight when I
found that was the very identical <i>potage</i> at the head
of the table."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said the other; "but you don't mean
to say that anybody shied at it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't they? But to tell you the truth, no
poisoner of any talent would have doctored such rubbish. 
It was cold and sticky as glue, and salted! ugh!
The next thing remarkable was a splendid Severn
salmon; cost ten shillings a pound, if it cost a
penny; raw, sir, raw. If I had dined, I should positively 
have enjoyed Toppington's dismay. The rest
of the dinner was equally bad&mdash;the 'burnt-offering'
turned out to be a saddle of mutton, which might
have been baked in Pompeii. As for the wood-cocks&mdash;don't 
mention them. Topp completely lost
his temper, and everything was as dull as ditch-water 
or his confounded claret, which I believe costs

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

the fellow eight pounds a dozen. It finished, however, 
by his asking us all to dine next day at his
club.</p>

<p>"Awful sell!" said the other, rather wearied by
the story.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it? But the best of the fun is, that
dinner had cost Topp ten thousand pounds, if it cost
him a penny."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds!" repeated the other.</p>

<p>"Yes! You must know that he had a snug little
place, before he came into a lot of money by his
uncle's death, and his little dinners then were as jolly
and unpretending as possible. There isn't a nicer
creature than his wife in London. But when he got
the 'tin,' he declared he should never rest until he
had a more commodious dining-room. So he went
into bricks and mortar, and built a house&mdash;and there
it is all gilt, and glare and gas, and French clocks, and
modern decoration. This was his first dinner there."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said the other, "there are
very few private houses in London, where one does
get a decent dinner; and now as it is the fashion to go
into flowers and fruit and gimcracks on the table all
dinner-time, one might as well go through a Barmecide 
feast at a florist's from Covent Garden."</p>

<p>"Last summer," said his friend, "the smell of the
pines and strawberries under one's nose was enough
to take away any appetite short of a navvy's."</p>

<p>"We rush into such absurd extremes in England.
Everything is sacrificed to fashion. Only fancy Briggs
or Tomkins, or Clark, the retired vermin-powder man,
dining <i>&agrave; la Russe</i> at 'Ighgate or 'Olloway, with substantial 

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

posies in cheap glass contrivances, and hired
plants in gaudily decorated flower-pots all up and
down the table, and the hired waiter and occasional
undertaker's mute with his cotton gloves handing
the everlasting flabby brill which does duty for
turbot, and the tough boiled fowls, round to the
vestrymen and churchwardens, the suburban house-agent, 
and apothecary from the corner-house of De
Beauvoir-terrace, in that exceedingly new neighbourhood. 
For my part, I don't care what the style is,
so that the viands are tolerable; but depend upon it
whenever there is pretension, there is discomfort
and cold plates. May I offer you another weed?
Waiter, the cigars!"</p>

<p>Encouraged by this sustained effort at small-talk,
three of the four members of the club, who were on
speaking terms, had indulged in a little spasmodic
babble about the Opera, and kindred topics. One of
these gentlemen was a well-known member of Parliament, 
an upholder of flogging in the Army, and a
strenuous advocate for preventing the sale of small
necessaries on Sunday. He had lately brought in a
bill to shut up all public-houses, and even coffee-shops,
on the Lord's Day, and his speech on that occasion
was printed in the form of a tract, and circulated
"gratis" by the Exeter Hallites. Yet, he knew well
that billiards were played on the Sabbath in the Progress 
Club, of which he was a member, and his small-talk 
was worse than that of any book sold in Holywell-street, 
because of the horrible cynicism that he
mingled with its pruriency. He regaled his hearers
with some very spicy anecdotes with an unctuous

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

gusto, which contrasted almost diabolically with the
ghastly and gelid selfishness of a soul in which all
charity was dead, if, indeed, it had ever existed there
at all, which we more than question. He described
how he had cut a cast-off mistress, who was getting
her living as a chorus-singer at Her Majesty's, and
who had accosted him, when he had gone behind the
scenes in the prosecution of some fresh unholy amour,
which was far more a question of cruel bargain and
sale than any consignment of Circassian slave-girls to
the Turk. Yet you should have heard him denounce
all sympathy with Schamyl, and the tribes of the
Caucasus, and uphold the execrable aggression and
cruelties of Russia, because of this inhuman and un-christian 
traffic! He was in the middle of a story,
by which he stood self-condemned of an act of cold-blooded 
atrocity towards a poor seamstress, which
<i>ought</i> to have excited the manly indignation, had they
possessed any, of his admiring and applauding auditors,
to kick him out of the room, and break his Vitellius-like 
neck down the nearest flight of steps, when a
fresh couple of "Nicotians" entered the room. In
one our readers will recognise the Honourable Fitz-Eustace 
Swellingham, of the 3rd Blues, and in the
other his friend Sidney Snobbington, barrister (not)
at law.</p>

<p>Swellingham, or Fits, as we have already learnt
to call him, entered the smoking-room with the easy
air of a man at home with himself and his position,
and nodded carelessly to three or four of the party.
He flung a successive glance at each of the strangers,
which canoned off them to the wall behind, seated

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

himself with a kind of apathetic nonchalance, and
called to a waiter who happened to be in the room
for cigars. Snobbington, who closely followed him,
and in whose manner a keen observer would have
detected a want of ease and a certain display of consciousness 
resembling that of a bad actor on the
stage, also took an empty seat and a full-flavoured
"Habana," as soon as his friend and patron had
helped himself.</p>

<p>"Coffee, Snob?" said Fits.</p>

<p>"Yaas," replied that individual. "Can't do without 
my caffy, you know."</p>

<p>"Thought you'd have preferred a gin-sling," said
Fits. "They make capital gin-slings here. I'm going
to have one."</p>

<p>"Then I'll have a gin-sling too," quoth Snob.
"It's a tip-top thing when you're thirsty."</p>

<p>"Are you thirsty?" asked the other, as if he didn't
care to know. "Shouldn't have thought it."</p>

<p>The pair had just finished their second bottle of
Lafitte.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," said the other; "but a fellah
can always dwink a sling, you know, especially when
one isn't quite up to the mark."</p>

<p>"Why there's nothing the matter with you, is
there?" drawled Fits. "Shouldn't have thought so
by the way you walked into the <i>sole &aacute; la Cleopatre</i>,
and nearly finished that wild duck, by Jove."</p>

<p>SNOB. Awfully seedy, my dear fellah. It's veway
odd, do you know, but I always eat most when I'm
not quite the thing.</p>

<p>Fits looked at his friend with an expression of

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

calm doubt, mingled with a sort of "permissiveness," 
as much as to say, "Say what you like. It
doesn't in the least matter." And the twain puffed
their weeds in silence.</p>

<p>"In the Park to-day, Swell?" asked one of his
friends.</p>

<p>FITS. Yaas; were you?</p>

<p>FRIEND. Yes; nothing talked of but the affair of
those wretched Aubreys. I should think the fellow
will never show here again.</p>

<p>FITS. Why not? I should imagine he will come
oftener than ever, now that his wife is dead.</p>

<p>SNOB. Ha! ha! capital. Just what I was thinking.</p>

<p>FITS (frowning slightly). Do ring the bell, that's
a good cweechur. It's close by you.</p>

<p>The truth is, Fits considered it hard that what little
thoughts he indulged in should be claimed by his
friend; but he had too much good taste to reprove
him, save by a tone of voice which the other perfectly
understood, and he asked him to ring the bell, in
order to convey his disapproval.</p>

<p>FRIEND. Oh! it's not the wife's affair alone,
though that's bad enough; but I am told that he
is hit devilish hard; gone to the dogs, in short,
altogether.</p>

<p>FITS. I didn't know that "tin" was any qualification 
for this place.</p>

<p>CYNICAL M.P. Deuced considerate of the wife to
drown herself, anyhow! They generally stick to a
man in difficulties with all the delightful obstinacy
for which women are distinguished. They like to
remind him of better days, and bore him with their

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

lackadaisical sympathies, which means reminding
him of being better off, like a perpetual skeleton of
the past&mdash;a sort of affectionate ghost of other days.
If this Aubrey is ruined, it is a piece of luck to get
rid of his wife; and if not, why perhaps he's luckier
still, that's all.</p>

<p>After delivering himself of this club sentiment,
the advocate of the negro, and apologist of the
Czar, a pirate at heart, but philanthropist by profession, 
nodded to Fits, and stalked out of the room,
either to bully the shrinking mother of his progeny,
or to betake himself to some more Malthusian haunt.
Pleasure and free-trade before duty and protection
was the code of ethics which he practised in this
world. He was shortly followed by the others, after
they had sufficiently stretched themselves and yawned,
leaving Fits and Snob together to their cigars and
sling, and such reciprocal advantages as they might
enjoy from each other's society.</p>

<p>"I say," inquired Snob of his friend, before any
one, save the M.P., had gone, "when are you going
out of town? I'm off for a few days' hunting to-morrow 
at the dook's." This was not altogether
false, for Snob had got introduced to the good-natured
Chalkstoneville after all, and the result was a gracious
command to bring his horses down to one of his
grace's hunting-boxes, and have a week's hunting
with the Highflyer fox-hounds. Snob would have
risked breaking his neck fifty times over for such an
invitation, and he had invested in a wonderful silver
dressing-case for the occasion.</p>

<p>FITS. I'm going to Parwis on Wednesday; can't

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

exist any longer in London. (And he yawned as if
at the bare thought of such a punishment.)</p>

<p>SNOB. What a doosed bad affair, though, of that
fellah Aubrey! Always thought him rather low, eh?</p>

<p>FITS. Never saw such twousers as he waw. Saw
him once do a most extwaordinary thing.</p>

<p>SNOB. What was that?</p>

<p>FITS. Horwid old woman carwying bundle and
baby acrwoss stweet, dwopped her bundle in mud,
omnibus coming by. What do you think he
did?</p>

<p>SNOB. Can't think.</p>

<p>FITS. Must!</p>

<p>SNOB. Can't!</p>

<p>FITS. Guess!</p>

<p>SNOB (<i>with sudden animation</i>). Kicked it?</p>

<p>FITS. No!</p>

<p>SNOB. Poked it with umbwella?</p>

<p>FITS. No!</p>

<p>SNOB. Dem it! Fell over it?</p>

<p>FITS. Try again.</p>

<p>SNOB. Pawsitively can't think what a man who
waw such twousers, as you say, would do.</p>

<p>FITS. Give it up?</p>

<p>SNOB. Yaas.</p>

<p>FITS. He picked it up!</p>

<p>SNOB. No?</p>

<p>FITS. And carwid it acwoss the stweet.</p>

<p>SNOB. Oh!</p>

<p>FITS. He did weally. I thought you would be
shocked. Didn't get over it myself till I had dwank
a glass of cura&ccedil;oa. Never liked to shake hands with

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

him after. Always fancied he might have something
the matter with his hands, you know.</p>

<p>SNOB. I don't wonder. But I say, Fits, in spite of
what that brutal Manchester fellow said just now,
wern't you shocked at that horrid suicide of his
wife?</p>

<p>We ought, perhaps, to mention that when our
friend Snob was very much in earnest he often forgot 
his kakophemy, if we may use such a word.</p>

<p>FITS. Awful affair! Some fellahs thought her
handsome.</p>

<p>SNOB. I never did. Did you?</p>

<p>FITS. Not my style. Besides, she had a catawact,
or some such thing, in her eyes.</p>

<p>SNOB. Did you know who she was before he
marwied her?</p>

<p>FITS. Not I!</p>

<p>SNOB. A governess; that's all.</p>

<p>FITS. Gwacious me! Then no wonder that she
jumped off the brwidge. It's just what they do.</p>

<p>SNOB. So I thought.</p>

<p>FITS. No, you didn't.</p>

<p>SNOB. What do you mean?</p>

<p>FITS. My dear Snob, you've a bad habit, and it's
my duty as a fwiend to cawwect it. You're always
saying that you thought something I thought. Now,
if you do think something I think, there's no occasion
to say it. It's very hard if a fellah can't have an
idea of his own.</p>

<p>SNOB. Don't be so sharp on a fellow. But, I say,
didn't you narrowly miss seeing the catastrophe?
How was that?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

<p>FITS. Well, I don't mind telling you, but rather
not talk about it in future. Had been dining at
Richmond with little Montmowency of the ballet,
Kitty Dareall, and Harry Luckless. Went to Surwey
Theatre after, to please Kitty, who is stage-mad.
Horwid place! never go again; drweadful vulgar
wrant&mdash;put me in mind of little prints of actors
spangled with coloured tinfoil in the windows of
sweet-shops, when I was a boy&mdash;"Alonzo the
Bwave" and "Pizarro," with their legs astwaddle,
and that sort of thing, you know. Suppose you were
a boy once&mdash;some people never could have been;
simply impawsible, like old Stingway, you know.
Well, when we came out, it wained and lightened
awfully. There wasn't a cab to be had, and we had
to walk. Kitty put her hood over her head, and
skipped along like a two-year-old&mdash;said she enjoyed
it; can't say I did&mdash;and the Montmowency was as
much afraid of wetting her feet as a female feline
party without pattens. Well, on we twotted till we
got to the brwidge, which was all boarding and
scaffolding, with a narwow footpath just fit for
wobbers. Saw crwowd at the other end; narwowly
escaped being wobbed by a drweadful person&mdash;a
female garwotter should say. Sensation-header just
over; of course, didn't know who it was&mdash;lost Kitty
and Luckless. Got a cab at last, and got home.
Veway ill all night, and nervous system upset all
day; you know a fellah can't help feeling something 
sometimes. Dined with Aubrway only last
week, and saw his wife; didn't think she was so
very unhappy; remember a look now. Snob, ring

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

the bell for some brwandy, old boy. Thank
you.</p>

<p>SNOB. Have they found her yet&mdash;found the body,
I mean?</p>

<p>FITS. Can't say. Haven't seen evening paper&mdash;
don't want to see it. Oh! here's the veway man I
was speaking of. Ask him&mdash;he knows everything.</p>

<p>As he spoke the portly form of Mr. Stingray
appeared at the open door. We shall continue the
conversation that ensued in the first person, as
before.</p>

<p>STING. Good evening, Swellingham. Ah, Snob!
you here too, of course. How's yourself? as the
cads say. Do you know nothing has struck me more
forcibly than the quaint expressions of the lower
orders. I should think <i>you</i> must have noticed it
formerly, Snob?</p>

<p>FITS. Stingway, my dear fellah! aw, aw! we
were just talking of the melancholy sooicide of little
Aubrway. If a fellah will marwy a governess, what
can he expect, you know, eh? My friend Snob here
wants to know if the body is found yet?</p>

<p>STING. Not up to twenty-five minutes past six, at
any rate. But these high tides, you know.</p>

<p>FITS. Stingway, my dear fellah! why haven't they
a Morgue in London? Capital institution, Morgue
in Parwis.</p>

<p>SNOB. Just what the dook said this afternoon&mdash;the 
Dook of Chalkstoneville, you know. "Snob,
my boy," remarked his grace, "I wish we had a
Morgue here, and we'd go after breakfast to-morrow
morning and see the body."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

<p>STING. They must first find it. I fancy the Morgue
is not quite in accordance with the general English
taste. We are so squeamish, you know. The British
idler, Mr. Swellingham, must content himself for
the present with such excitement as prize-fights, and
fires, and executions can furnish?</p>

<p>FITS. Do you dine here to-morrow?</p>

<p>STING. No, not to-morrow.</p>

<p>SNOB. Nor I. I'm invited to Lord Phallusby de
Haut Ton's dinner.</p>

<p>STING. Indeed; then I shall see you there. That's
where I am going.</p>

<p>SNOB. No, I can't go. The truth is, I am asked,
but owing to my, aw, dear father's, aw, severe indisposition, 
I am going to send an excuse to-morwow
morning. Awkward, isn't it? Think his lordship
will take offence?</p>

<p>STING. Can't say; but pray leave it to me. I
have to see his lordship at twelve o'clock to-morrow 
about a leading article he wants in a certain
journal. I'll do it for you. I'll explain to him
your filial devotion, eh? and he will, doubtless, soon
invite you again. Good evening, Swellingham. Bye-bye, 
Snob! (He salutes them, and is apparently
going.)</p>

<p>SNOB (<i>frantically</i>). No, no! Mr. Stingray! Don't
say a word to his lordship, for very particular and
private reasons, which I can't explain just now.
Don't breathe a syllable, I implore you.</p>

<p>STING. Oh! leave it to me. I will see that you
have full justice done to your excellent motive in not
accepting the invitation. Was it to-day that your

<!-- vol 2 page 272 -->

father was taken ill&mdash;I think you said rheumatic
gout? Ta-ta!</p>

<p>SNOB (<i>rushing after him</i>). For Heaven's sake,
don't, don't, you'll ruin me!</p>

<p>STING. Eh? What? What is the matter? I'm in
a hurry. I don't understand you.</p>

<p>SNOB. For Heaven's sake, don't mention me to
his lordship. 'Tis a mistake, that is, a sort of mistake.
The fact is, I am not asked exactly&mdash;that is, to-day;
but I expect an invitation soon through a friend, and
I wanted to know&mdash;that is, I thought if my father
should be ill, what .... what excuse a .... I
could make, you know. You understand, dear Mr.
Stingray, don't you?</p>

<p>STING. Hem! yes, I fancy I do. Well, then, to
oblige you I won't say a word to his lordship; the
more so (<i>very loudly and deliberately</i>) because, Mr.
Snobbington . . . because, sir, I don't happen to be
invited there to-morrow myself&mdash;that's all. Good
evening!</p>

<p>SNOB (<i>following him aside and whispering</i>). My
dear Mr. Stingray, don't tell any one of this little
joke of mine; and you know that carved oak book-case 
you admired so much? I ordered it to be sent
to you to-morrow&mdash;indeed I did!</p>

<p>STING. Nay, if you would bribe me to silence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>SNOB. Hush! don't use such awfully strong expressions, 
my dear friend.</p>

<p>STING. As a point of friendship&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>SNOB. Enough! a thousand thanks. I can assure
you it has been immensely admired. It came from
an old moated grange in our family.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

<p>STING. If it did, I'm a Montenegrin. I have seen
it in Wardour-street for eighteen months at least. I
could have had it for thirty-five pounds.</p>

<p>SNOB. I gave fifty pounds, on my honour.</p>

<p>STING. (<i>aside</i>). What a lying rascal it is. (<i>Aloud</i>.)
My dear old boy, to please you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>FITS. Stingway, my dear fellah, before you go,
can you tell us any more about these unfortunate
Aubrways?</p>

<p>STING. Don't know what you have heard already.
I was at the police-office this morning&mdash;thence, as
Pepys would have had it, to Scotland-yard, where I
saw the cloak said to have been stolen by the orange-girl, 
alleged to be a desperate vagrant and beggar,
known to the Force. Poor devil! she got six
months for it. Shows activity on the part of our
precious guardians, to lock somebody up. She said
she only picked the cloak up, and I've no doubt she
spoke the truth, though doubtless she was capable of
stealing it, had it not lain at her feet.</p>

<p>FITS. Don't believe it, Stingway, my dear fellah;
believe she did steal it. She's a female garwotter&mdash;nearly 
garwotted me.</p>

<p>STING. To be sure, you were there! Yes, I heard
all that. Well, Aubrey has got a brain fever, which
is likely enough to settle his hash. It seems that he
opened his wife's desk, and read her letters. Rash
thing on the part of any man who wants to live
happily with his spouse. He first penned a challenge
to Luckless, and then attempted to cut his own
throat; but was stopped by a faithful servant, whose
wages were not paid up. It took four men to hold

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

him, and in despite of all their efforts, he smashed a
marble washing-stand, and four china cups. Struck
with sudden remorse, the unhappy and guilty woman,
instead of packing up her jewels, and flying to the
Continent, where she might have sued him first, or
at least brought a cross action, which, <i>entre nous</i>,
would not have been a very difficult task, drank a
bottle of cyanide of potassium, which had been got
for amateur photography, and took a cab to the
river. You know the rest.</p>

<p>FITS. This comes of marrying beneath you, just
as I said. There never is anything like gwatitude
on the part of these low people.</p>

<p>STING. It was no great <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>. He is only
the son of a corn-merchant in the City.</p>

<p>FITS. A pwetty fellah to be so proud!</p>

<p>SNOB. I remember he was once quite wude to me
in the Park.</p>

<p>STING. The fool is utterly ruined into the bargain.</p>

<p>FITS. Is that pawsitively a fact?</p>

<p>STING. You know Phil Cousens, the solicitor;
wide-awake, kind-hearted Phil?</p>

<p>FITS. Only a little, just to nod to. Snob, here, is
intimate with him, I believe.</p>

<p>SNOB. Not I, indeed.</p>

<p>STING. Well, he told me, of course quite confidentially, 
that it is all up with Aubrey, not a feather
left.</p>

<p>FITS. The deyvil, you don't say so!</p>

<p>STING. Don't I? The bailiffs will be in the house
to-morrow, if they're not there already.</p>

<p>FITS. Confound it, and he owes me two ponies on
Flatcatcher.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

<p>SNOB. These upstart fellahs always come to grwief
in the end.</p>

<p>STING. (<i>aside</i>). That's pretty well for the son of
a rag and bottle merchant.</p>

<p>FITS (<i>aside</i>). I wonder what his chesnut horses
will fetch. I must set some one on to them. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I suppose everything will go to the hammer?</p>

<p>STING. To the plate-warmer and the bottle-rack, a
leaky watering-pot and a garden besom. There are
no children's toys&mdash;no family rocking-horse, minus
tail and mane. Poor Phil Cousens nearly cried when
he told me. Fancy scrofulous Phil in tears. You
know why he sometimes wears white kid gloves at
dinner, don't you? It's to hide king's evil, though
he'll tell you he has just met with an accident and
burnt his fingers. That's what his clients do&mdash;ha,
ha! But you know he was an intimate personal
friend of Aubrey's, by whose ruin the firm will be
hit hard, doubtless.</p>

<p>SNOB. I should think that ought to touch Phil a
precious deal nearer than his friendship for such a
confounded low fellow as this Aubrway.</p>

<p>FITS. I used to say it never did pay to be fwiends
with your lawyer, but it seems it don't do to be
fwiends even with your fwiend.</p>

<p>STING. By-the-bye, what has become of Kitty
Dareall? I saw the shutters up at her house to-day.</p>

<p>FITS. She was close by, you know, on Saturday
night, when poor Mrs. Aubrway drowned herself?</p>

<p>STING. I am told she has gone into the country
in deep mourning, and flung up her engagement at

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

the Thespis. A new surprise. What a clever jade
it is!</p>

<p>FITS. Ha, ha! capital.</p>

<p>STING. The truth of the matter is, she has gone
into retirement before marrying.</p>

<p>FITS AND SNOB. Whom? Luckless?</p>

<p>STING. No! (<i>Places his finger on his lips</i>.) The
Duke!</p>

<p>FITS. What! Chalkstoneville and Acres? Is it
possible? Well, I always said it would come to
that.</p>

<p>STING. Don't you know that's what she came out
at the Thespis for? Well, a man may have a worse
mother-in-law than that convenient matron the
British Drama.</p>

<p>FITS. I always thought she was fond of Luckless.</p>

<p>STING. Cel&agrave; n'emp&ecirc;che pas!</p>

<p>FITS. To be sure! The duke is only out on parole
from his coffin. And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>STING. Luckless may be in luck! The old boy
can leave four hundred thousand pounds to any one
he pleases, or who pleases him.</p>

<p>SNOB (<i>aside</i>). I wish I had been a little more
attentive to either Luckless or his bride in reversion.
But I shall know how to play my cards down at
Malcourt Spinnies. (<i>Aloud</i>.) As for Aubrway, I shall
cut him dead when I meet him.</p>

<p>STING. Mind he don't shoot you dead. He's the
best pistol shot I ever saw.</p>

<p>SNOB. That wouldn't influence me, if the fellah's a
low fellah. Besides, I never was intimate with him.</p>

<p>STING. No! I believe he fought rather shy of you.

<!-- vol 2 page 277 -->

Why, I don't believe you knew him at all; not even
a bowing acquaintance. Confess, now. It's too bad
to talk of cutting a man you don't know. It's almost
as bad as excusing yourself to Phallusby.</p>

<p>FITS. Stingway, my dear fellah, you two fellahs
are always chaffing. Can't you leave Snob alone?
I'm sure he never hurts any one, and isn't half such
an artful old plotter as you are. Are you, Snob?
Now don't look so spiteful. Let's look in at the
"Wag" together, and hear the last news from
India, and if there's any chance of my wegiment
being sent out, I shouldn't half mind it; for I'm tired
of this sort of life, demmed tired of you, Sting, and
Snob here, and all the lot of you. 'Pon honour, I
don't believe the niggers are half such a bad lot as
some of you London fellahs, after all. (<i>After delivering 
himself of this unusually long speech, Mr.
Swellingham pulls Snobbington towards the door</i>.)
Stingway, my dear fellah, come along.</p>

<p>STING. Why don't you belong to the "Rag,"
Snobbington; surely you are eligible? Ha, ha!
(<i>Swell. and Snob. go out</i>.) It's as well he is out of
hearing, for I do believe if he had heard what was
at the tip of my tongue, the fellow would have
struck me. Why his father was a rag-merchant.
Ho! ho! Now who would think, to hear him talk,
that he dotes on his old fat greasy mother, whom he
surrounds with every luxury, and would do anything
in the world for save walk out with her at the
West-end; and that, moreover, he is beyond a doubt
privately married to that girl of his, and is the
exemplary parent of about five or six of the ugliest

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

little cubs in existence, all with light hair and blue
eyes like himself, which some folks would call cherubs?
Ha, ha, ha! I must jot down some of this for my
next novel. This is the only repayment which I
exact from my stupid friends and acquaintances as a
compensation for eating their indifferent dinners and
being generally bored by themselves. Shall I follow
them to the "Rag?" I hate the Army as I do the
Irish. No, I'll drop in at the "Dust-hole," and hear
what more is said about this affair of the Aubreys.
How that woman shied me, to be sure! And I suppose 
some fools abuse me, because I'm not sorry that
she has come to grief.</p>

<p>And the old wretch buttoned himself up as carefully, 
as if his existence were a blessing to Society,
and introduced a story of his own benevolence with
such consummate skill at the "Dust-hole," that
young Lord Alicompane told his friend, the Hon.
Everton Toffey, in confidence, he didn't believe there
was such another dear old kind buffer as Stingray in
the world, by Jove! he didn't.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE MAN IN POSSESSION.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">A Familiar of the Inquisition is a joke to him. He is a coarse fiend
smelling of tobacco-smoke worse than brimstone. His civilities are
insults; his efforts to be comfortable more atrocious than the license of
a gorilla let loose in your home. Yet he may have a heart, a conscience, 
and a family of small children; he may have been the victim
of legal iniquity himself, and probably compared with the respectable
Harpies of the Law who sent him thither, he is an angel sitting by your
fireside.&mdash;<i>Characters in Crayon. By Blank Lottery, Esquire</i>.</p>

WE must now look in again at the Maisonette in
Queen's-square. Alas! the light of the house, the <i>ὂμμα 
δόμων παρουσία</i> as the Greek tragedian has it, blind as
she was, had departed, and nothing was left behind
but confusion, terror, and despair. Mr. Binsby
had requested leave to go away suddenly; and,
in default of permission, we believe that he would
actually have taken French leave, as the kind-hearted 
cook did. "How," said the latter, "wish
you that I should remain? But it is impossible,
I tell you. Let us see. There is two months of
benefice due. Then, I shall give it to him, to this
master, the cruel, the perfidious, who has assassinated
an angel, I tell you, an angel. Ah! I should like to
fight myself against him with swords, and avenge that

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

poor angel. Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Quelle l&acirc;chet&eacute;."
And he packed up his things, and left the house with
tears and maledictions, mingled with salutations to the
domestic circle. Mr. Binsby, on the contrary, gravely
requested to know if his services could be dispensed
with. They were, without objection or hindrance.
Strange to say, Tops, who was dismissed, remained.
Aubrey did not notice it; or, at least, said nothing, if
he did. In fact, he kept his room, and when called
forth spoke and moved mechanically, as in a dream.
For three days he took no sustenance beyond a cup
of tea or a drink of water. On the fourth, there came
a heavy missive from Spider's-court, Webb's Fields,
the perusal of which seemed, in some degree, to
wake him up from his lethargic state. At all events,
he wrote some answer to it, which was duly sent.
It was then the fourth day since the catastrophe,
and Susan and Tops were conversing together in the
dining-room, where a third person sat in an arm-chair, 
in the shape of a strange and singularly hoarse
young man, with light hair, and of very questionable
appearance, who had called about an hour before, in
company with a Jewish-looking gentleman, in a light
taxed cart. These individuals had driven up to the
door, and rung the bell, after first directing a very
dirty young Israelite, who sat between them on the
trap, to hold the horse's head. The moment the door
was opened, they walked in so suddenly, that Susan,
who admitted them, was on the point of calling out
for assistance, thinking them to be thieves. The
older and darker, if not dirtier, man quickly undeceived 
her, for he dived into a capacious gulf in his

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

velveteen coat, and brought out thence a huge black
greasy pocket-book, whence he in turn extracted a
folded paper, which he opened with horny finger and
thumb. This was an execution on the goods of Mr.
Arthur Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I s'pose it's all right, miss," he said to the frightened 
and astonished Susan. "Me and this young
man, as you'll find werry civil and obligin', will take
the hinwentory this arternoon a little later, if you
please." Here he whispered to the dirty pale man,
who was attired in a dress-coat and corduroys, and
wore an emaciated cloth cap, with a long cloth peak,
which was somehow connected with a bow of rusty
black ribbon, and which gave his head a kind of
"snipey" appearance, if we may coin such a word.
"I'm agoing round" (nod) "there to the coachus"
(wink) "and stablin' " (nod) "as soon as I've picked
up Jem Bosky. It's a job as'll suit him. He's so
desperate oncivil." (Nod.) "He ain't fit for our
business, he ain't. There's no call to be oncivil, cos
folks is down in the world. And I have know'd them
as has been tip-toppers again, after a little affair of
this kind." (Extra double and prolonged wink.)
"There, my dear" (to Susan), "don't take on. It's
not as if we was goin' to take him, and even that,"
he said, cheerily, "ain't halways sech a fatal go.
Lor' bless yer, yer should see wot I've seen."</p>

<p>"If it warn't for the fammerly misfortin," suddenly 
cut in the dirty, pale young man, "I should
say it was part of a swell's hedication to go through
summut of this 'ere."</p>

<p>"Lor' bless hall yer innersent 'arts, yes," said the

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

dirty dark man to the assembled knot of servants,
which now included Tops, the housemaid, page, &amp;c.,
in fact, all the household, with the exception of
Binsby, Monsieur Isidore, and the housekeeper, who
was ill in bed with a dreadful nervous attack.
"There's a gent as has guv me many a gold sufferin
many a time since, as I was put into vith jest sech a
job as this. Only it was in chambers, and he warn't
a married gent, leastways not then. I shall never
forget what a spree we had. Fust of all, he was
goin' to show fight. But a friend of hisn put him
hup to that being a serious affair, yer see. So his
lordship he changed his tone quite sudden. 'Let's
'ave grilled bones,' ses he, 'and lashins of mulled
claret, and friend Heiron here,' that was me, yer see,
'shall spin yarns about his hexperience.' There was
three young ladies come in from the bally arterwards,
and a precious spree it was haltogether. I told him
a lot that he never heerd before, you may be sartain;
and now that he's a great man in the world, he never
forgets to pass a civil word when we meets. Vy, I
told him vun story, as cost him a hundred pound to
relieve a fammerly, as had a distress in at the werry
same time as he had; and he told me t'other day, the
werry last time we met, 'Heiron,' says he, 'them
stories of yourn are likely to lead to ax of remedgial
ledgehislation.' 'I hopes,' I ses, 'my lord, that it's
nothin' that'll hinterfere with my business.' 'If it
does, Heiron,' ses he, 'come to me, and I'll see that
ye're compensated,' says he. So, votever it is, it's
hall right, yer see; and that's all along of bein'
reasonable and good-natured. My mate here" (pointing 

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

to the dirty, pale young man) "he's werry good-natured, 
and he'll smoke his pipe vere he's told, and
hinterfere with nothin' and nobody, 'xcept in the way
o' business."</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Heiron politely nodded and winked
all round, and rapidly betook himself to the tax-cart,
which drove off, "like a flash," as Susan afterwards
said, and left them all standing there <i>in statu quo</i>,
<i>plus</i> the dirty pale young man, who had seated himself 
on the edge of a chair, after partially going
through the pantomime of dusting it with the tail of
his coat. As it was his coat which required cleaning,
and not the chair, the precise meaning and intention
of this process were by no means obvious. The question 
now arose who should acquaint Mr. Aubrey with
this state of things. Poor Susan, who, to do her
justice, was plunged in the deepest grief, and whose
face was as white, and whose eyes were as swelled and
red, as those of Niobe might have been prior to actual
liquefaction, burst into a new channel of grief. Tops
drew the back of his hand across his eyes, and said
he would as "lief never look a 'oss in the face again."
The rest, one and all, declared they couldn't and
wouldn't go for to tell him on no account&mdash;"Not,"
said the scullery-maid, "as it 'ud matter what you
tell him of now, in a manner of speaking." Gradually
they all melted away to their various duties, leaving
Tops, Susan, and the dirty pale young man, who
seemed by his manner rather a genial individual than
otherwise.</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer wot it is," he remarked; "it's hall
werry creditable to this 'ere little society in the way

<!-- vol 2 page 284 -->

of feelinx, but the guvernor must be told wot's up,
and that's hall about it."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better tell him," said Tops; with a
degree of hoarseness in his throat which sounded as
if he had swallowed a woollen stocking.</p>

<p>"Jest wot I was about to perpose, friend drabs,"
said the other with an air of ineffable patronage.
"Let 'buttins' knock at his door, and say there's a
party as must speak to him a moment. It'll do him
good in the present state o' matters."</p>

<p>At any other time the sole answer which Tops was
likely to have vouchsafed would have been to place
himself in an attitude of self-defence, and request
the dirty pale young man to "come on." But he
was too much "beat," to use his own expression, to
resent the impertinence of the intruder.</p>

<p>"All right, mate," he responded. "I reckon that's
about the way of it."</p>

<p>So "buttins" was summoned and sent up to announce 
the pale young man, who followed him pretty
closely.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey heard what the unwelcome visitant
said, which he did after his own rude way, but with
as much rough kindness as he knew how to infuse
into such an announcement. "Werry sorry, sir, for
this 'ere job, but somebody's got to do it, and it
might be in wuss hands, you see. I'll keep as much
as possible hout of yer way, bein' honly in 'ere on the
'special.' "</p>

<p>"Take this person down-stairs," said Aubrey to
the boy, "and see that he is made comfortable."
The pale young man, who had taken off his

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

"snipey" head-piece, and was twisting it into a
variety of shapes, pulled a dust-coloured curl of
tangled hair lower over his forehead, and disappeared
with "buttins."</p>

<p>"How is poor master?" inquired Tops of the latter,
when they had re-entered the dining-room, where he
had remained with Susan.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of him! Don't inquire about him!"
she vociferated; "he deserves to die&mdash;that he does."</p>

<p>"Jest guv us a light for my pipe, mate, vill yer?"
said the broker's man. "Now I'll jest tell yer wot
my opinion of this 'ere job is. It's about the best
thing as could happen to your master that he is
ruinated entirely, 'cos he'll 'ave to vork for his livin',
and as I've vorked for my livin', vy, I knows pretty
vell wot it is. You're a pair of right-sorted vuns,
you air, and if your master vants any little think in
pertickler, vy the Downy vill be werry short-sighted
for vunce, seein' as how he knows vot misfortin' is.
This 'ere job ain't in my reg'lar line of bis'ness!"</p>

<p>"Ain't it now?" inquired Tops, with only partially 
aroused interest.</p>

<p>"No, it ain't," replied the Downy Cove; for the
dirty pale young man was no other than our old
acquaintance. "I'm 'put in 'ere special,' yer see.
Now supposin' you wos jest to fetch a pot of 'arf-and-'arf."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "I don't care if I do. You
don't seem 'arf a bad lot, you don't; considerin' the
herrand you're come on. I reckoned you and your
pal up, the hinstant you set foot in this house."</p>

<p>"Did yer, now?" said the other. "Vell, I

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

shouldn't a' thought it. I'm sure I'm werry much
obliged by your good hopinion." (To Susan.)
"Oughtn't I to be, my dear?"</p>

<p>Susan didn't notice the remark. She was thinking
at that moment, whether all her late mistress's little
nick-nacks, the screens she had painted, and the
chairs and ottomans she had worked, would be sold,
and into whose hands they might pass.</p>

<p>Tops nodded towards Susan, shook his head at the
Downy, pointed with his thumb in the direction of
his own left side, as much as to say, "Anything you
like, but no nonsense in that direction." "Her and
me," he thought fit to add aloud, "is a-keeping company 
together. You understand?"</p>

<p>The Downy looked a perfect encyclop&aelig;dia of intelligence 
at his new acquaintance. "Don't be afeard
of me," he said. "Bless you, I've knowed it this
'arf-hour. As for callin' any young creetur o' the
female secks, 'my dear,' it's a way I've got; cos
they're hall dear to me, hespecial them as is good-lookin'. 
But if you're a trifle pertickler, vy I'll put
the skid on to please yer, and be as sairymonious as
a Jew butcher, or a Lord Mayor's footman on Show
Day."</p>

<p>This speech appeared to afford perfect satisfaction
to Mr. Tops. As he said afterwards, he was not
afraid of any gentleman's attentions, especially in
that line of business; but he didn't choose any liberties
to be taken, if he could prevent it, which might
cause unpleasantness after. Had he observed the
proceedings of the Downy immediately after his
departure for the beer, it is probable that the unpleasantness 

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

would have preceded any effort at explanation 
that might have been attempted. For no
sooner had the door shut on Tops, than the "man in
possession" advanced close up to Susan, and said,
with a degree of familiarity, which deprived that
young lady of the power of remonstrance,</p>

<p>"I say, young woman, I've summut very pertickler
to say to you."</p>

<p>"Sir!" was all that she could get out.</p>

<p>"I've got horders," he continued, "to hintrust you
with a secret, vich I considers rayther a green haction
myself."</p>

<p>"I don't want any of your secrets, I'm sure,"
said Susan; "and I'll trouble you to keep them to
yourself."</p>

<p>"Then," responded the Downy, "you're a paragram 
of your secks, that's all. Now, don't be boltin'
away as if I was goin' to bite yer. I ain't got no
sich hintentions. Suppose," he said, lowering his
voice to a whisper, "suppose that this 'ere missus of
yourn ain't drownded at all, and vot's more is likely
to rekiver her blessed eyesight into the bargain."</p>

<p>Susan staggered, and would have fallen; but the
dirty pale young man caught her round the waist
with infinite dexterity. It was perhaps as well for
all parties that Tops did not return at that moment.
Susan, however, recovered and disengaged herself in
a very rapid manner.</p>

<p>"It is false," she cried. "You are jesting. You
shall be punished for this."</p>

<p>"Go on!" said the Downy; "keep it hup by
hall means. I'm used to it, I am; but perhaps you'll

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

listen to reason, afore that respectable young man,
whose acquaintance I'm proud on, comes back with
the beer."</p>

<p>"Did you say," cried Susan, "that my dear mistress, 
Mrs. Aubrey, is not drowned&mdash;not dead?"</p>

<p>"I tell yer, I ought to know," rejoined the Downy,
"for I took her out of the vorter last Satterday myself, 
vich haccounts for this 'ere cold I got. Vy,
I'm as hoarse as if I'd left the door and vinder vide
hopen hall night, and gone to bed in the hempty
fire-grate vith somebody else's vet umberella."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Susan, "where is she? Let me fly
to her!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Downy, "that's wot I'm a
comin' to. She's vell took care of; and don't mean
him, her husband, to know nothink at all, leastvays
for the present. But bless your bright eyes, we
knows wot that amounts to. Howsumever this 'ere
is her own vishes, and 'ere's the haddress."</p>

<p>"I will go to her instantly," cried Susan.</p>

<p>"Mind!" repeated the Downy. "Dark is the
vord! or you'll spile everythink!"</p>

<p>"And is she well, my dear angel mistress?" inquired 
Susan, as well as she could for sobbing.</p>

<p>"All serene!" replied the Downy; "that is, the
medical gent says she's out of hall danger. I see
her on the sofey in a dark room like; for she's took
the vorter-cure for blindness, vich it's a werry good
imitashun of a myrakle, accordin' to the sawbone's
own noshun. And she's kvite sensible, hall hexcept
in trustin' another voman vith the secret; for there's
vun of 'em in it halready. And a hout-and-hout

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

stunner she is, fit to make any cove poeticle. I honly
vish I wos a rich young nobilman for her sake, that's
wot I do." And the Downy gave vent to something
between a whistle and a sigh.</p>

<p>"Who can she be?" asked Susan. "What is her
name, do, pray tell me?"</p>

<p>"There you air, halready," said her informant.
"How should I know her name. Besides, that's not
in my hinstruckshuns. I knowed how it vould be."</p>

<p>"You may, indeed, trust me," said Susan. "Not
a word shall escape my lips. But, however did you
come in here?"</p>

<p>"Vy, hearin' as there was a hexecution agoin' to
be put in, I knowed some vun must 'ave the job,
you see, and vith the haid of my bankers and the
reekymendashun of Her Majesty's Ministers, the
dodge was heasy enough to the Downy. Do I look
like a man as vould disgrace his hancestry by such a
job, if it warn't on the special?"</p>

<p>At this moment Tops re-entered with a pot of beer
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered the Downy. "Not a vord
to him, till you've seen her."</p>

<p>Susan had no difficulty in beating her retreat, without 
exciting the suspicions of Tops in any way. There
was, indeed, nothing very remarkable in her agitated
appearance, considering that she had been in and out
of hysterics every hour or so ever since the disappearance 
of her mistress.</p>

<p>"Nice gal, yourn!" said the Downy, nodding
towards the door, as she shut it.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

<p>"Rare good un!" was the answer. "Take a
drain, mate!" and he handed the beer to the Downy.
The latter blew the froth dexterously into the fireplace, 
drank, and handed the pot to Tops, who took a
long pull in turn.</p>

<p>"I say, young fellow!" he asked, "wot's your
opinion of Socierty?"</p>

<p>"Is she a two-year-old filly?" was that worthy's
reply. "Don't know the 'oss."</p>

<p>"A werry spavined old hack, I should say," rejoined 
the Downy. "No! I means fashionerble folk,
and hall their surroundins&mdash;them as hangs out in
'ouses like this."</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied Mr. Tops, languidly, "that
it troubles me much to think about it. There was a
party 'ere, but he hooked it yesterday morning, as
would 'ave talked to you by the hour about things
of that sort. He was our guv'nor down below, and
I do believe he thought somethink of this kind was
goin' to 'appen. And it's jest as well he is an orf un,
for if he had chanced to open the door to your lot
this mornin', he'd 'ave had a fit, that's sartain. But
you're welcome to your say, jest as well as if he was
here."</p>

"My noshun is," said the Downy, as soon as he had
finished the beer, for which purpose he waited with
great politeness until the other had finished speaking,
"my noshun is that Socierty is a kind of huniwersal
plant among the nobs to make everythink uncomfortable, 
and as full of lies as a dog's back is of fleas.
And what's more aggrawatin' than Socierty, I should
like to know? Jest now I vanted to spit. D'yer

<!-- vol 2 page 291 -->

think I ha' wentured to ax that young 'ooman for a
spittoon? My eyes! vouldn't she ha' looked at me,
that's all? There's no sech thing in the hinwentory
of this 'ouse, I'll pound it. Now, bein' a genelman
as is hout of Socierty, I didn't take adwantage of my
persition and spit on this beewtiful carpet, acos I
ain't spiteful, and I cares for hothers as vell as
myself. Socierty is spiteful, though it don't demean
itself to spittoons, and is allers a spittin' on hother
people's carpets, and the more wallyable they is, the
more Socierty likes it, and, wot is more, it spits nasty
wenomous pison, instead of good wholesome tobacker
juice. How's yer master been haltogether like, since
the haccident, young man?"</p>

<p>"Quiet as a lamb, and don't say nothing to nobody,"
replied Tops; "and considering he havn't had so
much as a ounce of grub nor a drop of gruel for
three days and hover, it ain't so much to be wondered 
at."</p>

<p>"Socierty," replied the Downy, "said he had
been ravin' mad, and had broke hall the lookin'-glasses."</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Aubrey
himself appeared. He walked slowly, and apparently 
with difficulty. His eyes looked glazed and
feverish, and his face was as pale as death itself; but
he had made his toilet, and was dressed with care.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Tops. "Who would have
thought he was coming down, and we here too?"</p>

<p>The faithful fellow stepped back two or three paces,
and saluted his master in a very different fashion
from his usual off-hand style.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

<p>The latter said, very gravely, "Ah! Tops, my
good friend. Good day!" bowed to the Downy, and
passed on to a writing-table, where he sat down.</p>

<p>Tops, fully understanding that he was not required
to remain where he certainly had no business to be,
as quickly as possible shuffled, crab-like, out of the
room, and shut the door very carefully after him.</p>

<p>The Downy remained in the room; but retired to
the farthest possible corner, where he seated himself
in an arm-chair, and continued smoking with great
deliberation, until he apparently went to sleep quite
suddenly. It is more than probable that it occurred
to him all at once that smoking was not quite the
correct thing in that apartment.</p>

<p>For some minutes Aubrey remained deeply buried
in thought, with his head between his hands. At
length he looked up and around him with a semi-vacant 
stare, apparently unconscious of the presence
of any one in the room. Then he muttered to himself, 
and finally spoke aloud as follows:</p>

<p>"It was here," he said, "that she last sat. That
mirror reflected her pale, despairing face. Fool!
villain! madman! that I have been. And where is
she now&mdash;she so fond, so gifted, so impassioned? Oh,
Blanche!" (looking round) "ruined too! Ha, ha!
I am glad of it. There sits the bailiff in possession.
He sleeps. Let me look at him." He advanced
towards the Downy, and gazed at him awhile.
"How happy he seems! I wonder if he has a wife
at home, and is true to her!" Saying this, he walked
back to the other end of the room, and paused for
three or four minutes. "One short half-hour longer,

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

Blanche&mdash;nay, less than that, perhaps&mdash;and we had
been happy. I should never have deceived thee
again&mdash;never! never! And it is now too late&mdash;too 
late!" Here he pulled out a glove from his
breast. "I picked this up the night she left. It was
warm, as she will never be again. It has not yet
lost the mould of her delicate fingers. And they,
perchance, are clutched&mdash;filled with the slimy ooze
and black mud of the icy river, or stretched accusing
from the centre of some dank and marshy flat, towards 
Heaven, in mute witness of my dastardly desertion 
and idiotic cruelty! Why do I not go mad,
or die? It is too terrible to think of! It cannot,
cannot be!"</p>

<p>After a few minutes of silence, the Downy rubbed
his eyes, and looked up. He then approached Aubrey
on tip-toe.</p>

<p>"Guvernor!" he exclaimed. "Ahem!"</p>

<p>Aubrey looked up at him, but did not speak, or
resent the intrusion.</p>

<p>The Downy gave a kind of scrape, and continued:
"Werry sorry as I ain't allowed to make myself
scarce. Don't vish to hintrude. Can't help it."</p>

<p>"If it is any kindness to tell you so, my good
man," said Aubrey, "neither your presence nor your
mission affects me in the least."</p>

<p>The Downy looked at the wretched being before
him, and started. "This is enough to take a cove off
his beer, this is," he said to himself. "I'm blest if
it ain't the werry hidentical gent as guv me sech a
sight o' money for goin' a message not a fortnight
agone, the day I fell in vith hall that rum chapter of

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

accidinx. He's a real game un, arter hall, he is, and
if I hadn't sworn to that hangel in creenolean that
I vouldn't split, wotever come of this bis'ness, I'd
werry soon make his mind heasy. But there's no fear
but they'll be all right enough agen afore long. Vy
couldn't they settle it with a jolly good row and a
kivartern arterwards, like hordinary folks. But the
nobs don't 'ave it out in our fashion."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to say anything to me?" asked
Aubrey at last.</p>

<p>"Nothink pertickler, sir, at least novays nothink
sartain, acos vy, nothink is sartain; but if there's no
hoffence in vun like me a speakin' to a genelman
about wot don't consarn him, I should like to say a
vord or two, that's hall."</p>

<p>"Say anything you please," said Aubrey, "you
can't wound my feelings, were you to try, friend."</p>

<p>"Vell," said the Downy. "In course I've heerd
all about this 'ere bis'ness "&mdash;Aubrey started to his
feet&mdash;"and wot I've got to say is, that you're a
reckonin' of it hall up vithout hevidence, that's hall.
Vile there's life there's 'ope, and has for hall the
searchin' and draggin', there ain't nothink proved to
the contrairy; vy I'd live in 'ope if I wos in your
place, vich I means vithout hoffence on vun side or
t'other."</p>

<p>As he spoke Aubrey's face showed a variety of
emotions&mdash;anger, doubt, curiosity&mdash;and then relapsed
into a vacant stare.</p>

<p>"He means well," he muttered, and then clutching 
the Downy by the arm, he cried: "Tell me! do

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

you know anything, that makes you venture to say
this?"</p>

<p>How far the Downy would have been taken
aback by this sudden appeal remains a mystery unsolved. 
So deeply was the honest fellow impressed
with admiration of Aubrey's lavish generosity, and
pity for the agony under which every fibre of his
late benefactor's existence was evidently writhing,
that we are inclined to think he would have let out
the secret there and then, but for an interruption
which, either happily or unhappily, occurred at that
very moment.</p>

<p>"Arter all," as he subsequently reflected, "I never
knew no good come of meddlin' and tattlin'. She'll
come round soon enough, and it'll give him a lesson, I
dessay, as'll keep him on the keyviet for many a long
day to come. Pr'aps I should spile hall by hinterferin'
vith her little game."</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the Downy did not reveal
the secret of Blanche's rescue.</p>

<p>The interruption which stopped any further revelations 
on the part of the Downy, at least for a time,
was the sudden entrance of a most vulgar apparition, 
without any premonitory knock or warning.
Apparition, said we; it was the substantial identity
of Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens's clerk, Mr. Snap,
who, with his hat partly cocked on one side of the
shiny and pomatumed pimple which he called his head,
advanced straight up to Aubrey, who resumed his
seat with an expression of pain and exhaustion, and
looked at him inquiringly without a word.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 296 -->

<p>"Ahem! ahem!" barked the little lawyer's clerk.
"I come from Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens. Mr.
Grinderby said I was to bring a hanswer."</p>

<p>And he threw down a thick sealed packet on the
table before Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I am unwell, sir," said the latter, with an air of
languor, "and at present you must excuse me. You
can leave the papers, to which I will attend as soon
as I am able."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grinderby said I was not to come away without 
a hanswer," rejoined Snap, in a rude tone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grinderby," replied Aubrey, "can hardly be
aware&mdash;&mdash; Pray tell him that I am ill. Good morning, 
sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! I ain't in no particular hurry. I'll take a
seat, till you're ready," rejoined Mr. Snap; as if he
had been addressing a decayed law-writer, whose
work was overdue.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Aubrey, haughtily, "this rudeness can
scarcely be premeditated. Must I repeat to you that
I am ill&mdash;suffering affliction? To be short" (sternly)
"I must request you to withdraw."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grinderby," reiterated the clerk, "said I was
not to go back without a hanswer."</p>

<p>"The matter must be pressing, indeed," said
Aubrey, wearily. "I will open your parcel."</p>

<p>And he accordingly tore open the envelope, and
read a letter enclosed within, as follows:</p>

<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>

"We beg to enclose you our balance of bill of costs,
extending, as you will perceive, over a period of four

<!-- vol 2 page 297 -->

years, and, as the firm has heavy expenses to meet,
request your immediate settlement of the same.</p>

<p class="right">"We are, dear sir,<br/>

"Your obedient servants,<br/>

"GRINDERBY AND COUSENS.</p>

<p>"P.S. On the other side we beg to annex copy of
letter just received from mortgagee's solicitor, and
advise you that unless you at once pay the amount,
immediate foreclosure will take place. What answer
are we to make?"</p>

<p>"What! the interest on the mortgage not paid?
I never heard a word of this?"</p>

<p>As Aubrey uttered these words, Mr. Snap indulged
in a little feat of whistling, accompanied by sundry
kicks against the leg of the table, on the corner of
which he had perched himself.</p>

<p>Aubrey, without noticing him, tore open the bill
of costs. "Balance!" he said, "three thousand four
hundred and seventy-five pounds six shillings and
eightpence halfpenny! Impossible! Pray, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clerk continued his musical performance, not
seeming to hear that he was addressed.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, sir?" said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I should think I did," was the answer. "I ain't
deaf." And he took up a photographic album from
the table, and began carelessly to turn over the pages.
As he did so a portrait fell out.</p>

<p>"Insolent rascal!" cried Aubrey. "How dare you
pollute that book with your touch?"</p>

<p>"Well I'm sure," cried Mr. Snap, "we air proud,

<!-- vol 2 page 298 -->

with a broker's man, too, in possession. Why the
book ain't yours, no more than it's mine, which it is
perhaps in right of my governors. What am I to say
to Mr. Grinderby?"</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" shouted Aubrey, seizing him by
the throat, and shaking him with violence till with
one effort he flung him reeling half across the room,
where he fell close at the feet of the Downy, who
could not resist the temptation of a slight accidental
kick.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" bellowed Snap. "Help! I call you
to witness. He said 'scoundrel!' It's actionable,
besides the assault. I'm bruised all over. I take you
to witness that he has torn my shirt, and I've lost a
stud."</p>

<p>"Tell your master," said Aubrey, "that, were he
somewhat less base than he is, I would lash him
within an inch of his life. Tell him that if he stole a
handkerchief from a hedge, he would be transported
as he deserves&mdash;ay, fifty times more than the petty
thief who preys not on friend or client, but on Society,
that spurns him from its breast. Tell him and his
partner in iniquity, that not even contempt shall
save them, if they dare to annoy me by other means
than the law affords them, its meanest and most
wretched instruments. Tell them&mdash;but I waste words
on them, and on you." As he said this he cast a
glance of scorn on the still semi-prostrate Snap, and
left the room.</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! yah!" cried that personage, as he
gathered himself up. "Who are you? Beggar!
pauper! yah!" and he was about to execute a little

<!-- vol 2 page 299 -->

war-dance of defiance, when an unexpected assailant
gave him pause. This was no other than the Downy,
who suddenly advanced upon him in a pugilistic
attitude with a succession of the most approved
feints. Mr. Snap retreated rather more quickly than
the other took ground, and gained the door, out of
which he made a most unceremonious exit, thereby
escaping a kick, about the intention of which there
was no nonsense, but which just fell short of the
clerk's retreating figure.</p>

<p>"He was never nearer Chancery in his life, I
reckon," quoth the Downy. "Blest if ever I keeps
a running account with <i>my</i> fammerly solicitor agen."
And he seated himself in his arm-chair again, and
relighting his pipe, puffed the smoke towards the ceiling 
in an attitude of contemplation and reflection.</p>

<div class="center" id="v2ch17">

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">SIR HARRY LUCKLESS'S LUCK.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">With the exception of the <i>genus</i> Testamentary, there is no body or
class of persons in the world about whose approval or good opinion a
man need care so little as that of his own relations, except, perhaps,
those of his wife. If he is prosperous, he does not want them, although
they may him, which does not prevent, though it may conceal and
check all the envy and malice which his prosperity, especially if
coupled with merit, inspires so pre-eminently in their breasts. If he
is needy, their mildest form of malignity and disgust is to disown him
entirely, and to ignore his existence. If he is winning fame, they speak
of him with derision and contempt; if he has won it, they are the last
to yield to what "all the world" has said. If you are eccentric, a relation 
takes out a commission of lunacy against you; if you don't require
it, he sends you baskets of game; if you are in trouble, he disowns you,
and furnishes the public with the history of your early indiscretions
and bad traits. He is a perpetual witness against your character; and
if you have cut him all your life, he intrudes himself at your funeral,
if he deems it due to propriety, or imagines you have anything to
leave. And frequently the moral intimidation exercised by the mere
existence of relations prevents a man from following his own bent, and
he sacrifices his happiness on the barren and lugubrious altar of family
pride.&mdash;<i>From the Note-book of Solomon Trustall, Esq., LL.D</i>.</p>

<p>ON a sofa in the back drawing-room of a small
but genteel house in Ebury-street, Pimlico, reclined
the victim of Aubrey's weakness and wickedness,
lately rescued from a suicidal doom. The apartment
was partially darkened, and as she lay motionless,
with closed eyelids, and clasped hands, her long dark

<!-- vol 2 page 301 -->

hair streaming on either side of her, and making her
face seem more ghostly pale, and her white dress
more white by the contrast, she looked not unlike
the monumental effigy of a recumbent queen in some
old cathedral nook or corner. Blanche Aubrey had
indeed passed through the Valley of the Shadow of
Death. Deeply was her conscience impressed with
the awful nature of the crime, from the commission
of which she had been snatched in so wonderful a
manner. The violence of her late excitement was
subdued and toned down to melancholy. It seemed
to her, as if a long period had elapsed since she left
home. She seemed to be born to new ideas, new
reflections on life. She felt the utmost indignation,
not unmingled with scorn, for the conduct of her
husband. But it was something she did not wish to
think of, and she sought studiously to banish it from
her mind. This was, perhaps, but an effort at mental
self-deception, as in reality she thought of nothing or
very little else; yet the very exercise was insensibly
doing her good. Before her attempt at suicide, she
had no idea, no instinct of resistance&mdash;now she had a
mixed feeling of resentment, disgust, wounded dignity,
and a vague desire to "live to see him repent it,"
as the phrase is. Again, wonderful to relate, her eyesight 
had been almost miraculously restored! From
the first, her loss of sight had puzzled the faculty.
There was no cataract, no blemish, no apparent disease
in her eyes. The affection appeared to be a nervous
one, and one of the most eminent doctors had declared 
that her sight might be restored any hour, as
mysteriously as it had failed. The very day after

<!-- vol 2 page 302 -->

her rescue from the death she had sought after, she
became conscious of a limited power of vision, accompanied 
by excruciating pains, when the light reached
her eyes. From that time&mdash;about ten days had
now elapsed since her plunge into the river&mdash;the improvement 
had been rapid, and the medical man
called in by Kate Dareall declared that he entertained 
no doubt of her ultimate and total recovery.
The worthy doctor did not know all; and yet he had
discovered a fact which no one else had suspected,
and which very much influenced the judgment which
he pronounced. He had been simply told that she
was a married woman separated from her husband
by reason of his misconduct, that she had been blind
for some months, and had undergone a great mental
and physical shock. Dr. Miller was one of those
first-rate men who never emerge from comparative
professional obscurity, either owing to want of opportunity, 
or the absence of all humbug and self-assertion. 
Had he been suddenly called upon to
display his vast knowledge and power of applying it
in some celebrated case, his fortune would have been
made. As it was, he had a small practice, and it
often fell to his lot to do duty for the busy neighbouring 
medical men, who knew his skill, talents,
unassuming character, and strictly honourable conduct. 
Let it not be thought that Dr. Miller wanted
practice. No, he had plenty of that among the
poor. As he would say smilingly to his wife, he
had as many, if not more, "paid," than paying
patients. He would rise and dress as rapidly at the
call of a cabman's wife, as he would have done at the

<!-- vol 2 page 303 -->

summons of an archbishop's lady. He was a bad
hand at making out a bill, or sending it in; and
when sometimes a poor but honest patient would
timidly offer him his fee, he would return it like a
blessing, replacing it in the hand that gave it, which
he would close with both of his, saying with a gentle
smile, "No, not this time, thank you! I think we
must get out of town for a day or two, eh? Let me
feel your pulse again," or some such words, thereby
changing the conversation, and avoiding thanks.
Moreover, the doctor had occasion to prescribe a great
deal of good port wine with his bark and other tonics;
and as his patients were not port wine drinkers, and,
consequently, were not likely to get "good" port
wine, the doctor would frequently insist upon furnishing 
his own prescriptions.</p>

<p>"My dear lady!" he said once to a poor creature,
who had known better days, and who muttered something 
about its being too expensive, "expense is not
the question, the difficulty is to get it good at any
price in these days; and, by-the-bye, singularly
enough, I have a little stock at my disposal, which
I am enjoined by a gouty patient, who must not
drink it himself, to place at the service of my other
patients who can; and I can't do better than send
you half a dozen of it immediately I get home."</p>

<p>The poor lady began to cry. She read the kind-hearted 
fiction at a glance.</p>

<p>"Hoot, hoot! ma'am, this won't do," replies the
doctor. "I didn't prescribe water with that port wine.
Must stop this sort of thing. It's a very dry wine,
I assure you&mdash;won't bear water. I never could

<!-- vol 2 page 304 -->

endure tears; won't come again, ma'am, if you
cry; bad compliment to my treatment! must go and
see Toole at the play." And he then dexterously
got into a description of the last piece at the Adelphi
Theatre.</p>

<p>Such was Dr. Miller, of Middle Belgrave-street,
Belgravia, though his practice lay in Pimlico, as he
often told Mrs. Miller. As he had no family, he
could afford these eccentricities, by means of his other
"practice," which was that of strict economy.</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>ever</i> get out of town yourself, doctor?"
said a gentleman of his acquaintance once.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he said, "I was telegraphed for last
summer all the way from Gravesend. It was one of
the most distinguished incidents of my professional
career."</p>

<p>On the memorable night when Blanche disappeared 
from the fashionable world and her own
domestic circle, and very nearly from this sublunary
scene altogether, Miss Dareall had conveyed her,
after a brief council with Sir Harry, to the apartments 
of Sir Harry Luckless, in Duke-street, St.
James's, which he surrendered for the occasion, and
where the actress sat up with her all night. Sir
Harry brought in Dr. Miller, whose admirable character 
Miss Dareall knew, through a friend of hers.
Neither Sir Harry nor Kitty, as we will for the present
call her, thought of restoring Mrs. Aubrey to her
home, until she should be in a state to decide for
herself. They knew too well the reason of her rash
act. The next morning Blanche declared her positive
intention never to return home again. Whilst she

<!-- vol 2 page 305 -->

slept, under the influence of some soothing anodyne administered 
by the doctor, Kitty betook herself to her
own abode, and thence to a costumier, and reappeared
in an eccentric and dismal garb, very unlike that
which she had worn on the previous evening. She
then despatched Sir Harry to find apartments, which
he very soon did; and, as soon as it got dark the
next evening, our new Sister of Charity, aided by Sir
Harry, tenderly assisted poor homeless Blanche into
a cab, and drove to the retreat they had provided.
When the affair of the supposed suicide first got
into the papers, without names, Miss Dareall and
Sir Harry agreed to endeavour to persuade Mrs.
Aubrey to return to her home, or at least communicate 
with her husband, in time to avoid the
full development of the scandal. But they found
they might as well talk to a marble "Italy," or
any other statue expressing griefs and wrongs. She
thanked her kind friends, to whom she said she
would not be a burden long. She knew the full
consequences of the step she had taken, and was
deeply conscious of the offence she had committed
in the eyes of Heaven; but rather than return to
her husband's roof, she would repeat it. On these
occasions she became so alarmingly agitated, that after
two or three attempts made by Kitty, they judged
it fit not to press the matter further, at least for the
present. During the next four or five days the whole
matter got fully into the newspapers, names and all,
and Aubrey's difficulties were the subject of common
conversation.</p>

<p>Blanche said little&mdash;whatever she might have felt&mdash;at 

<!-- vol 2 page 306 -->

hearing of her husband's threatened ruin. "Ah!"
she observed, "he will miss me now!" And that
was the whole expression of her concern. She inquired, 
however, after Susan with some interest:
and when Kitty proposed to bring her to see her,
under the strictest bond of secrecy, she did not object. 
Consequently, the Downy was intrusted with
that delicate mission, and we have seen how he performed 
it. On Susan's appearance, Blanche never
said a word about her husband. She hoped that her
birds would be fed and cared for; and seemed pleased
when Susan told her that Mr. Aubrey had behaved
very liberally to an old pensioner, who was accustomed 
to call for a weekly dole, and who had called,
and was terribly shocked to hear of the disappearance 
of her kind patroness. With the selfishness&mdash;let 
us rather say the bitter necessity of extreme age
and poverty&mdash;the old woman mingled in her sad
"wirrasthrue" the thought of her own sudden deprivation 
of means. Mr. Aubrey, who had taken to
wandering about the house without any precise object,
heard her loud wailing, and called her into the library,
and talked with her, as he had done with no other
person since his loss; and on her getting up, shaking
with palsy and excitement, with her rusty black
bonnet-ribbons damp with tears, he placed a twenty-pound 
note in her meagre old talons, and told her
that Mr. Binsby would get it changed for her, apparently 
quite forgetful of the departure of that
worthy. "Yes, yes," cried Blanche, "he could be
kind and considerate to every one save me."</p>

<p>When Susan arrived, and, after a brief disappearance, 

<!-- vol 2 page 307 -->

reappeared with her boxes, having requested 
Mr. Aubrey to allow her to leave suddenly
on the plea of nervous inability to remain, refusing
at the same time to accept anything beyond the
balance of her bare wages to that day, Kitty began
to relax in her attendance, and for two days previous
to the day on which the events took place which we
are now describing, and about to describe, she had not
looked in at all. In fact, Susan had barely, as she
called it, "had a single spy at her." Of course, the
attached waiting-woman was much prepossessed in
the strange lady's favour; although she appeared in a
costume which she couldn't "abear," encouraged no
conversation, preferred speaking to her mistress
alone, and altogether glided about "as mysterious
and unsatisfactory as a ghostess." Amongst other
things, it very speedily occurred to Blanche, that she
was utterly unprovided with money. Sir Harry had,
of course, been entirely kept out of the way, and,
indeed, it must be said to his honour, that he had
manifested no sort of inclination to intrude himself.
As to the romantic passion for Mrs. Aubrey which
he had confided to Kitty, it seemed to have evaporated 
in the most satisfactory manner. The fact is,
it had never really existed, save in fancy; for Sir
Harry had mistaken sympathy and admiration for
love, and from the moment that he saw Blanche in
that miserable situation, pity had usurped the place
of every other feeling.</p>

<p>It was to Miss Dareall that Blanche was indebted
for the trifling expenses which she had already incurred, 
including a slender outfit of clothes and the

<!-- vol 2 page 308 -->

moderate bill of the doctor. But this was a state of
things which manifestly could not last; and already
Kitty had experienced some difficulty in reconciling
her patient and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e to the acceptance of a bounty,
which the former pretended came out of some charitable 
and religious trust-fund, with which she was
connected as dispenser. In vain did Sir Harry press
Kitty to allow him the pleasure of furnishing the
present means to enable Blanche to carry out her
intentions. Concerning this he and the actress had
many little friendly arguments and disputes. On
one of these occasions, Kitty referred to his declared
passion for the lady.</p>

<p>"Ah, now!" he observed to her; "I could not
have known what I was saying; for much as I
respect and admire her, and sorry as I am for her
sad situation, there's no love at all in the matter. I
like you better than any one in the world, I do
believe," he added; "for there isn't a thing in the
world I wouldn't do for you, and I'm never happy
the day I don't see you."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Kitty, arranging her bonnet-strings 
in the glass of a little fancy screen on the
chimney-piece, "how affectionate you are becoming!
You'll be wanting to marry me next."</p>

<p>"Faith! and so I would!" he said, "if it wasn't
for my relations. But what would the world say,
my darling?"</p>

<p>Miss Dareall made no reply. It would seem that
her bonnet-strings were very obstinate at that moment. 
Sir Harry did not notice how pale her face
looked, as she turned round and said gaily, "Well, I

<!-- vol 2 page 309 -->

suppose I must have that silly old Chalkstoneville
after all. I shall cut your acquaintance then, and all
your friends into the bargain, and take to visiting
the poor, and patronising pet parsons. What a dear,
old respectable duchess I shall make. Why you
don't think I should be such a fool as to have you,
do you?"&mdash;and she laughed harshly&mdash;"if all your
precious relations were to go on their knees to me
together, like the maimed, halt, and blind beggars in
a French Catholic church, where the poor and old
alone act the part of the devout. Ha! ha! But
what <i>could</i> the world say that would injure your
character?" It was Sir Harry's turn now to grow
pale with anger, and fear&mdash;fear of having given
offence to Kitty, and anger at her remark. But that
young lady hummed a tune, and gave him her arm
quite gaily. "Come!" she said, "I want you to
escort me to Pimlico, but mind and steer clear of
your relations. They are not a very moral lot, are
they? and won't deprive you of their valuable countenance 
for flirting and walking with an actress, so
long as you are not in danger of marrying her? Ha!
ha! my poor Harry! <i>I'll</i> protect you. I'll take
care you don't forget yourself; or if you do, I promise
at least not to take advantage of your rashness."</p>

<p>Sir Harry tried to respond in a similar vein; but
the attempt was a failure. He felt that he had made
a mistake, and did not know how to rectify it. Two
or three times in the course of that walk, and several
times after, whilst he continued on familiar terms
with Kitty, he very nearly made up his mind to set
his relations and the world at defiance, and ask her

<!-- vol 2 page 310 -->

plainly if she would become Lady Luckless. And,
had it not been for his debts and difficulties, he would
certainly have done it; but this weighed him down,
and kept him silent.</p>

<p>"If I'd only come into the Kiltroon and Bogmahony 
property, I'd do it in a moment," he said
to himself. "But I can't ask her to marry a bare
title, and perhaps have to come and visit me in
Whitecross-street, and be searched at the door to see
if she was carrying any whisky to her needy Irish
husband. No, that wouldn't do at all, at all."</p>

<p>Somehow or other, from the day of that unfortunate 
conversation with Kitty, the intimacy between
them decreased. Sometimes, she was out at unaccustomed 
hours, and left no message for Sir Harry
to follow her. Sometimes, she was surrounded by
adorers, and made no distinction, as heretofore, in
his favour. And, at last, she actually was denied to
him, though he could hear the sound of her laughter
up-stairs. Poor Sir Harry! he could have fairly
cried with vexation, as he turned from the door, and
remembered his fatal speech about his relations; for
not one of whom he cared a pin, nor with one of
whom was he on friendly terms. He felt as if he
could have called them all out, i.e., the males, and
shot them one by one with the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I've offended her pride, and she will never
forgive me," he said. Alas! if Kitty could have
known what he felt at that moment. But with all
her acuteness and wonderful instinct, that was exactly
what she did not know. So she flirted with the
Duke of Chalkstoneville, with an aching head and

<!-- vol 2 page 311 -->

heart, and gradually banished Sir Harry from her
door with unflinching resolution, not through pride
or anger, but out of regard to her own saddened
feelings, into which a higher and nobler consideration
entered largely.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "he was right. How could he
ally his name and fate with one like me? I might,
perhaps, marry him, if I continued to encourage
his attentions; for I believe he loves me a little.
But I love him too well to degrade him by such an
alliance."</p>

<p>At that very instant the object of her thoughts was
indulging in a day-dream of emigration, in which the
cultivation of a farm in Nova Scotia, and the management 
of a sheep-walk in Australia, engaged his
preference by turns. But over both the same Divinity
presided, and both the North American and Australian 
Egeria wore the <i>espi&egrave;gle</i> expression of Kitty
Dareall in her sunniest and happiest moments. Sir
Harry was an excellent farmer and stock-breeder
spoilt. Such a career is certainly preferable to one
phase of human existence in this world, and that
is the worthless, godless, loveless and useless existence 
of an idle man on town, that <i>Βίος αβίωτος</i>
of the Greek moralist which fools call <i>par excellence</i>
"life."</p>

<p>We may here observe that whilst it is sufficiently
evident that two persons could hardly have been found
even as partners in a modern wedding more utterly
unsuited to each other than Blanche and Sir Harry,
between whom there was no link of tastes, habits,
thoughts, and feelings, it is by no means so apparent

<!-- vol 2 page 312 -->

that a match between Kitty and that reckless young
Irishman would not have been productive of mutual
happiness. They both hated all the common proprieties, 
conventionalities, and ceremonies of social
domestic life. They were neither of them in the
least degree regular in any one thing; not even in
that most important matter of human consideration,
the hours of dinner, lunch, breakfast, or supper. Then,
they were both fond of dogs and horses, and out-door
exercises. As for Kitty, though, at that period, she
undoubtedly set the chief fashions of dress in London,
she would have been perfectly happy to get up at
four o'clock in the morning to go duck-shooting in the
winter, or to preside over a haymaking party in the
dog-days, without the slightest concern for her complexion. 
She knew the Stud Book and the Racing
Calendar better than Sir Harry himself, though he
would sit smoking and poring over them for hours;
moreover, he had a most profound reverence for her
genius, and believed there never had been another
such a woman in the world; whilst she felt that perfect
ease in his presence, and comfort in his society, which
she had never experienced in that of any other human
being. The fact is, that Sir Harry was the best-natured
fellow imaginable, and there wasn't such a thing as an
<i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i> in his whole composition. Lastly, she
liked him better than any one whom she had ever
met. Had Sir Harry told any one of his associates
that he was in love with Kitty, whatever else such a one
might have thought of it, he would have deemed it the
most natural thing in the world. On the other hand,
had he seriously imparted his secret passion for

<!-- vol 2 page 313 -->

Blanche, as he did to Kate, to the best friend he had
in the world, that friend would have laughed outright
in his face, just as if he had avowed a hopeless attachment 
to one of the Royal Family, or to the incarnation 
of charity and feminine heroism who shares the
Imperial throne of France. It was not in the "eternal
fitness of things," to use an American expression,
that Sir Harry should adore Mrs. Aubrey; it was
that he should be "sweet" on Kitty Dareall. But
somehow Sir Harry did not see how the matter really
lay at first, himself. He wanted to shoot Aubrey,
partly for his cruel treatment of his wife, and partly,
had he analysed his own feelings, on account of his
pretensions to Miss Dareall; and he thought he must
be in love with the injured wife, whom he panted,
with all the peculiar chivalry of the Lucklesses, to
avenge. There was a great deal of simplicity in Sir
Harry's character. He was just sufficiently educated
to pass current as a gentleman; but books and polite
information were by no means his forte. He was, however, 
an accomplished sportsman, danced "like an
angel," had an elegant figure, and a handsome, naturally 
rakish-looking face. When you were most inclined 
to be angry with him for some Celtic blunder,
or gross instance of unpunctuality, for which latter
quality he was so noted, that some one said of him, he
could not even have been born at the time expected,
there was something in the tone of his voice, and the
look of his blue eyes, that disarmed you of all resentment. 
Sir Harry had been a victim in his time to many
a designing rogue; but his good-natured, easy credulity
was as great as ever. He had, however, the strongest

<!-- vol 2 page 314 -->

aversion to lawyers, and everything connected with
the execution of the law. His whole sympathies were
with debtors and not creditors. He would have shot
a bum-bailiff without any remorse, or a registrar of
the Sheriff's Court, or "any such blackguard," as
he would have called that necessary functionary, with
positive delight. His father and grandfather had
been great duellists in their day, and the latter had
challenged the former, and posted him as a coward
for not fighting his own father!</p>

<p>Such was the stock from which Sir Hany Luckless 
came, and if he was not a man of business it is
hardly to be wondered at. He inherited the famous
saw-handles and all the taste of his ancestors for
polite duelling, with a remarkable tenderness of heart
and a gentle disposition, which caused but few to
suspect what a hero at ten paces was lost, owing to the
degenerate manners of the age, in that effeminate-looking 
young man, whose career remained, perforce,
unembellished with a single "affair." Had he known
the state of his own heart, we suspect he would have
discovered there a considerable amount of devotion
to Miss Dareall about that time, and certainly, as we
have more than hinted, he was by no means indifferent 
to that eccentric young lady. But Sir Harry
was famous for never knowing anything very correctly, 
not immediately connected with dogs, horses,
the "Racing Calendar," and field sports, and consequently 
he did not become aware of the depth of
affection of which he was capable, until the opportunity 
was lost. But we must not anticipate our
tale.</p>

<p>A very pitiful lady, very young,<br/>

Exceeding rich in human sympathies,<br/>

Stood by, what time I clamoured upon Death;<br/>

And at the wild words wandering on my tongue,<br/>

And at the piteous look within mine eyes<br/>

<p class="right"><i>La Vita Nuova. Translated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>WE left Blanche lying on a sofa in the small dark
back drawing-room in Ebury-street, Pimlico. Sad and
tender fancies were chased in succession through her
brain by bitter and resentful thoughts, like wounded
deer pursued by fierce wolves or relentless hounds.
All the dread reality of her hopeless position occupied
her mind. What should she do&mdash;how repay her
kind benefactress? Yes, she must again eat the
bitterest bread of servitude, that which is earned by
the educated and intellectual poor from the sordid
and soulless rich. She shuddered as she thought of
the Grimshaw family, and what she had endured at
their place. Poor Blanche recalled her happiness in
leaving that abode with Lady Courcy, a beloved and
blooming <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, soon to be the bride of the man
whom she worshipped with all the fervour of a virgin

<!-- vol 2 page 316 -->

heart. Surely never was so bright a prospect darkened,
clouded, and ruined, and in so short a time! And for
what and how? Not by the stern mandate of Death.
If worldly ruin had come to her husband, it had
come self-sought; and had he been stripped of everything 
in the world, would that have destroyed her
happiness, her love? No! As it was, he had
simply ceased to love her, and shown it with every
aggravation of insult and contempt. Why had he
sought out and wooed her, to deal with her thus?
And now, with shattered and enfeebled frame, and
without hope, she must begin that fearful struggle
again. Moreover, she had another anxiety, another
drawback; one that would interfere with her wherever
she went. The blessing she had once so earnestly
prayed for, had arrived, changed by circumstances
into a curse. Poor Blanche! There are thousands in
this world who have felt all that you did, and more&mdash;the 
victims of pitiless circumstance and chance.
As we write, what stories we could unfold! What
fair women are trodden down in the mud and mire
of the world&mdash;what noble men struggle and starve
and die; unpitied, save by those who cannot aid them.
If their circumstances were only known to the rich
and idle&mdash;but they cannot be! This is called in
modern mechanical slang getting "out of the grooves."
This is a mechanical age, and there are not sufficient
grooves for all, at least in England under the legislation 
of our political economists, who have knowledge
but no wisdom. Of the numbers "out of the grooves"
in this, and we suppose in every "civilised" country,
we pity most those who can boast many rich relations: 

<!-- vol 2 page 317 -->

because the latter are careful not to let them
starve or die without an ill word. They say of such
a one, that it is no wonder he has come to a sad end,
and of another who has battled hard with destiny,
that no one could have expected it to be otherwise.</p>

<p>Poor Blanche! It is indeed a hard fate to have
known prosperity, and to have remained unspoilt by
it, and to be suddenly thrown again upon your own
resources to earn the crust of dependence, or to
starve. At this moment, how many share your fate,
with even less power, less chance, and less experience
than yours? How many widows and orphans of brave
soldiers who have died for their country, have been
mercilessly plunged into ruin by the machinations of
scoundrels, who laugh at the impotency of our laws
to punish them, and triumph in the reluctance of
Society to reject them, or to cast them forth, because
they are rich? Some of these malefactors may even
have purchased seats in Parliament with a portion
of the proceeds of their plunder. They, at any rate,
are not very likely to legislate against the financial
speculator, the fraudulent director, or the religious
contractor, who has ruined thousands and made himself 
safe. Blanche Aubrey was not thus cast upon
the world. She was the victim of one man's folly
and perfidy. She had known poverty before; but it
was when she had hope, and heart, and youth. She
was still young in years; but she had undergone a
mental and physical blight.</p>

<p>Still something, she felt, must be done. She did
not fear toil in one sense; because she had now
nothing more to fear. She had endured all; yea, even

<!-- vol 2 page 318 -->

to the bitterness of death. So she thought of all things
she could do, or might do&mdash;she would advertise in the
newspapers. Yes, she would ask her kind friend and
protectress to do that for her, and perhaps, ere very
long, she might be able to repay all. Since she had
been there, every luxury had been supplied to her
with a lavish hand&mdash;fruit, flowers, even a piano had
been sent in&mdash;all this very much against her will, and
her entreaty that no expense which could be spared,
should be incurred. Yes, she would consult her and
ask her to advertise, not for a situation as a governess
or companion, but for pupils. She would teach
music, vocal and instrumental. What if she were
recognised as Mrs. Aubrey! She would disguise
herself, cut off and dye her hair, and in the plain unbecoming 
dress she would wear, she trusted none
would know her. Oh! if she could only go abroad,
or even to some provincial town, and thus avoid the
terrible ordeal of revisiting places and seeing persons
familiar to her during her brief career of fashion.
Amidst all this, was not Blanche grateful to Providence 
for the restoration of her sight? How had she
welcomed that inestimable boon? Yes, on her knees
she had thanked the Almighty for His gracious mercy.
Her restored vision had been baptised with tears of
gratitude and thankfulness to Heaven. She had
even reproached herself for the want of the extreme
joyous fervour with which such a blessing should
have been received. Without it, she must have
been lost&mdash;must have lived in abject misery during
the short time she would have burdened the world,
supported by some public charity, an inmate, perhaps, 

<!-- vol 2 page 319 -->

of the workhouse. It was too terrible to
think of. But out of that great and unexpected
mercy, no art of which she was mistress could
conjure a thought of happiness, a dream of joy.
Thus lost in sad reflection lay Blanche, gazing almost
as blindly on the ceiling, through her eyes ever and
anon suffused by tears, as when she was deprived of
actual sight. There are geysers in Iceland, that isle
of wondrous phenomena, deep and sullen shafts piercing 
the bowels of the earth, which are dead and silent
when unprovoked and unchallenged by the curious
traveller or idle passer-by. Let, however, only a
pebble or a bit of wood be flung into the mysterious
depth, and then far down a troubled groaning, like
the throes of some mortal agony, is heard, until ere
long the boiling torrent surges forth, and scalds and
blisters all within the reach of its spray. Thus it is
with the buried existence of a great and hidden grief.
The slightest token, the most trifling memorial,
awakens all its violence. A sound, a scent, a dead
leaf, a written scrap, a chance word, an unbidden
thought, and the secret springs of sorrow are touched.
Then the long sigh and the convulsive sob, the thrill
of agony, the suppressed shriek of a quickened remembrance, 
until the fountains of visible tears fill
and overflow, and the pent-up feelings of misery are
relieved. At length the heaving bosom subsides, the
chords and sinews of contention slacken, and the exhausted 
frame sinks into forgetfulness and rests for
awhile, until some new and possibly trifling event
creates at once the remembrance, the agony, and the
relief.</p>

<p>Blanche had thought and wept, and wept and
thought, until she had fairly exhausted herself, and
her eyelids closed in sleep. We are fond of alluding 
to the dreams of the actors and actresses in this
drama of real life. He who at some time in his existence 
has not bent with trembling and reverential
wonder before the ivory portals of Dreamland, is a
man of figs or figures, with a soul worthy of a grocer,
and the imagination of a petty arithmetician. He
has no romance, no poetry in his composition; nor
has he been the hero of adventure, nor the toy of
fate. A romantic soul is as necessary for the experience 
of adventure as a plodding disposition for
the small felicities of a retail trade. It is as inherent
in one man to meet with strange events, as in another
to do common things. Thus a man's temperament
is in one sense the creator, not the moulder of his
fate. We do not profess an absolute belief in supernatural 
visitations, nor do we withhold our belief.
And why should we withhold it, since we can account
for nothing? All our wisdom cannot fathom the instincts 
of a savage, nor gauge the sagacity of a dog.
Everything is a phenomenon, if rightly considered.
We can preach sermons on life and death, philosophise 
on a cabbage, and distil the rose's scent; we
have our Polytechnic Institution, our Rosse's telescope, 
our Pharaoh's serpents, and we can resolve
mortality into its chemical components. But we
cannot see before the cradle or beyond the grave.
Our vision opens on the firmament in which we
measure the distances of the stars; we tread on a
round globe, and shoot electric sparks of conversation

<!-- vol 2 page 321 -->

under the ocean that divides the land, over the mountains 
and valleys of the once populous Atlantic, of
which a dim and confused tradition remains; but we
live between two curtains, two veils, which no mental
projectile has penetrated, and which no mortal eye
has pierced&mdash;the veil of birth and the veil of death&mdash;clouds 
that have never rolled aside at the bidding
of any enchanter's wand, before which the imagination 
of a thousand mortal ages has sunk confused
and baffled, died and lived, and lived and died again,
as wise as yesterday and the day before, no wiser to-morrow 
perchance; but of this none can predicate&mdash;for 
if we could, we might know all. "Give me a
fulcrum," said the great old materialist, Archimedes,
"and I will place a lever that shall move the world."
"Grant me a single premise," says the latest metaphysician, 
"and I will account for all." If eternity
be a truth, there is no beginning, and can be no time.
For if we start from beyond a beginning, the beginning 
can never be overtaken even in thought.</p>

<p>All this commonplace&mdash;for we do not affect the
shallow incomprehensibility of the great philosophers
of the age&mdash;has arisen out of our suggestion that the
dreams of sleep may have a connexion and a purpose
in relation with our one great waking dream. That
the supernatural or transnatural dream is of rare
occurrence, proves nothing against our theory or supposition. 
For after all, it does not amount to a
theory, which would infer a mathematical basis or
support. We only start a fact. Let others shoot
and stuff it, or cook and swallow it, if they please.
There are gross and common dreams, if anything is

<!-- vol 2 page 322 -->

common; for even an onion is a wondrous bulb, especially 
when preserved in the mummy of a crocodile
or ibis, after having been worshipped at Ombos or
Tentyra. There are dreams arising evidently out of
material effects upon the sleeping body. Thus a
dream may be produced by a secret sound or touch.
This has been reduced in some degree to practice.
We mean by way of experiment, and are not alluding
to penny or sixpenny dream-books, and the practice
of the ancient or modem Egyptians. But we allude
to those fantastic and partial revelations of troubles
and joys to come&mdash;seldom, alas! the latter, and of
things concurrently and contemporaneously happening 
far or near, and without visible or material communication, 
such as we have known, and such as
many of the more highly-wrought and imaginative
and spiritual of our fellow-creatures can testify to
have occurred within the sphere of their own experience.</p>

<p>As Susan entered the room tip-toe, she actually
found her mistress smiling with an expression of that
which is called "seraphic" content. It is clear that
in the popular conception, at least, the seraphs are
not bored by the constant repetition of a good thing.
At that moment Blanche imagined herself to be
leading her husband, who seemed quite naturally
to be blind, and whose sightless orbs were turned
to her with confiding affection, out for a walk
in the warm sunshine among crowds of people.
Everywhere she saw flowers and kind faces. She
thought Lady Courcy came by, radiant and joyful,
and placed something in her hands. It was Arthur's

<!-- vol 2 page 323 -->

wedding gift of diamonds and pearls. Then she
fancied they were in Paris. Suddenly they met
the Emperor and Empress, who stopped and spoke
such kind and touching words she felt she should
never forget them in her dream; but the little she
remembered when she awoke resembled a fragment
of the "Lily and the Bee," or half a sentence on the
traditional memory of music by Mr. Beresford Hope.
The Emperor detached an order from his uniform,
and, borrowing a pin from Eugenie, fastened it on
her husband's coat. It was the Japanese order of
the "bons maris"&mdash;and this her own, her adored blind
Arthur had deserved! She would have responded,
but words failed her. Then the magnificent music
of the united bands of the French army pealed forth,
around the Exhibition organ of 1851 the strains
of "Partant pour la Syrie," which, without any
apparent stop or audible transition, changed to "Villikins 
and his Dinah," and so undoubtedly it did, for
with a deep-drawn sigh she burst the bonds of sleep,
and saw Susan bending over her with affectionate
solicitude, and heard a street musician grinding the
very melody that had been magnified and sublimated,
not altered, in her dream.</p>

<p>"Oh, Susan!" she cried, before she had quite collected 
her ideas, "I was so happy; but tell me, have
you any news of your master? I have had such a
singular dream.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this permission to speak of a hitherto
forbidden topic, Susan went ahead.</p>

<p>"Lor', mum," she said, "I saw Mr. Tops this
morning, and he says master is so changed, so pale,

<!-- vol 2 page 324 -->

and in such a state of desperation, we're afraid
he'll do himself a mischief, if you don't forgive him,
and go home. He thinks he's been and caused your
death, and it quite preys on his mind like; as for
that matter, it's natural it should. Oh! do forgive
him, and I'm sure he'll never behave wrong again."</p>

<p>"He will never have the opportunity," said
Blanche, coldly; "so far as I am concerned. I trust
that his depravity will not carry him so far as to
cause him to deceive any other poor victim. But I
think at present he is more likely to be deceived
himself."</p>

<p>"Dear me, mum," rejoined Susan, "suppose he
was to marry some other woman, and you not
dead after all, why you'd be guilty of causing
bigamy."</p>

<p>The idea of her husband marrying again was a
home thrust; and for a moment Blanche quivered
under it. But in a moment she regained her apparent
calmness.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Aubrey were to contract a second marriage," 
she said, "I should never interfere. I am
dead to him."</p>

<p>"You make me quite shudder, I declare, mum,"
rejoined Susan, who was determined not to lose the
opportunity of talking on a topic hitherto forbidden
to her. "You may say so now, and no wonder, considering 
all. But it's my opinion you'd be very sorry
some day, for all that's been done."</p>

<p>"Never!" simply rejoined Blanche.</p>

<p>"Not if master really repents?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>"Repentance! what is that?" asked Blanche.

<!-- vol 2 page 325 -->

"If I am not now that which I dare not think of,
much less mention, was it not through the bravery
and devotion of a poor creature who owed me no
love or care, and yet perilled his life to save mine?
And if I were now a disfigured corpse, as I might be,
but for that gallant act of one whom, a fortnight ago
and less, <i>he</i> would have spurned from his horse's
bridle, or his street door, whose deed would it have
been but my husband's, of him on whom I bestowed
all my affection, all my heart? Speak no more of it,
I beg of you."</p>

<p>"But, mum," persisted Susan, "you know what
the doctor said; and would you have your child
without a father, and him married, perhaps, to some
one else? That's what I've been thinking of ever
since."</p>

<p>Blanche crimsoned to the ears, and then became
as suddenly pale; and her face grew like the twilight
sky, when the sun has suddenly disappeared behind a
bank of clouds, so cold, and grey, and ghastly in its
sternness.</p>

<p>"If I have a child born into this world," she said,
slowly, "it shall never call him father. I will work
for it, live for it, die for it, if need be; but it shall
never know him, nor be called by his name. I tell
you I could never believe, never trust him again; his
oaths would seem like dicers' falsehoods, even were
they true; his repentance like meanness added to
crime. If he could give me reparation, full reparation, 
I might listen to duty, could I choke the loathing
which sickens my very soul. But he could not, I tell
you, he could not. There is no way, no method, no

<!-- vol 2 page 326 -->

possibility; and I do not wish that there should be.
And now I order you to be silent on this topic; that
is, if you still regard me as your mistress."</p>

<p>"Oh, mum!" cried Susan, who had been sobbing
during these last words, "don't be angry; but Tops
and me was talking, and we were saying how happy
you might both be yet. Couldn't you live, now
master's ruined right out, in a little cottage, ever so
small? Don't you remember that one we saw at
Merton, last summer, quite smothered with white
roses, which master said looked as if it was just
married to the farm-house close by? Master would
work at writing, and we should want for nothing,
and Tops would dig in the garden without a farthing
of wages; and if he didn't, I would never speak to
him again."</p>

<p>"Do not cause me to appear harsh and ungrateful,
Susan," replied Blanche; "but if you wish to continue 
to visit me in this humble abode, never speak
to me of your master again. I tell you once for all,
that I am, and I wish to be, nothing to him. I tell
you that he cares for another&mdash;why do you force me
to speak of it? Do you not know it as well as I?
Be silent on the subject, if you have any regard for
me, henceforth, I tell you, and for ever."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," whimpered poor Susan, "I meant all
for the best. I don't believe&mdash;he'll ever go&mdash;after
that&mdash;wretch again. I know he hasn't since&mdash;you
left&mdash;and all men&mdash;that is, all gentlemen&mdash;are apt to
forget themselves some time or another&mdash;at least so&mdash;I 
have heard say. I'm sure&mdash;he loved you best&mdash;only 

<!-- vol 2 page 327 -->

he didn't think of it as he had ought to have
done&mdash;all the time&mdash;&mdash; Oh! how that knock at the
door startled me. I declare I'm that nervous! Shall
I see who it is, mum?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Aubrey nodded assent, and Susan left the
room.</p>

<p>"She means well," said Blanche, musing aloud;
"but cannot see that she only inflames my wound.
I wonder if this is my kind protectress who has
called."</p>

<p>Here Susan reappeared.</p>

<p>"The strange lady, mum," she said, "wishes to
know if she may come in?"</p>

<p>"I should think so, indeed," replied Blanche.
"Pray, beg of her to enter at once."</p>

<p>Susan obeyed her mistress, and at once ushered in
a veiled and cloaked figure, in whom the reader will,
as her most particular friends and admirers would
not have done, at once recognise the airy and volatile
debutante on the boards of the Thespis Theatre; the
plague and worry of the managerial existence of
Methusalem Wigster, Esq., comedian and sole lessee;
the ruling divinity of the Duke of Chalkstoneville;
the chastiser of Lord Eppingforest; the model of
fashion, but not the pink of propriety; the thorn in
the side&mdash;if all tales were true&mdash;of the Archbishop
of Middlesex; in short, that irrepressible, eccentric,
and perverse young lady, whose vocation it was by
turns to charm and shock the world, and who
rejoiced in the popular sobriquet of Kitty Dareall,
actress and lady at large. Had she acted only half

<!-- vol 2 page 328 -->

as well at the Thespis, as she commenced the interview 
on this occasion, we may fairly assume that she
would have had a great career on the stage.</p>

<p>As she entered, Blanche, still weak and tottering,
advanced to meet her, and would have clasped her
with outstretched arms, or kissed her hand had it
been extended. But the mysterious visitor drew
somewhat coldly back. As she did so, she cast a
quick look, or, rather indicated a look by a gesture,
towards Susan.</p>

<p>"Leave us, dear Susan, kindly, for awhile alone,"
said Blanche.</p>

<p>The waiting-maid obeyed with an alacrity she
would not have shown towards the richest and
proudest lady in the land. Alone with Blanche, our
novel Sister of Charity, or whatever she called herself, 
entreated Blanche to recline again on the sofa,
while she drew a chair to her side. We shall now
proceed to narrate the conversation that ensued in
the first person, a plan which we have before adopted
in the course of this history.</p>

<p>KITTY. I have ventured to intrude this last time
to offer what poor counsel and services I may.</p>

<p>BLANCHE. Oh! madam, you are indeed my guardian 
angel. Will you not tell me at length by what
name I may call one to whom I owe so much?</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>in measured accents</i>). I have no name.
I am one of a community who seek to repair their
faults by acts of charity towards their fellow-creatures
of the same frail sex. The debt you owe me is one
which I have long owed to others and to Heaven!
(<i>Withdraws her hand from the attempted clasp of

<!-- vol 2 page 329 -->

Blanche</i>.) Do not be offended, lady; we do not give
our hands; we try to offer our hearts to the unfortunate, 
in the atonement of our own misdeeds. (<i>With
a more brisk and cheerful utterance</i>.) Your physician
tells me that your sight, so miraculously restored, is
now greatly improved. He assures me that the cure
will be both lasting and complete. And, now, may I
venture to speak freely to you, and explain the full
purport of this visit?</p>

<p>BLANCHE. If not, dear madam, I were indeed unworthy 
of all that you have done. I trust that my
strength may soon be sufficiently restored to enable
me to do something for myself; it will not be for the
first time. Before I married, I was a governess, one
of a sad and often heart-weary class. It was in this
capacity that I met him whose faith was pledged to
mine.</p>

<p>KITTY. Your husband has suffered deeply; he is
expiating his folly by anguish so intense, remorse so
exquisite, that even a heart like mine, closed as it is
to love, blunted to sensibility, and dead to the world,
pities the horror of that remorse, the intensity of
that anguish. Dear lady! extend that forgiveness to
him which Providence has bestowed upon yourself.
You have regained your sight&mdash;believe me the scales
have fallen from his eyes also. He loves you and will
devote his future life to repair the wrong.</p>

<p>BLANCHE. Spare me, I pray you. There can be
no love between us now. To repay your kindness,
what would I not endure? But this. Ah! pardon
me, I implore you. If you knew the loathing that
the very thought inspires!</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 330 -->

<p>KITTY. It will pass away as easily as false love.
But you loved him truly, fondly. Nay, I know it
well. And now, too, there is something else that
should plead for the offender, that makes reconciliation 
more necessary and imperative. Will you
deprive your unborn child of a father's care and
love? Never! You will forgive him, and return to
him again.</p>

<p>BLANCHE (<i>who has risen, and with passionate gesticulation</i>). 
Never! My whole soul rebels against the
thought. Believe me, my forgiveness is his. In the
wildest moments of my delirium, when I approached
the parapet of the bridge, with the love of my whole
being flung back upon my heart, with my brain on
fire, and every nerve quivering, like those of a
wounded animal escaping from its torturers, then,
even then, I forgave him freely, and my last prayer
to Heaven was not for my own trembling soul, but
for him. I forgive him now; would work for him,
pray for him, die for him if need were; but not live
with him. Seek not to probe offended womanhood,
to conquer revolted love. I tell you that there are
mountains between us. Seas might not wash the
remembrance away. Knowing that we shall be
apart, I can think calmly, even affectionately, of
him. But when I entertain for a moment the thought
of reunion, it chokes me, and I cry aloud, "No, no!
Death rather! the bridge again rather! the cold
river and the rushing tide!"</p>

<p>KITTY. I implore you, do not distress yourself thus.
As a woman, I understand your pride; but should

<!-- vol 2 page 331 -->

not a <i>wife</i> forgive? Think not that I would palliate
an offence which the world allows us to condone so
readily, but never pardons on our side. Yet there
is happiness linked with forgiveness in your path.
Do not spurn it, but stoop, I entreat you. It is a
husband who, prostrate with remorse and grief, implores 
you from his solitude to return and to forgive.</p>

<p>BLANCHE. I <i>have</i> stooped&mdash;have bowed my head
in daily neglect and nightly sorrow. Oaths, blows,
cruelty I would have endured; possibly smiled
under. You do not know all. Listen! Had he
been lured astray by some accomplished siren, who,
meeting him in society, had momentarily flattered
his vanity by her simulated devotion, and dazzled him
with her accomplishments and her charms&mdash;there are
such beings, are there not? vampires in the guise of
angels, who start up on the path of married life!&mdash;had 
this been so, I might have forgiven, might have
tried to forget it in the renewed vows of a second
courtship. I might, I say; I do not know. But
<i>this! this!</i> To leave me for a wretch, a monster,
steeped in infamy, emblazoned in profligacy, an incarnate 
plague-spot in the shameless forehead of the
town. Madam, madam! you do not know. The
insult doubled&mdash;trebled&mdash;by his choice of a rival.
"Rival!" the word sickens me. The degradation
superlatived, embellished before the world. Oh I it
is too much&mdash;too much! Listen! I was deserted
day by day for one branded, posted in capital letters;
known to all, through an effrontery rare even in beings
of her degraded calling, as that which my lips refuse

<!-- vol 2 page 332 -->

to repeat. I see you shudder and start. Well may
you do so!</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>much agitated, and with a great effort</i>).
Continue&mdash;continue!</p>

<p>BLANCHE. In the affliction with which I was
visited, he left me, to shower gifts at the feet of this
foul idol, this vulgar and unfeminine Circe of the
swinish and brutal throng. Shame on him! Shame
on him! I had a favourite horse; I could not ride
her lately, because I was blind, and could not see
the falsehood in my husband's eyes, when he deceived 
me with stories which grew stale in repetition,
and excuses whose invention became monotonous in
wrong. It pleased the neglected wife sometimes to
caress the horse she could no longer ride. But he
placed that&mdash;that&mdash;woman, on poor Leila's back, and
doubtless she looked well, and he admired her; for
her accomplishments (<i>sarcastically</i>) are all masculine.
Yes, I am told that she rides boldly. I think I see
her jewelled whip striking my unconscious horse.
The noble creature did not fling that fair burden into
the mud. No! no! I am not jealous. I could not
be jealous of such a rival. She has not even the
attraction of outward beauty, they tell me; but what
of that? Well, madam, do you now ask me&mdash;abandoning 
all the dignity of womanhood, all the sanctity 
of love, all that which even man respects, or
pretends to honour, when he is pleased to assume
virtue&mdash;to sink into that husband's arms again? No!
no! it cannot be. It is not jealousy&mdash;it is not
anger&mdash;it is not revenge. It is justice, life, existence&mdash;it 

<!-- vol 2 page 333 -->

is glory to remain apart! But I have
shocked you too much with this narrative, so repugnant 
to your feelings, so detestable to your heart.
Pardon! pardon! I have heard your sobs; you are
touched, indeed, with the recital of my wrongs. Let
me aid you! You are ill&mdash;faint.</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>who has dropped her veil, falls back in a
swoon. Blanche aids her with tenderness, and puts a
glass of water to her lips. She partially recovers</i>). I
will have no more wine, your grace. I will go home.
Take me hence.</p>

<p>BLANCHE (<i>looking fixedly at her</i>). She is very
youthful. Yet I see traces of suffering in that
delicate face. She said, "your grace;" who can she
be? She is patrician in every movement and feature.</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>regaining her consciousness</i>). Where am
I? (<i>To Blanche, who has left her a moment to get some
restorative, and who is about to support her again</i>.)
Touch me not with a finger, if you would not have
me die. (<i>With a great effort.</i>) I am subject to
attacks like this. Our mission is a trying one, sometimes. 
My poor head is aching sadly, and my heart,
too, aches&mdash;for you, so innocent and so unhappy. I
thought that marriage&mdash;you are married, you know&mdash;made 
it a duty to a wife&mdash;a wife, Mrs. Aubrey&mdash;to
forgive much, very much. You have, indeed, much
to forgive. But do not measure your husband's
offence by the character of her, who&mdash;who&mdash;I am
not well to-day&mdash;perhaps did not seek to allure&mdash;no
matter. I hardly know what I am saying. Nay,
leave me to myself. I shall be better very soon.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 334 -->

<p>BLANCHE (<i>aside</i>). Poor lady! How wrong, how
selfish I have been. Doubtless, she, too, has had
some trials&mdash;perhaps a husband&mdash;who knows?&mdash;who
has deceived her also.</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>who has recovered her self-possession</i>).
Well, let us think what I can do to serve you.
How do you propose to live? for we cannot eat
and drink our wrongs, or exist upon our own sufferings.</p>

<p>BLANCHE. I studied in Italy nearly two years. I
was once intended for the opera. As a young girl
I shrank from the publicity, the dazzling foot-lights;
the very thought of gaining the applause so coveted
by all, appalled and frightened me. Now it is different. 
Should my sight be perfectly restored, as
the doctor assures me it will, my heart tells me I
shall not fail&mdash;my will assures me of success. True,
I have not the means to study at once, or even to
repay you these expenses. I propose, therefore, at
once to seek employment as a teacher of music. Can
you add to the benefits already conferred by your
generous aid and true-hearted sympathy in assisting
me to get a pupil or two, to start? If I fail in this,
I know not what will become of me. If in a year or
two, I can, with the most rigid economy, the hardest
toil, lay by enough to study a brief time, I will, I
must succeed. Yes, something here (<i>presses her
hand on her heart</i>) tells me that I shall!</p>

<p>KITTY (<i>aside</i>). 'Twas once my own dream. She
is beautiful and virtuous. Ah! how much that last
enters into the composition of the true artiste, the

<!-- vol 2 page 335 -->

realisation of a glorious ambition. Yet she is his
wife, and I would they could be reconciled instead.
And she loved him&mdash;loves him still. What can compensate 
for that? But 'tis in vain! How placidly
beautiful she looks now. If she knew who it is that
speaks to her, how those nostrils would dilate, those
eyes kindle into flame! It would be her death. I
must depart&mdash;must not come here again. The risk
is too great. (<i>Aloud</i>.) Lady, I have the power to
fulfil your wishes. From a fund, a pure and sacred
fund, believe my solemn word, I can supply you with
ample means. You need not shrink; need not hesitate 
to accept it, I assure you. The necessary introduction 
for your purpose I can also manage, through
my connexion with the outer world, which is still
great and varied, and will be hallowed by the purpose, 
for which&mdash;probably for the last time&mdash;it will
be used. In the mean time, your secret is safe. You
shall hear from me very soon. Adieu! Nay, no
thanks, not a word&mdash;no embrace&mdash;no hand. I am
the mere instrument of a duty. I would bless you,
but must not. Our community does not bless! (<i>Gazes
at her very earnestly for a moment</i>.) You will
succeed, and some day be happy. Farewell! (<i>She
goes out</i>.)</p>

<p>BLANCHE (<i>alone</i>). Mysterious being! generous
and kind friend, whose very features have been but
once fully revealed to my aching sight, yet whom I
love as a sister! Were I not bound to her by the
sacred ties of gratitude&mdash;were I not indebted to her
for existence, and hope&mdash;such hope as is left to me in

<!-- vol 2 page 336 -->

this world&mdash;I could have loved her for the sweet
fascination of her voice alone.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> SUSAN.</p>

<p>SUSAN. Oh! mum, the strange lady is gone. I
met her sobbing quite dreadful-like on the stairs. I
would have stopped her, but she put me aside, and
was gone out in an instant into the street.</p>

<p>BLANCHE. May Heaven for ever bless and comfort
her, Susan; for she has known some bitter wrong!</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">A PRESENT OF NAPLES SOAP.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">During my brief incarceration, I was much struck by the kind
attention of an under-gaoler, with red hair. This man supplied me with
a coarse napkin, whilst I partook of the greasy messes brought to me
for food. He pressed me to put on a rough sheep-skin overcoat, which
he said I should sleep in much more comfortably than in my tight
uniform. As the nights were cold, I thankfully acquiesced. He
cleaned my accoutrements, scraped the mud off my boots, regarding
them afterwards with great apparent satisfaction, and brushed me as
carefully as a Parisian valet. I felt grateful to the fellow, until the
order for my release, through an exchange of prisoners, having arrived,
the cause was duly explained. It appeared that, after my intended
execution, this amiable Judas was to have inherited my clothes.&mdash;<i>Reminiscence 
of Count &mdash;&mdash; during the Italian War of Independence</i>.</p>

<p>ARTHUR AUBREY sat alone in the little library of
his house in Queen's-square. Torn letters and papers
strewed the ground at his feet. The "man in possession" 
allowed him every license in his power, and
intimated that he "wasn't pertickler to a shade, with
a gent as was a gent." Aubrey was too honest, too
proud, and too indifferent, to take advantage of this
license, which strict probity might condemn. He
satisfied himself with his desk, containing papers of
no value save to the owner, a portrait of his wife,
the photographic album which Snap, the lawyer's

<!-- vol 2 page 338 -->

clerk, had desecrated, and one or two trifles endeared
to him by memory. These he had conveyed to a
lodging which he took in Percy-street, Tottenham
Court-road, where he intended to take up his abode
in the course of a day or two. There, once resided a
hearty and right genial soul, for some time the favourite
of the public, a prince of good fellows in his way,
whom every one liked, who never said or did an
unkind thing, and who exercised the high and beneficent 
privilege of amusing the multitude with straws.
Poor, dear Albert Smith! England could better have
spared a more profound thinker, a more utilitarian
philosopher than thou wast in thy brief day. What
if thou didst only chronicle the lighter follies of the
hour&mdash;what if thou didst extract fun from out of a
solemn mountain, snow-capped, and glaciered and
crevassed within its cloudy robe&mdash;what if thou didst
somewhat vulgarise Mont Blanc? What if thou
wert only the great chronicler of the harmless race
of "gents," whose name thou didst popularise, if
thou didst not originate the term? A man who
innocently and harmlessly amuses us is a benefactor
to his fellow-creatures. It was more than an ordinary
loss when lately Artemus Ward faded untimely from
sight, and the inimitable Bruton's jests were silenced
in the grave. The genuine dealer in mirth, like the
comic actor, is the friend of all. There is a bond of
universal sympathy in laughter, as well as tears.
Would it be any disrespect to thy memory, O Smithest
of the great family of Smiths! to tell here one of
the best classical bons-mots we have heard, which
was made apropos of one of thine own smart dodges

<!-- vol 2 page 339 -->

to tickle the fancy of the British public? We think
not. Well, then, this most rollicking genius of Mont
Blanc, upon one occasion, presented a small silver
coin bearing his own effigy, looking somewhat like the
bust of a Roman emperor, thereon, to all the visitors
present at the opening of one of his entertainment
seasons. On the reverse was merely an announcement 
by way of advertisement of the Egyptian Hall.
Upon which this inscription was suggested in our
hearing:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">ALBERTUS MAGNUS REX GENT-IUM.</p>

</div>

<p>And so he was, and a right merrie monarch too, beloved 
not only by his own people, but by those who
did not acknowledge his sway. He was historian,
high-priest, and king of a new race&mdash;a class not
possessed of much refinement, taste, or manners, but
still very distinct from the race of "snobs." For a
"gent" may have the best of hearts and the kindest
of dispositions; he may have the courage of a lion,
in spite of his vulgar or comic exterior&mdash;his manners
may be all wrong, but his heart may be in the right
place; not so with the "snob," i.e., in our understanding 
of these modern slang terms. The "gent"
in our apprehension is merely the plebeian "swell,"
the "snob" is always a "cad," but he may be an
aristocratic cad.</p>

<p>From Queen's-square to Percy-street, Tottenham
Court-road; from the height of fashion to the depths
of disgrace; from at least the appearance and all the
enjoyment of prosperity to penury and strife with
want! And this, too, unarmed and unequal to the
contest! Such was the future which Aubrey had to

<!-- vol 2 page 340 -->

look in the face. He happened to have a small balance
at his bankers, when the distress was put in, just five
hundred and sixty pounds. This he immediately drew
out, when he saw the truth staring him in the face,
that he would shortly have no means left. He saw
partly through Mr. Grinderby's game. That worthy
had determined to avoid a sale, at least, at present,
though he hoped yet by a clever manipulation of the
affair to purchase the property in conjunction with a
"friend" and capitalist. He had an immense idea of
its value and mineral wealth. <i>En attendant</i>, should
that scheme fail, he had so arranged matters with
the persons named in the entail of the estate in case
of Aubrey's forfeiture or death without issue, that
he had got them to consent to a suit in Chancery,
whereby he should be appointed legal representative
of them all, and receiver to the estate. His intention 
was so to depreciate the property and accumulate
charges, that it should eventually come to the hammer, 
when his friend would step in and purchase
on their joint behalf. But even if this daring stroke
of genius could not be effected, he saw his way to a
very pretty income out of the property. Besides, he
hated, and, according to his view of things, despised
Aubrey. We cannot say that his client was entitled
to any honest man's respect; but still he was not so
lost, so low and degraded, as really to merit the contempt 
of Grinderby. Imagine a centipede which had
crawled up the pitfall into which some maimed
creature infinitely superior to itself had been betrayed
by folly or rashness, and we have some idea of the
relative positions of the lawyer and his ruined client.

<!-- vol 2 page 341 -->

Grinderby could afford and did afford a great deal of
heavy sentiment and bitter condemnation about poor
Blanche Aubrey's supposed fate. He was never tired
of shaking his wicked old iron-grey poll like a venerable 
moral jackdaw, whilst uttering with harsh reiteration: 
"Sad thing, sad business, very!" Then
he would say: "Of course we could not continue to
conduct the business after poor Mrs. Aubrey's shocking 
death. Some persons imagine that we lawyers
are devoid of feeling, and so perhaps we ought to be,
but there are limits even to legal duty. Our loss may
be heavy, but the reputation of the firm must not be
endangered, and, thank Heaven! we can afford to
be still men." Here the snuff-box would come into
active play.</p>

<p>And what did Aubrey, the ruined client, the man
at whom the finger of scorn and hatred was pointed
on every side, mean to do? The most bitter of his
denouncers had been the most profligate of his associates 
and advisers; the men who had sought to
entice him away from purity and bliss to the haunts
of sensual depravity; who had laughed among themselves 
at his domestic devotion, whilst it still existed;
who would have poisoned, if they could, by their
brutal sneers and insinuations, alike the wife's confidence 
and the husband's content; who would have
betrayed her and shot him, if they had dared, and if
they could: in fact, the most vicious and depraved of
the set who had crowded his rooms and extolled his
cook, who had flattered his gentle partner's beauty
and his own taste and spirit&mdash;these were the persons
who now wagged their tongues longest and loudest

<!-- vol 2 page 342 -->

in moral acrimony and virtuous disgust. Then the
women&mdash;how they discovered that "there had always
been something very odd about that wretched Mrs.
Aubrey!" It was amusing to hear a hideous old hag,
the widow of an Indian general, who wore a gipsy-hat 
at the seaside, and whose scraggy shoulders
and green flowery adornments at evening parties
in town caused Mr. Stingray to compare her to a
shoulder-of-mutton bone half smothered in parsley.
This lady declared, with a leer of ineffable affectation, 
there was something in Mr. Aubrey's eyes,
that she had always noticed when he looked at her,
which no modest woman could endure. As this was
a suggestion that he had cast an amorous glance on
her conscious charms, those to whom she addressed
it tittered at the notion, whilst by no means entirely
exonerating him. There was, doubtless, "something
in it," they thought, or said. There was a Scotch
woman, of some forty autumns, a M'Taggart of
M'Turk, who declared that he ought to be hanged
for having murdered that "puir young thing."
"If I'd been his wife," she said, "I'd have taught
him a lesson," and doubtless she would. Yet this
very woman, so respectable and religious, had actually 
at one time, utterly unable as she was to
fathom the deep love or comprehend the purity of
Blanche, conceived the notable project of a little
dinner at her house in Clarges-street, whereat the
Duke of Chalkstoneville and Mrs. Aubrey should be
thrown very much together indeed. It was to be on
a day when Aubrey attended a race, or was otherwise 
absent from town. What could have been that

<!-- vol 2 page 343 -->

worthy dame's precise intention? It was somehow
connected with a fifty-guinea diamond brooch and a
very handsome Genoa velvet dress, in which she
fancied she saw herself arrayed as a consequence of
this little exercise of hospitality and friendship. The
duke told her that he should be very happy to meet
Mrs. Aubrey whenever Mrs. M'Taggart pleased; but
somehow Blanche had no particular fancy for the
Scotch lady's voluble brogue; and, without the
slightest suspicion, constantly declined the overtures
"just to dine in a freendly way, ye ken, some day
when you are left alone, my dear, which I'm thinking
you are a wheen too often; but it's like a' the men,
as ye'll be feending out some time or ither, when
a' your braw youth and good looks are gone, my puir
dear young leddy."</p>

<p>But all the malignity and triumph of Aubrey's
worst enemies and ci-devant friends were nothing to
the exultant hatred of Mrs. Pushforte, his aunt by
marriage, whose man&oelig;uvres we have before chronicled. 
There was not an insinuation or a calumny
that this woman and Mrs. Blewbore did not invent
and circulate. The husband of the latter, who held
a Government situation, and who was a small poet of
some popularity, the author of a "Dirge to Ocean,"
which might have been composed on the steps of a
bathing-machine at Margate, and which had been set
to music by an "eminent composer," had been a
great admirer of Blanche, and had written two songs,
one called the "Blighted Lily," and the other the
"Blind Wife of Babylon," which were supposed to
allude to her. The poor bardling was greatly horrified 

<!-- vol 2 page 344 -->

by her untimely death, and was about to plunge
himself remorselessly into the agonies of composition,
to produce a "Dramatic Fragment" on the event,
when his poor little soul was suddenly nearly shaken
out of him by his wife's terrific denunciation of the
"Lost One," which was the intended title of the fragment. 
Poor man! he was actually confined to his
own room for a whole week after, and we shrewdly
suspect cruelly deprived of pen and ink all the time.
Mrs. Blewbore declared to all the frequenters of her
soir&eacute;es that the "governess," meaning Mrs. Aubrey,
had been no better than she should be, when she was
a governess, and had lived with that profligate Arthur
Aubrey, before they were married. You should have
heard that sallow and slimy woman tell this over
and over again to all her particular pets, from the
gaunt female Egyptian traveller, Miss Peagrim, who
had once been prisoner among the Arabs, but whose
reputation* was as unsullied thereby as a thistle of
the Hebrides is unwithered by the Eastern simoom, to
the red and freckled young Scotch poet, M'Crawlery,
who wrote such sweet aesthetic songs on the invisible
slum-life of Whitechapel. Our readers will, doubtless, 
recollect those beautiful poems of his, the
"Crackit Flower-pot," and "Battersea Park, a Reverie," 
which were so justly extolled in the "Centipede," 
in an article placing the author on the same

<!-- vol 2 page 345 -->

pedestal with Burns in regard to genius and style,
but far superior to him as a moral teacher.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*So, doubtless, the Arabs would eagerly have affirmed, even had
she herself accused them of rudeness.</p>

<p>A latronibus esse te fututam<br/>

Dicis, Senia: sed negant latrones.]</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Pushforte, whose true
antecedents we have had occasion to mention in the
preceding volume, informed her associates that Aubrey 
had been one of the worst characters in early life
she had ever known. As an instance, she mentioned
that he had actually smoked a cigar on the afternoon
of his mother's funeral! This, we believe, was
strictly true; but she did not add that smoking was
such a habit with that heartless libertine, whose
attachment to his mother was one of the best traits
in his youthful character, that he would probably
have done as much on the road to his own execution,
if he had been able to procure the means. But the
horror of the amiable twaddlers whom she acquainted
with the fact, was none the less poignant.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Aubrey died, as she was supposed to
have done, the victim of her husband's libertine
heartlessness, and had he remained rich, or become
rich by some suddenly inherited wealth, what a
different verdict would have been given by Society,
and his friends! We do not hesitate to say that he
would have been exonerated by the majority of
Society from every charge. We have known a far
worse case, in which singularly enough Profligacy
has alone withheld its consent from the general
verdict of acquittal, whilst the severely moral and decorous 
have been the first to rally round the polluted 
and sensual Cr&oelig;sus, and to stand his sponsors
openly in the eyes of the world. Extremes meet
socially as well as politically, and the ultra-saint and

<!-- vol 2 page 346 -->

sinner find a bond of alliance, just as the ultra-democrat 
and despot cotton together in their hatred of
the intelligent institutions which limit the power of
the tyrant and restrain the fury of the mob. The
model country nobleman and the Rhadamanthus of
Quarter Sessions, and their wives and families, unite to
rehabilitate in county estimation the heartless and
godless voluptuary who has exhausted his passions,
but retained his colossal fortune. The most exemplary 
father and mother offer him their daughter, as
some benighted heathens proffer their children to the
blood-stained idols of a hideous superstition, or as
virgins have been offered to monsters, according to
the traditions of the classical world. After all, what
more hideous superstition ever existed than the reverence 
paid by mankind to wealth? Men, who
worshipped Garibaldi, when he came over here,
begin to talk of him with an air of patronising
pity, because he refused the substantial gifts of
Fortune and remained in poverty; because he would
not accept the "wages" of respectability and the
pompous alms of aristocratic sensation-mongers&mdash;"The 
poor dear old General," they say: "it is a
pity that he will speak and write." They forget
how little he writes and speaks, and how gloriously
consistent his utterances are. They hear that he
keeps a cow or a donkey the less, and they touch
their foreheads and say, "After all, there was something 
wrong here!" How can they continue to
bestow their worship on a man in a red shirt, who
grows his own vegetables! They do not, it is true,
apply this to Cincinnatus, nor to the disciples of the

<!-- vol 2 page 347 -->

Saviour. If they did, they would necessarily conceive 
Judas to have been at least a commonly prudent
and worldly man; one whom modern appreciation
would prefer for a partner in the City, a bank director, 
or a clerk&mdash;a man of business and figures&mdash;and 
not a poet, a dreamer, or a fool. If the hero
who has survived Aspromonte should happen to live
too long; to survive the new-born liberty of Italy, or
to be put aside and forgotten in the triumphs of commercial 
regeneration; if Italy should suddenly become 
a great business country, is it too wild a speculation 
to imagine him lacking bread in his extreme
old age, a second Belisarius in all save the quest of
charity! The forgetfulness of a nation is so easy;
because how is any one to know that a hero is dying
of want, unless newspapers announce the fact; and
somehow dying heroes do not write to the "Times"
to proclaim their wants, and the <i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i> generally 
proclaims them too late. Had even the case
of Lady Hamilton been ventilated in the contemporary 
Press, we do not suppose that she would
have been left to perish in want of the common
necessaries of life. It is a dangerous experiment for
any one to be without money in this world. How
much more true and stringent is this in its application 
to private individuals, mere broken spendthrifts, 
whose only hold (God help them I) is on
relations and "friends," and on those whom they
have feasted and benefited in former days! Had
Arthur Aubrey been rich, he would have been able
to set truth and scandal at defiance; since he had
committed no crime punishable by the law. As he

<!-- vol 2 page 348 -->

was poor, a conscience void of reproach, a career unstained 
by a single vice or folly, would not have
saved him from blame. Under the circumstances, he
had a double crop of bitterness to reap. Yet it was
this which saved him. The desperation of a hunted
animal caused him to accept the struggle for existence. 
He felt that his punishment was in living,
and he lived on.</p>

<p>During the brief time that he remained in the
house in Queen-square, he underwent two remarkable 
visits, among those of a host of duns, curiosity-mongers, 
and pretended friends by whom he was
beset. Strange to say, he received most of these.
For it was one of Aubrey's peculiarities of disposition 
to dislike being denied to any one who sought
him. It was only when a penny-a-liner, a sort of
outsider and hanger-on of the Press, who disgraced
the noble profession to which he belonged by a multitude 
of little cadging and disreputable acts, had
gained access to him, and asked half a dozen questions, 
each of which was as a stab, before Aubrey discovered 
his drift, that he determined to subject himself 
to this distressing ordeal no more. But we are
bound to describe the two visitations to which we have
referred, because one is so characteristic in its truthfulness, 
and the other is essential to the development
of our narrative.</p>

<p>When Aubrey owned the magnificent yacht which
had come to grief, after a brief career of inutility and
expense, he also owned a solemn, respectful, and
respectable steward, who had never sailed with any
one under the rank of a baronet before. In the

<!-- vol 2 page 349 -->

short space of two years, he realised in Aubrey's service 
such an addition to his capital, that he would
then have retired <i>into</i> "public" life; that is, taken a
first-rate hotel in a sea-port town, had he not been
tempted by a very agreeable and lucrative offer from
a nobleman to proceed to the Mediterranean for a
cruise. In this capacity he had remained a considerable 
time, and had at length commenced business at
Brighton on a substantial scale. Aubrey had always
considered this man in the light of a rather confidential 
and trustworthy servitor, capable of defending
his master's interests from the attacks of others on sea
and land, while thoroughly taking care of himself. He
looked upon him, it is true, as a very expensive
servant; but then he had accepted him as such. He
believed that he would take large percentages, and
even defraud him, according to respectable usage and
precedent, after the manner of his "cloth." He had
ruled supreme over the yacht establishment. He was
a sort of man who did not put a bottle of wine on the
table twice, if it did not suit him to do so; and who
treated all ideas of economy with an air of such
superb contempt, that you could not possibly have
imagined all the time that he sold even the candle-ends 
when in port with the most exemplary regularity.
There was nothing too grand for his master's loss;
nothing too small for his own benefit. Cakeman,
for such was his name, was eminently respectable,
and pre-eminently a gentleman's servant in his
deportment. The manner in which he said, "I
think, sir, we are running short of champagne.
There is not more than ten dozen left. If you will

<!-- vol 2 page 350 -->

permit me to suggest that it would be as well to lay
in a fresh stock," was sublime. Or, for instance,
"Are you aware, sir, that we have only six silver
salts? It looks very bad at a full table. Lord Dunsinane 
never had less than twelve in use." For the
rest, Cakeman was an admirable valet when on shore,
and the way in which he would regulate and lay out
his master's wardrobe was delightful to see. He
did not, certainly, abstract articles of dress, when he
considered that they had done sufficient duty to their
first owner; but he said, calmly, "I've removed the
blue frock-coat," or "I've put away the last dress
suit, sir. It wasn't fit for you to wear. The other
which I ordered from Pond's came home last night."
There was no withstanding this coolness, after a man
had once yielded to it, and Aubrey had done so, and
continued it to the end of the chapter. For the
rest, Cakeman was an excellent sailor in every sense,
cool in storm and danger, serene and self-satisfied,
bland, and altogether a most creditable personage at
all times. That man would have shaved clean between 
the shocks of an earthquake, and laid the cloth
for dinner with an unmoved countenance by the
light of a general conflagration, so long as his own
arrangements remained undisturbed. When Aubrey
gave up yachting, or when yachting gave him up,
he parted with this treasure of a steward. Had
Cakeman been on board his vessel at the time, it is
possible that she would never have been wrecked.
But he was in London with his master, when the
sailors, one by one, following the example of the
captain, slunk on shore, and left the vessel exposed

<!-- vol 2 page 351 -->

to the fury of a chance storm, and a storm did chance,
with only a single anchor and about thirty fathoms
of cable out.</p>

<p>He expressed himself with such respectful regret
on leaving, that Aubrey gave him an extra ten-pound
note. He thought Cakeman's voice trembled as he
bade him adieu; and when the steward, smoothing
his long-shore hat, as if to allay the itching of his
respectable palm, said he had a request to prefer,
Aubrey listened with the utmost condescension and
interest to that somewhat bald and very prosperous-looking 
man. Cakeman respectfully intimated that
he should like to become the proud possessor of a
fine oil-painting of his master, which used to adorn
the saloon of the yacht, and which had been saved
from the wreck. He hoped he should not be considered 
bold and presuming, but Lord Dunsinane
and Sir John Skyscraper had both given him their
portraits on leaving&mdash;he did not state that the one
was a crayon sketch, and the other a duplicate
silhouette, done on Brighton Pier&mdash;and he should
always hang it up whilst he had a humble place
of his own in the best room in the house, in recollection 
of the many happy days he had spent in Mr.
Aubrey's service, with pleasure to himself and, he
trusted, with satisfaction to his employer. To be
brief, Aubrey felt flattered; and Cakeman gained
a good furniture picture for the hotel, besides a
valuable evidence of the esteem in which he had been
held whilst enjoying so excellent and lucrative a
berth.</p>

<p>Soon after the hotel was opened, he had occasion

<!-- vol 2 page 352 -->

to come up to town, in order to lay in a large stock
of Cape wine, in order to form the basis of his extensive 
and varied cellar. So the faithful fellow
thought he would take the opportunity of calling on
one or two of his old patrons, and among them on
his former master, Mr. Aubrey. He soon found out
the bearings of that gentleman's affairs, and felt
chagrined, though by no means surprised. For Mr.
Cakeman had often told his wife, the sole depositary
of his most important observations and secrets, that
somehow he didn't think Aubrey's career would be
a prosperous one very long. "It's my belief," he
would say to that elderly and grasping female, "that
he's spending his capital, and he's got a rare bad lot
about him."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Robert, that's what you oughter," observed the
lady.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll tell me for why, Mrs. Cakeman,"
responded this chrysolite of stewards.</p>

<p>"You don't make half enough out of him," she
said. "Look at your family; look at the boots and
shoes the girls want, and the clothes the boys wear
out. And you might do almost anything you
please."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mrs. Cakeman," quoth Respectability,
glowing with honest emotion, "that I've a character
to lose, and I can't sail nearer to the wind than I do
at present. Why I've took away coats, as I may
say have scarce been worn; and look at the wines
and groceries I've brought ashore in the marketing-baskets, 
and with the dirty table-linen, this very

<!-- vol 2 page 353 -->

week. I've made more in a week out of him, plain
mister as he is, than I've made in a month out of his
lordship, and it isn't many that could work the
oracle as I did with him. I believe you wouldn't be
content, if I was to fetch home a waggon loaded with
the plate, and would blow me up if a mustard-spoon
was missing out of the list. You'd like to send me
back for it, wouldn't you, now?"</p>

<p>And Cakeman indulged in a sort of laugh which
he never allowed himself out of the privacy of his
domestic home. It was an article, that laugh, which
he might be said never to take out with him at all.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion, Mr. C," said his better half,
sharply, "that you're no better than a fool."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my love," returned the gentleman;
"I suppose that's gratitude for getting leave yesterday
to change all the blue satin sofa-coverings and what
not in the after-cabin, after dirtying them near the
joinings with the least possible loss of material when
they come to be worked up again."</p>

<p>A mollified expression immediately took possession
of the lady's ample face.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say it?" she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Don't I?" replied her lord and master. "I tell
you what, Mrs. C, that job is as good as a twenty-pound 
note to us any day, and all straight and
serene, and without the slightest possible risk. There's
one thing I won't do; not for you, no, nor the children
neither, and that is to get into trouble, when there
isn't any call for it, Mrs. C."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the lady, "all I've got to say is,
that it's very aggravating to hear how a paltry humbugging 

<!-- vol 2 page 354 -->

lot like his friends are cutting it fat, when
we are obliged to earn our money with such trouble
and difficulty. But of course I don't want you to
put yourself in any danger."</p>

<p>"And I'll take care I don't," said Mr. C, as he
filled a yacht wine-glass with yacht port. "Anything 
in reason that I can do, I'm sure I don't
grudge the trouble, and I don't see what more you've
a right to expect."</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the third day of the
distress, when Aubrey was informed that his old
steward, Cakeman, was below, and had expressed a
strong wish to see him. "Let him come up," said
Aubrey; and accordingly Mr. Cakeman made his
distinguished appearance. He was a trifle fatter,
balder and greyer than he was some three years and
a half ago, but looked in "excellent health and
spirits," and as much weather-beaten and bronzed as
he was capable of becoming, even under a tropical
sun.</p>

<p>"Well, Cakeman," said Aubrey, "what is it? I
fear there is nothing that I can do for you. You
have heard, I suppose, of my&mdash;misfortunes. Take a
seat!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, thank you," said Cakeman; "I've just
returned from a long cruise, sir; been at a many
places, where we was, sir, in the Mediterranean and
all along the coast of Spain. I've been in Sir Charles
Filey Bart's schooner, <i>Pelican</i>, only ninety-five tons;
nothing like your vessel, sir, but very roomy forward. 
Sir Charles's two daughters was with us, sir,
very nice young ladies. We went as far as Naples.

<!-- vol 2 page 355 -->

We were six weeks at Naples at our old anchorage,
sir, and it made me think of you and the vessel, I
can assure you, very often. I'm sorry to hear things
are not going on quite right, sir; but I hope it's only
a bit of a gale, and that you'll come all right again
under double-reefed topsails, sir; excuse me for being
so bold."</p>

<p>"No, Cakeman," said Aubrey, mournfully; "things
will never come right again."</p>

"Don't say so, sir," said Cakeman. "I've known
many a gentleman taken aback, and they always came
right again. When I was with young Lord Sevensthemayne, 
we were actually boarded by a 'silver
arrow,' and his lordship was locked up at Gravesend;
but it all come right again."</p>

<p>Aubrey shook his head. "You are a good fellow,
Cakeman, and you mean well," he said, wearily;
"but what is it I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," said Cakeman; "I only called to
see how you were, sir; I've heard all from Mr. Tops.
I've set up in the hotel line, and if you should come
to Brighton, I hope we shall be able to make you
comfortable. This is the card, sir, if you'll allow me.
When I was in Naples, sir, I bought a little trifle of
soap, sir, and if you'd be so condescending as to
accept some, I should feel very proud." Here he
fumbled in his coat-pocket, and brought out a white
jar, apparently a shilling jam-pot, converted to this
Neapolitan use. "I thought of you when I was
there, sir, as I said, and knowing how remarkable
partial you used to be to this sort of soap, I thought
I would bring some over for you, sir, that's all."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 356 -->

<p>So saying, Mr. Cakeman deposited his burden on
the table, bowed, smoothed his hat again, and turned
to leave the room. Aubrey did not even pause to
wonder at his own pronounced predilection for Naples
soap. He felt touched at this little remembrance,
and said in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"Stop, Cakeman! I'm sure I'm much obliged
to you for this remembrance of me. It is very creditable 
of you. I thank you much."</p>

<p>Cakeman had the door-handle in his hand. He
turned round and said:</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir, there was a little
matter, a mere trifle, sir, which I may as well take
the opportunity of mentioning, as I am sure&mdash;indeed&mdash;you 
would wish." The hesitation was caused by a
search in his waistcoat-pocket. "I shouldn't have
done so, sir, I assure you; but Mrs. Cakeman said
she knew you would be angry, if I didn't. It's a little
bill for repairing the saloon chairs after the wreck: I
paid it, sir, at the time. It's a mere nothing, only
eight pounds eighteen and six. It's receipted all
right, Messrs. Sawder and Stickem, in the High-street, 
if you recollect. Of course, sir, any time will
do to suit your convenience, and I shouldn't have
mentioned it now, but that I'm short of money to go
back." Here Mr. Cakeman looked steadily at Aubrey,
and continuously smoothed his hat.</p>

<p>We remember in our youth being shown over a
beautiful little church in Wales by a dean's lady,
in the month of July. We had, of course, doffed
a white silk hat which graced our brow in those
days, and we were gently smoothing the same with

<!-- vol 2 page 357 -->

ungloved hand, whilst admiring a particular painted
window, on the beauties of which the dean's lady
dwelt. Suddenly we felt a little roughness and consequent 
obstruction to the smoothing process. We
pressed our hand over it more forcibly. At once a
sting was darted into our flesh! It was, O ye
tutelary deities of the ancient Britons! a wasp
which had settled on our head-covering. Never shall
we forget the look of horror cast on us by the dean's
lady, on hearing the involuntary expression which
escaped our lips. It was&mdash;&mdash;; but no! the remembrance 
of the sting will hardly excuse the repetition
of the words which caused that churchman's better
half to recoil with terror and affright.</p>

<p>There are some men who would endure even a
hornet's sting without an alteration of countenance
under similar circumstances. Cakeman was one of
these. The look which Aubrey flung at him was
utterly lost. "If it's not convenient, sir," he began
to resume with the most perfect deference; but
Aubrey had already taken out a ten-pound note.</p>

<p>"You can send the change up by my servant," he
said. "That will do. Good afternoon. I am obliged
to you for this visit;" and he turned his back to walk
up and down the room.</p>

<p>The grey eyes of Cakeman twinkled with pleasure.
He had scarcely hoped for the money, since he had
heard the narrative of Tops. It was, therefore, an unexpected 
haul. He paused a moment, to think if he
could claim anything else; and then said in the softest,
clearest tone, as if he had been announcing luncheon
to an invalid:</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 358 -->

<p>"You'll find the soap excellent, sir, quite genuine,
I assure you. I bought it in the Toledo at Ricordi's
myself." And he bowed very respectfully and went.</p>

<p>In paying the rascal, Aubrey had acted semi-forgetfully 
and mechanically, as it were. He had been
so accustomed to honour all Cakeman's bills. The
meanness and trickery of his attached old steward
occurred to him instantly; but in his indignation he
forgot his circumstances for the moment. Swallowing 
his resentment, however, he rang the bell,
and Tops appeared.</p>

<p>"Is that scoundrel gone?" he said; "if not show
him to the door instantly."</p>

<p>"He let hisself out, sir, by the hall-door," replied 
Tops. "I didn't think he meant no good," he
muttered to himself, "the moment I set heyes on
him. He said he'd brought master a present of some
soft-soap. It's jest the very hidentical article I
should 'ave thought he dealt in."</p>

<p>"Tops!" said his master, "I don't wish to see any
one else, whilst I remain here, and to-morrow I am
determined to go. I wish to pay you your wages; I
can only afford to give you a month in addition. I
am afraid that any character&mdash;I can give&mdash;just now&mdash;will 
be of little use&mdash;you understand; but go to Sir
Harry Luckless&mdash;he is a kind-hearted man, and will
do all that is necessary."</p>

<p>"Beg your parding, sir," said Tops; "but I've
saved a little money in your sarvice, and I was goin'
to ax you to take care of it for me jest at present,
till things changes a little."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! you silly fellow, what do you

<!-- vol 2 page 359 -->

mean? Here, I insist. Not a word, if you don't
wish to hurt and offend me."</p>

<p>In vain Mr. Tops tried to resist. The fact is, he
couldn't express himself; and he went down fairly
blubbering with sixteen pounds ten shillings in his
rough hand, and left his master crying up-stairs.</p>

<p>"I shall have to look arter him afore long," quoth
Tops to the Downy, "or I'm blamed, if I wouldn't
throw this 'ere money into the misken, or giv' it to a
horfan in the street."</p>

<p>Just then, Aubrey, as men in deep grief will
often think over minute trifles, remembered the
history of those very chairs for which Cakeman had
made that interesting charge. He had given them
to the steward himself after the wreck, on his representation 
that they were not worth removing from the
shop, where he had sent them, in common with the
remainder of the salvage from the wreck, to be repaired. 
We are in a position to state that they looked
uncommonly well in the coffee-room of the new hotel.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am!" cried Aubrey, "to be duped
thus to the last." At this moment another visitor
was announced, this time a lady deeply veiled. "Tell
her I can see no one&mdash;no one!" thundered Aubrey.
"Tell her to write, if she has anything to say."</p>

<p>Tops touched his forelock and retired. Presently
he came up again with a note.</p>

<p>"The lady says, sir, that if you read this you will
be sure to see her," he said, handing a note to Aubrey.
"She looks like one of them women as is took pious,
and goes about collecting money to build churches
for the poor," he added, <i>sotto voce</i>. "It's a sort I

<!-- vol 2 page 360 -->

shouldn't let in anywheres, if I'd a choice in the matter.
As for this one, she looks like own sister to a stick
of black sealing-wax, she's so straight and thin.
There ain't no bend in her whatever. That rum cove
below he peeps out and says, 'Blest if she ain't a
walking hadvertisement for Jay's Mourning Wareus.' "</p>

<p>During this soliloquy of Tops, Aubrey opened and
read the letter. It was couched in the following
terms:</p>

<p>"I am come to ask you to redeem a promise made
to me at Richmond by the water-side. Do not refuse
to see me now. I come as a suppliant, and I rely on
your word. You told me you would assist me then,
and I am now in the deepest need of it.</p>

<p class="right">"Yours,<br/>

"K. D."</p>

<p>"See her&mdash;now? What is the meaning of this?
The very thought of her is hateful to me. She is a
remorse rising from the river&mdash;a dark recollection
from the grave!" He breathed heavily and clutched
the table for support. "What does she want? Who
has set her on? Is she impelled by some devilish
curiosity? Or has she come to reproach me with
my folly&mdash;with being too late? Let me think&mdash;let
me remember. She never encouraged my insane
folly&mdash;she spoke truth to me. I will see her. I will
not play the coward. There is no punishment too
great for me. Here, tell her I will see her. Show
her up at once."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 361 -->

<p>Tops immediately went on his errand; not without 
a certain look of apprehension which might be
explained by his informing the Downy directly after,
that his master had certainly gone out of his senses.</p>

<p>" 'Tain't onlikely," observed that worthy in answer
to that remark, "considerin' wot I've knowed 'appen
to a cove in distress. To be sure he was honly a
homlibus driver. Remind me as I tells yer hof it
over a pipe and a drop of summut warm this werry
night."</p>

</div>

<p>ACCORDINGLY, the interview between Aubrey and
his lady visitor, who, we need hardly say, was Kate
Dareall, took place.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, on entering the room, "to
intrude upon your privacy, to come here at all, to
enter a house doubly sacred in my eyes; but I have
no choice. You once promised me your assistance.
I have need of it&mdash;very sudden need now. I want a
certain sum of money immediately; will you give it
to me?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 363 -->

<p>Aubrey started, and remained for a moment silent.
It was evident that she did not know all. Should he
tell her? Nay, perhaps he had no choice. What
amount would she require? Probably a sum beyond
his means to give.</p>

<p>"Sit down, pray sit down, Miss Dareall," he replied. 
"I am not very rich just at present, you
know. What is the amount which you need?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds!" she replied, in a calm,
clear voice; and, as we might say, with the utmost
coolness.</p>

<p>The old spirit of generosity came strongly upon
Arthur, mingled with a certain feeling of desperation.
There was also some little surprise, not to say a
stronger emotion, elicited by this appeal. But he
did not stay to analyse his feelings. Five hundred
pounds! It was nearly every penny he had at his
command in the world. He was about to be thrown
upon his own resources. No matter; he would take
a place under Government&mdash;the librarianship of the
House of Commons, or something of that kind,
suited to his taste. He had warm friends in the
Government and Opposition also. Or he would fall
back on literature and the drama. He had talked to
Blanche some months before, about their being poor
together, and she had seemed rather to approve of it
in her beautiful enthusiasm. But then she was gone&mdash;gone, 
and how? Well, he could die too. He did
not care how soon. What right had he to live? At
any rate, utter poverty was some expiation. All
these thoughts rushed through his disordered head;
for, in truth, he was overwrought, and acting like a

<!-- vol 2 page 364 -->

man in a dream, ever since the disappearance of
Blanche. Had he not starved himself, and abstained
from all exciting beverages, he would, in all probability, 
have committed suicide.</p>

<p>Aubrey took out his pocket-book and counted five
notes. They were for one hundred pounds each.
He placed them in an envelope, which he closed, and
then presented to Miss Dareall. She looked at him
with a strange expression, which often struck him
after. It was one of mingled pity, interest, and admiration. 
She spoke partly to herself and partly to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"This merits forgiveness. Thank you, Mr. Aubrey.
Something tells me that you will not repent this hereafter. 
It is, believe me, for a sacred object, this
money. It is not for me&mdash;for my use. Do you
know I would rather beg in the streets&mdash;no, I
mean," she said with a shudder, "rather die, than
have asked you such a thing for myself. Poor
fellow! you look very ill. Do take care of yourself.
There may be some happiness in store for you yet.
Your wife!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aubrey started, and waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>She continued, "I was going to say, Mr. Aubrey, 
that she may yet be restored to you. Who
knows? You have no evidence of her death. Nay,
listen!"</p>

<p>"This is cruel!" cried Aubrey. "I must implore
you to spare me this. Excuse me. Leave me to
myself. I am happy to have rendered you a trifling
service. I quite understand that it is some charitable
object you have in hand. Good-bye, Miss Dareall!

<!-- vol 2 page 365 -->

We shall never meet again." And he opened the
door, and bowed low to the actress. She paused
irresolute and confused. Her allegiance to Blanche
was shaken. Might she not spare them both a life of
misery and despair? She stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"If, Mr. Aubrey, I should place in you a great,
great confidence, and ask you&mdash;&mdash;" Here she hesitated.</p>

<p>Aubrey entirely misunderstood her meaning, and
spoke coldly and haughtily. "It would be utterly
in vain. I have done all that I possibly can. I
have kept my word to the full. It is not in my
power to do more&mdash;&mdash; I assure you; not in my
power."</p>

<p>Miss Dareall's face flushed with an angry glow of
shame. With a strong effort she repressed the inclination 
to return the money he had given her, at a
cost she was far from suspecting. She looked at the
expression of his face. His brow was knitted, and
his lips pale and compressed.</p>

<p>Nothing, save the knowledge of the use she intended 
to make of that money, prevented her from
flinging it on the floor. She could not explain her
need, and she fancied that she was utterly misunderstood. 
As for Aubrey, poor fellow, in reality no mean
and ungenerous thought entered his head. He only
thought of the reality of his position, and acted as if
she knew it nearly as well as himself. Whereas, it
never occurred to her that he was not at least still
master of thousands. Then the full appreciation of
the wounded feeling and stern determination of
Blanche recurred to her mind. She walked up to

<!-- vol 2 page 366 -->

Aubrey, and placed her small ungloved hand in his.
He shuddered at the contact. The action and the
touch reminded him of Blanche. So he did not
return the warm pressure of her fingers.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Aubrey," she said; "I will not
thank you again. I don't mean to ask you for more
money, I assure you. This is ample for my purpose.
I don't mean ever to encroach on you any more. I
know you are not so rich as you were. At least, I have
heard so. You have behaved most generously, and
you will not repent it. It is for a sacred purpose, I
assure you."</p>

<p>Aubrey muttered something in return, and mechanically 
accompanied her to the street-door. In giving
the money so needed by himself, he had obeyed rather
a habit, an old instinct of his nature, when he was
still comparatively rich. His act resembled Timon's
profuseness at his penultimate banquet, before he
sent out to borrow a little cash from his toadies and
parasites. He had not realised his position. What
man knows poverty, till he tries it? He may see it
daily and all its evil effects, its curses, sorrows, contumely, 
and squalor. He may inquire into it, fill a
Blue Book with the result of his researches, pen a
beautiful essay upon it, dramatise it, or write a novel
upon it, but he must feel it, before he can know it.
The imagination may easily picture the delights of
wealth; but utterly fails to sound the infinite depths
of want. No man knows the world thoroughly, who
has not been poor. A doctor might as well say that
he knew the pains of childbirth, or a sound and
healthy lithotomist that he was perfectly acquainted

<!-- vol 2 page 367 -->

with the agony of the disease called the stone, as an
essayist or philosopher profess to be acquainted with
the personal humiliations, miseries, and deprivations
of poverty. We see a beggar in the street, and if
we have ever known what it is to be cold and hungry,
we can form some idea of what he suffers in that
respect; but if he has seen better days, can we realise
the fierce crowd of resentments gnawing his heart
like rats, his mistrust of Providence, his hatred of
his fellow-men; as he obeys the stern edict of "move
on;" as he experiences the dreadful condemnation of
"hit him hard, he has no friends;" as he crawls forth
a moral leper in the great and busy world, without
even a friend in the same condition as himself? For
there is no fellowship for the broken-down man.
Thieves have their consorts, cadgers their associates,
impostors their mates; but the human being struck
off the roll of prosperity is alone; i.e., unless his
misery is enhanced, and his affliction multiplied and
intensified by the haggard looks of a family sinking
in the cold and remorseless waters around. We say,
that he who has not personally felt the abandonment
and condemnation, the kicks and cuffs, and oaths and
sneers of the world, knows absolutely nothing of the
pangs of want. If Shakespeare himself knew them,
there must have been a period when he was penniless
and in despair.</p>

<p>The great and absorbing sorrow of Arthur Aubrey
as yet kept him from the thought or appreciation of
minor cares. Nor had the time come for him to
know poverty, to read the wrinkled anguish of her
face in the reflection of his own countenance mirrored 

<!-- vol 2 page 368 -->

in passing some gilder's shop. When, therefore, 
the street-door had shut upon the philanthropical
Miss Dareall, and he exclaimed&mdash;somewhat theatrically, 
it will be said&mdash;"Now, Blanche, thou are
avenged! Now, Ruin! I look thee in the face, without 
the means to fly from shame, degradation, torture.
I have nought save myself to rely on&mdash;these shattered
energies and neglected talents to begin life anew,
and to support existence"&mdash;it meant in reality very
little, i.e., he meant a great deal; but was not in a
position to realise and appreciate what he said. He
thought that he was entering upon a stern campaign,
that he was vowed to labour and high resolve, that
he was henceforth doomed to work honourably, and
it might be struggle hard for a maintenance. But
he did not at all contemplate the ragged necessity,
the forlorn despair, the squalid break-down, the seedy
pauperism which might be his doom. The Nemesis
he invoked upon his own head was not even threadbare&mdash;much 
less arrayed from a rag-shop; wearing
the likeness of the blear-eyed hag known to the
pawnbroker, who snatches the unfinished shirt and
the flat-iron from the trembling hands of impoverished
toil&mdash;his was a genteel Nemesis, holding an official
position, writing successful dramas in an interesting
way, penning stories for magazines, and publishing
the poetry of grief at a guinea and a half a page&mdash;not 
the spectre of the dark arch, the beldam of the
casual ward. If he had been able to pierce through
the cold and misty veil of the future, and to recognise
the features of the Nemesis who awaited him, it is
not very probable that he would have accepted the

<!-- vol 2 page 369 -->

wager of battle with a new life, but rather have
yielded the contest at once and ended a misspent existence 
by a guilty death. But we must not anticipate
our tale. This much is certain. If a man could
apportion his own punishment in this world, he would
often pronounce a very impressive condemnation,
ending with a sentence quite inadequate to the burden
of his speech. His judicial performance would resemble 
that of the late celebrated Mr. Justice Maule,
when addressing a poor man who had been found
guilty of the crime of bigamy, under the old divorce
laws. That gifted judge spoke something to the following 
effect:</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar! you have been found guilty
by a jury of your countrymen of a dire and grievous
offence against morality, society, and the laws of the
land. I am here to represent the majesty of the law,
which you have violated. You may plead poverty,
ignorance, provocation, temptation, and even necessity&mdash;I 
have nothing to do with that. You say that
your first wife was drunken, and a thief; that she
pawned your property, neglected and beat your
children, assaulted and disgraced you, made a hell of
your home, and finally abandoned you for another
man. All this the law does not consider in the
slightest degree. You should have sought the remedies 
which the law provides. You should have
brought an action for crim. con., which might have
cost you a thousand pounds. You should then
have had recourse to the Ecclesiastical Court, where
you might have succeeded, probably, at the cost
of another thousand pounds. Thence, you had the

<!-- vol 2 page 370 -->

option of appealing to the highest tribunal in the
country, the House of Lords, in order to free you
entirely from the meshes of the drunken, thievish,
and adulterous shrew, whom you had the folly or
misfortune to make your wife. This might have
cost you some three thousand pounds more. Thus,
for five thousand pounds you might have obtained
a divorce by the legal means which the justice of
England places at your disposal. True, you are
a labouring man, and I understand your wages
amount to an average of eighteen shillings a week,
out of which you maintain in a clean and creditable
manner, as you are bound to do, the issue of your
first and legal marriage, as well as the offspring of
the wicked and adulterous connexion which you have
formed. Prisoner at the bar! you have broken the laws
of your country, and have been found guilty very
properly of a heinous and atrocious offence, striking,
as I may say, at the root of everything that is sacred
in the social relations of Christian and civilised life.
You have committed a crime, which, were it to become 
general, would rend every domestic relation
and tie, and in so doing you have scorned to avail
yourself of the opportunity of legal emancipation
provided by the merciful consideration of the great
lawgivers and makers of the land. I shall, therefore, 
sentence you with that due severity, and the
exercise of that impartial justice, which I am here to
interpret and uphold, and which the monstrous nature
of your offence demands. The sentence of the Court
is, that you be imprisoned for one day!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 371 -->

<p>Justly or unjustly, in the spirit of the learned
judge, or in that of a blind and selfish condonation
of guilt, we apprehend that were men to pronounce
their own condemnation and sentence in this world,
there would be a similar discrepancy between their
language and their acts.</p>

<p class="small">DE OMNIBUS REBUS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">There are no "extenuating circumstances" in English "Law" and
"Justice." There are, perhaps, too many in French. The English girl
who spends five shillings of her paramour's money, the man with whom
she has lived as wife, and who is given by the ruffian in charge, gets eight
months' hard labour, is utterly disowned by her own prosperous kindred,
though she has been cast upon the world in childhood, and is told by
the "worthy" judge, that within his recollection she would have been
hanged for such an offence. No folly of the heart, no offence of the
passions, is lightly dealt with; but the cunning guilt of the brain finds
friends and apologists everywhere. There is, at this moment, a subscription 
set afloat for a vendor of spurious curiosities, twice convicted
of theft, to enable him to turn his "abilities" to a better account! A
woman prosecutes her betrayer, the father of her five children, who is
rich, and is told that her punishment is the fruit of her immoral connexion 
with him. We are only surprised that he was not accommodated 
with a seat on the bench. No one breathes a word of admonition
to him.&mdash;<i>Modern Observations. By an old Law Student</i>.</p>

<p>IN the evening Tops and the "man in possession,"
who had become strict allies, had their promised
pipe and glass of hot gin-and-water together in the
now vacated pantry of the illustrious Binsby. Alas!
Could that great man have known to what base uses
that sanctum of crested silver and armorial lore would
shortly come, he would have been more shocked in
anticipation, than ever he was by the ruin to which
his "parveynoo chief," as he called him, had come.
"It's my hown fault," he would say, "for entering

<!-- vol 2 page 373 -->

into such a connexion. To be sure, I thought he was
one of the Aubreys of Yorkshire&mdash;and his father was
honly a merchant in the City!" To do him justice,
he never said a word against Blanche. But then in
all the noble families of his acquaintance, there had
been "hinstances of females ennobled by marridge,"
as he said. On this very evening, Mr. Binsby called
to inquire after something he had left behind; and
his horror at beholding the Downy seated on a stool
smoking a short clay in the place so lately sacred to
Binsbian dignity and aspirations was commensurate
with his magnificent proportions. That worthy
"twigged him," to use his own expression, at a
glance.</p>

<p>"Vell, hold Banting!" he said, "wot's your horders?
The Collidge of Phisichuns has sent you hout for a
constitooshinal precious late this evenink."</p>

<p>The sole answer vouchsafed was a look which fell
far short of its intention. It was as if Jove had
hurled some sheet lightning supplied in place of the
real forked article by an official mistake of his War
Department, at some uncommonly petty offender.
There sat the Downy still grinning, and perfectly
unabashed.</p>

<p>"I was not aweer," said Mr. Binsby, "that the
streets was turned inside of this hestablishment."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think it was much as you did know,"
answered the Downy. "There ain't room for it.
You're stuffed too full of himportance, hold feller!"</p>

<p>"I shall be obleeged to you, whoever you are, to
keep your remarks, until they are called for," retorted
Binsby.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 374 -->

<p>"Didn't yer call?" asked the Downy. "Then
perhaps it was a homlibus as I heerd a rumblin'.
Come, don't bust till yer wanted, vich is wot the
horphan drummer-boy said to the unhexploded shell,
ven he poured a bottle of fish sarce into it."</p>

<p>Mr. Binsby proceeded to tie up a small bundle of
the property which he had left behind him, consisting
of a clothes-brush, a shilling "Peerage," a cotton
night-cap, and a few other similar articles, in a large
yellow silk "handkercher," as he himself would have
called it.</p>

<p>" 'Ave a winkle?" said the Downy. "Do, hold
chap, and make yerself at home. Yer don't 'appen
to 'ave a largish-sized pin among them miscyllanious
hodds and hends of yourn, do you?"</p>

<p>And he rolled a specimen of that plebeian "fruit
of the sea" along the pantry dresser to the great man,
who allowed it to drop on the floor, and then kicked
it slowly back towards the Downy.</p>

<p>"That's wot yer calls perliteness, I suppose," continued 
his remorseless tormentor. "Your parients
never paid nothink to teach you manners. I'll jest
tell yer wot it is. I've a great mind not to let you
take them things hout of this house, just to teach yer
to be civil."</p>

<p>And the Downy suiting the action to the word,
actually walked up to Mr. Binsby, snatched the parcel
from his fubsy hands, and threw it on the floor by
the rejected winkle. What might have occurred we
are unable to state; but fortunately at that moment
Tops entered the pantry, and made peace between
the representatives of outward and inward vulgarity,

<!-- vol 2 page 375 -->

which he achieved with considerable adroitness. Yet
for a butler, Mr. Binsby was in reality much more
of a gentleman than many a person with a banker's
account, who would make but a dishonest and disreputable 
butler. Look at that bloated and pompous
pest "Major" Bragman, whose chief triumph in life
was to break up a West-end club to which he unfortunately 
belonged, and who endeavoured to perform
a similar service to a Volunteer corps, in which he got
a commission by carefully disguising his real temper
and antecedents. Some years ago he was a noted
black-leg and card-sharper, and after a "prosperous"
career of swindling at home and abroad, reappeared 
in "Society," where, by the most patient
toadyism, he got a sort of footing, and talked about
his friend Lord Fitzfoodle, and "my bankers the
Robinsons," to every one whom he met. What odious
vulgarity of this kind will not Society endure, when
it "smells" of real or assumed property! Besides,
few like to meddle with malignity and miscrupulousness, 
and so every one goes on wondering why some
one else does not "kick the fellow out of the club,
sir, by Jove." Yes, there are plenty of Major Bragmans 
about, better tolerated than men of true courage
and far higher pretensions, who are not gifted with
the attributes of the skunk and the jackal, the
cowardly hyena, and the venomous snake.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Tops, after Mr. Binsby had departed 
on friendly terms, actually smiling a lofty
smile, when the Downy asked him for a song, and
listening with apparent complacency to the admonitions 
bestowed on him to be sure and button up his

<!-- vol 2 page 376 -->

coat and take care of his precious health for the sake
of his fellow-creatures and an admiring public&mdash;"now 
then, let's have one of them stories of yourn
as yer was a telling me of, when that lady in a veil
called to see master."</p>

<p>The Downy seemed awhile plunged in deep reflection.</p>

<p>"Does that chap ever go in the water? I mean,
does he hever take a bath?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say exactly," replied Tops; "I fancy
he do sometimes. Whatever do you want to know
that for?"</p>

<p>"Vy," replied the Downy, very gravely, as if the
subject demanded it, "if he do, there might be a
wacancy when the hipperpotamouse can't come to
time. It's my hopinion a hungrateful country don't
know that man's desserts. He oughter 'ave nothink
wotever to do but to 'elp the Speaker of the 'Ouse
of Commins to port wine. That's my noshun of
his nateral horfice, and the werry next time there's
a Cabynit Council, I means to speak about it, that's
hall."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "for my part, I don't see why
he shouldn't be Speaker hisself, and pour out his
own port wine. I dessay there's been a many not so
good-looking; and a many as couldn't do the dooties
half so well. But I want to hear this story, as soon
as I've lit this pipe."</p>

<p>"Vell," said the Downy, "I knowed a man vunce
as drove a bus for fifteen year, as cum hinto a matter
of four hundred pound, as he'd bin hexpectin' of
all that time, through the death of a hannuitant,

<!-- vol 2 page 377 -->

as might have been backed heavy to die the werry
fust year as the money was left in rewersion, as the
lawyers said. Vell, she went on a living out of sheer
spite, and he went on a driving like a monyment of
patience in a drab coat on the box, till she was so
weak, you'd have thought she hadn't strength left
in her to go through the sairymony of dying. Vell,
that man was werry reg'lar in his habits, and he said
werry little to any one; and all he did was to put a
bit of crape on his whip, the day of the funeral, and
he give notice to his employers to leave in a month.
The last Saturday night of the month he finished up
as usual, and made a present of his capes to a waterman 
as was a pertickler friend, and give his rug to
another coachman on the road, and treated hall on
the line he travelled, as could come, to a supper and
drink, and went home, and found his wife had bolted
with a Bobby, and gone clean off to Amerikey,
with hall the money, and sold the furniture besides.
No vun see him on the Sunday; but on the Monday
he come back and asked to be put on the road again;
but the properiators said they wos werry sorry his
place was filled hup. It was a pouring wet day,
and old George Adams, as used to drive the Liverpool 
mail, asked him to take a drop of something
warm, for his teeth were a chattering in his head.
'Bill,' says the conductor of his own bus, who come
in for three-pennorth, 'whatever 'ave yon done with
your hair? You've been a powdering it, sure-ly!'
'No,' says he, 'I han't; but,' he says, whispering
quite loud, 'I've been a dying of it these fifteen year,
that's what I 'ave, and last Saturday night the dye

<!-- vol 2 page 378 -->

come off.' George winked at the conductor, and the
conductor looked werry grave at him. 'It's my opinion,' 
says he, 'that he's hoff his 'ead. It's hall
along of that money;' for they didn't know what 'ad
happened to him then. Vell, they left him there, and
he went out talking about the world coming to a
hend, as if he'd been a hearing the Reverend Spurgin,
the celibrated preacher as keeps a private shofel,
which is worry likely wot he'd been a doing of on
the Sunday, you see. And hoff his 'ead he were;
for he mistook the canal for the wet road on his way
someveres that night in a hopposite direction from
home, and a coroner's jury brought in a werdict of
haccidental 'omicide through grief at his wife's miscondict."</p>

<p>"There's a sight of rum things even in the bus line,"
resumed the Downy after a brief pause. "I knowed
a coachman as druv a bus to Norwood, as wos fell in
love with by a real tip-top lady, and ven he'd knowed
her some time, she broke an happintment, and he
never clapped heyes on her for seventeen year.
He was a werry fine stout man, and grew quite
melincolly, and ven the passingers thought he wos
lookin' for fares, he wos a lookin' for vun sure
enough. Vell, he pulls hup vun day at the 'Pig and
Tinderbox,' and there she wos, and a nice-lookin'
youth standin' by her side. He throws the reins
down in a jiffy, and hoff he gets. 'You've been a
long time keepin' that happintment, ma'am,' says he,
werry respectful. 'Yes, I 'ave, coachman,' says she.
With that she inwited him in werry perlitely, and
hordered a bottle of port wine, and sends the youth

<!-- vol 2 page 379 -->

hout to smoke a Cuba, and look at the bill of the
play. 'Coachman,' says she, 'I've a secret to tell
you.' 'Thank ye, ma'am,' says he. 'You've been
a long time a thinkin' on it.' 'That boy is your
son,' says she, takin' no notice of his hobserwation,
no more than if he hadn't made it. He wos a werry
strong man; but, as he said arterwards, 'he was
never nearer faintin' in his life.' Vell, she told him
that the young gent was heir to a large fortin', and
she made him a 'andsome present, and promised to
meet him next week; but he never set eyes on
her agen; and he grew more stout and melincolly
every day, and took to drink, ven he'd tell this 'ere
story of hisn to any vun as vould listen to him; and
venever he see a perticlarly fine-drest middle-aged
female, he'd drive on quite sudden, vether a passinger 
wos gettin' in or hout, it didn't matter to
him. Till vun day he got more hexcited than usual,
and fell hoff the box in a fit of appleplexy, just vere
he fust met that party as 'ad been his ruin like
hentirely."</p>

<p>This is but humble romance in real life. For
romance in all its phases, but without poetical utterance, 
was there ever anything like the tangled skein
of the nineteenth century, wherein lords become
beggars, and even Sir Bernard Burke loses their
identification and history in the backwood, the sheep-walk, 
the kennel, and the slum; wherein "shoddy"
and "villainy" rise to sudden pre-eminence among
men; wherein the great mob of a great city opens
and closes upon the living, as the waves close over
the dead; wherein no commercial house or bank is

<!-- vol 2 page 380 -->

safe, and there is scarcely a character above suspicion;
wherein there is opportunity for every woman to
deceive her lover or her husband; every rogue to
succeed in life, if he be only rogue enough and
fortune smile&mdash;an age of heroism among the small,
and littleness among the great; an age so mixed,
confused, so alloyed with every metal, that it is
neither gold nor iron, brass, nickel, nor even tin;
an age which falsehood and hypocrisy have marked
for their own to such an extent, that the multitude
follow a false cry and worship a false idol, knowing
them to be false, and despising in their inmost souls
that which they openly profess to reverence and
adore? "But have we not the Press?" cries one.
"Is it not," may be answered, "the safety-valve
of indignation, rather than the guardian of public
morality?" In these days we satisfy ourselves with
calling names. We suffer a minister to be accused
of ignominy and treason, and then pronounce him a
necessity to the State, as if the nation could not
possibly survive him when he is dead. The lawyers
thrust their tongues in their cheeks, whilst they tell
anecdotes affecting the probity of a judge, yet he
continues to dispense justice or injustice over the
land. Some of our generals and admirals wear decorations 
as a reward of their diplomatic discretion,
rather than their valorous deeds; and journalism is
not silent thereon, and thereby only enhances the
disgrace. We have seen the whole force of public
opinion brought to bear against a nobleman or a contractor 
in vain. There are cases when the gold armour-plates 
are sufficient to resist the heaviest cannonade,

<!-- vol 2 page 381 -->

and when the smoke dies away the vessel floats uninjured, 
with the signal of piety at the fore.</p>

<p>In the midst of all, a spasmodic jubilee hails the
completion of a telegraphic cable, as if the instantaneous 
transmission of a lie were worth the slowest
truth that ever sailed in a three-decker from land to
land. After all, is it a better or a worse age than
any that has gone before? It would be difficult to
answer. Probably the world, represented by its
leading nations&mdash;those that make and leave the
history of the period&mdash;is good, bad, or indifferent, by
turns. We are not so depraved now as the Romans
under the Empire! Instead of torturing thousands
of human beings and animals in an Amphitheatre,
we starve thousands of men, women, and children, or
allow them to starve in our streets and fields, ditches
and byways, and we keep our wild beasts on excellent
fare in our Zoological Gardens. There is a refuge
for homeless dogs, where no labour is exacted in
return, and no questions asked; and enlightened
humanity, in the most popular of our newspapers,
writing up to the demand and spirit of the period,
weeps tears of ink over the sufferings of a rat, worried 
by a terrier, and invokes legislation to put an
end to such cruel sport. Yet the omnibus driver
works fifteen or even sixteen hours out of the twenty-four, 
unpitied, to die of acute rheumatism, or end
his uncomfortable days in the workhouse. The bones
of the English child are literally ground to supply
the luxuries of the rich. There is no pity for
poverty, no mercy on want-compelled crime. Look
at the ostentatious livery of charity worn by those

<!-- vol 2 page 382 -->

yellow-legged, bare-headed schoolboys. The close-cropped 
little fellows wear neither caps nor hats; because 
they are poor, the children of poverty, and
ought to be humble.</p>

<p>They are in a chronic state of reverence for the
magnificent bounty of their superiors, and suffer ear-ache 
and consequent deafness in after life. Sometimes 
it hardens, and sometimes it kills. We believe
that the ugliness of the dress prescribed by a noble
Charity, actually influences the physical looks of the
wearers, and makes the poor youths ugly, awkward,
and angular. Lately, one of these lads got as far as
Paris by means of a cheap excursion, and was taken
for a Japanese. We saw a couple of hundred this
afternoon on their way to return thanks somewhere
for the blessings heaped upon them. Poor lads,
they could not uncover their heads on entering the
church! All the thanksgiving must have been taken
out of them long before. We can fancy what hard
unforgiving wretches those of them who grow up and
succeed in life must become. We know the case of
a girl brought up at an orphan school, where, she said,
the sickly ones died and were buried. That is the
least expensive way of providing for orphans, next to a
Chinese baby tower. This girl was of a strong and
robust constitution, and so escaped the cheaper alternative; 
but she did not look healthy, when she came
out. Her body was like a huge corn, or chilblain; her
soul was a cowering wild-beast driven in by the spiritual
hunters to gnash its teeth in darkness among thorns.
When she came out of the asylum, she was a liar and

<!-- vol 2 page 383 -->

a thief, a sceptic as to all good, and somewhat of an
actuary in contemplated evil. She would calculate
to a nicety all the chances of being found out. This
creature by chance went to live with an eccentric
couple who believed in the Supreme Being, but who
were not formalists in their mode of worship. They
were kind to her; and at first she was puzzled, then
dubious, then astonished, and finally a sensation stole
into her heart. From that time, she became humanised. 
She ceased to torture flies, and pinch the
baby. She found herself abstaining from drinking
the beer, on her way from the public-house. She
no longer cut tid-bits from the meat and stole the
gravy, and defiled the dishes out of spite. She
ceased to make faces on the stairs before she came
in, and told something very like the truth one evening 
when she stayed out late. This went on, until
one day on being reproved, she cried. Upon this her
master said to her mistress, "My dear, I have hopes
of that girl."</p>

<p>One day her mistress encouraged a little confidence, 
and the girl said,</p>

<p>"If you please, mum, I've tried very hard to be
good, and I think I am beginning to like it a little.
I was very wicked, when I came here. It was all
along of the asylum. All the good girls died there,
and I wanted to live; and you see, mum, I was
always very strong. They never spoke a kind word,
and the prayers seemed so long and harsh. I hated
everybody when I came out, and even my health
and spirits was beginning to give in. I used to think

<!-- vol 2 page 384 -->

how wicked I should like to be, when I was put out
to service. It was all along of too much Christian
teaching, and no Christian kindness. 'If this is
goodness,' I used to say to the biggest girls, 'let's be
wicked,' and so we were. There was hardly a girl
that came out of that school but has turned out bad,
and so should I, if I hadn't come here."</p>

<p>All this is characteristic and true. We put the
livery of servitude and degradation on orphan boys;
and what person gifted with a generous nature ever
looked at an orphan girls' school out for a walk,
whom the sight did not depress and make sad? So
small, and pale, and bony, and "humble," and clean.
No making of mud pies there! No joyous laughter,
no dirty pinafores, no tangled hair! Hair? It is
all cut short. What should they do with that ornament 
of girlhood? They couldn't raise a laugh
among the lot. They would eat plum-cake as if it
were a duty, and carry an orange like a sampler,
without even smelling at it. Is it possible that so
many children can be ugly; that so many have large
ears and coarse arms, when they are not lean and
scraggy? And what is the consequence? When
they grow up, the large majority become pilferers
and dishonest servants; and the small minority, who
are not frightful, in spite of everything, take to the
streets.</p>

<p>The tender and the sensitive perish under the utilitarian 
grindstone; their souls will not fit into the
dry, little arithmetical posture-frames assigned to
them. They cease to be numbers, and become, let

<!-- vol 2 page 385 -->

us hope, angels with names. They die, one by one,
and do not walk two and two in Heaven!</p>

<p>How the survivors must hate somehow and somewhere, 
in the deepest recesses of their little twilight
understandings, their pastors, and masters, and mistresses, 
and the clergy, and the Bible, and the Prayer
Book. For these books are made especially terrible
to them&mdash;the one means punishment, and the other
restraint. Yet the Divine Teacher of Teachers said,
"Suffer little children to come unto me!" Alas! he
meant children, and not little old men and women,
whose separate identities are lost in the uniformity of
barren rule, who all awake together at six, and step
out of bed like automata, and have the same square
inch of appetite, the same gill measure of thirst; the
breathing mannikins of a toy Noah's Ark; a very
serious toy, not exactly meant for play, but grimmest
earnest.</p>

<p>We once knew a brute in human shape, who took
a kitten and cut off its ears and tail, and put a collar
on it, and gave it gin in its milk, and called it by a
comical name. When the human brute was in his
cups, he would sit and laugh at the quaint antics of
this perverted creature. No one even laughs at
charity children. The very comicality of their dress
is serious enough in the accustomed British eye. A
foreigner might laugh at the yellow legs of a Blue-coat 
boy, or the Quaker-like appearance of female
children taught that the very air which they breathe
is composed of charitable oxygen, and who never
had a doll among them in their existences; but his

<!-- vol 2 page 386 -->

laugh soon subsides into a smile of derision or pity&mdash;according 
to the heart of the man.</p>

<p>"A magnificent charitable institution, sir," cries
John Bull, who has just eaten the dinner of an ogre,
over which the shortest possible grace has been said.</p>

<p>After all, consider the street children, the infant
population of the alley and back slum, the "caten-wheeling" 
Arab, the orphan with both parents alive,
the offspring of incest, who "never had no mother,"
because he is the child of "aunt." Is not "order"
an improvement on this? We can hardly pronounce.
It is the choice between the surviving hypocrite and
the surviving ruffian, between Jacob and Esau, between 
the man who lives to adulterate food and
swindle with legal precautions, and the predatory
vagabond, who probably would not rob, if he could
manage to live comfortably without it. Again, if
one thing is wrong, it does not always necessarily
make another right.</p>

<p>The thief in the dock may deserve his sentence&mdash;say 
two years' imprisonment&mdash;but the Counsel who
prosecuted him may merit ten, the Attorney who
prepared the brief fifteen, and the Judge penal servitude 
for life. There might be a case, easily imagined, 
where such an apportionment would be in
strict accordance with true justice.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is not our intention, at present, to trace the
ruined fortunes of Arthur Aubrey for any long
period. He disappeared at once from Society. Those

<!-- vol 2 page 388 -->

of his great friends who did not cut him, he himself
cut, either from pride or the apprehension that they
would take the initiative. One day he met the good-natured 
Lord Madeiraville, who would have got him
a post had he been applied to, and who was about to
shake him by the hand. But Aubrey had already,
within two or three months, become shabby in his
apparel; and he looked at the nobleman with the
aspect of a scared wolf, and crossed the street.
Shabbiness in the first degree, when a man begins
with truth to think that he is not altogether well
dressed, does not at all interfere with the aspirations 
of literature, and Aubrey had already become
a literary man. Of this anon. We must first tell
how he fared when he left Queen's-square. It suited
Mr. Grinderby, for certain reasons of his own, that
Aubrey should escape the Insolvent Court, and as
he happened to owe very few small debts this was
easily effected. The fact is, that Grinderby had summoned 
the few tradesmen who were Aubrey's personal 
creditors, and had represented to them the state
of his affairs. Their claims did not amount to more
than two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>"Our client," said Grinderby, impressively, "is a
ruined man. He is no longer entitled to receive the
rents of his estates. The mortgagee has foreclosed,
and the whole property will be administered by
Chancery. If the estate can be preserved without
a sale, it will be done on behalf of the heirs of the
entail. The whole income will be applied to the
discharge of the debts, which are secured upon
the estate, and the gradual extinction of the mortgage, 

<!-- vol 2 page 389 -->

which our client ought to have paid off out of
the personalty on his father's demise." (This was not
true, as counsel had stated a contrary opinion.)
"There is not a farthing available out of the estate
for him. Our own claim on him for costs will barely
be satisfied out of the sale that is announced to take
place. In this state of things I have consulted my
partner, and we have come to the determination to
do what may be termed a very Quixotic thing. We
propose to be satisfied with only the part liquidation
of our own claim, and to offer eighteenpence in the
pound to the whole body of the creditors. My
partner, Mr. Cousens, was, as you may some of you
be aware, Mr. Aubrey's personal friend, and has insisted 
upon this liberal course. It is a gift of one
hundred and fifty pounds from the pockets of the
firm."</p>

<p>There was at first an angry murmur of surprise
and disgust at the state of affairs, then a period of
doubt, and finally approval of, and even applause at
the generous conduct of the firm. It ended in a
composition on the terms offered by Grinderby. There
then remained a sum of fifteen hundred pounds, or
thereabouts, due on bills which Aubrey had got discounted. 
These Grinderby refused to include, and
informed the holders that they would get nothing by
suing Aubrey. But ere long, when two or three
writs had been issued and judgments obtained, Mr.
Grinderby, with a vast show of generosity, purchased
the bills at about one-sixth of the nominal value,
and so held his late client in his power, to proceed to
execution when he pleased.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 390 -->

<p>It did not suit Mr. Grinderby to lock Aubrey up
then, or to make him insolvent. Perhaps he did not
wish that everything should become public; perhaps
he did not wish the management of Aubrey's affairs
by the firm to be ventilated too much. It was
through a female first cousin of Arthur Aubrey that
the bill was filed in Chancery, which dispossessed
him of his life estate.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Aubrey, in order acquire the fee-simple 
of a property adjoining his own, which belonged 
to his maternal aunt, and which brought her
in about five hundred pounds a-year, granted her
an annuity on his whole property of one thousand
pounds a-year for her life as an equivalent for a deed
of gift of the land, which he managed for her, and
which she always intended to leave him by will.
This he did some years before his own death, and at
a time when it was not considered likely that the old
lady would survive him&mdash;in fact, when her life was
not worth a month's purchase, much less a year's.
She lived, however, to a considerable age, and only
died a few months before the disappearance of
Blanche, and consequently of the events which we
are now endeavouring to narrate. The old lady
never spent more than four hundred pounds a-year
in her life; and thus Arthur Aubrey owed a very
heavy sum for the unpaid arrears of this annuity.
Had the original disposition of the old lady's property
remained undisturbed, Arthur would have owed these
arrears to himself; but on inheriting his father's
property, one of his cousins represented to him that,
owing to her husband's speculations and extravagance,

<!-- vol 2 page 391 -->

she and her children had nothing to live on but the
interest of that sum, and suggested to him what a
boon it would be to her as well as an act of justice, if
her name were substituted instead of his own, in the
will of this aged lady, who would obey any dictate
that came from him, her favourite and the darling of
her bed-ridden old age. To this Arthur, in his usual
Quixotic mood, at once assented, and a new will was
at once prepared and signed by the old lady, who
had only to be made to understand that it was his
wish, to execute it without hesitation.</p>

<p>"No one can now say, at any rate," said Arthur,
"that my attentions to my dear auntie are actuated
by mercenary views."</p>

<p>But it turned out a bad arrangement for him. The
old lady soon after fell into a state of complete imbecility, 
and lived on merely in a sort of vegetable
existence. During her remaining life another old
lady, a sister of hers, and also her husband, died and
left her all their property, which would otherwise
have come to Arthur, but was now irrevocably willed
away from him at his own dictation, and, as it were,
by his own act. About this he never expressed or
felt any regret. But when the invalid at length
ceased to exhibit any vital sign, and the poor shrunken
atomy, which was all that remained of her small
frame, had been lifted from her bed of feathers in
her pretty little house to her bed of mould in the
country churchyard, then the consequences of Arthur's 
act became very unpleasantly conspicuous in
the following manner. The arrears of the annuity
which he had not paid up, and which he ought to

<!-- vol 2 page 392 -->

have invested, amounted to a considerable sum. To
tell the truth, he had never thought much about
them, and when the matter did occur to him, he dismissed 
it with the reflection that he could always pay
the interest at five per cent., which would no doubt
suit his cousin just as well as if he paid the money
down. The fact is, he had never realised his true
position, and refused to look it in the face, until it
forced itself upon him as a very disagreeable fact.
His monstrous infatuation for Miss Dareall, his idle
habits and companions, his libertine recklessness,
and blind, unaccountable folly, had paralysed all
proper thought and action. He had never known
the value and importance of money&mdash;never reflected,
never reckoned, never kept accounts, never asked
himself, "Where will this end?" Such men pay a
fearful penalty, when the evil day comes. They
appear to reserve all their appreciation of the realities
of life until it is too late to be of any avail.</p>

<p>When the old lady, Miss Clementina Aubrey,
died, there was, as we said, a considerable arrear due
to Mrs. Wilkinson, Aubrey's cousin, in respect of the
arrears of the annuity of one thousand pounds a-year
secured by a bond upon the property, which did not
pass through Aubrey's hands. Whether Mrs. Wilkinson 
thought, and perhaps rightly, and with a sound
exercise of discretion, that if Aubrey were not forced
to pay the principal, the interest would not accrue very
regularly, or whether, as she declared more than once
with tears, she never thought of the possible consequences 
of the act which we are about to record, is
what we shall not pretend to determine. It would

<!-- vol 2 page 393 -->

be only gallant not to doubt any lady's word, and
only charitable to believe the affirmation of one
who read prayers with such becoming unction every
morning and evening to her assembled household,
with the exception of Thomas, the coachman and
gardener, the only person exempt from this tribute
to salvation, because he smelt so of the stable, and his
shoes were necessarily thick and dirty. It was a delightful 
thing to see the four maid-servants and a
country boy in buttons, with immense worsted gloves,
which he was ordered to keep in a drawer in the hall-table, 
listening to the instructive genealogies of the
Hebrew race, and how one unpronounceable name
begot another throughout a lengthy chapter, or how
the said Hebrew people killed man, woman, and child
in city after city of the tribes whom they successively
attacked. This mild mother of a family would dwell
with gushing fervour on the destruction of every
breathing thing, in reading these catalogues of old-world 
horror. Some chapters thus read were edifying 
in a different way. But the prayers put up by
this exemplary matron, and the earnestness of their
delivery, afforded the strongest contrast to the inner
thoughts, and feelings, and language of that model
family. Surely this mere form of daily worship, this
lip-service, which has no source in the heart, this
modulated phraseology, which means so much less
than nothing, is in reality but an insult to the Great
Being who sees all, even the self-deception of the
uncharitable soul. Poor Tummas! A pair of slippers
and an occasional bottle of eau-de-cologne might have
included thee in those blessings so touchingly invoked&mdash;might 

<!-- vol 2 page 394 -->

have made thee fit to hear how Israel
smote all the souls in Hazor with the edge of the
sword, and houghed the horses, and burnt all the
chariots thereof!</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, we feel persuaded that
Mrs. Wilkinson told the truth, when she affirmed in
the most solemn manner that she had no idea, in
assigning the bond debt owed to her by her cousin
and benefactor for a consideration to the country
solicitors, of whom we have before made mention,
that it would not only endanger that cousin's life
interest in the property, but actually cause his ruin.
These solicitors in due time demanded the money.
This led to a correspondence with Messrs. Grinderby
and Cousens. They, of course, made a great fuss
about the interests of their client, but declined to
give any undertaking that the interest on the bond
debt should be paid out of the rents of the life
estate. They named every contingency which might
arise, such as all the farms being untenanted at
once, and the possible general depreciation of land,
then greatly rising in value, and the amount of repairs 
that might be needed in one year. Then there
was always the possibility of an act of forfeiture on
the part of their client. Of course the country firm
knew their own interests best. There might arise a
question as to the validity of that bond debt if not
affirmed by Chancery, it was true. Still, if the others
would wait, it would save their client. After all this
harpy-like coquetry and grim rapacious dalliance,
during which the two representatives of the town
and country firms perfectly understood each other's

<!-- vol 2 page 395 -->

real intentions, the bill was finally drawn, and Messrs.
Grinderby and Cousens appointed by general consent
receivers for the Court, on the understanding that
the country firm should have certain local pickings
and emoluments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkinson wrote a beautiful letter to her
cousin, deploring her evil fate.</p>

<p>"I assure you," she said, "I would rather pay the
money out of my own pocket, were it in my power,
but unfortunately I cannot. You know how I am
situated. William's expenses at college have quite
crippled us of late, and John's commission money has
to be paid next year, and I am sure I don't know
how we shall manage; and clothing for the girls is so
expensive, besides dear Selina's music and German
lessons. I am sure, my dear Arthur, I would help
you if I could. With your talents, you cannot fail
to get some permanent employment. I should think
you could get a consulship, if you were only to ask,
and we would do anything in our power to help you
then. But at present it is impossible. If I had only
another thousand a-year, I would assist you with
pleasure. But His will be done!" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Arthur Aubrey saw no more of his kinswoman;
and she occasionally shed tears to all her friends on
account of her poor misguided cousin, with an equal
lachrymal apportionment of feeling truly gratifying
to witness, during a period of at least six months:
after which she only sighed and turned up her eyes
devotionally at the rare mention of his name.</p>

<p>And what became of Aubrey, as autumn came
and passed away, and the leaves fell and vanished,

<!-- vol 2 page 396 -->

the days shortened in the dreary November of that
year?</p>

<p>He did not stay long in Percy-street, where for six
weeks he lay on a bed of sickness hovering between
life and death, and nursed by the rough hands of the
devoted Tops, from whom Susan had parted to take
service, as she said, with a foreign lady going to
Milan and Rome. All the savings of Tops were soon
expended, diminished as they were by some unfortunate 
turf speculations, into which the poor fellow
plunged headlong, in the vain desire that he might
thereby set his old master on his legs. When Aubrey
got better, he tried hard to get literary employment.
But he was out of the "grooves," and couldn't succeed. 
In the days of his prosperity, he had contributed 
several unpaid communications to a morning
journal, which had created some little sensation at
the time. So he called on the editor, but was coldly
and sternly informed that the staff was complete.
Then he tried to get a play acted. It was full of
originality and power. In vain did he seek to recover
a copy which he enclosed to his old friend Methusalem
Wigster, of the Royal Thespis Theatre.</p>

<p>One weary night he received a note with that
manager's regrets to say that the piece was mislaid.
By the time he had recopied it, the principal incidents
had made their appearance at another theatre. He
could scarcely believe his own eyes and ears, when,
having strolled into the pit of one of the smaller
theatres, where a new and original drama had been
announced by an experienced playwright, he recognised 
all the chief points, and much of the dialogue

<!-- vol 2 page 397 -->

of his own play. A choking sense of indignation
oppressed him, and he felt inclined to get up and
denounce the theft to the audience aloud. But he
was depressed by want of money, and accepted the
utter helplessness of his situation, and went home
determined to take some proper action the next day.
He consulted a literary friend, an outsider, whose
acquaintance he had made in the parlour of a public-house 
in the Strand. That worthy inquired into the
circumstances, and said,</p>

<p>"I don't see what you can do. You tell me that
the dialogue is altered and the plot only partially
used. The piece, you say, is not published at Lacy's,
and I suppose it will not be. You must, therefore,
employ a shorthand writer, if you go to law, to take
down the exact words, and you can then see how
close the plagiarism is. But then, you tell me, you
did not keep a perfect copy. It is of no use to write
to the newspapers. If any of them, which is doubtful, 
inserted your letter, who would care for, or believe 
you? Why this very man, who has cribbed from
your play, has stolen in some way or other every
single piece which he has had represented. The first
was a well-known operetta, written by a school friend
of his own, who was then going into the Church,
and which was sent to this clever and unscrupulous
writer from the Continent to get it placed anonymously
on the stage. This he stole holus-bolus. The real
author could not well expose him, you see. Then there
was poor Bob Brown's famous drama, which came out
at the Parnassus. He was another old school chum
of Prigley's, and I read every line of his piece, before

<!-- vol 2 page 398 -->

Dick Prigley got him into his clutches. Prigley persuaded 
him to let him touch it up, do a little stage
business for it, you know, and it was to be brought
out under his auspices. Somehow Brown, a nervous
fellow, who drank very hard, but who was full of
genius, was persuaded not to go near the theatre on
the first night. I believe Prigley got some one to
entice him away and make him drunk. At any rate,
when the author was called for, Prigley bowed his
sole acknowledgment from a private box. The next
day Brown swore he would take his life; but somehow
he didn't. The spurious authorship was partially
contradicted in the newspapers, but all in vain. Brown
got delirium tremens soon after, and then, Prigley
managed to square the matter; for Brown was desperately 
hard up. Why, sir, the whole reputation of
that man is built up on similar transactions. How
he has escaped personal chastisement I don't know&mdash;perhaps 
he has not. Look at the career of Bustincraft 
Bouncer."</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Arthur. "Bustincraft did at least
write the 'Rogue's March of Intellect,' which you
will allow is a standard play in the language."</p>

<p>"So, I admit, it is generally thought," was the
reply, "and very few know the real history of that.
But I am one of those few, and I will tell you. Yes,
it is an admirable play; and I owned it puzzled me
to know how he had done it, though I had my
doubts. You remember old Judge Richardson, of
the 'Hole in the Wall,' do you not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Arthur; "but surely you don't
mean to say that he was the author?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 399 -->

<p>"I might fix on a less likely man," was the answer. 
"Richardson was a very clever fellow, full of
wit and humour, ay, and possessed of a very good
heart. He was one of the strange productions of
these times."</p>

<p>"I have heard," rejoined Arthur, "many excellent
traits of him; and yet he lived by pandering to obscenity 
and ribaldry, and prostituted his undoubted
talents in a shameless way."</p>

<p>"You mean he presided over the mock trials,
which were once so popular an entertainment.
Well, I don't know that they were conducted in a
manner much more reprehensible than our real
Courts, and then they were minus all the injustice,
real and false swearing, bullying, and Mammon-worship 
which characterise the latter. Well, sir, I
have known the Judge perform some kind, and even
noble actions. No man was at times more sensible
of the misery of his career than he. But what would
you have in these days? I tell you that some of our
managers have done far more harm to the public
morals than he? Look at the broughams at the
stage-door of the &mdash;&mdash;; the ladies who are engaged
at the &mdash;&mdash;; the performances at the &mdash;&mdash;, where
the manager sails as near the wind as he dares; the
dresses of the ballet at the &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c. At any
rate, poor old Richardson did not attempt to demoralise 
the minds of our wives, and sisters, and
daughters. Mind, I don't attempt to defend his
<i>m&eacute;tier;</i> nor did he."</p>

<p>"But about the authorship of the play?" inquired
Arthur.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 400 -->

<p>"Well," was the answer. "I met poor old
Richardson in the Strand one day apparently in a
great state of excitement. 'Holloa!' I said, 'what's
the matter now?'</p>

<p>" 'Has Heaven no special thunderbolts?' he answered, 
in his usual exaggerated tone.</p>

<p>" 'Come, come, old boy!' I replied, 'I think you
ought to be the last to complain.'</p>

<p>" 'Stuff!' he said, 'whom have <i>we</i> robbed and
plundered? Don't talk to me; I tell you I am in
earnest. You know I am sometimes. I cannot bear
to see such rascality flourish!'</p>

<p>"I soon perceived that he was not jesting, and I
asked him what had offended him so much.</p>

<p>" 'You know Bustincraft Bouncer?' he said.
'Well, I was standing at the corner of Wellington-street, 
when a carriage-and-pair&mdash;yes, sir, pair&mdash;passed 
me and splashed me, as you see, from head to
foot. Look at this mud, sir. Look at my shirt-front,
sir&mdash;it's all dickey with it, and I had not donned it a
half-hour. I looked up, as the vehicle of luxury
passed, and whom do you think I saw in it? Bustincraft, 
sir&mdash;the wretch Bustincraft, that ghoul, that
vampire, who lives on dead men's brains, ay, and the
brains of the living, when he can suck them with
impunity.'</p>

<p>" 'That's what you mean by calling him a vampire 
as well as a ghoul, I presume,' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Precisely, young man,' was the answer. 'I
thought of my poor friend Wimple, sir, dead and
buried; and if a look could have killed that wretch

<!-- vol 2 page 401 -->

Bustincraft, he would have been taken out of his
brougham as deaf to time as his victim&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And the judge relieved his feelings by an oath of
comic intensity.</p>

<p>" 'But what has Bustincraft done to this Wimple?'
I asked.</p>

<p>" 'Listen,' replied the judge. 'Wimple wrote two
or three successful trifles for the stage. He then
threw all he knew into the "Rogue's March," and
gave it to Bustincraft to read. He never was able to
get it back again, and Bustincraft at length declared
he had lost it in a cab. Poor Wimple had kept no
copy, and was dreadfully cut up. "I don't believe
he has lost it," he said to me one day. "Why did
he not say so at first?" Well, sir, Wimple lived too
fast, and got into sad trouble in the Government
office where he was employed. In fact, he made a
mistake, bolted, and went over to Boulogne. The
sum was so small, that if the foolish fellow had kept
out of the way, he would not have been wanted. But
he must needs come back to look after Bustincraft
and the play, on which he counted much. He
thought Bustincraft would be moved by his distress
and need. The day after his interview, he was arrested 
and committed to Newgate. I don't say that
Bustincraft gave the information; but I feel as certain 
of it, as I do that Judas Iscariot adapted "Mysteries" 
for the Jewish stage. Well, sir, poor little
Wimple took cold, and a rapid consumption set in.
He was but a sickly fellow at best. He managed to
see me, and begged me&mdash;knowing, as he was pleased
to say, that I had a good heart, to see Bustincraft

<!-- vol 2 page 402 -->

and get the play for him, if possible. "I have tried
to write it again," he said, "and can't. If I could
only get a hundred pounds for it," he said, "I could
be properly defended, and there are many extenuating
circumstances in my case." He then told me that
he had returned nearly all the money before the warrant 
was out for his apprehension. I saw Bustincraft, 
but I need not tell you that my mission was
vain. Little Wimple died in gaol before his trial
came on, and before six months were over, Bustincraft 
produced the piece as his own with triumphant
success. Do you wonder now at my rage when I
was splashed by such a transcendent villain, and that
I should ask why the bolts of Heaven sleep?'</p>

<p>"I owned that I did not. Now, my young friend,
this is the way in which dramatic success is too often
attained in the present day. Give up your original
authorship, if you want success on the stage, and
take to French adaptation and English annexation&mdash;that's 
my advice."</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens!" cried Arthur, "you don't
mean to say that this is the general state of things?"</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly," replied the other. "I know a
case where a young fellow sent a play to a manager
founded on a celebrated French drama, by no less
than three French authors. They do that sort of
thing in France, you know. Well, as usual, he
couldn't get it returned. The manager himself
brought it out fifteen years after, slightly transmogrified, 
and considerably spoilt by his own vulgarity 
and ignorance, as a perfectly new and original
drama by himself. He was not aware of the French

<!-- vol 2 page 403 -->

authorship, you see. The Press, of course, laughed
at his assertions when they found it out, as they soon
did, and the piece was withdrawn from the London
boards; but the honest man acted it frequently in the
provinces, and is now starring with it in Australia, as
I read in the 'Period' the other day."</p>

<p>"You astonish me," cried Arthur, with an accent
of despair. "But, come, there are some original plays
acted in the names of their bon&acirc; fide authors!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the other; "if Bulwer, or
Dickens, or Disraeli chose to write a play, any of
those well-known authors could insure its being placed
on the stage. There are three or four men who
cannot write fast enough, as it is. But look at
the sort of stuff that goes down with the aid of the
scene-painter! What I say is this, that the difficulties
in the way of an outsider are almost insuperable.
Are you a dramatic critic for a daily paper? No!
If you were, you would have a chance. As it is, the
more genius and originality you can boast, the less
your chance of success, and the greater the probability 
that you will only furnish stuff and suggestions 
for some daring playwright to work up into a
flagrant sensation piece. If your play is good, the
odds are that it will be completely worked out, and
if ever you should be enabled to produce it long
hereafter, through some means wholly irrespective of
your deserts, you will have to fight charges of
plagiarism from your own piece. When your playwrights 
get hold of a good idea, they don't leave it
in a hurry, I can tell you. When that new and
original French drama, stolen from my friend's

<!-- vol 2 page 404 -->

adaptation was produced, the first criticism that appeared 
in the 'Thunderbolt' was to the effect that
a well-known favourite English drama had suggested
its situations. No wonder, since that English play
of twenty years' standing was originally founded on
the French piece of 1837, or thereabouts. I tell you
the whole thing is rotten. It is a combination of
dishonesty, petty talent of approbation, cliquism,
and ignorance on the one side, and of bad taste and
want of appreciation on the other. If a thing is outrageously 
bad, the critics condemn it privately and
applaud it in whole columns of spasmodic eulogy in
the journals for which they write. Sometimes a
manager will thrust half a dozen manuscripts into
the hands of an acknowledged manufacturer, and
say, 'Write me a sensation piece for such and such
actors, and scenery.' But, stop! You told me that
your play touches earnestly and morally on the
'Social Evil,' one of the great newspaper topics of
the day, a thing our wives and daughters talk of
familiarly when they ask what 'Skittles' had on
yesterday, and the latest colour of 'Anonyma's'
hair. You say that it is written with a high moral
purpose. It won't do, I tell you. No manager will
touch it!"</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Arthur, "this is to strain out a
gnat and swallow a camel."</p>

<p>"I see," observed the other, lighting a fresh pipe,
"that you don't understand the peculiar modesty of
the British public, nor the peculiar scruples of its
caterers; and, faith, I don't think they understand it
themselves. The thing to be most avoided is an

<!-- vol 2 page 405 -->

earnest delineation of manners as they exist; and,
above all, you must never touch on dangerous
topics with a high purpose and a moral. You may
say and do what you please in a certain way; but be
sure, above all, that your object is to demoralise and
pollute the minds of the young, and pander to the
wickedness of the old in an airy and facetious style.
If you want to introduce the worst of harlots on the
stage, be sure that she is at the same time a wife.
Shock every sense in the promotion of vicious knowledge 
and ideas, but do not outrage a conventionality
in the sacred cause of virtue, otherwise you will
alarm your manager and horrify your public alike.
Not that I think so much harm of the public," he
said, musingly, "as I do of those who furnish the
entertainment. It is astonishing what will go down
if the scenery is good. I expect that by-and-by it
will come to writing for the scene-painters, and I am
not sure that the ingenuity of plots will lose by the
change."</p>

<p>"It is a sad state of things," said Aubrey, with a
sigh. "Why, I sent a five-act play only last week
to the very man, Prigley, of whom you have given
such an account. I knew him once. He used to
visit at a house where&mdash;I&mdash;was quite at home."</p>

<p>"I hope you kept a copy of it," said the other.
"If so, I advise you to get it cheaply printed, if you
set store by it, and get it entered at Stationers' Hall;
not that even such a step would be a complete protection, 
as he would swear he wrote it twenty years
before; and, what is more, the majority of the public,
who are fools and rogues, would believe him and not

<!-- vol 2 page 406 -->

you. It is astonishing what sympathy does in this
world."</p>

<p>"But this is infamous!" cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"Still it is true," rejoined the other. "This is not
the age of assassination in a physical sense; nor is
the mail stopped on Blackheath&mdash;to be sure, there is
none to stop. Villainy is spread fine; very fine, now-a-days. 
We shall return home to-night safer than
our forefathers did from robbers and murderers.
There is very little danger, if one gives a wide berth
to the Police."</p>

<p>"You take a dark view of things," was all poor
Arthur could get out.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," returned the other, "there are plenty
of actions which men openly avow in private among
friends, for which they ought to be hanged, sir,
hanged. To recur to managers. Look at that enterprising 
specimen, Mo Twitterly; who is no better
and no worse than the others. T'other night I was
sitting at Timpson's taking my solitary glass of
grog in the next box to him and two or three
of his friends. Little rosy-gilled Firkin, about the
only thoroughly manly, good-natured, straight-forward 
fellow among them all, who holds his place
by sheer force of wit and intellect, and the drollery
which makes him such a delightful companion, was
urging Twitterly to produce a certain piece.</p>

<p>" 'Come,' he said, 'you have had it these three
years; as I have told you, it is full of talent; it will
suit your company to a T. You know <i>I</i> have no
motive in recommending it, since, thank Heaven! I
don't care a dump for any of you managers or your

<!-- vol 2 page 407 -->

theatres, which might be burnt down to-morrow
for all I care. Come, come, Mo, give the poor
devil a chance, as soon as that last filthy French
adaptation, or abortion, you have brought over has
failed, as everything you produce does now. I say,
old fellow, how do you manage to keep your theatre
open at all? I tell you this drama of poor Whitmore's 
is the best thing I have read these ten years.
It will positively patch up the reputation of the
Apollo to produce it; and besides, as I told you, the
poor fellow who has written it is in a consumption
and starving in a garret.'</p>

<p>" 'I tell you I do mean to produce it,' growled
the great man, testily.</p>

<p>" 'Bravo!' cried little Firkin; 'that will be good
news for Whitmore. I'll step over and tell him to-night.'</p>

<p>" 'No, it won't. Stay where you are, and finish
your claret,' chuckled Twitterly. 'I didn't tell you
<i>when</i> I should do it. The fact is I am keeping it till
he dies!'</p>

<p>"And so he is, sir. What he said in jest, he meant
in earnest. When the time comes&mdash;that is, if he does
not ruin himself by greedy speculation before Whitmore 
shuffles off this mortal coil&mdash;you'll see what
an amount of benevolent capital he'll make out of
the widow and four children, in connexion with
the performance of this very piece. There never was
a more gushing old humbug than he is sometimes.
Why, he'll talk about the genius of 'our immortal
Will, gentlemen,' at a theatrical dinner, till he cries.
And the fellow, like the rest of his class, has not the

<!-- vol 2 page 408 -->

slightest appreciation of a poetical or a dramatical
idea. He is positively ignorant, illiterate, and is
just up to the interchange of the current commonplaces 
of stage slang and the stage requirements of
the day. But education is not of so much consequence, 
if men in his position were possessed only of
the instincts of art."</p>

<p>"May I ask," inquired Aubrey, "if you have ever
written a play?"</p>

<p>"You want to know if I am a disappointed
author," replied the other, smiling. "I can assure
you that, on the contrary, I have had a wonderful
success. I have written the pantomimes for the
Apollo these five-and-twenty years. I am dramatic
critic for the 'Weekly Regenerator' and&mdash;as, perhaps,
you know&mdash;law reporter in the Insolvent Court;
besides which I do an occasional article for a High
Church Review, and have chronicled the fights for
the 'Sporting Register' these fourteen years. But the
last is worth next to nothing now. The Ring, sir, like
the Stage and the Turf, is at its lowest ebb&mdash;on the
borders of extinction, I may say. Had I consulted
my own aspirations, I should not have gone into any
of these things; but it was a case of bread, sir; bread
for a large family. Besides, no one would be ass
enough to attempt to write for a lasting reputation in
the present day. Why, what were the Dark Ages
compared with an age of universal mediocrity? I'll
tell you what, the reputation of Shakespeare himself
may not be able to stand against it. A lot of young
fellows are discovering that he is a mistake, a traditional 
fluke. They speak with pity of him. The fact

<!-- vol 2 page 409 -->

is, they can make no more out of him for the purposes
of burlesque; and they say that they wish he and his
works could be buried by Act of Parliament for fifty
years to come. They laugh at the idea of a tercentenary, 
and vote him a bore. It is my opinion
that Shakespeare will be extinguished by a legion
of literary gents. How beautifully everything is
rounded in this world! As you know, many, if not
most of his plots and stories were founded on the
doggerel ballads of previous times. If you go to the
low music-halls, you will find them again reverting
to something like that use. Macbeth is transformed
into the Highlander of a tobacconist's shop, stabbing
Duncan with an umbrella, or a pane of glass. Shylock 
becomes a denizen of the Minories or Houndsditch, 
with a daughter of low habits, who 'prigs'
his tea-spoons to bestow them on an omnibus cad.
Othello is, of course, a nigger minstrel, who commits
a murder according to the popular perception and
taste, and would expiate it at the Old Bailey, if the
lady did not come to life, and dance 'Dusty Bob and
Sal' with her lord. All the subtle imagination, the
delicate thoughts, the finest creations of the Bard,
are degraded into familiar filth and slang; the pillage
of the Huns and Goths, the desecration of myriads
of barbarians, the very profanation of swine let loose
in the Temple of Apollo and the boudoir of the Muse,
were as nothing to <i>this</i>."</p>

<p>And the speaker dashed down his pipe on the
table and broke it; as if in corroboration of his judgment.</p>

<p>Arthur Aubrey shook hands with the cynic of the

<!-- vol 2 page 410 -->

"Blue Lion," and went home to his miserable lodging
a sadder and a wiser man. His route was nearly the
same as that trodden some three years before by
Lord Egbert and his companion, after the rencontre
at the Escurial. The descent of Aubrey to absolute
poverty was very rapid; so rapid that our description
of it may appear scarcely natural to our readers.
But it must be remembered that he was not like a
fraudulent bankrupt&mdash;he had made no mysterious
provision for his fall. He was stripped in a month,
nay, in a week, of everything. He had taken away
scarcely anything from the house. A portmanteau
full of clothes, his gold watch and chain, a diamond
ring, and one or two other less valuable trinkets, his
studs and pencil-case, and a few trifles chiefly connected 
with his wife, were literally all that he had in
the world. He had not feared poverty; because he
did not know it&mdash;had not felt it. He was rapidly
acquiring a lesson, which it is not well to learn late
in life&mdash;which it is not pleasant ever to learn. He
was still a member of the clubs to which he had
belonged, and would be so until the end of the year.
This was only of use to him, so far that letters still
reached him at the Kemble. But oh! that dreary correspondence. 
He had a couple of pensioners on his
bounty, when his income vanished, and these persons
agonised him with their appeals, their importunities
and reproaches. There was an old servant of the
family and his wife, who had both carried him in
their arms when a child. These gently reminded him
once or twice that there was an arrear of some months
due to them; for Arthur was never a very regular

<!-- vol 2 page 411 -->

paymaster. Poor souls! they did not know the
catastrophe that had befallen him. And Aubrey
manfully parted with his diamond ring, and sent
them fifteen pounds out of the proceeds, which was
half a year's allowance up to the Christmas of that
year. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, there
was a note from one of the other pensioners. This
was a different sort of an affair, in which Aubrey
had suffered his easy good-nature to be imposed upon
by an artful and designing woman, who had professed 
a romantic attachment for him some years
before, and who had worried, and bullied, and written
him into a sort of compromise, by which he purchased 
immunity from her persecution by a small
annuity. This wretched creature, who was maintained 
by three or four such contributors, and who
alternated between hysterics and violent threats,
when under the influence of gin, beset her contributaries' 
clubs and chambers with female friends, and
sometimes children bearing notes, who waited for an
answer to applications for immediate aid. She was
periodically very ill, and in a dying state. Imagine
the notes which she poured in upon Arthur, to whom
she always wrote, as if he had seduced her from the
path of virtue, and cruelly abandoned her. Sometimes
the postage of her notes was not paid. Then she
wrote, "I have not a penny in the world to buy
bread." At that time, her attention would, perhaps,
be divided between her epistle and basting a goose.
Her notes were always written in a detestably regular
female hand. The superscription could not be mistaken 
for a moment, and they were so scented with

<!-- vol 2 page 412 -->

patchouli that Arthur could tell, before he opened the
envelope in which the porter enclosed them to a post-office 
in Oxford-street, that there was one of those
hated documents within. As long as he could, he
sent something even to her. As if by some strange
fatality, pressing and piteous applications for charity
and aid poured in upon him in the first hours of his
own distress. A dear old professor of German, whom
he loved, and who had taught him to read Schiller
and Goethe, wrote to tell him of a fire by which he
had lost his all. A sick ballet-girl, whom he had
known in the days of her prosperity and pride, sent
him a heart-rending appeal. She was rheumatic and
starving.</p>

<p>"You would not know me, were you to see me,"
she said; "but think of me in your kind and generous 
heart as I once was, and I know my appeal will
not be in vain.</p>

<p>"P.S. My sister Ph&oelig;be is dead. She married a
scoundrel who broke her heart, and I am all alone."</p>

<p>Aubrey remembered these two beings, not so very
long ago, radiant with youth and beauty&mdash;creatures
who ought to have been in reality that which they
represented on the stage.</p>

<p>A bootmaker turned up, to whom Arthur owed
about twenty pounds in his father's lifetime, and
who had suddenly been forced to give np his business
and disappear, having entered into heavy security
for a friend. At the time, this man had written to
say he would call upon Mr. Aubrey for the money;
but, somehow, he never did, till the present time.</p>

<p>Now, if Mr. Aubrey would kindly leave him a

<!-- vol 2 page 413 -->

cheque for the amount, it would be his salvation.
Of course he had no legal claim, as it was more than
six years ago, but he knew that was all right
enough, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>All this was dreadfully galling to Aubrey. Why
had not this man applied for his money, when he,
Aubrey, was rich and could pay him? To be short,
there was no end to these painful contretemps. Why
does it happen so? Why does a rich man find it so
difficult to meet with cases of touching and real distress. 
We verily believe that one of the firm of
Rothschild, or Peabody, might go about London all
the evening with his pockets stuffed with gold, in
quest of deserving objects of charity and find none;
whereas a ruined gentleman is constantly stumbling
against families in affliction whom it lacerates his
heart to be unable to relieve&mdash;a broken honest tradesman 
in the sick ward of a workhouse; a pallid girl
working herself to death for a bedridden father,
who has known better days; a starving family of
orphans; a talented artist pledging his little scarce-finished 
"pot-boilers," to procure a meal, whom it
would be a luxury to assist, whom it is torture to be
unable to aid. What is the reason of it? Is it the
mere perversity of Fate? Does like draw to like?
Certain it is that it is only the poor that know how
the poor suffer, and who sympathise, if they cannot
relieve.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how completely and suddenly
Aubrey dropped out of the society in which he had
moved. It was marvellous how soon he came down
to poverty, which was anything but genteel; to wear

<!-- vol 2 page 414 -->

frayed linen and garments white at the seams, and
greasy in cuffs, collars, and braiding; to neglect his
personal appearance; to become acquainted with fried-fish 
suppers as a luxury, and sometimes to go supperless 
to bed. Before six months had passed, a
"swell" on horseback asked him to ring a door-bell,
and addressed him as "My good man!" He did not
look up. If he had, he would have recognised a
former flatterer and guest. He scowled and slunk
on. The equestrian said to himself, "This comes of
the incendiary, Bright. Some day we shall have
barricades." It must be added that Aubrey carefully
avoided the West-end.</p>

<p>"I cannot go through that street," said an extravagant 
Irishman one day. "The fact is, there is a
poor fellow, a tradesman there, who owes me money,
and I don't like to hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>We wonder whether Aubrey did not like to hurt
the feelings of his old acquaintances. He might certainly 
have done so, had he spoken to any of them in
Bond-street, or the Park. A gentleman out of luck
looks far worse than even an unprosperous mechanic,
or a tattered day labourer. As for Aubrey, who had
been so smart and dashing, a thoroughly well-dressed
young fellow in fact, he very shortly acquired an
appearance something between that of a billiard-marker, 
at least a year out of place, and a German
trombone-player, who had belonged to a minor
theatre lately burnt down. The truth is, he did not
know how to make the best of his slender means.
When he attempted to cook a chop, he would cover
himself with grease, which he did not understand

<!-- vol 2 page 415 -->

how to remove. His hat was never carefully brushed,
like that of one who has served an apprenticeship to
poverty. When the spring of the next year came, he
would only prowl forth in the evening. When summer 
came, his hours became even later. He still remitted 
something occasionally to his noisy annuitant&mdash;the 
old servant had, happily for them both, been
summoned to the still-room of death by a friendly
notice of paralysis. With a feeling of mixed justice
and pride, Aubrey gave the slip to Tops soon after
Christmas, leaving him a letter at his old lodgings,
over which the faithful fellow blubbered like a child.
This time the broken-down gentleman obtained a
lodging in Meard's-court, Dean-street, Soho, at four
shillings a-week, quite as much as his resources could
provide. Here he began a life of penury in earnest.
His slender stock of money had gone, long before his
illness was over. He never knew what Tops did for
him at that period, until that stud jewel of the
human race had ceased to minister to him in the
manner we have narrated. He took a base advantage
of his master's ignorance of the price of commodities&mdash;such 
as fowls, and mutton-chops, bread and coals,
groceries and potatoes&mdash;to cheat him in precisely an
inverse manner to that which servants, from the
Temple laundress to such personages as the great
Cakeman, are in the habit of adopting when they
do cheat. But Tops, to use his own phraseology, was
"beat" at last. In vain had he added his own remaining 
slender stock of money to the sum lent by
the pawnbroker on Arthur's gold repeater: the combined 
amount did not last long; for Tops would persist 

<!-- vol 2 page 416 -->

in purveying well for his master. "He's used
to it, and must have it," he would say. This was all
very fine, could the watch have been pledged again,
and could the money of Tops have been constantly
added. All at once Arthur found him out, and put
an end to the matter, as we have related. This time
he paid a visit to the "uncle" himself, and left a
ten-pound note in his farewell letter of thanks and
blessings.</p>

<p>Tops searched everywhere for him, whilst a shilling
of the money was left; and then took service as
general out-door servant with lawyer Grinderby, a
place which Susan had suggested to him on her departure.</p>

<p>Tops became wonderfully subdued ere long, in that
situation.</p>

<p>"It's a lesson to vanity," he used to say. "Besides, 
it's my dear Susan's fancy that I should 'ave
this innings in vice in a rellygious fammerly, while
she's gone furren. Honly I never thought I should
wear a second-hand uniform like this, with the tails
of the great-coat actially reaching down to my heels.
I'm to try and find out what I can about old Grinderby's 
games with the propperty. I honly wish I
could find out something as would be of use to my
poor guvernor as was; but it ain't very likely, unless 
this 'ere Grinderby was to leave his special
hagreemint with <i>his</i> guvemor below, in one of the
pockets of this mouldy old trap of hisn. I wonder
the wheels don't take fire, that's what I do."</p>

<p>And Mr. Grinderby's coachman would dash a
bucket of water over them with a violence which

<!-- vol 2 page 417 -->

seemed to express a conviction that nothing save
the utmost energy on his part could avert such a
catastrophe.</p>

<p>And how did Aubrey live? From a tragedy and
a first-class novel, he had come down to try tales and
padding for serials; he had sought literary employment 
of almost every kind, in vain. His efforts were
indefatigable&mdash;their results contemptible. There
were so many acknowledged padders at work. There
were scores of educated, half-educated, and uneducated 
hacks, busy in the Museum, doing cheap articles
out of forgotten books, or scribbling tales and stories
filched from that prolific source, American journalism,
which is decidedly inventive and original, chiefly in a
fifth-rate sort of way. Now and then he would pick
up a guinea or a guinea and a half from "Twice a
Fortnight," or "All the Week Old." But such success 
was very rare indeed. His articles, to tell the
truth, were generally far above the mark. He was
quite capable of writing for "Blackwood," or any of
the Quarterlies; only he could not get a hand in. He
was an outsider, and an unlucky one. In literature,
there are a few Tritons and many minnows. Every
man of genius does not necessarily become a Triton.
But when half a dozen names are told, the rest are
not worth much. The demand is very great for inferior 
stuff. The fact is that the spread of information
and education is in favour of the lowest class of
authors. Our literature is becoming Americanised,
without even the recommendation of American smartness. 
A commercial class of scribblers has sprung up.
When you meet them in a body, you would fancy that

<!-- vol 2 page 418 -->

you were in company with bagmen, not scholars.
Arthur Aubrey served no apprenticeship to this. He
saw men, for whom, intellectually and socially, as
scholars, gentlemen, and writers, he had the utmost
contempt, making their four or five hundred a-year,
and a little ephemeral fame of a certain kind. In
practical cleverness and successful trickery, he was
forced to confess they beat him hollow. No one would
read his novel. He had not made, and could not
make, a lucky hit. For a short time, he got on a
weekly paper, and did the books for a pound a week.
But one evening he wrote so clever an article on a
novel by a popular authoress of the day, with whom
the proprietor was on intimate terms, that he received
his dismissal in no very courtly phrase. The lady's tale
was more immoral than a story of Boccaccio, more
vulgar in style than a retired West-end butcher's
drawing-room furniture in his suburban mansion, or
the pretensions of our old friend Mrs. Grimshaw and
the Misses Grimshaw (two); whilst its best parts
were the spoilt spoil of a manuscript left by a needy
author with the newspaper proprietor to whom we
have alluded, which was returned after a twelve-month 
to its owner imperfect, and without thanks
or comment. But the book in question was spicy,
sensational, and slangy, and had accordingly made its
mark. How was Aubrey to know that the newspaper
proprietor had married the sister of the authoress?
Your true literary hack would have been better
posted, than thus to cut his own throat. So Aubrey
did not flourish.</p>

<p>One evening he met a musician, who had played at
his own house, and who recognised him, and with

<!-- vol 2 page 419 -->

infinite kindness and good taste concealed the fact,
and the pity which he felt. The pair fraternised,
and the fiddler procured the ci-devant dilettante some
permanent but humbly paid work. It was to copy
scores for the theatre where the former was engaged.
Here we shall leave him for awhile&mdash;a waif and stray
in the mighty City, whose great roaring tide deafened
his uncomplaining groans. One Saturday night,
when he prowled forth to buy sustenance, that he
might eat and not die&mdash;it was in Tottenham Court-road&mdash;he 
came upon one man whom he had known
well, and who recognised him with a heartiness which
approached the rude confines of glee. This was Mr.
Stingray of all men!</p>

<p>"What! Aubrey?" he cried. "Why, we all
thought you were dead. How very unkind of you
to cut all your old friends. Where are you living
now, eh? Sir Harry told me you were in America.
Heard of you last at the 'Blue Lion'. Literary, eh?
Been out marketing for the Muses?" (looking at
Aubrey's ill-concealed purchases). "Shall be delighted 
to tell all our circle I found you so well employed. 
I say, dear old boy, where do you buy your
bloaters? I never can get them good."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stingray," said Aubrey, "I don't know
what you mean by this; but I wrote to you a letter
asking for some literary employment on your magazine 
about eight months ago, and you never condescended 
to answer it, and now I believe that you are
merely prying into my misfortunes with excessively
bad taste."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" said Stingray, "friendship is

<!-- vol 2 page 420 -->

one thing, and the magazine which I have the honour
to edit, another. I didn't suppose that fashionable
insolvency&mdash;I mean, misfortune&mdash;is exactly the path
to literary remuneration and fame; and judging by
appearances, my opinion has been justified by the
British public at large. But, upon my soul, if you'll
accompany me to the nearest tavern, I'll stand the
price of an article with pleasure, if you'll only tell me
your history since I had the pleasure of meeting you
last, and where you get such herrings as these."</p>

<p>The answer was a gesture and look so fierce and
determined, that Mr. Stingray started back a couple
of paces at least.</p>

<p>"You infernal scoundrel!" said Aubrey, as soon
as he could speak. "Stand out of my way, or I'll
strike you in the mouth. How dare you insult me
thus?"</p>

<p>And he passed rapidly on.</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! we are proud," said Stingray.
"Here, policeman, look after that man. He is
either a dangerous lunatic or a thief. What fun this
will be for the club! Our exquisite friend down on
his luck to such a degree, and as proud as ever.
Confound his insolence! What a seedy brute he
looked, and yet I spotted him in a moment. And
think of the affectation of his dinners in Queen's-square. 
Pah! And the blind governess too, who
ought to have been buried in a cross-road, if they had
found her," added Mr. Stingray, reflectively. "How
that woman hated me, because I saw through their
upstart pretensions, and now the male beauty has
come to this&mdash;a hole in the elbow of his sleeve, and

<!-- vol 2 page 421 -->

a red herring for supper and dinner too, I shouldn't
wonder! Some day he will be buried&mdash;if he is buried
at all&mdash;at the parish expense. I should like to know
when he does go off the hooks, and then I'll work the
story up in a novel. I declare I never felt more disgusted 
in my life to think that I should actually have
been once on friendly terms with a disreputable
cadger in Tottenham Court-road. And the beggar
refused my bounty! I really would have stood a
sovereign to hear how he contrived to come down in
the world so rapidly. He'll never get such another
chance. If he had a wife or children to maintain, he
wouldn't be quite so impertinent, I fancy. That's
what fetches all the nonsense out of a scamp like that.
This precious fellow used, when he had the money, to
spoil cabmen by giving them more than their fares. He
was the organ-grinder's friend, and liked to encourage
street-begging. I should think he must have had a
prophetic eye to his own future. Only to think that
a year ago this beggar and his wife gave themselves
airs of exclusiveness. And now where are they?
Ha! ha! It's positively delicious. Whatever did
that rogue Cousens mean by saying that he had died
in a printing-house in New York? What a story
for the 'Kemble!' Ho! ho!"</p>

<p>Thus talking to himself, the "great, good, and
genial philanthropist," as he has been called, stalked
on chuckling over Aubrey's fall.</p>

<p>"<i>Facilissimus descensus</i>," he said, as he ran down
a small pleasure craft with his bulky hull.</p>

<p>"Mind where yer goin' to, you ugly old beast!"
was the fair one's angry remark.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 422 -->

<p>"I beg your pardon, my dear," said the philosopher, 
bowing with mock courtesy.</p>

<p>"Look how you've tore my dress. You must give
me and my friend a glass of wine."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the cynic.</p>

<p>"I say, Jem," said one of four gents, passing arm-in-arm, 
to one of his friends, "d'ye know who that
cove is? He's the President of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice. I say, guv'nor, mind what
you're after, you know."</p>

<p>A shower of jeers followed Mr. Stingray and his
convoy to the nearest public-house. This was a kind
of thing in which the cynic often indulged with impunity. 
He was only studying "life." Does any
one think it is cruelty, or bare curiosity, which leads
the great and gushing Mr. Granville Smith to an
execution? Certainly not. It is in order to describe
the horrors of the scene with due effect, and in a
chef d'&oelig;uvre of Dutch word-painting, culminating in
melodramatic maudlin, to recommend the abolition of
capital punishment, and put a premium upon murder.
By mixing freely with a certain class of society. Stingray 
had been enabled to pen his celebrated "Haymarket 
Gleanings," which led to the transference of
more arbitrary power to the coarse hands of a brutal
Police. Any low Irish ruffian in uniform was thereby
enabled to maul and despitefully abuse a shrinking
and delicate female, to bruise her body, tear her
clothes, dislocate her fingers, wrists, or arms, fracture 
her skull, lock her up, and even <i>kill</i> her with
impunity; for no offence whatever, save one of
which magistrates, legislators, ministers of state, and

<!-- vol 2 page 423 -->

even royal personages of the male sex are equally, if
not far more guilty, in the sight at least of Heaven.
If, occasionally, a respectable young woman falls
a victim to this brutality, constant remands and
hard swearing, a magisterial Lord Angelo and
forged evidence, at least assure the impunity of the
assailants.</p>

<p>Stingray had jested and drunk his champagne with
the incumbent of a saloon in the Haymarket&mdash;nay,
paid his full tribute of compliments and gallantries
over the bar-counter to the presiding dame, and the
next day written a sensational article in a daily
journal, branding the whole concern as a terrible
haunt of iniquity, to be put down with the strong
arm of the law. This was not the act even of a gentlemanly 
fiend! It was a sample of the satire, the
honour, the principle, the chivalry of the nineteenth
century, the age of false success, the reign of moral
and physical adulteration, when a myriad Mammon
rises everywhere and pushes Simplicity and Truth
from their stools, strips the fillet from the eyes of
Justice to discover the hideous squint behind, and
makes earth a rogue's paradise and gilded pleasure-garden, 
when villainy and vice hold a continual masked
carnival of unimpassioned ruffianism and commercial
crime!</p>

<p>Any petty Pontius Pilate of a police court will
call this senseless raving. So is every truth, according 
to the fiat of the day. The Cervantes to restore
chivalry has yet to appear. We do not now call
a windmill a giant; but we call a factory "progress," 
and a great slop-selling establishment "integrity." 

<!-- vol 2 page 424 -->

A successful swindle is "eminent respectability." 
A man of enormous wealth may ruin a
regiment of honest men's daughters, and yet, if he
will but lay the stone of a new church, Morality
grasps him by the hand and salutes him as a beneficent 
Genius of modern life. What were the delusions 
of him of "La Mancha" compared with the
sober enchantments and transformations of a utilitarian 
age? At least a nobler delusion, a wiser folly,
a braver stupidity, a grander mistake!</p>

<p>Aubrey was in the act of entering his miserable
abode, when a sickly, delicate creature accosted him
with a piteous tale. She had a child in her arms.
It looked well, and had a fresh colour, which contrasted 
with her deadly pallor. As it lay folded in
her shawl, it reminded one of a bud half shrouded by
a yellow leaf on the stem of a blighted flower.</p>

<p>"I have no money, or I would give it to you," he
said, hoarsely and almost angrily.</p>

<p>There is something irritating in the importunity
of a beggar, when you cannot relieve the distress
which rends a heart acquainted with penury and
want to its inmost core. The woman bowed her
head over her child, and moved away as if rebuked
by a sterner grief. Aubrey turned. He had been
accustomed all his life to give, and the mute action
of the woman touched him deeply. He beckoned
her back.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "take this; I can do without it."
And he gave her all the little marketings he had
bought for that night and the Sunday as well.
"Stop!" he said, and went up-stairs.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 425 -->

<p>In a few moments he returned. He gave her a
few pence; they comprised every coin he had in the
world, and shut the door to avoid her thanks.</p>

<p>Let us look at him in his little attic. The moon
shone brightly into the room. It was cold; but he
did not attempt to light a fire. There was a pallet-bed, 
on which a rug and some clothes were spread
to eke out the scanty allowance of a single blanket
and counterpane. There was a deal table and a very
humble tea-service for one. There were two chairs,
a washhand-stand, a box and portmanteau, a print or
two on the walls, and a few books and papers scattered 
about. He sat down on the bed, with his face
hidden in his hands. Then he arose and opened a
cupboard in the wall, and took out a fragment of
bread and ate, and poured out a glass of water from
a jug and drank.</p>

<p>"I shall have nothing," he thought, "to-morrow,
nothing. Well, it is not much to suffer." The idea
seemed to amuse him, for he laughed a short bitter
laugh. "The scoundrel; the wicked old heartless 
reprobate to stab me thus with his gibes! To
think of my being caught by him like a clown at a
pantomime who has just plundered a fish-stall! What
does it matter? He can but say that I am destitute.
At any rate, I ask for assistance from none. Now,
then, to work. I must finish that score by Monday."
Accordingly, he sat down and worked until his candle
got low, when he extinguished it, and looked out upon
the innumerable leads, and tiles, and chimney-pots
which stretched far away beyond, "It is something
like a cemetery," he mused, "only that the living

<!-- vol 2 page 426 -->

and not the dead sleep beneath." Then he lit his
pipe, and smoked it sadly and thoughtfully, if we
can apply such expressions to such an act. What
bitter remembrances passed in review! "Is it possible," 
he groaned, "that I was that man, that idiot,
that thrice-sodden fool? I began as others would
end, with all that human wishes could desire, and I
have lost all. But for the daily struggle, which does
not give me time to think, I should end this coil.
Had I not met that man, I should hardly have paused
to think to-night. I should have been busy with
small, mean cares, like a civilised Robinson Crusoe in
a crowd. To-morrow, I have but two hours' work. I
shall lie in bed: it stops hunger. I remember an
Italian exile, a man with a big voice and a figure like
Lablache, one whom Nature never meant to grow
thin. His remittances failed, or he said so. They
always do. I suppose they are intercepted by foreign
lawyers or unjust relations. I think he said it was a
sister in his case, who had married a Neapolitan count.
Nothing could be more natural, than that an exile
should cease to receive money. So he ceased to
dine. He had run up a score at Cesarini's, and even
the maccaroni due to him from Nature became an
impossibility at last. He used to make wonderful
cuttings in black paper, and to teach Italian where
he could. But somehow all failed together, remittances, 
sale of cuttings, and lessons. A lady sent
me in search of him. I found him in bed in a lodging
close to this very place&mdash;Frith-street, I think it was&mdash;hollow-eyed, 
and crying like a huge baby, with
a bass voice that shook the room. I asked him what

<!-- vol 2 page 427 -->

was the matter. He said he had fever. As I spoke
to him he flung aside the coverlet, and displayed his
huge torso. He had a wide, red leather belt tightly
buckled round his waist.</p>

<p>" 'Look here, caro signor,' he said, as he drew it
in, 'how I am rovinato!'</p>

<p>"I saw it all at a glance.</p>

<p>" 'I want you,' I said, 'to take me to one of your
Italian restaurants. I have a fancy for maccaroni &agrave;
l'Italienne.'</p>

<p>"Before I could prevent it, my huge acquaintance
seized my hand and pressed it to his bearded lips,
which annoyed me dreadfully at the time.</p>

<p>" 'I have understood,' he said. 'You have a good
heart, signor. My countryman is not rich; he can
give me no more credit. The day before yesterday
he said, "Here is your note;" and yesterday I could
not return. You are an Englishman! you do not
like our maccaroni, I know it, but you are an angel
for me. Wait!'</p>

<p>"And he put on his capacious garments, and still
looked immense, like a mountain with hollow sides,
or an elephant in grief. It ended in my sitting down
with a strange lot. There was a silent bearded man,
since famous for an act of assassination, a third-rate
singer at the Opera, a courier, a violoncello player, a
family of acrobats, husband, two brothers, wife, and
children, a group of photographic artists, a mysterious 
elderly foreigner whom I had known for ten
years as a frequenter of Regent-street, and had
christened 'the marquis,' and three vociferous French
exiles of the barricades. My poor Signor Ravenna

<!-- vol 2 page 428 -->

outdid a juggler in eating his maccaroni, and I
watched for him to loosen his broad red belt. There
was a dandelion salad, I remember, which amused
me much; and the dessert placed before each guest
reminded me of the sort of mock banquet which
children like to make. When Signor Ravenna had
got his cup of coffee, and rolled a pinch of tobacco
in a small strip of prepared paper out of a little book,
between his huge finger and thumb, with a dexterity
and fineness of touch that were part and parcel of his
vast idiosyncrasy, he was as happy as any foreign
gentleman could be in this climate of fog.</p>

<p>" 'You are my protector, my saviour,' he said.
'When I get my album returned, which is now with
your milord Poggins in the City, a youth most
genteel, say I, then I will pray you to accept one, my
most beautiful design, the "Judgment of Brutus," a
copy of that which I have presented to the Empress
of the French.'</p>

<p>"I remember that a fierce gesture and a muttered
remark from the other side of the table interrupted
us; and shortly after I paid Signor Ravenna's two
months' dinner score with the bill. It was not much;
and he insisted in a few days on presenting me with
some really beautiful things, which must have cost
him no end of time and trouble. I wonder what has
become of him. I shouldn't mind reversing the
order of things, and being his guest now."</p>

<p>It was a humiliating and melancholy fact; but
Aubrey by no means for the first time felt the pangs
of absolute hunger. It seemed impossible for a man
who had so lately entertained persons of fortune

<!-- vol 2 page 429 -->

and title at his own sumptuous table to be reduced to
such straits. He might actually at that moment have
walked into his West-end club and ordered a luxurious
supper. He was still on the books. There were
many persons who would have lent or given him a
five-pound note, if it were only to purchase future
avoidance. But there was a moral barrier which he
never attempted to break, even before his clothes grew
shabby, and he became a scarecrow in his own thought.
The fact, we say, may appear startling and astonishing; 
but it is no less true. Had he been a fraudulent
bankrupt on a large or small scale, it would not have
happened. There are contractors whose bills have
remained dishonoured, and who have scattered ruin
around, who still give their musical parties, and shine
magnates of the debatable land between vulgarity
and fashion. But then they have settled thousands a
year on their wives. There are tradesmen who are
ruined periodically, and rise again tricked with new
bankruptcy, and flourish in the advertisements of the
"Morning Day." There is the insolvent nobleman
in Parliament, whose bills are still blown about, and
are occasionally discounted after a fashion, in which
principal seems to have changed place with interest;
and whose small cheques are now and then cashed by
some new victim or unwitting admirer of a lord.
There are men overwhelmed with debt, and with no
ostensible means, who still manage somehow to live
on the fat of the land, and to dress with the best, by
the aid of fresh relays of long-suffering West-end
tailors and bootmakers. How do they manage it?
We know not. It would have puzzled Solomon; it

<!-- vol 2 page 430 -->

may be clear enough to Phinny Moses, the bill discounter 
of Bond-street. But Arthur Aubrey was
none of these. He was unconditionally ruined. He
had near relations enormously rich; but they were
very far off from him. These gilded his decline about
as usefully and ornamentally, as the rays of Sirius
might the shell of a pauper in its rapid progress to
the grave.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, had Aubrey applied to any
relative, or friend? If he had not, he could hardly
complain; since it is easy in this world to slip out of
sight and remembrance, and besides how could they
know his situation and need? On one occasion,
after writing sixteen hours a-day, i.e., out of the
twenty-four, for upwards of a week; after thirty calls
at a theatre about a play, which he never had returned 
to him, and which was subsequently pirated
by one of the "dramatic" gang; after incredible
exertions to get rid of a literary nugget which no Jew,
or Gentile worse than Jew, would purchase; after
heart-breaking experiences and disappointments;
after seeking in vain any employment, however
humble, almost menial, as clerk, secretary, amanuensis, 
anything by which he might live, he did write
three letters to two kinsmen and a ci-devant friend.
One of the two former never answered him, and the
other, whose income was fifty thousand a-year, declined 
on the plea of the numerous calls upon his
purse. The "friend," who, when a minor, Aubrey
had assisted with a loan of a thousand pounds, subsequently 
repaid, three years after, without interest,
enclosed him a Post-office order for five pounds,

<!-- vol 2 page 431 -->

and said that he would assist him with a small addition 
to his income, when he, the "friend," could
hear that he was in any small permanent employment, 
and seeking to aid himself in a reputable
and solid way. As if he had not sought, poor fellow!
The friend in question was a generous man; but he
consulted one or two of Aubrey's relatives, and took
what he thought was a kind and common-sense view
of the matter. He was at first inclined to write a
very kindly letter, and to offer to allow him sixty
pounds a-year. But the relatives said:</p>

<P>"Depend upon it, so long as he gets any one to
assist him, he will do nothing for himself. He will
never work, so long as he can manage without it.
Let him get an appointment&mdash;let us see him doing
anything in a regular way, and we will join in aiding
him ourselves. You could not do that man a greater
unkindness than in sending him money. He always
spent and anticipated all he got."</p>

<p>In England people never think of setting a fallen
man on his legs. They always wait, for his sake,
until he is past the necessity of help or need. They
will bestow money on his remains when dead, which
they would not give him on principle while living.
"Learn to swim!" they say to the drowning wretch.
"A plank would be thrown away upon you. It would
only encourage you to fall overboard again. When
you can swim, we will subscibe for a full-rigged boat."
They never think of the petty miseries which occupy
the time and thoughts of the man in difficulties, of
his shabby attire which prevents him from getting
if not seeking the employment which they so kindly

<!-- vol 2 page 432 -->

and thoughtfully recommend. They never think of
giving him a chance in life. This is sometimes the
excuse of meanness, sometimes the blindness of well-meaning 
stupidity:</p>

<p class="small">But evil is wrought by want of thought,<br/>

As well as want of heart!</p>

<p>Arthur Aubrey sat gazing out of his attic window,
until the chimney-pots seemed to dance a gavotte
or fandango, to which a little demon fiddler in his
brain played the tune. Then he pressed his forehead
against a cold pane of glass, and rose to undress
himself before seeking the oblivion of sleep. As
he did so, he cried out aloud&mdash;"Blanche! Blanche!
thou art avenged!"</p>

<p class="small">"Don't tell me," ses I, "as if I wer' a ignoramus and knowed
nothink. It's prallysis as you're a-drivin' at. Appleplexy, indeed! and
the party still alive and kickin'! Appleplexy is a single-knock customer,

Wherever there's appleplexy tellegrafed on the line, you should keep a

prallysis, it sometimes only trifles with its wictim, as poor Stevy Greening 
observed, when his wife's steel busk was melted with lightnin',
leavin' her unhurt, and he hadn't to wear no mournin' after all. Prallysis
takes a man by the arm, or the leg, or it'll seize a whole side of him,

killing the rest of the hanimal. It'll make a clean sweep of memory,
or leave any one deaf or speechless, which might be a reckymendation
to some married folks as I've met with. It'll double up the strongest

hangin' by a clean swep' grate. It'll pull down one side of your

bought 'em, you're sold; for they've no whistle in 'em at all, and them
as sells 'em ought to be took up by the perlice. I tell yer, it'll leave
your face like a battered old street cab with one spring broken in the

can't open 'em to holler out&mdash;that's what it'll do," ses I, "as sure as
this glass of ale is a-goin' down my throat. As for appleplexy, it's a
fool to prallysis. It's no more nor simple hangin' computed with the
torters of the Spanish Inkisition."&mdash;<i>Leaves from a Bar Parlour</i>, No. IV.</p>

<p>WE left Aubrey in bed hungry and forlorn, about
the small hours of a cold and dreary Sabbath morning, 

<!-- vol 2 page 434 -->

wondering what the morrow would bring forth,
and whether he should receive a small trifle which he
expected, or be obliged to pawn some necessary trifle,
in order to obtain a meal. He lay there, occasionally
dozing, and sometimes painfully awake to his situation, 
and to the cravings of hunger, until about the
fashionable hour of dinner that Sunday evening,
when he rose languidly and lighted a fire and made a
weak cup of tea without milk, and steeped in it a
mouldy crust which he fortunately managed to find,
such as any servant would have thrown away, and
the proffer of which would not have extracted a wag
of the tail from a well-fed hound. About that time
a very different scene was being acted at the Bedford
Hotel, Brighton, where the great Mr. Grimshaw had
taken up his abode for the nonce, or where, to speak
more strictly, his abode had been taken for him. In
the midst of his greatest success&mdash;whilst his colossal
fortune was almost doubling itself without assistance
in the course of that single year&mdash;the great projector
and calculator, the man of steel head and iron frame
and feet of coal, like the mighty golden idol with
clay extremities which Nebuchadnezzar the king set
up, over-calculated himself after a plethoric dinner,
and was touched on the shoulder by Paralysis, one of
the greffiers of the Almighty Creditor, to Whom
everything is owed which is lent them to set up in
business on the slippery leasehold or tenancy at will
of life. Paralysis might have whispered in his ear,
had he had the time accorded him to listen,</p>

<p>"I arrest you at the suit of your dead partner whom
you robbed, of the poor you have neglected, and the

<!-- vol 2 page 435 -->

victims you have swindled. Quick! Come with me
to the sponging-house of sickness, where you will
remain, until your final imprisonment in the tomb,
on which a flattering inscription will record your
profession of a Christian faith." But Paralysis was
silent on the occasion, and so was Grimshaw ever
more. His lips seemed constantly to calculate; and
doubtless they did, after a fashion, in polite deference 
to the habit of his life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grimshaw had settled her last housekeeper's
account, and run up her last milliner's bill for tawdry
finery, about a year before. She died of acute fussiness, 
terminating in carbuncle, on the occasion of
the coming of age of the youngest Grimshaw son.
The Grimshaws had endeavoured to set up as a
county family by virtue of the most overpowering
festivities on such occasions, whereat and whereupon
the haughty rebuffs which they received from their
prouder neighbours only seemed to dispose them to
incur fresh insults, in spite of the pain and rage
which each successive refusal imposed upon their
parvenu pride. Still they had made great progress. 
Grimshaw could always latterly bring down
a lord from town, and he had got into his clutches a
county baronet of Norman descent; to whom he had
lent money, with the double view of securing such
an aristocratic visitor, and getting hold of a valuable
royalty on starvation terms. At the marriage of the
eldest and plainest Miss Grimshaw to a healthy
but needy squire, whose courage at least merited a
pleasanter fate, the services of an honourable and
reverend clergyman of most disreputable character

<!-- vol 2 page 436 -->

were engaged. What mattered his character? He
was honourable and reverend in the newspapers and
"Court Guide." During his fortnight's stay at the
Hall, there was no little scandal incurred&mdash;almost
too strong for the parvenu family to sustain. A very
young visitor at the Hall, son of one of Grimshaw's
numerous partners, was pursuing his tender studies
under the auspices of a governess. On one occasion
the following copy in excellent round-text was found
in the child's writing-book, and no one could tell how
it came there:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Steam communication corrupts good manners, 1, 2, 3.</p>

</div>

<p>We suspect that the honourable and reverend, who
was a bit of a wag in his way, could have laid the
odds that he would name the writer of the above
sentence, which is not altogether unintelligible and
devoid of truth, much more easily than he could predict 
the winner of the ensuing Derby.</p>

<p>As we said, Mrs. Grimshaw died, and was buried
with more pomp and ceremony, than had accompanied
the death of her mother, or any of her family within
the power of tradition to record, if we except her
great grandfather, who was said to have been hanged
for stealing a donkey. Hence, it was whispered that
the Heralds' College had supplied a device for her
arms, which were quartered with those of her husband, 
not without some appropriate facetiousness of
design. The crest of Mrs. Grimshaw was a wild ass
escaping from a lasso, with the motto "Libertas et
Justitia," which meant, as some said, that her grandsire 
was executed, whilst the ass escaped. It must be

<!-- vol 2 page 437 -->

owned that the crest looked something like a pictorial
rebus in a penny print. We know one man who
explained his own crest, which consisted of an arm
and hand holding a torch, by saying that he supposed
that one of his ancestors had once fired a hayrick, as
the crowning achievement of his life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grimshaw being thus laid in the "fammerly"
vault, as she called it, a maiden sister of Mr. Grimshaw 
presided at his table and over the deportment
of his unmarried daughters, with a severe precision, to
which a species of palsy, which caused her continually
to nod her head, contributed in a manner "awfully
funny," as we once heard a youngster call it, after
his first interview with that spinster. And well might
he have said so. Mrs. Grimshaw's own hair was
red; but red hair continued an abhorred thing long
after she was forty. She had at that age, therefore,
adopted a wig, the precise fashion of which she had
never since seen fit to alter. The style of chevelure
being at that period remarkably ugly, it followed that
she was unfortunate in the pattern she had chosen.
It was a wonderful combination of roll upon roll
of large stiff brown curls, which presented the same
appearance, as a male "fine 'ead of 'air," as the
hairdressers call it, which has just undergone the
embellishing infliction of the irons, before it is combed
out. Upon this was placed a wonderful superstructure 
in the shape of a cap, which was graced
with such an abundance of bows of ribbons, quillings
of blonde and flowers, that it was constantly fluttered
with the shaking of the old lady's head. When she
wore, on grand occasions, a bird of paradise nestled

<!-- vol 2 page 438 -->

on the loftiest summit of her charms, you might
have fancied that the bird had lighted on the topmost 
branches of some lightning-blasted tropical tree&mdash;a 
sort of Eastern elder-berry, if there be such an
arboreal eccentricity of vegetation. Imagine all this
placed upon a long and scraggy neck, which reminded
the beholder of the dirty-white grandmother of all
the flamingo tribe, and you have some idea of the
appearance to which our schoolboy friend applied the
epithet of "awfully funny," in the modern slang of
the period.</p>

<p>This ancient Juno, or rather Diana, we ask pardon
of her single state, loved her brother, so far as she
could love, and revered him as so great and wealthy
an individual merited. When he first succumbed to
the stroke, her nods became so rapid and violent, that
they seemed to threaten the dislocation of the vertebrae
of that elongated neck. When, however, her brother,
the head of the family, as she called him with truth,
developed the sad symptoms of hopeless imbecility,
all the better part of the woman came out, and she
nursed and watched over him with untiring tenderness 
and devotion, not destitute of a certain pathetic
dignity in its way. She was altogether the best of the
Grimshaw lot; and the only lady-like female, with
the exception of the youngest niece, little Violet, that
the whole of the two generations could boast. She
had carried her brother to Brighton, in the vain hope
of benefit accruing to him from the sea air. He slept
well, and his appetite was good, and the pair drove
out together in a splendid equipage. The vulgar
millionaire looked much better, after his calamity

<!-- vol 2 page 439 -->

with his placid countenance and white hair, the latter
an immediate consequence of the stroke, than ever he
had done before.</p>

<p>"What an interesting-looking old gentleman!"
the passers-by would say.</p>

<p>The pair are seated opposite to each other at
dinner, at the Bedford Hotel. The elder daughters
were on a visit, and poor little Violet at school. The
table was magnificently furnished, and a butler (no
less a personage than the great Binsby himself) and
a tall footman stood on either side of his chair on
guard, while the hotel servants waited generally at
table with noiseless ease. The dull moaning of the
sea sounded outside the lofty crimsoned-curtained windows, 
like the far-off thunder of an approaching host.
But a more prosaic and altogether different sort of
host presently enters the spacious apartment, in the
person of the landlord of the hotel. He bows to the
lady, who endeavours to make a distinctive nod, very
difficult for her to accomplish, as, with bland and
urbane accents, he hopes that everything is served to
his distinguished guests' satisfaction, and expresses
his anxiety lest their drive on the west cliff should
have proved too cold for the invalid. He leaves with
a deep reverence, as he entered, and the service of
the dinner begins. The lady nods like a mandarin.
"Thank you, no soup, I'm obleeged." The invalid
moves his lips as if in continual calculation of fresh
gain, or is it in expectation of his dinner? for, to tell
the truth, he was both hungry and cold. Mr. Binsby
solemnly arranges a napkin for him under his chin,
as a nurse would place a bib round a baby's neck&mdash;a

<!-- vol 2 page 440 -->

process by no means unneeded&mdash;for Paralysis had
left a familiar behind him as custodian of the plutocrat
in the person of premature Old Age, and to speak
the truth, he drivelled, and his eyes wept involuntarily
tears. Then the tall footman lifts the cover off the
steaming silver tureen, and stands at attention, and
Binsby ladles out a plateful of delicious golden-coloured 
soup. The invalid sits awhile, moving his
lips with a little increased motion, and the old lady
nods opposite, attentively regarding every motion of
his feeble frame.</p>

<p>"It is too hot, I fear," she says, in her usual subdued 
and slightly husky accents.</p>

<p>"It is reyther hot, ma'am," replies proximious
flunkydom in a tone of gentle alarm.</p>

<p>Her brother steals an artful and parrot-like look
around. It would be superlatively droll, were it not
supremely melancholy to behold. Then he manages
to unbutton a pocket of his left trouser, and holds it
open with one hand, whilst he takes a spoonful of the
hot soup with the other, and endeavours to pour it
into the receptacle, which it had been the unceasing
toil and object of his life to fill, at least figuratively,
with gold. The tall footman turns round, and nearly
chokes himself with a napkin. You might have
imagined that the hot soup had been, by some mysterious 
process of magic, conveyed presto into his
throat.</p>

<p>The hotel servants turn to the sideboard, and are
suddenly very busy with the glasses and spoons. The
head-dress of poor Miss Grimshaw is agitated, as if
genteel Palsy had suddenly become a ruffian of tremendous 

<!-- vol 2 page 441 -->

violence, and was seeking to twist her
neck off, without further extension of leave. Then
she half rises from her seat, and two great drops,
which might have been tears, roll heavily down her
parchment face, as if to water her arid neck. Mr.
Binsby alone is equal to the occasion. His face expresses 
a dignified condolence, which would have become 
an ancient lord mayor on the announcement of
the death of his favourite fool. He gently guides
his master's hands one by one to their proper position,
and then holds a fresh spoonful of soup to its proper
receptacle, where it is duly received. Ancient torture
is said to have poured molten gold down the throats
of great criminals who had sinned through avaricious
greed. The punishment which Grimshaw inflicted
on himself was a parody on that practice, as unconscious 
as it was suggestive. On that day, he
had relations actually wanting bread. At that very
hour, there was a human being dying just a hundred 
and fifty yards and ten inches distant, measured 
by a tape, had it been drawn from the button
of his left trouser-pocket to the fluttering heart of the
expiring wretch on a heap of straw in the back yard
of a neighbouring narrow street. This creature, a
woman, had walked from London during the three
days previous in search of a person named Smith, at
Brighton, whom she could not find. Three days
after, a coroner's inquest was held over what had
seemed a heap of rags and grey hair to a man who
kept a fish-barrow in that yard; and on his entrance
to fetch it out, the "body," which had been that of a
once stout woman, weighed less than fifty pounds.

<!-- vol 2 page 442 -->

This woman, who died on her sixty-ninth birthday,
had been a crony of Grimshaw's mother, who married
very young, as pit people do, and had nursed him
through a dangerous fever when he was six years of
age. She had sung the "Pitman's Courtship" over
his cradle in his early days.</p>

<p>And now the rough and wintry sea-wind rattled
the roof of a pig-sty over her bones. She had more
than once appealed to the millionaire for aid, in the
earlier days of his prosperity. It is charitable towards 
that carefully tended victim of paralysis to
believe that somehow he had failed to recognise the
identity of the applicant.</p>

<p>That day&mdash;it was Sunday, O ye anti-recreationists
of the poor, who fare sumptuously in purple and fine
linen, and sing sacred (?) songs to your grand pianos
at home!&mdash;the first dawn of success lit up the expressive 
countenance of Blanche with a smile of
enchanting grace. Her ma&euml;stro had invited a few
connoisseurs to his villa in the outskirts of Rome.
The modulation and power of her rich contralto
astonished them all. Fat fubsy baritones kissed the
tips of their fingers, and threw them open in undisguised 
admiration, with a gesture such as an Italian
can alone master. An old bass singer, with a wonderful 
shirt-frill, not of the whitest it must be confessed, 
but that might be owing to the contrast with
his hair, kissed her gracefully on both cheeks, and
called her his child, and "la perla d'Inghilterra,"
and other pretty names. A youthful tenore woke
up the lightly sleeping echoes of the streets with the
air of the one English ballad which she sang, and

<!-- vol 2 page 443 -->

the raptures of that individual in picturing her to his
friends can better be imagined than described. An
eccentric English milord, who was one of the favoured
few invited, said nothing; but the next day called
on the ma&euml;stro; and having as delicately as possible
inquired into the circumstances of this English
<i>maraviglia</i>, placed a thousand pounds at the disposal
of the bearded instructor, who lived on something
less than a hundred pounds a-year; and to his honour
be it said, the gift was as sacredly applied, when his
pupil left him, as if it had been intrusted to Aristides 
or Garibaldi himself. Not a scudo more remuneration, 
on her leaving him, would that foreign
singing-master take on account of this influx of wealth.
Yet the only condition of the trust was that she should
not know it, until she had finished her course with
the professor, and that then she should not be informed 
whence the donation came.</p>

<p>Verily there is some grand old honesty left in the
world, though it is seldom found where it is expected,
or furnished to anticipation and belief.</p>

<p>A lady in deep mourning and seclusion has just
taken a pretty villa at Bournemouth. Even there
she is known for charity and good deeds. When a
boat was upset, and three poor fellows drowned, she
was the angel of grace in three cottages, and prayed
and knelt by the bedside of the dying mother of one,
and the sick wife of another, while providing for the
five children whom the third left destitute. Who can
she be?</p>

<p>The Duke of Chalkstoneville died suddenly. It
was said that he had married Miss Dareall: but we

<!-- vol 2 page 444 -->

knew that could not be the case. But he left fifty
thousand pounds in his will, free of legacy duty, to a
young person utterly unknown, save to his confidential
legal advisers, and who was named by the euphonious
appellation of Martha Grubb.</p>

<p>A coffee-shop was opened in the Whitechapel-road 
on Christmas Eve, 185&mdash;, with the most discordant 
performance of a brass and string band
perhaps ever known even in that locality. It reminded 
one of the joint performances of several rival
orchestras during Greenwich Fair, now happily
obsolete, though we cannot see that morals and
manners are thereby on the whole much improved.
In the pauses of the discord, a singular individual
delivered a succession of the most humorous harangues 
from a window of a first floor, whence the
frame had been removed. We will not attempt to do
justice to his admired cockneyisms by our spelling,
as we are convinced that the effort would be a
failure. He announced himself as the benefactor
of his species. He was about to bestow on them, at
prices ludicrously small, the result of unbounded
capital and philanthropical experience. His sherbet
would cool the coppers of a salamander; his coffee
came direct to him from 'Mesopotammy' from a sheik
of the desert, who was his bosom friend. An express
train brought him eggs from Dorking, and the fact
had created quite a competition among laying hens.
He had obtained a private concession from the milky-way; 
indeed, his milk was all cream, and as for his
cream, the only thing he feared was lest the rattling
of the omnibuses should turn it into butter, contrary

<!-- vol 2 page 445 -->

to the desire of the establishment. Sixteen amateur
duchesses made his butter in their country mansions;
and the superintendence of baking his fancy rolls
employed the leisure hours of an eccentric German
prince. Then, like the unveiling of a work of art, a
green baize cover was ever and anon drawn aside,
and displayed in golden letters such as had never
before been surpassed for brilliancy in Whitechapel,
the magic letters, "H. Downy, Coffee and Eating-House," 
and in smaller letters, with flourishes,
"Chops and Steaks, Ginger-beer and Soda-water.
Sherbet. Beds." The facetious young proprietor&mdash;for 
such he appeared&mdash;was attired in a dust-coloured
suit of the latest Whitechapel elegance, with a
wide-awake of the same colour, ornamented by a
wide ribbon of the most gaudy hues, in which
half a dozen pheasant's feathers were jauntily stuck,
probably to show his connexion with sporting and
agricultural life. Whenever a policeman appeared in
sight, he became unusually vociferous and cheerful
in his remarks. "Walk in, peeler!" he would cry.
"This hunique hestablishment closes at eleven, and
is licensed by special Hact of Parlyment. Now then,
Bobby! vy yer ain't comin' no quicker than if yer vos
a lieyer goin' to 'eaven by heasy stages, 'arf a hinch

dooty. Sir Richard Mayne and the Lord Mayor

<!-- vol 2 page 446 -->

has sent their complimints, and vill dine 'ere on
Christmas Day to meet the Prince of Tick. Now,
then, mu-sick!"</p>

<p>And then the band would strike up its horrid discord
again; and the facetious proprietor would retire and
reappear, glass in hand, to drink the health of a
passing omnibus driver, with a perfectly ecstatic series
of winks and gestures, amid the cheers of the surrounding 
mob. Who can this irrepressible and enterprising 
individual be? It was at least to be hoped
that he would meet with the patronage which he
deserves.</p>

<p>And now, once more, let us collect our scattered
puppets, and shut them up for another period of four
years. Or rather let us leave them at liberty to
work out their own destiny in silence, and raise the
curtain in due time to display the next tableau of
their fate.</p>

<p class="small">When the faithful mistress comes in contact with the profligate wife,
the former can afford to lavish on the latter a splendid contempt.&mdash;<i>Aphorisms 
of Ivan Danovskoi, formerly Imperial Historiographer to
the Czar</i>.</p>

<p>FOUR eventful years have passed since the circumstances 
narrated in our last volume, particularly eventful 
to the personages in whom we trust that we have
interested our readers, and doubtless somewhat eventful 
to the rest of the world. Some had been born into
this life without their being consulted on the subject,
and others had taken their departure more or less unwillingly 
from it. Alas! to how few could the Almighty 
Ruler of the Universe give the flattering dismissal 
of "<i>bene decessit!</i>" How many trembled on
the tremendous verge of nothingness with abject fear,
and wished they might play their brief part over

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

again, and, oh! how differently! Among the departures 
was the no longer wealthy Grimshaw; for
he was ruined on an immense scale of deficit. True,
the poor pitman&mdash;for what else was he then?&mdash;knew
nothing whatever about it. Ever since he was
stricken, it had been his particular delusion to fancy
he was insolvent, and luxury could not have persuaded
him to the contrary, had he continued to enjoy it.
True, Miss Grimshaw had set aside sufficient to keep
him in comfort for his few remaining days. In one
sense, his imbecility was most fortunate; for the indignant 
howl raised against him by the multitude,
whom he had led into the slough of impecuniosity,
was terrific, and would have been enough to have
driven any, save a rich man, say, a Member of Parliament 
with a Brobdingnagian nest-egg of gold which
nothing could wrest from him, into a state of remorseful 
lunacy, if it did not frighten him out of
existence altogether. Miss Grimshaw did not long
survive her brother. Her curls remained brown to
the end, because no wig was ever sufficiently realistic
to turn white at any degree of sorrow which the
wearer might suffer. But if her former head-dress
was something awful to behold, what was it now?
Poor thing! she looked like a mummy with hearse-plumes. 
All this did not deter her youngest niece,
Violet, from smoothing the latter end of her declining
days. Unfortunately the old lady had invested the
few thousand pounds belonging to her in an annuity,
in order that her brother might not perceive the great
and terrible change in his financial position. So
when she died, there was but little left. Antique

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

caps, even when trimmed with real lace, are not
exactly an investment in consols, nor were the aged
lady's old dresses an ample fortune for a girl brought
up in luxury. Poor Violet had nowhere to go to, so
she advertised in the papers, and obtained the situation 
of a governess, just as Blanche Aubrey had done
some years previously. In that promising and agreeable 
occupation we will for the present leave her.
The eldest daughter was, as we know, married and provided 
for, and she allowed her other sisters the barest
annuity upon which they could drag out their rapidly
corroding and miserable existence. As for the sons&mdash;one 
became racing "tout" and billiard-marker; all
knew degradation and misery. What can be imagined
more miserable than the hybrid and half-educated
young heirs to a parvenu's fortune, when the fortune
proves a myth, and everything that can make life
tolerable to them, or them tolerable to life, has
vanished? Messrs. Grinderby and Cousens had dissolved 
partnership. The latter had retired to the
provinces, that is, not exactly to his own province,
which would have been a mean one, but to Norwich,
the town which gave him birth. He had married
the no longer very young lady, of whom we have
narrated certain facts in this history&mdash;the one whom
he was so anxious for a friend and client to endow
with certain worldly wealth in the shape of a deed
of gift, which proposal missed fire, in the manner
we have already described. Why did he do this?
We answer why are scoundrels weak? Why do they
do anything which they do do?&mdash;an alliteration which
we hope our readers will pardon. But the lady had

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

still another "beau" to her string, in the person of a
money-lender in New Burlington-street, and after she
became Mrs. Cousens, her conduct was so unguarded
or so reckless, that even Cousens took exceptions
to her rule of three. His parents intervened, and he
proceeded for a divorce under the new Act. Unfortunately 
for him, another party also intervened in
the shape of the Queen's Proctor, and Phil had a
desperate fight for liberty, which he eventually obtained 
as follows. Sir Crossbill Crossbill, a judge of
great and peculiar experience in such matters, at first
showed great hostility to our smart young lawyer,
who he seemed to consider did not come into Court
with clean hands, and concerning whom he indulged
in some very severe remarks. The fact is, that Phil's
conduct was so remarkably easy and unsuspicious
for a man of the world, that it looked as if he had
been actually guilty of condonement of his wife's
profligate conduct. As the case went on, the astute
Phil displayed himself in so unfavourable a point of
view, as to puzzle the worthy judge, who surveyed
him every now and then with a sort of curiosity,
just as a collector of creeping things would examine
a strange reptile, which he was about to bottle for his
museum. At length experience and legal acumen
were fairly puzzled, if not deceived.</p>

<p>"I thought," said Sir Crossbill, in dissolving the
legal bonds which bound Phil Cousens, gentleman,
attorney-at-law, to Emma his wife&mdash;"I thought, in
the commencement of this suit, that the petitioner
was both knave and fool; the former, probably, considering 
his opportunities of worldly experience, and

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

the knowledge he might be supposed to have acquired
in his profession, preponderating over the latter;
that is, I thought him, if anything, more knave than
fool. I have seen reason, as the case proceeded, to
modify my opinion. I now consider him a greater
fool than knave."</p>

<p>Our readers will judge for themselves whether Sir
Crossbill was right in attributing less knavery than
folly to Mr. Cousens. But to think that "sly Phil,"
"artful Phil," "Phil's alive Phil," the clever, smart
London attorney, who prided himself upon his worldly
astuteness, should be thus publicly characterised&mdash;it
was too much!</p>

<p>Mr. Cousens retired to the country, and has only
appeared once in London since, when he visited the
Cattle Show, and hung his head when he met any one
whom he recognised. He kept his father's books,
and became slovenly in his apparel, in proportion to
the improvement in the neatness of his handwriting.
When we say that he left off wearing patent-leather
boots in the morning, we feel that we have said a
great deal. The only thing that we have heard of
him was, that he made an offer of marriage to Miss
Lambe, a well-to-do butcher's daughter of his mother's 
dissenting tenets, and was indignantly refused
by that spirited young lady. In vain did Phil assure
her that his happiness was at stake; the young lady
refused her fair, but somewhat chapped hand, to the
discomfited Mr. Cousens. It was evident she did not
think her weal would be assured by such a bargain.
"No!" she said, to a young and confidential friend
and schoolmate, "my 'art must turn the scales when

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

I marry, and I never could become the bride of a
man who, my pa says, has been so fast a liver, besides
being divorced from his lawful partner. Only think
of your husband's former wife being alive! I'd
sooner marry a widower with ever so many children.
No jointure would tempt me to such a second-hand
turn-out." So Phil soon found that his attentions in
the quarter of Lambe were vain. To do the young
lady justice, she did not long keep him upon the
hooks. "If your affections were buried in the grave,
I could not give you any encouragement," she said,
"to sue; it is utterly useless as it is." Phil looked
sheepish enough at this; and went home feeling, as he
declared afterwards, as if a knife were in him.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Since the rogue builds up a fortune for the fool to waste away;<br/>

And by the son things are not done, though business still may
thrive,<br/>

In the fine old evil way, as when the old "gent" was alive.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Anon</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. GRINDERBY still pursued his nefarious calling,
the only change being that he had discharged a clerk
or two, not including the illustrious Snap, who had
married on a slight increase of salary, and got a
family. (Solicitors' clerks do increase the population,
or how could so many music-halls fill, and so many
small tobacconists exist by the sale of brier-wood
pipes and cabbage-leaf regalias and Pickwicks?)
And this brings us, in the consideration of the eternal
fitness of things, to the question of whether the
British cigar was first manufactured for the consumption 
of the gent, or the gent for the consumption 
of the British cigar? This is an illiberal
remark, and we apologise for our bad taste in appearing
to contemn the tastes and wants of the million. We
beg to state that we do not. We take a deep and
earnest interest in the poor man's ounce of tea and

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

his half-hundred of coals. In this respect, a street
child's China orange is of far more consequence to us
than Lombard-street. We do not care, if the whole
bench of Bishops should dine without an appetite, if
thereby we could fill a dozen little craving stomachs
with food.</p>

<p>Mr. Snap, <i>per se</i>, was not a man whom we could
have wished to pursue a strictly anti-Malthusian
career on this earth. How spitefully and brutally he
behaved towards Aubrey! Yet, was this altogether
opposed to nature, instinct, and reason? Why does a
small cur bark at the heels of a Newfoundland dog?
Why should a little "gent," whose opportunities of
enjoyment fate has woefully curtailed in this world,
feel any particular love or admiration for one of
Nature's curled darlings, especially when the darling
is in distress, and rapidly going self-doomed to ruin?
To us the sympathy, admiration, and fidelity, so often
manifested by the "lower" towards the "upper
classes," as they are called, has often proved matter
of wonder and surprise. Why should a servant like
his master, a clerk his employer, or a serf his lord?
Why should a poor man respect a rich man, or a
pauper continually touch his battered old scarecrow
hat for nothing, as he does when he is breaking stones
on the road, to every well-dressed passer-by, and to
every carriage, shut or open, whose dust only helps
to aggravate the thirst of his leathery throat? But
they do. And the oddness of the matter is, that
the feeling is so seldom reciprocated. We see occasionally 
in the obituary of the "Times," the death
of Thomas Nokes or John Styles, recorded as having

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

been for sixty years the confidential and trusted
servant of Messrs. Smith or Lord Fitzbord; but we
are not told that had the said Nokes or Styles lived
a little longer, he would have been superannuated,
and left to starve. Of course, such is not always the
case. But we are not dealing with exceptions at
this moment. We were defending ourselves from
the possible charge of sneering at the cheap luxuries
of the <i>genus</i> "gent," in the shape of a low or high
music-hall, or of the perfidious cigar of Albion which
poisons the aristocratic air. We said nothing against
the coarse fumes of the bricklayer's matutinal pipe.
He is no "gent," we know, and is not responsible
for the "vamp" work of the contractor, who runs
up those awfully insecure palaces of Aladdin, in
the short summer Belgravian nights. One of the
most snobbish things we ever read was apropos of
cigars, in an abominable French novel which we got
from a circulating library, whence it had doubtless
been procured and read by many a fashionably fast
young lady of the present day. The writer constantly 
informs us, that his hero of the moment is
smoking a cigar of extravagant price&mdash;we forget
how many sous. It is as if one should say, as the
finishing touch to the portrait of a nobleman, after
describing himself, his hair, eyes, moustache, stature,
age, coat and pantaloons, boots and gloves, "and,
moreover, he had a one and fourpenny cigar in his
mouth." The Frenchman's exquisite of the first
water of course rides "un beau cheval Anglais;"
he is blas&eacute; and cynical in love, brutal in his manners
towards women, a scoundrel, whom it would do one

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

good to kick; but he smokes a cigar at a franc and a
half, while planning some depraved outrage, which
no healthy brain could invent. It strikes us that
there is a great deal of snobbishness of late growth
in France. We are afraid that the disease spreads
with commerce and civilisation. Where shall we
have to go to find a gentleman by-and-bye? We
suppose that there will be a few left for some time to
come in Hungary and Morocco, some obscure parts
of Turkey, and our North-American provinces.</p>

<p>We were speaking of Mr. Grinderby, and the
present state of his affairs. The management of the
Aubrey estates had proved a very comfortable and
profitable affair; but on the whole his reputation
began to get into bad odour. A number of suspicious
circumstances and shady transactions had more or less
got wind and obtained credence. A certain Vice-Chancellor 
had said something, which showed that
even his old-womanish perceptions had been awakened
to something like an approximate apprehension of the
true state of the case. Mr. Grinderby was also much
troubled about his eldest son, Edgar. That young
man had shown generous and honourable traits,
which alarmed the hard, worldly old reprobate, his
father, who, to speak the truth, had invested a good
deal of paternal affection in his degenerate boy. Not
only did the lad display an unconquerable dislike to
legal studies, but he had, on more than one occasion,
shown great disgust for some of his father's proceedings. 
He had actually sympathised with one or two
ruined clients, and had devoted some of the money
given him to expend in an embryo law library, and

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

in furnishing his chambers in the Temple, to relieving
the wants of a decayed tradesman and his family,
whom Grinderby <i>p&egrave;re</i> had ruined. In process of
this interference, Edgar Grinderby gained a knowledge 
of legal procedure and iniquities, which he
would never have acquired from books or study, more
particularly since he never could persuade himself to
read for the law. These revelations were not purposely 
made by the poor tradesman, who would have
spared the father a reproach for the sake of the son.
But ugly facts would peep out, would intrude themselves, 
and could not be concealed. When the man,
who had been formerly a successful newsvendor and
stationer, told his two eldest children to thank their
benefactor, Mr. Edgar, the second, a sharp little girl,
refused to take any notice of him, and said:</p>

<p>"Me shan't speak to Mr. Grinderby; Mr. Grinderby
wicked, bad man. Mr. Grinderby ruin my dear papa,
and make little Mary hungry."</p>

<p>Her young brother coloured and then turned pale,
and seated himself in the furthest corner, his little
breast heaving with indignation.</p>

<p>"Come, Harry!" said the perplexed father, "and
speak to this gentleman!"</p>

<p>The boy did not answer.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, sir?" continued his parent.</p>

<p>A passionate burst of sobs choked the little fellow's
utterance. "Didn't you say," he articulated, "that
it was&mdash;him&mdash;Mr. Grinderby, that took mamma's bed&mdash;away, 
and k-k-k-killed her with cold? I wish I
was bigger, and then I'd kill him, that I would."
And the little fellow clenched his fist and shook it at

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

Edgar, who was dreadfully shocked and disconcerted,
"Yes," continued the child, "he sent mamma away
to Heaven, and we shall never see her any more."</p>

<p>Young Grinderby hastily grasped the hand of his
father's client, and left the house. He did not return
home; and the next day went to stay with a friend,
and wrote thence to his father, asking his pardon,
but saying that he would not be a burden to him
any more, and would seek his own living. Old
Grinderby was at first in a towering rage, and wrote
his son a letter, which he got copied by Snap, who
had now risen, or rather fallen to his confidence,
telling him that he need never darken his door any
more, nor expect from him a single shilling. Whatever 
it was that the youth answered, it perplexed the
shrewd old lawyer sadly. It was something unlike
anything he had known. It opened to him another
view of life&mdash;one of which he had never before
dreamt. His son, whom he had hoped to see Lord
Chancellor, or a puisne judge at least&mdash;for Grinderby
worshipped the Woolsack and the Bench with a kind
of grim idolatry&mdash;his son, whom he had ruled with a
rod of iron from infancy to puberty, had commenced
his rebellious course by leaving the circuit, soon after
he had joined; the young barrister having begun and
ended his legal career at a midland county-town, where
he made the most distinguished debut within the memory 
of the oldest member of the Bar. Old Grinderby
was actually complimented by a judge before whom he
happened to appear on some business of a client,
upon the talent and promise displayed by Edgar.
To the father's dismay, nothing would induce his son

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

to continue afterwards on the circuit. In vain had
the elder Grinderby touted and canvassed for briefs.
The younger scion of that honourable house declared
that the very thought of the horrid midland county-town, 
where he had gained his first laurels, made him
ill.</p>

<p>"He did not know," he said, "which was worst
to endure, the filth of the cases, the fetid closeness of
the reeking atmosphere of the court where they were
heard, or to mark the injustice of the practice and
administration of the law"&mdash;that law which his father,
and the majority of vulgar and inferior men of his
stamp, held in such vast respect. He felt it to be the
worship of a moral car of Juggernaut rolling chiefly
over human distress.</p>

<p>About that time, occurred the death, in that very
Court, of one of the best and kindliest, and most intellectual 
judges who ever adorned the Bench&mdash;a
man whose mind was <i>not</i> narrowed by the sharpening
process on the grindstone of the law. He died of the
poison stench of foul attorneydom and its clients,
in an atmosphere robbed of oxygen by the breath of
provincial villainy, and the exhalation from perspiring
rascality, iniquity, and meanness, augmented by the
unusual crowding of the unwashed and unkempt
B&oelig;otians of the district, in order to hear the details
of a more than ordinary number of cases "unfit for
publication." A couple of broken window-panes
might have saved the precious life of one, for whose
sake we might have fancied that whole town spared
by a special act of Divine mercy, in spite of its
black calendar of abominable crimes. As he fell

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

forward and died, he was in the act of addressing a
solemn warning to the selfishness of the upper and
middle classes; telling them that they neglected their
duty as men and citizens, in erecting and maintaining
an icy barrier between themselves and the lower
orders. He was pointing out the want of sympathy
between the rich and poor, which is the great blot of
the age in this country. And in doing this, he died,
as one may say, asphyxiated by the fumes of crime.</p>

<p>The death of this good man made a deep impression 
upon Edgar Grinderby. It crowned his
strong inclination to abandon the law, with a final
determination which nothing could break or alter.
A stranger might have pitied old Grinderby, had he
witnessed his disappointment, when he was acquainted
with his son's resolution. And now he was defied,
abandoned, insulted, not by words addressed to himself; 
for Edgar's language was most respectful and
affectionate even in its firmness; but in the person of
his cherished deity, Mammon, whom he had hugged
to his heart of hearts, for whom he had lied, plundered, 
oppressed, and stolen. It was hard, very
hard! He had been proud of Edgar&mdash;as a vulgar
parent is proud of a gentlemanly son. He had
educated him at Oxford, and paid his debts; with, for
him, but little show of indignation. And now all his
hopes were baffled by this eccentric obstinacy, this
romantic nonsense, this absurd morbid mania of
goodness; and finally his roof abandoned, his wealth
despised, and his assistance rejected, before he had an
opportunity of refusing it. We know "How sharper
than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

child;" but what is even this, compared with the
agony of feeling that a favourite child shrinks from
the contemplation of parental misconduct and vice,
and exhibits in return for all the affection lavished
by a fond, though erring father, the disobedience of
virtue, and the ingratitude of worth?</p>

<p>As we have spoken of the atrocity of country
crimes and provincial wickedness, we must here
hazard the observation, that whatever may be said
about the demoralisation of London, there is nothing
in it to be met with worse than, if equal to, rural
atrocity and sin, when they are found in the full
perfection of their unmolested fungous growth.
There is nothing coarser than the courtesan, nothing
rougher than the ruffian, nothing viler than the
villain of your "sweet Auburn, loveliest village of
the plain," when self-planted wickedness crops out,
as it will sometimes do. There are young men, ay,
and women too, in the country to whom town can
impart no dye of deeper hue, no obscener depravation
of soul. The impure and diseased mind broods in
seclusion and obscurity, and is apt to produce hideous
monsters and abortions of sin, <i>Βλαστάνειν ἀκορέστον ὀιζυν</i>.
We have known country lawyers even worse than
Grinderby himself; men to whom Satan will assign 
the highest places on that roll from which no
attorney's name will ever be struck off when once
inscribed there by the illustrious Head of the Profession 
and Chief Examiner in evil proficiency himself.</p>

<p>When Mr. Grinderby, senior, found, after a few
months, that Edgar did not apply to him for money,

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

he wrote a reproachful letter to the young man,
accusing him of deserting him in his old age. Upon
this Edgar called, and even stayed to dinner on his
father's representation that he was very unwell.
When the old man had drunk his bottle of port, he
told his son that, if he would return home, he might
do as he pleased, and read as much poetry as he
liked. He might even have a piano, and smoke in
his bedroom all day. He might keep a hunter; and a
mistress too, the old sinner hinted, if he wished it.
Edgar was no Puritan, but he shrank from this
coarse and brutal ebullition of paternal regard. He
thanked his father respectfully, but said that he had
chosen his path in life, and would abide by it, if his
father pleased.</p>

<p>"But I don't please," growled old Grinderby, utterly
confounded by his son's conduct and determination.</p>

<p>All, however, that he could gain from him was a
promise to dine at home once a month. Then Edgar
apart in her own room, tenderly kissed his mother,
from whom he had hidden neither his motives nor
his mode of life, and who sighed deeply while she
approved his conduct. A very tender, good, weak
woman that mother, with a strong chapel bias; but
she loved her son dearly, and had imparted to him a
great deal of her better nature.</p>

<p>And what was Edgar Grinderby's mode of life?
From a newsvendor whom his father had ruined he
got an introduction to a good-natured reporter on a
daily paper, a man, like most of his class, of great
and varied attainments, of singular shrewdness and

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

knowledge of the world, and yet perfect simplicity of
character and utter genuine unselfishness of disposition. 
This gentleman eked out his modest income,
when Parliament was not sitting, by compiling
various cheap works for publishers, for which his
discursive information and extraordinary memory
and intelligence eminently qualified him. He was a
walking encyclop&aelig;dia of dates, facts, quotation, and
precedent. He knew something of everything, and
not a little of a great many subjects. He was struck
by Edgar's story and ingenuous deportment, and
offered, not only to teach him short-hand gratis, but
to give him some second-hand literary work. "I'll
guarantee you a pound a-week, my boy, to start
with," he said. Nor did he ever make a sixpence
out of the lad; but, on the contrary, actually contributed 
in a very small, but not the less valuable,
degree to his means of existence. Edgar, unlike
Arthur Aubrey, began at the beginning of the profession 
he had chosen, and gradually, but surely,
worked his way up. Sometimes he would look in at
"Cogers' Hall," or other "halls" not of "dazzling
light," but of tobacco-flavoured discussion, and there
learnt to express himself in public with fluency and
precision. His opening speech on "Whether it is
or is not expedient to maintain the Established
Church in Ireland?" was considered a masterpiece of
youthful eloquence; and the illustrious Jack Grady,
a descendant of the Irish kings, the most facetious
orator of the Fleet-street House of Commons, whose
career gave rise to unlimited speculations as to what

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

he might, could, should, or would have done there, had
he met with a constituency sufficiently tipsy at their
own expense to return him, actually rose up and
shook him by the hand, and offered to borrow half a
crown and stand two glasses of whisky as a preliminary 
to proposing his health and speech. In this
excellent company we must for the present leave
him.</p>

<p class="right"><i>From the Scrivener's Heritage, A Play in Five Actes</i>. 1690.</p>

</div>

<p>ALTOGETHER, the mind of Mr. Grinderby, senior,
of Webb's Fields, attorney-at-law, and rogue by Act

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

of Parliament, was sorely perplexed and troubled.
His only son had blighted his views, as we have just
recorded. His little establishment in the Grove of the
Evangelist had died a natural death, if it might be
so called, considering that his black-browed Egeria,
to whom we reluctantly introduced our readers in
the first volume of this history, one night indulged
in an over-dose of brandy, and a coroner's inquest
had been held in consequence, which caused Grinderby
to tremble, lest his name should appear in the papers,
which, indeed, it did in one weekly print. No less
than three copies of that paper were sent to his wife
by "friends" of the family; but the good dame, not
boasting the best eyesight in the world, gave them
all to her husband to glance over for her. Luckily,
there was an account of a Dorcas meeting in the same
issue, which enabled him perfectly to account for the
mystery of the three papers so kindly sent. But this
was not all which, about this period, disturbed the
equanimity of lawyer Grinderby, and made him wince
as if he had been stung by an Eastern gad-fly. One
evening, about the period of the commencement of our
resumed narrative, Mr. Grinderby had just finished
his day's dirty work, and had also washed his legal
hands physically clean, and was about to proceed home
to Peckham, in the identical trap described so characteristically 
by Tops, drawn by another pair of old
horses; for Grinderby never bought them young;
when a note was placed in his hands, which the sole
remaining clerk said was left by a dirty-looking man
in a dust-coloured coat, with hair to match, the contents 
of which caused Mr. Grinderby as much trepidation 

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

and annoyance, as any writ he had issued for
many a day had occasioned a poverty-stricken debtor.
Mr. Grinderby sat gazing at this note, until Tops,
who was waiting in the square with the trap and the
eldest Miss Grinderby, fancied that the old lawyer
had had a fit, and "was 'arf a mind," as he expressed
it, to jump off the box and run up in search of him.
At length, however, he came down looking grey in
the face with illness or anxiety, and got into the old
mourning-coach, as some were in the habit of styling
it. Miss Adalgisa Grinderby put down her novel of
"Henrietta Temple," and made some indifferent observation 
about her "pa" being late. Mr. Grinderby
sat frowning, in fierce and moody silence. Tops, on
his part, indulged in some milder meditation, and
more than once burst out laughing as if in remembrance 
of something funny which had occurred to
him in early life.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blest if I don't believe it really was
him I see. I've never clapped eyes on him, since
about the time he opened that corfy-shop in the
Whitechapel-road! What a game that was! I never
laughed so much since, nor afore. I do believe it was
that as kept me alive the first year in that old &mdash;&mdash;'s"
(tst-tst to the horses) "service. I should like to meet
him again, and to know how he managed to get out
of the bis'ness. It seemed a bang-up affair, but
pr'aps," said Tops, reflecting, "it was all hinvestment 
and no profit. I never shall forget, no, not
if I were to live as long as Mythooselum, how he
did carry on, when that 'sloop' hestablishment was
opened. How he did chaff the folks, hespecially the

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

perlice, from that open winder as he took the sash
out of. The moment he saw a Bobby, he was down on
him like a knife, inquiring whether his coat-pocket
was water-tight, in case of any dampness in the
pervisions; if he'd lately seen that all the meat-safes
was locked careful, and taken the senses* of all the
cook-maids in his districk. There was a young Irishman 
who'd only just joined the Force. He cut up
uncommon rough, he did. We had to square him
with half a pint of whisky, and he got so drunk that
he locked up a working man for being sober, and
only kept his place next morning by hard swearing,
and the evidence of a lot more perlicemen. Vell,
he was the rummest customer hever I come across,
and I wish he hadn't bolted out jest now so sudden
that I couldn't stop him. Whatever could he be
doing on that old staircase of Grinderby's? Pr'aps it
was him he's been a seeing. Come hup will yer?"
And so saying Tops solemnly and deliberately applied
his heavy old-fashioned whip to the pair of ancient,
half-bred, Flemish coach-horses he was driving,
which he had privately nicknamed "Catsmeat" and
"Dogsmeat," "a distinction," as he said, "without
much difference."</p>

<p class="small">[*Query census.&mdash;<i>P. D.</i>]</p>

<p>Let us seize an opportunity of peeping over Mr.
Grinderby's shoulder as he read and re-read the
epistle which occasioned him so much concern and
annoyance. It was as follows:</p>

<p>"OLD HOSS,</p>

<p>"I have come back at last to this cuss of an island

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

of yours, just to remind you of a little affair between
us, which I dare say you fancied was settled and
done with long ago. 'Tain't! and what's more, 'tain't
going to be just yet, unless some one chooses to fix
it at my price, and not yours. As a particularly old
friend, you'll be glad to hear that I am quite well and
safe from throat attacks; so well you'd scarcely know
me at present. I hope you're the same. Your health,
I reckon, depends entirely upon mine; for if I was
taken ill, you'd follow as a matter of course. Curious!
Isn't it? but true.</p>

<p>"My speculations on the other side of the water
have turned out shadily enough! The last time I
was entirely ruined there, I failed somehow to recuperate. 
A little bird on this side of the whale-pond
told me just when I was casting about for a new start
in life, of our friend A. A. having got up a pretty tall
financial tree. A sort of Wellingtonia gigantea, and
not being likely to come down again either, without
assistance. The same ornithological correspondent
informed me that <i>you</i> are managing his property for
all parties, including the young gentleman himself.
Perhaps you think I've come over to congratulate
him on the subject. Now there's a certain document,
which you thought you saw burnt with your own
eyes. You were mistaken. It was only an office
copy, which, I made&mdash;a counterfeit, a 'duffer'&mdash;a
notion which you ought to appreciate, I'm sure.
Smart! wasn't it? Now it strikes me that it is a
document written on a very incombustible sort of
paper, and that it will take a considerable investment
in lucifers to set a light to it.</p>

<p>"Your welfare was the first thing which I made
the object of my inquiries on landing. This is not
the season for canvas-back ducks, but I have brought
over a barrel of Newtown pippins (our remarkably
fine apple), and shall have the pleasure of sending
you some, together with a few hickory nuts, of which
I beg your acceptance. They are very hard to crack!
Hoping shortly for the pleasure of an interview, at
your convenience,</p>

<p class="right">"I am,<br/>

"Yours truly,<br/>

"J. S. M.</p>

<p>"P.S. Write to these initials, P. O., Deptford.
You may enclose the first half of a fifty, as I am short
of cash, the remainder to follow."</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby fairly writhed under the information 
contained in this epistle. In the first place, he
had believed, as Manvers (for of course it was he)
intimated in his letter, that the document referred to
had indeed been burnt. It was then but a fac-simile,
hurriedly substituted by a species of juggling trick,
which he had seen apparently committed to the
flames. Again, he never dreamt that Manvers would
have dared to visit England thus, with capital
punishment threatening him if detected. It was
evident that no trifle would have tempted him to run
such a risk; and now he, Grinderby, trembled for
the safety of the ex-clerk and felon rowdy, from whom
he had thought himself perfectly secure, and whose
letters from America he had never replied to, and,
in fact, barely glanced over when he received them.

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

If Manvers were taken, though without his instrumentality, 
and against his wishes and hopes, might
not that worthy conceive that he had been betrayed
by him, and peach in revenge? What? Ay, there
was the rub. Even if he were taken at all, without
suspicion of his lawyer accomplice, he might tell
everything through mere wanton spite and malevolence. 
Altogether, Mr. Grinderby was never in his life
before in so unenviable a frame of mind; and when
he alighted at his house at Peckham, he spoke so
savagely to Tops, that it nearly elicited an answer
from that vivacious "whip," which would have
ended his three years and a half service at the expiration 
of a month from that time. But Tops had
his own reasons for putting up with old Grinderby's
temper a little longer. It had been his Susan's
sovereign pleasure, that he should enter into and
remain in the lawyer's service, and Susan was expected 
very shortly in town. Yes, she had written
to him that she was about starting for Paris <i>en route</i>
to England from Florence, with her mistress, the
distinguished foreign lady with whom she had gone
abroad. During the whole period of her absence,
Susan had been an excellent correspondent, and a
more educated lover than Tops would have trembled
for his chance of marrying a girl who, from her
letters, was evidently making such progress in refinement 
and knowledge. But Tops, honest fellow,
feared nothing of the kind, nor indeed had he any
real grounds for so doing. Susan had no idea of
marrying a "gentleman;" and as for those who
would have trifled with her in any but an honourable

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

sense, she entertained for the whole class an unmitigated 
contempt and disgust, which it would, indeed,
be a blessing to see shared by the majority of girls in
her position. But we will now let the reader into a
secret. At Susan's earnest solicitation, Tops had
been labouring hard to "complete his eddicashun,"
as he at first called it. And though far from perfect,
he had made wonderful progress. Having imparted
his wish to young Grinderby, that noble-hearted young
fellow had actually for a short time devoted three or
four hours a week to his tuition, under the pretence
of smoking his cigar in the harness-room. Therefore, 
when we just now quoted a brief soliloquy of the
now more erudite Tops, our readers may have noticed
some little improvement. In future we shall gladly
divest his language of much of its vulgarity and
cockneyisms. Not that it must be supposed that his
dialect had acquired anything like Attic excellence.
It was merely an improved Doric.</p>

<p>On the days when Mr. Tops received a letter from
Susan, he was in the habit of wearing a flower in his
button-hole. In the winter he would compound by
adorning the horses with very spicy pink rosettes, a
practice which Mr. Grinderby would have put down
with great severity, had it not been for the interference
of his daughter. Indeed, that young lady insisted so
strongly on his always using them, that he was forced
to have green and yellow rosettes made for ordinary
occasions.</p>

<p>Susan had a double motive in causing Tops to
reside with Grinderby. One was that she thought it
would keep him quiet and out of mischief, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

other that she had a vague notion of learning something 
about the progress of Aubrey's affairs. This
had hitherto turned out a failure. Ever since
Aubrey's sudden dissolution of his partnership in
poverty with Tops, the latter had found no trace of
his former master. In Grinderby's employ, indeed, he
had little opportunity; but for at least two years he
divided all his spare time between Susan and Lindley
Murray on the one hand, and the attempt to find out
Aubrey's retreat on the other. At last he came to
the conclusion that Aubrey was either dead or abroad,
and gave up the search, and his regret gradually
yielded to the composing effect of time. There was one
thing which seriously perplexed and disturbed Tops.
This was a constant inclination to upset Grinderby's
carriage. When it so happened that the road was
bounded on either side by a very deep and particularly 
foul and muddy ditch, this desire became almost
a monomania, and required the strongest exercise of
self-restraint on the part of the unconscious attorney's
coachman. This was only when Mr. Grinderby was
alone inside; for Tops was far too gallant to meditate
risking injury to Miss Grinderby's limbs, clothes, or
nervous system.</p>

<p>"She's as vicious as she is ugly," said Tops, "and
when she's drest out looks more like a boiled weasel
in creenolyne, than a young woman as a man would
leave his beer to go after. But no, no, it wouldn't
wash, I say."</p>

<p>Persons unacquainted with the phraseology of Mr.
Tops, might have imagined this to be a considerate
allusion to the young lady's dress, which was not the

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

case. The good angel of Tops, whom one might
imagine a winged jockey with doll's curls and blue
eyes, intervened to preserve even Grinderby from a
proceeding which, however just, would have condemned 
Tops, in a fiduciary point of view, as a Jehu
of principle and worth.</p>

<p>"You see this is how it was," as Tops afterwards
apologetically explained to Susan; "I ate his victuals
and took his money, and wore his blessed old huniform, 
disguise, I call it, and so I couldn't very well
tip over his aged conveyance among the effets, and
them wriggling bull-heads, which I believe is the souls
of young lawyers learning the first rudymens of
their profession in black holes and slimy corners. I
couldn't do it, you see, all jolly and straightforrerd,
because I was in the old limb's service! Otherways,
it was very tempting!"</p>

<p>To say that Tops did not burn for emancipation
from the lawyer's service and the "disguise," which
was a brown suit, very long in the skirts, like a
bad imitation of the late Lord Harrington's liveries,
would be a great deviation from the truth. In fact,
he was like a young street athlete in an overcoat on
a hot day, longing to appear in his flesh-coloured
tights and sparkling cincture before an admiring
crowd of spectators. Tops felt himself in a chrysalis
state. It was, he said, a case of "grub," and no
mistake, but he didn't exactly mean any allusion to
the entomological transformation. The fact is, that
Mr. Tops somewhat rejoiced in his immunity from
recognition by his ancient "pals." He had grown
a large pair of whiskers, and wore his hair much

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

longer. He never went to any of his old haunts,
and upon one occasion sustained an inquiring stare
from the mighty Binsby himself, with an unruffled
serenity of non-avowal of his identity. But when
that great personage proceeded to say: "Young
man! I think we have met before somewhere,"
Tops utterly routed him by asking him if he had
formerly been in the "Black Brigade, and been tried
at Clerkenwell Sessions on suspicion of having stolen
a hatchment."</p>

<p>There was but one person whom Tops longed very
much to see in "a convivial pint of view," as he said,
and this was the Downy Cove. Since that estimable
person's brief and meteor-like career in the Whitechapel-road, 
as the spirited proprietor of the "Cabman's 
Pride," as it was called, a coffee-shop conducted 
upon entirely new principles, the Downy had
utterly disappeared from the circle of society of which
he was once the joy and the ornament.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with no ordinary degree of excitement 
and interest that Tops, when perched lately on
the summit of Mr. Grinderby's dingy drab hammercloth, 
saw the Downy issue rapidly from the doorway 
of Mr. Grinderby's staircase, and disappear so
quickly that he in vain sought to attract his attention
by alternate shouting and whistling.</p>

<p>"He was uncommon good company, you see,"
said Tops. "I wish he'd a bin more steady in
bis'ness. Two hundred pound ain't to be got every
day to take a house with. But he used to give away
the corfy and victuals to them as couldn't pay, and
them as could soon took the hint and followed such a

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

noble example. And then he was overtook by liquor
on the morning that the shop opened, and I dare say
he run a dead heat with it ever after, till the evening
after the shop closed. It took only three months,"
said Tops, reflectively, "and it might have took three
years; but he must have come to grief in the end.
As to setting him up in business, one might as well
have started a monkey to sell nuts in a fair, and given
him a cocoa-nut full of threepenny pieces for capittle,
in the expectation of a large return. I only wish that
angel in keeping had settled an annuity on him, paid
weekly. That might have kept him in the centre of
his hadmiring friends," continued Tops; "but I don't
know that he'd ever have been sober again. He was
born for vice-issitude, though there ain't no vice in
him for that matter. I'd have given a month's
celery to have been able to stop him this arternoon,
if it were only to ask him, if he ever saw my poor
governor again. But when Susan comes back, we
must put our heads together to find them both out,
leastways what has become of my poor master. I say
'master,' " added Tops, "because it were a pleasure
to serve him. In spite of his behaviour to her, he
was kind to every one else, a precious sight too kind
and considyrate for his own interest. He was a
gentleman as would give away his own living to a
parcel of poor folks. I never see any one so thoughtful
of others. Why, even when we were in lodgings,
there was a poor old paralytic creetur used to come
by every day with groundsel, and I do believe the
governor went and bought a bird on purpose to have
an excuse to deal with her.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

<p>"There's one thing I can't understamd," he continued, 
"which is, that my Susan never pitches into
him now. Indeed, she left it off the very day I went
to take the passage tickets in the Boulogne steamer
for her and her new foreign missus to start. 'Tops!'
says she, 'it's your duty never to lose sight of Mr.
Aubrey. He's been a kind master to you, Tops.
Don't you let him want for nothing.' And I never
did whilst I could help it, leastways till he got restive
and bolted clean out of sight. He said he wouldn't
drag me down to poverty and starvation with him,
as if I'd been a rich gent like himself, and been
robbed by the lieyers."</p>

<p>"I'd give all I'm worth or likely to be worth in
the world, except my Susan, to know what's become
of him," observed Tops to his mother one Sunday
afternoon, when that venerable dame had called in just
to run over his linen. "My belief is he throwed
himself in the river after <i>her</i>, or went on the ice in
the Regent's Park when it wouldn't bear, along with
a lot of other sooicides. It's my opinion that when
a man's ruined by solicitors, he goes in for skating a
purpose to avoid being a fellow-seedee, and 'seedy'
enough a many of 'em are afore they do it. Then
the coroner he calls it a 'watery end,' and inquires
whether the drags was handy. And the perlice is
instructed to take up the next lot as venture on in
the same manner. And you might as well expect
a tom-cat to go into the water to save a litter of
drownded puppies, as a British Bobby to venture on
the ice when it isn't strong enough to bear. Safe's
the word with them, and then they'll go on as if they

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

was wanted. Not that I blame them much for that
neither. Then there's a row in the Sunday papers
about the ranger of the parks, and letting the water
be so deep, and breaking it for the water-fowl, hetsaytera, 
hetsaytera, hetsaytera. It's all beginning at
the wrong end, that's what it is. If people was not
unfortynate, they wouldn't drownd themselves. I
know what I'd do, if I had the power. I'd set a lot
of starving navvies to deepen the hornamental water,
and I'd show 'em how to make it useful, I would. The
first day's black frost, providing it wasn't too severe,
I'd start every attorney in England skating there.
Them as couldn't cut out six and eightpence on
the ice, should slide. I'd admit no one inside the
railings that day without a certificate, for fear of
accidenx. And if the ice was broken round the side,
and they did all go to the bottom, it would be the
greatest gain that England ever see in my opinion.
But," concluded Tops, with a mournful shake of the
head, "these are the kind of dreams that occur to a
man when he's handling the ribbons, and fancies himself 
a hemperor. Water is not the helement that
lawyers need stand much in fear of. Why don't I
wish for a four-in-hand millanyone at once?" he asked.
And his mother, who paused in the act of lifting a
saucerful of tea to her lips in the front-loft parlour,
replied very wisely:</p>

<p>"Ah! why not, James?" She thought him the
cleverest young man out, and had even recommended
a female friend to consult him about a mythical property, 
which some one had said was in the family,
before her great uncle went to America; "for," she

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

said, "he's own head coachman to lawyer Grinderby,
and drives him to town every morning." According
to Mrs. Tops's notion, this was a species of legal
education in itself.</p>

<p>"Bless her dear old heart!" said Tops, "I do
believe if I was to drive the Rooshian ambassador,
she'd think I could speak Rooshian."</p>

<p>And so she would have done. Oh, happy ignorance 
of matters legal, believing in the forms and
names of things, believing in the judgments of
judges and the verdicts of juries, the incorruptibility
of the Bar, and the respectability of respectable
and "eminent" firms of attorneys&mdash;unconscious that
modern success is in itself suggestive of wrong. Oh,
delightful old-womanish ignorance and credulity,
believing in our statesmen, our generals, and admirals 
(with what old-womanish natural sympathy
we pause not to declare), believing in our statues
and memorials, our eulogies and threnodies, our
spasmodic deifications of incapacity, treachery, connivance, 
imbecility, and crime. Is true fame worth
having, when shared thus? Is there any true fame
in, or of, this age? Are any secret historians writing
the truth, we mean the true truth, <i>la vera verit&agrave;</i>, of
this period of imposture? Have preceding ages been
as false and falsely recorded, and is all history a
myth, or rather a tissue of falsehoods like the inscriptions 
chiselled by our sculptor masons now? Were
all the great worthies and heroes of antiquity thieves
and felons with stolen laurels, which should have
graced the brows of other and unknown men? Did
it happen in former times that a man of mediocre

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

intellect did stupidly and doggedly resist all improvement 
and enlightenment, invention and reform, until
forced to yield little by little, inch by inch, to the
pressure of necessity, and that such a man was chronicled 
as the pioneer and founder of all that which he
had in reality opposed, while the bones of the true
founders and pioneers were ground to mix with the
material of his lying cenotaph, the monument of his
pretended virtues and fictitious fame? We are inclined 
to think that it was not quite so bad of old.
And perhaps it will not be quite so bad in the future,
when the facts of the nineteenth century shall be
finally recorded in the annals of mankind. The real
story of the Crimean campaign, for instance, may
yet be told. It takes ten years, more or less, now-a-days, 
to forget what a modern hero or statesman has
done, or not done, and to invent a career for him.
As for works of art, it is fortunate that our tributes in
brass and marble are not likely to survive. The very
bricks and mortar of this epoch are not of a durable
composition. That which has been fitly but vulgarly
described as the "literature of bosh," will haply return
to the paper-mills of the period, and perish with the
paper on which it is printed to the disgust of true
thinking men.</p>

<p>FROM the Theatre of La Pergola at Florence a
lady is being escorted to her home in triumph. She is
seated in a carriage alone, surrounded by a shouting
mob of men of all ages, among whom youth predominates. 
They have taken the horses out of her
carriage, and are drawing it along as if she were
some female conqueror. And so she is, "Melpomene
Victrix!" She has conquered those impressionable
hearts with song. She wears a light and exquisite
coronal of gold round her small and classic head.
It has just been enthusiastically presented to her by
her Florentine admirers. She has triumphed at
Rome, Milan, and Naples. She has been honoured
by imperial recognition at St. Petersburg. The
blaze of the torches illuminates her pale and beautiful 
countenance, touched with melancholy, but

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

serene and composed, as if all that passed around
her were a natural accompaniment of her destiny, a
tribute to the Royalty of Song, of which she was
crowned a Queen by universal acclamation and
rapturous consent. Ever and anon, as some louder
plaudit or more lively demonstration greeted her, she
would smile with touching sweetness, and incline
her head with exquisite grace. Behold! she has
reached her home. As she descends from her carriage, 
she is almost in danger from the pressure of her
adorers, each of whom at that moment is ready to
die&mdash;histrionically&mdash;at her feet. She walks over
crushed violets and roses into the favoured building.
When she has passed, young Italy fights for the
flowers which her foot may have touched. Then the
crowd disperses to refresh itself with mild potations 
suited to the clime. Anon it reassembles and
treats the object of its adoration to a serenade; a
somewhat superfluous tribute one cannot help thinking, 
but this is an idea of the unimpressionable sons
of Albion. This is in Italy: and is not "La Diva"
a daughter of Moldavia, naturalised and taught to
warble in Italy; a mountain sylph, a forest nymph,
a river goddess, a cantatrice of mysterious origin,
as it is given out? Some, indeed, say she is the
offspring of a Boyard; others declare her to be the
lost child of a Pomeranian noble family captured in
infancy by brigands, and found singing by a fountain, 
like a bird, at the age of twelve years, by her
brother, who had long deemed her dead. Others
held to a Georgian or Circassian theory of her extraction. 
At all events, there was sufficient romance

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

talked of her to furnish a dozen stories in a Milanese
"Family Herald," or penny "Florence Journal,"
had such a thing existed. She is known, however,
as the Signora Bianca Stellini, and shouts rend the
air, when she comes forward on the hotel balcony, in
her chaste robe of white muslin, and leans forward,
the Giulietta of thousands of rapturous Romeos; that
is, in their thought and desire. At length she
retires, and the effervescence subsides. A party of
Germans alone continue their bacchanalian orgies at
a distant restaurant, and their deep choruses ever
and anon startle the stillness of the moonlight
night. They are chiefly from Rome, these absurd
"younkers!" Let us listen for a moment to their
harmless clamour. What is that ridiculous chant
about the Ponte Mole? It is something very like
nursery rhymes chanted by a stentorian chorus of
grown-up men. How little pleases the manly
German mind! Well, they are manly after all in
their way. Manly? Look at their beards, and pipes,
and bronzed faces! Still it is a pity that their ceremonials 
should be so meaningless and childish. But,
hearken! There is the silence preceding something
of superior interest. A pale, wild-looking, romantic,
intellectual young man has risen, and is about to
address them. He is Heinrich von Weber, the most
promising of the artist-students at Rome, a poet, and
enthusiastic Federalist. His picture of the "Apotheosis 
of Margaret," in the everlasting "Faust,"
made a great sensation in the Exhibition at Rome
last year. The King of Bavaria affected his society,
and was introduced by him to Roman artist life, the

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

Caff&eacute; Greco, and even the Lepre, where one ate
"porcospino," "agro dolce," larks, thrushes, and
robins, and smoked pipes between the courses, even
when ladies, chiefly British and Russian, were among
the guests. Had not the illustrious Humboldt presented 
the young Saxon with a gold medal? He was
the youth of the hour, doomed, it may be, to be but
little heard of hereafter. But no matter; there he
was, the leader of that German <i>&eacute;lite</i>, the king of all
their folly, as well as their captain in things more
serious; such as politics and fatherland, a duel, a
picture, a poem, or a serious song. With due solemnity 
the illustrious youth addresses his beloved
countrymen as follows. He spoke, and drew forth
from the capacious pocket of his trousers a bronze-coloured 
shoe, of small feminine proportions, which
had apparently done some service to its fair owner;
and pouring into it, regardless of a leak, as much
red wine as it would hold, from a huge flask-shaped
bottle on the table (it was cheaper than any beer
those students of art could procure there), he proceeded 
enthusiastically, amid the frantic excitement
of all present, to quaff the contents to the health of
the Fra&uuml;lein Bianca. The rest followed his example.
As each successively reached this novel drinking-cup
to his lips, regardless of the ruby stream which
trickled from the unmistakable hole worn between
the sole and upper-leather, the whole party shouted
and yelled "Hoch!" with acclamations that seemed
to gain strength as the shoe went round. "To the
Goddess!" they cried. The "Queen of Song!" the
"Kaiserinn of Melody!" the "Nightingale!" the

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

"Swan of Sound!" Then the shoe was returned to
Hemrich, who kissed it and pressed it to his velvet
blouse. "My brothers," he said, "this sacred by-my-heart-never-to-be-sufficiently-adored 
sandal, by
the beautiful priestess of the lyrical drama much
worn, shall for ever, a precious relic, in my Saxon
home be enshrined. Yes, in the name of our dear
fatherland, I for ever consecrate it to the recollection
of the divinity who has this night with her divine
art our ears enraptured."</p>

<p>Then a chair was placed on the table, and the captain 
of these silly fellows placed in it. Some one had
borrowed the hat of a Bersagliere from the landlord,
and it was forthwith placed on Von Weber's head.
On each side of him stood a student-artist with a
drawn sword. The rest joined hands, and danced
round the table, pipe in mouth, singing a doggerel
song:</p>

<p class="small">Is not this Firenze fair?<br/>

Ya, this is Firenze fair.<br/>

Is not this a fairy shoe?<br/>

Ya, bei himmel, that is true.<br/>

Whence arose this star divine,<br/>

That on F'renze fair doth shine,<br/>

Was't not from our glorious Rhine?<br/>

Ya! Fill high this cup with wine (<i>bis</i>).<br/>

Drei mal pledge the cup around;<br/>

Here no sober calf be found! &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>When these young men were perfectly hoarse and
exhausted with their enthusiasm, those who were not
entirely <i>hors de combat</i>, headed by Von Weber,
took their departure, singing en route, and ever and
anon dancing a quaint measure at the corners of
streets, and at length melted away into the two or

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

three not very cleanly or commodious lodgings which
had received the whole tobacco-reeking party on
their arrival from the Eternal City. The rest slept
where they fell, still grasping their pipes, as if they
had been swords or battle-axes used in some deadly
fight.</p>

<p>Whilst all this scene is being enacted, behold the
romantic Bianca Stellini prepares to go to bed! She
sits before a looking-glass in a spacious salon of the
hotel, pensively regarding her own lovely features.
Her long back hair is being combed and brushed by
a pretty attendant of some twenty-three or twenty-four 
summers, whose bright grey eyes, provoking
lips, and very <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose, form a portrait so fresh
and charming as to attract the eye of the beholder
ever and anon for a few brief moments even from
the transcendent charms and classical features of her
mistress.</p>

<p>"Lor, mum," said this young person, in answer
apparently to some remark of the Signora, "do you
think so? Well, I know I should never feel tired of
such admiration."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Susan," said the mysterious
daughter of the Boyard, the child of the Danube or
the Rhine, the Circassian or Georgian nightingale,
speaking remarkably good English; "I assure you,
Susan, I long for peace and quiet, for a little cottage
near the seaside in dear old England, and the society
only of my sweet little prattler there," and she pointed
towards a cot in which a child of some three or four
years of age could be discerned sleeping, "your own
faithful attendance, and the company of dear Violet

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

to help me to educate our babe. Thank Heaven! I
have already acquired nearly sufficient to suffice for
all our wants, and with one successful season in
London, I shall be able to retire, and for ever bid
adieu to the stage."</p>

<p>"Lor, mum!" rejoined Susan, a second time. "I
declare I shall be quite sorry when it is all over; for
it is so nice to have every one at your very feet, as it
were, and the respect with which I'm treated is quite
delightful, wherever we go. I'm sure, if I was only
to cut off a lock of your hair, or to match it and say
it was yours&mdash;which might be difficult seeing how fine
it is, but then who'd be the wiser?&mdash;I could make a
Mint of money, that I could. And as for presents,
I'm sure many would make fortunes in my place, and
do no harm neither. Whatever do you think happened 
this very night?" and Susan gave way to an
irrepressible fit of laughing.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," said her mistress, gravely.
"I hope you have done nothing very silly."</p>

<p>"Me silly, mum? No, it's the German students.
Such a set of madmen I never did see. A parcel of
great stupid donkeys, with their rubbish! I couldn't
help it, indeed! It's the first time I've done anything
of the kind, and I hope you won't be angry. A saint
couldn't have helped it."</p>

<p>"But tell me," said the Signora, for so we will
call her, "what is it that you have done? I hope
nothing very wrong, or foolish; nothing that will
compromise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mum! I am sure you needn't be afraid of me.
Look at the offers I have had made for a lock of your

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

hair, a bouquet you had worn in your bosom, an old
glove, or any such trifle; and I've never so much as
disobeyed you by giving a single thing, when I might
just as well have made a little fortune by a parcel of
withered flowers instead of throwing them away. I
could have robbed even the rag-bag to some purpose,
I can tell you. Only you told me not, and I'd as
leave have given away any of these ornaments as disobeyed 
your orders. But this time, it was something
of my own! and look what I've got for it." And
Susan displayed a piece of gold in a jubilant and
triumphant manner.</p>

<p>"What have you been about?" inquired La Stellini,
with a little more animation than usual.</p>

<p>"Figgury-vous, mum," replied the maid, "just
after you came in to-night, the interpreter addressed
me quite politely, and said that a young gentleman
was very anxious to speak with me, a Mr. Henry, he
said, a great artist from Rome. I thought it was
some one who knew us there, and so I said 'Wee,
avec playseer, mossoo.' Well, the young gentleman
came smiling and bowing, and spoke in German,
which is a language I never could abide. Quite a
beautiful young man he was, if it hadn't been for his
beard and his smoking, which smelt all the place.
Well, Mossoo Albert, that's the interpreter, explained
what he wanted, and whatever do you think it was,
mum? You'll never guess, no, not in a week of
Sundays, which to be sure are not much account
here."</p>

<p>"Really, Susan," said La Stellini, as we shall in
future call Blanche Aubrey, "I shall not trouble

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

myself much to guess. A flower, perhaps, or a bow
from my dress. I am getting quite accustomed to
this ridiculous homage."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, mum," was the answer. "You'll
never guess."</p>

<p>"A glove, perhaps?" said Blanche, languidly.</p>

<p>"No, an old shoe!" replied the waiting-woman.</p>

<p>"How absurd!" exclaimed Blanche. "But I trust
you did not give him anything of the kind. I shall
be exceedingly angry."</p>

<p>"Lor, mum!" said Susan, "you nearly twitched
the comb out of my hand. I declare you have made
me quite hurt you. I have given away nothing
belonging to you, and wouldn't do such a thing for
all the world. But as the young gentleman wanted
to buy an old shoe, I thought it very hard he
shouldn't have one, and I let him have one of mine&mdash;that's 
all."</p>

<p>In spite of some degree of vexation, La Stellini
could not help laughing at the ridiculous proceeding.</p>

<p>"If you'd seen him kiss it, and clasp it to his
bosom, and turn up his eyes like a dying duck in a
thunder-storm, you just would laugh, mum," said
Susan. "I declare my side aches that dreadful, that
I've been trying not to think of it for the last hour
and more. You know those old bronze slippers that
I brought from Paris last year. Well, it was one of
them. It <i>was</i> an old one, and no mistake; but he
said an old one, and so it was all right. And what
do you think the interpreter explained to me that he
told him to tell me he was going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed," said Blanche. "Perhaps

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

to put it under a glass case, the silly young
fellow?"</p>

<p>"To drink your health in it, along with a lot more
of them mad countrymen of his. 'Mong Dew!' said
I, 'hey teel posseeble?' 'Wee, mumselle,' said
Mossoo Albert, 'eels ong tray beong carparble.' "</p>

<p>"The nasty fellows!" said Blanche, who could not
help smiling; "and so you got a gold piece for
that act of deception? I hope you'll never do such a
thing again."</p>

<p>"I should think there was not such another donkey
in the world," replied Susan. "But if there is, I
hope he won't tempt me. I wouldn't mind taking
half the money for the odd old slipper, though it
is the best of the two. He said an old one, and an
old one he had; and what's more, if they're going to
drink out of it, it must be mended first. For there
was a hole in the sewing you might have put your
finger in."</p>

<p>"And they'll say the nasty thing was mine," said
La Signora. "Do you know I have a great mind to
be very cross with you. If it were not that you really
have a very small foot of your own, I don't think
I should look over it."</p>

<p>Susan put forth and gazed at her own foot with
great complacency. "That's what the gentleman
said. He said, 'Oh, the small, the fairy foot of the
commanding figure of that divine goddess,' or something 
like that. My size is fours, it's true enough;
but look what a mite I am compared with you."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't part with one of your gloves
in the same manner," said the lady, gravely. "My

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

foot is longer I dare say, and so may my hand be,
but you split all my old gloves, and I don't think you
could wear even my shoes very easily."</p>

<p>Poor Susan's hand <i>was</i> a little dumpy, and she
knew it, as well as the remarkable tininess of her
foot. The fact is she had worked more than she had
walked.</p>

<p>"I won't do anything of the kind again, mum, you
may depend upon me. But I couldn't help it this
time, as the idea was so funny, and I happened to
have those old slippers so handy. I should have left
them behind at the hotel, if I hadn't obliged the
young gentleman as I did."</p>

<p>"Well," said her mistress "it is a very foolish
affair after all, and I am heartily tired of this sort of
thing. There will be none of this nonsense in England, 
at any rate. But I dread going thither I own.
What if I should be recognised? I cannot be so very
much changed after all."</p>

<p>"Well, mum," said Susan, "you are not so much
changed from the time that you were married, except
in being stouter like, as you certainly are from that
time when&mdash;things didn't go right, you know. You're
not a bit like what you was four years ago. But, lor!
mum, what with the different way of doing your hair,
and the paint you're obliged to wear, and the difference 
in name, and your having been blind, and
dead, and all&mdash;and not being expected, that is, folks
never expecting to see you on the stage or anywhere
again for that matter, who ever is to find it out? Not
that I would go to any parties, or sing at concerts,
or anything of that kind. I shouldn't wonder if lots

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

were to say, 'Dear me! How like some one I have
known somewhere!' or 'Doesn't she put you in mind
of that Mrs. Aubrey?' I beg your pardon, mum, I
didn't mean to mention the name. It came out quite
unexpected like."</p>

<p>"But supposing," said the Signora, "that some
one in particular should see me&mdash;you know what I
mean. Do you pretend to say that <i>he</i> would not
know me?"</p>

<p>"There's no danger," replied Susan, "from all
that I hear; for no one has seen him these three
years and more." And she heaved a deep sigh. Had
she looked at her mistress, she would have seen a
strange and sudden shade, which darkened for a
moment her expressive face.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the lady aloud, but what she thought
was another matter, "there is no danger. I dare say
he has married again long ago. Another reason why
I must carefully guard my secret."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," answered Susan, "don't change
their names when they marry again, and master isn't
to be heard of anywhere. Besides, I know better
than that. It wouldn't happen&mdash;no, not if he were
to live a thousand years, poor gentleman! But it's
my belief he's gone home, ever so long ago."</p>

<p>"Do not say so, Susan," said the Signora. "I
tell you I feel certain that he is alive at this moment,
and God forbid that it should be otherwise. The
world is wide enough for us both. I should like to
be sure of it, without seeing him, and to aid him
anonymously if he is in need of it. This is one of
my reasons for going to England this year. I shall

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

then retire and live in seclusion, probably in Wales,
or it may be the South of France. But I shall
first see you married to that faithful fellow, Tops;
unless, indeed," she added, "you prefer one of your
German admirers."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Susan, "none of your foreigners for
me. An Englishman is quite good enough for that
matter. As for Mr. Tops, I shall see how he has
behaved himself. And if I did have a foreigner, it
needn't be a German artist, considering I might have
married a real Count and Chamberlain to the Pope
himself at Rome."</p>

<p>The Signora could not help laughing at this reminiscence. 
"What!" she said. "Poor Count Greggs
le Boshe, who used to show the English visitors the
'lions' of the Eternal City! Why, he was little better
than a 'laquais de place,' and sixty years old, if he
was a day. He always had a knife and fork and
spoon at the table d'h&ocirc;te of the English hotel, where
Lord and Lady Madeiraville stayed so long."</p>

<p>"Indeed, mum," said Susan, "he was quite a
gentleman, and would have made me his Countess, if
I'd have had him."</p>

<p>"Don't you know, child, that he was an Englishman 
after all, a bankrupt hair-dresser from the City-road?" 
asked her mistress.</p>

<p>"Well, if he was an Englishman born, he was
none the worse for that," said Susan; "and at any
rate he was a foreign Count, and spoke broken
English beautifully."</p>

<p>"He was an old rogue," observed the lady; "and
what is more, has a wife living to this day, who lets

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

lodgings at Margate, and there is a pretty story about
the manner in which he obtained his patent of nobility, 
such as it is. For the rest, he gained his
living as a kind of amateur 'cicerone.' Fancy a
nobleman who would pick up a scudo by showing the
Baths of Caracalla, or the Tomb of Cecilia Metella,
and hiring a carriage for any queer John Bull who
couldn't speak a word of Italian. Besides, he only
deceived thee, girl! They say he has also an Italian
wife and family&mdash;an artists' model, or something of
the kind."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, mum," says Susan, "it was all stories
and jealousy. One needn't believe half one hears in
England, and as for them foreign places, where there
are so many queer folks mooning about with nothing
to do, but to speak ill of everybody, what chance is
there of hearing as much truth as a flea could carry
in his eye without winking&mdash;I mean an English flea,
and not one of the monsters in this country."</p>

<p>"You forget," said her mistress, "that it was you
yourself told me all these things about the Count,
and added that he was a nasty old man; and that you
boxed his ears the day we all went to Tivoli, where
that handsome Signor Salvi, the innkeeper, was so
polite, and told Lord Madeiraville such scandalous
stories about the English ladies who went to his
hotel."</p>

<p>"Box his ears, indeed!" cried Mrs. Susan. "Of
course I did; and should have done it, too, if he'd
been a prince, let alone a Count and a Pope's what's-his-name, 
and a Sticherony and all, if he'd tried to
kiss me unbewares. But he apologised like a real

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

nobleman as he was, and said it was the manners of
his country, and the wine he'd been taking, and English 
roses and lilies which he wasn't used to, and he
wrote a lot of poetry in Italian&mdash;such lovely writing
it was, but for all that, I wouldn't have had him, if
he'd been fifty times a Count. It was only 'poor 
passy ler tom.' "</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said the Signora Bianca
"your French accent is something wonderful. Hush!
there's that dear child awake again!"</p>

<p>"Bless his little darling heart, so he is," quoth
Susan; "and it's no wonder neither. What with
fleas and musketeers, and the like, I wonder he isn't
eaten up alive, I do. I wonder what they'd do, if there
was no travellers, for I don't believe they'd touch a
native. If they do, it don't trouble the Italians much,
that's all."</p>

<p>Little Arthur, a sweet flaxen-haired child of some
three years and a half old, was duly taken out of his
cot, and kissed and hugged, and talked to as only
mothers and nurses know how. The child did not
in the least resemble his mother, which was so far
fortunate, that it stopped all remarks and inquiries of
an annoying character. No one would believe, much
less suspect, that he was the son of the Prima Donna
whose dark eyes and hair presented quite a contrast
to the little fellow's violet orbs and lint-white locks.
It was tacitly presumed and understood that the
great singer had adopted the infant of a "compatriote." 
At first she had repelled and combated
the idea; but at length fell into it as a kind of thing
that was thrust upon her, and not easily to be resisted. 

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

When she asserted that the little Arturo was
her own offspring every one smiled, and politely
withheld their assent or credence. Aubrey, on the
other hand, would have found some difficulty in
denying the paternity of the blue-eyed darling, of
whose very existence he was unconscious, even if
he had not ceased to be conscious of anything, save
in the spirit. Ah! who knows if or when an immortal 
unseen presence is near? Who can tell
whether as a boon or a punishment, our souls or
spirits may hover near those whom we have loved
and still love in this world? And yet more, in certain
conditions of mind or matter, does the anxious spirit
ever take a visible form or shape through purpose or
accident, or does the flesh ever <i>see</i> the spirit hovering
near by some abnormal condition unknown to the
reason and general experience of man? Where
have we read that strange story of one who, travelling 
on a lonely road in a gig, carrying with him
a heavy amount in notes and gold, suddenly became
aware without surprise, and, as if it were a matter of
course, that the phantasma of his dead brother was
familiarly sitting by his side? Behold! two cut-throat 
desperadoes leap from behind a hedge to attack
the solitary man as preconcerted, but quickly start
back on perceiving that there are <i>two</i> persons to
overcome, and leave their intended victim to pursue
his journey, which he does so soon as he has rounded
the first turning in the moonlit turnpike-road <i>alone!</i>
Are we doomed to the invisible companionship of the
dead? Do they watch us, or watch over us, protect
or persecute, pity or patronise our actions and remaining

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

lives? Do they sometimes wait for us, and
hover round us for a limited period or not? In the
intense solitude and silence of a desert island do the
invisible and voiceless things around sometimes
momentarily burst their spirit-bonds and flash into
form and shape, by the mere intensity of volition on
their own part, and become gifted with</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Airy tongues that syllable men's names;</p>

</div>

<p>or is it that we see and hear differently in a clearer
physical atmosphere, unclouded by mortal breath,
and unpolluted by mortal passions, undeafened by
the roar and din of the human crowd? Is it a
privilege of solitude, a charter of the wilderness, sometimes 
thus to hold strange commune with the invisible 
world?</p>

<p>That night, when Blanche lay with Arthur, who
had been disturbed in his sleep in his own little crib,
tenderly embraced in her arms, she had a strange
dream about Aubrey. She fancied that her love was
strong as ever, and that nothing on his part had
occurred to destroy it, only that he was removed out
of her sight, and that she could not imagine how or
why he was gone. Then she fancied little Arthur
took her by the hand, and led her through the streets
of London, saying, "Let us look for dear papa!"
They passed through squalid, busy thoroughfares,
but no one seemed to notice or even see them. Suddenly 
a tall female figure, clad in a white opera-cloak, 
came by, and throwing back the hood which
concealed her features, displayed the stern and
mournful face of Lady Courcy. "You are very

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

late!" she breathed into her ear, and passed on.
Then her father glided past, and frowned. "You
are late!" he shouted, and was lost in the crowd.
Then all the busy throng around, on every side, took
up the word and hissed, and groaned, and murmured,
and shouted the word, "Late! late! late!" Then
she ran panting and crying out this sad word,
"Late!" until she found herself kneeling by a pallet
in an agony of grief, sobbing over a prostrate form.
It was that of her husband. "Arthur! Arthur!" she
cried, "it is I, Blanche! Look up; do you not see
me, love?" Then he slowly turned his face round,
and behold! it was of marble, without eyeballs, like
that of a Pompeian statue which she had seen in the
museum at Naples. Then all was changed, and she
dreamt that she was lying by her husband's side,
and that he had been unfaithful to her, and the
thought was so terrible that she screamed out in her
sleep and awoke, and found that he was gone, for
ever gone! And with this she awoke, and all the
truth rushed over her mind, and she clasped the little
sleeping Arthur to her heart, and cried ever so
bitterly in the night, as if it had all happened yesterday, 
and not ever so long ago, before that darling
innocent was born.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">ROMAN CONQUESTS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The "Mio Bello," addressed to him by the lovely Elena Fabiani,
whispered of ecstatic passion to his soul all night; and the magic gleam
of her large dark eyes haunted him, together with the faint odours of
the crushed flowers of the Carnival; and all its wondrous pageantry of
sight waved round him, like a tapestry, in his dreams, and the music
of sweet voices rang in his ears, and he felt like a bemused Bottom,
after the blandishments of the Fairy Queen. But the next day he
awoke fortunately in Lent, and thought of an Italian mother-in-law,
and an Italian father-in-law in a shiny cloak, smoking a paper cigarette, 
and all the Italian brothers and sisters whom he would have to
maintain; and the fleas bit him vindictively into the full remembrance
of his Anglo-Saxon birth and skin; and he looked out of the window
and saw a procession of monks, and various unsavoury smells greeted
him in his early walk; and when he called and saw the Fabiani, in her
morning slovenliness surrounded by <i>toute la boutique</i>, his disenchantment 
was complete, and so our British Romeo bought a plentiful supply
of soap and a new tooth-brush at the English apothecary's in the Piazza
di Spagna, and left Rome, looking very much like Eustace Tomkinson
again.&mdash;<i>Recollections of the Eternal City</i>, vol. ii. p. 1.</p>

<p>WE must now take a hurried retrospective view of
the career of Blanche Aubrey, since she left her husband, 
and commenced the arduous study requisite to
fit herself for the career of an opera-singer at Rome.</p>

<p>Furnished by her mysterious protectress, who
bound her to inviolable secrecy as to their source,
with ample and varied letters of introduction at
Rome, Naples, and elsewhere, all relating to the
profession she had chosen, and with five hundred

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

pounds to draw on, she had commenced, as we have
seen, under the old ma&euml;stro, and received ample
assistance from the eccentric nobleman who had
been so struck with her grace and beauty during
the early part of her sojourn at Rome. To the
ma&euml;stro she had imparted the heads of her painful
story, that is, that she was separated from a faithless
husband, who was not even aware of her existence,
and who, in fact, believed that she was no more.
Under his advice, she assumed a foreign name, and
he took care to publish a romantic story of her supposed 
Moldavian, Wallachian, or Circassian origin,
knowing that the mystery would serve to enhance
her fame. Sometimes he varied the story, and thus,
as we have seen, a veil of doubt and obscurity was
flung over her origin and history, and even the very
race from which she was supposed to have sprung.
Her extraordinary acquirements as a linguist were of
great use in this respect. During her residence at
Rome she made but one confidante, and that, by
the advice of the ma&euml;stro, was her old friend, Lady
Madeiraville, a talkative, but kind-hearted personage, 
who could safely be intrusted with a secret
involving, as it did, a fiction and romance with the
entire comfort and success of one for whom she had
always entertained the warmest feelings of sympathy
and friendship. Of course, Lord Madeiraville was
included in this confidence; and the friendship and
patronage of this distinguished pair were of the
greatest service to her, not only during the winter
throughout which they resided at Rome, but subsequently 
through the period of her musical probation;

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

and when she made her debut at the "Tordinone,"
as the new prima donna who was to entrance the
world with a dramatic genius and finished vocalisation 
which bade fair to make her the first operatic
singer of her time. In spite of her dazzling beauty
and unprotected state, there was something in her
aspect and style, as well as conduct, which kept her
multitudinous admirers within bounds. She had
been singularly free from insult and importunity.
Once a royal personage persecuted her for a brief
time; and when his overtures became annoying, and
allowed of no mistake, she granted him an interview
alone, for the presence of the little Arthur in his
cradle could hardly be reckoned as anything. We
don't know all that transpired at that interview, but
we can aver that the monarch shortly afterwards sent
a present of a diamond ornament to the child, and
that La Signora was introduced at Court under circumstances 
of marked distinction, and that particular
attention was paid to her by the august ladies of that
sovereign's family.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that Blanche knew pretty well
the chivalrous character of the potentate to whom she
accorded an interview which might otherwise have
proved fraught with peril, if not to her virtue, to her
good name. There is something terrible in the earnestness 
of offended genius and beauty, where there is no
weakness felt, no <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>, no possibility of
surrender; not even the alarm of virtue, but the declaration 
of regal Purity that the very thought of
familiarity, the hope of conquest, is an insult to be
pardoned to a full repentance alone. Never in her

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

most striking histrionic pose, never in her most triumphant 
roulade of song, had Blanche appeared to
such advantage as on this occasion; and when the
royal libertine apologised, and in trembling accents
asked if he might be permitted a place in her friendship 
and esteem, it was a man who asked pardon of
a queen. From that moment, somehow or other, it
became rumoured that the beautiful songstress was
utterly unapproachable by the <i>rou&eacute;</i> gang from highest
to lowest. Then came offers of marriage innumerable. 
Half a dozen Italian princes looked upon
her as a splendid source of income, and laid their
titles, sans fortune, at her feet. Sir Bampton Nogs,
our valuable ambassador at Naples, a little bald
fellow with expediency and compromise written on his
otherwise meaningless face, implored her to embellish 
his third era of widowhood, and restore respectability 
to his diplomatic palazzo. Austrian counts
and barons offered her their manly "appui" in the
matrimonial line, without proposing to deprive the
stage of its brightest ornament. A Yankee who had
"struck ile" asked her to make her home in the land
of the setting sun, and grew somewhat abusive
and personal at her refusal to share his dollars and
partake of the pumpkin-pie of freedom under the
protecting shadow of the American flag. To be rejected 
by a mere cuss of a "singing-girl," he felt
as a personal affront from the Old World offered
to him, Hon. Buffalo Humpville Slockdologer, as
a representative of the New, in the face of the
almighty creation; and he immediately penned an
alarming article in the "New York Times," recommending 

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

instant hostilities with Europe without a
declaration of war, which was hereafter destined to
be known as the "great Slockdologer doctrine of
conquest." Nor was France unrepresented in the
competition. There was a short, podgy, and very
unpleasant man of thirty, who might have walked
out of a Regent-street cartoon of "Punch," with
hair like the bristles of an old blacking-brush, who
stripped himself to the waist when he took his fencing
lessons, and displayed a chest like a door-mat, who
had fought several duels, and who was an Anglophobist 
of the fiercest description&mdash;this valorous personage 
fell into a perfectly disinterested fever of
adoration and frenzy of passion for our heroine. We
will do him the justice to say that he had not a
scintilla of sordid calculation beyond a game of dominoes 
in his whole composition, and he loved as a
haughty chimpanzee might be supposed to regard the
object of his affections with a tropical sentiment and
jealousy poivr&eacute;e &agrave; l'Indienne. When M. Emile de la
Grenouille-Jardini&egrave;re heard that the Signora was ill
of fever, he watched the house for days; when she
was recovering, he spent, for him, a reckless amount
in purchasing the most expensive flowers with which
he waylaid Susan and the child. All this was touching 
and tender enough. But a dangerous and tragic
phase succeeded. He got introduced to her receptions
by a musical friend, and insulted a young Italian,
the Marchese Picchino, in the grossest manner, and
ran him through the body in a hostile encounter,
in a truly ferocious style. Poor little harmless Picchino, 
who only just managed to survive his wound,

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

was one of those Italian nobles who, having been
frivolously reared without any worthy object in life,
was full of small devices and tricks, such as grown-up
children amuse themselves with at a Roman soir&eacute;e;
and it was his ardour and familiarity in showing the
Signora some slight effort of legerdemain which
aroused the demoniac wrath of the inflammable son
of Gaul, who called him cochon and Savoyard, and
brutally spat in his face, so soon as they had left
the hotel-door together. M. Emile thought he had
done something to recommend him to the Signora's
favour, but he soon found out his mistake. He
threatened to shoot himself, and she sent for him as
she did for the royal personage, and read him a lesson,
which rather altered that fiery little disagreeable
Frenchman's views.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, soon after to a military friend,
Le Capitaine Achille Billard, of the Fourteenth Regiment 
of the Line. "I am not poltron, I; but that
woman it is an angel I tell you. She has made me
shed tears like a veal. She has spoken to me of my
mother, see you? She has recalled me a remembrance 
so soft. I had a mother so good, so tender,
who loved me. Eh, well! What will you? I fight
me no more in duel. I will not more cut the throats of
the English. Henceforth, they are my brothers, for
is she not my sister? Angel of Heaven! she will
pray for me. Hold, my dear Billard. This poor
Picchino! he has also a mother of whom I have
withered the soul. I go to place myself at knees
at her feet, to say 'Pardon, madame, pardon to this
crime terrible, to this penitence enormous&mdash;pardon to

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

him who comes from assassinating your son.' Ah!
but he will re-establish himself, I swear it. The
medecin me it told. God be praised, he will live.
And you, my dear Achille, who go in Africa to
fight you against the enemies of France, you will
spare to the mothers affectionate their sons when you
shall be victor, is it not? for so she wills it&mdash;she of
whom I am so perditiously (<i>&eacute;perdument</i>) amorous,
of whom I shall guard the remembrance even to the
tomb," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Decidedly he is mad, this poor little Emile,"
said Le Capitaine Billard to his brother officers that
evening. "What shall we do with him? He will
make himself monk. He is capable to become devout
enough to make himself voyage as missionary, to be
eaten by cannibals in praying them to become good
Catholics, whilst he would wish to be not so tough,
for their sakes. The amiable farceur&mdash;it was a good
boy, and he fenced well, my word of honour. But
now, sacred name of onion soup! it is finished of
him. Go, my children, and above all do not become
fatally amorous of an empress, or anything of that
chic, when there are so many good little women in
the world."</p>

<p>There was one thing which really did alarm Blanche
greatly, and made her very anxious to quit Rome.
This was the persecution of a sallow and cadaverous
priest, who followed her in her walks, whenever he
had an opportunity, and uttered the most frightful
maledictions and imprecations, because she would
not pause and listen to his atrocious suit. This sort
of thing was not quite so easily put down as in England. 

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

Indeed, the friends whom Blanche consulted
advised her to take no notice, especially as she was
not a Roman Catholic. This repulsive being haunted
the Pincian Hill and Villa Borghese Gardens; and if
any one else came within hearing, with the exception
of Susan, and Blanche's young English friend, he
would change his mingled blasphemies, maledictions,
and entreaties, for prayers and beatific expressions.
This holy man was difficult to deal with. It would
not have done to horsewhip him, and he defied the
law.</p>

<p>Even M. Emile would have been puzzled what
to do with such a rival. His sainted mother would
never have counselled him to lift his hand against
the Church. Altogether there was something so
unholy and "uncanny" in the proceedings of this
terrible priest, who would have done credit to a
romance of Mrs. Radcliffe, and who did not hesitate
to threaten the object of his attentions with physical
assassination as well as spiritual torments, if she refused
to listen to his plaint. As for Susan, she came home
one day and had a fit of hysterics, about which there
was no mistake. So the whole party were glad to
quit Rome, and leave the priest to the enjoyment of
his own society on the Pincian, until a Swiss governess
was unfortunate enough to come within the radius of
the tentacles of this human Pieuvre, and her mysterious 
and terrible death thrilled through the bosoms
of all the <i>forestieri</i> then resident at or visiting Rome.
Pauvre Mademoiselle Louise! We think we see thee
now in thy dark blue dress, and "chapeau de paille,"
guarding thy convoy of small children of the aldermanic 

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

famille Wiggins, staying in the Via Ripetta at
that time. We see that gay young Englishman leap
from his horse, and run after thee with thy parasol
left (was it accidentally?) on the seat where thou
hadst been sitting thinking possibly of the Lake of
Geneva, and thy cousin Victor, Chasseur d'Afrique,
at that moment bivouacked near Constantine. We
see him return the parasol, and then grasp an armful
of roses which he had feloniously climbed up the
lattice-work of yon Palazzetto to obtain. Then dost
thou relent and smile, and then dost thou engage with
him in animated conversation. The next day and
the next, at that hour, I see you both, and also the
children of the famille Wiggins. But Satan has
entered your eight-day paradise in the likeness of that
horrid priest. He follows and anathematises you.
What a singularly unpleasant interruption! In vain
does the young Englishman shake his fist, and tell
that minister of religion to go and count his beads
elsewhere. The charm is broken. The timid Louise
saves herself, as the phrase runs. The priest remains
master of the field. The next day Louise does not
come; nor the next after that. The young Englishman 
goes to Naples for a month, and on his return
learns that she has been foully murdered. One evening 
she went out alone, and was found strangled on
the banks of the river. The famille Wiggins does all
that it can, which is not much, to discover the assassin, 
and then leaves Rome, scarcely to regain its
equanimity east of Clapham Park. The young Englishman 
sees the priest no more in the Borghese
Gardens. The boa-constrictor hides himself under the

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

sacred vestments of his order. The Englishman does
not know his name. He tells his story at the sham
British Consulate, and is recommended "silence."
He tells it elsewhere, and is advised to quit Rome.
He is very indignant, and the next night is stabbed
from behind as he is descending the Piazza di Spagna
through the entire cover and leaves of a Russia leather 
pocket-book, which was in his breast-pocket over
his heart, and a note of the circumstance being thus
made on every page of his diary, he determines to
take the hint and the diligence together, and bid
farewell to the Eternal City for a time.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">SOME UNPLEASANT TRUTHS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">To see England as it really is, one must go to a distance, and look
through another atmosphere. There is too much noise of traffic and
self-laudation there, and too much moral and physical fog. Besides,
if you stand still to philosophise in so crowded a country, you will very
likely get tripped up, or knocked down.&mdash;<i>Letters from the Acropolis</i>.</p>

<p>THERE is slavery and slavery in this world, tyranny
and tyranny, injustice and injustice, hypocrisy and
hypocrisy. The conduct of the priest, described in
our last chapter, was very bad, and the system which
protected him worse; as the whole is greater than a
part. But, let us think a little. Have we nothing
to condemn here? There is the Reverend Jabez
Howlingcad, say of the pleasant suburb, where the
famille Wiggins deems itself at length safe and protected 
from harm. Of what depravity has he not
been guilty. Behold! At length he is found out.
Oh, the hideous wolf! Are not the hounds of justice 
on his track? They have caught him, and he is
merely out on bail. But hear his witnesses to character, 
observe the impediments which legal cunning
places in the road, to trip up that blind, old, besotted

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

British Themis of ours. Here is a witness in straitened 
circumstances bribed not to appear in court.
There are a brace of friendless servant-girls painted
as depraved monsters seeking the ruin of a godly man.
One of these wretches was not even born in wedlock,
and the other once stole a cake when she was four
years old. Can a jury of church-going cheesemongers
convict on such evidence as this? The Reverend
Jabez Howlingcad is acquitted amid the cheers of a
full court, and his victims are prosecuted, and sent to a
Penitentiary for five years. The congregation of the
Reverend Jabez present him with a silver tea-service
and a new Bible, and he becomes more popular than
ever, as a persecuted man. They would have done it,
if he had been proved guilty of sitting in the vestry
upon the face of a new-born babe. Hypocrisy thick,
slab, and unctuous, and legal fiction, cunningly made
use of, carry all before them in England. Surely,
we are free to pretend as much as we like, and to
defend iniquity, so long as our money lasts. Else
what would be the use of liberty, money, and the law?
It would not do to horsewhip a priest in Rome.
No! But can you even threaten with impunity to
chastise an attorney who has tampered with your wife
and robbed you (with due legal precautions) in
England? Certainly not. There, the Pope and
Superstition reign. Here, Mammon and Hypocrisy
are supreme. There, a confessor purrs like a tame
tom-cat about your house. Here, a scaly solicitor
lubricates you with his saliva, and swallows you,
land, houses, hereditaments, personal property, and
all, as his legitimate prey. We mentioned just now

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

the "Pieuvre" made famous by the genius of Victor
Hugo. Have we not here the great inky cuttle-fish
of the law? What difference is there in the result,
whether your daughter is seduced by her confessor, or
whether ruin and misery, entailed by systematic fraud
and villainy, drive her to something worse than death?
Where are flesh and blood so cheap as in England?
Where is oppression so morally ramified, coercion
spread so net-like over a land? "What!" cries an
optimist, "do you dare to say this of free England?"
"Free!" to do what? To express opinions, and act
upon them? Well, scarcely, in a state of society in
which Sydney Smith declared that no one can afford
an independent opinion who has not 1000<i>l</i>. a-year.
Not free to tell the truth?&mdash;yes, a little somewhat,
if you can be content without disciples or listeners;
but not free to wear rags and beg. Ask that policeman! 
Free, then, in Heaven's name, to do what?
The strong to perpetuate abuses, and the weak to
starve and die, though not to commit suicide, if
arrested in the act. You must not, freeman as you
are, presume to cut your own throat clumsily, or it
will be sewn up at the expense of the parish, and you
will be condemned to hear a sermon without sympathy 
on the enormity of your crime, and be remanded
to die properly of starvation, which a cynical coroner,
with blasphemy more awful than your fate, calls the
"Visitation of God." Strike off the manacles from
yon cowering slave! Has he not landed at Dover,
under our immortal Shakespeare's Cliff? Eh!
what? That black vagrant convicted of destitution?
Put him instantly in gaol! "Please, sir," said an

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

emaciated lad, in our hearing, the other day, to a
"worthy magistrate," before whom he was brought
previous to emancipation, for the second time, after
receiving "a month" for begging&mdash;"please, sir,
what am I to do?" The lad was incapable of work&mdash;he 
was too weak, he was in rags, penniless, and
ill. Ahem! The question was a puzzler. What
could he do, save beg again, and get another month?
"It is a pity," privately observed to us afterwards
our stipendiary friend on the bench, "that the Government 
does not avail itself of this raw material of
beggary and starvation, to provide the nation with
sailors." "Yes," we replied, "training ships would
certainly not cost much more than the costly machinery 
of your office, which barely serves to keep
down the predatory classes to a certain level, but
may not suffice always to do even that. But the
fact is, that the ship of the State has grounded on
her beef-bones of waste and extravagance, and cannot
be got off without a 'strong pull, and a long pull,
and a pull altogether.' " We don't think he quite
understood the meaning of our figure. There is a
sad lack of common sense as well as humanity in this
free and commercial country.</p>

<p>For us, we are content if these pages cause one
man who has the power and will to work for the
national and universal good, to pause and think,
whether this great country, foremost in the van of
civilisation and of science, this mighty atelier of rags,
and cotton, and linen, and coal, and iron, this laboratory 
of adulteration, this populous school of cant,
this mart of imposture and commerce, of knavery and

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

trade, this attorney-ridden community, this home of
smug and satisfied corruption, this land of lordly
palaces and ghastly crowded tenements, of want and
crime, of churches, cathedrals, and printing-offices, of
schools, and workhouses, and gaols, model gaols, and
early graves&mdash;whether, in short, this Great Britain
of the nineteenth century is rendering a fitting account 
of its national stewardship to Heaven; whether
it is performing its vast mission worthily; whether
it invites retribution, or is fitting to be saved! We
know by whom and what we shall be condemned for
that which we have written throughout this book.
It is "morbid," it is "exaggerated;" "the writer is
suffering from indigestion, disappointment, bile;" he
is "a turgid declaimer," an "ill-conditioned enthusiast 
at the least." Yet, is it not true, O Heaven!
And being true, shall it not be said? Any writer is
allowed to describe it retail, by instalments as it were.
One may paint a number of persons consisting of
the 'unconvicted felons' of Society, and approach,
as nearly as the genius of the author allows him, the
terrible reality of the newspaper, which we read
weekly or daily. A depraved parson, a villainous
lawyer, a profligate nobleman, a dishonest merchant
or clerk, a doctor who poisons his patients, nay, his
wife and father, for that matter, are stock characters,
merely admitting of variation in the portraiture of
modern English life. Only one must not say, "This is
English Society," and, above all, "This is England."
It is nothing to speak of a seducer who battens on
virtue, or of a rou&eacute; who withers on vice, or even of a
score of them if you please. Only do not attempt to

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

point a legislative moral, whilst you spice your social
narrative with such characters. Do not say, "Such
we, or you, are, noble Britons, glorious people, chosen
children of commerce,</p>

<p class="small">Nation of glib hypocrites<br/>

Eating rottenness like mites,"</p>

<p>unless you would be figuratively stoned. Nor do we
who write this utterly despair of amendment and regeneration. 
Only it is useless to attempt to patch
the body-politic. Neither police nor punishment will
put down the "social evil;" they cannot even anticipate 
the garotter's clutch. There are thousands of
honest persons in all classes, mute mourners over the
decadence of England&mdash;thousands who deplore a state
of things which renders it difficult for honesty to live,
thus adding unwilling neophytes to the unpublished
calendar of corruption and crime. The chief need is
a MAN, a single uncorrupted and incorruptible statesman, 
whose views are sufficiently sound and broad,
and whose brain does not run to seed in empty words
alone. Not a reformer sprung from abuses, to whose
talent the upholders of the system have only adroitly
to adjust the exact reward, so that the means of
bribery are not wasted in vain. Not a drab demagogue,
not a crotchet-mongering fanatic of decline. Better
the Dantons and Robespierres of Revolution than
these; for out of Revolution a nation may rise again,
but out of the fustian cowardice of compromise and
connivance, the insincere and many-sided bargain-driving 
"patriotism" of the day, there is no new life
to be had. Better the blighted topmost branches of
the aristocratical tree, whence some green leaves still

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

put forth in semblance of delusive hope, than the
rank weeds and undergrowth which rear their base
heads from the polluted soil made rich with the
sweat of over-taxed and over-worked labour, and the
artificial manure ground by ten thousand whirring
mills out of starved mechanics' and children's bones.
Faugh! merchant-princes, indeed! ever striving in
vain to make gentlemen out of their sons. When
trade and manufacture have reached that point, that
a self-made bankrupt merchant's bond is no better
than his word, a prince of such creation is the most
sordid of imaginable tyrants, as Mammon was the
least elevated of the spirits in the Pandemonium of
the poet's dream. A merchant prince's son! say
rather a born black-leg, who fails only from want of
wit to compete with the professional scoundrels of the
Turf:</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE
THE PRESS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>If Heaven foredoom that in the martial field<br/>

The flashing sabre's hilt I ne'er may press,<br/>

In ink and gall be steeped the arm I wield,<br/>

Not thus, I trust, to serve mankind the less.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Translation from Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>WHO was Mr. Edgar Leslie, at present staying in
Florence, where he is busy enough, at least in appearance, 
and what may his occupation be? And
how came Miss Violet Grimshaw to be companion to
the Signora Bianca Stellini? From the manner in
which these young persons are conversing in a salon
of the Signora's apartments, we should imagine that
they will not object to being mentioned together, and
their position, prospects, &amp;c., discussed and ventilated
in the same chapter of this history.</p>

<p>We have seen Mr. Leslie before. He has changed
his name, but without any formal announcement.
He has made great progress on the Press. He holds
rank in the great army of the Fourth Estate. He is
not a general, nor even a colonel, but he may fairly

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

be considered to have won a field-officer's rank. He
has described battles, that young man, which is as
much as fighting them, and sometimes more. He is
own correspondent of a daily London paper. He has
even now come on a special mission to Italy; and
fortune, wielding the interests of the journal with
which he is connected, has detained him at Florence,
that is all. It is not his Capua. There is for him a
great attraction there, it is true; but he would leave
at an hour's, nay, a quarter of an hour's notice, were
it his duty to do so, without wishing any one good-bye. 
He keeps all his bills paid to the last possible
instant ready to start. He has his linen washed by
instalments, in case of sudden departure. He has
left shirts and other articles of under-clothing all over
the Continent. His name has become celebrated
throughout Europe and America. When he returns
to London, at least one hundred gentlemen, foremost
in the ranks of information and knowledge, will invite
him to a congratulatory banquet. Edgar Leslie, as
we shall always call him in future, got early into the
literary and journalistic grooves, which Aubrey was
unable to accomplish. Leslie commenced young, was
duly apprenticed to the art, learnt short-hand, which
is to journalism what a knowledge of book-keeping
by double entry is to a mercantile clerk: he began
at the beginning and worked steadily up. He accommodated 
himself to the market, and wrote for a
long time only to demand; consequently, after a due
period of probation, anything which he may write
will command a ready sale. Some day or other,
perhaps, he will publish an ambitious work; will enter

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

the lists as an original writer; a novelist, historian,
dramatist, or even poet&mdash;who knows? Even should
he fail in reality, his productions will not fall dead&mdash;they 
will command attention, and be believed in,
until they are found out. We do not yet know
whether he has genius, or is possessed even of a
high order of talent. But he is a very clever fellow,
on the high road to success. He is considered an
authority upon most things&mdash;poetry, painting, the
drama, the arts and sciences, moral, ethical, religious
and political matters. Doubtless, he does know a great
deal. But the craft of journalism is, while saying
what you do know about a thing, neatly to avoid confessing 
or showing what you do not know. If you
don't know exactly where Trebizonde is, you needn't
say so; if you don't remember its name, you call it an
Eastern mart. If you forget, or never knew a certain
authority, you write, if you would quote a saying which
you do know, "A celebrated writer has said," &amp;c.
If, on the other hand, you can call to mind the author,
but cannot correctly quote the saying, you write,
"Every one is familiar with the aphorism of Grotius,
or the observation of Seneca," just indicating or
hinting at whatever it may chance to be. Then, what
opportunities you have of displaying your knowledge?
You can work the exact distance of the Georgium
Sidus, if you happen to know it, into an article on
street-begging, the Reform Bill, or soldiers' wives.
You may spin a yarn upon almost any topic, and
connect it, in a wonderful manner, with the subject
you have in hand in the closing sentence of your
leading article. You can turn to an encyclop&aelig;dia,

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

a gazetteer, a Lempri&egrave;re, or your own note-book, and
illustrate a subject in the most elaborate style. There
is no one to check this natural flux of information.
What a marvel of erudition a man is considered who
pours forth a perfect cataract of such knowledge in
leaded type down a column of a daily paper upon a
topic of the day! How few think of the sources of
the supply. But the foreign correspondent and
"commissioner" must draw largely upon his own
actual resources and intelligence. True, he cannot
easily be contradicted; and if he is, it is generally
when the interest of the subject has died away, and
nobody cares whether he was right or wrong. Still
the republic of letters is the greatest and most powerful 
in the world, and journalism is the chief human
solace, instruction, ay, and hope, of mankind. We
have indulged in a smile at the cataract of pseudo-learning, 
the manufactured torrent of words. Hold!
let us bow in wonder before the mighty roar of the
steam-press, whose combined engines might drown
the thunder of Niagara itself. Look! where in
mystery and in darkness ten thousand flame-eyed
genii work! Listen to the whirring of their wings,
the snorting of their nostrils, the hiss of their fiery
breath. Behold! how in a night the multitudinous
thoughts of men are gathered and sown in marvellous
order, and bound in iron frames, and in the dawn of
the morrow the white sheets blossom covered with
the magic of printed words, and are spread broadcast 
thick as snow-flakes, or the myriad leaves of
Nature's autumnal diary tempest-blown over the land.
Yet after all these are no great immortals, no Titanic

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

flame-breathing spirits, no "lubber fiends," who are
busy in this wondrous task; it is the growth and
spread of daily human intelligence collected, organised,
uttered, and sent forth by human means. It is only
the newspaper and periodical press of civilised humanity 
worked by the perseverance of mortal energies,
bending and using to its purposes the material
agencies of fire, water, earth, and air&mdash;spelling industriously

achieve new triumphs and outmarvel the Present and

<p>Surely much of this intelligence might have kept
a week without injury to the public or private
interests of the community! We must take the evil
with the good, the sham with the real, the empty
with the solid, the loss with the gain, assured that
there <i>is</i> gain and progress, enlightenment and improvement, 
additional freedom of thought and action,
through the Press. Stop! thou blue-aproned fiend,
busy torturing those meek-eyed baby beeves in that
hideous, revolting way&mdash;thou greasy cattle-market
Caligula! thou infernal inquisitor of the shambles.
Stop! Hold thy abhorred hands, which would crimson
Bethesda itself. Take off those red gloves, we say,
which look as if thou hadst purchased them for the
slaughter of innocence from a murderess in a fancy
bazaar of Pandemonium itself. Nay, thou hast
neither ruth, nor comprehension of mercy in thy suety
soul. But we read our newspaper, and we will eat
no more white veal. Arrest yon executioner's arm!
Legally, that patriot-martyr deserves death. In the
eyes of God and humanity, and State-wisdom, no!
He shall not die. A hundred pens are busy writing
his reprieve in the Press. The minister <i>dares</i> not
sign that death-warrant. He has glanced over the
morning journals, and sees that it cannot be. There
is a copy of a newspaper blotted with tears on the
breakfast-table of a palace. Were that life taken,
hundreds and perhaps thousands of deaths would
follow. The corpse of Emmett still bleeds. Years

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

ago, we ourselves aided to start a newspaper agitation,
which saved a hero from a felon's death. He lived
to clasp us to his heart, and has lived to win name
and fame, the meed of valour, and the admiration of
mankind. In the mean time, a grisly troop of abuses
have gone to their graves sentenced and executed by
the Press. The hand of the Press shall yet burn the
scourge which brands with infamy and dishonour the
soldier's back, and remove the foul stain of indecency
from the barrack-room, where the wife of his scarred
bosom sleeps. The Press will be champion and
advocate still of starved needlewomen, and unwilling
Magdalens hounded on by necessity to shame; of
the overworked and ill-paid mechanic; of virtuous
Sabbath recreation for the poor; of the ragged
school child's summer draught of fresh air; of the
aged and infirm pauper, and the street pariah, who
might be apprenticed to a saving and prudent
State. The economies of modern State-craft are the
dry crusts stolen from the cellars and garrets of the
poor, and sold to the rag-picking fiend, that the
rich may be more rich. The withering sarcasm and
invective of the Press shall expose this heartless and
hollow parsimony, and inaugurate a better state of
things. Yonder minister makes a false statement in
the Senate. Straightway fifty burning articles arraign
him before the country, and he is driven out of office
by the force of public contempt. The Press is the
guardian of our liberties, the avant-garde that apprises 
us of danger, the beacon-light and look-out,
the averter and rebuker, the warder and warner
against evil in whatsoever shape. The Press will

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

work for better homes and higher rewards for humble
industry; for the honest and righteous appropriation
of charities and beneficent trusts; for the unmasking
and unveiling of hypocrisies, and the spread of education 
and Christian toleration, and sympathy over the
land. And, oh! if it would raise once again the
banner of St. George against the fell scaly dragon of
legal iniquity that annually devours the hearts and
lives and substance of so many; the pestilential brood
of Chancery and attorneydom, the venomous wriggling 
monster of the law, and all those haunts and
dens of mischief including Lincoln's Inn, and Temple,
Gray's Inn, and substantial brick-house with brass
knocker, in the country town, United Law and Law
Clerks' Institutions and all, and give us in their place
a code, and not a devil's maze, justice, and not an
atrocious farce, the open, fair, and high-minded Advocate, 
depending for practice on his successful intelligence, 
unblemished integrity, and good fame, and
not the corrupt mystery and bonded brotherhood
of fraud, artifice, contradiction, robbery, and crime,
which now makes the "law" a stinking byword in
the apprehension of all honest men, then what a debt
of gratitude would not England owe to her enlightened
Fourth Estate, what blessing could reward the boon
conferred on Britain by an independent and enlightened 
Press?</p>

<p>In point of rewards and emoluments, with rare
exceptions, the newspaper Press in this country does
not hold out temptations to the aspirant of a particularly 
solid or seducing kind. On the contrary, its
pay is limited, and its honest patronage small. Nor

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

is its anonymity very captivating to an ambitious
mind. But, on the other hand, what conscious power,
what glorious self-approval to lead, and mould, to
improve and reprove, to influence and raise our fellow-men! 
What charm in the hidden hand of the leader
writer&mdash;what delight in the majesty and influence of
the editorial chair! What heart-felt gratification in
knocking down the tottering edifice of some wretched
abuse! What soul-felt pleasure in strewing the path
of duty and heroism with flowers, and in shaking a
tyrant's throne.* Edgar Leslie had thought out

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

this inspiring theme, this solace of midnight toil.
In early youth he had wished to be a soldier&mdash;he now
preferred the intellectual ranks, to be a moral engineer
of Progress, a mental pioneer of the army of freedom
and thought. Long since he had addressed himself
in the spirit, if not the words, of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier,
which we have prefixed to this chapter.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*This, like the rest of the book, was written some five years ago,
and the author has not thought fit to change the date, or bring his
story down to a later period. But never in the history of the newspaper 
world, since Nathaniel Butter published the first English journal,
the "Weekely Newes," on the 23rd of May, 1622, never since old
John Walter, in 1788, issued his reasons for calling his journal the
"Times," in that wonderful address of his, down to the present era
of the Press, was such an arena opened out to journalism as there
is now. At this juncture, the highest efforts, the noblest aims and
endeavours of the Press, are claimed and called for, not by England
alone, but by civilised humanity. Scores of daring correspondents
have accompanied the French and Prussian armies in the field during
the late portentous struggle, and the result of their perils and labours
has been such a word-photograph of horror and suffering as the
thoughtful, the educated and intellectual, the good, the gentle, and the
humane of mankind have never before seen. The war correspondents
of 1870-1 have not exaggerated&mdash;for they could not&mdash;the wickedness
and wantonness, the "abomination of desolation," the cruel butchery,
the pathetic sorrow, the horrifying and touching incidents of the late
rapid and sanguinary campaign in the neighbouring land of France.
Amid the painting of these scenes of carnage, words of solemn warning
have been uttered sometimes involuntarily, and sometimes with deep
meaning, and deliberate intent. These warnings have counselled preparation 
to England. They have solemnly abjured her to arm, not for
aggressive purposes, that it is needless to say, but to protect her own
soil from a visitation such as France has experienced. No Chorus of
a Greek Play uttering a foregone conclusion in prophetic phrase could
more clearly designate the awful catastrophe that may await this
country, if she continues to grudge the requisite insurance against
fire and sword. Therefore, let no one mistake the meaning of that
which we are about to say. Let England be armed, and her moral
backed by her physical influence; and then, let her Press join with
that of other countries in the highest and holiest mission of enlightened
humanity. Let its text be the Curse of Cain, and let it strive calmly
and philosophically and with dignity, yet ardently and eloquently, to
write down the practice of wholesale homicide and murder, in which
despots and statesmen, and venerable monarchs, invoking the name of
the Most High, indubitably triumph and delight. If the monarchs will
not listen to reason and true religion, the peoples surely will, and their
voice must in the end prevail.</p>

<p>Neither the people of Germany, nor the people of France desired
this sanguinary war, whose daily chronicles curdle the blood with
horror. Yet how little of the dread immensity of carnage can each
single correspondent relate. A human marmalade of flesh and entrails,
with shattered bones sticking out like cherry-stalks, and mingled and
mashed with parti-coloured rags of uniform, and this ghastly sight
extending for miles, and seen for hour after hour, is an epitome of a
single description of the route around Sedan. Whether it was king or
emperor, craft of Bismarck, or folly of Ollivier, that prepared this evil
sacrifice, it was not the peoples' work! In France, or rather Paris, a few
abandoned wretches hounded on Zouaves and Turcos to the work of
death. In Germany, the passions of the masses have been aroused
during the struggle. But the rulers decreed the war. And now, what
do we behold? A scene to make the angels weep. These things
should not be; and to prevent their future recurrence, must journalism
labour, early and late, in the task of enlightenment and the instruction
of mankind. But first the Press of England should teach the English
nation the utter futility of moral opinion and of the wish to avoid war,
unless prepared to command peace and dictate humanity to the world.
Alas! Britannia is now unhappily only represented by her comic journals 
in her right guise, leaning on a cannon, with drawn sword in
hand, and the martial frown of undaunted resolution to do and dare all
rather than yield. For we are now yielding all to the base expediency
of compromise, which will rather hurry on than defer the day of final
sanguinary destruction and doom. <i>Note</i>, April, 1871.]</p>

<p>Young Leslie could never have been a mere military
machine, even in his country's service, and at the
bidding of her government. He must have known
that the cause was good and the war just, in which

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

he engaged. Otherwise he would have been wretched,
and might have appeared even a coward. Yet in
the performance of his duty of chronicler of campaigns 
and correspondent at the seat of war, he
had more than once merited a medal for valour and
humane daring in the field.</p>

<p>Such was Leslie&mdash;such the career he had chosen&mdash;such 
are many of the men who form at this moment
the Advanced Guard of British journalism. Intelligent, 
devoted, ready, brave, and accomplished,
graphic in his narrative, fertile in the imagery of the
pen, modest and self-reliant, conscientious, honourable 
and upright, what better and nobler mission
could he have chosen, what happier and more felicitous 
profession!</p>

<p>Even the correspondent of a daily paper has time&mdash;at 
least once in his life&mdash;to fall in love. Besides,
it is a thing so soon done. Edgar Leslie, however,
was not the man, had his leisure been pastoral, to
fall in love more than once in his life. Let us hope,
then, that his chance was good. It was certainly
not prudent in a worldly sense; for the young lady
had no money, and no expectations whatsoever. A
newspaper writer fortunately is seldom a man of
luxurious views and habits. He can, and does,
marry on three or four hundred pounds a-year.
Even if he goes to dinners and parties, he is not
expected to give many in return. He has great
opportunities of affording his wife some luxuries
which much wealthier ladies cannot or do not attain.
He has tickets and admissions for operas and theatres,
balls and entertainments of every kind. He is generally 

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

a welcome guest. He mixes in the most intellectual 
and delightful society, that is, if he chooses
to go into Society at all.</p>

<p>In placing his children out in life, he can ask many
things for them, which he could not independently
solicit for himself. Every one likes to oblige a journalist, 
if he can. But we should not recommend a
vain, frivolous, extravagant woman to marry a writer
dependent upon his pen. In one sense, the girl on
whom Edgar Leslie had fixed his affections was admirably 
suited to him&mdash;not in one sense, but in all
save one, the absolute impecuniosity in which she
rejoiced. We say rejoiced advisedly, because she was
so exceedingly happy at this time. At Rome she
met the Signora Stellini, who recognised in her little
Violet Grimshaw, her former pupil and favourite.
Poor Violet was then what Blanche herself had been,
a governess in a vulgar and upstart family of rich
"snobs." They met on the Pincian Hill one afternoon; 
and Blanche, as we will now call her, saw at
a glance her position, and determined to rescue her
from it if she could. She accordingly sent her a
note requesting an interview. At first the British
matron, who commanded the "young person's"
services, demurred. But Blanche sent Edgar Leslie,
who had been introduced to her in his professional
calling, and with whose intelligence and amiability
she was charmed, as her ambassador, and Leslie was
not to be refused. At least, he acted like an accomplished 
diplomatist, and bribed Mrs. Minnifey with
an opera-box, and was wicked enough to pay some
delicate attentions to that lady's eldest daughter,

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

Georgina, who was not a beauty of Giorgione, but a
Gorgon of ugliness and conceit. "Miss Grimshaw,"
he said with truth, "knew a family in England
with whom the Signora had formerly been intimate,
and she wished to make some particular inquiries,"
which she did. Blanche had seen in an English newspaper 
the failure of Grimshaw's speculations recorded
in some bitter remarks on his career and death. Her
heart had yearned to little Violet, and she regarded
their accidental meeting as a special and most providential 
occurrence. Having speedily arrived at the
conclusion, that her ci-devant pupil was wholly unspoiled, 
and as ingenuous and sweet a girl as she
had promised to become, Blanche determined at
once to confide to her such particulars of her history,
as she deemed prudent and wise. She said nothing
of her attempted suicide and rescue, as Violet had
never heard the tale.</p>

<p>"And now," she added, smiling, "if you will
come to me, I will promise you that whilst I live
you shall never want a home. I shall engage your
services as my companion, dear child, and offer you
double your present salary, without fear that I shall
be guilty of an extravagant act. I am apprehensive
that you will have to stay a month longer in your
present abode; but if my friend Mr. Leslie and I can
devise any scheme for an earlier emancipation, you
may be sure that we shall do so."</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie did devise a scheme, which we shall
narrate in the ensuing chapter, as it deserves one for
itself.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. MINNIFEY MEETS A LORD.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"I hate lords," said Bob Smith to us the other day, "because I'm
not one of them. But, oh, lord! if I were, that's all! I shouldn't
care for much money; one hundred pounds a-year would do just for
washing bills and tolls (say eighty-five pounds, since turnpikes are now
so nearly abolished). I would live, sir, on the substantial adulation
of the middle-class English public&mdash;live, like a lord! I would ride
tradesmen's horses, drink shopkeepers' wine, kiss their commercial
daughters when pretty, get their vulgar cheques cashed, and borrow
their dirty 'tin.' When I got old, and <i>bien rang&eacute;</i>, I would ennoble
some Sarah Anne, make her my salle-&agrave;-manger, d'ye see? Not so
bad, eh?&mdash;for a lord."&mdash;<i>From the Note-book of Solomon Trustall, Esq.,
LL.D</i>.</p>

<p>MRS. MINNIFEY was a little woman in a constant
state of fuss and perspiration, and with a red nose
and a profusion of false curls. What took such a
woman to Rome? What takes half, nay, three parts,
of the travelling British public abroad? It is a
national epidemic under which we labour; one of
the symptoms of the general softening of the British
brain. Mr. Minnifey had made money, and had
daughters. Other people went to Rome&mdash;the Browns,
for example. Miss Minnifey sang in a truly first-rate
style to an accompaniment on one of Erard's best
pianos. At least, if she did not, her father had been

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

swindled; for he paid a "sight of money" for the
accomplishment, as he told his friends. He was the
only person in the world whom that young lady refused 
constantly to oblige, when he would ask, after
his afternoon's nap, for a tune on the "pianner." It
is due to Miss Minnifey to say, that she acted under
her mother's authority in this objection to gratify
her paternal parent. It was part of the elder lady's
system to snub her husband in all his inclinations.
On this occasion she had sent him to Margate during
her continental trip, and engaged the services of a
courier by way of male protection. There was one
droll little figure the less in the Piazza di Spagna,
and one on the Pincian Hill&mdash;one English marionette
the less in the foreign medley abroad. In one thing
Mr. Minnifey would not have offended; at least,
during his first continental trip. He would not
have worn the fag-end of his wardrobe, and dressed
himself in a costume between that of a cockney disciple 
of Izaak Walton as depicted by "Punch," and
a bagman out of work. Foreigners have lately discovered 
why so many English rush abroad. It is
to wear out their old clothes! Mr. Minnifey was
much more comfortable at Margate, and Margate
was much more comfortable with him, than Rome
could possibly have been.</p>

<p>It happened that Edgar Leslie knew a lord. This
was a youthful British autocrat, who drove a four-in-hand 
and hunted at Rome. He was very good-natured, 
and fond of fun. So Edgar let him into
the secret of the Signora's desire for the immediate
liberation of Violet from her house of bondage.

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

Lord Wallowby was introduced to Mrs. Minnifey
in due form. He took Miss Minnifey to see St.
Peter's on his arm, whilst Edgar and Mrs. Minnifey
walked behind. When they entered the sacred fane,
Miss Minnifey fell into raptures about the statues,
the mosaic work, and the grandeur and wealth of
decoration of the whole building. It was this, or
any part of it, plus the attentions of a lord, which
made Miss Minnifey hysterically poetical and loud
on the occasion.</p>

<p>"Yaas," said his groomy lordship, in answer to her
demand whether the "coo d'aile" was not sublime,
"dollops of marble, ain't there?"</p>

<p>Such a remark from a nobleman who had been
at Oxford, if he had not taken his degree, was not
intellectual, nor elegant, nor sensible; but Miss Minnifey 
pressed his arm to her side, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Ah! see, see, my lord!" by which she meant an
Italian mode of expressing her accordance with the
sentiments which he had uttered.</p>

<p>My lord, however, did his spiriting admirably, so
far as the Minnifeys were concerned. He dined
with them, made outrageous love to the daughter,
talked a mixture of stable slang and drawing-room
commonplace to the mother, and after dinner said to
the latter, suddenly:</p>

<p>"What a doosid pretty gal your governess is!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so, my lord?" was the answer.
"I'm sure we never found it out."</p>

<p>"Dessay not; but she's devilish fine eyes for all
that. Regular thorough-bred one, I should say."
And his lordship actually walked over to where the

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

governess was standing, and spoke to her, leaving
Mrs. and Miss Minnifey aghast.</p>

<p>"Oh, you low, mean, artful, designing hussy!"
she said to herself, or rather thought.</p>

<p>At that moment Edgar Leslie addressed her.
"Ah!" he said, "Mrs. Minnifey, I am charged with
a message from the Signora Stellini. You know she
leaves Rome almost immediately, and that she is
about to rob you of Miss Grimshaw, the daughter of
her old Staffordshire friends. Well now, could you
kindly manage&mdash;of course, if it occasions you no
inconvenience&mdash;to dispense with Miss Grimshaw's
services at once; that is, in a day or two? But,
perhaps, she will see you herself at Lady Madeiraville's 
to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"I 'ave not the honour," says Mrs. M., "of Lady
Madeiraville's acquaintance, or else I'm sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! the Signora is sufficiently intimate to ask
you; that is, if you'll dispense with a formal invitation," 
was the ready reply. "Wallowby!" (to that
young nobleman) "you'll be at Lady Madeiraville's
to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, I'm sure, unless these ladies are
going," replied that wicked young Corinthian "pillar
of the State." And he strolled over to the other side
of the room, where Miss Minnifey was sitting in
offended dignity, enraged at the insolence of the
"person," meaning Violet, and studying the bitterest
insult she could offer her, so soon as the guests should
be gone.</p>

<p>It was a strange repetition this, of a passage in
Blanche Aubrey's own experience as a governess in

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

the Grimshaw family; but both sketches we have
given of the treatment these young persons received
are, we fear, but too common in the families of the
wealthy vulgar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Minnifey had now two courses before her.
One was to get rid of her governess at once in the
manner proposed to her, and go to Lady Madeiraville's 
party on the strength of it; and the other to
keep Violet for the month, in which case she would
take care that the impudent minx should not make
her appearance before company again. The last plan
included vengeance and torture. But Edgar had
calculated well on the bait he had thrown out. To
be invited to the reception of a peeress and ex-cabinet
minister's wife! It was too much to lose.</p>

<p>"When," she said, in her blandest tones, those in
which she had been accustomed to address the customers 
in her husband's ironmonger's shop, "does
the Signora Stellini leave the Eternal City for 'ler
beller Firencey'?" by which she meant Florence, we
presume.</p>

<p>"Dopo domani," replied Edgar, rather maliciously.
When ignorant persons affect to speak in a foreign
language which they do not understand, they deserve
to be answered "after their folly." As the lady
merely stared at him in reply, he added, "The day
after to-morrow, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mrs. Minnifey, "tell the Signora
Stellini, with my compliments, that my governess.
Miss Grimshaw, will be at her disposal early on that
day, and I'll speak as to the young woman's character
when I see her at Lady Madeiraville's to-morrer

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

evening. Between you and I," she said, "I don't
think she'll find her a very suitable person; but, of
course, she knows her own business best. You may
mention that she has twenty pound a-year with me,
and finds her own washing. It's a good deal more
than many ladies would like to give her for all the
good she is, you know. I mention this, because I
should not like her to impose on the liberality of a
furrener."</p>

<p>It was with a strong effort that Edgar conquered
his indignation and disgust. But he had learned
early to check the display of his feelings in a somewhat 
severe school of training.</p>

<p>"Very good, madam!" he said, "I will acquaint
the Signora with your kind determination. Come,
Wallowby," he said to the young nobleman, who
was languidly amusing himself by trotting out the
confiding daughter of the house of Minnifey, late of
the Victoria-road, Pimlico. "Come, Wallowby, I
am sorry to tear you away, but I think you are
scarcely aware of the hour. The time files by so
rapidly, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had not the face to finish his sentence, which
made it all the more effective. As for Violet, she
had been banished on the first opportunity, after Lord
Wallowby had spoken to her. There was no chance
Edgar saw of her coming down again. So he and
Wallowby bade their adieux in a most gushing
manner, both to "mare and filly," as the young lord
called the pair, as soon as he got outside the door.</p>

<p>"And a beauty she is," he said; "rather gummy
about the hocks I should think. I say, old fellow

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

what are you going to stand for this? A 'mezzo
caldo' and a 'Polonia principe,' is the least I'll take.
Not bad that about the principe, ay? You can put
that in the next 'special' if you like."</p>

<p>The Principe Polonia had the monopoly of Roman
cigars at that period. We are afraid that attenuated
joke did find its way into the columns of the "Morning 
Blight." But not through Edgar Leslie; since
that was not the journal to which he was attached.
The fact is, that his lordship went about for a whole
week asking all his English acquaintances for a cigar,
in order to indulge his humour at the expense of
Polonia, tobacconist and prince.</p>

<div class="center" id="v3ch09">

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">A STORY THAT NEVER GROWS OLD.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"Marry without love?" I never said anything of the kind, young
man. But there are plenty of nice girls with money as well, whom
you can love just as much, if you don't see the necessity of being a
fool, sir, a fool! And I'll tell you what, sir, the love that comes after
marriage is of a much more enduring quality, than most of that which
goes before. The woman who runs away with a man is just as likely
to run away from him, when she takes it into her head. Of course,
your case is different from all others. "An angel," eh? Why, sir,
they employ two hundred in the pantomime at Covent Garden alone!
And what's more, they look it every night for three months at least,
and yours wouldn't last out the honey-moon, no, nor a week. There,
don't stare as if you would knock down a grey-headed old man. God
bless you, my dear boy, I wish I could be such a happy young idiot
again. "Married at Gretna Green?" Of course I was. But that's
no reason why I shouldn't give you good advice, which I never knew
a young man take yet, and don't expect I shall at my time of life.&mdash;<i>Precepts 
and Examples</i>.</p>

<p>SO Mrs. Minnifey lost the only attraction of her
house either to lord or commoner, and an admirable
and patient "gouvernante" and companion, or rather
"help," at the low figure of twenty pounds a-year. If
any one doubted to what extreme the malignity of
baffled vulgarity can go, they should have heard
Mrs. M. speak of Violet afterwards, that's all. Ah!
if the generous, and the good, and pure-hearted only
could know what is said of them, and imputed to

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

them by the instinctive hatred and mean jealousy of
sordid beings, it would sometimes astonish, even if
too absurd and far-fetched to shock their minds.
Yet a chance shaft will sometimes wound and rankle.
A Feejee Islander, watching the operations of an
astronomer, is not wider in his surmises of the truth
than base souls are in their estimate of the actions,
motives, and even language of those whose virtues
are above their intelligence, and beyond their ken.
Mrs. Minnifey knew Violet to be the daughter of a
bankrupt, and vaguely attached something of dishonesty 
to her character. "Ah!" she would say,
"<i>it</i> will come out some day." What that <i>it</i> was, it
might have puzzled her to define. She actually
looked upon the gentle, innocent girl as a creature of
the predatory class that ought to be kept under.
"Set her up, indeed!" she would say, a phrase which
means, if it has any specific meaning, that if such-and-such 
a person were "set up," the speaker would
be very happy to knock him or her down: but if
once "set up" fairly out of reach, then vulgarity and
malignity readily change their tone; as, for instance,
after the marriage of a governess to a lord. Long
after Mrs. Minnifey knew that Violet was married to
an untitled individual, she intimated her belief that
she was Lord Wallowby's cast-off mistress. "A very
intimate friend of ours at Rome, you know," she
would say, "although I have heard he was sadly
gay; but you can't wonder at that, for his father was
a great friend of George the Fourth, quite intimate,
I assure you." This was meant to be an excuse for
the modern Wallowby's peccadilloes.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

<p>"Well, if noblemen will be noblemen, it is no reason
why bankrupt people's daughters should throw themselves 
in their way. I am sure if I had been the
Countess of Poldoddery, his mother, one of the
dearest old ladies I ever knew, and not a bit of pride
about her&mdash;I should have been quite concerned to
have seen such goings on. I should very soon have
taken him out of her way, had I been in her ladyship's 
place, I can tell you. And that girl, who hadn't
three dresses to her back, sent her salary to a riffraff
brother in London, as soon as it was due. I call it
shameful, that's what I do."</p>

<p>It is astonishing what different views different
people take of the same things, and how a few paltry
circumstances will guide these views. Mrs. Minnifey
had one of the tenderest of hearts, as she and many
of her friends said: she was an original subscriber to
the "Refuge for Deserted Cats," and "them all the
dissolutists of Toms," as her own housemaid, one
of the most impudent girls that a workhouse ever
sent forth, observed. Mrs. Minnifey would weep over
Thaddeus of Warsaw, as many better people have
done before her; but she would persecute a poor,
unprotected, beautiful, amiable girl with the bitterness 
of an enraged fish-fag to the death.</p>

<p>Happily, however, Violet found a home, a friend,
and a lover, all at once, and like the delicate flower
whose name she bore, breathed the fragrance of life,
and light, and joy again. The Signora did not leave
Rome for a week longer than she intended, owing to
the earnest prayers of the <i>impresario</i> of the Tordinone
Opera House.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

<p>During that week, there were excursions to Tivoli
and Albano. During that week, Miss Minnifey was
disenchanted, and Cinderella had her innings of bliss.
As for Mrs. Minnifey, she told the domestics of the
hotel in the loudest tone, every morning, on the
stairs, that she was not at home to Lord Wallowby,
long after that horsey young patrician had ceased
definitively to call; nay, we must speak the truth,
after he had, to use his own polite phraseology, "cut
the old girl as dead as a herring," in the Corso, twice
in the same afternoon. We could not find it in our
hearts to excuse such rudeness on the part of a nobleman; 
but for two or three little hateful traits of character 
which the ex-ironmonger's lady had displayed.
In the first place, she condescended to cheat Violet
out of nearly a quarter's miserable salary, as the last
three months of her services had not been completed
by a few days when she left. In the next, she sent a
vindictive verbal message to the Signora's house, after
she had seen Violet radiant and happy in an Opera-box, 
and seated by the brilliant artiste's side in her
daily drives. "Mrs. Minnifey's compliments, and
would be glad to know, if the young woman as was
governess hadn't taken away a pearl brooch, and a
valuable Hindian shawl by mistake?" Of course,
these things had never been missing, but had been
purposely hidden by that vulgar and vindictive matron. 
Of course, a suitable reply was sent back and
an apology demanded and enforced. Are such things
possible? Yes, we have known such a woman deliberately 
bring false charges of robbery against the
poor servant whom she had ill treated and starved, in

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

order to avoid payment of her wages, and out of
general malignant spite, whilst her viperous daughter
assisted her in the horrible treachery practised against
the characters of girls dependent for their food and
existence on their good name. We have known,
we say, such a bloodless vampire of domestic life,
who preyed in this manner on relays of hapless girls,
whom an evil destiny betrayed into her unhallowed 
clutch.</p>

<p>Blanche took good care that Violet should never
hear of the brutal outrage of which the enraged
Mrs. Minnifey had been guilty. But, even if she
had known it, we question whether such drop of
vulgar poison would have mingled with the contents
of that cup of joy which made her last week at Rome
one exquisite holiday of delight to her young orphan
soul. Just two days before the Signora left for
Florence, she paid a farewell visit to Tivoli, where
the whole party remained that night at the Albergo
of the Signor Salvi, so well known to tourists of
every land. After dinner they took a moonlight
stroll, and the Signora was easily persuaded to pour
forth the thrilling melody of more than one exquisite
cavatina and Neapolitan barcarole. On that occasion
Edgar and Violet lingered a little behind the rest,
and then he passed his arm round her slender waist,
and told her that oft-repeated tale, which is ever fresh
as the bloom of roses, that blush in summer time
anew. Has not every rose a separate beauty and a
separate life? Is not every first love a fresh rose in
a new world? Did anything worthy of life or its
records ever exist, so far as they are concerned, before

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

the declaration of the last young true lover to his
chosen love? Was not the world made and pre-ordained 
for them up to that precise moment, when,
in the conscious fulness of ecstatic joy, they bless all
things, and unconsciously bless God? Surely to love
entirely and perfectly is the supreme obedience of the
soul. It is a moment of profound wisdom, for we
should, indeed, be unwise to forego it, considering that
it can never come again; and of profound folly, for
we are never so silly in our lives, especially if a third
party be witness of the ridiculous scene. It is a brief
experience of such perfect bliss, that we are not sure
if two human beings actually exchanging the first
kiss of first love, ought not instantly to be slain.
They never can be so happy again. They may live
to repent, to hate each other, to repeat the emotion
second-hand, and degrade it into a mere imposture
and pretence. They may live to make love like the
beasts of the field, and something infinitely worse,
when settlements and income have to do with the
surrender of maiden charms. First love has no
second thought&mdash;it has nothing to do with the world,
except so far as skies and stars, and seas and flowers,
are concerned; the murmur of streams, the song of
birds and a convenient trysting-place, where that
delicious nonsense, so superior to the highest philosophy 
of this earth, can be talked and whispered, unobserved 
by all the human race&mdash;especially an angry
father, or a plotting mamma. To be sure, there
are a variety of first lovers and first loves. There
are some who obey the great law of nature blindly
and without much inspiration. There are men who

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

waste the aroma of existence upon coquettes; or,
worse still, there are girls who lavish the bloom of
life upon libertines or fustian scoundrels armed with
tinsel sentiment and Cupid's artificial slang. There
is, alas! that we should say so, the love hight calf.
He is generally slaughtered on the altar of Anteros,
the false god. Your male calf of this description grows
up, too, not unfrequently into dissolute maturity,
or a respectable commercial animal of the domestic
kind. But when the first love of two tender and impassioned 
beings is worthily exchanged, and fortune
is propitious, when these two combine the best sentiments 
of Moore and Burns, and not only "climb the
hill (of life) together," but "love on till they die,"
the Paradise of two such young persons is somewhat
antedated, that is all. Such lovers were our Edgar
and Violet; and when the first kiss of their love
was exchanged, a serpent in the rustling foliage near
them raised his scaly crest and flat head with an
unnoticed hiss, and glided swiftly out of their neighbourhood 
into the darkness afar.</p>

<p>With what pity did the lovers regard the interlocutors 
in a conversation about love that evening round
the supper-table.</p>

<p>The Signora herself had declared that she feared
that it was almost impossible to find two persons
blest either by circumstance, or themselves, with a
pure and prosperous love to the end of human life.</p>

<p>"Perfectly impossible!" quoth Mr. Howard, an
old English gentleman, who lived chiefly on the Continent, 
and enjoyed himself without a home. "There
is no such thing. I confess it to be my notion of a

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

possible state of happiness hereafter. There may be
a sort of humdrum connubial felicity between persons
without imagination. But we don't take stock of these
in the High Court of Cupid."</p>

<p>The Signora sighed. She, at least, had found in
her own experience, that the best apparently secured
happiness may be destroyed by a ruthless kick at the
conjugal talisman.</p>

<p>"Love," pursued Mr. Howard, "is Boyhood's
Religion, Manhood's Doubt, and the Scepticism of
Old Age." And he looked round triumphantly as if
he had settled the question by an epigram, such as
it was. "Your love-match is always a mistake," he
continued. "You might as well attempt to light
the cigar of felicity at a catharine-wheel."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Edgar, laughing, "in the view
of those who are content to look upon smoking and
travelling by vetturino as the true solace of life. For
my part, I believe that all, save love-matches, are
dowered with misery. They commence with self-humiliation, 
and end with outrage, or a frigid compact 
and treaty of contempt."</p>

<p>"Love-matches commence with poverty very
often," replied Mr. Howard, "and end with hatred
and disaster. Let love&mdash;such as should be in the
sensible union of sensible people&mdash;come after marriage. 
There is some chance then that it will
last."</p>

<p>"No!" said the Signora, "I am convinced that
among all false proverbs there is none so false as that.
Love may come after marriage, but then it is seldom
for the husband or the wife."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

<p>"And pray," said Mr. Howard to Edgar, "since
you have spoken of travelling, what is life save a
journey and an ache? A tooth-ache, an ear-ache, a
stomach-ache, and a heart-ache&mdash;every sort of ache?
Time is the coachman who drives faster every succeeding 
stage, whilst his passengers get stiffer and
stiffer in their limbs. Those who travel most, see
most, and thereby at least live longest in sensation.
Those who remain at home, do one monotonous stage
over and over again. The last inn is the sign of the
'Jolly Sexton.' At the houses of refreshment on
the road, those who have money have seldom any
hunger and thirst, and those who have are generally 
without the means. Depend upon it, man is
best alone on such a journey. Who would travel
with brats?"</p>

<p>"You wicked old bachelor!" cried Edgar. "Continue, 
and condemn yourself for ever in our eyes.
What about friendship?"</p>

<p>"Friendship," replied the cynic, "is a fragile
structure, built of visiting-cards, blown down by the
lightest breath that frames a request to borrow ten
pounds."</p>

<p>"And what are your views of future happiness?"
rejoined Edgar. "I am inclined to think that a
man who does not believe in love must be an
atheist."</p>

<p>"A promissory note," was the reply, "drawn
upon eternity, and made payable nowhere. Belief
is the interest at blank per cent. In one respect it
is like a railway insurance ticket. You must be

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

destroyed, before it has a chance of being honoured.
And who knows whether it will be found upon you
after death?"</p>

<p>"Go on!" replied Edgar. "I like to know the
complete notions of a man who does not believe in
love."</p>

<p>"In love! yes, but what is love?" replied the other.
"A double selfishness, a vicious tumult of the imagination. 
Its passion does not elevate us above any of
the animal race. It is not proof against small-pox, age
and poverty, nor will it survive possession. Reciprocal
love is next to impossible in a permanent state. Supposing 
a man and woman to be created for each other,
how are they likely to meet among nine hundred
millions of souls. Depend upon it, a man never meets
with his ideal. Ideal is the contrary to real. All
the great love-stories of the world are founded upon
tragedies and comedies of error. Besides, a man
never knows what he really likes, until he gets too
old. When the judgment becomes mature, if it ever
does, it is time to die."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Signora, "you do not hear of the
happy marriages. It is their very essence not to
court publicity, not to be known or thought of outside 
the domestic home. I feel that all you have
said is nothing, and that you do not believe in it
yourself."</p>

<p>"I do not, fair lady," was the gallant reply; "but
I thought these young people might learn something
from me" (looking at Edgar and Violet). "I wished
to show them what a dreadful example a man may

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

become who has missed his own chance of happiness,
and envies that of others. Nay, I believe that at
some period of their lives the worst human beings
are capable of love, which is the greatest argument
I know against eternal punishment."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Signora, "you have been imposing 
upon us all this time with these atrocious
sentiments of yours. I hardly know what punishment 
to inflict."</p>

<p>"Alas! madam," said Mr. Howard, in a tone
which set all laughing, "I was sufficiently punished
when I first saw you. Then, indeed, I met at last
with my ideal of perfection, and no one can pretend
for a moment that my devotion met with the reciprocity 
which it deserved."</p>

<p>"Do you really think there is any truth in what
that horrid old thing said?" whispered Violet to
Edgar, just before they parted for the night. "Because, 
if there is&mdash;if you could ever&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Edgar!
tell me, speak!"</p>

<p>"It is not worth an argument," said Edgar.
"We know it is false&mdash;at least I do; do you not?
But, if I must really tell you what I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, yes!" was the answer, as she clung
imploringly to his extended arm.</p>

<p>"Then this is the only answer which I deign to
give." And so saying he caught her to his heart,
and imprinted a fervent kiss upon her lips.</p>

<p>It was wonderful what exuberance of style and
diction, what an ecstatic <i>r&eacute;jouissance</i> of thought
pervaded a letter which appeared in the paper of

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

which Edgar Leslie was foreign correspondent a few
days after that date. He wreathed the well-worn
monuments of classic Rome with laurels and roses,
strewed the Appian Way with flowers, and pictured
the liberation of the Eternal City by the illustrious
Garibaldi in a manner truly delightful to read in the
prosaic counting-houses of London merchants and
City men.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">ON THE BANKS OF THE ARNO.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>Nella quale dopo la dimostrazione fatta dall' Autore, perch&egrave; cagione
avvenisse di doversi quelle persone che appresso si mostrano, ragunare
a ragionare insieme sotto il reggimento di <i>Bianca</i> si ragiona quello che
pi&ugrave; aggrada a ciascheduno.</p>

<p>Affinities, Sympathies, Attractions, Coincidences, and Dreams have
more to do with the moulding of our every-day life, than the most
superstitious would like to confess. One thing is certain, which is,
that the greatest men and those who have exercised the most powerful
influence over their fellow-mortals have been particularly susceptible to
the influences of the mysterious middle-world and of the dim and fantastic 
revelations of that <i>Crepuscule</i> of the soul half-way between the
midnight of utter Knownothingism and the dawn of Eternal Light.&mdash;<i>&OElig;uvres 
de Polyanthe</i>, tome iii. c. viii.</p>

</div>

<p>"WAS there more mesmerism, more subtle electric
influence at work, more supernatural development,
in the earlier days of the world? If there were,
might it not account for many of the features of the
heathen mythology, its miracles and oracles, its
visions and revelations, its gods and goddesses, lares
and lemures, fauns and satyrs, nymphs and dryads,
and the general peopling of inanimate nature with
semi-divine or demoniac existence, from the 'parting
genius,' sent with sighing from his haunt at the
dawn of the Christian era, to the larvae skulking
about some lonesome tomb? In the Middle Ages

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

you have it still, though in a far wilder and fainter
degree. By-the-bye, have you ever read that most
exquisite poem of Thomas Hood, the 'Plea of the
Midsummer Fairies?' How thoroughly unappreciated 
was the nobler genius, the better half of that
man, the last great poet, with the exception of Tennyson, 
whom England can boast. And Tennyson is
completely <i>sui generis</i>, and all his host of imitators
ought to be kicked."</p>

<p>Such was the manner in which a young and good-looking 
gentleman, of some twenty-four or twenty-five 
years of age, rambled on, to a mixed party, chiefly
of English, seated at a picnic in the grounds of a
villa about half-way up the mount that was crowned
by the ancient city of Fiesole.</p>

<p>The spot had been well chosen for the purpose
which had brought that goodly company together.
It was a level space surrounded by marble benches,
so arranged that in the sunniest day of August they
were more than half in shade. A wall of live oak,
with the crisp shiny leaves that distinguish that tree,
rose to a height of some twenty feet, and was scored
out at intervals in the shape of niches to receive
statues of Ceres, Pomona, Flora, and others, which
thus became silent but not inappropriate spectators
of the rural feast.</p>

<p>The outer ridge of the platform was protected by
a balustrade, also of white marble, on which appeared 
vases of the same stone, of the graceful
Etruscan form, bearing dwarf aloes, which might
have been coeval with the vases themselves, so little
attention do they need in that genial atmosphere.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

<p>Although the grounds continued for some distance
beyond this spot, no more of them were visible, and
the eye travelled on right across the Val d'Arno,
till it lighted upon the fair city&mdash;<i>Fiorenza la bella</i>&mdash;and 
the picturesque mountains on the other side of
the valley.</p>

<p>The air was so clear that he who knew the topography 
of the city might have pointed with his finger
to its many palaces of historic fame. But to the
glance of the least learned were revealed the richly-tinted 
Campanile standing beside Brunelleschi's dome,
the bold steeple of the Palazzo Vecchio, the square
tower of the Bargello, and further to the right the
rugged fa&ccedil;ade of the Palazzi Pitti. these stood out
in sharp relief from the surrounding buildings; and
beyond the city&mdash;forming an admirable background&mdash;appeared 
the heights of San Miniato, Poggio Imperiale, 
Bello Sguardo, and Monte Oliveto, whose very
names were suggestive of the loveliness of which
they possessed so large a share.</p>

<p>And over all was one of the clearest of Italian
skies; the air was rich with the perfume of orange
blossom, jessamine, and the subtle-sweet <i>gaggier;</i> the
green-backed lizards ran swiftly in the sunshine, and
from a grove hard by the nightingales poured forth
a flood of song.</p>

<p>The conversation, commenced in the way shown,
at the opening of our chapter, fell, as it is often wont
to do, upon spiritualism, supernatural visitants, and
such topics. No one in answer to the first speaker
attempted to advocate any of the would-be copyists

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

of the Tennysonian school, which went far to show
that there were no pretenders and impostors present.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Leslie," said a pleasant old
gentleman, with white hair and a fresh colour, "I
think we are in danger of reverting to both heathenism 
and its mythology at once. No superstition
of the Middle Ages approaches, in my opinion, in
delirious folly this mania of spirit-rapping. I can't
say that I have seen anything extraordinary myself,
save the credulity and imposture connected with it.
Have any of you?"</p>

<p>The response was in the negative. Every one
knew somebody who had witnessed the most marvellous 
things.</p>

<p>"All I know is," said the first speaker, "that I
have assisted at two <i>s&eacute;ances</i>, one amateur, the other
professional, and found both utter failures. The
latter was at the chambers of a late eminent journalist, 
in the Temple. The chief male professor
was a kind of spiritual Yankee Squeers. He had
with him the most weird-looking youth I think I
ever saw as a medium. He looked like an imaginary
Edgar Poe's corpse stolen by resurrection-men and
galvanised especially for the occasion, or Paganini's
youngest brother, kept awake for a fortnight by the
fiendish cruelty of his brother, who had played to
him the whole time a fantasia del diavolo on one
string, and wouldn't let him sleep."</p>

<p>"But poor Paganini himself," interrupted Miss
Violet, "must have been awake all the time, too."</p>

<p>"Matter-of-fact young lady," cried Leslie, laughing, 

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

"was he not a supernatural personage&mdash;at least
on the violin?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I was about to tell you, the whole thing
was a failure, and the professor's wife scornfully told
us that the 'sperrits was angry with such a blasphemious 
and unbelieving lot,' as we were. The
livid youth with long hair had only impressed us with
pity for his forlorn and imbecile state. We wondered
if they starved him, and whether we ought to interfere.
We held a brief <i>s&eacute;ance</i> of our own in the next room,
when it was put to the vote, whether the professor
and another man of the party ought not to be kicked
down-stairs. But the majority agreed that it would
be a breach of good faith and hospitality, as he had
been invited to come and show us what he could do.
So we paid him and let him go, with a caution, I can
tell you. The amateur affair was worse. It was at
a small literary club. There was collusion at the
table, and two if not three dupes. I soon saw the
artifice, and at first assisted in the fraud, and then
turned the proceedings to fun. There was much talk
of a certain cold hand which was to appear and touch
the cheek of the chief dupe. But it didn't. If it had, I
should have grasped it, had I thereby upset table and
all. I have no doubt that it would have turned out
to be a wax hand at the end of a wire. The room
was darkened. I left them about four o'clock A.M.,
and never felt more disgusted in my life at the
wickedness and folly of the whole performance. Very
soon after, the young man whom I have called the
chief dupe, and who was gifted with remarkable but

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

precocious talent, died. His whole nervous system
was upset.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he took opium, or other stimulants," said
the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Very likely," responded the other.</p>

<p>"Well," said La Stellini, whose English was pronounced 
with a slightly foreign accent, which imparted 
a peculiar charm to the rich tones of her voice,
"I for one admit that I am exceedingly superstitious,
especially as regards omens and dreams. I would
not sit down one of thirteen at table if I could
help it."</p>

<p>"And I never walk under a ladder," cried Sir
Robert Warkworth, a young English baronet.</p>

<p>"And my English maid wouldn't break a looking-glass 
for the world," said the Signora, looking towards 
Susan, who was playing at a short distance
with little Arthur.</p>

<p>"Very proper superstition that," said Mr. Howard,
the old gentleman, who had already spoken. "I wish
that servants would extend it to drinking-glasses, and
especially old china. Let us encourage that superstition 
by all means; but I'll tell you a story just
now about thirteen at table, a singular coincidence
which I witnessed myself."</p>

<p>"Let's all tell a story," cried Violet, clapping her
hands; "that is, every one except me, for I don't
know a single one, I declare. You shall tell one for
me," she said to young Leslie. "Won't you?"</p>

<p>"In this light and this cheerful society, I don't
mind it," said La Stellini; "but I object to ghost

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

tales at night, especially when one is going to bed in
a spacious and old-fashioned room. Allons, messieurs! 
Come, Signor Edgardo, you shall begin."</p>

<p>The party crowded round the young journalist,
who, casting a look at Violet, as if to see that she
was sufficiently near to insure his perfect felicity,
commenced:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't do, if you please," interrupted
Violet, "it must be quite a modern story, and perfectly 
true."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Edgar, "I will try again. My
grandmother was a woman of the strong-minded
school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bother your grandmother!" said the baronet,
"with all due respect, I mean, but that's much too
long ago."</p>

<p>"It must be a story," said Mr. Howard, "about
something which has happened either to yourself or
some one whom you know say within the last thirty
years."</p>

<p>All laughed at this margin, extending, as it did,
some five or six years beyond the age of the proposed
narrator.</p>

<p>"Well, then," responded Edgar; "but it must be
a melancholy story, you know."</p>

<p>"You can't easily have a funny ghost-story, if it is
true," said a young lady. Thus duly admonished,
Edgar Leslie commenced his tale, and told it exceedingly 
well. As, however, it was one of a somewhat 
common type of "real" ghost stories, we shall
not give it here.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

<p>The usual comments were made about it, and
everybody tried to explain it in the usual sensible
way, with the exception of the Signora, who looked
unusually pale.</p>

<p>"I see," said Edgar to her, "that you are not a
sceptic; and yet I dare say there is not one of these
bold unbelievers who would like to pass the night in
a church, or even in a picture gallery, alone."</p>

<p>"Faith! I should think not, indeed," said little
Major O'Reilly, an officer of the Pope's Noble Guard
at Rome. "My grandfather, for his sins, once got
locked up in Westminster Abbey all night. I don't
know what took him there at all, seeing that he was
a Catholic, unless it was a pretty girl that he had
followed in, maybe to convert her; but I believe he
saw a sheriffs' officer outside the door, as he was
coming out, and he went back and stayed there so
long, that he got fastened in."</p>

<p>"And what happened to him?" "Was he frightened?" 
"Did he see anything?" "I should have
gone out of my senses." "What did he do?" were
some of the various questions and remarks made by
the ladies of the assembled party.</p>

<p>"The divil himself wouldn't have frightened Pat
O'Reilly," said the major, "unless he had come in
the likeness of a process-server with a writ. What
did he do? Why he whistled and sang; and, as he
had plenty of leisure, I dare say he tried to come to
a conclusion whether he liked fair ladies or dark best&mdash;which 
is what I once tried myself in quarantine."</p>

<p>"And what conclusion did you arrive at, major?"
asked the Signora.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

<p>"Well, ma'am," replied O'Reilly, "I found it
depinded entirely on the complexion of the angel I
saw last."</p>

<p>"And did nothing happen to your grandfather,
then, after all?" inquired Violet, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>"Tare an' ouns! I ask your pardon, miss, for the
expression; something did happen to him, that very
nearly prevented my telling you the story; for it was
a mercy he ever lived to marry my grandmother at
all, at all."</p>

<p>"Do tell us, major, did he see anything?" asked
Violet.</p>

<p>"He saw so many things, my dear young lady,
that it was a miracle he ever set eyes on a sheriffs'
officer again. I tell you he was chased all round the
building by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By spectres and hobgoblins, of course?" said
Edgar, laughing at the major, who was quietly
taking his snuff at this exciting point of his story.</p>

<p>"Spectres!" said the major, derisively. "Daymons, 
is it ye're after? I can tell you he'd rather
have been hunted in that place by all the bailiffs in
England, with the Lord Chancellor at their head, or
a pack of jealous women led by Biddy Flanagan herself, 
to whom he promised marriage at Ballyhoolagan,
than be hunted as he was."</p>

<p>"But what on earth was it, eh?" asked Mr.
Howard.</p>

<p>"It was just getting dark," said the major; "and
my grandfather had got tired of walking round and
looking at the statues, and the inscriptions were

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

getting too dim for him to puzzle at them any longer,
and so he laid down very comfortably in a nook, said
his prayers, crossed himself, wished for a pipe of
tobacco, and went to slape like a Christian gentleman."</p>

<p>"Well?" they all said.</p>

<p>"He awoke, fancying something was tugging at
his toes, as he said, like the ghost of the gout, and
perceived the moonlight streaming in through the
windows, and casting fantastic shadows around; and
then he heard a strange gibbering, squeaking sound,
and a number of dusky forms were scurrying and
hurrying about, and darting from point to point.
They were&mdash;&mdash;" Here the major took another long
pinch of snuff&mdash;"what do you think?"</p>

<p>A pause ensued, when one young lady timidly suggested 
"Vampires," and another, "Ghouls."</p>

<p>"The ghosts of departed sheriffs' officers and
sponging-house keepers condemned to play at prisoners' 
base," suggested Edgar.</p>

<p>"It's not exactly there I'd look for them, anyhow," 
observed the major, dryly. "Can't any of ye
guess?"</p>

<p>No one responded, and the major said, "What
d'ye think of rats?"</p>

<p>"Rats!" cried the ladies with one breath.</p>

<p>"Rats! by scores, and hundreds, and thousands!
for all I know," was the answer.</p>

<p>"How horrid!" "Whatever did the poor man
do?" "I declare I should have fainted," &amp;c. &amp;c.,
were the various feminine exclamations heard.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my grandmother, luckily," said the

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

major, "or it's very likely she would. My ancestor
had very little time to deliberate. As far as he could
judge, the enemy were mustering, or holding a
council of war. Before he could well clap his hat
firmly on his head, and get up, the whole body
charged him in column. Helter, skelter, one over
another, score over score, by sections and companies,
with small shrill fierce squeaks, on they came, and off
he went, round and round the building; more than
once he slipped and almost fell. Then he nearly
broke his neck by catching his foot in some projecting
part of a recumbent effigy. Never was such a chase
before or since, as a mad Irishman hunted by a legion
of rats in the ould abbey that night. Now and then
he felt them leap against his legs, but he couldn't
stop to kick out&mdash;he hadn't breath to spare to shout,
and if he had, it would have been useless. Suddenly, 
as he came round in the broad light of the
moon opposite the side from which she shone upon
that frightful but fantastic race, he perceived&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" they all cried, male as well as female
listeners this time.</p>

<p>"That the rats had divided their forces with infernal 
generalship, and that he was met by a column
in front."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, sir!" said Mr. Howard, who had
got excited, "how then did he manage to escape?"</p>

<p>"He was a fine young active fellow, who had
taken an eagle's nest in the Kerry mountains in his
day. He paused a moment, kicked out desperately
with his riding-boots left and right at the foremost
files of the enemy, looked around him, saw in an

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

instant that he had stopped at the foot of a lofty and
emblematical monument, made a dash at it, and in a
moment was seated triumphantly with his legs firmly
clutched round the neck of an effigy of Fame or
Britannia rewarding some defunct hero with a stone
or marble wreath. The rats came swarming up and
actually reached his feet. He managed to pull off a
boot and kept hitting the topmost with it, until they
got tired of the game. Nor did he, I assure you,
lave his perch, until early dawn. I don't like to state
anything that is not perfectly true; but I was told
that my ancestor having dropped the boot, after a
vain effort to draw it on again, the rats carried it off
as a trophy, and that he consequently cut a quare
figure in the morning when the abbey doors were
opened by the astonished vergers. Had he met with
a sheriffs' officer then, he would have found some
difficulty in retreating."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he have taken off the other boot?" asked
Edgar, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Is it really true?" inquired a young lady of the
party.</p>

<p>"My grandfather said so," replied the major,
"and few men liked to dispute his word. He did
fight one duel with a professor of natural history
from Dublin on the subject."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Sir Robert.</p>

<p>"Well, you see the professor showed some symptoms 
of unbelief. He had formerly been demonstrator 
of anatomy at St. Thomas's, which may have
had something to do with the matter. But the professor 
apparently gave in at last, and they were

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

about to drink each other's health&mdash;the discussion
took place in a tavern, you must know&mdash;when an
unhappy incident put an end to a peaceful solution
of the matter."</p>

<p>"And what might that be?" inquired Edgar.</p>

<p>"My grandfather asked the professor, who was a
bit of a wag it would seem, what liquor he preferred, 
and he answered 'Ratafia.' That settled the
matter. They met in Battersea Fields, and my grandfather, 
who swore his adversary should never wear
both boots again, shot him in the left knee, and thus
kept his promise."</p>

<p>"But are people&mdash;I mean other people&mdash;ever
attacked in this way? Was any one ever really
eaten?"</p>

<p>"A few choristers and charity-boys occasionally, I
believe," said Edgar, "who get locked in at play;
but they are supposed to have run off to sea, and no
one cares to inquire about them."</p>

<p>"Don't be such a wretch," said a young lady.</p>

<p>"I did know a case," observed Mr. Howard,
"where one of those miserable beings who get
their living by raking the sewers in London, suffered 
his light to be extinguished, or had the misfortune 
to drop his lantern. Nothing was found of
him the next day but his bones, his implements of
work, and a box of Holloway's ointment. The voracity 
of these creatures is only equalled by their intelligence."</p>

<p>"It was a tacit rebuke to the memory of the deceased 
Lord Aldborough," remarked the incorrigible
Edgar.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

<p>"Or rather a voice from the sewers," added Sir
Robert. "Come, Mr. Howard, you've finished your
cigar. Give us your story of the thirteen at dinner,
and I'll tell you an anecdote of the Temple, for the
truth of which I can vouch. I don't mean the
Temple at Paris, Signora!" he said to La Stellini,
"but a sort of bachelor residence of barristers,
avvocati, you know, in London&mdash;a very romantic
place, I assure you, where adventure abounds. Imagine 
the license of the barrack combined with the
educated subtlety of the law, and you can form some
notion of what it is. A cloister without monastic
restrictions in the heart of London; quaint old edifices 
of the last three centuries, Anne upon Elizabeth 
in architecture, patched and renovated by the
Georges, and rebuilt when they threaten to fall, or
when a portion is burnt down by a judge, for instance, 
who puts his candle under his bed, even up
to the present time, in any sort of style. Trees, and
gardens, and a fountain, and sun-dials ornament a
spot which you might people in imagination with
ladies in sacques and periwigged gallants wearing
swords and lace ruffles, all of the olden time. Imagine, 
too, the din of the streets shut out, the broad
river, looking at least picturesque by night, sweeping
by, with its barges, and piers, and steamers, and a
glimpse of bridges, over which Commerce is ever
creeping with its ant-like multitude, and their
gigantic bales, and you have some idea of our
London Temple, where I have the privilege to reside,
when not, as at present, indulging in my annual
vacation ramble."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

<p>"I have seen it," said the Signora, after a pause,
"and remember well the air of what you call mouldy
solitude which is so striking in the very heart of
your great, and, pardon me, I think, overgrown
London. Come, signor" (to Howard), "let us have
your story of the Tredici. I am impatient to learn it."</p>

<p>"Udire ed obbedire," said that gentleman, whose
Italian usually dispensed with anything like idiom,
even if it ever achieved accent or grammar. "Cominciamo!" 
and he commenced:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was invited, not long since, to dine at a certain
much-frequented tavern, by Colonel C., the American, 
of fire-arm fame. Two of the guests, one the
well-known Tom Rokely, secretary to I don't know
how many institutions, and connected with science
and the drama in the most wonderfully practical, and
busy manner, declared their great regret at being
obliged to leave very early; indeed, they feared they
should not be able to remain even to the end of the
substantial part of the entertainment. Suddenly it
was discovered that there were thirteen at dinner, and
some one foolishly said that the first person who left
the table would die within three months. After a
time, it became perceptible that neither Tom Rokely
nor the other gentleman, whose name I forget, showed
the slightest inclination to depart. No one, of
course, wished them to go; but a great deal of what
is vulgarly termed chaff&mdash;badinage, I mean&mdash;took
place. Our host endeavoured to silence this in vain.</p>

<p>" 'Why, Rokely,' said one, 'it is nearly ten o'clock.
I declare you'll be too late for the new piece!'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

<p>" 'I say, Smith' (for so I will call him), said
another, 'you've forgotten your appointment!'</p>

<p>"These gentlemen, of course, declared that the
company was so delightful, they could not tear themselves 
away. Well, it got towards the time when all
must necessarily have taken their departure, and
somehow no one seemed at all anxious to stir. An irrepressible 
individual, who sat next to me, and who had
been very pointed in his remarks, had just proposed,
I remember, that the whole party should rise simultaneously, 
and thus 'cheat the devil,' as he called it;
upon which some one else facetiously asked if that
would not endanger the whole party; when suddenly
General M., an officer of the United States army, and
a man of great scientific attainments, rose.</p>

<p>" 'Gentleman,' he said, 'I have heard all this
foolish talk with some impatience and surprise. I do
not think it worthy of this company. For myself, I
am prepared to meet my Maker, when it shall please
Him to call on me.'</p>

<p>"In this strain he continued for some ten minutes,
and then solemnly bowing to his host and the company, 
he stalked to a side-table, placed his broad-brimmed 
hat upon his head, advanced to the door,
faced about, bowed solemnly again, and retired. We
all remained looking at each other with surprise.
Never had a wet blanket been more effectually applied 
to the joviality of a convivial lot, except,
madam" (turning to the Stellini) "perhaps in that
scene in 'Lucrezia Borgia,' an opera which you
have so wonderfully embellished with your exquisite

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

performance, when the monks are heard chanting a
funeral service by the doomed and startled guests.
At length, Colonel C. broke the silence by requesting 
some one to pass the wine, and we began
to talk about the General's extraordinary demeanour
and speech. I should have told you that the General
was a man still in the prime of life, with a colour like
a rose, and ordinarily as cheerful and cheery a gentleman 
as you could find, full of dry humour, and
exceedingly fond of a joke. On this occasion his tall
and commanding person, his forbidding and almost
sepulchral accents, and the strange solemnity and
severity of his address, exercised an influence over
us all, which we in vain tried to throw off. I remember 
saying to my lively neighbour, that it
seemed as if the General had pronounced his own
funeral oration, and that he was what the Scotch call
'fey.'</p>

<p>" 'I shall certainly take especial notice if he dies
within the time,' whispered he whom I addressed.</p>

<p>"Our host got up and proposed General M.'s
health, and passed a merited eulogy on his career,
character, and services. 'I think,' he said, smiling,
'that he has got a tooth-ache to-day. I never saw
him in such a humour before.' We could not, however, 
succeed in restoring the joviality of the party,
which soon after broke up. It is a fact," continued
Mr. Howard, "that within three months General
M. died very suddenly, and, as I understood, with
no premonitory sign; and, what is more, it was on
the return home to join an affectionate family, and
almost, if not quite, within sight of the quays of

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

New York. Colonel C., who was much attached
to him, could not bear the slightest reference to the
fact afterwards, and I don't believe there was one of
the company who was not deeply impressed by the
circumstance."</p>

<p>"Is it really a fact, Signor Lessingham?" asked
the Signora, addressing a young man of a somewhat
pensive and Byronic aspect, who sat near her, and
who had scarcely ventured an observation during the
whole afternoon&mdash;"is it really a fact, that there are,
or have been, persons in Paris who earn their living
by making a fourteenth at these otherwise unlucky
repasts?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," was the reply. "At any rate,
there is a novel, one of Balzac's, I think, founded on
such an alleged practice."</p>

<p>"I fancy," observed Edgar, "that there must be
a double intention in such an institution, if it exists.
Such an individual, if gifted with great conversational 
powers and wit, and well furnished with anecdotes 
and the topics of the day, would, with his
continued opportunities of observation, form a capital
addition to an ordinary dinner-party."</p>

<p>"So he would," said Howard. "I dare say, if
such a man ever did announce his profession, many
parties of thirteen would be especially given to afford
an excuse for his presence."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't suit English manners," said Sir
Robert. "People would never treat him sufficiently
as one of themselves."</p>

<p>The speaker was immediately called upon for his
contribution to spiritualistic records.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

<p>"We were a pleasant little society in the Temple,"
he said, "and gave ourselves a classical name. We
met once a week at each other's chambers alternately, 
and talked of everything, including law, politics, 
religion, the belles-lettres, and le beau sexe.
Amongst us was a gentleman of confirmed atheistical
views&mdash;in fact, a materialist&mdash;and he had the bad
taste constantly to intrude his ideas on the subject.
A religious enthusiast is bad enough; but an enthusiastic 
free-thinker, a man whose religion is utter
infidelity, and who endeavours to convert others to
his miserable creed, is the worst of all propagandists
in this world. It is literally working gratis for the
Author of Evil; at least, such is my notion. Even a
godless attorney does not directly meddle with the
affairs of his victim's soul, does not endeavour to
get those title-deeds into his possession as a set-off
against a diabolical bill; but a voluntary chaplain
of Satan seeks first to make a proselyte of his
friend."</p>

<p>"I once knew a man," observed Edgar, "who
was both an attorney's clerk and an active propagandist 
of materialism."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" said Howard; "and what became 
of him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular that I know of. He is
only doubly 'articled,' that is all," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What an attorney for future Palmers!" cried
Howard. "But pray, Sir Robert, continue the story
we have interrupted."</p>

<p>"In spite of all," resumed the baronet, "Ritson
was a good fellow, and very popular. His cheerful

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

temper and generous disposition, combined with his
great fund of information, and mathematical, chemical, 
and general knowledge, rendered him in all other
respects a desirable companion, as well as an agreeable
friend. I may mention that he was about forty
years of age, and in good and increasing chamber
practice as a banister. His chambers were in a
block of buildings forming an angle with those in
which lived the founder of our little institution, the
clever, brilliant, caustic and Johnsonian, Wigham
Tooke, who wrote the 'History of the Last Century'
at twenty-one years of age; the 'eminent Whig
statesman,' as we delighted to call him, because of
his avowed political principles and connexion with
Holland House, and also a contested election which
he had stood in early life. At every dissolution of
Parliament, and on some other occasions, when a
vacancy occurred in a Tory borough, our friend was
in the habit of issuing an address based on the most
enlightened platform of compromise and pseudo-liberalism 
of the Bedford type. Their chambers
being thus adjoining, and Tooke's being on the
second while Ritson's were on the first floor, the
former could overlook the latter, as he sat at work
daily at a table near the window in his private room.
Frequently, after business hours, Tooke would throw
open his window and hail Ritson, either to accompany
him for a walk, or to proceed with him to dinner.
On one occasion, on the Monday after a Saturday
night meeting of the 'club,' if I may so call it, at
which Ritson, to my astonishment and disgust, for I
was present as a guest on the occasion, had indulged

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

in more than his wonted blasphemies, Tooke met
him near the door of the Temple Church, and expressed 
his surprise that he had not seen him that
day from his window sitting at work as usual.</p>

<p>" 'Then I don't know where your eyes were,' was
the reply; 'for I've only just left chambers, and
I've scarcely moved from my accustomed seat since
morning.'</p>

<p>" 'That's very odd,' replied the other, 'I declare I
looked out for you a dozen times, and didn't see you.
In fact,' he said, 'you couldn't have been there.'</p>

<p>" 'You be hanged!' replied Ritson. 'I'm always
there. I'm the most regular and punctual fellow
in my habits in the Temple. I don't believe I've
missed being in that self-same chair at that self-same 
table and spot, except in vacation time, Sundays, 
and holidays, once these last three years; and,
what is more, by &mdash;&mdash;, if God Almighty himself was
to try, he couldn't prevent me, and that's all about
it. Keep a better look out to-morrow, old fellow,
and you'll see me fast enough.'</p>

<p>" 'Nonsense!' said Tooke, 'I wish you wouldn't
say such things.' And so they parted.</p>

<p>"The next day, Tooke looked out for him, and the
day after, and the day after that, in vain; and then
he sent his clerk over to inquire after him. The
answer was that Mr. Ritson hadn't been very well
since Monday. A few days more elapsed, and then
Tooke went to see him, and found him cheerful, but
very unwell.</p>

<p>" 'I shall soon be at work again,' he said. 'Here's
my poor old mother quite frightened.' He was an

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

only and most excellent son, and lived with the old
lady. 'You see,' he added, 'it's such an extraordinary 
thing for me to be laid up. I haven't had
a day's illness, since I was a boy.'</p>

<p>"The next time Tooke called, he found him very
bad indeed, and quite desponding about himself,
though calm and collected, as usual, and even as
much inclined to joke as ever. To Tooke's inquiry
about his health, he answered, the old lady being
present, 'Eheu! moribundus,' and then went off into
the current topics of the day. Tooke never saw him
again. He died about a week after, having never
re-entered his chamber since that sinister conversation."</p>

<p>"And did he repent," asked the Signora, "and
ever allude to what he had said?"</p>

<p>"Not he," replied Sir Robert; "I question if he
ever remembered or thought of it, but Tooke did,
and it very much altered his mode of thinking and
expression. Tooke questioned his medical man, a
friend of them both, and he said that he went off
quite composedly, 'like an angel,' as the old nurse
said."</p>

<p>"Then it is not true," said the Signora, "that
such people die in frightful agonies."</p>

<P>"Only in tracts, madam, and sermons," said Mr.
Howard. "The great Dr. Johnson, one of the chief
luminaries of British literature and an eminent
pietist, had a painful and degrading dread of death.
Some old ladies, who are extremely devout and religious, 
actually go mad with apprehension of a future
state, and in their delirium will take to swearing like

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

parrots in a public-house. I certainly don't think that
a bad conscience would tend to alleviate the pangs of
a long illness, or smooth the lingering sufferings of dissolution, 
let the sinner be never be so hardened."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Lessingham," cried two or three
young ladies together, clapping their hands, "it's
your turn. We expect such a delightful story from
you."</p>

<p>The gentleman appealed to started, blushed, and
said, "Really ar, I have nothing to tell. My life ar,
I may say, has not been without ar&mdash;but as for anything 
very striking or particular beyond a few&mdash;what
I may call&mdash;sympathies ar;" and here he stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh! tell us some," said a young lady, who directly 
she heard her own voice, looked almost as confused 
as Lessingham himself.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of good-natured mirth expressed 
at poor Mr. Lessingham's expense.</p>

<p>"Signor Lessingham means probably some instances 
of those strange magnetic affinities, those
mysterious revelations of the soul, which have some
time or other occurred to all of us," said the Signora.
"For instance, I have not seen some one for years,
and I think of that person, or see some one so like,
that it reminds me, and then directly after we meet.
The day I saw you, dear child," she said to Violet,
"I beheld in the morning a peasant girl, who resembled 
you, and I thought of you for hours. The
moment I ceased to think of you, I met you on the
Pincian Hill, with those people, you know."</p>

<p>"And I did not think of you at all, till we met,"

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

whispered Edgar; "and now I fancy I must have
been dreaming of you all my life. But certainly we
have met before in some other planet. Did it never
occur to you," he said to the Signora aloud, "to
fancy that you had done just the same thing before
as if in some previous period of existence?"</p>

<p>"It has often," she replied. "For instance, I
fancied just now that I had sat in this very place in
a story-telling group like this, and seen exactly such
a scene&mdash;those pines touched with gold, that boat on
the river, heard even the distant melody that just
now reached my ears. What made you, as it were,
divine my very thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Had you been a married couple," said the major,
"I'd have understood it in a moment; for I knew a
husband and wife that were constantly thinking the
same thing at the same moment, and it was sometimes
a race which would get the idea out first."</p>

<p>"And how many have you known that don't think
alike, more's the pity," asked Howard, "and haven't
an idea in common?"</p>

<p>"That's all mighty well," said the major, "but
you don't see exactly what I mane. Don't people
that live together and are devoted to each other get
even to look somewhat alike, to have the same expression, 
even if the features are different? I tell
you I've known them dhrame the same dhrame, and
that's something remarkable you'll own. Isn't that
affinity or sympathy, if you like?"</p>

<p>"Fancy, a Mr. Brown saying to his wife," cried
Howard, " 'My dear I dreamt last night we had roast

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

pork for dinner to-day,' and the lady replying, 'Dear
me! how odd, so did I.' What delightful harmony
might ensue."</p>

<p>"It is the result of harmony, not the cause, according 
to the major," observed Edgar. "These are
people evidently entitled to the Dunmow flitch."</p>

<p>This necessitated an explanation of the custom to
the Signora.</p>

<p>"I for one believe implicitly in dreams," she said;
"that is, not that they are reducible to rule, but that
certain dreams occasionally meet with a singular
realisation. Do not you?" she asked Edgar. The
latter for a moment did not answer. He was thinking 
of something else. "Ah!" she said, "Signer
Edgardo! Are you thinking of the next tale you
will tell us? Do you know I have a strong presentiment 
that I shall find it very interesting indeed."</p>

<p>Edgar stammered an apology. "Indeed," he said,
"I am very rude. I must plead a momentary absence
of mind. I was thinking of a very remarkable
dream."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall tell it to us as a forfeit," replied
the Signora, gaily; but a strange and unaccountable 
shudder at the moment caused her heart to
flutter, and she grew pale. "Give me half a wine-glassful 
of Orvieto," she said; "I felt quite a sudden
chill."</p>

<p>"And yet how hot it is," said Sir Robert. "There
is absolutely not a breath of air."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Lessingham," said Howard, "have
it over at once. Tell your story. You can't get off.

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

If you don't I promise you no mercy, and the ladies
will roast you to death."</p>

<p>Mr. Lessingham at length complied. We shall
omit his story as we did Edgar Leslie's. It was somewhat 
sentimental and very lengthy. During the narration 
we are bound to confess that both Violet and
Edgar were guilty of a little rudeness happily unnoticed 
by the narrator, as they continued ever and
anon to exchange a few words <i>sotto voce</i>, as much as
possible behind the young lady's fan.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Violet whispered, when the tale was
ended, "that he should have made himself the hero
of that singular, but, I must say, altogether very silly
story."</p>

<p>"Dear matter-of-fact girl!" said Edgar. "Considering 
that I am booked to tell another silly tale, I
wish you would not be so critical."</p>

<p>"Dear romantic youth!" said Violet. "Considering 
that you may tell anything you like, if you don't
tell us of your love for some wicked creature who
jilted you, or your love for any one at all, for that
matter."</p>

<p>Our readers will perceive from the above the terms
on which these young persons were.</p>

<p>The Signora cast a fond and approving eye on
this fair couple. She had divined the sterling worth
and great talent of Edgar, and she loved "dear little
Violet," as she still called her, as if she had been her
own daughter. In beauty, Violet afforded a brilliant
contrast to the Signora's style&mdash;in fact, she was an
excellent "foil," as ill-natured persons remarked. No
one, indeed, save a lover, could compare the fair, fresh,

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

English loveliness of Violet with the transcendent
and statuesque beauty of La Stellini. It was a
blue-eyed Hebe flitting round a Juno encircled with
the cestus of Venus. But the Signora, conscious as
she was of her own wondrous attributes of face and
form, had none of the petitesses of coquetry. She
was as far above them as the ideal Genius of a nation.
You might as well have imagined "Britannia," or
"Columbia," or the tearful poetic incarnation of
"Erin," or "Italia," indulging in the minauderies of
a Parisian belle, as have connected the noble presence
of La Stellini with the follies of flirtation, or the
frivolities of vanity and wrong. In a word, she was
a noble-hearted woman, and had loved&mdash;she was an
artiste and a mother!</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, she was fond of trifling amusements, 
and some very grand and rigid folks would
have called her weak and silly sometimes. On the
present occasion she had got a fancy for story-telling.
Not unfrequently she would have a freak of cigarette-smoking 
in a little divan she fitted up in her own
place. This was highly improper and immoral in the
eyes of some ladies. Only fortunately, the men all
understood her ways, much better than did the plainer
and less gifted portion of her own sex.</p>

<p>"We must positively have a real love-tale now,"
she said. "A truce to the supernatural for a time.
You, Mr. Leslie, you know, are to tell a story for
me, to close this first day of our Decameron."</p>

<p>"And for me too," said Violet.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Edgar, "the major shall be your
proxy, your major-domo of the Grand Hotel of

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

Fiction, which we have reared here by the river-side."</p>

<p>"Ah, now," said the major, "sure, if you want a
love-story, you've got the wrong pig by the ear."</p>

<p>This avowal was received in the manner that it
merited.</p>

<p>"The major shall tell his own love-story," said the
queen of the day.</p>

<p>"It's a moral impossibility," protested the major.</p>

<p>"I trust it will be moral, at any rate," observed
Howard.</p>

<p>"There is no appeal," said the Signora. "Continue, 
Signor Maggiore, if you please, and Mr. Leslie
shall commence when you have done."</p>

<p>The major made a droll grimace of acquiescence.
"What will I tell them?" he asked Edgar.</p>

<p>"How should I know," said that gentleman.
"Surely you know some Irish tale or other. It
needn't be original you know," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh! if it needn't be original&mdash;&mdash;" said O'Reilly
aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it must, it must."</p>

<p>"Here goes then," said the major, and began as
follows: "I once knew three sisters, milliners, in
Holies-street, Cavendish-square, and mighty purty
girls they were&mdash;&mdash; Arrah! What are ye doing?"
(to Edgar). "Is it pulling the skirt off me coat, ye
are?"</p>

<p>"That story won't do," said Edgar, who it appears
knew what was coming, and who was divided between
laughter and annoyance on Violet's account.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

<p>"Sure, there's no harm in it at all," said the
major.</p>

<p>"No! no! of course not; but I know it won't
amuse the ladies," said Edgar.</p>

<p>"As you plase, Mr. Leslie. I'm thinking you're
mighty particular. But sure I've just thought of a
real sentimental romance of my younger days. It
wasn't a milliner at all" (to Edgar), "but a real lady,
an admiral's daughter."</p>

<p>So the major told his second tale, which restored
the animation of the party, which had somewhat
flagged during the previous narration.</p>

<p>"It is your turn, now," said the Signora, addressing
a young artist, who had been chiefly employed in
making one or two very happy sketches of the three
or four groups seated around, which were duly looked
at and commended. "Come, try if you can tell us
something as laughable and amusing as the major's.
Commence your story, Signor Deveral, we are all
attention." Thus commanded, the young artist began
as follows:</p>

<p>"My friend Augustus Saunter was a very promising 
artist indeed. So every one said, who knew
him; from his Aunt Snell, to whom he had so often
pledged his word to reform his mode of living, down
to his colourman and washerwoman, in short the
whole circle of his acquaintance. Like the generality
of promising artists, Gus Saunter found his way to
Rome, in order to 'study art in its glorious cradle
and home.' At least, that is the account which he
gave of it; and so impressed was his Aunt Snell with
the reality of his intention and the general propriety

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

of the plan, that she actually allowed him his travelling 
expenses and a hundred and fifty pounds a
year during his sojourn. Once arrived and domiciled
there, Gus Saunter fell into the habits of the place so
completely, that he became quite a Roman, and did as
the Romans (that is, the artistic Germans and Britons
there) do. He wore a romantic costume, consisting
of a sort of black sombrero, and a loose black velvet
tunic, together with a wonderfully fine beard. He
drew and painted Grazia, the celebrated female model,
as often as most of his fellow students, and the dirty
old mountain bag-piper, who sat at the foot of the
Piazza di Spagna, raised a little fortune in sums of
two pauls from his hands. When he entered the
celebrated Caff&eacute; of the Fine Arts, the dwarf waiter
Pietro would shout, in the deep bass of his stentorian
voice, 'Ecco il Signor Augusto Inglese! Un mezzo-caldo 
subito, subito, poco aqua, molto zucchero, moltissimo 
rh'-um-m'-m-e!' In the morning, when not
idling or love-making, he would paint from the
Grazias and Terribiles, and other celebrated models of
modern Rome in that day. Every night Gus played
at billiards with his fellow-students, for baiocchi,
like a noble Roman as he was. He constantly
smoked a short pipe; indeed, he smoked eating,
drinking, painting, and sometimes sleeping, for he
went to bed with the everlasting pipe in his mouth.
As his friend Bob Hobson said, if he had only
had wings, he would have smoked flying. If this
magnificent idleness did not lead to artistic greatness, 
what in the name of all the rubbish ever
talked about the old masters and the trunks of mutilated 

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

statues by twaddling dilettanti, ever could or
should? Besides, Gus, as we have hinted, did occasionally 
work, and work hard. You should have
seen one picture, which he sent to his aunt, as a
Christmas gift. It was painted all over a canvas
twelve feet by eight. Poor Aunt Snell, she had no
room in her house in Kentish Town large enough in
which to hang it, even without a frame. Besides,
when it was unpacked in her small front garden, she
nearly fainted at the sight. Gus had quite forgotten
that his aunt had not overcome the narrow prejudices
of the British bourgeoise of the old school, and had
never been abroad in her life, nor even visited the
National Gallery, or any of the collections of our
nobility. So he sent her his first 'great' work, which
represented a Bacchic group surrounding a sleeping
Nymph. Gus went for 'colour, sir, colour,' as he
said; and the contest between the Red Indian hue of
the principal male figure, who was in the full dress&mdash;or 
its equivalent&mdash;of an African king, and the flesh
tint of the nymphs and cupids, however artistic,
did not satisfy the maiden notions of propriety of
his worthy aunt. 'Take it away!' she cried, at
first. 'Take it to Moses and Son! Take it anywhere, 
only take it away!' She at length allowed
it to be placed in her passage&mdash;after locking her
two maid-servants in the kitchen&mdash;with its face to
the wall, and finally contracted for its admission
into the Pantheon with a reserved price. In truth,
she was as much shocked as if she had suddenly
come upon a group of Kentish (not Kentish Town)
hop-pickers, disporting themselves 'in cuerpo.' It

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

was some time before she listened to reason, and was
reconciled to her nephew in the belief that he at
least did not intend an outrage in place of an attention 
and a compliment. Amongst other things Gus
Saunter was of a romantic temperament, and he fell
violently in love with a lovely girl of high descent,
but mean parentage, at Rome. When I say high
descent, I do not mean to trace her to the C&aelig;sars,
but that she lived on a fifth floor in a narrow but
lofty street. Nanina Giunicelli, possibly a real descendant 
of the celebrated poet of that name, was in
reality a loving and artless girl. Her manners were
primitive; but she had the 'gentle heart' sung in the
exquisite canzone of her namesake:*</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,<br/>

As birds within the green shade of the grove;<br/>

Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme<br/>

Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.</p>

[*GUIDO GIUNICELLI. See the admirable translation, by D. G. Rossetti, 
of the canzone "Of the Gentle Heart."</p>

<p>The sun strikes full upon the mud all day;<br/>

It remains vile, nor the sun's worth is less,<br/>

"By race, I am gentle," the proud man doth say;<br/>

He is the mud, the sun is gentleness.<br/>

Let no man predicate<br/>

That ought the name of gentleness should have<br/>

Even in a king's estate,<br/>

Except the heart there be a gentle man's.<br/>

The star-beam lights the wave,&mdash;<br/>

Heaven hold the star, and the star's radiance.</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Early Italian Poets</i>, p. 25.]</p>

</div>

<p>"Well, somehow love stole into the gentle heart
of Nanina, and its object was the blonde, handsome,
and really kindly and generous, though scatter-brained 
English student. What would his aunt have
said, had she lived to know the catastrophe? The

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

thoughtless Augustus, after becoming a Roman
Catholic, went through the ceremony of marriage,
with a tailor's daughter at Rome. When we say a
tailor, we mean a veritable 'snip,' not a gorgeous
phaeton-driving, 'hands' employing, whisker-cultivating, 
dashing Sartor of Bond-street, who is in
reality no more a tailor than my Lord Tipton and
Wednesbury is a coal, coke, and potato merchant,
though he sells those things wholesale. And a
happy life, whilst it lasted, these young people led.
Gus fancied himself a sort of Titian when he painted
from the beautiful creature who 'halved his joys,
doubled his sorrows, and trebled his expenses.' No,
the truth is she did not treble his expenses. One
pays dear for models, and Gus gave up drinking
and billiards, and began to paint in earnest. I said,
'whilst it lasted.' For all I know, it lasts now, and
will last to the sweet end. When I last saw Nanina,
about two years ago, she was almost as beautiful as
ever, but matronly instead of being slender, and Gus
was the papa of three lovely little girls. His dear
old auntie had left him a small independence, and I
have never known a happier man. There are various
views of happiness in this world. I have sometimes
thought I should have liked to have married a South
Sea Island princess of some coral Capua of pristine
innocence myself. I knew a man who passed three
years in a sort of dream of perfect felicity, paddling
in a light canoe over the lakes and water-courses
of British North America, towards the Far West,
attended by 'one sweet spirit for his minister,' in
the form of a Red Indian girl. His chief regret was

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

the abandonment of that prolonged bridal tour in the
wilderness. He shot and fished, and she cooked for
him, and stitched and embroidered his hunter's garb.</p>

<p>"Well, there was one cloud over the early domestic
bliss of my friend Augustus&mdash;one skeleton in his
artistic cupboard, or closet. Nanina, before their
young family was born, was subject to frantic fits of
jealousy, notwithstanding her gentle heart. She
could not bear her painter husband to visit any of his
fair country-women in Rome. Possibly she feared
that some day he would basely desert her and return
to England, which to her was always a sort of dim
and mist-shrouded Ultima Thule, and the very mention
of which she dreaded. It so happened that an English
family came to Rome, and took up a great deal more
of her husband's time than she approved of, seeing
that there was a fair young English cousin in the
case, whom he escorted to see the 'lions.' As my
friend did not care to publish his marriage during
his aunt's life, poor Nanina was not one of the party
on these occasions. Like a true Italian, when once
her jealousy was aroused, it amounted to a species of
black delirium and ungovernable frenzy. Her nature
was entirely changed. All her time was spent in
watching her husband. Everything which she saw
unfortunately seemed to confirm her suspicions. One
day, a week or so before the English family was
about to leave Rome, she followed the unsuspecting
Gus to a sort of out-door Hippodrome, popular
among the trifling, and in some respects childish
Romans. There she saw him conversing with the
utmost warmth with his fair-haired cousin. He was

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

alone with her. On their road back, they paused in
their animated dialogue, and he kissed her hand!
That day Nanina saw nothing any more, save shapes
of fire and blood. She had no longer any doubt. He
was deceiving her, and she resolved on his death.
The fact is, that poor Gus had just made a confidante 
of his little cousin, and actually acknowledged
the kindly interest which she expressed in his marriage 
in the manner which I have related. She had
promised to visit Nanina, and to stand his friend
with his Aunt Snell, if cause should arise. She was
not a daughter of the old lady, who, indeed, was a
maiden lady of advanced age. That evening Gus
went to the Opera, still with his cousin. You are not
to suppose that he did not make any excuses about
this constant attendance on her. When he returned,
Nanina received him with caresses, though he might
have noticed that she avoided kissing his lips. He
did not notice anything&mdash;not even her wild manner
and dissonant laugh. He was thinking of the pleasure
he had in store for her the next day&mdash;the introduction 
to his cousin Rosy, and how all her little
jealousies would be dispersed in air. So innocent
was he, that he had rather fostered and amused himself 
with these 'little jealousies' than not.</p>

<p>" 'So you've got supper for me, carina!' he said.
'What a darling little treasure of a wife!' The supper 
was excellent. He complained, however, a little
of the flavour of the soup, to which she answered
that there was too much salt, and gave him another
spoonful of powdered Parmesan over it. As, however, 
the meal proceeded, he noticed that she ate

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

nothing, and at length observed the wildness of her
demeanour, and the livid hue of her face. Her clear
olive complexion was nearly black. Suddenly she
rose, and the storm burst forth.</p>

<p>" 'Listen!' she screamed. 'Traitor! thou hast deceived 
me, and I am avenged. I have&mdash;poisoned&mdash;thee, 
scelerato!&mdash;with these hands!' And she
then burst out raving about him kissing his cousin's
hand. 'But, wretch! villain! traditore! as thou art,'
she exclaimed, 'I shall not survive thee to undergo
the punishment of a murderess. Look!' and she
snatched up a knife from the table, and would certainly 
have plunged it into her bosom, had not Gus
wrenched it from her hand. Then she fainted, and
he laid her on the floor.</p>

<p>" 'Poisoned! yes, there can be no doubt. There
is no trick; no child's play of deception here.' Poor
Gus staggered to the wall. 'To die thus!' he murmured, 
'and through a cursed mistake. Unhappy?
miserable, but beloved girl&mdash;what! what have you
done?' 'I was always a man of quick decision,' said
Gus, in telling me the story. 'I determined to try
and save my life. An emetic was the thing. There
was no apothecary at hand. There was a salad on the
table in a huge bowl. In a moment I emptied into it
the remaining contents of three or four foul pipes. I
broke up and mixed in it a half-smoked cigar, one of
Prince Polonia's best, at five baiocchi. I added
the oil of a cresset-lamp, the remainder of a dish
of tomatoes, salt, vinegar, half a bottle of Orvieto,
some English gin, French mustard, &amp;c. &amp;c., and,
without hesitation, and with surprising firmness of

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

will, hastily swallowed, but a plusieurs reprises, the
disgusting mess. What followed I need hardly repeat.
Enough that I was poisoned, and it was a matter of
life and death. I staggered ere long to a sofa. The
room swam round, cold dews of agony burst forth,
my heart fluttered and stopped, and I fainted in
turn. When I came to myself, Nanina was kneeling
by me, her face buried on my chest, and her long
black tresses tangled by the night wind&mdash;for I had
opened the window with a vague idea of calling for
assistance at first&mdash;and sweeping down to the floor.
She had fairly wept herself down to a few occasional
broken sobs, like a child. I asked her why she had
done such a thing to me whom she loved. I pass over
her explanations and bitter repentance. At length,
in a faint voice, I inquired what poison she had
administered. It was a natural question you will
admit.'</p>

<p>" 'The poison, the deadly English poison, which
you gave me,' she said.</p>

<p>" '<i>I</i> gave you? I never gave you anything of the
kind!'</p>

<p>" 'Don't you remember,' she said, 'when you
were once looking over the contents of your desk,
before our marriage&mdash;destroying your English love-letters&mdash;I 
saw a small packet, and asked you what
it was? "Poison," you replied, "poison of the
deadliest kind, made by a terrible English witch."
"Why keep it?" I asked. "To end my days,"
you answered, "when the illusions of life have
fled&mdash;if I fail to become a great painter, if my
aunt sends me no more money, and, above all, if I

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

fail to win your love." I concealed the fatal packet,
and kept it, and you never asked for it, because you
have needed it not. And now I have destroyed you
with it. Forgive me with your dying breath; for I
swear to survive you not. See, I will take the rest.'
And she took a small blue packet from her bosom.
It was labelled 'Epsom Salts!'</p>

<p>" 'I always had a tendency to romance,' observed
Gus, 'and had certainly spun her that yarn, every
word of which she implicitly believed. I had to send
a note to my cousin the next morning to come and
see us without my escort; for I did not recover from
the effects of the antidote for several days, if not
weeks. It entirely cured my little Nanina of jealousy. 
That was one good thing.' "</p>

<p>"Now," said the Signora once more, "let us have
your story, the last, Signer Edgardo; the one, you
know, you are to tell for me by proxy. We must think
of returning to the city ere long, or we shall not
arrive at the Palazzetto ere sun-down."</p>

<p>"I feel unusually dull," observed Edgar&mdash;"that
is, if it is anything unusual with me&mdash;and by no
means in story-telling trim; but I will relate to you,
if you please, as well as I can, some singular circumstances 
told me by an acquaintance whom I met
casually about a year ago in London, concerning a
pleasure vessel&mdash;a yacht, as we English call it&mdash;Signora, 
which belonged to the narrator; and as it
is a tale of romantic sympathies and attractions, and
that kind of thing, I expect to be unmercifully quizzed.
The person who told it to me was a reduced gentleman, 
very badly off indeed. I met him when he

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

was trying to pick up a few shillings occasionally on
the Press, at a sort of journalistic haunt into which I
had strayed to find an extra reporter or two for our
paper for a special purpose. He was evidently a
man who had seen better days; but dreadfully thin,
seedy, and poor. I met him several times, and then
lost sight of him, as I shall relate to you; but on one
occasion, over a few glasses of grog, he got very communicative, 
and told me the disjointed story which I
shall endeavour to narrate."</p>

<p>"I remember meeting just such a character," observed 
Lessingham, "at a similar place. He was
miserably poor, but a perfect gentleman in his manners 
and conversation."</p>

<p>"According to his own account, and I saw no
reason to doubt it," proceeded Edgar, "this almost
squalid litt&eacute;rateur had once been a man of fortune.
He told me nothing about his domestic affairs&mdash;nothing 
that could give me a clue to his previous
history&mdash;but it appeared that he had been very well
off some time or other, and amongst other things
been the owner of a brigantine yacht."</p>

<p>At the word "brigantine," an acute observer might
have noticed an unusual interest and excitement in
the Signora. She began to pull some flowers to
pieces rapidly but mechanically, and said:</p>

<p>"Did you not know his name?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say for certain that I did," replied
Edgar. "I found out afterwards that he went by
the name of Williams in the Bohemian circle in
which he moved; but I felt assured that was not his

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

real appellation. The way in which the conversation
to which I refer came about was simply this. A talk
had arisen in the coffee-room of the house where I
met him about ships being lucky or unlucky, and
sailing on a Friday, and that sort of thing. Some
one quoted the line from Milton,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark;</p>

</div>

<p>and some one else declared it was all nonsense. I
believe all this was apropos of the <i>Great Eastern</i>,
when this person, who had been sitting bent over a
table with his head upon his arms, suddenly looked
up, and said that it was all quite true; that a vessel
might be fated from the stocks; he was certain of it&mdash;in 
fact, he had witnessed it. A friend of his had
been the owner of a splendid yacht (here there was a
slight Bohemian laugh at the notion of any friend
of his being in a position to have a vessel of the
kind). He gave them, however, a brief outline of
the facts, and a very remarkable dream that accompanied 
the loss of the vessel; and at my particular
request he afterwards filled up some parts of the
story, which I will now endeavour to narrate to you
again."</p>

<p>Had any one noticed the Signora during the last
part of Edgar's explanation how he heard the story,
he would have been struck by her agitation. When
the dream was alluded to, she turned deadly pale, and
placed one hand on the ground as if to support herself 
from falling forward from the cushion on which
she sat. Apparently recovering herself by a strong

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

effort, she merely let her veil fall as if to shut out the
glare of the sun, and turned her head slightly away
from the party.</p>

<p>"In the first place," continued Edgar, "the vessel
in question was constructed on the lines of a celebrated 
pirate and slaver, ordered to be broken up by
the government, and taken surreptitiously by some
one who had access to the dockyard. She was built
by Messrs. G., the well-known firm at Blackwall, for
a gentleman who died on the very day she was
launched. He was a wealthy solicitor just retired
from practice."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" cried the major, "what a beginning! 
Built for a solicitor on the lines of a pirate!
and him&mdash;the lawyer, I mane&mdash;gone to blazes the
day she was launched! Did they make her rudder
out of a gibbet&mdash;tell me, now&mdash;and carve her figure-head 
in the likeness of ould Scratch?"</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Edgar, "it appeared that the
lawyer died without a will, and Messrs. G. offered
the vessel for sale on behalf of the heirs. She was a
beautiful craft of some two hundred and fifty tons,
with deck port-holes for fourteen guns, but actually
carrying only six long brass six-pounders. My acquaintance&mdash;for 
I afterwards found out the astonishing 
fact that my coffee-house acquaintance had been
himself the owner&mdash;was dining at Blackwall one day,
when he was induced to look at her, and it led to his
purchasing her a few days after. This broken-down
gentleman had once been the possessor of a considerable 
fortune&mdash;enough to enable him to purchase a
vessel of such dimensions, and to entertain princes

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

and ambassadors on board. I must tell you that he
was then informed that the vessel was built for a
gentleman who had died; but did not know that the
event took place on the very day, if not hour, of her
launch. He also had heard from a kind of show
Long Tom Coffin style of sailor put on board as ship-keeper, 
that there had been a lady concerned&mdash;in
fact, that the man of law had been led to this and
other extravagances by a fair Dalilah who had a sea-going 
fancy (possibly, she was in love with the third
mate of a merchantman), and that all her hopes and
machinations had been disappointed by the sudden
demise of her legal protector without a will&mdash;or, at
least, the discovery of one&mdash;for, as the next heir was
also a lawyer, there is no saying what complex
villainy had been at work."</p>

<p>"You seem to have a pretty idea of the profession,
sir," observed Sir Robert Warkworth.</p>

<p>"I have seen something of it," replied Edgar,
sadly. "The vessel," he continued, "showed evident 
tokens that she was intended for a fair occupant.
There was a piano, and even a work-table, and certain
gorgeous blue satin coverings and decorations utterly
unfit for sea. She was named after an estate lately
purchased by her defunct proprietor, the <i>Ravenshaw</i>.
My informant had been, it appeared, to see her on the
day that the purchase was completed, in company with
the friend who first found her out in the docks. On
their way back they got into a steam-boat at London-bridge 
to return to the West-end. There were
scarcely any passengers on board, for the day was
dull and cold. There was, however, a fashionably-dressed 

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

female sitting on deck forward, apparently
immersed in the pages of a novel. The friend accompanying 
the new yacht owner was a gay and
facetious man. He stole behind the lady, and peeped
over her shoulder to see what she was reading.</p>

<p>" 'Guy Ravenshaw,' he exclaimed. 'Hallo, I
say,' (addressing Williams), 'why, that's the name
of your yacht.'</p>

<p>" 'What's that you say, sir?' said the woman,
almost fiercely, shutting the book and rising. 'There's
only one vessel of that name, I'm sure, and that is
one too many.'</p>

<p>" 'I tell you, my dear lady,' said Philip Askew,
for such, if I remember, was his name, 'that the
<i>Ravenshaw</i> is the name of my friend's new yacht.
Allow me to introduce him:&mdash;Lord Sealegs, Miss
Clementina Flouncer, of the Iron Citizen Company's
steam yacht <i>Bridegroom</i>.' What further nonsense
he might have uttered was cut short by the person
whom he addressed.</p>

<p>" 'It's a lie,' she said, stamping her foot, 'and you
are a couple of impertinent snobs.'</p>

<p>" 'Really,' said Williams, gently, 'I don't know
what I've done to deserve such an insult. I am
sorry my friend has annoyed you with his nonsense;
but what he said was quite true so far as the vessel
is concerned, for I bought a craft called the <i>Ravenshaw</i> 
this morning, and it certainly is very odd you
should be reading a book of that title, which I hope
will plead an excuse for his intruding on your privacy.'</p>

<p>"And he bowed and turned away. As for Askew,
to use his own expressive language, he was completely

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

'shut up' by the lady's violence. He affected a
comic fear.</p>

<p>" 'Did you ever see such a Jezebel?' he said;
'she's a perfect lucifer-match in petticoats. I don't
feel safe on the same side of the funnel.'</p>

<p>"It was the lady's turn now to take the initiative.
Following Williams aft, she asked him to excuse her
incivility.</p>

<p>" 'You don't know,' she said, 'what cause I have
to be thus excited. Is it really true that you have
bought the <i>Ravenshaw?</i> It is not likely that there
are two vessels of that name. She lies, or did lie,
in the East India Dock at Blackwall."</p>

<p>" 'Exactly, she is there now,' he replied; 'we
have just left her.'</p>

<P>" 'A large vessel,' she said&mdash;'I mean, large for a
yacht&mdash;with a piano and guns on board, and a ladies'
cabin with blue satin furniture?'</p>

<p>"Williams signified his assent, and in the vanity
of new ownership of such a magnificent acquisition,
took some papers out of his pocket and showed them
to her in corroboration.</p>

<p>" 'That vessel was built for me; the piano is mine,'
she said. 'Do you know to whom she belonged? It
was Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the solicitor, in Lincoln's-inn-fields.
We were engaged to be married. His scoundrel
cousin destroyed the will.'</p>

<p>"Here she uttered some very unfeminine maledictions 
on that gentleman's spiritual and corporeal
appurts.</p>

<p>" 'And now,' she said, 'I am ruined, left a beggar,
penniless. I have not even my own house of furniture, 

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

which belonged to me before I knew him.
And you are the owner of that vessel. I tell you,
you have no right to it. It is mine; and I have
been robbed; basely plundered, I say. But I warn
you that you will have no luck with it, for all your
money and your bounce. I tell you that vessel
is doomed and accursed. Do you know that my
Charlie&mdash;my husband that was to be only a week
after&mdash;one week, I say&mdash;died in my arms the very
hour she was launched? Listen,' she said, 'you are
a civil-spoken fellow enough. As for that fellow
there,' pointing to Askew, 'if it was his&mdash;but he's
only some sponging vagabond, I suppose, who has
got the length of your foot&mdash;I would not say a word
to save him from grief. But you are not a bad sort.
Take my advice, and get rid of that vessel as soon
as you can, and don't ever sail in her, if you value
your life. She is unlucky and accursed. God knows,
I have cursed her enough, for it was the bother
about her and a cold caught in the docks when fitting
her out, that killed him, and she'll come to a bad end.
That's all I have to say.'</p>

<p>"And with these words, the steamer having just
stopped at the Temple Pier, the lady saluted Williams
and walked off, to the great relief of Mr. Philip
Askew, gentleman at large, late of the Queen's
Bench, who expected nothing less than to have his
manly beauty impaired by a sudden feline impulse
on that amiable creature's part. As for Williams, he
thought that the rencontre and the title of the novel
involved a strange coincidence, but soon dismissed it
from his mind.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

<p>"It is not my intention to tell you the whole extraordinary 
history which he imparted to me of his
adventures in that vessel, whose purchase and possession 
were inaugurated in so ominous a way. How,
of his three sailing masters, the first robbed him;
the second deceived him, though bound by every tie
of gratitude, by determining, at whatever cost, never
to quit England, where he had formed a disgraceful
attachment; and the third turned out a drunken,
unqualified scamp, who lost all command over the
crew by smuggling; and, finally, through his profligate 
neglect of duty suffered the vessel to be run
on shore. The hairbreadth escapes of Williams from
fire, shipwreck, assassination, and even marooning
on a rocky island, would fill a volume, but somehow
he did always manage just to escape. On three
separate occasions his life was saved by distinct and
most remarkable presentiments of evil. I will mention 
two of these, which occur to me. At Plymouth
he had gone on shore one evening with some friends.
The vessel was moored in the Hamoaze close to the
guard-ship. The lazy sailing-master had neglected
to deposit the powder, of which there was a large
quantity, together with fireworks, on board, as he was
bound to do, at Drake's Island, a regulation of which
Williams was entirely ignorant. About nine o'clock
that night he felt a great desire to go on board. It
was blowing half a gale of wind, and his companions
endeavoured in vain to dissuade him. No one offering
to accompany him, he went off alone, and after a
hard pull got put on board, and entering the main
cabin, or saloon, flung himself down on the cushions

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

and fell fast asleep. He was awakened by a crash
of glass. He thought that the watch on deck had
broken the glass of the skylight, and hailed him,
but got no answer, and fell asleep again. He was
awakened by a second crash. This time he was fairly
aroused, and opening the door aft perceived a dense
cloud of smoke. The sleeping berths were aft of
the main saloon, and beyond that was a sumptuous
ladies' cabin, with mirrors and a small brass stove.
Beyond that was the sail cabin. The crew all slept
forward. On opening a second door he was met by
a burst of flame. The vessel was on fire. He quickly
roused the hands, and the fire was with difficulty put
out. That morning he had overhauled the stock of
powder and fireworks, and not having finished his
examination, it was crammed in a hurry into an
empty sleeping berth next to the ladies' cabin, where
the steward had put some linen to air round the little
brass stove. The motion of the vessel had upset
this. When the damage was surveyed next day, it
was found that the bulk-head between the fire and
the powder was charred within half an inch. Had
Williams remained on shore, had he not awakened
when he did&mdash;nay, had he not acted with promptitude
and self-possession, not only would the vessel have
been blown out of the water, but the flag-ship, and
perhaps many others, would have been in all probability 
burnt and destroyed. Nor could he in the least
explain by what mysterious impulse he was induced
to go on board that night.</p>

<p>"On another occasion, the vessel was anchored off
the Hy&egrave;res, waiting to go into Brest the next day.

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

It was blowing scarcely a capful of wind, and all was
made snug. But Williams alone could not rest in
his berth. He had a strange idea when he woke that
there was a kind of grating or scraping under the
ship's bottom. He went on deck and talked to the
watch. The man laughed at the notion of anything
being wrong. Williams turned in again and again,
but could not rest. He was in a state of nervous
excitement. As he said, all the events of his life
crowded upon his brain. At last, he awoke the sailing-master, 
who was not over-pleased at being disturbed. 
He, too, laughed at the idea of anything
being wrong.</p>

<p>" 'There's no wind of any account,' he said, 'and
the ground tackle of this vessel would hold a ship of
nine hundred tons. It's as good an anchorage as any
in the world.'</p>

<p>"Again Williams went on deck, again he turned
in, and couldn't rest. So he went a second time to
the captain's berth, and told him to tumble up and
come on deck.</p>

<p>" 'I'm certain there's something wrong,' he said.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he would have been flattered, if
he had heard the remarks made by that surly mariner
on the occasion of his night's rest being disturbed.
He, however, obeyed his owner's and registered captain's 
orders, and stumbled and grumbled leisurely on
deck, where William stood gazing over the dark
expanse of sea. The master looked professionally
aloft, asked the watch some nautical commonplace
question, and approached Williams whilst fumbling
for his pipe.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

<p>" 'I don't think there's much harm, sir,' he said.</p>

<p>" 'Look!' said the other; 'what is that long
white line yonder astern, that gleams like phosphoric
light?'</p>

<p>" 'Lord have mercy!' exclaimed the captain, dashing 
his pipe down and rushing to the after-hatch.
'All hands on deck! Tumble up! The ship will be
ashore in ten minutes.' And he seized his speaking-trumpet. 
'Now, then, up with the anchor, all able-bodied 
hands! Look alive! There's not a moment
to lose. We're dragging the anchor,' he said to
Williams in passing him. 'Look alive, all of you!'
But the anchor resisted their utmost efforts. 'Bring
a cold-chisel, carpenter. Here! you Davis, fetch an
empty keg.' In five minutes the keg was attached
by a long line to a link of the cable, which was cut,
leaving the vessel free. All hands were then sent
aloft. 'Shake out every rag of her!' cried the captain, 
'She'll bear it. Now then, round with her.'
After a, couple of tacks he laughed and looked silly.
'We're right enough now, sir,' he said, touching his
hat respectfully; 'but, by the Lord Harry, if it
hadn't been for your wakefulness, the ship would
have been lost.'</p>

<p>"The next day the French authorities sent out a
lumper to pick up the abandoned anchor. They found
it no easy job. One of the flukes had caught in the
fluke of an immense old barnacle-covered and generally 
marine-incrusted anchor of an unknown and
ancient pattern, which is to be seen at this day in the
dockyard at Brest. For the authorities politely offered

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

to make no charge for the recovery of the yacht's
anchor, if the owner would agree to their retention of
the one it had been the means of fishing up&mdash;a
request which he had certainly neither the power nor
the inclination to decline."</p>

<p>"Decidedly it would appear that this inspired
Williams was not doomed to be drowned," observed
Lessingham.</p>

<p>"I hope he has not met with a worse fate," was
Edgar's remark.</p>

<p>All this time the Signora kept silent, with heaving
bosom and averted face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Williams told me," continued Edgar, "that
after a cruise of some two years, he left the vessel at
Marseilles, and returned to London vi&acirc; France, being
summoned by important business. I forget what it
was. Probably some highly respectable attorney had
bolted with all his client's money, or some trifle of
that kind. He told his captain to proceed at once to
Southampton; but for long heard nothing of him or
the vessel, and got seriously alarmed. At length he
received a letter from Plymouth from the master,
saying he had been forced to put into Vigo Bay
through foul weather, and had again met with a gale
and sprung the main boom, which caused him to put
into Plymouth contrary to orders, which were to
touch at Southampton. The vessel was at her old
anchorage, he said, off Drake's Island (the place
whence she started just two years before on her
cruise). Williams was glad to get this news. As he
was perusing the letter in bed, his servant came in.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

<p>" 'A shabby, short little man," he said, 'wants to
see you, sir, very particular; he says his name is
Pottle, and that he was once on board your yacht.'</p>

<p>" 'How very odd,' observed Williams. 'Show
him in!'</p>

<p>"This Pottle was by profession a hairdresser and
barber. He was an intemperate, amusing little
cockney rascal, and Williams had taken a fancy to
him, it appeared, and taken him with him as valet.
He had sailed from the port of London, but suffered
so dreadfully <i>en route</i> to Plymouth from sea-sickness,
that a medical man there counselled Williams to send
him home, as he considered his life in danger. Pottle
had kept up his spirits all the cruise; but when he
heard he had to quit the vessel, he was convulsed
with grief, and had to be sent on shore almost forcibly.
Williams good-naturedly gave him a small sum to
set him up in business. He would always insist on
shaving his master at sea, ill as he was, and used to
poke his little pale, pasty, pea-green face up the
companion hatch now and then and say, 'Have we
passed any remarkable places, sir?' at which everybody 
laughed. Since then Williams had not seen
him, and did not know either where he was, or that
Pottle was acquainted with his address. On asking 
him why he came, he said he thought Mr.
Williams might want to be waited on, and that he
heard where he was from one of the servants whom
he met.</p>

<p>" 'Have you got any news yet of the yacht, sir?'
he said.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

<p>" 'Just got a letter this morning,' replied Williams.
'She is all right at the old place at Plymouth.'</p>

<p>"And he gave him the letter to read.</p>

<p>" 'God be thanked!' said the little man, in a very
earnest manner.</p>

<p>"But as he was always quaint, Williams paid no
particular attention to his remark. As, however, he
proceeded with his ministration, Williams observed
that his hand shook very much, and that he was
trembling and very nervous.</p>

<p>" 'So you've been at your old tricks again,' he
said; 'had a drop too much last night.'</p>

<p>" 'No, sir,' he replied, 'that I have not. I've taken
the pledge these three months.'</p>

<p>" 'What is the matter with you?'</p>

<p>" 'Nothing, sir, nothing,' was the answer; but in
a tone that meant something very plainly.</p>

<p>"After considerable inquiry and pressing, he said
it was about the yacht.</p>

<p>" 'About the yacht?' said Williams. 'What do
you mean?'</p>

<p>" 'Don't let her sail from Plymouth, pray don't!'
exclaimed the little man at last; 'for if you do, she'll
surely be lost.'</p>

<p>" 'You are drunk, sir, or mad,' cried Williams.</p>

<p>" 'If ever I was on board that vessel, sir, I was
last night,' replied Pottle.</p>

<p>"Williams was glad he had finished shaving him,
for he began now to think that he had in reality
parted with his senses. Pottle, however, proceeded
to tell him that he had gone to bed a little before

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

twelve the preceding night, and dreamt he was on
board the vessel and on deck. It was dusk, and he
thought there were only three persons besides himself. 
Suddenly it became dark as pitch, and the
vessel seemed to rush through sea and night as if
they were in a railway tunnel, as he expressed it.
Then there was a tremendous crash, and he fancied
he was thrown forward and fell on his knees. In
answer to the question whether that was all, he replied
that some one brought up the twelve loaded muskets
kept in a rack in the saloon and fired them. Then he
saw blue lights, such as they used to burn on board,
somewhere over their heads, and then he awoke.</p>

<p>" 'Well, what then?' asked Williams.</p>

<P>" 'I got up and opened the window and looked
out,' he replied, 'and I heard Big Ben strike two,
as the wind ceased to blow for a moment. I then
went to bed again, and fell asleep. I dreamt the
same dream again, only fainter like and more confused, 
and awoke a second time in a fright. I could
not lie down again, and the room seemed to go round
with me, and I felt sick. There,' he said, 'I have
just the same feeling now.'</p>

<p>" 'The fact is,' said Williams, 'pledge or no pledge,
you got very tipsy last night.'</p>

<p>" 'Upon my soul,' returned the little man, 'I
hadn't touched a drop of anything stronger than tea,
and, what's more, haven't these three months; unless
it has been a drop of peppermint-water now and
then.'</p>

<p>"In spite of his better reason, Williams could not
help being somewhat struck by what he had heard.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

<p>" 'Don't, sir, don't let the vessel go to Southampton,' 
reiterated Pottle; 'if you do, she will
certainly be lost.'</p>

<p>" 'Nonsense,' replied Williams.</p>

<p>"But the afternoon of that day, after telling the
anecdote to several persons, he actually wrote to the
captain at Plymouth instructing him not to sail, for
that he would come down there instead.</p>

<p>"The next day, however, he received intelligence
of the wreck of the yacht. The captain, who put
into Plymouth for his own purposes, went on shore,
after writing to his owner, the day that the vessel
arrived. The crew, being demoralised, followed his
example one by one till only three hands were left,
who had been shipped at Vigo. They had no acquaintances 
there. The vessel had but one anchor
out and thirty fathom of cable. It was a calm and
beautiful afternoon. At two o'clock the next morning 
a terrific gale blew from the south, and the vessel
dragged her anchor. The raw hands did not even
contrive to remove the stopper of the cable. So she
was blown in upon the rocks near the citadel, and
one of those on board fired the muskets, which were
answered by the coast-guard burning blue lights and
boarding the vessel. This was what Williams ascertained 
on going down."</p>

<p>"Was she a total wreck?" asked Sir Robert.</p>

<p>"No: she was completely gutted from stem to
stern, and you might have driven a cart and horse
through her bottom. But Williams had her patched
lip and brought round to London, where the Messrs.
G. refitted her; and Williams sold her finally to an

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

eminent Quaker firm to run as an opium clipper. She
made several voyages, he said. To the end, however,
she was unlucky, and to the end there was something
strange and weird-like connected with her fate."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Lessingham.</p>

<p>"One evening Williams had a party at his rooms,
and the conversation fell upon the vessel, and the
dream, and her constant run of ill luck, and the
narrow escapes he had when cruising with her, and
the fact that she never could go anywhere or do
anything right. If she started with the fairest
wind for any port, she was sure to be driven in
an opposite direction. Nothing connected with her
prospered.</p>

<p>" 'It's my firm belief,' said Williams, 'that I shall
hear some day or other that she is lost, and all on
board with her. I should not like to bet on such a
subject, or else I would offer odds.'</p>

<p>"The very next morning a newspaper came into
his hands, directed to him by chance; that is, it was
a copy of a new daily paper that lived a few days,
and was sent round to people whose names were in
the 'Court Guide.' The first thing he saw on opening 
it was the obituary, and the first name in it, upon
which his eye fell, was that of a young man, to which
the following brief and melancholy tale was appended:</p>

<p>" 'Supposed to have been on board of the &mdash;&mdash; (I
forget the name, but she was re-christened when
Williams bought her), which foundered in a typhoon
off the Pellew Islands, when all hands were lost.'</p>

<p>"Williams had great difficulty in persuading one

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

of his friends, whom he met that evening somewhere, 
and to whom he showed the newspaper, that
he had not already seen it or heard of it, when he so
distinctly prophesied the fate of the vessel the night
before."</p>

<p>"Very singular!" said Sir Robert&mdash;"very odd
indeed! Do you not think so?" he said, appealing
to the Signora. But that lady did not answer at the
moment. She was apparently deeply lost in thought.
"But who could that poor fellow Williams be?" pursued 
Sir Robert. "Let me see what brigantine yacht
was there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what became of him?" said Lessingham.
"That's what I'm anxious to know. Did you lose
sight of him altogether?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't be Aubrey, surely," half mused Sir
Robert, aloud; "the fellow, you know, who lost his
wife in that strange way. He had a large vessel I've
heard, and I think she was wrecked. He was an
awful cad, I believe."</p>

<p>Edgar shook his head.</p>

<p>"I gave the poor fellow a little work to do," he
said, "just a trifle&mdash;more copying than anything&mdash;and 
he brought it back regularly enough three or four
times. But the last time he didn't come any more;
and as I owed him rather more than usual, for it was
rather a heavy job, I feared the worst. I remembered
that at our last interview, he had complained of shivering 
and pains in the head. I found his lodging with
very great difficulty, through one of the queerest
creatures I ever saw, who spoke to him one night in
the bar of a public-house where we met. My worst

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

fears were realised. The poor squalid landlady told
me he had caught a fever and become delirious, and
utterly beyond her control. Indeed, she was afraid
he might hurt her children, of whom it appeared he
was usually excessively fond. One wet night he
rushed out into the streets and never returned. He
told the landlady that he was going to look for his
wife, though she had never seen nor heard of such a
person before. As I heard of a dead body being
found about that time that answered the description, 
I gave up the search, and&mdash;&mdash; But what on
earth is the matter?"</p>

<p>All looked round, and Violet screamed aloud. The
Signora had fallen back fainting on the grass.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Just a dozen, my lord."</p>

<p>"Sort them."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord." (Period of ten minutes.)</p>

<p>"Chivers!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Sorted them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Any duns?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

<p>"Seven, my lord."</p>

<p>"Burn 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Any women?"</p>

<p>"Only three this morning, my lord."</p>

<p>"Read 'em, and tell us who they are. No, not now.
They'll keep till after bweakfast. The weather is not
very hot. What's the mercury in the shade?"</p>

<p>"Sixty-eight, my lord!"</p>

<p>"Bet a sovereign, 'tisn't seventy? Any other letters, 
Chivers?"</p>

<p>"One from the marquis, your lordship's father, my
lord."</p>

<p>"Put it in the coat I shall wear to-day. The
bweast-pocket. I'll read it at the Fogey Club, if I
get there this afternoon. Anything else, Chivers?
Stop, seven and five is eleven, ain't it? By-the-bye,
got any money this morning?"</p>

<p>"Not a fiver in the house, my lord! We was
cleaned out yesterday at the pigeon match, and your
lordship finished up, if you recollect, at the 'Blue
Posts' with the Duke of Ipswich and Mr. Crawler."</p>

<p>"So I did, Chivers, and precious good fun we had,
I can tell you."</p>

<p>"I must go and get your lordship a new hat" (holds
up a crushed hat with a doll stuck in the ribbon
of it).</p>

<p>"All right, see if you can't get a tenner from old
Tidler."</p>

<p>The domestic shook his head. "It's no go, my
lord! You can have any amount of hats; but no
money."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

<p>"Then order twelve dozen, and sell 'em at two bob
each. But I say, Chivers, what's that other letter?"</p>

<p>"It's from Mr. Moss Lewis. He will see your
lordship at twelve in the City."</p>

<p>"Dash it! why didn't you say so before? Give
it me, quick." (Reads.) "A pony in cash. Fourteen 
dozen champagne. Confound his gooseberry!
Seventeen pictures by celebrated Dutch masters.
The unmerciful old sinner! Nine French clocks.
Hurray! we'll start 'em for a sweepstakes, and see
which will do the first quarter of an hour first. Here,
toss over my clothes. Look sharp, Chivers. Give me
some seltzer and brandy. And stop, Chivers!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Get me some cigars, a Hansom, and a stamp
for three hundred. You don't mean to say you haven't
enough 'pewter' for that! Then Lewis must stand
the paper; and it's what he don't like, I can tell you."
(Goes into next room, singing "Lord Tom Tidler is
my name, doing oblongs is my game. Toodle-dum,
toodle-dum, day!")</p>

<p>Chivers took out his money and counted it. "Three
fivers and three sovs.," he said, "is eighteen, and
nine and fourpence-hapenny, all saved from them
precious gals and swindling friends of hisn. And
they've offered him the governorship of New Zealand,
to get him out of the country. I don't think the
savages can teach him much. Why he nearly bit a
policeman's thumb off last Sunday night. We had to
find a little ready money then, and no mistake. But,
bless you, he's not to be had, knows a game worth
two of that. He could marry half a dozen hundred

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

thousand pounders to-morrow, if he'd a mind. We
must look out for a two hundred and fifty thousand
pounder, I reckon, to get him square. And she's to
be got. It's pretty nigh time to do it. I'm getting
tired of these games&mdash;it don't suit a man of forty, as
is of a serious turn of mind: and it don't pay half
so well as it did, that's another thing. He's a borrowing 
far too much money, to suit my book. 'Chivers,'
says I, yesterday, 'what are you doing of, Chivers?
you're going too fast to be safe.' No! we must keep
him a bit sober, and tie him up to a sack of money in
a female form. There's the markis, he says to me
very serious lately, 'Chivers,' says he, 'if you'll get
my son well married, I'll stand something handsome.'
And if I don't work the oracle with his creditors, a
buying up his paper, why I'm a precious babe in
arms, and I don't look much like one neither."</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Chivers looked at himself in his
lordship's glass, and arranged his lordship's aristocratic 
brushes on his lordship's marble dressing-table
for his lordship's honourable toilet. We shall now see
how Mr. Chivers kept his word.</p>

<p>Having now transported our readers back again
to London, we must reintroduce them to some old
acquaintances. The same crossing in front of St.
George's, Hanover-square, shall be the scene. There
has been a marriage there this morning, of course.
Lord Thomas Peckham Tidler, M.P., third son of the
Marquis of Hardupvery, to Miss Bettina Cruet, only
daughter of old Cruet, the senior partner of Cruet,
Platum, and Selloff, the great advertising cutlery,
electro-plate, and japanned goods dealers, whose great

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

philanthropical query of "why give any more?" is so
well-known, wherever there is an eligible dead wall or
opportunity for its publication. Lord Tidler's dishonoured 
cheques and bills were almost as plentiful as
the advertisements of his father-in-law; but he employed 
agents to buy them in, as soon as the marriage
was privately arranged. Lord Thomas Peckham
Tidler had two or three agents besides the accomplished 
Chivers&mdash;one a broken down old disreputable
captain of dubious antecedents&mdash;who were continually 
employed in changing his cheques; and his
lordship could not well be arrested, because he sat in
Parliament for one of his father's pocket-boroughs,
a thing very snugly managed by the family solicitors, 
and he always bolted off salmon-fishing in
Norway, or yachting in the Mediterranean, or somewhere 
on the Continent, or to America, just before
the House broke up. As for his furniture, he had
executed a bill of sale of that to his body servant,
the aforesaid Mr. Chivers, who sometimes did a little
business in money-lending himself, whilst his master
borrowed. We do not mean to say that he lent much
money to his master. The rogue knew better than
that. He had no wages, save perquisites. He sold
the wines and cigars which his master got on tick,
and they divided the plunder. He would pay a cab
occasionally for his lordship, and sometimes got him
out of any petty monetary' scrape, such as affected
his "honour" in a peculiarly delicate manner. In
return, he now and then might have made his master
jealous, had the latter been of a suspicious or observant 
turn of mind. But he was such a pleasant,

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

reckless gentleman, was Lord Thomas Peckham
Tidler. Sentiment, or any serious impertinence in the
way of observation or reflection, no more penetrated
his aristocratic outside than water a duck's back.</p>

<p>Lord Tom Tidler ate of the best, drank of the best,
and smoked of the best. Any one who entered his
rooms might quaff champagne, or sparkling moselle
all day, if he liked it.</p>

<p>"It costs me nothing," Lord Thomas would say.
"My fellow there" (meaning his valet) "is the sufferer. 
He paid for the stamp."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my lord," replied the latter
on one occasion, "I got it from the new stationer's
in Bond-street, on your lordship's credit."</p>

<p>"Let's order a ton of gilt-edged note-paper," cries
Tidler; "and I'll supply all my friends at seventy-five
per cent, less than manufacturing prices."</p>

<p>His lordship has been known to leave a ten guinea
watch, on the evening of the day that he obtained it,
for nineteen shillings with a shabby stranger in a
night-house. He was to have a pound advanced on
it, and the stranger stopped a shilling, as he said, for
interest on the loan for a day. Of course Tidler never
saw watch or stranger again.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" he said, "I shall never
pay for it."</p>

<P>Yet tradesmen treated him with respect, whilst they
would have remorsely sued any poor but honest man,
who required time, through some unforeseen misfortune, 
to pay a bill for necessaries. And in spite of all
this, Lord Thomas was a most popular man. Now
and then he delivered a lecture on temperance or

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

early closing, or a missionary undertaking. He was
a great card at public dinners, especially of the philanthropic 
kind. He would have shone in returning
thanks for the House of Commons at a Tradesman's
Economic Burial Dinner, or Protection Association;
it didn't matter in the least to him. Ministers of
State wrote to him, "My dear Tidler"&mdash;his party
was then in. If a small man wanted a small place,
he came to Tidler, or more frequently to his valet;
and if he didn't get it, you may depend upon it the
shabbiness of the douceur was the most probable
reason. Just before his marriage, he had the offer of
the governorship of an important but distant Colony;
but he treated the offer with scorn. You should
have heard him ridicule the idea of having seven
thousand pounds a-year in a place where there were
no music-halls and no Opera. At length, he condescended 
to make his creditors happy. Sixteen brides-maids, 
in sixteen dresses duly described by the Court
milliners who provided them, graced the marriage ceremony; 
the choral service was intoned, and dukes,
earls, duchesses, and countesses innumerable, saw
Lord Thomas Peckham Tidler "thrown off." After
this amazing display, the old church looked grim as
ever. There was the usual number of shabby old
women in rusty black, crouching on the door-steps
under the pillars, like the ghosts of ill-sorted marriages, 
or the battered Caryatides escaped from the
architectural ornaments of a temple consecrated to
repentant Hymen.</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon, dusty and somewhat cold.
A north-east wind was blowing, though the sun was

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

occasionally hot, in a manner very favourable to
bronchitis, especially as the previous day had been
remarkably close and "muggy"&mdash;we know no other
term to express it.</p>

<p>Any one who had happened to stand at the corner
of the street opposite at the precise moment of which
we are speaking, and who had been there some four
years before, on the day when the Downy Cove
played so conspicuous a part there as street-sweeper,
could not but have expressed some surprise at seeing
that individual, apparently unchanged by time or
circumstances, busy in his old vocation again. Yes,
there he was, as energetic as ever, sweeping away,
and ever and anon indulging in a little war-dance of
his own, and striking the arm which happened to be
unencumbered by the besom on his chest, like an
Indian fakir. Doubtless, he did not wear the same
garments; but they seemed identical. Nor did he,
in all probability, wield the same besom; but besoms
are very much alike, especially when they are new.
The man himself had scarcely changed at all. In
fact, no one could have detected the slightest change
in him. Let us pause and hear what he says.</p>

<p>"Dror it mild, Cove, dror it mild. I shall 'ave
some of the nobs swearin' at me orful for kickin' up
a dust. I vish they'd come down vith it a little
'andsomer, that's all. Now, here's a gent a-comin'.
Vell, I'll show him wot I could do if it wos sloppy;
and, pr'aps, hif he's of an himaginative turn, he'll
fork out notwithstandin'."</p>

<p>As he spoke&mdash;unconsciously repeating almost the
very words he had once used before on a similar

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

occasion, in the very same locality&mdash;the person approached. 
It was Grinderby, walking slowly. Apparently 
he was a little lame. He stopped, and looked
round. "Not here?" said that worthy&mdash;"not here?
and I'm a quarter of an hour late. That looks bad,
very bad; looks as if his game was quite sure. No
eagerness for the money, hard up as he is." And the
lawyer took off his hat, and polished his forehead with
a large silk handkerchief, which he pulled out, looked
anxiously round, and then slowly hobbled towards
Hanover-square.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I twigged him in time," said the Downy.
"It's that old limb of an hattorney&mdash;him as ruined
them Aubreys, poor things, and as I vent that queer
message for down by the river t'other day. Wot's
he hup to now?"</p>

<p>At this moment, a man, who had been sitting on
the church steps, with his head buried in his hands,
and his elbows on his knees, as if sleeping, or in
grief, suddenly rose up and came past the Downy.</p>

<p>"I've seen you afore, too, someveres," quoth that
individual. "I heggspeck we've been a stayin' at the
same hotel, or wos it at the Hunderground Club, in
Mint-street? Let's see! You ain't the young man
as comes the shivery-shaky dodge outside the cook-shops, 
air yer?" A shake of the head followed this
inquiry to himself. "Nor you don't do Moses and
the bulrushes on Vaterloo Bridge. No! nor you
ain't in the groundsel line. Nor the owls ain't
yours. Nor you don't come the snakes in his bussum
caper. I've seen yer face afore, and yet it licks me
to say vere."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

<p>At this moment the man passed again. He wore
a thick and matted beard, and his hair was long and
hung in elf-locks over his neck. He might have
been handsome, but want or dissipation had set its
seal upon his face.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Sharp misery had worn him to the bone.</p>

</div>

<p>He did not appear to see any one as he came by.</p>

<p>"I say, guv'nor," quoth the Downy. "Hem!
Eh?" And he executed a series of little signs and
winks, to which the other responded by a vacant
stare, which expressed neither curiosity nor astonishment.</p>

<p>The Downy shook his head. "It's a case of
genu-ine distress," he said. "I wonder the perlice
haven't nobbled him yet. He don't seem 'arf wide
avake. Hi! mate! I say, wot's the time o' day?
Starvin', hold feller, is that the game?"</p>

<p>The other turned upon him a look so wolfish and
yet despairing, that it staggered the equanimity of
even our experienced friend.</p>

<p>"Here's 'arf a pint," he said, tendering him a
copper, "as I meant to 'ave laid sum of this 'ere
dust vith, as I've bin a swallerin' of. Vell, pr'aps
Prowidence vill score it up someveres in them ewer-lastin' 
gardens vere there's nothink to pay, and no
lieyers nor perlicemen at no price votsumever. No
offence, mate," he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>The individual whom he addressed laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," he said, "I'm much obliged to
you, but I'm not begging. Dash it! thank you, all
the same."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

<p>And he laughed with a hollow and hysterical laugh,
and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>For once, a serious expression appeared on the
visage of our volatile friend. He did not even throw
down his besom; but placed it against the railing,
and his finger against his nose in an attitude of deep
reflection.</p>

<p>"It's him," he said at last, "it's him, I'll pound
it. If it ain't him, it's his woice, as has bin in the
country and prigged the clothes hoff a scar-crow. Of
course, poor cretur', his 'air and beard 'ave grown
wonderful long. Venever a swell's hout of luck,
that's sure to happen. Here's old Grinderby a-comin'
back. The werry lieyer as did the bis'ness. Wotever
is he a schemin' of? I wish I'd follered that poor
unfortynate cretur'. Well, he '<i>ave</i> come down in the
world, and no mistake; and wot's more, I don't think
he can come down no lower vithout hookin' of it
haltogether. Poverty's bad enough for them, as has
never knowed nothink better. But a real gent in
hout-and-hout trouble is wus hoff than a tame monkey
got out of a travellin' show in a snow-storm."</p>

<p>"Here, fellow!" called Grinderby, who had reapproached 
our friend, "do you want to earn sixpence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I can do it honestly," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Hum!" growled Grinderby; "I shouldn't think
you need trouble yourself about <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Pr'aps if I hadn't, guv'nor, I might be better
hoff. I vunce had a chance of henterin' a hattorney's
hoffice in the jewnior de-partment."</p>

<p>"No insolence, fellow!" replied the other, and then

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

to himself, "Can he know?" (Aloud.) "Are you
aware to whom you are speaking?"</p>

<p>"Can't say as I are," was the answer. "Never
'ad the pleasure afore, vich is wot the cove said when
they hanged him for a hact of restitooshun."</p>

<p>"An act of restitution?" said Mr. Grinderby, inquiringly. 
"What might that be?"</p>

<p>"Vy, yer see, he knocked a lieyer on the 'ead
vith a crowbar, and took his gold ticker from him."</p>

<p>"And do you call that restitution, you rascal?"
said Grinderby; "you deserve to be given in charge."</p>

<p>"Vy, yer see, there wos two got back their hown&mdash;the 
devil got the lieyer hentire, and the poor a part
of wot they'd been robbed of," said the Downy.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby changed the conversation. Possibly
he did not wish at that precise moment to identify
himself with his profession.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a scowl meant for a smile,
"I see you don't care about earning a trifle. Money
is so plentiful with you, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, werry!" replied the Downy. "A large
portion of the hinwisible capittle of the nation, as I
heerd a helderly gent a talkin' of vunce on the knifeboard 
of a City bus. But wot can I do for you,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Just run into that public-house, my good fellow,
and get yourself a glass of ale with this, and see if
there is a tall man there with a beard&mdash;an American
gentleman, dressed in a rough blue pilot-coat. He
wears glasses, and&mdash;you can't mistake him."</p>

<p>The Downy departed on his mission, and Grinderby
paced up and down. Whilst he was waiting, two

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

very different persons appeared on the scene, and met
at the corner where he stood.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Swellingham," cried Stingray, as he
nearly ran against that individual, who was leading
a little girl by the hand, "is this the way you cut
your old friends?"</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," replied Mr. Swellingham, "but
really I did not observe&mdash;I was so preoccupied.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so, my dear fellow," replied the other; "I
have not seen you, I don't know when. You are so
altered, that I might have been well excused for not
recognising <i>you</i>. How long is it?"</p>

<p>"Nearly four years, Mr. Stingray," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"To judge by your appearance it might be ten,"
said Stingray. "You are positively quite grey.
Large family, eh? Many of these cherubs?" pointing
to the child, who was slender and pale, and had
apparently somewhat outgrown her strength. "Now
don't be in a hurry. I want to ask you a number of
questions."</p>

<p>At this moment the Downy came out of the public-house 
and reapproached Grinderby.</p>

<p>STINGRAY (<i>to</i> SWELLINGHAM). Here, step aside
one moment. I want to ask you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>GRINDERBY (<i>to</i> DOWNY). Well, was he there?</p>

<p>DOWNY. Not a crumb of him.</p>

<p>GRIN. Confound the fellow! He does not mean to
come. Here (<i>to</i> DOWNY). You must take this note
for me to a tavern in Deptford called the "One-Eyed
Marine."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

<p>DOW. I knows. I went afore for yer, from
Webb's Fields.</p>

<p>GRIN. The devil you did! Ha! ha! I dare say.
The firm does a great deal in public-house business.</p>

<p>DOW. Hany answer?</p>

<p>GRIN. Yes&mdash;no! Leave the note. The gentleman
will write by post.</p>

<p>DOW. Shall I call hin the Fields for&mdash;hanythink?</p>

<p>GRIN. Yes, to-morrow. I shall know by that time
if the note be delivered all right.</p>

<p>DOW. (<i>aside</i>). Bless your himperence. D'ye take
me for one of your own sort? D'yer think I'm going
to make out a bill of costs without earnin' of 'em?
To letters and messages vun pound vun? (<i>Aloud</i>.)
I'll jest take a bob on haccount for hexpenses. Thank
yer.</p>

<p>GRIN. Don't get drunk on the road. (<i>Aside</i>.) The
impudent rascal. I must be off now. (<i>Aloud</i>.) Lose
no time! (<i>Aside</i>.) I told Tops to be in the square
exactly at the half-hour. It wants three minutes.
I'll walk round and meet him. (<i>Exit</i> GRINDERBY.)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> TOPS <i>driving the</i> "<i>mourning-coach</i>."</p>

<p>TOPS. Hi! Have you seen an old gentleman?
What! Why&mdash;can it be! Yes, it's the Downy
himself, as I'm a sinner! Hallo, mate! is this the
way you sarve an old pal?</p>

<p>DOW. Wot! Mister Tops! werry 'appy, I'm sure.</p>

<p>TOPS. You're a pretty feller never to come near a
friend, you are. I've been a looking for you everywheres.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

<p>DOW. Yell, yer see, I ain't been courtin' popylarity 
much lately. Do these togs look like wisitin'?</p>

<p>TOPS. It ain't the dress, Mr. Downy, that we
invites of a Sunday, it's the party that wears it.
We ain't seen you, not to speak to, ever since the
shutters of the model corfy-shop was put up.</p>

<p>DOW. (<i>with a grimace</i>). Don't mention it! I
say, though, I'm blest if hever you tasted sich corfy.
Werry's, in Regent-street, was a fool to it. Everythink 
was spicy and no mistake, and this is the hend
on't! And the nobs tell us, "Honesty's the best
pollicy." Walker! They keeps the pollicy for themselves, 
and leaves us hall the honesty. But, I say,
what a guy you air!</p>

<p>TOPS. Legal huniform! Serious style. I'm living
with old lawyer Grinderby.</p>

<p>DOW. You air! Then you're livin' with a&mdash;&mdash;
but, no, I von't say nothin' agen your guvernor,
young man, leastways viles he is your guvernor.</p>

<p>TOPS. Won't you? Then I will, at least, afore
long; for I'm going to leave him. Do you see this
here bucket?</p>

<p>DOW. Wot, them flowers? Vell, rather; there's
plenty on 'em. Wot's the caper? If you wos livin'
vith a Jew gent, as had a shop in Covint Garding,
or an 'orticultural party down Fulham vay, I might
have twigged wot you was hup to better. Has old
six-and-eight took to growin' carnations?</p>

<p>TOPS. Not he. I don't mind telling you, that I'm
wearing this nosegay in honour of <i>her</i> coming back
to Hingland.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

<p>DOW. Her. What, Misses Susan? I never knowed
she'd bin anyveres. Tell us hall about it.</p>

<p>TOPS. She's been gone nigh on four year, and I
expect her this very evening from Paris along with
her missis, a furren lady, a great Heyetalian singer.</p>

<p>DOW. Vell, I must hook it. I got to deliver this
'ere letter for your guvernor. He wos here jest now.
(<i>Shows letter to</i> TOPS.)</p>

<p>TOPS (<i>reads</i>). "Captain Jonathan Bocombe Tadgers, 
care of Mr. Gruffem, 'The One-Eyed Marine,'
Deptford." Whatever is the game, I wonder?</p>

<p>DOW. 'Tain't the first time I've been there, neither.</p>

<p>TOPS. Have you ever seen this Captain Tadgers?</p>

<p>DOW. Yes, and a rum lot he is too, I can tell
you.</p>

<p>TOPS. I'd give harf a crown to clap eyes on him.</p>

<p>DOW. Down with it on the nail. There he is! a
coming hout of that werry door&mdash;there, at that small
public. He's come to meet the hold 'un, as 'ad got
himpatient, and gone off without seein' of him.</p>

<p>TOPS. Here! Get some one to mind these 'osses'
'eads. No; you go and stop him, and get him to go
in again, and give him the letter. I'll drop in accidental, 
and we'll reckon him up between us. Here's
the needful. (<i>Tosses him half a crown</i>.)</p>

<p>The Downy went on his mission, without loss of
time, and Tops soon managed to engage some one to
look after the "mourning-coach," and the two old
gaunt Flemish horses. We will leave them to their
devices for a few minutes, while Mr. Stingray and
Swellingham, with his little girl, reappear on the
scene, still talking.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

<p>STING. My dear Swellingham, excuse me. Whose
make are those trousers?</p>

<p>SWELL. A very cheap and honest fellow in the
City. Are you in want of a tailor?</p>

<p>STING. Much obliged! (<i>Laughs</i>.) To tell the
truth, I never did see such a cut. You are, indeed,
an altered man, since the days I remember.</p>

<p>SWELL. Do you consider that clothes make the
man? (<i>Aside</i>.) If so what a scoundrel his tailor
ought to be; for he has clothed him in hypocrisy
and baseness from head to foot.</p>

<p>STING. No! certainly not, but the very tone of
your voice, your actual pronunciation, is quite
changed.</p>

<p>SWELL. I dare say. The fact is, I am so busy that
I can't attend to such matters. When one has a lot
of these little mouths to fill (<i>looks at the child</i>), it
does make a difference. Come, Bella, wish the
gentleman good-bye.</p>

<p>STING. Do you call that a little mouth? A dear,
good little thing; but frankly her mouth is not her
best feature. You know I never flatter. She looks
rather delicate.</p>

<p>SWELL. Delicate? Thank Heaven! she has never
had a day's illness. I have not a sickly child among
them all. Good day, Mr. Stingray!</p>

<p>STING. Stay! stay! You are not in such a
hurry.</p>

<p>SWELL. Well, the fact is, that I have some
friends coming to dinner&mdash;old Mrs. Snobbington,
with her three eldest grandchildren. You remember
poor Snob?</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

<p>STING. Who could forget him! Talk about
changes. Was ever one like that? To think, after
his utter ruin, that he should have gone into the
medical department in India. Few persons, save
myself, knew that he had walked the hospitals in
early life.</p>

<p>SWELL. He died, poor fellow! a victim to his exertions. 
What hero ever merited the cross of valour
better than our old friend "Snob," as we used to call
him? To have amputated the leg of a private soldier
under the fire of the mutineers at Lucknow as coolly
as if he were smoking a cigar! Nor was that more
than an episode of his daily life. In his last letter
to me thanking me for the little attention which I
paid to his mother after they were so reduced in
fortune, he said that nothing gave him so much
pleasure as to mingle with those whom he had formerly
deemed far beneath him, and whom he had studied to
avoid and despise&mdash;the "soldier and the working
man." "Believe me," he wrote, "the heart and brain
of England are soundest among those who are not
corrupted by wealth, nor enervated by luxury, whom
Society has not made selfish, nor fashion hypocritical.
What heroism is his, who, with the sternest valour
and endurance, volunteers for the 'forlorn hope,'
or breathes his last sigh without complaint in the
hospital or the trenches, with the full persuasion on
the one hand that, should he survive, an ungrateful
country will leave him a beggar with his scars, and,
on the other, that should he perish, his name, if not
wholly unrecorded, will but swell the long list of the
forgotten and the unknown. This is duty, indeed,

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

far outshining the star on the decorated breast. This,
if I live, it will be the object of my humble efforts
to place before my country in the most forcible terms
I can command; this, if I die, it is at least a consolation 
to have known, to have met, and in some slight
decree to have shared and alleviated."</p>

<p>STING. Very eloquent and enthusiastic indeed, but
slightly absurd. I suppose, had he not died in India,
we should have had the pleasure of reading a letter
on the Delhi prize money, signed "A. Snobbington,"
in the "Times." By-the-bye, did you see Sir Crossbill 
Crossbill's observations about Phil Cousens's
divorce?</p>

<p>SWELL. I did. He said if he were not the greatest
fool, he was one of the greatest rogues to whom he
had ever granted the aid of the Court.</p>

<p>STING. Capital! wasn't it? Knowing Phil and
his excellent heart as we did! Ha! ha!</p>

<p>SWELL. He left the firm I believe nearly four
years ago.</p>

<p>STING. Just after the Aubrey scandal. I wonder
what has become of that poor wretch. Strange that
he has not turned up as chief promoter of a Limited
Liability Company, nor come out with a scheme for
paying off the National Debt.</p>

<p>SWELL. Come, Bella!</p>

<p>STING. Just four years ago!</p>

<p>(SWELLINGHAM <i>gives some pence to his little girl
for a beggar woman with a baby in her arms</i>.)</p>

<p>STING. Very wrong that! I never encourage street
begging. I have a great mind to give her in charge
to the police.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

<p>SWELL. You had better not.</p>

<p>STING. Why not?</p>

<p>SWELL. Hem! The charge might assume a more
complex character; for (<i>sternly and defiantly</i>) if you
did&mdash;&mdash; Come, Bella!</p>

<p>STING. Pooh-pooh! I was only joking. Of course
if you like to amuse yourself by flying in the face of
the law, I should not interfere with a friend's diversions. 
It puts me in mind of the flower-girl on the
night of the suicide&mdash;the "garwotter," eh? (<i>Mimics</i>
SWELLINGHAM'S <i>former style</i>.)</p>

<p>SWELL. (<i>firmly</i>). She lives in my family, and has
been the beloved nurse of my children these three
years.</p>

<p>STING. There were a good many changes about
that time. Some six months after that the Duke of
Chalkstoneville and Acres ended his virtuous days,
and left Kitty Dareall fifty thousand pounds, with
which that exemplary and accomplished young lady
turned devotee, and head matron to a sort of hybrid
preventive service institution for ladies without any
ostensible means of existence. Ha! ha! What a gain
to religion and morality!</p>

<p>SWELL. I don't see any change in you, Mr. Stingray.</p>

<p>STING. Has this dear little cherub of yours had
small-pox?</p>

<p>SWELL. No! Why do you ask?</p>

<p>STING. Oh! nothing. The woman to whom she
gave those coppers just now had her child covered
with it&mdash;that is all. But doubtless your darling has
been vaccinated. Good-bye, my dear friend. (<i>Seizes

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

his hand and shakes it warmly</i>.) I must go and
secure a stall to hear the divine Bianca Stellini, who
is expected here, if she has not arrived, and who
makes her first appearance at the Opera on Thursday 
night. She has been the furore at St. Petersburg, 
Milan, Rome, and Naples during the past year.
Nothing like her since poor dear Malibran. Her
beauty and romantic history too&mdash;the widow of a
young Polish officer killed in the British service in
the Crimea&mdash;will insure her a splendid reception here.
Ta! ta! (<i>Goes and returns</i>.) Now, don't distress
yourself about the small-pox. It's better to have it
early, you know. Bye, bye! (<i>And Mr. Stingray
walked off to the great relief of Swellingham</i>.)</p>

<p>"What a horrid, wicked man, papa!" said the
child. "Isn't he a wicked man?"</p>

<p>"Indeed he is, my dear," replied Swellingham;
"and yet he has the credit of having a good heart. I
would back the instincts of one innocent child," he
continued, as if to himself, "against the general
opinion of the world in a case like his. True enough,
he is not much changed, though I dare say his vices
have grown greyer with his hair. All the change is
for the worse, as the critics say of his books. Still
Society deems this vivisector of humanity tender-hearted, 
and dubs him a philanthropist and a sage.
Sage and onions to stuff geese withal&mdash;the onions to
draw tears over his sickly sentiment and maudlin
rhodomontade. I don't believe a word about the
small-pox. But we'll get outside an omnibus, darling,
and purify ourselves from <i>his</i> contact as we can."</p>

<p>And with this speech Mr. Swellingham took little

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

Bella by the hand and led her towards Regent-street
in search of an omnibus, meeting, as he did so, a
trio emerging from the public-house door already
mentioned. These were Captain Tadgers, the Downy,
and Tops.</p>

<p>These individuals paused to exchange a few words
before Tops remounted the box-seat of the "mourning-coach."</p>

<p>Captain Tadgers was a stout and tall personage,
with a dark countenance, strong black beard, and
apparently weak eyes, for which he wore a pair of
green spectacles of the description "blinker." He
was attired in rough pea-coat buttoned up high
round his throat. He looked like a Yankee supercargo 
or stevedore, and possibly he was something
of the kind.</p>

<p>"Waal," said this individual, addressing the
Downy, "I calculate you're about as harmless a
crittur as ever I see. I'll just tell you what you
oughter du, and that's to jine a tribe of our Red
Injins. They'd make something out of a poor half-witted 
cuss like you, I reckon. I tell you they'd give
you free livin'."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean the savages by the Injins,"
said Tops. "Would they take a fancy to my friend
here now?"</p>

<p>"They'd be some pumkins on him, I tell you,
strainger. The Injins always have a great respect
for mad folks. I should think you air about half-baked" 
(to the Downy), "ain't yer?"</p>

<p>"The Parish allers said so," responded the Downy,
meekly.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

<p>"Waal, anyhow you were sharp enough to save
your legs a journey, when you saw me jest now; I
dare say you'll have another letter to deliver before
long at the 'One-Eyed Marine.' Don't stop on the
road, or I'll tar and feather you, I will by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose you've bin in England before," said
Tops.</p>

<p>"That's my consarn," said the other. "I suppose
maybe I have; and I don't find it growed much since
I was here when a youngster. Why, we annex a
country bigger than yourn every year! We could
put this island in one of our lakes, without spilling a
drop of water over the sides. As for this coon, the
Injins is the best speckylation for him. They'll make
him a medicine-man and treat him handsome. I
knew an Irishman what jined a tribe, and got drunk
at their expense every day till he died. Now and
then he'd give them a jig, and I've known 'em go to
war on the strength of an extra fling, when he'd had
a drop more than his reg'lar allowance. Waal, I
reckon I'm off." And so saying Captain Tadgers
suited the action to the word, and without compliment 
or salutation, unless spitting half across the
street might be taken for such, he quietly strode out
of sight.</p>

<p>"Whatever can old Grinderby want along with
him?" said Tops to the Downy. "But you must
come along with me. I've a deal to ask you. I want
to hear all about the 'inwestment,' as you used to
call it, and how you was wound up, and what you've
been a doing of since, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Wound hup?" said the Downy, taking his seat

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

on the box. "I should think I were wound hup, and
it would take the Court of Chance-ry to hunvind
me, and I don't believe as they could do it, no not hif
all the lieyers was to try for a 'undred years. They'd
get me in such a precious tangle, that I'd never be
hunvound no more in this vorld, and the knots vould
'ave to be took out of me in the next by a special
mercy of Prowidenx. Vy I vent for three 'undred
and fifty pound hover and above my capittle. Bless
yer, vy I wos a bankrup' and put in the 'Gayzette.'
D'ye call that nothing?"</p>

<p>"No, I should have called it something, if you'd
owed me the money," answered Tops. "But how
was it a chap like you, as I always took to be honest,
got in sich a precious mess? You wasn't a 'limited
lie-ability,' was you?"</p>

<p>"Vell," said the Downy, "I wos a doin' pretty
vell, in spite of the debts owin' to me, ven a chap as
took his corfy reg'lar of a mornin', he proposed to git
me a pardner."</p>

<p>"Was he a lieyer?" asked Tops.</p>

<p>The Downy nodded.</p>

<p>"And you was soft enough to let him meddle with
the consarn? I sees it all," said Tops, touching up
his horses judicially.</p>

<p>"Vell," said the Downy, "he wos a civil-spoken
sort of gent enough, and he axed me vun day about
the capittle and the bis'ness, and said he shouldn't
charge nothink, and he didn't neither. Forty-nine
pound seventeen and fourpence ha'penny ain't exactually 
nothink, is it? Them lieyers never leaves out
the ha'penny. It looks so werry special and pertickler.

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

That wos his figure, and wot's more he got it. He
borrered the last fifty from me the veek afore I wos
wound hup."</p>

<p>"And how did you get through the Court?" inquired 
Tops.</p>

<p>"There wern't no sort of difficulty," replied the
other. "You see I never kep' no accounts, vich
saved a sight of trouble, and the judge he larfed
fit to burst hisself, ven I hexplained how it were.
He said my lieyer ought to be struck hoff his rolls,
and I said I believed he were, as vell as his corfy and
butter and heggs, as soon as my shutters wos hup.
'He allers liked his rolls werry 'ot, my lord,' ses I, 'as
vell as his corfy.' 'And didn't he pay for what he
had?' axed the judge. 'No,' my lord,' ses I. 'I
were to take it hout in hadwice gratis.' 'See wot
you've brought this poor man to,' says his lordship to
my pardner, werry sewere. 'I do believe he's not to
blame,' he ses. 'You never spoke better truth,' ses
I, 'in your life, vich is more nor I expected from any
vun here.' Then they all larfed. 'Silence!' ses his
lordship. 'I shall give him a first-class certifycate,'
he ses. But didn't he come down on my pardner, and
said he ought to be transported. Vell, hever since
that, I've been agoin' on in the hold line. Sometimes 
I've a bit of grub and to spare, and sometimes
nothink. If it wosn't for the vinter, I vouldn't care.
Do you think there's any truth in wot that cove
from Amerikey said about them there Injins, mate?
I've a mind to try it on, if I thought it wos safe.
But I sticks to life, as much as hif I wos a bishop."</p>

<p>"I don't think they'd eat you, if they did kill

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

you," said Tops; "unless the cannibals is fond of
grilled bones, and I don't think they'd ever fatten
you, if they was to try."</p>

<p>"I say," said the Downy, as if seized by a sudden
inspiration, "who d'ye think I see, jest afore I met
you? I wos agoin' to tell yer, ven you sent me after
that ere wot's-his-name in sich a hurry. It's about
the hout-and-houtest rummy go, that I should 'ave
run agen him and you too in the same arternoon that
hever I did know."</p>

<p>"Can't say," replied Tops. "Was it the little chap
as sung the song about the pleeceman the day as you
opened the corfy-shop?"</p>

<p>"No!" said the Downy, "kvite a different sort;
vun as it'll make me sad to think on, ven I turns into
my four-pennorth this evenin'. Vun as you knowed
vell, ven he wos a sight better hoff than he is now,
and vun as I'm sorry I let go afore I'd rightly
twigged as it wos him. Not that I could do
anythink of hany account for him. It was your old
guvernor."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well that the two old Flemish
horses were worthy of the names Tops had given
them; for had they been a skittish or restive pair, it
is likely that the mourning-coach would have come
to grief at that moment. Tops fairly let the whip and
reins fall out of his hands, and turning round he
seized the Downy by the throat and shook him in the
excess of his emotion.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "my old master&mdash;Mister&mdash;Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"Loose yer hold, vill yer? D'ye vant to throttle

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

a feller?" exclaimed the Downy. "Loose yer hold,
I say."</p>

<p>Tops burst out laughing almost hysterically as he
released his hold on his companion. He then deliberately 
got down and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>"Here! Hold them," he said, "whilst I pick up
the persuader, and so saying he ran after the whip,
which a small boy had already seized, and was
flourishing about the heads and legs of a number of
his fellows.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" shouted one; "look at his coat-tails,
Bill." "I say, master," cried another, "you've bin a
robbin' the beadle." "Twig the cove on the box!"
"Vy he's picked up Jack Ketch's nevvy." "They
was a millin' like mad, jest now." "Drive hoff, muffin-face, 
and leave him behind!" "He'll never catch
yer in that long tog of hisn." "You've been airing
the hen-roost, that's wot that old trap's been used
for." Presently the nearest urchin sent a potatoe
just between Tops and the Downy, as the former
whipped up "Dogsmeat" and "Catsmeat," and drove
off, followed by the acclamations of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Did you say you really see Mr. Aubrey? And
when was it?" asked Tops in a husky tone.</p>

<p>"I see him jest afore I see you," replied the
Downy.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was him?" inquired Tops.</p>

<p>"I ain't quite a fool, though I sometimes looks like
vun. D'yer think I don't know him agen?"</p>

<p>"And is he very poor and bad off?" asked Tops.</p>

<p>"It's pretty nigh hall hup vith him, I'm afeard,"
replied the Downy. "I spoke to him, but he was

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

hoff like a shot. I'll tell yer wot it is, I'd ha' guv
him the last bob I got in the vurld, if he'd a' took it,
for I never forgets a kindness; and I don't like to
see a real gent down on his luck to sich a pint as
never wos meant to stand it. I didn't know you
would a' took on so grievious about him, or I'd a' broke
it gently. I respex your feelinx, young man, but blow
your hemotion! You pretty nigh strangled me, and
s'pose the 'osses had bolted."</p>

<p>"They ain't got a bolt in 'em. They couldn't bile
up a gallop atween 'em, not if they was engaged
'special,' as you call it, for the Lord Chancellor's own
funeral, as was wanted very sudden below. T'other
day a 'gent' said they were such a pair of old
Romans, they'd have committed suicide long ago, if
they only knowed how. Victuals is no use to them,
no, nor grooming neither. But my time is up this
day month; for I told old Grinderby to suit himself
this morning. Look here, mate, you must find Mr.
Aubrey for me at once. There ain't a letter in which
my Susan hav'n't asked me if I hav'n't heard no
news of him. If he's about, as you say, why his
address must be collared&mdash;that's all. But I'm afraid
your eyes have deceived you this time."</p>

<p>"I vish I wos as certain of twenty pound a-year,"
said the Downy. "If I'd honly seen him ven he wos
a swell, and not knowed hanythink of him arter his
misfortins, I might be mistook. But I'd svear to
him anyveres, if he wos disguised as the Hemperor
of Morroky, or the Chief Commissioner of Bobbies
at the openin' of Parlyment; and he beats Ashley's
holler, if he could honly sit his 'oss less like a sack

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

of peas vith a cocked 'at on. Vy, I'd tell your old
guvernor's woice among a thousand. He's growed a
beard, and it's turned a little grey along vith his 'air.
And he's a sight thinner, and stoops. But vot's the
hodds to a man of hobserwation? Ven I knows a
man, I knows him; and I ain't likely to be took in
by haccidental ressemblance like the perlice, cos I
ain't got to get up no ewidents agen a hinnocent
party."</p>

<p>"You didn't speak to him, Mr. Downy?" asked
Tops.</p>

<p>"In course I did," replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>"And he answered you?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said he wos not beggin', and no more he wos
for that matter."</p>

<p>"You didn't&mdash;insult him!" said Tops.</p>

<p>"No more than offerin' to stand 'arf a pint, afore
I'd propperly hentered on his recognisinzes," said
the Downy, who for once mistook the meaning of a
term which he had picked up.</p>

<p>"And didn't you foller him?"</p>

<p>"Vy should I? Wot vould 'ave bin the use? If
I could 'ave done him hany good, I'd 'ave follered
him fast enough. And wot's more, H. Downy,
Eskvire, ain't on the private hinspection lay, vich I
takes to be jest about the meanest, lyingest, thievingest, 
humbugginest set-out in this here blessed willage
of London."</p>

<p>"We must find him now. Me and Susan has
saved up a tidy penny, but we'll spend the last

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

farthin', sooner than not do it. She says it's my
duty, and I feels it is, here," said Tops, pressing the
handle of his whip across his left side. "It's got
to be done, that's what it has, you see. Now, if
you'll git down here, I'll put the 'osses up, and join
you in about an hour. It'll take that time, for I acts
just the same by these precious old screws, as if they
would fetch five hundred guineas at the Corner. You
shall go with me to the wharf to meet Susan and
her missus, a celybrated furren singer, this evening.
They prefer coming all the way by the boat, and so
should I for that matter; for I'd rather be drownded
right off, than be half mashed, or made a idiot of by
a railway accident. Fancy sitting opposite such a
customer as old Grinderby, and having his buck teeth
sticking in your forehead!"</p>

<p>"But don't his sort go by sea jest as hoften?"
asked the Downy. "How vould you like to be cotched
round the neck by a drowndin' lieyer, as you cotched
hold of me jest now? I'll tell yer what it is. Travellin' 
don't get rid of bad company, or I should 'a
begun the grand tower ven I cum of age, and not
pulled hup in a jiffy neither. Did yer never 'ear of
the Vanderin' Jew, the boldest clothesman in the
vurld? It's my hopinion that he vos vunce the
senior pardner of an uncommon respectabil firm of
sollycitors in Jeerusylum."</p>

<p>"There was no solicitors in those days, I've heard
said," replied Tops. "It's a modern institooshun."</p>

<p>"Modern rope's-end! Is lies modern, and rattlesnakes 
and pison? Vere did hall the vickedness
horiginally cum from? I've heerd different. There

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

wos a chap used to preach on Primrose-'ill, and he
said there wos lieyers and plenty in Jeerusylum.
And wot's more, there wos vun on 'em in Pairadice
as tempted Heve with a golden pippin. The firm vos
Sattin, Sarpent and Co., and the bill wos made hout
to Hadam on a fig-leaf, and ven he couldn't shell out,
hexecution wos issued. It's bin agoin' on ever since,
and there's more on 'em than hever now, owing to the
hincrease of crime and poppylation."</p>

<p>Tops looked at his quaint companion and shook his
head, and then nodded two or three times, as much
as to say, "It's no use to argue the point, and perhaps 
you're not altogether wrong," and the pair
entered another public-house, where they had another 
half-pint very amicably together.</p>

<p>"This evening," said Tops, "at eight o'clock, at
the wharf below London Bridge. Ask for the Bullong 
boat, and you'll find me waiting."</p>

<p>"Hall serene, guvernor!" was the cheerful response, 
and the pair parted company; Tops resuming
his seat with all the dignity which the long tails of
his snuff-coloured "uniform" imparted to him.</p>

"He's as right a sort," quoth the Downy, looking
after him, "as I hever see, and ven ve meets sich a
vun, it's enough to reckinsile us to the vickedness of
the hupper classes. I don't beleeve, if he wos to come
into a thousand a-year it would spile that man's disposishun. 
If he wos to take to the grocery line, he'd
ruin hisself vith sellin' good licker, that's wot he'd
do, and there's some as can't be honest on millions. It
ain't in 'em. There ain't no capittle in Hingland, as
vould tempt me to go into bis'ness agen, and there's a

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

many as only looks on their certyficates of bankrupsy
as tickets-of-leave to enable 'em to go in for a more
howdacious swindle. Vell, I'll jest go and look arter
that pore gent in trouble. I shouldn't vonder if he
come back agen vere I fust see him. Ven a cove is
'omeless, he generally takes to some pertickler spot
hout o' doors, as if he vanted to hold on to somethink."</p>

<p>So saying, the Downy hurried back to St. George's
Church, and only stopped for three "two-pennorths"
on the way, a token that he considered the business of
importance. But he was not fated to find Aubrey,
although his view as to the probability of that unfortunate 
being's return to the spot where he had seen
him was by no means ill-founded. At the very
moment when the Downy informed Tops of his chance
rencontre, Aubrey had in truth revisited the portico of
St. George's Church, where he leant against a pillar
and half thought, half muttered, the following incoherent 
sentences:</p>

<p>"There is nothing left now&mdash;no hope&mdash;my very
identity seems lost. I am a stranger in this vast,
awful city. No one recognises me, no one sympathises 
with me, no one pities my sufferings. Pity!
No, I could not brook that. I wonder if any one
would recognise my corpse, if I were to put an end
to this misery and die! I am utterly and entirely
alone. For nearly two years I was haunted by the
ghost of a fortune, and hunted by the reality of duns.
For a long time after I was beggared, there were
persons who wanted either to beg or borrow from
<i>me</i>. And, now, ha! ha! I do not even create an

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

impression in a casual ward. In the beginning the
brutal officials used, I believe, to take me for an
impostor in the ranks of misery, a sensational writer
in disguise, or a madman. As if any one, save a
madman, would essay that purgatory twice! At
first, when I was poor and in difficulties, I seemed
to have a talent for becoming acquainted with those
who were in difficulties and poor. Now I get acquainted 
with no one. I have no longer a shilling
to share. I used to think there was propagation in
poverty. Now I see that it is leprous and epicene.
At first how many broken clerks, superannuated
servants, distressed beings of both sexes, cropped up
as if in mockery, when I could barely earn bread
myself. Forgotten debts, too, met me at every turn.
Some wretched woman with a babe seemed produced
or invented by the fantastic decree of Fate to ask me
for a penny to cross a bridge, or to give a loaf to
her child, when I had nothing, literally nothing to
bestow. When I have been faint with hunger myself,
I have been persecuted by the piteous iteration of
want. What a terrible thing it is to be a beggar
among beggars, to have empty pockets and be dunned
by the ghastly shapes of woe! I feel sometimes as if
I could shout aloud to awaken deafened luxury, and
die content in thought that some poor creatures were
better for my misery. Oh, what foul, cold-blooded,
chronic massacre of helpless childhood, what worse
than barbaric sacrifice of the aged and infirm, what
godless, soulless, compassionless tyranny reigns
around! The butcher holidays of Rome, what were
they to the Christian Sabbath of starvation? The sanguinary 

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

Moloch was sometimes gorged and appeased,
the bloodless yellow spectre of Mammon never, never!
Day and night the skeleton crowds expire. Tens of
thousands, nay millions of priests and Levites pass by,
not even 'on the other side.' They gaze coldly, or
fiercely, on the misery they do not pity, much less
alleviate. Every hour, every minute, a Lazarus dies.
Boards and Corporations of Herods sit curiously considering 
how to slaughter infancy, without the plea of
the fear which makes despots cruel, while they seek
to attach the odium to the Divinity Whom they insult
with the lie of their hypocritical worship. That
poor wretch whom I met here&mdash;he was very poor&mdash;would 
have shared his alms with me, had I suffered
him. Thank Heaven! there is an end even to
sufferings like mine. A second time, there has been
an execution in my wretched abode, and my means of
existence are remorselessly destroyed. They would
listen to no promise, no plea for time. My very
papers and manuscripts are gone; I have not the
heart to seek to reclaim them. And what if I could?
Even the play on which I founded such hopes was
stolen, as that cynical old reporter told me it would
be, by my old college friend, the successful playwright 
of the day, and has proved in his name a
brilliant success. I have not even a copy of it, and
if I had, what could I do? If I take him by the
throat, can I shake truth out of him? No, only lie
upon lie! I should but be imprisoned; a mark and
butt for obloquy, derision, and scorn. Poverty has
no champion, no friend. I have often thought of that
old Latin motto of my school days, 'Nihil durius in

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

se paupertas habet, quam quod ridicules homines
facit.' My health is breaking fast. Why, why did I
recover from the fever which drove me forth, till I
was found, as it was supposed, the victim of an accident, 
in the streets, bruised, and torn, and bleeding?
So they took me to a hospital, and the surgeons set my
broken limb. They would not have relieved mere
poverty unembellished by an accident. I saw the
account of it in the 'Standard'&mdash;'A poor author
knocked down and run over in the streets.' Some
charitable persons subscribed nearly fifty pounds,
but the magistrate would only hand over ten; because 
he did not think that I gave a clear account of
myself. My destitution and misery were not sufficient 
testimony for me to receive such a fortune.
He talked of committing me as a vagrant and impostor! 
I have tried hard to live. Everything has
failed. One editor thought me too ambitious. Another 
did not believe my efforts to be 'original,' he
said; and so he mislaid my manuscript, which was
afterwards used by a creature of his own, a toady
who flatters him, and does the 'padding,' as it is
called, of his magazine. I am homeless, roofless, and
without means. What will become of me? No
matter. When the rain beats on my burning breast,
and the wind chills my aching limbs, I do not curse
Fortune, but cry aloud in anguish, 'Blanche! dear
departed angel, Blanche! thou art avenged, thou art
avenged!' "</p>

<p>Such is an epitome of the thoughts which crowded
through the brain of the unhappy Aubrey, and which
sometimes his lips would, in part, mechanically utter.

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

In the height of bitterness and misery, men will
sometimes talk aloud. It is generally so in the last
stage, before madness or premature death. Surely
Aubrey had suffered enough to win forgiveness for his
sins. But the cup of expiation was not yet full enough
to spill a libation to offended Fortune. Of remorse
in this world, as of suffering worth, there is taken no
visible account. Honesty is the best worldly policy,
when honesty succeeds. Remorse well and piously
expressed, may procure for a convicted felon indulgence, 
and even freedom. But were virtue always
marketable, always sure of valuable appreciation,
mankind would become so insufferably good, that
hypocrisy would sicken with a general surfeit and
die. What merit would there be in avoiding wickedness 
which never could by any means pay, in
cutting pauper vices, and turning a deaf ear to the
insolvent whine of every beggarly Sin soliciting alms
from a proudly prosperous soul? No, the experience
of the Psalmist is not that of the later epochs of
the world's history: "I have been young and am
now old, yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread." Can the most
venerable father of the Church lay his hand upon his
heart, and say, without reservation, that this is so.
If it be, is it not rather the case with those who have
made religion the stalking-horse of worldly greed?
"The distressed daughters of a deceased clergyman"
are not altogether unknown to the advertisement
sheets of the daily press. Yet who shall therefore
impeach the decrees of Heaven, and say that it is not

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

within the scope of Divine Justice that injustice
reigns upon earth? The Whig party always remains
longest in office; and an authority which we are
inclined to believe sometimes, has declared that "the
devil was the first Whig," and suggested compromise
and expediency, in a word, political hypocrisy, to
mankind.</p>

<p class="small">A SISTER OF CHARITY AND HER BRETHREN.</p>

<p class="small">Je iure par mon salut &eacute;ternel, et par les sainctes &Eacute;vangiles cy pr&eacute;sentez 
soubz ma main tenir ceste femme pour un ange; vivant en
toute honnestet&eacute;, pleine de vertueux advis, nullement maulvaise, aydant

de foiblesse et de force eussent, comme disent les anciens autheurs,
mut&eacute; le charact&egrave;re des tigres, en les attendrissant.&mdash;<i>Contes de Balzac</i>.</p>

<p>IN a plainly furnished parlour in Guilford-street,
Enssell-square, sat a lady attired in plain half-mourning, 
reading a volume of Essays from the
"Times." The "Life of Emma, Lady Hamilton,"
was the subject she had chosen. As she read that
wondrous tale of glory and perfidy, of light and
darkness, greatness and littleness, of superb, meretricious, 
rose-coloured triumph, and flabby, ghastly,
hideous ingratitude and narrowness of mind, indignation 
and horror by turns flushed and paled her
expressive face. As she read the sad, sad end&mdash;the 
story of the lap-dog fed with delicate meats,
while the soiled idol of England's best-loved hero lay
starving in her miserable garret alone; as she learnt
how Nelson's goddess, his Egeria, his beloved one,
died, and how the corpse of her, whom monarchs

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

and princes honoured, and whom their wives and
daughters flattered and imitated, was thrust into a
French pauper coffin, and flung into a pauper exile's
grave, she shut the book, and the big tears gathered
under her long dark lashes, and rolled heavily one by
one down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"And I have been weak enough," she said, "sometimes 
to repine at the lot I have chosen, and to regret
the vanities which I have cast aside! And, oh!
what a lesson is here. Truly I have lost, I have
sacrificed <i>nothing;</i> and what may I not have gained,
nay, what rather have I not already won? Last
night those darling little faces of the children in the
school-room in Soho smiled upon me in my sleep.
Let me read this letter again," she said, "that I may
recover the serenity which that story has for a moment 
destroyed."</p>

<p>"Bless you, bless you, dear lady! you have saved
me from worse than death. My poor father is recovering 
fast. Mother tells me that had I not come,
he must have died. As soon as he is well enough, we
are all going to Melbourne, Australia." (Good, that
is well.) "No one knows anything for certain here.
They think I have been in service; but I could not
bear to keep up any deceit, and so we are going away.
Father desires me to tell you that he remembers you
night and morning in his prayers. Mother begs you
will accept her duty, and the few things she has sent.
She says she is sorry that the fowls are not so fine
as some she has had earlier in the season. Oh,
madam! what has not your angelic goodness saved me

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

from? I should have been a murderess, but for you;
<i>his</i> murderess, my poor dear father's, who clasped
me to his heart, and who has never said an unkind
word since I came back. 'Annie,' he said, 'I thought
you had gone away from your old father for ever, and
I have been trying to think how I could have driven
thee away from home, child.' <i>He</i> drive me away?
He never said a harsh thing to me in his life. He
was only too good to an ungrateful wretch. If, dear
lady! you see him who deceived me, as you said
you would, say that I forgive him, and please ask
him for my picture which he had done, and destroy
it. It is the likeness of a wicked, heartless girl, who
believed a stranger, and forgot her old father, who
would have died, but for you. He is going to be
married next month at St. George's Church to a rich
lady, when I shall be far away at sea. I hope he will
be kind to her, but doubt it, poor thing! I hear she
is very plain and quite lame; but she is rich, and that
may make a difference&mdash;may it not? She will have
many to protect her, but never, <i>never</i> a friend like
you. After I left, father fell down in a fit. He will
always have the scar, the doctor says, to his grave.
When I saw it, I could not help crying; and what do
you think father pretended and tried to make me
think? He said he fell off a ladder nailing up the
grape-vine. And mother says it was true enough he
did. <i>But he didn't get that hurt then</i>, though he bruised
his arm bad enough. Nothing, dear lady, in this wide
wicked world could ever tempt me to do wrong again,
even if I had not loved him who behaved to me so
false and cruel, and left me at that dreadful place to

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

starve or worse&mdash;little he cared which! I know many
say that a girl who has once done as I have is not to
be trusted, and is certain to sin again. But if I had
another heart, and could believe in another as I believed 
in <i>him</i>, again; and if I could forget all your
words, the night when you kissed me and pressed my
hand and called me sister, till I thought my heart
would burst, I should only have to look at that scar
on father's forehead to hate and loathe the tempter
and resist every evil prompting to wrong. My eldest
sister's sneers would have no terrors for me&mdash;not if
the whole village turned their backs upon me, would
I dream of leaving the old man again. I would delight 
in bearing all for his sake, and to seem happy
lest he should feel sad. I shall see you once, dear
friend and lady, before the vessel sails&mdash;shall I not?</p>

<p class="right">"I am, ever,</p>

<p>"Your once lost but now saved and grateful <i>sister</i>,
since you <i>will</i> have me call you so,</p>

<p class="right">"ANNIE WEBBER."</p>

<p>"Poor child," said the lady, musing, "I do believe
all that she says. But I am glad on every account
that she is going away. Else she might find the
revilings of the uncharitable too bitter to endure.
I can just fancy that domestic Gorgon of a sister
of hers talking religion at her, till the poor girl is
nearly driven mad. This is what too often makes
home impossible to one whose loving and confiding
disposition has been betrayed. This letter has done
me good."</p>

<p>Here a plain thin little girl, about twelve years old,

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

entered the room. She walked up to the lady very
quietly and said, "Shall I do any work now, ma'am,
or will you hear me read?"</p>

<p>The lady patted her head and replied, "You shall
do your sewing first, my dear. Have you fed that
poor little dog?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and he seemed so glad," said the child.
"He <i>did</i> lick my hand."</p>

<p>Presently a servant-girl came in, after knocking
timidly at the door. She was very pretty, but pale
and downcast. "If you please, ma'am," she said,
"my uncle is come, and wishes to know if he may
see you, ma'am." And the girl coloured very deeply,
as if there was something remarkable in this announcement.</p>

<p>"Show him in, Mary," was the answer. "My
dear" (to the little girl), "take your sewing with
you, and go with Mary. You shall come in again
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>A rough, brutal, obstinate-looking man, with a lean,
sharp, showily-dressed woman, was shown in by the
trembling Mary.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me, I've been told," said the
man, rather gruffly. "I've 'ad some trouble to come
here all the way from Chelsea. It's about this girl, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the lady. "She is, I understand, a
near relation of yours, and has lived with you as a
sort of servant for some time."</p>

<p>"She's lived with us, true enough," said the man,
"and assisted in the house-work, I believe; but after

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

the manner in which she left, I don't want to 'ave
nothing more to do with her."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," struck in the woman who had come
with him, who we may presume was his wife, "that
for all the use she was to us, we've never missed her;
a bold, impudent, artful slut as she is, and so kind to
her as we've been. To think of the wine and things
I've give that girl, and there isn't a word bad enough
for us in her mouth. But she couldn't keep from the
fellows, and what could any one expect? The sight
as she'd leave my five children in, and never a step
scoured, nor a knife nor shoe cleaned, for that matter,
at nine o'clock of a morning. But you see what it's
come to, and she pretending to be afraid of black
beedles and rats! I'm sure, if I'd had my way, I'd
have sent her about her business long before; but my
husband he's such a good-natured fool, you know
you are, Nixon. He put up with her ways a precious
sight too long. My father kep' his chaise and was
quite a gentleman I can assure you, though we do
take in lodgers now, more's the pity, and that lazy
hussy couldn't wait on them." (The truth is that her
father kept a small chandler's shop, and Nixon was
his apprentice, and first seduced and then married
her, or she did him).</p>

<p>"This is not what I want to know," replied the
lady, mildly but firmly. "The girl, I understand, is
under age, and you" (to the man) "are her nearest
relation&mdash;is it not so? Now I am willing to take her,
to clothe her, feed her, and educate her; but I must
have a written authority from you, that if I do so, you
will not interfere. Is it not true that you turned her

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

out into the streets bareheaded and barefooted in the
night, bearing the marks of cruel bruises?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you mean to say that me or my missus ever
set fingers on the gal," interrupted the man, "it's
a &mdash; lie, and I'll make you prove it. Who are you,
interfering with other folk's affairs? Perhaps no
better than you should be for all you are so quiet and
gen-teel. I tell you, I'll have the law of you, if you
dare to say a word agen me."</p>

<p>"And pretending to believe a parcel of lies,"
screamed his spouse, "about that wretch as blacked
her arms a purpose, and robbed us, yes, robbed us.
Didn't I find ever so many things in her box? Wasn't
she always talking to the lodger's servant through
the little window of their kitchen&mdash;didn't she rob
them, too, as they told me of? If I was Nixon here,
<i>I'd</i> sign a character for her, <i>I'd</i> let her off easy, <i>I</i>
would! <i>I'd</i> sooner foller her everywhere, and let the
perlice know what she is. <i>I'd</i> let her impose upon
other people's charity, as she has on ours! Yes,
with a rope's-end! And to go and disgrace my
husband's fammerly as she has done, breeding parish
bastards, and me the daughter of a gentleman used
to very different ways, and to have my own servants
to wait on me, before I married, which Nixon there
knows" (that gentleman made no sign of acquiescence
or dissent), "if he'd only speak hout like a man.
Character, indeed! I'd character her with hoakum-picking, 
that's what she's fit for, with the other
convicts. I'd lay a good strap about her back, and
send her to gaol." Here Mrs. Nixon paused to get
her breath.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

<p>"Madam," said Mrs. Wilmington (for such was
the name of the benevolent lady, who had taken this
poor girl's part), "I think you will find on reflection,
that nothing has been said about a character for this
young person. I merely want to know whether, if I
provide for her in future, your husband will give me
a guarantee against any interference on his part as
her next of kin, and indeed, I believe, sole relation.
Have you any objection to this, sir?" she asked that
lowering and obstinate British shop-keeper, who was
beginning to exhibit symptoms of vindictive impatience.</p>

<p>"If he haven't, <i>I</i> have," began the British matron,
his wife, "I can tell you. Why shouldn't he interfere 
when and 'ow he chooses?"</p>

<p>"Hold yer tongue, will yer?" said Nixon, who
was a strange compound of connubial fierceness and
endurance, in his way. "Look h'yer, ma'am! If
you think George Nixon is agoing to sign anything
towards renouncing his rights in this or any matter,
you're mistaken, and I wish you hadn't given me
this trouble to come all the ways here. I've got my
business to attend to, I can tell you. As for my
brother's daughter there, all I can say is, that he
never could earn his own living, and when he left
that girl, I took her under my own roof and kep' her
as long as she chose to go right, and if you've got her
now, I wish you joy of her. Here, M'ria" (to his
wife) "&mdash;&mdash; it, what do you stand staring there for
like a stuck pig? Come along, will yer! The next
tune" (to Mrs. Wilmington) "you send for G.
Nixon, I wish you'd let him know what it's about

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

aforehand, that's all." So saying, he put his hat on
his head, and clutched hold of his wife's arm to drag
her out.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Mrs. Wilmington, "I did not wish
to avail myself of any other means at my disposal, in
order to obtain what I require, than an appeal to
your sense of justice and better feeling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff; gammon!" interpolated Mr. Nixon.
"Shut up! I ain't got no time to listen to such
nonsense&mdash;such nonsense!" he almost shouted. "Any
one can see as you are no lady. Come out of this,
I say" (to his wife); "I've got my business to
attend to."</p>

<p>"Such imperence, dear!" said Mrs. Nixon, bridling.
She wanted to coax the brute to let her have her say.
"Such imperence, George. Jest wait and let me tell
this person, which I don't think is over respectable
herself, a bit of my mind."</p>

<p>"You'd stand here bawling and screeching like
a parrot all the arternoon, I tell yer. I know a trick
worth two of that. I got my business to see to; and
I wish this lady, if she is one, would pay me for my
time as I've lost already. I shan't sign nothing, and
you may jest look out, enticing folks away like this
from their homes." (He forgot he and his wife had
turned the girl out of their house a twelvemonth
before.) "When you want G. Nixon, you know
where to find him."</p>

<p>"I repeat that I didn't wish to have recourse to
constraint," said Mrs. Wilmington.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" from Nixon.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

<p>"Do you know this card and writing?" handing
him a letter. "Nay, read it, you are welcome."</p>

<p>"MY DEAR MADAM,&mdash;I believe the lease of the
house in Cheyne-row expires in September. Anything 
I can do in furtherance of your benevolent
plans, I will at all times do, you may rely on it. You
may command me in everything.</p>

<p class="right">"Ever, my dear madam,<br/>

"Yours most faithfully,<br/>

"TACHBROOKE."</p>

<p>The jaw of the delightful specimen of the British
tradesman, whom we have endeavoured to depict,
actually fell. No wonder; for the bully died within
him. The writer of the letter was his landlord, the
powerful and wealthy earl, whom he worshipped,
could he be said to worship anything, with all his
abject soul, if one might dignify his thinking essence
with such a name. He handed the letter to his wife,
who read it and returned it aghast. She was the
first to come to herself.</p>

<p>"I'm sure, ma'am," she began, "anything that
we can do, as I said to Nixon coming here&mdash;didn't
I, my dear?&mdash;we should only be too 'appy. I never
wished my George's niece any harm, as it wasn't
likely I should, and we did all we could to keep her
from going wrong. Many's the time I've said to her,
which she'd tell you if she was here in this room,
if she's a mite of truth in her, 'Mary, my dear girl!
you're my husband's brother's child, and it's my duty

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

to bring you up and keep you out of harm,' which
I'm sure we tried to, as a many could testify, and
which is Gospel truth. It wasn't our fault, if she
was led astray and turned against her own 'ome and
her own flesh and blood by wicked and designing
folks, as ought to have knowed better" (whimpers).
"I will say for her that she's not a bad-dispositioned
girl of herself, though she is not a hard worker, and
her constitution's not strong. But I should say
she'd suit you to a T, which is what I tell my husband 
somebody else did him, when he married her."
(Here Mrs. Nixon grinned horribly a thin and ghastly
smile.) "Of course, since my husband's misfortunes,
and my father's ruin, owing to his being surety for a
friend, we couldn't afford to keep Mary altogether,
without expecting her to work for her living, which
is no more than I do myself."</p>

<p>How long she would have continued we cannot
tell; but Mrs. Wilmington gently interrupted her.
"I do not wish for any explanations," said that lady.
"I believe I know all the story. All I want is a
written agreement on your husband's part, not to
molest the girl during the next two years and before
she is of age, and a release from any claim he might
bring for maintenance."</p>

<p>Mr. Nixon had contented himself with removing
his hat, and scratching his huge head.</p>

<p>"I won't stand in the girl's way, my lady!" he
said, "and I'll do anything in reason, you wish.
I'm sure we're well shut of the girl&mdash;&mdash;" Here his
spouse palled his coat sleeve so hard, that he suddenly
stopped.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

<p>"And I'm sure," said his wife, "I should be
'appy to take the poor baby, and bring it up with
my children. I'm the mother of a family; and I dare
say you won't mind allowing a trifle for its keep,
which you can reduct from her wages. Blood is
thicker than water, as I said to G. N., when we was
coming here. You said you wouldn't mind my
making the offer, George, you know you did, as we
were driving through the Park."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you on Mary's behalf for your
benevolent intentions, but her offspring is dead,"
said Mrs. Wilmington, coldly. "It died, I believe,
of poverty and neglect."</p>

<p>"Lord a' mercy! poor little angel!" cried Mrs.
Nixon. "Well, she's gone to a better world."</p>

<p>"It was a boy," observed the lady, "and has been
dead these six months."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am," said Nixon, "I shan't stand in
the way of anything that is reasonable. I suppose
you won't mind allowing us something for her keep.
We had her&mdash;let's see&mdash;four year. There's her
clothes and hedication, say forty pound. Ten pound
a-year ain't too much, I hope."</p>

<p>"A great deal too much," was the reply, "for
blows, neglect, starvation, and the streets, to which
you drove her. A great deal too much, for the cruel
shame you have brought on your only brother's only
child. Not another word! I wish to abstain from
comments, which you will do well not to provoke.
My terms are these; you will accept them, or not,
as you please. You will sign this paper, which is a
simple release of all claim on this poor child, and

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

any clothes or property she may acquire. You will
send here the box which you opened, after you
turned her into the streets, with the few little articles,
left her by her father, which are in this list. On my
part, I shall consent not to expose you, for her sake,
and not to claim the money you had for the sale of
her father's goods, and the trifle in cash, something
under fifty pounds, which he left you for her use."</p>

<p>The honest tradesman approached the table and
took up a pen. He perused and signed the document 
without a word, scowled heavily at his wife to
impose silence on her, and then advanced towards the
door. "I suppose, ma'am," he said gruffly, "that
now I've done what you've asked, I may depend upon
your saying nothing to his lordship. I want to renew
my lease, and I've a large family. I'm a hard-working 
chap, a little rough may be, but my rent is safe,
and I pay my taxes reg'lar. 'Taint my fault if my
missus and the girl couldn't agree."</p>

<p>"I am sure, George!" began his wife.</p>

<p>"Silence! you fool! D'ye want to ruin me with
that tongue of yourn. It was you did all the mischief 
along of Mary. After all, the girl wasn't so
bad, and a precious sight better than any you've
picked up with since."</p>

<p>It was a hard struggle for his lady, but she had the
sense to hold her tongue this time; for she feared the
weight of her affectionate husband's arm, when his
wrath was fairly aroused by a pecuniary loss.</p>

<p>"See that you use the poor creature, your present
servant, well," was the answer, "and I promise not
to interfere. His lordship shall grant you a yearly

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

tenancy from September next." (The tradesman's evil
countenance fell.) "And I will pledge myself he will
not disturb you, if you do not make the treatment of
your servants a scandal to the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>The man stood irresolute, and then muttering,
"Good morning, my lady!" went out; and his wife
followed him to their chaise, which was drawn by a
half-starved horse. But before she went, she said,</p>

<p>"I wish to mention, as it's only right I should, that
the girl has breakings out. I was always afraid of
my children catching it. But perhaps you've got
none."</p>

<p>It may be observed that Mrs. Nixon firmly believed
she had, having caught a glimpse of the little girl.
The breaking out to which she alluded arose from
poverty of blood. The whole family were ill-fed, with
the exception of the man himself; but not to the
extent of their wretched servant-girls. The wife
was drunken, and could neither market properly, nor
cook, nor even superintend cooking. Now and then
they would have a feast, when waste and extravagance 
were the order of the day. Generally, they
sent to the cook-shop, or would have a boiled ham
in the house.</p>

<p>That evening the neighbours of that amiable pair
were disturbed by loud and protracted screaming and
wailing, first in a small feeble treble, and afterwards
in a fuller key and with a louder volume of sound.
It was first of all occasioned by Mrs. Nixon beating
her new or last servant-of-all-work, a child of fourteen; 
and then by the lady receiving some chastisement 
from the British fist of Mr. N. himself, which

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

ended in violent hysterics on her part. The swearing
on both sides was awful, and very edifying to the
children. The next day, the new servant was thrust
forth into the street, and went with a pitiful tale of
hunger to the shop of the nearest baker, a kind-hearted 
man, who gave her some food; but who dared
not interfere in the concerns of the bullying and
braggart Nixon. This sort of cowardice is perhaps
necessarily extended widely in the present state of
the community. Every one fears publicity, an action
at law, a police report, and the newspapers. Every
one is busy, and has a thousand reasons for not being
Quixotic. The struggle for existence makes us all
selfish. Imagine any one in a forest, or a desert, finding 
two little children astray and leaving them there
to their own devices. Does such an inhuman monster 
exist? Yet it is a thing that we cheerfully do
in London, and scarcely retain a recollection of the
fact. If any one should interfere with two little
toddlers of three and four years of age astray down
Holborn-hill, it would probably be some old woman
bent on stripping them of their clothes, if they were
worth stripping, or the police, who might roughly
convey them to the station with a very bad grace.
A man like Nixon, hated and feared on every side,
enjoys a vast amount of impunity, and is much
better treated than any worthy or honest man of
his rank, whilst he is not so much cheated and
makes better bargains. He lets it be known that
he has a solicitor, and would bring an action against
any one who gave him the slightest opportunity. He
would like any one to kick him, or strike him, or call

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

him a scoundrel. But the reptile would crawl in the
mire before a lord.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mr. and Mrs. Nixon taken their departure, 
and the little girl of whom we spoke commenced 
her reading under Mrs. Wilmington's patient
tuition, when two gentlemen were announced, the
Reverend Mr. Hindle and a friend. Mr. Hindle, an
esteemed friend of Mrs. Wilmington, introduced the
other, a dignified and venerable man, as the Archdeacon 
of Filey.</p>

<p>"The archdeacon, my dear lady," said Mr. Hindle,
"has been anxious to make your acquaintance ever
since the evening when you delivered that truly
Christian and impassioned address at the Bermondsey
school-room, on the want of sisterly charity in our
present state of society. The archdeacon read the
report, which was indeed admirably done."</p>

<p>"That reporter was quite accidentally there," said
Mrs. Wilmington. "Had I known it, probably I
should not have spoken at all."</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear madam," observed Mr. Hindle.
"I consider it, and so does the archdeacon I am
sure, a most fortunate circumstance, which thus drew
out gifts so remarkable, and which I trust may yet
be consecrated to the service of Heaven, as your life
and fortune have for long been in so eminent a
degree."</p>

<p>"I hope, madam, that you will deliver another
lecture ere long," said the archdeacon. "I came here
to suggest St. James's Hall, and I hope it will be
soon; for I leave London about ten days hence, and
I shall be greatly disappointed, if I do not hear you.

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

I am told by my friend here, that he never heard
such fervid diction, such thrilling power of appeal to
the better feelings of our nature. He says that your
whole audience were affected to tears. And all this
unstudied and improvised!"</p>

<p>The lady shook her head. "I am sorry, venerable
sir, to act contrary to any wish expressed by you; but
it is not my intention to appear in this manner in
public again."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Mr. Hindle, "you surely cannot
refuse. With such gifts, such genius, surely it is
absolutely wrong to refuse to consecrate them to the
service of Heaven and your fellow-creatures in the
manner you have so brilliantly inaugurated."</p>

<p>"I am told," said the archdeacon, "that you have
it at your option to do great good by the exercise of
your remarkable powers. I will not, however, presume 
to attempt to influence you, until I have heard
your reason for a determination which I must own
seems strange and has taken me by surprise, after the
extraordinary impression produced by your inaugural
attempt."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington sat deeply reflecting for a few
moments, during which her countenance expressed
varied and successive emotions. There might have
been a transient glance of gratified vanity and triumph; 
if so, it speedily gave place to a strange look
of pain, a dark and troubled shade, as if a cloud
passed over a laughing and limpid stream, and the
chill of autumn evening had suddenly succeeded to
the reign of spring. Lastly, a soft and subdued
melancholy lent an inexpressible charm to her face,

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

and melted into a moonlit smile. She was like an
ideal effigy of widowhood scattering flowers on a
tomb.</p>

<p>"I do not think," she said, "that it is the province
of my sex to address public assemblies on social or
religious questions. If it be, it is not so in a case
like mine. I am speaking wholly apart from my own
feelings in the matter, but not from my own reason,
and the instinctive monitor within. I feel that it is
not right; but I say so apart from any self-sacrifice I
might make. You, at least, are fully aware, and
I presume that the venerable archdeacon knows
something of the nature of my&mdash;my&mdash;earlier life.
Shall I set up my standard as a teacher? Consider
already some of the remarks elicited. It is not how
they may affect me, but the high and holy object
which I trust I have in view. My reparation should
be as silent and secret, as my sins and errors have
been public. If the truth of my repentance be
doubted even by scoffers, do you not think that evil
instead of good may result? Venerable sir! I forgot
<i>myself</i>, when I upbraided Society with its Pharisaical
sins and cruel coldness that night. I cannot always
forget myself&mdash;and others will never forget. What
will they say of me? That it is a new line of acting&mdash;a 
new excitement. And if my sincerity is impeached, 
I become a fashion, a folly, and thus even,
ultimately, a disgrace. No; if women take up this
great and holy cause in public, which if banded together 
in a charitable league they can best effect
separately and at home, let them at least be those
against whom hypocrisy and scandal cannot fling a

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

stone. The mission of a Magdalen cannot be to instruct 
those who have never fallen, never been
tempted, in their duty either to Heaven or to their
fellow-creatures. If I were to lecture in public, the
very fashion of my dress would be criticised&mdash;if I
dressed in the ordinary costume of a lady, I should be
blamed, if in the severest or simplest manner, it would
be alike cavilled at. If my eloquence were all that the
kind good pastor here" (turning to Mr. Hindle) "describes 
it and more, it would be deemed the success
of an actress. In short, I feel that the whole effect
would be a mistake, and its most signal triumph only
the greater injury to the cause of the suffering sisterhood 
of shame."</p>

<p>The venerable archdeacon, a man of nearly eighty
years of age, rose, and impressively laid his hand upon
the speaker's braided hair.</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear child!" he said, "and
our judgment is rebuked. I came here," he continued, 
"entertaining some lingering doubts as to
your character and motives. I own it, in spite of the
earnest eulogy of my old friend. I shall go away,
even at my advanced age, with more elevated and
broader views of humanity. You have kindled a
spark of enthusiasm in the heart of an aged churchman. 
I thank you! My curiosity is rebuked. If I
feel humbled at the thought of my suspicion and
narrow ideas, you have, I repeat, elevated my conception 
of the innate goodness of the human heart.
I thank you much. I have heard of your deeds of
charity and good."</p>

<p>At this moment the servant announced "Father

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

Nelia." A little pleasant-looking man of some
sixty summers or thereabouts toddled briskly in, and
took both of Mrs. Wilmington's hands between his.
"Come va, Signora mia carissima," he said. "Come
sta ella? Bene?" and he then looked round and
saluted the archdeacon and his friend.</p>

<p>The former, for a moment, had gathered himself
up in a species of dignified alarm. He was a staunch,
uncompromising Protestant. A slight shade of pain
manifested itself on Mrs. Wilmington's face. The
archdeacon hesitated, but for an instant. He advanced 
with frank courtesy and offered his hand to
the little man, who held it and raised it instinctively
half-way to his lips.</p>

<p>"I have heard of your benevolence and noble
qualities, sir," said the archdeacon, "and I am glad
of this opportunity of making your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Here is the benevolence, my dear sir," responded
the other, looking towards Mrs. Wilmington. "I
do but labour in my&mdash;what you call&mdash;vocazione, yes.
But she is so good. E vero. Si! sei un' angelo!
Tacete! I sail tell what you 'ave done for my poor
peoples, les Savoyards! Monsignor, I 'ave very
poor peoples to see, and she is their ange gardien;
she makes de soupes, de potage, de vermicelli, oh! so
strong. Ha! ha! De leetel Domenichino, he vill
say his prayer no more to de Madonna, bot to you.
She is ver veeked, you know, she make herself de
idol of my poverini! Si!"</p>

<p>The archdeacon had never met a Roman Catholic
clergyman on terms of amity before; and he again
felt a slight twinge, a little premonitory flying gout-like 

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

tweak of conscience. An hour ago, if any one
had proposed to him to meet Father Nelia, he would
have lifted his pastoral stick in anger at the very
thought. He was in a new atmosphere, and succumbed 
to its influence. Before he left, he actually
consented to visit the good little priest, and asked
him to dinner, luckily not on a Friday, in Eaton-square.</p>

<p>Father Nelia approved highly of Mrs. Wilmington's 
decision not to appear again in public.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, "she sall not 'ave some fools
of peoples insult her! It vould not do at all. They
vould not onderstand questo cuore magnifico. She is
not a cantatrice, not a singer of de teatro, she sing to
de poor peoples in bed&mdash;she sing in de houses of
de abbandonati, de desolati&mdash;not de gobe-mouches
who sall stare her out of face. De Inglis, perdonatemi, 
dey vant all de charity in public, in de
giornali, till dey 'ave none left for de private use.
Dey fancy dat il buon Dio, he read de newspapers,
de affiches, vat you call advertisements of de 'Times,'
over his chocolate in de morning. Bot it is deeferent,
n'est-ce pas, monsignor?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon had never met with religion in so
lively a shape before. But he owned that evening
that he had learned something even from the eccentricities 
of the worthy Father Nelia; had turned
over a page as yet unread by him in the great folio
of universal charity and the religion of the heart.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, Mrs. Wilmington narrated
to the two clergymen the behaviour of Mr. and Mrs.
Nixon to their niece Mary. She did not say how

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

nobly she had rescued that poor young creature from
despair and suicide. Sometimes this good Samaritan
would put on her bonnet and shawl with a thick
veil, and go out late in the evening and wander
about the streets alone. In the course of her rambles,
she would relieve many a suffering wretch. She had
a marvellous faculty of distinguishing between real
and assumed distress. She seemed familiar with the
gestures of despair, and to recognise the moan of
desertion and want with the subtle instincts of a Red
Indian on the war-path. Only hers was a path of
peace. How was this? Our readers do not need to
be informed. They already recognise in Mrs. Wilmington 
her who has already figured so strangely in
these pages, the fortunate unfortunate Kitty Dareall,
the street pariah, the outcast mother, the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e
of the eccentric young nobleman, the once brilliant
actress, the dictatress of the "mode" to the frivolous
world of fashion, the reprover of Aubrey, the legatee
of the deaf old duke, and the true-hearted woman
throughout all. She did not tell the venerable
clergymen, who only imagined that her antecedents
were those of a modern Lais, and that she spent her
large income, with the exception of her bare plain
living in Guilford-street, in good deeds&mdash;she did not
tell them, we say, how she had figuratively held back
Mary by the hem of her torn garments from plunging 
beneath those dark arches, where so many young
creatures, formed for love and happiness, have been</p>

<p class="small">Glad to death's mystery<br/>

Swift to be hurled&mdash;<br/>

Anywhere! anywhere!<br/>

Out of the world.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

<p>She did not say how she had soothed and cherished
that forlorn and faded wretch, after indignantly
snatching her from the brutal grasp of one of the
trained hounds, whom the rich and powerful in this
civilised country employ to hunt down misery far
more effectively than crime, and who do their work
as thoroughly and gleefully in this free land, as any
Cuban bloodhound let loose on the track of the sensational 
fugitive slave. Her well-filled purse had
saved her from the otherwise inevitable consequences
of this act of female Quixotism. She did not impart
all this, or the details of the succour which she
afforded to the life-weary, hunted-down girl. But
she did mention the conduct of Nixon and his appropriate 
helpmeet.</p>

<p>"Can it be wondered at," she said, "that the
papers are full of complaints of the misconduct and
inefficiency of the lower order of domestics, when
the human drudge is treated with such brutality?
The servant is too often dealt with as out of the pale
of humanity by vulgarians, whose meanness, vanity,
folly, and wickedness it is impossible for persons of
any pretensions to culture, even to imagine. The
simple statement of an orphan workhouse girl is
sometimes so entirely beyond the credence of those
unacquainted with the details of small trading domestic 
life, that a 'worthy magistrate' refuses to
believe her statements. Her story is 'too unlikely;'
and the modern Mrs. Brownrigg, if she has stopped
short of actual and apparent murder, escapes in
triumph."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

<p>"I fear," said the archdeacon, "that in many, if
not most cases, the mistresses are unable to teach
their servants anything beneficial or useful. In my
boyish days, my mother repaired to her kitchen regularly 
after breakfast, and my grandmother's book of
receipts in her own handwriting was worth something, 
I can tell you. Their correspondence about a
dinner or supper was as earnest as any in the modern
times about the latest fashions of London or Paris.
Then, economy was practicable&mdash;it is not so now. A
lady has no knowledge wherewith to contend against
a professed cook. In those days, waste could be in
great measure checked. Now it is one of the scandals
of the day."</p>

<p>"True," said Mr. Hindle. "I am certain that
there is sufficient food actually destroyed in the houses
of the great and wealthy to furnish all the poor in
England. It is to me a terrible and awful reflection.
Both around our large towns and in country residences, 
the destruction of fruit and vegetables is
enormous. There is enough allowed to rot in the
luxurious gardens of the rich to supply the army of
Xerxes all the year round. Imagine a selfish, invalid
couple with three or four acres of garden-ground,
tasting a strawberry or two during the season, as
Brummel once ate a pea; and this surrounded by a
mining, brickmaking, or nailing district. Do these
people ever think of distributing their superfluous
blessings? Do they ever make a crowd of poor
schoolboys or schoolgirls happy?"</p>

<p>"Very seldom, I fear," said Mrs. Wilmington.

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

"They would tell you, if they condescended to consider 
such a thing at all, that it would lead to idleness 
and thieving."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Father Nelia, "dat I once
asked a padrone of a great hotel of de most successful, 
vere dere finds itself every night a crowd
enormous to eat de bifteck and de choppe con patate,
you know&mdash;I did ask him vat he do vid all de debris.
He said it vent ai porconi, to de peegs. I say vat for
you not give it ai poveri, to de poor? 'Not so green,
not such sciocco,' he say. 'I vould 'ave a crowd
at my door.' 'E perch&egrave; no?' I say. 'Den my
servants vould rob me,' he reply; as if dey do not
rob him now."</p>

<p>"There is no country," said the archdeacon,
"where there is such waste in everything as in
England&mdash;waste in food, in material, in labour, in
treasure, in ships, in horses, in men and women, in
children, alas! in human life. Nay, we waste our
coal, our manure; we enrich the sea with the vital
essences of reproduction, and get in return the cholera
and abundance of white-bait. Lastly, we waste intellect, 
invention, genius, prestige, all the gifts which
Heaven has endowed us with as a nation, and too
often our immortal part, in the lust and struggle for
gain."</p>

<p>"Many of these things," observed Mrs. Wilmington, 
"are far beyond my province to understand;
but reasoning from what I do know, I believe that
you are right in all. With the various troubles of
my own sex I have chiefly to deal, and when I find
their state so appalling as it too frequently is, I can

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

easily imagine that there is something very wrong
with the whole community. I do not believe that
woman is so degraded, in any barbarous country,
as she is even in her virtuous state in the mining and
manufacturing districts of England&mdash;I mean by that,
her state of wife and mother. One has only to listen
to the language of holiday folk in these districts, to
recognise the depravation of all. Now and then a
fine nature crops up. There is plenty of reckless
courage among the men, and of animal fondness
among the women. Nature is not yet stamped out
from among them. But, oh! the story of the towns!
The cry that goes up to Heaven from Birmingham
and Manchester, that curdles with horror the affrighted 
sky! Can we wonder that even Mormonism
possesses charms in the eyes of creatures whose souls
and bodies are alike starved?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the archdeacon, "what can any one
do to stem the tide of profligacy, of ruin, and of
wrong? Preaching is vain; example profitless,
did it exist; repression the mocking task of the
Fiend."</p>

<p>"Example," said Mrs. Wilmington, "without sympathy, 
is, I own, of little aid. But if the daughters
of affluence would combine, not only to succour, but
prevent; if they would approach the lost and fallen
with tenderness, and reserve their scorn and fiercest
reprobation for the seducer, the profligate, the cruel
libertine, the systematic debauchee, <i>then</i>, there might
be some hope of improvement."</p>

<p>"That is it," said Mr. Hindle; "that is precisely
what I was so anxious you should teach with the extraordinary 

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

gift of eloquence, which Providence has
bestowed on you for good."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington shook her head. "Let me labour
after my own fashion," she said, "and let those lead
the crusade who are born to such high emprise. I
aspire to be but an unknown pioneer in the great
Amazonian army marching to the emancipation of
the enthralled sisterhood of frailty, necessity, and
shame; that sisterhood whose shrill wail rises nightly
amid the gleam of white arms and spectral faces, and
the drift of dishevelled hair, from the crime-stained
cities, and polluted villages of this want-smitten and
wealth-ridden land. Let the triumphant march of
that army pass over my unseen grave, and its angelic
shout of victory will thrill through me, as it does
now: thrill through my forgotten dust, were I 'earth
in an earthy bed.' "</p>

<p>As she spoke, her features seemed to stiffen into
marble, and the colour of her eyes deepened, and her
mass of light-brown hair, which had accidentally been
shaken somewhat loose from its simple tie, gave the
slightest possible suggestion of a halo and a glory
round her small head and expressive face. As she
spoke, she had risen impulsively, and as she uttered
the last words of the speech which we have endeavoured 
so imperfectly to record, the sunbeams
poured a full flood of light through a breaking cloud
and streamed through the heavy-curtained window
of that dusky and gloomy room, illuminating her
form like that of a saint pictured on the stained
glass in some cathedral nave. Her three visitors
rose simultaneously and in silence. The archdeacon

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

looked on in surprise. At this moment a street
organ of peculiar sweetness of tone was played a little
way off.</p>

<p>"The music of the poor!" she said. "Even that
they would cut off and take away. I have danced
to that very tune, when a very small sickly child,
along with a crowd of other children in a blind
alley on a cool summer night. There was a blue
narrow strip of sky above us and one star of pale
gold, which I said was mine. Every little dirty
outcast there claimed it too, I remember. It was all
that we knew of Heaven. The music was our only
boon on earth. The swarthy foreigner smiled on us.
Perhaps he thought of other children in his own distant 
land. He loved us better, than did all the hard
task-masters, the prosperous, smiling lords and ladies
of our native country. Why do they not roof out
even God's sky from the children of the poor? It
encourages them to think themselves better than
their fate, equal in the sight of Heaven, as they will
be hereafter; but not now. Why should the tones
of an instrument played by foreign hands teach their
ears an acuter perception of the harshness of the
accents of their more prosperous fellow-citizens at
home? At home, where? In the gaol, the hospital,
the workhouse, and the grave? Away with the
music of the poor! Silence it! Banish it! Lock
it up! Put it down with the harsh grating voice of
the machinery of 'Order' and the 'Law!' It is
better not to awaken thought, or hope, or love. In
France an empress visits the lowest of the lost&mdash;braves 
contact with physical and moral contagion,

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

and survives, protected by the wings of invisible
angels, to press her child, startled by the thunder of
a nation's applause, closer in joy and queen-like confidence, 
to her breast. The ladies of England copy
the fashion of her skirt; nay, the very colour of her
hair. Can they not make charity a 'fashion;' sympathy 
a new pattern of the heart? Send us, oh great
and merciful Providence! a revolution of soul, ere a
revolution of blood and flame be reflected in the
clouds of wrath gathering over our heads. I know
the bitterness of the strong mechanic's weary heart,
the evil passions of the gaunt and wolfish throng, the
felon populace of injustice and wrong, of ignorance
and neglect. If ever that storm break over England,
there will be no mercy shown to those who have held
themselves aloof, and the innocent will perish with
the guilty, and perish <i>first</i>. And oh! the women
that will be avenged! I see the living ghosts of man's
perjury and profligacy turned into ghouls and shrieking 
'Death! death!' to those who have made them
suffer, and those who have looked calmly and complacently 
on their sufferings. I see them roaming
maddened over the broad pavements worn by the
footsteps of the hundreds and thousands of their sex,
who have died a living death during a century of
woe, and their lips and arms drip with blood! There
has been blood drunk from the gutters of scaffolds
ere now. What can they expect who destroy and
unsex?" She clasped her hands over her head, and
sank back exhausted on the sofa from which she had
risen. At this moment the little girl entered the

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

door, and ran up to her benefactress, whose hand she
clasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear lady! my dear lady!" she cried.</p>

<p>Father Nelia made a sign to the others to withdraw; 
but before retiring with them, he rang the bell,
and gave a few brief instructions to Mary. The
three clergymen of different persuasions, and more
than different ceremonial forms&mdash;for Mr. Hindle was
a Unitarian minister of considerable fame&mdash;paused to
exchange a few words in the street. The archdeacon
owned himself deeply affected and impressed.</p>

<p>"Is she thus excited often?" he said.</p>

<p>"Very rarely," replied Mr. Hindle; "I have never
witnessed her so much moved before."</p>

<p>"I have, once," said Father Nelia. "It is one
great good reason why it cannot be that she give
public letture, lecture what you call."</p>

<p>"Nor," said Mr. Hindle, "is the British public
at all prepared for such denunciations. I believe in
the truth of nearly all that she says. But she would
not be understood, and her denunciations and exhortations 
would do more harm than good. Cassandra
could not save Troy, nor Solomon Eagle avert the
Plague."</p>

<p>"Her benevolent ministrations are, I believe, unexampled?" 
said the archdeacon in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"She has an income of three thousands pounds a
year; and I speak within the mark," replied Mr.
Hindle, "when I say that nine-tenths of it are spent
in the rescue of unfortunate women, and in charitable
deeds of every kind. And all this is done without

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

the slightest ostentation, and involves her constant
personal attention and care."</p>

<p>"I have been told," said the archdeacon, "the
source whence she derived her wealth. That is a
matter greatly to be regretted; but it is well that she
makes such a use of it."</p>

<p>"Let me assure you of one thing," rejoined Mr.
Hindle, "with which it is right you should be acquainted. 
That her antecedents are stainless is unhappily 
far from being the case. This, you must
have gathered from her own admissions and speech.
But in the case to which you have referred, that
is, the extraordinary legacy of the dissipated old
nobleman who placed at her disposal the money of
which she makes such pious use, I know for a certainty, 
and can pledge my word, that whatever may
be thought or alleged to the contrary by the world,
the bequest was as pure and sacred as it could be,
coming from such a source. The late Duke of
Chalkstoneville made her acquaintance when she was
on the stage, and when he was at a very advanced
period of life. He conceived a singular regard for
her, and took great pleasure in her company and
conversation. In fact, latterly, he could not bear
her to be away from his side. The commencement
of the acquaintance was probably of the nature of an
ordinary one made by a man of his stamp. But
about that time, she herself, from some cause or other,
completely, and as I have learnt from her, for the
second time in her life, altered her mode of existence
and conduct. The first time, she told me, it was from
feeling; the second from conviction. The duke became 

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

very ill and feeble; and she exercised over his
latter days a most wonderful and purifying effect.
He died a thoroughly repentant man. Before dying,
he would have married her, in defiance of all obstacles, 
in order to leave her his vast personal property, 
but this she firmly and very properly refused.
As you are aware, he left large sums to charities
entirely through her. She might have had all the
money over which he had control, had she been so
inclined."</p>

<p>"It is a very remarkable tale," said the archdeacon; 
"and had I not witnessed her enthusiasm
and eloquence in addition to being acquainted with
some of her good actions, I might have entertained
the belief that you had been deceived. There is
reason then to imagine that her intimacy with the
late duke was of a purely Platonic character?"</p>

<p>"I am convinced of it," was Mr. Hindle's reply.</p>

<p>"Anch' io," said the father, "I am as sure as if
I had heard it under the sacred seal of confession
itself."</p>

<p>The archdeacon involuntarily started. In what
company did he find himself? A priest of the Church
of Rome actually talking of the confessional. Father
Nelia saw what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>"Scusatemi, monsignor!" he said; "if you vish
to forget dat you have by accident made de acquaintance 
of a poor priest of a different faith, he
vill not seek to intrude upon you&mdash;perhaps it vill be
for de best. He vill remember you in his prayers,
and hope to meet you in anoder vorld, and vere,
perhaps, it shall be found as de best religion is

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

dat vich is de best administered in deeds of charity 
and love."</p>

<p>"Now Heaven forbid!" said the archdeacon,
"that I should show the spirit of a narrow sectarian.
Come and see me often, father, I beg; and that you
may come often, come soon, remembering what an
old man I am."</p>

<p>Little Father Nelia shook the hand of the tall and
venerable ecclesiastic with much warmth. Certainly
the spirit of that charity, without which all other
professed religion is as sounding brass or a tinkling
cymbal, was present that day among those three men.
They parted greatly satisfied with each other, and
pondering over what they had heard and seen.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE PARK WHICH IS NOT THE PEOPLE'S.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Hyde Park, in relation to the people, reminds me of a child's toy,
with which his paternal government does not allow him to play, because
it is too good for him&mdash;a huge frosted plum-cake bestowed on him by
his grandfather, which his pastors and masters daily devour, and of
which he is lucky to get a crumb on Sundays. After all, the good-natured, 
busy mechanic has surrendered the Park to his "betters" so
long, with perfect good humour and acquiescence, that it has passed out
of his possession by custom. Only when he does want it a little, just
a little now and then, to flourish the inalienable right of a free Briton
to speechify, when he feels aggrieved, it seems alike harsh and impolitic,
not to say ungracious and ungrateful, to question a privilege which is
only dangerous when opposed. There is no more harm likely to be done
to the flower-beds in the Park by a Reform meeting under the permission 
and with the assistance of the Government, than by a Volunteer
review or illuminations for peace. Do not the remnants of aged trees
invite stump oratory? When the safety and prosperity of the great
State steam-ship is best insured by a moderate and dignified rate of
progression, it does seem absurd for the officers to sit weeping on the
safety-valve, whilst heaping on the unnecessary fuel of a nation's wrath.&mdash;<i>Notes 
on Passing Events</i>.</p>

<p>"IT'S a fine thing to be a wine-merchant," observed
Mr. Stingray, as a gentleman gorgeously got-up drove
a splendidly appointed curricle past the sage and a
friend, who were both lounging near the corner of
Rotten Row, by Apsley House, in the Park. To
look at him, any one would have thought him a
duke or marquis at least&mdash;at least any one who happened 

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

to be ignorant of modern life. "That pair of
horses," said Stingray, "cost at least five hundred
guineas. And the mischief of it is, there is nothing 
wrong or snobbish in the turn-out. Perhaps
the neatest thing now-a-days in the whole lot of
equipages out, is the property of a quack surgeon.
Such a man formerly would have had a pair of piebald 
horses from Astley's, and a carriage of the
gaudiest description, which he would have used as
part of his stock-in-trade. No such thing now. The
said quack drops the shop, I can tell you, when
he comes out. He is as good-looking a fellow as was
ever <i>abonn&eacute;</i> at Truefitt's. There's no keeping money
out, I can tell you. And if you meet the elegant
Noses, youthful scion of the boot and shoe establishment 
of that name, ten to one he will insinuate that
he comes of the Noseses of Devonshire, an old Spanish
family settled in England at the time of the Armada.
When your friend Wilkins, who himself gave up
shop-keeping for the militia, introduces Noses, he
whispers, 'Don't be afraid that there is any connexion
with the Houndsditch folk. He is of the De Noses,
or rather Nosez (you know how names are altered
in the course of centuries), very talented fellow, I
assure you&mdash;is likely to be in the ministry, great
favourite of Pam!' As if he cared, or you cared, or
any one cared, so that Noses has the talents of gold,
ha! ha! and the shekels of silver; but we Britishers
like to seem to care about such things."</p>

<p>"You don't shoot, I think," said Stingray's friend,
in whose ears the sage might have been thought to
have been distilling poison, seeing that he was an

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

aristocratic parvenu of the latest type. No such danger,
since it was the pleasure of the gentleman in question
to affect the airs of a noble of the <i>sangre azul</i>, utterly
forgetting that in reality that his uncle, who laid the
foundations of the fortunes of the entire family, was
a City alderman and linendraper, and had once been
an errand-boy.</p>

<p>"Do I shoot?" said Stingray. "What! assist at
the 'partridge-hunt,' like a mossoo, do you mean;
bring down the 'long tails' and all that, and slaughter
the bunny rabbit and the hare? My dear fellow,
I'm thankful to say that I never fired off a gun in
my life. But make a note, if you are given to that
benignant sport, that I like game. Put it down in
your note-book for September and October, and may
'le sport' be kind, according as you act on the
remembrance."</p>

<p>"Well, last year," said his friend, "I accepted an
invitation for two days to accompany a friend of
mine, a City man, a very warm swell, to shoot at
Mokeham Spinneys for a couple of days, and stay at
Lord de Mokeham's house. I hadn't an idea of the
arrangement before I went down&mdash;didn't know but
that De Mokeham would be there himself. So I put
myself in the train and down I went. I got a dog-cart 
at the station and joined the party at the Spinneys, 
who were popping away in the most approved
style. A gentlemanly-looking old fellow, togged in
a grey-shooting suit, said to me as I entered a ride in
the wood, 'Mr. Welby's friend, I suppose?' I bowed.
'Will you stand there?' he continued, 'they are
beating down this way.' I at once acquiesced. 'Who

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

can the old fellow be?' thought I. 'Shouldn't wonder
if it is De Mokeham&mdash;<i>must</i> be De Mokeham; wish I
had called him "my lord." ' At that moment the
fun began. Down came the beaters, out flew the
pheasants; very pretty sport, I can tell you. There
were ten guns, including myself, and we bagged
nearly two hundred brace, all cocks, with a few
muffish exceptions, that day, and a hundred and
three hares, besides four couple and a half of wood-cocks, 
and five brace of birds. But you're not attending."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Stingray, "one reads that
sort of thing of all manner of shooting snobs any day
in the season in the newspapers. I never care to
count game, except from a basket, carriage-paid."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said the other. "After we had
polished off that lot, Welby found me out. He came
up with the old fellow in light grey. 'How are you?'
he said. 'Allow me to introduce my friend Baggs.
Baggs, Frodsham, Frodsham, Baggs!' and so on.
'Then it is not De Mokeham?' I said to Welby, as
soon as I had an opportunity. 'De Mokeham, no!
whatever put that into your head?' asked Welby.
'Isn't his lordship here?' I inquired. 'Not he, poor
devil. Don't he wish he could be?' 'Where
is he?' said I. 'Where is he? That's what a good
many would like to know. Anywhere from Boulogne
to Stockholm, or Queensland, for all I can tell,' replied 
Welby. 'I should think Queensland a very
likely spot?' 'And who's Baggs?' said I. 'What!
don't you know Baggs's patent goloshes?' 'To be
sure,' I replied, 'had a pair last winter; got 'em now.'

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

'Well, he's the sole patentee. Inventor cut his
throat in Whitecross-street; parted with it for a
mere song.' Up sauntered a very dashing fellow just
as he said this, and I was introduced to him. He
had just come over from Norway in his schooner
yacht, I found. He turned out to be Beddowes of
the celebrated upholstery firm of Beddowes and Bolster
in Bond-street. 'Thorough sportsman,' said Welby.
'No man living, not even Francis Francis, can tie a
fly better; and he shot ties with Lord Nobblehall at
the last Hurlingham sweep-stakes.' The next was a
youthful swell in a black velvet suit and knickerbockers, 
who looked like a Spanish noble, and only
wanted a guitar instead of a gun, and a cloak thrown
negligently over his shoulder, as he leant gracefully
against a gate-post at the end of a ride. He turned
out to be Foulard, of the great Regent-street house,
Foulard and Twichet. To cut it short, there was
Binks of Binks's British Marble Emporium, and
young Armlet, of Armlet and Longstick, the jewellers
in Piccadilly, and, in fact, when we entered a marquee
where a first-rate collation was served up, there was
only one of the party left whose firm I did not know.
'I'll bet I guess who he is,' I whispered to Welby.
'He's either Mortnum or Fason for a fiver.' But he
turned out to be a neighbouring squire come over for
the day. You've no idea how these fellows did the
thing. They had a drag at Mokeham Hall, which
they rented together with the shooting, and paid
two thousand pounds a-year among the lot. Two
hundred pounds each. I couldn't help thinking of
the poor, proud nobleman, a wanderer and exile,

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

whilst his roof-tree rang to the shouts and jokes of
these West-end tradesmen. Mais, que voulez vous?
They're the boys for the moors, and the salmon-fisheries, 
and the deer-stalking, now-a-days. The
Prince of Wales, I'm told, has been to one of Foulard's 
smoking symposia."</p>

<p>"Look there!" cried Stingray. "Do you know
that lady in a white alpaca trimmed with blue, with
that heavy lace fall? I mean in the britzska there,
with that beautiful young girl? Who do you think
that is, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Can't say&mdash;is it the new Lady Fitzpavin or
Madame Turquoise, who has just arrived from Paris?
She is handsome enough for either, as far as I can
see for her veil."</p>

<p>"How do?" said Stingray, to a gentlemanly
young fellow, who passed him rapidly by, and who
returned his salutation politely, but carelessly enough.
"That's Edgar Leslie of the 'Morning Gun,' one
of the new sensational school of leader-writers, and
war-correspondent&mdash;you know what a fuss they
made about his letters&mdash;couldn't see much in them
myself."</p>

<p>"But the ladies?" inquired his companion.</p>

<p>"Oh! to be sure. Well, the tall one in the veil
is the celebrated Signora Bianca Stellini, who is to
astonish and enrapture us all to-morrow night at Her
Majesty's&mdash;the great singer of European fame. I
declare they have stopped and are talking to young
Leslie, fortunate dog."</p>

<p>"But who is the younger lady?" pursued the
other.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

<p>"Oh! nobody of course. A companion or sheep-dog, 
you know. Not a very distinguished r&ocirc;le to
play. These great singers are as full of megrims
and fancies as&mdash;good Heavens! what a shame to let
such people into the Park!" And Mr. Stingray
pointed to a gaunt and cadaverous, ill-clad looking
man, with shaggy beard and hair, who raised himself
from the turf, where he had been sleeping, and
who looked in a dazed and stupid manner around.
"What are the confounded police about?"</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that Mr. Stingray and his
friend had been slowly making their way along the
drive towards the Serpentine. Arthur Aubrey&mdash;for
it was he&mdash;had slept there since early morning.
Appalled at discovering himself thus environed by
the fashionable world, and utterly oblivious that no
one could possibly recognise him then, the unhappy
man looked around in vain for the chance of making
his exit. In doing so, he recognised the to him
obnoxious form of Stingray. That gentleman saw
an opportunity of making a little capital in his way.
A short distance off, approaching him on foot, he
saw the Bishop of Middlesex and his lady walking
with the gravity due to their respective positions in
Society and the Church. So he felt in his pocket
for some halfpence, and approached the recumbent
beggar as he deemed him to be. "Here, my good
friend!" he said, in the most benignant tones
he could assume, "take this, and the sooner you
get out of the Park, the better it will be for you."
Suiting the action to the words, he offered the
semi-recumbent Aubrey twopence-halfpenny. That

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

wretched being, scarcely awake, and wholly unconscious 
that Stingray had not the slightest idea of his
identity, took it for a wanton and malignant insult,
and leaping up with a cry like a wild beast, dashed
his fist right in the face of the astonished alms-giver,
felling him fairly to the ground. Then looking round
him, and seeing the faces of the fashionable crowd
turned upon him with an unendurable stare, he
stood a moment or two, as if expecting Stingray to
rise, a movement which that individual had not the
slightest idea of exercising without assistance, and
then swiftly rushed from the spot. No one around
sought to arrest his flight. As, however, he crossed the
carriage drive, he failed to clear the horses in the
Signora's carriage, and came in contact with the fore-quarters 
of one of them, which reared up, and as he
fell, narrowly missed trampling him under foot.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" cried the lady, rising, "what can
it mean?"</p>

<p>In an instant Aubrey had risen, and was speeding
away in the direction of the Marble Arch. Then
arose shouts and cries of "Stop thief! Stop him!
Knock him down! He's killed a man! Stop the
garotter! Hi!" Aubrey would have distanced every
one behind him, but his path was crossed. Half a
dozen policemen were running at the rate of cabs
engaged by the hour. Three or four flamingo-like
Life-Guardsmen joined in the pursuit.</p>

<p>"It's no use, if he wos Deerfut himself," cried a
pale man in dust-coloured garments, who rose also
from a recumbent position, in a carefully selected
spot where he had been taking a siesta, but not apparently 

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

after a full meal. "Mind vere yer agoin'
to, Bobby."</p>

<p>The policeman whom he addressed ran slowly on,
after aiming a deliberate kick at the speaker's head,
who, however, baulked his charitable intention by
rolling out of the way.</p>

<p>"Don't run so fast; you'll hurt yourself, arter that
last lot o' cold meat," shouted the Downy; for he it
certainly was. And rising up and giving a rapid
glance around, he suddenly hurled a large stone which
happened to be near at the policeman's head, in return
for the compliment, which laid that guardian of public
order at length upon the field. The Downy, amazed
at the success of his missile, immediately made tracks
for the nearest clump of trees. "I didn't think it
would 'ave 'it him," he said, "but it ain't his fault
them regulation boots of hisn didn't split my 'ead."</p>

<p>Strange what a difference exists in the public
estimate of actions. Had the policeman kicked the
Downy to death, it would have been hushed up without 
creating the slightest indignation or interest. The
sufferer would have been dragged off to a cell, and
in the morning there would have been a great difficulty 
in ascertaining how he came by his wound.
Seven policemen at least would have sworn that he
was drunk and incapable; but that they saw no marks
or blood when he was locked up. Had the policeman
died, in all probability our estimable friend, if caught,
would have swung for it in front of the Old Bailey,
and been painted as a ruffian of the most diabolical
type.</p>

<p>It would have been nothing but an ebullition of

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

zealous duty for the policeman to stave in the Downy's
skull, as he reclined in the "people's park," but for
the Downy to "heave 'arf a brick;" at him in return
for his intended compliment, that was a horse of a
different colour indeed.</p>

<p>To return to the flying Aubrey. He had already
been twice headed by volunteer foes, and his escape
appeared hopeless, when an accidental circumstance
occurred to baffle his pursuers. During his second
"double," Aubrey perceived a crowd gathered round
some one mounted on a seat, who appeared to be talking 
and gesticulating with great fervour. Instinctively 
he made for the throng, which, dense enough
in the middle, had many stragglers around. Suddenly
as he neared them a cry of "Hurroo! down with the
inimies of the Pope!" was uttered by a number of fellows 
armed with bludgeons, who commenced knocking
down indiscriminately every decently dressed personage 
within their reach. Stones and brickbats produced 
from sacks and the pockets of the aggressive
party were aimed at the crowd. It was a Garibaldian
eulogist and his hearers, attacked by the partisans
of the Papacy! For a moment Aubrey was succoured, 
that is, he escaped the attention of his own
pursuers. But an Irishman born in the Seven Dials,
seeing him without a hat, brought his shillelah down
with admirable accuracy of aim on his unprotected
head, and felled him insensible to the ground. In the
mean time the Downy had climbed a tree, whence he
surveyed the terrors and humours of the fight. A
strong body of the police appeared on the scene and
showed great activity in capturing several spectators

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

and persons accidentally there. The unprepared
Garibaldians were getting the worst of it, when a
party of about twenty Life-Guardsmen joined their
side. The build and size of these men seemed to
awe the diminutive Patlanders of St. Giles's. The
soldiers overtook them with huge strides, and in many
cases snatched their weapons from their hands and
soundly thrashed them therewith. When the original
disturbers of the peace were thoroughly beaten, the
police, who had in the mean time mustered in considerable 
numbers, made a savage onslaught on
the victors, who having merely fought, with the exception 
of the soldiers, in self-defence, were by no
means prepared to continue the contest, and became
easy victims to "order." The police, in fact, chiefly
befriended and avenged the heroes of St. Giles's, in
consequence whereof the magistrate, before whom the
captured and wounded were dragged, took a wholly
pro-Papist and anti-Garibaldian view of the matter,
and lectured, fined, and imprisoned several respectable 
men who had nothing to do with the matter,
save getting their heads broken by a gang of the
lowest desperadoes in London, impelled by the brutish
fanaticism of ignorance to make the attack. Among
the prisoners was Aubrey, who was carried on a
stretcher from the field to the hospital. As for police
constable 94 Z, the Goliath who had fallen a victim
to the escaped Downy, he was especially complimented
for his courage, determination, and zeal "in suppressing 
that which might otherwise have been a
serious <i>&eacute;meute</i>." At least several of the papers said
so, and we suppose that it was true.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

<p>The misadventure of Mr. Stingray caused a great
sensation among those of the fashionable throng who
were made aware of it. "Fortunately," as the papers
said, the carriage of the Bishop of Middlesex was
close at hand, and into it Mr. Stingray was induced
to get, to consider at leisure, whilst he was driven
home, whether he had not purchased the honour rather
dearly, and to ponder on the best remedy for a pair
of black eyes. The paragraphs headed "Mysterious
outrage in the Park," afforded next day some solace
to his philosophic mind, between the paroxysms of
vicious swearing in which he indulged, and which
would have done honour to the godly little town of
Jedburgh writhing in drouthy indignation under the
Forbes Mackenzie Act. It was edifying to us behind
the curtain to read the comments to which this occurrence 
gave birth.</p>

<p>"We regret to state, that the atrocious perpetrator
of the dastardly outrage upon the benevolent and
gifted writer, Mr. Stingray, is not yet in the hands
of justice. A clue, however, is stated to have been
obtained by one of the most active and intelligent
officers of our detective force, Superintendent Fluker
of the X Division."</p>

<p>The Park got fuller and fuller, and then emptier
and emptier. Sallow Cabinet Ministers had cantered
past sallower judges mounted on stout cobs. Loobies
on hired hacks took out their half-guinea's worth, to
the disgust of their noble steeds. Gentlemen with
tawny moustaches, and moustaches that were not
tawny, occasionally hid their heads by plunging
them inside various broughams, each with one fair

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

spirit for its occupant. Chawles, the predestined of
matrimony, had drawled out his last adieu to sweet
Maria, and turned his horse's head on devotion and
"twenty thou. down, sir, on the nail, by Jove!"
The fat old couple in a barouche had finished their
inevitable drive by the Serpentine&mdash;he with bushy
grey whiskers, and she with a poodle, who appeared
to have won the blue ribbon of wheezing fatness.
So had the thin old pair shut up in their gloomy
landau&mdash;he a lean and careworn invalid; she sour
and ascetic, and with no poodle or pet.</p>

<p>Lais, with yellow chignon, had driven her pair of
stepping bays home an hour ago. Rhodope, with
dark ambrosial curls, followed by cockaded groom,
with tongue thrust in his cheek and a leer in his gin-and-watery 
eye, had taken her last canter down
Rotten Row. Little Captain Cockerill, horse-dealer
and adjutant of Volunteers, had shown off his latest
ten-pound purchase with three white hocks and a
spavin, let us hope in vain; the hum of expectant
bathers rose in the misty air, ready to plunge in with
fleshy steam of unpleasant little bodies, so soon as
the clock should strike eight; a few soldiers were
busy lazily rowing the component parts of a pontoon
to and fro across the watery expanse, and tiny sails
neared the shore, to be hooked in by their owners
for the last time that night: big Newfoundlands
and yelping curs shook themselves over the muslin
dresses of young and middle-aged ladies apparently
devoted to religious promenades with certain puritans
of the Household Brigade; Mr. Weevil, solicitor's
clerk, who did not ride, seated himself by the nearest

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

and therefore most eligible veiled vestal and switched
the dust off his boots with his whip; the crowd of
those who had not dined, and who meant to dine,
had merged into the smoky unseen&mdash;those who had
most and best dinners with least and worst appetites,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, as the case might be. In fact, the
Park had become empty of nearly all, save cads, and
the females of their species, and the usual amount
of mere passers through, when a figure might have
been perceived dropping carefully from one of the
wide-spread lower branches of a chesnut-tree. That
individual took what might have been, but was not,
a meteorological observation, east, west, north and
south; and then commencing to whistle at the top
of his powers, which were great, struck into a path
which led to the nearest exit amid the greatest
number of pedestrians from the Park. Joining a
throng of ragamuffins outside, he listened eagerly
to a discussion on the skirmish which had just taken
place.</p>

<p>"I tell yer," said one fellow to another, "there's
three on 'em has got their gruel, and the surgeon has
guv 'em up for dead."</p>

<p>"Three!" muttered the unrepentant Downy; "he
wos big enough for three. It's a dispinsashun of
Prowidence that he didn't kick my nob hoff. But I
hope he ain't much hurt, for all that. At any rate,
he's paid for it, and they pensions the vidders of the
Force. They vouldn't have pensioned my vidder, if
he'd knocked the breath out of my carkis."</p>

<p>We are happy to be able to record that the injured
man was well enough to make the most of his broken

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

head, which went down to the general account, i.e.,
the account of Garibaldi and his sympathisers. Whatever 
may be the mysterious reason, it is certain that
it is grossly intolerant to resist a Papist zealot who
endeavours to break your head. It is gross indecency
to translate or even allude to some Papistical works
used in the colleges which are endowed by the money
of a Protestant (?) State. It is an outrage to object
to nunneries, which have increased tenfold in this
country within the last few years. Everything is
an outrage on one side, and nothing on the other.
This may be compromise&mdash;it looks like something
worse. We are not alluding to religious tenets, but
to the temporal, social, and political bearings of that
aggression which threatens England with internal
convulsions and civil war again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">TOPS IS LET INTO THE SECRET.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Can I keep a secret? Only try me. Tell me what it is, and I'll
advertise it in the "&mdash;&mdash;." And if it is ever heard of again, when
once there, I'll engage to read through the entire journal. I met the
proprietor the other day. "Hallo!" said I, "you ought to be obliged
to me." "What for?" he said. "Why," I answered, "I've just
doubled your circulation." "How do you mean?" he asked quite
briskly. "Why," said I, "I bought a copy this week, and I've just
torn it in two to wrap up a brace of parcels." Would you believe it,
the ungrateful humbug hailed an omnibus immediately and never gave
me an order for a theatre again?</p>

<p>"WASN'T it a rum start, Susan?" observed Mr.
Tops to that young lady, who had duly arrived and
exchanged new vows with her constant adorer. "You
see, in course, I might have picked up fifty letters,
and never so much as thought of looking at one.
This 'ere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say this 'ere&mdash;say this letter," interrupted
Susan.</p>

<p>"Well, this 'ere letter," continued Tops, with admirable 
simplicity.</p>

<p>"This letter," cried Susan.</p>

<p>"Well, I said this letter 'ere," rejoined Tops; "I
was agoing to say, it was stuck behind one of the

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

cushions of the 'mourning-coach,' as I call it. I was
going to take it in to the old chap, and had put it
in the harness room winder, until I had finished up,
when jest as I was giving the curbs a touch of the
dry leather, my eye fell quite permiscuous on the name
of Arthur Aubrey, Eskvire. 'By your leave,' says
I. So I made bold to read it, and a precious sight
of villainy I should say I found out."</p>

<p>"Nothing could have justified such an act, James,"
said the object of his affections, "but the circumstances 
of the case."</p>

<p>"So I've said a dozen times. After all said and
done, there was no seal broke, you know; and I
never meant so much as looking at it, considering, of
course, as I knowed to whom it belonged&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You 'knew,' you meant," said Susan.</p>

<p>"Yes, I meaned I knew," said Tops.</p>

<p>We shall not in future follow Susan's corrections
of her admirer's language. Suffice it to say, that she
did occasionally set him right.</p>

The pair were sitting in the boudoir, kitchen, and
ironing-room of Susan's future mother-in-law, Mrs.
Tops, than whom a more kindly, illiterate, and vulgar,
high-minded woman, there exists not in London at
this moment. The magnificence of that poor old
creature's soul was something astonishing. Sometimes 
she said that she, Martha Tops, would like to be
Queen of England, in order to show foreign guests,
especial royal and imperial "Hemperors, and sech
like," the glorious hospitality of John Bull. "There
was rubbish enough which she needn't name, she
hoped she knew her dooty better, entertained princely

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

here, and why send kings and queens as was our
guests to a hinn?" Some one had told this innocent
old lady the wonderful story of the groom-minister
of Bavaria, and she was never tired of imagining a
similar career for Tops. Add to this, that she had a
great respect and regard for Susan, mingled with
some awe in regard to that young person's superior
attainments, and we have said all that is necessary
of Mrs. Tops, who, on this occasion, had devised an
errand, in some vague connexion with, or oblique
relation to, certain imaginary mangling, and had in
reality gone to have a little weak gin-and-water, and
a gossip at her own particular bar.</p>

<p>"It's pretty nigh the time," said Tops, consulting
the silver warming-pan which had survived his uncle
in a double sense. "He's very punctual is the
Downy."</p>

<p>"Why do you think," asked Susan, "that there
is no possibility of its being Mr. Aubrey whom the
Downy has seen? I should think he's too sharp to
be easily mistaken."</p>

<p>Tops shook his head.</p>

<p>"I wish," he replied, "that I could believe it.
But, lor bless the girl! he was too proud to live,
when down on his luck like that, at least for long.
I'm sadly afraid it's all up with him long ago. I
don't much believe that he survived much after the
time I went to live with old Grinderby. I mean
when he gave me the slip so sudden. I'd give the
favourite for next year's Derby, if he was mine, to
know if the governor's alive or not, and what wouldn't
we give to find him?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

<p>"You'd say so, James, if you knew all," said Susan,
in a slow and earnest manner, looking full in her admirer's 
eyes.</p>

<p>"If I knew all?" inquired Tops. "I know a precious 
sight too much, I think; more than I like to
know, any ways. What do you mean by knowing
all, old woman?"</p>

<p>"Tops," said Susan, "we are going to be married."</p>

<p>Tops bowed his assent.</p>

<p>"A wife ought to have no secrets from her husband."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Tops, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"You have proved your fidelity thoroughly," said
Susan, "and I would trust you with anything. Besides, 
I have the permission of my mistress to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Your missus?" cried Tops. "What, that furren
lady&mdash;the Seenora, as you call her?"</p>

<p>"Have you noticed her particularly?" inquired
Susan.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I have," replied Tops. "She
wears such a thick veil, as if she was afraid of the
flies, like a skittish 'oss of a hot summer's day. She
looks like an out-and-out fine woman; I will say that
for her."</p>

<p>"Don't you think she is like any one you know?"
resumed Susan.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't took particular notice of any of her
countrywomen; but I heard a gent as was at the
Hopera say she was very like a party of the name of
Molly Bran. I shouldn't have remembered it, but

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

for the bran. I was jest thinking about giving our
oldest 'oss a mash, you see. There is a difference even
in <i>their</i> ages."</p>

<p>"Silly fellow!" quoth Susan, "I mean some one
whom you knew well."</p>

<p>Tops shook his head again.</p>

<p>"Isn't she like our old mistress&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey?"
cried Susan.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Tops, "she may be about the
same height and colour; but I should say the Seenora
is a matter of two stone heavier than that poor dear
lady as is gone. What a light weight she was for a
real genteel thorough-bred! I think I see her on her
white Arab, afore she lost her eyesight, poor thing!
I see the very mare last Wednesday was a week in
the Park. She was bought by a lieyer feller with
buck-teeth like a rat, a friend of hisn, Grinderby's, I
mean." And he pronounced the name with infinite
disgust.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Susan. "Suppose that Mrs. Aubrey 
had been saved, and not drowned at all, and
what is more, had recovered her eyesight, and become 
one of the most celebrated singers in the world!
Suppose that she and the Signora Stellini are one
and the same person after all!"</p>

<p>"What!" shouted Tops. "What! you don't, you
can't go for to mean it! Don't stand looking at a
feller like that! Is she? What? Eh! No, it
ain't possible. Do you mean that it is her, and the
t'other ain't drownded and dead after all?"</p>

<p>As he stood with open mouth and eyes awaiting an
answer, Susan could not help laughing outright.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

<p>"Susan!" continued Tops, "you're the girl of my
'art, which I have shown it pretty plain. But if you
try and come over me with any chaff about him and
her, as I don't like to think of, much less name, in a
permiscuous manner, I shall jib and no mistake! I
tell you I shan't have it, even from you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tops," said the lady, "I make every excuse
for you; because you can't help being a man, and
stupid as all men are. Do you think, sir, I am likely
to jest on such a subject? Did it never occur to your
dull comprehension that there was anything odd in
my going off with a foreign lady in such a hurry, just
after such a terrible affair?"</p>

<p>"I thought you did it for the best," replied Tops.
"I wasn't going to be mean and suspicious of you&mdash;was 
I? What do you take me for?"</p>

<p>Susan felt rebuked in this simple assertion of confidence.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear James," she said, flinging her
arms round his neck and kissing him, while she burst
into tears. "You behaved like a&mdash;what are you men
so fond of calling it?&mdash;a brick. There! Mrs. Aubrey 
was never drowned. She was saved by a brave
and honest man, after she had thrown herself into
the Thames. She changed her name, and went studying 
abroad, and I went with her. She is now the
celebrated singer Bianca Stellini, about whom such a
fuss is made. And she loves her husband still, as
dearly as ever. She has never said it, but I know it.
And, oh! if we could only find him, they may both
be happy yet."</p>

<p>Poor Tops could only blubber out in reply: "We

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

never shall find him. That's where it is. Here's his
fortin recovered from drownding, and his wife left all
afresh to him in a new will, and the double event ain't
no more than if it hadn't happened. I tell you, he's
scratched clean out of the race, altogether."</p>

<p>"I do not despair yet," said Susan. "I've great
faith in our friend the Downy's positive statement,
that he saw Mr. Aubrey alive within the last few
days."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't he stop him? That's what I
want to know. Does he know that she's alive? Perhaps 
you could trust him with the secret, though you
didn't tell me all this long time. And it might have
saved his life, that's what it might, just to have
known that he hadn't 'murdered' her, as he called it.
Not that she ever was murdered, even if she wasn't
alive."</p>

<p>"Of course," observed Susan, "the Downy knew
the secret; seeing that it was him who jumped into
the water, and saved her life at the risk of his own.
I would have told you twenty times over, and in fact
longed to do so; but it was not my secret, and Mrs.
Aubrey would not hear of any one being told. You
see she had quite turned against her husband, and
wouldn't allow his name even to be mentioned to her.
A benevolent lady furnished her with the means
to go abroad, and, I believe, set Mr. Downy up in
business, in which he soon came to grief, as I have
understood since our return. Now you see how it was
that I couldn't tell you how matters really were."</p>

<p>"I see," said Tops, gloomily, "and a pretty mess
you've all made of it&mdash;that is, if it is true that she

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

has forgiven him, and is sweet on him after all.
Perhaps we shall be able to find out where he's buried,
though I doubt if that's an easy matter. She'd be
able to take some of them flowers, which I see in the
'Morning Advertiser' they throwed to her at the
Hopera so plentiful last Thursday night, and put 'em
on his parish grave, that is, if the surgeons haven't
had him, and made a skelington of his poor bones.
I suppose she's anxious enough to find him now, and
live with him, unless she's been and got married again
in furren parts. Nothing would surprise me, especially
now his fortin's turned up."</p>

<p>"I don't know that she would have him," said
Susan; "and it strikes me that his fortune being
turned up, as you call it, is as likely as anything to
stop her, if she had any such idea in her head. And
what's more she isn't married, nor ever will be, that
is quite certain, at least to any one else. She's only
wrapped up in her child, the dearest little darling you
ever saw, and I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Tops, I don't
understand any such insinuations, neither from you
nor any one else, and I think you and me are very
likely to quarrel."</p>

<p>"Child!" shouted Tops. "What child? Whose
child? They never had no child. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," replied Susan; "that a little
boy was born in Rome, and he will be four years old
next December, and he is as like his father as ever a
child was, which in my opinion has done more to
soften her heart towards one who behaved so ill to
her, than anything else could have done."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

<p>"Where is the young un?" cried Tops. "Let me
see him, afore there's another word said."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I shall let you see him at all.
You have offended me very much. You choose to
forget all that angel suffered, and to be inclined to
abuse her; as if you'd never had any cause to be
ashamed of yourselves, you and your master together."</p>

<p>"And I tell you," said Tops, "that I've nothing
to be ashamed of; and as for the gov'nor, I should
think you and your missus had been pretty well revenged 
agen him any time these four years past. I
don't say she had no cause to be aggeravated, and do
all she did at the first start. But there ought to be
a hend to heverythink, and it strikes me she's waited
a little too long, that's all about it."</p>

<p>"So you think that a woman is to be neglected,
and deceived, and driven to make away with herself,
and to come round in a moment, do you? Who's
fault is it that she wasn't drowned? Who hindered
her from dying in an asylum for the indigent blind?"
asked Susan, rapidly.</p>

<p>"One," replied Tops, "that angry and revengeful
folk is very apt to forget, when they're a reckoning
others up. One as we're none of us too mindful of
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Susan was so struck with the sudden turn which
Tops had given to their conversation, that for once
she had nothing to say in answer, but put an abrupt
termination to the sermon which Mr. Tops had commenced 
by hurriedly seizing her bonnet, and tying
the strings a precious sight quicker, as Mr. Tops

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

afterwards said, than if she'd been sent for the
doctor. Throwing her light summer shawl round
her with a dexterous twist, she cast a look of haughty
indignation at Tops.</p>

<p>"You remind me," she said, "I shall be in time
for the afternoon service. I don't want you to preach
to me anyways. Good afternoon."</p>

<p>"Susan! Susan! don't be a fool!" exclaimed
Tops.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, with her hand on the
door-handle; when a smart knock caused her to
pause, and a face, which the most astute diplomatist
might have envied for its consummate serenity and
assurance, was suddenly made visible.</p>

<p>"Ax yer pardin," said the intruder, "didn't
know you wos alone. Good mornin' this evenin',
werry much thank yer. How air yer to-morrer?
Thought the old lady was here, or wouldn't 'ave
come up vithout writin'. Two's kimpany, and three's
none. Hallow me the honner!" And the Downy,
for he it was, once more respectably attired in a
whole suit of unpretending cut and hue, gallantly
took Mrs. Susan by the hand, which he squeezed,
whilst bestowing a series of the most patronising
winks and nods on Tops. "Vell, you air a lucky
feller," he said. "I couldn't a' thought that the air
in furren parts was so fayverabble to beauty. Hallo!"
he cried, as if struck by a sudden remembrance, "of
course, to be sure, it's my birthday," and with that
he gave Susan a chaste salute on both cheeks with
such rapidity, that his purpose could hardly have
been defeated.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

<p>"Well, I'm sure!" said Susan, "you're the last
man I should have expected such a liberty from, Mr.
Downy."</p>

<p>"I ax your pardin," said that gentleman, "if
I've made any mistake. The fact is, I'd a twin
brother as wos born this month, and I sometimes
forgets which of us it air. Besides, I am so glad to
see you back, and about to make my friend 'ere a
'appy man."</p>

<p>With any other man, at any other time. Tops
would certainly have quarrelled. But the Downy
was a privileged mortal, and Susan had just shown a
disposition, as he thought, to jilt him; so he merely
said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're mistaken in more things than
one; but what I want to ask you once more most
particular before we talk of any other mortal thing,
is, whether or not you was mistaken in thinking
you saw my old master, Mr. Arthur Aubrey, last
Tuesday was a week, about seven o'clock, in front of
St. George's Church, Hanover-square?"</p>

<p>"I see him," answered the Downy, "I tells yer
agen this vunce, and no more, as sure as I see you
now, and wot's more I spoke to him, and he hanswered 
me."</p>

<p>"And you know'd that Mrs. Aubrey was alive,
and never so much as told him, and pr'aps saved
his life. I tell you, I've found out all about his property, 
or at least I'm on the right line to find it out,
and here you've let him go on thinking himself a
murderer, or next door to it, and no better off than
a beggar in the street. I tell you, I don't thank you

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

for it, and what's more, I don't like you for it. And
if I was sure it was him, I don't think I should ever
care to have a drain of anything in your company
again."</p>

<p>The Downy looked at Susan, and said: "So you've
blowed the gaff at last. I'm werry glad on it, and
I've vished you'd done it afore any time these four
year. But I hopes you see, Mister Tops, that, yether
you're pleased or not, I couldn't split, and that's jest
all about it. If you'd hoffered me a thousand pound,
I shouldn't 'ave told a vord, and now you know.
That's special, and no mistake." Herewith, the
Downy advanced towards the door. "I'm werry
sorry," he said, "as things ain't turned out no
better. I'd a told the poor gentleman myself at fust,
hif I could 'ave had my way in the bis'ness.
Mornin', miss."</p>

<p>"Stop," said Susan. "Mr. Tops is quite welcome
to quarrel with me, if he pleases, as he seems to be
inclined to do with you; but I don't see why others
should suffer. I've only done my duty to my mistress, 
and I can remember the time when he kept his
master's counsel and secrets remarkably well. I've
nothing to say against that. The thing appears now
to be&mdash;can you find Mr. Aubrey, and put us in
communication with him? Of course, Mr. Tops will
do as he pleases; but if he wants to spoil everything,
as he certainly would do, he'll tell him when he is
found, as God grant he may be ere long, that Mrs.
Aubrey and the Signora Stellini are the same. It's
true, I've got her leave to let Mr. Tops into the secret,
and she has, in my belief, only come to England to see if

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

she can find her husband. But as for any reconciliation,
that must be left to her. All I know is, that I shouldn't
like ever to speak of it in her hearing. This discovery
about the will is quite another thing, and the sooner
Mr. Aubrey knows that, the better it will be for him.
And what's more," added Susan with spirit, "though
fortune would make no difference to her, yet if he's
half the man I take him for, he'd rather die than owe
anything to his wife, who has sustained such injury
at his hands. And now, Mr. Tops, perhaps you'll
tell us what information you've got, and what you
propose to do, in order to get hold of the papers,
which must be got, as well as to find out where Mr.
Aubrey is."</p>

<p>Mr. Tops listened to this long speech from the
accomplished lady's maid with great attention. He
felt that he was what he would himself have called
"in the wrong box." He could not but acknowledge,
on reflection, that Mrs. Aubrey had a right to act as
she had done under the circumstances; and that
neither Susan nor the Downy could have betrayed
her, without forfeiting their respective characters for
honesty and good faith. Still he wasn't inclined to
knock under all at once. So he repressed a strong
inclination to shake the Downy by the hand, and to
ask Susan for her forgiveness; and on his mother
making her appearance, which she did at that moment, 
he spoke quite sharply to the astonished old
lady, and requested to know why she had put nothing 
on the table to offer their guests.</p>

<p>All this Susan understood perfectly; but it didn't
prevent Mrs. Tops from feeling deeply aggrieved. It

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

was the foreshadow of the daughter-in-law on her
humble hearth.</p>

"I'm sure, James," said his mother, "I didn't
know that your young lady would take anything
before dinner, and this young man as, he'll excuse
me, I didn't know was a-coming, he has only just
come in, which I met him myself atop of the mews.
I'm sure, I'm very glad to see any of my son's
friends." And she curtsied to the Downy. "What
would you please to take, sir?" And without waiting 
for an answer, she put two bottles, one of stout,
and one of pale ale, on the table, with an ancient
spirit-stand, which had been a wedding gift to her
mother just sixty-three years before.</p>

<p>"Come," said Tops, in a more cheerful and social
tone, "give it a name. What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Afore you draws a cork," replied the Downy,
"I vants jest to know if you're agoin' to withdraw
a hobserwation as you jest now made. It ain't accordin' 
to my noshuns to act parliamentary and call
a man yer right honnorable friend, vile you're a
makin' him out no better than the biggest thief in
the vurld. Nor I don't eat and drink at the expense of
hany one as don't consider as I don't hact on the
square. That may suit the hairystocrisy, but it don't
suit me. So you've jest got to say vich it is, and 'ow
it is. No offence, mum" (to the old lady); "it ain't
hoften as I troubles a respectable family like this,
and I ain't agoin' to do no such a thing now, if my
condick is kevestioned, as your son's bin a-doin' of it.
But this needn't be in the way of bis'ness and our
dooty to others. It's honly in respect of the liquor."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

<p>"Allow me to say, Mrs. Tops," said Susan in her
turn. "that your son having an important communication 
to make respecting a family where we lived, I
am only waiting in consequence of that; and you'll
pardon me, if I also say that my visit must he considered 
now as entirely relating to the welfare and
happiness of other people."</p>

<p>"Won't you take off your bonnet, my dear?" said
the widow, who saw that her son was vexed and
agitated.</p>

<p>"No thank you, dear Mrs. Tops," was the amiable
reply; but the look which Tops <i>fils</i> got immediately
after on his advancing a step towards her, was what
a Yankee would have designated "a caution to rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>Tops hesitated, and then offered his hand to the
Downy. "I don't see as you could have acted different," 
he said, "and I'm sorry I spoke."</p>

<p>"A drop of gin, cold, hif you please," was the
Downy's answer, addressed to the old lady.</p>

<p>During this ceremony, in which the Downy gallantly 
insisted that the old lady should join, which
she did with "sweet (so far as a lump of sugar was
concerned) reluctant, amorous delay," Susan divided
her attention between a coaching print of the old
"Royal Defiance" in a snow-storm, and an elegant
Geneva watch, a late gift from her mistress. Tops
approached her and attempted to take her hand,
which she indignantly snatched away.</p>

<p>"Susan!" said Tops, falteringly, "Susan, I was
wrong, and I don't wish to deny it; but if you'd

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

knowed what he suffered afore my eyes, as was
always the best of masters to man and 'oss, and
perhaps now, if he's alive, ain't got a roof over his
head, nor a bite of vituals to eat, you wouldn't
wonder that I cut up rough, thinking as you and the
Downy here might have spared him the worst of it.
I see now that you couldn't have done different from
what you did. I see him well-nigh dead of grief and
fever, afore he bolted, cos he wouldn't be a burden to
me no longer. All I can say is, that I hope he'll
get his own, which he will if he's alive now, and as
for telling him that his wife, as was my old missus, is
alive, if I should ever see him again, I leave even
that to you, as I believe you know what is best, and
will act according, as old Blowhard, I mean Binsby,
used to say. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Under other circumstances, it is probable that Mrs.
Susan would have held out for some time. Women
who give their lovers most pain and trouble during
courtship, often turn out the most patient help-mates 
in wedded life. But this was Susan's first
visit to the maternal Tops, and she really liked her
intended all the more for his devotion to his master,
to whom she had long eagerly desired to see Blanche
reunited. So, though she again snatched her hand
from the attempted grasp of Tops, she embraced
his mother warmly, while bursting into a flood of
tears.</p>

<p>"Deary me, now!" cried the old lady, "whathever 
have you been a-doing of, James? Come in
here, my dear, and take your bonnet off." And she

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

forthwith took Susan out of the room; but not before
Tops had caught her in his arms and given her a
dozen ardent kisses.</p>

<p>"I say young man," said the Downy, "respect
the feelinx of a third party, will yer? How do yer
know but that you'll be a-startin' me hoff into materimony, 
afore I can afford a carridge and a grand
pie-anny. Dror it mild the next time yer comes out
in that 'ere line in kimpany, vill yer?"</p>

<p>In a very short time Susan re-entered the room.
"Come," she said, "let us hold our cabinet council.
Tell Mr. Downy here all about the letter, or perhaps 
you'd better give it to me to read aloud to
you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "the fact is this. T'other
evening I drove old Grinderby home as usual in the
'mourning-coach,' and the next day very early I see
this letter" (pulling it out of his pocket) "behind one
of the cushions. You see, he had either stuck it there
himself and forgot it, or it had come out of his
pocket, which the tailors makes so very shaller now-a-days, 
in order, I suppose, that you might lose the
receipt for your ready-made clothes. I've often found
papers behind there afore. Well, I thought I would
take it in at breakfast time, and I jest stuck it in the
winder, for fear of forgetting of it, and I had nigh
finished work, and was a-whistling like one o'clock,
and a-thinking of my Susan here, when I chanced to
look at the letter, which I believe I was nigh putting
in my pocket and taking to the house for the old un,
when I see the name of Arthur Aubrey, Eskvire,
leastways without the Eskvire, but there was Arthur

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

Aubrey plain, as you'll see. I hope, ladies and gentleman," 
said Tops, with mock gravity, "that I shan't
forfeit your good opinion when I tell you, that I not
only read that letter through, but that I afterwards
quite forgot to give it back to the owner." With this,
Mr. Tops handed the letter to Susan.</p>

<p>"Letter put in, and read accordin'," quoth the
Downy at this juncture.</p>

<p>"The letter," said Susan, "is dated 'Deptford,
Friday,' and is as follows:</p>

<p>" 'You infernal old cuss!' "</p>

<p>"That's a perlite beginnin'," quoth the Downy.</p>

<p>"It's plain speaking," said Tops. "Don't you see
that the letter is addressed to Grinderby by somebody
as knows him? Drive on, Susey."</p>

<p>" 'I'm not,' " she accordingly continued, " 'going
to be made a fool of by you any longer. You must
either fork out the amount I named at our last
interview, or I shall tell Arthur Aubrey everything,
and trust rather to his coming out strong&mdash;hate him
as I do&mdash;more than to the liberality and honour of a
lawyer. Now I just wish to inform you that I am
getting ugly, and won't stand no more darned nonsense 
and shuffling. Either you'll come down handsome 
with the dollars&mdash;I want three thousand pounds
sterling, or I'll give Aubrey the will, and tell him what
I have refused for it. It's a large stake, remember.
You won't be long squeezing that out of the property;
and how much have you nobbled already, which you'll
have to disgorge, like a shark ripped up on the
deck of a three-master, if I speak the word. You
say Aubrey cannot be found. Can't he? Let <i>me</i>

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

try to find him. If he was dead, as you say, there is
the next heir would be uncommon glad of a visit
from our American cousin. What do <i>you</i> think?
Now don't come any delays with me, for I won't have
it. You tried that game on at your accursed den in
Webb's Fields, once too often to suit me. It wasn't
quite prudent of you. Mister Grinderby, to set them
young lawyer's spawn a-grinning at me for three
quarters of an hour, while you were shuffling over
your papers of lies up-stairs. I tell you I've put lead,
ay, and cold steel, into a man for less, and I'll do it
to you, if you raise my dander, I will by&mdash;&mdash;' "</p>

<p>Here Susan stopped. "I don't quite understand
what comes next," she said, "but it looks something
dreadful."</p>

<p>"Go on with what he says about meeting him.
That's the ticket," remarked Tops. "Never mind
the oaths. I forgot all about them, which I hope
you'll excuse, my dear."</p>

<p>Susan, who had been quietly finishing the letter to
herself, complied at once.</p>

<p>" 'Now, I tell you what it is, old boss, I ain't a
going to stand any more humbug, so make your
choice. You'll come and see me this time, d'ye understand? 
There ain't no lawyers' clerks here. I
shall expect you at eight o'clock on Tuesday evening
with the cash&mdash;short, mind, nothing over fifties! I'll
then give you the will, and this time you can see it's
genuine. I shan't stay in England more than twelve
hours after. It's a precious sight too hot, I can tell
you. I don't half like that dirty, loping, scarecrow
messenger of yours.' "</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

<p>"Ha! ha!" interrupted Tops. "That's one for
you, Mr. Downy. How do you like the description?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing but right-down wiciousness a-tryin'
to describe wirtue," replied that individual.</p>

<p>" 'T'other day,' " continued Susan, reading, " 'when
you were fool enough not to wait till I came, as if
<i>you</i> never kept any one waiting, dash you! the beggarly 
skunk brought another worse-looking vagabond
in the rummiest cut toggery I ever saw.' "</p>

<p>"That's you, Mr. Tops! You've got it handsome
this time," cried the Downy. "I'm sorry to interrupt 
you. Pray go on, miss!"</p>

" 'This precious pair of tripe-faced cockneys,' "
continued Susan, still reading, " 'had the insolence
to ask me all sorts of questions. I had some difficulty
to keep from whipping the pair of sneaking, shivering,
swamp-raised cusses together, I tell you, and the next
time I catch them they'd best look out for squalls. I've
seen the long-tailed cuss somewhere before, I guess.
It was either in a thieves' kitchen, where I was hiding
out of the way of the beaks, or else he was door-keeper 
to a copper-hell in Leicester-square. Such a
hang-dog face as his isn't easy forgotten altogether.
So don't send that live scarecrow again to me, if
you're likely to want him any more in your
garden.' "</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Susan, "the writer's
remarks are extremely complimentary."</p>

<p>Mr. Tops expressed himself rather strongly about
punching heads, but the equanimity of the Downy
didn't seem in the least disturbed.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

<p>Susan continued her reading with an expression of
quiet amusement not altogether unmingled with an
indefinite expression of alarm.</p>

<p>" 'To cut it short, old fellow, you'd best stump
up, if you don't want to smell brimstone premature.
At eight o'clock P.M., on Tuesday, mind, sharp, and
the toast of the evening after our little business is
settled shall be with all my heart&mdash;"May we never
meet again on this side of&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p class="right">" 'Disrespectfully yours,<br/>

" 'J. S. M.' "</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the ruffian, whose
precious communication we have just transferred to
these pages, left any blanks in his letter to be filled
up at discretion.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Mrs. Susan, "a very
pretty epistle. I hope, James, you are not so foolish
as to think of having anything to do with such a
person?"</p>

<p>"Hem!" said Tops, "we'll think about that by-and-by. 
What do you think this cove means about
giving up the will for three thousand pounds, and
threatening if the money ain't paid, and it ain't a
trifle neither, to tell Mr. Arthur?"</p>

<p>"I see," said the Downy; "he must 'ave took this
ere lieyer for pardner, and was wound up by
Chancery."</p>

<p>"No!" said Susan; "his father, the old gentleman
who made the fortune and bought the estate, left a
will tying him up so strict, as I heard say, that he

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

could only spend the income, and couldn't borrow
any money at all. And when he'd overrun the constable, 
as they call it, the lawyers, and among them
this very Grinderby, stepped in, and they got everything 
into Chancery on behalf of the entail, and
there's nothing left for him to live on, as he's forfeited 
his rights."</p>

<p>"I said it were Chancery, but how come the old
chap to make this 'ere werry spicy harrangement
in favour of the lieyers?" asked the Downy.</p>

<p>"It was when he and Mr. Arthur were not on the
best of terms," replied Susan.</p>

<p>"Some time afore the old un kicked the bucket,
I dare say?" suggested the Downy.</p>

<p>"I believe it was," said Susan.</p>

<p>"D'ye know if they wos friends&mdash;I mean your
guvenor and his father, afore the old chap died?"
pursued the Downy.</p>

<p>"The best in the world," replied Susan. "In
fact, they were quite reconciled."</p>

<p>"Then it's as plain as 'V. R.' of a hillumination
night, there wos another vill," said the Downy, "and
this 'ere chap has got it."</p>

<p>"But who can he be?" said Tops.</p>

<p>"Whoever he air," remarked the Downy, "accordin' 
to the descripshun, he knowed you someveres
afore, at least so he says. I'm 'appy to say it wos
afore I knowed yer either."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to get let out of the
garden, afore the cherry season was over?" retorted
Tops. "I think you'd best shut up."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

<p>"Look here, James," said Susan. "Don't you
remember the clerk of the late Mr. Aubrey, who ran
away soon after his death?"</p>

<p>"I see him once," replied Tops. "He was a tall,
stout gent. It was the very first week that I lived
with Mr. Arthur. He was in trouble then. Let's
see, what was his name? It began with a M."</p>

<p>"Manvers, to be sure," cried Susan.</p>

<p>"That's the ticket," said Tops. "Then this is
him, and this 'ere will is one as he has concealed and
took with him to Amerikey. And now he's offered
to sell it to old Grinderby for three thousand pound.
Stop! what have I heard of him besides?"</p>

<p>"He was suspected of having committed a murder,"
said Susan, "and there was a reward offered for his
apprehension. Oh, James, do be careful what you
have to do with such a man!"</p>

<p>"So much the heasier job for us," said the Downy.
"I s'pose there's no mistake, no danger of wrong
wot's-his-name, somethink as begins vith a hi, no totherification, 
I means&mdash;mistakin' of him for another
bloke, and all that?"</p>

<p>"I can swear to the man now myself," answered
Tops; "for all his disguise and Yankee lingo. He'd
robbed the gov'nor of a sight of money then, and
was let off heasy. I'll let him off this time, when I
catch him."</p>

<p>"The job's got to be done soon," remarked the
Downy. "There ain't much time atween this and
Toosday. I'll pound it old Grinderby won't be long
afore he burns that 'ere vill, if hever he gets it into
his vicked old fingers."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

<p>"He'll not throw away a chance this time," said
Tops. "We must have the will, before it changes
hands. Couldn't we manage so as to collar the three
thousand as well?"</p>

<p>The Downy shook his head. "I should be werry
sorry to try," he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean for us, you blessed garden himage
out for a Sunday," said Tops; "I meant to collar it
for him as it belongs to, Arthur Aubrey, Eskvire,
with three cheers and a little one in. Here, fill your
glasses." And so saying, he filled a bumper all
round, uncorking a bottle of ginger-beer for Susan,
and proposed the governor's health, and long life to
him, wherever he was to be found. When the excitement 
of this had passed, Mr. Tops desired his
mother to hurry dinner, a request that never yet
occasioned anything save increased delay, with the
exception of ill-temper. "For," said he, "we must
tackle this Manvers this very night."</p>

<p>"Tacklin's all werry well," said the Downy, "purvidin' 
we <i>can</i> tackle him; but s'pose we had him safe
and in the jug anyveres, 'ow air we to drop on the
vill! I'm for tryin' some dodge, sech as gettin'
round the landlord of the public as he uses, and
droppin' in upon him jest ven hold Grinderby and
him's together a squarin' of the plant."</p>

<p>"It's awful risky," said Tops.</p>

<p>"I didn't think as you'd be afeard," said the
Downy. "I should fancy the pair on us could
tackle him. I'm a precious sight stronger nor I
look."</p>

"Afraid!" quoth Tops, with scorn. "Whoever

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

thought of such a thing? I'm only afraid of not
getting hold of the will."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Susan, "you'll neither of you be
such fools as to think of fighting with a low murdering 
ruffian like this Tadgers, or Manvers, or whatever's 
his name. I'm sure, for my part, I should
despise any man who would condescend to such vulgarity."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Tops, "I should think myself a
sneak, if I was to shy at such a job."</p>

<p>"There are two ways of setting about it," said
Susan; "and if you go blundering head-over-heels
into a disgraceful affair, I'll never speak to you
again."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that we are to do nothing,
and suffer our old gov'nor to be robbed in this way
without doing nothing?" inquired Tops.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you call doing 'nothing,' Mr.
Tops," said the lady of his affections; "but I can't
see what good you'll do by being stabbed or shot,
and, perhaps, losing a limb or an eye for your pains.
The proper thing to do is to communicate with the
police."</p>

<p>The Downy whistled. "It's too wenturesome a
game for them. They'd never do it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" responded Susan. "They must.
What are they paid for, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"So should I," said the Downy. "Pr'aps it's for
hindrin' poor folks from gettin' their livin', and overturnin' 
horanges and happles into the streets&mdash;pr'aps
it's for takin' hup little boys under six year old on a

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

Sunday for hollerin', and lockin' 'em up all night in
a cold cell&mdash;pr'aps it's fortakin' money from a parcel
of poor gals to let 'em alone, and pinchin' and dislocatin' 
the arms of them as don't or can't pay&mdash;pr'aps 
it's for drivin' cabbies and busmen wild, and
takin' away their licenses for nothink&mdash;pr'aps it's for
follerin' gents as is hout late and hintimadatin' 'em
by tellin' 'em it's a dry night, 'till the party's glad to
give 'em a shillin' to go away&mdash;pr'aps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Mr. Downy," interrupted Susan;
"we know your sentiments on that subject; and if
you please we'll just try if we can't make the police
do their duty this time. Where's that handsome
friend of yours, James? I mean the inspector
who was sent to America to take Clark, the
poisoner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean Lanner," said Tops; "I haven't
set eyes on him these three years."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he is to be found," said Susan.
"Tell him the whole affair, and put it in his hands.
We'll assure him of a handsome reward if he succeeds, 
and pay him for his time and trouble in any
case. Besides, is there not a reward already offered
for this Manvers, if it is the same man?"</p>

<p>"Of course there is," replied Tops. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't," said Susan. "When did
one of your wise sex ever think of anything sensible? 
Find out Lanner at once, and lay your three
heads together. If you want any further advice, you
can all send for <i>me</i>."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

"I should have thought," said Tops, "you wouldn't
like to risk hurting the beauty of such a handsome
man as Mr. Lanner."</p>

<p>This was rather a sore subject for Tops. In former
days, Mr. Lanner had been somewhat particular in
his attentions to Susan. That young lady tossed her
head.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," she said, "I never saw anything very
uncommon in him myself; only it was the fashion
to say he was good-looking. I never looked at him
enough, perhaps, to find it out. It's not likely,
indeed&mdash;a policeman who takes up thieves and comes
home with murderers. I'm sure I'm much obliged to
you, Mr. Tops. Perhaps I am not so particular in
my choice as I might be."</p>

<p>"Capting Lanner," observed the Downy, "is a
werry clever genelman, a werry clever genelman
indeed. I wos thinkin' of them hordinary perlice as
acts sentries to the larders of an approvin' country.
If so be as Capting Lanner takes a hinterest in the
matter, vy it's vun for our American cousin's nob.
My advice is to foller your young lady's reckymindation."</p>

<p>"Was Captain Lanner ever in the Army or Navy?"
asked Susan.</p>

<p>"Ve calls the inspector capting," answered the
Downy, "hever since he took that carrackter, to
grab a party as had broke the Henlistment Hact.
He's very pleasant company is the capting, and as
hartful as he is pleasant. It ain't above a week since
I see him at Bow-street."</p>

<p>It was, therefore, finally moved by Mrs. Susan,

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

seconded by D. Cove, Esquire, and carried by acclamation, 
that Mr. Lanner should forthwith be waited
upon by a deputation consisting of Tops and the
Downy; and requested to concert measures for the
recovery of the will, which was supposed to be in the
hands of Tadgers, <i>alias</i> Manvers, and for the discomfiture 
of Grinderby's nefarious designs.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing I can't see clear," said
Tops. "How can I go in against any one whose
victuals I eat and whose uniform I wear? Well,
I'll eat no more of his victuals, nor take no more of
his money from this very hinstant. I'll get discharged
to-morrow morning at a minute's notice, when I've
drove him to the office."</p>

<p>"Right you air," said the Downy, "I respex
them feelinx of yourn. It's wot I should do myself.
And as you can't werry vell be hout of it afore to-morrer, 
I'll hopen the case, as the lieyers call it, to
the capting, and you needn't do nothink agen your
conshunce."</p>

<p>After the little episode of a sudden burst of wailing
and lamentation from the maternal Tops, who had a
vague notion that something dreadful was going to
happen, further discussion was set aside by the advent
of a small girl with the dinner, which consisted of a
shoulder of mutton baked over potatoes in a brown
dish, and which it must be owned spread a most appetising 
fragrance in the air.</p>

<p>"I say," said the Downy, "is it true that some of
the nobs as is allers henvious of our luxuries is agoin'
to do avay with hot jints on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"They never can be such a set of hypocritical

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

fools," cried Susan. "If they do, there ought to be
a revolution, that's all I have to say."</p>

<p>"I should like to have the punishment of such a
lot," remarked Tops. "I'd give their insides a holiday, 
till they were pretty nigh dead with hunger and
thirst, and then tie 'em to postises opposite the bakers'
shops of a Sunday, and let 'em smell all the dinners
agoing out."</p>

<p>"How they can have the heart to do it, I can't
tell," said Susan.</p>

<p>" 'Art!" cried the Downy; "their 'arts is cold
cat's-meat, and wot their brains is 'twould lick the
whole Collidge of Surgeons to tell&mdash;soap-suds and
live maggots, I should think."</p>

"Why can't they be quiet?" continued Tops.
"They get their own hot dinners and their wine on
Sundays, as well as every other day in the week;
they've their kitchens at home, and their clubs to go
to, and they can't be happy without being shocked
at the deplorable immorality of a baked jint and
potatoes on Sunday."</p>

<p>"I wonder their religion don't choke 'em some
times," said the Downy.</p>

<p>"There ain't no denying." remarked Tops, "that
the wickeder a rich man is, the more he keeps pegging
away at the comforts of the lower orders. If their
own lives was reckoned up, they'd be glad to drop the
hot tater on Sunday humbug pretty sharp."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," said the old lady, "that the
hot-houses is all took good care of on Sunday; for
my own brother is head-gardener to Lord Tipton and
Wednesbury, and he don't get no holiday, as I know

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

on, for I asked him to come this blessed day, and he
said it was as much as his place was worth, and there
was ever so many foreigners coming to dinner, and
he'd all the grapes to cut for 'em."</p>

<p>"It's werry kind on 'em, I'm sure," said the
Downy, "as they don't start a Parlymentairy Committee 
on the special to stop them himmoral cabbages
from growing of a Sunday in a poor man's garding.
If they could honly do it and clap the hextra power
on to pine-apples, they'd werry soon try it, and no
mistake."</p>

<p>"What an eloquent set out it would be," said
Susan. "Only fancy, 'Growing depravity of the
lower classes.' "</p>

<p>"The Harchbishop of Middlesex in the cheer,"
added the Downy.</p>

<p>"Lord Shamsbury wished to know if the Act
couldn't be extended to water-creases," observed
Tops.</p>

<p>"Professor Graveworm," continued Susan, "produced 
a gooseberry which would only ripen on week-days. 
It was a small sour kind especially adapted
to cottages. He had devoted several successive
Sabbaths to the minute observation of this interesting 
fruit."</p>

<p>"That's about the ticket," said the Downy.
"That's just wot they'd like to be hup to, and have an
extra lot of bobbies to go into the cottagers' gardings
with a bull's-eye, 'arter twelve o'clock on Saturday
nights, to pull hup hall that was growin' contrairy to
the Hact. Talkin' of bull's-eyes, I knowed a gent at
Tottenham, as never could grow no wall-fruit. It

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

allers wanished jest afore it was ripe. Vell, he goes
agen and agen to the perlice inspector, and he says
it's quite impossible as strangers could do it; for,
says he, our hofficers is allers on the look-out. Vun
night the gent looks hoat of his bedroom vinder,
and he sees a werry curious sort o' light a bobbin' up
and down his peach-vall, vich he couldn't hexplain
novays. It wos as dark as pitch, yer see. So he
takes his rewolwer and puts on his coat vith a hanti-garotting 
coller, hall spikes and fish-hooks, and
down he goes in his carpet shoes, and wot do yer think
he found?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," said Tops for the company.</p>

<p>"A perlice sarjent turnin' his bull's-eye on to the
nectarinds, a feelin' on 'em to see if they wos there
all right.</p>

<p>" 'Good mornin', friend,' says he, for it wos close
on two o'clock. 'The same to you, sir," says the bobby.
'I thought I heerd steps,' he says. 'Ah! I see,' says
the gent, 'and so you're a-taking stock beforehand, to
see wot's ready to be missed. Werry thoughtful,'
says he. 'Pray valk into my 'ouse and 'ave a drop of
summat 'ot.' 'Werry much obliged,' says the bobby,
'but I'd rather not leave my dooty,' says he. Vell
the gent didn't know 'ow to nail him at first, but
presently he pretends to slip and cotched hold of the
bobby's coat-pockets to save himself from fallin', quite
forgettin' his spiked coller, and the bobby he cotches
hold of that, and then there was a pretty hullibaloo.
Vell the hupshot wos that two more perlice swore
the next morning they found a heap of fruit nigh the
gate ready to be took hoff, and that the sarjent wos

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

only takin' it to the station kvite correct, and the
gent, who was werry fond of gardenin', sold hoff
heverything and vent to live in France, and the
wigilance of the perlice was thought worthy of a
testymonial by the folks in Tottenham, for so nearly
havin' cotched a desperate robber in the hact."</p>

<p>We shall now leave the Downy and Mr. Tops to
go in search of Inspector Lanner. We feel it a real
privilege that the events of our story enable us to introduce 
such a character. Being denied the opportunity 
of laying before our readers the subtle workings 
of the human heart as displayed in adultery and
bigamy; not even having a golden-haired domestic
female poisoner at our disposal to drug (say her twin
sister previously adored by her) in child-bed, in order
to indulge her incestuous passion for the husband of
the above, a tall, pale solicitor with blue-black whiskers
and a blue-bag containing a magnetic "power of attorney," 
strong enough to fascinate all the young
ladies in the shire; in default, we say, of these and
other requisites for modern success, it is something
to have a detective officer to fall back on. Only
we are afraid that our detective will be a very
ordinary personage, indeed. He will <i>not</i> combine
the qualities of a Mathews the elder, the facial
powers of Herr Schultz, and the rapid disguises of
Woodin, with the scent, vision, and instincts of a
Red Indian.</p>

<p>He will <i>not</i> step up to the guilty baronet at the
exact moment, when he is about to start for America,
and whisper the number of the gold repeater which
he has just nervously consulted for the last time. He

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

will not be summoned from London by a telegram to
treat a Cabinet Minister with cool contempt mingled
with the pity of a superior being, and immediately
spot the missing despatches on the person of the
cook, who turns out to be a Russian agent in disguise, 
and whom the detective handcuffs in calm
triumph immediately after family devotion. This is
quite in accordance with the style in vogue, and
hits the taste of the present age, far better than
the romances of Sir Walter Scott, or anything necessitating 
the exercise of the higher intellectual
faculties.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">A SANDWICH WITHOUT SALT.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Though my heart-strings crack, I will not yield unto a disobedient
child. Let him prove me wrong! It shall not set him right who has
defied me thus. What! Is it for this that we watch over the infancy
which they forget, that we hang o'er their beds in illness, and applaud
their gambols in health, that we weep alike over their chastisements
and rewards, that we live a new life in them, and abandon our pleasures
and even our habits for their sakes? No! Rather like the strange
insect that we read of, let them destroy the parent life, than rob us of

<p>"ARE you drunk, you rascal?" said Mr. Grinderby
to his coachman the next afternoon, after the date of
the little dinner at that individual's lodgings over the
stable.</p>

<p>It must be owned that there was some reason in
the inquiry; for Mr. Tops had a remarkably flushed
and excited appearance, and his livery hat had apparently 
been lent to a conjurer, and was placed on
his head in a mingled style of gaiety and defiance.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" was the unceremonious
answer.</p>

<p>"I say, are you drunk, you villain?" cried Grinderby, 
in a loud and angry tone.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

<p>"Not exactually," was the answer, "seeing that
I've had nothing but some of your beer to drink,
'Grinderby's partickler.' "</p>

<p>"I discharge you this instant, you scoundrel!"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"That's actionable," said Tops. "Here!" he cried,
opening a door leading to the office where the clerks
were sitting (for this interview took place in Mr.
Grinderby's own room in Webb's Fields). "Here!
Hi! some of you limbs of Satan, come here, will
yer? I've put up with a great deal too much, and
I don't mean to put up with it no longer, and after
I've driven the 'osses home, I'm going to leave. This
sort of life ain't respectable."</p>

<p>"This insolence from a servant!" cried Grinderby. 
"I'll have you up before a magistrate,
fellow!" Then, after a moment's pause, he said, "You
may take the horses home, sir, as I remain here late,
and then leave my house. I shall not give you a
character, and your balance of wages to this date will
depend upon your conduct."</p>

<p>"Character from you! That's a good un," answered 
Tops. "After half-past five, I'm no longer
in your service, and you may keep your wages to
yourself." And Mr. Tops made a most unceremonious 
exit.</p>

<p>"His behaviour is very suspicious," said Grinderby 
to himself. "I hope he has not by any chance
picked up that letter which I missed so strangely.
But I am pretty sure that I tore it up by mistake
with those other papers. I was tearing them, when
the postman came. To-morrow I must go and see

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

that ruffian, and try to satisfy him with the smallest
possible sum. He is hard pressed, and five or six
hundred pounds ought to get me that will, and
then&mdash;&mdash; But somehow everything seems to have
gone wrong with me of late." Here he rang a hand-bell, 
and our old acquaintance Snap made his appearance. 
"Tell the boy," said Grinderby, sharply, "to
bring my lunch. I rang for him." Snap disappeared,
and presently the boy made his appearance with a tray
on which was a small sandwich and a glass of water.
The old lawyer tasted this not too luxurious fare,
and suddenly his face grew dusky and livid with
passion. "Here, you sirrah!" he almost screamed
to the boy. "How dare you! You young scamp,
you atrocious, profligate, swindling villain, you dog,
you!" And he struck him three or four heavy blows
with the tray over the head.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" screamed the boy. "What have I
done?"</p>

<p>"To bring me my sandwich without salt, after all
that I have said, you imp, you! How dare you?"
And he boxed the boy's ears.</p>

<p>"It wasn't me as cut 'em," sobbed the lad. " 'Tain't
my fault."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Snap re-entered the room. He laid a
small slip of paper before Mr. Grinderby, on which
the name of a visitor was inscribed, after the manner
of solicitors' offices.</p>

<p>"Mr. Leslie!" said Grinderby. "I don't know
the name. Did he say what his business is? Is he
a gentleman?"</p>

<p>Snap looked at his employer with a mingled glance

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

of expectation, doubt, and malice. "I don't know
whether I'm right or not, Mr. Grinderby, to mention
it, but the gent looks uncommon like your son."</p>

<p>"My son, sir! he would not dare. Am I to understand 
that it is he or not? Why the devil don't you
speak plain."</p>

<p>"It is him," said Snap. "I'd have spoken out
plainer, but didn't know how you'd like it."</p>

<p>"And pray, sir, what business have you to think
about what don't concern you? Upon my word,
sir, you are getting on. You are becoming far too
valuable for this office, Mr. Snap."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps," returned Snap, doggedly, "you
won't mind increasing my salary twenty pounds
a-year. I've been intending to ask you this last
month."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Grinderby. "Pray proceed.
Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Snap; "me and the other clerks have
been agoing to ask, if we can't go away at two o'clock
on Saturdays, like all the other clerks."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, on one condition, and that is that you
don't return here, sir, on Mondays, or any other
day. Leave the room, sir!" thundered Grinderby,
"leave the room."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you'll accept three months' notice
in writing," continued Snap, perfectly unappalled.</p>

<p>"Leave the room, sir!" reiterated Grinderby.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell Mr. Edgar&mdash;Leslie, that you'll see
him?"</p>

<p>"Show him in!" was the reply, "and don't listen
at the key-hole."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

<p>"Take a seat, sir," said the old lawyer, as his son
was shown in. "What can I have the pleasure of
doing for you?"</p>

<p>"Father!" said Edgar, "believe me, I do not
mean this as an intrusion; but I wish to speak to
you on a matter of a most serious nature. It is not
on my own account."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said his father. "I thought perhaps
that your precious newspaper had become bankrupt;
or that your valuable services had been dispensed
with, and that you had come here begging. As it
happens, there is a desk vacant in this office, but I
fear that your habits are scarcely suitable to any
regular business. However, if you choose to cut that
hair off your face, and call to-morrow at half-past
nine, if your habits allow you to rise at such an early
hour, I'll see what can be done."</p>

<p>"It is nothing of the kind, sir. It is about your
own affairs I would speak," returned Edgar.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, sir!" said his father, "your condescension 
is overpowering. But as I am extremely
busy" (and he began writing), "I would rather&mdash;if&mdash;you 
please&mdash;postpone the intended&mdash;favour," and
he rang his bell for Snap. "Good afternoon, Mr.
Leslie!"</p>

<p>Leslie took a newspaper from his pocket, and turning 
it so as to show a labelled paragraph, handed it to
his father.</p>

<p>The latter took it and read it to himself. The
paragraph ran as follows: "Threatened revelations.&mdash;It 
is stated that legal proceedings are about to be
instituted, in reference to the estate of Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;,

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

a gentleman who disappeared some four years since
in a most mysterious manner, immediately after a
tragical event which will be fresh in the recollections
of our readers. A solicitor of some eminence is said
to be deeply involved."</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby, senior, exhibited no outward emotion, 
beyond an unwonted pallor, if such it could be
called.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "is this precious composition 
yours? Have you become a penny-a-liner
to write unmeaning libels and enter into vague conspiracies 
against&mdash;no matter whom, sir? I advise
you to beware of an indictment for conspiracy, should
this precious innuendo be caught at by any busy
fool."</p>

<p>"I neither wrote it&mdash;nor do I know whence it
emanates. There are rumours that Mr. Aubrey is
not dead; but that he has been seen about in a sad
state of destitution within the last three or four
months. Oh! father, if there is any&mdash;anything
wrong about this unfortunate affair, that you can set
right, I have come to implore you to do it, ere it is
too late."</p>

<p>"And I request you, sir, to leave my office, ere it
is too late. Go to your penny-a-lining, sir; and when
you can't get your bread at that, I will listen to your
repentance, your apologies, and your excuses. As
for this nonsense, it matters not, I tell you, whether
that profligate idiot Aubrey is alive or dead. He
has not a farthing interest in the estate, or its rents,
of which I am appointed receiver by the Court of
Chancery, sir, the Court of Chancery, do you hear?

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

And, sir, he owes the late firm of Grinderby and
Cousens, or rather myself, sir, for I took the debts
on myself when I dissolved partnership, to save him
from the exposure of the Court, a sum of nearly two
thousand pounds at this moment, to which the rents
are not applicable. And now, sir, what more have
you to say?"</p>

<p>"It is whispered that there is another will," said
Edgar, "which, if found, would restore this Mr.
Aubrey to affluence."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better find it, sir," cried his father;
"and when you've found it, hark ye! come here
again, and not before then. And so you get your
living, do you? I should hardly have thought so, at
least honestly, considering that you are such a fool;
yes, sir, such a fool, I repeat."</p>

<p>"Better be a fool," said Edgar, "than&mdash;&mdash;" But
he prudently stopped himself.</p>

<p>"Than what, sir, may I ask?" inquired his father.
"Finish your dutiful sentence, by all means. It will
add a feather to your honourable career. But, in
the mean time, mind you don't starve, sir, starve like
a writer of sonnets and what not, in a garret or on
a dung-heap. There was a fellow came touting here
yesterday from an Author's Benevolent Aid Society,
or some such thing. I am sorry I didn't give the
fellow a donation for your sake, sirrah! For that is
what your scribbling will bring you to before long.
Look here, sir! I've done more than most fathers
would, who have been treated as you have treated
me. I have left you two pounds a-week in my will,
to be paid weekly, mind. It will keep you out of the

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

workhouse, and out of want, if you don't take to
drinking like others of your precious stamp. And
now begone, sir! begone!"</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" cried Edgar, once more. "Believe
me, I have not come here to insult or annoy you; but
I feared there might be some truth in this thing. I
never told you why I left home, and would not follow
the profession which you chose for me. It was because 
of the cruel things I saw, the oppression and
extortion, which I could not endure to witness. I
knew how this very Mr. Aubrey was treated in this
office&mdash;I knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for the old man had risen, shaking in
every limb. "You lie! ungrateful boy. There has
been nothing, save the usual&mdash;the ordinary practice
of&mdash;the law, sir; yes, the law. And if I did not
yield to sickly sentiment, which would have speedily
brought me to ruin, yes to ruin&mdash;for whom was it, I
pray? I wished to make you a gentleman and a
barrister&mdash;to leave you the property which your sister
will now inherit. Not another word. Go, sir, go!
You have done well to change your name. I tell you
I am busy. Will you have the kindness to leave this
room, if you please?"</p>

<p>Edgar offered his hand, which his father rejected
with a gesture of impatience, and unwillingly took
his departure. As he went out, he met a very old
clerk, a grey routinarian named Stubbs, a man who
derived his sustenance from iniquity, as harmlessly
as he possibly could, as a weevil or any other grub
lives on rottenness, blindly. Altogether, somehow, 
he was not a bad old man. Indeed, he had

<!-- vol 3 page 285 -->

a strange, stupid reverence for the law, and would
chuckle drearily and rub his hands over the success
of injustice through some legal quirk, or the astute
misrepresentation of a learned counsel. There are
such miserable wretches, born with a moral strabismus, 
who have no particular harm in themselves,
stingless blind-worms, crawling in old ways, efts
and newts in the polluted cistern of injustice, who
believe in foulness and worship the dirt in which they
move, and on which they exist. This venerable nonentity 
followed Edgar to the outer door.</p>

<p>"Ah! master Edgar," he said, in feeble, quavering
accents, "I'm glad to see you, sir, amongst us again.
Your father, sir, is not the same man, since you left
us. I hope you are coming to study the law. We
shall see you a judge, sir, yet."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Stubbs," replied Edgar, "I am just the
same as ever. I am not fit for the profession, nor
ever shall be."</p>

<p>"I thought of you, sir, in the great case of Black
<i>v</i>. White, yesterday. The speech of the Attorney-General 
was superb. Your respected father retained
him for Black, when we hadn't in equity, no, nor apparently 
in anything else, the ghost of a chance. It
was a case of mining under a manufactory erected by
White, and you see, sir. Black had only bought up
some old abandoned shafts in order to get purchased
out by White. Of course, when he pumped out the
water, the buildings began to give way. There was
some of the hardest swearing I ever had the pleasure
of hearing. Black swore he bought the mine from
his knowledge, in order to win a valuable seam of coal.

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

and White deposed that it was notorious there was no
coal there. Then Black swore that his proceedings
would not damage the buildings materially, even if he
continued his operations under the whole field. There
was a boundary stipulation; but he swore there was
none, and our side squared the vendor of the mine
at the very last moment, not to produce the stipulation, 
which was in a separate agreement. The engineers 
swore point blank against each other, just like
doctors. The whole case rested on Black's evidence.
It was beautiful to see how he behaved in the witness-box 
under the examination by Mr. Serjeant Queerfish, 
and how the Attorney-General got out of him
some of the most artistic perjury ever offered in a
Court of Justice. Every one knew it was the sheerest
lying, but it could not be contradicted&mdash;we had
managed the case so well. You see that Shycase, the
eminent Q.C., was retained, but was engaged elsewhere, 
and Queerfish knew nothing of the case. He
actually complimented Black on his position in the
mining world, whereas he ought as far as possible to
have shown up some of the earlier transactions of his
life. So Black got sixty thousand pounds damages,
and White is a ruined man. 'Ecod!' cried old Molewarp, 
Black's borer in the north, to his patron, 'thee
deserves thy verdict, mon, that thee dost; for I'm
thinking there isn't another chap in England that
could have gone safe down that shaft, an' coom up
again without ever touching a soide like of the truth.'
It was the greatest triumph I have seen in a Court of
Justice these fifty years, because we had to fight
against all the facts of the case."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

<p>"You may call it a triumph, but I call it a disgrace," 
said Edgar. "It appears that every principle 
of justice was violated, as is too often the case."</p>

<p>"The law is very superior to justice, I should
hope, or where should we lawyers be?" said the old
clerk, with a ghastly attempt at cachinnation. "Ho,
ho! Hee, hee!"</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Stubbs!" said Edgar, gently. "I
hope your family are well, and that the law will never
deal with them harshly. How would you like your
home desolated by triumphant lying, sir, on the part of
some reckless opponent, who should swear that your
house stood on his land, and contrived by some
fiendish plot in which perjury and bribery were the
lightest components, to turn white into black in your
case, sir, and <i>vice vers&acirc;?</i>"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mr. Stubbs, "I don't see how
such a thing could be. I should take care to retain
the Attorney-General in time."</p>

<p>"But what if the perjury on the other side was
too strong?" asked Edgar.</p>

<p>"We would nullify it," said Mr. Stubbs, "by
equally strong assertions; and, if necessary, stronger
on ours. The truth, sir, never suffices, when the
element of perjury is introduced by the other side.
It would not suit our laws of evidence, as at present
constituted."</p>

<p>"And you ask me, why I am not a lawyer?" said
Edgar, escaping.</p>

<p>"Fine young man, very fine young man," said Mr.
Stubbs, looking after him with something very like
a sigh. "But decidedly," and he touched his forehead 

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

with his forefinger, "something wrong here.
Such a pity, too, with such a father and a practice
made, as it were, to his hand. Don't I wish I had
had such a chance!"</p>

<p>"I say, Stubbs, old fellow," said the athletic
Thibblethwaite, the chief common-law clerk of the
office, who came in at that moment from executing
some dirty job or other, with his hands in his cut-away 
pockets and a white hat stuck on one side of
his head, "did you go to see the cove hanged this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Can't say that I did, Mr. Thibblethwaite. It's&mdash;let 
me see&mdash;thirty years since I saw the majesty of
the law vindicated. It's nothing now-a-days. Why
I've seen as many as seven hanged in one morning,
four for forgery, and three, I think, for sheep-stealing. 
One of the forgery lot was as fine a young
man as I ever set eyes on. It was worth while
seeing an execution then."</p>

<p>"Me and Bill Smithers, the chap over at Tozer's,"
replied the other, "we had a rare lark&mdash;didn't go to
bed all night. I wish they wouldn't hang 'em on
Monday though. It's so difficult to have a proper
spree on Sunday night. We were obliged to go in
for Van John and unlimited Loo, till half-past three.
My eyes! didn't we hear some spicy talk among the
thieves and their women! Bill Smithers said he
thought he knew something; but they took the shine
out of him, I can tell you. What do you think of
this, old boy?"</p>

<p>And he uttered something in the ears of the elder,
so ineffably foul and blasphemous, that one could

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

only imagine such a thing when heard to have been
some unstifled echo of the sulphurous eve of doom,
ere the fires of avenging Heaven were rained upon
the Cities of the Plain. Such language is, alas! by
no means uncommon now among the lower orders of
the British people. You may hear it any Sunday
evening in our crowded thoroughfares, uttered without 
even the grim and ghastly humour which fascinated 
Thibblethwaite and Bill Smithers, and caused
old Stubbs to laugh, until his eyes, like those of
"King Death" in the song, ran brine.</p>

Yet these were worthy and respectable men of
their class&mdash;not a quarter so bad as hundreds and
thousands of their compeers. Thibblethwaite was
a manly fellow enough, and a good husband to a
comely young wife and a brace of brats. Bill
Smithers was a kind-hearted, good-tempered fellow
enough, much given to the music-hall style of entertainment 
and enjoyment; but what of that? We are
speaking of England in the nineteenth century as it
exists.</p>

<p>"I say, Thib," said Snap, poking his ungainly head
out of his own particular den, "who do you think
has just been here?"</p>

<p>"I was just going to tell him," said old Stubbs.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said that gentleman. "Old Mother
Gilling, perhaps, begging as usual, as if she was likely
to get anything back out of him," jerking his thumb
in the direction of old Grinderby's room. "I actually
gave the old girl sixpence myself the other day to
get rid of her."</p>

<p>"Guess again," said Snap.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

<p>"That drunken vagabond Grimshaw, to see if he
can get another writ out of the governor to serve.
But once bit, twice shy, in that quarter."</p>

<p>"No," said Stubbs, "you're a long way from it."</p>

<p>"Well who was it, then? Tell us."</p>

<p>"Why, young Mr. Edgar, who cut away from
home ever so long ago, and who has become such a
swell on the Press."</p>

<p>"What, is he coming back again?" asked Thibblethwaite, 
who saw the prospect of a future but
distant partnership visibly darken before his prophetic
gaze.</p>

<p>Old Stubbs shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ain't he a fool?" he said.</p>

<p>"Would I have been such a duffer?" quoth Snap.</p>

<p>"No, but you couldn't have got your living as he
has," observed Mr. Thibblethwaite. "I dare say he
don't make less than five hundred a-year. None so
dusty that. I don't believe the old one would have
given him as much to spend, if he'd worked his head
off in this office."</p>

<p>"It's all very fine to talk of five hundred a-year,"
said Mr. Stubbs; "but there ain't many of them
literary chaps that make that money regular. Do
they ever leave anything when they die? Ain't folks
always being called upon to take tickets for the benefit
of their widows and children, at private theatricals
and the like? Don't tell me of five hundred a-year.
I don't believe they make three hundred regular, no,
not one out of ten of 'em."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Snap, "couldn't he have waited,

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

until the governor hopped the twig, and then he
could have done as he liked, and lived like a magnificent 
brick."</p>

<p>"Had a private skittle-ground with mahogany
skittles, eh? like somebody said he should like to, if
he was rich," said Thibblethwaite, "and married any
barmaid in England."</p>

<p>"Not such a fool!" growled Snap, "if you
mean me. I never said I'd marry any confounded
woman."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll punch your head.
Do you think there are no women fit to marry; because 
you never knew a respectable gal?" said the
chivalrous Thibblethwaite, who was thinking perhaps
of his own wife at that moment, and so vindicated
his manhood.</p>

<p>"What I was going to say," said Snap, "if you
would let a fellow speak, was, that if Mr. Edgar had
waited a year or two more, he might have fingered
all the old boy's tin. I never saw any one look much
worse than our governor's done latterly, and what's
more, in a very short space of time."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," said Mr. Stubbs. "I've
noticed he's lost flesh uncommon lately, and that's a
bad sign at his time of life."</p>

<p>"It's thirty thousand pounds at the least, ah! I
dare say fifty thousand pounds would be nigher the
mark, thrown clean away into the street," resumed
Snap, "and all to write a parcel of stuff in the newspapers, 
which nobody cares to read."</p>

<p>"Don't they?" said the common-law clerk. "<i>You</i>

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

don't, you mean. I shouldn't think it was much
reading you troubled yourself with, except the police
reports."</p>

<p>"Look at the public dinner they gave him on his
return from, where was it?&mdash;Italy or Russia, or some
such place," observed Mr. Stubbs. "I heard all
about it from one of the short-hand writers at the
Old Bailey. There was one hundred sat down in St.
James's Hall, at a guinea a head, and the speeches
they made were beautiful. Why there was a nobleman 
in the chair, the Earl of Pongo, who's a writer
himself."</p>

<p>"And a precious reprobate he is to be in a chair
anywhere out of Bedlam or Horsemonger-lane Gaol,
if all tales are true," said the incorrigible Snap; in
whom the bump of veneration was apparently decidedly 
small, and must have been beaten in by his
mother's flat-iron during his interesting babyhood.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Thibblethwaite, "a lord is a
lord; and what's more, this one is a regular psalm-singing 
swell, and goes in for the tip-top respectable,
and all that."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Snap, "every one to his taste,
as the old woman said when she kissed her cow, but
for my part I wouldn't thank a parcel of rich fools for
giving me a dinner, unless, indeed, they were to give
it to me alone, and content themselves with looking
on. A dinner is but a dinner, and they might as
well give a feller a guinea at once. I could get eight
at Stimpson's, for that price. What's the good of
seeing a parcel of fellows feeding away like so many
pigs in your honour, when they'd much better hand

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

you over the tin, or half of it, for that matter? It's
nothing more than a testimonial to the landlord of
the tavern&mdash;that's what it is. Of course, if you're
rich, that's another thing, but when a cove is rich,
he's a fool if he cares about such rubbish. He can
always have dinners, as long as he can give 'em,
at anybody's expense, and plenty of fine speeches,
and flattery too; and as for testimonials, he can give
himself one of them too, if he don't mind standing
the loss on the plate. It's the way most of them are
done. I tell you if a parcel of admirers was to give
me a dinner at St. James's Hall, or anywhere else,
I should grudge 'em every morsel they swallowed,
that's what I should."</p>

<p>"Well," said Thibblethwaite, "if you ain't about
the meanest, shabbiest-minded, most cantankerous
little cure that ever I came across, may I never
copy a declaration again. But there's deuced little
chance of your ever getting a dinner, unless you
should happen to be in a raffle for something handsome, 
and the winner had to stand a eighteenpenny
blow-out to the whole boiling of unsuccessful blokes.
And that wouldn't be exactly in your honour&mdash;would
it, Stubbs?" appealing to that gentleman.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly see the probability of Mr. Snap
being entertained by his friends," replied the old clerk.</p>

<p>"I see one way," quoth Thibblethwaite, musingly.
"It strikes me, Snap, if you were to emigrate one of
these days to Australia, or Nomansland, anywhere, I
mean, far enough to avoid the probability of return,
that those who know you might give a spread on the
occasion. I am sure I should be ready for one, and

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

I think Stubbs here would take the chair and be
eloquent&mdash;eh, old chap? Bill Smithers, I know,
would take a ticket&mdash;he likes you so much&mdash;and
favour us with his song of the 'Convict's Lament.'
It was only last night he said, speaking of you, 'I do
like that Snap, he is such an unmitigated little cad.' "</p>

<p>"You be hanged," said Snap. "You're always
shoving your chaff into me. There isn't one of you
in the office, as would have the pluck to do as I've
done for the lot of you, not an hour agone, and this
is what I get for it."</p>

<p>"What have you been and gone and done, eh,
Snappy?" said his tormentor.</p>

<p>"Why, told old Grinderby," replied that gentleman, 
"that we want to leave off business at two
o'clock on Saturdays, that you might get up the river
earlier with your crew, that's what I've done, and I've
given notice, or threatened to do it. But I know the
governor ain't such a fool as to part with me, though
he was in a way, I can tell you."</p>

<p>The artful Snap said nothing about the proposed
increase of salary.</p>

<p>"Then you're a trump, Snappy," cried Thibblethwaite, 
giving him a thump on the back that brought
tears into his eyes, "and you shan't be chaffed again;
no, not this term, if I know it. It's all fun, you
know."</p>

<p>"Fun or not, it hurts a fellow's feelings," whimpered 
Snap; "and I don't care if I do get turned
away. I suppose it's because I'm not able to fight
and stand up for myself. But I tell you I won't
stand it any longer from Smithers, no, not if it costs

<!-- vol 3 page 295 -->

me five pounds, I won't. He'd better look out,
though I am but a little un."</p>

The idea of the valorous Snap punching Mr.
Smithers, who was six feet one inch high, and had
put on the gloves with Ben Caunt, was too much for
Thibblethwaite, who laughed so immoderately, that
he nearly choked himself, and declared he must have
a glass of "pale," and would stand the expense of a
similar debauch for Snap.</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you what it is, old fellow," he said,
"if we get clear of the shop at two o'clock on Saturdays 
this summer, through your pluckiness, we'll give
you a dinner at Crimini, or anywhere else you like,
that we will, by &mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Saying which, the muscular Thibblethwaite grasped
his small companion, and dragged him round the
corner to a convenient "pub," whence the pair
emanated a quarter of an hour after, with their spirits
cheered, and feeling quite "bang up to the work,"
as the former elegantly remarked.</p>

<p>All this time, Mr. Grinderby sat, vainly trying to
get through the business of the day. Say what he
would, the desertion of his son was a terrible blow to
the old lawyer. For a long time he had hugged the
fond belief to his breast, that Edgar would come to
him some day penniless, penitent, and out at the
elbows, and ask him to make him as one of his hired
clerks in the office. The calf had already bled in his
imagination, that was to furnish the banquet on the
occasion of the young man's return, and he had
actually fixed upon the identical bin of old port (some
bought in at Aubrey's sale), from which he would

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

take the wine to be drunk on that day of triumph.
Scores of times had he emerged, in fancy, grimly
smiling, from his cellar, with a crusted bottle in each
trembling hand. He cherished that illusion no longer.
As he read with a species of painful fascination the
account of his son's successes in literature and journalism, 
he felt it as a record of so many disasters and
reverses to himself. His chief hope and wish in life
was crushed. What would he not have given to see
Edgar, the hard, cynical, and worldly advocate, the
legal Ahithophel, the forensic Pilate of the day,
washing his hands of every prisoner's blood, every
writhing litigant's loss, an eloquent human machine
wound up with a golden key to stifle truth, and gild
the specious lie; the accomplished modern counsel,
without heart or conscience, ready to laugh at his
own simulated emotion, so soon as a cause should be
won, to mock justice with a sneer, and trump injustice 
with a jest.</p>

<p>Let not this be taken as our estimate of the Bar;
it was merely Grinderby's enthusiastic aspiration of
what his son should have been. Then his dismal old
thoughts would revert to the lost letter again and
again.</p>

<p>"Why did I not burn it?" he asked himself, "at
once, as my habit is with such things. Why will
idiots like that Manvers write such compromising
trash? I have searched my pockets over twenty
times, after I was sure it was not in them. Pooh!
pooh! If I had dropped it anywhere, who is likely
to be such a fool as to interest himself about that

<!-- vol 3 page 297 -->

beggar Aubrey's affairs? Let's see. I am to meet
Manvers to-morrow evening at that dingy hole in
Deptford. I don't much like the job, but it must be
done, and then all will be smooth. How did he get
that paragraph in the papers; for of course it was
he? No one else can know. He has done it to terrify
me into compliance with his greedy terms. Well, I
will prepare a small deed of annuity payable in New
York. This, and a sum down, will be the best way of
settling the matter. It will keep him still in order;
for if he spent the money, he might still annoy me,
even without the legal proof in his hands. Besides, he
may die. Curse the fellow! What brought him back
here to trouble me? There is hemp enough in America&mdash;ay, 
and plenty of bowie-knives and Colt's revolvers. 
It is a great deal to pay to stop one mouth;
but then look what I shall gain in return for it?"
Mr. Grinderby at length concluded his work and
rang the bell, which Snap answered.</p>

<p>"Have you finished those papers, Mr. Snap?" he
asked, quite mildly.</p>

<p>"Not quite, sir," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Well then, you may finish them to-morrow morning. 
By-the-by, to-morrow is a half-holiday, on
account of the general illumination. The office will
be closed at two. We must have a little recreation
sometimes, Mr. Snap. 'All work and no play,' you
know the proverb. I've been thinking that you shall
have the Saturday afternoons, as you desire it so
much, and we must work an hour later, if requisite,
on other days."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

Mr. Snap's face expressed the most intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said; "I am sure we are all
much obliged. Good afternoon, sir."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Snap," repeated Grinderby, as
the door closed upon his favourite clerk. "Useful
fellow that. Musn't quarrel with him&mdash;can't quarrel
with everybody. How that insolent brute of a coachman 
upset me to-day! I am not what I used
to be."</p>

<p>Here a knock at the door was heard, and the boy
entered with some letters and papers. Mr. Grinderby
opened a newspaper, and after some time uttered an
exclamation. "Eh? What is this? More wolves on
my track. Curse them!" (Reads.) " 'Legal <i>on dit</i>.
The strong censure of the Lord Chief Justice lately
pronounced on the conduct of a solicitor in Webb's
Fields, <i>re</i> the affairs of a poor widow, will, it is said,
lead to ulterior proceedings. His lordship, it will
be remembered, regretted that the law had not been so
violated that he could punish the cruelty and extortion
of the solicitor in question, but hinted that he might be
struck off the rolls!' What! I defy them to show I
have done a single illegal act, in the case of that
hag, Gilling. They can't do, it, I say. A pretty
pass, when the strict practice of the law is to be commented 
on thus. Ha! ha! They can prove and do
nothing. I'll bring an action against the 'Evening
Banner' for libel. But it's growing serious. Twenty
years ago, I would have paid them to do it, and
snapped my fingers at them all. It is time to retire
from business. How disappointed that puppy Thibblethwaite 

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

will be. A half-holiday, indeed! I'll
give them a whole holiday for ever, the ungrateful
lot of them. There is not one worth his salt, save
Snap, and I believe he would sell me for five pounds
a-year more wages, the scoundrel. But I'll retire;
and my daughter shall keep my house, and I'll see
what they've all got to say against fifty thousand
pounds, and the management of the Aubrey estate.
Ha! that spasm again. I'll take a glass of wine,
before I get into a 'bus." So saying, Mr. Grinderby 
unlocked a cupboard and poured himself out
not one glassful but two, before taking his departure
<i>en route</i> for Peckham, a thing most unusual for
him.</p>

</div>

<p>THAT we do not entirely believe in the motto which
we have chosen for the heading of this chapter, it is
perhaps superfluous to observe. We rather incline
towards the philosophy of Master Simon Hexham
expressed in the above lines. But the exception
which justifies so many proverbial sayings, will serve
our turn. If a man returned to his calf-love, he
must possess the recipe of Medea, and be able not only

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

to renovate himself, but also the beloved object of
his early adoration. A man may cherish his first
love to the end, but then he never relinquishes it.
The cure of love is perfect. It does not linger in the
system, to break out in old age again. Therefore is
the Frenchman wrong, though his saying is none
the less pretty, amiable, and acceptable, for all that.
Nonsense is sometimes much more agreeable, and,
were we not afraid of uttering a paradox, we should
say, sometimes more sensible than sense. There are
even some tinsel sentiments which pass current always, 
and are stamped with so artistic a die, that we
esteem them more than the commonplace coin with
the true metallic ring of gold.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Luckless had become "bien rang&eacute;" since
we last saw anything of that careless, but not unprincipled 
libertine. Really, some good-for-nothing
persons are so much better, so much more estimable
and loveable, than some very good and proper
members of society, that we are sometimes inclined
to consider whether the supreme justice of the next
world will not reverse nearly all the judgments and
verdicts of mankind pronounced in this. That it will
do so to some extent, we have very little doubt. A
glowing epitaph may prove quite a drawback to salvation 
in most cases; and a tombstone recording the
virtues of some successful hypocrite turn to a heavy
millstone round the neck of that unfortunate person,
whose excellent qualities are so eloquently inscribed
thereon. The bland, passionate, and religious Lady
Jones whose merits were summed up by the statement 
that she "also painted in water-colours, and of

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

such is the Kingdom of Heaven," may find that her
somewhat inconsecutive but gushing panegyrist made
one mistake, and that the most important one, in
his summing up of her good qualities and their
desert. Nothing is more sublime than the coolness
of human assurance with which we book our departed
friends, relatives, or acquaintances, for redemption.
To us there is something very awful in these mock
passports; this familiar recommendation to Heaven.
With regard to the easy, passing verdicts of the
world, let us imagine a case. We see a man tall,
gaunt, and haggard, enter a garret where a consumptive 
woman is stretched on the bare boards, and two
children with still lovely hair and eyes gaze wildly
on him, and, shivering, implore their father for food.
He has none to give. A year ago, he was a prosperous 
man; but he intrusted his affairs to a lawyer
and was stripped of all. He has seen those once
plump darlings grow thinner day by day. They
prattled to him at first of the altered circumstances
which surrounded them, whilst a lump in his throat
would nearly choke him as he gazed at them, and
hot tears rolled down his cheeks as he turned away.
Then came the next phase of stern distress, and then
the mute suffering of the darlings whom he loved,
that unhappy man; loved with the inexpressible yearnings 
of a father's heart. His wife, his partner, his
consoler, has faded; until it seems a ghost that silently
parts from him and receives him in silence with
bloodless lips and big staring eyes. He seeks work,
but finds none; and the rain wets him, till rheumatism 
racks his joints. He has pawned everything

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

that he <i>can</i> pawn, as the winter brings holly and
Christmas to the well-fed and prosperous&mdash;his own
vest, his wife's under-clothing, the children's little
frocks. He has pawned his razors long ago, and
his beard grows stubbly and wild. One night his
misery culminates. He fears, lest one of his children
may die, ere the morn arrive; and if that it arrive,
it will bring no hope. He is not drunk, but grief
has mounted to his head and made him mad. So he
clenches his fist, and rushes forth like a wild-beast to
get food for his little ones and their dam by means of
his fierceness and strength. He meets the man who
has robbed him, he seizes him by the throat. The
man has a pocket-book, money in notes and gold,
a thousand pounds and more. The garotter has torn
it from the respectable robber's grasp, when a policeman 
fells him in his turn to the ground. A crowd
assembles. Justice and Law are triumphant. Who
pities the garotter?&mdash;none! Who does not sympathise 
with and congratulate the elderly gentleman,
whom the ruffian knocked down and so nearly succeeded 
in plundering? Read the papers the next
day, read the trial and sentence of the offender. He
is ordered to be flogged, and a leading article appears
rejoicing in so wholesome an example, so reassuring
and agreeable a fact. In the mean time a coroner's
inquest has been held on the wife and one child, and
the other little dazed atomy lingers in the workhouse,
where it is Heaven's own mercy if she dies. The
true spoilator and robber rewards the policeman with
half a crown; conduct rather shabby, but prudent
and wise. Besides, can he not afford to be mean?

<!-- vol 3 page 304 -->

The policeman only did his duty, and is paid for
doing it. Were there no future world, one had
better be a clawless crab in mid-ocean, or an atomic
monster about to be swallowed by a less infinitesimal
monster, the pieuvre of a rain-drop, than even witness 
such irrational tortures in beings of a larger
and completer growth. And in that future world,
how will these things be adjusted and paid?</p>

<p>Sir Harry Luckless was not by any means a bad
man. He had never deserted a woman, nor deceived
a friend. Through life we have found that he who
is capable of acting falsely to a woman, would do so
to a man, if he dared. The gay fellow, your unscrupulous 
Lothario, who promises marriage, maintenance,
or uses any other deceit to a confiding girl, would
steal his friend's bank-notes or diamond breast-pin, if
he were not afraid of the consequences. Sir Harry
was not one of these; but he had spent, lavished, or
lost the greater part of his fortune, and being poor
as well as having been fast, was looked upon as a
very bad fellow indeed.</p>

<p>The truth is, Sir Harry had pulled up, ere it was
quite too late. He had still a few, a very few thousands 
left, still a little corner of his once large estates
bringing him in some four hundred pounds a-year.
He had come to "know the world" rather late in
life&mdash;the best dispositions naturally do. An old head
on young shoulders is often index to a bad heart.
Sir Harry was sick of London, sick of Society, weary
of the empty round of fashionable pleasures. But
not being intellectual, nor even fond of reading, he
had no resource in himself. He could not afford to

<!-- vol 3 page 305 -->

hunt any longer, and he could not shoot all the year
round. So Sir Harry was not altogether happy, and
had a great desire to emigrate, being divided between
the "diggings" of California and a sheep-walk in
Australia. The latter had the preference in his heart.
Sir Harry's thoughts often reverted to Kitty Dareall.
He had never loved any one half so much; nay, he
had never loved any one else at all. He was one
of the very few persons aware of the true nature of
her relations with the Duke of Chalkstoneville. But
he had never sought to see her since the duke's death.
We verily believe that but for the large sum which
Kitty inherited, Sir Harry would never have rested,
till he had found her out, and made her an offer of
his heart and hand. But he was too proud and sensitive 
to seek her now that she had become rich, and
from such a source.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for me to know that there was
no harm between them, but look what fellows would
say," said Sir Harry, very truly, to himself; and yet
his thoughts would frequently of late shape themselves 
into some such train of reflection as the following, 
in which he is now indulging as he saunters
down Bond-street.</p>

<p>"Poor dear Kitty! How I have missed her! I
used to fancy that I adored that cold and beautiful
creature, Mrs. Aubrey, at whose rescue I assisted
nearly the last time I saw Kitty. I wonder what
has become of Mrs. Aubrey, and that husband of
hers too. Let me see, it was about a week or so
after the attempted suicide, that Kitty came to see
me, and laying her hand upon my shoulder, said,

<!-- vol 3 page 306 -->

'Harry, you have a good heart, will you keep a
secret?' 'Yes,' I said, 'I will do anything for you,
Kitty.' I think I see her smile now, as she said,
'Why, I thought you were in raptures about some
one else?' And I replied, 'I never loved any one
half as much as I do you.' 'Would you marry
me?' she exclaimed, quite suddenly. '<i>Marry</i> you?'
said I. 'Kitty, what would the world say?' She
burst out laughing, and asked me if I thought she
was in earnest; but it was not her usual merry
laugh, and I fancied she seemed very sad and preoccupied 
afterwards. I have kept her secret well,
though I often longed at first to tell Aubrey that his
wife was living. I never saw Kitty but once again,
and that was to ask me to push the fortunes of some
Polish or Hungarian opera-singer; the very same
who appeared on Saturday night, was it, or Thursday 
last, for the first time in London? What a fool
I was to throw my chance away! The 'world!'
what do I care for the world? I wish I had married
Kitty; for if a man can't be happy without a woman,
what's the use of arguing the point? She was never
a twentieth part so bad at any time as people said of
her, and I've never seen such another. Confound
the world! What will it do for any one? Flatter
him when he is rich, and abuse him when he is poor;
but never make him happy, or fill a vacant space in
his home or heart. After all, what right has a fellow,
who has led such a life as I have done, to be so very
particular? She was good enough for me; and those
who did not care to visit her might have stayed

<!-- vol 3 page 307 -->

away. I am sure Mrs. Filmer Dawson would have
recognised her, and that dear Lady Tredarno."</p>

<p>Thinking thus, Sir Harry actually ran against a
lady deeply veiled, who came suddenly round a corner
on the very day of the events which we have recorded 
in the last chapter as having occurred at Mr.
Grinderby's office. Sir Harry took his hat off, and
made a sincere and gentlemanly apology. Both he
and Aubrey were of that order of men, who always
respect a woman; if old, on account perhaps of the
memory of their mother; if young and handsome,
from natural gallantry; if plain, from chivalrous
respect to womankind; if poor, because perhaps they
have hearts attuned to an old chivalric air of the
Middle Ages. We must say this even of Aubrey
with all his faults: he never even repulsed any
wretched castaway in the streets, save with gentleness
and courtesy. And rare, indeed, it is, even when the
most abandoned creature does not appreciate the sad
reproof conveyed in such a style and tone far more
readily than she will yield to the repugnant snuffle of
the "Saint," or the brutal rebuff of the stern and
Pharisaical, or heartless and profligate man. In this
case, there was nothing remarkable in Sir Harry's
courtesy; for the veiled lady had an elegant tournure,
and apparently faultless form. Whoever she was she
hesitated, drew back, and then in sweet and silvery
accents pronounced his name.</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Luckless!" she said.</p>

<p>"That's my name," he replied. "That voice. Is
it possible?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 308 -->

<p>The lady flung back her veil, and disclosed the
features of Kitty Dareall, a little paler, but perhaps
more refined and enchanting than ever.</p>

<p>"Am I much changed, Harry?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! Kitty! Kitty!" was the reply. "I was
thinking of you at that moment, indeed I was. But
that's not strange, since I'm always thinking of
you."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she said. "And can Sir Harry Luckless 
be so constant to any one thought? I could not
pass you without speaking. And, indeed, I am very
glad to have met you, for I want you to do me a
favour."</p>

<p>"Anything, anything in the world," replied Sir
Harry.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Kitty, with something like a show of
her former gaiety; "it is nothing very dreadful, no
mighty proof of devotion. Sir Knight."</p>

<p>"Kitty! dear Kitty!" said Sir Harry, very
earnestly, "I have met you, thank Heaven, just in
time. I have determined to go abroad, to emigrate,
to leave England probably for ever. Will you be
mine? Will you marry me and go with me? I have
just sufficient fortune left. But I forgot, you are rich
now, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That," said Kitty, interrupting him, "is nothing,
and might easily be got over. I could, and probably 
should, give the greater part of my fortune
away."</p>

<p>"Do! do!" cried Sir Harry; "that will remove
every obstacle. It has only been that which has prevented 
my seeking you these three years past."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 309 -->

<p>"There are other obstacles," replied Kitty, gravely.
"The duties I have to perform."</p>

<p>"What better duty," cried Luckless, "can you
have than to look after a poor fellow like me? You
won't go away again, will you, Kitty. Where are
you staying? Tell me everything, my own dear,
dear Kitty!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she replied, mournfully, but not angrily;
"you must not talk like that, or we shall not meet
again. And now I will tell you what I want. It is
your escort to the Opera to-morrow night. You know
who sings, the incomparable Bianca Stellini, the new
soprano. Come, you kept a secret for me admirably
once. I will intrust you with another. Do you
know who she is?"</p>

<p>"Who she is?" said Sir Harry. "Who she is?
How should I? I have been told she is not an
Italian; but a Hungarian, or some such thing. But
I've heard nothing particular about her."</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" asked Kitty.</p>

<p>Sir Harry pondered. "How can I?" he said.
"Besides, I don't know anything now; I'm quite out
of the old set."</p>

<p>"A woman would have divined it long ago," resumed 
Kitty.</p>

<p>"The Luckless family were never good at riddles,"
replied Sir Harry; "and you always said I was remarkably 
stupid, you know. But come, tell me; I
can't say I should feel much interest, if it were not
you who ask me."</p>

<p>"What do you think, then, when I tell you that

<!-- vol 3 page 310 -->

Bianca Stellini, the famous singer, is no other than
Mrs. Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Sir Harry, "Impossible! But
Mrs. Aubrey is an Englishwoman."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kitty, "and haven't you heard of an
Irishman being a Turk, ere now, and even a Chinese,
and I don't know what besides?"</p>

<p>"You have astonished me!" cried Sir Harry.
"And doesn't everybody know her?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely a soul. You wouldn't have known her
to-night, if I hadn't told you. Lady Madeiraville,
who was at Rome, when she was studying there,
knows, and so of course does her husband, and two
or three more, but that is all."</p>

<p>"And have you spoken to her yet?" asked Sir
Harry.</p>

<p>"No," said Kitty, "I have not. I have seen her;
but only at a distance."</p>

<p>"She has not cut you," cried Sir Harry, indignantly, 
"after all that you did?&mdash;I mean, she is not
ungrateful, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Kitty; "it is not her fault that we
have not met. Our paths in life are different. But
I mean to see her and hear her too to-morrow night,
and I want you to accompany me. I want to be
with some one to whom I can speak of her. You
will oblige me, will you not? Take a private box,
and do not put it off, as you used to do, till the last
moment, or I shall be disappointed indeed. Let
it be tolerably near the stage, and on the second
tier."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 311 -->

<p>"I will go at once," said Sir Harry; "but tell me
where shall we meet?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening at a quarter to eight," answered 
Kitty, "I will be here in a brougham. But,
before you go, I want most earnestly to ask you a
question. Do you know what has become of her
husband, Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I don't," was the answer. "I haven't
seen him; no, not since I saw you the last time but
one, the night she was rescued. I heard of him a
few times, but not for long. He was sold up, and
became an author, which is more than I could have
done. Stingray said he met him in great distress
somewhere and relieved his necessities; but you
know what a one he is to make the most of a spiteful
tale."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" said Kitty. "If you can learn
anything about Aubrey, pray do. I kept him in
sight for a short time, and sent him some small sums
anonymously on two or three occasions. But I lost
sight of him all at once. I fear the worst; I fear
that he is dead, a prey perhaps to remorse and to
want."</p>

<p>"I hope not!" cried Sir Harry. "Especially if
you think there would be any chance of a reconciliation; 
for I suppose that is what you want to see,
with your good, kind heart. Dear, dear Kitty! how
I love you."</p>

<p>"If you talk like this, Harry, I won't come to-morrow 
evening," said Kitty.</p>

<p>"How this dress becomes you," said Sir Harry.

<!-- vol 3 page 312 -->

"It is not much like that I last saw you in. I remember 
everything you wore, even to the very ribbon
on your dear little head."</p>

<p>"Well, dear Harry!" she replied, "I will wear that
very dress once more, to-morrow night. Be punctual!
And now, adieu!"</p>

<p>"Punctual, indeed!" quoth Sir Harry. "Punctual! 
And will you be sure, quite certain to come?
And if I shouldn't see you to-morrow, will you not
tell me where you live, where I may call, or even
write?"</p>

<p>"I shall be sure to come, if I am alive and well,"
said Kitty; "and if anything did prevent me, I
would write to you to your club. There, go and get
the box. Farewell till to-morrow, Harry!"</p>

<p>"You will be sure to come?" quoth Sir Harry once
more, raising her hand towards his lips.</p>

<p>"Go!" she said.</p>

<p>He raised his hat and parted from her. He walked
towards the Opera House, like a man in a dream,
and very nearly left the box-office without waiting
for change for a twenty-pound note.</p>

<p>"He loves me truly," said Kitty to herself, as she
pursued her way alone, once more deeply veiled, and
bent on some charitable aim. "He loves me truly.
Would that I might reward such affection! Reward
it? Would it be a reward? Would it be true and
just in one like me to bear his honourable name?
Yet he of all living men knows most of my unhappy
history&mdash;the best and the worst! Four years ago,
had he asked me, 'twould have been different; and
what might we be now&mdash;happy, or most unhappy&mdash;who 

<!-- vol 3 page 313 -->

knows? I never could have borne a reproach;
the slightest coldness, even imagined on my part,
the very superficial coolness into which married life
will naturally resolve itself, even when deep and
tender regard is only deeper and firmer, because it is
undemonstrative and unseen, would have pierced my
bosom with continual thorns. No, it cannot be,
must not be, shall not be! One more night of apparent 
gaiety, one more glimpse at the world of
fashion and frivolity, one more visit to the Opera,
that scene of splendour, where the senses are dazzled
by sight and sound, where all that wealth and art can
furnish to fascinate the brain and heart will thrill
through every fibre of my being, in companionship
with him whom I love! It is a dangerous trial; but
shall I shrink from it? No; it is thus that I will
rebuke and chastise my soul. I will dare it this
once. I must and will see her, her to whom I owe
redemption, if I am to be redeemed. I must see her in
her triumph, her glory, her radiance. It is at once
an indulgence and a trial. I will surrender myself to
the enchantment; I will enjoy, brave, suffer all, and
then break the spell, and clasp the penance to my
breast&mdash;cost what it may&mdash;but this once, only this
once. Heaven requires not a repeated martyrdom,
even from one such as I am. It must be the first,
last, only time; and then I will return to the life I
have appointed myself, the duties I have undertaken,
again. Yet I wish&mdash;no! I will not be weak enough
to wish I had not met him; for if I need it, I can
and will pray for strength."</p>

<p>Poor Kate! We shall see if thy exalted enthusiasm 

<!-- vol 3 page 314 -->

will suffice to carry thee on in the narrow and
thorny path which thou hast chosen, unconquered
not only by the pomps and vanities of the world, but
by the affections of the heart, the yearnings of a requited 
love, and all that could make earth to thee a
foretaste of the forgiveness of Heaven!</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">MR. STINGRAY'S RAPTURES.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">The veriest pretender who has had wit enough to secure a tow-rope
in the wake of the great steam-ship, "Public Opinion," on the Ocean
of Life, may deride the best efforts of the independent master-mariner
to buffet with the adverse winds and stormy billows which retard his
onward career, even if they do not swamp him altogether, and drown
his hopes, fortunes, and existence in the vortex of untimely fate.&mdash;<i>Dr.
Blokeham's "Essay on Success,"</i> chap. v.</p>

<p>AND what was Blanche thinking and doing? Had
her sense of injury been softened by the knowledge
which had reached her of Aubrey's terrible trials and
humiliation? Undoubtedly it had; but scarcely to
such a point, as to wish for a reconciliation with her
husband. Pity, a deep interest in his fate and welfare, 
she undoubtedly felt; but she had really never
proposed to herself such a thing as a reunion. Once
or twice, when the subject had been tenderly and
delicately approached by Violet and Susan, she had
thought of it; but it was with a shiver of repugnance,
a sensation of something almost approaching to horror
and aversion. Not even, when she clasped her boy
to her breast, and saw in his eyes and features the
childish image of her ending and lost husband, did

<!-- vol 3 page 316 -->

she ever feel a return of her old devotion, a pang of
the love that was indeed dead within her. At times
the insult, the neglect, the cruelty seemed as fresh
as ever. She had corresponded with Kitty occasionally; 
but never alluded to Aubrey in her letters.
Did she know who Kitty really was? Had she ever
learnt that her benefactress had been the guiltless
cause of her misery? We are inclined to think not.
The Signora's appearance in London had been a
tremendous success. Of course, it could not fail to
be so, barring accidents, such as a break-down from
overwrought feelings, coming accredited, as she did
to John Bull, from the land of song, from Rome,
Milan, Florence, and even from St. Petersburg. Had
the musical portion of the British public been disappointed 
in her, the unmusical, and by far larger
portion, who go to the Opera, because it's <i>the</i> thing
to do, would have carried her through rapturously.
But the fact is, she was a great <i>artiste</i>, and on her
first appearance at Her Majesty's she outdid herself.
It was delightful to hear Stingray, as if he were some
inflated old German music-master, and she his only
daughter. He affected to decline all invitations upon
Opera nights. He said that he shut his eyes, and
could have believed that "our dear gifted Malibran"
were alive again.</p>

<p>"To see and hear such a woman was," he said,
"his glory as a man, but his shame as an Englishman.
For how immeasurably below her are our countrywomen, 
not only in voice but in dramatic art!"</p>

<p>This he said to Lady Madeiraville, who began innocently 
enough to think him a bit of a humbug.

<!-- vol 3 page 317 -->

But Stingray was determined to be enthusiastic&mdash;he
felt it was safe and right&mdash;and enthusiastic he was.
So he ran about like an old rogue elephant trumpeting 
her praise.</p>

<p>Amongst her most devoted admirers, too, was our
friend the artist, whom our readers may remember "on
the prowl" with Stingray and Sir Harry at an earlier
date in our narrative. He was perfectly ecstatic in
bad Italian, and reminiscences of Rome. He had
latterly gone in for being a young old fellow, instead
of an old young fellow, and took especial pride in
the silvery whiteness of his hair and moustache. He
had grown louder and more gushing than ever. He
did not witness the debut of the Signora; but he went
in evening costume to the crushing-room and said
he had done so. He read all the critiques of the
journals to enable him to talk unreservedly of her
performance.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you," said an acquaintance. "Were
you in the pit?"</p>

<p>"Not I," was the answer. "I was in a private
box with a lady, a musical friend, a charming little
creature, who says she adores me. Aw! I pretend
to believe her. It's the best thing to do, eh? I knew
her&mdash;aw!&mdash;in Rome!"</p>

<p>The other stared at him, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>In the midst of her triumphs, the Signora instituted 
every possible inquiry through Edgar Leslie to
find out what had become of her husband, in whose
death she persistently refused to believe. "All that I
wish is," she said, "to place him in comfort, if he be
in want; of course anonymously, for his sake and for

<!-- vol 3 page 318 -->

mine. For myself, I only hope that we may not meet
again; and if I know him, he would sooner die than
receive aid at my hands."</p>

<p>As we have seen she had allowed Susan, with some
little hesitation and difficulty, to impart her secret to
Tops, and promised very shortly to grace their wedding 
with her presence. In acceding to this, she
thought it might be of assistance in finding out the
whereabouts of Aubrey, and she expressed great
delight, when she heard that the Downy had turned
up, and looked forward to an interview with that
facetious individual with no little eagerness. From
Kitty she had heard nothing since her arrival in
England, and was expecting a communication from
her protectress, as she called her, with the utmost
anxiety.</p>

<p>On the Monday evening, a note was placed in her
hands. It was brief and laconic.</p>

<p>"ESTEEMED MADAM!" it ran, "I shall see you
and hear you, D. V., to-morrow night, and in a few
days will ask for an interview before bidding you an
eternal adieu, to congratulate you on your glorious
success, to tell you some things which I think you
ought to hear, and perhaps to ask a great favour.
Till then, adieu! Remember me in your prayers.</p>

<p class="right">"THE SISTER CATHERINE."</p>

<p>"Who can she be?" said Leslie to Violet. "Some
noble Catholic lady devoted to good works. Real,
substantial, and yet romantic charity&mdash;the most
'Catholic' devotion to good deeds. Holy living, in

<!-- vol 3 page 319 -->

its best and purest sense, is one thing in which I must
say I think the religion of Luther is in some few
instances surpassed by that of Rome. There is one
other thing too," he said. "There is not in God's
house that odious distinction made between the rich
and the poor, which often puts a Christian church on
a par with a mere place of secular amusement. But,
oh! the hideous evil of the rest, as I have seen it in
Italy and in Spain."</p>

<p>"It is very singular," said Violet. "I have asked
Blanche over and over again, if she could remember
anything which gave a clue to this mysterious being.
She declares she can remember nothing, except that
once, when she was recovering from a fainting fit,
she talked quite familiarly of dukes and duchesses and
lords. I hope we shall be allowed to see her, when
she does make her appearance&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"I am not usually very curious," replied Leslie;
"but I confess, in this case, I am most anxious to
meet this benevolent being, so interesting and, as I
learn, so comparatively young. I wonder how she
arrays herself, and whether she wears a huge white
head-dress and black dress, and carries a large rosary
and bunch of keys at her waist."</p>

<p>"I declare," said Violet, "I don't know, but that
I shall feel a little jealous of her."</p>

<p>They both laughed heartily at this idea.</p>

<p>"What mischief are you plotting, you young
folks?" said the Signora, approaching them from the
next room.</p>

<p>Violet told her without reserve what she had said to
cause their mirth.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 320 -->

<p>A shade passed over the Signora's face; but she
looked at them indulgently and said:</p>

<p>"Laugh away at your own young fancies, and
may you always be light-hearted as now. I know
you could not turn suffering into a jest; so may your
mirth never be changed into grieving over the world's
injustice and your own untoward fate. The lady to
whom you have alluded is not only one of the best,
but, I fear, unhappiest of beings. I trust she will
allow me to make her known to those whom I love.
Ah! my child," running her hand through Violet's
hair; "even you do not know all my sad history,
nor what this mysterious woman who has roused
mirthful images in your thoughts has done for me.
Suffice it to say that I owe her more than life&mdash;the
desire to live&mdash;perhaps the mercy and forgiveness of
Heaven."</p>

<p>"Forgive our thoughtlessness, dear lady," said
Edgar; "we were picturing to ourselves a solemn
Sister of Charity of the Bromptonian order. It
was mere foolish talk. We meant no harm. I am,
indeed, sorry for it; since we have hurt your feelings
thus."</p>

<p>"Nay," replied the Signora. "It is I who am
wrong. I forgot, at first, that you did know all
the circumstances attending my acquaintance with
this lady, this extraordinary being, to whom I, to
whom we all, owe so much. Were it not for her,
what might have become of this dear child? You,
at any rate, would probably never have known her.
See, Edgar, what you too owe to the Sister Catherine,
as she calls herself."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 321 -->

<p>"All the happiness of my life," murmured Edgar.
"How I long to meet this good fairy, or rather this
noble woman; and to press her hand with affectionate
respect, and to tell her all that I owe her."</p>

<p>"And I, too," said Violet, "who owe her happiness&mdash;perhaps 
life; for you tell me," turning to
the Signora, "that I should not have met you, save
for her."</p>

<p>"She ought now to be happy," rejoined the Signora; 
"if the happiness and blessings of others have
any effect." And she smiled affectionately, as she
regarded those two young lovers, and then turned
away and sighed! Was she thinking of her own
brief and happy days of courtship at Lady Courcy's?
We imagine that she was. She was not an angel,
but a woman with a great sorrow, which had lately
been wakened up in her heart.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">A HANDFUL OF TENPENNY NAILS.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"They thought he'd gone out of town, you see, and he hadn't, that's
all; and no one came anigh the place, at least them as did didn't think
anythink of findin' his door closed, he was a man of sech very independent 
habits. Well, after about three months, leastways ten weeks on
the Friday after he was first missed, the clerks in the office below began
to complain of a gamey smell. At last they declared they couldn't
stand that game no longer, so they sent a depytation to the Steward.
After some inquiries and a good deal of sniffing on the stairs, the Inn
sent for a locksmith to break open his door. There they found him,
sure enough, a-lying all among his papers, and the bills as he'd bin a
discountin' of. They was most of 'em overdue, afore he was found; but
them as had given 'em didn't seem to have troubled much to find him,
with the exception at first of two or three as wanted renewals. There was
one come the next day, as see it in the newspapers, and said it was his
salvation. He didn't seem to care in the least about the smell; but asked
if the deceased had left any will or executioners. I told him as there
was none found yet; and he said there was a Providence in 'Eaven.
'Yes, sir.' says I, 'but, begging your pardon, I don't think that's
exactly the direction of him as is gone.' 'You've about hit it, Mrs.
What's-your-name,' says he, and I never see a gent larf so hearty.
'My name is Patty Priggins,' says I, 'at your sarvice,' for I can't
abear being called out of my name. 'You can larf as much as you
please, sir; but wherever he's went to, as is gone&mdash;which it don't
sinnify a pin's pint to us as is left, and why should it?&mdash;he's took with
him four shillings a-week from a fammerly of nine children, as is down
with measles and hooping-cough at this very minnit, and no one ain't
very likely to take these chambers agen, which is what the unfortynite
creeter might a thought of afore he was took so bad, if he'd 'ad a spark
of feeling.' 'You don't mean to say that, Mrs. Priggumbob,' he answered; 
and gave me half a sovereign, and bolted so sudden that I
hadn't time even to thank him, much less ask his name. I heard afterwards 
he was an Irish barrinet, and it's my opinion that he was down
very heavy in them bills. But it's an ill wind that blows nobody any

<!-- vol 3 page 323 -->

good, and the chambers was painted and let soon after, and I got six
shillings a-week to do for the gent as took 'em, besides perkisites. So
I hadn't much reason to complain of the orfully sudden death in
chambers, as the newspapers call it. Drat it, we must all die some
time, as well as live."&mdash;<i>Gossip of Webb's Fields</i>.</p>

<p>"MORNIN', mate!" quoth the Downy to Tops, as
he met that individual and his betrothed at the early
hour of eight A.M., the day after, by appointment at
a handy little public, in Maddox-street, Regent-street.
"My sarvice to you, Mrs. Susan!" and he made a
most elaborate bow.</p>

<p>"You've grown very polite lately, Mr. Downy,"
remarked that lady.</p>

<p>"Vy" rejoined that individual, "I've bin over in
Paris, not so werry long since neither, along vith
some 'osses for the Hemperor. Didn't I tell yer
of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I believe you did," said Susan, "but I own
that I forgot it when I spoke."</p>

<p>"To business," said Tops, "as soon as you two
have done with your fine speeches. What shall it be,
Mr. Downy?"</p>

<p>"Vell!" replied the Downy, "I'm for a drop of
cow's juice and 'arf a kevarten o' old Tom."</p>

<p>"And I'll take a glass of pale, miss, if you please.
No, stop! I'll have three-pennorth of brandy and a
little cold water."</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, the party sat
down in a cosey little corner, while the barmaid continued 
her operations of cleaning up preparatory to
the day's business.</p>

<p>"Now then," asked Tops, "have you squared it
with Mr. Lanner?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 324 -->

<p>"Right as nails," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And the settling day?" continued Tops.</p>

<p>"This werry evenin', a course, cos of the appintment 
in the letter. I say, ha! ha! jest look here!"
And he pulled out half a dozen tenpenny nails from
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Whatever are those for, Mr. Downy?" inquired
Susan.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Lanner he says that he don't vant
the lieyer there at all. He says ve can polish hoff
vun on 'em better nor two. Besides, it's Mr. Leslie's
hopinion, him as has 'ad the manedgement of your
lady's affairs. He see Lanner hisself, last night."</p>

<p>"I see," said Susan. "It's quite right. I know
all about it. They don't want to mix Mr. Grinderby 
up, any more than they can help in the matter."</p>

<p>"At hall ewents," said the Downy, "the inspector, 
he says, 'You vant to nail that 'ere vill, don't
yer? and I vant to nail this 'ere Manvers,' says he,
'and I don't vant no onnecessary trouble about the
matter.' Vell, ve are to go to the rendywoo kvite
permiscuous, togged out so that our own mothers
vouldn't know us, that is, t'others' mothers, and not
mine; for it vould 'ave puzzled her to know me at
hany time, considerin' I never 'ad the honner of her
acquaintance, since I wos born. Vell, the game wos
to hinder old Grinderby from comin'; and Lanner, he
axed me hif I could put him hup to any vay of
stoppin' hup his earth. Vell, I considered a bit, and
then I hit it hoff, and Lanner, he larfed so 'arty, I
thort he'd 'av bust."</p>

<p>"And whatever is it?" asked Tops. "It hasn't

<!-- vol 3 page 325 -->

anything to do with my upsetting of him, I hope.
Besides, I turned him up last night. I ain't any
longer in his sarvice; and so I couldn't do it if I
would, which I'm altogether doubtful if I could ever
have made up my mind to it at all."</p>

<p>"Don't you fret," said the Downy. "You've
got nothink to do with it at hall. It's my plant haltogether, 
and I flatters myself it's reyther neat, and
werry creditable to my hancestry."</p>

<p>"I can't see," said Tops, "unless you or some one
else'll knock him down on the road, or take him into
custody, as if he was an hindependent elector going
to record his vote in a free country, how you are
to stop him from going to the rendyvoo."</p>

<p>"Can't yer?" said the Downy. "Then I can,
that's all. You see these nails, don't yer?"</p>

<p>"Well, they're big enough," returned Tops, "any
how."</p>

<p>"I've bin a gimbletin' of old Grinderby's horfice-door 
this werry mornin'. Fust of hall, I was agoin'
to lock him in; but ve thought if he hollered and the
laundress come vith the key, as in course she yould,
he might get out afore he wos yanted. That's all.
Now d'yer twig?"</p>

<p>"But supposing," said Tops, "that any of the
limbs of Satan&mdash;I mean the clerks&mdash;is there?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you yourself tell me yesterday as he's
agoin' to give 'm a half hollerday this werry arternoon 
on account of the general flare-up to-night?"</p>

<p>"But suppose he shouldn't remain there himself,"
suggested Susan.</p>

<p>"Squared," returned the Downy. "Squared agen.

<!-- vol 3 page 326 -->

We've written a letter on the special makin' an appointment 
at four o'clock, and the job'll be done at
three and a 'arf."</p>

<p>"I hope you've not had a hand in writing it, Mr.
Downy," said Susan, laughing.</p>

<p>"Considerin' as writin' wos a part of my edicashun 
as wos left out by partickler rekvest," replied
that gentleman, "I considers your perlite remark as
good as hanswered. Mr. Lanner did that part of
the job at my sur-jest-shun, and borrered a seal as
big as a young cheese-plate from a Government
horfice."</p>

<p>"But suppose you should be nailed and locked up
instead, which you will be, if you're caught doing
any such a job?" asked Mr. Tops.</p>

<p>The Downy assumed an air of mild pity and patronising 
rebuke.</p>

<p>"If I'm caught," he said, "I'll send to you for
bail; but don't stop at home a purpose. In the fust
place, I'm agoin' togged as a carpenter, vith a paper
cap and apron, and a basket o' tools. Them there
stairs in the Fields is jest suitable for sech a game.
Hif any one should come by, vy I jest moves hup to
another floor. Hall I vants now is a pot o' paint,
the werry blackest paint as I can get. Lend us a
bob, mate, vill yer, to get it, for the hinspector he
von't come down vith nothin' aforehand. A course
I knows vy. He's afeard I should 'ave a drop. He
don't know me, and I don't vant to cause him any
onnecessary alarm. Yer see he ain't po-eticle, ain't
the capting, and don't make no hallowance for the
little hamiable veaknesses of natur."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 327 -->

<p>"Here you are," said Tops. "But hang me if I
know what you're going to be up to with that paint."</p>

<p>"You'll know fast enough," was the reply, "ven
you or your missus here 'as wrote me a letter has I
vants to slip into old Grinderby's box, ven I've done
the trick. I say, miss," to the barmaid, "vill you
oblige this lady vith a sheet of note-paper and a pen
and ink?"</p>

<p>The young lady immediately busied herself in
getting the materials ready.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried Tops, who began to relish the
business. "I'll tell you what it is. If you do this
successful, you deserve an annuity for life, like the
great Mr. Sayers, and that's the only thing that
would suit your complaint. And what's more, if I
know anything, you'll get it. If we could only find
Mr. Arthur now!"</p>

<p>"You'll drop on him safe enough," said the
Downy; "and afore long, I reckon."</p>

<p>Tops shook his head. "I only hope it is as you
say; but I'm afraid you were mistaken in thinking
you've seen him."</p>

<p>"You be blowed," was the elegant response. "Do
you think I'm a fool? I don't wear a heye-glass,
do I?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "we'll find him if he is alive.
Let's advertise in Austrely."</p>

<p>"Better advertise here first," said Susan.</p>

<p>"You was always a little jibber and bolter, Sue.
It's my opinion he's in Austrely. But we'll try both.
Now then for the letter."</p>

<p>Susan sat down to write, and the Downy, with

<!-- vol 3 page 328 -->

many apologies, lit a pipe, which he declared was
always the practice of the Great Napoleon, when
dictating his despatches.</p>

<p>"There's many things they don't put into books,"
he said; "but I heerd it from a soger as see him
a-writin' his letters on a hair trunk in the Vest
Injies."</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was ever there," ventured
Susan.</p>

<p>"Vell," said the Downy, "arter that, wot's the
use of hargymint?"</p>

<p>"Come," said Tops, "we are losing time. Let's
have another drain and then fire away."</p>

<p>"No," said the Downy. "I don't vet t'other eye
this mornin'. I knows what that leads to."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," said Susan, "that the Great
Napoleon didn't drink in the morning."</p>

<p>"If he did," said the Downy, " 'twas afore the
Battle of Vaterloo, vich was the first time his nerves
wanted settlin'."</p>

<p>"I'm longing to know," quoth Tops, "whatever
it is you want that pot of paint for. I should like
to write something on his door myself when he's
locked in."</p>

<p>"And what might that be?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>" 'Gone to Westminster,' my dear," replied her
lover; "which is what the young lawyers in the
Temple do when they're engaged very partickler
indeed&mdash;a muslin consultation, my love, as I once
heard Mr. Stingray call it."</p>

<p>"Go along with you, with your nonsense," said

<!-- vol 3 page 329 -->

Susan, disengaging herself from Mr. Tops's arm,
which he had managed to insinuate round her waist.</p>

<p>Under this rebuff, Tops amused himself, during
the barmaid's temporary absence, by taking off his
livery coat, and kicking it into the air. "This old
huniform," he exclaimed, "were a killing me by
inches. Come drive on, mate, will yer?"</p>

<p>As dictating and writing the letter of the Downy
was a somewhat lengthy operation, which did eventually 
necessitate "wetting the other eye," for the
good of the house, as Tops declared, we will leave
the parties to compose and put it on paper after their
own fashion, the more especially, as our readers
will have the opportunity of knowing its contents in
a future chapter.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE OLD FOX HAS HIS EARTH STOPPED.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"What an incorrect title to a chapter! Don't you know the Fox is
outside when his earth is stopped, and you have placed the lawyer
inside his hole? I should alter that if I were you." "Don't you
see," we replied, "that in the first place this is a Cockney tale, and not
a tale of a Fox in a sporting novel by the inimitable Mr. Jorrocks, or
whoever is the author of 'Mr. Soapy Sponge's Tour.' Besides, we like
the title&mdash;it has a good smack or sound. It is meant to be suggestive,
rather than technically correct. Again, we are not about to hunt our
Fox, but to keep him out of the poultry-yard for a single night.
Finally, we don't choose to alter it."&mdash;<i>Ourselves</i>.</p>

<p>"IT'S very odd," said Mr. Grinderby, as he sat
completing a private letter which he did not intend
his clerks to copy, "whatever can that knocking be
at this hour? Hem!" (writing) " 'Our client&mdash;is
not&mdash;disposed&mdash;to give&mdash;any&mdash;more&mdash;time.' Considering 
'our client' is myself, I don't think there is
any mistake as to the fact. That will do. 'We are&mdash;dear 
sir&mdash;yours faithfully&mdash;Grinderby and Grinderby.'
I wish it was Grinderby and Grinderby, as I meant it
to be for a time, at least till that wretched boy was
called to the Bar; but he chose to be a penny-a-liner
instead. Well, let him rue it, let him rue it," added
the old lawyer, fiercely. "Let me see, 'yours faithfully'&mdash;um, 

<!-- vol 3 page 331 -->

um&mdash;that will do. I can get execution
against him&mdash;say Thursday week. His furniture is
well worth all the debt and expenses, even at the
broker's price. Why should I wait till he can
realise? I should then barely get back my money
and a paltry ten per cent. I have done pretty well,
though. I gave him a fortnight, for twenty-five
pounds down. That was whilst I ascertained the
value of the furniture, and searched 'Stubbs's
Gazette,' that fierce little enemy to the embarrassed
and needy man. A good friend to us lawyers and
industrious money-lenders, though; ha! ha! Confound 
that knocking. What can it mean? I suppose 
the people opposite, Screwcome and Stonehart,
are having a new letter-box or plate put up, or something 
of the kind. It's a great nuisance at this time
of day, almost as bad as a barrel-organ. Knock,
knock, knock! I must copy this letter myself.
'Dear sir!' <i>very</i> dear, ha I ha! 'We regret to state&mdash;that 
your letter arrived&mdash;too late&mdash;as for us&mdash;to
consult our client&mdash;Miss Bogleby&mdash;yesterday&mdash;but
we have&mdash;with considerable dif&mdash;ficulty&mdash;obtained
an&mdash;inter&mdash;view this after&mdash;noon!' A guinea for
that, and two more days lost. I should say he'll
look rather blue, with his wife and eight children,
when he gets this letter. How these poor devils in
difficulties do breed! Multiplication without increase,
I call it! The clerks are all gone away, or I would
send and complain about that knocking. It is really
too much. I am nervous to-day, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he rose, and opened the door leading to the
passage. "Confound it! what does this mean?" he

<!-- vol 3 page 332 -->

cried; "it's at <i>my</i> door. What can they be about?"
(Looks at his watch.) "After four o'clock! Those
people from the Institution will not come now. I
must get home to dinner, and prepare for my interview 
with that infernal Manvers. Stop! I must see
what this noise means!"</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Grinderby attempted to open his
outer-door, which, however, resisted all his efforts.
A sound as of stifled laughter from without reached
him. "What, fastened in!" he cried, as he vainly
turned the key in the inner-door; for both doors
had been secured by the mechanical skill of the
practised Downy. "This is some practical joke;
some villainous trick of a discharged clerk. None
of my fellows dare do it." And he violently shook
the door. "I'll have an action against everybody
for this!" he screamed, foaming at the mouth with
passion, and shaking his fist. "I'll bring a suit
against the Society for negligence, damages five thousand 
pounds. I'll&mdash;&mdash;" Here he ran to the window.
"Hilloh!" he shouted, "murder! thieves! I am
locked in. Bring a ladder! No! that is useless. I
have just had those new iron stanchions put in, and
I can't get my head out to shout; but I'll make them
hear. Hilloh! Help! Fire! I can't see a soul
belonging to the Fields. There's that old white-aproned 
fool Purvis, but he's deaf as a post. I'll get
him discharged next week. He's not fit for his
situation. Let me try the door once more."</p>

<p>As he seized the handle in the hope of pulling it
open by main force, he saw a dirty-looking note on
the floor, and stooping with some difficulty, for he

<!-- vol 3 page 333 -->

trembled all over, and felt giddy with rage and vexation, 
he picked it up and opened it. "What is this
filthy scrawl?" he said. "A woman's writing, too!"
and putting on his glasses, he managed to read as
follows. Our readers will probably at once guess
whence it came. We must observe that Susan had
most carefully endeavoured to follow the Downy's
pronunciation in her spelling.</p>

<p>"VICKED OLD BLOKE,&mdash;You are as fast as tenpenny 
nails can make you. Don't holler too much,
it might hinjure your constitooshun. You're safe to
be loosed out, ven the clerks come in the mornin'.
We've a himportant consultashun with <i>our</i> client,
Mr. J. S. Manvers, just arrived from Amerikey."
(As the Downy remarked at the time, if that don't
put him in a merry key, I knows nothin' about it.)
"It's werry gratifyin' to us to know you've plenty of
sarmons in that 'ere blessed blue-bag of yourn, and
hopes you'll ripent accordin'.</p>

to my head. I am giddy, faint. Help! help!" and
he staggered back, reeled, clutched at a chair, and
fell heavily on the carpet in his own room. The
blood gushed freely from his nose, a circumstance
which probably prevented this being the last scene in
his sordid and useless existence. There let us leave
him for the present, a victim to the artful contrivance
of the Downy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">INSPECTOR LANNER'S LITTLE PLANT.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Ils aller&egrave;nt devisant de milles chouses th&eacute;ologicques, qui s'embrouilloyant 
trez-fort.&mdash;<i>L'Heritier du Diable</i>.</p>

<p>IN a small public-house, the "Cat and Cauliflower," 
at the back of Webb's Fields, there were a
couple of individuals about the time that Mr. Grinderby 
discovered his situation, each of whom appeared
in imminent danger of falling into a fit also, but from
a very dissimilar cause.</p>

<p>"I knocked 'em," said the Downy, for he was one
of the twain, "hinto the holes as wos ready gimbleted, 
as hif they'd bin so many hot knives agoin'
hinto a wegetable-marrer."</p>

<p>"Will they hold?" said Tops, for he was the other
individual in question.</p>

<p>"There's nine-and-twenty nail druv into that door,
vich is British hoak," replied his friend, "and hevery
vun on 'em vill 'ave to be cut round afore a pair o'
pinchers vill bite, that's hall, and Capting Lanner
he's gone round and sent hall the porters hoff hout of
the Fields on distant messages, and told the perlice

<!-- vol 3 page 336 -->

as is on dooty not to hinterfere. I'd give six months'
hincome hout of the Three per Sents to see the hold
feller, ven he's collared his humbreller and blue-bag
for a start home."</p>

<p>"Or when he reads our 'letter of advice,' as
Susan calls it," said Tops, "which she spelt according 
to your particular fancy."</p>

<p>"Hall I hopes is," returned the Downy, "that he
von't take it hout of none of them pore clyints and
clerks of hisn as can't help theirselves; but I fancy
as how we've shut him hup hentirely in the bis'ness
line. I expex he'll re-tire on his fortin, and dewote
his hamiable henergies in futur' to growin' six-and-eightpenny 
dalilahs, or wotever you call 'em, for the
chance of a thirteen-and-fourpenny prize."</p>

<p>So saying they both winked and laughed, and
laughed and winked, until their faces looked for all
the world, as the Downy said, "like a couple of
wet humbrellers folded up hugly;" and Tops betook
himself as a relief and sedative to the perusal of
"Lloyd's Newspaper," which he found on the bar-counter.</p>

<p>"Wotever air you readin' hof?" said the Downy,
presently.</p>

<p>"Why," said Tops, "there's two gory-liars escaped
from Wombwell's menagerie, and a cutting about
the country like a pair of lun&agrave;tic sollycitors bolted
from the awful consequences of their own misdeeds."</p>

<p>"Wot!" cried the Downy, "a pair o' them big apes
as is stuffed in the British Mew-seeum got hout of
a show?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 337 -->

<p>"And hooked it along a turnpike-road near
Derby," added Tops.</p>

<p>"You might jest as vell 'ave kept that dark," said
the Downy. "Wot's the use of frightenin' this
young lady? She'll be thinkin' that it's us as has
got loosed out."</p>

<p>"Well," cried Tops, breaking out into a fresh fit
of laughter, "that's a lively idear that is."</p>

<p>This time their mirth was so infectious, that the
jolly barmaid, a fair buxom person of some thirty
years of age, the wife of a policeman, could not help
joining in.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a cure!" she said to the Downy;
"if I ever see one. Whatever have you two been
up to?" The Downy was attired, we omitted to say,
as a working carpenter. "I should think some one
had left you a small property," continued the barmaid. 
"I say, young man" (to Tops), "you'll do
yourself an injury if you go on like that. Lend
us your light heart, will you, just for a day or two,
and I'll go and spend a happy day at Kosherville
Gardens."</p>

<p>"Oh, lord! oh, lord!" cried Tops. "Whatever is
old Grinderby a-saying of, surely? But it's my
opinion, he's out by this time."</p>

<p>"Not he," quoth the Downy. "There ain't no
vun left hardly hin the Fields, I tell yer. There's a
rare noisy party lives above him, one as carries on
no hend of games; and the porters if they hears anythink 
will put it hall down to him and his friends.
Hall the rest as hangs out on them stairs is bis'ness

<!-- vol 3 page 338 -->

parties, and has gone avay at two, I tells yer, cos of
the holiday."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Tops, "he's sure to be out in an
hour or so."</p>

<p>"I tell yer," answered the Downy, "it couldn't
be done in two, arter he's let 'em know hall about it.
First they got to send for a carpenter, and it's rare
hodds if he comes within 'arf an hour; and if he gits
them nails hout in an hour, I'll eat 'em atween shavins
for sandviches."</p>

<p>"Even then he'll keep his appointment with this
'ere Manvers," said Tops, "and what will be the use
of your caper?"</p>

<p>"He von't," replied the Downy; "he'll be shuck
horful for yun thing. Besides, d'ye think he'd wenture 
hisself there arter our letter? He's a precious
sight too vide avake for any sech a thing."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops, "it's a game anyhow."</p>

<p>"Do tell us what the little game is?" said the
woman at the bar, in her most insinuating tone.</p>

<p>"It's a badger, my dear," said the Downy. "He
wanted to go to the Review this afternoon backerds,
as them hanimals halways do, yer see, and ve vasn't
minded to let him, that's hall."</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you for nothing, Mr. Impudence," 
said the lady, much offended. "I dare say
your friend won't be so uncivil."</p>

<p>"Him?" said the Downy. "Oh! he's the hessence
of perliteness, he is. He's jest had three months for
beatin' his wife for forgetten the ingin sarce, a day
as he had a biled rabbit for dinner. 'Rabbit arout
ingins,' ses he, 'wot's the good of that?' and he

<!-- vol 3 page 339 -->

larrups her accordin'. The beak was agoin' to guv
him six months; but being fond of ingins hisself, he
thought there wos extenyatin' sircumstrences; and
he honly got three in crinsekence. Look how short
is 'air is."</p>

<p>This being delivered with the utmost gravity the
woman looked at Tops, who had just happened to have
his hair cut pretty close, with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"I don't think you're either of you much account,"
she said. "I hope you've been doing nothing wrong,
that's all. I think you may just as well go and
laugh somewhere else. This is a respectable house.
It's pretty near time for my husband to come in,"
she said, looking at the clock.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tops "this is the first time I ever
heard there was any offence in parties enjoying their
own joke."</p>

<p>"It's very rude before a lady, and to tell her such
a parcel of stories about a badger and a boiled rabbit.
It's easy to see what some folks are."</p>

<p>"No offence, miss," said the Downy; "the fact
is we've been and chained up ugly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you haven't," retorted the lady, glad of the
opportunity afforded for a retort, "or you wouldn't
be here."</p>

<p>"You've got it there," cried Tops. "Come, don't
be angry, missus. I'll tell you all about it, the next
time I come."</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing," was the lady's answer.
"Pr'aps it mightn't be safe to know what you could
tell me."</p>

<p>What further compliments might have passed were

<!-- vol 3 page 340 -->

stopped by the entrance of Inspector Lanner and a
stout policeman, who turned out to be the husband
of the fair <i>dame du comptoir</i>. The inspector came
in laughing as heartily as Tops and the Downy themselves.</p>

<p>"It's all serene," he said. "He's as quiet as if
he'd been chloryformed. I passed by the staircase,
and no one was even looking. I say, mind I'm not
answerable for this little game. It's not exactly
business, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, captain!" said the lady. "I should have
thought you were the last man to go torturing a poor
animal like that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, missis?" said Inspector
Lanner.</p>

<p>"Why the badger, to be sure," was the answer.
"I didn't think such cruelties was permitted, leastways 
by the Force you belong to."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see, Mrs. Willum," replied Lanner, "these
two parties have been chaffing you, that's all. Come,
what shall it be, mates? Say the word. I'll allow
you just one drop, before we start for Deptford. A
little Dutch courage, my dear. These 'gents' are
not in the profession, and we've an ugly job in
hand."</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer wot it is," said the Downy; "I ain't
much given to boastin'. I am but a little un, and
there ain't much muscle 'ere; but as for Mr. Tops,
you'd better give him summit to keep him from bilin'
hover, that's my hopinion. He's a longin' to polish
off that genelman from Amerikey&mdash;he is, and no mistake. 
'Ave yer got anythink as is soothin', missus?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 341 -->

<p>"You may find it no joking matter, Mr. What's-his-name&mdash;Downy, 
or whatever you call yourself,"
said the good-natured detective, who was one of the
best of his class. "These Yankees don't stick at a
trifle, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I 'opes they von't stick it into me," responded 
the Downy. "There ain't much of me,
but what there is, is a trifle as I respex. Do yer
think this 'ere pertickler Yankee is likely to carry
a six-bladed knife now, or hany little trifle of that
kind?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," was the answer. "I thought you
wouldn't like it, when it came to the point."</p>

<p>"That pint is jest wot I don't hintend to come to,"
said the Downy. "Hall I 'ave to say is, that if the
hindividual intends to come any of them little games,
I shall do my best to sarcomwent him, that's all. Lor
bless you, I'm used to handle arms."</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied the inspector; "I shouldn't
have thought it now. I didn't know that they carried
any weapons in the Shoe-black Brigade."</p>

<p>"Considerin' the hunconstitooshinal vay in which
the bobbies is drilled, and the huniforms I see among
'em," retorted the Downy, "wich they must 'ave
been bought in at Ashley's when it wos turned hinto
a reglar theayter as didn't pay, vy I owns vith sorrer,
that you licks me in a millingtary pint of view. But
I've got my heye upon yer; I know wot yer up to;
you're a makin' the peelers hinto a harmy, a Force,
as you likes to call it, wich is meant to make a parcel
of slaves of the Hinglish nation, ven hall their liberty
is stole from 'em."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 342 -->

<p>"Very likely," said Mr. Lanner; "can't say. It
don't matter to me, that's all I know."</p>

<p>"I tell yer, it will matter to you some day, cos
afore it cums to the wust, we means to make a fite for
it, and we shall tackle you in a manner as you never
expex."</p>

<p>"What may that be?" said Lanner, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Vy," said the Downy, "we're a svearin' in hall
the cook-maids to stop your cold meat rashuns and
lock the hairey gates, and I should like to know vere
your army'll be then, capting."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Lanner. "I'll owe you one
for that. But you haven't told us yet where you
learnt the use of arms."</p>

<p>"Use of 'em, indeed! Wos harms hever hany
use?" asked the Downy. "D'yer call hanythink
useful, as is honly fit to cut folks' throats, or shoot
'em, like a parcel of wild beasts? <i>Use</i> of harms? I
said nothink about using of 'em. I said I wos used
to handle 'em and the proper vay to handle 'em is to
bury 'em, as the Injins do their tommyhawks. But
if yer must know, I used to run messages for Colt,
him as inwented rewolwers, wich our harmy might
'ave 'ad in the Crime-ere, along vith korfy mills, but
didn't. Blest if it warn't a case of crime '<i>ere</i>, and no
mistake."</p>

<p>"They should have sent you out there, Mr.
Downy," said Lanner. "You'd have shown them
how to manage affairs better, I dare say."</p>

<p>"The most ignorantest poor feller, vith 'ands and
a 'ead, and a 'art in the right place, mind yer, could
ha' done that, and no mistake. D'ye think I don't

<!-- vol 3 page 343 -->

know nothink from hall them pore sick and wounded
sojers as was cast hoff on their return, to get their
livin'?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Lanner, "I dare say it's bad
enough; but what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Vy, not them as has fought their country's
battles oughtn't to be done," returned the Downy;
"not them as has gone through fire, and vater, and
smoke, and steel and lead, or rayther them as lead
and steel has gone through, and which has thought no
more of it than hif it was a dinner. But I tell yer it's
hall rotten haltogether and can't last; and wot's more,
it ain't got no bis'ness to last. We'd better 'ave no
harmy, no, nor navy, neither, than 'ave 'em sarved
out as they air. D'ye think if I wos the Goverment,
I'd let a parsel of pore boys run about the streets like
that, and we wantin' sailors? D'ye think I vouldn't
train 'em and edycate 'em, and be glad of the chance,
for 'arf the money its costs for a lot of spiteful madgistrates 
and good-for-nothin' perlice? I ax yer
pardin', capting, I don't mean no hoffence. I vish
they wos hall like you, as vould let a pore man
live."</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said Lanner, "there's a good
deal of truth in what you say. Only I don't see how
we are to mend it, that's all. Those that can won't,
and those that can't don't get a chance, and so there
it is."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word," said Mrs. Willum, "you
two are having a pretty talk to yourselves. Only
think of my having taken these two friends of yours
to be no better than they should be."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 344 -->

<p>"I haven't said that they are, Mrs. Willum. You
know I have to meet some queer customers in the
way of business," said Inspector Lanner. "I advise
you to look out for your spoons."</p>

<p>"That's a good one, and you in the house," replied 
the lady; "but you always enjoy your joke,
captain."</p>

<p>"Why," said Lanner, "there was one of our chiefs
lost his gold watch and chain t'other evening. The
man who took it pretended to be putting him on to a
prig, and he was so busy watching him, he didn't take
any thought for his own ticker.</p>

<p>"Come," said Tops, who had been out to meet
Susan in a pastrycook's shop round the corner, to tell
her how matters were going on "<i>in re</i> an attorney,"
"if you've done talking, I think we'd better be on
the move."</p>

<p>"It's quite time," said Lanner. "Here, Mrs.
Willum, tell your husband that we're going. I mean
to have him and a couple more outside, in case of
a bolt or a rescue."</p>

<p>"As you please," observed Tops. "You know
best, I'm agreeable to anything; I should have thought
that we three were more than a match for one Yankee
anyhow."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's only one we shall have to
deal with?" asked Lanner. "I dare say he's got his
pals. Perhaps a lot of foreign sailors, for all we
can say. It's a rum sort of place, I can tell you.
But whatever there is, I hope there'll be no women
concerned in it. They're the desperatest devils, a

<!-- vol 3 page 345 -->

precious sight worse than men to tackle. What do
you think, Mr. Downy?"</p>

<p>"I've knowed one, as it took eight of your harmy
and a stretcher to lock up," answered the Downy.
"She might a stuffed a child's pillow with the whiskers 
of the Force, as she pulled hout. And sarved
'em right too; for they'd no bis'ness to meddle with
her. She wos earnin' an honest livin', vich wos more
nor they wos a-doin', ven they took and banged and
pulled her about, as they did shameful."</p>

<p>"I dare say, if the truth was to be told, that you
were locked up along with her," said Lanner.</p>

<p>"I wos, and I'm proud of it," replied the Downy;
"and I'd do it agen to-morrer, if I see another sech a
case, vich I hopes I never shall."</p>

<p>"He speaks his mind out, don't he?" said Lanner.</p>

<p>"I dessay," replied the Downy, "that I shan't
'ave a hopportunity to do it much longer. I never
could bring myself to call a constable 'sir,' as hif he
wos a horficer, as they calls themselves. Vy, they'll
lock a man hup soon for not touchin' his hat to 'em
as he passes. That's wot it's comin' to."</p>

<p>"I tell you what," quoth Tops, "you two'll never
a-done talking to-night."</p>

<p>"Don't you be so fast," answered the incorrigible
Downy. "Jest becos you've left hoff sweet-heartin'
for a few hours, you thinks you're heverybody. He's
in sech a precious hurry to git back. Tell us wot
time yer've got to meet her to-night, and then we can
hact accordin'. I vunder she let him cum at all, that
I do. I say, capting, mind yer don't take to courtin'.

<!-- vol 3 page 346 -->

It won't suit your bis'ness. I mean none of this 'ere
earnest kind of spoonin'. Now, then, 'ere goes for
the spree. I don't know as hever I was out on this
sort of lay afore."</p>

<p>"You mayn't find it altogether so much of a spree
as you reckon," said Lanner. "Remember it's murder 
I'm going to take him for, and not merely this
will job of yours. It's a case of life and death; and
I say once more to both of you, if you take my advice, 
you'll keep out of it, and leave it to those whose
trade it is to deal with an ugly customer like this
Manvers. Only say the word, mates. There's no
disgrace in drawing back."</p>

<p>"There's no drawing back about me, I hope,"
said Tops.</p>

<p>"We're jest the sort to dror back, we air," quoth
the Downy. "But I'll tell yer wot it is. If yer
wait here much longer, there'll be a depytashun
from the hinsurance hoffices, a-beggin' of me not to
expose my walyable life too rashly."</p>

<p>"You're a rum card," said Lanner, approvingly.</p>

<p>"I say, guvernor," said the Downy, as they got
into the street, after the party had duly taken leave
of Mrs. Willum, who begged Mr. Lanner to take
care of himself, "as there were very few of his sort
about," &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;" I say, guvernor, I can't go arter
hall."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Mr. Downy, and why not, pray?"</p>

<p>"Think of my unborn children, and the goose-club
I've bin a subscribin' to. Besides, ain't I in a raffle
for a 'armonium and a pair o' plated mustard-spoons?
Ain't the ties o' property too strong? Besides vich, I

<!-- vol 3 page 347 -->

got to take the cheer at the Hunited Vitechapel
Watermen's Vidowers' Hassociation to-morrow
hevenin.' Tripe and ingins for them as likes 'em at
nine. That's a morial hobligation."</p>

<p>"Come," said the inspector, "that's a good one,
that is. You're not a widower, Mr. Downy."</p>

<p>"Don't you see, they allers has a single man in the
cheer to control the vatervorks."</p>

<p>Thus pleasantly chatting, the party proceeded to an
apartment provided by Mr. Lanner, where Tops assumed 
the Downy's disguise as a carpenter, and the
latter arrayed himself as a negro minstrel in the
most wonderful garments, together with a paper shirt-collar 
of portentous dimensions. They then took
the train for Deptford. Tops was by far the most
silent of the party. The fact is, he was bent on
vengeance; and thinking, though with far different
feelings, both of his present mistress, Susan, and his
former master, the luckless Arthur Aubrey.</p>

<p>DEPTFORD is not a pleasant suburb of London.
It is not genteel, like Brixton or Peckham, nor vulgarly 
gay, like Islington, nor respectable in a small
way, like Camden Town, nor busy but well-to-do,
like Camberwell. It is crowded, poverty-stricken,
dingy, disreputable, and unwholesome. In bad times,
when labour is plentiful and employment slack, food

<!-- vol 3 page 349 -->

dear, and wages low, it is gloomy as well as squalid.
Nothing seems good in Deptford. The bread looks
half-baked and dirty, the meat black and uninviting,
the very fruits undersized, and either rotten or green,
the bacon rancid, and even the herrings not what
herrings should be. Bad smells abound; but the
population, such as it is, multiplies, though it cannot
be said to thrive. With the exception of the dockyard 
labourers, who are strong, hulking fellows
enough, the inhabitants are pale, stunted, and degenerate-looking. 
It is a very dispiriting place. Even
the muslin curtains of the milliners' shops are yellow
and dirty, and there is a tendency to grow musk
plants and other humble specimens of Flora within
the small, and, we should imagine, unhealthy rooms.
A pretty, well-dressed girl in Deptford is a kind of
vision, which is probably very rarely seen. We should
feel inclined to wish her well out of the High-street,
or any of its narrow tributary confluents, if we saw
her there. We are the last to sneer at mere poverty,
wretchedness, and consequent degradation. The
"unclean living no less perilous than desperation,"
to be found in so many outlying parts of our great
metropolis, and even in the heart of the West-end
itself, witness Bedfordbury near the Haymarket, is
to be attributed to causes beyond the power of the
sufferers to avert. We have no supercilious enmity
towards Deptford. We have felt sorry to find ourselves 
there, and proportionately glad to escape from
it, when our business has been ended. We like to
see our fellow-creatures happy, smiling, healthy, and
prosperous. Is it the present tendency of the administration 

<!-- vol 3 page 350 -->

of this great and wealthy country, in the
present era of enlightenment, to make them so?
There is a railway station at Deptford. It is suitable
in appearance to the place. It is narrow, crowded,
dirty, and depressing, except so far as it holds out a
prospect of speedy departure. But then truly one
arrives by the same means. The greasy spiral stairs
by which the passengers ascend and descend are so
dangerous that more than one accident resulting in
death has occurred in consequence. But what of
that? We do not apprehend that the parties sacrificed 
had a large status in the world; and possibly
they were intoxicated, or in too great a hurry to return
to Deptford. Peter the Great once lodged in Deptford. 
It is a pity that he ever left it. He was
better employed in carving figure-heads and laying
down keels, than in cutting off his subjects' heads and
playing the executioner himself. There is a street
named after the "gentle" Evelyn, who saw that fierce
and sanguinary reaction which threatened the liberties
of England, when Russell and Algernon Sidney died.
London "gents" go down to the Rye House now-a-days 
ignorant of all that dark story of fanatical
treachery and hate. The house of fine old Admiral
Benbow still stands. We trust that his breed is not
yet quite extinct in England. We have said that
there is a railway station in Deptford. Railways are
the boast of civilisation. Do they bring comfort to
our doors? Not necessarily, at least judging by such
a place as Deptford. We want something besides
railways for happiness; something beyond electric
telegraphs for truth.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 351 -->

<p>After all, Deptford is not so very unhealthy, according 
to the bills of mortality, except in times of
cholera, typhus, &amp;c., which diseases have generally a
frequent and fruitful innings in that locality. The
suburb is built on quicksand, as well as mud, the
latter being chiefly near the river bank. If the High-street 
of Deptford be unenticing in appearance, what
shall we say of such localities as the Stowage, the
Rope-walk, Mill-lane, and the "Green?" Does the
reader suppose that there is any green there, enough
to gladden the existence of a solitary duck? Doubtless, 
there was a "green" there about the period,
when a woodcock might have been flushed where
Regent-street now stands, and there was excellent
snipe-shooting at Knightsbridge; but not for the
double-barrels of the modern sportsman. Down the
Rope-walk runs a central gutter, after the foreign
fashion, choked with the foulest garbage, and with
salads not only exactly "&agrave; la mayonnaise."</p>

<p>Mill-lane is chiefly noted for providing accommodation 
in the shape of lodging-houses for the lowest
order of beggars and tramps. Near this, and in a
part known as New Town, stood the public-house in
which Manvers had located himself, and in which he
expected Grinderby to call that evening. The house
in question was by no means of the flaring gin-palace
type so common in low neighbourhoods in the present
day. It had not even any tawdry and paltry pretensions 
as a Temple of Bacchus. There were no brilliant 
chandeliers. The gas-lights did not burn amid
glass vine-leaves and bunches of grapes. There were
no mirrors, there was no gilding, no ornament. It

<!-- vol 3 page 352 -->

was, in fact, a wretched-looking den, which no respectable 
person would have liked to enter, even in broad
daylight. The house was not lofty; but at the back
its elevation was much greater, owing to a fall in the
ground. It was only two stories high, but it had the
height of two stories more behind. The lane at the
back was very narrow, being not more than some fourteen 
feet across; in fact, it was only a foot thoroughfare. 
The houses which ran parallel behind were only
one story high. For some reason there was a sort of
communication between the lower part of a window
of the second story of the public-house and the top
of one of these houses. It consisted of a sort of little
slanting bridge of planks with a single iron rail on
each side. It was suggestive of an escape; and probably 
had been designed, if not used, for that purpose.
At the time of our narrative, the lower end, having got
partly detached, in fact being entirely so at one corner,
a couple of lazy workmen had been employed the day
before to repair it. For some reason or other, they
had not completed their task. Probably they were
awaiting some necessary materials. At all events
they had spent the greater part of the day in drinking 
at the bar, and in discussing their job. They
had, however, completely detached the little bridge,
and left it hanging suspended from the higher, that
is, the public-house side.</p>

<p>The landlord of this foul ken, where the lowest
votaries of Bacchus were accustomed nightly to
meet, drink, argue, quarrel, and frequently fight,
was grey and partly bald, stout, pale, and ill-looking.
After all, what is physiognomy without circumstance?

<!-- vol 3 page 353 -->

He looked like what he was. Had his dirty white
apron been a black one, had his coat been better,
and his stout legs encased in silk instead of woollen
stockings, had he been worth four thousand or fourteen 
thousand pounds a-year, instead of some four
hundred pounds capital <i>pour tout potage</i>, he might
have been a bishop. But instead of a Pharisee, he
was a publican, in the modern sense, of the lowest
type; a reproach and a disgrace to the worthy,
manly, and thoroughly English body of men called
Licensed Victuallers; for there are black sheep in
that calling, as well as in every other; a fact which
sour Sabbatarians and violent canting Teetotallers,
who would deny God's gifts, in the shape of wholesome 
and sustaining liquors to their fellow-creatures,
do not fail to make the most of. He had a large head,
but Greek particles had never troubled his brain.
He was a good father, and not a bad husband, but
he would turn out a poor wretch who would not pay
for more fiery gin, or filthy beer, into the street to
die in the kennel, or to be locked up in the police
station without the slightest compunction. Had he
not done so, where would his living have been?
In poor neighbourhoods, even a doctor must be hard-hearted 
to live, much more to support those dependent 
on his exertions. Mr. Gruffem was not a bad
man at heart&mdash;he only did as he was obliged to do in
that neighbourhood, resembling, as it did, the lowest
parts of Liverpool, where a free-trade Bench of magistrates 
with Sabbatarian views grant licenses
wholesale, in order to bring the legitimate liquor-trade 
into disrepute.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 354 -->

<p>Mr. Gruffem was the victim of competition and
slender means. If a robbery were concocted in Mr.
Gruffem's parlour, he was deaf, save to orders for
liquor, and these he expected of course. He was extremely 
amenable to the blandishments, or terrors of
that army of occupation billeted on the lower orders&mdash;to 
wit the army of the late Sir Robert Peel. He would
come round the corner with a bottle and a couple of
glasses any time at night&mdash;even after eleven on
Sunday night, when wanted. He would show the
sergeants of the Force into his house at any hour
with great affability and politeness. In fact, after
his way, he tried to make things pleasant. His rum
was considered the strongest, and consequently the
best, to be had in that neighbourhood. On the very
evening when Manvers had made his appointment
with Mr. Grinderby, Gruffem had shown considerable
annoyance at the bridge being left in the dangerous
state we have mentioned. It certainly looked as if
it were not unlikely to become detached altogether,
and fall into the lane below, where crowds of children 
were at play. He accordingly abused the two
Irish workmen who had left it in so unsatisfactory
a state, after his fashion, and in no very measured
terms.</p>

<p>"What did you begin the job for at all?" he said.
"You knowed you hadn't got the new supports
ready."</p>

<p>"It's all right, master!" said one. "Faith, it would
bear your weight at the end of it anyhow."</p>

<p>"I don't care," replied Gruffem; "you knowed

<!-- vol 3 page 355 -->

well enough you couldn't finish it. I expect I shall
get a summons for leaving it in that state. And
suppose it was to fall on any one's head?"</p>

<p>"You'd be had up for manslaughter, governor,"
said a pale thin man, who had once been a lawyer's
clerk, and who made his living by writing women's
letters, and giving legal advice to sailors.</p>

<p>"I suppose I should," said Gruffem; "and all on
account of them two lazy beggars."</p>

<p>"Let's have another 'arf-pint, master," said one of
them, at that moment.</p>

<p>"You haven't paid for the last," returned Gruffem.
"This ain't a credit house."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll pay it to-morrow, when I've finished
the job," replied the other.</p>

<p>This was an indiscreet speech.</p>

<p>"Come, clear out!" replied Gruffem. "None of
your nonsense here. It won't do, I tell you, I won't
stand it;" and he pushed the intruder towards the
door, or rather doors, for there were two doors, both
with small windows, guarded, the outer one with
iron bars, and the inner with brass wires. There
were also two steep narrow steps into the street. The
Irishman made some show of resistance, coupled with
language which was anything but parliamentary.
"Here, Jem," cried the landlord, much as he would
have done to a dog. A short young man with close-cropped 
hair, and with his shirt-sleeves tucked up,
leaped over the counter. Without waiting for further
orders, he made a single feint at the nearest Irishman, 
and then planted a tremendous blow between

<!-- vol 3 page 356 -->

his eyes. The latter staggered back, when the other
butted at him and sent him down the steps into the
street. His mate with but slight variation was subjected 
to similar treatment. Some women screamed
and yelled, and a crowd of Irish gathered round the
door threatening vengeance, but Mr. Gruffem took
things very coolly. He pitched out the coat of one
of the men, which the fellow had carried loosely
thrown over his shoulder and dropped in the struggle.
There was, in fact, a row, such as occurs periodically
in such places as we have attempted to describe.
They are like sudden disturbances, "shindies," to
use an Irish term, in a monkey-cage. No, it is
worse than that. There is all the fantastic passion
of the ape, but there is also the ferocity of the
tiger, the hyena, and the carcajou. It is a tumult
or carnivora, ape-wise, or ape-fashion. There are
screams and yells, howling and struggling, such as an
unfortunate traveller, lost in an African forest, may
perchance hear. Shut your windows, ye dwellers
in a Christian city, if there is such a den near you,
in the hot summer nights. Better a stifling atmosphere 
of quiet, than the shrieks and oaths of that
midnight crew. There is a storm in the wild-beast
cage. Listen! The keepers are at hand&mdash;the police
appear on the scene, and the noise and oaths are redoubled 
for awhile. Now it is in the street. The
victims are being carried off; then comes the street
discussion. You hear the pros and cons of metropolitan 
Thyrsis and Amaryllis, of urban, but not urbane,
Melib&oelig;us and Corydon, not in the shade, but the

<!-- vol 3 page 357 -->

lamp-light. At length quiet supervenes, only broken
by a distant shriek or yell. You hear the noise of
closing the shutters. Then comes the tramp of three
or four heavy pairs of regulation boots. The police
have returned to talk it over with the landlord.
There is a mutter of bass voices, the clink of a furtive 
can, the chink of the necessary fee, and the
nuisance is ended for the night.</p>

<p>Such disturbances were too frequent in the neighbourhood 
of New Town to create much excitement.
The Irish labourers and their sympathisers had their
talk out, and withdrew at least some distance up the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. Gruffem's pot-boy was greatly feared by these
savage men. He was an ex-pugilist, whose temper
had been too bad for the Ring. Such men are employed 
at some of our popular places of entertainment, 
as we have already recorded, occasionally in
the cause of "order," to break the British citizen's
head and rob him with impunity. This fellow's post
at Gruffem's was no sinecure in the way of fighting
and settling quarrels in a summary way. If two
customers had a difference which threatened to culminate 
in a fight, Jem Nobbler, alias the "Catsmeat-man," 
a pocket Hercules of ten stone weight or
thereabouts, would thrust himself between the intended 
combatants, and say, "Drop it!" or "None
of that here; fight outside as much as you like." If
his mandate was not attended to, he seldom gave
another warning. He would at once select the least
valuable customer to the house, and tackle him in the

<!-- vol 3 page 358 -->

most approved style. The bigger his antagonist, the
greater generally his triumph. The only man who
had successfully resisted his authority was Manvers,
on the night of his arrival. He had shown a disposition 
to quarrel with every one, and so abused
Gruffem for pouring out a measure of brandy for
him, instead of handing him the bottle in the American 
fashion, that Jem thought it necessary to interfere. 
Accordingly, he was making his accustomed
spring over the counter, when Manvers closed with
him, and after nearly throttling him, flung him with
such tremendous violence to the ground, that Jem
was stunned, and unable to show up for at least a
week after. As soon as he recovered, he followed
Manvers out one afternoon in order to have his revenge, 
and challenged him to "fight him like a man."
The reply was a contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"Look hyar, strainger, jest mind your own business, 
will you? I don't 'fight like a man;' and I'm
not agoin' to be made a fool of by any of them old
country rules of yourn. If I fight, I fight; and by
thunder! if you don't leave off them antics, I'll draw
the bead on you."</p>

<p>So saying, he pulled out a revolver, and presented
it at Jem's head. This was more than that individual 
bargained for. The English rough is greatly
afraid of arms. Volunteering has now done something 
towards familiarising the masses with guns and
swords. A short time ago, nine-tenths of the British
male adult population knew no more about the use of
a gun or pistol than so many old women, and would

<!-- vol 3 page 359 -->

have handled one as timidly and as clumsily. Putting
aside our sailors and soldiers&mdash;none too numerous
by the way&mdash;and a few undisciplined gamekeepers,
poachers, sportsmen, and sparrow-shots, there never
was a nation so utterly helpless as this one, less than
ten years ago from the time we write. The fact is
ludicrous but true. England had no line of secondary
defence whatever. Like others of his class, Jem
Nobbler had a wholesome dread of implements which
he did not understand. So he growled, parleyed,
shook hands, and liquored up, and Manvers became
king. Old Gruffem was by no means pleased at this
turn of affairs; but he couldn't help it. Besides,
Manvers was a good customer&mdash;at least ran up a long
bill, living as he did on the premises.</p>

<p>"Licked by a Yankee?" said Gruffem to Jem;
"well, I'd never 'a thought it. You ought to have
your wages cut down one half, that's what you
ought."</p>

<p>"He's no more a Yankee, nor I am," Jem would
growl in reply to such remarks as the above, which
were not unfrequent. "He may have bin over the
herring pond. I don't say he haven't, mind, but he
never learnt what he knows over there. No, no! he's
six stone heavier nor me, and an Englishman. Besides, 
I offered to fight him fair, so as to give a little un
a chance. But as for saying he's a Yankee, that cock
won't fight for me."</p>

<p>Mr. Manvers occupied a back bedroom attic at the
"One-Eyed Marine." On this evening he had told
Gruffem that he expected a friend, and was to be

<!-- vol 3 page 360 -->

called down if he came. The Irish row had just died
away, when Inspector Lanner, attired somewhat in
the style of a swell young captain of a Citizen steam-boat, 
made his appearance at Gruffem's bar. The
moment was auspicious; for every one was too busy
talking over the late disturbance to take much notice
of a stranger. But we must reserve the evening for
the ensuing chapter.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">SIGNOR MANVERINI'S LEAP FOR LIFE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">After which, at half-past eight, terrific ascent on the tight rope of
Madame Gen&eacute;ve, as the Fire King's Bride. At nine precisely, Signor
Smithini's leap for life over an omnibus, through a circle of revolving
daggers on to the green. Grand Finale. The Siege of Delhi by the
Muddlecombe Volunteers. Tremendous explosion of a petard. Tea
and shrimps, ninepence. Hot water for parties supplying their own tea
and sugar twopence each, children half-price. No charge for babies in
arms. Kiss in the ring, tiddle-cum-torters, swings, wheels of fortune,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Aunt Sally, as patronised by the nobility. Dancing at half-past 
nine in the Painted Pavilion of Past Grand Masters of the O. K.
Lodge. The liquors and refreshments of the first quality.&mdash;<i>Summer
Programme for Snargate Excursionists</i>, A.D. 1867.</p>

<p>THE afternoon had been singularly sultry, and the
sky was dull and lowering. The air was full of electricity, 
and the nervous portion of the community
felt that weight and oppression which precedes a
tempest in an unusual degree. Still up to the hour
of the rendezvous at the "One-Eyed Marine,"
the distant muttering of the storm was unheard
in the roar and din and confused murmur of traffic,
and the thunder of the omnibuses and sharp rattle of
the cabs, and the shouting of their cads and drivers

<!-- vol 3 page 362 -->

was the chief and usual sound heard, save in the
vicinity of a railway bridge or station, throughout
the East-end of commercial London. The portion
of the bar of the above-mentioned hostelry intended
for the public accommodation was divided into three
compartments, communicating with each other by
small side-doors in the partitions, of which the middle
compartment was by far the largest. The arrangement 
was not unlike that of a pawnbroker's shop, on
a somewhat larger scale. In the central and largest
compartment Jem Nobbler and some dozen men and
women were holding forth on the rights and wrongs
of the ejectment which had just taken place. Mr.
Gruffem was busy at his tap. So Lanner popped
through one of the side-doors into the left side-box,
or "Bottle and Jug" department, and addressed Mr.
Gruffem as follows:</p>

<p>"A pint of ale, governor, if you please."</p>

<p>"You'd better go in there," said Gruffem, motioning 
him to the central part. "This here is
private."</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> it now?" said Lanner. "Then we'll keep it
so, if you please. Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"No; nor don't want to. I ain't in no humour
for chaff just now."</p>

<p>"But you'll come to corn," said Lanner. "Here!"
and he handed him a card, whereon was printed
"Inspector Lanner," and in smaller letters, the division 
to which he, the said inspector, belonged, and
where he might be heard of.</p>

<p>The landlord looked at the card and at him, and
apparently from what he saw of him was inclined to

<!-- vol 3 page 363 -->

admit that he might be the person whom the card
described.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "who's wanted?"</p>

<p>"I'm come to arrest a party in your house," replied 
Lanner.</p>

<p>"For what?" inquired the other.</p>

<p>"Felony, of course," said Lanner, in a cold, hard,
almost indifferent tone, but emphatic enough in its
way. "Will you be on the square or not?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gruffem at once knew the individual for
whom Lanner had come. He was in his room above,
and the remembrance of the broken escape flashed
at once through his mind. But he had not by any
means decided how to act. He hated Manvers, who
bullied, and, in vulgar parlance, sat upon him too
much. The next few words of Lanner decided him.</p>

<p>"I want to do it on the quiet," said that worthy.
"I always prefer the quiet. But I've plenty of force
outside, if wanted. Besides officers, I've two 'pals'
who are interested in the recovery of some papers,
and who will be here in a minute or two. Now what
you've got to do is to contrive an interview with this
Tadgers, or whatever he calls himself, as if we were
friends of yours. He don't know me, though he has
seen them before. Their own mothers wouldn't know
them just now;" and Lanner slightly laughed, "since
I have been their valet. You see, Mr. Gruffem, you'd
best oblige me, if you want to keep this respectable
house of yours open. I wish to do this job neatly,
and if you behave on the square, it will be the best
for you. I never forget a friend, nor yet one who
goes contrary to my wishes."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 364 -->

<p>"You know what sort of a party he is?" asked the
landlord, with a jerk of his thumb in an upward
direction.</p>

<p>Lanner nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Carries we'pons," continued Gruffem.</p>

<p>Another nod from Lanner.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you wish, short of lending a
hand," said Gruffem, deprecatingly; "I couldn't do
that in my own house, unless I was paid very handsome 
indeed."</p>

<p>"The sentiment does you credit, Mr. What's-your-name&mdash;Gruffem&mdash;isn't 
it?" returned Lanner.
"I don't wish you to interfere any more than to put
us in the way of meeting him in a sort of friendly
way. He expects a party here at eight, don't he?"</p>

<p>"He do," said Gruffem.</p>

<p>"That party was to receive some papers from
him; but I don't expect he'll come. I want to collar
them instead, that's all. If we made a row, even
if we were to surround the house, he might destroy
them, or conceal them."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Gruffem, "that you couldn't
accommodate the matter for the papers and something 
handsome besides?"</p>

<p>"Not to be done," said Lanner, "at any price
whatsoever."</p>

<p>"I see," quoth the accommodating Gruffem. "It's
now half-past seven. Step into my parlour, sir, and
I'll ask your friends in when they come."</p>

<p>So saying, he lifted a flap on hinges which was cut
in the counter, and the inspector passed into the
sanctum. The bar-parlour was a tolerably large

<!-- vol 3 page 365 -->

room, with a door leading to the staircase of the
house, and another to a small court, surrounded by a
high wall.</p>

<p>"By your leave," he said.</p>

<p>He then sat down. In a minute or two the landlord 
ushered in the Downy and Tops.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mate," said Tops. "It looks uncommon 
like tempest."</p>

<p>"Ve're in luck to git into sich a werry comfortable 
place as this," said the Downy, looking round
him; "for if them blessed hillumynations ain't put
out afore long, I never see the courage drownded out
of a Chartist meetin'."</p>

<p>"Bring brandy-and-water and pipes for three,"
said Lanner.</p>

<p>Gruffem very shortly executed the order.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" he said.</p>

<p>"Fetch that party down-stairs. Say there's three
of your own particular friends here. Call me
Wright; him Bones," (indicating the Downy); "and
this gentleman" (namely, Tops), "Harry. When
we've got him in talk, you" (to Gruffem) "go out,
and as soon as you see one of my people in uniform
enter the house, let him stand just inside the bar,
and you come in here again. To prevent mistakes,
I shall ask you the time. You answer, 'The right
time,' and I shall then effect the capture. Don't let
your pot-boy, or any one, interfere, and tell any
females, if there are any in the house, to keep in
their own rooms, and lock their doors for fear of
accident."</p>

<p>Mr. Gruffem disappeared.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 366 -->

<p>"Don't forget the rewolver," whispered the
Downy; "it will be hall right, hif I can only get the
'andling of it for 'arf a minnit."</p>

<p>The trio sat very quiet in that dingy apartment.
Presently the pot-boy came in, and laid a tray and
cloth on the table, and placed thereon a cruet-stand
and a loaf. This was a dodge of Gruffem's to "look
natyral," as he said. It might have been noticed by
a very minute observer that there was no knife or
fork placed on that table.</p>

<p>The old Dutch clock ticked, ticked, and an accomplished 
grey parrot clawed her cage, and two or three
times broke the silence by an emphatic interrogatory
prefaced with an oath "&mdash;&mdash; you, who are you? &mdash;&mdash;
you, who are you?"</p>

<p>We shall not give the interesting maledictory variations 
of the inquiring bird. Tops got up and looked
at a print of the famous dog Billy, and then at a
stuffed toy terrier pup, a representation of the celebrated 
fight between Broom and Hannan for five
hundred pounds a side at Bicester, near Oxford, a
stuffed bittern, ditto kingfisher, ditto squirrel, and
other curiosities of the kind. There was a piece
of sampler work done by Mrs. Gruffem's grandmother, 
introducing the Ten Commandments and
the Lord's Prayer. There were also pictures of Mr.
Gruffem's father and mother, the latter with her
waist up to her armpits, and a turban on her head,
which might have been the portraits of a celebrated
actor and actress in the parts of Mr. and Mrs.
Peachum in the "Beggars' Opera," but were not.
The Downy turned his attention to the gas, which he

<!-- vol 3 page 367 -->

was about to meddle with to improve the light, when
Lanner emphatically motioned him to abstain. At
last, loud voices and heavy steps were heard above,
and Mr. Manvers, <i>alias</i> Tadgers, together with Mr.
Gruffem, descended into the room.</p>

<p>"I'll bet any one three to two, you don't make all
the five pins twice running," said Lanner to the
Downy, just as the door opened.</p>

<p>" 'Arf-crowns or bobs?" inquired the Downy.</p>

<p>"Half-crowns or crowns if you like," said Lanner.</p>

<p>"Done with you in half-crowns, mate," cried
Tops.</p>

<p>"You ain't got never a skittle-ground here, master,
'ave yer?" asked the Downy of Mr. Gruffem.</p>

<p>"No," said that individual, "there ain't room for
it. But if you want a little sport, there's as good a
bagatelle-board as any in England, and I don't care
where t'other comes from," and he pointed to that
article which stood in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Here's a gent here, I dessay, will jine in a game
of four," continued Gruffem, indicating Manvers,
who had entered, and had cast a scowling and uneasy
glance at the strangers.</p>

<p>"I ain't such a darned idiot," was the amiable
response. "It's about the tarnationest little-est, rottenest 
fool of a game out."</p>

<p>"You may make as big a game of it as you like,
captin," said Mr. Gruffem. "You can bet on it, I
suppose, and what more do you want?"</p>

<p>"Something that a man can play at, old 'oss,"
answered Manvers, "and not feel like a gal jest let
loose from a Sunday school. I tell yer it's a dirty

<!-- vol 3 page 368 -->

little cuss of a game. It ain't hardly fit to amuse
niggers, or the loafing scallywags and parsons that
take their part."</p>

<p>"What's dat yer say?" inquired the Downy.</p>

<p>"You air reckoned a smart fellow, I guess," said
Manvers, "in this humbugging little island of yourn;
but ef you war to show yourself in that cos-tume in
our free republic, you'd be tarred and feathered, I
guess, in no time."</p>

<p>"Or shot, pr'aps, vith vun of them repeatin'
pistols, as I've heerd on, with six barrils, and more,"
said the Downy.</p>

<p>"Six barrels!" said Manvers; "you air a cute
coon; six chambered, you mean, rotating cylindrical
breech&mdash;Colt agin the world, sirree!"</p>

<p>"I never heerd of the gent," said the Downy.
"Hany relashun to the old boss theer, as you called
the respectable genelman as has jest left the
room?"</p>

<p>"I guess not," replied Manvers. "You couldn't
raise such an everlastin' slockdologer as our Colonel
Colt, not with double all the machinery you've got
in this fossil island."</p>

<p>"Come, that's a good un," said the Downy.</p>

<p>"It's good enough to have raised your country anyhow," 
said Mr. Lanner. "Come, what are you going
to drink?"</p>

<p>"Waal," said Manvers, "I'm no ways particular;
I'll take a smile of brandy and a drop of your Thames
water. Look you, I went nigh putting six inches
of my knife into one of your cusses of helps, the first

<!-- vol 3 page 369 -->

time I liquored up in the old country. Pah! to
think of measuring out what a gentleman is to drink,
as if he didn't know what he was able to swallow."</p>

<p>"I don't mind standing a bottle," said Lanner.
"We're on to a good thing" (whispering) "to-night,
and no mistake. Will you stand in?"</p>

<p>Manvers shook his head. "I expect a friend on
business of my own, every moment," he answered.</p>

<p>"So you've never been in England afore?" said
Tops, ringing the bell in obedience to a sign from
Lanner.</p>

<p>"Never!" answered the pretended Yankee; "and
to tell you the truth, strainger, I don't care how soon
I leave, either, as the bar said to the hollow tree,
when it was struck by lightning."</p>

<p>"What's your pleasure, gents?" said Mr. Gruffem,
entering.</p>

<p>"Three brandies and a gin, cold," said Lanner.
"Is my chop done yet?"</p>

<p>"I'll see," was the answer.</p>

<p>"I should like to see vun of them rewolvers,"
quoth the Downy, "that I should, unkimmon."</p>

<p>"What do you say to this then?" asked Manvers,
taking a Colt from his breast-pocket. "Mind, it's
loaded."</p>

<p>The Downy took it with such a comical air of
alarm, lest it should go off, that even Manvers couldn't
refrain from laughing. In taking it, however, he
contrived that the only person in apparent danger of
being accidentally shot should be Manvers himself,
who jumped up with an oath.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 370 -->

<p>"Mind what the &mdash;&mdash; you're at!" he shouted this
time, with no Yankee drawl or expression.</p>

<p>Lanner and Tops exchanged a rapid look, as he
spoke in this manner. The former hardly needed
any verification of the information he had received;
but if he had done so, this helped to supply it. The
Downy got Manvers to take the pistol to pieces and
readjust it. The liquor was brought in and drunk,
and the order repeated by Manvers.</p>

<p>"May I look at it agen?" asked the Downy,
taking up the revolver from the table.</p>

<p>Manvers nodded carelessly. "Ef you want to try
a shot, strainger, jest oblige me by shooting the boss,"
he said, "the widow can charge the funeral expenses
in my bill. That's how we should do it in Californy."</p>

<p>No one laughed more heartily at this idea than
the Downy. Indeed, he got up to laugh more freely,
and reseated himself pistol in hand, so as to cover
himself in great measure from Manvers's observation 
by placing Tops and Lanner&mdash;the latter sitting
in the landlord's old-fashioned high-backed arm-chair,
which had served the Presidents of an Odd Fellow's
lodge for some fifty years&mdash;between himself and the
pseudo-American.</p>

<p>The moment he had effected this, he became exceedingly 
busy; joining, however, from time to time
in the ensuing conversation.</p>

<p>"Whar do you hail from, strainger?" said Manvers
to Lanner.</p>

<p>"I belong to the river steam-boats," was the reply;
"but I'm out of a berth just now, and come here to

<!-- vol 3 page 371 -->

find a pal or two to do a little business." And
Lanner winked at Manvers, as much as to say, "you
know, old fellow?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand," rejoined Manvers. "And
what's your business, mister?" addressing Tops.</p>

<p>"Hodd jobs," replied that gentleman; "respectable 
mechanic by trade."</p>

<p>"Anything on to-night?" inquired Manvers.</p>

<p>"Capital plant; glad if you'll go shares."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Downy, "go in for glory. We're
goin' to do a little job at Peckham."</p>

<p>"Peckham!" cried Manvers; "Peckham? why
that's where&mdash;&mdash;" and he checked himself. "I wonder 
whether that dried old alligator means to show
up to-night?" he muttered. "It's time," and he
looked at the old-fashioned clock.</p>

<p>Lanner frowned at the Downy. He had made a
mistake in speaking of Peckham.</p>

<p>"Will yer jine in?" said the Downy.</p>

<p>"What for?" replied Manvers. "A few silver
spoons, a ticker, a teapot, and a fogle? No! no!
that's not my line of business."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lanner, who had strolled into the
bar and back, after glancing at the clock, "I don't
care for politics. Let's have a song."</p>

<p>The fact is he was afraid of something being said,
which might give Manvers the alarm, before the
constables, who were to be posted outside, should
arrive.</p>

<p>"Come," he said to Manvers, "give us a Yankee
touch&mdash;one of them nigger melodies if you like."</p>

<p>"Cuss me, ef I make such a darned idiot of myself,"

<!-- vol 3 page 372 -->

was the reply. "You should heer the melody I fetch
out of niggers, when I've got 'em at work down
South."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'd rather not, Mr. Yankee!" said
Lanner. "Come, I say, Bones" (to the Downy),
"what are you good for, if you can't tip us a
chant?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm kvite ekal to the hoccashun," replied
that gentleman. "There's no sairimony about me,
as the man said ven he took the furst turn at the
fire-escape, leavin' his mother-in-law to foller. Wot
shall it be, mates?" No one suggesting anything he
resumed. "Wot d'yer say to the 'Honest Poor
Man?' "</p>

<p>"Who's he?" growled Manvers. "I guess you'd
want a better illumination than you can raise on your
Mrs. Victoria's birthday to find that coon between
Sunday and Sunday."</p>

<p>"The vords of this 'ere chant," resumed the
Downy, "is my hown; the music was wrote by a
werry celeybrated Jew as was called Moses Hart&mdash;Moss 
Hart they called him, for short, and in crinsekense 
rekvires a stunnin' chorius, vun as vould vake
hup Hexeter 'All. You must hall jine in, or I'm
run down in a minnit. Here's Mister Gruffem with
a werry fine woice, as he keeps in the cellar for special
hoccashuns."</p>

<p>As he spoke that individual entered.</p>

<p>"I can't have no noise here," he said. "I ain't
got no license for music."</p>

<p>"Just this once, landlord," said Lanner; "and I'll
stand glasses all round."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 373 -->

<p>"Well, just this once, but dror it mild, gents, on
account of the babby."</p>

<p>"Never mind her," said Mrs. Gruffem, a little
pale, undersized woman with greasy curls, peeping in;
"she's been awake this quarter of an hour. I'm sure
I shall be glad of a little change; for I've heard
nothing but them awful words which I can't abide,
though I ought to get used to it, all this blessed evening. 
I am sure I can't think what folks use such
language for&mdash;that I can't. It don't do 'em no good.
I wish the Government would stop it, instead of
worriting us about a few innocent games, such as
skittles, which helps to draw folks out of the bar.
Now, young man, <i>if</i> you're going to begin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the Downy struck up, with a
voice which was originally by no means a despicable
tenor&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">THE HONEST POOR MAN.</p>

<p>Come bile up a chant to the honest poor man,<br/>

</div>

<p>The Downy's song was much applauded; and when
he executed a brief, but marvellously rapid "break-down" 
as soon as the last expiring effort of the chorus
was ended, the applause knew no bounds. Several
customers had come in from the bar. During the confusion 
in clearing the room, in which both Gruffem
and his pot-boy took a vehement part, the Downy
slipped out unperceived. On his return, he sat down
quite unconcernedly by Manvers.</p>

<p>"Waal," said that gentleman, "I guess you may
as well return my Colt. I've had my eye on them
front steps this five minutes, and I don't keer to continue 
the practice."</p>

<p>"I never robbed a pal in my life," returned the
Downy; "and I ain't goin' to begin now. I slipped
it into my pocket, ven I took that trifle of hexercise,
and werry nigh forgot it for the matter of a minnit.

<!-- vol 3 page 375 -->

Here it is," and he placed it on the table. "I never
see a Colt's rewolver afore. I'm werry much obliged
to you for a sight on it."</p>

<p>Manvers examined the caps, and replaced it in his
breast-pocket.</p>

<p>"I suppose," observed Tops, "that they don't think
much of a man's life in Amerikey?"</p>

<p>"No more, I reckon," returned Manvers, "than
they do in this darned old country about taking the
life of a chicken."</p>

<p>"That's a pint I should like to harguy," quoth the
Downy. "But fust, vith your leaf, I'll take a glass
vith the kimpany. Your 'ealth, genelmen! Now
vith regard to cheap lives, I'm for cheap living.
Wot's a chap got more nor his life? It's hall werry
vell to talk, but supposin' some vun helse took yourn?
You don't 'appen to 'ave rewolvin' lives too in them
parts, do yer?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Manvers; "but we're not
such tarnation funkers as you Britishers. Why we
make a fortin out there, and spend it, while you'd
be mixing a drink, that is, if you knew how to mix
one. I tell you, you're run out, and you'll have to
squirm pretty smart, if we don't re-annex you out of
kindness, and protect that old, used-up, worn-out,
mangy quadruped the British lion under the banner
of freedom&mdash;&mdash;" Here the magnanimous speaker
was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Gruffem.</p>

<p>"Any orders, gents?" said that personage. "I
thought the bell rung."</p>

<p>"What's the time, Mr. Gruffem?" asked Lanner.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 376 -->

<p>"The right time!" replied the Landlord. "The
clock's square to a second."</p>

<p>"Then here goes," said Lanner, quietly taking out
a pair of handcuffs from his pocket, and approaching
Manvers.</p>

<p>The latter did not notice this action of Lanner at
first. He was engaged in looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"Jeerusalem!" he muttered. "It's an hour past
the old cuss's time of meeting. He used to be punctual 
enough. It was his sole virtue." (Feels in his
pocket.) "Yes, here it is, sure enough; but he
don't know that I've left a copy in safe hands. I
shan't finish with him this bout, I reckon. How
natural this cursed lingo comes to me now." (To the
landlord, aloud.) "I say, old hoss, a light in that
black hole of mine up-stairs, will you?"</p>

<p>"You won't want that candle," said Lanner, coolly.
"John Swindles Manvers, I arrest you in the Queen's
name for murder!"</p>

<p>"Murder!" exclaimed Gruffem, starting back.</p>

<p>"Come," said Lanner, "the game's up. Out
with your bunches of fives. Close in, will you," he
shouted, rushing with his last words upon Manvers.
But the latter tripped him up, and felled him with a
terrific blow. Then pulling out his revolver, he fired
at the prostrate officer, and then in turn at Tops and
the Downy, and lastly at Gruffem.</p>

<p>"Curse you, you fat Judas! this is your doing,"
he said. At the last shot the cap merely exploded.
All the powder had fallen out of the chamber with
the concussion of the others.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 377 -->

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried the Downy, "I never see a
rewolver afore. Blaze away! The bullets is hall in
my pocket."</p>

<p>The answer was the pistol itself, hurled with tremendous 
violence at the speaker's head. Had he not
ducked with wonderful quickness, we are inclined to
think that the D. C. might have ended his earthly
career that evening.</p>

<p>"Now, mates," cried the pugnacious pot-boy, who
had entered of his own accord, making a rush at
Manvers like a bull-dog, an animal which he much
resembled.</p>

<p>But the desperado hurled him from him with a
violence which caused him to cannon from Tops and
strike the oaken panel of the room with considerable,
but abated violence.</p>

<p>In the mean time Lanner had partly arisen, bleeding, 
but undismayed. On his knees, he made an ineffectual 
grasp at the legs of Manvers, who seizing
the pepper-box from the table, wrenched the head off
and cast its contents partly in Lanner's and partly in
the Downy's eyes. Then seizing and flinging Tops
away from him with a sort of half-blow, half-push,
which, like the pat of a lion, was twice as effective as
it seemed, he darted with surprising velocity and
activity for a man of his weight up the stairs, and
was heard to shut and bolt a door above.</p>

<p>There was a pause of consternation and of pain,
for the pepper, though fortunately not cayenne, was
sufficiently pungent to blind those whose eyes had
been its recipients.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 378 -->

<p>Then there came a crash, a roar like that of a
wounded buffalo, ending in a shrill yell, and a thud
on the stones without, and all was still.</p>

<p>"Lord ha' mercy on his soul!" cried Gruffem.
"He's tried to escape by the little bridge, as was left
hanging half-way across this morning by them beggars 
of Irish workmen."</p>

<p>Lanner was the first to recover his presence of
mind. "If he's killed, he's saved his neck another
way, that's all, Mr. Landlord."</p>

<p>The Downy and the pot-boy rushed out of the
room. Tops was too much "shuk," as he called it,
to stir for a few moments; but Jem, who had received
by far the worst treatment, save that administered to
Mr. Lanner, was a glutton for punishment and as
hard as nails.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lanner, "he's by far the toughest
customer that ever I tackled. What a name he would
have made in the Ring. Sharp, too, or he wouldn't
have thought of the pepper. Stop! what's this?
Something he dropped in the struggle. It looks like
a will. Is this what you want, mate?" (to Tops)
"Give it to me again, when you've looked at it. I'll
take care that it is not mislaid."</p>

<p>Tops took it joyfully. "It's all right," he said.
"Oh! if we could only find Mr. Arthur now!"</p>

<p>At this moment a policeman entered, together with
the Downy, whose face looked ghastly pale even
through its sooty disguise, and who appeared, what
with blood, dirt, and pepper, anything rather than a
cheerful nigger minstrel.</p>

<p>"Is it a case of stretcher, mates?" asked Lanner.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 379 -->

<p>"Dead as door-nails!" was the answer. "He's
broke his neck, and fractured his skull, too, for that
matter. What shall we do with the body?"</p>

<p>"Close the house, and put it in the smoke-room.
See that nothing is disturbed. Well, mates!" continued 
Inspector Lanner, "I hope you are none the
worse for this little brush with a grizzly. It's nothing 
when you're used to it. Just ask your wife
for a basin and water, and towels" (to Gruffem),
"and a little vinegar and brown paper. I've an ugly
bruise or two."</p>

"It strikes me," said Tops to the Downy, in a half-whisper, 
"that we've come out of this a little shady,
with all the captain's cleverness. If it hadn't been
for you, there would have been a pretty story to be
told to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Vell," said the party appealed to; "he'd got
clear off as fur as ve wos consarned, and no mistake.
I never thought as I could 'a drored them bullets
hout as I did. If I hadn't had the right tool along
with me, ve'd 'a bin sarved out all round handsome.
Yer see, when I wos runnin' messages at Colt's, the
gent in the retail bis'ness often axed me to draw the
charges of pistils, as wos brought back by them as
didn't know how to use 'em. I s'pose it's no use
regrettin' <i>his</i> death, as is gone, but he wos the gamest
cove hever I come across and no mistake. I never
had no chance of getting hold on him. And wot's
more," said the Downy to himself, "I ain't much
haccount, ven it's four or five to vun. It may suit
the police, cos it's their dooty, but not this 'ere
nigger. I likes fair play and no favour." (Aloud.)

<!-- vol 3 page 380 -->

"I should like a drop o' summat short, guv'nor.
Pr'aps, you'd reckymind summat as is good."</p>

<p>Mr. Gruffem grinned, acquiesced, and produced a
bottle which he apparently kept for his own private
use.</p>

<p>Tops and the Downy took each a couple of glasses,
and the latter then divested himself of some of his
"nigger" paraphernalia, and endeavoured to clean
his face. But his face was unused to the treatment,
and resolutely withstood it for some time. Finally,
it presented a sort of parti-coloured appearance, which
was highly effective and amusing.</p>

<p>"May I have the will with me, Mr. Lanner?"
asked Tops. "You don't know how delighted some
parties will be with the sight of it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lanner, "you must bring it to the
police office to-morrow, and must let 'em think that
<i>you</i> found it, and then I don't so much mind. But
be careful!"</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried Tops. "Three cheers more, and
one in for the little one." His exulting shout sounded
strangely. The police were arranging the burly frame
of Manvers in the next room, and carefully taking
notes of the contents of his pockets. Moreover, a
terrific storm, which had been threatening London
and its environs all the afternoon, had burst over
their heads, utterly unobserved during the fight, and
now raged outside with all the fury of elemental
conflict. Next to the heart of the dead man was a
small leathern case attached by a faded ribbon worn
round his neck. In it they found, not bank-notes, nor
diamonds; but a lock of fair hair, and a letter, not

<!-- vol 3 page 381 -->

too well written, in a woman's hand, beginning,
"Dearest Jack!" The letter was worn and faded.
It had been written years ago by a gay and worthless
woman whom Manvers had loved, yes <i>loved;</i> but who
had never cared a straw for him, and who had lured
him to his ruin. A woman of the worst description,
known to the Haymarket and its purlieus, and for
whom he had first robbed his employer, and taken
the first step in crime. Yes, when Manvers was still
the prim, precise, and methodical prince of confidential 
clerks and cashiers in the City, he was already
a kind of "Champagne Charlie" at the "Blue Posts,"
Bob Croft's, and other night-houses of the West-end.
"Champagne Charlie!" what vulgarity of vice do
not those words suggest? Years ago, we remember
a song in praise of "cigars and cogni-&agrave;c" as it was
pronounced by unfledged ensigns and clerklings, and
the maturer crapulous fools of thirty, more or less.
Both good things in their way&mdash;the former hardly
equal to the pipe, that wondrous comfort, companion,
and solace in care; true friend, too, of the poor. But
for a youth or man to proclaim in song his adoration
of cigars and brandy as divinities&mdash;'tis an infinitely
base use to which to prostitute his sympathies and
apprentice his vocal talents. "Cigars and cogniac" had
undoubted greatly assisted in the fall of Manvers.
They had dulled his conscience and inflamed his
blood. It is the abuse, and not the use of them, which
we denounce; but let it be remembered that it is
always the abuse which is celebrated in the Bacchanalian 
and Cytherean lay.</p>

<p>Sufficient proofs of Grinderby's complicity were

<!-- vol 3 page 382 -->

also found in the pockets of the unhappy man, whose
violent death we have thus recorded.</p>

<p>"I say, landlord," said Mr. Lanner, who was
greatly consoled on finding that his beauty was not
likely to be impaired by the rough usage he had undergone, 
"could you manage a little supper&mdash;something 
hot&mdash;say a steak and fried onions, after all
this? I think I shall sleep here to-night; for the
storm is likely to last, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Captain Lanner; anything you like,
sir," was the reply. And he gave the order. "Get
clean sheets on the lodger's bed, Mary," he said to a
slipshod girl. "He won't want his room to-night."</p>

<p>Mr. Lanner was not troubled with nerves or refinement.</p>

<p>"Could I speak a word with you, captain," continued 
Gruffem.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Lanner. "Fire away."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you think I acted right this evening, 
Captain Lanner. There is a case coming on at
the Old Bailey about a robbery, and I've got a subp&oelig;na 
on it. They want to gammon the judge as how
it were planned in this house. All I know is that I
know nothing about it; but I expect that I shall
come in for it hot and strong. I've got enemies,
captain, as every honest man has, as tries to get a
living and injure no one. I hope no offence; but if
you could be there, and say a good word for me, it
may save my license."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Lanner. "You may depend on
me. I always go out of my way to serve a man who
has done right by me."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 383 -->

<p>"And about the money, as the stiff un there owes
me for his lodging and keep? It's nigh fifteen pound.
Is there any chance of my getting paid? It's all in
my books quite reg'lar and correct."</p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can," returned Lanner. "There's
a matter of fifty pound been found on him."</p>

<p>"He promised to pay me this very night," said
Gruffem; "and it would be very hard if I lost it,
seeing we must all live."</p>

<p>Lanner nodded carelessly, and lit a cigar. After
a little pleasant chat, he bade Tops and the Downy
good-night. "Don't forget, you must be at the
station to-morrow morning, the pair of you. Here,
I want to speak to you" (to the Downy). "I think,"
whispered Mr. Lanner, "I wouldn't say anything
about drawing the charges of that revolver." (And
he slipped a sovereign into the Downy's hand). "I'll
take care of you. Don't you be afraid. You may
want a friend some of these odd days. Eh?" And
Mr. Lanner winked and nodded, and puffed his
smoke in a series of little rings very pretty to
behold.</p>

<p>Tops and the Downy got into a Hansom cab. "I
must change these togs," said the former, "and get
to the Hopera as soon as I can. I promised to fetch
Susan. She's gone to hear the missus sing to-night.
It's a fancy of hers jest to see how she's received in
England. I say, what was it Lanner said to you
jest now?"</p>

<p>The Downy told him.</p>

<p>"But how will he account for the bullets hitting
none of us?" asked Tops.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 384 -->

<p>"Oh! that's heasy enough," replied the Downy.
"It was on account of his hactivity and hartfulness,
don't yer see? We should hall 'ave been shot, if
the hinspector of perlice hadn't bin there. It was
him as dodged the bullets, and hindered we from
bein' 'it."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's the game, is it?" replied Tops; "and
are you going to be so soft as to oblige him?"</p>

<p>"Vot's the hodds?" asked the Downy. "It'll
do him good, and von't hurt me. Vy, they vouldn't
so much as horder me a pint of ale, if I'd ha' saved
the Lord Mayor and the Harchbishop of Middlesex,
and hall Her Majesty's ministers from bein' shot.
They'd say it was a haxident, or say nothink about it,
if it wos proved in court; and they'd give the revard
to a party as wos handy at the time, and didn't vant
it, the biggest svell as appeared to be vithin hearin'
of the shots. As like as not, they'd 'and hover a
testymonial and a barrinetcy, if he ain't got vun
halready, to Sir Richard Mayne for bein' Chief
Kimmishuner of the Bobbies the year as it was
done."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed, if I don't believe you're about
right," said Tops.</p>

<p>"Arter all, this 'ere Lanner's not a bad sort; and
if it'll hoblige him, I ain't pertickler to a shade,"
quoth the Downy.</p>

<p>"But you surely won't go for to say as you didn't
do what you did?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>The Downy shook his head.</p>

<p>"I ain't agoin' to say nothink, but wot I'm axed.
I leaves hall the lying and prewaricatin' to them as

<!-- vol 3 page 385 -->

can make it hanswer. They'll make it all right
enough for themselves, or I don't know 'em. Don't
you be afeard."</p>

<p>The honest fellow had reason for what he said.
How often do we see rewards lavished on humbugs
and pretenders, when the claims of true and real
benefactors to Society, their country, and the world
are ignored and pooh-poohed with contempt! If a
man is too poor to put in an appearance, to advertise 
himself, to give dinners and reward his adherents
and supporters, he is more likely to reap abuse and
ridicule for a benefit conferred upon the community,
than praise. When he is dead, some one may or may
not seek to make contingent capital out of his fame,
and urge the bestowal of a trumpery pension on his
widow and children, if haply he leave any, and they
survive the wave of forgetfulness which has rolled
over his grave. A leading journal may take his
history for the text of a leading article, and point out
how his busy brain and unpaid and unrecognised
exertions saved millions or gained millions for an
ungrateful country. But even this is a chance, and
not a certainty, and depends upon the chapter of
accidents, and whether the rich pretenders who have
robbed him of his fame, if not of his substantial reward, 
have passed away in time.</p>

<p>Thus may a man labour one half of his life to
launch a great enterprise conceived in his own head,
and triumph in the universal recognition of the fact
he has worked night and day to proclaim. He shall
labour the other half to identify himself with his
own work and its results, and if he cannot purchase

<!-- vol 3 page 386 -->

the acknowledgment of truth with money, he shall
labour in obscurity and in vain.</p>

<p>Nay, he is fortunate, if he does not live to reap
derision for his pains, and to see his own deeds and
merits commemorated, on a monument to a wealthy
impostor, or an aristocratic charlatan.</p>

<p>The cab rolled on for some time before either Tops
or the Downy opened their lips. As they passed
over London Bridge, the former pulled out the will
from his breast.</p>

<p>"We must find him," he said, "dead or alive;
but it's my opinion that he lives. And if we find
him, and he don't settle a hannuity on my noble
friend here," clapping the Downy on the back, "I'll
swallow them six bullets for pills. Have you seen
the Signora? Of course not. Do you know that
she has asked for you a dozen times, if she have
once? She ain't one of the ungrateful sort. It's
just like you. Why don't you go to see her? She'll
see that you never want for anything, I'll pound it.
Didn't you save her life?"</p>

<p>The Downy shook his head. "I ain't agoin' nigh
her," he said, "and that's all about it, mate. Didn't
she and t'other hangel come down vith a pot o'
money, and vere is it? Sum on it was eat and
drunk on the premises, and the lieyers has the rest.
Wot'll she think of my kimmershial transacshuns?
I ain't agoin' to appear in her blessed bright, beautiful 
heyes like a fool, if I knows it. Besides, jest
look at wot I had for no more than I done 'arf a
score o' times and never thought nothink of no
more?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 387 -->

<p>Tops looked at him hard, but said nothing. The
fact is, at that moment they were both startled by so
vivid a flash of lightning, followed by a deafening
crash of thunder, that neither spoke for a few minutes,
save in reference to the storm. Its violence, however, 
abated just as they arrived at the lodgings in a
court off Holborn, where Tops was to change his
clothes.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night, Mister Downy," he said,
"you're a trump, and no mistake; but if you don't
have a hannuity, my name ain't Tops, and I ain't
agoing to marry my Susan."</p>

<p>The Downy pursued his way towards Westminster
Bridge, over which he lived, somewhere down behind
Astley's Theatre, as we have understood; and where
he repaired furniture, and did odd jobs, enjoying an
immense popularity among all the small children in
his immediate vicinity, whose toys he mended, whose
balls he rescued from various lodgments and mishaps
down areas and over walls and railings, and who
sometimes rode on his truck or barrow, and sometimes
on his back. On this particular night his road thither
was not very straight, as he stopped at various low
publics on the way, played three or four games of
skittles, and smoked several pipes. Suffice it to say,
that it was between twelve and one before he reached
Westminster Bridge. For the present let us leave
him to enjoy himself after his own peculiar fashion
<i>en route</i>.

<p>Mr. Tops put on a pair of very tight black trousers
and a cut-away black coat and vest, which latter
reached down far on his hips, a blue satin tie, fastened

<!-- vol 3 page 388 -->

with a horse-shoe pin, and a pair of boots very square
in the toes, and as resplendent as they could be made
with blacking. On the summit of this gorgeous
array he poised a hat, which a prince might have
envied, it was so napless and low in the crown, and
he felt himself fit for the "Uproar," as the Downy
called it, or for a congress of the most wide-awake
swells in Europe. Thus apparelled, he proceeded to
the Haymarket, conscious of being half an hour too
late; but radiant and triumphant, not to say defiant,
in his mood and swagger. With a cigar in his
mouth, a carnation in his button-hole, happiness in
his heart, and the will in his pocket, which he was
longing for Susan to read through and thoroughly
explain, a task rather above his capacity. Tops
felt, as he said, as if he had won the Derby by a
neck, and positively rejoiced in his aching bones and
smarting bruises.</p>

<p>We are convinced that no excuse, no gain, no
triumph, in short, nothing will successfully plead his
excuse for being late to Susan during at least the first
ten minutes. Did any woman ever listen to reason
pleading against wounded vanity in less than that
time?</p>

</div>

<p>BEFORE the entrance to the Opera, a man wild
and ragged, with matted hair and beard, and sunken
eyes, with a torn and threadbare coat buttoned up to
the chin, not even shabbily genteel, but downright
poverty-stricken, to which coat, street-charity might
have been justified in offering pence&mdash;such a one
pauses, and ventures to read the affiches of the
luxury of Music and of Song. There had been, as we
have narrated, a thunder-storm, and the man was
drenched to the skin; the day had been dark, close,
sultry, and lurid; the artillery of Heaven had, however, 
limbered up and retreated, muttering occasionally 
with stray shots in the distance; reverberating 
along the reaches of the river, it might be heard

<!-- vol 3 page 390 -->

occasionally in Trafalgar-square, where there was a
pause in the din of traffic. There had been reinforcements 
somewhere in the line of retreat, somewhere 
about Woolwich, and then Erith, or Purfleet;
but in London the leaden skies only continued to
weep in a dreary and disconsolate manner, as for a
battle lost. In fact, it was a wet night after a storm.
So there were not many persons, save those whose
duty brought them there, hanging about the Opera
House, crowded as it was; so some one said who
had been in, and was speeding eastwards, without
waiting for the ballet, to write his critique to appear
in a daily newspaper the next morning. Arthur
Aubrey, therefore, read undisturbed for a short
time, reading at first mechanically, and then with a
species of wild excitement approaching madness in
its aspect.</p>

<p>What is that he says and repeats? "First appearance 
of the renowned singer!" (vacantly).
"Ha! ha! it will be my last appearance on any
stage, soon." (Continues reading.) "Bianca&mdash;Stellini&mdash;Bianca? 
That is Blanche!&mdash;Blanche!&mdash;my
eyes are dim. Her Majesty's Theatre. Poor Queen!
She cannot go to her own theatre now. It is a
long time since I was at the Opera. What is the
day of the month?" (Reads.) "Great Heavens!
The anniversary of her death. My Bianca! my
Blanche!" (Pauses and then continues reading.)
"Bianca Stellini&mdash;in the celebrated opera&mdash;composed
for her, expressly, and produced for the first time in
this country . . . ." (Raises his voice.) " 'The Blind
Bride of Sorrento!' Teresina Fabiani&mdash;Signora

<!-- vol 3 page 391 -->

Bianca Stellini. Strange! strange! My head is
giving way. I have eaten nothing to-day. Is it
fancy? Let me look again. No! there are the
letters. I must wait and try to see this Bianca come
out. If she should be like my Blanche&mdash;ha! ha!
what a fancy&mdash;I am going mad. But she sleeps,
sleeps under the waters. The blind bride! The
blind bride!"</p>

<p>Here there was a commotion, the Opera being
over, and several persons coming out.</p>

<p>"I will go to the stage-door and see her, if they do
not drive me away," said Aubrey. "I remember
once seeing a ragged man just like myself, as I must
appear now, look into our carriage as we drove away,
and I never forgot his expression. The police pushed
him back. Who could he be?"</p>

<p>Thus wildly talking, he disappeared behind a
carriage.</p>

<p>"It's no use scolding me, I tell you," quoth Tops,
who appeared talking to a young lady under the
piazza. "You wouldn't listen to a word I had to
say, and now I've a mind not to tell you at all."</p>

<p>"There's no excuse," said Susan, for it was she to
whom Mr. Tops addressed himself; "but whatever
you have to say, make haste and say it; for I must be
home in time to meet missus. Oh, dear! it was
lovely to-night. It's a piece missus has had written
for her, a story something like her own. Mr. Edgar
has translated it from the 'libretter.' Only she, that
is Teresina, becomes rich and gives her husband all
the money, and goes into a convent, and won't see
him any more. Oh! it is so beautiful, the 'no, non

<!-- vol 3 page 392 -->

credo pew (pi&ugrave;),' where she tells him she won't have
anything more to say to him, and serves him right
too."</p>

<p>"Bother Teresina!" said Tops. "Will you listen?
I've got the will, I tell you. And to think you won't
listen!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Susan. "No! never! Got it!
And is it worth anything after all, for I never believed 
in it?"</p>

<p>"I want you to see it," said Tops. "Never mind
about being a little late to-night, but come over
yonder and have some supper&mdash;I'm half starved&mdash;and 
just look at the will, and see what it is. It's a
very short one, this time, that's one comfort. I've
seen the date&mdash;a fortnight before poor master's father
died."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come for half an hour," said Susan;
"for I <i>could</i> eat something myself, after that beautiful 
opera. Six times before the curtain! Think
of that!"</p>

<p>"Six shots from a pistol!" cried Tops; "and it's a
mercy me and Mr. Downy wasn't killed, let alone the
captain! Think of that!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Susan, "who ever heard of
six shots from one pistol? I know better than that."</p>

<p>"This comes of living abroad," said Tops, as they
seated themselves in a small, quiet-looking oyster-shop, 
on the other side of the Haymarket from the
Opera House, about half-way up. "I suppose you
never heard of a revolver?"</p>

<p>"Yes I have," said Susan. "To be sure. They

<!-- vol 3 page 393 -->

do go off ever so many times, I believe. I forgot all
about them. I was thinking of her being aimed at,
as one may say, with so many bouquets."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Tops, "that we was being aimed
at with bullets; and this Manvers, or Tadgers, or
whatever he called himself, is killed, and a-lying weltering 
in his gore, and it's a wonder it ain't me instead, 
and here you talk of your blessed Opera, as if
nothing had happened."</p>

<p>"Killed!" exclaimed Susan. "Killed! That is
dreadful, indeed. But tell me, Tops. You didn't
kill him, I hope? I never could like you again if
you did. There, don't touch me, if you've killed a
man!"</p>

<p>"Suppose I have killed him, didn't he try to kill
me?" answered Tops, who rather liked the notion of
his prowess conveyed by the inquiry. "Perhaps you'd
have liked he should have killed me instead."</p>

<p>Susan began to cry. "Oh, Tops!" she whimpered,
"I never could marry a man whose hands were
stained by a fellow-creature's gore."</p>

<p>"Two pints of stout, immediate," said Tops to the
waiter, who appeared at that moment, napkin in
hand, "and a dozen ice-eaters" (so he pronounced
it), "and a small lobster&mdash;bread-and-butter for
two."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, directly, sir. Any salad with the lobster,
sir?"</p>

<p>"None for me," said Susan. "They never wash
it clean. I had a lettuce once that was alive."</p>

<p>"Beg your parding, miss," said the waiter, "it

<!-- vol 3 page 394 -->

couldn't 'ave been here, we always wash our salads
very perticler."</p>

<p>"Soft or hard soap?" asked Tops.</p>

<p>"Beg your parding, sir, not with no manner of
soap at all, sir, but the best of pump-water. It
must be Pegg's, as you mean, miss" (naming a rival
establishment). "You see, sir, they've sich a custom
there, which they've robbed us of, as I might say,
that they haven't time to wash their salads, and folks
as is drunk, as they mostly are as goes there, is not so
perticler&mdash;no, sir, it stands to reason, don't it? And
as for their hysters, why, I've knowed it take two
people to swallow one of <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"Two people?" cried Tops. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the waiter, "perhaps the lady
wouldn't like to hear it before supper."</p>

<p>"Drive on!" said Tops, "I think it's best beforehand. 
But I say, give us that stout, will you?"</p>

<p>"Suttinly, sir, yes, sir!" and the waiter disappeared 
and reappeared with the pewters.</p>

<p>Whilst he was gone on this errand, Mr. Tops gave
a brief outline of the event of the evening, related in
the last chapter, to Susan.</p>

<p>"Well," said that young lady, "I never heard of
such a set of foolish harum-scarum donkeys in my
life. You deserve a good whipping, every one of
you. I should have thought Captain Lanner would
have known better. Why, Mr. Downy was worth
the whole lot of you. I forgive him, for his cleverness. 
Only think if you had been shot!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 395 -->

<p>"What's the matter with the girl?" cried Tops
in answer. "You're as white as" (he was going to
say the table-cloth, but hesitated) "as a sheet, that
you are."</p>

<p>"Only a little faint! This place is so hot. Open
the window. I shall be better for the stout," she
answered.</p>

<p>And she was better for it directly afterwards.</p>

<p class="small">THE MEETING ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Il se forge en ce monde des hazards auxquels les gens de petit esperit
n'accordent point de cr&eacute;ance, pour ce que ces dictes rencontres semblent
supernaturelles.</p>

<p>THE haggard man dodged about the carriages, as
if his intentions were not honourable.</p>

<p>"I say, Bill," said one policeman to another,
"whatever's that cove up to? He ain't any one as
I know. I ain't seen him try to fetch no cabs, nor
open no doors."</p>

<p>"He looks precious wild," said the other. "I'll
attend to him directly, as soon as the Prince is gone.
He wants looking arter, he does."</p>

<p>"You don't think he's going to shoot any one, do
you?" said the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Not he; but jest pass the word not to let him
come anigh the royal carriages. Here!" (to Arthur)
"be off, will yer? or I'll precious soon make yer."
But Aubrey heard him not, and disappeared at the
moment.</p>

<p>The Royal party drove off, and at last a shout was

<!-- vol 3 page 397 -->

raised, "Madame Stelleeny's car-ridge, Mad-ame
Stelleeny's car-ridge stops the way!"</p>

A neat dark brougham and pair drove up. Then
came forth the great Cantatrice, surrounded by an
admiring circle, lessee, manager, singers, musicians.
Opera enthusiasts, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, including large
patrons in the way of loan, lord and Jew banker,
admitted by virtue of their privilege&mdash;had it been by
privilege of their virtue, they assuredly would have
remained outside. There was the bloated Lord Tipton 
and Wednesbury. There was Sir Robert Postobit, 
who had arrived at the dignity of whiskers, and
a seat in the House of Commons, and had inherited
another great property, since he broke his father's
heart and spent his own, and had learnt the wicked
ways of the world, so far as a necessary portion of
its selfishness and "prudence" were concerned. There
was Lieutenant-Colonel Plantagenet, M.P., whose
father was called old Stagglicher, late of "Germany"&mdash;Houndsditch, 
and who had surpassed all
other knaves in a period of unexampled knavery in
the history of the commercial decline of England.
There was a very old felonious duke, of whom dark
stories were told in conversation, now and then, but
who had never been convicted, nor brought before
a police court in his own name. There was Stingray,
of course, and Hugag of the "Centipede," knighted
at last as a reward for his gushing court sycophancy,
at least so 'twas said. Why should not a man be
knighted for social depravity in England, when a
Paynim is admitted to the Order of the Garter, which
was especially directed against his race, his religion.

<!-- vol 3 page 398 -->

and his existence on earth? There was a death's-head 
and skeleton figure in dress clothes, whom even
Profligacy scouted from her ranks; until Morality
pocketed his bribe, and took him by the hand, re-introducing 
him to Society, not even as a dreadful
example, but as an injured and a slandered man.
There were these and many more.</p>

<p>Through them quickly stepped Blanche, smiling
and utterly unconscious, if not of their presence, yet
of their character, their intentions, or their lives.
Like the Lady in the Masque of Milton among the
midnight crew of Comus, like a spell-girt sea-nymph
gliding through a submarine chamber lined with
interlacing polypi, she passed unconscious through
that unholy throng, with all its passions, its cynicism,
and its godless unrevealed history and attributes, and,
above all, utterly heedless of the accursed magnetic
power of its wealth. She saw in it but the lovers of
dramatic art and amateurs of song. Nay, she smiled
on it a sweet smile of pleasure and thankfulness, as
she slightly inclined her small hooded head to either
side as she went through. Outside, for a moment
she threw back her hood, and looked around at the
mirror-like pavements, as they reflected back the
lamps, and saw the wet and glistening carriages and
steaming horses, the eager crowd pushing, shouting,
and moving under the colonnade, the grey pillars of
the opposite theatre, the illuminated Haymarket cafes
and their several groups before the door, the eager
cab-drivers, and the shining capes of the policemen&mdash;all 
this she saw in a few brief moments, ere she
gained her carriage, pulled up the window, which

<!-- vol 3 page 399 -->

caused her to look like a "Sabrina fair" sitting
"under the glassy cool translucent wave," and was
driven away, with a slight cheer and clapping of
hands from the crowd. As she looked around her, a
hoarse scream was heard, probably from some drunken
wretch; and the form of a man flitted from behind a
pillar, crossed the street regardless of a pair of horses,
which reared nearly over him, and disappeared in the
shadows of a narrow street across the road.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Susan to Tops, as they stood
under shelter in front of the Haymarket Theatre,
anxiously looking for an empty cab, and feeling as
comfortable as lobsters, stout, the possession of the
will, which Susan declared to be all right, and the
prospect of their speedy union, could make them.
"Did you see that man? Whatever can he be
up to?"</p>

<p>"No good, I should say," said Tops. "I should
say it's the ghost of the chap as swallowed that ice-eater, 
the waiter told us of."</p>

<p>And they both laughed a merry little laugh. Heaven
help us! From thoughtless boyhood to purblind old
age, how often do the pangs of others minister to our
enjoyment? The clown with starving children, the
pantaloon with a painful, hopeless disease, the seamstress 
who stitched all night at the ball-dress trimmed
with roses, the girl whose attenuated fingers wove
the flowers of the bridal wreath, the figment of
humanity whose gait and garb cause us merriment in
the street, the anguish of those who die leaving us
their heirs, the toil of those who work to leave us the
means of existence when they die, the armed host,

<!-- vol 3 page 400 -->

each with its Iliad of sufferings, woes, and deaths,
in order that one day of triumph may be celebrated, or
that one mortal name be breathed during thrice three
hundred, or thrice three thousand years&mdash;what does
it matter? What are days or hours in the history of
the countless ocean pebbles that roll to our feet on
the moaning shores? Is it not all the same story?</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">For some must weep and some must play.</p>

</div>

<p>Ay, and too often many must weep, in order that
few may play.</p>

<p>We must change our scene. It is some two hours
later, and the rain still comes down steadily, though
much less heavily than before. There is an oppression 
in the atmosphere, in spite of the storm. Broad
and massive Westminster Bridge is nearly deserted.
A lengthy train hurtles across at Hungerford, probably 
the last, before some few brief hours of repose.
The colossal Clock Tower gives forth its brazen sound.
It is a quarter to two, and London sleeps, as much as
ever it does sleep; for entire rest never comes to the
Great City by night. Close to where yon fair and
beautiful girl is sleeping in a wealthy abode, dreaming 
innocent dreams of paradise and love, is a grim
slaughter-house, where greasy, blood-stained figures
of men, and with them a nice cheerful merry lad,
apprentice to the "dreadful trade," are busily slaughtering 
lambs. From her chamber window that young
lady could see, were she to look, the shadows of
the figures performing in the sacrificial rites through
the grated windows and ventilating skylight, and
might wonder at the redness of that glare, ruddy as

<!-- vol 3 page 401 -->

the planet Mars. It is the reflection of the steaming
blood of the sacrifice on the whitewashed walls. Were
she to open her window, she would hear the sounds
of the assassination within&mdash;bleat and gurgle, blow
and thud on the reeking floor. What of it? That
young lady, horrified as she would be at the scene,
eats lamb. To-morrow she will enjoy for breakfast
<i>rognons d'agneau saut&eacute;s au vin de Mad&egrave;re</i>. The
lambs suffer, that beauty as well as ugliness may
eat. How many nice little boys, and girls too, would
like to peep in by daytime, and see the baa-lambs
killed! What other scenes are going on in London
at that hour, it would need an Asmodeus to tell. A
father and mother sit mourning for their lost child,
a little boy of ten, who fell out of a two-story window,
but a fortnight before. He has just said aloud, to
console her, but she knows not what he has said,
"Father! not our will, but Thine be done." It was
their only child. Yonder is a light from a student's
window high in the Strand. He is working early
and late for his examination in surgery. He, too,
has a father and mother, and the thought of them is
present as he studies; for he is an affectionate son.
What is it that he is poring over and turning round?
It is the heart of a boy killed, as he carelessly informed
two or three of his friends, by a fall from a window!
<i>O c&aelig;ca mens! O dura mortalium ilia!</i> And were it
not so, where should we be? What mind could bear
to be <i>en rapport</i> with the universal and particular
tortures of humanity, or even of dogs, not to speak
of the entire donkey family, and the numerous martyrs 
to brutality among domestic cats? One sees a

<!-- vol 3 page 402 -->

battle-field, either in part, or as a panorama of the
wounded and slain. Who could realise it all, in all
its particulars, with all the living mourners, all the
frantic scenes that shall follow, when <i>that</i> butcher's
bill reaches home? So London did not entirely sleep,
and Westminster Bridge was not altogether still, as
the same ragged figure we saw at the Haymarket
reeled across, and gained the pavement at the end
near the Houses of Parliament, and looked out upon
river and sky, gazing mechanically at houses, chimneys, 
barges, and motionless steamers moored for the
night, and many other objects, all painted in Indian
ink, and lighted by the yellow and sickly lamplights
flickering near and far through the gloom.</p>

<p>"Mad! mad!" the figure shouted, with a hoarse
voice. "For, as I live and am about to die, I would
have sworn it was she herself. Do the fiends mock
our despair with delusive forms and shapes, to turn
all our thoughts from God, at such a time as this?
Merciful Heaven! Is it a crime in me to die, who
am unable longer to drag out a miserable existence?
Last night I slept, oh, horror! horror! within the
walls of a pitiless Gehenna itself. Tired as I was, the
stench, and utterances more dreadful than the stench,
awoke me, and I thought I was in Hell, whose fiends
were at play. I was the mark of all their jeers, the
butt of all their obscenities too gross for thought. I
will not endure such a night again. Heaven cannot
ask it of me; for Heaven surely decrees not the
pollution of the soul. If I lie down here to die, my
tortured body will be found and dragged to a dead-house, 

<!-- vol 3 page 403 -->

and perhaps recognised. No! no! I have no
pride. I have taken alms in the street. I have eaten
the refuse which menials could not sell, with the
fierceness of a famished hound. A merciful Providence, 
a vengeful Deity, can ask no more of me than
what I have endured and deserve, yes, deserve. Oh!
Blanche, if by some miracle thou art alive&mdash;if it was
thyself whom I saw&mdash;radiant, triumphant, beautiful&mdash;but 
no! no! thou wast blind when I deserted thee;
blind! blind! It was a trick of sight&mdash;a delusion
of the senses, before death, sent to remind me more
forcibly of all that I did&mdash;the enormity of my folly
and crime."</p>

<p>The unfortunate man paused.</p>

<p>" 'Tis but a leap," he said. "The water seems to
grow nearer and invite me, as I gaze at it. I hear its
rush beneath&mdash;its lapping tongues murmur of forgetfulness, 
oblivion. The tide is running down.
So much the better! God in Heaven forgive me!
Blanche, I come, I come. Thy name shall be the last
on ray lips&mdash;Blanche!"</p>

<p>He took a few paces backward, and then rushed
forward. As he did so, a man met him in full career,
running from the Lambeth side of the river, and sent
him reeling to his knees.</p>

<p>"Pick up the pieces!" cried the unknown individual, 
who had so opportunely (as it might be)
interposed. "Here, old feller! You ain't a contemplatin' 
sooicide, air yer! Don't yer see the fire
there? Come along and bear a hand, vill yer? You'll
get a warmin', I can promise yer, in no time."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 404 -->

<p>So saying, the Downy, for he it was, pulled
Aubrey forcibly around, and pointed to a red glare
just over the bridge.</p>

<p>"Don't yer hear 'em a-shoutin'?" he said. "There
ain't a hinjin hup yet. There's the Prince of Wales
and the Dook of Sutherland'll be there directly, and
they'll be a axing for me like mad."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? A fire? Where is it?"
cried the bewildered Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Vy, yer not awake. <i>There!</i> This vay! Look
sharp. The great Eur&ograve;pyan Limited Liability Company's 
Hotel's afire, that's all. Now then, this vay!
This vay!" And the pair rushed off together, as the
blaze increased, and the smoke rolled forth in mighty
volumes, and the rattling sound of an engine was
heard approaching, and the cries and shouts of the
multitude rent the watery air.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p class="small">THE CONFLAGRATION (UNLIMITED).</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Did you ever see a French fire? "Mossoo" is as active and demonstrative 
as a whole troop of monkeys in a blazing forest. He
chatters, like the poor parrots lately burnt in the Tropical Department
of the Crystal Palace. He is as brave as a lion; but somehow his
energies are not practical, and he can't put it out. The French authorities 
press the passers-by and lookers-on to assist; the English don't
encourage volunteers. We dare say it is the same thing in an inundation. 
But let us beware of boasting. The characteristics of both
nations are altering. "Mossoo" is no longer polite, and has won a
Derby, and John Bull has taken to music-halls and "la danse;" while
railways, steam-ships, vacation-tours, and the Great Exhibition, have
taught him some vices, which untravelled and uncorrupted he would
but a short time ago, have either never dreamt of, or at least believed
that they were washed away with the Flood.&mdash;<i>Diogenes Cynicus</i>
(<i>modernus</i>).</p>

<p>IF the reader ever saw a fire in London, and one
in a foreign country&mdash;we will not be invidious and
name any country here&mdash;but "bar one," as the betting-men 
say, that intelligent personage is able to appreciate 
at their real value the dash, energy, courage,
and consummate skill of the British firemen. It is a
band of heroes deserving of being chronicled in song
and prose, in marble and stone "basso relievo," that
rushes forth helmeted and caparisoned at the terrible

<!-- vol 3 page 406 -->

cry of "fire" in this wilderness of brick. They drive
like demigods, like the charioteers of old at the
Olympic Games, but with ten times the difficulty,
chiefly by night, over the rattling stones, and through
the crowded thoroughfares! What a sight of wonder
is the harnessing and the start! You are walking in
a street nearly blocked with equipages. Suddenly a
sound is heard, which once heard is never to be forgotten&mdash;the 
cry of the gallant fellows as they cluster
on the engine whirling along the street. How they
manage to clear all obstacles at the pace is a miracle&mdash;say, 
rather a triumph of their craft. Then, when
arrived, what courage, what martyrdom, what coolness, 
what resource! The dash past of the Horse
Artillery at the gallop is magnificent, exciting; but
how different the mission. Yet the mission of the
Fire-Brigade is danger without glory. If a fireman
perishes, little is thought or said. So, indeed, with
the common soldier, as he is called in this country,
being the most uncommon soldier in the world. The
asses get the chief part of the credit, whilst the lions
rot or starve, if they survive their "glory," which is
in the deed.</p>

<p>It was as the Downy had said. Several lords,
officers, and gentlemen, had turned into most indifferent 
innkeepers, and a vast hotel had arisen from
the ground, not quite so quickly as Pandemonium or
Aladdin's Palace, but still very quickly, at the deluded 
shareholders' expense. But the mismanagement 
had not yet exploded, and the hotel took in the
public at large still, as well as its own shareholders.
The place was full. The stately housekeeper had

<!-- vol 3 page 407 -->

refused with scorn that very day a dozen luckless
or lucky voyageurs. There is no need to treat a
traveller with contempt, when you can't lodge him;
but town was full, and the housekeeper was ignorant
and proud. In these hotels, when you are accepted,
that is, when the house is not full, and the house-keeper 
consequently not inordinately uncivil, you are
apt to merge into a number, like a convict, and your
friends, who call by appointment, have a great difficulty 
in finding you, especially if you lodge high.
A lift in the world is a desirable thing, and so is a
"lift" in a Grand Hotel; but it has its disadvantages.
It can scarcely be worked with success at two o'clock
in the morning, when the hotel is on fire, and especially 
when the lift itself is a huge tunnel of flame
and smoke, which was the case with the Grand
European L. L. Hotel, on this particular occasion.
When Aubrey and the Downy arrived on the scene
of action, most of the inmates had escaped. Those on
the sixth floor had a special opportunity, as there was
a balustraded roof along which they trooped, and descended 
by a ladder on to the roof of a neighbouring
house. The ground and first floor were all right;
for the fire had broken out on the second, through a
box of Vesuvians in the tail-pocket of a gentleman's
coat, which he threw on the ground and trod on as he
got into bed. All had apparently escaped, when our
two ragged heroes arrived near the spot, save a lady on
the fourth floor, who appeared at a window dressed,
with a child in her arms, and who was in imminent
danger of being burnt. A mutilated fire-escape did
not quite reach her range of windows, and the flames

<!-- vol 3 page 408 -->

burst out beneath, so that both it and a mason's ladder
had to be removed, while the fireman directed their
engines beneath. Strange to say, the top portion of
the escape had been struck by lightning that very
afternoon. At this sight, an indomitable force and
energy seemed to have leapt into Aubrey's attenuated
frame. There were cries and counter-cries. Above
all rose the cry: "She'll be burnt! She'll be burnt."
"A thousand guineas to the man who'll save her,"
cried a portly gentleman in the crowd. The offer was
excusable; since it was evident that he was unable
even to attempt the task himself. Then a youthful 
form leapt from an engine which drove up, and
a cry went forth that it was the Prince of Wales, and
a cheer rose from the mob (Englishmen would be
loyal between the shocks of an earthquake), and the
attention of the crowd, and even that of the chiefs
of the Fire-Brigade and police, were divided. But
for this Aubrey and the Downy would not have won
their way to the foot of the escape, which they did
just as a momentary slackening of the blaze allowed
a brief chance. But the escape was too short. Cries
of "Jump out!" "Get some beds to put underneath," 
and "Go to the roof and you'll get out,"
were heard. But the lady heard nothing, save the
general howl, and din, and roar. She was praying
with white lips, and her child tightly pressed in her
arms.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" shouted Aubrey to the police, who
had seized him. "I'll save her, or at least die in the
attempt. Let me go, I say."</p>

<p>"Here, mate!" sung out the ever active Downy,

<!-- vol 3 page 409 -->

who had seized a coil of thin rope, and plunged it in
a fountain of water that rose some four of five feet
in the street. "I'm with you."</p>

<p>Aubrey had just time to seize it, as the police once
more collared the struggling Downy.</p>

<p>"What are you arter?" cried an active and intelligent 
officer. "I knows you. You want to rob
the hot-el, do yer? Here, lock him up!"</p>

<p>But a cry of "Look out!" as a portion of an ornamental 
balcony fell caused the Downy to escape his
clutch, and he darted after Aubrey, who was already,
encumbered as he was with the rope, midway up the
escape. Through bursts of blinding, singeing flames,
the pair arrived at the top. Then the Downy unwound 
his companion's rope; they were but some
eight feet below the window. At the first shot, he
flung an end far into the room, whilst Aubrey with
supernatural strength and activity, totally careless of
whether he fell or not, raised himself to his full
height on the giddy top of the escape, and leaping
upwards caught an architectural projection, and
thence an iron stanchion of the window, and gained
the room.</p>

<p>"Lower the child to me!" yelled the Downy.</p>

<p>A tremendous cheer burst from the assembled
mob. We believe that even Royalty, so nobly and
generously urging the good work below, was completely 
forgotten for the next few moments. Hats
and caps were actually thrown up by the mob, and
strong men sobbed like babes. It was a supreme
moment for a gang of pickpockets in the crowd; and
Mr. Stingray lost his watch, purse, diary, and gold

<!-- vol 3 page 410 -->

pencil-case, as Aubrey plunged into the room. Half
a dozen respirations of the quick-breathing spectator,
and the babe is in the Downy's arms, who slid down
in a truly surprising manner, considering that he had
but one arm disengaged, fell the last fifteen or twenty
feet, luckily on a mattress, and holding the child
somehow aloft, gave it to a woman who demanded it&mdash;none 
other than the agonised Susan, who had been
dragged out, against her utmost endeavours, below,
having descended for something for the child, and
lost herself in the hotel. The Downy vanished in
the crowd. He was somewhat exhausted, and this
time fell an easy prey to his natural foes the police.
Part of the child's lace clothing remained in his
grasp, and he was on the point of being carried off
again, when a party of gentlemen who had seen his
bravery interfered and rescued him in turn. In the
mean time, how fared Aubrey and the lady? He
dashed the contents of a jug of water over her.
Throughout he acted like an inspired man, a human
machine set in motion in a dream, knowing nothing
but what he was about, and doing it bravely and
rapidly. Then he fastened the rope round her unresisting 
form, placing a pillow, so that she might
not be hurt, and beckoned to the firemen below. Two
stalwart fellows understood his actions, and sprung
up the escape. The rope was not long enough to
reach more than half-way. The engines had played
all the time on the fire below.</p>

<p>Placing his feet against the wall under the window,
and letting the rope, which was knotted every three
feet, pass round one of the massive stanchions, he

<!-- vol 3 page 411 -->

wound the first few feet from her body round his
right arm, and lifted her gently over, holding her by
the portion of it twice passed round her waist as by
a cincture. If he could stand the strain at first,
there was a chance. Then he lowered her down to
where the firemen stood. They grasped her in their
sturdy arms&mdash;she was saved! saved! Then another
hearty cheer broke forth. "Brave fellow! Splendidly 
done!" But where is he? Why does he pause?
His strength, his energy is gone. He reels, falls back,
is about to swoon. There is a flask of eau-de-cologne
on the lady's toilet-table. With the instinct of self-preservation, 
he raises it to his lips, and drinks it, as
if it were a cordial. Then he looks about; he has
new life in him.</p>

<p>All this passes much more rapidly than we can
describe it. He looks out upon the surging multitude
beneath. At this moment a volume of smoke and
flame bursts out below, and conceals him from their
sight. His only chance is to reach the top of the
escape. He cannot return as he climbed up. He
could not have ascended a second time. Nor at any
time of his life could that surprising feat have been
performed by him, as it was done that one time&mdash;none 
could exactly say how. Quick as thought, he
tears the sheets off the bed and knots them together.
One end he fastens round the stanchion, and then
lowering himself, he reaches the escape. But the fire
is now furious beneath. Half-way down he is wrapt
in a sheet of flame. On fire! on fire! His hair is
plainly seen to blaze. He is lost! lost! The mob
palpitates and screams. For a moment, he appears

<!-- vol 3 page 412 -->

paralysed, scorched, shrivelled up. Then he emerges,
but how? His clothes are burning. He looses his
hold and falls. There is a mattress held up by six
or eight powerful men. They catch him on it, and
fling a blanket on him, and stifle the flames, and he
is carried, burnt and blackened, a little distance
down the street, and thence to the shop of the nearest
chemist, who has been rung open to attend to a
dozen minor sufferers half an hour ago. The lady is
in there, and the child, surrounded by half a dozen
sympathising friends. A rumour has gone forth that
she is the celebrated Italian singer, the beautiful
Bianca Stellini, who is saved with her child, and the
crowd are in transports of enthusiasm and joy.</p>

<p>"Well," quoth Mr. Stingray to Mr. Swellingham,
whom he deigned to recognise in the crowd, "if ever
I saw a lunatic in my life, it was that devil of a
ragged fellow with the long hair. Only fancy going
into a fire with hair and a beard like that. I'm glad
he has saved the finest soprano in Europe for
us; though it would have been something to have
witnessed her performance and seen her burnt in one
night, which Pepys or Horace Walpole might have
envied."</p>

<p>"Sir!" returned Swellingham, looking him in the
face, "if you address one more word to me personally, 
now or hereafter, I'll knock you down, I will
by &mdash;&mdash;!" It was as honest an oath as any that my
Uncle Toby ever swore. "You are a black-hearted
dastard, a disgrace to humanity, and a reproach to
the Society which tolerates you for your acrid pen

<!-- vol 3 page 413 -->

and your venomous tongue. Sir! which road are
you going! I wish to take an opposite one."</p>

<p>And Swellingham held up his walking-stick in a
manner which left no doubt of his intention, had he
been further provoked.</p>

<p>Mr. Stingray smiled as a hyena might smile, if the
animal found it inconvenient to laugh aloud, but he
pocketed his indignation.</p>

<p>"Brute! low beast!" he muttered, when out of
hearing. "I wonder whether the Kemble is open
yet? I'll go and be revenged on him there. I'll tell
the fellows confidentially that he wants to borrow
some money. Won't they all shun him then? Let's
see the time. Hallo! Who's stolen my watch? My
handkerchief, too, and my note-book, with my last
quarter's salary. Oh! oh! oh! Here! policeman!
I'm murdered, robbed, undone."</p>

<p>There was no policeman at hand. Mr. Stingray
therefore proceeded on his way alone. He had no
money to pay for a cab, and he was not certain that
he should find the club open. For once, he felt
what it was to be without money in the world in an
extremely modified form. Impelled by the little
pottering Nemesis which led Mr. Cousens into the
Escurial on a certain night, and is continually
dogging the footsteps of small bad men, a sort of
"Retiaria" with invisible net and trident, Mr. Stingray 
sought to get from Whitehall to the Strand by
a short cut. This led him into a lonely and deserted 
street. Suddenly, a woman came up to him,
and asked him if he was good-natured. For once

<!-- vol 3 page 414 -->

our philosopher spoke truth, in indignantly denying
the fact. The woman gave a smothered scream.
"He's insulting me!" she cried. A fellow marched
out of a shadow in front, and asked him with an oath
what he meant. Mr. Stingray was taken aback; but
he collected his energies and clearing his throat would
have called "Police!" in a tone which might have
penetrated the deepest area, and roused some Prussian-helmeted 
Mars from the blandishments of a culinary
Venus, when two more shadowy figures appeared
behind, an arm stole round the neck of our corpulent
friend, and a perfect August 10th of meteoric stars,
a shower of brilliant coruscations, rushed athwart his
vision. The thieves were disappointed. A professor
of a lighter style of art had anticipated them. But
<i>quant &agrave; ce bon Stingray</i>, serous apoplexy intervened.
A sensation, quite equal to that for which Mr. Stingray
had recently expressed a wish, gratified (?) the British
Public the next day. It was too late for the
morning papers; but it filled a column of the
"Globe," and two of the "Standard." It is an ill
wind which blows nobody good. The "Glowworm"
brought out edition after edition on the strength of
it. The little ragged urchins whom Stingray&mdash;always 
spiteful towards the poor seeking to gain an
honest living&mdash;hated so, made a copper harvest out of
him. His decease was described in the most gushing
style. When Edgar Leslie heard it, he thought he
could have spared a better man. His resentments
were not worked out as he wished they should be. He
would have liked Stingray to have lived to see him,
Edgar, a great man. When it reached Swellingham, 

<!-- vol 3 page 415 -->

he was very grave and serious, and repented
him of the bitter words he had used.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said a friend to us not very long ago,
"that I could dispense 'poetic justice' in this world!
Oh! that I were possessed of the powers of a Caliph
Haroun Alraschid for one month, one year! How I
would dissolve Parliament, change the Government,
strip a few scores of the fortunate rogues and hypocrites, 
who are the curse of dear old England, distribute 
a few colossal fortunes, rebuke and amerce
absenteeism, reform the police, nail the ears of
adulterators big and small to their palatial gates or
counters, sentence cruel and unjust magistrates to
eighteen months' imprisonment with hard labour,
turn the Serpentine through the Admiralty and
Horse Guards, shut up the music-halls, proclaim real
Free Trade and a Ballot, which honest Liberal Conservatives 
would find rather more to their interest
than would the pseudo-Liberal Old Men of the Sea
who have so long throttled the State, and treat the
lawyers after the fashion of Peter the Great! I
would play Aunt Sally to some purpose, as an honest
despot should play it, and smash every dishonest
sham, like clay-pipes in the mouths of a whole row
of grinning idols; the mouths of Routine, Hypocrisy,
Corruption, Expediency, and Betrayal, at home and
abroad. The overtaxed labourer should no longer
toil to fill a cullender with his thin and watery
blood. How I would wake up my Lord Angelos with
a block at Tower Hill! How the bow-string should
be substituted for red-tape! How I would purge the
nation of the red tape-worm of corruption and decline. 

<!-- vol 3 page 416 -->

And as for the fellow who criticised me in
the 'Centipede,' wouldn't I righteously settle him!
Probably I should condescend to execute many a
small revenge. But one thing I would promise, which
is this&mdash;I would <i>not</i> indiscriminately exalt my own
relations at the public cost. My wildest acts of despotism 
would not lead me to commit such an act.
Of that a grateful and restored nation might at
least feel sure! But Aristophanes himself, were he
alive, could not supply words to describe the violence 
and severity of my actions in the cause of
truth, patriotism, and justice, were I gifted with the
supreme power of an Eastern potentate, to deal with
the caitiffs who have depraved Society and worm-eaten 
the majesty and honour of the State."</p>

<p>How many a poor fellow has indulged in a fancy
like this! Alas! it is but the speculation of righteous
folly or of inane wisdom; the dream of an Alnaschar,
without even a basket of eggs; the aspiration of a
petty every-day Prometheus, at whose vitals any daw
can peck; but uncheered by the recollection of a
boon already bestowed on humanity, the glorious sun-rape

impotence, the luxury of impossibility accorded to
free and fetterless Thought! "But not express it!"

<p>IN the back room of the apothecary's shop lies
Aubrey, silent, but breathing. He is contused and
fearfully burnt. A medical man bends over him and
feels his pulse. It is our old friend Dr. Miller, who
had been summoned during the fire to see a patient

<!-- vol 3 page 419 -->

who had escaped from the hotel to a neighbouring
house. In the room watching him with anxiety are
Mr. Swellingham and Tops. The shop is full of
people, and among them sits Blanche waiting impatiently, 
until she may come in. The doctor has been
carefully examining his patient, and applying remedies
to his poor burnt face, arms, and hands, which had all
greatly suffered. One leg, too, was sadly burnt, the
trouser having actually been in flames. The doctor
had called for scissors and snipped away the greater
portion of the singed hair and beard.</p>

<p>At length he speaks. "Tell the lady, if she desires
it so much, that she may come in."</p>

<p>And Blanche enters, followed by Susan.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she said, "where is my preserver, 
the saviour of my child? Oh! is he much
hurt? Will he soon recover? Nay" (looking at him),
"perhaps he is already dead, self-slain for my child
and me."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself a little, madam," said Swellingham. 
"Here is the doctor. It is not so bad as you
think." (To the doctor.) "Is it, sir?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing fatal, I think, to life, madam,
and the patient will probably recover; unless the
general shock to the system be too great. You see,
he is in a very attenuated condition to offer much
resistance; not much stamina, I should say. But even
should he rally and not succumb, there is still a sad
circumstance&mdash;&mdash;" And the doctor looked grave.</p>

<p>"What! what is it? Speak! what do you mean?"
rapidly uttered Blanche.</p>

<p>"The flames have reached his hair, you see," was

<!-- vol 3 page 420 -->

the answer, "and scorched his eyes. If he should
recover, which I think he will do under careful
assiduity and treatment, he will be blind for life."</p>

<p>"Say not so!" cried Blanche. "No! not blind.
It is a fearful thing to be blind. Nay, let me see
him plainly&mdash;let me kneel by him and embrace him&mdash;this 
brave man of the people&mdash;this heroic heart, to
whom I, and one dearer to me than myself&mdash;owe life&mdash;preservation 
from so terrible a death." So saying
she approached and bent over the prostrate form of
the sufferer. "He looks very poor and thin, as if he
had wanted even food; and yet what courage and
strength!" She knelt down by the couch, and bending 
over his wasted and bandaged hand, kissed it
passionately. "Poor fellow! To be blind for me&mdash;blind! 
But I will watch over you myself. I am
rich, and will reward you. You shall never want for
anything again. Let me gaze at those disfigured
features more glorious than&mdash;&mdash;ah! what is it that
I see? It is my husband! I thought his voice was
beside me in the burning room. Arthur! Arthur!"
and with a loud shriek, to the astonishment of those
present, she fell forward fainting over the insensible
form of the sufferer.</p>

<p>For a moment, all stood still. Then the doctor
raised her gently. "She ought not to have come
in," he said. "The fright and exertion have been
too much for her, and the sight of this poor man has
finished it. This may be serious, I fear, for the brain.
Carry her into the next room, and I will see what
can be done. Where is she staying for the night?"</p>

<p>But Tops, as soon as she was removed from the

<!-- vol 3 page 421 -->

couch, stepped forward, his face pale with emotion,
and tenderly lifting aside the burnt and straggling
locks, looked at him long and earnestly. "It's him!"
he cried at last. "It's my dear old master, Arthur
Aubrey, Esquire. She knew him right enough. Here,
Susan, Susan, here!" And Mr. Tops began to sob
like a great girl. "Here I've got his fortin back for
him, and he won't be able to see to drive his pheayton,
nor to choose a 'oss agen."</p>

<p>"What's this I hear? What do you say?" said
the doctor, who had been told the strange corroboration 
by Swellingham, who had stolen into the other
room.</p>

<p>"Hum!" he said. "Truth is stranger than fiction.
This alters the case. I feared a worse catastrophe than
all. But it appears the poor lady has found her lost
husband in this heroic outcast. And she, too, is an
old patient of mine. It wouldn't be believed in a
novel; though your modern writers are more unreal
when they approach truth, than when they utterly
eschew it. The critics would be down upon it. 'Eyes
in and eyes out!' " muttered the worthy man. "It's
strange enough for a sensational play."</p>

<p>Whilst he was talking thus, the good doctor was
busying himself between his two patients. "We
must have them removed," he said. "Man and wife!
They ought, and ought not to be together; but I suppose 
the feelings of both parties must be consulted.
Hallo! Whom have we here?"</p>

<p>A female figure had been added to the group, to
use an expression <i>&agrave; la</i> Tussaud, and presently, too, a
gentleman entered the room.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 422 -->

<p>The lady was exquisitely attired. She had been at
the Opera that night; and had not retired to bed,
when a gentleman, who was no other than Sir Harry
Luckless, came and summoned her, to the great
scandal of the neighbourhood, to tell her of the
fire.</p>

<p>"So you see what she is, after all!" said a lady of
irreproachable fame, who constantly deceived her
husband, and who lived in the opposite house, with a
white stuccoed front&mdash;we mean the house, and not
the lady.</p>

<p>"There's piety for you!" said Betty, cook-maid
next door, to John, footman. "I always suspex
them folks as is too good to live, to be no better than
they should be. Did you see her fal-lals? And she
preached to me only yesterday about throwing my
scraps into the dust-hole, when there's so many
nasty poor about. Set her up, indeed! I shall tell
her a bit of my mind the next time she talks to me&mdash;the 
howdacious, himparent minx. Jest see if I
don't."</p>

<p>It was a strange hour for such gossip, but, as we
said, all London does not slumber even at half-past
two A.M. Under Kitty's tender assiduities, Blanche
soon came to herself. It seemed fated that the latter
should regain life and bloom under the former's
care.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor came in from the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>"Now, take this restorative, dear lady," he said;
"and then I think I must transform you from patient
into nurse. The&mdash;the&mdash;noble fellow whom you have

<!-- vol 3 page 423 -->

so strangely recognised is, I think, conscious, and I
want to try the effect of your voice upon him."</p>

<p>They entered, and approached Aubrey's side.</p>

<p>"To find him thus!" said Blanche. "Him, whom
so soon as my success was established I had determined 
to seek out, if living, even to the uttermost
parts of the earth. Oh! madam, my dear benefactress! 
Look!" (to Kitty). " 'Tis my own Arthur,
my husband, who has saved me, and at what a cost!
Doctor! doctor! he will not die, will he?"</p>

<p>"Nay, madam, I trust&mdash;I may say, I believe not,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"He has saved our child, saved me, who left him
so long to perish with hunger, and cold, and the
pangs of desertion, and at what a cost! His poor
dear eyes! his sight is gone! Blind! blind!&mdash;and
for me, who know so well what it is to be blind!"</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" cried Kitty, "can it be?
What retributive justice is here? But he may be,
will be, restored to peace and happiness yet."</p>

<p>"Arthur! dearest Arthur!" cried Blanche, "do
you not know me, your own wife, Blanche?"</p>

<p>"What voice was that?" said the prostrate man,
trembling in every limb. "Whose form is it at
yonder window? No matter. 'Tis a woman; I will
save her! My life is forfeit, I tell you. I wish to
die. Loose me, I say!" He paused, and then, after
awhile, continued: "I remember now. 'Tis all over,
I saw her saved&mdash;saved! I thought I heard <i>her</i> voice
call me in a dream. There are voices round me now.
Take this veil off from my eyes. I am awake, and
cannot see!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 424 -->

<p>"Speak to him, madam," said the doctor, "and
apprise him gently of the truth."</p>

<p>"Arthur, dearest Arthur, you do not dream. You
have saved me, Blanche, your wife, from a dreadful
death. I was not drowned, as you thought. I was
stopping at the hotel when it took fire, and you
saved our child, and myself, but at what a cost!
No, no! I cannot tell him. Doctor, doctor! speak!"</p>

<p>"Our <i>child!</i> Blanche alive?" muttered Aubrey.
"Great God! This is madness, and death!"</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear sir," said the doctor, taking his
hand and pressing it gently where it was uninjured,
"and I beseech you be calm. I am Dr. Miller, a
physician. To-night you ascended a ladder, did you
not, and saved a woman and child from imminent
peril? By a wonderful blessing of Providence that
woman is your wife, whom you supposed to have
been drowned years ago. Well, she was not drowned,
and has become a great singer. She had a child born
to you shortly after she left your home. Her reputation 
is as white as snow," added the doctor, getting
poetical, and yet taking a matter-of-fact view as to
the strangeness of the announcement. "We must
get you well, my dear sir! You have been sadly,
sadly burnt, and I much fear that&mdash;that your eyesight 
is deeply injured; in fact, that you will not be
able to see again&mdash;at least for a very long time,"
added the prudent and kindly doctor&mdash;"a very long
time indeed. But we'll do all that can be done. And
now you must be very quiet."</p>

<p>"Blanche! Blanche!" said the sufferer, "saved,
and by me? Yes, now I recollect the fire, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 425 -->

giddy height, and the shouting, and the eager upturned 
faces of the crowd. Then why did I not
perish in the scorching flames, when I had saved her?
I had nothing more to live for, save to see her once,
once more, and then die. And now she is here,
you say, and I cannot see her. And she is not
injured&mdash;not hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, Arthur!" she replied, "but lives to devote
her whole life to you, to renounce the hollow triumphs
of the stage, to live for you, sing to you, you alone&mdash;never 
to leave you again&mdash;never, never!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," resumed Aubrey; "for my head seems
confused with joy&mdash;and the terrible maddening pain&mdash;did 
not some one tell me of a child&mdash;a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried Blanche, "you have a son,
born after&mdash;we parted; he is the image of you,
dearest&mdash;is he not?" And she looked round, as if
for corroboration as to the fact.</p>

<p>"I can answer for that," said Tops. "He's as
like Mr. Arthur as two peas, that is, a small pea to a
big one."</p>

<p>"Tell me his name!" said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Arthur!" replied the mother. "What should
he be called but that? And now, dearest, compose
yourself for my sake, and we will never, never part
for a single day again."</p>

<p>"It cannot be," he answered. "I am a beggar, an
outcast. Do not touch my rags!" he said, almost
fiercely. "I will never be a dependent upon the
bounty of one whom my cruel selfishness drove forth
upon the world. I have only repaired half the wrong.
We are not equal yet; for I destroyed happiness

<!-- vol 3 page 426 -->

first. I will die fifty deaths, ere I will cast a shadow
over the career of her whom I have wronged, or
accept more than forgiveness at her hands. But bring
me my boy, that I may kiss him once ere I die.
He need not know who it is. You can make the
room dark if you like, if I am something very terrible
to see."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, my dear sir!" said the
doctor. "I can't allow this sort of thing. The child
is asleep in his cot in another house. You shall see
him&mdash;that is, I mean he shall be brought the first
thing in the morning, shall he not, madam? And
now you must take a little soothing draught. It is
absolutely necessary, my dear sir."</p>

<p>The patient shook his head feebly, and turned it
slightly away.</p>

<p>"Mr. Aubrey, sir, master!" broke in Tops, suddenly. 
"I'm Tops, your old groom, sir, if you
please. You ain't dependint upon no one, sir. You're
richer than ever you was. We got a new will, as
your father, old Mr. Aubrey made, as nobody knew
nothing whatsumever about. Here, Susan, just do
tell all about it. You're ready enough to speak
sometimes. You can do it better than me. Hexplain, 
will yer, if you don't speak another word afore
marridge." And he dragged Susan forward.</p>

<p>"It's true, indeed, sir, what he says," said that
young person. "My poor stupid Tops here has recovered 
another will&mdash;a codicil, I think they call it&mdash;of 
your father's, carried off by a man named Manvers,
who shot at Tops, and got killed himself this very

<!-- vol 3 page 427 -->

evening instead, only there was no bullet in the
pistol."</p>

<p>"Do hold your noise," said the brave but ungallant 
Tops. "I've seen a lieyer, sir, in the Temple,
and he said, if the will was found, leaving everything 
unconditional to you, you'd be richer than
ever; and we was going to hadvertise for you to-morrow, 
sir, in Austrely; for the will is found, and
it do leave everythink unconditional, as the lieyer
said."</p>

<p>The patient's lips quivered in prayer&mdash;a prayer of
thanksgiving, it seemed; from a whisper or two
which reached the listeners' ears. One large tear
rolled slowly from the darkened orbit of a single eye
into the hollow of his cheek, and there it might have
remained glistening for some time had not Blanche
knelt down and kissed it away with a kiss of love and
hope, and soft and gentle ruth.</p>

<p>Then they all stole out of the room without a word,
and shut the folded doors upon that second marriage,
this time ordained of Heaven. Only the doctor ventured 
to stoop and whisper as he passed: "Not too
long, madam, if you please&mdash;not too long!" And
he held out the phial with the opiate with a meaning
gesture.</p>

<p>Let us, too, leave them to themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>BACK to Queen's-square, not in the old house, but
one not far from it. Arthur Aubrey is again lying
on a sofa, his arm clasped round his little boy. He is
still disfigured, but not so painfully. His countenance
expresses content, nay, happiness; as much happiness,
perhaps, as grown-up men and women ever feel.
Only children in good health are ever really quite
happy. Blanche is reading the newspaper to him, a
wonderfully eloquent and philosophical article on an
accident in a thunder-storm, ending with the broad
propositions that we are all mortal, that we are
seldom killed by lightning, and that the parties killed
could not have had the slightest notion of what was
going to happen to them, when they got up that

<!-- vol 3 page 429 -->

morning to go to a picnic under a cloudless sky. The
first part of the article was learning and Lempri&egrave;re,
the second illustration and the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, 
and the third the <i>reductio ad nihilum</i>, which
best befits such productions. Such articles won't do
for reading to the blind, when words are weighed and
meaning pondered on. They do for the busy eye
rapidly to skim over, conveying no distinct purport
to the mind, and leaving no clear impression on the
brain.</p>

<p>"They are late, dear," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>Some friends were evidently expected. Presently
there came a knock at the street door.</p>

<p>"It is Sir Harry," said Blanche. "I can tell,
because it is such a nervous knock. Poor fellow! I
hope he will not be disappointed. They would make
a very happy couple, I am sure; especially if they
lived abroad. Sir Harry is bent, as you know, upon
going to Canada or Vancouver's Island. He says he
don't much care which."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine" said Aubrey, "how she can
hesitate for a moment to accept his offer, attached to
each other as they are."</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Luckless!" said a maid-servant, opening 
the door.</p>

<p>Sir Harry came in with the air of a man who is in
a nervous flurry, and who would certainly cut himself, 
if he attempted to shave, or spill the boiling
water, if he sought to replenish the teapot.</p>

<p>"Well, Aubrey, my dear fellow, how are you? I
beg pardon, Mrs. Aubrey, I am delighted to see you.
How is your dear little girl? Excuse me, I mean

<!-- vol 3 page 430 -->

boy. Ha! ha! I was thinking of one of Kitty's&mdash;that 
is, Mrs. Wilmington's&mdash;little pets&mdash;to be sure,
yes."</p>

<p>And with this speech Sir Harry sat down; and
then added that it was a very fine day, which, considering 
there was an east wind, drizzling rain, and
fog, was not exactly the case.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wilmington has not been here yet, I suppose?" 
said Sir Harry, after a pause.</p>

<p>"No, she has not. I expect her, however, very
shortly."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;that is, you&mdash;are aware&mdash;that is, I wish to
inform yon, and&mdash;to ask a little favour. Would you
mind, Aubrey, if I speak with your wife alone just
two minutes in the next room? It's something very
important. I don't mind telling you afterwards, if
Mrs. Aubrey will permit, and will leave us for two
minutes together, when I've told her; but I can't
speak to you both at once about it."</p>

<p>"Not even when the two are one?" asked Blanche,
smiling.</p>

<p>"There, get along with you. I know what it is all
about. I shan't be jealous," said Aubrey, playing
with his boy's curls.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Mrs. Aubrey," began Sir Harry,
when the folding doors were closed, "I want you to
plead my cause. There is no one can do it but you,
and your lightest wish has an immense weight with
Kitty&mdash;I mean Mrs. Wilmington. Tell her that it is
no use going on in this way, and that it's no good
breaking a fellow's heart. I'm going off very soon.
I've sold everything I don't want. I've got a hundred

<!-- vol 3 page 431 -->

labourers from Waterford, and chartered a steamer.
It's a perfect Noah's Ark, and I've got such an
assortment of agricultural implements, as never were
seen together before out of a show. There's spades,
rakes, and hoes enough to make a second Garden of
Eden. And if she must teach children their catechism, 
and all that sort of thing, there's plenty
among the labourers' families to keep her hand in. I
refused one fellow with eleven, five boys and six
girls; but I'll take 'em all to please Kitty, if she'll
only share a poor emigrant's lot. As for her money,
she's always giving it away. Well, what's more easy
than to settle it all right off on half a dozen institutions? 
Do, Mrs. Aubrey, persuade her to be my
wife. I have loved her, as you know, long and earnestly, 
and I shall never care for any one else."</p>

<p>Sir Harry, whose voice more than once faltered in
this semi-comic appeal, here came to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir Harry," said Blanche, "you have
my best, my warmest wishes. I believe you are both
much attached to each other; and for my part I can
see no obstacle to your happiness, save our dear
friend's religious exaltation, and some notions which
she has got into her very obstinate little head. But,
depend upon it, nothing shall be wanting on my
part."</p>

<p>"Tell her that she has almost promised me," resumed 
Sir Harry; "tell her that it is positively
wicked to refuse; tell her that I would go to the
ends of the earth with her, but that I have not the
heart or courage to go anywhere and leave her behind.
Just see what a fix I am in! Here I stand pledged

<!-- vol 3 page 432 -->

to all these poor people to take them to America. I
did it, Mrs. Aubrey, I pledge you my word, thinking
that, after all that has passed, she must and would
come with us. And she shakes her head and says,
mournfully, 'No, Harry, no! It would not be acting
in accordance with my duty towards you, whom I
esteem, love, if you will have it so, better than any
one in the world, not to speak of my duty towards
others.' What others? And as for me, it's like
killing a man to save his life. I'll tell you what, it's
cruel, that's what it is, neither more nor less."</p>

<p>"Rely upon my best efforts, Sir Harry. Stop!
There's a ring at the visitors' bell. There she is.
Had I not better see her first? Go in to Arthur.
The ship sails on the twentieth, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sir Harry. "I was going to ask
Aubrey to bring you on board. I should like you to
see the arrangements; but I have no heart for it,
while this doubt remains."</p>

<p>So saying, he pressed her hand with fervour and
joined Aubrey in the next room, to whom he narrated
all that he had been saying to Blanche.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington entered the room where Blanche
was sitting the instant after Sir Harry had left. The
latter rose, pressed her hand, kissed her, and led her
to a seat. "My dear, dear preserver!" she said. An
entire confidence had been established between those
two beings, whose early lives and surroundings had
been so chequered and so different. Mrs. Wilmington
had broadly sketched her early life to Blanche, her
meeting with Aubrey and with Lord Egbert; the
effect which her interview with Blanche, after the

<!-- vol 3 page 433 -->

rescue of the latter, had upon her, when she found
herself painted in such dark colours by one for whose
smile and good word she would have given so much.
She told Blanche of the, in her instance, harmless
munificence of the Duke of Chalkstoneville, to whom
she had been a nurse and companion in his later days.
She had already spoken of that which Blanche knew
well. Sir Harry's reciprocated attachment. Then
Blanche had pleaded his suit for him in vain, and she
now prosecuted it with still greater fervour. It was
still in vain. With her hand pressed upon her heart,
with pale and quivering lips, but without a tear, Kate
Darrell gently but firmly continued to reject Sir
Harry's hand.</p>

<p>"No!" she said. "I love him, I will not disavow
it; but I love him too dearly to bring disgrace on his
name. I love him too dearly to risk even a momentary
repentance, a doubt whether he had done well to
marry me, which might some day occur to him, and
which would wreck my peace of mind, leaving me
then nothing to fall back upon and cling to for support. 
Besides, I have duties to perform, atonement
to make to Heaven. Let him seek other climes. He
has thrown away his opportunities, led a useless life
here. He will go out bravely, and forget his folly
with regard to me in the demands and interests of
the young community which will look to him as its
head. Dear lady! my mind is made up. Let me
go. Let me pass away from among you like a
shadow; let me be only a human being with a heart
living among those who need my aid. He is one, and
they are many. He will find a partner in life with

<!-- vol 3 page 434 -->

no guilty remembrances of the past to cause a pang or
shudder to either, when the Sabbath bells ring pleasantly 
in the summer air, or when some one names a
creature of sin and shame in a too conscious or sensitive 
ear. It is no use. I would it were otherwise;
but I have thought it all over, and my mind is made
up.</p>

<p>In vain did Blanche argue, reason, and entreat her
to reconsider her decision. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Do you know that he is here; that he wishes to
see you before he sails; that he is even now in the
next room? At least you will see him, will you
not?"</p>

<p>The face of Mrs. Wilmington assumed a strange
appearance. It became marble in hue and in line.
Her features actually appeared to grow rigid and
thin.</p>

<p>"I will see him, of course I will," she said, "once
more; and then it is fitting that we part and for ever.
In a very brief time, I shall have ceased to dwell in
his thoughts; but be a visitant occasionally when his
memory shall revert to his former associates as to
beings of another sphere. It is oftener so, I think,
with those who go away than those who remain. But
every day whilst I live, I shall remember him in my
prayers."</p>

<p>Blanche was sadly grieved; but she felt that it was
useless, and that she could do no more. So she
opened the door and beckoned Sir Harry in.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! he did not look like a man about to
succeed in his wishes. He walked up to Kitty, and
took her by the hand.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 435 -->

<p>"I suppose," lie said, "that Mrs. Aubrey has told
you that I am going to leave England, and probably
for ever, next week. My happiness, going or staying, 
depends upon one little word from your lips.
If you will marry me, I will either go or not, as you
please. But I have heard you say you would prefer
an entire change of scene. Tell me, Kitty, will you
make a poor fellow happy, and go with me? I am lost
without you. I never loved any one, save you."</p>

<p>"Dear Sir Harry," replied Kitty, "I will not
disguise from you, that you are not, and never were,
indifferent to me; and there was a time when, had
you spoken as you have now, my heart would have
leapt with joy. But the time has gone by for such a
thing. I see my duty clearer now. I <i>cannot</i> be your
wife."</p>

<p>"Kitty, dear Kitty!" persisted her suitor, "do
not be so cruel as to leave me alone in the world, and
to bury yourself alive in some dreadful place. Look
here! give all your money to some excellent charity
at once. I have enough for us both. As for my
title, if that annoys you, I will drop it. Let my
brother take it, if he likes, but don't abandon me,
Kitty! Be my wife, my own dear, dear wife, I
implore you!"</p>

<p>And Sir Harry covered his face with his hands,
awaiting a reply.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," said Mrs. Aubrey, "to whom I
owe life and happiness, the heart of my husband&mdash;all, 
all that I can call mine, may I add my prayers
to his? Let this union complete our joy, and do not
wreck the hopes of one who will devote all his future

<!-- vol 3 page 436 -->

life, to insure your happiness and remove the thorns
from your path. Come, let me join your hands
together with your hearts."</p>

<p>"Lady," replied Kitty, "it cannot be. I love
him too well to forget myself. He will learn to
forget me in a little time; and then some bright and
good woman will bestow on him her love, and that
serenity of affection unknown to such as I have been,
will bless him as he deserves. Do not think me ungrateful, 
not to obey your lightest wish; for if you
owe me some earthly gifts, what do I not owe to
you? The first utterings of the soul, the ecstatic joy
alone felt in doing good. Do not think this refusal
costs me nothing, for I love him&mdash;love him dearly;
have loved him, long before all this. I dare not speak
to him more; but tell him, tell him, that I will not
ally him with shame, although the bitterness of that
shame is past. Tell him that if we fled to some
foreign land, and that if he gave up for me his birth-right 
and his name, we might still not be happy.
Tell him that if he soothed me with too eager tenderness, 
I should think that he remembered the past.
Tell him that if, without meaning it, he neglected
me ever so little, I should leave him that instant or
die."</p>

<p>Much more was said by all three; but Kitty's
resolution remained unchanged. At length, Arthur
Aubrey was called in; but he only said how dearly
he wished such an union to take place, and shrank
from pressing it on Kitty as strongly as his wife. It
may be that he did not think it of any use, or perhaps
he did not like to assume any responsibility. At

<!-- vol 3 page 437 -->

length, Sir Harry took his departure, merely pressing
Kitty's hand, and giving her a look much resembling
that in the picture of the "Last Appeal." All that
Blanche could extract from Kitty was, that she would
write to her after reconsidering Sir Harry's offer,
within the next two or three days. She did write,
and the following is an extract from her letter:</p>

<br/>

<p>"I cannot alter my decision; though it wring my
heart, it will not break his. I know his disposition,
and the hearts of men do not easily give way. I
have a mission to perform, high and holy if accomplished 
by the pure and good, a simple duty of atonement 
at my hands. And now farewell for ever! And
haply if there be some who, for my sake, may hereafter 
think less harshly of sisters nursed in sin and
reared in sorrow, and driven by hopeless penury to
do wrong, those whose hearts Nature never fashioned
for their dreadful career, but whom Society, in her
dainty and exclusive programme, forgot; deserted,
like the cruellest of stepmothers, even when they
were little innocent children with sunshine playing in
their golden hair, leaving them to wander amid the
pitfalls of this dreary wilderness alone; if, warned
by me, some of the great and powerful of my own
sex think how they might have acted, had they been
similarly exposed, and are led to acknowledge the
universal bond of relationship that exists amongst
all, where one touch of nature still lingers in the
heart, then will my sacrifice not be in vain, my mission 
not wholly lost. Let only a larger and more
comprehensive system of charity commence, and oh,

<!-- vol 3 page 438 -->

what a tide of reproach may yet be rolled back from
England!</p>

<p>"Let not yon poor creature avert her face in the
hatred of desperation, or in the darkness of the more
welcome grave! Give work, give homes, give bread,
but give also your hearts to the task; and, above all,
banish from the sacred altar of church and dwelling
him of the double face and forked tongue,&mdash;the liar
and seducer, for they are one. <i>His</i> 'honour'? <i>His</i>
'word'? Trust him not, friend or associate; for he
would deceive men, if he dared. Believe not in his
reform. His victims may be purified, he cannot.
They are the ghosts of his sins that flit in your streets
at eventide and haunt your thoroughfares by night.
Drive him from your presence, or you become
partners in his guilt: let not his wealth or title atone
for the insult he offers when he approaches you,
deeming that he leaves his other existence behind,
as he would change his dress, or cast his skin with
the snake."</p>

<br/>

<p>To which we say heartily "Amen!"</p>

<p>And thou, we add, woman, or whatever else thou
shouldst be called, who hast sold thyself respectably,
and in the name of "wife," either for rank or money,
to a man whom thou likest not, and hast done it in
all the indecency of broad day, ere the hour of noon,
in the open shame and coarseness of huge bouquets
and favours borne by coachmen and flunkies before
the gaping, gazing crowd, with the gewgaws and the
lace-trimmed dresses for night and day wear, called
a "trousseau," paraded and catalogued even in the

<!-- vol 3 page 439 -->

newspapers, behold! is not the mother who assisted
in thy sale a worse harridan than any of the looser
class; because thou art her daughter, her own flesh
and blood? And what art thou? Worse, worse
than any flaunting creature thou shalt meet with in
Regent-street at eve, or under the lamps of the Haymarket 
by night; worse, because many of these were
betrayed by their confiding hearts, and many were
never taught any honest or saving thing in their
lives; worse, because most of these have sinned&mdash;if, 
in comparison with thee, they have sinned at all&mdash;from 
want and overtoil, from lack of kind words,
shelter, and bread; worse, because they have been
deceived, tempted, sinned against, driven to pollution, 
and thou hast not; worse, by all that Providence, 
and culture, and education have given thee,
and all that thy sister has been denied in this her
life, by civilisation, humanity, and Heaven in its
inscrutable ways.</p>

<p>Remember that Christ Himself forgave the woman
taken in adultery, and said unto her, "Go, and sin
no more;" but that Sapphira was stricken with death
for the utterance of a venal lie&mdash;a lie which thou
hast, in thy respectability, far exceeded at the altar
of the Most High in His temple on the most sacred
occasion of thy feminine life, when thou soldest thyself 
as a beast to the best bidder; soldest thy blushes,
or thy pale languor to a stranger, or a mere acquaintance, 
more odious for thy previous knowledge
of him; soldest thy bloom of maiden modesty, the
fragrance of thy virgin breast, as a Madame Rachel
may henceforth sell thee her enamel for a price. Go

<!-- vol 3 page 440 -->

to! thou art worse than they whose shrieks of forced
laughter curdle the midnight air of this great traffic
mart of unholy desires; for they, perchance, had no
choice, and to what base use hast thou not surrendered 
thyself?</p>

<p>Will Kitty ever alter her decision and join Sir
Harry Luckless, who changed his name to Mr. Wilmington 
<i>en voyage</i> to the new and distant community 
of which he is the most useful, energetic, and
respected member? We cannot say. All that we
can answer for is, that she has bound herself by no
formal and religious vows, and that at present she is
untiring in her good works. Sir Harry&mdash;artful fellow&mdash;has 
represented in a letter to Blanche that there
is great want of spiritual instruction, and of a species
of good angel in his part of the world&mdash;in fact, that a
schoolmistress is much needed of a very superior
kind to train up the infant community, of which he
is chief representative, in the way it should go. Of
the importance of this to a future great branch of
the Anglo-Saxon (Celtic?) race about to be grafted
in the fertile and thriving township of Wilmington,
he says that any just and sufficient estimation can
scarcely be formed&mdash;a view which Blanche Aubrey
so thoroughly shared, when she heard of the above
need, want, and spiritual destitution, that she has
written a long letter thereon to Kitty, in which the
matter is most admirably and exhaustively set forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinderby never quite recovered from the
fright and shock he received on the day he was nailed
up in Webb's Fields, followed as it was by the news

<!-- vol 3 page 441 -->

of the terrible death of Manvers. For long he did
not know how far he might be compromised, and his
iniquity punished and made public. But he is reconciled 
to his son, and has shown such symptoms of
repentance and amendment as an old lawyer may.</p>

<p>Manvers being dead, the matter fell entirely into
the hands of Arthur Aubrey, who had no desire to
prosecute, even had his hands not been tied by his
regard and friendship for Edgar Leslie, who, with
his charming wife, became the constant companions
of the Aubreys. As for the latter poor folks, they
are quite "out of Society;" but it is their own
choice. Arthur is writing a romance founded upon
his experience, from which great things are expected. 
He has already had a play produced with
extraordinary success. It was one formerly rejected
by three or four London managers, but he is now
rich and independent. The critics declared that some
of his situations, and much even of the language of
his piece, had already appeared in a dramatic form
on the stage; which was unquestionably true, seeing
how much had been stolen from him! But he
managed to get over that, and to prove his priority
of authorship, to the great disgust of some of the
pirate fraternity of playwrights. Blanche, when she
can spare time from the nursery, is his eager and
favourite amanuensis; but Aubrey has no difficulty
in that respect, as he can afford a private secretary,
who is no other than the sobered and remorseful
Snap, whom Leslie stumbled on in a starving condition 
soon after the break up of Mr. Grinderby's law
establishment.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 442 -->

Blanche, we need hardly state, left the stage, to
the great sorrow of the musical world. She has only
sung in public, since her reunion with Aubrey, at a
few concerts for charitable purposes.</p>

<p>Tops and Susan are married, and live with Mr.
and Mrs. Aubrey. As they are likely to have a
family, they are about to live on Aubrey's estate,
where Tops will chiefly devote himself to the management 
of a small grass farm and the breeding of horses.</p>

<p>And the Downy&mdash;what has become of an individual 
so difficult to provide for? He is made rich
with a small annuity, and is the oracle of a club of
working men. He has gone into a business, which,
as he says, can't hurt him much; if there is no fear,
on the other hand, of his making a rapid fortune by
it. He has become a bird-fancier and seller, and
keeps a shop near the Seven Dials, where he has
really got a very good connexion, owing to his unvarying 
integrity, quaint sayings, and facetious
manners. He is great in fowls, pigeons, bullfinches,
and canaries, and is an authority on terriers. His
dogs have the reputation of being some of the cleverest
ever known.</p>

<p>"A dorg," he was heard to say lately to a young
gentleman, who thought to take a rise out of him,
"is a hanimal as wants a sight of drorin' out, afore
he shows wot's in him, and them as belongs to dorgs
must show theirselves worthy of a dorg's confidinse,
afore they can fetch hout the kevallities as is in dorgs.
There's some men as wouldn't find hout wot's in a
dorg, no, not if they was to be left alone vith vun on
a dissolute hisland. Instink? Yes, you can call it

<!-- vol 3 page 443 -->

instink if yer like. In corse, a dorg can't discount a
bill any more than he can git a friend to put his name
to vun. You'd like vun as could discount. I believe
yer&mdash;so'd a many as I knows of. Ven I've picked
up vun of that sort, I'll drop yer a line immediate.
Now 'ere's a little bitch as discounts rats howdacious&mdash;as 
game a little thing as ever you clapped heyes on.
Thank yer, yer don't vant a dorg this mornin'. Bless
yer, I knew that afore yer spoke. You vanted a bit
of chaff with the Downy&mdash;felt yer hedication had
been neglected, and that yer wosn't vide avake.
'Dorgmatic' am I? That's a vord I don't understand. 
I'm kvite ready to larn hany thing you'll
teach me, and make a swop vith yer, as'll benefit both
parties&mdash;kimmon sense and good manners agen hard
vurds. You don't know wot the bull said to the
butcher ven he torsed him in the china-shop? He
said 'You've more vit than beauty.' What else did
he say? Vy, that he didn't mean it anyvays as a
compliment, and hoffered to torse him agen for the
dammidges to the crockery. Yer didn't mean to
aggerawate me? Of course not. You're green
enough, but not kvite so green as that comes to
neither. That vould be a hact of sooicide, young
feller. And wot's more, you've kep' yer honnerabel
intention; for yer ain't done it. Is that bird a
moultin'? Yes, it air a moultin', and, wot's more,
it'll come out a beauty, and no mistake, afore long.
You thought it was dyin', did yer? Vell, it's werry
hexcusable as you should make that mistake. Did
yer never hear tell of human beins a moultin'? I've
seen a precious sight of 'em go throught it, and some

<!-- vol 3 page 444 -->

as never did get through it at hall. I was a moultin'
myself all my life, till I come here. Wot's human
moultin'? Vy, poverty, to be sure. I said your
hedication were neglected. I see a director of a
bank in a moultin' state yesterday. He hadn't a
feather left as I could diskiver, and, wot's more, he
ain't likely to, neither. He was a prime cock canary
vunce, as far as feathers vent. Birds is different
from men? Yes, but there's a few pints of resemblance 
atween 'em for all that. Ven a bird's
moultin', t'other birds pick at him wicious, yer see.
So do human beins. That's human natur' and bird
natur' safe. And, wot's more, there's a Prowidinse
as looks arter sparrers, ain't ther'? In course there
is. And the topmost bird he gits knocked hoff his
perch occasionally, don't he? And they all hops the
twig some time or other, don't 'em? And there's
goldfinches, and titmouses, and pigeons, and butcher-birds, 
and heagles, and hawks, and crows, ain't
there? And wot d'ye s'pose the last two is? Vy,
the lieyers and the parsons, to be sure. I'm a field-officer, 
am I? Vell, I gets my livin' in the fields,
more or less. Vot bird do I think you resembles?
Vy, you vanted to be a chaffinch ven you come here.
Wot do I think you're like now? You mightn't
think it polite, if I wos to tell yer. I'm to fire away,
all right, am I? Vell, I think yer'd win the first
prize at a goose-club. Wot's that? You think I'm
as imperent as a Londing sparrer? Praps you've
hit the mark this time. A sparrer as has sparred
agin time and trouble, and cherruped in all vethers,
vet or dry, cold or brilin'&mdash;a sparrer spared through

<!-- vol 3 page 445 -->

many a row to find friends and good fortin. And,
wot's more," said the Downy, getting excited by his
own fancy, "as queer a bird as you'll, maybe, find
in a long mornin's valk, master! but vun as has
never lost his faith in human natur' or larned to hate
his feller-creturs, on account of their hevil vays
towards the poor and 'umble&mdash;the coves and covesses
as can't help it, and is dust-blind vith grief and
troubbel, as the hupper classes is short-sighted vith
their hown crinksequential selfishness. And if yer
vant to know the reason, it's acos I never felt werry
spiteful myself, and I knowed there must be a many
a sight better nor me, if I could honly come across
'em. And, wot's more, I never lost my faith in
Him," said the Downy, taking off his dirty cloth cap
(for he still wore one), "as made human natur' wot
it is, and rich and poor alike, and hall seasons and
vethers. And now, as you've hintimated that you've
honly come for chaff, and don't vant neither a rat tan
terrier, as can do all but cipher, nor a bullfinch, as
can pipe 'God Save the Prince o' Wales' and 'Rule
Brightanier,' I don't mind standin' harf a pint and
drinkin' tervords yer himprovement in great hintillectual 
sci-intses of bird-fancyin' and dorg natur'.
It's my hopinion," quoth the Downy, "and I've seen
a fairish few in my time, that in this 'ere life you'll
find most good vere you least expex it."</p>
