<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>EARLY one autumn morning, on his forty-first
birthday, Argus Gates walked down the old
turfy lawn, and felt immortal in his human powers.
The elms above him dropped warning leaves, the
silver cobwebs in the grass vanished beneath his
tread, and the sere grass rose not again; but Aurora
was in the sky. The stalwart, willing earth dipped
beneath her chariot wheels, to lave in the rays
flooding from those eyes fixed in</p>

<div class="center">

"The ever silent spaces of the East,"

</div>

<p>and Argus was one with the earth.</p>

<p>The balm of fading leaves distilled in the globed
dew, the soft, moveless shadow of every object
round him, the verdure tinged with the hues
of autumn, the red light spreading over him, played
upon his sensibilities, which were those of a fine
and well-endowed animal; but his imagination was
not touched, nor his heart elevated. Perhaps he
was devoid of both. He went down the steps planted
in front of the bank, and looked over the gate
into the road some feet below. At that moment a
man passed, who, happening to raise his eyes, met
those of Argus; he halted, and pushing back his
tarpaulin, said, in a cheerful voice:</p>

<p>"Mornin' air agrees with you, Capen."</p>

<p>Argus nodded but made no reply, and continued
to swing his cane over the railing.</p>

<p>"Harbor's smooth as a pike pond, but you
don't venture on't, no right to&mdash;shut off from a
sight on't, walled in, and fenced in, and treed in.
Did the town gully down the end of the street to
please you? Why don't it pull down old Freeman's
warehouse between you and the quay, and you pull
down that mess of mortar against it? Your folks
might like a sight of the salt water, and they'd
get it by&mdash;going up stairs."</p>

<p>"Keep the salt water for yourself. Mat," answered
the captain at last, "and go down the gully as the
town directs, unless you had rather climb King's
Hill, and roll over the plantain beds, to get to your
stevedoring."</p>

<p>"I've got a chance on the Lucindy. What do
you think of that ere craft? Arter she's caulked, I
think I'll retire too." But Argus had disappeared,
and Mat's eyes could not follow him an inch beyond
the gate, even from the masts of the Lucinda, which
lay alongside the quay, a few rods from the house;
the roof and the tree-tops were all he could see.</p>

<p>Argus paused beneath one of the elms, and peered
into its branches; the birds whose departure he
was watching had gone; no twitter escaped from
the rough nests adorned with ribbons of seaweed.
Slightly musing on the probability of the return of
the same family in spring, he slowly mounted the
porch steps. As he went into the house the goddess
of the morning disappeared, amidst the clatter
of the small demons which preside over domestic
affairs, and like the chameleon take the hue of those
who compel their service. Simultaneously with
opening the door of the kitchen,&mdash;a barn-like
apartment&mdash;Roxalana, his sister-in-law, drawled in
a fine, singularly unimpassioned voice:</p>

<p>"I am about out of the suds, Argus. Your coffee
waits by the fire, clear as crystal, but my
Johnny-cake is burnt. It is impossible for me to
say where Tempe* is. She pretended that our clock
was wrong, and said she would find the right time.
With this excuse she managed to get out by six
o'clock. Wash-day has no particular charm for her."</p>

<p>*<i>[Transcriber's Note:  "Tempe" is short for "Temple" and should be
pronounced "Temp" rather than "Temp-ee."]</i></p>

<p>"Nor for you, I judge," he replied, seating himself
at a small table between the windows. She
swung round slowly, and lifted her head,&mdash;a strange
one, ringed with a mass of dense black hair&mdash;passed
her hands up and down her bare, well-shaped arms,
shook the skirt of her ragged gown, and said:</p>

<p>"Naturally, I am lazy; necessity only drives me
to industry."</p>

<p>Taking the coffee from the fire, she poured a cup
which she handed to Argus, who took it with his
left hand, for he still held his cane with the right.</p>

<p>"Tempe is romping, you remarked, Roxalana.
She is a proper jade. But it is better out of doors,
consequently she is where it is better."</p>

<p>Roxalana laughed a noiseless laugh, which in no
wise lighted up her dark, handsome face.</p>

<p>"She will have several races before sundown,"
she said, taking a chair at the table; "but her
romping days will soon be over. Do you realize
that her birthdays are counting up as well as ours,
Argus?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you marry her, and tie her runaway
feet? Matrimony puts an end to the antics of
your sex, and begins ours."</p>

<p>"Hush, Argus, she is on the stairs; keep your
doctrines for me, not for her."</p>

<p>Tempe fluttered in with the air of a blackbird.
Her hair was black, like her mother's, as ruffled,
but less abundant, and more beautiful; her face
pale and delicate; her eyes large, black, and constantly
darting sharp, inquisitive glances.</p>

<p>"What am I now?" she asked; "a child, a jade,
a witch, or a hussy?"</p>

<p>Argus threw his cane at her, which she caught
adroitly, and put in a corner.</p>

<p>"If you have not quite run yourself out of breath,
Tempe," her mother interposed, "I advise you to
take your breakfast."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, give me my coffee; they have
better breakfast at Mat Sutcliffe's every day than
this. Uncle, is your fare pleasant?"</p>

<p>"Silence!" he answered; "don't call me uncle,"
mimicking her voice, "because I am this woman's
brother-in-law."</p>

<p>As this was merely his way the sally passed unnoticed,
and breakfast was dispatched. Argus
spent the forenoon in the house, looking from the
windows, smoking, kicking the wood on the fire,
and watching Roxalana, who finished the week's
wash with composure and ease, regardless of his
presence. Tempe flitted in and out, slammed doors
in all parts of the house, moved a piece of furniture
now and then, and finally settled herself to
stringing beads on horse-hair. At midday a plain
dinner was served at the same table, at which Roxalana
presided with parboiled hands and the dignity
of a Zenobia. In the afternoon Argus went up the
street into town, and Tempe disappeared also.
Roxalana rested from her labors. She sat so
motionless in her straight-backed chair that a mouse
stole out and ran across her foot. At dark she
arranged her thick hair, and changed her coarse
dress for one of dark material, made in a fashion
she had worn for years. Lighting a pair of candles
she carried them across the wide hall into a large
room with four windows, facing the town and the
garden. Its walls were hung with green velvet
paper, somewhat frayed and discolored; damask-covered
sofas with claws and scrolls stood between
the windows; and a ponderous mahogany table occupied
the centre of the room. Upon this table
Roxalana set the candles. She then unlocked a
glass cabinet in the wall, took out some fragile
china, a spindle-legged silver tea-set, and arranged
them carefully for supper. An array of sweetmeats,
sweet cakes, and delicate biscuit was
added, which she viewed with a solemn satisfaction.</p>

<p>When Argus and Tempe came home she made
tea at the table with a ceremony which contrasted
strongly with the work and behavior of the day.
They sat at the table a long time, and this was an
invariable custom,&mdash;the sweetmeats, the sweet
cakes, the ceremony, being an absolute law and
bond between these three persons who lived in
Temple House.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>THE house of Argus Gates stood at the end of
an almost unused street, in the populous town
of Kent, once a great seaport. In the old Province
records there is a volume of actions in which Kent
Bay and Kent Bar figure; their storms and disasters
are the memorial treasures of the present
time. The old laws so arbitrarily provided for the
encroachments, changes, accidents of the sea, its
shoals, sands, and rocks that the inhabitants of
Kent have ever since rested upon their provisions,
and look for no geographical change. Meantime
commerce has gone elsewhere. Mariners found
the White Flat dangerous, the harbor not navigable,
the coast one to be avoided. A hundred younger
towns on the Atlantic coast now surpass Kent; her
sails are passing sails, her hulls wrecked hulls rotting
in the sand. The old piers have tumbled in
and fallen apart; black seaweeds are rooted in
their own decayed beds on the foundations; and
patches of sorrel grow in the gravelly tops. The
warehouses are silent along the water-side; their
derricks rattle and swing in the wind, like empty
gibbets. The aristocracy of Kent, as well as its
crowd of laborers, has vanished, leaving its noble
names to monuments, streets and hills. The old
estates are worse than obliterated; straggling
lanes, crumbling tenements, and pasture tracts represent
an ancient <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, which boasted of the exiled
names of Raleigh, Halifax, and Brooks. From
King's Hill, opposite Temple House, to Apsley
River, where Cyrus Brande's forge stood, Kent was
in no wise the proud, dictatorial, prosperous Kent
of former times. Still the business of ordinary life
flourished; there was buying and selling; the land
was tilled, the sea harvested. Religion, the Supreme
Court, the newspapers, marriage, birth, and
death, were all established in the old town.</p>

<p>Kent was not the birth-place of Argus. Temple
House had come to him when a young man, by the
unexpected will of a distant relative, whom he had
never heard of till he heard the tidings of his possession
as the last heir. Being about to sail on his
first voyage as captain, he sent his wife, to whom
he had not been married long, to take possession of
the house, and departed with the determination to
settle in Kent, and seek further fortune from that
port. His wife was dismayed at the size and
splendor of the house. It was full of antique furniture,
comfortless rubbish, in her estimation.
Some of it she sold, some she broke up and burned,
the remainder she packed in the garret with the
portrait of Madame Temple, the donor of the
house, and several other umber-colored pictures.
Argus was a poor man, and his wages, which were
those of a captain of a merchantman, only furnished
the necessities of life; consequently she could not
replace the old furniture with new, and Temple
House was never, in the common acceptation of
the term, furnished. She only used the great
kitchen, and the green room before spoken of,
which she made habitable with the articles belonging
to her simple wedding outfit. Considering the
sea the natural grave of her family, she could not
endure the sight of it, and was thankful for the
long espalier, the stone-mortared wall behind it,
and the high warehouse which screened the quay,
and almost shut out every glimpse of the bay.
She loved the old summer-house best, and strayed
with the old, old Provence and Damask roses, herself
as sweet and wild a rose. A beautiful lawn
stretched to the edge of the bank at the back of
which the house was built, so she saw nothing of
the life in the street below; it was pleasanter for
that. When not in the garden that first long summer,
she was in the green room watching the elms
on the lawn. So she lived, waiting for the return of
Argus.</p>

<p>In due time he came, and looked at his property
with amazement. It was the broken and depreciated
estate of the last member of a "first family."
This was attested by the town records, which he
looked into for the purpose of discovering the antecedents
of Madame Temple. Her portrait was
brought out, and he made a study of it to see what
was buried in her face, and if there was any affinity
between them. It proved a sphinx in both particulars,
but Argus hung it in its old place in the hall.
When his wife told him what she had done with
the belongings of the house he turned red, as if
some of the Temple blood tingled in his veins after
all, but he only laughed and chucked her under the
chin. Musing upon the matter, he concluded not to
discuss the subject; the house must remain a ruin;
which he could not expect her to be happy in.
Though feeling a blind compunction towards her,
his resolve never changed. Nor did he speak of the
presentiment which clung to him, that in this ruin,
whatever the vicissitudes of the coming years, he
should end his life.</p>

<p>One day, just before he went to sea again, when
the garden paths were full of rustling leaves, and
only the thorns grew on the rose-trees, they walked
to the summer-house, and having a brighter, happier
feeling towards the place, she kissed him, and
told him she loved the garden, and would think the
summer-house her own domain. She could not
love the old desolate haunted house, however; it
was not fit for poor young people like themselves.
Its echo of grandeur could not make up
for its want of comfort; but she would not complain.
Argus kissed her, but was silent. No, she
repeated, she would never complain; not if he
chose to hang the umber-colored pictures in the
very room where she slept.</p>

<p>"Let us get the lay of the land, now that we are
out," he said abruptly. "I believe I do not understand
the premises thoroughly."</p>

<p>They crossed the garden, went around the
grounds, and looked at the outside bounds. Argus
described and named every spot, as though he was
making a chart. On the town side they were shut
in by an alley, along which stood a row of mean
houses, whose sheds and yards came up to the
empty stables and out-buildings inside the wall.
A door, padlocked in it, communicated with the
alley at the upper end. Beyond the premises at
the rear, where poplar and buttonwood trees grew,
wild, grassy pastures stretched, marshy towards the
high shores of the bay, and hilly towards the
town. On all sides they were shut in from the
bay, the town, and the common business of
life. Argus was so well satisfied with his survey,
that he was on the point of expressing his
satisfaction, but seeing that his wife's eyes were
fixed on the high dormer windows, higher than
King's Hill even, he forbore. They wandered
back to the garden to sit in the summer-house
again, and once more kissed each other with those
kisses which for a moment disenthrall mortals from
the burden and influence of the universe.</p>

<p>The yellow twilight creeping round them, the
flame-edged clouds rolling down with sunset, the
inarticulate noise of tree and bush, the sound of
the drowsy sea pushing on Kent beach a mile away
were always remembered by Mrs. Gates; perhaps
Argus also treasured the hour in his memory. At
last they went into the house, and their mood naturally
slipped away. She busied herself with supper,
while Argus stood in the embrasure of the
green-room window, and continued his mental inventory
of his property.</p>

<p>It was possible that the ownership of Temple
House influenced the temporal affairs of Argus more
than he supposed. A vessel was offered him, within
a year from this time, and a venture in the cargo,
which he accepted, and made money by. Meantime
his wife had departed. Swiftly and silently
her brief, short life ended. He found her grave in
the high hill yard where the Temple ancestry slept&mdash;her
closed eyes and deaf ears insensible to the
sight and sound of shore and sea, to obtain which
the living often sought the hill. From the day that
Argus went there, he hated the scene which broke
upon his vision. The raging white surf beating on
the white beach, that darted like a tongue from the
headland below the town; the sand-stained ripples
of the one, and the roaring waves of the other;
the barren capes, stretching into the circle of the
sea; the restless clouds spreading and swelling by
the winds, borrowed his grief, and mirrored it in
his mind. It was a moment when nature seemed
capable to lead the soul to death and hold it there.</p>

<p>He remained a month or two alone in Temple
House, brooding over his past, or, it may be, planning
his future, no one really knew which. Cyrus
Brande, the only man who was intrusted with his
affairs, pretended ignorance when questioned concerning
them. When Argus had been gone a week
Mr. Brande circulated a report that the house
would be closed for some time, and for information
concerning Captain Gates, application must be
made at the office of Brande's Forge. Nobody
applied, and no information was obtained at the
office; the clumsy key of the front door at Temple
House hung on a nail for years. Meantime the
velvet moss thickened on the roof; the rose-trees
and shrubs mixed their leaves with the black mold
in the garden paths; the mortar powdered in the
crevices of the walls, and ran down like the sand
in an hour-glass; and the edges of the bank crumbled
and slid into the street, threatening to wear the
lawn to its level before Argus returned.</p>

<p>But he did return, taking the key of his house
from Mr. Brande's office as quietly as he brought
it there. He found the town at work on his premises,
walling the bank from the quay below them to
the corner of the alley above. His lawn gate now
opened into the gully, which was so deep opposite&mdash;the
other side being the walled portion of King's
Hill&mdash;that only a strip of sky could be seen over it.
To make his house more suitable for solitary confinement,
he repaired his garden wall, replaced the
old brick coping, and mended the roof with slate
stones.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>NOTWITHSTANDING his isolation Argus became
a noted man in Kent; his manners and
habits were closely observed and considered exceptional.
A mention of him between his acquaintance
gave the positive idea that he was a man to be let
alone. Yet there was something irresistible in the
impression he made; it seemed possible to confide
to him one's motives and acts. A history of his past
life was invented to tally with the ideal of what
the inventors might be, provided the opportunity
and courage had been given. The tranquil tolerance
or the biting sarcasm which he offered in
turn, presented small solution to the enigma of his
character. But, Argus knew himself; by his experiences
he had arrived at an understanding of
the traits which induced and which stifled them.
The life he had chosen was at variance with those
impressions his individuality continually caused.
The conditions of feeling which <i>he</i> shunned, the
agitations which crowd one hour to make the next
vacant, he had the power to create. For himself,
he was capable of enjoying his own atmosphere&mdash;that
of a well-constituted man, whose perceptions,
never attaining the beautiful, perhaps, dwell with
content upon positive, narrow, sensuous facts.
Argus, in the world, was very discerning, cautious,
and, in spite of his coarseness and indifference, had
a vein of courtesy which gained him at least an
outward respect. He hated cant, and had a way
of taking hold of the roots of a matter which made
people afraid of their own hypocrisy. For the
most part, no one ever questioned him about his
affairs; but one day, a man whom he had long
known asked him if he was aware how near he was
to his brother, George Gates, a younger brother,
from whom he had been separated for years. Argus
for an instant felt his cane oscillate in his hand
with the temptation to strike his informant; but
turning with a sharp laugh, he said:</p>

<p>"He is so near me, is he? The handsome
dog!"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth. Captain, I saw him.
Our brig ran into harbor not two hundred miles
from this, and a party of us skippers went ashore.
We hired a team and drove up the country for a
lark, till we came to a place called Eastdale; the
first man I clapped eyes on was George Gates.
By the Lord, sir, he was in full feather; sleek as a
porpoise. I felt riled, for he owes me five hundred
dollars. Ten years ago we met in the West Indies,
you know, and I followed him up. His father-in-law&mdash;"</p>

<p>Argus started, broke the sentence in two&mdash;so he&mdash;"has
not been dead long; he sold tobacco, snuff
and spice. You've seen those speckled lizards in
India? There was a row of them in bottles of
spirit in his window."</p>

<p>"I know them; but what of his she-lizard, the
one out of the bottle?"</p>

<p>"I did not introduce myself to George; you
recollect he had a way, at times, that a man would
not like to venture on. I reckon, however, that
the old man's death has unsettled him; he'll be off
again to parts unknown before long, or I am much
at fault."</p>

<p>A smile ran over the face of Argus at the
thought that George, vagabond as he was, could
still keep his friend and creditor, Smith, at bay.</p>

<p>"I thought I would tell you," Smith continued.
"I bore in mind the goings-on of my brother, Bill,
and tried to do as I would be done by."</p>

<p>"Hasn't the devil seized Bill for good, yet?"</p>

<p>"You see, I have not talked it over with anybody."</p>

<p>"Did you not tell your wife your dream this
morning? or throw the pillow at her for guessing
your thoughts? Off a voyage, a man is transparent
for a week or so, to his wife. But I am indebted
to you, Smith."</p>

<p>Smith laughed a horse-laugh, and turned away.</p>

<p>Argus absently noted the way of the wind, as he
leisurely walked towards home, stopping once to
toss over a paper that fluttered in his path which
looked like a handbill. He found Mrs. Bayley, a
woman from the alley, who came daily to prepare
his meals, and put the rooms in order, busy in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I shall not need you for several days, Mrs.
Bayley," he said. "I am off on a journey. Take
the keys, and open the house again on Friday."</p>

<p>"Yes sir. Would you wish any preparations
made; any other beds made up, or rooms put to
rights?"</p>

<p>"You alley-strollers have heard a rumor. Do
your best to spread it, and add something worthy
your tongues."</p>

<p>"I've got hold of mighty little, I do beg leave
to inform you. Captain Gates. I fetches and
carries nothing."</p>

<p>"The invisible air is clogged with the droppings
of women's fancies. Balls of gossip stick together
like burrs, and fall on Truth's stuffy gown as she
passes,"</p>

<p>"Mary Sutcliffe said&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted her with a few icy, cutting words,
spoken in the smoothest of voices, which drove her
from the room. He started immediately without
any plan, expecting with every mile that the feeling
which possessed him would explain itself; but it
evaded him. Had he really a desire to meet the
only member of his family alive, except himself?
Was the voice of the Temple blood, thin as it
might be, crying out in behalf of this reprobate
brother, as handsome as Romeo, as dissolute as
Antony, for whom in former times he had made
many sacrifices? Suppose George should propose
the same again: suppose that he might choose to
avail himself of the habitation which Temple House
would offer, with the family that Smith hinted at?
Could such a thing be endured? And Argus fell
into a dream about the occupation of the house by
some child growing up, and watching him, while
he travelled towards the place where there were
different mansions.</p>

<p>At the Eastdale tavern he met George. He was
smoking a cigar (which Argus instinctively knew
was a first-rate one), in a black velvet cut-away
coat and a white felt hat; from his crown to the
toe of his well-fitting boot an atmosphere of resolved
laziness emanated, which armed Argus
against him, especially as he could not withhold a
sentiment of admiration with it. In the face of
George was fierceness, weakness, and an expectant,
hungry look, in spite of his air of ease.</p>

<p>"Why, Arg, is that you below there? Come
up," and he smiled, but at the same time bit
through his cigar, with the surprise the sight of
Argus occasioned. "What sent you?"</p>

<p>"The love of you," Argus answered, "and an
invitation from Marm Temple's bones to come to
her house. Have you done with your pranks?
Could you amuse yourself in Kent?"</p>

<p>"Pranks!" George exclaimed; "my time has
been passed in a serious manner. Do you share
the vulgar judgment, that absence is the cloak for
a man's iniquity? Can not the vagrant member of
the family have a purpose? I'll come to Kent to
be wicked openly."</p>

<p>Argus laughed.</p>

<p>"The hells and brothels never touch on the prodigal
son, and the husk business, do they? Have
they changed since your green and salad days?"</p>

<p>George touched his smooth, handsome forehead,
extended his fair hand, opened and shut the
fingers.</p>

<p>"The husk business is extinct," he answered.</p>

<p>Argus took a chair inside the veranda railing,
and politely asked George for a light. It was politely
given, and the two smoked in silence, looking
toward the horizon.</p>

<p>"Say, Arg," exclaimed George, turning suddenly,
"what's come to your hair?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! something went; what could come to
<i>me?</i> Your plays and novels allot nothing to middle-aged
people. A life accessory to the illusions
of others at most&mdash;the gray background to their
reds and greens. I don't urge, with Shylock, that
if we are pricked, we bleed, if we are poisoned, we
die."</p>

<p>"I am past thirty, and would be as drunk with
life as ever, if I could but reach the draught."</p>

<p>He let his hand fall lightly on Argus's shoulder,
and Argus made a slight movement by which it
slid off.</p>

<p>"How is that abode of the Temple ghosts,"
George continued, "the tabernacle on a hill? By
the way, I am married; there's a little girl, too.
I named her Temple, ridiculous name&mdash;but I honored
the gods. Did you know this?"</p>

<p>"All Kent knows it; from your friend Moll
Sutcliffe, to your ancient chum, Smith. This must
be the reason I came; I know no other."</p>

<p>"All Kent," repeated George, rising, and indicating
to Argus to follow. "I never loved that
good old town. I ate dirt there, and shook what
was left from my flesh. I have rolled round the
world since, and in spite have gathered a certain
mossiness, and, as one must bring up somewhere,
brought up at Eastdale. Why not, Argus? I
found my wife here; she grew into that estate
by my typhoid fever, which caught and held me in
the port below. And this is where we live. Enter
the long lost brother."</p>

<p>Argus's first thought was, when he saw Roxalana,
that she was the last woman George would
have chosen; but when he heard her clear voice,
and fine accent, he forgave himself for having
met her. She received him with perfect self-possession,
and pushing little Temple toward him,
said:</p>

<p>"Kiss your Uncle Argus, Temple; he has come
a long way to visit you."</p>

<p>The child was beautiful, like George, with black
eyes, close curls of splendid black hair, a mass of
ebony rings, and the same attenuated, subtle features,
but with a different head and carriage.</p>

<p>"She may run away, also," Argus commented;
"but she won't run so far, and she will marry without
any typhoid fever trap." He asked her to sit
on his knee, and took her hand, which was so
exactly shaped like his own, that he could not help
smiling over it.</p>

<p>"What is going on, Rox?" George asked, with
a suppressed yawn, and roving eyes. Argus was
induced to believe that they had not met before
that day.</p>

<p>"We are engaged, as usual," she replied.</p>

<p>"I think I'll dine Argus at the tavern; I noticed
Jones had some fine ducks."</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Have we had ducks, Rox?" he asked, his
voice loudening with a shade of irritation.</p>

<p>"Not this season, certainly, George; it is early.
I am sure you will find the ducks at Jones's good
eating."</p>

<p>"I have dined," said Argus, "on brandy and
water, and biscuit&mdash;my old sea fare&mdash;and a cigar."</p>

<p>"I'll shortly furnish you with hospitality," replied
George, leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Roxalana," said Argus abruptly, "has the
time come for George to leave Eastdale?"</p>

<p>"I have not a doubt of it; I have always expected
that time sooner or later."</p>

<p>"What do you think of changing your quarters?
Will the old house answer for the little girl?"</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased to go. Having no ties here,
I can leave without regret. When I met your
brother I was almost alone. You are aware, of
course, that he has not made a worldly-wise
match?"</p>

<p>"I am aware that <i>you</i> have not made a remarkably
advantageous one."</p>

<p>She fixed her dense, cold eyes upon him, and
continued:</p>

<p>"I am a fatalist. Having done badly for himself,
not <i>me</i>, I choose that he should select his own
happiness first, so far as he can. My happiness, at
any rate, is not like the happiness of others. I
have long been convinced so."</p>

<p>Argus was astonished; he believed that he had
found the woman whose personalities would not
prove a nuisance. He began to weigh her merits
and the exaction she knew George would make,
and the merits prevailed. When George came
in again, Argus was scrupulously considerate with
him, and it was finally settled that, at least, the
experiment of a three months' visit should be
tried. The night that Argus returned to Temple
House, he went on a enigmatical excursion over
the house and grounds, knocking on the doors
with his cane, scaling the walls with his eyes, and
stepping off the measure of paths and walls, like
an auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Once here," he said, "she will never go away.
As for George,"&mdash;and he whistled.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>"I'D sell this moldy cupboard, if it belonged to
me," said George to his wife, upon his first
survey of Temple House; "Argus sticks to it.
What possessed him to believe that he could foist
the rattle-trap upon us? Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Very much, George; I think it agreeable here.
I have room enough."</p>

<p>"Make it as agreeable as you can for me.
Rox,&mdash;I have no money to speak of now. The
sum I married you on is exhausted. Let's see, how
old is Tempe? I recollect that on the day she was
born I looked into my situation, and I must say
I thought of the Spanish Main&mdash;and of Argus.
But you have spent nothing."</p>

<p>"I never spent money, George&mdash;I cannot be
wasteful; to save is my ambition."</p>

<p>"Rox, you are a miser. You dress yourself and
Tempe upon what? The poor little beggar is
always a thing of shreds and patches."</p>

<p>Roxalana made no effort to combat his opinion.</p>

<p>"I tell you I must have money, Rox."</p>

<p>There was nothing for her to say on this point.</p>

<p>"I must and will have it. Where shall I obtain
it?"</p>

<p>Intently regarding him, without a particle of
emotion in her face, she answered:</p>

<p>"You must and will have it; and you will obtain
it from Argus."</p>

<p>"So! well&mdash;for just now, day-day, Rox."</p>

<p>He left her in a composure that would have
driven a lover frantic; but George was not her
lover,&mdash;he scarcely knew why he had become her
husband. Nothing in her nature knit herself into
the temperament which compassed and ruined him.
He knew, though, that she would throw her soul
into the flames of hell as coolly as if it were an old
glove, for his sake; and that, good woman as she
was, she would lie for him with calm lips and unblenched
eyes, to hide his slightest fault.</p>

<p>With her, it was as Argus predicted; she grew
to the place as moss grows to the stone. Its space
and substantiality suited her silence-loving soul.
Tempe, having discovered the weak spot of the
domain&mdash;the door into the alley&mdash;made herself
happy with constant visits and rompings among
the children there, and was too much absorbed
with its hearty, vulgar life to miss any loving care
at home.</p>

<p>Gradually and unobtrusively Roxalana assumed
the control of the housekeeping; her method was
as rigid and exact as the laws of a monastery. Its
basis was an economy which George called parsimony,
and Argus prudence. Though she would
have gone to the world's end with George, had he
desired it, no prayer nor threat could induce her
to allow him two eggs for his breakfast: and when
Tempe cried with rage and disgust at her schoolmates'
discovery that she wore petticoats of duck,
made from the fragments of worn sails, Roxalana
even shared her tears, but said the petticoats
answered the same purpose as finer ones, and that
she esteemed it a fortunate circumstance to be so
near the junk store on the quay, for there were a
number of articles in it at half-price that no one
but herself would think of turning to account.
Argus was amused with her management. He
understood it after a little, when he discovered the
rapacity of George; it accorded with his wishes,
that she would employ no servant, nor any outside
help. At home he wished to drop everything that
entangled his personality. The more limited and
defined his exterior life, the greater his enjoyment
of that strange eternal liberty, which men of intellect
who have experienced much possess, and do
not desire to show. Roxalana herself, always sedate,
always at ease, keeping good faith with the
veritable, silent regarding the unsubstantial and
visionary, came singularly up to his requirements.
Not so with George, who existed in mental slavery
to some hope, or desire, which bore no relation
to his present possessions. To obtain his wishes
he needed a lawless liberty. Sharp and selfish as
Argus seemed&mdash;cold and cynical&mdash;it is certain that
he allowed George to impoverish him. In regard
to this fact, Roxalana, who knew it, made
herself magnanimous for Argus. On his side
he concealed his losses from her. They never
knew what George did with the money. Every
day he declared his intention of leaving Kent,
and every evening deferred his departure.
He soon exhausted the town; its high life
was merely respectable, and its low life devoid
of vim. His most worthy performance was in
clearing the old garden paths, resetting the roses,
and patching with vines and lattice-work the
summer-house. Roxalana knew little of flowers,
but in time of roses she liked to pull one to nibble
at and stare over. And she had a strange fancy
for tulips which George took pains to raise for her;
and when she first saw them blooming at Temple
House, her dark face borrowed their tint for a
moment, and her grave, stolid eyes smiled as she
thanked him.</p>

<p>"You are a kind of dusky, solemn tulip yourself,
Rox," he said.</p>

<p>Argus, looking at George while he was leisurely
making these repairs, acquired the habit of smoking
in the garden, and in this way they dropped into
each other's society, exchanged cigars, and scattered
their ashes in company. If they ventured on
speech it was to note the weather, to argue on
trivial points, banter each other, and to laugh; but
they never touched on any vital topic. Had they
done so, there might have been a root of bitterness
revealed. Inside the house they rarely met, except
at supper in the green room&mdash;that ceremony being
religiously observed still. Roxalana, George, and
Tempe alike yielded to the influence of Argus
there.</p>

<p>"Where is my father? Tempe sometimes
asked, missing him suddenly.</p>

<p>"He is in the place he chooses to be," her mother
generally, replied. "Where is your patchwork?
Do I see a rent in your frock? What is the matter
with your shoes?" And Tempe was diverted
from a subject which Roxalana preferred not to
dwell on herself. But when George was the most
irregular, her regularity was the most noticeable;
never was the housekeeping so nicely adjusted as
when he was absent.</p>

<p>The day came when he left Kent. There was no
mystery concerning his going&mdash;no opposition, and
no conclusion. As he crossed the threshold Roxalana
went to her chamber window, and watched him
going down the lawn, with a calm, heavy countenance.
Argus stood under the elms, his hat pitched
over his eyes, and Tempe was beside her father,
holding his hand. They reached the gate, where
neither Argus nor Roxalana's eyes could follow
them. George stopped and turned his head towards
the house.</p>

<p>"God! what ails me?" he cried.</p>

<p>Struck by a profound and painful emotion, for a
moment he stood like the stabbed Iago, bleeding,
but not killed. He took Tempe in his arms, and
gazed at her wistfully.</p>

<p>"Tempe, you are a beauty," he murmured;
"don't forget that you look like your father."</p>

<p>His fine eyes filled with tears; beads of sweat
burst out on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I am a wretch, Tempe," he said bitterly; "don't
forget that, either. Be sure that you can live without
the cursed fillip my nerves require. I cannot
define and settle my wants as the souls behind us
do. Well, the world&mdash;mine oyster&mdash;is no harder to
open than ever. But what <i>is</i> the use of my trying
it again."</p>

<p>He had kissed her a dozen times while speaking,
kissed her with sighs and trembling lips. She was
dumb, but hearing the sound of wheels down the
street checked him; it was his coach which had
come. As it drew up at the gate, his expression
changed, those empty, foolish hopes with which the
unknown deludes charged in upon him, dissipating
his doubt and misery like smoke in the air.</p>

<p>"Kiss papa," he begged. "Good girl; see what
a beautiful day it is for me. Ask mamma to count
the tulips this year. Tell her that I remember Roxalana's
goodness; she has been good to me, Tempe.
Mind this also: be polite to your uncle Argus."</p>

<p>He sprang from the gate, and went down the
steps without a sound.</p>

<p>Tempe heard the loud morning song of the birds
flying round the elms. She watched them. These
winged creatures afterwards embodied the remembrance
of her father&mdash;unapproachable, beautiful,
direct in their instincts&mdash;free as the ether that sustained,
and faithless as the winds that steered them
hither and thither.</p>

<p>Returning, she missed Argus, and searched the
house in vain for her mother. Then flying to the
alley, she played from house to house, dining with
her favorite, Mat Sutcliff, till nightfall. With a
new feeling of lawlessness, she boldly burst into the
green room, expecting to find confusion and dismay;
to her surprise, she saw her mother snuffing the
same candles, and making tea in the old fashion.
The supper was laid with the usual care, accompanied
with no pungent, mournful sauce. Argus
read the <i>Kent Chronicle</i>, as he did every evening.
From a diffidence which she could not have explained,
she avoided looking directly in her mother's
face, but kept on the alert for any sudden groan or
cry. But Roxalana wore the evening through in the
usual way, except that she continually brushed her
lips with her handkerchief, as if they were feverish.
When they were alone, and Tempe perceived that
her mother intended to go to bed silently, she
burst out with her father's message:</p>

<p>"He said I was to tell you that he had spoken
of your goodness to him; and that you must count
the tulips. And, oh&mdash;won't he come back?"</p>

<p>"I never was half good enough to him,
Tempe."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked Tempe, the tears
streaming from her eyes.</p>

<p>"We will count the tulips together. Now get
into bed, and dream of him, as I shall."</p>

<p>No change appeared in Roxalana's manner, but
from the day of George's departure, she never went
beyond the limits of the house. The fashion of
her dress remained the same, and she never looked
into a newspaper.</p>

<p>For many a January and July the percentage of
Argus's diminished capital dropped into his purse
with the thought that there might come a demand
for it from George. None came. The happy earth
moved eastward with its expectant lovers, but it
never rolled Roxalana's love in sight again. Tempe
shot up within the shadow of those dark walls as
the lovely star-flower comes up from the dark
ground in spring among the dead boughs and
needles of the pines. Finally, Argus and Roxalana
knew that George was dead. They read it, perhaps,
in each other's eyes; perhaps the air was
weighted with his passing soul, which burdened
them.</p>

<p>They announced his death to Tempe, for once
in speech working together, offering the courtesy
to the last mortal Cause which should be the warrant
for the same towards themselves on a like occasion.
There were no tears, nor lamentations,
but Roxalana stared as fixedly at Tempe as if the
lids of her eyes had lost the power of closing over
them; and Argus was pale and downcast; his
hands moved about in search of something to
adjust. Tempe looked from one to the other, and
with some embarrassment asked if she should wear
black. Roxalana shook her head, and a faint, sarcastic
smile played over Argus's lips, and his hands
ceased to be nervous. When Tempe looked in the
glass that night, and let down her hair, she remembered
the injunction of her father, that she must
not forget the likeness between them, and sat
motionless, watching her image, her mind dwelling
on their parting interview at the gate. Picturing,
as she did, the defacement of the dead, and shrinking
from the dull power of the unknown grave,
which had quelled her counterpart, she could not
resist the contrast which the sight of her beautiful
vitality gave her, and so her father's self faded
away. From this period the routine of life lost
its dash of bitter flavor with Argus and Roxalana;
a dramatic possibility had disappeared. The elasticity
of Argus's temperament stretched without
strain or snap; time stood equably with him. His
face looked firm and smooth; his eyes latent with
energy, his bearing full of idle strength. Roxalana,
heavy, incurious, with slight self-love, perfectly
well balanced in mind and body, excepting
a dark, crooked desert, which was only revealed,
as the mirage is revealed, when the desert is traveled
upon, settled into a placid content which did not
look beyond itself. Temple lived as a child lives&mdash;in
an unthinking flow of high spirits, which turned
each day into a series of absorbing events.</p>

<p>The lapse of years sometimes kindly purls along
even with the sophisticated; when God, and the
Universe, and their own passions do not trouble
them; when their enjoyments and afflictions do
not range higher than those of the savage. It was
so at Temple House. It was a natural worship which
Argus offered himself at the shrine of Aurora on
this September morn. The day's labor to Roxalana
was a sufficient and reasonable one, and it was not
necessary that Tempe, by any thunderbolt, should
be startled from her happiness and vacuity.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE were but two families holding relations
with Temple House; that of Cyrus Brande,
the owner of Brande's Forge, on Apsley River, a
wild secluded spot, two miles, by the pastures, from
Temple House; and that of Mat Sutcliffe, wharfinger,
stevedore, and retired sailor, whose house in
the alley was against the door in the garden wall,
and near the pasture path leading to the Forge.
For the most part of his seafaring life, Mat accompanied
Argus as his second mate. When Argus
left the sea, so did Mat; but their intercourse continued:
Argus valued Mat, and Mat was devoted
to Argus. The alley inhabitants called the Sutcliffe
family disreputable. Mat slept all day on
Sunday, or prowled the fields with his boys and
dogs, and Mary, his wife, instead of going to
church with her neighbors, stayed at home to do her
week's ironing. Mary's habits were somewhat
cat-like; it was easy for her to purr and play, and
as easy to scratch and snarl. She wheedled, coaxed
and bullied Mat, for she was afraid of him; and
Mat was rough with her. He sometimes drank
hard; swore a good deal at inanimate things; had
periods of skulking in the chimney-corner, and
about the docks and wharves, doing and saying
nothing. He pretended in his talkative moods that
all women were vicious, and all men dishonest; but
his conduct belied his opinions. He watched over
Tempe Gates as if he were her guardian angel. If
a man had breathed a word against Argus, Mat
would have knocked that man down and beaten
him. He never, however, made any profession of
attachment to either Argus or Tempe; sentiment
would not have looked well coming from him. He
was a short, thick-set man, with small, sharp
eyes, and burnt-looking hair. A pipe was in
his mouth generally, and in his leisure moments
he carried a rope's end about him. His jacket
was apt to be tarry, and he was fond of wearing
large canvas slippers made by himself.
Occasionally he played the stern father, thrashed
his boys for stealing brushwood and old iron;
but oftener winked at the depredations, as they
were articles without owners. He sometimes exerted
his marital authority over Mary, but usually
ended his attempts by telling her she wasn't half as
bad as he was. Tempe abused and patronized him,
and considered him part of the property of Temple
House. What was the gate made in the wall for,
if he wasn't? And Mat assured her it was true;
and if ever the house came to be sold, he should be
sold with it. The bustle and confusion of his hut,
Mary's gipsy-like ways in her housework, the careless,
gay spirits of the whole family, were highly
attractive to Tempe. Roxalana sometimes told her
she frequented Mat's too often, but was herself too
much a child of nature to have a thought that the
society of the Sutcliffes was beneath her. Argus
was quite satisfied to have her in so safe a place as
under Mat's eye. The natural separation would
come soon enough.</p>

<p>The acquaintance with the Brandes began with
the former business relations between Argus and
Cyrus, and continued between Tempe and the only
child of the Brandes&mdash;Virginia. Excepting the
two girls, the families seldom met; their spheres
were different, as Mrs. Brande, commonly called
Rhoda Cyrus, frequently observed, when Virginia's
fondness for Temple House was commented on,&mdash;as
different as pound cake was to molasses ginger-bread.
The charm that drew Virginia to Temple
House no one comprehended; year by year it
deepened, and became a part, or rather the whole,
of an interior life, aside from her home and parents.
She received a double education, one contrasting
widely with the other. The sensible, unworldly
sincerity of Roxalana; the conduct of Argus,
which absolutely denied the influence of opinion,
and yet was so calm, orderly, and cheerful
without it; his indifference to money: his idleness
through which he was led to note with critical exactness
those matters usually escaping the attention
of men; his moods, urbane, candid, jeering, bitter;
the wildness of Temple; her freedom from all control,
her loneliness,&mdash;all made up a different world,
and Rhoda Cyrus was so far correct. The fashion
of the poverty at Temple House was more imposing
to Virginia than the ever-working effect of her
father's wealth; its worry and fuss and glare persuaded
all Kent, outside Temple House, but within,
its effect was lost.</p>

<p>Cyrus Brande lived between two masks; one
faced the world, and the other faced&mdash;himself.
He appeared austere, pious, and reserved behind
the former; before the latter he felt still pious,
but genial, sensual, and cowardly; rarely, if
ever, were these masks removed for him to appear
a violent, passionate, inconsistent man. He
was a great financier, a powerful man in his
church, and, with reason, bore an irreproachable
character.</p>

<p>He despised books, pictures, and sentiment, but
loved personal ornament, and above all things
beauty in women, though he never took off his private
mask to speculate on it. Rhoda Cyrus, his
proverbial echo abroad, was his pest at home, and
the burden of Virginia's life; she was indolent,
whining, uneasy, and endeavored by drugs and
stimulants to deaden herself against the torments
of her position. Cyrus was patient with her, but
excused her from none of the religious and secular
duties which he had imposed upon himself, as a
portion of the life he thought necessary to lead.
To avoid these impositions she practiced much
cunning, and hence Virginia's martyrdom.</p>

<p>Rhoda Cyrus hated prayers, parties, and to ride
in town with the best span. It was a nuisance,
the wearing of her gold watch and jewelry.
It was tedious to follow the observance of the
attentions and charities expected of her, from
the position of Cyrus, in regard to the church
and the body of his workmen. To the public the
machinery which regulated the affairs of the
Brandes was perfect. The Forge was quite a settlement:
there were shops, sheds, a row of workmen's
houses, and the large house where the family
lived. Apsley River, bending below the Forge,
widened before the house and swept round again
above it. Opposite the house, the land rose gradually,
and limited the view: nothing was to be seen
on this side but a short, dull-colored grass, and an
occasional boulder. The landscape in other directions
was no pleasanter. The house was large,
well built, with every modern improvement, and
furnished as the houses of rich business men usually
are. The best of everything was in it, in the
way of curtains, carpets, and furniture. The landscape
and the house were a clue to Virginia's obvious
history. Strictly speaking, her father had compelled
her to take the advantages of money. She
was educated at schools of note and had traveled,
but had not taken kindly to education, and
was indifferent to foreign scenery. At twenty
her acquirements were poor, so far as music,
drawing, and the languages went; but nature
had given her a gracious soul, and experience
was enriching and deepening her character. Her
faults were not numerous, but sufficiently strong,
marring many of her acts, and often destroying
her resolves; Tempe, younger by several years,
selfishly clung to her, and, like the rest of her friends,
trampled upon her yielding individuality. To
most people Virginia was as lovely as a star, and as
distant. Thanks to the will of her father again,
she claimed a degree of attention from those who
could go no further, from the style of her dress, which
varied so that her beauty could never be decided
upon by them. She was a brunette, because her
hair was black and red became her complexion; a
blonde, because she was pale and had the deepest
blue eyes, which contrasted well with yellow. Her
forehead was low, her nose straight, consequently
her face was Grecian, and the true way of wearing
her hair was the Greek fashion, which she sometimes
adopted. Her cheeks were full, her chin and jaw
wide and firm; therefore when her hair was worn
in smooth bands, a likeness to her grandfather, who
was accused of being an Irishman, was plainly to
be seen. As she was uniformly reserved, her popularity
in the first circles of Kent could only be accounted
for by the original and constant change of
her wardrobe.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>"WHAT sign is the sun entering that makes
you so rampant?" asked Argus, as Tempe
dashed in one day, her cheeks dyed a hot crimson,
her eyes flashing and humid.</p>

<p>"I never will have my hair cut again, mother!"
she cried vehemently. "Never; don't ask it."</p>

<p>"What shall I have then to wipe my hands on,"
Argus inquired, "if your hair isn't short? Come,"
and he approached her with extended hands,
threatening her.</p>

<p>Tempe bound her handkerchief over her head
quickly, and hid her hair.</p>

<p>"Tell me the difficulty," Roxalana said.</p>

<p>"I was over to Caroline Drake's, and she told
me that John said he never heard of such a thing
as keeping a young woman's hair short to make
her look like a boy."</p>

<p>Roxalana looked at Argus, and felt herself detected.
She had kept Tempe's hair short, because
thereby she looked so much the more like George.
No way of wearing it could have made her look
prettier; the jetty mass clasping her head, suited
her face,&mdash;as yet soulless, like a cameo Diana;
rings of it dropped over her forehead, the tips of
her ears, round her neck, short and fine, like the
young tendrils of a blossoming grape-vine.</p>

<p>"If you wish to gain the approbation of John
Drake," replied her mother, "I will give you permission
to tie up your hair at once. You will
soon make it ugly and straight enough to stick a
comb in."</p>

<p>"I don't care for John Drake, mother; but who
wishes to look like a boy, when one is not
a boy?"</p>

<p>"Tempe," said Argus, "you are the worst kind
of boy&mdash;tomboy."</p>

<p>"Uncle Argus, why is my hair not like yours&mdash;wiry,
shiny, obstinate?"</p>

<p>"Because you are my dear little niece, and not
like me in any particular."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" she exclaimed reflectively, her
mind roving in search of a bit of ribbon to do up
her hair with, according to Caroline Drake's advice.
"I wish, for once, that I could have some
money."</p>

<p>"What would you do with it?" asked Argus.</p>

<p>"As other girls do. Look at Virginia Brande&mdash;look
at Caroline Drake&mdash;and now look at me.
Those girls carry pocket-books; they buy anything
they like&mdash;even give it away if they choose.
Who ever gave away any money in this house, I
should be pleased to know? Carrie Drake has
four silk dresses: Virginia has a closet full, and I
have this "&mdash;she shook out a scanty, nondescript
skirt with bitter contempt&mdash;"a dress that was
made for mother in the year one; a blue, a green,
a yellow piece of distress; and I live in the biggest
house in Kent, bigger than the jail, and as pleasant;
and my name is older than the hills,&mdash;Tempe
Gates; for the Lord's sake tell me who gave
me such a name?"</p>

<p>"There, Tempe," said Roxalana, quietly; "that
will do for this time."</p>

<p>"Let her rail," ordered Argus, as quietly.</p>

<p>Tempe tore the handkerchief from her head, and
threw it on the floor. Roxalana, with ludicrous
solemnity, settled herself into a serious listening
attitude. Tempe went on:</p>

<p>"I should like to know why I can not have
money, and if ever I am going to have it! I am
tired of my shabby, mean life."</p>

<p>Three lines darted down Argus's stony forehead,
between his eyebrows, and rested there.
Roxalana saw them, and made a movement to pick
up the handkerchief, for a warning to Tempe to
stop, but was prevented from taking it by the
setting of Tempe's foot upon it.</p>

<p>"Uncle Argus."</p>

<p>He rose suddenly, and felt in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Roxalana," he said, "I miss my desk key;
have you had it?"</p>

<p>"I thought I left it in a drawer, after I put some
flower-seeds there. Do you wish for it now?"</p>

<p>He nodded, and she went out, with an eye on
Tempe; but Tempe was beyond heeding its dictation.</p>

<p>"Uncle Argus,"&mdash;she began again, but he interrupted
her.</p>

<p>"I will tell you why you can not have money:
Your father robbed me of so much, that I shall
never be able to be generous to his daughter."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!"</p>

<p>"And I will tell you a way to get money.
Marry it."</p>

<p>"My father did not rob you."</p>

<p>"Not with his hand on my throat, or thrust into
my pocket, but genteelly&mdash;he asked for it. Your
mother knows it, and does not know it from me.
Now do not speak so before her again. Pick up
your handkerchief."</p>

<p>It was in her hand, and she stood like a statue
when Roxalana returned with the key.</p>

<p>Argus had no idea of the chord he was striking
when he said "marry money"; but John Drake,
the young man who objected to her boyish appearance,
was in love with Tempe, and she concluded
now to marry him. She felt elated and irritable
at his sudden admiration&mdash;curious, excited, and
proud; but her heart was not touched,&mdash;not an
atom of it. This stormy scene, in fact, was owing
to her uncertainty as to the best way in which the
affair should be conducted.</p>

<p>Roxalana resumed her seat, as if the discussion
was to have an everlasting continuance; but
Tempe raised her eyes to Argus, gave him a significant
nod, and walked softly away.</p>

<p>"She requires no money, Argus," said Roxalana.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the young one? Do
you mean to keep her out of woman's estate? or is
she too empty-headed to inherit it?"</p>

<p>"She is but a child, surely?"</p>

<p>"Half of you are never anything more; but
make her an older child, I advise."</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"On account of these growing tantrums; not
because it is necessary she should have much
sense. She is very pretty; I was not aware till
just now how fast beauty had come upon her&mdash;the
little rascal."</p>

<p>Roxalana gave one of her internal, joyful laughs.</p>

<p>"I never pretended that I could manage anybody,"
she said. "It is useless&mdash;the attempt to
govern children, just as useless as the attempt is&mdash;to
govern men and women. I never thought that
the Lord intended us for weathercocks, to be
veered by the judgment of each other. Nothing
changes my opinion or wishes, after I once know
them."</p>

<p>"I believe you: yet whose acts were ever more
governed than yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by fatality."</p>

<p>"Well, somehow Tempe's comb will be cut?"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>In town that day Argus heard a rumor, to the
effect that the Drake family were trying to persuade
John Drake to go to Europe, and break off
the affair with Temple Gates.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>"SHE is not."</p>

<p>"She is."</p>

<p>"Well, if <i>you</i> think much of this ere peat fire, <i>I</i>
don't." And Mat Sutcliffe stamped on the black
mass smouldering in the fireplace, to show his contempt
for Moll's experiment in the way of fuel,
and to conceal his surprise.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" he asked, after
ruminating a space. "Tempe wears pantalets yet;
she is too young to marry."</p>

<p>"I should know that something next to heaven
and earth coming together was going to happen in
the family, for Roxalana Gates has given up doing
the washing."</p>

<p>"Who said so?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bayley, who is going to take it home for
so much a month."</p>

<p>"And you and she have been washing dirty
linen besides; that woman is the dry rot of the
alley, and you love her. What else did she say?"</p>

<p>"Dry rot wouldn't say anything to 'tract you, of
course."</p>

<p>"Tell me what she said, and without fooling,
too."</p>

<p>"She said the Drake family was as mad as fire
about it; that they called John an idiot, Tempe a
baby, Roxalana cracked, and Argus a pauper."</p>

<p>"That's reglar dictionary talk," said Mat contemptuously.
Then he swore at the Drakes, root and
branch. "Didn't all Kent know," he demanded,
"that old Jack Drake, the grandfather of John, was
a pirate? And that William Drake, John's father,
had been so long under the old man's thumb, that
nobody could tell which from t'other? Pirating
was out of date, but the land-shark was in fashion&mdash;same
thing&mdash;one was wet, the other dry. But,"&mdash;and
Mat turned upon Mary,&mdash;"he should like to
know whether anybody had aught to say against
the young feller, John Drake?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but yourself," Mary replied; "you
are saying that the Drakes are pretty much of a
muchness. I guess John is his father's son, and I
guess, too, that he'll find what's trumps when he is
spliced to Temple Gates."</p>

<p>"You have been telling me a pack of lies. And
now, marm, if you will allow me. I'll take a spell
of the open air."</p>

<p>"Take anything you like for all me, Mr. Sutcliffe."</p>

<p>He went out, and took a seat on the top of the
wall nearest the path to the Forge, carefully filled
his pipe, and put it into his mouth without lighting
it.</p>

<p>"I'll wait," he thought. "Maybe I'll smell musk
before long. Virginia Brande has it about her
lately; it ought to come up on the wind that blows
from the Forge; a reglar sou'-easter's breeding.
She will know whether they are going to let that
child marry. Curse Argus!&mdash;he has played maroon
so long in his wreck of a place, that he has
forgotten his relation to human beings. I should
like to split open the twirls of his heart with a
marlinespike."</p>

<p>He watched the turns of the path which glimmered
in the dusk and disappeared in the darkness;
no one appeared; neither Virginia, whom
he expected, nor any workman on his way to town.
He lighted his pipe, and changed his watch from
the path to the sky. Dun-colored clouds rolled in
threatening masses toward the bay, whose dull
roar broke and gathered again along the dreary
coast below the dreary pastures. His thoughts
crept out seaward,&mdash;rose and fell over the waves
of an adventurous past, which knew the life that
rounds the deep.</p>

<p>"Dirty weather, Mat," some one said close to
him. He looked round and saw Argus wrapped in
his old camlet cloak.</p>

<p>"Is it the same at home that you are out on the
wall, with the salt driving up the wind? Moll mad
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Beats me, to find you in the same spot, without
a Moll at home to torment you, Captain," Mat replied,
"I was just thinking of the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When&mdash;" Argus interrupted&mdash;"we were at
Port&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no; that particular time, I mean, when
your foot happened to be stung by a scorpion.
Haven't you got a scar?"</p>

<p>"Not a scar, anywhere, outside nor in," Argus
answered, furling his cloak, and placing himself
beside Mat on the wall.</p>

<p>"I believe you."</p>

<p>"What of that time? We were off Antonia,
were we?"</p>

<p>"We were on shore."</p>

<p>"Just as we are now, in the dark."</p>

<p>Mat laughed, knocked the ashes from his pipe,
and put it in his pocket. That they were well
matched, each knew. Their thoughts traveled
together in silence; it was well enough for them
just at that moment to be next each other without
speaking. The roar of the wind and sea increased;
the air was pungent in the mouth, wild in its flavor,
and exciting; the darkness settled round them like
a substance. The influence of eyesight between
them being impossible. Mat was suddenly emboldened.</p>

<p>"You've hated the salt water long, Captain. I
see you everywhere, but in sight on't. You can't
help feeling, though, that the world is made to
tremble by the almighty ocean. There's no more
shake in your life, hey? What's the reason?
Why not go out again?"</p>

<p>"Let me find the reason," said Argus, tugging
at one of his boot-tops which had slipped down.
"Could it have been the scorpion that first sowed
dissension between me and the sea? Or"&mdash;he
stopped, lost in some reflection, and Mat hastily
resumed:</p>

<p>"There's no kind of a track of your sea-life upon
you. Every other sailor shows the strain of the
plank between him and hell. I do for one, I know.
I'd like to walk it now and then; but you,&mdash;are
you afraid?"</p>

<p>"That plank between me and eternity I kicked
away some years ago, for my soul to slip in at any
moment, and lose, or find itself, in the yawning
chasm it dreams of so stupidly now. As you say, I
have no love for the sea. Have you observed love
for anything in me? Love, they say, is terrible
and beautiful, like the sea you brag on: I have
cut away from terror and beauty. Peace and
laziness are the words to describe my days,&mdash;days
without desire. As for hope, you ass, that lives
where sky and sea meet. Why should I set my
eyes there? Because I am <i>afraid?</i>"</p>

<p>Mat jumped from the wall.</p>

<p>"How happens it that you are on the way to the
Forge to-night!"</p>

<p>"I am on my way to nowhere, but am trying to
oblige you in the matter of being catechized. So
go on. I was married once"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't go on,&mdash;I've had enough. I was looking
out for Virginia Brande."</p>

<p>"Do you call her Virginia?" asked Argus, with
a slight surprise in his voice.</p>

<p>"Don't I say Tempe, also?"</p>

<p>"There's a difference."</p>

<p>Mat concluded that Argus was ignorant of the
rumor concerning Tempe: there was no need of
saying anything to him on the subject.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll put down the lane," he said.</p>

<p>"Why were you looking for Virginia Brande?"</p>

<p>"I often see her, on her way to your house. I
rather like to keep an eye out for her, on dark
nights; she wears musk, and her silk gowns rustle;
it's easy telling her."</p>

<p>"Musk! all perfume to your tarred sense is
musk, is it?"</p>

<p>No more was said. Mat accompanied Argus
through the alley, saw him inside his door, and
then walked to the other side of the town, and
inspected the house where the Drakes lived. A
light was visible in an upper window, although it
was past midnight. He stared at it awhile, and
then turned away, thinking, "Well, what of it?
suppose it is so,&mdash;what is it to me?" Too
thoroughly roused to go home, however, he prowled
round the town till daylight, and then returned,
to find Mary on the hearth in her stockings, busy
frying fish for his breakfast. Before noon that
day he passed Argus on the street, and they looked
at each other without a nod.</p>

<p>There was a storm in the Drake family when
John announced his intention of marrying Tempe.
His father protested against it, his mother wept,
and his sisters declared it was a shame. But John
simply said, "I want her, and I am of age." He
had the power to carry out his plan, for he was
his father's partner; the articles had just been
signed between them, and there was no danger of
John's being cut off with a shilling;&mdash;his income
was a sure one.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have that little Temple Gates," his
sister Caroline cried, "for her weight in diamonds."</p>

<p>"I'd have her," her brother replied, "for her
own weight; and I have got her. She is mine.
Ain't she pretty?"</p>

<p>After he had begged Tempe to marry him, and
obtained her consent, he wrote a polite letter to
Argus, which contained the customary phrases,
and the request that Tempe should be made ready
for the ceremony in two weeks from its date.
Argus gave the letter to Roxalana, who read it,
and asked what he was going to do.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied; "let her marry him.
Keep her in the house, however, until I have seen
him."</p>

<p>The letter remaining unanswered, and Tempe
shut within doors, John was compelled to pay
Argus a visit. There was little said on either side.
Argus made no comment on the manner in which
the affair had been conducted; remarked that
John's impatience was quite natural; invited him
to come to the house daily: and decided that there
should be no wedding, but that they should be
married some morning without any display. Roxalana
shook hands with her future son-in-law
timidly and respectfully, and then mutely looked
at him, expecting something, she hardly knew
what, in the way of explanation. He had seen
her before, but it was the first time they had been
brought in contact, and he was amazed at the
difference between her and Tempe.</p>

<p>"I hope," she said at last, "that your family are
pleased with my daughter. I have heard her mention
her acquaintance with your sisters."</p>

<p>"She will not marry my family, madam," John
answered. "They have made some trifling objection
on the score of age; that was the only one I
noticed. I am very glad to take her as I can get
her."</p>

<p>"Are you?" said Argus sharply, "and so your
family objected to the match? Where do you
intend she shall live?"</p>

<p>"With us, at home, for the present."</p>

<p>"No; she shall remain with me, till you can provide
a house for her."</p>

<p>"There's room enough for both of you here,"
said Roxalana, mildly. "It is proper that she
should stay here; she is too young to manage
housekeeping. I shall call her, and tell her so."</p>

<p>Tempe was called.  She pouted at John, and
said she never had the least idea of leaving home.
When they met alone he stormed about it, but
she was firm.  She knew the opposition of the family,
and she never would go near them.  For an
unexplained reason the Drakes veered round in
Tempe's favor when they heard of this; kissed her
in public; drove down to the door of Temple
House often, and had interviews with her on the
lawn; bowed with ceremony to Argus, and sent
polite messages to Roxalana.  "The little beauty
John is going to marry," they said, when talking
about her.  Mr. Drake wished that if the marriage
was to take place quietly in the morning at Argus's
house, that there should be a gay wedding party
at his house in the evening.  He gave Tempe
some beautiful dresses and a box of ornaments,
called her his pretty dear, and tried to take her on
his knee.</p>

<p>"I hate him," said Tempe; "he makes me sick;
but I like his presents, and will take all he chooses
to give. Just think, mother, of his giving me a
crimson silk! How came he to know enough
for that? Caroline must have hinted at it
for me."</p>

<p>"I think the dress is a terrible one," Roxalana
replied, "and the ornaments are not to be described;
don't let me see you wear them yet
awhile. I suppose Mr. Drake must have his way
about the party for you. I hope I may be excused
from going."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Tempe answered carelessly, "you
need not go."</p>

<p>"You must go," said Argus, "and bring Tempe
home with you. I shall go in my coat with brass
buttons,&mdash;made before Tempe was born, which I
wore when I dined with the Commissioner of Barbadoes."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>TEMPE was married on an October day. The
green room was not comfortably warm that
morning; Argus looked icy also, and Roxalana
was more dense than usual. Tempe's cheek,
glowed, and her eyes shone with a luster borrowed
from the occasion. The Drakes were present, and
Virginia Brande. Mat Sutcliffe sat in the hall
during the ceremony, in a new pair of duck trowsers,
cut and stitched by himself, and Mary waited
upon the company in a blue and yellow dress,
bought for the purpose. A pale Episcopal priest
made John and Tempe man and wife; he rounded
off the periods of the service beautifully, but when
he said, "Whom God hath joined, let man not
put asunder," Mat laughed, and said to himself,
"curious stuff, that, for a couple of children."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that chap?" meaning the
minister, he asked of Argus a few moments afterwards.</p>

<p>"He seems to be a mild, cheerful prisoner and
victim."</p>

<p>"What a beautiful ceremony!" said Caroline
Drake to Roxalana.</p>

<p>"It is sad to me," Roxalana answered; "something
pronounced over dust&mdash;just like your funeral
service."</p>

<p>"My dear children," said Mrs. Drake, her face
in her lace-bordered handkerchief, "it is for better
and for worse,&mdash;remember. Can't we get away
soon?" she whispered, turning from her embrace
of Tempe, after dropping a weak kiss on her chin.</p>

<p>"The ring pinches my finger, John," Tempe said
under her breath.</p>

<p>"I know better," he answered softly. "Will
you drink some wine with me?"</p>

<p>She assented, and he brought her a glass.</p>

<p>"Look at me," he demanded.</p>

<p>Her eyes met his; the pang he deserved, lawful
as his seizure of her had been, cut his heart; nothing
in her face answered the expression of his own.
The glory and hope of the hour she did not share.
In that misty pleasure-garden, which one can enter
but once to search for the enchanted fruit, he was
alone. Bright, restless, void, Tempe stood beside
him in her own sphere&mdash;unmindful of the paradise
whose portals opened within her reach. Near, yet
far from him, rose its terraces of flowers, one above
the other, in masses of beauty, whose forms and
colors bewilder the senses. Its crystal fountains
played against the pure zenith, filling the air with a
murmur whose mystery famishes and then feeds
the soul. On the verge of two worlds he saw both,
for a moment; then the selfishness of a man came
to his aid, and shut out all that was not real.</p>

<p>"Hem!" exclaimed Mr. Drake, by the table.
"This is most excellent wine, Captain Gates; I am
quite astonished at it."</p>

<p>"Are you?" Argus replied, "I brought it over
myself."</p>

<p>"Now, really, did you, indeed?"</p>

<p>The flavor of the wine so much increased his respect
for Argus, that he conversed with him till a
move was made for departure.</p>

<p>"There is no set dinner anywhere to-day I believe,"
he remarked, in his pragmatic way; "won't
you all adjourn to my house, and be on hand for the
entertainment?"</p>

<p>John looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Temple and myself," he said, "are to dine at
the Grove House. The horses should be here. I
ordered them, as I ordered the dinner&mdash;two weeks
ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Drake looked admiringly at his son for this
proof of forethought and method in his madness.</p>

<p>Presently they were gone. Roxalana was not in
her usual seat, but sat near the window, staring at
the murky sky, and holding her handkerchief over
her mouth. Argus was gratefully smoking, and
drumming an original air on the back of his chair
with his fingers.</p>

<p>"As this business has nothing to do with our purpose
in living, I am glad it is over," he remarked.</p>

<p>"We might as well have philosophy now as at
any other time, Argus."</p>

<p>"Roxalana&mdash;you see how we hurry over the accidents,
like birth, marriage, and death, and dwell
in the slow mornings and long evenings which
bring us nothing but tranquillity."</p>

<p>"I don't like this dark sky," she said abruptly.</p>

<p>"The sunrise was no better."</p>

<p>"Did you observe Mat Sutcliffe's extraordinary
appearance?" and Roxalana heaved a strong sigh,
in token that she was going to throw off her melancholy.
"I am thinking that he went home petrified."</p>

<p>"I gave him a bottle of wine to put under his
jacket. The old fellow never has been able to separate
himself from an honest interest in my affairs."</p>

<p>"It should be so; there is something about him
that I esteem."</p>

<p>"The Drakes would appreciate that sentiment,&mdash;don't
you think?"</p>

<p>"I despise those Drakes."</p>

<p>Argus laughed, and in an instant Roxalana joined
with him. So they chatted,&mdash;a most unusual circumstance&mdash;till
the dusk ended the autumn day,
which had been a long one.</p>

<p>"I invite you to give me an extra candle at supper,
Roxalana, and some of our fine tea."</p>

<p>"The last box has not been opened," said Roxalana,
feeling an agreeable solicitude concerning it.</p>

<p>"And the Don's sweetmeats, also."</p>

<p>"Which Tempe likes so well!"</p>

<p>Several hours later they were in Mr. Drake's
crowded house as guests, as much apart from the
spirit of the scene as Banquo's ghost at Macbeth's
supper. Roxalana was immediately and adroitly
shelved by Caroline Drake, in an easy-chair in a
shaded corner, which partially obscured the effect
of a black silk dress with straight, tight sleeves,
and a large muslin collar, yellow with age. Her
hair was twisted as usual, in one heavy mass, and
two scarlet spots burnt in her dark cheeks. She
watched Tempe with calm, unwinking eyes, and
kept her hands folded.</p>

<p>"I am coming to sit beside you soon," said Virginia
Brande to her, turning her head aside from a
young man who carried her fan and some beautiful
flowers. You and I are to make an agreement."</p>

<p>"Is that the witch of Endor?" the young man
asked. "I shall be fond of seeing you sit next her,
the contrast will be so fine."</p>

<p>"Shall you? look at me now then." He was despoiled
of fan and flowers so suddenly that his
hands remained suspended in the air, while his eyes
followed her as she sank like a fleecy cloud upon a
low seat close to Roxalana.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful to-night,&mdash;don't you think so?"
asked Roxalana, turning benign regards upon Virginia.
"And you,&mdash;you must enjoy yourself, you
are so well fitted to shine in such a place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Roxalana, how much I like <i>you</i>; you are
dear enough to me. I am so happy to have faith
in you at all times, being seldom satisfied with the
feelings I have towards people; duty and obligation
are so mixed with them. There's no duty between
you and me, no obligation,&mdash;is there, Roxalana?"</p>

<p>"Let me smell your flowers?" Roxalana begged,
stretching out her hand. Her clear, slow voice
had a caressing tone which was new to Virginia.</p>

<p>"You shall have them. May I fasten a rose on
your dress,&mdash;your hideous dress, Roxalana, is it
not?"</p>

<p>Roxalana asked her if she was aware of its durable
quality. It promised to last a lifetime, and
what more could be expected of a dress?</p>

<p>"Roxalana, are you watching Tempe with the
hope that somebody will step on that stupid veil?
It is out of place over those curls and slender,
childlike arms."</p>

<p>"The Drakes brought it to her; I did not approve
of it."</p>

<p>"I am sure you said nothing to that effect."</p>

<p>"Why should I object? I think Tempe wished
to do all that was customary. I observe that John
is anxious to indulge her. Don't you think he is
an agreeable young man?"</p>

<p>Virginia did not think so, but avoided the question
and looked about her.</p>

<p>"Here comes my mother," she exclaimed,
"whom you scarcely know. I will give her my
seat and hope you will speak with her."</p>

<p>Roxalana put out her hand with an air of respect
to Mrs. Brande, and said, "I hope your health is
good."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande shook her head and her white
feather fan, and groaned. Then she chided Virginia
for being so long out of sight; complained of
the crowded rooms, the negligence of the waiters,
and the absence of Mr. Brande; and sat down,
eyeing Roxalana's dress and hair with a stiff surprise
which brought the color to the pale face of
Virginia, who turned her back, not wishing to see
Roxalana's confusion; but the latter was not to be
dismayed by criticism. How could Mrs. Gates
have allowed Tempe to marry while but a child, was
Mrs. Brande's first question, and Virginia, not
waiting for her reply, moved away and joined
Tempe, who happened to be standing alone at that
moment. John's particular friends, she said, had
gone into the supper-room, to drink his health.
Did Virginia know that she was to start on
a journey the next day? They were going to the
best hotels, and she supposed she should see more
dress than Kent had dreamed of. John had promised
to take her to the theatre. He was going to
buy at the first jeweler's shop a set of garnet and
gold; but she must first have her ears bored.
What age was Virginia when she put in earrings?
And how becoming the turquoise she wore to-night!&mdash;a
mass of fine pebbles round her neck,
arms, and in her comb!</p>

<p>Virginia replied quietly, but somehow felt out of
patience with her all at once; it seemed as if she
had fallen apart from Temple House,&mdash;dropping
what she had probably borrowed in its atmosphere&mdash;something
of its vigorous simplicity, to assume
the character of a parasite upon the Drakes.
Virginia was not able to judge her fairly then,
nor afterwards; for unless women are strongly
bound in love and sympathy, their different experiences
only serve to confuse their comprehension
of each other. Virginia made up her mind at
that moment that Tempe must be added to that list
of the weak and erratic to whom must be owed duty
and endurance.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" exclaimed Tempe at last,
having received no comment on her appearance;
"like a fright, I suppose. I wish the people would
go; my feet ache with standing to receive their
foolish compliments. I have had rivers of them
to-night."</p>

<p>"You are very pretty; but I do not like the
veil."</p>

<p>"I do," and Tempe tossed her little head, and
wreathed her slender arms. "Don't I look like the
Bride of Abydos? What is your mother covering
up my mother with her dove-colored silk skirt for.
Tsch!&mdash;here comes the old fuss, my papa Drake,
to introduce another booby. Do find John for me,
Virginia."</p>

<p>Virginia, tall and stately as a lily, swaying like
one as she yielded to the pressure of the crowd,
drifted into the center of a noisy, familiar group,
and found herself brushing against some person
taller than herself, who was also surrounded by
talkers. Half turning, her eyes followed the outlines
of a dark figure, whose handsome, well-gloved
hand was thrust behind him, and whose handsome,
well-booted foot was crushing her flounces. An
extraordinary push caused by the waiters and their
trays made them face each other with an apology.
It was Argus, and Virginia blushed at her own surprise
to see him a gentleman, in ordinary evening
costume. His cool smile flashed round his mouth,
although he, too, felt a vague, pleased surprise at
her aspect, she looked so perfectly a woman of
the world.</p>

<p>"Help me away from this beautiful lady I have
been talking with," he solicited. "Take my arm
and lead me away, so that I can regain composure."</p>

<p>They passed into a smaller room.</p>

<p>"You are used to these matters," he continued;
"I was not remembering till now that it is some
time since you left school." His eyes rested on
the bands of her silky, blue-black hair, and the
perfect outline of her face.</p>

<p>"You confound me with Tempe," she answered,
her shyness melting away in the atmosphere where
he professed to be a stranger.</p>

<p>"By no means. I saw Brande, your father, a
day after you were born; he cashed a note for me.
Is he here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"With the elders, who are drinking the heavy
port, which is the least like wine, and the most like
medicine, or matching pins with Drake, his brother
millionaire?"</p>

<p>"Shall we look for him?"</p>

<p>"I am quite comfortable with his daughter, who
will entertain me better."</p>

<p>"Tempe is going on a journey, she says. You
will miss her."</p>

<p>"I have just been speaking to that blonde
puppy, her husband, about it. I shall not suffer in
her absence. How do you think he will enjoy himself
in my society? They are to be with us, you know."</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry to hear that."</p>

<p>"Why are you sorry?"</p>

<p>"I like the house as it is; the intrusion of a
stranger may be a check to its freedom."</p>

<p>"Virginia, it is a whim of yours to like Roxalana.
You remind me of the old convent habit of
gay French women&mdash;their lover's oaths had a
new charm when they returned from their bread
and water, their wine a fresh sparkle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't hurt me."</p>

<p>His eyes blazed with a mischievous fire, it was
impossible, for all her control, not to show she
felt his glance.</p>

<p>"I like to hurt you," he said softly&mdash;his voice
had a caressing tone&mdash;oh so rare!</p>

<p>John Drake interrupted them; his bright hair
was disordered, his face deeply flushed, and his
gait very uncertain.</p>

<p>"Confound you," said Argus, "what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Virginia rose and drew John towards her.</p>

<p>"Come," she said "I want to see your mother's
cactus flowers; show them to me."</p>

<p>"To death's door. They are out on the piazza,
will you go there, delicate creature?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I need fresh air."</p>

<p>She placed her hand in his arm and steered him
into the portico.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. DRAKE was polite enough to send a note
to Argus, when Tempe had been gone two
weeks, which stated that John, for business reasons,
would extend his tour considerably; the young
couple in consequence would have an opportunity
to see the rapid growth of some of the mighty
cities of the West. A month, most likely, would
elapse before their return. Shortly after the note
was received, a letter came from Tempe,&mdash;her
first to her mother.</p>

<p>"DEAR MOTHER: You never saw such work;
we lost the small trunk, which was not marked.
Have you seen Virginia? Her society will make
amends for my absence. I wish I was at home,
but I like traveling. I saw somebody yesterday
that looked exactly like Mary Sutcliffe. I had half
a mind to ask her if the cat's kittens had yellow
patches, or if they were black and white: Mary
said the cat would have kittens by the time I got
back. You can't think how fish seems to be prized
at these hotels, while <i>we</i> care nothing for it. We
stopped in Boston, and John bought me an Indian
scarf. In New York he bought me a dark blue
silk; he is very attentive, but he has a cold. I had
it made, and it is trimmed with black lace. Mother,
the lace was three dollars a yard. We are in
Chicago now. The air has a flat taste to me; it is
different from Kent air. <i>Of course</i> Uncle Argus
has worried about me; oh yes, I think he is <i>pining</i>
away. There are no good preserves at any hotel;
the noise at these great houses, would drive you
wild, mother; you would never again wink your
eyes at my slamming doors, could you stay in one
awhile. Have those Drakes been to see you? I
do not care for them; do you, mother? I shall
visit them but little. John asked me if I would go
to housekeeping in warm weather. I said, 'Er,
em, em,' which meant 'yes' to him; to me, 'nary
housekeeping.' Why should I wash dishes for
him, and dust furniture, and learn <i>not</i> to suit him
in cooking&mdash;let me see, four times a day. He is
too particular about his food. Mother, I had
rather eat your dry bread; I hate to see people
imagining they would like to have this, and that, to
eat. I shall be gone some weeks yet. I'll help you
knit when I return. John has snatched this from
the table, and I am mad, for he laughs loud at it,
and says&mdash;'Give me a kiss?' but I won't. It is
eleven o'clock; there is no lamp burning in Temple
House; you are asleep.<br/>

Your affectionate child,<br/>

TEMPLE GATES."</p>

<p>"That's a great letter," said Argus; "so full of
observation."

<p>"I like it vastly," said Roxalana, with her infrequent
smile. "It is Tempe herself."</p>

<p>"So it is, Roxalana, you are right; especially in
forgetting her name."</p>

<p>The next news Mr. Drake presented in person.
He came hurriedly one evening, while Roxalana
and Argus were at tea, with a white, scared face,
bringing an open letter, at the top of which was an
engraving of a hotel.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Argus, rising and pushing a
chair towards him.</p>

<p>"There is an accident, sir," replied Mr. Drake.
"a dreadful one."</p>

<p>"Temple is all right," he said, addressing Roxalana;
"it is my son that is injured."</p>

<p>A bright smile burst over her face, and even
the iron countenance of Argus lightened.</p>

<p>"I say," cried Mr. Drake, in a loud, angry, tearless
voice, for he noticed the effect of his words,
"to <i>me</i> it is dreadful! What shall I do? I can
not leave my business, and John's case is hopeless."
He looked down at the letter; and his voice failed
him. Argus took it, to read that a collision had occurred
on some Western railroad; that John was
one of the victims; that he had been taken to a
way town, and was now in the hotel, which the
letter pictured; and that his friends must lose no
time in reaching him, for his injuries were fatal.</p>

<p>"You must go, Argus," said Roxalana; "no
preparation is necessary. Will that suit you, Mr.
Drake?"</p>

<p>"Bring him home, sir, bring him home," said Mr.
Drake, his tears falling. "My wife fell down in a
fit, for she opened the letter. You could not take
her; my girls would be simply an encumbrance. If
you go, it must be alone. I thank you for the
favor, sir. What can I do to forward the
journey?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; I shall leave at once. Mat Sutcliffe
will drive me to Wing's Station, and I can catch
the down train."</p>

<p>Roxalana felt it impossible to make any condoling
speech to Mr. Drake; she perceived his trouble
but could not sympathize with it, her relief at
Tempe's escape was so great. Moreover, while
hearing of John's disaster, she discovered that she
felt no real interest in him, and was too sincere to
express any grief. Neither had she any thought
of the influence this event might have upon Tempe;
the dear illusions of sentiment, the hopes or desires
which continually ascend from the depths of the
soul when it must live in solitude, found no resting-place
in Roxalana. Neither did Argus make
any moral or philosophical remarks upon the disaster;
with a silent, natural respect he opened the
doors for Mr. Drake to pass out, and accompanied
him to the gate, holding his hat in his hands. Had
it been any man besides Argus, Mr. Drake would
have attempted some utterance concerning the mysterious
ways of Providence; as it was, he concluded
the interview with a request concerning his
son, and parted from Argus with some appearance
of firmness and composure.</p>

<p>Within an hour, Argus and Mat Sutcliffe were
riding along a road which crossed Apsley River just
below the Forge.</p>

<p>"Talk about the treachery of the sea!" exclaimed
Mat, in a triumphant tone, "what is't compared to
the continual accidents on shore? If the sea mauls
and maims us, 'tisn't above board; we are not
strewed along the ground to excite the pity
and horror of folks, but we are dragged under,
out of sight, where the affair is between ourselves."</p>

<p>"The drowned do not always stay at the bottom
of the deep."</p>

<p>"I know they get into coves, and sometimes drift
in along shore, but they don't make spectacles for
a multitude. So all the fol-de-rol I saw the other
day has come to nothing in less than two months.
Well, shall I be waiting for you and Tempe at
Wing's? I'll go along, and help you shoulder up
the young feller, if you say so."</p>

<p>"He is dead, now. Mat."</p>

<p>"The poor little gal!"</p>

<p>"Death must wake us up now and then."</p>

<p>"They are fired up at the Forge, I see."</p>

<p>"Brande is forging anchors."</p>

<p>As they passed from the darkness into the wake
of light gleaming from a furnace door, Virginia
came into the mind of Argus, looking as she did
on the night of Tempe's wedding, in her cloud-like
dress,&mdash;tall, fair, and self-collected, with soft,
radiant, umber-colored eyes, tinted like a summer-brook,&mdash;"the
leopard rill," when it flows from
beneath the alders and oaks, which bend over and
conceal its course. He looked at the house, which
loomed up beyond the Forge.</p>

<p>"I'll let her know, right off," said Mat.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to the house?"</p>

<p>"No; but they know me on the premises. I'll
speak to the foreman."</p>

<p>"Stop at the house on your way back, and ask
Mrs. Brande, with my respects, to allow Miss
Brande to go to Mrs. Gates."</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"And look in every day, will you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so."</p>

<p>Mat flourished his whip, proud to be commissioned
by Argus, and venting his feelings by putting
the horse at top speed. At the station he
grew melancholy, and followed the locomotive till
it screamed itself out of sight. On the way home
he wished for his dogs, his boys, his wife, he was
so uncommonly downhearted. Knocking at Mrs.
Brande's back door, his thoughts diverted by a
disagreeable expectation that Mr. or Mrs. Brande
might open the door, he was glad to see Chloe, a
colored member of the family.</p>

<p>"Lord, save me, what kind of a time o' night is
this for bizness?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have an errand to Mrs. Brande, your marm."</p>

<p>"Nothing would make Missis Brande get up at
this time in the evening, I assure you. Better
speak to Miss Virginia; she's tuing round somewhere.
Come in, and say what you want to say."</p>

<p>"Can I take a bite of fire meanwhile? It's
coolish, to-night."</p>

<p>"I look for a frost. Address yourself to the heat,
though the fire is most down."</p>

<p>When he had delivered his message, Virginia for
a moment was strongly tempted to go with him at
once; but it could not be.</p>

<p>"I shall have to stay with mother till she falls
asleep; and <i>when</i> will she fall asleep?"</p>

<p>"I could a-tole the man the same," muttered
Chloe, "but he wouldn't a-gone if I had."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gates is alone," said Mat doggedly, "and
I expect choke full of trouble."</p>

<p>He knew better, and could not help raising his
eyes to Virginia; they exchanged faint smiles.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" Chloe commented; "they larf
together,&mdash;and he is back-door folks."</p>

<p>"Chloe," said Virginia, in an under tone, and
handing her a key, "bring me some wine."</p>

<p>"I can't a-bear wine," said Mat quickly.</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Brandy."</p>

<p>"Bring that, Chloe."</p>

<p>Mat had scarcely set his glass down when Mr.
Brande came suddenly into the kitchen, with a lamp
in his hand; he had heard Mat's gruff voice in
the room where he was reading.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Virginia?"</p>

<p>She told him the tidings. Mr. Brande advanced
so near with his lamp to Mat's whiskers the latter
exclaimed: "You'll know me next time."</p>

<p>"I do not know much good of you at any time,
my man," Mr. Brande replied meekly.</p>

<p>"He was sent here, father, with the request that
I should go down to Mrs. Gates."</p>

<p>"Who sent for you?"</p>

<p>"Captain Argus Gates," answered Mat.</p>

<p>"To-morrow she may be permitted to go, if her
mother's health is good."</p>

<p>Mat retreated, with a glance at Virginia, which
signified that whatever he thought of her father, it
was all right between <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>"Virginia," said Mr. Brande, "you are at Temple
House often."</p>

<p>"Not o'nights, certain," interposed Chloe. "I'm
a sinner if she ain't a-waitin' too much on the missis
for many visits."</p>

<p>"Sho, sho! Chloe, you astonish me," answered
Mr. Brande, retreating.</p>

<p>"Your father has not been astonished these
twenty years, missey. Can't ye get to bed, honey?
Why won't missis let my old bones crackle about
for her instead of wearing the soft peth of yours?"</p>

<p>But Virginia, who was not heeding her, sighed,
and walked across the room with her head bent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "I should have offered to
go to Tempe; who else could? Had I power beyond
these little things I could define noble duties.
As it is"&mdash;She was gone.</p>

<p>"I'se most tired of this world, especially when I
see men and woman as I have this last five minutes.
It's no use, though," continued Chloe; "Missey
Virginia will have to help missis out of the grave
when Gabriel blows the trump, I'll bet, while Mr.
Brande is walking, 'spectable like, in long clothes,
all by hisself, to judgment."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p>ARGUS found Tempe alone. Her pretty locks
looked dull and dry, and her great eyes were
heavy with watching and weeping. For the first
time within her recollection Argus kissed her;
then she crept into his arms, laid her head against
his breast and fell into a deep sleep. He sat like a
statue, noting the faint regularity of her breath,
wondering how much of a ripple so frail a being
could raise on the sea of life, when she woke and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Will Mr. Drake come afterwards, to take the&mdash;the&mdash;John,
I mean, and bury him in the family
burying-place?"</p>

<p>"He sent me for that purpose, Tempe; you must
finish the journey, as you began it&mdash;with a difference."
Then she wept afresh, dreading to go, in
such an awful way, for&mdash;

<div class="center">

"There's plaited linen round his head<br/>

While foremost go his feet,<br/>

His feet that can not carry him."

</div>

<p>He wiped her eyes with his handkerchief, beginning
to feel a little impatience, which she perceived,
and was restored to herself as if by electricity.
She told Argus all that had happened in a few
words, and repeated John's wishes. He would
have made a will had it been possible, for he felt
more anxious about making provision for her, than
to prepare for his last moments. He was nearer to
God, he said, than she was, and would soon be entirely
cared for, while she,&mdash;who could give her
money? Continual wandering of mind and fainting
turns had prevented him from making even
the slightest arrangement; and, concluded Tempe,
"He was dead, after all my watching, before I
knew it."</p>

<p>"I am to have you again entirely," said Argus;
"there is no help for it. You are returned to me
with the addition of 'Drake,' to your name."</p>

<p>"Remarkably short experiment, my wedded life.
Uncle Argus."</p>

<p>"What induced your little bran-stuffed brains to
marry? Do you remember a picture in your
school-book of a Serene Monster, behind whom
rose a dreary, flat, lifeless desert, whose horizon
receded as the eye sought it? Did you know
that the desert was matrimony? And the monster
pretended the riddle of it could be propounded?"</p>

<p>"I did not want any other girl to have him, and
it pleased me to take him from his mother and sisters.
I suppose they think I am punished."</p>

<p>The old provocation came across Argus to throw
his cane at her.</p>

<p>"You stand next to your father in nature, who
let the jaws of chance crack him as if he had been
a filbert. Let me tell you once and for all, not to
be foolhardy again and sacrifice those connected
with you."</p>

<p>"If you have come all the way from Kent to
scold at me, let us sit, Uncle Argus, and have it
out; other matters may take their course."</p>

<p>She sat down composedly, and fixed her eyes on
him in away that made him laugh.</p>

<p>"I am a poor deputy; your mother or Virginia
should have come for you, with salve and balsam.
Are you prepared to leave at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Argus, I am ready."</p>

<p>A public funeral was in preparation at home;
Tempe went to Mr. Drake's, and soon felt the restrictions
of her position. The dramatic grief,
bustle, and solicitude of the family concerning the
event swallowed up Tempe's personal concern in it:
her curiosity and attention were so absorbed that
the few hours passed there afterwards seemed days
to her.</p>

<p>Argus shut himself up at home with Roxalana,
and both declined a place in the Drake procession.
Virginia Brande alone went to see Tempe, and was
received with the impassiveness belonging to her as
Miss Brande, by the Drakes.</p>

<p>"I haven't cried a bit since I came," said Tempe,
when they were left together for a moment. "Mrs.
Drake cries into her cups of tea, which are being
brought her all the time, and the girls sob and
groan, and stare into their handkerchiefs, and then
run upstairs to see how the three dressmakers are
getting on."</p>

<p>Virginia's eyes were fixed on Tempe; she earnestly
desired to find some index to guide her into
a way of speech to prove a solace and help.</p>

<p>"Dear child," she began, but Tempe interrupted
her.</p>

<p>"Uncle Argus fled from this scene,&mdash;do you wonder?
I don't. Did you ever see anything more
foolish than the Drakes? It all seems like a show
to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tempe, can't you see anything behind this
effect? I am sure there is heart in it."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe that the <i>son</i> and the <i>brother</i>
will survive all this poor pomp and worry? Hereafter
some pleasant image will come and dwell
with the mother and sisters,&mdash;a shape that will sit
in sweet and solemn quiet with them, when apart
from their worldly selves. Be wise and patient,
Tempe; consider how different people are. The
mental picture every outward act presents differs
in every mind&mdash;unless&mdash;as it seems to be
the case with you, we act without interior motive.
You never have referred these matters to
the judgment of the one Solitary Spectator, have
you?"</p>

<p>Tempe slightly shrugged her shoulders, and Virginia
blushed painfully, as if she had inflicted a
blow upon herself, but continued:</p>

<p>"To one-half the world your mother would be
very inarticulate; but you know that all her nature
is waiting for the moment of your return."</p>

<p>Even Virginia, in her way, was driven to preach
to Tempe, as Argus had been in his, but one sermon
made as much impression as the other;
Tempe was musing as she ceased speaking, and
then absently exclaimed:</p>

<p>"In doing all in his power to please me, he was
pleased and happy; there's a fact. There they
are on the stairs&mdash;those creatures. Do you know,
Virginia, they speak to me, and of me, as a pronoun?"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p>ON the third day after Tempe's return to Kent,
Mr. Drake's coachman drove her home.</p>

<p>"We shall see you soon," said the Drake family
at parting.</p>

<p>"I shall see you often, of course," Tempe replied;
but, her face set homeward, the conviction
that a final separation had taken place between
them settled in her mind without a regret. As
she walked up the path she queried whether it was
her heavy mourning dress or the atmosphere
which was freighted with a storm, that made her
feel as if she were taking a wearisome burden
along. She pushed open the door of the green
room, and, burden or no burden, saw Argus and
her mother in the old place and attitude. Like a
wounded child, her lips quivered, but resolutely
beating back the rush of tears that burnt her eyelids,
she ended the struggle with a smile, and
cried:</p>

<p>"This is an agreeable world, mother. I have
been journeying in it, and here I am again."</p>

<p>Roxalana rose stiffly from her seat; shook Tempe's
hand vehemently; stared at her with strange, sad
eyes, and resumed her seat without speaking.</p>

<p>Argus eyed Tempe's crape with disgust.</p>

<p>"Take off those badges now," he said; "the
disconsolate is not becoming."</p>

<p>"Do," begged her mother, "do leave off those
weeds; I detest them&mdash;they will be as irksome as
convalescence to you. It is a poor custom to
brood upon the dead, in changed garments; when
one goes back to the old style, the dead are put
aside. Why should any fashion or departure be
made for them?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Argus, throwing his half-smoked
cigar into the fire. "What would become
of the ancient and respectable institution of monuments
and epitaphs,&mdash;those final and selfish compliments,&mdash;if
we followed your fancies?"</p>

<p>"Mother," said Tempe, "I shall wear black all
my days; I am sure it is the least I can do."</p>

<p>She caught the inquiring, sarcastic smile with
which Argus regarded her, and sat down, pulling
off her gloves and bonnet. The reception she received,
so cool, and undemonstrative, as if nothing
had happened, set her thoughts upon the wonderful
talent of self-ownership which belonged to
Argus and Roxalana. She comprehended now
why they seemed superior to the persons she had
lately been intimate with; their outside possessions
weighed nothing in comparison to that instinct
of self-possession so well developed!</p>

<p>"Argus," said Roxalana, "attend to the fire;
Tempe may be taking cold."</p>

<p>"The fire is a rousing one, and does not need a
splinter even."</p>

<p>While the evening was passing as usual Tempe
stole off to bed. There were women who would,
having borne what she had, upon re-entering that
chamber have felt their sharpest misery; who would
have been tormented with baffled desire,&mdash;a remorse
at not having improved the moments of
sympathy and endearment which only yesterday
was possible, to-day impossible. Women alive in
every fibre, crushed with the belief of an eternal
separation from love, who would have groveled in
an ecstasy of despair, washed out the vivid colors
of the past with floods of tears or battled away the
memory of their joys behind the shield of resignation;
who would have propped the ruined present
with prayers and vows, beseeching God to hold the
loosened tendrils of their useless affections. Not
so with Tempe. She stepped across the threshold
without dread or agitation, but a sudden howl of the
wind at the loose old casements made her turn her
eyes towards the blank, curtainless windows, and
shiver. Placing the lamp near the glass, she shrank
from catching a sight of herself, and moved away
with wandering eyes, which at last fell on the stuffed
red and green macaw, fastened to a mahogany
perch against the wall. Her thoughts traveled back
to the time when she tried to pull out some of its
feathers, years ago, and the interval did not seem
much longer than her marriage day.</p>

<p>"<i>Married!</i>" she whispered, with a feeling of
consternation, holding her left hand up to see the
ring. With nervous haste she dropped it in a
drawer, hoping she had prevented the danger of
bad dreams. Roxalana found her sound asleep,
with her head on the edge of the drawer.</p>

<p>"Come, Tempe, creep into bed beside me; I have
missed you, lately. There is your night-gown; let
me unfasten your dress."</p>

<p>Tempe submitted with a yawn, and then woke up
enough to ask a hundred questions concerning the
past six weeks. It was midnight before the two
widows slept.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE severity of the weather rather than the state
of her mind kept Tempe within doors for several
weeks. Outside the snow, consolidated by repeated
storms, settled round the foundations of the
house, and spread a thick, icy sheet over the
grounds, binding all things under its white silence.
Inside, the silence was almost as absolute: Tempe
more than once observed, "You might cut it
with a knife." Her occupation was confined to
keeping herself warm, and the stripping of carpet
rags for Roxalana's rugs. Virginia Brande could
no longer come by the Forge path, but rode through
town to visit them: Mrs. Brande occasionally dispensed
with her attentions, and allowed her to
stay several hours. After these visits, despite the
monotonous winter landscape locked in frost, it
seemed to Virginia as if she traveled home on a
rainbow, which flushing Argus's door, faded when
she reached her own. Could the green room, and
the limited scope of Argus, Roxalana and Tempe&mdash;contracted
beings, whose existence appeared as
monotonous as the gray, wintry sky&mdash;have suggested
it?</p>

<p>"Missey," asked Chloe, one day upon her return
from Temple House, "How does they contrive to
keep that old barn warm enough to live in?"</p>

<p>"Chloe, I am surprised at you," she answered in
an injured tone. "It is warmer than our house, and
the heat is more pleasant."</p>

<p>"I have surprised missey," said Chloe, laughing
loud, "but she knows that no man, woman, or chile
can keep warm in Argus Gates's house. Why, he
is an icicle himself."</p>

<p>Virginia observing Chloe as she adjusted the polished
fire-irons of the polished, handsome grate,
contrasted it with the fireside of Temple House; she
pictured Argus thrusting the embers against the
brass dogs in the deep jambs of the chimney, and
Roxalana watching the fitful blaze, while Tempe,
wrapped in a shawl, pretended to be suffocated
with the smoke, which the wind, roaring down the
chimney, sent into the room in little puffs.</p>

<p>"I like the smell of a wood fire," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ashes is beautiful, to litter up a nice hearth.
and smoke is wholesome for&mdash;ham," Chloe replied.</p>

<p>Of late, when the days were cold, and she visited
Temple House, Argus had asked for coffee,
and brought it to her in the egg-shell china cups
she thought so beautiful; the last time he handed
one he spilled the coffee on her dress.</p>

<p>"I wish I had my wine-colored cashmere on today,
Chloe!"</p>

<p>"I wonder at that; the dress is a month old.
Missis has moved these yer vases, while nobody was
here; I wish she wouldn't move every piece of furniture
about, when she is left alone."</p>

<p>"I wish there were coffee cups instead."</p>

<p>"The closet is ram jam full of coffee cups; don't
follow missis, now, and put a row up here. Massy!
if she hasn't put the books in upside down!"</p>

<p>Virginia glanced at a stately book-case, filled
with religious memoirs and commentaries.</p>

<p>"I would rather have a British classic than these
solid pounds of mind."</p>

<p>"So would I, indeed," Chloe replied, taken with
the title; "how big be they?"</p>

<p>Virginia smiled absently, and said, "He often
has one in his hand."</p>

<p>"Missey, you are coming down with a cold, sure.
Were you up last night much? Scuttle to your
room now you have a chance; I'll hold up the
house."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Chloe, but it rests me to stay with
you. Do you mind my dropping to pieces for a
few minutes? Tell me, Chloe, why am I more free
with you, poor soul, than with anybody else?</p>

<p>While she spoke Chloe moved a hearth-brush to
and fro, as if she heard music.</p>

<p>"I hope the Lord knows," she replied, "I don't;
I know nothing at all,&mdash;never did,&mdash;hope I never
shall!"</p>

<p>"Hear me breathe, Chloe."</p>

<p>And Virginia sighed from the bottom of her
heart. Then she walked rapidly across the room,
with parted lips and hands knit together; her
warm, brown eyes were full of sweet feeling, her attitude
was beseeching.</p>

<p>"I dare the Brandes to come in now," muttered
Chloe; "they must see she belongs to the world's
people, after all." And her ears were on the alert
for the slightest sound without.</p>

<p>"What?" said Virginia sharply, her manner
changing. "I must go to mother. I have not forgot
how long I since left her."</p>

<p>Chloe groaned.</p>

<p>"My mother was a Gay Head Indian," she said,
"I am half Indian too; that's what makes my hair
straight. Please excuse my bad blood, and let me
advise you. Miss Virginny,&mdash;don't take on so about
your damn worthless mother."</p>

<p>Virginia put her hand over Chloe's mouth and
passed out.</p>

<p>No other visit or disturbed Tempe's monotony
for a long time, except Mr. Drake, who made one
nervous call to inquire about her health, and present
her with a dozen oranges. She also received
several notes from Caroline, which she endeavored
to answer with the spirit they were written in, but
falling short of it, sent no replies. When one's
atmosphere is monotonous the scythe of time
seems stationary; even the hours stand still against
its edge: cloudless summer days, with their unsparing
sunshine, starless shadows, and soundless
airs, at last grow to be wearisome. So with the
present ice-bound season, which Tempe fancied
held her in thrall. Even Argus and Roxalana began
to mention spring. Virginia alone would have
prolonged the period, which, according to her belief,
she thought providential in her behalf.</p>

<p>Mat Sutcliffe announced to Argus one morning
that spring had come. The ice on the shores and
inside the bay was giving way. And he asked Argus
if gales were not to be looked for? They compared
notes about the weather, and concluded to
look for southerly storms.</p>

<p>The weather softened so that very day that
Tempe threw aside her shawl, and Roxalana made
the tour of all the rooms, and by way of a walk went
up to the attic to look over the fields and bay. She
remarked to Argus, on coming down, that she had
never seen the White Flat so plainly; it appeared
to be stretching across the harbor's mouth.</p>

<p>"The ice made it look so, probably," he replied.</p>

<p>The snow around the house began to melt, and
in the stillness they heard the water trickling everywhere.</p>

<p>"Soon," said Roxalana, "the buds will begin to
swell."</p>

<p>At sunset the atmosphere was spongy and rotten.
Masses of vapor rolled up from the south, extinguishing
a pale brassy band of light in the west;
and a strange wind rose in the upper air, and
closed with night.</p>

<p>Early in the evening Argus shook the iron bars
of the shutters on the harbor side, and fastened
them; he foresaw the storm, and would have shut
out its fury for Roxalana's sake, who appeared perturbed
and melancholy as if disasters at sea were
threatened.</p>

<p>"The wind must be rising," she said, holding
up her hand; "I feel streams of air from everywhere.
The candles flare: but I don't hear the
surf."</p>

<p>"You will hear it presently," he replied.</p>

<p>"I don't care if it blows half the town down,"
said Tempe.</p>

<p>"Don't spare the other half; let the whole go,
and be damned, if you wish so," he answered.</p>

<p>A tremendous hiss passed through the crevices
of the outer doors, which was met by a roar in
the chimney. An irruption of white flaky ashes
followed and covered the hearth. Next, the roof
and walls of the house were taken as a coign of
vantage by the shrieking wind to hang out its viewless
banners, which shivered, flapped, and tore to
tatters in raging impotence.</p>

<p>"We must put out this fire, Argus," said
Roxalana, "or we shall be on fire inside the
house."</p>

<p>"Better put yourselves in bed; I will take care
of the fire."</p>

<p>Acting upon this suggestion, they left him alone.
A short time afterwards he went out on the lawn.
The dull thunder of the surf now broke so furiously
on the bar that the ground beneath his feet reverberated.</p>

<p>"The bay is champing its jaws on that devilish
White Flat, and any sail coming this way is lost."</p>

<p>Looking overhead he discovered in the milky
darkness of the obscured moon deep vague rifts in
the sky, like the chasm in Orion. The frenzied,
over-driven spirits of the storm took refuge in the
piling tumbling folds of the clouds, which hovered
over and fell into the abyss. While he stood there,
the elms bowed from bole to topmost bough, and
brushed his face as if they paid him homage. No
sound came from the town side; he could not see a
single light. Opposite the lawn King's Hill reared
its black summit; from thence, if he climbed, he
could obtain a view of the wailing, howling bay,
and,&mdash;perchance of some vessel seeking harbor.
He preferred to go back and shut himself up in
the house.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p>THOUGH the storm raged the next morning
as storm had not raged for years, Argus remained
in the green room, and pored over the book
of plays, so well remembered by Virginia. About
noon Mat Sutcliffe burst in, with his tarpaulin
jammed over his head, and carrying an immense spy-glass
in a canvas case. His tidings did not astonish
Argus. A vessel putting into the bay the night
before had dragged her anchors and struck on the
White Flat; her flag was flying from the rigging,
and there were men there; it being low water
when she struck, her quarter-deck might afford
temporary safety, provided the cold did not increase
and freeze the crew to death.</p>

<p>"What is the town doing. Mat?" asked Roxalana.</p>

<p>"A great many people are out doing nothing.
They are on the wharves, on the top of King's
Hill, the hair blowing off their heads, and, I believe,
there's a gang along shore somewhere," he replied.</p>

<p>"No boat can live if put out," said Argus.
"How low down the bar did the vessel drive on?"</p>

<p>"As near to Bass Headland as can be. If the
wind would chop round, somebody might get out
there."</p>

<p>"So the sailors must drown," cried Tempe, notwithstanding
she had put her fingers in her ears,
not to hear. "I'll shut myself up in the cellar till
it is all over."</p>

<p>"I thought," continued Mat, looking hard at
Argus, "it might be best to look at the shingle
below here; the ice is about gone there. If we
could start under the lee of Bass Headland a boat
might slant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Argus gave such a shrug and grimace that Mat
suddenly stopped, and without another word abruptly
left the room.</p>

<p>"Argus," said Roxalana, with great composure,
"I shall not get you a mouthful of dinner to-day."</p>

<p>"I trust you will consent to do your share in
disposing of the poor corpses," added Tempe
sharply.</p>

<p>For reply, Argus rose, book in hand, opened the
shutter of the window towards the quay, sat down
by it, and went on with his comedy.</p>

<p>Tempe telegraphed to her mother her opinion
that he was a beast of an uncle, and even Roxalana
was moved to eye him with a mild, doubting
severity.</p>

<p>But he was on the alert. When he heard drops
of rain splash on the window ledge, he shut his
fingers in his book, and looked into the fire. A
shower came down, which was neither hail, nor
snow, but warm rain. He started up, stretched his
arms, like one who had long been cramped and
weary, and sat down again with an indifferent air,
and opened his book.</p>

<p>Roxalana came in from the kitchen, and said
that the vane on the summer-house had veered
slightly, and there was less noise from the wind.</p>

<p>"The gale is moderating, luckily."</p>

<p>Something in his tone struck her. She raised
her eyes to his, and he smiled ironically; it made
her feel like asking his pardon.</p>

<p>"Can I have any dinner?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think so; what shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Brandy and cigars."</p>

<p>She disappeared.</p>

<p>Mat came in late in the afternoon, with as little
ceremony as before, and said roughly to Argus,
"You are wanted."</p>

<p>"I won't go."</p>

<p>"Captain, if we don't get across within twelve
hours, every soul on board that vessel now will be
in hell."</p>

<p>"I supposed so."</p>

<p>"She's bilged, and the White Flat begins to hug
her. It's flood tide, and the waves must be washing
the main deck; a few hours of that work will
settle their hash."</p>

<p>"What's doing with the life-boat?"</p>

<p>"The loons have tried to launch her, but there's
something wrong, and they are trying to tinker her
up. The will of folks is good enough, but they
can't get out there,&mdash;that's the long and short on't.
Bill Bayley swore he'd go out alone; his cock-boat
swamped first thing, and they had to throw him a
rope. He swore at the man who threw it,&mdash;at the
boat,&mdash;at the bay,&mdash;the wreck,&mdash;and the Almighty,
and then he cried. I never liked Bill so well."</p>

<p>Mat spit into the fire furiously, and stumped
round the room, a shoe on one foot and a boot on
the other, his trowsers settling over his hips in spite
of his tight leather belt. He was growing frantic
with excitement.</p>

<p>Argus laughed.</p>

<p>Mat made an energetic, beseeching motion
towards the door; he would have put up his soul
for sale for the sake of seeing Argus move with
the intention he wished to inspire him with. Argus
turned back his sleeves, baring a snow-white wrist,
and abstractedly felt his pulse and the muscles of
his arms.</p>

<p>"Push ahead," he said.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," Mat shouted, turning very pale,
and lurching towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stop; where is Roxalana?"</p>

<p>"Roxalana!" Mat shouted.</p>

<p>"What is it. Mat?" she answered, coming with
a bottle.</p>

<p>"Yes; give us a dram, old girl," continued Mat,
utterly oblivious of the proprieties.</p>

<p>Argus laughed again, and asked for his mackintosh.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Mat, having swallowed nearly
a tumbler of brandy. Argus drank a little, and
poured the rest of the bottle into a flask which he
buttoned inside his coat. Tempe ran down to the
door as they passed out, and Argus looking back
called out:</p>

<p>"Where is your crape veil, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"Where the courage of Kent is,&mdash;shut up in a
band-box," she answered.</p>

<p>Roxalana, after gazing at her a moment, took
her by the arm, and dragged her into the green
room.</p>

<p>"I believe," she said, in a breathless undertone.
"that you are possessed sometimes. Do you know
that your uncle Argus may have gone for his
shroud?"</p>

<p>"Was that why he inquired for the veil?"</p>

<p>"Could you choose no other moment to express
your insensibility? Are you never to be anything
but a child?"</p>

<p>"Mother, you must be crazy. You don't mean
to say that you are going to protest against the
Gates character,&mdash;as <i>I</i> represent it?"</p>

<p>Roxalana said no more, but went her way, feeling
a painful excitement. She replenished the
fires, hung kettles of water over them, collected
blankets, cordials, and liquors, and then went to
the kitchen to bake bread.</p>

<p>Twilight brought Mary Sutcliffe and her youngest
boys. Dumping them in a corner of the kitchen
as if they were sacks, and threatening them with a
whipping if they moved, she rolled up her sleeves,
and said that she thought the fathers of families
had better stay at home, instead of risking themselves
to save nobody knew who. Another boat
had started since Mat had got under way, and she
guessed the wreck would turn out to be a great
cry and little wool; she did not think there would
be much drowning this time. She wondered if the
good folks in Kent had stirred themselves,&mdash;your
religious Drakes, and your pious Brandes, and the
rest of the church.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Mary Sutcliffe," ordered
Tempe.</p>

<p>Then Mary whimpered, sobbed, and shrieked,
declaring she had known all along she should never
set eyes on Mat Sutcliffe again, who was well
enough, considering what he was. And who else
would have done what he was doing? and she
gloried in his spunk. Drying her eyes with her
fat hands, and shaking out her apron, she begged
Roxalana to let her make the bread, and put the
house to rights,&mdash;in case there were bodies coming
in.</p>

<p>"Do, Mrs. Gates," she pleaded, "I feel as strong
as a giant to-night: I can wrestle with any amount
of work."</p>

<p>"If you will stop whining, Mary, I will accept
your services; for, to tell the truth, my head is not
very clear just now; I am afraid I may spoil
something."</p>

<p>"Likely as not," replied Mary; "go right into
your sitting-room, sit down in your own chair, and
you'll come to. It won't do for you, of all persons,
to be upset, Mrs. Gates."</p>

<p>Roxalana was quite ready to act upon Mary's
suggestion. Death was near, and she felt it.
After dark Mary began to walk about,&mdash;to the
alley, and into the garden, and report what she
saw and heard. She ran down to the quay once,
but came back scared and subdued at the sight of
the angry solitude of the hoarse, black sea, though
she shook her impotent fist at it with indignation.</p>

<p>Roxalana felt a relief when Virginia Brande
came down from the Forge, enveloped in a
great cloak. She ventured to come by the
path, the moment she heard that Captain Gates
was making an attempt to get to the wreck. Her
mother was so frightened and ill about it that
Chloe and herself were obliged to make representations
of the necessity for help in Kent from
every hand and heart, before she consented to
spare her. The Forge was deserted; her father
had gone into town with the intention of offering
a reward to the man who should first reach the
wreck. Mary Sutcliffe, hearing this, cried:</p>

<p>"And I suppose old Drake has offered as much
again,&mdash;hasn't he? Wouldn't I like to see Mr.
Mat Sutcliffe Esquire handling that reward? I
wish somebody would pay me for doing my duty.
I'd put the money right into the contribution box
at Mr. Brande's church. Oh yes, don't I see myself
doing it."</p>

<p>"Mary," said Virginia, "you are talking nonsense.
Please find some hair-pins; mine must
have dropped along the path."</p>

<p>She removed the cloakhood, and her hair
tumbled in a mass down her shoulders; she could
have hid herself in it.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" cried Mary, "what splendid
hair you've got! I never thought of it before. It
is as black as the sky was just now on the quay."</p>

<p>"Have you been to the quay, Mary?" asked
Roxalana. "Do content yourself within doors.
Where is Tempe?"</p>

<p>"I saw her kiting upstairs just now. If she
does not take care she'll keel over. It is as true
as the gospel, that she has got a look in her
face as new as a drop of cream would be to my
cat."</p>

<p>"Go and tell her that Virginia Brande is here,
and she will come back."</p>

<p>"I have always thought," Mary replied, sticking
a pin between her teeth, and allowing her eyes to
take a reflective cast, "that it was as much as my
life was worth to interfere with the way of a Gates;
but I may change my mind. I'll go right after
Tempe. Oh Lord-a-mercy, where do you think
the two creatures are by this time? Sho: I know
they will be along soon; it is not likely that Captain
Argus Gates is going to be lost at sea, after he
has given up going to sea; and,&mdash;it would be foolish
to suppose that Mat Sutcliffe will venture more
than getting his boots soaked through."</p>

<p>"Hair-pins, please," said Virginia.</p>

<p>Roxalana asked again, "Where is Tempe? Virginia
Brande is here."</p>

<p>Tempe fell into a fit of weeping and laughing
the moment she saw Virginia, which was ended by
a dead faint.</p>

<p>At last the boat was launched. Argus and Mat
were afloat; so much was gained, and Argus
thought the danger was preferable to the labor
they had undergone in getting ready to risk their
lives. The gloomy twilight, spreading from the
east, dropped along the shore while they were
dragging, pushing, and lifting the boat over the
shingle, slush, and into the opposing sea.</p>

<p>"Hell bent be it!" said Mat, apostrophizing the
waves, "if you say so. You are not alone, my
friends."</p>

<p>Mat seemed a part of the storm; his spirits
were in a wild commotion, his clothes were torn
and soggy with brine, and his hands were gashed
and bloody. Argus had lost his cap, and broken
his oar; he bound his head with Mat's woolen
comforter, jammed his shoulder against the gunwale,
and used the shortened oar with much composure.
They did not make much headway; the
boat was riding in all directions in the roar and
foam of the sea; darkness pressed upon them,
they were shut between the low-hanging sky
and the shaking plain of water. In the midst of
his silent, measured, energetic action the thoughts
of Argus drifted idly back to the trifling events of
his life; a new and surprising charm was added to
them; as bright, quiet, and warm as the golden
dust of a summer sunset which touches everything
as it vanishes.</p>

<p>Mat swore at the top of his voice, that the wind
was more nor'rard, and it would be an even
chance about beating&mdash;or not. Argus looked up,
and saw a circular break in the clouds, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"By the crucifix," cried Mat, throwing himself
forward, "I heard a yell. Where away are we?
We are shoaling!"</p>

<p>Argus plunged his hands into the water from the
stern-sheets; it felt like the wrinkled, hideous
flesh of a monster, trying to creep away.</p>

<p>"We are under lee or there is a lull, for the
water don't break," he said. "If the moon was
out we should see the White Flat. I reckon we
are on the tongue of the bar, and the vessel has
struck below. Her hull must be sunk ten feet by
this time, and her shrouds and spars are washed
off; that yell will not be heard again."</p>

<p>"Damn 'em," said Mat savagely, "if they have
drowned afore ever we could reach 'em. I'll take
'em dead, carry every mother's son of 'em to Kent,
and bury 'em against their wills."</p>

<p>The endless, steady-going rockers which slid
under them from the bay outside tossed the boat
no longer; the wind ceased to smite their faces,
but tore overhead and ripped the clouds apart.
The moon rolled out, and to the right they saw the
ghastly, narrow crest of the White Flat. A mass
of spume on their left which hissed madly proved
what Argus had said&mdash;that they were close to the
end of the bar. Within the limits of the moonlight
they saw nothing. In the bewildering, darkling
illumination of the shattering water around
them they were alone.</p>

<p>"If she's parted," continued Mat, "something
might wash this way; her gear at least. I'd like
to catch a cabin door, or an article to that effect, it
might come handy."</p>

<p>Argus did not hear him, for he was overboard.
Missing him, Mat gave way for a moment; he felt
the keel shove resisting sand, and remained passive,
merely muttering, "I'm blasted, but she may
drive."</p>

<p>Argus had seen, or thought he had, to the right
of the boat, some object dipping in and out of the
water and making toward them. He met it coming
sideways, where the water was just below his
breast; missed a hold of it, struggled for it, the
shifting bottom impeding his footway, and the
water battled against his head and arms, till rearing
itself up and stranding on the beach, he stumbled
and fell beside it exhausted.</p>

<p>Raising himself on his hands and knees, he
brought his face close to two persons, a man and a
woman, fastened together by the embrace of death.
The woman's face was upturned; its white oval,
wet and glistening, shed a horrid light; the repeated
blows of the murderous waves had tangled
and spread her long hair over her. Tears of rage
rushed into Argus's eyes when he saw where it had
been torn from its roots. Her arms were round
the man's head; her hands clutched his temples,
his face was so tightly pressed into her bosom that
Argus instinctively believed he was still alive in a
stifled swoon. <i>She</i> was dead. Take her lover
away from that breast of stone, Argus, let him not
see those open lips&mdash;no longer the crimson gates to
the fiery hours of his enjoyment,&mdash;nor let him feel
those poor bruised fingers clenching his brain;
those delicate stems of the will are powerless to
creep round his heart! May Satan of the remorseless
deep alone know and remember the last hour
of this woman's passion, despair and sacrifice!</p>

<p>Argus rose to his feet, wondering why he saw so
clearly, and possessed with an idea which was a mad
one, perhaps, but which allied him, in greatness of
soul, to the woman before him. He was still confused,
and had forgotten where Mat and the boat
were, but Mat had seen his dark figure rising
against the sky, and was ploughing through the
sand with the intention of remonstrating with
Argus on the impossibility of ever getting it off
again. But when he came up behind him, there
was something in his attitude&mdash;a familiar one&mdash;which
imposed his respectful attention. Mat bent
over the bodies silently, and touched them with
his foot.</p>

<p>"She is dead?" interrogated Argus.</p>

<p>"Never will be more so."</p>

<p>"This man is still alive. Lift his head. I am
out of breath. The wind is going down, and we
can run back easy."</p>

<p>"It may raly be called pleasant," muttered Mat,
on his knees in the sand. "<i>There now I have got
you, safe enough from her.</i> God! She put on
shirt and trowsers to jump overboard with him,
swapping deaths, and getting nothing to boot.
He is limber; give me the brandy and let's warm
up the boy."</p>

<p>"Here," said Argus, in a suppressed voice,
"pour it down, quick. Have you a lashing? I
should like to put her out of his sight; one of the
ballast stones will do. Help me to carry her to
the other side of the bar; the deep water will
cover her."</p>

<p>Mat pretended to be too busy to hear.</p>

<p>"Crazier than ever," he muttered. "I might
have known his damned crankiness would bile out
somewhere."</p>

<p>Argus wrapped the poor girl in his mackintosh,
and staggered towards the boat carrying her;
there was no help against it, and Mat rose to his
assistance. In a moment or two she was buried
in the grave she had so terribly resisted.</p>

<p>The gale was nearly spent, and Mat ventured to
hoist the sail. Argus tumbled the still insensible
man into the boat by the head and heels, and they
ran across the harbor, landing at the quay below
the house. Mary was there before the boat was
tied to a spile.</p>

<p>"How are you off for elbow-grease?" cried
Mat. "Put the lantern down, and jump in; here's
a bundle for you to take up to the house. Capen
and I are clean gone, I tell you. I've lost the rims
of my ears, and expect to leave a few toes in these
ere boots when I pull 'em off. Come, quick."</p>

<p>Without a word she lifted the man from the
bottom of the boat, and, with Mat's help, clambered
up the wharf, and took him into the house. Tempe
ran shrieking when she saw him stretched on the
floor before the fire, in the green room. Roxalana
sat rigid, nailed to her chair, incapable of motion
at the sight; Virginia and Mary were collected.
Mat adroitly peeled off a portion of his wet clothes,
and told Mary to rub him like damnation. It was
a long time before he gave sign of life. At the
first choking breath Mat poured some brandy over
his face and neck; he rose galvanically to a sitting
posture, and fell back again, to all appearance
dead. But Mat declared he was all right, and
presently went out to change his wet clothes for
dry ones. Virginia looked up at Argus, convinced
herself that the man was saved.</p>

<p>"Take care of me, if you please," he said. "I
want brandy, and a dry shirt. How are you,
Roxalana?"</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice she turned in her
chair. Mat returned with his arms full of clothes
for Argus, and asked her if she would be good
enough to step out with Virginia, and go to bed.
There wasn't any use in praying now, for they were
back. Not one of them thought of the unhappy
crew, all lost, except one who lay before them.</p>

<p>"That 'ere Virginia," said Mat, when she and
Roxalana had gone, and he was watching the
man's eyelids, "is as mealy a gal as I ever saw in
my life. She's cool, and smooth, and soft. She
beat Moll in rubbing. Hullo! his eyes are open.
Look here, Spaniard, you belong to us. Drink
this, my lad, and let me hold you up. So&mdash;all
right, young un. Shut up. Gates, you are drunk,
and have reason to be. I reckon you are black
and blue from the bruises you got. I've had a
pint of swipes myself, and feel inwardly correct.
Hark ye&mdash;he's off in a reglar, natural sleep, aint
he?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p>A LITTLE after daybreak Chloe knocked at
the door, and was let in by Mat, who had
dozed, and drank, and watched with Argus all
night, waiting for the even chance to be decided
with the one they had rescued. It was decided in
his favor, if life could be called a favor. He came
to himself at last, battered, sore, and amazed&mdash;not
able to speak much, nor quite up to analyzing his
situation.</p>

<p>"How's the Lord your way, Mrs. Ebony Cuff?"
asked Mat, as Chloe passed in; "I don't mean
him exactly, but his right-hand man, Mr. Brande."</p>

<p>"I forgets the Lord whenever I comes across
you, pizen thing that you are. I want Missey,
right off. There's no need of stirring anybody. I
know where she is, and I am going up these stairs,
rotten as they are, like the folks that come here."</p>

<p>"Better take a handful of ashes to scatter along
your way, if you are going to look for your Missey
in this ere venerable structure."</p>

<p>"Put the ashes on your own head, 'cause you
are bad all over; but I guess there's not much
ashes in this house. Go, along with you; don't
watch me."</p>

<p>She crept into the chamber where Virginia was,
and softly roused her.</p>

<p>"Better come home, Missey," she whispered,
"your father has not asked for you. Your mother
is dead asleep; didn't I let her take the laudleum
drops after you went last night! 'Tis almost sunrise;
the day will be as light as if the poor souls
didn't all go down. Mr. Brande never came home
till two o'clock, and he says, says he to me&mdash;'Chloe,
they are in eternity; such was God's will.
Is there any hot water?' Did he 'spect I had hot
water for <i>him</i>? I had some for <i>you</i> waiting; I
thought you would not dare to stay all night. For
marcy's sake come on now. It isn't in the book
for you to be seen tramping backwards and forwards
between here and the Forge of nights. Let
little Tempe alone; don't wake up the kitten.
Marcy on me, where's Argus Gates been? Out of
the house all the time? Musn't stay in Argus
Gates's house."</p>

<p>She assisted Virginia to dress as she whispered,
with nervous haste. There was no reason for it,
but a mist, faint and chilly, settled round Virginia's
brain; there could be nothing impending at home,&mdash;nothing
had happened, beyond the catastrophe
of which she knew nothing; what then was the
matter, that obliged her to agree with Chloe in
in thinking it best to return as soon as possible?
She silently made herself ready.</p>

<p>"The man is doing well," said Mat, in reply to
her salutation, when she came down. "We had
several tussels with him in the course of the night,
when he seemed to be slipping out of our hands;
but he is a sure card now. We don't know his
name yet, nor what business he is in; but I guess
he is a likely sort of a man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Chloe eagerly.</p>

<p>"Picked a man out of the water," he answered;
"he was most pickled."</p>

<p>"Is one saved? Did you find him alone?"</p>

<p>"All living alone. There wasn't a cuss in sight
besides him anywheres. Beats me where they did
go to. Enough's good as a feast, though."</p>

<p>Chloe was much inclined to hear further particulars,
but Virginia beckoned her along. The yearning,
dispirited glance which Virginia threw back at
the house as she left it was not lost upon the
sharp-sighted Mat. As she and Chloe entered the
path beyond the alley, the fan-like rays of the rising
sun struck into the sky, and coldly shone over the
wild bay; no lucid blue nor shining green colored
its surface; it was a leaden-hued, turbulent, hurrying
mass. Virginia found no solace in the pale
light as it spread over the pastures and leafless
shrubs; the mystery in the atmosphere which sometimes
tracks one's feelings had vanished. With
the turn in the path near the Forge the scene
changed. Here Apsley River was bordered with a
grove of pine trees whose green pinnacles crowned
the air, and whose gray shafts columned the ground
with melancholy state. The sea was no longer
visible, and the town sank behind a range of grassy,
shapeless hills. Some fancy concerning the grove
arrested her; its depths she had not visited for
years. She recalled the time when she played
upon its red beds, under its feathery canopy, and
pulled up the spotted moss, or broke the yellow
plate-like tops of the fungus which pushed through
the sand and thatched itself with needles; the
silence and the sighing of the pines suited her
present mood. When she came within the precincts
of the Forge, and saw the high house
glittering with windows, she left her sighs and
love for solitude in the shrine of the grove. The
men about the stable were the only evidence that
the house was astir. Virginia went up to her room,
and despised herself for thinking it comfortable
after her weary, absorbing night, and compared it
with the apartment she had slept in for an hour or
two&mdash;a vast, barn-like place, containing more
draughts than furniture; whose walls represented a
hunting scene, where the hunters and their game
were equally torn, where the boscage, arcades,
and sylvan fountains had faded to a pale brown;
whose floor was gray, and shiny, and cold as ice.
Roxalana's feather-bed was like a dromedary's
back, and her counterpane a calico biography;
Tempe's first dress was in it, and the last Indian
pillow-case of Argus. It all seemed preferable to
Virginia, for freedom was there. When the breakfast
bell rang, she went down, attired in the morning
dress her father's taste dictated at present,
and with the manners he always expected her to
serve him with. Still there was an air of self-command
about her which must have convinced him
there was the capacity for opposition. He was
standing at the back of his chair, rubbing his sleek,
shaven chin; his sharp, impassive eyes, seeming to
observe nothing, observed everything. He noted
Virginia's paleness,&mdash;that Mrs. Brande's hand
shook more than usual, and a cracked china cup at
the same moment,&mdash;but spoke of neither. The
large diamond pin in his shirt-front, the large
white perfumed cambric handkerchief which he
flourished looked no cleaner, plainer, nor fairer
than he did, in manner and countenance, as he sat
at the head of his table, tasting of every dish, even
drinking both tea and coffee, but eating only
morsels after all. Chloe continually appeared with
hot cakes, hot eggs, or hot tea, and in the intervals
stood at Mrs. Brande's elbow. It was one of Mr.
Brande's requirements, also, that his wife, in whatever
condition of nervousness, lethargy, or feebleness,
should appear at breakfast; and this morning
she occupied her usual seat before the tray,
whose silver array she was almost incapable of
managing. Her puffy eyes and lax mouth, her
hoarse sighs, the handsome lace cap awry on her
head, the mixed finery of her dress, presented a
contrast to his and Virginia's appearance, which
irritated his inmost soul. Even with his wife, however,
he found his limits. He could compel her
to rise to sit at the table,&mdash;but he could not force
her to eat, nor prevent the occasional fall of a cup
or the spilling of coffee by her trembling hand.
He was obliged to wink at Chloe's officiousness in
taking the duties of the meal from her, adroitly, to
be sure; but for so doing he would have been
pleased to reward her services by dismissing her.</p>

<p>"Your kind heart, Virginia, and some curiosity,
induced you to stay all night with Mrs. Gates," he
said, sliding his chair back, after breakfast. "I
heard that Argus Gates went out, while I was down
town; several bets were made, I am sorry to say,
against his getting back. Of course he did come
back."</p>

<p>"Yes, father," she replied; "very late, however."</p>

<p>"Did you find anybody requiring more care than
your mother, at his house?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande commenced shaking her head with
intense sympathy at the remarks of her husband,
and having begun could not stop.</p>

<p>"I went to see Roxalana, who was much disturbed.
She was gratified to have me with her.
I also went from an interest in the occasion. When
they&mdash;Captain Gates and Mat&mdash;returned with
the man they rescued&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did Gates really go to the trouble of saving a
soul from death?" he interrupted; "well, I am
glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"Then I busied myself in various ways to restore
him, and succeeded. Mother knows that your
question is answered, I hope."</p>

<p>"It is not likely that Gates would row a dead
man into his house; it was not necessary, perhaps,
for you to bestow your labors upon him. I remark
that I do not like it. Did you assist in undressing
him? Were you about his person much? Do you
think the matter was quite delicate?"</p>

<p>Virginia made no answer. Chloe, who remained
in the room, fixed her eyes on the mild-voiced man,
the paternal inquisitor, with an expression she derived
from some Indian ancestor, who was in the
habit of skulking behind trees with his tomahawk.
She understood Mr. Brande no better than others
did; but she disliked him, and thought him as
hateful as she believed he was sincere.</p>

<p>"From whom do you take this erratic disposition?"
he continued. "What morbid appetite
have you which leads you to seek a kind of society
utterly aside from the sphere you are destined for?
Gates is a man without God in the world. Do you
not think so? Answer me, Virginia. Is he not a
heathen to all intents?"</p>

<p>"I think he is."</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Gates any better,&mdash;his grotesque sister-in-law?"</p>

<p>"No better."</p>

<p>"And the little one, that Drake was unfortunate
enough to marry,&mdash;what of her?"</p>

<p>"She seems as pagan also."</p>

<p>"And such are your friends!"</p>

<p>Chloe, unable to contain herself any longer, burst
into the conversation.</p>

<p>"I 'spect missey will come down with newralagy
'fore the night comes, Mr. Brande. She has exposed
herself for her fellow-creatures; don't you
see that, sar? It is in my Bible that a human
being is a human being when he suffers, as well as
a pagan heathen."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande smiled benevolently on the ignorant
Chloe, and asked her why she was not as quick in
clearing the breakfast things away as she was with
her tongue? He hoped no unusual feelings hindered
her in the performance of her duties. Mrs.
Brande transferred her indignation from Virginia
to Chloe, and ordered her in a cross tone to shake
the sofa pillow up, and arrange her footstool, as
she had had quite confusion enough at breakfast,
and would be glad of a little rest. But it was
Virginia who complied with her demands, assisted
her to the sofa, adjusted her cap, and placed a
handkerchief in the inert, useless hands. Mr.
Brande sat quietly before the table still, chewing a
stick, and, forgetting all that he had said, was
speculating on the appearance and condition of his
wife. The day before he had received advice from
England respecting some railroad iron, and it
occurred to him then that an opportunity was
offered him for escape from the thraldom of home:
he could profitably go to England on business.
Being absent&mdash;what then! A hundred dreams
swarmed in his mind, like stinging bees, laden with
honey. The doubts of a coward, however, stole in
with them; away from the restraints of family,
society, and the church&mdash;something in himself
would hold him back from the indulgence, the
desire for which gnawed into his life like a worm!
Virginia mistook his silence for a meditation upon
the subject of Temple House.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to discontinue my visits to the
Gates family?" she asked. "My friendship never
can be broken."</p>

<p>"Indeed! <i>I</i> have known Gates for years. At
one time he promised to be a man of energy. His
brother George was a rascal, but he <i>seemed</i> to enjoy
life; he spent Argus's money&mdash;I believe Argus is
penniless, almost. Perhaps the example of cheerfulness
may be an advantage. I don't know that
it is needful to be cheerful always, though. No;
do not end your <i>acquaintance</i> there; as for <i>friendship</i>&mdash;pshaw,
Virginia!"</p>

<p>"Poverty is beautiful!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, to only daughters, whose fathers are rich
enough to allow them to contemplate it at a distance
as far as Temple House, say. Absurd thing,
it is, to stick a title on a poor man's house! Chloe,
I'll thank you for my hat. I must, by the way,
inquire about the man picked up last night; possibly
he needs help. Good morning."</p>

<p>"Ain't he the most sensible man ever made?"
asked Chloe. "He does know what to do,&mdash;fact,&mdash;when
other people are all upside down, as it
were."</p>

<p>"What am I to do under my correct guardianship?"
thought Virginia.</p>

<p>"Virginia," called Mrs. Brande, brightening
with the departure of her husband, "as you were
at Temple House this morning, and I didn't dream
you were going to stay, why didn't you wait for
me to send a carriage for you? I wanted to try
Huber's Balsam to-day. You know well that Chloe
can not walk so far, and your father is not willing
for me to send one of the men on such errands.
Now, tell me if you can, how I am to get a&mdash;<i>Bot-tle
of Hu-ber's Balsam?</i> It is very unpleasant, cold,
damp and unhealthy to-day, but <i>I</i> am going for it.
Ask Moses to put one of the horses in the chaise.
No, I'll ask myself."</p>

<p>Even the daughter of a hundred earls sometimes
finds that grooms, horses, and carriages are not
entirely at her disposal. It was so with Mrs. Brande
now. Moses declared that the "chay hoss" must
have a shoe; and there was nary horse in the stable
for her, except Mr. Brande's sulky horse.
Would she try the crittur?</p>

<p>The result was that Virginia walked into town
and procured a bottle of the desired drug. The
apothecaries of Kent were familiar with Mrs.
Brande's ailments, and the remedies she most preferred;
the knowledge of this was a portion of
Virginia's hateful trouble which had gone on for
years. With the apothecaries, also, Mr. Brande's
habitual self-denial came into play; he would have
liked to forbid their selling to, or trusting, his wife,
under the penalty of the law,&mdash;but instead, he paid
her long bills with an excellent grace.</p>

<p>That day Virginia walked six miles. In the evening,
while waiting for her father and mother's
return from a prayer-meeting, which had been appointed
on account of the late dreadful event, in
the hope of averting the further anger of the Almighty
in regard to other shipwrecks in the immediate
neighborhood of Kent, she quilted on the silk
lining of a pair of slippers which Mrs. Brande was
fretting for.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p>MAT SUTCLIFFE went home soon after Virginia's
departure and asked Mary to pinch
him, for he wanted to be sure he wasn't in a dream.
If he was awake he would go to bed; if not, he
might as well stay up, and take it out a-dreaming,
though he couldn't say that he felt the nightmare
refreshing. Mary pinched him till he roared.</p>

<p>"Look here, Moll," he said, "I found this handkerchief
squeezed in his waistband; the name
marked on it is <i>Sebastian Ford</i>. That's the man's
name. I'll bet you, he never put the handkerchief
where I found it."</p>

<p>"Who did then?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, old woman."</p>

<p>Argus was alone at his post. He had stretched
himself on the floor, and lay as silent and motionless
as the figure upon the cot near him. A sigh
diverted his attention from the ceiling, and he
raised himself on his elbow to find that he was
observed by a pair of eyes with speculation in
them.</p>

<p>"Well," said Argus, "have you made up your
mind to live? You couldn't be drowned now, if
you tried, you know."</p>

<p>"Was it you, who did this?" a faint voice asked.</p>

<p>Argus nodded.</p>

<p>"What a debt I have incurred!"</p>

<p>"I think so," Argus replied absently, his thoughts
reverting to the last scene on the White Flat.</p>

<p>"How did you find me?" asked the voice, this
time in a sharper accent, with a vague horror coming
into the dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Alone," answered Argus promptly.</p>

<p>"No vestige of the ship near me?"</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"That is a lie, I think."</p>

<p>"You must have more brandy, for you mustn't
think." And Argus compelled him to swallow
several spoonfuls.</p>

<p>"Sir," asked the voice once more, "was there
anything by my person&mdash;clinging to me&mdash;round my
neck&mdash;I entreat you to tell me."</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"By God, there was something&mdash;it strangles me
now&mdash;she,&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't accuse me of inhospitality," said Argus,
feeling strongly drawn towards the agitated young
man. "The collar of my shirt which you have on
would not do so unhandsome a thing as to choke
you."</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to sit beside me, sir. My
name is Sebastian Ford. I am as naked as Adam
was, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I am Argus Gates, your friend, if you say so.
Some one, Mat Sutcliffe, shared with me in restoring
to you the gift of life. I hope you will make
something out of it. I have taken a fancy to you;
it is natural under the circumstances, you know.
Don't do the other natural thing, though,&mdash;turn
round and give me a kick, as soon as there is power
in your foot."</p>

<p>"Warm the viper, and see," Sebastian answered,
with a smile which changed his weary face into
beauty.</p>

<p>Argus struck his breast in astonishment at the
thrill which passed through it; a new light passed
over his cold, sarcastic face, and Sebastian felt it.
Destiny was kind to him in a measure he could not
yet comprehend; he was on the threshold of an unknown
world; to save himself from the past he
must enter it. He held out his hand to Argus,
with a mournful, affectionate glance; Argus
took it.</p>

<p>"<i>Argus</i>," he said presently, "look out, I am
going to faint."</p>

<p>Roxalana was called; he remained in a dead faint
so long, one fit succeeding another, that it was
afternoon before he rallied. Argus sent Roxalana
away; he was in no mood to have her beside him,
and only allowed her to come to the door for his
orders. Messages from people in the town were
left during the day which he would not hear.
Tempe came to him once with Mr. Drake's offer of
help. Sebastian caught a glimpse of her.</p>

<p>"What made me imagine no woman was here?"
he asked, "though last night a crowd of them
seemed to be flitting round me."</p>

<p>"There are two widows living under my roof,"
Argus replied curtly; "one is my niece, the other
my sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can sit up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will be good enough to send for the
other savior; I want to see him."</p>

<p>Argus propped him up with pillows, and sent for
Mat, who came from home immediately. Though
his eyes were bloodshot, his hair ragged and salt-looking,
still Sebastian recognized a certain likeness
to Argus in him, or imitation perhaps. Neither
<i>were</i> the sort of men he had been familiar with;
they were not polished and conventional, nor did
they appear like easy desperadoes. He could not
rate them.</p>

<p>"Mat," said Argus sharply, "you look like a jail
bird. Hasn't Mary any comb? A three-legged
stool I know she uses sometimes."</p>

<p>Mat made no answer, but gazed intently at
nothing.</p>

<p>"Come here, please," said Sebastian, in a weak
voice. Mat stepped forward, on his toes, and
Sebastian offered his hand.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said.</p>

<p>The color streaked over Mat's cheek and forehead.</p>

<p>"'Twas nothing," he answered; "I am used to
paddling a boat in rough weather. You are round
again, hey?"</p>

<p>"I am aware what a thing it is to be saved by
such men. Of the mere facts I know but little,"
said Sebastian, looking at Mat earnestly.</p>

<p>"The Captain here fetched you off the bar while
I was manning the boat. Blarst me, if 'taint a
question, since you went to so much trouble to get
on it, and being on it with all your sensibility drove
out, whether you ought not to have been left there.
When a man is so far gone out of his misery, what's
the use of tormenting him with breath again?"</p>

<p>"How do you account for finding me alone?"
Sebastian asked abruptly. He made a wild, involuntary
gesture with his head, and the horror came
into his eyes again.</p>

<p>Mat hesitated, and there was a dead silence in the
room. Sebastian fell back on the pillows, and
closed his eyes. Argus exchanged a glance with
Mat, and shook his head. In a moment Sebastian
started up as if listening.</p>

<p>"<i>Sebastian!</i>" he called, in the imploring, dying
voice of a woman; "<i>your lips are consecrated, and I
lose them forever.</i>"</p>

<p>Mat felt strangely heart-sick, but seeing that Sebastian
did not seem aware that he was speaking,
he began in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"When the book is written which will contain the
freaks of what I call the she part of nature, the sea,&mdash;you
will be able to account for our finding you as
we did. Moreover, sir, the White Flat is mostly a
quicksand; it sucks down all that goes on't. Also,
sir, the wind changed after your craft bilged, and
the crew were washed off the deep-water side. If
ever they round the bar for harbor, there will be
skeletons in port."</p>

<p>Mat did not add that seven of the crew had
already been picked up, and buried that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Take a cigar, Mat," said Argus suddenly.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir."</p>

<p>As Mat approached for a light, he felt rewarded
for his deceit when he met Argus's,&mdash;no longer
cold and hard, but vivid and sympathetic. He discovered
then that Argus was thoroughly drunk.</p>

<p>"Capen, I'll take my turn to watch this ere invalid;
you are about up to your notch. How much
have you had, a quart?"</p>

<p>Argus smiled, and held up two fingers.</p>

<p>"Falling off, somewhere," continued Mat. "I've
known you to hold up three, and a quart <i>was</i> a
quart in them days."</p>

<p>As silently as before, Argus directed his attention
to Sebastian, who had opened his melancholy eyes.</p>

<p>"Why won't Argus go?" he said. "Stay by me,
and perhaps he may be persuaded to rest."</p>

<p>"He calls him <i>Argus</i>," said Mat to himself. "It
will be pretty thick with these two."</p>

<p>"Be off," said Argus presently, now holding up
three fingers, "and come back hereafter."</p>

<p>Mat, saying he had a little business outside, one
that wasn't necessary to the gentlemen present, retired
as far as the other side of the green-room door,
and sat down on the floor, keeping his hat on, and
patiently embracing his knees.</p>

<p>To be drunk with Argus meant a revivification of
his faculties, usually in a state of neglect or suspension.
To say that one occasionally puts the noble
and generous enemy wine into the mouth, means
more philosophically than it does morally. At present
anything that would go to fill up the cup of sensation
Argus would have drained, and added to the
fine life of the moment.</p>

<p>Sebastian, aware of the physical strain he had
gone through, was amazed at his increasing brightness
and deep refreshment.</p>

<p>"How do you do it, Argus?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I don't do it. Do you suppose there will be
such a storm again?"</p>

<p>"You are a strange man."</p>

<p>"Because I observed you through glasses? It
is my telescopic way. I am a marine, you know&mdash;one
of the shelved monsters of the deep. Have
you a fancy to start a museum?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;and begin with that curiosity between
men&mdash;our friendship."</p>

<p>"I said, 'your friend.' I am not inclined to
twist my mouth with repeating a phrase I have not
used for forty-one years."</p>

<p>"Heavens! how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Forty-one."</p>

<p>Sebastian pulled his mustache with the air of
solving a problem, and Argus walked up and down
the room as if there was no problem left him to
solve. Each observed the other furtively, and both
felt a sentiment new to them.</p>

<p>"I have provoked Nature into a conspiracy,"
said Argus at length, "and experience something
akin to the <i>Ideal</i>. I have refused to learn it from
ordinary circumstances,&mdash;she has thrown you
towards me."</p>

<p>"And I," replied Sebastian, "find something in
the Real, which I have struggled against. I'll try
a few steps on the floor, too."</p>

<p>He slipped from the cot, and stood dizzy and
reeling.</p>

<p>"Steady," said Argus, approaching him; "you
still have on your sea-legs."</p>

<p>Sebastian flung his arms round the neck of Argus,
and kissed his cheek. Argus strained Sebastian to
his breast, and while they were in this attitude,
Mat softly entered in a pair of canvas slippers.</p>

<p>"Blarsted," he said, almost aloud, "if I haven't
eaten something that's hurt me. I see double&mdash;specks
in my eyes&mdash;appears to me as if a play was
going on&mdash;twenty-five years are supposed to elapse
in the Isle of France, and home comes that ere
long-lost vagabond. Raly, they might be brothers
now&mdash;in the dark."</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of a chair, moved in
spite of the contempt he tried to show, and said in
a gruff voice:</p>

<p>"Past midnight, gentlemen; time for old folks
to be in bed."</p>

<p>"Get a light then," said Argus, "and show me
the way to bed."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gates would be glad to know," continued
Mat, cautiously pulling a blanket over Sebastian as
he dropped on the cot again, "just how comfortable
the person is."</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Like a fine young fellow," replied Mat, warming
into sudden enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Get a light then," repeated Argus, "and show
me the way to that bed you spoke of. I don't
know where it is."</p>

<p>Mat hurried after a candle, and they started for
the stairs.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Argus politely, "that you will
allow me to retire in my clothes. I prefer to do so."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Mat, "only be sure to undress
in the morning."</p>

<p>Argus stretched himself on the bed, and closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he called, as Mat was about to go out.
"What do you think of him?"</p>

<p>"There's a pair of you."</p>

<p>"A pair! His face paired?"</p>

<p>"I aint a judge of beauty, Capen. What makes
his eyebrows meet? He has got a long, green
face. His eyes are too near together."</p>

<p>"Is he handsome?"</p>

<p>Argus sat up to make the pillow up to throw at
Mat, in case his reply did not suit him.</p>

<p>"I say, <i>yes:</i> dead and alive, I never looked upon
a handsomer boy."</p>

<p>"Now go watch him."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

</div>

<p>SEBASTIAN FORD was the son of an English
trader who lived in Carthagena many years,
and died there in the time of the political troubles
which convulsed that portion of South America;
his mother was a rich Spanish woman, whose
beauty he had inherited. After his father's death
Sebastian came into possession of the business,
which he soon closed, and found himself thereby
the owner of twenty thousand pounds. In the
latitude of his birth the two chief ways of spending
money were in glory and gaming. He cared for
neither. With youth, health, and fortune, he went
to England, and, carefully avoiding all introduction
to persons with the name of Ford, lived both
in London and Paris, as creoles proverbially live;
spent a large share of his money; grew fatigued;
and returned home to tropical luxury, which was
cheap, and at one's door. He met in his mother's
house a Catholic priest of his own age, domiciled
there, and in her affections. He made no effort to
oust the priest, nor, like Hamlet, did he discourse
with his mother on the merits of his father, but
silently destroyed all memorial of him&mdash;even
ravaged her jewel box, from which he took an
ivory painted miniature, and a locket containing a
lock of auburn hair, which he well remembered.
In like manner he made farewell preparations for
a second departure, which he intended should be
final, and one day stood before his handsome,
violent, brainless mother, in an attitude which made
the blood flow to her dusky face.</p>

<p>"My Sebastian!" she said, casting her rolling
eyes over him.</p>

<p>He pointed, without a word, to the sea; beyond
the window, within her sight, the spars of a vessel
swayed back and forth. She understood his intention,
and, after the manner of Spaniards, poured
out a volume of words without a single gesticulation,
then stopped and stretched out her beautiful
bare arms to him.</p>

<p>"That for the padre!" he said, giving them a
blow with his hat, turned on his heel, and left her.
He set sail for a country where vice and religion
are not to be seen hand in hand. Whether some
spark of his mother's fire burned in his blood still;
whether the sentiment which attaches the soul to
the earth where and from which the body is
molded; whether the formal selfishness, the conventional
barbarities of his adopted life, or the
sombre melancholy of an empty heart, sent him to
his native land again, no one knew. But for
several years some secluded spot there held him
fast. Then he fell into the hands and life of
Argus Gates. So much of his history, connected
with business merely, he related to Argus. He
was a passenger in the wrecked vessel, and on his
way from a West Indian port, to one in the
Southern United States. He had credit at a
foreign banking house, not unknown to Argus, and
must, of course now wait for funds, since he had
lost all he brought with him. He confessed he
had no especial aim for the future; there was still
enough of his early fortune to enable him to live
in idleness anywhere. So long as a man's age
keeps him in abeyance, one place, he affirmed, is
as good as another for existence. Argus shook
his head at the idea; he, who created motive power
from the circumstances the present offered, and
subordinated them to the completion of an enjoyment
limited to their limits, could not be expected
to sympathize in such a theory. Argus waited for
no inheritance, reversing the fable; he kept his
eyes on the shadows of sensation, and avoided their
substance,&mdash;except in the case of Sebastian himself.
In all the relations which affect men, however,
Argus and Sebastian were worthy of each
other. They were both morally deficient; alike
sincere, incapable of trifling; devoid of puerility;
gifted with the faculty of making forcible and
dignified all their acts, which in others might
appear grotesque or weak; and capable of enduring
solitude. They differed also. Where Sebastian
was old, Argus was young; his sharp,
positive nature permitted no dallying with the
close accumulating reserved forces of his character.
With Sebastian they were created to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>For a long time Sebastian was in eclipse. An
illness followed his shipwreck, which lasted for
weeks; when he recovered it was certain that his
mind was under a cloud. Whether he was haunted
by some recollection, or occupied with anxiety concerning
the future, Argus could not judge. At
times he was possessed by an abstraction which
affected him, as if his sight and hearing were destroyed,
and for days sat like a statue, in marble
sadness, or walked about the house like a somnambulist
or an automaton. Tempe considered him
ingeniously arranged as a machine, but thought it
a pity he had been gifted with the power of locomotion,
since it caused the danger of his running
against one. But Roxalana, with Argus, felt
strangely attached to him; some secret association
bestowed upon her slow understanding the
ability to comprehend his condition. She thought
him in the despair of exhaustion, and wished that
the present years of his life were past, so that the
struggle of change might be over, and the settlement
of his affairs be resolved to the conclusion of
his being one of the family forever. The room intended
for Tempe after her marriage was plainly
furnished, and given to him. He expressed himself
satisfied that the prospect from its four windows
revealed no more of the world than the elms
on the lawn, the garden, and the warehouse above
the quay. When the vine spread its leaves over
the summer-house, and the rose-trees budded;
when the elms softly brushed their green, graceful
boughs against the window-panes, his mood
changed. He said one day to Argus that he must
go downstairs and ask a favor of Roxalana.</p>

<p>"Try it," urged Argus, "fearful she-dragon as
she is, she may grant it. She will be so astonished
to learn that you want one."</p>

<p>"Dear," said Sebastian, kissing Roxalana's hand,
"I am awake. I ask something of you."</p>

<p>"It is granted, Sebastian."

<p>"Not yet, possibly; will you have me here without
obtaining any knowledge of me? I would
have you accept me as if I were born on that night
in March, instead of having been threatened with
death. I am as much in earnest as if it were not
possible that my wish comes from a whim."</p>

<p>"Stay," she said.</p>

<p>"It must be fondness that prompts me. Is it
the strange old house standing in primal twilight,&mdash;the
cold, melancholy, intangible landscape in which
it is set? Is it you, the passionless soul, the central
brooding heart, or <i>Argus</i>, the type of man,
neither existing in Utopia nor the world of ordinary
men, that gives me these feelings?"</p>

<p>"Whatever reason you may put forward in your
own mind for staying, stay."</p>

<p>"What I can do for you, Roxalana, I feel will
only prove in the end that my selfishness overpowered
you."</p>

<p>"I will supply myself then from that selfishness.
Our world is a lonely one, Sebastian; I do not
want society, but at times material for fresh employment.
You would not think it so,&mdash;would
you! I shall come to you, and take what it pleases
me to take, as one dips a draught of water from a
full vessel."</p>

<p>"Oh," he muttered, "I have been badly drained
before this, too. I am not so cunning as to keep
this calm woman-friend from a taint of the old inspiration."</p>

<p>Roxalana changed the direction of her eyes, but
not their expression, as Argus entered the room.</p>

<p>"He has thought it necessary," she said, "to
make some appeal to me about staying here. My
faith is shaken now; I supposed, of course, that
he would remain. Can he not be happy, Argus, as
you are?"</p>

<p>"You are sublime in your conceit," he answered.</p>

<p>"Finding, I mean, that when the ways of happiness
are impossible, life is better without. I am
sure you would not dare a change now," she
said.</p>

<p>"You are a solitary, ignorant soul. I have
dared to expect a friend in Sebastian&mdash;and have I
not dared changes before? What day was it that
I left this house in pursuit of a man no better than
a Dead Sea apple? Sebastian, what do you hope
for in me?"</p>

<p>"More than I have had, even."</p>

<p>"And the garden will be beautiful soon," said
Roxalana. "Tempe and Virginia are walking
there now."</p>

<p>"Virginia?" said Sebastian inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Our friend, whom you have seen."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Have you not seen Virginia Brande?" asked
Argus.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You had better have your eyes couched."</p>

<p>"I recollect," said Sebastian, "you, Roxalana,
Mat Sutcliffe, and the child&mdash;Tempe. Has any
other figure appeared to me?"</p>

<p>"This one,&mdash;just outside the door."</p>

<p>Virginia came in, with a white jonquil in her
hand, followed by Tempe. Sebastian rose, bowed
deeply, and thought of the queen of heaven.</p>

<p>"See, this is finer than your tulips, Roxalana,"
said Virginia, advancing, and offering her the flower.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," she answered. "Give it to
Sebastian; I was just speaking of the beauty of
our garden."</p>

<p>Quietly handing him the flower, which he as
quietly took, Virginia turned to Argus, but her
voice was drowned in Tempe's exclamation:</p>

<p>"Don't believe that the garden is fine; it is an
old concern which carries on the production of
toadstools. It was laid out in the year one, by my
crazy relatives, whose name I have the honor to
bear,&mdash;giving me a Samson-like association. She
thought gooseberry bushes and fat rose-trees meant
shrubbery."</p>

<p>"And this?" said Sebastian with a smile, holding
out the flower.</p>

<p>Tempe twisted her mouth, and made no answer.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on the flower, and suddenly,
passionately inhaled its peculiar, rich sweetness, as
strong as wine, and threw it away.</p>

<p>Virginia picked it up with an odd smile, and caressed
its crushed leaves with a pitiful motion.</p>

<p>"Needn't have given it to him," said Tempe
crossly.</p>

<p>"Little Miss," said Sebastian, "have I provoked
you? The odor stung me."<p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>NO episodes marked the long days of the following
summer at Temple House. The inner
self of its inmates was wrapped in the necessary
and wholesome security which comes from the reciprocal
surrender and interchange of the habits of
our outward life. Carelessly speaking, no change
was apparent, but it was certain that Tempe was
less a teasing, restless presence than formerly;
there was little of the old, hasty flitting in and out
of doors, and the sharp encounters between herself
and Argus had ceased. Roxalana, also, seemed
differently disposed; her treasured odds and ends
had lost their interests to her economical mind.
About the time of Sebastian's recovery, Argus
began to disappear regularly between eight and
twelve A. M. For some reason he did not mention,
he sought and obtained employment in a Marine
Insurance Company. His income was added to,
and in due time the household comforts were
added to besides. It was several weeks before
Roxalana's mind was brought to bear on the fact
of his daily absence. An unexpected irregularity
occurred in regard to breakfast one morning, at
which Argus expressed some impatience; in short
he swore.</p>

<p>"Why, Argus," said Roxalana, "one would think
it necessary for you to have your breakfast at a set
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, unless the person, like yourself, should
happen to be blind and deaf."</p>

<p>She dropped into her chair and laughed; but
when he had gone, she said, with the air of imparting
a secret, "Tempe, do you know that your uncle
Argus goes out every morning, and has done so
for two months?"</p>

<p>"What if he does? I am willing for the furniture
to go out too, if it chooses, and the house, or
anything else here; and I don't object to their
staying out, either."</p>

<p>The gentle ministration of the season coincided
with Sebastian's mood; its temperate sunshine and
breezes; the uniform grass on hill and field, decked
everywhere with straight-stemmed flowers, yellow,
blue, and white; and even the beds of harmless
shrubs which here and there covered the flat coast;
and the blue creeks lapping into brown marshes, or
smooth pale sand, were new to him. The ordinary
inequalities of time seemed to have no lodging
place; there was no point for a purpose; night
met day in a bow of indefinite shades. At present
his vitality flowed in the current of the friendship
between himself and Argus,&mdash;a friendship of
feeling, not of ideas,&mdash;not yet to be analyzed.
Sebastian, under its moral influence, approached a
repose which was better than an occupation; and
Argus, strongly moved by it, felt an activity by
which his mask of coldness and his selfish habits
was lost. Still, Sebastian was sometimes restless.
Some old wound bled afresh; his face grew passionate
again, his handsome eyes, singular and intense
because they were too near together, wore a
tormenting expression. One could not meet his
glance then, without being possessed with the
desire to rend from him the secret of his power.
He muttered Spanish between his teeth, and
hummed wild, monotonous airs. Tempe listened,
while he was, or appeared to be, unmindful of
her presence. She told him one day, that she had
named two cats that were in training at Mat Sutcliffe's
"Colado" and "Tizona." He stared at her
and asked her if she knew Spanish literature.</p>

<p>"I only know your unhappy Spanish fits," she
replied. "As for literature,&mdash;this looks like a
place for that, does it not?"</p>

<p>"They are old songs."</p>

<p>"Your fits?"</p>

<p>"Were you ever called a child?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;when I was born."</p>

<p>"I have not seen such a fire-fly for many days.
I shall remember you henceforth, or forget you.
Here's another old ballad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it!" and she began humming between
her teeth, "En el nombre del Criador&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush; I don't like to hear you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It reminds me of the time before I was found
dead,&mdash;when women's lips opened with your accent;
they sang different things, though. Promise
me, little Tempe, not to imitate me again."</p>

<p>He looked at her attentively, and saw that in
her face which made him shudder and regret.
"The innocents," he said to himself.</p>

<p>"I promise you," she said quickly, her blood
dyeing her face like a flash of flame. But from
that time he was as silent, when moody, as before
Argus and Roxalana.</p>

<p>Argus, too, occasionally returned to his dreamy
ways, passing hours under the elms, with a cigar
in his mouth, which nothing could induce him to
remove. But whatever his mood, Kent was barred
from his doors; its diurnal babble, sad or gay,
rolled into eternity,&mdash;which was no more blind or
deaf to it than the family at Temple House. Many
people, however, knew and were interested in Sebastian;
whenever he appeared in public, he was
pointed at as "<i>The Passenger</i>."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

</div>

<p>VIRGINIA had better have carried a sprig of
rosemary to Temple House, than the jonquil,
when she made her last visit, which was not repeated
for weeks. The rosemary is vigorous; its
stiff branching stalks, covered with minute, pale
blossoms, would have survived Sebastian's crushing
hand. Mrs. Brande fell into a strange condition,
which increased her cunning selfishness, and
deprived her of reason. Mr. Brande ordained
that she should appear at home and abroad, and
be treated as usual. It was terrible, however, to
see the espial of Virginia and her father over the
forlorn woman. The misery in Virginia's eyes;
the sense they expressed of the double sacrifice to
her parents; the fixed alertness in Mr. Brande's
countenance, his confidence in being able to steer
his wife in their sphere, according to the laws of
God and man, as he understood them,&mdash;must have
shaken the tactics of those beings who are said to
watch over us, and are named our guardian angels.
Summer was in her bower. The happy, idle, full-fed
days gathered round her knees, and lay upon
her breast; if stirred, it was by the scent of flowers,
the taste of fruit, the silver sound of the
creeping seas, the trickling cadence of the brooks,
the tree-tops wafting through the air, the clouds,
purple and white, rolling up the shining zenith, the
orange "sunset waning slow," beneath the islands
of the sky. Virginia, too, should have felt the
summer-heart; but her days were tedious, her
nights hateful. There was nothing sweet, sensuous,
lovely, about her; nothing pure, peaceful,
holy, in her atmosphere. Duty with her was a
constitutional idea, to be performed because placed
in her hands; and once there, she was incited to
its most honest and able performance. The subjugating
contest which most women undergo when
they perceive the necessity of martyrdom,&mdash;that
crucifixion of personality, that mysterious hypocrisy
which dictates the habit of self-denial,&mdash;was
not possible to her; the powers of happiness and
pleasure were in readiness for their natural spring
when the compression forced upon them should be
removed. Yet she believed that every event was
ordered as a preparation for the eternity she was
approaching, but in which she did not yet exist;
her senses must first become valueless. In her
opinion, all the mystery of life lay outside of it.
How could it be otherwise? It is a common notion
that substance is no medium for anything
but sin.</p>

<p>"The summer is nearly over, mother," she said
one day; "you will feel better when autumn
comes."</p>

<p>"Ta, ta, Virginia! Why open the door for
strange people? Shut it, or I'll yell. Keep out
that long streamer of wind that's trying to come in
tail foremost. I won't smell the grapevines; you
mean to have me Miss Pride and Prim. Get the
scissors, and some yellow paper, and cut me out a
row of gentlemen and ladies who don't have to
wind their watches and wear clothes. Hush, I
don't want them now: Cyrus is coming. My dear,
did you tell me it was a grape year? Mr. Brande,
how easy grapes slip down the throat! Pray, Cyrus;
I always liked your prayers of a summer
evening when the moths would light on your nose.
It is because you never would take Hu-ber's Bal-sam.
Pray, Cyrus. Do I please you?"</p>

<p>"We have had morning prayers, Mrs. Brande.
I must go to the office. We are forging anchors
to-day."</p>

<p>"I am forging anchors, too. Our good daughter
is my anchor. Virginia, take away this mess of
yellow paper."</p>

<p>"I don't see any paper," said Mr. Brande, making
for the door.</p>

<p>"Cyrus, she hides it. Cyrus, won't you send
Chloe away? Cyrus-Rhoda, Virginia-Cyrus, let us
send Chloe away, and the bar she drove through
my head the night you made that beautiful exhortation
in the conference meeting, will drop out.
Come here, husband."</p>

<p>He was compelled to obey her.</p>

<p>"Put your ear down, Cyrus. Virginia mustn't
hear everything, you know."</p>

<p>Unwillingly bending towards her, he waited for
her to speak. She was fumbling for something
about the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>"There!" she screamed, "take that for not
sending Chloe away, and forging your anchors."</p>

<p>And she drove the scissors through his cheek.
For a moment, with the pain and the surprise, he
lost his temper, and caught hold of a straggling
tress of her hair, and wrenched it with fury.</p>

<p>"I like it, Cyrus," she cried; "it does my head
good."</p>

<p>Virginia turned so dizzy and sick, that for an instant
she was paralyzed; then she sprang forward,
and shook off his violent hand.</p>

<p>"Oh," he groaned, staggering backwards; "there
is no deliverance for the manner of man I am.
Virginia, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Go, father, I will amuse her. Mamma, deary
mamma, I found something for you just now."</p>

<p>"Give it to me this very minute."</p>

<p>"I am going for it. Will you stay still one little
instant? it is in the garden."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Mrs. Brande, composing herself.</p>

<p>From his office shortly afterwards, Mr. Brande
sent a note to Virginia, requesting her to talk with
Chloe on the subject of taking service in another
family. The scene they had witnessed that morning
must have been occasioned by an antipathy to her;
and it was possible that a great amendment might
follow, if she were sent away. Virginia made a
resolution to combat him in this matter, but could
not resist asking Chloe immediately how she would
feel if she were obliged to leave. Chloe promptly
replied that wild horses couldn't tear her away from
the place whose crosses she had carried so long.
No new place, new miseries, shames and disgraces,
for her, if she knew her Indian self. Did missey
think that Chloe would leave her own girl in the
present nasty lurch? The thought made her sick
at the stomach!</p>

<p>The thought also made her cry. She ran away
by herself, bound up her head in a red handkerchief,
put on a clean starched apron, and sat down,
clasping her slender, coppery fingers, to indulge in
the tears of civilization. Virginia, discovering her,
was dismayed at her strange expression of grief:
not a feature moved, not a sigh escaped, but globelike
tears chased each other down her cheeks, and
dropped on her hands. Virginia kissed her, and
said, "I love you dearly, Chloe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know I am going," said Chloe solemnly.</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"You were three years old, Missey, when I came
here, twenty years ago. My baby had just
died."</p>

<p>"I never knew you were married!"</p>

<p>"Never was married; what was the good of one
of the Masapee tribe's marrying? My mother was
a Masapee, you know. Now, if I should have a
good offer, of course, I'd marry. I repented as
soon as I came to live with Mr. Brande."</p>

<p>A shriek from Mrs. Brande startled them. They
flew to her room, and found her gleeful over the
act which she wished them to observe. Mr. Brande's
pulling her hair had suggested the plan of pulling
it herself; she held a handful of her silky, pretty
hair in each hand. A demoniacal intelligence
flashed into her eyes when they came in.</p>

<p>"You have been telling secrets to each other,"
she cried. "I'll tell Mr. Brande. Chloe, what did
you promise me?"</p>

<p>"Missis, I've performed more than I promised;
always I will stay by you, if you want me to promise
that, till the last drop of laudleum is gone."</p>

<p>"Chloe!" said Virginia reprovingly.</p>

<p>"What does the copper convert mean," asked
Mrs. Brande, "with her laudleums?"</p>

<p>"She means the best, mother."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to permit the woman's stay,"
Mrs. Brande continued, in a dignified voice; "but
why will she walk round and round me every night
of my life, with something called an infant sprawling
round her neck?"</p>

<p>"There, missis, you've spoke it yourself!" exclaimed
Chloe.</p>

<p>"Hush, Virginia will hear you, Chloe. Now sit
down, and we will select our evening text."</p>

<p>When Mr. Brande came home in the evening, he
found Virginia asleep on the floor, beside her
mother's bed. Her exhausted attitude struck him
painfully; he bent down to raise her head, and
Mrs. Brande gave a shrill laugh, which shook his
nerves, and made Virginia open her eyes to find
that the skirt of her dress was ingeniously sewed to
the carpet. As she tried to rise, Mrs. Brande threw
herself upon her, screaming that her life depended
upon remaining there. Before the affair
was settled, every soul in the house was in the room
in Virginia's behalf, and Mrs. Brande was at last
quieted. Virginia, more dead than alive, seated
herself at the supper-table, and poured tea for her
father. Neither of them ate a mouthful. Mr.
Brande's eyes, however, devoured his plate; the
sweat dripped from his forehead, and his ostentatious
handkerchief came in play.</p>

<p>"Father," said Virginia at last, in a low, steady
voice, "do you not wish mother <i>dead?</i> I do. Death
makes life sacred and beautiful, and her life at present
is horrible."</p>

<p>For the second time that day, Mr. Brande lost his
self-command. Decorum refused to support him.
He struck the table with his clenched hand, rose,
leaned over it, and stared into her eyes, still radiant,
but swimming in tears.</p>

<p>"When people talk so," he said, "they have a
narrow escape if the character of <i>assassin</i> is not
given them. You belie my teaching, and my example."</p>

<p>"I trust so," she answered, stung into irreverence.
"If I followed your example what thoughts might
I not indulge in, what dreams inspire me, from what
source my wishes, my dreams arise?"</p>

<p>He turned so pale, closing his eyes, too, that
she thought that he would fall face downward
on the table, and stepped towards him, but he
raised his head quickly and waved her back to her
seat.</p>

<p>"What of Chloe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot give my consent to her going from
me,&mdash;<i>me</i>, father. I need her."</p>

<p>"She is useful, I grant. Well, we will see.
Should Mrs. Brande's feelings change toward her,
she shall stay. I inform you, Virginia, that I too
have my change concerning your mother; for a
month past she has passed half the night in crying
out against Chloe. I do not pretend to know her
reason for so doing; but do you not agree with me
in thinking it best to do all that may possibly tend
to the restoration of a health important to our well-being?
Ahem."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she must leave us, then, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Now go to bed, my daughter. You are exhausted;
the circles round your eyes proclaim it.
Must not fade, my child. Ta, ta, good-night." And
Mr. Brande was able to flourish her out of the
room with his old air.</p>

<p>She was gone, and he stood as if petrified, his
hand still extended, his eyes moving over everything
within reach; they were full of the mocking doubt
he dared express to no animate thing. Being his
daughter, and having spoken of dreams and wishes,
what could she mean? Was Virginia, whose apparent
character was all loveliness, accursed with
his secret bane? If it were so, did she know herself,
as he knew himself? And now to contemplate
her eternally with this suspicion! Suppose two suspicions
should some time meet, and in their lurid
lightnings father and daughter stand revealed to
each other! Then he laughed because he saw that
he did not fail to respect her for self-command. He
pushed his black coat from his shoulders, thrust his
hands in his pockets, and paced the room, looking
into his Janus faces, an able, proud, acute, resolute,
miserable man, counting one more immolation to
his creed,&mdash;Virginia,&mdash;a creed powerful enough to
shape his actions, but not mighty enough to control
a single sensation. Chloe, impatient at the long
delay over the tea-table, came in. The silence oppressed
her. The candle flames were not stirred
by any air; the moths pushed their feathery wings
through the blaze, and dropped round it like bits
of wool. The shrubbery in the window-frames had
fallen asleep in the dew, and the moon was gliding
by wrapped in mist.</p>

<p>"How do you find yourself this oppressive
evening, Chloe?"</p>

<p>"I am a cinder myself, what with this and that,
sir. There's so many candles burning. How do
you like so much 'lumination, sir?"</p>

<p>"A room with crimson paper swallows much
lamplight. It is different in a room papered as
Miss Virginia's is,&mdash;dove-color and silver. Is she
in her room?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, to-morrow is her birthday."</p>

<p>"I know you remember it, Mr. Brande."</p>

<p>He drew from his vest-pocket a beautiful little
enameled watch, with V. B. in diamonds and a
circle of diamonds round it.</p>

<p>"Glory!" exclaimed Chloe, "it beats her other
watch out and out."</p>

<p>"Pretty little toy," he said, making the diamonds
flash; "but of no more importance than these
moths. Brush them out, Chloe, they are annoying."</p>

<p>Replacing the watch in his pocket, and gently
withdrawing, he crept softly to his wife's door, and
listened there for a long time. It was as still
within as without, and he hoped that her composure
would last till morning, at least. But the demon
who accompanied her that day was not yet satisfied.
Before midnight Mr. Brande called Virginia
up, for Mrs. Brande had disappeared. After looking
through every room in the house, they found
her rolled up like a ball under Chloe's bed. Her
excuse for being there was, that she was determined
to forestall Chloe for once, and beat her on her
own ground.</p>

<p>In the morning Mr. Brande gave Virginia the
watch, and expressed a hope that on her next
birthday she would be able to recount as many
good hours, as, he was sure, she could for the past
year. She thanked him gracefully, held the watch
in her hand without looking at it, and begged him
to grant her one more favor. With a ray of impatience
in his eye, he asked what its nature was.
"Could she take Chloe to Roxalana Gates that
evening?"</p>

<p>He reflected a moment, and gave her permission
to do so, adding, that he would send a carriage
into Kent for her as soon as he came home. She
begged him to allow her to go by the path, and be
sent for late in the evening. He again gave way,
calling it a foolish and unbecoming whim. From
the moment Virginia told her mother that Chloe
was leaving, a lamb-like behavior ensued. She
asked for her knitting, kept Virginia near her all
the morning to pick up the stitches which she constantly
dropped; this employment was varied with
the ringing of a hand-bell for Chloe and asking her
if she was gone. Chloe answered the bell, but
would not reply; her mood was an ugly one. She
ceased praying and crying. A stern comprehension
of Virginia's future suffering filled her
thoughts; as she said afterward, nothing would
have tempted her to believe in the Lord or the
Brandes that day.</p>

<p>"Attend the meetings, Chloe," said Mr. Brande,
when he saw them ready to go. "My interest in
you will not cease. As for money,&mdash;when you want
it, it is yours."</p>

<p>Chloe made a dignified bow and moved away in
silence.</p>

<p>"Why, missy," she said, as they struck down the
path, "'twas March when we last walked from
Temple House. I never see anything pass like the
time! How is Mrs. Gates, and little Mrs. Drake?
And what are you going to take me there for?
Who wants me? And I won't do a thing when I
get there."</p>

<p>"Don't torment me, Chloe, please."</p>

<p>"No, missy; but why hasn't Marm Roxalana
offered us help in this distracting time? Why
hasn't Tempe run in and out, in her old fashion?
Couldn't have Capen Argus himself been polite in
our affliction?"</p>

<p>"I asked Tempe to keep away, and affliction
requires no politeness."</p>

<p>Nothing more passed. Virginia entered the
house noiselessly, and opened the green-room door.
There was no person in the room with Argus and
Roxalana; Argus was reading a newspaper at the
table, and Roxalana was employed in resting.
Virginia, followed by Chloe, reached the center of
the room before they perceived her.</p>

<p>"I think it is Virginia," Roxalana uttered, without
stirring.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Argus, dropping his newspaper,
and advancing toward her; but he stopped when
he saw her expression.</p>

<p>"Roxalana," said Virginia, "I have brought you
Chloe; will you keep her for me! She will assist
you. There is no place for her at our house."</p>

<p>Roxalana's head became thick at once with the
idea; she could make no reply, but stared at Virginia
with a deep gravity.</p>

<p>"I'm kinder turned away from Mr. Brande's
house," added Chloe. "My salt don't suit his
bread just now. I can't say as I see anything
about here this minute that would make my services
'ceptable. I don't know as my services are
worth anything. At the same time I think they
are, 'specially with dust webs," and she pointed to
one hanging from the ceiling. Roxalana's eyes
mechanically lifted to it, and remained there.</p>

<p>"Keep Chloe?" said Argus, "certainly; thank
you, Virginia, for bringing her. Roxalana will
come to herself in a moment; her tender nerves
can bear no surprise, you know."</p>

<p>Roxalana, shaking with one of her sudden laughs
and pleasantly observing Chloe, said:</p>

<p>"Sit down, then, and make yourself easy."</p>

<p>"Roxalana," said Virginia, kneeling by her, and
speaking in the sweetest tones; "I have seen no
friend for weeks; have you thought of me? I
suffer, Roxalana; the bleeding at my heart has
stopped the flow of tears&mdash;till now."</p>

<p>She hid her face in Roxalana's bosom to stifle
the sobs that strangled and convulsed her.</p>

<p>"Only love may save me," she murmured,&mdash;
"dear, deep, human love; not God's now,&mdash;so far
away."</p>

<p>"My poor girl," said Argus bending over her.</p>

<p>She raised her face, listening, as if she heard
music in the distance broken, yet advancing.</p>

<p>"She has a heavenly face," whispered Roxalana;
"Argus, do you see."</p>

<p>A strange shadow darkened his features for an
instant; she thought he was trying to speak. He
grew very pale&mdash;and turned away silent.</p>

<p>"Argus"&mdash;she spoke sharply&mdash;"are you about to
astonish me?"</p>

<p>"He wishes properly," said Virginia, "to check
me; where shall I find Tempe?" rising from beside
Roxalana subdued as a child.</p>

<p>"She is languid, from the heat," replied Roxalana,
"and has gone to bed."</p>

<p>"And your new friend?"</p>

<p>"Sebastian goes on a journey to-morrow," Argus
answered.</p>

<p>"But he will return,&mdash;not to leave us again,"
added Roxalana.</p>

<p>"Will he live here?" asked Virginia in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Argus.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can not say why not," she answered smiling;
"I hardly know why I asked you. For it is not
strange to me that anybody should choose to live
here."</p>

<p>"His being here makes your loan or gift of Chloe
very welcome. We must have our little domestic
asperities smoothed in his behalf. I fancy he is a
luxurious dog,&mdash;all the West Indians are."</p>

<p>"Marcy," exclaimed Chloe, "you haven't got an
Indian in this family, Capen Gates? It's as bad
as having missis&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly. Argus replied to her
hastily that the Indian he spoke of was a tropical
bird.</p>

<p>While they were speaking the thickness left Roxalana's
head, and a sudden inspiration entered it
that Virginia loved Argus, but Argus did not love
Virginia. Here was a situation to chain her to her
chair for a year! She thought, her features resisting
all expression, her eyes impervious, "I
love them as one. My affection goes between the
two,&mdash;from one to the other, and lies between
them."</p>

<p>To give an expression of her feelings, or to
caress, was almost impossible; so she merely said:</p>

<p>"Your father will send a carriage for you,
Virginia?"</p>

<p>"By and by; I begged him to let us come by the
path."</p>

<p>"Mat Sutcliffe saw you, I'll be bound," said
Argus; "he constitutes himself the guardian of
the path. Is that not like one of Tempe's novels?
Tempe must come in. Can Chloe go for her? Try
your first errand, Chloe."</p>

<p>Sebastian opened the door, entering as she passed
him, with letters in his hand. Seeing Virginia, he
adroitly stuffed them in his pocket, approached her
with a deep bow, and stood as if he were waiting
for her to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Where is my jonquil?" she asked, with a bright
look.</p>

<p>"Pardon me; it is so long since. Did you present
one to me?"</p>

<p>"Man's memory is like his love, I am afraid,&mdash;'a
thing apart.'"</p>

<p>"Hush, Virginia, he knows nothing of Byron;
it surprises me to hear <i>you</i> parody him," exclaimed
Argus.</p>

<p>"She is <i>not</i> the queen of heaven," thought Sebastian,
"only a noble-looking creature of the
earth. And something has moved her."</p>

<p>She carelessly seated herself in the recess of the
window upon a high bench. A cloud of brilliant
white muslin rose about her; her beautiful foot,
sandaled with black ribbon, tossed under it; her
slender white hand, on which diamonds shone, was
half hid in its fold; a lovely flush had come into
her usually pale face, and the silky tresses of her
black hair strayed down her cheek; her full lips
were apart, as if she could not breathe otherwise;
and the blue knot of ribbon on her breast beat
rapidly. Sebastian as carelessly seated himself on
the bench beside her.</p>

<p>"And so you are to return?" she said, in a low
voice. "If I were you, I should not go away."</p>

<p>"I am sent for. But why would <i>you</i> stay?"</p>

<p>"I only know I love them all,&mdash;their lives enchant
me. I can not solve the enigma. That you
can do so I have no doubt."</p>

<p>"I do not love them all. I love Argus."</p>

<p>Their faces were now turned to the window,
which was open; Virginia pulled a twig from a
bush beneath it, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "I love Argus."</p>

<p>"I am glad you do. I know no person requiring
love more. But is this the way with men of
the world?" He frowned slightly; she thought
she never saw eyes with so strange a lustre, nor
eyebrows so intimidating.</p>

<p>"Don't make me convict myself of sentiment,"
he begged. "How is it an enigma with you, since
you too say 'I love them'?"</p>

<p>Tempe burst into the room, crying, "What has
brought Brande's Chloe here? I saw her prowling
about, and ran. Oh, Virginia, have you come at
last? Let me sit beside her, Sebastian."</p>

<p>She pulled him by the sleeve, and crept into his
place, and nestled close to Virginia.</p>

<p>"You look mighty cool and gauzy, Virginia,"
she said. "This black muslin of mine makes me
sick,&mdash;mean, smutty stuff! If you haven't got a
new watch! Let me see it."</p>

<p>"It is my birthday gift," said Virginia, slipping
it from her belt.</p>

<p>The glittering diamonds caught Sebastian's
eyes.</p>

<p>"When have I seen diamonds?" he murmured
absently. "I detest them. I thought they were
drowned."</p>

<p>"So I should suppose," said Tempe. "They
grow in the ground where you lived; with us they
are like stars."</p>

<p>She held the watch against her cheek, which
looked a little sunken, and fixed a sideways glance
on him, with immense, haggard eyes, that nearly
covered her face. He smiled at her kindly.</p>

<p>"How old are you, Virginia?" asked Roxalana.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three."</p>

<p>Argus sauntered up to her from the opposite
side of the dimly lighted room.</p>

<p>"Take care," he said to her. "I see lines in
your forehead. Are you hurrying to overtake the
wrinkles in mine?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Argus,&mdash;don't be foolish," said Tempe.
"You are a dreadfully old man, while Virginia
is a fresh beauty. I am glad to see it."</p>

<p>"The old men are immortal," said Sebastian,
"when Aurora loves them."</p>

<p>"I hear wheels," cried Virginia, "now I must
leave you. When,&mdash;when shall I see you again?"</p>

<p>"Let us trust soon," answered Argus gravely.
"It is impossible for us to offer you any service,&mdash;that
we know. Come, I'll walk down to the gate
with you. Chloe will be there, and I will shut off
her hysterics."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Tempe; "I am going home with
you."</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, "I do not wish you to
go; neither does Virginia wish it."</p>

<p>"I shall go, mother."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" called out Argus from the door.
"Stay where you are, you have seen the new
watch."</p>

<p>Tempe's eyes filled.</p>

<p>"What can prevent my going?"</p>

<p>"Let her go, Roxalana," said Sebastian. "It is
best."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, mother, you will see me." And
Tempe ran down the lawn, past Argus and Virginia,
and sprang into the carriage.</p>

<p>"The brat is going, after all," said Argus; "but
you will take care of her."</p>

<p>"She may go," replied Virginia; "but you know
that I can not take care of her."</p>

<p>"It takes all your powers to preserve the fine
balance we admire in you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Argus,&mdash;the courtly Sebastian makes you
false."</p>

<p>"I am verging on my second childhood,&mdash;that
is all."</p>

<p>"It does not please me to see you soften so; it
threatens one."</p>

<p>"Seriously, I find that I am weaker. I supposed
my fibres as tough as those of your father, my ancient
ally. He is a consistent man. Admire him,
Virginia."</p>

<p>"Now are you ready?" called Tempe. "Ask
Moses to drive along Bank street. Good-night,
my lovely uncle."</p>

<p>"Good-night, little weedy one."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to go by Bank street?"
asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"At the end of Bank street," answered Tempe
sharply, shuddering,&mdash;"do we not come upon
Burying Hill? Sha'n't we see every white stone
on its summit shining in the moonlight? I wish
to take a look at them. You may view the bay
on the other side of the street. Water and
moonshine represent that which pleases you; the
vague and the mysterious. The high, solid mound
of earth, filled with lesser mounds numbered with
blocks of marble, represents that which I am in
search of. Here we are already, at the end of the
street. The desert opens&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tempe leaned out of the carriage, and was silent.
Virginia, struck with her mood and with the scene,
was silent also. Moses, as if in sympathy with the
occasion, checked his horses, and they walked at a
funeral pace down the street along which ran the
wide base of the graveyard hill. The wheels
grazed the edge of the bank on the opposite side,
and below it stretched the bay. No sound came
from the grassy beds of the dead; the air passed
over them without a sigh. The bay was almost as
quiet; along the sandy shore its volume gravely,
gently pressed, and rolled in illumination; its surface,
as far as the horizon rounded the bay,&mdash;a dim
dark coil,&mdash;was one mass of swaying moon-rays,&mdash;the
bed of "silvery gods." Virginia's senses
fluttered as they came in contact with the spirit of
the night; Ah, could she but bring Argus here!
When he walked beside her just now, under the
drooping elms, in a sacred darkness, and she felt
the leaves softly brushing against them,&mdash;why was
she not permitted the inspiration given her now?
The bright, piercing sweetness of the hour touched
her lips with a fire which should be kindled on
his lips also. Icy, stern, unyielding as they were,
they could but melt and weld with hers in that
first and, alas, only kiss born of virgin passion,&mdash;which
expires when it is born, whose beautiful ghost
haunts men's minds forever, tempting them to pursue
every path which diverges from every faculty.</p>

<p>Her hands reached up into the air imploringly;
they fell back on Tempe&mdash;Tempe contemplating
the grave!</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she cried, "in a moment, Virginia.
Tell him to drive fast now; we shall soon be out
of sight of it."</p>

<p>The carriage wound round the hill, and struck
on the lonely road leading to the Forge. Turning
to Virginia, Tempe said:</p>

<p>"That was for good. I have found the sermon
whose text has been running in my mind lately. I
know, now, that I never loved him. I don't care
that" (snapping her fingers) "for his memory;
the sight of his monument did not move me one
whit. I don't believe I have been wicked. What
are we to do, if a positive feeling keeps contradicting
the conscience bought and paid for?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Tempe; how wild you are!"</p>

<p>"You can feel my pulse. I am as cool as yourself;
and am about to put myself under your
training."</p>

<p>To prove the truth of her remarks, she broke
into violent weeping, and Virginia, obliged to forego
her own mood,&mdash;her entrancing speculations,&mdash;soothed
her, instead of telling her how cruel and
unmindful she was. Tempe held her hands, and
lay on her shoulder, till, irritated beyond endurance,
Virginia began humming between her teeth,
and Tempe, remembering that sign of impatience,
grew gentle and wheedling.</p>

<p>"Let out your voice," she coaxed. "Come, are
you not sentimental? I know so. Sentimental
folks sing, and make verses,&mdash;especially late at
night."</p>

<p>"If I sing for you, will you let me take you
home?"</p>

<p>"No: Sebastian must be gone first. In the
morning I shall go back, and find myself minus
any number of bows from his grandeeship."</p>

<p>Tempe was suddenly quenched by Virginia's
voice, which smote the air with the passion of a
nightingale:</p>

<p>"Hark! like the swell of the ocean,<br/>

The blood throbs through my heart,<br/>

At a flitting, shadowy fancy<br/>

That to-morrow&mdash;you depart.</p>

<p>Hark to the swell of the ocean!<br/>

Our last words have been said&mdash;<br/>

And the wings of my flitting fancy<br/>

To-morrow will fan me&mdash;dead!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

</div>

<p>THE lines which Argus avowed were on Virginia's
forehead, really appeared between her
dark eyebrows,&mdash;the bar-sinister in her history.
Her father observed the shadow in her face and
misinterpreted it; to some beholders it would have
seemed as sweet and somber as a summer landscape
in the shadows of a setting sun, when its
rays slowly change the appearance of wood and
meadow without disturbing their character. The
vision of <i>possession</i> impossible to be obtained had
passed across Virginia's mind, and left a trace in
her face, more beautiful now than before. Dreary
days followed her visit to Temple House. Outside
was the arid flush of August; the grass was
dry and brown, the shrubs gray with dust, and
overrun with insects; the sky was like blue enamel,
beneath which white boiling vapors spread and
vanished. Inside was the wretched spectacle which
Mrs. Brande continually presented. Virginia felt
herself a mechanical force, merely set in motion
by her mother's necessities, or her father's
demands. It is certain that he was not touched
by the ordinary punishments of life. Other men at
this time would have shown anger or dejection, or
have absented themselves for business or diversion;
but he applied a nicer regularity to his and
Virginia's habits. Many troubles fell on him. His
business unexpectedly went wrong; an outside
connection failed him, and he lost money. Even
the Forge was threatened; should its fires go
down, two hundred men, a large share of whom
were improvident and intemperate, would be
thrown out of employment,&mdash;and a force be thrown
into the town the consequences of which he might
have to answer for. There were no other iron
works within a hundred miles, and none in the
county besides manufactured an engine for which
he had imported many of these English and Scotch
workmen. A mad wife sat at his board and slept
in his bed. The effect of the crimson and green,
the yellow and blue of the walls, decorations, and
furniture of his house, was imprisonment. Virginia
was a caged bird. Financial ruin perched
over the ledgers in his office. The church, with
its clinging, personal government, pressed upon
him, and Kent, with a hundred sapless social interests,
curbed and fretted even the freedom of his
perplexity. Through it all, however, he carried
high his smooth-shaven, long chin; flourished his
fine cambric handkerchief,&mdash;a furled flag over his
knee, or a waving banner in his hand; and kept
the pupils of his eyes within their limits. In every
situation his mind strove for the inspiration which
must come to declare safety and success. It flashed
into his mind one evening at a conference meeting,
while he was giving a short exhortation from
the text, "A good tree can not bring forth evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
fruit," and he laid hold of the high mahogany railing
in front of him as if it were the lever by which
he was raising destiny to his level. When the
brethren at the close of the meeting exchanged
customary salutations, they remarked upon brother
Brande's fervor; rich as he was in worldly favor,
it appeared to them only a mirror which reflected
his piety. That night, the old tortoise-shell cat
who lived in the premises of his office purred beside
him, dozed and blinked her green eyes in the
pleasant silence of his motionless figure, as he sat
absorbed in thought. He trifled and toyed with
the plan; let it run from him; bit it, cuffed it, and
finally closed upon it, with a sharp, smiling energy,
and mastered it. He did not leave his office till
breakfast time,&mdash;six o'clock,&mdash;on a fair, dewy, summer
morning, when the St. John's wort blossomed
everywhere, even on the borders of the blackened
path across which he walked. Meeting Virginia
on her way from her mother's room, he followed
her into her own chamber, and adjusting a picture
which hung awry, asked her how her mother had
passed the night.</p>

<p>"As usual," was the reply.</p>

<p>He took a chair, and Virginia sat down also.</p>

<p>"You have not remained with your mother any
whole night till now, if I rightly recollect. Do
you think her incurably insane?"</p>

<p>At this question her experience compelled an intuitive
preparation for some inevitable change
which she must agree to, and its necessity sharpened
her ever-rising opposition.</p>

<p>"She is incurably insane," he continued, having
obtained no answer; "but she may live for years.
I propose taking her to Dr. Tell's asylum, for I dare
not leave her with you;&mdash;she may grow violent
again while I am on my journey. I am going to
see my old friend Carfield, on business."</p>

<p>"Wherever she is, sir, the burden will be the
same to me. I must still be a dutiful daughter. I
rebel against the service, though; it hurts, and
stains, and tears. I am only <i>saying</i> this, you
know; the family tie so binds my feet that I can
not advance one step in any path where my soul
should take its pride and pleasure."</p>

<p>"You venture to deduct your personality from
the relations with which Providence surrounds you!
My daughter, we may not do this. Mankind is a
groveling herd, beneath the pressure of a mighty
hand; let no one raise his forehead above the mass,
with the excuse of '<i>me</i>' written on it. You astonish
me"&mdash;he paused an instant, with the thought that
she did not astonish him, except in speaking so
recklessly of treasures never to be spent. "Let me
ask you," he resumed, "since you are so fearless
with speculations you have no business with as a
well-trained girl,&mdash;to suppose one,&mdash;a man powerful
enough to dictate himself any course in
life,&mdash;what limit would there be to his subtle
crimes? I say, they would be as incessant as his
breath."</p>

<p>"I do suppose such a man," she cried, with kindling
eyes, "but one incapable of crime."</p>

<p>"He does not exist, except in the fancy of brainless
women. Virginia, comprehend yourself, if you
have the ability, but let your knowledge in no wise
be tampered with by a specious will. We are in
this world for other reasons than to live, and move,
and have our being. Ta,&mdash;your shoe-lace is unfastened."</p>

<p>He moved towards the door, but suddenly turned
towards her again, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you be ready to accompany Mrs. Brande
to Dr. Tell's by the close of the week? Attend
carefully to her dress. The letters which may arrive
for me while I am absent, must be first looked
at by yourself; if they contain no claims upon me
return them to the head clerk for answer. Please
order a new set of lace curtains for the west chamber,
as you know your mother has amused herself
with embroidering the old ones with twine. It is
possible that young Carfield may return with me."

<p>"I shall attend to your requests."</p>

<p>"Get Chloe back if you like."</p>

<p>"No, I think not."</p>

<p>"Ah; come down and give me my breakfast.
Did you ask me about my business embarrassments?
They will amount to nothing; you are not to read
my letters, except with your eyes. Certainly, my
daughter, my affairs have caused the change you
and I have decided upon. Is that a new color&mdash;the
stripe in your dress? You are too tall to wear
stripes,&mdash;broad ones, especially. I remark that I
dislike that stripe exceedingly. Why do you wear
the dress?"</p>

<p>"Shall I change it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I will wait for my breakfast a short time,
of course; but it will be waiting."</p>

<p>He descended the stairs leisurely, whisking the
balusters with his handkerchief, and sharply listening
for a sound from his wife's room. Before he
reached the foot of the stairs, she opened her door,
and hung over the railing from above; he looked
up and stopped. There was a light in her face
which had been there before, but so long ago that
he remembered he was only twenty years old when
he married her. There was something bright and
pleading in her poor eyes, something sad and quivering
about her poor lips,&mdash;yet he could have cursed
her for blasting so many years since then, bravely
as he had carried them.</p>

<p>"Cyrus," she said in a low voice, "are you going
to bury me in Sodom or Gomorrah? My feet and
legs are already dead. Leave my head above the
ground, sweet Cyrus, for you know I am Rhoda-Cyrus.
To tell you the truth, now, and oh, how
many times I have lied to you, my godly boy! my
head won't die; it's full of ramshackle;&mdash;see how
it goes."</p>

<p>Her head nodded from side to side, but he scarcely
noticed it, he was so full of the hope that <i>she might
be dying</i>, and it made his heart beat. He stretched
out his hand, and mildly said:</p>

<p>"Come down, Mrs. Brande, for breakfast is late.
Come; I would like to have you see Virginia's new
dress."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she answered, limping along. "You'll
forget what I said about the vine-clad Noah; I
never meant it."</p>

<p>Offering her his arm, he looked into her face
earnestly.</p>

<p>"It was the sun shining through those green
shades," he said to himself, "nothing better."</p>

<p>Just before his departure, Argus surprised him
by calling at his office,&mdash;a place they had not met
in since their business transactions were closed,
when George Gates was mysteriously discovered&mdash;dead.
Mr. Brande passed the palm of his hand
softly along the green cloth of his desk as Argus
approached him at an easy pace, and a fear touched
him; was it possible that the cold-headed Gates
had learned he was in danger of foundering?</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Argus, slipping into a chair,
and twisting his long legs together, "that some
cursed association has sent me here. I am in want
of money,&mdash;damnably so; not so damned damnedly
as before, however, for it is for a friend this time,&mdash;Sebastian
Ford, not George Gates, my brother.
How do you suppose his spirit contrives to exist,
Brande, unless he can sponge on the saints?"</p>

<p>"Ta. Do you expect to get back any cash that
you may advance to your friend?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> will. He has drawn on me for a thousand
dollars. I have not got much over a thousand
cents."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande tore a check out of an attractive
looking folio, filled in the required sum, and handed
it to Argus, saying, "I am glad to be able to oblige
you." Argus perceived the ring of truth in his
accent, and asked him if he really placed no value
on a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"If I were a hypocrite, I should answer that I
only value money for the advantage it gives me in
aiding others; as I am not, I own I appreciate the
fact that every age has been governed by what
money it could produce,&mdash;iron, brass, or gold.
Why don't you improve Temple House, and sell it?
The brink of ruin would not suggest that idea,
though. <i>The brink of ruin!</i>" gasping out the last
words.</p>

<p>"What the devil ails you, Brande? Has the
drinking of sanctimonious sherry strained your
head? Change your tipple."</p>

<p>"So you come to <i>me</i> for money to-day, Gates?"</p>

<p>"I feel sure that this is the evidence of my so
doing." And Argus looked at the check.</p>

<p>Cyrus smiled faintly. Argus rose to go.</p>

<p>"I do not yet know," he said, "when Sebastian
will return; when he does, the color of the thousand
will reappear in this very spot."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Cyrus absently.</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. Brande is better." Argus said,
with a courteous gesture.</p>

<p>"Hope her dead. Gates, for God's sake!" cried
Cyrus, amazing himself as well as Argus with a
burst of nature.</p>

<p>"For Virginia's sake," Argus answered gravely.</p>

<p>"I am going to take my wife to a mad-house tomorrow,
and keep her there; she is a beast, and a
frantic idiot, and has made my soul sick."</p>

<p>"Virginia!" said Argus again.</p>

<p>"Let Virginia alone, and pity me." The tears
were streaming from his eyes like rain; he had
rolled his handkerchief into a ball, which he held
tightly. Argus backed gently to the door. It
seemed to him that the fabric of Cyrus's life was
dropping to pieces all at once; he wished to get
away before it fell to utter ruin. The coldness in
Argus's face stopped the flow of tears from Cyrus,
as ice stops the flow of blood from a wound.</p>

<p>"I am astonished," he said presently; "astonished
that I should be given over to such wandering.
The sight of you, Gates, has done this. Be
off, my dear sir; I must compose my mind."</p>

<p>"It is necessary, Brande, dropping all cant, for
us to arrange our condition with a view to composure.
We are tricked, however, now and then&mdash;our
opponent gets the odds; I consider you an uncommon
victim. It will blow over, though."</p>

<p>"Good-day, Gates."</p>

<p>The office door closed, and Cyrus felt that it enclosed
a smaller man than it did when Argus entered.
He ground his teeth with hatred of the
tears which had so suddenly fallen; "Gates," he
thought, "is an <i>adversary</i>."</p>

<p>"Brande and I are growing old," was the comment
of Argus. "Pshaw, why hasn't he killed
that wretch before there was a chance of his crying
over her. Poor Virginia!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

</div>

<p>WIDE vistas of sunshine opened from the doors
and windows,&mdash;spaces left bright and tranquil
by the absence of the Brandes. Neither at door nor
window, nor in any avenue, except that which leads
to the dark gate whose latch clicks in the ears of
mortality but once,&mdash;was Rhoda-Cyrus seen again.
The merciless combination, deserved in her case,
which is sometimes unaccountably made against
individuals to punish weakness, error and crime,
crushed her.</p>

<p>Mr. Brande staid away weeks instead of days, as
he had anticipated, and in consequence work was
suspended at the Forge,&mdash;to be resumed, he wrote,
upon his return. A loneliness which grew into a
revelation to Virginia prevailed in her domain.
She heard the ripples of Apsley river, as they
gently swept upon the little sand flats left bare by
the summer drought, and inhaled the odors which
silence expresses in woods and flowery thickets.
Her wretched cares were gone; the influence of
that propinquity which governed and belittled her,
shred itself like a husk from the nature capable
of enduring great solitude. Sitting in the doorways,
as she loved to do, before the river, or facing
the empty Forge, and beyond the feathery
tops of the pine grove, with eyes watchful of all
within and without, she felt a new intelligence,
sad, subtle and sweet, which she could enjoy, but
not define. The halcyon day broods alone on
the placid ocean of time, and this day, covering
many mornings and evenings, ended naturally and
inevitably. Wandering to the grove one day, she
met Tempe, who sat at the foot of a tree, contemplating
a handful of cones.</p>

<p>"Our lady of the manor," she said snappishly,
without raising her eyes.</p>

<p>Virginia held out her hand, with the feeling that
a forgotten existence was re-beginning, but Tempe
did not take it; she dropped the cones one by one,
speaking: "She loves me a little&mdash;not much&mdash;none
at all!"</p>

<p>"How long have you been playing in the grove,
Tempe?"</p>

<p>"Not as long as you have been playing solitude
at home. Mother has been looking for you at
every window in the house for a long time. We
knew you were at liberty. You couldn't even send
for me; however, I shall visit you every day from
this out. I am extravagantly fond of exercise. I
intend to ruin my constitution with walking. I will
walk. What are you looking at me for, with
cucumber eyes? I am tired to death with your
coolness. Oh, Virginia, can you help me? You
must do something for me. I feel as if I were
about to die."</p>

<p>"Come home with me, then," said Virginia impatiently;
"but I will not have you so flighty.
Suppose Roxalana did watch for me,&mdash;she knew a
little solitude should be spared me. Well, I have
had it, it is over; I am quite ready to attend to
you."</p>

<p>"<i>Attend!</i> I conclude you are the administrator
of my estate!"</p>

<p>"How is Chloe?"</p>

<p>"She has imported her Brande customs. Mother
allows her to stand behind her chair at the table;
she keeps an Indian silence, though, before uncle
Argus."</p>

<p>The picture of the past unrolled in Virginia's
mind like a dun cloud, in which the striving forms
of her mother, Chloe, and her father, were gigantically
visible. She looked about her for the spirits
of the air so lately with her, but nature had
withdrawn her new friends.</p>

<p>"Something should be done for <i>me</i>, Tempe."</p>

<p>"The idea! As if you ever needed being done
for! I hear of your troubles, but can't see them.
You keep healthy, well-dressed, and your glacial
air. What would you have?"</p>

<p>"I would be turned into an old, benevolent,
crooked fairy, for the sake of conferring upon you
the power of dropping pearls and diamonds through
your speech."</p>

<p>"Much obliged," Tempe replied, with a blush;
"wouldn't it be more in your line to change rats,
mice, and pumpkins, into horses and coach, with
which I might go in search of the young prince?
In that case I should be happy to offer you a seat
in my carriage. Come, I am ready."</p>

<p>They started arm in arm, Tempe either pushing
forward, or lagging backwards, and spasmodically
voluble in fault-finding.</p>

<p>"Tell me news," begged Virginia. "How is
Argus? When does the friend, Mr. Ford, return?"</p>

<p>"Argus sits out of doors now, under the elms.
His chin has got an upward cant from investigating
the air for mysterious tidings of that Sebastian
Ford; but at present uncle Hunks is mild. He
says 'yea,' and 'nay,' without showing teeth or
claws; isn't he a miser, though? Yesterday Mat
Sutcliffe caught him. 'Cuss me to dregs, marm,'
he said to mother, 'if Capen Gates isn't in the
summer-house trying to sew a patch on his shoe.
But he can't do it; God has not given his otherwise
able constitution the cobbling gift.'"</p>

<p>"What did Roxalana answer, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"She answered '<i>Sebastian</i>;' and Mat sat down,
put his hat under the chair, and railed at contrarywise
things till mother ordered him to leave."</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> Sebastian coming back?" Virginia asked
drearily.</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Argus sacrifices himself to that man."</p>

<p>"Say, rather," cried Tempe, vehemently, "that
he returns thanks, and makes offerings to himself,
for being occupied with an emotion worthy of and
in harmony with his character. I feel a little
strange upon the strength of his theory; the air is
full of moving black specks."</p>

<p>Her head dropped heavily on Virginia's shoulder,
and her arms fell limp and helpless.</p>

<p>"Keep up, Tempe, you are faint only. We are
nearly home; I see Moses now,&mdash;Moses!"</p>

<p>Moses hurried out of the yard at her call, and
together they carried Tempe into the house.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Martha, the cook, from behind
her, where she was endeavoring to unfasten her
dress, while Virginia was wetting her face with
cologne-water, "you know the circumstances this
young woman is in."</p>

<p>"I should think so,&mdash;a fainting-fit is evident
enough."</p>

<p>"It won't be long," continued Martha, in a tone
of contempt, "before this vale of tears will be burdened
with another crying soul in swaddling
bands; though I don't know that it will be allowed
the bands, for Miss Hopkins, the best nurse in
Kent, says the faculties don't approve of 'em."</p>

<p>Virginia rose up in mute astonishment, and mechanically
applied the cologne-water to her own
forehead.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't so," gasped Tempe, opening her eyes
upon Martha. "There isn't a word of truth in
what you have said. I'll die first." And she
struggled to her feet, eyeing Virginia defiantly.
"I never was better; and I have come to take tea
with you, Martha."</p>

<p>Virginia immediately ordered Moses to harness
one of the horses, and be in readiness to drive
Mrs. Drake home; and Tempe, in spite of her
protestations to the contrary, soon found herself
there.</p>

<p>"It has turned out," said Roxalana, after reading
a note which Moses had delivered, "as I had
expected,&mdash;that you would be sent home suddenly
from somewhere; and now I demand that you
remain near me."</p>

<p>"Mother Roxalana Gates, you ought to be the
last person to insult me. I say, I shall go out of
doors daily."</p>

<p>"It is the most absurd thing I ever heard,&mdash;
going out at present."</p>

<p>Tempe stamped her feet violently, and Roxalana,
from a momentary terror, winked her usually
impassive eyelids; then recovering herself, she
lifted Tempe, and carried her upstairs as if she
had been a feather.</p>

<p>"Cruel old Egyptian woman!" said Tempe, out
of breath. "I am happy to say that I do not love
you, nor any woman. I hated Virginia to-day, and
I'll tell her so to-morrow."</p>

<p>Roxalana watched her in silence; and at last
Tempe kicked her shoes off, and tugged at the
fastenings of her clothes.</p>

<p>"You've had no supper," said Roxalana
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I'll taste nothing to-night, nor to-morrow, nor
the next day. Should you happen to leave the
room, I might go to sleep, however."</p>

<p>Roxalana, seeing that she was in earnest, left her
with the excuse of attending to supper, but immediately
sent Chloe after Mary Sutcliffe.</p>

<p>Before morning a son was born to Tempe. At
its first cry on being compelled to breathe the air
of an alien world, Roxalana took it, and said in a
voice which sounded like the ringing bells of an
under world:</p>

<p>"I name this child <i>George Gates</i>."</p>

<p>Two great tears rolled from her eyes, and baptized
the babe in sorrow, remembrance, and hope.
Then she held the treasure up to Tempe, and
Tempe resolutely shut her eyes against it.</p>

<p>When Mary Sutcliffe emerged from the outside
door at daybreak, Mat, who was lounging on the
steps, caught her and swept her along; then he
brought her to a standstill, stopped, and asked:
"Why the devil can't you tell me the news?"</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" answered Mary, with a groan,
determined to scare and punish him for his foolish
fondness for Tempe.</p>

<p>"Hold your jaw," he said, planting his feet
apart, to keep himself steady, being seized with a
giddiness.</p>

<p>"She's all right, I tell you!" screamed Mary,
frightened at the effect of her trick. "Roxalana
named it George."</p>

<p>Somehow Mat was not able to curse her as she
expected: he was still a moment, and then spoke,
as if to himself:</p>

<p>"Named it George, has she? I shall have to
give in, and own up to women's souls. 'Tis so, or
she'd never hand down that rascal's name. How is
little Tempe!"</p>

<p>"Tempe is a devil-cat,&mdash;same as ever. You'd
better go back and wake up Argus; I don't
think he will be much pleased, either. Somehow
or other I shall get word to the Drakes to-day."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> old Drake's grandson, that's a fact; I had
forgotten all about that ere family."</p>

<p>"I am in hopes they'll send something worth
while to it, though the Gates family have behaved
shamefully to the Drake family."</p>

<p>"How's that, Moll?"</p>

<p>"They've let 'em alone so entirely."</p>

<p>Mat laughed, and continued good-natured all
that day, being secretly happy over the fact of
what he called the Gates Continuation; there was
no other chance for the family survivorship, and,
for his part he wanted to leave a Gates above
ground, when he took his final dip. Mary, also,
was secretly proud of the baby, and took pains, as
she had promised, to have the Drakes informed concerning
it. Mrs. Drake hurried out for appearances
sake, and bought a basket arranged for the unhappiness
of infants,&mdash;filled it with cambric robes, and
sent it with her love. Mr. Drake sent a heavy silver
cup and congratulations. Tempe measured the
depth of the embroidery on the robes with her languid
fingers, and swung the cup by its handle.
When the baby was a week old, Virginia called upon
it with a box of toys, and looked at the little creature
with awe and amazement.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see so fine a child?" asked Roxalana.</p>

<p>"Did you know before," asked Tempe, "that
the human young was uglier than anything on the
earth?"</p>

<p>"See its perfect hand," continued Roxalana,
"its soft, brown hair. And it knows a great deal
already."</p>

<p>"What does Argus say?" Virginia asked, somewhat
embarrassed at Roxalana's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"He says that the world is overpeopled," Tempe
replied.</p>

<p>Roxalana looked up at Virginia, with a sad,
dumb smile.</p>

<p>"He says what he should say," continued
Tempe; "I had no idea, till now, how much Uncle
Argus and myself are alike."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tempe!" cried Virginia, indignantly, but
was prevented from going on by Roxalana's placing
the baby in a large arm-chair, its present cradle,
and motioning her to go out.</p>

<p>"Have you had new dresses lately?" asked
Tempe, as Virginia rose hastily, and adjusted her
mantilla. "I believe you can wear every color.
A corn-colored barege is the last thing I should
have chosen, but it becomes you. Come here, and
let me examine the trimming."</p>

<p>Virginia approached, and felt a degree of remorse
at the touch of Tempe's hot, fragile hand, as
it passed over the rosettes of her showy dress.
"I might as well," Tempe continued, "expect to
sit upon a cloud with gauzy angels, as expect a
dress so rich, peculiar, and attractive as this. Do
you, can you, imagine the state I am in&mdash;a chronic
shuffle between shabby black and a night-gown?
Stop! Don't dare to offer <i>me</i> a present. I offer
you my thoughts and opinions freely, and do not
wish for the return I can guess you would like to
make; but I won't be shut up. I know you are
generous. There, go, I am tired. Give me the
box of toys first,&mdash;I want to see what you have
brought Old Bunch."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Roxalana, accompanying Virginia
downstairs, "it is certain Tempe's behavior
is outrageous. She <i>is</i> the same under all circumstances.
She resembles Argus in nothing; I should
be sorry to have you influenced a moment by her
rash opinions."</p>

<p>The expression of sincerity in Roxalana's face,
and the transparency of her diplomacy, were overpowering.
Virginia could only kiss her on each
cheek without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"I don't think it quite safe," Roxalana went on,
"to leave Tempe; I am not sure that in some
freak she will not hide the baby from me. I believe
she is deficient in what is called natural affection;
how can it be helped? To tell the truth, I
have little faith in it; it is a habit, a tradition,&mdash;irksome,
terrible, destroying sometimes, as I have
seen; so we will not condemn Tempe."</p>

<p>Her hard, rude speech smote Virginia like a salt
breeze, wholesome because so utterly sincere; but
it toppled down not only her theory but her practice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roxalana, a dark red rising in her
swarthy face, a steely illumination breaking through
her eyes, "I am convinced by my years that friendship,
love, the singular emotion which rises like a
wall of rock, or fire, or ice, and hides, protects, and
separates two souls, man and woman, from all
other men and women, have little to do with our
circumstances, acts, and duties; they come from
the nameless Spirit in our consciousness, whose
face we never see, and whose will we never understand."</p>

<p>She paused with her heavy lips apart, as if she
had been obedient merely to the Spirit she had
named, and as if she were ignorant whether its
large utterance would continue. Virginia felt a
great envy before this simple, unselfish woman, so
incapable of being swerved from her narrow
bounds; then she grew proud because she loved
her.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Roxalana, "I am indebted to
you for Chloe. I should hardly know how to manage
without her. I don't think there is much waste
about her. I hope you intend that she shall
remain?"</p>

<p>"Now, Roxalana, will you let me breathe?
You are welcome to her. I am glad I can do that
much. Go back to Tempe; I will see Chloe, and
then walk home by the path. The shrubs, Roxalana,
are turning already before the frost. But
what a long year! It seems ten years since I last
picked the umber-streaked smilax and the yellow
sassafras, going home from my happy visits."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Sebastian has doubled the year! You
will find Chloe in the kitchen. Farewell, Virginia."</p>

<p>"Farewell, Roxalana."</p>

<p>"I knowed you were here, missey," called Chloe
from the half-opened kitchen door, before Roxalana
had disappeared from the upper hall. "I'se
longing for the Forge since sunrise. There's no
smell of coal in this God-forsaken house. But I
ain't plagued here, by no one. <i>He's</i> out in the garden
now, a-thinking these three hours. What people
have to think of when there is no religion in
them, is past my finding out. Missey, how be you,
my dear child? You have nothing good to say;
keep your mouth shut. My knees know more than
my tongue can speak. Sit down, if you will; do
you think it looks clean? Shu! Mrs. Roxalana's
kitchen work pizened me. She isn't more than half
facultied, between you and me; but the captain is
tidy, and sharp,&mdash;nobody can say more than this
in his favor; 'taint to <i>be</i> said. I suppose I was
sent to labor in this field; there is a reason besides
why I should stay. Can you guess it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They are Indians,&mdash;now they be, in spite of
white skins and learning. You needn't look so incalulous!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Virginia answered absently, stepping
to the window and looking down the garden.
"I should like a sprig of box, Chloe. How cool
and bright the dark borders look."</p>

<p>"Help yourself, missey."</p>

<p>She had vanished, and was already hovering over
the mounds of antique box,&mdash;a fanciful reminder
of those slow-moving, brilliant autumnal butterflies,
whose silent, varying flight suggests that they
search for a mystery which the crooked vales of
air and the uneven surface of verdure hides. Her
heart went forward to the summer-house, dictating
her feet to follow. It was the bold, trembling, inspired
moment which occasionally seizes one, and
leads on to a crisis, which becomes astounding,
when it has passed. Argus was seated on a low
settee of boughs and wattles, his arm resting on a
little table of the same material; his hand hung
over its edge. He had given over thinking, to fall
into a quiet slumber which had removed his sarcastic
frown, his contemptuous smile. Pale, yellow
bars, and patches shaped like leaves, played on the
wall behind him, dropped on his grizzled chestnut
hair, across his breast and arms, like impalpable,
swift lizards. Virginia felt rather than saw that
his eyes were closed as she approached and stood
before him. Her heart was beating so she had to
wait for her breath to come and go more quietly.
She watched the light playing over his cold steadfast
face; his bowed head and long drooping
hands, so fixed and motionless in their pale hue,
reminding her of the pictures in illuminated missals.
Stooping towards him, she softly put her
hands in his, and was caught in an iron grasp.
Argus stood up, wide awake, and drew her close to
him; their eyes met, and instantly he disengaged
his hands.</p>

<p>"Why, my girl, Virginia," he whispered, turning
his face away; but she struck him lightly, and said:</p>

<p>"Look again, Argus, and read me something."</p>

<p>He was obliged to meet her eyes again, and as
he did so a faint streak of color passed over his
face. It seemed to him that he was recalling
something that had happened long ago,&mdash;events,
or incidents, which perplexed him when passing,
although he did not know it till now. He shook
his head involuntarily. Virginia started back; her hat
fell, dropping between them; Argus frowned at it,
as if a positive obstacle intervened; he muttered
something, and picked it up. She took it and
moved towards the door of the summer-house, still
facing him; she looked so sweet, so sincere and
womanly, that a mingled pang of longing and
regret seized and shook him terribly,&mdash;still he only
allowed himself to mutter again unintelligible
words.</p>

<p>"Argus!" she called quietly. Her face was
hard and set now, but by her smile he saw she was
deeply hurt; he sprang towards her.</p>

<p>"You would have me confess, Virginia, that I
am a man, after all, and that I am touched by
the flame burning in <i>you</i>. Does it please you to
hear me? As for oaths,&mdash;come here,&mdash;put your
head against my heart,&mdash;it swears by what it must
reject."</p>

<p>"It moves, Argus, does it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, physically."</p>

<p>She shuddered violently.</p>

<p>"Don't," he cried.</p>

<p>It seemed she could not speak. She was
strangely pale, and languidly rested her head
against the door which she had reached by slow
degrees, retreating steps; she opened her hands
as if shaking something from them. He laughed
slightly, and, as pale as herself, said:</p>

<p>"I wish that one of us could escape."</p>

<p>"I must go," she answered, after a moment's
silence, during which Argus felt that he could pull
the summer-house down, to cover a caress which
would have no hereafter.</p>

<p>"But let me say," she spoke now in a clear
voice, "as I go, how rare this interview seems."</p>

<p>"Rare!"</p>

<p>"The combination never came to <i>me</i>, till
now,&mdash;when emotion suited the circumstances,
and time and place fitting, too; I have missed
them hitherto."</p>

<p>She was gone, and Argus, in spite of an astonished
disappointment at her bearing on departure,
was glad; his first wish was to regain composure,
the second to forget that it had been disturbed.
He left the summer-house, whose atmosphere
was stifling, and went to the lawn, where he
stayed till he saw the evening star burn in the
radiant twilight, and sink behind the elms into the
crystal sea, and a wan crescent moon appear in the
emerald-tinted sky. Roxalana was waiting at the
tea-table when he went in. Chloe had told her of
his meeting with Virginia, and she discreetly managed
to be alone.</p>

<p>"Take your tea, Argus."</p>

<p>"Certainly, give me tea. This cup is cracked."</p>

<p>"They are all cracked; we have nothing
whole."</p>

<p>"The devil! And do you like it so?"</p>

<p>"I am sure it suits us."</p>

<p>"The whole concern is a ruin!"</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"How could anybody ever be possessed with an
idea which separates me, as part and parcel, from
this decay."</p>

<p>"It is remarkably strange, I confess,&mdash;such an
idea."</p>

<p>"Did you, Roxalana, accuse me of being a dolt,
an idiot, in your thoughts, when you knew that
Virginia Brande was flitting about me this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Virginia Brande is a saint."</p>

<p>"That was the news my veins conveyed to me;
but I'll have nothing to do with saints. I do not
love them."</p>

<p>"Argus, I desire you not to speak so."</p>

<p>"I never will again. I am sorry, Roxalana, that
this cup is not perfect, because I am going to break
it. Don't go yet."</p>

<p>She snuffed the candles, took one, and held it up to
his face, surveying him with an impenetrable stare.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, putting it down, "that you
are the most detestable man I ever met."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten George?"</p>

<p>"He, at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not anxious to hear of the 'at least.' I
said I loved neither saints nor women; but I love
and respect life. After having made a pretty job
of it mending sundry fissures, do you think I am
going to allow anybody to drop the frail article in
pieces before me? Don't you go out of your
natural straightforwardness to think otherwise.
Mix me a glass of brandy and water: keep out those
lumps of sugar; I shall be as drunk without."</p>

<p>She sat beside him while he sipped from his
glass.</p>

<p>"Had I better send for Mat?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Send?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by Chloe."</p>

<p>"Oh, Chloe is here, is she? Virginia's Chloe!
No, I will not have her disturbed. Go you to bed,
and I'll send the bottle after you. Look you,
Roxalana, this is my last glass; I shall never
empty another bottle. The occasion has come and
gone forever,&mdash;as it came and went with Sebastian.
The rulers shall share no cups from the brim of
their will with me. The rack was stupid in comparison
with the fine assaults made on a man, which
bare his system. Have you seen a rope-dancer
walk from the roof of a theatre to the footlights,
on a single cord, when the audience had but one
breath? Or do I mean that crowd of shining
angels climbing up and down Jacob's ladder, every
round a nerve? Hold on, Jacob, or wake up."</p>

<p>"I always felt," replied Roxalana, perfectly unmoved
by his remarks, "that the time would come
when you would cease to ask me for brandy."</p>

<p>"Now you may go. I like you, but have seen
enough for the present of the woman for whom&mdash;"</p>

<p>At sunrise the next morning he was under the
elms tranquilly smoking. Its golden light was shut
out of Virginia's chamber. She lay in her bed with
breath rising and falling in the mute, gray air,
sleeping as one sleeps after suffering pain,&mdash;in
deathly oblivion; strands of her splendid hair half
wrapped her white throat. Her hands, nervously
alive, were twisted above her head, and the outlines
of her tall figure, from her compressed lips to
her crossed feet, betrayed the anguish which slumber
is merciful to. The sprig of box lay on her
Bible near her bed, her hat was on the floor; but
the dress which she had worn was carefully folded
to be put away. No one ever saw her wear again
the becoming dress, with its velvet rosettes, which
Tempe had been so envious of.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE natal day was of so little importance to
Argus, that it would have passed unobserved,
had not Roxalana's tenacious memory proclaimed
the fact he was now forty-two. The autumn, as in
other years, bestowed its tranquil, penetrating influence
upon him; its spirit, dwelling in purple and
silver vapor, the golden shafts of sunrise and sunset,
the scented, moderate wind, and the subtle,
transforming leaf, imparted the old sense of material
perfection. But the feathered arrows of change
hurtled in his atmosphere, and the passions which
invest life, as closely as lichen spreads over the incapable
rock and impassive tree trunk, began to
assert their existence in his. Between all the relations
which surrounded him,&mdash;from the absent
Sebastian to baby George; Roxalana, whose affections
were mastered by the child, and from
whom vivid rays of happiness passed to her heart;
Tempe, whose manifestations were new; Virginia,
banished, and again overwhelmed by fresh demands
at home; and Mat Sutcliffe, who had retired from
the captain, in his devotion, apparently, and fallen
into a strange idolatry for "G. Gates," as he had
called the baby from the beginning;&mdash;it was certain
that Argus was for the present left solitary.
His dominion was shaken, and the habits which
his inflexible taste had ordained for the household
were breaking under a hand, whose pressure he
could not control. If in these changes different
moods possessed his habitual silence; if, a
vague chaos threatening his horizon, those deep,
wingless desires which sometimes lodge themselves
in the depths of one who is deserted at the flood
tide of his abilities, came,&mdash;and expressed their
presence in his face or mien; if restless, or quiet,
if he ate, slept less; whatever he did, it was unnoticed.
Obviously he was the same man; sensitive
to insensible objects; indifferent to vital ones;
cheerful, composed, hard, disdainful, and regardful
as a miser of the outgoing of every cent from
his pocket,&mdash;a strange fact, since he never cared to
save, or earn, a dollar. The child he rarely spoke
of; when Roxalana approached him with it, and
made an attempt to attract his notice, he snapped
his fingers at it, with, "Here, you sir, stew boy."
He made no remark to Mat about it, not even
when, with a clumsy tenderness touching to behold.
Mat was taking his "G. Gates" round the garden,
and allowing him to put out his eyesight, and pull
his whiskers up by the roots. Argus was pleased,
however, to worry Mary, who was jealous of Mat's
devotion; she was warned concerning the birth-right
of her own boys, and was so moved thereat,
that she tormented Mat till he flew into a rage,
which induced him to pack his oldest boys off to
sea, and apprentice his oldest girl to a tailor.</p>

<p>"Put that in your pipe and smoke it," he said to
her; "my next move will be wuss. I'll set you to
picking oakum. Where's your pride, and where's
your memory, and where's your calculation? The
time comes to such folks as the Gates's, when they
all tumble into some gaping hole, and nothing ever
rises up but a little cloud of dust dry as yellow
stuff. Who can take G. Gates by the hand then?
Who will be left to do it, but <i>me?</i> An old, drunken,
ignorant vagabones can do it; and blarst me
if ever he grows up old, ignorant, and a drunkard."</p>

<p>"Them Drakes can do it; and it is their right to
do it; and they ought to do it; and you've no
business to poke your nose into what isn't your
own concern; and my gal's pricking her fingers in
Philip Dyer's stinking shop,&mdash;all because of your
tantrums, Mat Sutcliffe."</p>

<p>"The Drakes! Never while Roxalana Gates
and I are above ground will they get that boy. So
shut up, and clear up. Ain't it a dull time of year,
I'd like to know? I have got too much time on
my hands, just as you've got too much tongue."</p>

<p>"I'll let people know how things stand, see if I
don't," said Mary finally. But Mat knew she
would venture no further than rating him to the
best of her ability. Meantime the child grew
bright and winning. Mat went to Temple House
every day before he went to his work in the morning,
or on returning from it at night, and sat in
conclave with Roxalana, exchanging notes of admiration,
and predictions concerning him. When
the teething period arrived, the times he was passed
from one to the other, and experiments made upon
his gums, could not be counted.</p>

<p>"Let's see if he'll eat," was Mat's prevailing request.
And "Do you think he gains in weight?"
was Roxalana's incessant question.</p>

<p>For the most of the time Tempe hovered in their
neighborhood silent, and with haggard looks; her
eyes were larger, and more shining. She was
tame now, but still unloving; if her child cried, she
moved farther from it; if it laughed, she turned her
head away. No one ever saw her kiss it.</p>

<p>"Argus," said Roxalana, one day, "I believe that
Temple absolutely hates that child."</p>

<p>"Damnation!&mdash;what did you expect of her?&mdash;that
she would sit in a blue mantle, like the Virgin
Mary, and smilingly offer it to an adoring
world."</p>

<p>For a moment the obdurate heartlessness of
Tempe, and the heartless coarseness of Argus, gave
her the thought that she was not quite a happy
woman; but it only brought the dark flush to her
cheek, and faded with it. Argus observed it.</p>

<p>"Pooh,&mdash;Roxalana, I am too old a fellow to make
a woman blush. Didn't you tell me the other day
that I was forty-two?"</p>

<p>"If you can tell me what age has to do with the
regular beating of the heart, perhaps I can explain
why the blood shows in my face against my will."</p>

<p>"Against your will! The perpetual faculty of
a flush is given your sex; it is your rose of expectancy.
There is something cunning in you all. Is
your mind ever off the idea of assault, insult, result?
I notice the red flag unfurls at the slightest
contrary breath from a man's mouth."</p>

<p>Roxalana laughed, and pressed her plump hands
together, as if they were a pincushion from which
she was trying to extract concealed pins.</p>

<p>"I am not to be driven away just now, Argus, by
any language; Georgey is asleep, and I am entirely
at leisure. I don't object to be badgered, as you
know."</p>

<p>"Chloe will answer better for badgering; she
stands it well."</p>

<p>Roxalana laughed again, and said that she thought
Chloe was invaluable; she blessed the chance which
sent her to them.</p>

<p>"So you do. The madness of Brande's wife, and
the loss of Virginia's nurse from babyhood, were
your gain."</p>

<p>"Having made up my mind that it is impossible
for me to see God's justice in this world, I have also
made up my mind not to be affected by that which
I have no power over."</p>

<p>"God's justice," he repeated reflectively: "how
could you make up a mind about that? I have the
fancy that you do not believe in a Divine Being."</p>

<p>"I choose to have no belief. One way or the
other, belief is a frightful thing; it assassinates
everything except itself. If I <i>know</i>, or <i>feel</i>, I am
content; when these facts become impossible with
<i>me</i>, of what use can belief be?"</p>

<p>"You are curious&mdash;for a woman. What do you
think about death&mdash;that Jack-in-a-box? A grim,
fantastic toy, of which we must spring its lid."</p>

<p>"I abhor death and the dead,&mdash;cruel, treacherous
falsifiers to all we pretend to be. How dare
you name a subject so terrible? I never dwell
upon it."</p>

<p>"It is a very indifferent subject to me, Roxalana;
when I die, my love for life will be gone, of course.
Underground will suit my six feet prone, as well as
the air suits my upright six feet now. Where is
your snuff-box? I think I will adopt your habit."</p>

<p>Roxalana gravely offered him her tortoise shell
box, remarking as she did so that snuff was her only
vice, and wondering whether all people of a certain
age did not drop into some comfortable weakness.
So the conversation started by her remark concerning
Tempe ended, and was not renewed. The
inspiration of words comes oddly and unexpectedly,
especially with those who do not study their feelings.
It has little to do with chance, and the environment
of circumstance is nothing to it. Words so spoken
may reveal, decide, and make important that which
has hitherto been unknown; sentiment may be
originated and relations established by the speakers
who remain ignorant till utterance has passed their
lips. Little George asleep, the accidental appearance
of Roxalana in the spot where Argus happened
to be, the few words that passed between them,
brought about the opinion with Argus that no
temptation could ever separate him from Roxalana,
and fixed one with her that life without Argus
would be worse to endure than the pangs of hated
death; and that she would rather be the first to
die and be supported by his strength and courage,
which she thought equal to face all mortal terrors.</p>

<p>These ideas, extending the bond between them to
the confines of existence, had in no wise any outward
effect; they were put away for future use, and
were not even to be mentally referred to, without
occasion. Could Chloe's acuteness have discerned
all this, she might not have felt the necessity of
approaching Argus as a missionary. She perceived
that Roxalana's attention was drawn from him, and
that Mat only had eyes for "G. Gates," and argued
that though he was no Christian, and would be
eternally damned, he ought to be considered an
authority in his family, because he provided for it,
and because there was something about him that
made the natural supply of well-ironed shirts and
carefully cooked food imperative. Who could do
this but herself? She gradually assumed the power
of ministering to his wants, and they grew accustomed
to each other in a characteristic way that
would have astonished Virginia, but which was
scarcely observed by Roxalana and Tempe. Her
first advance was made and accepted upon the
slight occasion of Mat Sutcliffe's putting his head in
one day at the green room door, while she happened
to be there putting some dishes away in the glass
cabinet beside the chimney. Argus was there, also,
drumming on the table she had cleared a slow march
with his fingers. Mat stared round the room without
speaking.</p>

<p>"'Tain't here," she said sharply; "it's a-waiting
upstairs with its grandma, to be cuddled and palavered
with. I hope you don't smell of tar more
than usual,&mdash;it lasts so long arter you are gone!
'Tis most as good as having your company the
whole time. I'm feared if folks come in, they'll
'spect the whole family have got the itch."</p>

<p>Mat withdrew his head, and slammed the door
so hard that Argus stopped drumming, and said:</p>

<p>"What are you so savage with Mat for, you
hussey? Don't he like your color?"</p>

<p>"As the times is as they is, and I conclude they
be, I don't expect to insist your treating me in a
sarseful manner, sir. Any time that suits you will
suit me, I think I can stand it. A man who dangles
his legs easy over the steep where the swine
rushed can be no trouble to me, as long as I do
my duty, and keep him clean and comfortable. I
wash my hands of everything else. Can't say,
though, but that I like being here; can't help myself,
it's the Indian in me that loves the God-forsaken
independence in this house."</p>

<p>"If you do wash your hands, I submit to having
your fingers in my pie, though they do resemble
adders. How is it that Brande's wife never felt
your fangs? You are a fine woman, Chloe, and
belong to a past generation of females possessing
hips. How is your ankle? I don't know that I
object to the turning of the world which brings me
Africa, and the lost tribes."</p>

<p>"<i>Sarse</i>" said Chloe, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You must have been the salt, up there at the
Forge. How did you lose your flavor?"</p>

<p>"Missey had to part with me, she sent me,&mdash;no,
<i>he</i> sent me from one fool to&mdash;Mrs. Gates."</p>

<p>"I was sorry." And then Argus appeared to
forget Chloe's presence; he turned his hand over
and over, scanning it as if it were an object foreign
to himself. She watched him, and wondered if
ever so impudent, self-contained a man ever lost
his balance.</p>

<p>"You are fond of ashes, are you?" she asked
sharply. "You are always on the hearth, either
here or in the kitchen; or do you think you will
scare me from burning out the wood? I thought
every gentleman in Kent owned woodland, and
that they never begrudged waste. What may be
the worth of a few sticks of oak, hickory, or yellow
pine?"</p>

<p>"That was an excellent dish you served us with
at dinner," he said, rising, looking into the cabinet,
and changing the position of the china she
had placed there; "it reminded me of one I tasted
years ago,&mdash;flavored with the Barbadoes cherry.
It was before she was born."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brande is about your age, Captain
Gates."</p>

<p>"Confound you, what are you talking about? I
own nothing. What is the ownership of a shell,&mdash;named
when men and women built it together, and
made themselves its kernel&mdash;Temple House? The
ties of property,&mdash;mutual interests,&mdash;those relations
which slip into each other like the scales in a coat
of mail, and which compose the armor worn to
keep us erect before God, and crooked with the
devil,&mdash;are not for me."</p>

<p>Chloe began to twirl her thumbs, and look vacant,
as she did at conference meeting when the
speaker was dull, though she was mindful that his
language was at variance with his quiet utterance.</p>

<p>"Mind you, though," he continued, "every
stick you burn, every loaf you bake for me, I can
be as cold and as hungry as any of my neighbor-atoms,
and I love food and warmth, as well as the
rapt disciples did."</p>

<p>"It was no new dish I made," she answered. "I
never did see such folks in all my days; don't
know what's what. Miss Tempe shook her head
at it, and said she hated hash; and why did I put
myself out to make our poverty unendurable, says
she?"</p>

<p>Argus made a motion to her to attend to the
business she was engaged in, and not to disturb
him. She obeyed, quite contented with the feeling
she had that number two was gained over, and
that she could devote herself to Argus as she had
devoted herself to Virginia, without the hope of
any reward, and, in his case, without the hope of
appreciation.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE anniversary of Tempe's marriage, with its
vision of a snow-storm and a bridal veil, and
that of her widowhood passed. The Drakes, conventionally
mindful of both occasions, but disliking
Tempe's immobility, and indifferent towards
Argus and Roxalana, sent black-edged cards to the
family, and presents to Georgey, instead of paying
visits. The events were apparently forgotten by
Tempe, who was no more silent than usual, no
paler, and betrayed no emotion. No remembrance
or hope drew her towards the boy,&mdash;sole tie between
herself and the dead,&mdash;to move her to say,
"Sweet, my child, I live for thee." That enduring,
sacred passion, the love no desire can buy,
which a mother alone knows; that buds, blossoms,
and bears at once like an orange grove; is felt with
the kisses which drop like rose-leaves in hands that
bend and cling like tendrils; in imperious feet
that choose to trample upon her; in the sobs like
smiles, and laughter full of tears; in the rapid
beating of the child-heart which acknowledges one
necessity&mdash;existence with hers; this Tempe never
felt. Happily, perhaps; for would not the time
arrive when the single aim of her son's existence
might be a woman who had not attained the state
of motherhood? When all the episodes connected
with maternal life might fall as void in his memory
as a morning mist falls void in the rays of the sun?
When the years of maternal sacrifice, the immolations
of all other relations, the decay of all individuality
not bearing on the maternal interest,&mdash;might
be remembered as a dream, dead and done
with the actualities of the present?</p>

<p>Without dwelling on the speculations of reason,
or analyzing the instincts, Roxalana celebrated
these anniversaries; unconsciously she blended the
wedding and the funeral, and regarded them as one.
The aspect of the latter day she studied as an outlet
for certain questions which dimly rose in her
mind, and distracted for the moment her attention
from Georgey. Never leaving the house on any
pretext, the relief which one finds in the open air
did not occur to her; a look from the windows,
and going from room to room, were the limits
of any unwonted restlessness. A pale sun glimmered
over the lawn like a hollow shell; black,
bitter dust whirled round the house, and struck the
panes; the gray air and the gray ground held the
roar of heavy wheels and hoofs, the melancholy,
reluctant creak of the boughs, and the wail of
crowded, wandering winds. The atmosphere within
was dismal and vacant; human interest seemed
to have departed; the incapable hands and feet
of those whose efforts so long ago consecrated the
now unused apartments were waiting for the resurrection
to make them plain again. They could
not now care for the trifles which lent inspiration
to the beings endowed with the obligations of being.
The events of thought and feeling occupy little
time and space; they may be so invisible in the
ordinary drama of the day, that the decree which
decides the future is made, and the bystanders only
observe that a man is twisting his mustache, or a
woman adjusting her ribbons. These mental experiences,
while happening, do not appear remarkable
till afterwards, when they take the possessions
of facts in the mind, and the power which belongs to
acts is attached to them. Roxalana's spirit contracted
a shadow at that time, which hid itself till ready
to spring out in full and terrible growth. Wrapped
in a dark shawl, moving through the dismantled
rooms, on that side of the house no one ever had
occasion to enter, slowly and heavily, she looked
like one of those quiet, expectant, colossal statues,
whose knees are buried in the drifting sand, whose
faces are forever darkening in the desert air.
When Georgey, a few months afterwards, was carried
to one of these rooms dead,&mdash;she remembered
herself,&mdash;moving slowly, heavily, and understood
her sadness. Long before sunset, it grew so dark
in the green room and the kitchen that she thought
a gale must be rising, and climbed to the attic to
get a view of its progress over the bay. At the
sight, she recalled Sebastian, and her heart lifted like
a wave at the thought of his escape from the sea.
The shores bristled with layers of frozen brine,
with jagged edges; dull, soiled sheets of ice gaped
over the tide line. The bay bore no sail; no winter
fowl skimmed its surface; the dark waves rolled
and burst without glassy bubbles or white foam;
the coldly blue mass traveled its bounds, within
headland, cape, and bar, and returned upon itself,
baffled by the power of frost. Though she shivered
at the dreary prospect, its wide extent and
immensity of motion stirred her sluggish mind.</p>

<p>"Sebastian should have returned before now,"
she said. "He must not tempt the winter sea a
second time. And yet I wish he would come."</p>

<p>"Missis Gates," called Chloe on the passage,
"I'se looking for you, cause I can't find anything
else."</p>

<p>"I came up to look at the weather."</p>

<p>"Marcy on me, missis, there's plenty weather below."
And Chloe entered the room. "Is it likely
that I may find a cullender here?"</p>

<p>"Do you believe in Ghosts, Chloe?"</p>

<p>"Why, missis?"</p>

<p>"Those blasts, all over the room, that do not
come from anywhere, appear to me to be the breath
of ghosts."</p>

<p>"I think they come from holes in the roof.
What may be in this closet?"</p>

<p>"I never noticed there was a closet till now."</p>

<p>Chloe opened the door and examined the shelves.</p>

<p>"There's something queer," she said presently.</p>

<p>"Anything useful?" asked Roxalana, the tide
of sombre feelings turning into that of curious
ones.</p>

<p>"I wish it was a cullender,&mdash;and it ain't," Chloe
answered, handing something to Roxalana.</p>

<p>"It is a yak's tail," said Roxalana. "My father
had one; a friend brought it to him from India.
It is used there to brush flies away. This is set in
an ivory handle; I am glad to have it for Georgey."</p>

<p>"Who put it there, Missis Gates?"</p>

<p>"The former owners of this house probably.
What else is there?"</p>

<p>"Only the ghost's breath, that's all." And Chloe,
shutting the door advised a retreat from the cold.</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Argus, when he saw the yak's
tail. "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Have you not been oppressed to-day, Argus?
There seemed to me a storm brewing, and I went
upstairs to look down the bay, and while I was
there Chloe came up and discovered this in the
closet."</p>

<p>"Chloe had better keep out of my closet."</p>

<p>Chloe, being present, threw up her head contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Light the candles, Chloe," said Roxalana. "It
is a relief to have the day over. I do not observe
landmarks generally, but I could not help recalling
past circumstances connected with Tempe."</p>

<p>"Did you recall them? There's no prospect of
a storm. You have felt lazy to-day. Why not hibernate
entirely, since you are squeamish about
weather and it happens to be the storm season? I
should not be surprised if hell was bad weather
merely. Should you wish to slumber through the
winter, I judge it is safe to entrust Chloe with the
lictorship. Get your axe, Chloe."</p>

<p>Chloe looked offended, and said that she was no
cat; and believed herself as neat as the next person.</p>

<p>"If you still insist on remaining awake, Roxalana,"
he continued, "you will be obliged to endure
the fact that at last the future will be but the
past. The present sifts the future through the
mind, grain by grain, fine as dust; crag and bank,
coast and continent, crumble and slide into a shoal
abyss, which is yet wide enough to dissolve them.
Chloe, when were you at the Forge?"</p>

<p>He was remembering the wedding night, and
thought of Virginia beside Roxalana in a robe of
tulle; her beaming, gracious eyes spanned the
distance between them like a bridge, her brilliant
black hair shone so in the light of the candelabra
under which she sat that his eyes were dazzled.
He would have turned away had he not discovered
that he was waiting Chloe's reply, and cursed himself
for asking a question which did not concern
him.</p>

<p>"A few days ago, sir, I was at the Forge. They
are hammering tremenjus nowadays; the fires
are so hot that the snow has melted in a ring
round the buildings, and the ground is as black as
your hat. Missey is losing herself like, and growing
worldly; Martha says she has to do up Mr.
Brande's white vests oftener than ever. There's a
young man in the house&mdash;Martha thinks he is a
fixture. He plays cards, and missey sits by glum
and attentive. He smokes, and drinks wine for
his dinner; and says she to me&mdash;Sarah, the girl
that waits&mdash;says that Mr. Brande sets down the
light decanter and the dark decanter as easy as if
they were vegetables. Missey, I know, winks hard
at these things. Haven't I seen her shut her eyes
before now?"</p>

<p>"Brande plays a good game. It is the right
news to hear, Roxalana&mdash;that young man is his
partner. It is proper that Virginia should be
worldly."</p>

<p>"It is bad news, Argus."</p>

<p>"You are as wise as a bell-wether. Does Tempe
mope more than usual? I scarcely see her, and
do not know whether she broods over something
gone&mdash;her plaything, or whether she is simply impish
according to her constitution. Little women
are mostly diabolic; I am grateful to you, Roxalana,
for being somewhat overgrown."</p>

<p>"I am the better for that, so far as the labor
which I perform goes. You owe me nothing."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken; to your life and character
I owe an ease which mother, sister, wife, could not
give me. How shall I reward you&mdash;by fervently
remembering that you are a respectable granite
boulder?"</p>

<p>"Maintain any doctrine, Argus, you like; I am
entirely accustomed to you. With Tempe you
must exercise patience."</p>

<p>"I'll continue to exercise indifference; patience
implies the hope, or expectation, of a change of
opinion. I shall have but one opinion. A glittering
scale occupies the place in her breast where,
by the courtesy your sex demands, we locate the
heart. Let the girl alone; neither to you nor me
is she accountable."</p>

<p>"Mother, he is crying in his bed," said Tempe,
coming in, and languidly walking to the window.</p>

<p>"He is crying!" echoed Roxalana: "I presume
you have listened to him for some time."</p>

<p>There was no accent of reproach in her voice.
Tempe shook her head.</p>

<p>"I had rather," continued Roxalana, with her
hand on the door-latch, "hear the most hateful
sound you can conceive of, than hear the least
whimper from that child. There should be a rigorous
law passed that children should never be suffered
to shed a tear."</p>

<p>She closed the door, and Tempe looked down
the lawn as silent as before. Argus watched her
with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>"The Drake child is nearly six months old, isn't
he?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>She flashed round upon him, and twisted her
mouth for a reply.</p>

<p>"Hasn't the lawful time arrived for you to slip
out of this black state? Put yourself and the baby
into short clothes, and let us see if you can not
attain a better air."</p>

<p>"Give me some money, then." And she held
out her little hand, with an exquisitely impertinent
expression.</p>

<p>"I haven't a dollar; Sebastian took every cent.
I borrowed some for him, besides; he is spending
it somewhere, I suppose, in a manner refreshing to
himself."</p>

<p>Her face turned to flame.</p>

<p>"Chameleon," chuckled Argus, "what's the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"I think Sebastian is a man," she cried, "who
has everything; he can match and beat you at
points. He has always taken to himself whatever
is sweet and good, I know he has; he is
a bad man, and I would like to see him killed.
And if he is a Spaniard, why hasn't the Inquisition
crushed him before now, the cool, abundant,
gorged creature? And I should think, Uncle
Argus, you would hate him, for he is not like you
at all; he just stands alone, and no man nor woman
can pull him down. He can browse on the clouds,
if he chooses; and be insolent on the top of the
walls of heaven, if it pleases him to walk out on the
ramparts."</p>

<p>"Had he walked in at my door like an ordinary
comer," said Argus gravely, "I might feel indifferent
to him; but I saved his life, at some strange
cost to myself. I have been strained ever since,
there's no denying it. Hoh, by God&mdash;I feel cordial
toward him!"</p>

<p>Argus jumped from his chair, and lunged backward
and forward, his eyes alight, like coals
touched by a sudden draught.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say so?" said Tempe; "I call you
demented to praise him."</p>

<p>"I don't praise him."</p>

<p>"I call it praise."</p>

<p>"Away with you, puss; better not quite forget
that it is possible for you to make life somewhat
agreeable to yourself."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

</div>

<p>VIRGINIA, so it appeared, forgot that she was
playing with the new partner, Mr. Carfield,
the innocent and ancient game of backgammon.
She held the dice box suspended over the board,
and did not shake it. Mr. Carfield's eyes were indifferently
fixed on the blazing rings which adorned
her motionless hands. He was a brave, savage-looking
man, and any energetic reminder from him
that the game was at a standstill would not have
surprised the spectator, had there been one; but
they were alone. The folding doors of the best
parlors were apart; the chandeliers were lighted,
the chairs stood in groups, the open piano was littered
with sheets of music, and gilded books of engravings
lay open on the tables, but the guests
were gone. Mr. Brande, formerly ubiquitous in
his house, so long as there was anything to be
transacted, or anybody moving, had surreptitiously
gone to bed, and there was no person up except
themselves, and Sarah, the waiter, who sat yawning
in the dining-room, impatiently waiting to hear Mr.
Carfield's boots going upstairs, on their way to be
placed outside his bedroom door when stripped
from his impudent legs. Late as it was, she was
destined to remain in her place some little time
yet, which gave her the opportunity, and she improved
it, of inventing new opprobrious names for
him. The house was pleasant still with light and
warmth, and filled with that silence so attractive at
night, when all the paraphernalia of living is perfectly
adjusted without the accessory of life. The
fires were burning, the lamplight was steady, the
walls, doors, and furniture shone darkly, and the
colors, glaring red and blue by day, were now soft
and sombre. With every hour of quiet, the plants
in Virginia's conservatory leading from the upper
hall lived in deeper dalliance, and sent their perfume
through the air in shocks of delicious sweetness.
A rain-storm had suddenly begun, and
though the shutters were closed it trickled through
the slats, and modestly streamed down the panes,
as befitted its entrance into Mr. Brande's house;
a murmur came from the roof, also, and the well-built
doors were obliged to thud in their frames occasionally.
It might have been that Virginia was
listening to these faint sounds, which prevented her
from throwing the dice. Abruptly and passionately
she burst out with:</p>

<p>"What day of the month is this?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield, not to be surprised, bowed slightly
and answered:</p>

<p>"The twenty-first of March."</p>

<p>"So I have just thought, and the time is nearly
past! Oh, my blind, stupid, animal memory, that
needs the blow of the wind and rain to wake it."</p>

<p>She pushed away the table that stood between
them; the frown, now habitual with her, concentrated
into dark lines, and altered her sweet face
to that of a woman's acquainted with trouble.
Dropping her face in her hands, she appeared to
have forgotten Mr. Carfield, as well as the game.
He threw himself back in the chair, his short,
amber-colored hair showing well against the red
velvet cover, and his wide head looking still wider
in its relief; his lids narrowed as he contemplated
her, till his eyes were mere lines, but the lines expressed
a meaning seldom allowed there.</p>

<p>"Association? Reminiscence?" he asked.</p>

<p>She rose as if she saw a vision, pointed her finger
at him, and replied:</p>

<p>"Terrible ones."</p>

<p>"How tall you are!" he involuntarily exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Argus saved Sebastian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are <i>two</i> then?" he inquired, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Two strong, beautiful men."</p>

<p>"And I," said Mr. Carfield, leaving his chair to
stand beside her, "am I not strong and beautiful?"
He caught her hand, and interlaced his finger with
her. "Have I not waited long enough, Virginia?"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For you. Say <i>now</i> that you will be my wife."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>&mdash;who stand here as your hostess? well,
perhaps something nearer,&mdash;your friend, since she
allows you to bruise her fingers. Release my
hand."</p>

<p>He stepped backwards, and faced her; their eyes
were exactly level, whether the lids were up or
down, pupil matched pupil.</p>

<p>"It may be absurd, but do you know that I expect
to marry you? When your father came to see
my father, his old friend, worth&mdash;let me see how
much,&mdash;say three hundred thousand dollars,&mdash;I
heard him describe his daughter and his Forge, one
as handsome, talented, free, the other as an ugly
fixture, restricted, encumbered. I believed him; so
did my father, a clever sharp old man. He said, 'Go
to Kent.' I came, and am not sorry for coming.
There is a hundred thousand dollars of my money
here; every day of my stay has cost me hundreds.
I gamble with the Forge for your speech, your gestures,
your attentions, your presence,&mdash;for <i>you</i>. I
love you. Do know what that means? Do you
understand men, my princess? We are procreators,
providers, protectors, but we are lustful, acute,
selfish for you women; the best, wisest, most tender
hero is also what I say. What would be the form
of society if we were not so? When our functions
cease, let us be children again, and gentle, fulfilling
the charities, and bridge our way to heaven. Be
my wife, give me children; divide with me the
goods of this world; change the look which is in
your eyes sometimes,&mdash;an expectation of the thin,
airy goods of the next world, and meet mine in
that hope which allures weak men to madness and
death, and incites strong men to pluck the jewels
from the crown of life, and wear them as kings."</p>

<p>"You are quite right and just," replied Virginia,
"in your views; so much so that I almost wonder
that my heart does not leap forward, and fall upon
you in gratitude and humility, and accept you.
Yet it does not. I refuse to take my lot with you;
my ambition does not lie in the direction of the
king's lair."</p>

<p>She spoke with coolness, but her heart throbbed,
and a faintness swept across her; she did not dare
venture crossing the room, and resumed her seat.
It was Mr. Brande, asleep in his bed, that caused
her faintness, not the young man near her, who also
resumed his seat. The portrait of her father, and
his intention regarding her, which she contemplated
in the light of this interview, was not flattering; it
terrified her. A regiment of Carfields, enclosing
her in a hollow square, could not strike her a coward;
but that placidly slumbering man upstairs
made her wild with apprehension. Her respect and
submission prevented her from blaming him; it
was reasonable and natural for him to suppose and
expect such a marriage possible and probable.
Why not? She raised her eyes to Mr. Carfield, and
he understood instantly that she stood at bay.
To her, in spite of his sincere vehemence, in
spite of his beauty, sense, and fitness, he was
merely the representative of money. Had Temple
Drake been present, with the same aggravation,
and wearing a stiletto, he would have been stabbed,
rolled into a corner, and defiantly stood over, till
some one should come to threaten her with a
punishment that would only make her laugh. But
Virginia, pious and timid in character, although
like her father indomitable in her passions, was
not moved to desperation; her thoughts weakly
wandered hither and thither. How she despised
the signs of wealth about her,&mdash;and none of it
hers! If she could but invent some plan that would
make everything smooth and pleasant, and avoid
the sacrifice her father expected! She tried to
recollect where her purse was, and whether there
were fifteen or twenty dollars in it, and how she
had spent the last sum received from him, when
she was arrested by a sudden knocking, like that
at the gate in Macbeth, on the hall door. Mr.
Carfield looked at his watch, and remarked that it
was nearly midnight. Sarah opened the parlor
door, and, to his surprise, ushered in a man who
wore an old camlet cloak, and a sealskin cap, the
better for the weather, for the rain made it sleek
and shiny.</p>

<p>"Argus!" cried Virginia, strength coming in
the tumult which the sight of him gave her.</p>

<p>"And where is <i>Sebastian?</i>" asked Mr. Carfield,
in a voice intended for her only, but the quick ear
of Argus caught the name. "Sebastian," he said,
bowing, "arrived several hours since. His arrival
is the occasion of my being here. Where is Brande,
Virginia? I wish to see him."</p>

<p>"Who is this sprightly Diogenes, so desirous of
throwing his lantern upon your father?" whispered
Mr. Carfield, rising and passing Virginia to address
Argus. "Sir," he said, "Mr. Brande has
been in bed an hour or more. The rain, though
it falls on the just and the unjust, can only reach
him through you; possibly you had better not take
up your dampness at present. Any message you
may choose to leave I will faithfully deliver in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carfield, you do not understand," said
Virginia. "Argus, give me your cloak. You
know where to find father."</p>

<p>"The qualities of my cloak are not understood,"
said Argus; "it resembles the phenomenon naturalists
love to mention&mdash;a duck's back; my cap is
more friendly to the elements." And he shook
the water from it.</p>

<p>"Your dress, Miss Brande, is in danger," said
Mr. Carfield.</p>

<p>She made a dash and rustle with her crimson
silk, which signified no distaste of the
danger.</p>

<p>"There was more water where you were a year
ago to-night, Argus," she said.</p>

<p>"Exactly, and much colder," he replied. "Come,
show me how to go. How should I know where
your father piously slumbers?"</p>

<p>She rose instantly, and led the way. On the
stairs, Argus asked if that was the new partner he
had just met. It was, she answered.</p>

<p>"He is a jackanapes."</p>

<p>Virginia touched his arm, and motioned him
into the conservatory.</p>

<p>"Oh, Argus," she cried, "I am expected to
marry him."</p>

<p>The unhappy girl was inspired with the wild
belief that Argus had been sent to her by Providence.
How could so strange an event as his
appearance at that hour be otherwise accounted
for? She must give herself to him&mdash;now, <i>now?</i>
He should stand between her and her father; the
time had come&mdash;by the convulsion of her heart,
the powerful determination of her will&mdash;she knew
it! Argus grew very pale standing before her.
He raised his hand, and broke a sprig from a plant
that trailed from a hanging basket above them;
lightly drawing it across her lips he said, with a
strange smile:</p>

<p>"He is a fine fellow, I know,&mdash;after your father's
heart. What other arrangement could be made?
Its propriety is most evident. It is the best thing
you can do, my girl; you know it as well as I do.
My opinion of your sense is not a false one, I am
assured. If you do not agree with me now, it is
because I am such an old fellow, and you are still
capable of the youthful follies we shall both laugh
at ten years from now."</p>

<p>He turned aside, as if he would have the subject
ended.</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you here for?" she asked, wringing
her hands. He crushed and rolled the leaves in
his hand before he answered.</p>

<p>"To pay back money which I borrowed months
ago of your father. I was an idiot, of course, to
come up at this time of night; but I could not
think of sleep. You know I no longer drink brandy,
having broken my bottle. Roxalana engaged
Sebastian just now, and, thinking the air would be
good for me, and freedom from debt better, I left
for these parts. Sebastian knew me well enough
to give me the means for making the visit here at
once."</p>

<p>Voiceless, she indicated her father's door, and
he turned away, wishing himself on the way to the
White Flat, rather than traversing Brande house,
like the blockhead he was. Looking up at the hanging
basket, with a wild smile, Virginia seized its tendrils,
and tore it down: she never forgot the bitter
scent of the earthy roots and stalks as the plant
fell over her hands. Confused and uncertain, she
went slowly downstairs, where Mr. Carfield, with
his elbows on the baluster, was watching for
her.</p>

<p>"How primitive your ways are in this town!
He called you <i>Virginia</i>&mdash;that rusty person! What
is your opinion,&mdash;is he the style of man I can
knock down for not knowing his place? Or is he
hedged about with your Methodistical divinity?"</p>

<p>She brushed past him into the parlor, and walked
up and down before the open door, keeping her
eyes upon it. He followed her, and braced himself
against the wall.</p>

<p>"It may be worth your doing," she said presently
without removing her eyes; "though if you
should kill him, even, it would make no difference,
so far as his existence is concerned with mine."</p>

<p>"Ah, that being a fact, I'll watch with you, and
observe him more closely."</p>

<p>They looked at each other now. His eyes
were full of insolence and defiance, and she felt
nerved to desperation. She looked so beautiful
suddenly, as she returned his glance, so bright and
strong, that he swore inwardly he would have her
at all hazards; her hatred could not mar the pleasure
possession would give him. It was with a
start, almost, that they heard the voice of Argus
again.</p>

<p>"Apologize for me, Virginia," he said, "in case
your father complains of my disturbing him."</p>

<p>She nodded, and stepped toward him, with an air
of determination.</p>

<p>"And you," addressing Mr. Carfield, "I trust
you will rally from the annoyance my unseasonable
entrance gave you; it was unpleasant, no doubt."</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield shrugged his shoulders, and Argus
bowed politely, waved his hand to Virginia, and
disappeared. Mr. Carfield went half-way through
the hall, as if to assure himself that an obnoxious
object was really removed.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he thought, "for the face you
are taking with you,&mdash;too icy and unfeeling to
combat with; too knowing to insult with any hope
of advantage. I have seen your like."</p>

<p>With a bitter jest on his tongue, he returned to
find Virginia gone. She had taken the opportunity,
he concluded, to escape, and had, of course,
gone to her own room. He did not feel composed
enough to go to bed, and thrusting his hands in his
pockets, he began to pace the floor. At each end
of the rooms were tall mirrors which reflected his
figure as he passed back and forth; he stopped an
instant at every turn, and examined himself critically.
The Carfields were all alike, he commented;
they were all famous, as he knew and had heard,
for compassing their ends in business, and in
pleasure. He resembled them, and was master of
his brain and fibers; the men and women necessary
to his purposes should bend to him, as they
had bent before to his race! He was satisfied
with his aspect, and, perhaps weary of the monotony
of his view front and his view back, turned
down the lights,&mdash;except one on the mantel-piece,
poked the coal in the grate to a blaze, and
stretched himself on the rug before it.</p>

<p>Virginia, leaving the parlor by a door which led
into the dining-room, passed the sleeping Sarah,
who dreamed a crimson cloud flashed by her, and
rushed from the house, coming upon Argus as he
was opening the front gate. It slipped from his
hand and closed again when he saw her flying
figure.</p>

<p>"Take me, Argus," she gasped, her white arms
gleaming before his eyes; "take me from my
dreadful position, else I shall die. My soul <i>is</i>
dying, oh, so fast, Argus, perishing, perishing, cold,
starved."</p>

<p>The shock of the rain on her bare head and
shoulders which were only covered with lace, her
rapid movement, or something besides, caused her
to drop on the ground senseless, and the gate was
between them. He tried to open it, but the iron
latch had sprung in the catch, and it would not
yield; his impassive heart began to beat with terror,
and his strength was shaken. He was as
defenceless and as much at the mercy of Virginia
in a dead faint as an old tree is in a tempest when
the lightning is sure to strike it. Had he followed
the guide of his self-possessed moments he would
have alarmed some one at the house, and then
pursued his way home. But the moment was not
self-possessed; one had come to be ruled by the
mysterious sentiment which men deny, deride, and
obey; Argus, in spite of his self-training, was
about to appear an honorable, loyal man, worthy
a woman's possession. He stood motionless an
instant.</p>

<p>"Are the Furies at me?" he said; "they have
tracked me to the river, but why have they shut
the gate? My strength against theirs then, and
Brande's iron."</p>

<p>He wrenched off the fastenings of the gate,
which fell back with a clang which Mr. Carfield
heard, and started to his feet to listen with a magnetic
perception of an approaching person or event;
then he rolled his cloak round Virginia, took her
in his arms, and carried her to the door, at which
he knocked with his foot, supposing from the light
he saw in the parlor still, that Mr. Carfield would
open it. With her dead oppressive weight in his
arms, there came a vision to his mind of his untrammeled
life at Temple House. Even its rains
and gales were full of repose!</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield opened the door; the sight of Virginia
muffled in the arms of Argus, enraged him.</p>

<p>"Stand back with your bundle," he said; "keep
her out there. Who wants her now?"</p>

<p>He held the door, but Argus thrust him away
and went past him.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me just now," said Argus. "Get
some water, you yellow hound, and make no noise.
Brande has said his evening prayers, and won't
bear disturbing; he might get wet, too."</p>

<p>He placed Virginia on a sofa, faint and trembling
with the exertion he had made. Mr. Carfield
trod closely behind, his hands in his pockets again,
and with the determination to afford no assistance,
and say nothing that was not insulting. But he
fell into a deeper rage, and could not contain
himself, when Argus confronted him, collected and
masterful.</p>

<p>"She loves you," said Mr. Carfield, "you!
God&mdash;<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"I deny it," answered Argus; "it is the contrary."
He dropped on his knees beside her, and
held her hands to his lips&mdash;"Virginia dear, hear
me; open your eyes, love," he whispered, utterly unmindful
of Carfield.</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir," he said again, in a strangled
voice, "she said as much not an hour since."</p>

<p>"Repeat that, and I will kill you," and Argus
rose, looked about him, and found a cologne water
bottle&mdash;"with this, it is big enough, unless you
prefer a neater way." Then pouring its contents
on his handkerchief, he bathed her face and hands.
The cloak fell from her, the lace over her bosom
was displaced, and its marble outlines were revealed.
Her face had fallen back, the beautiful
scarlet lips were slightly apart; no breath issued
from them, apparently. All the pity in the soul
of Argus was moved at so sweet, so helpless a
sight! But the lust which men may feel at the
sight of supine beauty burst into Mr. Carfield's
veins, and flashed from his eyes, tinging their blue
enamel with red sparks; his nostrils sharpened, an
indescribable sound came from his lips which drove
Argus mad. He let fall the handkerchief, and
sprang towards Mr. Carfield, who said loudly:
"I am inclined to think that, as her lover, you
would like to brag. Can you?"</p>

<p>A few seconds intervened, and Argus discovered
that he was turning the key of a door, Mr.
Carfield having been put outside of it&mdash;for the
present Argus was conqueror.</p>

<p>"I heard the river," said Virginia, suddenly sitting
up.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear," replied Argus. "You didn't;
it was the rain you heard."</p>

<p>"How I have troubled you. Forgive me; and I
shall not obtain your forgiveness," she said, hiding
her face in his cloak.</p>

<p>"My love, you are making my cloak too valuable
for an heirloom, even; you will compel me to
wear it perpetually." He kneeled beside her again,
and took her hand. "My God, Virginia, what a
beautiful woman you are! Where were you all
these years? Spare me. I must rest; do you
understand that I am exhausted?" He was bewildered&mdash;deadly
pale,&mdash;and his lips quivered with
each word. "I confess myself lost; if you have
found me, take care of me. Get me some wine,
my love, I can not stir. Sit by me awhile, and then
rouse some of your people, to drive me home. By
my soul, I never can walk."</p>

<p>Virginia, completely humbled, and now anxious
to annihilate herself, if he desired it, brought him
wine. She put the glass to his mouth, he trembled;
tears came into his iron eyes. She looked
at them with the feeling a child has when an unexpected,
longed-for treasure comes into its possession,
and timidly kissed his eyelids. He returned
the kiss&mdash;the first meeting of their lips put a strange
seal upon them; it was the boundary between the
undefinable genius of his character, and the direct
forces of her own. This was not the moment to
learn the fact; afterwards the understanding between
them was tacit, clear and full.</p>

<p>Argus kissed her again. Her face crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Carfield?" she asked hastily.</p>

<p>"There was Paradise, and the Devil, and the
flaming sword. I rather think the flaming sword
may be out on the door-mat," answered Argus,
making a significant motion towards the hall.</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"He went out. Let the dog wait; you will dine
with him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the next day," she answered bitterly.</p>

<p>"Hush! To-night is only to-night; let me
come nearer to you. So; some better man should
have the right to keep his lips here&mdash;not me, Argus,
the&mdash;no matter. And you always liked Temple
House?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Argus, and all of you. So Sebastian has
returned?"</p>

<p>"What o'clock can it be, my girl? Will that
gimcrack on the mantel yonder tell?"</p>

<p>"It runs to-night fast enough, for it points to
three. Don't go."</p>

<p>"I am not going. Unless I go, however, how
can I come again?"</p>

<p>"Will you come?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I'll not meet Brande, and know
that your heart palpitates between us. You will
find me at Temple House, as in years past, in the
green room, under the elms, out in the summer-house,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Not in the summer-house again."</p>

<p>"Yes; again, I say. It was fairer than this, on
a night I recall,&mdash;an orange-colored dusk, as I remember
it. The darkness was illuminated. I sent
you away in it, being dazed, and I see now that I
have never recovered from the surprise you gave
me. You were very sweet; did I tell you so?"</p>

<p>"Argus, there's cruelty in you."</p>

<p>"And you love it. Presently it may be impossible
for you to speak of hopes and desires. And
Hereafter yawns so devilishly we cannot say what
it may enclose; and as women will practice sutteeism,
I ask you to show me the pile you have ready.
Out with your speech, now."</p>

<p>He rose from his place beside her, and walked
up and down before the sofa, making sudden and
discomposing turns opposite it, and keeping his
eyes away from her.</p>

<p>"All that might have been said was acted,
Argus. I have thwarted my education at every
point, and kept out of sight the moral and social
principles instilled into my mind from childhood,
for the sake of preserving the only genuine, happy
emotion I ever felt. You have resisted my childish
inclination, ignored my girlish affection, crushed,
baffled, and repelled my womanly passion. Argus!
you are not great. You are a narrow, limited
man; you are not handsome. You have no youth&mdash;that
dream which lingers with us, the 'song that
is never sung,'&mdash;through bitter years, lasting beyond
the fretwork and frostwork of wrinkles and
gray hair,&mdash;perhaps you <i>never</i> had it. You are a
poor man;&mdash;so poverty-stricken by habit and taste
that no fortune could change it. Those choosing
to share your lot, can not venture the offer of
changing it. You are like granite, which, accidentally
thrust upon the soil, or washed bare by the
inroads of the sea, or even hammered and transported,
still remains a plain, hard rock. Yet I,
believing that there was a core in your nature of
molten fire which I might strike into, gave you all
my hopes, with patience and desire. I am not
capable of owning that I have failed. You would
not come to me, nor allow me to go to you; but I
never gave up my love. My soul shall take up the
thread of the unfinished web which it has so faithfully
woven here, to continue it wherever my soul
goes."</p>

<p>The description of her feelings gave rise to a
self-pity which made her appearance very touching.
Something abstract came into her face also, which
divested her of excitement, and made her statue-like.
Argus was silent; something made him wipe
his face constantly.</p>

<p>"It is very late," Virginia resumed. "Shall
I see now about your returning, and rouse
Moses?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, if you please. I&mdash;I am but a man,
as I said once before. If I dared,&mdash;I would ask
you to marry me. I don't dare."</p>

<p>"Let us say no more now; I will leave you. As
soon as Moses is ready, he will call you. Good-by,
Argus." She extended her hand at arm's
length from him.</p>

<p>"Are you going to leave me this way?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Good-by; farewell."</p>

<p>He tried in vain to detain her, but could as easily
have grasped a rolling cloud as her suddenly retreating,
gliding figure.</p>

<p>Moses left him at the gate of Temple House,
and before he was half-way up the walk Sebastian
met him.</p>

<p>"I slept in my chair for you, Argus. How you
have prowled this night! Roxalana said much,
and then went to her little charge. I believe it to
be your breakfast hour, nearly."</p>

<p>"Come in, quick, the air is raw," answered Argus,
springing up the steps. "I hope it is as late
as you say; we are so much the nearer to dinner,
that being the case. What do you say to a cigar?
On the whole, though, I'll not smoke. I'll go to
bed. Where is my bed, I wonder? Give me your
hand, Sebastian."</p>

<p>They shook hands a long time.</p>

<p>"I hope the male saints know how glad I am to
see you," said Sebastian; "the female saints could
never understand it."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

</div>

<p>THE white water-violet lifted its slender stem
above the marshy sod of the pastures; star-shaped
tufts, spires of nameless weeds, spread along
the margin of sunken brooks; and red and purple
stalky grass sprouted thinly over dry, sandy
patches. The crows flew constantly between their
nests in the woods of Apsley river, and the shores
of the bay. Sebastian Ford gathered the violets,
and watched the crows; the fields were sodden
and barren, the damp sea wind roared round him
continually, and the weak sunshine, pouring
through a dull, cold sky, shed a dismal light; but
the gathering of the flowers gave him a singular
delight; and the crows peopled the solitude for
him. A human creature, walking by the water's
edge&mdash;as they did, with contemplative gravity, or
grotesquely hopping in the fields&mdash;and joining
other human creatures in a slow, noisy procession
from one stone wall to another, would have destroyed
the effect of the scene. Any flower besides
the sweet violet, which, although trembling in the
wind, and dashed with rain and fog, kept its colors
full and fresh, and its delicious odor, he would have
passed unheeded. He asked Argus what was the
secret that made them so frail, yet so vigorous;
the crows so gay and solemn; himself so happy,
yet so expectant?</p>

<p>"The truth is," Argus replied, "having worn
out all traditionary romance, you are now trying to
extract nourishment from some nameless ideality,
and to interpret it by these facts. It is pretty much
like a bear's sucking his own claws; the roots of
your present happiness are in yourself. The time
will come, probably, for you to rush out of these
recesses,&mdash;famished, savage; and, like other men,
demand your natural prey."</p>

<p>"Though I search for nothing at present, neither
within nor without, I recognize a power which may
saturate my fibres, as a spring saturates the sand it
hides under. You do not say that all thirst may
not be slaked?"</p>

<p>"I am not thirsty; and so I say nothing. I was
merely thinking of your age, and how faithfully it
reflects whatever is presented to it."</p>

<p>"And what does yours reflect? Argus, you are
changed."</p>

<p>"You are trying to make me a philosopher."</p>

<p>"How goes the heart of a philosopher?"</p>

<p>Sebastian laid his hand against the heart of Argus,
and softly kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>"It stands still," said Argus.</p>

<p>"This is the rock I came ashore on; perhaps it
should remain immovable, for the performance of
another great deed."</p>

<p>"If my heart could be moved, surely it should be
moved now, under your hand, Sebastian; it has become
an easy thing to feel an affection for you."</p>

<p>The strange contraction of Sebastian's intense
eyes suddenly became visible, and Argus felt
searched in every nerve.</p>

<p>"Keep off your eyes, for God's sake, from me,"
he cried. "I may have lost the old bearings; if you
choose to be speculative, rascal, I must, too."</p>

<p>But Sebastian was not satisfied with the impression
he now received from Argus. Did he suffer
from that inevitable <i>ennui</i> which alike visits solitude
and society, enters the fairest structures of
the soul, and dwells with their wreck? Were the
limited, rigid, self-denying practices of the resolute
Argus corrosive? Did he recall the beatitudes
of the senses which young men play fast and
loose with, and old men consider a despairing
dream or but the ripples which rise, break, and
disappear on the surface of that ocean of the soul,
whose depths no mortal ever stirs? Was it the indescribable
sadness which accepts life and immortality,
"and all I was, in ashes"? Or something
less,&mdash;poverty, fretting obligation? He pondered
long over the subject, and then endeavored to
bring about a change which should relieve Argus.</p>

<p>"Give me half of Temple House," he begged,
"and share your money with me."</p>

<p>"You are to be trusted with neither. I should
soon hear the walls opening, after the manner of your
Spanish earthquakes, and my money would vanish
in your little Spanish games."</p>

<p>"I have nothing Spanish about me now&mdash;my
games are all played. I have no other country
than the spot you gave me, and absolutely no other
tie outside of it."</p>

<p>"So much the better for you. Avoid ties."</p>

<p>"I have a little money over there still."</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"And I would like to have it over here."</p>

<p>"Is it in bags? Come, Sebastian, what are
you at?"</p>

<p>The statement of Sebastian's wishes and explanations
finally induced Argus to leave his employment
in Kent, and resume his idle habits. The liberty of
the elms at sunrise or sunset was his once more;
the old comedies came out from their retreat, and
his tongue regained its ancient bitterness,&mdash;which
gave Mat Sutcliffe the conclusion that all was as it
should be with the Capen. Mary Sutcliffe, taking
the advantage of meal time one day, made a representation
to Mat of the "goings on" at Temple
House; and although inartistic, she was quite
able to seize Sebastian's individuality and describe
his influence.</p>

<p>"Your Mr. Ford," she said, "is a vagabones.
His dark blood is thick for work, but thin for
deviltry. The sea turned him into the Gates
family, and he could, if he willed to do so, turn
the Gates family into the sea. As for that ship
being his,&mdash;it wasn't,&mdash;the cargo wasn't. What was
the cargo, I should like to know? Rum? Slaves?
Opium? But the sea did not swallow all,&mdash;it left
something which he carried in his face; better for
some folks if it had swallowed it. I tell you he
can wind women round his little finger; he draws
them out of themselves with his narrow eyes that
cut like a knife. I feel 'em when he looks at
me, at the back of my head; it seems as if I must
part his eyebrows and look into them for what he
knows is a treasure. Up at the house, it is go
here, and go there, as polite as pie. 'Chloe,
where is my flower-glass?' 'Roxalana, sit here.'
'Tempe, will you have a chair?' 'Argus, here,
oh, Argus, do!' Now, who is your Mr. Ford,
that he should drum the Gates family up and down
with his tongue? I say he'll turn out to be the wuss
kind of a vagabones."</p>

<p>"Georgey likes him," replied Mat seriously.</p>

<p>"And Argus?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Roxalana?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Chloe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And how about Tempe?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't like him."</p>

<p>"I say she does."</p>

<p>"I say she does not." And Mat struck his plate
smartly with his knife, jumped to his feet, planted
his hands on the table, and eyed Mary angrily.
She poured herself a cup of tea from a battered
teapot at her elbow, with an affectation of calmness.</p>

<p>"You know she couldn't like a swarthy foreigner,"
he continued. "It's impossible. She
sha'n't."</p>

<p>"Cat's foot! he ain't a foreigner, he is a man,&mdash;and
as handsome as ever he can live; handsomest
creature I ever laid eyes on; beats that English
buster, Carfield, up at the Forge, and going to
marry Virginia Brande, to rags; beats everybody
in wits. Roxalana Gates will crawl on her hands
and knees for him; Capen Gates would sell his
soul and body for him; Tempe would lie her eyes
out, and cheat the devil to catch him. And you,
I couldn't say what you wouldn't demean yourself
in, to please that ugly, dark, cross-looking gypsy."</p>

<p>"Slack, or I'll choke you. It is through his
means that the Capen can do as he likes now;
that reg'lar work used him up nigh. Gates is web-footed,
he can only paddle ashore; he ain't fit for
business, and you know it; that's the reason he's
a miser, you fool. Maybe,&mdash;but I haven't thought
of it before,&mdash;that's the reason he won't&mdash;but
things are going on right up at the house, and
you'd better keep a civil tongue in your head."</p>

<p>"If you've settled it," continued Mary, "I hope
you'll sit down again, and go on with your beef and
pork. Lord knows it was long enough biling."</p>

<p>"If it fails to go down it won't be for want of
sarse. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Moll;
you are going on for fifty, and yet you keep being
a damned tartar."</p>

<p>"I am three years younger than you are."</p>

<p>"'Pears to me now, I had no excuse at all for
taking you alongside; I didn't put in for wrinkles,
or a red nose, or a bald spot on the top of your
head."</p>

<p>Mary's fortitude gave way and she began to cry
and bite her apron.</p>

<p>"Go to your Fords," she said, "and your Georgeys,
and stay. I can't get a stick of wood chopped,
nor a handful of shavings brought in to kindle my
fire with, by you. I might as well call on the town
now as any time."</p>

<p>"There, there,&mdash;it's all right, dry up; ain't I
coming home to supper? This ere beef is first-rate.
I'll tell you something. Mr. Ford has offered me
wages to keep the garden, and I think he wants me
to contrive to do the Capen's errands, and be a
kind of a right-hand man for Mrs. Roxalana, in
matters she has had to do with respecting odds and
ends, you know."</p>

<p>"I always knew that Mr. Ford would do what
was right. How much did he offer?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know when I come back. Don't
say that again about the gal,&mdash;will you?&mdash;Tempe?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean it."</p>

<p>"I knew you were in fun."</p>

<p>But after he had gone, she said to herself, "Only
I <i>did</i> mean it. That man will marry Tempe. The
weight of Roxalana Gates's will is enough for that;
I know her slow brass. Sho, they are lumps of
putty in her hands. Down she goes on her hams,
and every soul of them gets crooked in the knee.
Smooth as pie-crust, sluggish as an eel in the mud,
but sensible as death&mdash;she knows what she is about.
There comes Sally Bayley with a bowl in one hand
to borrow something, and my dishes are not
washed."</p>

<p>Virginia also learned Sebastian's influence. Since
her interview with Argus she had given up her
familiar visits to Temple House, and went no more
by the path from the Forge. She now came
through the town, in her carriage generally, and in
full dress, as if she were on a round of formal calls,
which included the Gates family. Arriving late one
afternoon on foot, with card-case, lace parasol, and
enveloped in a cashmere shawl, she dropped into a
chair with an expression in her face which Roxalana
liked.</p>

<p>"I am tired out, Roxalana," she exclaimed. "I
am sick of Mrs. Ring and Wing, and King. Their
front doors and tongues are alike; their religion,
flounces, and card-baskets are the same; their
scandal list and subscription list run neck and neck.
Tell me something different. Oh, how nice you
are, Roxalana! pleasant old gown, and careless,
twisted hair, how I love you."</p>

<p>"Do stay, Virginia; I have not seen you for
weeks. It is pleasant when you are here. Chloe
has brought me snatches and fragments of you,
and that is all I get. I feel as if an inquiry respecting
the Forge now would be an intrusion. I
should be very glad to have you speak of your
affairs at home, should you choose to do so."</p>

<p>"Lowly, shabby, cigar-flavored room," said Virginia,
"how delightful you are! cracked panes,
sunken hearthstone, mappy ceiling, you are delicious!
Where did the flower-glass come from? A
wild-flower in it,&mdash;who brings them here?"</p>

<p>"Sebastian."</p>

<p>"No; I cannot stay, it is impossible."</p>

<p>She tossed her card-case and parasol upon the
table, however, and unfastened her shawl.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful shawl!" said Roxalana, pinching
its texture.</p>

<p>"I wish you would take it for a rug; I see yours
on the hearth is full of holes."</p>

<p>Roxalana laughed, and put out her foot to designate
the newest one, and Virginia saw that her
shoes had holes also.</p>

<p>"Let us put our feet on the shawl this minute,
Roxalana." And Virginia threw it on the floor,
and trampled it.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful dress," said Roxalana. "I
am fond of this soft, heavy black silk, and I prefer
velvet trimming too."</p>

<p>"Does my dress please you, dear?"</p>

<p>"It is an agreeable change for my eyes. You
know we are not strong on finery in any respect."</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Ford? I have not met him since
his return."</p>

<p>"I am surprised. He is on his usual ramble.
Why,&mdash;when did you see Argus last?"</p>

<p>"The very night of his return,&mdash;Mr. Ford, I
mean&mdash;to Temple House."</p>

<p>"Where was he?"</p>

<p>"At our house; he came to see father."</p>

<p>"Argus is an inscrutable man; I do not approve
of him at all. Did you see him?"</p>

<p>Virginia clasped her hands nervously, but looked
steadily at Roxalana and answered, "I saw him
at night."</p>

<p>The dark red fire slowly kindled in Roxalana's
cheek.</p>

<p>"Where is that man?" she said rolling her eyes;
"I want him. Who knew that you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carfield."</p>

<p>"Was he present throughout the interview?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that Argus put him out of the parlor:
but I do not know."</p>

<p>Roxalana then gave one of her shaking, short
laughs, which made Virginia smile in spite of her
agitation.</p>

<p>"It is certain he fought for you, Virginia; but
why don't you know what he did?"</p>

<p>"Because, Roxalana, I had thrown myself at the
feet of Argus, and fell as senseless a heap as this
shawl is. I did so in the hope of escaping from
Mr. Carfield. I am a slave, Roxalana, and have the
blood and spirit of a slave. I can not, dare not,
follow even the imperious dictates of my wishes.
No; for all I was desperate enough to toss my
heart to Argus, it was for defense. I am afraid of
my father. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Take off your gloves," said Roxalana, in a
stern voice, "and spend the remainder of the afternoon
with me. The time has passed, certainly,
for fathers to compel their children into unwilling
marriages."</p>

<p>"But my own principles interfere with my wishes.
I can not help believing just as he believes about
their direction. How can I disunite myself from
his well-knit, reasonable plans?"</p>

<p>"I do not see what a profound love has to do
with principle, or reason. If love was not a separate
power, impregnable to conscience, human nature
would be a feebly sustained thing. It should
exist for itself, and by itself, and then, through it, we
poor creatures may be exalted in spite of vice and
crime. Don't you think so? Would you like to live
for Argus?"</p>

<p>"Roxalana, you are the last person to aid me in
my way, my father's way, I mean. Let me go now,
happy at least in having seen you."</p>

<p>"Would you like to live for Argus?"</p>

<p>"Live for him! Do I not? Must I speak to you,
also, of the secret which makes me infinite? The
remembrance of his embrace, and the hope of it,
give immortality to my past and future. My interior
life rises and rolls like a flood over the thick and
purposeless darkness of my outward life. This interior
life consists of love for Argus; my real being is
there, Roxalana. Its tissues vibrate and sparkle
under its sway, as running water under a moonlight
sky. I acknowledge it strange, but I believe that in
me <i>Love</i> has completed his divine circle. Argus
belongs to my happiness,&mdash;in soul and body. To
live <i>with</i> him would be to renounce terrors, pain,
the evil of my odious and enforced existence. It
would prove so seductive and binding an alliance,
which though conscience might vaguely accuse me
of falling into the depths of a great temptation, I
should never beseech God to deliver me from it.
You have known this, Roxalana, have you not, my
sister?"</p>

<p>Roxalana fell back on the density which always
aided her when people passed beyond her limits.
Faithful as she was to her ideal of love, but incapable
of approaching the meaning of Virginia's
passion, she wandered at once from the intensity
of the scene, with a happy sense which made her
so invaluable a relief to those attached to her.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> couldn't leave him, you may be quite sure,"
she said; "life would be valueless, if absent from
him. I do not in many respects approve
of him. He has cold, hard manners, but he is
sincere and proud; these traits have made his
habits simple; simple habits, if practiced a long
time, will have a good effect upon the character.
Our life is meager enough, as you have doubtless
observed. For years we have had to manage on
small means; made to be acquainted with all sorts
of economies. Could you endure the change?
Would you not grow sick of 'pleasant old gowns,'
if you were compelled to wear them?"</p>

<p>It struck Virginia she would not look as well in
them as Roxalana did; and a sad feeling stole
over her at the thought of the impossibility of ever
making herself a harmonious portion of Temple
House.</p>

<p>"I would not invade your premises unless I
came to learn of you," she answered. "As I have
learned so much on compulsion, it would not
be difficult to learn a little more."</p>

<p>"I think I would not like to have you come with
money; it might unsettle us terribly. I am sure
Argus dislikes the cares of property. Sebastian
has none, or very little,&mdash;enough barely to cover
his small expenses with us, and it makes his being
here appear so much the more an admirable arrangement.
You are aware how entirely he suits
Argus."</p>

<p>"Argus came to our house to pay back borrowed
money."</p>

<p>"Did he? I knew nothing of it."</p>

<p>"It was borrowed for Mr. Ford's use, I know;
he never would have borrowed it for his own."</p>

<p>"Yet you must recollect that Argus had business
transactions with your father years ago."</p>

<p>"He put his hand on my head once, when I was
a little girl, and looking up I saw his face for the
first time; I liked him then. And now I will go."</p>

<p>She began drawing on her gloves leisurely.
Roxalana stepped to the door and called in Chloe.</p>

<p>"Your missey will stay till evening, provided I
send you home with her. I am greatly inclined to
have her see us at our tea-table. Look up Tempe,
Chloe, and I will bring down Georgey. You must
have a sight of my boy, Virginia; he is the most
intelligent child you ever saw,&mdash;wise beyond his
months, and more beautiful than any picture."</p>

<p>"If I must stay, I must," replied Virginia.
"There is no help for you, Chloe; to tell the truth
I am glad to have my scruples overcome."</p>

<p>"The gentlemen will be expecting you back,
missey," said Chloe, shaking Virginia's shawl, and
folding it. "Spec' the Forge fires will die down
dead, and Mr. Brande will take hisself to his bed,
Mr. Carfield will betake hisself to all out-doors if
you don't show yourself behind our china tea-cups
at seven o'clock precisely. 'Pears to me I am
agoing to walk home with you, and so slow to-night;
and that after I get there I shall play Indian.
Mis' Gates, have you seen any Indian in
me for ever so long? Haven't I been regular in
life's warfare?"</p>

<p>"Your conduct is acceptable, Chloe," said Roxalana.
"Perhaps you had better pass the night at
Mr. Brande's."</p>

<p>"Do you know that I never go and come by the
path now?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"Missey, you are welcome to any whim you can
indulge yourself with. The Lord knows your
chances are few enough."</p>

<p>Virginia, seated at the table soon after, slowly
drinking tea from the old frail china, tasting Roxalana's
most famous sweetmeats, drifted entirely
from the Brande world, and wafted like a feather
through the currents of the atmosphere, filling her
with a serene pleasure.</p>

<p>Her voice and manner, confiding, winning, submissive,
struck even Tempe and Chloe; the noble
movement of her head, the lustrous eyes, full,
eager lips, her beautiful jeweled hands, and the
exquisite art of her somber dress, recalled to Sebastian
memories of far different days. So with Argus.
The cool, colorless cloud of isolation so long enfolding
him parted and drifted away; for the present
he did not resist a subtle arrogance which the
knowledge of Virginia's love gave him. When his
domineering eyes and speech flashed out, Sebastian
was reminded of the revolving lights on the lonely
northern coast. What made the solitary Argus so
brilliant?</p>

<p>Roxalana's quiet, solid spirit enjoyed the occasion
to the full. In her estimation it was a reasonable
one; it could have no reaction, no extra
candles were burning, there was no waste in
the teapot. She ate little&mdash;for that was her habit&mdash;sat
almost silent her face was dark and heavy as
at all times, her voice slowly drawling; yet she was
a forcible presence and an acceptable one.</p>

<p>"Is this like the old time, Virginia," inquired
Tempe, "when you were in the way of running
down from the Forge alone? It is not to me."</p>

<p>"It is different," Virginia replied.</p>

<p>Chloe caught the glance, as it passed between
Argus and Virginia, which revealed their secret.
She instantly, though offering cake, made a mental
prayer, entreating God not to prevent the match;
for there was conversion and money in it for Argus,
peace, freedom and indulgence for Virginia. She
also prayed that Mr. Carfield might be removed.</p>

<p>"Miss Brande," said Sebastian, "I like to collect
your cold, lonely wild flowers, they surprise me!
Where may I not, in this strange soil, find the
most beautiful blossom? I recall a poet who said:
'The love which speaks, sings, wails in one part
of creation, reveals itself in the other half under
the form of flowers.' The counterpart of these
pale, perfect, frail flowers&mdash;what can it be?"</p>

<p>A brilliant color flew into Tempe's face, and she
exclaimed, "The flowers you bring home, Sebastian,
last a few weeks only, and then even their
stalks and leaves die down to the ground."</p>

<p>"It is only a common love they designate after
all, you see," said Argus. "Are you developing a
botanical taste, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"I despise flowers, and those who love them,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"Tempe," said Roxalana, "why do you choose
to be contrary just at this moment, on the infrequent
occasion of Virginia's visit? You like my
tulips very well."</p>

<p>"The sight of them makes me sick."</p>

<p>"She is a little cactus," Sebastian said, in a low
tone, to Virginia.</p>

<p>"Our conservatory is in beautiful order, Tempe,"
said Virginia, with a smile to Sebastian; "I am
sure you would like those queer foreign plants."</p>

<p>"I like little that is foreign,&mdash;neither cactus,
nor aloes, nor pine-apples, centipedes, scorpions,
parrots."</p>

<p>"I shall yet fetch you a pink cockatoo, prettier
than yourself. Miss Tempe," said Sebastian.</p>

<p>"And Chloe must fetch me from this," said Virginia,
looking at her watch, "since you decree,
Roxalana, that I am to be escorted."</p>

<p>"I think," said Argus quietly, "I heard your
carriage at the gate just now."</p>

<p>Roxalana looked sternly at Virginia, and said,
"If that Mr. Carfield has come for you, as I presume
he has, in his capacity as your jailor, I hope
he will break his neck in coming up the steps.
Argus, if I were you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't Argus me," interrupted Argus roughly,
"Moses is walking up the path. Mr. Carfield will
not enter our doors."</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. Chloe let in Mr. Carfield,
with a crush hat in one hand, and a twisted
glove in the other; he was perfectly unconcerned,
his lips were parted by a gay smile as he
made a low bow to Roxalana, who, returning it,
immediately folded her hands rigidly, and
stared at him. His glance caught up the countenances
of every person present; in the face of
Argus he read an entire understanding of the insolence
which had brought him hither. Virginia
mechanically introduced him, and made a hasty
sign to Tempe, who refused to recognize it.</p>

<p>"It became cloudy suddenly. Miss Brande,"
said Mr. Carfield, "and your father mentioning
your dress as unfit to encounter a shower, thought
best to send for you. I drove over in the wagon,
accordingly."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she replied; "I did not dream of
a storm, it has been so bright and pleasant here."</p>

<p>"I imagined it," he returned. "Mrs. Gates is
the soul of hospitality, I have been told. Temple
House is a refuge,&mdash;catholic, tranquil, refined."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," Sebastian remarked.
"What happy circumstance gave you this penetration,
since, unlike myself, you were not allowed to
reach this haven?"</p>

<p>"Your accuracy is remarkable, sir," added Roxalana.</p>

<p>"There will be no storm, Virginia," interrupted
Argus, who had been at the window to scan the
sky; "if you prefer walking home, I will go with
you."</p>

<p>"Can not I go also?" asked Sebastian.</p>

<p>Virginia, who stood shawled and gloved, with
her eyes on the floor, hesitated; the idea of the
way between Temple House and the Forge
attended by the three men was an oppressive one.
She dreaded, also, lest a second devastation scene
should occur with Argus and Mr. Carfield, if the
same chance was offered them. Argus was weaker
now, she knew,&mdash;his heart was open to her, and
Mr. Carfield was a devil. Yet the idea of the two-mile
drive with him, in the dark, behind his rushing
black stallion, between whom and himself was
a feud of kicks, snorts, curses and blows, was still
worse. There was an instant of silence; Tempe
glided round the table, and under the pretense of
pulling out Virginia's bonnet strings, whispered:</p>

<p>"I would not go with you, for you wanted to
make me a cat's paw; I understand. I won't
make speeches to your beau for the sake of having
you keep your mouth shut. And now Sebastian
wants to be a cat's paw. Pretty doings, I should
think."</p>

<p>"Tempe, you weary me," Virginia whispered
harshly. "Heaven help me, you think there are
no limits to my patience."</p>

<p>Tempe, with a shrug, turned from her and met
Mr. Carfield's eyes; an electricity passed from one
to the other, and revealed an evil affinity. He saw
that her sharp, passionate, ethereal face was suited
to the tortures which self-will, hatred, and suspicion
can inflict; and she felt by intuition that he possessed
the force given by such traits, and that it
could be excited without scruple.</p>

<p>"Did you drive Black Tom down?" asked Virginia
suddenly, looking up at Mr. Carfield. "You
know how much I am afraid of him."</p>

<p>He replied that he came with another horse,
though at that time Black Tom was knocking his
jaws against the stone underpinning of the gully
wall, and lolling his tongue with the pain of his bit.
Without a word Virginia kissed Roxalana and
swept out of the room; Mr. Carfield, waving his
glove by way of a parting salute, stepped quickly
after her, and was followed by Argus and Sebastian.
They found Chloe down by the gate with a lantern.
She held it over the palings as Virginia descended
the steps, who saw by its light that Mr. Carfield
had lied to her; he was untying Black Tom's rein
from the ring in the wall. There was no retreat;
she must go with him now, and turning to Argus,
she thrust him back, and said:</p>

<p>"Don't come any further, Argus; good-night."</p>

<p>He caught her hand, kissed it, and let her go;
Sebastian, catching a glimpse of the act, hastily
swung over the palings beside Chloe.</p>

<p>"Why, damn this gentleman!" he said coolly;
"it strikes me that this is the Black Tom she is
afraid of."</p>

<p>Virginia, already in the wagon, raised her face
at the sound of his voice, and her sad, sweet, pale
vision, framed in the darkness, plunging through it,
out of sight, to the thundering sound of the madly
beating iron feet, made his brain dizzy, his heart
throb, then the waves surged over him again,&mdash;singing,
sparkling, multitudinous, boundless!</p>

<p>"Roll over me," he muttered; "leave me dead,
or free forever. To die, and come to life in convulsion;
to open weary eyes in the blaze and triumph
of other eyes; speak extorted words, lips to
lips; to drag, lift, wing my soul through a maze
whose winding ways but return to their mysterious
beginning, and start again soul by soul&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Have marcy," said Chloe, rattling her lantern;
"<i>I</i> knew it. If I hadn't been afraid, while you
were all bowing and scraping inside, I'd ha' poured
scalding water down on that horse; I could ha'
done it; the kettle was full, hissing on the fire; but
I should have been turned out of meeting. I
should never hear the last of it from Mr. Brande;
with his handkerchief he'd ha' waved me into perdition;
and so I said, 'Go away, Indian, come
again, Christian,' lighted my lantern, and walked
down here 'spectable."</p>

<p>"You are all afraid here, Chloe,&mdash;except Roxalana,&mdash;she
is a great soul, living largely in little
things," Sebastian remarked.</p>

<p>"When we want to commit a deadly sin, the most
of us ain't a mite afraid; but in the 'how-are-yous,'
and 'do come agains,' we are scared."</p>

<p>They heard Argus scratching a match on the
steps.</p>

<p>"No matter whether he sees his way into the
house or not," she said angrily.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Go in yourself; I shall stay
out and smoke. The moon is rising."</p>

<p>As she disappeared up the path, Argus came up
the steps and offered Sebastian a cigar.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he remarked.</p>

<p>Sebastian politely accepted the cigar, smoked
said nothing, and fixed his eyes on the moon tossing
up the crest of King's Hill, in a mass of pearly
spume, and throwing a spectral light against the
house and lawn.</p>

<p>"I thought so, from his lying face," continued
Argus. "It did not surprise me to see the brute
he loves to drive and beat."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Sebastian at last, with an effort
to obtain a better view of the moon, which averted
his head from Argus. "And you did not break
the jaws of the two beasts?"</p>

<p>Argus chuckled, swore, drew a fiery star at the
end of his cigar, threw it over the fence, and said;</p>

<p>"Are you cold, Sebastian?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary."</p>

<p>"On fire, then?"</p>

<p>"Is not the first touch of ice like fire?"</p>

<p>"I shall tell you something. Can you stay out
in the air till I have done? I would have you."</p>

<p>"Very well, Argus, go on."</p>

<p>Argus related his experience with Mr. Carfield,
and in spite of himself betrayed the part Virginia
played in their interview at Brande's house. The
moon, swelling over the crowding vapor, hung in
the clear sky above their heads, and illuminated the
spot where the dark figures with their pale faces
stood. To Sebastian's mind it appeared an illumination
cold, distant, showing him Virginia's form
wrapped in the camlet cloak as Argus described her.</p>

<p>"You and the Englishman are rivals then," he
asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How shall I understand you?"</p>

<p>"The devil! what do you wish to understand?
Have I not explained the reason of my not falling
upon Carfield. I do not fancy the business of
avenger."</p>

<p>"Take care; love for an imbroglio is in my
blood. The terrible bath in your bay, which I hear
now shivering like a hound, did not wash it out.
Argus, do you love that girl? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, what are you talking about? Do you
see love in me? Come, we have been here long
enough."</p>

<p>"And she flew to you to escape that man, flew
to you for protection?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Argus savagely. "But did
you not see her happy to-night? Oh, she belongs
in her place, and I in mine."</p>

<p>"She is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I have a mind to stroll along the shore; will
you come, Argus, with another cigar?"</p>

<p>"No, Sebastian, I never go now where the horizon
extends itself. The bay looks well to-night,
by the position of the moon, limitless to the south.
You will like it. I'll turn into my chamber."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

</div>

<p>THE months which followed this evening seemed
to hang over the heads of Argus and Sebastian
changeless, like the light of the midnight sun.
For the most part, in passing, existence is badly
constructed; people find it impossible to make
their life-drama a unity. Jove does not thunder at
the right moment; the chorus have fallen asleep;
the toga has not come from the tailor's; the train
was delayed at Pottsville. The mind has no
power over to-day. It may reflect upon the past,
and watch the future, but it can not see nor understand
the combinations of the present; how one
event opposes another; how one holds the rest in
solution; how they all fail to bring about the
result which the one in its hopes, or in its despairs,
waits for. There is no intervention between
the passions of men and Olympus, in the
Greek tragedy; its tormenting flame ascends to
the deities who can not control its devastation;
they may hear and see with the ears and eyes of
gods, but they are helpless in the presence of
those emotions whose being is in the senses, and is
as powerful as themselves. In our time the tragedy
is as mournful, but different; it is dull, complex,
prolonged; it is environed by moral necessities,
and the analysis of opinion; it is apt to exist
without beauty or dignity, but it still exists, for
tragedy is an immortal heritage.</p>

<p>More than a year, with the memories of the days
to be observed, as the causes of an inroad upon
the peaceful life of Argus, passed: the hours of
little Georgey swiftly traversed this neutral ground,
and he entered upon his second year. His summer
birthday was brilliant, and chirping like himself.
The lazy sea was more quiet than the tanned
waste of fields beyond Temple House, where hosts
of crickets and strong-winged grasshoppers crawled
and flew, and sang day and night. The sun,
hot in the bare blue sky, tinged the sandy shore
with yellow hues, burnt the mats of seaweed to an
ugly black, and stained the vines and shrubs along
the walls in red and umber. It blazed upon
Apsley River, now pale and shallow, receding day
by day, and fell in a solid mass of blinding brightness
on the tree-like shrubs along its borders;&mdash;shrubs,
covered with balls, and spiral blossoms,&mdash;brown,
amber, and white, stuffed with clusters of
berries, bitter, milky, acrid, colored purple, red,
and green. It scorched the roofs and pavements
in the town, and suppressed the hum of business;
people sat in darkened rooms, and mopped their
foreheads, and fanned themselves with great palm-leaf
fans. On that day, Roxalana, in a flowered
silk shawl and antiquated bonnet, went into town
to make a purchase. A faint opposition rose from
Tempe and Chloe when it came home, for it was a
high chair of basket-work in which she intended to
install Georgey, and keep him beside her at meal
time. Argus whistled slightly when he saw him
perched up at the table in a quaint white frock,
and his dead-gold hair clinging in rings round his
head; but Sebastian, telling Roxalana that he perceived
she had had one of her inspirations, took
him chair and all, and carried him to the place
next his own, for he loved the child. The agitations
whose approach he had begun to feel and
dread, had been shut out by the love which had
so unexpectedly come to him;&mdash;"the love which
reveals itself in flowers," of which he had spoken
to Virginia, blossomed from the soul of the lovely
child, and spread like a vine over the surface of
his nature,&mdash;that nature so simple, sweet and
patient, yet sometimes so lost in ungovernable
depths, sometimes so fallen, exhausted, apathetic.</p>

<p>Georgey's first word was <i>Bastian</i>.</p>

<p>"I am blarsted," said Mat Sutcliffe to Roxalana,
when he first observed the frolicsome, exacting,
tender intimacy between Sebastian and the child,
"if my Moll isn't about right in regard to this ere
Ford. Actilly my little G. Gates loves him, and
gives me the go-by altogether."</p>

<p>"Why Mat," she replied apologetically, "Sebastian's
being here all the time, while you are here
only at night and morning, accounts for it. You
may depend, though, that we shall all have enough
to do to manage that peculiar child."</p>

<p>"It will be a different day from this when I see
a member of the Gates family managed; 'tain't in
'em to <i>be</i> managed. As for his peculiarity, I don't
agree with you; he is the most reasonable creetur
in the world; he likes to go the way folks don't
want him to go in."</p>

<p>Roxalana laughed, for at that moment they heard
Georgey crying out on the lawn against Sebastian's
opposition to having grass put into his mouth and
ears.</p>

<p>Tempe's strange indifference towards her child
continued, though since he and Sebastian made
themselves so busy together in playing, and talking
in that jargon which is bestowed upon those
who love children by their good fairies, she had
followed him from place to place, and watched
them. Her strange behavior finally hurt Sebastian,
and he spoke of it to Argus.</p>

<p>"Have you no faith in the maternal passion?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I think I met with it in the jungle, and not
since," Argus answered.</p>

<p>"I never saw Tempe kiss her boy."</p>

<p>Argus shrugged his shoulders. "<i>I</i> never saw
her kiss anybody."</p>

<p>"When I was young," said Sebastian, ripples of
light breaking into his eyes, "my mother loved me.
God knows that she could never make me forget
it, though afterwards, rather than the enfolding of
her arms, I would have had a serpent's coil round
my heart."</p>

<p>"Why, Sebastian, you are coming out with obituaries.
Better let the brambles and weeds grow
over your monuments, and hide them."</p>

<p>"No, no, I will remember my mother, in my love
for Georgey. His maternal memory will be&mdash;Roxalana."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to blame the poor woman, of
course. She has a great love for the child; and,
to refer to monuments again, <i>her</i> memory associates
him with her husband, my brother George,
who was a scamp."</p>

<p>"And where was Tempe's husband when the
child was named? dead in fact, I know&mdash;but where
in feeling?"</p>

<p>"If her affair with that boy, Drake, which lasted
a few weeks only, lasted long enough to impress
upon her the character of a widow, she deserves
great credit for being a heartless hussey."</p>

<p>"Your women are all strange."</p>

<p>"They are as like to the women you have known
as pea-pods are; possibly the peas inside may be a
little less or more full, but, given the same circumstances,
you have the same female. Stick to your
affection for Georgey; adopt him, for I feel little
interest in him. I don't like the blood on either
side."</p>

<p>Poor Georgey! Even at that time there were
signs of failure in his face; Sebastian was the first
to observe them. They struck him a coward; he
felt like making a desperate, selfish effort to escape
from the calamity which he believed must fall.
He watched all who came in contact with Georgey
for a corroboration, and a denial of his fears.
Would that he could carry him to the gates of
heaven and leave him with all his beauty, to enter
without a trace of suffering!</p>

<p>The time soon arrived when the days and nights
were as one to Georgey; when his hot, tremulous
hands remained where they were placed; when
his marble feet were inert; and those who were
with him could not say whether a smile or a pang
drew his lips apart. And Roxalana had not spoken
a word concerning his danger. One evening
Sebastian took him from his little bed, and, thrust
through and through with anguish, held him
against his breast.</p>

<p>"He is going to die, Roxalana."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," she answered angrily, but avoiding
his eyes, "it is the season that makes Georgey so
languid. Children of his age are often as sick.
The summer is over, nearly, and he will revive;
this morning he liked his warm milk, and he looked
up at me with so intelligent an expression"&mdash;something
choked her bell-like voice, but she swallowed
it. "You are not accustomed to children. Georgey
has a good constitution; he never has had to
take medicine. I say he has an excellent constitution."</p>

<p>Sebastian said no more, and all mention of the
child was avoided after this; no one liked to
question her, the misery of her face was so dreadful.</p>

<p>"Argus, don't you see how that boy's life is
wasting?" asked Sebastian, a day or two afterwards.</p>

<p>"I know it, but nothing can be done."</p>

<p>"I weep for him. To have that sweetness vanish,&mdash;to
perceive the coming of the hour when I
shall no longer love him vitally, oh, it crushes the
meaning out of the world!"</p>

<p>"Remember that your former suffering has
passed away. You have suffered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From all things in love and death, except these
poignant, tender, pitying pangs."</p>

<p>Argus was surprised at the hold Georgey had
upon Sebastian's affections, and for his sake he was
desirous that he should live; Roxalana's silent,
inflexible grief troubled him also; but he could
give neither comfort, for in his soul he was as
indifferent as if he were the spectator of a game
not exactly to his taste. The last day was coming;
and what was the difference between to-day and
to-morrow or anybody? Mat Sutcliffe, at the
house daily, attending to all sorts of duty, faithful,
quiet, and cheerful, stoutly stood in his opinion
that Georgey would recover; but at last he was
compelled to admit there was no hope.</p>

<p>"I should like to know," he said to his wife
"how it is that none of our children have died.
Not one of 'em has had the least chance of it;
they have toughed it out, and are grown up, and
are good for nothing, while that little snow-wreath
of a creetur is melting away from us as fast as God
will let him; and he is worth more to that woman,
Roxalana, than a thousand men and women, and
worth something to me. Mary, he is dying at the
rate of nine knots. I can't abide the ways of the
Providence there's so much said about. The
doctor isn't good for anything. Hand us out that
big rummer."</p>

<p>"Rum is pizen," answered Mary, the tears running
down her face, "and death is pizen; and I
don't care who knows it. It is a sin and a shame
for that good, beautiful child to be sick, even, let
alone dying. Something should be done right
away; not a minute's time should be lost. I am
going over to the house. Have they given him
warm baths? I am going to step into Mrs. Goodwin's,
round the corner, who knows so much about
sickness, and ask her if she can't think of something
that hasn't been tried."</p>

<p>Mat shook his head.</p>

<p>"You had better go, and leave Mrs. Goodwin
alone; he is past medicine. Do up all your crying
now. Blarsted if I ain't full myself; there's been
nothing like it for twenty year. I thought my
eyes had got horny."</p>

<p>On a silent, windless morning in September
Georgey died. Sebastian, who had been beside
him through the night, at daybreak yielded to
a drowsy inclination, though he heard strange
sighs from Georgey, whose eyes were closed, and
fell asleep in his chair. As in a dream he was
startled by the clear, loud call of "<i>Bastian</i>" and
leaning over the bed he saw that a terrible struggle
had begun. As he left the room to summon
Roxalana, he heard "<i>Bastian</i>" again. It was a
cry for protection&mdash;the cry of a forsaken life&mdash;Georgey's
farewell.</p>

<p>Sebastian opened Roxalana's door and made a
hurried sign to her to follow him.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I shall never see him again.
I will send Chloe. Go back, Sebastian."</p>

<p>Bewildered and maddened at the solitude thrust
upon him, distracted at the cry that pierced his
heart, he ran back, and kneeling by the bed put
his hand upon Georgey's head, then threw himself
upon the floor and hid his face.</p>

<p>Presently Roxalana tottered out of her room
like an old woman, and meeting Chloe, stopped,
and stared at her without speaking; her eyes appeared
sightless.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Chloe, "but I can't find
Tempe; she isn't in her bed."</p>

<p>Roxalana shook her head.</p>

<p>"Have you called my husband?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Marcy on me," cried Chloe, "her mind is gone.
And after all this looking and waiting for death,
nobody's ready; and there is not a soul in sight.
Where is Capen Gates and Mat Sutcliffe?"</p>

<p>"Here I am," answered Mat from below. "No
use waking up Gates; it's no new thing to him,
this business. It is over, is it? I'm glad of it
This way, marm,&mdash;careful,&mdash;I see a nail sticking
out of the boards, you may stumble on't; let me
help you."</p>

<p>When Chloe went into that chamber she found
but one alive there,&mdash;the other lay in an attitude
of terror, struck out of life by the tyrant of one
kingdom, and not yet ready for any other. Chloe's
religion and philosophy were not proof against the
sight; she ran from the room, and did not stop
running till she came to Mary Sutcliffe's.</p>

<p>Sebastian remained alone. An hour, or many
hours, might have passed, when he felt something
touching his feet,&mdash;something groveling there; he
raised his face from the floor and discovered Tempe.</p>

<p>"It is you at last," he said fiercely. She crept
toward him and tried to take his hand, but he
sprang from the floor, and then she fell against his
knees.</p>

<p>"Come and embrace your child!" he cried,
compelling her to stand up. "Here, look upon
him,&mdash;for this cruelty were you born? You love
the cruel and the bitter alone. Oh, base, poltroon
heart, mother without sex!"</p>

<p>His every word shattered her with the force of
blows. Her eyes were wildly fixed upon the child,
and the sight broke her heart!</p>

<p>"Hush, Sebastian," and Argus stood behind
them. "You should not be here. Roxalana needs
you." Tempe threw out her arms convulsively,
and with her lips strained apart, shrieked: "Cruel
and bitter as I am, Sebastian&mdash;"</p>

<p>Argus caught her so quickly, that her utterance
was stifled.</p>

<p>"I'll take you away," he said. "You must obey
me. Not another scene like this; remember."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE shadow over Temple House, which otherwise
might have flitted with the autumnal
clouds, stayed motionless with Roxalana; she repelled
every interest which might aid her to drive
it away, and no longer ruled the house,&mdash;its contented
and comfort-dispensing spirit. Chloe declared
that her heavy, even tread in the passage
between her chair in the green room and her bedside
was wearing the floor away, as chained prisoners
wore the floor of their prisons. She was
not only dumb, but pretended deafness, that it
might not be expected to attend to conversation
going on in her presence. Her conduct
prevented sympathy or consolation from reaching
her; even Virginia, who sought her in the hope
of breaking down the barrier which shut her up
with grief, obtained a reply that disappointed the
hope effectually.</p>

<p>"What do you do in an eclipse," she asked
Virginia, "except to look at it through a piece of
smoked glass? Did you ever dream of interfering
with the laws which created the bodies to be
eclipsed? Why should you interfere with a mental
eclipse? One is as inevitable as the other. It is
not necessary now for you to penetrate the darkness
which I am in; wait till it surrounds you, then
you will learn the wisdom I practice. I have no
 fancy at all for looking at any subject in your light;
I have lost regard for life."</p>

<p>Neither would Tempe permit the friendly advances
which Virginia made. The perverse creature
behaved as if determined to quit the world
also; all her fire seemed to have burned down,
her sharp spirit evaporated. Nothing was alive in
her but languor; too restless with its consuming
influence, she could neither lie down or sit up for
any length of time, but drooped over the chairs
and settees, and covered her face from the light
with her arms. She avoided solitude, was afraid
of being left alone, though she did not wish to be
spoken to. She cried in her sleep, but shed no
tears when awake; made mouths at her food, and
tormented Chloe by long, unwinking fits of staring,
mute reverie. While she remained in this condition
it was Chloe's business to scold, expostulate,
and coax, for there was nobody else to do it; a
healthful disturbance was thereby kept up between
them, though it cost Chloe tears of vexation, and
Tempe unwilling smiles.</p>

<p>"I am going to die," she said one day, when
Chloe made a dash at her, and cried out to her
to speak. "Wouldn't you like to see me in a white
dress?"</p>

<p>"If you die," Chloe replied, "I'll never do anything
for you as long as I live."</p>

<p>Roxalana, who was present, gave an abrupt
laugh, so unexpected by Chloe, but which rejoiced
her so that she went into the kitchen, and sedately
skipped over the floor in acknowledgment of her
approval of the natural sign. It was during this
period, while Roxalana was wrapped in the cloud
of her grief, that Tempe approached her with
symptoms of affection never manifested before.
Roxalana made no response; if she had, perhaps
Tempe's pride and aversion to the expression of
sentiment would have suppressed it. When Sebastian
saw her on the floor, resting her head against
Roxalana's knees, still and self-absorbed, he stopped
as before a picture, and observed Tempe closely for
the first time in his life. He discovered in her an
extraordinary capacity for beauty; how was it
possible to develop it, and not really develop <i>her</i>
into one of those angels who make man's paradise
murky and lurid as the air of hell! Her brilliant,
silky hair was very long now, spreading low down
on her neck and brow in irregular lines, framing
her colorless complexion in dense black and white,
except her well-cut lips, which clung together
like the double scarlet blossoms which grow
on the twigs of slender, dark-stemmed shrubs.
He turned on his heel abruptly, and sought
Chloe.</p>

<p>"Is the little miss thinking of making her will?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Marcy, Mr. Sebastian, she hasn't a mite of
property. Nobody will be the better off for her
dying, and only <i>she</i> will be the worse. I hope she
won't go till she has met with a change."</p>

<p>"She may be on that road. What does it mean
that at this moment she is holding her dusky head
against her mother's knees?"</p>

<p>"If you expect me to account for anything that
happens here, I shall have to disappoint you.
'Pears to me, if this family can't be droll one way
they will another. I have noticed lately that Missis
Tempe has got the kink into her head of hanging
round her mother, but it seems to make no difference
to her. What are we coming to, if that woman
is going to sit in the shadow of darkness forever
and 'ternally?"</p>

<p>Sebastian's head drooped; he sighed and muttered:</p>

<p>"Roxalana's feelings are immortal; mine are&mdash;
for the future; the past recedes like a mirage when
I endeavor to reach it. Even now, that child-angel
fades like the crescent moon vanishing in
sunrise&mdash;a silver, impalpable shadow. Bah! Chloe,
it grows into your chilly season so fast; the wild
red leaves are blowing from the trees again, and
the air bites me&mdash;but sweetly."</p>

<p>"Bites? Mr. Sebastian, try a hair of the same
dog that bites the Gates folks; then you'll never be
chilly, nor hungry, and you won't ask any more
questions."</p>

<p>"I have become so solitary," he continued,
looking into himself, and forgetful of Chloe, "that
Roxalana and Tempe together, in some incomprehensible
communion, make my sensations chime
like a bell, one against another. Do beings die to
change life for others? Does death open avenues
for one to start from? Saints! and especially the
hermit saints! My solitude grows reverberating!
The sand which rolls and slides, grain by grain, at
last chokes the channel, and the tide boils in fury
over. And the dead wedge when driven into the
live tree divides, and crushes it. I think life here
already differs, even with the unchanging Argus,
yet what can <i>he</i> do? For the matter of that, what
can I? What if I try once more the old scenery?
Bah! the lights are out, the ballet has taken off its
spangles; besides, I can not leave. No, I am
bound&mdash;twice, thrice bound to this spot."</p>

<p>He struck the floor with his boot, looked out of
his intense pupils at Chloe, who had indifferently
resumed her occupation, and whirled round to hasten
into Roxalana's presence again.</p>

<p>"My soul," thought Chloe, "when his eyes are
fixed so, like coals lighted, he is the image of Judas
in Mr. Brande's picture of the Lord's Supper,
which an agent brought round. I must say, Judas
was a very handsome apostle. I remember that
Mr. Brande said at the time that he had bought
the picture to head the list in Kent, but that it was
an impious thing to attempt the portrait of Jesus
Christ; it was not for sinful man to imagine him
looking like a man. And Virginia said&mdash;well, I
don't remember what she did say, but he lectured
her half an hour. Plague on this little spider-legged
pitcher, the silver is so thin and worn I
could prick it through and through with a pin."</p>

<p>"Roxalana," cried Sebastian, standing before
her, "I want you. Come from that dark underworld.
I have lost hold of the anchors of Temple
House; where are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sebastian," she answered, raising her
heavy eyes, "I am here, what will you have?"</p>

<p>"You do not attend to what I say. I want you,
my friend; give me my tranquillity, which is leaving
me."</p>

<p>"I asked what you would have. Get up,
Tempe."</p>

<p>Tempe obeyed, and sank upon a seat by the window.
Sebastian took her place.</p>

<p>"I perceive," he whispered, "that she clings to
you. Is it any temptation for you to love life
again?"</p>

<p>Roxalana looked round at Tempe reflectively,
and a shade of surprise came into her face.</p>

<p>"Nothing tempts me," she replied. "I do not
wish to be tempted."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, yet I shall be; when the necessity
of being tempted exists in one, temptation approaches."</p>

<p>"Resistance then is in vain," she said, interested
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"With me it is. The senses are plumed for
flight; when the breeze fans them they must
ascend."</p>

<p>"Resist temptation and it will flee from you,"
she quoted, looking absent again. "I have not
looked into the Bible much since I lived with papa."</p>

<p>"Is there a Bible in this house?" said Tempe,
with closed eyes, as if she were speaking in a
dream. "Grandpa used to quote that when I cried
for his lizards, and sea-horses, and plums."</p>

<p>Roxalana's face flushed deeply and painfully;
she had never heard Tempe refer to those early
days, so long buried in her own mind that they
were never recalled. Was Tempe teaching her?</p>

<p>"And so you remember those things, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and more. I could have had them all,
you know, but I never did yield to but one temptation,
mother&mdash;my evil disposition,&mdash;one of that
fine flock of the senses Sebastian speaks of. I
suppose there may have been one more temptation
which I gave in to, but I shall not mention it."</p>

<p>There was defiance in her tone.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes, Tempe, for God's sake!" exclaimed
Sebastian. "I do not like statues with
voices."</p>

<p>"Poor statues! But statues are eyeless; I can't
open my eyes; they see nothing when they unclose."</p>

<p>Roxalana looked pitifully at him, as if she would
have him excuse Tempe.</p>

<p>"Don't resist me," he begged. "Roxalana, it
was your calm, cheerful philosophy, as well as the
friendship of Argus, that gave the bloom to my
life again, which more than the waves of Kent bay
washed off. See, I am only thirty years old;
am I to have no reward for adding my years to the
years under this roof? Have you thought how
strong and skillful must be the wall which a man
like me must build between himself and the storms
of the passions. Before you and Argus they must
not break in. Look at me."</p>

<p>She obeyed him, and laid her hand gently on
his shoulder, for he was kneeling beside her like a
child.</p>

<p>Tempe shuddered as if she were in an ague;&mdash;
they had forgotten her! Why should she <i>ever</i> open
her eyes? Why not fall out of the high window,
and disappear with other miserable atoms of dust
beneath it?</p>

<p>"Look into my face," continued Sebastian. "Do
you believe me as incredibly simple as yourself?
And yet you must, for you accept the strange
beings round you for just what they appear. Let
me ask, though, once more, if I may not be yours?
'<i>The blow</i>.' you say. I know that, but the <i>other</i>
blows,&mdash;can you stand against those?"</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, but there was no light
in her countenance.</p>

<p>"Begin, dear," he went on, "to hide the bruise
in your heart. Alas, we must have refuge, and be
healed. Now Argus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Argus," she interrupted reproachfully; "how
is Argus? I shall never know till I ask him, and
then he will make merry."</p>

<p>"Argus is well," exclaimed Tempe, "he is on the
lawn, knocking the ashes from the end of his cigar,
with the same equanimity that he formerly knocked
sailors overboard. Don't trouble yourself about
Argus, mother; the air and a loaf of bread, his
cigar and the bench under the elms, suffice the
wants of that lofty iceberg. Why he ever drifted
into this climate is as much of a mystery as some
other driftings are."</p>

<p>But Roxalana did look troubled; she went to the
window and looked at Argus steadfastly. He was
the picture of indifference and laziness; his legs
were crossed, his shoulders slouched, and he puffed
his cigar slowly, as if it were one of the last efforts
he might be expected to make.</p>

<p>"That man," she said, with some animation, "is
dressed in a nankin suit, and it is October&mdash;does
he know it?" She sighed, and turned back.
"What were you about to say, Sebastian? I can
guess, though, but I believe you may be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Would he speak to you as I have spoken?"</p>

<p>"He never demands anything."</p>

<p>"It is only a Spanish fashion to demand," Tempe
remarked; "the Gates family neither demand, nor
require anything."</p>

<p>Sebastian made an abrupt movement towards her
and retreated. "The little puss stretches out her
claws once more," he said.</p>

<p>"Tempe, can't you hold your tongue?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"I can," she answered, "but have no idea of
doing so."</p>

<p>"I meant at first to say, Roxalana," continued
Sebastian, "that Argus ignores what we call the
inner voice; consequently he is able to notice no
correspondence between that and the voices from
the life around him; he chooses to suffer and enjoy
on another basis."</p>

<p>She shook her head, and doubtfully twisted her
hands.</p>

<p>"The <i>inner voice</i>," she repeated, "what is it? If
there were no pressure from the external, should
we ever hear it? I never do, in any event. I hope
you understand Argus. He is a peculiar man&mdash;entirely
different from you, Sebastian; I am glad
of it, for your sake. Go out to him; he has been
alone some time."</p>

<p>Sebastian instantly left her. As soon as he shut
the door Tempe opened it again, and followed him
to the lawn, and Roxalana was alone. In a few minutes
she went to the window, and contemplated the
group under the elms. Tempe, her arms hid under
a shawl, sat at the end of a bench, meditating on
the tree-tops, or watching the atmosphere, for her
head was cast upwards, and her eyes roved. Sebastian
was smoking beside Argus, who remained in
the same position as when she looked at him
before.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun, dipping over the lawn, tinged
the fading grass, and the brown leaves scattered
over it, with a yellow light; the pale, blue sky was
cloudless, and the motionless elms stood against it,
still green, though their leaves fell constantly,
shattered at heart by the poison of decay. A distant
bell, from some belfry in the town, was ringing.
It was as if a moment had arrived when the
mind might rouse from the natural reflection mirrored
there by the spirit of autumn, that man and
his belongings are eternally vanishing,&mdash;sinking behind
a dark horizon,&mdash;the mysterious boundary of
his mind, beyond which lie visions&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>A flood swelled up from Roxalana's breast, and
broke into tears which blistered her eyelids; sobs
sounding like the growl of an animal at bay, stifled
and stopped her breath. Still she kept her eyes
wide open upon the scene before the window,&mdash;half
thinking out her struggle, half allowing it to work
out by its own law. It had come to her that
day, and Sebastian's appearance and words had
strengthened the idea,&mdash;that the capacity of choosing
her old life must now be made possible. To
do so, however, the chain of memory and association
which bound her must be broken; the dead,
a reproach to her springs of being, could not
exist with the living, and her faith and enjoyment
in them. Which should she choose? Take up
life, and live resolutely, with freedom? Or should
she fear and despise it, keeping her heart at the
gates of loss and annihilation?</p>

<p>It appeared as if the group on the lawn were
waiting for her pending decision, they remained so
fixed and silent. The sun sank below the garden
wall; the sky changed; red and purple vapor,
rough like surf, and peaked like a mountain chain,
rose round it; a swift wind swept over the bay,
bringing the noise of the tide into the elms, whose
boughs were suddenly and wildly shaken. Some
autumn birds, joyous in the great scene above,
below, the hemisphere of fiery, heaping, driving
cloud and rushing air, and the hemisphere of swaying
forests, the dark rolling bay, town, hill, and
fields&mdash;flew overhead with a loud twitter. Tempe
followed their flight, and Roxalana, still watching,
involuntarily raised her head also. With that
strange superstition which belongs to naturally
faithless natures, she instantly believed that the
birds were bearing her troubles away. The struggle
was over. Pale, and with an uncertain gait,
she went out to join those with whom she had taken
lot again, to do, or say&mdash;she knew not what.
Sebastian rose in astonishment when he saw her
coming down the steps, bareheaded and smiling;
but Argus, who knew her so well, only half turned
his face towards her.</p>

<p>"I notice those birds," she said; "have they
not colonized in the poplars?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Argus; "they were a belated
party, and do not belong here."</p>

<p>"Which way is the wind?"</p>

<p>"As if you didn't know, mother," said Tempe,
looking at her with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Can't you let your mother ask whatever question
she pleases?" said Argus. "The wind shall
be which way you please, Roxalana, but it will
blow to-night, and I doubt whether we have many
leaves to sit under after this."</p>

<p>She looked up into the elms, and an expression
of the old content came into her voice.</p>

<p>"How beautiful they still are!" she said.</p>

<p>The tone of her fine voice struck Argus; how
should <i>he</i> pass back, and live over the days when
that tone was habitual with her?</p>

<p>Sebastian took her hand, and drew her down the
path.</p>

<p>"When have you looked over the gate?" he said,
thanking her with his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mother," called Tempe, "you are bareheaded
and beyond the trees; you will feel the wind."</p>

<p>Roxalana put her hand to her head.</p>

<p>"So I am, Sebastian."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Roxalana, I see now that your
hair is gray."</p>

<p>"But yours is not."</p>

<p>"Give me your shawl, Tempe," said Argus; "I
will take it to her. Now run into the house; let
me see two miracles to-day."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Water turned to wine."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, uncle Argus. But how funny,&mdash;this
is the second time I have heard something from
the Bible to-day."</p>

<p>"Trollop, you ought to keep one under your
pillow, and read it every night. What did you
hear?"</p>

<p>"'Resist temptation, and it will flee from you.'
Do you read the Bible in your bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Who is tempted?"</p>

<p>"Nobody now, but somebody will be."</p>

<p>"The child begins to feel the pangs of experience!
Run into the house; your hair will blow
away."</p>

<p>"I wish it would blow through my head; a current
of cool air, uncle Argus, intersecting it, would
be an advantage; but I suppose I may not expect
anything to penetrate it."</p>

<p>He gave her a curious look.</p>

<p>"How would you like a surprise, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am surprised."</p>

<p>"At what?"</p>

<p>With a timid gesture, she pointed at Sebastian.
Argus meditated a moment, and then said
sharply:</p>

<p>"There is nothing to surprise in him, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"I know better; he is full of those instincts you
know nothing about."</p>

<p>"Gracious Peter!"</p>

<p>"You may give one of your round-the-world
laughs or sneers, it will still be the same with me;
I feel an energy from him to-day, I am in a savage
sympathy with him, and I should like to pain him
too."</p>

<p>"Go in."</p>

<p>"So I will, when I get ready."</p>

<p>"There's malaria somewhere round us; we are
getting upside down. It is the style of his face
makes you think so; the Spaniard inevitably suggests
love and revenge, but there is nothing of the
sort in Sebastian. I wish you would let me alone,"
replied Argus, a little confused.</p>

<p>"The man shall love me," said Tempe haughtily,
rising, and moving towards the house; and Argus
went to the gate with an anger he had never felt
against Tempe till now.</p>

<p>"You had better go in, and take a romantic view
with Chloe regarding the tea-table. You are a
froward child."</p>

<p>He called to Roxalana: "Tea is waiting!"</p>

<p>"Let it wait," she answered.</p>

<p>Argus exchanged a look with Sebastian who
nodded gravely, and made a gesture signifying
gratitude for the change in her.</p>

<p>"By heaven," said Argus, "I am sure the kitchen
chimney smokes."</p>

<p>"It does not; it never did," she replied; "let us
go in then, and see about the fire."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>MAT SUTCLIFFE, while busy in the garden,
digging round the old rose-trees, and clearing
out the rubbish in the thicket, saw Argus, with
his trowsers in his boots, and wearing the sealskin
cap, advancing along the path which led to the
summer-house; he carried a cane, and stopped
occasionally to turn up the leafy moss, and tap the
tree trunks, as if he was seeking some hidden
thing. Instead of going into the summer-house,
however, he walked several times round it, and
carefully beat off the few shaking leaves on the
grapevine. Mat, without any reason for so doing,
slipped to the back of the thicket to conceal himself.
When Argus finished his exercise with the
cane, he threw it into the summer-house, folded
his arms, and, as it appeared to Mat, earnestly
studied the weather-vane, which creaked slightly.
He stood so long there that Mat made up his mind
that he had better attend to his business, and was
about to confront Argus, but did not, for he suddenly
went through the poplars, climbed the wall
behind them, and disappeared. The day was
damp and chilly; a dull wind crept like a serpent
over the ground, as if crowded down by the low,
heavy sky; the gray grass shook under it, and the
tall weeds, full of dry seeds, rasped against the
stone walls to a dismal tune; the water along the
shore tumbled and roared beside it, without breaking
into waves or surf. "A beautiful morning,"
Mat thought, "to be caning about the country."
And he fell to work again; but overcome by an inclination
for reflection, he sat down on his wheel-barrow
and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>"What can be in the wind with Gates?" he
queried. "He goes from post to pillar, as if he
remembered something he had forgot, and from
pillar to post, as if he couldn't find it. He passes
all my calerlations, the Capen does, nowadays,
blarsted if he don't. That ere iron constitution of
his can't be breaking up, can it, and he won't own
it? You see in former times his life <i>was</i> different,
it raly was; and 'tis said, but I know it to be a
lie,&mdash;that murder will out. It is my opinion that
Gates never had anything he wanted,&mdash;nor ever
did anything he wanted to do,&mdash;except draw his
breath, and keep cool; and that even in the days
he gambled, and drank, and what not, because he
was in Gambleland. I guess I'll speak to my old
woman about this ere matter. I actilly don't know
what to make out. Who's in it? Not Mr. Ford.
Is it Roxalana Gates's dreadful dumps? Poor,
feeble Tempe? 'Taint Miss Virginia Brande!
Damn me if I didn't see that Carfield in the street
yesterday! He has come back."</p>

<p>He started up with the intention of going home,
but on reaching the alley door changed his mind,
and went back to work.</p>

<p>It was true, as Roxalana had said, that Argus
made no demands; but it was also true that she was
the prop of his obvious life, and that her lethargic,
obdurate grief had destroyed it. The glacier at
last rolls into the valley, and reveals the skeleton it
has held together so many years. This chosen life,
which Argus conducted as intact and unalienable
in the atmosphere of Temple House, was breaking
up and melting away; the change in Roxalana had
revealed the shifting possibilities of every circumstance
about him. Knowing in his consciousness
what would best suit him, had he a choice in the
future&mdash;to be alone in his own domain, and without
intimate connection with any human being&mdash;he
yet deliberately set to work upon those problems
hitherto set aside, in the faith that they
must work out themselves. He grew harder,
colder, quieter during the process; but men may
come and men may go through the mazes of perplexity
a long time, and the commonplace still flow
round them. If Sebastian perceived any difference
in him, he ascribed it to the general difference
which had touched them all. It was several weeks
before the acute Mat decided that there really was
something doubtful about the Capen.</p>

<p>Argus contemplated Sebastian's friendship, Virginia's
love, Tempe's difficult future, and Roxalana's
sad, dull old age. Should he sell the estate,
and with the money settle Roxalana in a new, and
perhaps, so far as Tempe was concerned, a wise
position? Persuade Sebastian to leave the country,
go with him, and never return? Should he
defy Brande and Carfield, and take Virginia? The
former could trouble him but little; but how about
the latter? Her love would still be a glittering
net; let him turn in any direction, he would feel its
meshes. He set aside her beauty, sweetness, and
power&mdash;for he was adamant&mdash;the instincts which
made him a man, and shut his eyes upon that selfishness
which might calculate her as the companion
and friend of his lonely age, and pondered
over one characteristic,&mdash;that which made him remarkable&mdash;his
secretive, impassive individuality,&mdash;whether
he had better live on it, as his substance,
or share it with Virginia, to her advantage and
his happiness.</p>

<p>On the morning when he came under Mat Sutcliffe's
observation, he had decided that he would
marry her&mdash;and immediately. The next day, while
possessed with his plans, and smoking on the lawn,
in the warmth and stillness of that beautiful October
afternoon, Roxalana went out to him, having
passed through the valley of the shadow of death
to resume her sway. He was not the man, however,
to change a purpose. That very evening
he looked up Mat Sutcliffe, and asked him to
take a note to the Forge.<p>

<p>"Is anybody sick at your house?" Mat inquired,
jamming down his tarpaulin.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, deadly sick&mdash;love-sick."

<p>"Oh, indeed, to be sure you are now. What am
I going arter, nails?"</p>

<p>"You are going after my wife."</p>

<p>"Now don't bust me! Bah, as I think on't
Martha, the housekeeper, is just about your
age."</p>

<p>"Get out. I'll be on the path in an hour for
my answer."</p>

<p>Mat put the note in his pocket, some tobacco in
his mouth, and started, saying that he was mortally
afeard of Brande's bull-dog.</p>

<p>"Kill him," said Argus, "and any other beast
that interferes with you."</p>

<p>"Just so, now I know you are in earnest; but
hadn't you better go below, Capen?"</p>

<p>Argus laughed, and bade him go on.</p>

<p>The note contained these words:</p>

<p>"If you are ready, my dearest, shall we now be
married? If you are, when can I confer with
your father? If you have not changed&mdash;recollect
how little we have seen each other of late&mdash;I love
you; if you have changed, I love you. My flames
may not burn as yours, so prettily, so lambent&mdash;that
you know; still I am on fire, and fire under
ice is terrible to the one burned between them. I
am at your service; make it a long expiation of
desire and duty. Come and live with me, Virginia;
please, my dear.</p>

<p>"Argus, your Husband."</p>

<p>Mat was clever enough to insist upon handing
the note himself to Virginia, and stupid enough to
follow Sarah into the parlor with it. It is certain
he blushed, and got very much entangled in his
ideas, when he saw not only Virginia, but her
father and Mr. Carfield in the parlor. He sat
down without being asked to do so, put his hat
under his chair, and twisted his thumbs desperately,
and then said nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, Mat," said Virginia, somewhat disappointed
in his bearing, for he was a favorite with her,
"you have brought me a message?"</p>

<p>"A billet, Miss Brande," he answered, his coolness,
true Yankee that he was, instantly returning.
"I accommodated a friend by bringing it. An
answer is expected."</p>

<p>"Is anything amiss your way?" asked Mr.
Brande.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Temple House not tumbled down yet?"
asked Mr. Carfield, with his eye on Virginia.</p>

<p>"I left the family all right, sir, with their best
foot foremost. That ere house is equal to some of
the palaces I saw up the Thames a number of years
ago. What is the name of that plant that has
yaller flowers, growing out of the cracks in the
walls?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield did not deign to answer him, but
Mat was quite indifferent about a reply; he meant
to distract attention from Virginia, whose countenance
had changed to extreme paleness.</p>

<p>"Do your beams and timbers get the dry-rot,
here," he went on, loudening his voice, "as ours
do? I suppose I could shake out a bushel of
powder from the stanchions in the garret at Temple
House,&mdash;a bushel to say the least, a bushel!"</p>

<p>He raised his voice so high with the last word,
that Mr. Brande, who was reading, turned in surprise,
and following the direction of his eyes, saw
Virginia's agitation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, daughter?" he said,
rising and going to her.</p>

<p>"Mat," said Virginia hastily, "I will not trouble
you to wait, I will send an answer to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mat remembered that Argus would be waiting
for him, and expecting something more positive.
What could he invent to bring it about? He had
not been in contact with the dog, but he was sure
he was in the presence of the beast Argus hinted at.</p>

<p>"She ain't expected to live. Miss Tempe ain't,"
he said, desperately, "and I am sure that Mrs.
Gates won't like to wait till to-morrow. I'll stay
till you've made up your mind to write." Mr. Carfield
laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"I saw your friend. Miss Tempe, this morning,"
he said, "and I thought there was quite a bloom
on her cheek."</p>

<p>The blood rose to the roots of Mat's hair.
Where could that man have seen Tempe? Not
many hours should pass, he vowed, before he would
see Roxalana Gates, and tell her she was a criminal
for keeping her eyes shut to the going on of those
in whom she should have an anxious concern.</p>

<p>"She may be the worse for that," he answered
hotly.</p>

<p>"No, Mat," said Virginia, "I prefer that you
should not wait. I shall send a note to Temple
House early in the morning."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, miss," he replied, picking up
his hat.</p>

<p>She made a half attempt, in her kindness, to go
towards him, meaning, possibly, to exchange a word
or a significant look with him from behind the bars
of her cage; but she was prevented, for Mr. Carfield
walked across the floor, eyeing the door, and
Mat in a rage went out.</p>

<p>"She is afraid," he said to himself outside. "I
wouldn't be in that woman's shoes for one hundred
dollars,&mdash;no, nor two."</p>

<p>He met Argus half-way up the path.</p>

<p>"You have been gone a devil of a time."</p>

<p>"I might have stayed longer, just as well one
way as another; there's no answer for you this
night, Capen."</p>

<p>"No? Why not?"</p>

<p>"She has no will of her own. Mr. Brande and
piety was together, and that ere Carfield might be
considered as thrown in."</p>

<p>"You gave my note to her before those gentlemen,
did you!"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, and put my foot in it handsome."</p>

<p>"They have both read it before this."</p>

<p>Argus stopped, and looked back towards the
Forge.</p>

<p>"Take the advice of a booby, and keep right
along the path with me; the poor girl was flustered
enough for to-night a-reading your billet; didn't
know you could do such a thing. You'll never get
her away by fair means. Carfield is a trump&mdash;for
having his own way&mdash;they say this time he will
fetch it, and marry her."</p>

<p>Argus's step grew irresolute again. "I'll go
back and take her to-night."</p>

<p>"Come on, Capen, it is darker behind you than
it is before you. Brande is cunning, and the other
chap is bold; you ain't a match for them."</p>

<p>"I only wish to be a match for Miss Brande."</p>

<p>"Well, now, do you want me to tell you how it
can be done?"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Run away with her."</p>

<p>"Pooh!"</p>

<p>"When I say run, I mean ask her to have you
unbeknown."</p>

<p>Argus was struck with the idea. Much trouble
might be avoided by such a measure, and he meekly
asked how such a thing could be done.</p>

<p>"With ten dollars, and old Squire Perkins."</p>

<p>"I will think of it," said Argus, after a long
pause. "I think I am growing brainless, for I
begin to be afraid, and I dread meeting with familiar
things. I am miserable in looking for the
unknown."</p>

<p>"Capen, if I could only bring Mis Roxalana
round,&mdash;this ere event of yours, it will pay, and she
is fond of Miss Virginia. Go right in, Capen, and
smoke over it. Here's to ye."</p>

<p>Argus went home without another word, and
Mat, in his excitement, sat up with the big rummer
and his pipe till Mary's snoring assured him he
should keep from telling her, that night, at least.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" Mr. Brande repeated,
when Mat had gone. Virginia was at her wit's end
for a reply. Would nothing come to her aid, to
save Argus from shame?</p>

<p>"Have I returned to find melodrama?" said
Mr. Carfield harshly.</p>

<p>"Melodrama in a Christian woman!" said Mr.
Brande. "Give me the note."</p>

<p>Virginia crushed it in her hand, but retained it.</p>

<p>"I repeat," he said, shaking his handkerchief as
if it were a net, "give me the note, or answer my
question, daughter."</p>

<p>She looked at him beseechingly. A shade of
annoyance passed over his shining face; that she
should be embarrassed before Mr. Carfield stung
his pride.</p>

<p>"Girls will be girls," he said, looking at Mr. Carfield;
"that preposterous Temple Drake has sent
some nonsensical message. The name of Gates I
despise, except, perhaps, in the case of Argus."</p>

<p>"And why not him?" asked Mr. Carfield. "I
think him an out-of-the-way ass. He intends at
last to marry Virginia. Her face says so."</p>

<p>"I,&mdash;I do not believe you," she said, turning
paler. "How can my face express what I do not
know?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Mr. Brande.</p>

<p>"Before your father, then, once more, Virginia,
I ask you to accept me as your husband," cried
Mr. Carfield.</p>

<p>"Virginia," said her father gravely, "you are
compromised. You are as well aware of the fact
as I am that all Kent knows that Mr. Carfield has
lived in my house with the intention of marrying
you. I have given our friends reason to believe
that he is agreeable to us. I desire you to accept
Mr. Carfield. The voice of nature demands it&mdash;the
ties of property, our business, my welfare. Don't
bring any disgrace on me, daughter."</p>

<p>She thrust the note inside her bodice, with a
strange look at Mr. Carfield.</p>

<p>"Take it away from there, the cursed thing," he
said fiercely; "I won't have it so."</p>

<p>"Give me a little time, father," she said, putting
her hand against her breast, with a gesture which
made Mr. Carfield bite his lips; "and excuse me
now, I will consider your wishes."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande waved his consent to her leaving the
room; he was reading his partner like a book, and
thought it time for her to go.</p>

<p>"Now," he mused, "why am I not like this man?
I envy him, I believe he is a frank scoundrel."</p>

<p>He turned very suddenly and quietly, looked
Mr. Carfield directly in the eyes; and then as
quietly rubbed his smooth jaws, to look into the
fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield smiled, and thought that he could
account for Virginia's timidity.</p>

<p>"Brande," he said, "I do want her; but how
far do you think a fellow may descend in such a
pursuit?"</p>

<p>"How far have you gone?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to compel her to marry me, for I
feel almost certain that Argus Gates stands in my
way. For more than a year I have been playing
this interesting game, and all I have gained is her
irresolution. Did you ever lose anything you were
terribly in earnest to get, Brande?"</p>

<p>"I think I have generally gained my objects, but
I have never been so very much in earnest. As for
my daughter, I know, of course, her strong attachment
for that Gates family; I can only believe that
Argus is but a part of it. I think she is an obedient
girl, and that her nature is a pliable one. I
wish her to marry you; she will be happy in so doing.
What more can she ask for than to continue
her placid, prosperous life?"</p>

<p>"She asks for all her beauty demands, and she
should have it; it is the purpose of my life to make
her own that I can give it to her."</p>

<p>"You must be infatuated," stammered Mr.
Brande, "to speak to me so. I&mdash;I should like to
reprove you: it would not become me, perhaps, to
do so, but I think it would be right."</p>

<p>"What is the price of your daughter? Did I pay
it for the Forge&mdash;for my friendship with you? I
bought <i>her</i>. She knows it."</p>

<p>"She knows that I want her to marry you, and
that is enough. If it pleases your taste to call it a
matter of selfish business, do so, but let the affair
be conducted decently, for heaven's sake, Carfield.
Your youthful rashness is unpardonable."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i> a 'rash youth,' Brande? I am sure that you
know the devil must make a horrible grimace
when you are offered him to swallow. Surely you
are man enough to admit that the devil may have
a choice among his pious tid-bits, as it was the
choice of Christ to allow the publicans to enter
heaven before the Pharisees."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I admit everything; but isn't it
rather late? Recollect, we have to ride thirty
miles to-morrow."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;about those shares; don't sit up then.
I have still a little reading to do. By the way. I'll
overlook your wish&mdash;to reprove me, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande smiled faintly, and said it was difficult
for him to forget his old-fashioned prejudices.
But, on his way to his bedroom, he asked himself
how it was that the circumstances of Virginia's life
should have brought so bold and passionate a man
as Carfield to her feet, while he, in all his years,
had never been tempted by one whose power might
have shaken his resolves.</p>

<p>When Virginia sat down before her dressing-table
she read the note Argus had written; then
she was foolish enough to kiss it, and put it under
her pillow. Letting down her hair, she thought
that she would think, while undressing, of the
course best to pursue with Argus, her father, and
Mr. Carfield; but the operation was over, her
hair carefully braided in heavy bands, before she
had thought of anything,&mdash;except the happiness
she should feel if Argus were with her at that
moment, watching her with that gentle coldness
which was a mystery and fascination to her. She
concluded that her mind would better collect itself
in bed and the dark, for of course something
must be planned, and accordingly put out her light
and went to bed. But the darkness proved oppressive;
besides, she wanted to read the note
once more; therefore she rose, relighted her lamp,
put on a dressing-gown, and sat down in a severe
manner to reflect. It was dreary to begin her
theme with the sacrifice of inclination, but she did.
The night grew colder, as if divesting itself of the
heat and perturbation of the day. Its deepening
solitude toned her mind to a lofty key; thought
and feeling hand in hand, like innocent and affectionate
spirits, ascended to the throne, where, as she
believed, the Ruler of the universe was waiting to
hear the petitions of souls against those fiats which
the soul itself issues in favor of the subtle martyrdoms
which decorates life with its crown and thorns.
With the abnegation inherent in her character, and
its narrowness, which prevented her from looking
at final effects, she decided upon giving up
Argus, although she felt acutely that her acts laid
bare her purpose of bringing him to the point,
which, at last, his note declared. To the end
would she live with her father; their house should
not be divided because of her conduct. With a
loud, wild, farewell sigh to Argus, she pulled aside
the curtain to look into the wide air, and feel the
mercy of darkness. A band of stars rode high and
clear above a company of moving clouds, spreading
in the reflection of the moon, thin and white,
like flakes of snow. Earth, a black, tranquil monster,
was now passive beneath the beautiful illusions
of moonlight. The life which by day forever enacted
scenes of pain was invisible. Yet she must
not call it pain, nor evil&mdash;its passing drama&mdash;but
necessary discipline, and inscrutable wisdom. The
sword that stabbed was rubbed with healing balm:
the disappointment that seemed to blight contained
the germ of development. Filled with the calm
which she felt was that of another world, she drew
the curtain, and was about to advance into the
room, when a slight sound at the door arrested
her; the handle turned slowly and noiselessly.
The door opened, and Mr. Carfield glided through,
shut it, and locked it.</p>

<p>As he did not expect, he saw the lamp burning,
and Virginia standing before him, rigid, white,
silent, her hair braided like a child's behind her
ears, and enveloped from head to foot in a dressing-gown!</p>

<p>"Why are you still up?" he asked mechanically.</p>

<p>A revulsion of feeling took place at the sound of
his voice, which undid all the process and result
she had just completed; the cause of her father
fell in ruins, so far as the implication of Mr. Carfield
stood. The blood roared in her veins, which
just now beat evenly with victorious spiritual
peace; he saw it rise to cheek and brow, till her
eyes, the dark, perfect eyes he doted on, were filled
with fiery light. She did not speak, while calculating
the distance between herself and the door
behind her, which was Sarah's room; she wondered
if she could get there before he could intercept
her; but her moral cowardice was great; the idea
of the servants knowing his shameful behavior
was one she could not endure. She was sure that
in twenty-four hours, were they to know it, it would
be known in Kent. Mr. Carfield divined her first
thought.</p>

<p>"There can be no communication between you
and Sarah just yet," he said. "What do you think
I am in your chamber for?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders with an ineffable
scorn.</p>

<p>"How many times do you suppose I have waited
outside your door, believing that some fate would
send you to open it and find me,&mdash;lying across the
threshold?"</p>

<p>Oh, what a life was hers! Better the old days of
dread and watching, than a prison like this!</p>

<p>"Your father must have seen me there."</p>

<p>"No, no,&mdash;you shall not lie."</p>

<p>He sprang towards her, pinioned her in his arms,
and fell then down at her feet in terrible agitation.</p>

<p>"I have come," he said, in a broken voice, "to
say that you must no longer resist me; the approach
of that man must be prevented. Have I no power
over you, at this moment, Virginia&mdash;<i>this</i> moment?"</p>

<p>She tried in vain to retreat from him, but could
not move, for he was kneeling on the border of her
dress.</p>

<p>"An impulse brings me to you," he continued,
"which you do not know, yet which you shall
understand. Virginia, I must be yours; give
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He raised his face, and she looked down at him.
His mad, beseeching eyes, his open lips and violent
breath carried to her sad soul the conviction
that it was her destiny to be the witness of, and a
party in, scenes the knowledge of which must be
a condemning barrier between her and the women
who peopled the world, and who governed it. She
would have escaped from him upon his entrance
into the room, but it had not occurred to her to be
afraid of him; and now it did not occur to her
that at her feet was a handsome, passionate lover,
the man, too, chosen for her husband by everybody,
excepting herself and Argus. Meeting her
eyes, he could not help being touched by the cold,
silent misery in her face; then he grew exasperated.</p>

<p>"I will injure you beyond all repair," he said,
rising suddenly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>"Since you spoke to me of Argus Gates, I believed
that you felt for him only a caprice, base in
its aims; I know better now. You are simply like
other women. So, you are not afraid of me?"</p>

<p>"Afraid! No; of what should I be afraid?"</p>

<p>"The newspapers have names for it, invented
mostly by your sex."</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered, and spoke passionately:</p>

<p>"Even acquaintance with you shall end; my
father must at once decide which of us shall leave
his house. Will you go, or need I tell him this
cruel interview?"</p>

<p>"He will not decide as you wish, even if you tell
him the story of to-night; <i>that</i> is not ended."</p>

<p>"Are you ever going? You are as tiresome as
you are brutal. Go out, Mr. Carfield."</p>

<p>He could have struck her and kissed her till she
bled, so blended were his hate and admiration.
Snatching a knot of ribbon from her dress, he
turned and left the room.</p>

<p>She felt that she should go mad if she did not
sleep, and threw herself on her bed, where Sarah
found her at breakfast time.</p>

<p>"Miss Virginia," said Sarah significantly, "you
look beat out, tired to death."</p>

<p>"Do I?" she answered, starting up, and looking
at the girl intently.</p>

<p>The secret of last night was not confined to herself
and Mr. Carfield! The battle was opened.
"Oh, for my Chloe!" she thought. The note under
her pillow, which she had forgotten so long, came
to her,&mdash;a flash of joy.</p>

<p>"I shall be down presently, Sarah; you need not
wait."</p>

<p>"The gentlemen rode away two hours ago. They
left their love for you."</p>

<p>Sarah gone, she looked for the note; that was
gone also.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

</div>

<p>VIRGINIA decided upon going into town immediately,
and conferring with Mat Sutcliffe
about meeting Argus privately, but was prevented
from doing so by the arrival of Tempe Drake, who
said that the imperative wish of her Uncle Argus
had sent her; that having reached the house she
would probably never be able to leave it. Producing
a second note, she asked Virginia if she would have
it framed, as it must be the first he had ever written
to a lady. Virginia blushed, and looked so
conscious when she took it that Tempe exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that Uncle Socrates is
in the habit of inditing notes to you?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say nothing about it," answered
Virginia, with vexation, and reading with an assumption
of carelessness the note. "I only wait to
know," wrote Argus, "your wishes; but, if I were
you, I should send by Tempe the following message,
'Everything shall be according to your wishes.'"
This was all. She said at once to Tempe: "You
may tell Captain Gates, Tempe, that everything
shall be as he wishes."</p>

<p>"That will be nothing new for him; but as I
told you, I am going to spend the day here. I feel
stronger for coming. Virginia, I am really glad to
see you."</p>

<p>"Are you, my dear? Do stay then. How is
Roxalana?"</p>

<p>"She is like her old self, this morning she spoke
to us all; but I am not like my old self."</p>

<p>"You are prettier," said Virginia, smiling.</p>

<p>"And I am more gentle."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Don't dream, Virginia; talk to me."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Why, here's Sarah with another note; it looks
bed-ridden, though."</p>

<p>"I found this. Miss Virginia," said Sarah, "on
the floor, at the head of your bed."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Virginia, with another conscious
look at Tempe. "I am glad we shall be
alone to-day, Tempe," she exclaimed, when Sarah
was gone. "Father and Mr. Carfield are away on
business."</p>

<p>"Do you know that I have not been to the
Forge since you wrote me about your mother's
death?"</p>

<p>"I know it, Tempe."</p>

<p>"What made you shut yourself up for so many
weeks? And why didn't you put on mourning?
Chloe said no one out of the house saw you for the
whole summer, and that she heard at meeting that
it was Mr. Brande's wish, having made it a matter
of prayer, that you should not wear black. Is this
true? I have had my own troubles, you know,
or I should not venture to speak so plainly."</p>

<p>"It is all true, Tempe. Many months flew away
in sad nothingness with me. I cannot account for
the time now. I am sure I shall never have such
days again; they began, do you remember, from
the very night I took tea at your house, when Mr.
Carfield came for me. He went away immediately
afterwards; now that I think of it, his coming and
going were the dates of that period, especially with
father; and so we glided along."</p>

<p>"His coming and going&mdash;Mr. Carfield, I mean&mdash;delayed
your marriage, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," said Virginia, taken by surprise,
"I shall not marry him."</p>

<p>"Not when he has lived here nearly two years,
and traveled about everywhere with the behavior
of an engaged man? I am afraid you are a coquette,
or that you don't know your own mind.
Perhaps it will suffice, though, if <i>he</i> knows his
mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tempe, don't be bitter with me."</p>

<p>"Me! There is not bitterness enough in me to
make a quinine pill. But you have a right to coquette,
and to dally. You are rich, and your own
mistress."</p>

<p>"Stupid, blind friend, I am neither."</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Virginia, I am growing bright every
day. You mustn't be surprised at bursts of knowledge
in me at any time; I feel them coming,
I do, I assure you. <i>I am being taught at last</i> what
life is,&mdash;when one ceases to be an infant. For
heaven's sake tell me what this torrent of tears
means. I never saw you cry; have you soul then?&mdash;placid,
fair, beautiful Virginia, need I no longer
envy you?"</p>

<p>"Bad girl, I have the influenza, you may depend;
let us look in 'Watson's Practice' for a remedy."</p>

<p>"Bosh! but if you do not wish to talk with me,
don't drown me with tears. Do you think it will
be too cold for us to walk down to the pines this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"On your way home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and to come back. Can you send me
home by Moses? If Mr. Carfield were only here to
drive me home with his remarkable steed!"</p>

<p>"Would you go with him? It might flatter him
deeply."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" Tempe flushed at the
question. "Would I not like to move so handsome
a man, and so indifferent, too? He looks to
me as if made of porphyry, with a crystal here and
there."</p>

<p>"It is a pleasant idea,&mdash;our going to the woods,&mdash;the
air is dry and clear,&mdash;just the day, one of the
last of the season, probably. Are you strong
enough to ramble, Tempe?"</p>

<p>"What did I tell you? I got well at three o'clock
in the afternoon of a Thursday, ten days ago. Can
you and I dine early? By the way, how do you
like Sarah in Chloe's place?"</p>

<p>"Not as well. Will you give me back Chloe
again?"</p>

<p>"When you are married."</p>

<p>Virginia looked conscious again, but Tempe did
not seem to notice it.</p>

<p>Dinner over, at which they grew good-humored
and commonplace, and at which Sarah, with considerable
toss in her manners, waited, they were
ready for the pines. Sarah asked Virginia's permission
to go into town to do some shopping,
which was granted, and she left the house before
them.</p>

<p>In the wood Virginia began:</p>

<p>"If thou hast learned a truth which needs<br/>

No school of long experience, that the world<br/>

Is full of grief and misery, and hast seen<br/>

Enough of all its sorrows, crimes and cares.<br/>

To tire thee of it, enter this wild-wood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tempe, her eyes intently fixed
upon the shafts of a deep, straight vista of trees:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Thou wilt find <i>something</i> here<br/>

Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men,<br/>

And made thee loathe thy life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see Sebastian, Virginia."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Ford!&mdash;what shall we do now?"</p>

<p>"Sit down within this little circle of stumps, or
upon the moss; he sees nothing. Let him come,
and stumble over us; he will not recognize us as
differing from the stumps or moss."</p>

<p>He was coming directly towards them, and he
pulled off his hat, bowing, till he reached the spot
where they were.</p>

<p>"How is it that you are here, Tempe?" he said,
"I am beating up the country for you, alarmed."</p>

<p>"I walked here."</p>

<p>"But what sent you? tell me your caprice."

<p>"I wished to be with a friend."</p>

<p>"Well, you have two beside you."</p>

<p>"More than I need, then."</p>

<p>He looked at Virginia and smiled, and then
threw himself down beside Tempe.</p>

<p>"Curious old ballad in these trees! Miss Brande,
lend me your handkerchief, the moss scratches my
face. Hark, now, to that enchanting cadence, rising
from,&mdash;heaven knows where, to die an airy
death against our faces."</p>

<p>Virginia was about passing her handkerchief,
when Tempe caught it, and said an affair of lace
would not serve, and that moss was a suitable
cushion, especially the red-eyed moss, such as
Sebastian was crushing with his elbows. Catholics,
she believed, ought to be fond of discomforts.</p>

<p>"What if I should grow to be fond of one of the
discomforts of my daily life?" he answered.</p>

<p>"And that would be?" Virginia asked.</p>

<p>"This little girl."</p>

<p>"Sebastian has caught the trick of sarcasm from
Uncle Argus," said Tempe, "but he is not so clever
at it."</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "my everlasting melancholy
steps in, and softens the blows; Argus, being pitiless,
cuts and comes again."</p>

<p>"It is not strange that he should be infected
with the gayety at our house," said Tempe,&mdash;"that
palace of mirth, wit, and pleasure. <i>You</i>
know something about it, Virginia."</p>

<p>"I have had happy moments there, at all events."</p>

<p>"I too," said Sebastian, "free, blessed moments.
But, Tempe, you did not tell me the reason you
left home so early this morning."</p>

<p>"I left on a subject connected, possibly, with
the happy moments Virginia speaks of. Did you
miss me?"</p>

<p>"You were lost," he said vehemently, "and then
I discovered that I was capable of being alarmed
about you. Neither Roxalana nor Chloe knew
where you were, and Argus is in town.&mdash;Strange,"
he half muttered to himself, "that I feel some
weight clinging to me, dragging me on again!
What dream is it? Will my powers be given away
once more?"</p>

<p>Virginia thought him an enigma. Tempe
scarcely heard his last words. An indescribable
expression of pleased pride changed her pale, listless
face; she pushed her hair from it, as if she
felt the change, and bent towards him.</p>

<p>"Little one," he said, rising quickly, "your errand
done, will you come home with me?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mr. Ford," interposed Virginia,
"go with us; for Tempe has declared an
intention of finishing the day with me."</p>

<p>"I will visit you here, Miss Brande, if you will
permit. Do you not like to receive in these beautiful
still woods?"</p>

<p>"I shall not go back with you, Sebastian," said
Tempe, "unless you choose to accept Virginia's
invitation."</p>

<p>"Let us walk towards the river," he said, "and
then I will take my leave of you."</p>

<p>"I am too tired to move about," said Tempe,
provoked at his refusal to go with them; but,
curious to get an opinion of him from Virginia, she
urged them to walk on, while she gathered cones
from the trees around her. A moment and they
were out of sight, which vexed her so much that
she bit a cone to pieces, and decided that they
should not find her when they returned to the
spot. Accordingly she went to the house, and
met Mr. Carfield, who had just arrived from
his journey, he said, and had left Mr. Brande at
the Forge.</p>

<p>For a time Sebastian and Virginia were silent.
The paths through which they wound were narrow
and dusky; no sound followed their steps in the
soft, deep bed of needles, shed by the trees whose
green tops kept their secret from the air, which
hung over them like a silvery web. The occasion
brought the impulse which seized her to confide
her fears and hopes to the one beside her.</p>

<p>"I should like to speak to you," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Should you, to <i>me</i>, as an individual? Recollect
that you never have so spoken."</p>

<p>"Have I not?" she answered, surprised at his
accent.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I am all attention; please go on."</p>

<p>Feeling somewhat confused, and not quite so
ready as she supposed with her subject, she said:</p>

<p>"Do you find Tempe changed? Is she not interesting?"</p>

<p>"I do find her changed, and interesting; is it of
her you would speak?"</p>

<p>"No, no, of myself; perhaps I shall bore you,
though, Mr. Ford."</p>

<p>"Once more, I am listening."</p>

<p>"We must soon go back to Tempe, I suppose;
another time may answer."</p>

<p>He took his watch from his pocket and showed
it to her.</p>

<p>"Whenever you say so, of course we will return."</p>

<p>She stopped, glowing, trembling with excitement.
A tree jutted into the path behind Sebastian;
he stopped there, resting his shoulders
against it; the gray and green shade over and
around them brought out their faces in exquisite
relief. For all her preoccupation, she was struck
by the strange, winning beauty of the eyes fastened
upon her,&mdash;the sensibility and power of the lips
which seemed shut with the seal of an impenetrable
sadness. He felt her breath coming and going,
she stood so near him; and a melody, wilder and
sweeter than the cadence in the pines, rising, falling,
dying in their evergreen tops at the will of the
embracing wind, swept over him. So near Virginia,
in this ancient, somber solitude, apart in its
character from any association, or touch of human
will and interest, dividing him from his experiences
and knowledge, penetrated him with a new truth.
In her existed what he had found in no woman before.
She ended the tumults, speculations and
vague beliefs, which had sent him hither and
thither.</p>

<p>For an instant his powers of endurance were
tested. He would have taken her in his arms, to
mingle the current of his breath, blood, soul, life
with hers; then all would be understood, and this
interview be but the beginning of a fair hope, promising
happiness from the text of youth, beauty
and equal powers.</p>

<p>He assumed, however, a still more careless attitude,
looked into the sky and said: "Time shall
not pass till you have chosen to honor me with
what you intended to say."</p>

<p>His black eyelashes drooped, his face expressed
a concentrated repose. "Heaven!" he muttered,
"Tricked by opportunity again! I mean, Miss
Brande, that a man is drift-weed, merely. And
here I am standing meekly against a tree, waiting
for your confidence."</p>

<p>"If drift-weed merely, I should have no confidences
to tax you with."</p>

<p>"Let us walk on," he said abruptly. "Do not
reproach me with idle phrases."</p>

<p>They came in sight presently of a bend in the
river, and passed an opening through which they
caught a glimpse of Mr. Brande's house. At that
moment, as they slowly disappeared in the depths
of the woods again, Mr. Carfield, sitting beside
Tempe in the gay, comfortable parlor, was in the
act of raising her little hand to his lips, and exchanging
a glance whose rays darted from that extensive
dominion the devil always shines upon.
Virginia's agitation rose again, but she began to
speak of Mr. Carfield, his relation with her father,
and with herself. Sebastian's nostrils dilated occasionally,
otherwise he made no demonstration,
but he observed that she passed over the affair
which Argus had spoken of, concerning Mr. Carfield.
Whether she intended to tell Sebastian of
the last night's scene, she hardly knew, but his silence
and impassiveness led her on. She omitted
no particular of it.</p>

<p>When she said, "He fell at my feet," Sebastian
caught her by the arm and moved her aside,
clicked his fingers, and cried, "Christ, my
pistol?"</p>

<p>"Your eyes are terrible; I am sorry I have told
you, but I wanted your advice," she said.</p>

<p>"Is there any more?"</p>

<p>"And then this morning," she continued, "when
I could not find the note, I felt assailed by some
unknown misfortune."</p>

<p>"What note?"</p>

<p>She paused, turned red, and pale again.</p>

<p>"The one from Argus. Do you know nothing
of it? Why, Tempe, to whom he intrusts nothing,
brought me a second to-day."</p>

<p>"And of the second one I know as little."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Ford, how I can compel Mr. Carfield
to forego the insane pursuit of myself?"</p>

<p>He saw that she had not approached the matter
she most wished to speak of.</p>

<p>"Ask Argus, Miss Brande."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is quite late?"</p>

<p>"Nearly sunset."</p>

<p>"Shall you always live in Kent?"</p>

<p>"It is my wish."</p>

<p>"Have you no mother, or sister, or, or&mdash;love?"</p>

<p>"I have no family, but I do love a very beautiful,
sincere woman. I shall never marry her, though,
and we may consider that subject disposed of."</p>

<p>"Sebastian, if you mean to live at Temple House,
be my brother. And now may I own that I love a
beautiful and sincere man."</p>

<p>"Argus?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will be no woman's brother, not even Roxalana's.
Shall I promise that, and live with you,
Virginia? Do you know that I am that man, who,
if you were the wife of Argus, and I eating his
bread, under his roof, also,&mdash;the moment, and the
power, might come to both of us&mdash;<i>to love</i>."</p>

<p>"Then," said Virginia sadly, "I must be the
means of Argus losing his dear friend."</p>

<p>"Does Argus love you?" he asked sharply.
How could she answer the question, when she
dared not ask herself?</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;yes. Should he not?" she replied.</p>

<p>"You contemplate marriage with Argus. I believe
you will find a pure and tranquil happiness
with him."</p>

<p>"If he loves me. Does he love me?"</p>

<p>"Take him at his word, I entreat you. Now I
am sure that you have come to the point. I am
entirely at your service&mdash;with one warning. If
you ask me to leave Temple House, I will not
promise to."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ford, will you return home with me."</p>

<p>"If you insist."</p>

<p>"Tempe will remain all night, possibly; I can not
count on her taking a message to Argus. How
shall I arrange to meet him? How shall I keep
him and Mr. Carfield apart? How shall I escape
my father's will? I am afraid, terribly. Who is
that in the Forge path?"</p>

<p>"The figure of a woman, hurrying on."</p>

<p>"It is not Tempe?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>They hastened across the path, into the wood on
the other side, and, finding no Tempe, returned in
time to overtake Sarah, the one they saw in the
path. She was belated, she said, in her shopping,
but tea should be ready, as usual.</p>

<p>"So you changed your mind, Sebastian," said
Tempe, as Virginia entered the parlor with him.
"Or were you afraid of the woods, Virginia?
What possessed you to keep out so late?"</p>

<p>"It is late, I acknowledge," Sebastian answered,
"but we yielded to an influence which you resisted,
it seems. Why did you not wait?"</p>

<p>"I got tired of the crickets, and having uprooted
a whole tribe of toadstools, I thought I had better
come back. I found Mr. Carfield."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"Gone to the office."</p>

<p>Sebastian looked at Tempe sternly; it displeased
him to hear her speak so familiarly of the man he
had reason to detest.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "let me take you home at
once."</p>

<p>"You are absurd. I feel merry here. We shall
have a banquet presently from dishes that are not
cracked, and on a table-cloth that is not darned.
Can't you endure a momentary pang of luxury,
Sebastian? I am another being outside the walls
of our common jail. Can you not indulge me a
little, and graciously smile at the change? You
think me morbid, irritable, feeble, beside our stately
mother and friend, Roxalana. Observe me, I say,
here."</p>

<p>"Poor wretch! what would you have?"</p>

<p>"Everything that you have had,&mdash;the first and
final pleasure and pain of every awakened feeling.
I would even like to be drowned, Sebastian."</p>

<p>His olive-tinted face burned with an angry flush.</p>

<p>"You are mischievous out of your cage, Tempe;
it is not safe to let you escape for a moment."</p>

<p>Without heeding him, she went on:</p>

<p>"To begin with, I must have one, two, three
worshipers."</p>

<p>"Fire-worshipers don't come into this part of
the world; nor incense-burners. I shall take care
of the one, two, three worshipers you may select.
Tempe, I had better marry you, and keep you in
charge. I shall do so."</p>

<p>She sprang up as if struck a violent blow.</p>

<p>"Not unless I love you,&mdash;unless you love me,"
she cried.</p>

<p>"It should happen&mdash;our marriage, without love
on either side; I have loved, and you are incapable
of loving,&mdash;see, what a match it will be! How
interesting its problem! <i>You</i> and <i>me</i> bound! I
like the idea. Do you?"</p>

<p>He took her hands and made her stand up, close
to him.</p>

<p>"Do you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"If we can go in the traces&mdash;tandem, sir. I
would as lief marry you and break your heart as
not. But how much heart did you bring to Kent?"</p>

<p>"Enough, my child, to match yours. Am I accepted,
Tempe?"</p>

<p>"Hush, you strange man," said Virginia, "they
are coming." And at this moment Mr. Brande and
Mr. Carfield entered.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Drake," said Mr. Brande, advancing
with outstretched hands, "how long it is since
you have been seen in my poor house."</p>

<p>Sebastian stared at Tempe; he had never heard
her called by her married name before. Virginia
hastened to introduce him to her father.</p>

<p>"I am happy to welcome you here, sir," he said.
"If I am correct, sir, I believe few people in Kent
are honored with your visits; I understand that you
are a recluse, sir."</p>

<p>"I indulge myself with much out-of-door life,
but I enter no house," Sebastian replied, in so
strong a foreign accent that both Tempe and
Virginia looked at him in surprise. Mr. Carfield
having made him a slight bow, which was returned
by one quite as foreign as the accent, remarked that
it had taken quite a quantity of out-of-door life that
afternoon to enable him to reach the house at all.</p>

<p>"I take great pleasure in the fine environs of
this spot, Mr. Carfield. I have penetrated their
concealed depths this day," he replied. "Do you
find no attraction outside, or do you depend upon
life within walls for your pleasure? I know little of
the domestic drama; but I conclude that the most
isolated, equable, in-door life contains much worth
one's study&mdash;<i>at all hours</i>."

<p>In spite of his self-control, there was a menace in
his eyes which Mr. Carfield saw and set down to
the influence of Argus; for it could never come
into his thoughts that Virginia would betray him.
She felt uncomfortable at Sebastian's behavior&mdash;perplexed
and haunted by a fear.</p>

<p>"Why this delay, daughter," asked Mr. Brande,
"about tea?"</p>

<p>"Sarah has been in town all the afternoon,"
answered Virginia.</p>

<p>"Gadding and gossiping."</p>

<p>"I dare say," she answered, rising to leave the
room.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you, Virginia," begged Tempe;
"I would like to look into the closets with you."</p>

<p>"Come, then."</p>

<p>As soon as they were in the dining-room, Tempe
seized hold of Virginia.</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet so strange a creature as
Sebastian Ford. He so coolly thinks he can drive
Providence like a team."</p>

<p>"I like him very much."</p>

<p>"I hate him; I wish to torment his life out."</p>

<p>"If you try, I shall have no doubt of your success.
Now please be quiet; I am both busy and
weary. I never knew Sarah so behind time."</p>

<p>"One minute more, Virginia," begged Tempe,
hugging her tightly. "You never had the least
faith in me, but have been patient, and I love you.
I do, dear; I am sorry I haven't been a better
friend, but I will be better&mdash;with you, though I
can not be good; goodness isn't agreeable to me.
Kiss me, and look straight into my face."</p>

<p>Virginia laughed and struggled; Tempe's gaze
was direct, hard and questioning.</p>

<p>"There is something senseless about you,
Tempe, but I have always taken it for granted that
we were to keep together through life. Let me
go."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;you&mdash;want&mdash;Sebastian to love you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;you&mdash;going&mdash;to marry Mr. Carfield, or be
compelled to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Then attend to your supper. I have looked
into the closet!"</p>

<p>As supper was announced, Mr. Brande, in a slight
fit of absent-mindedness, was observing to Mr. Carfield
that he perceived a great change in that
young woman, the niece of Gates; she had grown
five years older since he had last seen her. Mr.
Carfield said she was deuced handsome, though
rather slight in build, and rather skittish in manners.
It was a relief to Sebastian to be called out.
How was it possible for Virginia to exist in the atmosphere
of her father's house? he thought. And
that she should have been drawn to Temple House,
and on to loving Argus did not seem so strange to
him now. He could not resist the double dream of
to-day, while quietly courteous to Mr. Brande.
The melody begun among the trees floated through
his thoughts. Had there been no Argus, to-day
would not have lost him Virginia, and gained him
Tempe. Then an unwonted picture rose before
him;&mdash;a different air, the mass and blaze of tropical
foliage spreading along alluvial shores, filling
deep, sinuous valleys, creeping up volcanic slopes;
a basin-like sea; a range of iron-edged mountains;
a dull, dark town, with low towers and balconies;
and everywhere himself, the moving figure in the
landscape&mdash;kneeling before a woman, reclining beside
her, holding her in his arms, giving her flowers
and fruits and jewels, and the ardent heart of a
boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Brande, somewhat to his self-concern, continued
to observe Tempe. She attracted him, and
why she did at this moment, and had never before,
was beyond his understanding. His eyes followed
her movements; when Sebastian, hat in hand, declared
he must go, and again asked her if she were
ready, they went up and down the black and white
stripes of her dress, in and out the deep waves of
her hair, down her ivory cheek, dropped on her little
ears, her pearls of teeth, her slender hands, and
it seemed to him that he was looking upon a kind
of creature perfectly new to him.</p>

<p>"Come, Sebastian," and she approached him to
whisper in his ear the message Virginia had given
her for Argus.</p>

<p>He stood before Virginia, not only to bid her
good-night, but to give a farewell to the emotions
which she had inspired, and his ideas of the future
he had so suddenly devised. Whatever the future
might prove, his act should now be one of sacrifice.</p>

<p>If Virginia had been gifted with that power of
insight which some women have, she might have
been agitated at the spectacle of a heroic soul in
the act of self-abnegation, a heart denying it by a
passionate struggle; but she was not gifted with
it, and, felt merely, when she looked into his handsome
eyes, a regret at losing a tie between herself
and Argus. Sebastian bent over her hand, and
pressed his lips upon it. Virginia never received
so much in a caress, and never would again.</p>

<p>The evening was wearing away rapidly. Virginia
fell into an impatience she could hardly control.
When and how could she hear from Argus?
She could not live through another day of suspense;
if she did, something might come and thwart her
purpose of leaving her father. She held some
knitting in her hand, as an excuse for silence and
inattention; suddenly, and to her annoyance,
Tempe affirmed that after all she must go home
that evening, and claimed Virginia's promise that
Moses should drive her there.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not by any means," said Mr. Brande.
"If you must go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will drive you down in my light wagon," interrupted
Mr. Carfield.</p>

<p>Tempe, developed into a coquette by the espionage
of these men as rapidly as a weed developes
in the sun and showers of April, looked from one
to the other.</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy to accompany you
home," continued Mr. Brande; "either to walk, or
take you in my chaise."</p>

<p>Virginia was lost in astonishment at her father's
proffer; but was recalled from it by the low voice
of Mr. Carfield, who had come near her, and taken
away her knitting. He laughed wickedly as he
said: "You see perfectly, Virginia, how potent
and all-surprising is the effect of beauty. Your
father is quite dazed, isn't he? Quite natural, I
am sure: he is in the prime of life, and is violating
nature's intention as he is. Nature will revenge
herself, and force at last the merest worm of a man
to assert his rights. You agree with me?"</p>

<p>"How long, how long, my God," she whispered,
"is this man to be my humiliation and disgrace?"</p>

<p>"Which shall it be?" he said, turning to Tempe.
"Your humble servant, or our polite host?"</p>

<p>He looked so gay and unconcerned, so handsomely
bold, so different from the sarcastic Argus,
the immovable Sebastian, that Tempe admired
him. Mr. Brande she was afraid of.</p>

<p>"Tempe," Virginia called, "I insist upon your
staying; it is childish to think of returning, when
Mr. Ford has just gone with your message."</p>

<p>"Daughter, Mrs. Drake must not be urged to
stay against her will; she knows best, certainly."</p>

<p>"I will stay, Virginia, if you wish it so much,"
Tempe said, after a little reflection. "I am quite
happy here, of course."</p>

<p>She took a seat on a low stool at Virginia's feet,
and looked affectionately at her. Mr. Brande
thought the picture enticing; his mouth relaxed in
contemplating it. There was something richly
soothing in the idea&mdash;the two handsome girls
together; he would like to keep them so, as his&mdash;one
his faithful, sensible, correct daughter, the
other his playful, piquant, pliant, toy-wife. All
the while he looked at them he wondered at himself;
what he had dreamed of so many years was,
after all, approaching him in a legitimate way.
But&mdash;why should he be so blest? Providence was
playing into his hands so freely and unmistakably
that he was almost inclined to think that a belief
in that power was not so much a moral necessity
for the sake of training the soul for a hereafter life
as it was an agreeable dependence on its aid to
bring things about according to one's desires in
this world. Virginia being neither moralist, just
now, nor heroine, would gladly have shaken Tempe
and reproached her for affectation and silliness.
As she could not do this, she coldly took up her
knitting, and maintained an obstinate silence. Mr.
Carfield, an acute observer, laughed again jovially
from the depths of his full chest, and said, to himself,
"Harlequin now signifies to the statue, that its
pasteboard arm must descend on the intruder who
attempts to pass the portals where the true lovers
have entered."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX.</p>

</div>

<p>SEBASTIAN determined, on the way home, to
find Argus at once, and open the subject
pending between him and Virginia. For that
purpose he went over the house in search of him.
Though there was a haze of cigar smoke in the
green room, and the glimmer of a candle under his
bedroom door, he was not to be seen. Roxalana
said that she had been left in the dark concerning
the general dispersion of the family that day, and
supposed if anything was to happen therefrom she
should hear of it in good time. She was glad to
know of Tempe's visit to Virginia, and surprised
that Sebastian should have gone to Mr. Brande's.
What did he think of the house?</p>

<p>"I felt it to be a bad place."</p>

<p>"Did you comprehend Virginia's position?
There is something mysterious and doubtful going
on with her; I have felt so for some time."</p>

<p>"I think her life will be happier shortly. Roxalana,
you are attached to her?"</p>

<p>"Very much; she is a noble girl."</p>

<p>"How is she noble?"</p>

<p>"You know she has been brought up by her
father's strict and narrow religious ideas, yet she is
not self-righteous; her father is also rich, yet her
taste is simple, and the capacity for self-denial is
not deadened in the least. Indeed, Sebastian,
considering that she is conventionally pious, rich,
and handsome, you must agree with me, and think
it remarkable that she should possess traits which
have nothing to do with these facts, and which
please those who are also devoid of them; like
me, for instance. That you, who sometimes feel
strangely filled with reverence, are handsome&mdash;though
your nose is a trifle too large&mdash;and, at least
have been rich, should not feel a sympathy for her,
or liking, is strange."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Roxalana, I have had such a day!"</p>

<p>"What have you been in pursuit of?"</p>

<p>"I was pursued, caught, and am extricating
myself."</p>

<p>"When you said, a short time since, that you
needed me, I feared you had become unhappy. It
is not to be expected that you should find happiness
in this dull house, and with us plain old people.
But I had the impression, when you came
here, that you had suffered so deeply from the
causes which men believe happiness springs from,
you would not seek them again; in short, I reckoned
that, like Argus and myself, you had used up
a portion of life&mdash;one lung say, and were contented
to breathe through the other. You are a young
man, and I have made a senseless mistake; grandmothers
will err in their judgment, because their
memories are short. You may be frank with
me, tell me <i>anything</i> you choose. I am as silent
as a sponge, and as absorbing; when you are ready
to wring out all you have confided, I shall still be
the same."</p>

<p>He reflected whether he should deny himself the
sad pleasure of confession; whether they could
not together keep a secret, which should remain in
their minds, like a sword, the fall of which would
cut asunder the destinies of the whole family&mdash;with
Virginia added! No. He would not add a burden
to the mind, so passive, yet so unreasonable in
suffering. After a short pause, during which she
regarded him affectionately, he clasped her hand,
and said:</p>

<p>"Did I say that I went for Tempe?"</p>

<p>"No; if you did go, I thank you."</p>

<p>"Her absence tormented me."</p>

<p>"Do you say so, Sebastian? Then the time has
come for me to interfere with her; I shall not permit
her to disquiet you in the least. It is enough for
me to be the witness of her vagaries. And yet, of
late, I have been somewhat encouraged in regard
to Tempe; her temper has seemed milder, her feelings
better. It is a sad thing to say, but my only
child has never given me the means of a day's
happiness since she grew up."</p>

<p>"But she will do so."</p>

<p>"I should be thankful to be so convinced."</p>

<p>"So I went after her, and found her, and then
the something which has pursued me in the most
stealthy manner for quite a period, as I now recognize,
arrived at my very heart. I am agitated,&mdash;in
conflict; no, not in conflict&mdash;in a profound exaltation,
and I must give it a form in absolute,
irremediable acts."</p>

<p>She did not understand him, and she said so,
telling him to go on until she could, and remarking,
mentally, that it would be a great relief to him
to be rid of his puzzling thoughts. He continued:</p>

<p>"Could I ever do anything better than to take
Tempe, if she will be so good, for my wife?"</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed turning to marble, they fixed
upon him so immovably. He smiled, drew back,
and said:</p>

<p>"Answer."</p>

<p>Drawling and hesitating, but making her words
distinct, she replied:</p>

<p>"Sebastian, you astound me! Your mind is
astray. It will be impossible for me to comprehend
this idea."</p>

<p>"What of that? I do not comprehend one hour
of my life. I am assailed, vanquished, changed,
inspired, and directed, by sensations as vital and
necessary as the Creator is; if they are blind, like
chance, what have I to do with that?"</p>

<p>"She is a child, and&mdash;a widow."</p>

<p>"A child no longer and the widowhood"&mdash;Sebastian
snapped his fingers. Roxalana laughed until
her marble eyes glittered with tears; the best thing
she could do under the circumstances, for she was
not prepared to decide on a question which she felt
must be against the happiness of one or the other,
whether she said "Yes," or "No." Tempe could
not make Sebastian happy. Sebastian was perhaps
necessary to the willful creature!</p>

<p>"Why in the world," she said, "have you not
conversed with Tempe on this subject? It is not
the fashion here, for parents to marry their children.
We marry ourselves in this country, and so
the idea of <i>family</i> is disintegrated, like all our
institutions."</p>

<p>"How can you say this, Roxalana, when you
have the example of Miss Brande before you?
She has not dared to banish the man her father
desires her to marry. I still doubt whether she
will marry&mdash;" he stopped.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what kind of man Cyrus
Brande is? He is a pest to that girl. Why don't
she run away from him? I should be glad to inform
him of my opinion concerning his behavior
to her."</p>

<p>"And you would protect her if she came to you?
But we are running wide of our discussion. Have
I your permission? By the way, I believe I have
money enough to serve us all, after our present
way of living."</p>

<p>"Give me a little time to think over the matter;
probably I shall come to a reasonable conclusion."</p>

<p>"My dear Roxalana, it is settled. Have no uneasiness;
it is good for me to be un&mdash;to have a
purpose, I mean. Now, I will wait for Argus."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

</div>

<p>"ARGUS," said Sebastian, at the breakfast
table the next morning, "I must speak
with you seriously."</p>

<p>"The devil! Have you thought it necessary
hitherto to approach me with a joke?"</p>

<p>Roxalana, supposing Tempe was to be discussed,
slipped out, and joined Chloe in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Marcy, Missis Gates," said Chloe, "what is the
matter that should make you gum your eyes on
that crack in the wall? Is it growing bigger?
What ails you, Mrs. Gates?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Chloe, not a word. I have lost my
pocket-handkerchief. I hardly know where I am."</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't lost anything else," Chloe
muttered. "And as for not knowing where you
are, that's no new idee; you never did know, once
out of your chair. I hope and trust," speaking
louder, "that you are not going to sign any deed;
I am against women's signing deeds."</p>

<p>"Chloe, you are idiotic this morning."</p>

<p>"May be; but the Lord made me."</p>

<p>This skirmish ended, Chloe went to work
furiously, remarking that she was going to work
off a dreadful dream she had had. Before night
came she said that she had not dreamed for nothing,
and that she knew it all along.</p>

<p>Sebastian looked thoughtfully at Argus, and said
he did not know how to venture with him.</p>

<p>"Serious, serious&mdash;mind," Argus replied, with a
cool smile. "What if I begin the talk at the bottom
instead of the top, and tell you the prowl I
had last night? I went to see Squire Perkins."</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"An old gentleman who lives at Boyd's Hill; he
is a Justice of Peace, and can marry people. To-day,
provided I send him word, he is to stick up
the banns at Black's Four Corners,&mdash;a small settlement,
fifteen miles distant, consisting of a meeting-house,
a grog-shop, and a saw-mill. By banns,
I mean a proclamation of marriage."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sebastian, with surprise, but
adopting the lead, "I intended to open with Miss
Brande's message, though I see it is not necessary.
But why banns? they may bring you into trouble."</p>

<p>"Because of the law; and I expect a tempest
thereby. What was her message?"</p>

<p>Sebastian repeated it, and mentioned his visit to
Mr. Brande's.</p>

<p>"I was prepared for it; but whether she will
have nerve enough to violate her own ideas of duty
and propriety remains to be seen. Several days
ago, Sebastian, after a considerable debate, I offered
myself to Virginia, and her message I take as acceptance."</p>

<p>"You can act then, after all?"</p>

<p>"My pace has been slow towards this event;
partly for her sake, more for my own. It has been
naturally retarded by my idiosyncracies, as you
must know."</p>

<p>"How will you dispose of them in the face of
this change?"</p>

<p>"You may help me to manage them, and divert
them from her observation."</p>

<p>"Do you advise me to remain on that account?"</p>

<p>"Remain for my sake, and make me happier."</p>

<p>"So I shall, and I shall marry Tempe."

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"The various reasons which induce men to experiment
with themselves. How else could I bear
to contemplate Virginia as your wife? She is too
lovely for me, a man more properly her mate than
you are,&mdash;to live under the same roof, an objectless,
isolated being."</p>

<p>Argus winced.</p>

<p>"For more than three years, my boy, by precept
and example, have I not inculcated the fact of age,
poverty, and general unfitness?"</p>

<p>"I see it all," said Sebastian hotly, "it is a case
of infatuation. She is one of those intricate
women, who make love an immolation and a spiritual
ecstasy."</p>

<p>"I can't explain it; but be polite to me, or I'll
not warn you about Tempe. Yet why should I
warn you, since you live in her presence?"</p>

<p>"It was for me to warn you, my friend, and I
have done so."</p>

<p>"Having done so then, stay, Sebastian. Are you
not a regular Spanish Don? I understand your
<i>punctilio</i>, and can trust to it, for in you it is <i>principle</i>.
In my late conclusions I have settled it that
she should be surrounded by <i>friendship</i>. She is
beautiful, and I can no longer resist her,&mdash;especially
since the ground which I thought steadfast
has rolled from under me. I can bestow happiness
on no woman; ought I not then to allow the existence
of all other sentiments?"</p>

<p>"Fallacious idea, even stupid! Do you imagine
a woman will content herself with the shelter of a
cool, shady tree, when she has chosen that a vine
should entwine her? It is your damnable coolness,
your iron-bound nature, that dares you to venture
on this step; not because you understand women."</p>

<p>"Shall I silence you with my experiences, at
your age? Or shall I laugh with that patience men
feel, when those experiences are impossible?"</p>

<p>"You are a terrible man; but if you are past
loving, you are about to commit a crime."</p>

<p>Argus smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"Who will heed it? Since you know women so
well, tell me, have you asked them if the world is
peopled by love?"</p>

<p>He rose and walked round the room, lifting here
and there one of the chairs with a thumb and
finger, and dropping it like a ball.</p>

<p>"I loved my wife with a different strength," he
continued, resuming his seat, "because I was a
boy. I lost her when I was a boy; and if she is an
immortal, as my moods sometimes intimate, I indulge
the idea that I may be a boy again,&mdash;when
we meet."</p>

<p>"This is very sad," said Sebastian mournfully.</p>

<p>"Sad! Everything looks sad, when we go to
the portcullis which hangs over the gateway between
us and the problem of existence, to get a
glimpse into the labyrinth! Happily, we can not
penetrate it, and so turn back to be comfortable in
our mean and narrow ways. I thought there was
nothing better for me than the life you found me
in, and was passively grateful for it; I cumbered
the ground for no one, allowing none to approach
me with service, and, consequently burdening none
with obligation. Sebastian, it passed away the
night I sprained my shoulder on the White Flat,
and laid you under an eternal obligation. There
must have been witches abroad that night."</p>

<p>Sebastian shuddered, sprang up, and averted his
face.</p>

<p>"The spell was broken then," continued Argus,
"for both of us. My life has not been the same,
and I regret that I did not sooner adapt myself to
new circumstances."</p>

<p>Sebastian turned, and caught Argus under his
elbows, and held him firmly, drawing his face close
to his own furious, glittering eyes.</p>

<p>"I knew it," he cried, "and you denied it! Was
she dead round my neck?"</p>

<p>Argus nodded.</p>

<p>"She is out there on the White Flat."</p>

<p>"I buried her. And now you would marry my
niece. Well, I wish to marry Virginia, with whom
you offer me&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"The <i>same</i>, if you could promise us that we
should be left in everlasting rest together."</p>

<p>Argus turned deadly pale, and said, "It will not
profit us to talk farther. <i>I</i> am, in fact, carried
beyond myself."</p>

<p>Sebastian extended his hand to Argus in extreme
agitation, and Argus taking it, continued: "Something
beyond me, as I said, urges me on with you.
Once more, Sebastian, I love you, and the thought
of parting with you is not to be borne."</p>

<p>"Things must be as I propose then, Argus. By
my soul I love you, also. Yes, by my faithless, lost
soul, with or without the millstone round my neck,
or any purpose or desire in my heart, I love you,
and recognize you as my master."</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that," said Argus gently. "But
let me hope I have conquered."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

</div>

<p>MAT SUTCLIFF, going up the alley towards
home, saw a woman flitting from his door, and
Mary standing by it, apparently wrenching the
handle off.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mat!" she cried, when he stepped across
the threshold, "did you ever?"</p>

<p>"Who is in fits now? Let the door alone, and
don't be jiggery."</p>

<p>"Did you see Mrs. Bayley?"</p>

<p>"I saw petticoats scudding."</p>

<p>"Well, says she to me, as I was sitting by the
table darning stockings&mdash;your blue ones, and every
mite of color is going to wash out of them, for the
rinsing water was as blue as anything&mdash;coming in
out of breath, says she, '<i>Have</i> you heard the story
that's going round like wildfire, Mrs. Sutcliffe?'
'No,' says I, 'I'm attending to my own business.'
'So you be,' says she, 'but I'm bound to tell it
to you, 'cause I know you have friends interested,
and 'cause I want to know whether you
believe it.' It is the worst thing I ever heard in
my life. Mat."</p>

<p>"Has Clark's sow ate up her pigs again? Hold
on a bit, I want to light my pipe. Let me know
when you get to the middle of next week, and I'll
clap on my ears."</p>

<p>"She said they said that Mr. Brande's Sarah,
the gal that hands the vittles, said yesterday at Mrs.
Paulding's the milliner's, that she was getting most
tired of the state of affairs up at the Forge: that
the very night before, Virginia Brande's beau, Mr.
Carfield, was in her very bedroom over an hour;
and she, Sarah knew, was in her night-clothes; and
that wasn't all she could tell: and that Argus Gates
couldn't be aware what he was after."</p>

<p>Mat's pipe fell on the floor, and he stamped it
into powder.</p>

<p>"Toad, adder, skunk, bitch!" he yelled. "Why
didn't some of the Christians there choke her, and
throw her into the well?"</p>

<p>"You mean Sarah. Mrs. Bayley said they all
believed the story; that they had been expecting
it. If something wasn't wrong, why hadn't Mr.
Carfield married her before? She was no chicken;
and they guessed she had been ready some time.
Says she, Mrs. Bayley, 'There wasn't a store on
Main Street that hadn't the whole particulars by
six o'clock yesterday afternoon; they do say, too,
that the church will have to look into it.' I know
there is not a word of truth in it; and I said so to
Mrs. Bayley."</p>

<p>"There is something in it, half on't may be true;
if that hound did get into Miss Brande's room, you
may be sure he went out with a yelp. But blarsted
if I can puzzle out how she has found out anything
about Argus Gates."</p>

<p>"What is there to know?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go right up to the Capen, and tell
him this."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why should you tell <i>him?</i>"</p>

<p>"If you knew, you'd be returning Mrs. Bayley's
kindness in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I can guess."</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"Argus Gates has a notion of courting Virginia
Brande; <i>she</i> has courted him long enough. But
I am for it. Mat, and I wish I could help her.
She has always demeaned herself to me beautiful,
and made me feel that I was as good as anybody."</p>

<p>"That's so; and you have guessed it. I carried
a billet to her for the Capen, and I am afraid I
kinder acted like a noodle, by giving it to her afore
folks, and so brought on a crisis, as they call it.
Keep dark now; it will all come out soon,&mdash;right
side up, with care, glass. What would you do, if
was me?"</p>

<p>"If I was you, after what you have told me, I'd
tend strictly to the business of picking oakum.
You can make good, straight rope-yarn, but you
get everything else you undertake into knots."</p>

<p>"Hang it, I do kinder feel as if my tail was between
my legs."</p>

<p>"Go right off, and tell the whole thing to Gates.
I'll look out of the window, and out of doors; besides,
I am going up to Cuff &amp; Smith's after
pearl-ash, I may see how the wind blows towards
the Forge. It will be a flaw in Argus if he marries
her after this. A girl never gets rid of such a smut
on her: the little children now growing up, and
hearing this story, will remember it whenever they
see her, if she lives to be a hundred years old and
behaves like an angel. If she should have children,
the story will always be mentioned, when they are
mentioned."</p>

<p>"Damned, brutal, stinking hole of a Kent!"
yelled Mat again; "I wish I had the tying of a stone
round your neck. I'd sink ye a hundred fathoms in
hell!"</p>

<p>"Some other town would come up in its place,
just like it. Didn't that missionary say, who
preached in the hall, for ten cents a ticket, that
human nature in the Burmese Empire was much
like the human nature of our own enlightened New
England."</p>

<p>"Then I guess the missionaries had better stay
to home; for, 'pears to me, human nature's too
much for 'em."</p>

<p>And Mat turned on his heels, and went after Argus.
Going in at the kitchen door, he found a man
waiting from the Forge, and talking with Chloe.
Tempe had written a note to inform her mother
that she meant to stay a day or two longer, and requested
that some articles of dress should be sent
her. When Mat heard this, he felt still more uneasy;
it seemed to him that he must follow the man
to Mr. Brande's house, drag out Mr. Carfield, pound
him to death, and bring away Tempe, and Virginia,
too. If it wasn't a State's prison offense, he'd certainly
cripple Brande by burning his house, and the
Forge buildings. He wished Kent was in Mr.
Ford's country&mdash;South America&mdash;where there were
chances of an earthquake, and the cunning control
and power of the priest. If he could only buy a
priest then things could be managed. "Chloe," he
said, solemnly and reproachfully, "in the Lord's
name, why did you ever leave your missey?"</p>

<p>"'Twas in the Lord's name that I did leave I
suppose," she answered crossly. "What did you
come for?"</p>

<p>"To see the Capen; where is he?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs with missis; they are looking at the
old, empty, south rooms."</p>

<p>"Be they? Well, they must stop. Have <i>you</i>
heard anything to-day?"

<p>"There, there&mdash;didn't I say so? I have felt it
in my bones."</p>

<p>"Your bones are in a bad way, then."

<p>He ran from the door to the fireplace, half doubling
his body, spit furiously into the fire, and whispered
fiercely:</p>

<p>"There's a vile, beastly, rotten lie spread all over
town, about your missey. I wouldn't tell ye if I
didn't know that some fool would surprise ye worse,
and make ye show off against your will."</p>

<p>Her dry mouth opened and shut a dozen times
before she could speak&mdash;then she seized him, and
shook him.</p>

<p>"Who dares?" she said. "Does <i>she</i> know it is
out? Get Tempe home. Do you want the Capen
to know it? I say you must go for Tempe, or there
will be two of them."</p>

<p>She fell back into a chair, and wrung her hands
silently; her face was wrinkled and knit with pain.
Mat looked at her in astonishment and disgust.</p>

<p>"Blarsted if this ere sister don't <i>believe it against
her missey</i>."</p>

<p>"How did it get out out?" she asked, in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>"Get out," he repeated, indignantly, "what do
you mean by that face? Put on a different one.
Would you insult one of the best girls alive? This
comes from your ideas of total depravity. Or is it
something worse? Never was so disappointed in
anybody as I am in you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by coming here to scare me
half to death with a lot of nonsense?"</p>

<p>"You'll find no nonsense here."</p>

<p>In a few words he told her the story, and then
sent her upstairs for Argus.</p>

<p>When Mat had finished his relation, Argus immediately
repeated it to Roxalana; they were both entirely
unmoved by it. If it were true,&mdash;and Argus,
from his knowledge of Mr. Carfield, thought there
might be foundation for the report, it was only a
reason for more haste in their marriage. Virginia
must be removed from that house. He told Roxalana
his own story now, she listened to it with calm
approval, and understood him thoroughly.</p>

<p>"Between us all," she said, "I believe she will
be happy. A new happiness in this house, Argus,
I never again expected."</p>

<p>"It is to come, Roxalana, from the cloud you
wrapped us all in. The chill wind from it, and its
threatening darkness, drove me from my position."</p>

<p>"Must I learn at this late period, that good comes
from evil? But Argus, no time must be lost. I
advise you to send for Virginia at once. She shall
stay under my wing; no legal power can take her
away."</p>

<p>"Is she not infirm of will?"</p>

<p>"Through her love and duty only. But she
must be made to understand that she has a right
to happiness. However, she has firmly loved you
for years."</p>

<p>"How sly you woman are&mdash;all alike! Why did
you not teach her that I was worthless? You know
that I can only shine as your companion! Have
you ever had the mercy and compassion to view me
imaginatively, as the husband of Virginia Brande?"</p>

<p>"I never was gifted with imagination, Argus.
Upon what a bed of thorns should I have lived, had
it been the case. Do not delay any longer. Shall
I send Chloe? and Tempe is there. Keep this
story from Sebastian at present."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sebastian, Tempe,&mdash;yes. What do you
think of his plan, for you know it."</p>

<p>"I do not think, and do not intend to think; an
avenue is opened there which I shall close my eyes
upon&mdash;both now and hereafter."</p>

<p>Argus chuckled, and accused her of the endeavor
to wash her hands of a bad business. It was evident
that he was in better spirits.</p>

<p>An hour or so, and Chloe had reached the Forge.
It was dusk when she came in sight of the walls of
the house&mdash;as clean and white as those of a sepulchre.
She shook her fist at them.</p>

<p>"The Indian has got here first this time," she
muttered; "but I suppose Chloe will be along, if
I wait a few minutes for her."</p>

<p>She went into the premises by a gate in the wall
at the back of the stables, and put her head in one
of the doors partly open.</p>

<p>"Oh, Moses," she said carelessly, "I thought I
should find you milking. That's Mossy, ain't it?
S'pose she knows me? Koh, Mossy, do you
'member? She shakes her horns; she has forgotten
me. <i>Chloe</i> is coming! Koh, Koh! there,
Moses, she does know me. How much milk does
she give?"</p>

<p>"Nigh on to four quarts. You are quite a
stranger, Chloe."</p>

<p>"So dreadful busy doing nothing, is the reason.
How's the family? Going on the same?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but they be, and I don't know <i>as</i>
they be; me and Sarah have quit."</p>

<p>"Marcy, I haven't heard a word about it."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of news flying in the air; but it
is none of my business, and nothing to me."</p>

<p>"I hope there's no bad news, Moses."</p>

<p>"Go in, Chloe, may be you will find out from
Martha what's to do; I can't make head nor tail
on it. Somebody has been lying, or the world is
so bad I wish I hadn't been born."</p>

<p>"The Lord reigns, Moses."</p>

<p>"I pray accordingly. But it seems to me sometimes,
that if I turned my prayers the other way,
hind side afore, as it were, I should get more attention."</p>

<p>Chloe proceeded up the yard, looking furtively
at the windows, and hoping to get into the house
without meeting Sarah, or Martha. From what
Moses had said, it was evident enough that the
scandal had widely spread; was known to the servants
and all the workmen at the Forge; known
to everybody, except the actors, and Mr. Brande.
No one saw her enter the house. She passed the
dining-room door and heard the rattle of dishes
(Sarah was there arranging the tea-table probably),
and passed the parlor doors intently listening.
Mr. Carfield was inside, and with him Tempe.
She heard Tempe's gay laugh, and Mr. Carfield's
rapid utterance. Like a cat she sped upstairs,
and entered Virginia's chamber without knocking.
Virginia was at the glass adjusting her dress.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chloe," she cried, "you have brought me
good news, I am sure!"</p>

<p>"I got up here without anybody's seeing me,"
Chloe answered, searching her countenance.</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Were you not sent directly to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I think I has brought you no news
to please you concisely; but something bad for
you to hear."</p>

<p>Virginia dropped into a chair, extended her
hand, and Chloe handed her the note Argus had
written. She drew a breath of relief as she read,
for there was no hint of Chloe's mystery; he simply
asked her to return with Chloe as far as the
pines, and meet him there. She raised her eyes to
Chloe, and saw she was closely examined.</p>

<p>"Well, Chloe," she asked, with impatience, "there
is no time to lose."</p>

<p>"So Missis Gates said."</p>

<p>"You seem to understand present affairs. Who
told you?"</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> to be told."</p>

<p>"There must be just so many confidants, I suppose,
when things get to such a pass as this, or
what would become of the romance?"</p>

<p>"Tempe is wanted, too."</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>,&mdash;to go with us?"</p>

<p>"This is no place for the like of her."</p>

<p>"Come, old Chloe,&mdash;haven't you teased me
enough with your oracleship?"</p>

<p>"Missey, Sarah made a world of mischief in
Kent the other day. I must say she did her work
so well I almost think she was hired to do it;
else she has a grudge against some of you."</p>

<p>Virginia, struck with a true apprehension of the
case, turned away from Chloe, caught at a corner
of the dressing-table for something to steady herself
by, and signed to Chloe to go on.</p>

<p>"Don't you think she peeked through the keyhole?
I do; 'cause she mentioned particulars she
must have seen, when that rascal was in <i>here</i>, an
hour or more, that night, and you undressed."</p>

<p>"Is it because of this, that Roxalana sent me
word there must be no delay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; they do feel a storm brewing.
It is all over the town, and many of your friends
believe it. Some pity you."</p>

<p>Virginia laughed wildly, and clenched her hand
upon the note.</p>

<p>"They sent you to me, thinking I must be taken
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, missey. Had you better go? Isn't one
place as good as another, now?"</p>

<p>Chloe, still possessed by her Indian demon, probably,
looked severe and spoke coldly.</p>

<p>"Best Argus!" exclaimed Virginia, kissing the
crumpled paper, so much devotion shining in her
pale face, so much tenderness filling her eyes, that
Chloe was pierced as with a sword. "And Roxalana,
generous friend, strong soul! So will I at
last be generous and strong. Help me, Lord!"</p>

<p>Shutting the note in both her hands, she raised
them towards heaven, and Chloe was again transfixed.</p>

<p>"Oh, missey," she cried, "I do see that it is all
right with you. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was struck dumb by Virginia's slow uprising
from her chair; she looked so tall and terrible
that it seemed to Chloe that she would touch the
ceiling, and spread all over it like an avenging
spirit.</p>

<p>"Say no more, Chloe. I will write a line to
Captain Gates, and you may take it at once. Do
not come to me again."</p>

<p>"Dear Argus," she scribbled, "the story <i>is</i> partly
true; but I doubt whether I should ever have
told it to you. We must wait, now, till it clears
itself up for us, <i>without your interference</i>. Tell
Roxalana I am quite ready to live in her service.
Keep Mr. Ford from the knowledge that the rumor
is abroad, and send for Tempe to-morrow."</p>

<p>Folding the note, she gave it, unsealed, to Chloe,
and pointed to the door: and Chloe did not dare
to disobey. She stopped on the door-mat an instant,
while putting it in her pocket, and whispered
to herself that she had found the best chance she
ever had in her life to despise <i>Chloe</i>; and she reckoned
she would make the most of it. She also
paused before the dining-room door, and it opened;
she and Sarah found themselves face to face. A
swift impulse seized Chloe; she pushed Sarah back
into the room, kicked the door behind them, and
with wiry hands set her into the depths of one of
the stuffed chairs, and stood over her.</p>

<p>"I shan't box yours ears yet," she hissed to the
amazed helpless girl, "but I <i>shall</i>, and maybe cut
out your tongue. I can do it, for the knives are
sharp here. What devil possessed you to bring
this dreadful trouble on missey? And Moses is
decent man enough to give you the sack, is he?
Glory for that!"</p>

<p>And shaking the breath out of her, Chloe asked
her why she didn't answer.</p>

<p>"I had a mind to do it, you black, evil thing; I
guess I've come up with them. That Mr. Carfield
always put me down; he called me a servant over
and over again. As for Miss Virginia, we shall see
if my lady, with her ten silk dresses, and her ten
breastpins, will flaunt it quite so high. Let me
alone; let me get up. He was in her bedroom,&mdash;I
saw him go in, and come out; and he stayed in
there. He was begging like a dog for something,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chloe would not allow her to go on, but fell upon
her with fury, striking her in the face with all the
strength she had.</p>

<p>"You may kill me," gasped Sarah, "but I won't
take back a word; and I'll have you taken up for
this,"</p>

<p>Mr. Brande opened the door as Chloe's rage had
exhausted itself, and Sarah was half-insensible with
the stinging blows she had received. He stood
amazed at the sight, but even then his ear caught
the sound of laughter and conversation going on
between Tempe and Mr. Carfield, and it disturbed
him.</p>

<p>"Why, Chloe," he said presently, "what in the
world does this mean? Can't you come on a visit,
even, to your old home, without bringing a surplus
of the old Adam."</p>

<p>"It means, sir, that the old Adam is too much
for men, when I meet him in your premises."</p>

<p>Sarah tried to get out of the chair, with loud
"Ohs."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said Chloe, "or I'll pound
your legs to jelly."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Mr. Brande could hardly help
a smile at Sarah's plight and Chloe's victorous attitude.</p>

<p>"You have got to own," continued Chloe, "before
you get out of that chair, what you have said
about Missey Brande."</p>

<p>"I've said the truth," she answered sullenly.</p>

<p>"Chloe," said Mr. Brande hastily, "I request you
to let Sarah go. She is hardly presentable just
now; the supper hour is at hand, and we are entirely
unaccustomed to such disturbance."

<p>"Such disturbance! Yes. Very well, sir. Go,
Sarah, I can give the particulars to Mr. Brande."</p>

<p>Sarah rushed, not only from the room but the
house, and did not return.</p>

<p>Within a month she married a Scotch workman,
one of the Forge hands, whom, for politic reasons,
Mr. Brande did not discharge afterwards. She
sent an invitation to Moses to come to her wedding,
written on a card ornamented with yellow doves, and
blue roses. Moses wrapped it in a piece of newspaper,
and put it away as an eternal remembrance
of the deceitfulness of females.</p>

<p>Mr. Brand, instead of being angry when Chloe
related what Sarah had done, fell into a fit of deep
musing. She waited to hear something from him;
not a word came. His usual restless hands and
slippery eyes were motionless. She never saw his
head hang so before; his eyes seemed to be fixed
upon something within his breast, and his chin
rested upon it. The French clock on the mantel-piece
ticked, and ran down. Once, she recollected,
the pendulum would not have had a minute's rest;
now he did not notice its silence. The fire was
disarranged, its embers fell against the fender, and
he did not rise with the old alacrity to replace them
over the dogs. An indescribable change had taken
place in that house since she had been there;
there was some subtle disorder prevailing which she
could not reason upon, but wondered whether it was
owing to him. At last remembering the necessity
of returning she said: "I believe my duty is done,
Mr. Brande."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied absently, "you can go. I will
attend to it. And, Chloe,&mdash;you had better come
back, hadn't you? don't she like you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir, I have made missey angry."</p>

<p>"Missey! I mean&mdash;oh,&mdash;ah; yes, you can go."</p>

<p>And he waved her out after the old fashion.</p>

<p>Argus saw her speeding along the path alone, and
said, when she came up to him: "It is not lucky
for me,&mdash;the Forge path; I have half a mind to
send you back."</p>

<p>"Not to-night. Captain. I have an answer, and
I know missey so well that I promise you she wishes
to hear a word from nobody this night."</p>

<p>"Now for my personal venture," he muttered as
they went back to Temple House.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE source of Mr. Brande's reverie was an astonished
admiration for Mr. Carfield, which
Chloe's revelation had excited. The boldness,
resolution, and satanic ingenuity of his plan, which
Mr. Brande decided was a meditated one, and that
Sarah had merely acted up to her instructions, gave
him a pang of envy, for he felt that in the capacity
for such conduct there must be also the capacity
for a bold, free, profound, conscienceless enjoyment,&mdash;the
very kind of enjoyment he could best
appreciate, and was too cowardly to attain. He
thought that if he had been present then he should
have turned Mr. Carfield out of doors, but he had
no impulse to do so now, even with the tones of his
forcible voice in hearing. As for the story, it must
be explained at the right moment. So far as Kent
was concerned, it should be put down in some high-handed
way; he would throw it in the teeth of the
society which he represented, or ride over their
necks with it. With Virginia two ways were open;
one was to consider her irretrievably committed,
the other was to break the engagement publicly,
which had never existed except between himself
and Mr. Carfield. In the latter case a hundred
thousand dollars would vanish from his grasp, and
a certain exposure take place, as mysteriously
brought about as this miserable business had been.
Tempe's gay laugh rose again over his cogitations.
Well, he would wait a little; he was quite used to
waiting in an uncertain, threatening atmosphere.
An inexplicable thought, reason, or sensation sent
him creeping upstairs to stand before Virginia's
door, and examine the panels and the lock like a
detective; he even laid his hand on the knob, but
hearing a movement within he turned away and
went back into the dining-room again. He found
Martha there, who had come to tell him that Sarah
had gone, leaving word that it was for good. He
replied with his usual suavity, that her behavior
carried its punishment, and gave instructions concerning
another servant whom Martha had in the
kitchen. He said that he should consider himself
indebted to her if she could arrange domestic affairs,
so that no change should be apparent. Martha was
overcome by his confidential condescension, and
promised to do her best.</p>

<p>"It will all blow over," she commented, bustling
back to her work; "it's stuff and nonsense to make
a rumpus about a mess of talk. Why, come murder,
arson, even, we have to get three meals a day
for them that does it, and them that doesn't."</p>

<p>All the long evening, and they sat up late, as if
some secret bond held them together, Mr. Brande
was divided in his mental scrutiny. He tried to
guess the state of Virginia's mind,&mdash;whether she
remembered the insult continually, either in sorrow
or anger; whether it had broken the barriers of
conventionality between her and Mr. Carfield, for
hate, or love and forgiveness. He watched Tempe's
careless flirtation with Mr. Carfield, and speculated
upon her probable conduct under the same circumstances
with&mdash;himself. His head reeled at this
thought. What possessed him?</p>

<p>"Virginia," he called, putting down a book he
had not read, "would it not be pleasant for you to
drive about town to-morrow, with Mrs. Drake, in the
new barouche?"</p>

<p>She looked up from her inseparable knitting, and
met his eye. He frowned involuntarily in the direction
of Mr. Carfield; an emotion of regret and
sympathy suddenly flitted into his face, and she
understood that he knew all about it; and how like
her calm, reasonable father it was&mdash;to remain so
quietly in the room with that wretch!</p>

<p>Her face was sad and fatigued; its expression
made him resolve vaguely to look over his accounts
the next day, and think about kicking Carfield
out.</p>

<p>"Why not?" cried Mr. Carfield; "I should like
to go, too."</p>

<p>"To-morrow I must go home," Tempe interposed.</p>

<p>"To-morrow Tempe must go home," echoed
Virginia.</p>

<p>"But," said Tempe, "I do not wish to go. I like
this house immensely; it is delightful. For two
days I have ceased to think there is an ugly, decayed
old house a couple of miles distant."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande felt hot about the heart; he started,
and went over to Tempe, seating himself beside
her, and looked at her with a goat-like fondness.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Mr. Carfield mischievously.
"I feel flattered for my portion in your good opinion."</p>

<p>Mr. Brande leaned towards Tempe, and said in
a low tone, "Won't you stay another day,&mdash;even at
the risk of flattering <i>me</i>,&mdash;and perhaps spoiling me
for a man of business?"</p>

<p>Virginia overheard this and felt painfully confused.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Mr. Carfield gaily, "this is a
pleasant home, Mrs. Drake; I intend to remain
here forever."</p>

<p>How Mr. Brande desired to make an answer
that would be a lesson, an intimation, and explanation,
which would include them all! Lacking subtlety,
however, he could only avail himself of the
commonplace.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Drake knows that I should be proud to
have her good opinion of anything in my possession.
I think, however, another charm might be
added to this spot."</p>

<p>"If anything agreeable could be added,&mdash;when
Mr. Carfield is here," she said, looking at Virginia.
"How came you to have so grand and stately a
daughter, Mr. Brande?"</p>

<p>"Don't you like the grand and stately?"</p>

<p>The accent of his voice made her look round
at him; her eyes opened wildly at the declaration
in his.</p>

<p>"Don't you, my dear?" he whispered, growing
violently red, his blood tingling like needles all
over him.</p>

<p>She was struck dumb, and remained so motionless
with her fixed eyes, that he concluded she was
purely receptive. He must own this little pet,
sooner or later, and he would indulge her as no
wife had ever been indulged; but she must&mdash;however,
this was not the moment, or the place to
make arrangements; he would wait.</p>

<p>"You are fond of reading, I think?" he asked,
taking up a book and fluttering the leaves. She
sighed with sheer surprise, and looking round to
rouse herself, saw Mr. Carfield at the back of Virginia's
chair, but did not hear what he was saying.
She set her face towards Mr. Brande, and said
abruptly, "I am fond of nothing."</p>

<p>He ventured to pinch her cheek with his cold
pointed fingers, and the touch of the velvet flesh
gave him a terrible shock; but he managed to
offer a superior smile, and whisper, "I knew you
would say all those petulant things, but I like
them."</p>

<p>"Virginia," said Mr. Carfield, "do you see what
an ass your father is making of himself with that
imp?"</p>

<p>Her head fell still lower over her work, but she
made no reply.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me? This weak nonsense must
be stopped before she utterly bewitches him. It is
a frightful joke, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She raised her hunted, despairing eyes, and said,
"Have you not learned yet that he always gains
his wishes? Why are <i>you</i> still here?"</p>

<p>"Stuff."</p>

<p>"If he decides to, he will marry her. The brilliant,
flame-loving, foolish little moth will yield to
the temptations of the position I despise, and can
not escape from."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and bent still nearer;
she felt his breath against her face. Her hands
shook so that the stitches dropped from her
needles; drops of sweat burst out of her forehead,
her lips parted, her teeth were set together, and
she was ghastly white.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," was her mental cry, "there is no
God! I hate my life."</p>

<p>Mr. Carfield watched her closely.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose, and stood for an instant in a
listening attitude.</p>

<p>"<i>Yes, there is!</i>" she cried in a loud voice.</p>

<p>They heard a murmur outside in the hall; the
outer door was closed with a crash, the inner door
flew open, and Sebastian Ford came in.</p>

<p>"I found what I missed in the pines," he said
significantly, addressing Virginia, and touching
his waistband. It was impossible for her to reply;
a slight hysterical noise came through her lips,
and she could not advance towards him a step.
Her arms were like leaden weights to her; only
by fixing her steadfast gaze upon his face could
she keep her footing. There was that in his bearing
which prevented ordinary salutation. Upon
his entrance Mr. Brande and Tempe rose involuntarily,
and the former would perhaps have come to
his fatuous speech if Tempe had not laid a silence-compelling
pressure upon his arm. Mr. Carfield
turned his hardest, haughtiest face towards him.</p>

<p>"We have been favored, Mr. Ford, with no specimen
of the Spanish melodrama till now. It is
much of an exotic; still we thank you for this fine
tableau,&mdash;&agrave; la brigand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It suits the occasion, and our necessity. I
have been down in Kent to-day, hearing in the
most public places, among the most common men,
of your vile intrusion at midnight, into the room
of Miss Brande&mdash;who is about to become the wife
of my friend, Argus Gates. Sir, you must now
make an explanation with your pen, which I shall
in these places, and among these men, make public.
Sir, will you do so?"</p>

<p>"Your threat is&mdash;what, a pistol?"</p>

<p>"I will kill you&mdash;but not here."</p>

<p>"The principal declines, does he,&mdash;and his second
offers to do the work?"</p>

<p>Sebastian smiled in so ugly a manner that Tempe
clasped her hands and said, "Oh!" and Mr.
Brande let his book fall.</p>

<p>"Argus is one with his race here. I <i>have</i> killed
a man. Moreover, he is ignorant of my wish, and
of my intention."</p>

<p>"<i>Sebastian</i>," murmured Virginia, in a faint, delicious,
cooing voice, a heavenly smile softening her
anguished face.</p>

<p>At its sound Mr. Carfield grew savage.</p>

<p>"She is to be my wife," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Brande was foolish enough to give a slight
nod at Sebastian, for which Tempe struck his
mouth with the back of her hand; he made no
further demonstration, though Mr. Carfield immediately
appealed to him to say whether the length
of the engagement which Virginia had tacitly permitted
did not warrant the sacredness of his
claim.</p>

<p>"You must lose her, sir," said Sebastian.</p>

<p>"A duel, of course, will lose her to me. And
are you so blind to our customs as to think that
my refusing to fight you will brand me as cowardly?"
asked Mr. Carfield.</p>

<p>"You are not a coward, except with women;
but if you will not fight me, I will assassinate you.
My life is at the service of my friend. Come, sir,
I will wait no longer. This parlor is no duelling
ground, but murder may be committed anywhere."

<p>His coolness, his assurance was terrible; the
menace in his voice, the deadly expression in his
eye, left Mr. Carfield in no doubt. But how was
it possible to yield Virginia to the demand of this
devil? Absolutely speaking, he was not afraid of
Sebastian, excepting that he was sure he had a
pistol concealed about him, and he did not desire
to be shot. To shoot <i>him</i> in a fair fight was impossible;
fists were not to be mentioned; but the
thought of being dogged by that implacable, sentimental
boy was carefully to be considered.</p>

<p>"I'll reflect a moment, Mr. Ford," he said.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room while he
walked up and down. He stopped presently before
Tempe, and deliberately scanned her; she did
her best to banish all vestige of expression from
her face, and succeeded tolerably well. Mr.
Brande looked upon him with anger.</p>

<p>"I am looking at you," said Mr. Carfield, "to
learn what my taste and fancy may do for me with
a different type of woman from the one I have lost
so much time with, and&mdash;Brande, excuse me,&mdash;so
much money."

<p>He crossed the room, and came face to face with
Virginia, and it startled him to see in her face an
expression as determined and as fatal as Sebastian's.
The support she required had come.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "how the matter came out I can
not say; circumstances have proved stronger than
the mad impulse that sent me to you that night.
By the God that made me, Virginia, I would only
have forestalled the clergyman's benediction&mdash;the
benediction your good father demanded, and which
your pious soul would have entreated for <i>afterwards</i>."</p>

<p>Sebastian shuddered; an awful echo went through
his spirit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ford, what do you demand?" he asked,
wheeling round.</p>

<p>"Write for me the words I have asked for."</p>

<p>Virginia pointed to a little morocco case on a
stand, and Mr. Carfield drew out some paper, upon
which he wrote a clear and concise explanation,
sparing himself nowhere; for he thought there must
be a settlement with Brande, and the plainer his
apology, the clearer the public would see that a
business separation must take place, and he might
get his money again.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, handing the paper to Sebastian,
"can the curtain drop on this little farce? At another
time, to-morrow, perhaps, if the same audience
comes together, we may enact the same with
spectacular improvements. Allow me sir, to see
you to the door."</p>

<p>Sebastian, tucking the note in his waistband,
smiled again.</p>

<p>"Receive my thanks for the honor you have done,
and accept my excuses for the duty thrust upon
me."</p>

<p>They both bowed.</p>

<p>Sebastian looked with an expression of entreaty
at Virginia, which she comprehended.</p>

<p>"It is very late, Mr. Ford. May I ask you to
spend the remainder of the night with us?"</p>

<p>He turned to Mr. Brande, who, not possessing any
taste for the dramatic, was unequal to the occasion,
and merely mumbled a word or two, seconding her
invitation. Mr. Carfield left the room.</p>

<p>"A moment," begged Sebastian, darting out, and
opening the outer door.</p>

<p>"Mat," he whispered, "here it is. Take the
paper to the Captain. I won't trust the hound
here to-night."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir. Has he come to the scratch?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Sebastian; "but he is not
scratched, I assure you."</p>

<p>Mat laughed, dashed into the darkness, and ran
all the way to Temple House.</p>

<p>"It was all a contrived plan between him and
me," said Mat triumphantly. "Blarsted if Mr.
Ford ain't as good as an earthquake and a priest
put together."</p>

<p>"Damn him," said Argus sharply, "he has paid
his debt to me."</p>

<p>"Now you will be married?"</p>

<p>"Now I shall be married," Argus replied rather
dreamily.</p>

<p>"Now we shall be able to carry on Temple
House?" added Mat, with an anxious accent.</p>

<p>"Now," Argus answered, with an utterly abstracted
voice, "we shall carry on Temple House."</p>
