<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Knickerbocker Magazine</span> has been established for
nearly a quarter of a century, and it is the oldest monthly
of its class now or ever in America. It has been conducted
with uniform ability and industry, and among its contributors
have been a large proportion of our best contemporary
writers. Our periodical literature has not been eminently
successful, and the friends of the veteran and popular editor
of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> have known without surprise, but
with regret, that his pecuniary recompense has been altogether
disproportioned to his long-continued labors, so that only a
loving devotion to the work, which he has led from its
infancy up to a famous maturity, could have induced him to
persevere in those toils which, otherwise applied, would have
brought a suitable reward of fortune.</p>

<p>The popular actor on the stage receives from the public
substantial "benefits," and the painter or sculptor whose
productions have been more celebrated than profitable,
not unfrequently collects them in an exhibition which the
lovers of art gladly support for his sake as well as for its
attractive merits; but the editor has no such resort, as a test
of the popular good-will for him, nor any extraordinary
means of making up the deficits of a season in which what
the world owes him has been withheld.</p>

<p>It seemed appropriate, in the case of Mr. <span class="smcap">Louis Gaylord
Clark</span>, to disregard precedents of neglect, and to offer him
a testimonial of the esteem in which he is held by his <i>collaborateurs</i>
that should be both pleasing as a compliment and
valuable as a contribution to his means of happiness. It was
proposed that the surviving writers for the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>
should each furnish, gratuitously, an article, and that the collection
should be issued in a volume of tasteful elegance, of
which the entire avails should be appropriated in building,
on the margin of the Hudson, a cottage, suitable for the home
of a man of letters, who, like Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, is also a lover of
nature and of rural life.</p>

<p>The editorial preparation of this volume was undertaken
by <span class="smcap">John W. Francis, George P. Morris, Rufus W. Griswold,
Richard B. Kimball</span>, and <span class="smcap">Frederick W. Shelton</span>;
their circular to the old contributors of the Magazine was met,
in all cases, by a ready and generous response; and they
submit the result in confidence that a literary miscellany of
its kind has rarely, if ever, been published of which the contents
are more various or uniformly excellent.</p>

<h3 id="c01">Conversations with Talma.</h3>

<p>FROM ROUGH NOTES IN A COMMON-PLACE BOOK.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE SKETCH-BOOK.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>April</i> 25, 1821.&mdash;Made a call with a friend, this morning,
to be introduced to Talma, the great French tragedian. He has a
suite of apartments in a hotel in the Rue Des Petites Augustines,
but is about to build a town residence. He has also a country
retreat a few miles from Paris, of which he is extremely fond, and
is continually altering and improving it. He had just arrived from
the country, and his apartment was rather in confusion, the furniture
out of place, and books lying about. In a conspicuous part of the
saloon was a colored engraving of John Philip Kemble, for whom
he expresses great admiration and regard.</p>

<p>Talma is about five feet seven or eight inches, English, in height,
and somewhat robust. There is no very tragic or poetic expression
in his countenance; his eyes are of a bluish gray, with, at times, a
peculiar cast; his face is rather fleshy, yet flexible; and he has a short
thick neck. His manners are open, animated, and natural. He
speaks English well, and is prompt, unreserved, and copious in conversation.</p>

<p>He received me in a very cordial manner, and asked if this was
my first visit to Paris. I told him I had been here once before, about
fourteen years since.</p>

<p>"Ah! that was the time of the Emperor!" cried he, with a sudden
gleam of the eye.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;just after his coronation as King of Italy."</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>"Ah! those were the heroic days of Paris&mdash;every day some new
victory! The real chivalry of France rallied round the Emperor; the
youth, and talent, and bravery of the nation. Now you see the courts
of the Tuileries crowded by priests, and an old, worn-out nobility
brought back by foreign bayonets."</p>

<p>He consoled himself by observing, that the national character had
improved under its reverses. Its checks and humiliations had made
the nation more thoughtful. "Look at the young men from the colleges,"
said he, "how serious they are in their demeanor. They walk
together in the public promenades, conversing always on political subjects,
but discussing politics philosophically and scientifically. In fact,
the nation is becoming as grave as the English."</p>

<p>He thinks, too, that there is likely to be a great change in the
French drama. "The public," said he, "feel greater interest in
scenes that come home to common life, and in the fortunes of every-day
people, than in the distresses of the heroic personages of classic
antiquity. Hence, they never come to the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, excepting
to see a few great actors, while they crowd to the minor theatres
to witness representations of scenes in ordinary life. The revolution,"
added he, "has caused such vivid and affecting scenes to pass
before their eyes, that they can no longer be charmed by fine periods
and declamation. They require character, incident, passion, life."</p>

<p>He seems to apprehend another revolution, and that it will be a
bloody one. "The nation," said he, "that is to say, the younger
part of it, the <i>children of the revolution</i>, have such a hatred of the
priests and the <i>noblesse</i>, that they would fly upon them like wolves
upon sheep."</p>

<p>On coming away, he accompanied us to the door. In passing
through the ante-chamber, I pointed to children's swords and soldiers'
caps lying on a table. "Ah!" cried he, with animation, "the amusements
of the children now-a-days are all military. They will have
nothing to play with but swords, guns, drums, and trumpets."</p>

<p>Such are the few brief notes of my first interview with Talma.
Some time afterward I dined in company with him at Beauvillier's
restaurant. He was in fine spirits: gay and earnest by turns, and
always perfectly natural and unreserved.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>He spoke with pleasure of his residence in England. He liked
the English. They were a noble people; but he thought the French
more amiable and agreeable to live among. "The intelligent and
cultivated English," he said, "are disposed to do generous actions,
but the common people are not so liberal as the same class among
the French: they have bitter national prejudices." If a French prisoner
escaped in England, the common people would be against him.
In France it was otherwise. "When the fight was going on around
Paris," said he, "and Austrian and other prisoners were brought in
wounded, and conducted along the Boulevards, the Parisian populace
showed great compassion for them, and gave them money, bread, and
wine."</p>

<p>Of the liberality of the cultivated class of English he gave an anecdote.
Two French prisoners had escaped from confinement, and
made their way to a sea-port, intending to get over in a boat to France.
All their money, however, was exhausted, and they had not wherewithal
to hire a boat. Seeing a banker's name on a door, they went
in, stated their case frankly, and asked for pecuniary assistance, promising
to repay it faithfully. The banker at once gave them one hundred
pounds. They offered a bill, or receipt, but he declined it. "If
you are not men of honor," said he "such paper would be of no value;
and if you are men of honor, there is no need of it," This circumstance
was related to Talma by one of the parties thus obliged.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, we talked of the theatre. Talma had
been a close observer of the British stage, and was alive to many of
its merits. He spoke of his efforts to introduce into French acting
the familiar style occasionally used by the best English tragedians;
and of the difficulties he encountered in the stately declamation and
constantly-recurring rhymes of French tragedy. Still he found, he
said, every familiar touch of nature immediately appreciated and
applauded by the French audiences. Of Shakspeare he expressed the
most exalted opinion, and said he should like to attempt some of his
principal characters in English, could he be sure of being able to render
the text without a foreign accent. He had represented his character
of Hamlet, translated into French, in the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais with
great success; but he felt how much more powerful it would be if

<!-- page 18 -->

given as Shakspeare had written it. He spoke with admiration of the
individuality of Shakspeare's characters, and the varied play of his
language, giving such a scope for familiar touches of pathos and tenderness
and natural outbreaks of emotion and passion. "All this,"
he observed, "requires quite a different style of acting from the well-balanced
verse, flowing periods, and recurring rhymes of the French
drama; and it would, doubtless, require much study and practice to
catch the spirit of it; and after all," added he, laughing, "I should
probably fail. Each stage has its own peculiarities which belong to
the nation, and can not be thoroughly caught, nor perhaps thoroughly
appreciated by strangers."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>[To the foregoing scanty notes were appended some desultory
observations made at the time, and suggested by my conversations
with Talma. They were intended to form the basis of some speculations
on the French literature of the day, which were never carried
out. They are now given very much in the rough style in which they
were jotted down, with some omissions and abbreviations, but no
heightenings nor additions.]</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The success of a translation of Hamlet in the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais
appears to me an era in the French drama. It is true, the play has
been sadly mutilated and stripped of some of its most characteristic
beauties in the attempt to reduce it to the naked stateliness of the
pseudo-classic drama; but it retains enough of the wild magnificence of
Shakspeare's imagination to give it an individual character on the
French stage. Though the ghost of Hamlet's father does not actually
tread the boards, yet it is supposed to hover about his son, unseen by
other eyes; and the admirable acting of Talma conveys to the audience
a more awful and mysterious idea of this portentous visitation than
could be produced by any visible spectre. I have seen a lady carried
fainting from the boxes, overcome by its effect upon her imagination.

<!-- page 19 -->

In this translation and modification of the original play, Hamlet's
mother stabs herself before the audience, a catastrophe hitherto
unknown on the grand theatre, and repugnant to the French idea of
classic rule.</p>

<p>The popularity of this play is astonishing. On the evenings of its
representation the doors of the theatre are besieged at an early hour.
Long before the curtain rises, the house is crowded to overflowing;
and throughout the performance the audience passes from intervals of
breathless attention to bursts of ungovernable applause.</p>

<p>The success of this tragedy may be considered one of the triumphs
of what is denominated the romantic school; and another has been furnished
by the overwhelming reception of Marie Stuart, a modification
of the German tragedy of Schiller. The critics of the old school are
sadly alarmed at these foreign innovations, and tremble for the ancient
decorum and pompous proprieties of their stage. It is true, both
Hamlet and Marie Stuart have been put in the strait waistcoat of
Aristotle; yet they are terribly afraid they will do mischief, and set
others madding. They exclaim against the apostasy of their countrymen
in bowing to foreign idols, and against the degeneracy of their
taste, after being accustomed from infancy to the touching beauties
and harmonious numbers of Athalie, Polyeucte, and Merope, in relishing
these English and German monstrosities, and that through the
medium of translation. All in vain! The nightly receipts at the doors
outweigh, with managers, all the invectives of the critics, and Hamlet
and Marie Stuart maintain triumphant possession of the boards.</p>

<p>Talma assures me that it begins to be quite the fashion in France
to admire Shakspeare; and those who can not read him in English
enjoy him diluted in French translations.</p>

<p>It may at first create a smile of incredulity that foreigners should
pretend to feel and appreciate the merits of an author, so recondite at
times as to require commentaries and explanations, even to his own
countrymen; yet it is precisely writers like Shakspeare, so full of
thought, of character, and passion, that are most likely to be relished,
even when but partially understood. Authors whose popularity arises
from beauty of diction and harmony of numbers are ruined by translation;
a beautiful turn of expression, a happy combination of words

<!-- page 20 -->

and phrases, and all the graces of perfect euphony, are limited to the
language in which they are written. Style can not be translated.
The most that can be done is to furnish a parallel, and render grace
for grace. Who can form an idea of the exquisite beauties of Racine,
when translated into a foreign tongue? But Shakspeare triumphs over
translation. His scenes are so exuberant in original and striking
thoughts, and masterly strokes of nature, that he can afford to be
stripped of all the magic of his style. His volumes are like the magician's
cave in Aladdin, so full of jewels and precious things, that he
who does but penetrate for a moment may bring away enough to
enrich himself.</p>

<p>The relish for Shakspeare, however, which, according to Talma, is
daily increasing in France, is, I apprehend, but one indication of a
general revolution which is taking place in the national taste. The
French character, as Talma well, observes, has materially changed
during the last thirty years. The present generation, (the "children
of the revolution," as Talma terms them,) who are just growing into
the full exercise of talent, are a different people from the French of the
old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. They have grown up in rougher times, and among more
adventurous and romantic habitudes. They are less delicate in tact,
but stronger in their feelings, and require more stimulating aliment.
The Frenchman of the camp, who has bivouacked on the Danube and
the Volga; who has brought back into peaceful life the habits of the
soldier; who wears fierce moustaches, swaggers in his gait, and smokes
tobacco, is, of course, a different being in his literary tastes from the
Frenchman of former times, who was refined, but finical in dress and
manners, wore powder, and delighted in perfumes and polished versification.</p>

<p>The whole nation, in fact, has been accustomed for years to the glitter
of arms and the parade of soldiery; to tales of battles, sieges, and
victories. The feverish drama of the revolution, and the rise and fall
of Napoleon, have passed before their eyes like a tale of Arabian
enchantment. Though these realities have passed away, the remembrances
of them remain, with a craving for the strong emotions which
they excited.</p>

<p>This may account in some measure for that taste for the romantic

<!-- page 21 -->

which is growing upon the French nation&mdash;a taste vehemently but
vainly reprobated by their critics. You see evidence of it in every
thing: in their paintings; in the engravings which fill their print-shops;
in their songs, their spectacles, and their works of fiction. For several
years it has been making its advances without exciting the jealousy
of the critics; its advances being apparently confined to the lower
regions of literature and the arts. The circulating libraries have
been filled with translations of English and German romances,
and tales of ghosts and robbers, and the theatres of the Boulevards
occupied by representations of melo-dramas. Still the higher
regions of literature remained unaffected, and the national theatre
retained its classic stateliness and severity. The critics consoled
themselves with the idea that the romances were only read by
women and children, and the melo-dramas admired by the ignorant
and vulgar. But the children have grown up to be men and
women; and the tinge given to their imaginations in early life is now
to have an effect on the forthcoming literature of the country. As
yet, they depend for their romantic aliment upon the literature of
other nations, especially the English and Germans; and it is astonishing
with what promptness the Scottish novels, notwithstanding their
dialects, are translated into French, and how universally and eagerly
they are sought after.</p>

<p>In poetry, Lord Byron is the vogue: his verses are translated into
a kind of stilted prose, and devoured with ecstasy, they are <i>si sombre!</i>
His likeness is in every print-shop. The Parisians envelop him
with melancholy and mystery, and believe him to be the hero of his
own poems, or something of the vampyre order. A French poem
has lately appeared in imitation of him,* the author of which has
caught, in a great degree, his glowing style, and deep and troubled
emotions. The great success of this production insures an inundation
of the same kind of poetry from inferior hands. In a little while we
shall see the petty poets of France, like those of England, affecting
to be moody and melancholy, each wrapping himself in a little
mantle of mystery and misanthropy, vaguely accusing himself of
heinous crimes, and affecting to despise the world.</p>

<p>That this taste for the romantic will have its way, and give a
decided tone to French literature, I am strongly inclined to believe.
The human mind delights in variety, and abhors monotony even in
excellence. Nations, like individuals, grow sated with artificial refinements,
and their pampered palates require a change of diet, even though
it be for the worse. I should not be surprised, therefore, to see the
French breaking away from rigid rule; from polished verse, easy
narrative, the classic drama, and all the ancient delights of elegant literature,
and rioting in direful romances, melo-dramatic plays, turgid
prose, and glowing rough-written poetry.</p>

    Each with its leafy crown;
Hark! from their sides a thousand rills

<p class="stanza">A thousand rills; they leap and shine,
    Strained through the mossy nooks,
Till, clasped in many a gathering twine,
    They swell a hundred brooks.</p>

<p class="stanza">A hundred brooks; and still they run
    With ripple, shade, and gleam,
Till, clustering all their braids in one,

<p class="stanza">A bracelet, spun from mountain mist,
    A silvery sash unwound,
With ox-bow curve and sinuous twist,

Fear not; one body makes it dip,

We see whate'er its pages tell,

The linnet sings as there he sung;

    Her elm with drooping spray;
She wears her mountain diadem

Yon trunk had thrice a hundred rings,

<p>A REMINISCENCE OF KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY REV. SAMUEL OSGOOD.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> profession or business has its own peculiar experiences,
and it has often seemed to me that the world of readers would be
wiser, and they who make books for them would be far more interesting
and instructive, if every writer would describe things from his
own actual point of view, trying honestly to hold the mirror up to
nature and life with his own hand from his own position. The genuine
diary of a physician, or lawyer, or clergyman, or merchant, or
banker, if recording his own impressions during his years of activity,
would be as interesting as any fictitious sketches, and far more
instructive, whether to the old who are always glad to fight their battles
over again, or to the young whose battles have not yet begun. I
do not make this remark by way of preface to any ambitious portraitures
of professional scenes and labors, but merely to introduce a few
slight sketches of professional travel that seem quite as well fitted for
the present purpose as any more elaborate essay.</p>

<p>I have just returned from a visit to Kentucky after an absence of
seventeen years. I was at the city of L&mdash;&mdash; at various times in the
years 1836-37, and have never forgotten the impression left by the
place and the people. The first years of a minister's professional life
are far more significant than those of any other profession; for usually
he takes upon himself the full burden of his cares, and in most cases
he has as much labor and anxiety at twenty-five as at fifty. In one
respect, indeed, he has more care at the outset of his career; for he is

<!-- page 28 -->

obliged to depend each week upon the fresh coinage of his own brain,
instead of falling back upon the large literary capital accumulated by
a veteran sermon-writer. The consequence is that the first two or
three years of a preacher's life are quite likely to decide his destiny,
and if he does not break down within this period after his settlement,
he is pretty well seasoned and stocked for subsequent needs. It is
advisable, therefore, on many accounts, that he should take what the
Germans call his "Wanderjahre," and travel a year or two before
pitching his tent for permanence. Travel merely for pleasure, or for
general information, is dangerous to a young man's habits of study
and sobriety of purpose, whilst travel with professional aims, for
periods of service for a few weeks or months in different places, gives
him a wide field of observation, and prepares him for his parish duties
alike as a man of practical experience and of literary resources. I
remember very well the events of the two years passed in this way,
and have been inclined to ascribe the good health and constant labor
of the long time since to the influence of those years of wandering. I
visited, in some way, almost every State in the Union, and in various
cities and towns remained several weeks, and in a few cases several
months. No place lingers more fondly in memory than the city of
L&mdash;&mdash;, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Contrast is one of the laws of sympathy, and there is something
in the electric beat of the Southern pulse quite fascinating to a young
man educated under the sedate discipline of New-England, and taught
to depend upon cool reasoning as the only sure path to the convictions
of his audience. Most of our young theological students of the
more ambitious kind, put study and thought enough into their first
sermon to expand into a whole volume, forgetful of the fact that it
is the emotional life that gives the sermon its power, and that, without
this, the gun "ecclesiastic," however crammed with balls or shot,
has no powder, and can not be fired. A Southern audience is sure to
teach a young man this fact, and, whilst fond of clear reasoning, it is
so greedy for fervor in feeling and utterance, as to have little patience
with the speaker who does not meet this want. The tone of social
life is somewhat in the same spirit, and nothing can more successfully

<!-- page 29 -->

take the stiffness out of the manners and conversation of our Northern
scholastics than a few months sojourn in hearty Southern society.
I remember very well the first impression of Kentucky life. Faults
there were in abundance to note, deficiencies of culture, radical errors
in the political and domestic order, yet the sternest censor could not
but be captivated by the cordiality of the people, and even soften his
censure into sympathy, when he found that they were quite as ready
to perceive and lament their failings as he could be. From the first
hearty shake of the hand from a Kentuckian on the crowded landing
to the hearty farewells that speeded the parting guest upon his homeward
way months afterward, the same genial pulse seemed to beat.
It would be quite as wrong to regard this impulsive warmth of manner
as mere affectation of generosity, as it would be wrong to regard the
colder temper of Northern men as proof of habitual selfishness. The
climate has much to do with the temperament, and it is undoubtedly
the union of Southern impulsiveness with the daring self-reliance
incident to a border life that has given the Kentuckian his peculiar
air and tone.</p>

<p>So far as I could see, the same electric temper appeared in every
sphere of life, certainly in the serious as well as in the festive sphere.
If in the conduct of business, especially of agricultural business, there
were some tokens of the easy gait so characteristic of people accustomed
to be served by slaves, no trace of languor showed itself when
ever men met together upon any interesting occasion, whether grave
or gay. A revival preacher, or a stump orator, could have no occasion
to complain of dull listeners. The chat of an evening party had
none of the stately reserve so affected by English mannerists nearer
home, but seemed downright earnest, as if society were a genuine
business, and very pleasant business, too. I remember the perfect
<i>furore</i> that prevailed during one of those semi-barbarous races which
are a kind of relic of the ancient tournament, with this difference, that
the man is but a spectator, and leaves the honors and the pains of the
struggle to his horse. The whole city was in commotion, and the
rage of betting infected the servants and slaves. The little fellow
that brushed our clothes at the boarding-house, swelled into the consequence
of a gentleman of the turf, as he staked his half-dollar with a
comrade of like hue and stature, whilst the august head of Henry

<!-- page 30 -->

Clay, then in his prime, towered up among the sporting magnates on
the stand erected for the judges of the course. All Kentucky and all
Tennessee seemed to be embodied in those rival racers, and every
Kentuckian felt an inch taller when his own pet came in the winner.
Absurd as this excitement seemed to a Northern man, so cruel to the
horses, and so little profitable to the spectators, it was not difficult to
read it as a text from the old book of human nature. From the very
beginning, the rivalries of men and nations have turned more upon
the pride of conquest than the prize contested, and whether for an
oaken crown or a silver cup, whether upon the race-course or the battle-field,
it is the name more than the game that is played tor. He
that would moralize largely and wisely about a horse-race would
come to some very sweeping conclusions regarding the whole system
of competition that rules over society, and strike hard at the habits
of many very grave people.</p>

<p>The social elements that presented themselves to a stranger's
observation in various circles, were in many respects of the most
heterogeneous kind, yet seemed all pervaded by the same stirring
leaven. The New-Englander and the Englishman, with their cool
temperament, caught much of the prevailing tone of geniality, without
losing their characteristic calculation. One of the most delightful and
hearty men in the social walk was an English gentleman who had
come out to seek his fortune with a young wife and slender patrimony
in that then far country. The brother of one of our most ideal
and gifted poets, he did not lose sight of the ideal world in the prosaic
business of a lumber-merchant, He was always ready for a literary
conversation, and took delight, at any time, in turning from his
ledger to his library, and from numbers arithmetical to numbers
poetical. I never meet with the portrait of John Keats now, without
tracing in his features and expression a memento of this emigrant brother,
who never ceased to prove that he was of kindred blood to the
author of "Endymion" and "The Eve of St. Agnes." He is not living
now, but his image stands in my memory among the cherished
forms that can not be forgotten. I might add many other names to
the list of notables, but it is enough to specify one person more whose
acquaintance enlarged my knowledge of human character.</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>Judge S&mdash;&mdash; was a noble specimen of a gentleman of the old
school&mdash;of the most transparent simplicity, thorough honesty in deed
and word, and unswerving independence. I remember well the first
time of meeting him. His quaint old carriage drove up to the door
of our lodgings, and the vehicle and the occupant looked like specimens
of the good old days gone by. It was worth a thousand miles'
travel to receive such a shake of the hand, and such an invitation to
visit him at his plantation. His eye had an almost feminine mildness,
yet in its affectionate expression there was a latent manliness as
in the mild blue sky. above whose transparent depths the Sun-God has
his throne, and can thence at will launch his arrows at their mark.
It was quite a new phase of life that the days spent on his plantation
disclosed. Never have I seen more affection between the various
members of a family; never a more earnest purpose to be just and
kind in every social relation. The Judge was no admirer of slavery,
and if the counsels of such men as he had prevailed, the curse of bondage
would, ere this, have been erased from the statute-book of Kentucky.
He aimed, so far as the laws allowed him, to abolish slavery
in his own domain, by exchanging servitude for service, and treating
his dependents as servants to be protected. They looked upon him
with great affection, and could honestly pray that he might live a
thousand years. When an absent son returned, it was a rare sight to
see the welcome of him by the slaves the morning after his arrival.
They seemed all to claim kindred with him, and their cordial greeting
to Master Josh was a better commentary than any antiquarian notes
upon the redeeming features of the old patriarchal times. In becoming
acquainted with the slaves, one marks quite as wide differences of
character as among their prouder lords. I found in the two who took
charge of the horses, genuine representatives of characters that have
stamped their mark upon the world's history. The coachman was a
thorough-going mystic, a believer in visions and trances, which he
interpreted to auditors, who listened with open ears and distended
eyes.  He was a preacher, as he and his admirers thought, of heaven's
own ordaining; and, although occasionally somewhat given to excessive
potations, his hearers, with an acuteness equal to that of many
pious white people under similar circumstances, carefully distinguished

<!-- page 32 -->

between the infirmities of the man and the inspirations of the
saint. The hostler, Cato, was of sterner school, and not at all addicted
to mysticism, or any kind of faith or devotion. He was the skeptic
of the plantation, and might have astonished the author of the "Vestiges
of Creation" by his constant reference of remarkable phenomena
to natural causes. When Morocco, the coachman, would discourse of
the falling stars as sure signs that the world was coming to an end,
Cato would contemptuously shrug his shoulders, and say that it was
"nothing but the brimstone in the air." The mystic seemed to have
more followers than the skeptic, and when the Judge tried to entertain
his guests by excavating an Indian mound upon his plantation,
and evening shut in before the close of the labor, the sable excavators
evidently inclined to Morocco's opinion that the wizard-hour had
come, when the spirits of the dead Indians haunted their graves, and
it was time to stop working there.</p>

<p>Many scenes stand associated with that kindly home. One fairy
little form that graced the house and garden walks I can never forget;
the bright child who cheered us by her naive prattle and her sylph-like
dance. Her form lingered like a benediction upon the memory;
and when word of her death came to me, years afterward, it was as if
one of the lights of our own household had been quenched. When,
in the March of 1837, I left Kentucky, and parted with so many
cherished friends, of the whole circle none gave more brightness to the
hope of a return, ere long, than the kindly group who dwelt under the
tall trees of that plantation, and day by day received the good judge's
blessing. My course was homeward to New-England by the circuitous
Southern route; and in the five days after the departure, every
variety of climate between winter and summer presented itself, until
in New-Orleans I found fruits and flowers in abundance, under a sky
as sultry as when our dog-star rages. In due season I returned to
New-England to find its forests leafless, its gardens still waiting the
footsteps of the golden summer that I had left at the South. Years
passed, and with them passed many schemes for visiting old friends at
the West and South. Only after seventeen years' absence the opportunity
came, and I have just returned from Kentucky and the kindly
city of L&mdash;&mdash;, which I saw for the first time eighteen years ago.</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>Every man who has any sort of affection or sentiment is glad to
re-visit familiar scenes; yet, there is something startling in the return
after long absence. We think of all that we have done and endured
during the interval, and our own daily life, with its constant yet
almost unnoticed changes, rises up before us in its united experience;
so that a man sometimes needs to go away from home to see himself
as he is and has been in his own home. There are few men who can
look upon the form and feature of a score of years thus consolidated
by distance without some grave thoughts upon life and its changes.
We tremble, moreover, as we draw near the places and friends so
long unvisited. We fear that we have been shaping an ideal world
out of the materials stored up by our memory, and that things and
persons will seem wholly strange to us. We fear that more friends
than we have heard of have passed away, and that they who remain
will not remember us as we remember them.</p>

<p>When our steamer drew near the city of L&mdash;&mdash;, the spires of some
of the churches were familiar to my eye, and the whole face of the
country seemed to answer the absentee's grateful recognition. The
city had more than doubled its population, and stretched itself out on
either side of its domain; yet it had only grown in stature, without
having essentially changed its features. The landing was crowded by
the same motley throng as of old, and it is only when the stranger
sees the new squares of stately houses in the remoter streets that he
appreciates the growth and prosperity of the place. But what avails
a familiar scene if there is no welcome from a familiar friend? It
was somewhat remarkable that the first face that I recognized was that
of the son of my kind host of former years, the good Judge; and it
was cheering to learn, from our ready and mutual recognition, that
Father Time had not so set his marks upon our features as to hide
the familiar lineaments. In a half-hour, the hearty welcome from his
sisters, two of whom kept house together in the city, was ample assurance
that the light of other days had not died out, and that the father's
kind heart still animated the children, even as when he was with them
in the body. The welcome was not limited to the parlor, but came also
from the tenants of the kitchen. The old farm-servants were not indeed
there, and Morocco and Cato, with many of their associates, had gone

<!-- page 34 -->

to the land where the law of color and caste does not rule, but the
smart serving-maid, who had grown from a child to a stout woman
during the interval, seemed to have some remembrance of the ancient
guest at the old plantation; and the little boy, Bob, who presided at
the brush, grinned with all his might when I talked to him of his Uncle
Morocco, as if we were friends and kindred at once by that tie of
association.</p>

<p>Our stay in the city was a succession of delightful recognitions,
deepened yet not wholly saddened by remembrances of those who
had passed away. Our religious services renewed all the best associations
of former years, and for five days the hours were too few for
the discourses, devotions, and discussions which engaged the conference
of worshippers, met together from so many States. It is not the
place to describe the theological aspects of the occasion, and I will only
give a description or two of social experiences.</p>

<p>An observing man could write a good treatise upon the chronology
of the human features or the traces of time left upon the human
countenance by various periods of years. This visit has given a far
milder idea of the ravages of this ruthless power. My friends who
were in early manhood eighteen years ago are now in their prime;
their look is the same as then, nay, even more decidedly pronounced,
and, like Pat's portrait, "more like than the original." They who
were in the meridian then are now of more venerable mien, yet not
one such face had any trait that did not seem familiar and agreeable.
The feminine complexion is indeed a more delicate chronicle of times
and experiences; yet the many buxom mothers in whom I recognized
the sprightly girls of eighteen years ago were but the same flowers in
fuller bloom; and I more than once, in view of a worthy mother with
a group of a half-dozen children about her, was reminded of the favorite
theory, that even personal beauty is more a moral than a physical
attribute, and ripens, instead of dying, with years of faithful service to
life's true ideal. What Dante said of Beatrice in Paradise is true of
every woman who does her work nobly and keeps her soul unspotted
from the world. There is a "second beauty," even fairer than the
first&mdash;a beauty radiating from a life beyond that of youthful bloom.

<!-- page 35 -->

The angels are calling on every fair woman in this world, as upon
Beatrice in the spiritual world:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" '<span class="smcap">Turn, Beatrice!</span>' was their song: 'Oh! turn
Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one.
Gracious at our prayer, vouchsafe
Unveil to him thy cheeks; that he may mark
Thy second beauty, now concealed.' "</p>

</div>

<p>Setting all merely poetic sentiment aside, is it not true that the
beauty that most transforms the character, and refines and softens the
husband and subdues and educates the child, is that which beams from
a face in which girlish bloom has ripened into womanly fidelity and
benignity? Whilst contesting thus the boasted empire of Time over
the countenance, it must be confessed that, in one respect, his transforming
power was most startling. In seventeen years, the infant of
the cradle grows to full stature, and the absentee felt, on his return,
somewhat of a Nestor in age as he was greeted by two fair girls who
were babies at his previous visit, and who, for their honored and
lamented father's sake, were ready to receive him with something of
filial deference.</p>

<p>One scene more only can be noted&mdash;a re-visit to the plantation
of our old friend already so affectionately named. We rode out&mdash;a
goodly company of guests&mdash;to that house so memorable for its
unstinted hospitality. The Judge was not there to welcome us with
his hearty grasp and benign eye. His daughter, however, fitly honored
her name and breeding as she welcomed her father's friends. Many
changes had taken place in the grounds on account of the division of
the property and the encroachments of the city upon the country; but
the house, with its lofty rooms, was the same, and the gateway and
broad green-sward of the great avenue were as of old. The most conspicuous
change was presented by the family burial-place, now inclosed
by a massive wall. We all went reverently to that hallowed ground.
I stood over the grave of the noble father and the dear child, the pet
of the former visit, who gave such light to that home, and blessed <span class="smcap">God</span>
for the treasure of such a remembrance and such a hope. The myrtle
covered those graves with its rich and aromatic growth, and birds of

<!-- page 36 -->

many hues and notes sang in the branches of the trees. A venerable
clergyman, who had known and honored the good Judge, spoke words
of consolation to the large company of children, grand-children and
friends, and, leaning upon his staff, lifted his voice in prayer. But
even this touching ministration added little to the pathos of that scene.
The place, with those tomb-stones, was enough and more than enough.
I could hardly listen to language touching and spiritual as that which
sought so fitly to consecrate that sun-set hour among the dead. Those
buried ones spoke to me with a living voice that rose above the sad
dirges chanted by the shades of all those intervening years. From
the midst of that garden of graves, where blooming life sprang from
the decaying dust, a voice from the unseen world repeated the great
prophet's saying:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">The</span> grass withereth, the flower fadeth:
But the word of our <span class="smcap">God</span> shall stand for ever."</p>

</div>

<p>The years that had gone since meeting those cherished friends seemed
to rise before me, and to chant a requiem which mingled the solemnity
of memory with the cheerfulness of hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is not a prettier valley in Switzerland than that of Lauterbrunnen.
Whoever has seen it upon a fine day of summer, when the
meadows were green, the streams full, and the sun shining upon the
crystal glaciers which lie, from the beginning to the end of the year,
at the head of the valley, can never forget it.</p>

<p>I do not think it can be more than a half-mile broad; and in many
places, I am sure, it is much less. On one side, the rocks, brown and
jagged, and tufted with straggling shrubs, rise almost perpendicularly;
and a stream of water which comes from higher slopes, far out
of sight, leaps over the edge of the precipice. At first, it is a solid
column of water; then it breaks and spreads and wavers with the
wind; and finally, in a rich white veil of spray, reaches the surface of
the vale of Lauterbrunnen, a thousand feet below. They call it the
Dust-Fall.</p>

<p>The opposite side of the valley does not change so suddenly into
mountain. There are slopes, green or yellow, as the seasons may be,
with the little harvests which the mountain-people raise; there are
cliffs with wide niches in them, where you may see kids or sheep
cropping the short herbage which grows in the shadow of the rocks;
and there is a path, zig-zagging up from the road below, I scarce know
how. It would be very tiresome, were it not for the views it gives
you at every turning. Sometimes, from under a thicket of trees, you
look sheer down upon the little bridge you have traversed in the bottom
of the valley; seeming so near, that you could toss your Alpinstock
into the brook. Sometimes the green of the meadow, and the

<!-- page 40 -->

sparkle of its stream are shut out; and you look straight across upon
the Dust-Fall, where it leaps from the cliff abreast of you; and see it
shiver, and grow white, and hear it afterward go murmuring away
through its valley-bed.</p>

<p>At other times, as you pass farther up, the waterfall seems only a
bit of gauze, which is lost over the edge of the cliff; and the heights
above, from which the stream comes, break into sight and tower
aloft in a way that quite dwarfs the poor valley beneath, and makes
it seem a mere nook in the hills.</p>

<p>But by far the grandest sight of all those which belong to this
mountain neighborhood, is that of the glacier which shuts up the head
of the valley. It is not, indeed, larger or whiter than many others of
Switzerland; but like the crown of a monarch, its green, lustrous
crystals rise over the forehead of Lauterbrunnen, and charm you by
such contrast of the fierce glory of winter, with the soft smile of summer,
as can be seen nowhere else.</p>

<p>My first visit to this spot, many years ago, was on a midsummer's
afternoon. The mountains were clear of clouds; and their snow-tops,
and the green spurs of the glacier in the distance, seemed to wear the
same warm glow of sunlight which fell upon the slopes around me,
and upon the meadows beneath. I could see the brook trailing white
in the bed of the valley; and the Dust-Fall gushing from the cliff into
feathery, cloud-like vapor; and the peasants in the meadows, gathering
their July crop of hay&mdash;yet so far below me, that no murmur of
their toil came to my ear; but, in place of it, a mountain girl, from
a cottage upon the heights, was singing, in the hope of a few pennies,
a plaintive Swiss song, which floated pleasantly on the air, and
mingled gracefully with the tinkle of the scattered bells, which the
kids wore upon the cliffs above. Except these sounds, a silence
haunted the whole region. As I lay under the shadow of a broad-limbed
walnut, whose leaves scarce stirred in the summer air, the
song, and the tinkle of the bells, and the glow of light upon the distant
snow-cliffs, and the delicious haze that lingered over the Arcadian
valley beneath me, seemed to belong each to each, and to make up
a scene in which a life-time might be dreamed away, without a
thought of labor or of duty.</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>It was different when I went there last. It was not in summer,
but in autumn. The green of the meadows had given place to the
brown tint which betokens the coming-on of winter. The trees on the
slopes, as I toiled up the ascent toward the Wengern-Alp, were
stripped of half their leaves; and the yellow and tattered remnants
were sighing in a cool wind of October. The clouds hung low, and
dashed fitfully across the heights. From hour to hour, great fragments
of the glacier, loosened by the heavy rains of the previous
night, fell thundering into distant mountain abysses. No sunlight
rested upon the valley or upon the ice.</p>

<p>It hardly seemed to me the same spot of country which had so
caught my fancy, and bewildered me with its quiet beauty years
before. And yet there was a sublimity hanging about the landscape
and the sky of which I had no sense on the former visit. At that
time, the mountains, and the air, and even the lustrous glacier were
subdued into quiet harmony with the valley and the valley-brook
below. Even the song of the cottage-girl was an according symphony
with the tone of nature.</p>

<p>Now, however, the gray landscape, unlighted by any ray of sun
light, wore a sober and solemn hue, that lifted even the meadow into
grand companionship with the mountains and the glaciers; and the
crash of falling icebergs quickened and gave force to the impressions
of awe, which crept over me like a chill.</p>

<p>I began to understand, for the first time, that strange and savage
reverence which the peasants feel for their mountains. And as the
thunder of the falling glaciers echoed among the peaks, I grew insensibly
into a fear of the great <span class="smcap">Power</span> which lived and reigned in those
regions of ice. It seemed to me that darkness would be only needed
to drive away all rational estimate of the strange sounds which
crashed, and the silence which brooded among the sombre cliffs. I
entertained, with a willingness that almost frighted me, the old stories
of ice-gods ruling and thundering among the glaciers.</p>

<p>The active, practical, reasoning world, with its throngs and talk,
was far below. Greater things were around me, and challenged my
fancy.</p>

<p>All the forces which man boasts of were little, compared with

<!-- page 42 -->

those which made their voice heard among the cliffs. It seemed not
only possible, but probable, that some great special Intelligence
reigned over the giant forces which stirred around me. The old
legends of ice-gods took shadow and form. I strode on to the little
shelter-place, which lies under the Jungfrau, with the fearful step of
one encroaching upon the domain of some august and splendid
monarch. I did not once seek to combat the imaginative humors
which lent a tone and a consistency to this feeling. I would not, if I
could, have resisted the weird impressions of the place.</p>

<p>A terrific storm burst over the mountains, shortly after I had
gained shelter in the little ch&acirc;let of the Ober-Alp. The only company
I found was the host, and a flax-haired German student. This last
abandoned his pipe as the storm rose, and listened with me silently,
and, I thought, with the same measure of awe, to the crash of the avalanches
which were loosened by the falling torrents of rain.</p>

<p>"The Ice-King is angry to-night," said our host.</p>

<p>I could not smile at the superstition of the man; a sense of awe
was too strong upon me; there was a feeling born of the mountain
presence, and of the terrific crash of the glaciers, which forbade my
smiling&mdash;a feeling as if an Ice-King might be really there to avenge a
slight.</p>

<p>Presently there was a louder shock than usual, and the echoes of
the report thundered for several minutes among the cliffs. The
mountain host went to the door, which looked out toward the Jungfrau;
and soon he called us hurriedly to see, as he called it, the Maid
of the Glacier.</p>

<p>The bald wall of rock we could see looming dark through the tempest,
and the immense caps of glacier, which lay at the top. The host
directed our attention to a white speck half-way up the face of the precipice
which appeared to rise slowly in a wavy line, and presently to
disappear over the edge of the glacier.</p>

<p>"You saw her? said the host excitedly; "you never see her,
except after some terrible avalanche."</p>

<p>"What is it?" said I.</p>

<p>"We call her the Bride of the Ice-King," said our host; and he
appealed to the German student, who, I found, had been frequently in

<!-- page 43 -->

the Alps, and was familiar with all the legends. And when we were
seated again around the fire, which the host had replenished with a
fagot of crackling fire-wood, the German re-lighted his pipe, and told
us this story of the Bride of the Ice-King. If it should appear tame
in the reading, beside a Christmas blaze, it must be remembered, that
I listened to it first in a storm at midnight, upon the wild heights of
the Scheideck.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span>, many years ago, (it was thus his story began,) there lived
upon the edge of the valley of Lauterbrunnen a peasant, who had a
beautiful daughter, by the name of Clothilde. Her hair was golden,
and flowed in ringlets upon a neck which would have rivalled that of
the fairest statue of antiquity. Her eye was hazel and bright, but
with a pensive air, which, if the young herdsmen of the valley looked
on only once, they never forgot in their lives.</p>

<p>The mother of Clothilde, who had died when she was young, came,
it was said, from some foreign land; none knew of her lineage; and
the people of the valley had learned only that the peasant, whose wife
she became, had found her lost upon the mountains.</p>

<p>The peasant was an honest man, and mourned for the mother of
Clothilde, because she had shared his labors, and had lighted pleasantly
the solitary path of his life. But Clothilde, though the mother
died when she was young, clung ever tenderly to her memory, and
persisted always that she would find her again where her father had
found her&mdash;upon the mountains. It was in vain they showed her the
grave where her mother lay buried, in the village church-yard.</p>

<p>"No, no," she would say, "my mother is not there;" and her
eyes lifted to the mountains.</p>

<p>Yet no one thought Clothilde was crazed; not a maiden of all the
village of Lauterbrunnen performed better her household cares than
the beautiful Clothilde. Not one could so swiftly ply the distaff; not
one who could show such store of white cloth, woven from the mountain
flax. She planted flowers by the door of her father's cottage;
she watched over all his comforts; she joined with the rest in the village

<!-- page 44 -->

balls; but, unlike all the maidens of the village, she would accept
no lover.</p>

<p>There were those who said that her smiles were all cold smiles,
and that her heart was icy. But these were disappointed ones; and
had never known of the tears she shed when she thought of her mother,
who was gone.</p>

<p>The father, plain peasant that he was, mourned in his heart when
he thought how Clothilde was the only maiden of the village who had
no lover; and he feared greatly, as the years flew swiftly over him,
for the days that were to come, when Clothilde would have none to
watch over her, and none to share her cottage home.</p>

<p>But the pensive-eyed Clothilde put on gaiety when she found this
mood creeping over her father's thought, and cheered him with the
light songs she had learned from the village girls.</p>

<p>Yet her heart was not in the light songs; for she loved to revel in
the wild and mysterious tales belonging to the mountain life. Deeper
things, and things more dread than came near to the talk or to the
thought of the fellow-villagers, wakened the fancy of the pensive-eyed
Clothilde. Whether it was some dreamy memory of the lost mother,
or daily companionship with the mountains and the glaciers, which
she saw from her father's door, certain it was, that her thought went
farther and wider than the thoughts of those around her.</p>

<p>Even the doctrines she learned from the humble cur&eacute; of the village,
blended with the wilder action of her fancy; and though she
kneeled, as did the father and the good cur&eacute;, before the image at the
altar of the village church, she seemed to see <span class="smcap">Him</span> plainer in the
mountains: and there was a sacredness in the pine woods upon the
slope of the hill, and in the voice of the avalanches which fell in the
time of spring, which called to her mind a quicker sense of the Divine
presence and power, than the church chalices or the rosary.</p>

<p>Now, the father of Clothilde had large flocks, for a village peasant.
Fifty of his kids fed upon the herbage which grew on the mountain
ledges; and half a score of dun cows came every night to his ch&acirc;let,
from the pasture-grounds which were watered by the spray of the
Dust-Fall.</p>

<p>Many of the young villagers would have gladly won Clothilde to

<!-- page 45 -->

some token of love; but ever her quiet, pale face, as she knelt in the
village church, awed them to silence; and ever her gentle manner, as
she clung to the arm of the old herdsman, her father, made them vow
new vows to capture the village beauty.</p>

<p>In times of danger, or in times when sickness came to the ch&acirc;lets
of the valley, Clothilde passed hither and thither on errands of mercy;
and when storms threatened those who watched the kids upon the
mountain slopes, she sent them food and wine, and fresh store of
blankets.</p>

<p>So the years passed; and the maidens said that Clothilde was
losing the freshness that belonged to her young days; but these were
jealous ones, and, like other maidens than Swiss maidens, knew not
how to forgive her who bore away the palm of goodness and of
beauty.</p>

<p>And the father, growing always older, grew sadder at thought of
the desolate condition which would soon belong to his daughter Clothilde.</p>

<p>"Who," said the old man, "will take care of the flocks, my
daughter? who will look after the dun cows? who will bring the winter's
store of fir-wood from the mountains?"</p>

<p>Now, Clothilde could answer for these things; for even the cur&eacute;
of the village would not see the pretty and the pious Clothilde left
destitute. But it pained her heart to witness the care that lay upon
her father's thought, and she was willing to bestow quiet upon his
parting years. Therefore, on a day when she came back with the old
herdsman from a village-wedding, she told him that she, too, if he
wished, would become a bride.</p>

<p>"And whom will you marry, Clothilde?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"Whom you choose," said Clothilde; but she added, "he must be
good, else how can I be good? And he must be brave, for the dangers
of the mountain life are many."</p>

<p>So the father and the village cur&eacute; consulted together, while Clothilde
sang as before at her household cares; and lingered, as was her
wont at evening, by the chapel of Our Lady of the Snow, in view of
the glaciers which rose in the front of the valley.</p>

<p>But the father and the cur&eacute; could decide upon none who was

<!-- page 46 -->

wholly worthy to be the bridegroom of Clothilde. The people of the
valley were honest, and not a young villager of them all but would
have made for her a watchful husband, and cared well for the flocks
which belonged to her father's fold.</p>

<p>In that day, as now, village f&ecirc;tes were held in every time of
spring, at which the young mountaineers contended with each other in
wrestling, and in the cast of heavy boulder-stones, and in other mountain
sports, which tried their manliness, and which called down the
plaudits of all the village dames. The spring and the spring f&ecirc;tes
were now approaching, and it was agreed between the father and the
cur&eacute;, that where all were so brave and honest, the victor in the village
games should receive, for reward, the hand of Clothilde.</p>

<p>The villagers were all eager for the day which was to decide the
fortunes of their valley heiress. Clothilde herself wore no cloud upon
her brow; but ever, with the same serene look, she busied her hands
with her old house-cares, and sang the songs which cheered her old
father's heart.</p>

<p>The youth of the village&mdash;they were mostly the weaker ones&mdash;eyed
her askance, and said, "She can have no heart worth the winning,
who is won only by a stout arm." And others said still, "She
is icy cold, and can have no heart at all."</p>

<p>But the good cur&eacute; said, "Nay;" and many a one from sick-beds
called down blessings on her.</p>

<p>There were mothers, too, of the village, thinking, perhaps, as
mothers will, of the fifty kids and of the half-score of dun cows, which
would make her dowry, who said, with a wise shake of the head,
"She who is so good a daughter will make also a good wife."</p>

<p>Among those who would gladly, long ago, have sought Clothilde
in marriage, was a young villager of Lauterbrunnen, whose name was
Conrad Friedland.</p>

<p>He was a hunter as well as a herdsman, and he knew the haunts
of the chamois upon the upper heights as well as he knew the pasturage-ground
where fed the kids which belonged to the father of Clothilde.
He had nut-brown hair, and dark blue eyes; and there was
not a maiden of the valley, save only the pensive Clothilde, but
watched admiringly the proud step of the hunter Friedland.</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>Many a time her father had spoken of the daring deeds of Conrad,
and had told to Clothilde, with an old man's ardor, the tale of the
wild mountain-hunts which Conrad could reckon up; and how, once
upon a time, when a child was lost, they had lowered the young
huntsman with ropes into the deep crevasses of the glacier; and how,
in the depths of the icy cavern, he had bound the young child to his
shoulder, and been dragged, bruised and half-dead, to the light again.</p>

<p>To all this Clothilde had listened with a sparkle in her eye; yet
she felt not her heart warming toward Conrad, as the heart of a
maiden should warm toward an accepted lover.</p>

<p>Many and many a time Conrad had gazed on Clothilde as she
kneeled in the village church. Many and many a time he had watched
her crimson kirtle, as she disappeared among the walnut-trees that
grew by her father's door. Many and many a time he had looked
longingly upon the ten dun cows which made up her father's flock,
and upon the green pasturage ground, where his kids counted by
fifty.</p>

<p>Brave enough he was to climb the crags, even when the ice was
smooth on the narrow foot-way, and a slip would hurl him to destruction;
he had no fear of the crevasses which gape frightfully on the
paths that lead over the glaciers; he did not shudder at the thunders
which the avalanches sent howling among the heights around him;
and yet Conrad had never dared to approach, as a lover might
approach, the pensive-eyed Clothilde.</p>

<p>With other maidens of the village he danced and sang, even as the
other young herdsmen, who were his mates in the village games,
danced and sang. Once or twice, indeed, he had borne a gift&mdash;a
hunter's gift of tender chamois-flesh&mdash;to the old man, her father.
And Clothilde, with her own low voice, had said, "My father thanks
you, Conrad."</p>

<p>And the brave hunter, in her presence, was like a sparrow within
the swoop of a falcon!</p>

<p>If she sang, he listened&mdash;as though he dreamed that leaves were
fluttering, and birds were singing over him. If she was silent, he
gazed on her&mdash;as he had gazed on cool mountain-pools when the sun
smote fiercely.</p>

<!-- page 48 -->

<p>The idle raillery of the village he could not talk to her; of love
she would not listen; of things higher, with his peasant's voice and
mind, he knew not how to talk. And the mother of Conrad Friedland,
a lone widow, living only in the love of her son, upon the first
lift of the hills, chid him for his silence, and said, "He who has no
tongue to tell of love, can have no heart to win it!"</p>

<p>Yet Conrad, for very lack of speech, felt his slumberous passion
grow strong. The mountain springs which are locked longest with
ice, run fiercest in summer.</p>

<p>And Conrad rejoiced in the trial that was to come, where he could
speak his love in his own mountain way, and conquer the heart of
Clothilde with his good right arm.</p>

<p>Howbeit, there was many another herdsman of the valley who
prepared himself joyously for a strife, where the winner should
receive the fifty kids, and the ten dun cows, and the hand of the beautiful
Clothilde. Many a mother, whose eye had rested lovingly on
these, one and all, bade their sons "Be ready!"</p>

<p>Clothilde alone seemed careless of those, who, on the festal day,
were to become her champions; and ever she passed undisturbed
through her daily round of cares, kneeling in the village church, singing
the songs that gladdened her father's heart, and lingering at the
sunset hour, by the chapel of Our Lady of the Snow, whence she saw
the glaciers and the mountain-tops glowing with the rich red light
from the west.</p>

<p>Upon the night which was before the day of the village f&ecirc;te, it
happened that she met the brave young hunter, Conrad, returning
from the hills, with a chamois upon his shoulder. He saluted her, as
was his wont, and would have followed at respectful distance; but
Clothilde beckoned his approach.</p>

<p>"Conrad," said she, "you will contend with the others at the f&ecirc;te
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I will be there," said Conrad; "and, please the blessed Virgin,
I will win such prize as was never won before!"</p>

<p>"Conrad Friedland, I know that you are brave, and that you are
strong. Will you not be generous also? Swear to me that if
you are the winner in to-morrow's sports, you will not claim the

<!-- page 49 -->

reward which my father has promised to the bravest, for a year and
a day."</p>

<p>"You ask what is hard," said Conrad. "When the chamois is
near, I draw my bow; and when my arrow is on the string, how can I
stay the shaft?"</p>

<p>"It is well for your mountain prizes, Conrad; but bethink you
the heart of a virgin is to be won like a gazelle of the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Clothilde will deny me, then?" said Conrad reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Until a year and a day are passed, I must deny," said the
maiden. "But when the snows of another spring are melted, and the
f&ecirc;te has returned again, if you, Conrad Friedland, are of the same
heart and will, I promise to be yours."</p>

<p>And Conrad touched his lips to the hand she lent him, and swore,
"by Our Lady of the Snow," that, for a year and a day, he would
make no claim to the hand of Clothilde, though he were twice the
winner.</p>

<p>The morning was beautiful which ushered in the day of the f&ecirc;tes.
The maidens of the village were arrayed in their gayest dresses, and
the young herdsmen of the valley had put on their choicest finery.
The sports were held upon a soft bit of meadow-land at the foot of
the great glacier which rises in the front of Lauterbrunnen. A barrier
of earth and rocks, clothed with fir-trees, separated the green meadow
from the crystal mountain which gleamed above. And ever,
when the sun smote hotly, the glacier streams, which murmured upon
either side of the meadow, made cool the air.</p>

<p>All the people of the village were assembled, and many a young
hunter or herdsman beside, from the plains of Interlacken, or from
the borders of the Brienzer-See, or from the farther vale of Grindelwald.</p>

<p>But Conrad had no fear of these; for already on many a day of
f&ecirc;te, he had measured forces with them, and had borne off the prizes,
whether in wrestling or in the cast of the granite boulders. This day
he had given great care to his dress; a jerkin of neatly tanned chamois-leather
set off his muscular figure, and it was dressed upon the
throat and upon the front with those rare furs of the mountains, which
betokened his huntsman's craft.</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>Many a village maiden wished that day she held the place of Clothilde,
and that she, too, might have such champion as the brown-haired
Conrad.</p>

<p>A rich cap of lace, worked by the village hands, was round the
forehead of Clothilde; and, to humor the pride of the old man, her
father, she had added the fairest flowers which grew by the cottage-door.
But, fair as the flowers were, the face of Clothilde was fairer.</p>

<p>She sat between the old herdsman and the cur&eacute;, upon one of the
rustic benches which circled the plateau of green, where the village
sports were held. Tall poles of hemlock or of fir, dressed with garlands
of mountain laurel, stood at the end of the little arena, where
the valley champions were to contend. Among these were some
whose strong arms and lithe figures promised a hard struggle to the
hopeful Conrad; and there were jealous ones who would have been
glad to humble the pretensions of one so favored by the village maidens,
as the blue-eyed hunter, Friedland.</p>

<p>Many looks turned curiously toward the bench, where sat the village
belle, whose fortunes seemed to hang upon the fate of the day;
but her brow was calm; and there, as ever, she was watchful of the
comfort of the old man, her father.</p>

<p>Half of the games had passed over, indeed, before she turned a,
curious look upon the strife. Conrad, though second in some of the
lesser sports, had generally kept the first rank; and the more vigorous
trials to come would test his rivals more seriously, and would, it
was thought, give him a more decided triumph.</p>

<p>When the wrestlers were called, there appeared a stout herdsman
from the valley of Grindelwald, who was the pride of his village, and
who challenged boldly the hunter, Conrad. He was taller and seemed
far stronger than Conrad; and there were those&mdash;the old herdsman
among them&mdash;who feared greatly that a stranger would carry off the
prize.</p>

<p>But the heart of the brave hunter was fired by the sight of Clothilde,
now bending an eager look upon the sports. He accepted the
challenge of the stout herdsman, and they grappled each other in the
mountain way. The stranger was the stronger; but Conrad, the
more active. For a long time they struggled vainly, and the villagers

<!-- page 51 -->

were doubting how the strife might end, when the foot of Conrad,
striking a soft bit of turf, failed him, and he fell. There was a
low murmur of disappointment; but in an instant, Conrad, by a
vigorous effort, freed himself from his rival and was again upon his
feet.</p>

<p>They grappled once more, but the heavy herdsman was weary;
Conrad pressed him closely; and soon the valley rang with shouts,
and the champion of Grindelwald was fairly vanquished.</p>

<p>After this came the cast of the boulders. One after another, the
younger men made their trial, and the limit of each cast was marked
by a willow wand, and in the cleft of each wand was a fragment of
ribbon, bestowed by well-wishing maidens.</p>

<p>Conrad, taking breath after his wrestling-match, advanced composedly
to his place at the head of the arena, where stood the fir-saplings
with the laurel wreaths. He lifted the boulder with ease, and,
giving it a vigorous cast, retired unconcerned. The little blue strip
of ribbon which presently marked its fall, was far in advance of the
rest.</p>

<p>Again there was a joyous shout. But the men of Grindelwald
cried out loudly to their champion, and he came forward; but his arm
was tired, and his cast was scarce even with the second of the men of
Lauterbrunnen.</p>

<p>Again the shout rose louder than before, and Conrad Friedland
was declared by the village umpires of the f&ecirc;te to be the victor,
and, by will of the old herdsman, to be the accepted lover of the
beautiful Clothilde. They led him forward to the stand where sat the
cur&eacute;, between the old herdsman and the herdsman's daughter.</p>

<p>Clothilde grew suddenly pale. Would Conrad keep his oath?</p>

<p>Fear may have confused him, or fatigue may have forbid his utterance;
but he reached forth his hand for the guerdon of the day, and
the token of betrothal.</p>

<p>Just then an Alpine horn sounded long and clear, and the echoes
lingered among the cliffs and in the spray of the Dust-Fall. It was
the call of a new challenger. By the laws of the f&ecirc;te, the games were
open until sunset, and the new-comer could not be denied.</p>

<p>None had seen him before. His frame was slight, but firmly

<!-- page 52 -->

knit; his habit was of the finest white wool, closed at the throat with
rich white furs, and caught together with latchets of silver. His hair
and beard were of a light flaxen color, and his chamois boots were
clamped and spiked with polished steel, as if he had crossed the glacier.
It was said by those near whom he passed, that a cold current
of air followed him, and that his breath was frosted on his beard, even
under the mild sun of May.</p>

<p>He said no word to any; but, advancing with a stately air to the
little plateau where the fir spars stood crowned with their laurel garlands,
he seized upon a boulder larger than any had yet thrown, and
cast it far beyond the mark where the blue pennant of Conrad still
fluttered in the wind.</p>

<p>There was a stifled cry of amazement, and the wonder grew greater
still, when the stranger, in place of putting a willow wand to mark his
throw, seized upon one of the fir saplings, and hurled it through the
air with such precision and force, that it fixed itself in the sod within
a foot of the half-embedded boulder, and rested quivering with its
laurel wreath waving from the top.</p>

<p>The victor waited for no conductor; but, marching straight to the
benches where sat the bewildered maiden, and her wonder-stricken
father, bespoke them thus:</p>

<p>"Fair lady, the prize is won; but if, within a year and a day,
Conrad Friedland can do better than this, I will yield him the palm;
until then I go to my home in the mountains."</p>

<p>The villagers looked on amazed; Clothilde alone was calm, but
silent. None had before seen the stranger; none had noticed his
approach, and his departure was as secret as his coming.</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; muttered his prayers; the village maidens recalled by
timid whispers his fine figure, and the rich furs that he wore. And
Conrad, recovering from his stupor, said never a word; but paced
back and forth musingly, the length of the boulder-cast which the
white-clad stranger had made.</p>

<p>The old man swore it was some spirit, and bade Clothilde accept
Conrad at once as a protector against the temptations of the Evil One.
But the maiden, more than ever wedded to her visionary life by this
strange apparition, dwelt upon the words of the stranger, and repeating

<!-- page 53 -->

them, said to her father, "Let Conrad wait for a twelvemonth,
and if he passes the throw of the Unknown, I will be his bride."</p>

<p>The sun sank beyond the hills of the Ober-Alp, and with the twilight
came a mystic awe over the minds of the villagers. The
thoughtful Clothilde fancied the stranger some spiritual guardian:
most of all, when she recalled the vow which Conrad had made and
had broken. She remarked, moreover, as they went toward their
home, that an eagle of the Alps, long after its wonted time of day,
hovered over their path, and only when the cottage-door was closed,
soared away to the cliffs that lifted above the glaciers of Lauterbrunnen.</p>

<p>The old herdsman began now to regard his daughter with a
strange kind of awe. He consulted long and anxiously with the good
cur&eacute; of the village. Could it be that the maid, so near to his heart,
was leagued with the spirit-world? He recalled the time when he
had met first her mother, wandering upon the mountains. Whence
had she come? And was the stranger of the festal day, of some far
kindred, who now sought his own? It was remembered how the
mother had loved her child, and had borne her in her arms often to
the very edge of the glacier, and lulled Clothilde to sleep with the
murmur of the deep falls of water, which, in the heats of summer,
make mysterious music in the heart of the ice-mountains.</p>

<p>It was remembered how, in girlhood, Clothilde had often wandered
thither to pluck Alpine roses, and was heedless always of the icy
breath which came from the blue glacier-caverns. Always, too, she
hung her votive garlands on the altar of "Our Lady of the Snow," and
prayed for the pilgrims, who, in winter, traversed the rude passes of
the Ober-Alp. Did the mother belong to the Genius of the Mountain?
and was the daughter pledged to the Ice-King again?</p>

<p>The poor old herdsman bowed his head in prayer; the good cur&eacute;
whispered words of comfort; Clothilde sang as she had sung in the
days that were gone, but the old man trembled at her low tones,
which thrilled now in his ear like the syren sounds, which they say
in the Alps, go always before the roar of some great avalanche.</p>

<p>Yet the father's heart twined more and more round the strange
spirit-being of Clothilde. It seemed to him, more and more, that the

<!-- page 54 -->

mother's image was before him, and that the mother's soul looked out
from the pensive eyes of Clothilde. He said now no word of marriage,
but waited with resignation for the dread twelvemonth to pass
away. And he looked with pity upon the strong-hearted Conrad,
who, fiercer and more daring than before&mdash;as if some quick despair
had given courage&mdash;scaled the steepest cliffs, and brought back stores
of chamois-flesh, of which he laid always a portion at the door of the
father of Clothilde.</p>

<p>It was said, too, that the young huntsman was heard at night, casting
boulder-stones in the valley, and nerving his arm for the trial of
the twelvemonth to come.</p>

<p>The maidens of the village eyed askance the tripping figure of the
valley belle; the mothers of the young herdsmen spoke less often of
the ten dun cows which fed upon her father's pasture-grounds, and
counted less often the fifty kids which trooped at night into her
father's folds upon the mountain.</p>

<p>Yet ever Clothilde made her sunset walks to the chapel of Our
Lady of the Snow, and ever, in her place in the village church, she
prayed, as reverently as before, for <span class="smcap">Heaven</span> to bless the years of the
life of the old man, her father.</p>

<p>If she lived in a spirit-world, it seemed a good spirit-world; and
the crystal glory of the glacier, where no foot could go, and where her
gaze loved to linger, imaged to her thought the stainless purity of
angels. If the cur&eacute; talked with Clothilde of the heaven where her
mother had gone, and where all the good will follow, Clothilde
pointed to the mountains.</p>

<p>Did he talk of worship and the anthems which men sang in the
cathedrals of cities?</p>

<p>Clothilde said, "Hark to the avalanche!"</p>

<p>Did he talk of a good spirit, which hovers always near the faithful?</p>

<p>Clothilde pointed upward, where an eagle soared over the glacier,
a speck upon the sky.</p>

<p>As the year passed away, mysterious rumors were spread among
the villagers; and there were those who said they had seen at eventide,
Clothilde talking with a stranger in white, who was like the challenger

<!-- page 55 -->

of the year before. And when the winter had covered the
lower hills with white, it was said that traces of strange feet were seen
about the little chapel of Our Lady of the Snow.</p>

<p>Howbeit, Clothilde neglected not one of the duties which belonged
to her in the household of her father, and her willing heart and hand
forbade that either the kind old herdsman or the cur&eacute; should speak
aught ill to her, or forbid her the mountain rambles.</p>

<p>The old mother of Conrad grew frighted, indeed, by the stories of
the villagers, and prayed her son to give up all thought of the strange
Clothilde, and to marry a maiden whose heart was of warmer blood,
and who kept no league with the Evil One. But Conrad only the
more resolutely followed the bent of his will, and schooled himself for
the coming trial. If they talked to him of the stranger, he vowed
with a fearful oath, that, be he who he might, he would dare him to
sharper conflict than that of the year before.</p>

<p>So, at length, the month and the day drew near again. It was
early spring-time. The wasting snows still whitened the edges of the
fields which hung upon the slopes of the mountain. The meadow of
the f&ecirc;te had lost the last traces of winter, and a fresh green sod, with
sprinkled daisies, glittered under the dew and the sunlight.</p>

<p>Clothilde again was robed with care, and when the old herdsman
looked on her, under the wreath she had woven out by his cottage
flowers, he forgave her all he had thought of her tie to the spirit-world,
and clasped her to his heart&mdash;"his own, his good Clothilde!"</p>

<p>On the day before the f&ecirc;te, there had been heavy rain; and the
herdsmen from the heights reported that the winter snows were loosening,
and would soon come down, after which would be broad summer
and the ripening of the crops.</p>

<p>Scarce a villager was away from the wrestling-ground; for all had
heard of Clothilde, and of the new and strange comer who had challenged
the pride of the valley, and had disappeared&mdash;none knew whither.</p>

<p>Was Conrad Friedland to lose again his guerdon?</p>

<p>The games went on, with the old man, the father of Clothilde,
looking on timidly, and the good cur&eacute; holding his accustomed place
beside him. There were young herdsmen who appeared this year,

<!-- page 56 -->

for the first time, among the wrestlers, and whom the past twelve
month had ripened into sturdy manhood. But the firm and the tried
sinews of the hunter Conrad placed him before all these, as he was
before all the others. Not so many, however, as on the year before,
envied him his spirit-bride. Yet none could gainsay her beauty; for
this day her face was radiant with a rich glow, and her clear complexion,
relieved by the green garland she wore, made her seem a
princess.</p>

<p>As the day's sports went on, a cool, damp wind blew up the valley,
and clouds drifted over the summits of the mountains. Conrad
had made himself the victor in every trial. To make his triumph still
more brilliant, he had even surpassed the throw of his unknown rival
of the year before. At sight of this, the villagers raised one loud
shout of greeting, which echoed from end to end of the valley. And
the brave huntsman, flushed with victory, dared boldly the stranger
of the white jerkin and the silver latchets to appear and maintain his
claims to the queen of the valley&mdash;the beautiful Clothilde.</p>

<p>There was a momentary hush, broken only by the distant murmur
of the Dust-Fall. The thickening clouds drifted fast athwart the
mountains.</p>

<p>Clothilde grew suddenly pale, though the old herdsman, her father,
was wild with joy. The cur&eacute; watched the growing paleness of Clothilde,
and saw her eye lift toward the head of the glacier.</p>

<p>"Bear away my father!" said she, in a quick tone of authority.
In a moment the reason was apparent. A roar, as of thunder, filled
the valley; a vast mass of the glacier above had given way, and its
crash upon the first range of cliffs now reached the ear. The fragments
of ice and rock were moving with frightful volume down
toward the plateau.</p>

<p>The villagers fled screaming; the father of Clothilde was borne
away by the cur&eacute;; Clothilde herself was, for the time, lost sight of.
The eye of Conrad was keen, and his judgment rare. He saw the
avalanche approaching, but he did not fly like the others. An upper
plateau and a thicket of pine-trees were in the path of the avalanche;
he trusted to these to avert or to stay the ruin.</p>

<p>As he watched, while others shouted him a warning, he caught

<!-- page 57 -->

sight of the figure of Clothilde, in the arms of a stranger flying
toward the face of the mountain. He rushed wildly after.</p>

<p>A fearful crash succeeded; the avalanche had crossed the plateau,
and swept down the fir-trees; the trunks splintered before it, like
summer brambles; the detached rocks were hurled down in showers;
immense masses of ice followed quickly after, roaring over the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of the forest, and, with a crash that shook the whole valley, reached
the meadow below. Swift as lightning, whole acres of the green sod
were torn up by the wreck of the forest-trees and rocks, and huge,
gleaming masses of ice; and then, more slowly, with a low murmur,
like a requiem, came the flow of lesser snowy fragments, covering the
great ruin with a mantle of white.</p>

<p>Poor Conrad Friedland was buried beneath!</p>

<p>The villagers had all fled in safety; but the green meadow of the
f&ecirc;tes was a meadow no longer.</p>

<p>Those who were hindermost in the flight said they saw the stranger
in white bearing Clothilde, in her white robes, up the face of the
mountain. It is certain that she was never seen in the valley again;
and the poor old herdsman, her father, died shortly after, leaving his
stock of dun cows and his fifty kids to the village cur&eacute;, to buy masses
for the rest of his daughter's soul.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span>," said the German, "is the story of the Bride of the Ice-King;"
and he re-lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>The storm had now passed over, and the stars were out. Before
us was the giant wall of the Jungfrau, with a little rattle of glacier
artillery occasionally breaking the silence of the night. To the left
was the tall peak of the Wetterhorn, gleaming white in the starlight;
and, far away to the right, we could see the shining glaciers at the
head of the Lauterbrunnen valley.</p>

<p>If I ever pass that way again, I shall ask the guides to show me
the avalanche under which poor Conrad, the hunter, lies buried.</p>

            Essayed to speak; but in the very deed

        Little she helped him, at his direst need,

<h3 id="c07">Gentle Dove.</h3>

<p>AN INDIAN LEGEND.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY F. W. SHELTON.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Long</span>, long ago, on the banks of the Upper Mississippi, among the
tribes of the warlike Sacs, lived a young woman, who for the endearing
gentleness of her nature, was called Nit-o-me-ma, or Gentle Dove.
The savages in the wilderness acknowledged her power, though
revealed only in the majesty of her motions and in the music of her
voice. She controlled their avenging passions by her glance of pity,
and disarmed them with a woman's tears. The doctrines of the
cross accorded well with a spirit so meek and loving, and she became
a Christian. The good missionary Marquette came from a distant
land, crossed the stormy deep, and pursuing his journey through a
trackless country, bore in his hands the Gospel of Peace. Self-sacrificing
and devoted, he went upon his errand, proclaiming to the
benighted children of the forest the glad tidings of salvation with a
resolution which despised all dangers and which knew no fatigue.
How sublime is the life of such a follower of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>! But alas! the
disciple was treated as his master. His benevolent designs were
soon mistaken, and ascribed to motives base and mercenary. Escaping
from his pursuers, he went into a solitary place to pray. When
they came up with him he was discovered on his knees. It is said
that they drew their bows, but, observing that he did not move, they
approached and found him dead.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Gentle Dove was married to Omaint-si-ar-nah, son
of the nation's chief. Beautiful and manly in person, tall and athletic,

<!-- page 64 -->

with features regular and handsome, skillful and adroit in the use of
the bow and in casting the javelin, in battle bold and daring, like his
sire, he was, moreover, the faithful friend, the kind husband, the
generous host; but he was in temper sanguine, credulous, and
jealous.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Gentle Dove become his bride, even with the first
waning moon which made her his, when a sudden war-whoop broke
upon this dream of bliss. No more the lovers walked within the
silent forest or shot the rapids in their light canoe. Tender and impassioned
was their early parting; and should they never see each
other more upon the transitory earth, they vowed to meet unchanged
in love upon the shadowy confines of the spirit-land. Omaint-si-ar-nah
smoothed the tresses of his Gentle Dove, held her hand in momentary
silence, then turned his back, and walked erect to meet his warriors
in the grove. Towering above the naked and be-painted group, he
waved his arm, and with a bold untutored eloquence, he recounted
insults and kindled up the passion of revenge. Wild gestures, and a
yell more dreadful than the beasts make in concert, attested that
his words had taken effect. Calling Que-la-wah, "Faithful Friend," he
walked aside, and bade him save his scalping-knife and unstring his
supple bow. He could have no part in the present foray, although
he was a warrior of approved renown. Que-la-wah must remain
behind, and to his good protection during her lord's absence he committed
Gentle Dove. Then, having received assurance, the chief once
more called his band around him, and marched without delay to take
revenge upon the distant tribes.</p>

<p>The art of writing was unknown; but every month he sent a trusty
courier from his camp with a verbal message to his wife, and received
her missives in return. Loitering and tedious was this method for the
impatience of affection, but dearer than volumes were the true words
when they arrived. Omaint-si-ar-nah sometimes drank them into his
ear as he reclined by the camp-fires at midnight, and the music of
water-falls was not so sweet. They nerved his arm for a score of
battles, though but the plaining of a dove. How welcome the surprises
when he heard the dry leaves crackling, and seized his bow and
stole without the tent, expecting an enemy in ambush, and lo! a messenger

<!-- page 65 -->

from his love! Thus to and fro, like shining arrows shot and
returned, were reciprocated these missives of two faithful hearts,
until they suddenly ceased. Omaint-si-ar-nah walked in gloom. He
thought his courier had fallen a victim to the foe.</p>

<p>Que-la-wah, "Faithful Friend," had become enamored of Gentle
Dove, and sought by every means to win her from her rightful lord.
She spurned his offers with indignation, but he did not cease to torment
her with his appeals. The old and the very young were all who
remained in the tribe, and she needed protection from her protector.
Meantime, being much perplexed in spirit, she had a dream. An
awful form stood before her, and told her that the Virgin loved her,
and promised to reveal the future to her eyes. What she had suffered
from Que-la-wah was but a beginning of greater woes to come;
for he in whom her soul delighted should be deceived, forsake his
faithful wife, and she should narrowly escape with life. Moreover,
there should be a strife for empire, and a race of white men who had
gained a footing near the rising sun, from small beginnings should
sweep over and subdue the entire land. Still her own nation should
not be without renown, for lo! a chief should arise who should bear
sway over many tribes, and lead his warriors to successful battles;
and when at last his limbs should be bound in fetters, his soul would
be unsubdued: his name should never perish, and the Holy Virgin
would vouchsafe protection to Gentle Dove.</p>

<p>Omaint-si-ar-nah dispatched another messenger. Meantime, Que-la-wah,
finding that his proffers were rejected, vowed revenge. He
bribed the courier whom the chieftain sent with tidings to his wife, so
that she received them not, and returned no answer; but he bore
back word that he had delivered them, and that Gentle Dove had
treated them with marked contempt; that she was inconstant and
abandoned, and had violated her pledge. On the receipt of these
cruel tidings, the chief went into a paroxysm of rage. He commanded
those who stood near him to draw their bows and shoot him. As
none obeyed, he was about to drive a dart into his own breast, but
the weapon was wrested from his hand. Then the flame of love being
quite extinguished, a violent hate reigned in its place, and he resolved
that the base woman who had betrayed his hopes should speedily die.

<!-- page 66 -->

He dispatched an emissary, to whom he gave secret orders to entice
his wife into the forest, under pretence that he bore tidings from her
lord, when he should slay her, and immediately return to the camp,
bringing with him a lock of her hair as a pledge that his errand had
been accomplished.</p>

<p>The round orb of the setting sun was just visible above the waves
of the yellow Mississippi. Nito-me-ma stood in the door of her tent,
weeping and dejected, pressing to her bosom her new-born child, and
sometimes, according to the faith which she had imbibed, appealing to
the protection of the Virgin, sobbing out in short ejaculations, "O
sweet Mary, holy Mary, Mother of <span class="smcap">God</span>, pray for me!" Thus
engaged in devotion, her eyes were uplifted to heaven; but when
again they were cast downward, a strange form stood before her. So
stealthily had he glided through the thickets, that his presence was
like that of a spirit. For a moment he stood erect in silence, as if
spell-bound by her charms.</p>

<p>The expression of maternal love added a new grace to the pale
face of the poor child of sorrow, and her bright yet tender eyes were
brimming over with tears. Her hair, as if unloosed on purpose to be
rifled for the sacrificial token, fell upon her glossy shoulders and
almost touched the ground, and, like a mute and unoffending victim,
ready for the altar, she stood as if to wait the mandate of the avenging
priest.</p>

<p>The stranger stretched his naked arm, and pointed with his finger
to the sun. "See!" he said, in a low voice like a whisper, "he is
departing; the day is almost dead. The winds cease to move the
tree-leaves; the waves cease to murmur. But it is not dark; it is
not silent. Go with me to the deepest thicket at a distance from the
curling smoke of tents. Over the mountains I have come, through
the rivers. A message sent so far for one beloved is not for common
ears. Fear not, Gentle Dove!"</p>

<p>Trembling and agitated, still pressing her babe to her breast and
praying as she went, she followed his footsteps, which were rapid, so
that she could scarce keep pace with them, with her burden in her
arms. It was nearly dark when, arriving at a most secluded spot, her
guide suddenly turned, and without the delay of a moment, as if he

<!-- page 67 -->

feared that pity might gain the mastery over him in the sight of so
much beauty, assumed a stern aspect, and commanded her to lay down
her child.</p>

<p>"Nito-me-ma!" he exclaimed, "prepare to die instantly, as the
penalty of unfaithfulness. I am the avenging messenger of your husband,
and I dare not disobey his bidding. That the blow may be
surer and less painful, do not resist a fate which is inevitable.
Kneel!"</p>

<p>He snatched his tomahawk from his girdle, and raised it on high.
Gentle Dove, who, for her own sake, would have gladly died, looked
on her innocent child; then, with a wild, impassioned eloquence,
begged a few moments respite to send up a prayer to <span class="smcap">God</span>. Her
request was granted, and she poured forth her soul for heavenly aid
in such a strain as well might make the angels weep. The <span class="smcap">Great
Spirit</span> heard it. The delay which had been allowed by Omaint-si-ar-nah's
messenger was fatal to his resolution. Three times he whirled
his hatchet round his head, then struck it deep into the trunk of the
nearest tree, and yielded to compassion. In truth, his savage soul had
first been melted when he stood before the tent.</p>

<p>He spared the life of Nito-me-ma on one condition: that she would
retire into the thickest forest, and never more be seen among her
tribe. Having exacted such a promise, he shore a long lock of her
raven hair, gazed at her in a long, admiring silence, replaced his
hatchet in his girdle, and then, as loth to go, he turned upon his heel
and stalked away. "I have disobeyed my chieftain," he wailed aloud
when at a little distance; then he beat his breast and exclaimed, "The
<span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span> is my chieftain, and <span class="smcap">He</span> spoke to me from here." He was
inclined to turn again and shield the unprotected wanderer; but when
he reached the river's brink he flung himself into his bark canoe,
and waiting for the moon to rise, he slept upon the murky tide.</p>

<p>Gentle Dove, when left alone to perish, as might be supposed, by
a more cruel, lingering death, moved slowly onward through the dark,
she knew not where. Entering a deep hollow, she found it filled with
dry leaves, and, lying down with her child, the breeze of the night came
along, and with a sudden gust, covered them lightly with the same, so
that the chilling dews should not benumb them. More useful thus

<!-- page 68 -->

the perished twigs than when upon the oaken crowns they shone in
glossy verdure, and were vital in the spring-time of the year. The
wolves howling for their evening repast might be heard in the distance,
but Nito-me-ma slept sweetly on her sylvan couch, and feared
no evil. On the morrow she rose up refreshed, and went away into her
woody exile far from her husband's tent. She would return no more,
but <span class="smcap">God</span> would be her sole protector. For three days she travelled
in the forest, till, arriving at a very secret place, where she perceived
no trails had been, she kneeled upon the sod, and, by a short act of
private devotion, consecrated it as her future home. It was a narrow
vale, sheltered by a gigantic growth, and without brambles or under
wood. The soft green sod was a carpet for her bare feet, and a pure
fountain gushed up hard by from a bed of little white pebbles. A
snail's shell served as a water-cup, and searching in the neighborhood
for a place to build her tent, a vast tree, hollowed out at the base, was
revealed to her, quite ample in accommodation for herself and child.
She now sought the means of life, that the fount which flowed in her
bosom might not be dry. Roots and berries would not supply its
rich life-stream, but Nito-me-ma had not lived in the forest in vain.
Wandering beyond the limits of her domain, she came upon an open
place in the wilderness where the sun shone down, and her eyes were
delighted by the sight of a field of wild maize. Day by day she transported
the treasure to her habitation, until it was all housed and her
bread was sure. From the white husks she wove a matting for her
habitation, and the sweet stalks she stored away elsewhere, and she
beat the grain in a rude mortar; but as she sat in the door-way,
Nito-me-ma reflected that she had no fire to bake the crisp-cakes
withal. But the same <span class="smcap">God</span> who gave her daily bread struck a dry
pine-tree in one of his glorious storms, and enkindled its bark as if
with the very sparks of His pity. From that time the flame died not
on the domestic hearth; and when the shades of night came down, it
shone with soft effulgence on the mother and her child. Nito-me-ma
found a sharp-edged stone in the brook, with which she hewed down a
lithe sapling, and having woven a strong cord for her bow, and selected
some reeds for arrows, she shot the little birds and dressed them for
food, and she entrapped the mountain trout in their fastnesses, and

<!-- page 69 -->

preserved them in the waters of a salt spring which she discovered
about a league off from her home. She laid away great store of dried
fruits and berries, and pleasant herbs and flowers, and sassafras and
birch, and sweet barks. In one moon before the hoar frosts had
whitened the ground, her store-house was so well furnished that she
could have no dread of famine, and might even entertain a pilgrim in
distress. The furniture of her abode accorded also with her wants: a
bed made of dry husks, with a covering of the same, a chair woven of
the wild willow, and a slight table of the same; for cups, gourds and
snail-shells, and vessels of rude pottery made by her own hands. At
morning, noon, and night, she offered prayers to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and invoked the
Virgin.</p>

<p>Gentle Dove seemed to live within a charmed circle. Wild beasts
and venomous serpents did not find their way therein, and the more
dreaded foot of man intruded not; but myriads of birds flew into the
inclosures, both those of gorgeous plumage and of dulcet song&mdash;the
bobolink and the oriole, and the pure white doves. The humming-birds
came in quest of honeysuckles and the Missouri rose-buds, which
clustered around the poor child's door. Moreover, the fawns skipped
on the grass before the hollow tree, but she could not find it in her
heart to pierce them with her arrows. They were the delight of her
eyes, and at last approached and ate out of her hand. While her
child slumbered on the bed of husks, Gentle Dove sat without, singing
in a low sweet voice the hymns Marquette had taught her; nor
were these moments spent in idleness: she wove willow baskets, or
made sandals from the bark of trees, blankets, and garments for her
little one. Oh! how sweetly it slumbered!&mdash;it seemed to thrive more
and more every day, and in features more and more resembled its
mother. "Morning-Glory" was its name, and every morning Nito-me-ma
took it to the spring, and poured the cold crystal waters upon
it, so that it became hardy, and its olive complexion glowed with
health. She had already baptized it, but not in the waves of the
fountain. When she first came into the wilderness, perceiving that
the child's face was wet with tears which had dropped from her own
eyes, she signed the cross upon its forehead, and in those holy drops
which welled up from a broken heart, christened it in the name of the

<!-- page 70 -->

undivided <span class="smcap">Trinity</span>. Swung upon her shoulders, Morning-Glory was
the constant attendant of all her walks, no matter how great the distance,
or what additional burden she expected to bear.</p>

<p>A mother with her child, can feel no solitude. Every place is a
desert without it; with it, there are people enough in the unpeopled
waste. It is music where there is no voice, and speech where there
is no language, and a host of friends where all have departed, a blue
sky where there is nothing but clouds, and a flower in the unwatered
wilderness. But this little wood-nymph, in its hollow tree, made the
whole ground enchanted. The winds sighing in the branches seemed to
Gentle Dove like angels of heaven which whispered its lullaby. Alas!
it was only when she thought that her child was without a father, that
this dream of bliss was doomed to be interrupted. But never had her
love for her husband become abated, nor had such cruel treatment
stirred one feeling of resentment in her soul. In truth, she hardly
learned to love him till she was forced to pity and forgive!</p>

<p>How different from this peaceful sanctuary the scenes where
Omaint-si-ar-nah walked in gloom! With desperate rage he rushed
into the thick of battle. He raged and ravened like a wolf upon the
bloody field, and scalped his foes and brought off many trophies; but
most of all, he sought to terminate a life which was no longer to be
desired. The very sun was hateful to his sight, and so irascible
became his temper, that his own friends would scarce approach him
in his fits of moody melancholy, lest in a moment he should strike
them dead. He had been deceived by the wife of his bosom, in whom
he trusted, and he now suspected all of being traitors. In fact, he
was betrayed and blinded; but she who was so grossly injured did
not cease to pray for his preservation, and that the scales might be
removed from her husband's eyes.</p>

<p>One day, with bow and arrows, and a basket on her arm and with
Morning-Glory on her back, Gentle Dove went forth to search for
eggs of pheasants and the prairie-hen. She wandered far, and was
just stooping to complete her store, when her quick ear detected the
approaching sound of steps. Gliding into a thicket, she moved
not and dared scarcely breathe. In a moment, Que-la-wah, detested
traitor, appeared in sight. Low stooping, with his eyes fastened on

<!-- page 71 -->

the ground, he examined footsteps in the sand. Then he laid down
his bow and game, and first looking upward, stood with his back
against a tree.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">God</span> of Justice!" exclaimed Gentle Dove, "nerve thy weak creature's
arm!"</p>

<p>She placed her child upon the ground, chose from her quiver a
Well-sharpened arrow and fitted it to the string. Fixing her keen eye
for the moment on the mark she aimed at, she drew the weapon to its
flinty head and let it speed. The whizzing shaft just grazed the ear
of the false savage, and quivered in the bark.</p>

<p>"Lost!" said Gentle Dove, but did not remove her gaze, and fitted
another arrow to the string.</p>

<p>Que-la-wah leaped aloft and uttered a terrific yell, and leaving after
him his bow and game, fled quickly to the thickest woods. Then
Nito-me-ma inscribed a cross upon the tree in token of deliverance,
and gathering at its foot the small wild flowers, she bore them home
and wove a votive chaplet for her shrine.</p>

<p>The autumn passed away; the falling leaves and sombre skies
announced that winter was at hand. Nito-me-ma laid up a great
store of brushwood, and dry turf and pitchy bark, and prepared a
wadded curtain for the opening in the hollow tree, and made thick
brooms of twigs wherewith to sweep away the snows, and little lamps
of clay to be used in the long winter evenings, and garments of the
furs of rabbits, and a soft couch for her child from the down of the
prairie-hen, and treasured up eggs in the waters taken from the salt
spring. Thus having done all for safety which her knowledge
prompted, she waited without apprehension for the cutting blasts
and for thick-falling snows. Beautiful and like a conqueror came
on October in the distant west, with gorgeous plumes and purple
hues, like hectic flushes of the dying. A thin blue vapor floated over
vale and mountain-top; the air was fragrant with the scent of straw
berry-leaves, while the still genial sun encouraged vegetation and
wooed the prairie-rose to bloom. The wild grapes hung in tempting
clusters from the high trees of the forest, as if the produce of the elm
and vine. Then often at the hour of sunset, when the birds hid their
heads beneath their wings, and all the labors of the day were finished,

<!-- page 72 -->

would Nito-me-ma sing an evening hymn, or with a low and plaintive
melody, strike into a little voluntary of her own:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"My <span class="smcap">Morning-Glory</span> is the pride of the forest:
Nothing so sweet beneath the stars:
Opens its blue eyes in the morning and closes its lids at night:
It has but a slender support to lean on,
For its strong prop has been taken away.
It climbs o'er a sorrowful ruin,
And its cup, it is filled with briny tears.
Wind round me, sweet <span class="smcap">Morning-Glory</span>,
And bind up the stem which holds up thee."</p>

</div>

<p>At last the snows descended and lay in pyramidal layers on the
pines and evergreens, and the air was nipping cold, but it entered not
the barken inclosure, nor touched the little nymph at the foot of the
oak. Gentle Dove was happy in those dark days. The snow-birds
hopped about her abode, to receive crumbs from her humble table,
and left their footprints all around. She had no book to read from,
nor had she learned the art of reading, but Morning-Glory was an
opening and expanding revelation, full of poetry and irradiated with
hope. At night, when the winds howled, and, in sympathy with the
uplifted head, the sides of the living house in which she dwelt were
contorted and sent forth groans as if in pain, she made moccasins by
the dim light of her lamp, with her feet near the hot embers, and so
beguiled the weary time. She dared not wander during the wintry
months, for the wolves were hungry, and their howlings could be
heard for miles on the air. Beyond the forests the illimitable prairies
were covered with a white mantle, and the Father of Waters was
frozen-up.</p>

<p>When the natal day of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came, Gentle Dove adorned her
sanctuary with laurel and with green twigs, and out of doors built
an altar of pure white snows, and wreathed it round with running
vines, and placed thereon the dried-up votive chaplet, and she called
it the Altar of Deliverance. It was not destitute of other offerings,
for the trees dropped icicles, and covered it with crystal gems. At
last the thaws began, and the green blades of grass peeped forth upon

<!-- page 73 -->

the sunny knolls, and the blue violets appeared, first heralds of the
spring, and the fragrant buds swelled out, and tender leaves appeared.
Another ordeal had been safely passed, while new hope and confidence
animated the grateful heart of Nito-me-ma. She came forth from her
retreat, and erected a summer bower more ample in accommodations
than the one which she left, working at it during the intervals in which
her child reposed. She bent the crowns of tall young saplings, and
fastening them together at the top with strong cords, she interwove
the intervals with pliant boughs, and having completed it in a short
time moved thither her domestic goods. So sweetly stole the hours
away, and never was one more happy in unhappiness, or more supported
when support appeared to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The arrival of the lovely month of May awakened a feeling of
ecstasy in the heart of Gentle Dove. In that month she was born and
married, and in that her child was born; nay, more, at that season
she had been converted to the religion of the Cross, and every fortunate
circumstance of her life was connected with it, and it was associated
with a thousand happy memories. Its balmy breath infused
new life into her system, for she was somewhat pale and wan with
watching and confinement, and again she hurried forth with Morning-Glory
on her shoulders, to gather flowers in the distant vale. Her
provision of maize was still far from exhausted, but she had been
obliged to mix the cakes with water, and long ago the bread had
become poor to the taste. Her unpampered palate required still the
luxury of milk. She was just thinking of this, although by no means
murmuring, when, in a grassy nook, she suddenly encountered a
female buffalo quietly grazing, with her young by her side. It was as
tame as if brought up among the haunts of men. She fed it with
hand's-full of green and tender grass, and, unmolested, placed her tiny
palms upon its forehead. When she retreated, the cow followed her,
and never ceased to track her footsteps until she arrived before her
bower. From that time she drained its milk day by day in the hollow
of a wild gourd, and it gave sustenance to herself and to her
child.</p>

<p>Nito-me-ma used to rise at day-break, and, after washing herself
in the cool brook, and offering up her devotions, she walked within

<!-- page 74 -->

sight of her home until the time of her morning meal. In one of
these excursions she was clambering up a ledge of rocks when she
dipped her hands into some wild honeycomb filled with sweets, and
made of the earliest flowers of spring. Thoughtlessly she broke it
into fragments, and piled the delicious masses into an apron made of
leaves, while all around her head the bees buzzed busily without the
infliction of a sting. Although in faith a Christian, Gentle Dove
adhered religiously to many customs of her ancestors, so far as they
did not conflict with her Christian faith. She loved her tribe and people,
and her own dear home, from which she was banished, and she
longed to dwell again among her kindred, to assuage their ferocious
spirit, and to teach them the offices of kindness and of love. Day
after day passed away in her hopeless solitude, and brought no tidings
from her distant lord. Yet she had the most manifest proofs of the
Divine protection in the little miracles which diversified her lonely
career. The courier had taken that lock of hair from her devoted
head, and carried it to Omaint-si-ar-nah at his encampment, who supposed
that his cruel mandate had been obeyed. Hence he continued
to be reckless of life, and did not make haste to return to the homes
of his fathers.</p>

<p>In the mean time Morning-Glory increased in stature, and was
straight and slender as a reed. So soon as she could be made to
comprehend, she was instructed in the first principles of the Christian
faith. In the cathedral-like and solemn gloom of primitive woods,
each day her little hands were clasped in prayer, and the whole place
was rendered consecrate. There was a music in her lisping voice,
which rose to heaven with a more buoyant ease than sound of organs
and of jubilant anthems in the temple-naves. In the pure waters of
the spring, which gushed up hard by, might sometimes be seen a wild
little picture, the image of Morning-Glory&mdash;her face stained with
berries, her hair stuck full of the feathers of gay birds, and her waist
wound around with a cincture of flowers. She was already skillful in
the use of the bow and in casting a small javelin; she was no longer
swung upon her mother's back, nay, in case of danger and attack,
Morning-Glory might have been an efficient auxiliary, because she
could direct a deadly arrow, and did not know the sentiment of

<!-- page 75 -->

fear. But her mother did not permit her out of sight for a moment.
Deprived of her sweet child, her sole companion, the spirits of Gentle
Dove would have sunk beyond recovery. One morning, having slept
soundly, on awaking, she found that Morning Glory had risen before
her, and gone out of the house. In dread alarm, she rushed into the
wood, and lifted up her voice, and shrieked aloud; but no answer was
returned, save the mocking echo, "Morning-Glory! Morning-Glory!"
She ran hither and thither, she knew not where, and peered into the
thickets with a keen eye, and tried to track her by the footprints of
her tiny feet, and kept continually calling her by name, weeping and
beating her breast the while, but no Morning-Glory! Exhausted by
exertion, and overpowered with grief, Gentle Dove came and cast her
self upon her cot in an agony bordering on despair. But as the day
declined, and she had given up all for lost, the clear and ringing
laughter of the little rover was heard without, and she approached
with two young turtle-doves, which she had only slightly wounded.
Nito-me-ma clasped her to her bosom, and her convulsions of joy were
almost fatal. When a little recovered, she thought to punish her for
so wild and disobedient an act, but she could not find in her heart to
lay a finger upon her, and she did nothing but weep upon the head of
Morning-Glory a shower of sparkling tears.</p>

<p>The child had, perhaps, attained her sixth year, and the life in the
grove was but little varied, when Omaint-si-ar-nah, tired of roaming,
returned with his warriors to the place whence they had set out. His
wigwam was burned to the ground, his old mother was dead, his
Gentle Dove (as he thought) was murdered. He walked apart and
spent his days in gloom, while his warriors dared not approach him,
for he was more ferocious and hostile in spirit than before. One day
he was wandering listlessly on the bank of a stream, waiting for a deer
which was swimming with its current, when his attention was attracted
by some hieroglyphics on a tree, understood by Nito-me-ma and him
self. They were the emblems of true love; and, on close inspection,
he discovered that some of them had been freshly made, and signified
affection which has changed not, and which is unchangeable. Their
time of being made was posterior surely to that when she whom he
suspected had been accounted false. Then the sad truth flashed in on

<!-- page 76 -->

his benighted soul; he struck his brow with violence, and groaned
aloud. He took the raven tresses from his bosom, sole relic of his
once-loved wife, and, sitting down upon a fallen trunk, spake to himself
in mournful accents, and in the figurative language of the Indian
tribes: "O Nito-me-ma, Dove of the Forest, Beautiful Pride of the
Prairie, torn away by cruel fate. Her breath was sweeter than the
mountain balm; her eyes were like the wild fawn's eyes; and her
teeth, white as the snow-flakes newly fallen. Where wanders my
love by the crystal rivers of the Spirit-Land? Omaint-si-ar-nah's
heart is gloomy as the cypress-grove at midnight when the moon
goes down. His arm has lost its strength, and his feet cease from
running. O Gentle Dove, come to me from the land of ghosts!"</p>

<p>"The chief walks alone," said a voice almost at Omaint-si-ar-nah's
ear. He turned, and Gray-Eagle stood before him, the commissioner
of blood.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the former, clutching in his hand the lock of hair,
"you have executed your errand well, and have shed innocent blood."
He restored the lock to his bosom, placed his left hand on the hatchet
in his girdle, and raising his right arm to heaven, "By the <span class="smcap">Great
Spirit</span>!" he added, "we shall both die, and that before yon sun goes
down."</p>

<p>Gray-Eagle stood erect and smiled a moment without reply. He
walked slowly down to the margin of the brook, dipped a shell in
water, and poured it over his hands.</p>

<p>"Thou art not exonerated," said Omaint-si-ar-nah.</p>

<p>"I am, Chief," replied the Gray-Eagle.</p>

<p>Omaint-si-ar-nah grasped his tomahawk, and made a threatening
motion as if to strike him dead.</p>

<p>Gray-Eagle smiled again, and did not move.</p>

<p>"Hear me," he said; "I have disobeyed my chieftain, but these
hands have not been stained with blood. The Gentle Dove still
lives."</p>

<p>"Lives!" said the other, and he clasped his hands and stood a
long time rooted to the soil&mdash;"lives!" he exclaimed in ecstasy;
"then <i>I</i> live; then the sun shines; then the grass grows. Speak on."</p>

<p>"I never slew her. I brought you but the token of unchanged

<!-- page 77 -->

affection, and not the stain of blood. I have not made your house
desolate, nor your child motherless."</p>

<p>The chieftain struck his javelin in the earth. "My child?" he
shrieked in a voice which made the woods ring again, a combination
of ecstasy and agony and surprise&mdash;"my <i>child?</i>"</p>

<p>"Your child!" replied the Gray-Eagle.</p>

<p>"Whither gone?" said Omaint-si-ar-nah.</p>

<p>"You ask too much of me," answered the Gray-Eagle. "If I did
not take away their lives, could I keep them from dying? A man
can kill, but the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span> keeps alive, and <span class="smcap">He</span> only. I know not
where they are."</p>

<p>"Enough," said Omaint-si-ar-nah. "All will be well. Gray-Eagle
soars aloft and stoops not low." With the end of his spear he
described a circle on the ground, and, placing the end of it in the centre,
he drew many radii. "To-night," he said, "we sleep as if the
sleep of death. When the sun dawns, each man, yea, every woman
of the tribe, will start from here, and travel toward the rising and
the setting sun, and every point, until she is found whom my soul
loveth."</p>

<p>"Stay!" said Gray-Eagle, "you will go too early in the search.
Punish traitors first before you haste to seek for the betrayed. Your
Faithful Friend is at the bottom of this mischief. Que-la-wah strove
to win the Gentle Dove. She drove him off with fierce rebuke, and
hence he vowed revenge."</p>

<p>Omaint-si-ar-nah grasped the hand of the Gray-Eagle, and while a
fierce vindictive look flashed over him, he said, "To-morrow! yes,
to-morrow!" then pressed the lock of hair unto his lips, wrapped
his blanket round him, and sank upon the ground, even on the very
spot where he had stood and slept.</p>

<p>Soon as the first beams of day appeared, the chief went forth alone
to punish a man who had betrayed his trust. He found Que-la-wah
gathering sticks to make his morning meal. "Base villain," he
exclaimed, "thou shalt die." And with that he beat him to the earth,
and left his body for the crows and vultures of the air to prey upon.
Thus did the spirit of implacable revenge find place in the same heart
which was just opening anew to the genial influences of affection.

<!-- page 78 -->

Que-la-wah suffered not beyond his just deserts. The ruthless
invader of the domestic sanctuary is held a savage among savages,
and unworthy to enjoy the boon of life.</p>

<p>Omaint-si-ar-nah dispatched his warriors and chosen men, while he
and Gray-Eagle set their faces due north to hunt up the nest of Gentle
Dove. A secret voice assured him that she still lived. For three
days they travelled to no purpose, calling loudly, wherever they went,
the name of Nito-me-ma.</p>

<p>"A cruel husband," said the chief, sorrowfully, "who banishes his
wife, puts her, indeed, afar off. Great is the interval betwixt them.
Moons wax and wane. Rivers flow. Time and distance interpose
their great gulfs. There is no straight line; we wander uncertain, for
the ways of the ungrateful are crooked."</p>

<p>On the fourth day, Omaint-si-ar-nah found an arrow sticking in an
oak, and beneath it were hieroglyphic symbols lately cut, for the
wounded bark had not long healed over them. Here was the spot
where the lurking traitor stood who had since met his doom. The
chief examined the inscription carefully, then clapped his hands and
uttered a slight yell. Gray-Eagle made a signal from a distance.
On the margin of a brook he had discovered the tiny foot-prints of a
child, and near by were pebbles and smooth stones arranged upon the
sands, while a critical scrutiny of the surrounding places showed that
the twigs had been slightly bent aside or broken. Following these
indications for several hours, and often losing the faint trail toward
sun-down, Omaint-si-ar-nah paused suddenly.</p>

<p>"I smell the smell of smoke," said he. "Wigwams are not far
off." He put his ear close to the ground, then rose up, tightened his
girdle, and called Gray-Eagle to his side. "Advance," said he, moving
with rapidity, "let not the grass grow in the path." As the day
declined, they came upon the certain signs of a habitation. The earth
was well tracked and beaten in diverging foot-paths, the sound of
voices began to be heard, and the low chaunting of an Indian song.
At last the bower of Gentle Dove appeared in sight. She sat without
it in the shade, engaged in painting and in decorating barken sandals,
and busily intent upon her work. Morning-Glory was feeding the
tame buffalo with handfuls of the wild clover. Omaint-si-ar-nah

<!-- page 79 -->

remained unobserved for a few moments; then he commanded Gray-Eagle
to stand at a distance, and, silently approaching, stood before
his wife. Confounded at his sudden presence, she rose up, and was
deprived of speech. A sudden pallor diffused itself over her features,
and she trembled like an aspen leaf in the breeze. The chief lifted
her in his arms; he pressed her to his bosom; he kissed her cold
brow again and again, and as he smoothed down her glossy locks with
his hand, and spoke in the accents of tenderness, big tears rolled down
his scarred and furrowed countenance. Nito-me-ma dropped her head
upon his shoulder and wept, then beckoning to Morning-Glory, lightly
and gracefully the child came leaping to her mother. Omaint-si-ar-nah
burst into a loud yell of extreme delight. He caught her in his
arms, adorned her neck with tinkling ornaments, and called her
Dancing Fawn, and Rippling Rill, and Waving Feather, and all the
endearing titles which he knew, but she said her name was Morning-Glory.
She did not fear the warrior's savage aspect, and with her
earliest speech she had been taught the name of father. Omaint-si-ar-nah
beckoned to Gray-Eagle, who still kept aloof, and told him to
approach. Then Nito-me-ma prepared a sumptuous entertainment
for her guests; smoked meats, and cakes of Indian maize, and snow-white
milk, and honey-comb, and dainties long laid up. Pleasantly
the time passed in mutual narrative, and on the morrow they prepared
to hurry back to the deserted camp. Great was the joy of the
whole tribe on the return of Gentle Dove and Morning-Glory. Three
whole days were spent in rejoicing. Feasts were spread in profusion
while the young amused themselves with dances and wrestling and
ball-play, and the sports adapted to their age.</p>

<p>The second nuptials were never marred by bitterness or grief.
Moon followed moon, and plenty blessed the tribe, which laid aside
the hatchet as if a peaceful angel came into their midst. A Christian
church now stands upon the spot where the poor pilgrim raised her
cross within the hollow of the tree, and the sweet sound of Sunday
chimes invites the worshippers of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Omaint-si-ar-nah lost his
savage nature, though he did not openly profess the faith of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>;
but when the evening of his days came on, and she who had been true
to him till death slept with her fathers in the quiet grave, to children

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Stand</span> here by my side and turn, I pray,
    On the lake below thy gentle eyes;
The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,
    And dark and silent the water lies;
And out of that frozen mist the snow
In wavering flakes begins to flow;
                Flake after flake,
They sink in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<p class="stanza">See how in a living swarm they come
    From the chambers beyond that misty veil.
Some hover awhile in air, and some
    Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.
All, dropping swiftly or settling slow,
Meet and are still in the depth below;
                Flake after flake,
Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<p class="stanza">Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud
    Come floating downward in airy play,
Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd
    That whiten by night the milky way;
There broader and burlier masses fall;
The sullen water buries them all;
                Flake after flake,
All drowned in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p class="stanza">And some, as on tender wings they glide
    From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,
Are joined in their fall, and, side by side,
    Come clinging along their unsteady way;
As friend with friend or husband with wife
Makes hand in hand the passage of life;
                Each mated flake
Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<p class="stanza">Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste
    Stream down the snows, till the air is white,
As, myriads by myriads madly chased,
    They fling themselves from their shadowy height.
The fair frail creatures of middle sky,
What speed they make with their grave so nigh;
                Flake after flake,
To lie in the dark and silent lake!</p>

<p class="stanza">I see in thy gentle eyes a tear;
    They turn to me in sorrowful thought;
Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,
    Who were for a time and now are not;
Like these fair children of cloud and frost,
That glisten a moment, and then are lost,
                Flake after flake,
All lost in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<p class="stanza">Yet look again, for the clouds divide;
    A gleam of blue on the water lies;
And far away, on the mountain side,
    A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.
But the hurrying host that flew between
The cloud and the water no more is seen;
                Flake after flake,
At rest in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<h3 id="c09">A Day at St. Helena.</h3>

<p>FROM THE LOG-BOOK OF MY HOMEWARD VOYAGE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY BAYARD TAYLOR.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three passengers on board of the clipper-ship Sea-Serpent,
bound from Whampoa to New-York, were greatly delighted to learn
from Capt. Howland, on the day when they crossed the tropic of
Capricorn, that the water was getting short, and he had therefore
decided to touch at St. Helena for a fresh supply. We had already
been more than sixty days on board, and the sea, with all its wonderful
fascination, was growing monotonous. Here was an event which,
in addition to its positive interest, would give us at least five days of
anticipation and a week of active remembrance, virtually shortening
our voyage to that extent; for at sea we measure time less by the
calendar than by our individual sense of its duration. I have spent
several months on shipboard, when, according to the almanac, barely
a fortnight had elapsed.</p>

<p>The trade-wind bore us slowly northward, and when I went on
deck at sunrise, four days afterward, St. Helena was in sight, about
twenty-five miles distant. It was a dark-blue mass, filling about
twenty degrees of the horizon, and of nearly uniform elevation above
the sea, but gradually resolved itself into sharper and more broken
outlines as we approached. Except upon a lofty terrace on the
southern side, where there was a tinge of green and some traces of
fields, the coast presented a frightfully rocky and inhospitable appearance.
Nevertheless it displayed some grand effects of coloring. The
walls of naked rock, several hundred feet high, which rose boldly

<!-- page 84 -->

from the sea, in some places overhanging their base, were tinted
as by</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">        "the deep-blue gloom
Of thunder-shower,"</p>

</div>

<p>the hollow chasms between them being filled with gorgeous masses
of purple-black shadow, under the sultry clouds which hung over the
island. At the south-eastern extremity were two pointed, isolated
rocks, probably a hundred feet high. We stood around the opposite
extremity of the island, making for the port of Jamestown, which
faces the north-west. The coast on this side rises into two bold
heads, one of which projects outward like a gigantic capstan, while
the other runs slantingly up to a pointed top, which is crowned with
a signal station. The rock has a dark bluish-slate color, with streaks
of a warm reddish-brown, and the strata, burst apart in the centre, yet
slanting upward toward each other like the sides of a volcano, tell of
upheaval by some tremendous subterranean agency. The structure
of the island is purely volcanic, and, except the rock of Aden, on the
coast of Arabia, I never saw a more forbidding spot.</p>

<p>The breeze increased as we drew near the island, but when we
ran under the lee of the great cliffs, fell away almost entirely, so that
we drifted lazily along within half a mile of them. At length a battery
hove in sight, quarried in the face of the precipice, and anchored
vessels, one by one, came out behind the point. We stood off a little,
urged along by occasional flaws of wind, and in a short time the shallow
bight which forms the roadstead of St. Helena lay before us.
There was another battery near at hand, at the foot of a deep, barren
glen, called Rupert's Valley, from which a road, notched in the rock,
leads around the intervening cliffs to the gorge, at the bottom of
which Jamestown is built. A sea-wall across the mouth of this gorge,
a row of ragged trees, weather-beaten by the gales of the Atlantic,
and the spire of a church, were all that appeared of the town. The
walls of the fort crowned the lofty cliff above, and high behind them
towered the signal station, on the top of a conical peak, the loftiest in
the island. The stone ladder which leads from the tower to the fort
was marked on the face of the cliff like a white ribbon unrolled from
its top. Inland, a summit covered with dark pine-trees, from the

<!-- page 85 -->

midst of which glimmered the white front of a country mansion, rose
above the naked heights of the shore. This was the only gleam of
fertility which enlivened the terrible sterility of the view.</p>

<p>Further in-shore a few gun-boats and water-boats lay at anchor,
and some fishing-skiffs were pulling about. As we forged slowly
along to a good anchoring ground, the American consul came off, followed
by a boarding-officer, and we at once received permission to go
ashore and make the most of our short stay. The consul's boat
speedily conveyed us to the landing-place, at the eastern extremity of
the town. Every thing had a dreary and deserted air. There were
half-a-dozen men and boys, with Portuguese features and uncertain
complexions, about the steps, a red-coated soldier at a sentry-box, and
two or three lonely-looking individuals under the weather-beaten
trees. Passing a row of mean houses built against the overhanging
rock, a draw-bridge over a narrow moat admitted us within the walls.
A second wall and gate, a short distance further, ushered us into the
public square of Jamestown. Even at its outlet, the valley is not
more than a hundred and fifty yards wide, and the little town is
crowded, or rather jammed, deep in its bottom, between nearly perpendicular
cliffs, seven or eight hundred feet in height. At the top
of the square is the church, a plain yellowish structure, with a tall,
square, pointed spire, and beyond it Market street, the main thoroughfare
of the little place, opens up the valley.</p>

<p>A carriage&mdash;almost the only one in Jamestown&mdash;was procured
for Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;; my fellow-passenger, P&mdash;&mdash;, provided himself
with a saddle-horse, and we set out for Longwood. We had a
mounted Portuguese postillion and rattled up the steep and stony
main street in a style which drew upon us the eyes of all Jamestown.
The road soon left the town, ascending the right side of the ravine by
a very long and steep grade. Behind the town are the barracks of
the soldiery and their parade-ground&mdash;all on a cramped and contracted
scale; then some dreary burial-grounds, the graves in which
resembled heaps of cinders; then a few private mansions, and green
garden-patches, winding upward for a mile or more. The depth and
narrowness of the gorge completely shut out the air; the heat was
radiated powerfully from its walls of black volcanic rock, and the

<!-- page 86 -->

bristling cacti and yuccas by the roadside, with full-crowned cocoa
palms below, gave it a fiery, savage, tropical character. The peak of
the signal-station loomed high above us from the opposite side, and
now the head of the ravine&mdash;a precipice several hundred feet high,
over which fell a silver thread of water&mdash;came into sight. This
water supplies the town and shipping, beside fertilizing the gardens
in the bed of the ravine. It is clear as crystal, and of the sweetest
and freshest quality. Looking backward, we saw the spire of the
little church at the bottom projected against the blue plain of ocean,
the pigmy hulls of the vessels in the roads, and a great triangular
slice of sea, which grew wider and longer as we ascended, until the
horizon was full fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>Near the top of the ravine there is a natural terrace about a quarter
of a mile in length, lying opposite to the cascade. It contains a
few small fields, divided by scrubby hedges, and, near the further end,
two pleasant dwelling-houses, surrounded by a garden in which I saw
some fine orange-trees. This is "The Briars," memorable from having
been Napoleon's first residence on the island. The Balcombe
family occupied the larger of the two dwellings, which is flanked by
tall Italian cypresses, while the other building, which was then a summer
pavilion, but was afterward enlarged to accommodate the Emperor
and his suite, received him on the very night of his landing
from the Bellerophon. It stands on a little knoll, overlooking a deep
glen, which debouches into the main valley just below. The place is
cheerful though solitary; it has a sheltered, sunny aspect, compared
with the bleak heights of Longwood, and I do not wonder that the
great exile left it with regret. Miss Balcombe's account of Napoleon's
sojourn at "The Briars" is among the most striking reminiscences
of his life on the island.</p>

<p>Just above the terrace the road turned, and, after a shorter ascent,
gained the crest of the ridge, where the grade became easier, and the
cool south-east trade-wind, blowing over the height, refreshed us after
the breathless heat of the ravine. The road was bordered with pine-trees,
and patches of soft green turf took the place of the volcanic dust
and cinders. The flower-stems of the aloe-plants, ten feet in height,
had already begun to wither, but the purple buds of the cactus were

<!-- page 87 -->

opening, and thick clusters of a watery, succulent plant were starred
with white, pink, and golden blossoms. We had now attained the
central upland of the island, which slopes downward in all directions
to the summit of the sea-wall of cliffs. On emerging again from the
wood, a landscape of a very different character met our view. Over
a deep valley, the sides of which were alternately green with turf and
golden with patches of blossoming broom, we looked upon a ridge of
table-land three or four miles long, near the extremity of which, surrounded
by a few straggling trees, we saw the houses of Longwood.
In order to reach them, it was necessary to pass around the head of
the intervening valley. In this direction the landscape was green and
fresh, dotted with groves of pine and white country houses. Flocks
of sheep grazed on the turfy hill-sides, and a few cows and horses
ruminated among the clumps of broom. Down in the bottom of the
valley, I noticed a small inclosure, planted with Italian cypresses, and
with a square white object in the centre. It did not need the postillion's
words to assure me that I looked upon the Grave of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Looking eastward toward the sea, the hills became bare and red,
gashed with chasms and falling off in tremendous precipices, the
height of which we could only guess from the dim blue of the great
sphere of sea, whose far-off horizon was drawn above their summits,
so that we seemed to stand in the centre of a vast concavity. In
color, form, and magnificent desolation, these hills called to my mind
the mountain region surrounding the Dead Sea. Clouds rested upon
the high, pine-wooded summits to the west of us, and the broad,
sloping valley, on the other side of the ridge of Longwood, was as
green as a dell of Switzerland. The view of those fresh pasture-slopes,
with their flocks of sheep, their groves and cottages, was all the
more delightful from its being wholly unexpected. Where the ridge
joins the hills, and one can look into both valleys at the same time,
there is a small tavern, with the familiar English sign of the "Crown
and Rose." Our road now led eastward along the top of the ridge,
over a waste tract covered with clumps of broom, for another mile
and a half, when we reached the gate of the Longwood Farm. A
broad avenue of trees, which all lean inland from the stress of the

<!-- page 88 -->

trade-wind, conducts to the group of buildings, on a bleak spot, over
looking the sea, and exposed to the full force of the wind. Our wheels
rolled over a thick, green turf, the freshness of which showed how
unfrequent must be the visits of strangers.</p>

<p>On reaching the gate a small and very dirty boy, with a milk-and-molasses
complexion, brought out to us a notice pasted on a
board, intimating that those who wished to see the residence of the
Emperor Napoleon must pay two shillings a-piece, in advance; children
half-price. A neat little Englishwoman, of that uncertain age
which made me hesitate to ask her whether she had ever seen the
Emperor, was in attendance, to receive the fees and act as cicerone.
We alighted at a small green verandah, facing a wooden wing which
projects from the eastern front of the building. The first room we
entered was whitewashed, and covered all over with the names of
visitors, in charcoal, pencil, and red chalk. The greater part of them
were French. "This," said the little woman, "was the Emperor's
billiard-room, built after he came to live at Longwood. The walls
have three or four times been covered with names, and whitewashed
over." A door at the further end admitted us into the drawing-room,
in which Napoleon died. The ceiling was broken away, and dust and
cobwebs covered the bare rafters. The floor was half-decayed, almost
invisible through the dirt which covered it, and the plastering, falling
off, disclosed in many places the rough stone walls. A winnowing-mill
and two or three other farming utensils stood in the corners.
The window looked into a barn-yard filled with mud and dung.
Stretched on a sofa, with his head beside this window, the great conqueror,
the "modern Sesostris," breathed his last, amid the delirium
of fancied battle and the howlings of a storm which shook the island.
The corner-stone of the jamb, nearest which his head lay, has been
quarried out of the wall, and taken to France.</p>

<p>Beyond this was the dining-room, now a dark, dirty barn-floor,
filled to the rafters with straw and refuse timbers. We passed out
into a cattle-yard, and entered the Emperor's bed-room. A horse
and three cows were comfortably stalled therein, and the floor of mud
and loose stones was covered with dung and litter. "Here," said the
guide, pointing to an unusually filthy stall in one corner, "was the

<!-- page 89 -->

Emperor's bath-room. Mr. Solomon (a Jew in Jamestown) has the
marble bathing-tub he used. Yonder was his dressing-room"&mdash;a big
brinded calf was munching some grass in the very spot "&mdash;and here"
(pointing to an old cow in the nearest corner) "his attendant slept."
So miserable, so mournfully wretched was the condition of the place,
that I regretted not having been content with an outside view of
Longwood. On the other side of the cattle-yard stand the houses
which were inhabited by Count Montholon, Las Casas, and Dr.
O'Meara; but at present they are shabby, tumble-down sheds, whose
stone walls alone have preserved their existence to this day. On the
side facing the sea, there are a few pine-trees, under which is a small
crescent-shaped fish-pond, dry and nearly filled with earth and weeds.
Here the Emperor used to sit and feed his tame fish. The sky, overcast
with clouds, and the cold wind which blew steadily from the sea,
added to the desolation of the place.</p>

<p>Passing through the garden, which is neglected, like the house,
and running to waste, we walked to the new building erected by the
Government for Napoleon's use, but which he never inhabited. It is
a large quadrangle, one story high, plain but commodious, and with
some elegance in its arrangement. It has been once or twice occupied
as a residence, but is now decaying from very neglect. Standing
under the brow of the hill, it is sheltered from the wind, and much
more cheerful in every respect than the old mansion. We were conducted
through the empty chambers, intended for billiard, dining,
drawing, and bed-rooms. In the bath-room, where yet stands the
wooden case which inclosed the marble tub, a flock of geese were luxuriating.
The curtains which hung at the windows were dropping to
pieces from rot, and in many of the rooms the plastering was cracked
and mildewed by the leakage of rains through the roof. Near the
building is a neat cottage, in which General Bertrand and his family
formerly resided. It is now occupied by the gentleman who leases
the farm of Longwood from the Government. The farm is the largest
on the island, containing one thousand acres, and is rented at &pound;315 a
year. The uplands around the house are devoted to the raising of
oats and barley, but grazing is the principal source of profit.</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>I plucked some branches of geranium and fragrant heliotrope from
the garden, and we set out on our return. I prevailed upon Mr.
P&mdash;&mdash; to take my place in the carriage, and give me his horse as far
as the "Crown and Rose," thereby securing an inspiring gallop of
nearly two miles. Two Englishmen, of the lower order, had charge
of the tavern, and while I was taking a glass of ale, one of them
touched his hat very respectfully, and said: "Axin' your pardon, Sir,
are you from the States?" I answered in the affirmative. "There!"
said he, turning to the other and clapping his hands, "I knew it;
I've won the bet." "What were your reasons for thinking me an
American?" I asked. "Why," said he, "the gentlemen from the
States are always <i>so mild!</i> I knowed you was one before you got
off the horse."</p>

<p>We sent the carriage on by the road, to await us on the other side
of the glen, and proceeded on foot to the Grave. The path led downward
through a garden filled with roses and heliotropes. The peach-trees
were in blossom, and the tropical <i>loqu&agrave;t</i>, which I had seen growing
in India and China, hung full of ripe yellow fruit. As we
approached the little inclosure at the bottom of the glen, I, who was
in advance, was hailed by a voice crying out, "This way, Sir, this
way!" and, looking down, saw at the gate a diminutive, wrinkled,
old, grizzly-headed, semi-negro, semi-Portuguese woman, whom I at
once recognized as the <i>custodienne</i> of the tomb, from descriptions
which the officers of the Mississippi had given me. "Ah! there you
are!" said I; "I knew it must be you." "Why, Captain!" she
exclaimed; "is that you? How you been this long while? I did n't
know you was a-comin', or I would ha' put on a better dress, for, you
see, I was a-washin' to-day. Dickey!"&mdash;addressing a great, fat,
white youth of twenty-two or twenty-three, with a particularly stupid
and vacant face&mdash;"run up to the garden and git two or three of the
finest <i>bokys</i> as ever you can, for the Captain and the ladies!"</p>

<p>At the gate of the inclosure hung a placard, calling upon all visitors
to pay, in advance, the sum of one shilling and sixpence each,
before approaching the tomb. This touching testimony of respect
having been complied with, we were allowed to draw near to the

<!-- page 91 -->

empty vault, which, for twenty years, enshrined the corpse of Napoleon.
It is merely an oblong shaft of masonry, about twelve feet
deep, and with a rude roof thrown over the mouth, to prevent it being
filled by the rains. A little railing surrounds it, and the space
between is planted with geraniums and scarlet salvias. Two willows&mdash;one
of which has been so stripped by travellers that nothing
but the trunk is left&mdash;shade the spot, and half-a-dozen monumental
cypresses lift their tall obelisks around. A flight of steps leads to
the bottom of the vault, where the bed of masonry which inclosed the
coffin still remains. I descended to the lowest step, and there found,
hanging against the damp wall, a written tablet stating that the old
woman, then waiting for me at the top, told an admirable and excellent
story about the burial of Napoleon, which travellers would do
well to extract from her, and that one shilling was but a fair compensation
for the pleasure she would afford them. Appended to the
announcement were the following lines, which I transcribed on the

<p>If I had been saddened by the neglect of Longwood, I was disgusted
by the profanation of the tomb. Is there not enough reverence
in St. Helena, to prevent the grave which a great name has hallowed,
from being defiled with such abominable doggerel? And there was
the old woman, who, having seen me read the notice, immediately
commenced her admirable and interesting story in this wise: "Six
years he lived upon the island. He came here in 1815, and he died
in 1821. Six years he lived upon the island. He was buried with
his head to the east. This is the east. His feet was to the west.
This is the west. Where you see that brown dirt, there was his
head. He wanted to be buried beside his wife, Josephine; but, as
that could n't be done, he was put here. They put him here because
he used to come down here with a silver mug in his pocket, and take
a drink out of that spring. That's the reason he was buried here.
There was a guard of a sargeant and six men up there on the hill, all
the time he was down here a-drinkin out of the spring with his silver
mug. This was the way he walked." Here the old woman folded
her arms, tossed back her grizzly head, and strode to and fro with so
ludicrous an attempt at dignity, that, in spite of myself, I was forced
into laughter. "Did you ever see him?" I asked. "Yes, Captain,"
said she; "I seed him a many a time, and I always said, 'Good mornin',
Sir,' but he never had no conversation with me." A draught of
the cool and delicious lymph of Napoleon's Spring completed the
farce. I broke a sprig from one of the cypresses, wrote my name in
the visitor's book, took the "boky" of gillyflowers and marigolds,
which Dickey had collected, and slowly remounted the opposite side
of the glen. My thoughts involuntarily turned from the desecrated
grave to that fitting sepulchre where he now rests, under the banners
of a hundred victorious battle-fields, and guarded by the time-worn

<!-- page 93 -->

remnant of his faithful Old Guard. Let Longwood be levelled to the
earth, and the empty grave be filled up and turfed over! Better that
these memorials of England's treachery should be seen no more!</p>

<p>We hastened back to Jamestown, as it was near sunset. The
long shadows already filled the ravine, and the miniature gardens and
streets below were more animated than during the still heat of the
afternoon. Capt. Howland was waiting for us, as the ship was ready
to sail. Before it was quite dark, we had weighed anchor, and were
slowly drifting away from the desolate crags of the island. The next
morning, we saw again the old unbroken ring of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> excursion of June, 1854, up the Northern Mississippi, in honor
of the completion of the Rock-Island and Chicago Railroad, and by
invitation of the contractors of that road, was on a scale quite unparalleled
in the history of similar celebrations. Some seven hundred
guests, chiefly from the Atlantic States, were freely transported an
immense distance to view the last railroad link between the Atlantic
and the Mississippi, and to enjoy an excursion by steamboat from the
point of termination on the river up to the new and wondrous city of
St. Paul, in Minnesota, and thence to Fort Snelling, and by land to
the Falls of St. Anthony.</p>

<p>The river trip was accomplished between Monday evening and the
next Saturday morning; the boats stopping at Galena and Dubuque
on the upward passage. Above Dubuque the scenery begins to open
upon the voyager in forms of singular beauty. The bluffs grow higher
and more precipitous; and the remarkable sand-stone protrusions, so
characteristic of the banks of the Upper Mississippi, begin to appear.</p>

<p>At one point it requires no exaggeration of fancy to trace the out
lines of a ruined castle; while, at another, you see a solitary tower,
and then the serrated embrasures of a deserted battlement. The boat
glides on, and now from the steep slope of a bluff, clothed in richest
verdure, as if it had been kept under careful cultivation, you see the
sand-stone bare in a single central spot, and taking the form of an
ancient cenotaph, as if there reposed the ashes of some ante-diluvian
monarch. A mile or two farther on, and the broken entablature of a
Grecian temple, with architrave, frieze, and cornice, and resting on

<!-- page 98 -->

two or three dismembered columns, seems set in a wall of verdure,
as if it were a piece of subterranean architecture, exposed by the
washing away of the earth, which had then been sloped and terraced
about it by the hand of art, and planted with the finest grasses, while
the trees were so distributed as to impart the most picturesque effect.
Indeed, the orchard-like appearance of these slopes, sweeping in curves
of enchanting beauty to the water's edge, is the most surprising feature
in the landscape. For scores of miles you may see no sign of
population, and yet many of these hills appear like the outskirts of a
nobleman's park, carefully kept free from under-brush and matted
vegetation, and rounded by some landscape gardener to gratify the
eye of taste. Here and there a sort of dimple is scooped in the hill;
or you see two noble hills nearly meet at their bases, leaving a hollow
between, like a lap, to receive the treasures of fertility which the
land is ready to pour down. The charm of vegetation, which a luxuriant
soil imparts, is spread like a mantle over these bluffs. You
look in vain for a bleak or barren point. When the bluffs sink on
one side of the river, they re&auml;ppear on the other; and this peculiarity
continues, with a few exceptions, (as at Lake Pepin,) till you reach
the pine region above the mouth of the St. Croix.</p>

<p>A hundred miles from the Falls of St. Anthony, you pass through
Lake Pepin, which is merely an expansion of the Mississippi, about
twenty-four miles long, and from two to four miles wide. It is
rightly named a lake, however; as the characteristics of the river are
here greatly modified. There is no perceptible current. The low
islands, covered with rank vegetation, and annually overflowed and
abraded by the brimming river, here entirely disappear. There is
not an island in Lake Pepin. There are bluffs on both sides, which
slope down cleanly to the water's edge, leaving a narrow rim of sand,
but no marshy bottom-land between.</p>

<p>At one point, on the Wisconsin shore, the bluffs recede, and a
beautiful platform of land extends before them, dotted with trees.
On the Minnesota shore the line of bluffs is at one place thrown back
to make way for a prairie, on the back-ground of which Nature has
lavished all that can be imagined of the picturesque in the scenery of
hill and dale. Here and there along the summit-line of majestic

<!-- page 99 -->

bluffs you see a single row of trees at a distance of several feet from
one another, like warriors in Indian file.</p>

<p>The amenity of the landscape lends to it an indescribable charm.
On Lake George you see bold and beautiful hills, wooded to the
water's edge, and interspersed with rocks and rugged declivities that
contrast with the pervading verdure. But on Lake Pepin you see
grandeur putting on all forms of beauty, and wearing, under all
aspects, a smile. Even its ravines are so hollowed and smoothed
that every rugged feature has been softened down. Its charming hill
sides are such as the imagination of Watteau used to select for the
pastoral pic-nics and concerts he delighted to paint. The charm of
variety is not wanting to these slopes. The curves and undulations
of verdure assume every fanciful and delightful form; now sweeping
so as to create a regular amphitheatre between two high bluffs; now
sinking into basins; now sparsely dotted with trees; now entirely
bare of trees, and richly carpeted with grass; now crowned with
noble forests; and now rising into a perpendicular and precipitous
wall of sand-stone.</p>

<p>On our northward trip, we passed through Lake Pepin in the
night-time; so that we could not see much of its scenery. Three of
our boats were lashed together, and thus proceeded along the whole
length of the lake, exhibiting to any stray occupant of the shore a
startling and fiery spectacle. On our return we were more fortunate.
We entered upon Lake Pepin at the dawn of a beautiful day.
Toward the southern extremity of the lake we saw the high bluff, with
its sand-stone pinnacle, known as the Maiden's Rock. It was my
fortune to be standing on the hurricane-deck, with my foot upon a
life-preserving stool, and my elbow leaned upon my knee, when some
of my lady acquaintances of the excursion broke in upon my contemplations.</p>

<p>"We have come to you," said one, "for the authentic version of
the legend which gives to that rock its name. Please to sit down,
and tell it like a faithful chronicler."</p>

<p>"Authorities differ," said another, "as to whether the maiden,
who threw herself from the rock, had a lover; now I insist upon it
that she had."</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"Please to be seated, ladies, and you shall hear the whole story;
although it is many years since I received it from a Sister of Charity
at Montreal."</p>

<p>"But I insist upon it that a lover must be introduced," said lady
number two.</p>

<p>"We can not promise," said I; "for the story will come to my
recollection only by degrees, as I go along. What shall we call it?"</p>

<p>"Call it," said the first lady, hesitatingly, "call it</p>

<div class="center">

<h3>We-no-na's Rock.</h3>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">We-No-Na's Rock</span> it shall be."</p>

<p>Know, then, that many years ago, shortly before the indefatigable
Jesuit missionaries had penetrated this country, or given to this beautiful
lake the name of that old king of the Franks, which it bears, the
Dahcotahs or Sioux Indians occupied the region now partly included
within the limits of Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Dahcotahs were confederated bands, sub-divided into clans,
and they differed from the Indians east of the Mississippi in relying
more exclusively for their support upon hunting the bison. They
were a fierce, aggressive people, and so improvident, that periods of
famine among them were quite common. On such occasions they
would suddenly break up their settlements and move to distant
hunting-grounds, leaving their infirm old men, who were unable to
travel, behind to perish.</p>

<p>On a cold day in January, on the edge of the clump of trees which
you see a short distance back from the Maiden's Rock, an old Indian
might have been seen cowering about a fire. Ish-te-nah had been left
to die. His people, driven by hunger, had gone west in search of the
bison. A small pile of wood, some morsels of food, a hatchet, a birchen
vessel, filled with water, and a bow and arrows, were by his side; and
a few stakes, covered with deer-skins, disposed in a cone-like shape,
formed the wigwam for his shelter and repose. The ground was
covered with snow, and the wind blew keenly from the north-west.</p>

<p>"Go, my children," the old man had said, when some seemed to
hesitate in their act of desertion; "go where you can get food. Leave
me to the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit's</span> care. At the best I have but a brief while

<!-- page 101 -->

to live. I should be a burthen and a delay to you if you attempted
to take me with you. Your women and young people must be provided
for. Go!"</p>

<p>And Ish-te-nah was left alone. Although he had made a virtue
of necessity, and exhibited the characteristic stoicism of his race, in
insisting upon thus being deserted, he could not repress the bitter
thoughts that visited him as the last lingerers disappeared from his
feeble gaze. He recalled the times when he had rallied his people to
a victorious onset, or saved them from a well-laid ambush, or brought
them off safely from the assault of superior numbers. He recalled
his achievements in the chase, and the occasions when, by foresight
and energy, he had averted calamities like the present. And after
all his benefits to his tribe, here was his reward.</p>

<p>As he was indulging in these repining retrospections, he was
startled by the sound of crackling snow, and the next moment an
Indian girl stood panting before him.</p>

<p>"We-no-na! What brings you here?" said the old man. "Do
not linger, or you will miss your people's track. Already the drifting
snow may have covered it."</p>

<p>"I do not care. I stay here," said We-no-na, throwing some dry
boughs on the fire.</p>

<p>"Would the young fawn perish like the old, disabled buck?
What moves We-no-na to this desperate resolve?"</p>

<p>"Father, they would wed me to the chief Ha-o-kah; and I detest
him."</p>

<p>"In other words, you love some younger man of the tribe."</p>

<p>"I love no man, young or old; unless it be you, father, from
whom I have always had kindness."</p>

<p>"Go, foolish fawn! Ha-o-kah is as good as most husbands."</p>

<p>"I would sooner die than have a husband, if all are like those of
the Dahcotahs," exclaimed We-no-na energetically. "How much
better is a wife treated than a dog? Look at my mother! See her
staggering under heavy burthens, while her husband carries no more
than will keep him warm. The wife must cut the tree, peel the bark,
build the hut, sew the skins, paddle the canoe, and cook the food.
She must do every menial thing, while the husband looks on in idleness.

<!-- page 102 -->

All this I could bear, if she had good treatment after it. But
then, when her drudgery is over, she must be beaten, or have a stick
of wood thrown at her head. Yesterday my mother was beaten for
not beating me hard enough, because I said I would die sooner than
marry, and so I would!"</p>

<p>"The Indian's is a bad life," said the old man. "What you say
is true. Indian women are slaves; and Indian old men are abandoned,
as I am, to die."</p>

<p>"Father, you shall not die if I can help it. I will build your fire,
peel bark to improve your shelter, and break holes in the ice to catch
fish."</p>

<p>For a moment the old man's Indian apathy was melted, and a
strange, unwonted feeling, which, a little more indulged, would have
brought tears to his eyes, stole through his breast.</p>

<p>"We-no-na deserves a better husband than any Dahcotah would
make," said the old man. "It is hard to speak against one's own
nation; but what I have seen, I have seen. We-no-na does not
desire to be a slave, and so she will go unwedded."</p>

<p>"Father, I would willingly toil like a slave, if there were loving
words and looks to repay me; but the angry threat, the blow, the
contempt of a man is more than I can submit to. I think the <span class="smcap">Great
Spirit</span> has made me different from other Dahcotah women."</p>

<p>Saying this, We-no-na seized the hatchet, and treading lightly and
fleetly over the snow toward that grove of oak which you see in
the direction of the north-west, cut a bundle of dry boughs, and
brought them to the fire. The old man and maiden then partook of
a frugal meal of dried venison; and when the night came on, one
of them watched the fire while the other slept.</p>

<p>The next morning We-no-na crossed the lake on the ice to that
bluff with the bowl-like hollow on its front, to reconnoitre. What
was her joy on discovering traces of deer! She had brought the
old man's bow and arrows with her, and she resolved to lie in wait for
the game on which not only her own life, but another's, seemed now to
depend. Her vigilance was soon repaid. A noble deer came bounding
by toward an oak opening which lies just back of the bluff. With
beating heart We-no-na fixed the arrow in the string, and without

<!-- page 103 -->

pausing, shot it at the animal. Leaping high in the air, he fell, and
crimsoned the snow with his life-blood. "Surely," thought We-no-na,
"the good spirit who dwells in woods has befriended me;" for
this was the first deer she had ever killed. With great labor she
dragged the carcase to the edge of the bluff, and rolled it down over
the icy crust to the frozen lake. It would have been hard work for a
strong man to pull it over the ice, and up to the little encampment
back of We-no-na's rock. But this she did, greatly fearing the
while lest the wolves should interrupt her in the task.</p>

<p>Old Ish-te-nah's eyes sparkled when he saw what the maiden had
accomplished.</p>

<p>"Here is enough," he said, "to keep you from starving till the
spring."</p>

<p>"To keep us both, father," rejoined We-no-na.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"What would my father say?" asked We-no-na, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"Should I leave you, my child, trust in the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span>, and be
brave. Wait here through the winter as long as you can get food
and warmth; but do not tarry after you have plucked the first ripe
strawberry in the summer. Remember."</p>

<p>We-no-na promised obedience.</p>

<p>"And go east, beyond the great lakes, to the country of the
Algonquins, where you will find the pale-faces of whom you have
heard, and who will teach you much that will do your people good,
should you ever return to them."</p>

<p>We-no-na bowed her head in acknowledgment that she had stored
up in her memory all that the old man had enjoined. She then
cooked some venison, but he partook sparingly, and bade her sleep,
while he watched. The command was not unwelcome; for she had
been much fatigued by her day's work. She slept profoundly for
some hours, then started up suddenly, waked by the cold, and found
that the fire was decaying fast. She heaped upon it some more
wood, then turning to Ish-te-nah, said: "Father, you shall now take
your turn to sleep." No answer came from him. We-no-na seized
him by the arm: it was cold and stiff. The soul of the old warrior
had departed.</p>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>The maiden sat in mute, overpowering affliction for many hours.
The anguish of utter bereavement and desolation seemed to deprive
her even of the relief of tears. At length she recalled her promises
to the old man. She found a place under a high snow-drift, where
the ground was yet unfrozen; and here she dug a grave, and deposited
his mortal body. And it was not till all this was done, and the snow
had been replaced over the spot of interment, and the fire had been
heaped anew with wood, that tears and lamentations found vent with
We-no-na.</p>

<p>But the grief of the young and healthy is like a flesh-wound that
befalls them: it soon heals. Left entirely to her own resources,
We-no-na found hourly occupation for her hands and thoughts, and at
night slept so profoundly that, on waking, she often could not remember
that she had even dreamed. She enlarged the little wigwam so
as to make quite a neat apartment, well roofed, and with a floor of
bark, on which was spread the skin of a bison. By laying large strips
of bark sloping against the trees to which her wigwam was bound, she
made a safe place for the deposit of the venison and other provisions.
She constructed a canoe in anticipation of the river's melting in the
spring; and out of the deer-skin she made moccasins and belts. And
then a good part of the day was occupied in cutting and bringing in
wood; so that We-no-na had little time for idle or desponding fancies.
Occasionally, when the wind howled, and the snow whirled in
wild eddies over the bluff, she would sit and feed the fire for hours,
and then strange thoughts would visit her; and the consciousness of
her lonely situation would press upon her heavily. But she was
naturally cheerful and hopeful; and her day-dreams were oftener
bright than gloomy. She was saddest when she thought of a little
sister, who had died the winter before. But one night she dreamed
that little We-har-ka came to her lonely wigwam, and promised to
lead her in good time to a land more beautiful than any she had yet
seen, where there were birds and fruits all the year round, and where
no violence was done, and no harsh words were spoken. After this,
We-no-na was more content, and she loved to recall all the particulars
of her dream. There were little brothers whom she had been
obliged to leave in deserting her people. And did not We-no-na

<!-- page 105 -->

grieve for them? Alas! like all Indian boys, they had been bred up
to treat their sisters with contempt and ignominy; and the effects of
a vile education had been such as to blunt their natural affections, and
to make them regard the fraternal sentiment as a weakness which no
boy who hoped to become a great warrior ought to entertain.</p>

<p>The winter months had never seemed to We-no-na less tedious.
March, with its cold blasts, and April, with its torrents of rain, had
passed; and the south wind unlocked the fettered Mississippi, and the
blue waters of Lake Pepin again sparkled in the sunshine, and the
verdure began to creep over bluff and prairie, and the delicate foliage
to fringe the trees, and bright flowers to open amid the springing grass
and by the border of the groves. We-no-na's winter experiences had
given her a feeling of independence and self-reliance, which was in
itself a great source of happiness. Never before had she known the
true luxury of freedom. If heretofore she had roamed the prairie, or
paddled the canoe, it was but to anticipate her degradation the moment
she should enter the filthy hovels where her people were herded.
She had a womanly sense of neatness, which now she could indulge
unchecked. She delighted in nature, and her delight was now
unmarred by embittering associations. She grew in stature and in
beauty, and in strength and fleetness; and as she snuffed the pure
morning breeze, and saw the sun crimsoning the eastern clouds, or as
she looked up to the starry heavens, or to the coruscations of the
Aurora by night, she would exclaim: "Yes, the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span> is
generous and good; it is man only who is bad, and who spoils the
gifts that are lavished on his race!"</p>

<p>It was one of the last days of May, when, as We-no-na was
descending to that beautiful prairie, where the little house now stands,
she saw a red strawberry amid the grass, and plucked it. She then
remembered Ish-te-nah's injunction, and walked musingly back to her
wigwam. It was almost with a pang of regret that she prepared to
leave this beautiful region. All the means of subsistence seemed so
abundant around her; earth, air, and water seemed so kind in rendering
up their stores; and then, as summer came on, the whole landscape
was clothed in such affluent beauty; the verdant bluffs swept in
such graceful curves to the water's edge; and the distant prairie

<!-- page 106 -->

began to heave its sparkling waves of green so luxuriantly! But
might there not be fair spots eastward of the lake 1 She would go, as
Ish-te-nah had recommended; but first she would collect, as a memorial,
some of the beautiful stones scattered along the shore.</p>

<p>These stones, as you are aware, are agates and cornelians; and
Lake Pepin has yielded them in abundance for many years.</p>

<p>We-no-na descended and ran along the shore as far as the point
we are now skirting. She would stop here and there to pick up a
handful of agates, and then, as she saw others more beautiful, she
would throw aside those she had gathered, and replace them with new
treasures. She was thus lured on to wander several miles; and the
evening twilight was far advanced before she regained her wigwam.
It was now too late to start upon her pilgrimage. No matter; she
would commence it early the next morning.</p>

<p>When morning came, there were many preparations to make;
and the sun had been up a couple of hours before she had set forth on
her journey. She carried her canoe fastened by a strap to her back,
her hatchet and arrows in her belt, and provision for several days in
a pouch of deer-skin that hung at her side. What was her dismay,
after descending the hill and passing through yonder little belt of
woodland, on coming suddenly upon an Indian encampment! She
paused, hoping to retreat unseen; but this was now impossible.
Several Indians started up and approached her, and a second glance
was not needed to assure her that among them she saw her father
and mother and her hated suitor, Ha-o-kah. This worthy chief had
made the lives of the old people somewhat uncomfortable from his
repeatedly twitting them with the fact that he had bought their
daughter of them twice over, and been cheated out of the purchase.
As Ha-o-kah had no small degree of influence in the tribe, the old
couple felt very uneasy at their daughter's dereliction, it having
placed them in the position of debtors to one who evidently, by
his frequent taunts and dunning, was not disposed to let them sleep
over the debt they had incurred.</p>

<p>There was, consequently, an exclamation of general surprise and
satisfaction at the appearance of We-no-na. Her first act was to
disencumber herself of her canoe, and every thing that could impede

her flight. She then placed an arrow in the string of her bow, and,
retreating a few steps, called upon the approaching party to stop.
There was something so imperious in her tone that they instantly
obeyed. She then briefly told them that she had withdrawn from
her tribe; that she looked to none of them for support; and that
she wished to be alone. To this her father replied in violent language,
ordering her to come to him. She refused by a significant
gesture. He ran forward to meet her, but she soon doubled the
distance between them. With true Indian craft, he then changed
his policy, and asked We-no-na whiningly if she would not come
to her dear, affectionate parents? At the same time, We-no-na
could see him threaten her mother with his hatchet, bidding her
to join in his entreaties and lamentations. This the old woman
readily did. But We-no-na was inexorable. Then the amiable
Ha-o-kah approached; but as We-no-na aimed, or pretended to aim,
an arrow at him, he dodged behind a bush, and begged her to hear
him. This, she assured him, she would do if he would stay where he
was. Ha-o-kah then informed her that he had bought her in fair
trade of her parents, and that in common honesty she ought to come
and be his wife; he told her that he had but three wives, all of whom
were happy women; he had been very successful in hunting, and had
collected a good number of skins, beside a quantity of bear's-grease;
he had also taken the scalp of a Pawnee, and stolen a horse; in short,
there was not a young woman in the tribe who would not be proud
of the position he now offered to the disdainful We-no-na.</p>

<p>We-no-na, leaning scornfully on her bow, replied: "Thief of a
Dahcotah, your wife I will never be! You say you have but three:
there was a fourth, who died of a blow from her husband. What a
brave he must be! There is another, who is blind of an eye. How
did she lose it, O great warrior, with your one scalp, and that, I will
venture to say, a woman's? Never will I be your wife! never will I
be one of your people again! Go vent your anger upon the poor
slaves who are left to you, and be content!"</p>

<p>By this time the rage of Ha-o-kah was at its height; and, regardless
of danger, he rushed forth with a howl to seize her who had
dared to give utterance to such unwelcome truths. But We-no-na,

<!-- page 108 -->

vigilant as a wild-cat and swifter than the deer, gained an elevation
from which she again aimed an arrow at her pursuer. He threw
himself on the ground, and the arrow lodged in the trunk of a tree
some distance behind. With a yell, he rose to his feet, and strained
every sinew to overtake We-no-na; but, with the ease and grace of an
antelope, she outran him. All the young men of the encampment
were by this time in full chase; for they knew that they need expect
no grace from Ha-o-kah unless they were officious in assisting him.
We-no-na ran to the top of the bluff, where her wigwam stood, and
threw herself panting upon a bed of dry, fragrant grass, that she had
prepared some days before. She had rested there hardly a minute,
when the sound of voices and footsteps roused her, and, springing to
her feet, she saw Ha-o-kah, with three or four followers, ascending the
hill-slope from the south, and but a few rods distant. In a frenzy of
indignation, she again set an arrow in the string, and exclaiming,
" This. Ha-o-kah, for the benefit of your three wives!" shot it at him
before he had time to turn aside. It lodged in his right arm above
the elbow, disabling it materially for the active purposes of chastising
his wives or scalping his foes.</p>

<p>The pursuers paused, quite confounded at this audacious shot;
but Ha-o-kah, with a scream of mingled rage and pain, bade them
proceed, and they dashed on toward the summit of the bluff. As
they mounted it, they beheld We-no-na at the very edge of the
fearful precipice, looking back upon them with a determined
glance. "Brave woman-chasers!" she exclaimed, "let me see you
follow!"</p>

<p>And, with the words, she sprang from the cliff, some sixty feet far
out among the trees that slope from the base of the wall of rock
toward the water; and before her pursuers could reach the edge
of the precipice, she had swung herself from bough to bough into
the river.</p>

<p>There was an exclamation of horror and surprise from Ha-o-kah
and his young men as they witnessed this intrepid leap. No one
cared to risk his neck by imitating it. They separated, and ran
round each side of the bluff toward the base; but to their amazement
could see no trace of We-no-na, Was it possible that she had leaped

<!-- page 109 -->

so far as to fall into the water? Incredible as this seemed, it was the
conclusion to which they came.</p>

<p>Poor Ha-o-kah was a good deal crest-fallen, as, with his wounded
arm in a sling, he rejoined the encampment. His three wives at first
exhibited much concern on seeing him wounded, and approached him
with the servility he habitually exacted; but, on discovering that his
arm was so shattered as to be unfit for any future service, they
taunted him with his misfortune, and manifested a wonderful indifference
to his sufferings. He looked about for a hatchet to throw at
one of them, but a slight motion of his arm reminded him of his
impotence, and he changed his rough tone to a pleading treble. As
his influence with his tribe was derived chiefly from his physical
strength and skill, and not from his wisdom in council, he at once fell
into insignificance, and soon found himself restricted to a single wife,
whom he never spoke to but in terms of profound respect.</p>

<p>The pursuers all reported that We-no-na was drowned: it would
have been a poor compliment to their speed and sagacity to suppose
otherwise. Almost every version of the tradition of "We-no-na's
Rock" adopts their story. But it does not follow that, because they
could not find her, she was drowned. On the contrary, there is in
the very fact a presumption that she escaped. The truth is, that
We-no-na, who was a most adroit swimmer, did escape. Swimming
across the river, she concealed herself awhile, and then took up her
journey toward the east. She crossed the territory which now constitutes
the width of the State of Wisconsin, and arrived at Green
Bay early in August. Here, at the point where Fort La Baye was
subsequently erected, she found a French exploring party, under the
conduct of several Jesuit missionaries. She attached herself to it,
and soon made herself useful.</p>

<p>A young Parisian of education and refinement, and a devout
Catholic withal, named La Crosse, was seriously ill of a fever; and
We-no-na was appointed to watch and nurse him. This she did
with so much patience and fidelity, that La Crosse was seriously
impressed; and no sooner was he restored to health than he informed
Father Duhesme of his desire of espousing We-no-na. The worthy
father said that this could not be done until the maiden was made a

<!-- page 110 -->

good Catholic; and they both forthwith applied themselves to her
conversion. This was a longer process than they anticipated. It
was some time before We-no-na acquired sufficient French to understand
their purpose; and then she had so many posing questions to
ask, that the learned missionary frequently thought she must be
especially instigated by Satan in the unlooked-for difficulties she
raised.</p>

<p>At length the maiden's intelligence seemed to pierce to the pith
of the matter, relieved of all its bewildering husks, forms, and
wrappings. The beauty and holiness of Christian morality dawned
upon her benighted soul, and reconciled her fully and cordially to
the Christian religion. It was to her, in truth, a revelation, and
was received in earnestness and faith. She was baptized and married.</p>

<p>The party returned soon after to Montreal. La Crosse became
the chief man of one of the beautiful villages on the St. Lawrence.
We-no-na adapted herself eagerly to the habits and tastes of civilized
life. Sometimes, as the happy pair sat on their broad piazza amid
roses and honeysuckle, with their little half-breeds playing before them,
La Crosse, to make his wife's eyes flash with their old barbarian fire,
would express a pretended preference for the freedom of savage-life,
and, sighing, wish that they were among the Dahcotahs; a wish which
never failed to call forth an indignant rebuke from We-no-na. On
one occasion her husband, to please some wandering Iroquois, daubed
his face with ochre, grease, and charcoal, threw a blanket over his
shoulders, decorated his head with feathers, took a scalping-knife
in one hand and a tomahawk in the other, and, with genuine French
versatility, joined in a war-dance. But when he found that his disguise
disturbed We-no-na, so that she wept passionately, he threw it
aside, never to resume it.</p>

<p>A proud woman was she, when, with her two boys and a little girl,
La Crosse first drove her up, in a painted sledge, to the little Catholic
church where Sunday service was held. No wonder that the emotion
of gratitude surpassed all others as she knelt in prayer. A still
prouder woman was she, when her children could read and write,
and one of her boys attained such proficiency on the bass-viol that

<!-- page 111 -->

he was employed by the priest to lead the choir in church. They
grew up a bright intelligent race, and We-no-na lived to see them all
happily settled upon adjoining farms.</p>

<p>And this is the end of "We-no-na's Rock."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not long since that Hamilton County, with the whole region
lying between the fertile slopes of the Mohawk and Lake Champlain,
was known but as a vast, mountainous, cold tract, presenting the
extreme contrast of a primeval forest, traversed only by the hunter
of the deer, the bear, and the moose. Here and there an agricultural
settler along its borders snatched a scanty harvest from the brief summer,
and on the eastern side the lumberman pursued his wintry toil;
but, once past the log-cabin of the one or the shanty of the other, it
was literally a howling wilderness, where the yell of the wolf, the
scream of the panther, and the laughter of the owl mingled with the
roar of floods and the moanings of the winds through the tall hemlocks.
Now the marvellous beauty of its scenery, more wildly grand than any
other in North-America, diversified by many lakes of crystal purity
and their foaming outlets, have been so often eloquently described by
adventurous <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> in search of the picturesque, trout, and copy-money,
that a tour through Racquette and the Saranac is getting to
be well-nigh as readily undertaken as a trip to the Upper Nile. Even
ladies have ventured a day or two within the shadows, and before
long the solitary Indian, who lingers in the hunting-grounds of his
fathers, or the moccasined woodsman, paddling his "birch," will be
startled by flotillas gay with fashionable drapery, and listen, in wondering
delight, to the songs of Verdi and Auber among the echoes of
Blue Mountain. Lines of rival railways have already been traced
through the gorges and along the streams; speculation has been busy
with the timber-lots, and soon the glory of the forest, unbroken

<!-- page 118 -->

since time began until now, will be floating down the St. Lawrence
and the Hudson, or whirled at the tail of the locomotive to the sea
side. The most zealous utilitarian might sadden over the coming
change, were it not that a century must go by before the industry of
man, though that man be a Yankee, can strip the rocky heights of
their ever-green luxuriance.</p>

<p>Following from the Mohawk side, and after crossing the hill which
bounds that valley, the bank of the noble Sacondaga (<i>beau-ideal</i> of a
trout river to an angler who is content to wade deeply for a free cast
under the elms on pool or rapid) to the neat little inn of Francisco,
and then crossing a spur of the mountain-range by a road rough as
the bed of a torrent, the traveller will find himself gazing on the
placid waters and rich shores of Lake Pleasant, named by no flattering
tongue, for a more lovely scene has seldom greeted the eye of
poet or artist; and, yet farther on, connected with it by a short strait,
Round Lake sparkles like a bowl of silver wreathed with verdant garland.
Here several dwellings, with one or two flourishing farms, are
clustered about the county buildings, and a well-kept hotel opens its
doors in welcome to a table spread with luxuries unknown among the
dwellers on the plain. At the time when the incidents happened of
which I am about to write, the explorer, if not accustomed to wood-craft,
or bent upon adventure, tempted the difficulties of the way no
farther; nor was he indisposed to linger, where, with comfort at night
and plenty by day, he could win rich trophies for both rod and gun,
or enjoy the beauty around him varying with dawn and evening, sunlight
and cloud. But perseverance for two or three hours would
bring him to another lake, the Piseco, far more lovely, at least in the
judgment of one rendered perhaps partial by memories of happy
days of many an early summer spent in contemplating its virgin
charms, traversing its pure bosom and enjoying the society of a half-dozen
kindred spirits, far from the dust of cities, the turmoil of trade,
and the frivolities of artificial life.</p>

<p>In this country, especially, the extreme heats that alternate with
our cold winters, and, still more, the suicidal intensity with which the
American follows his calling, render some relief necessary to mind,
body, and heart; nor can any of us who live in towns pass from the

<!-- page 119 -->

exhaustions of one season to those of the next without some interval
of change, and not suffer loss of physical vigor, intellectual force, and
moral health. <span class="smcap">He</span> who, in <span class="smcap">His</span> wise goodness, has made us so "fearfully
and wonderfully," never intended our material or spiritual structure
for such constant excess. The birth-place of man was amidst
trees, and herbage, and flowing waters. There are the works of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and there, as to our early home, should we at times turn to freshen
our being, and listen to the voice of <span class="smcap">Him</span> who talked in Paradise with
<span class="smcap">His</span> children. It is not relaxation that we need. Our straining of
nerve and thought, to say nothing of worse habits incident to our perverted
modes of life, has already too much relaxed our faculties by
recoil from the tension. What our nature demands is invigoration, a
bracing of the frame, a quickening of the mind, an uplifting of the
heart, an inhalation of fresh life from its original sources, that
will enable us to grapple more strenuously with care, and duty,
and temptation. This can not be gained in the crowded saloons of
watering-places, or at the lordly country-seat, to which have been
transferred the appliances of courtly gratification, or by rushing over
the rapid rail, or on packed steamers, to haunts of hackneyed resorts,
merely to say that we have made the fashionable tour. These give
us no opportunity to think, no motive to repent and resolve anew.
We are still fettered by conventionalities. The wearisome monotony
of whirling excitements still sickens our aching brain. We must
break away from the crowd. We must reach a spot where distance
will give soberness to our view of our usual occupations, scenes where
we can gather ideas, sentiments, and emotions, not from worldly dictation
or even the page covered with other men's thoughts; where
we can hold intercourse with our fellow-men who spend their days
more simply; but, above all, where we can be alone with <span class="smcap">God</span> among
the works of <span class="smcap">His</span> hands, and hear, answering to our own, the pulses
of the <span class="smcap">Infinite Heart</span> which fills the universe with truth and love.</p>

<p>The student, long shut up within his library, and the servant of
his race in religious or philanthropic offices, need such a change quite
as much as men of business or pleasure. Books, precious as they are
for enlargement of knowledge and instruction from the past, may be
abused beyond their proper function. Classical, scholastic, and (in its

<!-- page 120 -->

general sense) sectarian forms, constrict and distort both the judgment
and the feeling. What we proudly term analysis and system
are too often but an arbitrary classification, under whose heads we,
Procrustes-like, compress or stretch out truths which were never
meant to take such exact or fixed shapes, but should be allowed confluence
and commixture, losing, like the hues of nature, all rigidness
of outline in harmony and kindred. What a world of labor have
metaphysicians wasted, by forgetting that they are not mathematicians,
and endeavoring to hew the "lively stones" into such shape as
may be fixed in a building of their architecture! How near the materialist
has the self-styled idealist come by such affectations! Too
much learning, (the scoffer was right,) or, rather, learning too much
by itself, will make a wise man mad. We may hide our souls from
our own view by our parchments, and look out upon the world of
humanity through obstinate hypotheses as false as gnarled window-panes.
Critics have done laughing at Wordsworth's early puerilities,
but every close student feels the force of the Laker's exhortation:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">Up</span>! up! my friend, and clear your looks!
    Why all this toil and trouble?
Up! up! my friend, and quit your books,
    Or surely you'll grow double!"</p>

</div>

<p>Double indeed! deformed in mind as well as body.</p>

<p>Nor will it answer to attempt such recuperation by force of will
alone. Accustomed to earnest occupation, we can not change the
habit which has become a law to us. Though we leave office,
counting-room, or library behind us, our calling will pursue us, and
force our thoughts into their ordinary ruts. The man of business
will be calculating his risks; the studious man working out his
theories.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Post</span> equitem sedet atra cura."</p>

<p>We can not shake the tormentor from the crupper, but must dismount
from our hobby. We can rid ourselves of one pursuit only
by adopting another another&mdash;lighter, less imperious; amusing, but
not engrossing; releasing the mind, but not binding it again. We
must have play instead of work; yet play that will be occupation.

<!-- page 121 -->

Hence the value which those sturdy, sober, untranscendental, unmedi&aelig;val
thinkers, the Scotch writers, have set upon field-sports and
exercises which carry them out among the heather, over the mountain,
and along the stream. Christopher North, (green be the turf
above him!) "under canvas," was worth more as a philosopher,
aye, as a philosopher, than any cobweb-spinning German, or backward-looking
Oxonian that ever ignored common humanity and its
every-day experience. Dyspepsia never soured his moral sentiments,
and, content with the cheerful sun, he left twilight to owls and bats.</p>

<p>Views like these led the little band of friends already spoken of
to the Piseco, on whose romantic bank they had built a simple lodge,
and whose waters abounded with several varieties of that aquatic
family, whose charms inspired Davy, not less admirable as a moralist
than an illustrator of natural science, to write his <i>Salmonia</i>. Some
of them were shrewd and successful in business; some of them
more given to books; one of them a preacher of Good News,
who loved his work, called Chaplain, not without warrant, for his
office was no sinecure; and all of them "honest, civil, and
temperate," as all anglers should be, and as (according to Izaak
Walton's infallible authority) all true anglers are. The lake is
about seven miles long, and nearly a mile and a half wide. Several
bays are curved out of the shore, the deepest, at the lower end,
called from an Indian, the stories told of whose life might make the
whole tradition apocryphal, had he not left his name, Girondicut
(the spelling is uncertain) to the most exquisite part of the water.
Some buildings, most of them abandoned to decay, show like a
peaceful hamlet at the upper end, but are hidden by a wooded promontory
from the lodge, before whose humble porch a cleared field,
flourishing with corn and grass, slopes gently toward the lake.
Everywhere else Nature is in her wildest grace or most sublime
magnificence.</p>

<p>Up in the morning with the thrush, (the lark Piseco knows not,
but the thrush is as early,) each in his well-trimmed boat, rowed by
a sinewy woodsman, with a rod out over each side, the friends parted
to troll in various directions, never so intent on their game as not
to enjoy the shadows deep in the clear waters, or watch the mists, as

<!-- page 122 -->

rolling away they revealed the mountains piled in grand clusters, or
stretching farther and farther, ridge over ridge, until their undulating
lines were lost in the blue sky. Nay, if truth be told, many a
finny prowler escaped the fate due to his murderous appetite,
because the thoughts of the angler were wandering in delicious
day-dreams, or aspiring gratefully to <span class="smcap">God</span>, who has made our
way to heaven lie through a world so beautiful. The sultry
noon found them under the shadow of spreading birch trees, near a
spring of icy coldness, where, after a rude but welcome meal, they
were wont to recline on a bank carpeted by blossoming strawberry-vines,
with the low dash of the rippling wave in their ear. Then it
was that stories of the morning sport, innocuous jests, and, not
seldom, grave yet pleasant discourse, sped the moments to the
cooler hours when the boats were manned again, and they parted
until the shadows fell: then another chat over the fragrant "cup that
cheers, but not inebriates," and to sleep soundly and sweetly till the
sun roused them to renewed gratifications. News of political strife,
pressures in the money-market, or foreign wars, never penetrated
those pure, peaceful solitudes. The nearest post-office was many
miles away across the mountains, and tidings only of the beloved
ones at home were allowed to come.</p>

<p>Those days are gone by, and the cheer of those friends will never
be heard over those waters again. One, the most revered of all,
sleeps in a holy grave, and his memory fades not in the hearts of his
comrades; in other haunts of wild nature they greet each other with
unabated affection; but for them Piseco is a word of memory, not
of hope.</p>

<p>The Sabbath there had peculiar charms. No church-going bell
rang through the woods, no decorated temple lifted its spire; but
the hush of divine rest was upon all around, a sense of the <span class="smcap">Holy
One</span> rested on the spirit, the birds sang more sweetly, the dews
of the morning shimmered more brightly, and the sounds of the
forest were like the voice of psalms. As the day went on toward
noon, the inhabitants, whose dwellings were scattered for miles
around, some down the rocky paths, others in boats on the lake,
singly or in companies, men, women, and little ones, might be seen

<!-- page 123 -->

drawing near to the lodge, where, when all assembled, they formed a
respectful and willing congregation of perhaps fifty worshippers,
and listened to the words of the preacher, who sought to lead
them by the Gospel of the Cross through nature up to the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of grace. Such opportunities were rare for them; never, indeed,
was a sermon heard there except on these occasions. The devout
(for <span class="smcap">God</span> the Saviour had a "few names" among them) "received the
word with gladness;" all were attentive, and their visitors found,
when joining with them in the primitive service, a religious power
seldom felt in more ceremonious homage.</p>

<p>On one of those sacred days there came among the rest two young,
graceful women, whose air and dress marked them as of a superior
cultivation. Their modest voices enriched the trembling psalmody,
and their countenances showed strong sympathy with the preacher's
utterances. At the close of the worship, they made, through one of
their neighbors, a request that the minister would pay a visit to their
mother, who had been a long time ill, and was near death. A promise
was readily given that he would do so the same day; but their
home lay four miles distant, and a sudden storm forbade the attempt.
The Monday morning shone brightly, though a heavy cloud at the
west suggested precautions against a thunder-shower. The friends
parted from the landing, each bent upon his purpose; but the chaplain's
prow was turned on his mission of comfort to the sick. Had
any prim amateurs of ecclesiastical conventionalities seen him with
his broad-brimmed hat, necessary for shelter from the sun, a green
veil thrown around it as defense from the mosquitoes near the shores,
his heavy water-boots, and his whole garb chosen for aquatic exigences,
(for, like Peter, he had girt his fisher's coat about him,) they
would hardly have recognized his errand. But the associations of the
scene with the <span class="smcap">Man of Nazareth</span> and the Apostles by the Sea of Galilee,
were in his soul, carrying him back to the primitive Christianity,
and lifting him above the forms with which men have overlaid its simplicity.
The boat flew over the placid waters in which lay mirrored
the whole amphitheatre of the mountain-shores, green as an emerald.
The wooded point hid the lodge on the one side, a swelling island the
hamlet on the other. No trace of man was visible. The carol of

<!-- page 124 -->

birds came off from the land; now and then the exulting merriment
of a loon rang out of the distance, and soon a soft, southern breeze,
redolent of the spicy hemlock and cedar, rippled the surface. The
Sabbath had transcended its ordinary hours, and shed its sweet blessing
on the following day. His rods lay idly over the stern as the
chaplain thought of the duty before him, and asked counsel of the
<span class="smcap">Master</span>, who "<span class="smcap">Himself</span> bare our sicknesses and carried our sorrows."
He remembered the disciples who said, "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he whom thou lovest
is sick;" and the gracious answer, "This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>, that the <span class="smcap">Son of Man</span> might be glorified
thereby."</p>

<p>It is not imagination merely that gives such power to the living
oracles, when they come to us where the testimony of nature unites
with the inspiration. It is the blessing of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, who sought the wilderness,
the shore, and the mountain-side to gain strength from communion
with his <span class="smcap">Father</span>. It was in such solitudes that our <span class="smcap">Example</span>
and <span class="smcap">Forerunner</span> found courage for his trial and suffering. Religion is
eminently social, but its seat is the heart of the individual believer,
and, whatever be the advantage of Christian fellowship, the flame
must be fed in private, personal converse with the <span class="smcap">Father</span> of our
spirits. He who has not been alone with <span class="smcap">God</span>, can seldom find him
in the crowded church.</p>

<p>A brief hour, briefer for these meditations, brought the keel of the
boat to a gravelly nook, where the mouth of the inlet formed a little
harbor. There, awaiting the chaplain's arrival, stood a tall, upright
man, past the prime of life, who, with a style of courtesy evidently
foreign, bared his gray head, and greeted his visitor by name as a
friend.</p>

<p>"You have kindly come, sir, to see my poor wife; I thank you
for it. She is now expecting you, for we heard the sound of your
oars as you turned the island."</p>

<p>A rough stone house, built by a speculator of former days,
stood on a knoll a little way from the stream, and the garden around
it was trimmed with some taste. As they entered, the owner said:</p>

<p>"Welcome to the mountain dwelling of an old soldier! He
(pointing to an engraved portrait of Blucher, wreathed with laurel

<!-- page 125 -->

leaves,) was my general, whose praise I once received as I lay
wounded on the field of battle. I am a Prussian, Sir, and came to
this country when my father-land had no farther use for my sword. I
have not been successful in my peaceful life, and misfortune after misfortune
drove me here, hoping to gather about us a few of my countrymen,
and make a German home; but in that I was disappointed.
The severe winters chilled their resolution, and now we are by ourselves.
The few neighbors about us are not of our class, but they are
kind and honest; and the world has nothing to tempt me back to it.
I have one brave son at sea. My two daughters you saw yesterday.
We had another, but she sleeps yonder."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly from the room. The chaplain, left to himself,
observed about the apartment various articles of refinement and
faded luxury, telling the story of more prosperous days. His subsequent
acquaintance with the family confirmed his first impressions.
Though not of high rank, they were educated, of gentle manners, and,
though for years remote from cultivated society, preserved the amenities
which now distinguished them. Only the father seemed to have
suffered for want of occupation, and, not unlikely, from habits formed
in camp, but now doubly dangerous in seclusion.</p>

<p>At a signal from another room, one of the daughters led the chaplain
to the bedside of the sufferer. The father sat with his face averted,
near an open window, through which came the laughing prattle of a
child, and a half-idiot serving-woman looked in wonderingly across
the threshold of an outer kitchen. The daughters, having raised
their mother's head on a higher pillow, and affectionately smoothed
her thin gray hair under the snow-white cap, withdrew to the other
side of the bed. The chaplain placed his broad hat, with its green
veil, on the little table, and sat silent for a while, not knowing how to
begin, since, as yet, nothing had given him a clue to the woman's state
of mind. She lay still and stone-like; her eyes were dry, with little
"speculation" in them; her lips moved, but uttered no sound; and
her hand, feebly stretched out, was cold and stiff. Her whole frame
was worn to extreme thinness, and the color of her skin told that the
seat of her disease was the liver.</p>

<!-- page 126 -->

<p>At length the chaplain, seeing that her soul was near its dread passage
into the eternal future, said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, my friend, to find you so very ill. You are soon to
die."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is a fearful thing to die; are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But to go into the presence of <span class="smcap">God</span>, our Judge, is a most solemn
change."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The preacher was confounded. The short answers, almost cold,
without emotion, the glazed eye, the rigid countenance, caused him to
doubt whether he had to contend with ignorance or insensibility.
Anxious to rouse some feeling, if possible, to startle into some attention,
as a physician applies the probe, he pushed severe declarations
of certain judgment and the danger of impenitence, reminded her
that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the Saviour of the believing, will be the Avenger of sin,
and that "there is no work or device in the grave," but "as the tree
falls, so it must lie." The tearless eye unwinkingly gazed on him,
and no shrinking followed his keen surgery.</p>

<p>"Madam, you are going before <span class="smcap">God</span>, and do you not fear?"</p>

<p>A faint smile stole struggling through her thin features, and a light,
like a star twinkling under a deep shadow, was seen far within her
eye, and pointing with her finger upward, she said, in a firm, low
tone:</p>

<p>"Though <span class="smcap">He</span> slay me, yet will I trust in <span class="smcap">Him</span>."</p>

<p>The chaplain bowed his head on the pillow and wept thanks. Here
was no ignorant or callous soul, but a child of <span class="smcap">God</span>, whose perfect love
had cast out fear.</p>

<p>"Yes, Christian soul, you are not afraid of evil tidings; your heart
is fixed, trusting in <span class="smcap">Him</span> who went this way before you. Fear no evil;
<span class="smcap">His</span> rod and <span class="smcap">His</span> staff, they will comfort you."</p>

<p>"Amen! blessed be <span class="smcap">His</span> name," replied the dying believer.
"It is true. I know in whom I have believed, and that <span class="smcap">He</span> is able to

<!-- page 127 -->

keep what I have committed to <span class="smcap">Him</span>. Because <span class="smcap">He</span> hath been
my Help, therefore under <span class="smcap">His</span> wings do I rejoice."</p>

<p>It seemed now as if the fountain of her speech was unsealed, and,
though no moisture was in her eyes, and the few drops which started
out on her forehead were cold and clammy, and the worn lineaments
had lost the power to smile, and she lay still as marble, yet, with a
voice clear and unfaltering, she went on to testify her faith in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and of the peace that filled her soul. A strength denied to her body
came from within.</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, I thank you for coming; I thank <span class="smcap">God</span> for sending you
to me, like the angel to Hagar in the wilderness. I prayed for it.
It is four long years since I heard the voice of a Christian minister,
and all that time I prayed for one to hold the water of life to my lips
once more. Now I know that <span class="smcap">He</span> has heard me; blessed be <span class="smcap">His</span>
name!"</p>

<p>The preacher interrupted her to say that she had not been left alone
by her <span class="smcap">God</span>, who needed not man's lips to comfort his people.</p>

<p>"Alone! no, never alone! I have seen <span class="smcap">Him</span> in <span class="smcap">His</span> mighty
works. I have heard <span class="smcap">Him</span> in the storms of winter and in the summer
winds. I had my Bible, <span class="smcap">His</span> own holy word. His <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> has been
with me. But I thank <span class="smcap">Him</span> for the voice of <span class="smcap">His</span> commissioned
servant, whose duty is to comfort <span class="smcap">His</span> people." . . . . . . .</p>

<p>The reader of this imperfect sketch can have little idea of the eloquence,
almost supernatural, pervaded by Scriptural language and
imagery, with which she spoke. It was the soul triumphing over the
fainting flesh; truth in its own energy, unaided by human expression;
a voice of the dead, not sepulchral, but of one near the gate of
heaven.</p>

<p>The chaplain knelt beside the bed and all the rest knelt with him;
but there was more of thanks than petition in his prayer. The clouds
that hung about the borders of eternity were so bright with the glory
beyond, that sorrow and pain were forgotten as he gave utterance to
the dying woman's memories and hopes, the memories of grace and
the hopes of immortality that met together in her faithful heart.
Nor need I add that his own gratitude was strong to the <span class="smcap">Good
Shepherd</span>, who had sent him to find this sheep among the mountains,

<!-- page 128 -->

not lost nor forgotten, but longing for a token of her <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span>
care.</p>

<p>When he rose from his knees, she thanked him again, but with
more visible emotion than before, said:</p>

<p>"Sir, I doubt not <span class="smcap">God</span> directed you here; and there is one favor
more I have asked of <span class="smcap">Him</span> and now ask through you. Three years
ago my eldest daughter died in my arms, assured of rest, but leaving
behind her a babe not two weeks old. 'Mother,' she said, just as she
was dying, 'I leave my child with you to bring her to me in heaven.
You will do it for <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> sake, and mine, and hers, mother. And,
mother, <span class="smcap">He</span> has told us to give little children to <span class="smcap">Him</span> in baptism.
Dear mother, promise that my child shall be baptized.' I promised,
and her spirit departed. Ever since, I have been praying and waiting
for some minister to find his way to us, but in vain. More than once
I heard of some who had come as far as Lake Pleasant, but none
reached Piseco, and I almost feared that I should die and not be able
to tell my child in heaven that the blessed water had been on her
baby's face. Yet, even in this, <span class="smcap">God</span> has been good to me. You will
baptize my little one?"</p>

<p>How gladly the chaplain assented, may be readily imagined. The
child was called in from her play on the grass-plat; her rosy, wondering
face was gently washed, and her light brown hair parted on her
forehead, and she stood, with her bare white feet, on a low bench by
her grandmother's pillow. The grandfather filled an antique silver
bowl with water, freshly dipped from a spring near the door. An
old brass-clasped folio of Luther's Bible was laid open at the family
record beside the water, the chaplain's broad hat on the other side.
He thought not, and none thought of his coarse gray coat or his heavy
boots. He was full of his sacred office, and the presence of the
<span class="smcap">Invisible</span> was upon him. The feeble woman, strengthened by love
and faith, raised herself higher on the bed and put her wasted arm
over the plump shoulders of the fair, blue-eyed child. The old man
and his daughters, and the dull-witted servant at the kitchen-door,
reverently standing, sobbed aloud; and, amidst the tears of all except
her whose source of tears was dried up for ever, the chaplain recited
the touching prayer of the Reformed Churches before the baptism of

<!-- page 129 -->

infants, and with the name of the departed mother breathed over her
orphan, in the name of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and of the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, and of the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, she was dedicated to <span class="smcap">God</span> by water sprinkled three
times on her sweet grave face. The grandfather handed a pen to the
chaplain, but it was lightly pressed to trace the inscription, for the
page was wet with the big drops that fell from the old man's eyes.</p>

<p>Many moments elapsed before the thanksgiving could be uttered,
and then the happy saint joyfully exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Bless you, Sir! I bless <span class="smcap">God</span> that <span class="smcap">He</span> has granted me this grace
before I die. Now I am ready to go to my child in heaven."</p>

<p>"My dear madam," answered the preacher, "it is, indeed, a blessed
ordinance; but the child of prayers for two generations would not
have missed the promise because of an impossibility on your part."</p>

<p>"No, no! the spirit is better than the form. She had the promise.
<i>I knew that she was in the covenant, but I wanted her in the fold</i>."</p>

<p>The chaplain entered his boat. Never did lake, and mountain,
and green shore look so beautiful, for they seemed all bathed with
holy light; and that noon, when, with his friends reclining on the
sward, he told the story of the baptism in the wilderness, their
moistened eyes expressed their sympathy with his joy.</p>

<p>Heaven opened for the grandmother a few days afterward. The
next year her <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> took up her child's child in his arms, and the
three were together among the angels. The grandfather lived but a
short time. One of the daughters having married a farmer, moved,
with her sister, down into the open country, where she also died in
her young beauty. Of the two other members of the family, I have
heard nothing since.</p>

<p>The old stone house still stands near the rushing inlet, but the
storms beat through its broken windows. Rank weeds have over-run
the garden, and brambles hide the spring near the kitchen door. Yet
the path from the landing-place can be followed; and should any of
my readers ever visit Piseco, now more accessible, but charming as
ever, they can easily recognize the scene of my story. It is ever fresh
and hallowed in my memory; for there I learned, by precious experience,
that the good <span class="smcap">God</span> never forgets those who trust in <span class="smcap">Him</span>, and
that, go where we will, we may carry <span class="smcap">His</span> blessing with us to some
heart thirsting for <span class="smcap">His</span> word.</p>

To gain the guerdon of a heartless king,
Amuse a gay, licentious court with lays

Firm as the rock-foundation of a tower,
Whom threat could not corrupt, nor bribe seduce,
To live one hour with Guilt on terms of truce;
Whose breast, the fortress of an iron will,
Harbored a hatred of Oppression still.

Despised of men, they toiled with fervent zeal,
Through good and ill report, for human weal;

<p>A LIFE WITH ONE PASSION.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY DONALD MAC LEOD.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> body who knows Dr. T&mdash;&mdash;, in a friendly way, knows
that his darling study is Psychology; and this has always interested
me exceedingly, as I suppose it interests every artist. Lately, in our
conversations, we have been devoted, he as master and I as scholar,
to the observation of characters formed by the development of a single
passion, as avarice, ambition, love, etc. His close, analytical mind
finds great pleasure in following and noting accurately the course of
such a development, from its first exterior manifestation to its result;
and he holds that when the soul is once fairly delivered up to the
dominance of a single passion, the principle of life itself becomes
involved, and that the end of the passion is only at the end of mortal
existence.</p>

<p>His anecdotes, thoroughly illustrative of his theory, are many and
of absorbing interest; and I only endeavor to repeat one here because
the general reader is never likely to learn it from him. At the
same time, I am convinced of my own incapacity to analyze like him.
I will tell one story, however, that haunted me for a long time, and, as
I am not a physician, but only a story-teller, I shall tell it in my own
way.</p>

<p>There is a young, beautiful woman, sitting among pillows and
cushions in an arm-chair, by an open window. The still atmosphere
is heavy with the scent of tube-roses, jessamines, heliotropes, and
other flowers of like powerful odor, which have always been her

<!-- page 136 -->

favorites. Filled as the air is with these rich fragrances, she adds
to them that of pastiles, burning on the chimney-piece, and her handkerchief
is wet with extracts of violets. Her skin is white, but not
transparent; it reminds you most of cream-laid note paper. The eyes
are lazy, full, and the color of the double English violets. The hair
is blond, an ashy blond, and has scarcely a wave in it; it could not be
made to curl, but lies in rich, heavy, almost damp bands, about the
face. Her form, though delicate, is thoroughly developed; the flesh
firm, the outlines as if chiseled, growing thin now, except the throat
and bust, and the hands and feet, which are very small, but rounded
and plump, with dimples at the joints. She wears a pale blue silk
<i>robe de chambre</i>, opening in front to show an under-dress of white
watered silk. On the table beside her is a bottle and glass of heavy,
rich Portugal wine, pure juice, which leaves a spoonful of sediment in
every glass.</p>

<p>Except to taste this, or to inhale the odors, as the light air throws
them occasionally through the window, or to respire the violet from
the handkerchief, she seldom raises her head from where it reclines,
thrown back upon the cushions, in which position she looks passionately
and dreamily at her husband's portrait, which hangs upon the
wall before her.</p>

<p>The portrait exhibits a man of twenty-six or seven, somewhat
sallow, thin, with heavy, wavy, chestnut hair, and large brown eyes,
not without some fierceness in them. There is nothing remarkable
about the face except the intense redness of the lips&mdash;the lady has
that also&mdash;so red that you fancy the painter a bad chooser of colors;
yet they say the likeness is perfect.</p>

<p>These are all the accessories which need be mentioned. Let the
lady tell her own story:</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father died before my birth; my mother perished in bringing
me, her only child, into the world. They left me a large fortune, and
my guardians were well-bred, very ordinary, every-day, well-to-do
people.</p>

<p>The first thing I ever loved, except strong perfumes and flowers,
was a bird, an English bulfinch, which seemed to be very fond of

<!-- page 137 -->

me, until one day, when I was about twelve or thirteen, it flew to a
young girl who was visiting me, and refused to come back when I
called it. When it did come, at last, I killed it in my hand.</p>

<p>I remember my nurse very well, and a pretty French maid who
attended me afterward; but I do n't think I cared much about either.</p>

<p>I do n't think that I loved any thing much except the bird that I
crushed in my hand; at least, until I got to be eighteen.</p>

<p>I was, of course, as is the case generally in New-York, taken into
society quite young&mdash;at sixteen, I think&mdash;and I saw a good deal of it.
I was rich, and I may say it now, beautiful, so that I did not lack
suitors who professed the profoundest devotion for me. Some of
them were pleasant, one or two handsome and fascinating men, and I
often wondered at the existence of my utter indifference for them all.
By-and-by I won the reputation of a cold, unaffectionate girl, and those
who were really worthy began to leave me to myself, and none
remained but those who thought only of my fortune. Cold and
unaffectionate! Ah! if they could have seen the ceaseless agonies of
tears into which I burst in my own room; if they could have seen
my arms trying to wind themselves round my own body, or felt the
thrills and yearnings of the unknown passion that convulsed me with
its power, that was consuming my heart!</p>

<p>There was a large party given on my eighteenth birth-day, and it
took its usual course. I have forgotten all about it until, about the
middle of it, I saw a young man standing in a corner looking at me.
As I met his look an indescribable thrill passed through me, and I felt
faint for a moment. My impulse was to rise and clasp him in my
arms. He haunted me and frightened me, yet I felt a strange desire
to get near him. When he came, at last, introduced by my guardian
as Mr. Mark Winston, I had scarcely strength or self-possession to
bow. He asked me to dance and I refused, I know not why; I never
cared for that amusement, yet I had never refused any one before.
Then he sat down and talked to me a little while, but the shrinking
still remained, and I answered I know not how or what. But he
dropped a glove beside me, and when he had gone, I picked it up,
and put it into my bosom; and when I was alone, I knew that I loved
him, and that that love was my life.</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p>Mark Winston was a Carolinian, and had brought no letters to the
North, except to my guardian, so that our house was almost his only
visiting-place. There was a pleasant, lively girl, niece to my guardian,
staying with us then, and our party commonly consisted of the
old people, Mark, Mary Lee, and myself. The spring came on and
passed away, and in the latter part of it, we went to a country-seat at
New-Rochelle.</p>

<p>Every hour my passion grew stronger; every hour it destroyed
some minor characteristic of my nature, and advanced toward its
end, the absorption of all my nature into itself. Still I shunned him,
inexplicably to myself; I craved to be near him, to hear him, to
watch him, to touch him with my dress in passing; but when he
came to me, a positive fear would take hold on me, and I would feel
almost ill. I stole from him; <i>stole</i> his gloves, his handkerchief; I
would have done any act of meanness; I have picked the pockets of
his coat when it hung in the hall. Once, noticing that the ribbon of
his watch was worn out, Mary Lee gave him another, which he put
on; and in doing so, he broke the crystal of his watch, and carried it
up to his room. But for this, I would have fainted, or else sprung
upon her; but this gave me a gleam of light. When he returned to
the drawing-room, I went up stairs, procured another ribbon, and
went into his room. I took her ribbon and tore it to pieces with my
hands and teeth, and carried it out and stamped it into the black soil
of the garden; but that which he had worn I had already in my
bosom, and I treasured that and the gloves and the handkerchief, and
whatever else of him I had, and kissed them, and sat looking at them
in my lap, and slept with them in my bosom through the long nights.
Yet for all this I could get no nearer to him.</p>

<p>At last I thought that he began to pay his addresses to Mary Lee,
and then I recognized that love had not eaten up all my nature, for
hate and rage still existed. Oh! what weary, weary weeks I spent
in watching them! How softly I crawled down stairs! How stealthily
I stole behind them in their walks! How I watched them conversing
in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the seventh of June&mdash;I had bought an almanac,
and I used to mark the days on which I saw him&mdash;on Thursday, the

<!-- page 139 -->

seventh of June, I saw him come up the avenue, and heard him enter
the house. He did not mount the stairs, but passed into the drawing-room,
and I <i>knew</i> that Mary Lee was there alone. I went to my
dressing-table, and swallowed from a fla&ccedil;on a glass of Cologne-water.
Then, when the shudder and tremor had passed over, I went gently
down, and saw the door half open. The door was in the middle of
the room; when partially open, you saw a huge mirror, which
reflected every thing in the room: they sat behind it. Half-way
down the stairs, I heard his voice, soft, low, pleading, tender: <span class="smcap">God</span>!
how long had this been going on? My satin slippers made no noise,
and I reached the half-open door and saw them in the glass; he with
her hand in his; I watched them there for a thousand centuries; and
I heard him say, "Do, dear Mary; do promise for to-morrow;" and
I heard her answer, in a timid, gentle voice, which seemed to me full
of love, "No, Mark, I dare not,"</p>

<p>Again he plead to her, and then&mdash;my eyes upon the mirror&mdash;then
he took her hand and kissed it. I saw him do it.</p>

<p>I struck the door open my hand was black for two weeks
and went in to where he still held her hand, and stood before them,
and struck my foot upon the ground.</p>

<p>Mary Lee ran out of the room.</p>

<p>"So," I said to Mark Winston, "you come here for that, do
you?"</p>

<p>He looked at me amazedly.</p>

<p>"You even must be base and dishonorable, you even can not
respect the sanctity of a friend's house; and you call yourself gentleman."</p>

<p>He grew white, a kind of ashy white; and his eyes grew three
shades darker, and burnt like living coals with rage. I feared him
not, and said:</p>

<p>"And to love a thing like Mary Lee!"</p>

<p>Then the fierceness passed instantly from his eyes; and a flood of
unutterable passion flowed&mdash;I saw it flow&mdash;into them, and he said:</p>

<p>"I was begging her to intercede with you, Louise, I never loved
any but you. But you are so cold, so unaffectionate, so incapable of
loving, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>I sank down upon the floor, and clasped his knees, and said,
"Mark, I love you, and have loved you, and will love you to eternity."</p>

<p>I remember my sitting upon his knees, with his strong arms, like
mighty cords, binding my bosom upon his. And then came that wild
rain of kisses, of consuming, devouring kisses, on my hair and eyes
and forehead, and quicker and faster on my lips and neck. I fainted
in his arms, on his convulsed bosom and impassioned, throbbing
heart. At least I suppose I fainted, for I remember nothing until I
found myself upon a sofa, with Mark kneeling at my feet, holding my
hands in his, and his tears raining hotly upon them, faster and hotter
than his kisses.</p>

<p>We were married on the fifteenth of September, and went to our
home immediately&mdash;a nice country-house on the north shore of
Long-Island&mdash;that was our home.</p>

<p>I do n't remember that we ever read, or drew, or had any music,
or any thing else of that kind. I remember the walks in the forest or
on the shore, and the flowers that he was fond of, and the perfumes
he liked best, and the love that both of us had for the heavy lamp
shades, ground simply and lined with rose-colored tissue paper.</p>

<p>I remember that I never before had taken particular care of my
person, except what is natural to any gentlewoman, but that now I
bathed twice every day, and studied every toilette, chiefly the morning
and the night-dress, and used no perfume but tube-rose, heliotrope,
and violet, which were his favorites, and lived as in a dream&mdash;a
long, may-be a bad, wicked, cruel, passionate dream.</p>

<p>All that I know is, that I was separated from him, and the physicians
said he was going to die; and when I asked to see him, they
said, "No; any body but you." He grew worse and worse.</p>

<p>They had forbidden me to go near him. My presence alone, they
said, was injurious to him. They would not answer for his life, if I
were to insist on seeing him. So I kept away in my own chamber
while people were stirring in the house; but, in the early morning,
when all was still, I used to creep to the door of his room, and crouch
down there and think of him.</p>

<p>By-and-by this became unendurable, and I began to question

<!-- page 141 -->

whether that cold-browed, scientific, quiet man had a right to keep a
wife from her husband. I had heard so often, that, for a point of
medical interest, any point new or curious in their science, they
would not hesitate to destroy fifty lives to procure an elucidation, I
determined at least to see. So I questioned Mark's nurse.</p>

<p>"Does he suffer much, nurse?"</p>

<p>"No, Ma'am; or, at least, he makes no complaint. Only just lies
there, still and dreaming-like, and putting out his arms, and then folding
them back round him again."</p>

<p>"Is he out of his mind at all?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">God</span> bless you! no. His eyes have no sparkle in them, and his
voice is as little as a child's, only deeper, like the church-organ, you
know, Ma'am, before they come to the loud part."</p>

<p>"But does he forget all his friends?"</p>

<p>"He never speaks about them, Ma'am, although the doctor is
always a-mentioning them to him; but while they talk about <i>them</i>, he
just lies there."</p>

<p>"About whom, then, does he talk?"</p>

<p>"O Ma'am, he hardly talks at all; only lies still, except his
arms, and looks always like he was thinking of somewhat; and when
he does speak, he never says but just only, 'Louise, Louise.' "</p>

<p>"Does he say 'Louise?' That is my name."</p>

<p>"Why, bless you, Ma'am, he never speaks nor thinks of any body
but you. He calls always for you, and then, after he calls awhile, he
seems to think as you have come, and he folds his arms in so&mdash;"
here the nurse imitated the motion; "not <i>folding</i> them up as the gentlemen
do, but kind of looking as if he were folding something else
up into them; and then he keeps a-saying 'Louise, Louise,' in a little,
low, soft voice, and by-and-by he falls asleep."</p>

<p>A new idea flashed upon me. Said I:</p>

<p>"Nurse, dear, they, the doctors, won't allow me to see him; are
they cross with you? Let me see: how long have you been watching
him?"</p>

<p>"Three nights now, Ma'am, on a stretch; but if I was ever so
tired, Ma'am, I could n't let you go in."</p>

<!-- page 142 -->

<p>"Oh! yes, I know that; but I want him well watched, and I am
afraid that they don't take care of you."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Ma'am, I get plenty to eat, but, to tell you the truth,
Ma'am, I have always been used to a little drop of wine, and I haven't
had none."</p>

<p>"Well, nurse, I will bring you some into the little dining-room,
and will call you when he gets asleep. Now go in and watch him."</p>

<p>She went into Mark's room, and I went to the sideboard, where I
found several decanters full. I chose a small one, in order that she
might drink it all. But first, I took it up to my own room, and put
some laudanum in it; and then I got some dry biscuit and anchovy
sauce to increase her thirst, and took it into the little dining-room.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven then, and I undressed myself, but did not go
to bed. I thought constantly of Mark, and I put on the pale-blue
dressing-gown, in which he used to admire me, and I let the bands of
my hair, which were very thick and heavy, fall down about my neck;
and then I sat down before the clock, and thought about him and of
the day when he first told me how he loved me, and of the day on
which we were married.</p>

<p>When the clock struck one, I went down, peeped in, and saw the
nurse moving about the chimney-piece. Then I went back to my
room, sat down, and thought of Mark until two. Then I went down
again, and, as I slightly opened Mark's door, I saw the nurse dozing
in her arm-chair. I could not see Mark, for the door, half-opened,
only showed the foot of his bed; but I heard him move and say
"Louise;" and I shivered as I heard him. Meantime his movement
or mine awakened the nurse, and she saw me.</p>

<p>I beckoned to her, and, after a glance at her charge, she came out.
I saw that she was cold, for they allowed no fire in Mark's room; and
I took her to the little dining-room, where a grate-full of coals was
blazing, and made her take an arm-chair near the fire. Then I began
to talk to her; but I made my remarks at long intervals, so that,
after a few moments, she fell back upon the cushions, and slept.</p>

<p>When I was assured of her slumber, I rose, and, woman that I am,
walked to the mirror. I saw that I was pale, and wondered what he
would think of me. Then I went into his room, and stood beside

<!-- page 143 -->

him. I had never before thought him handsome, but the pallor of his
skin made his eyes dark and full of languor; the moisture upon his
hair gave it a gloss which it never had worn in health, and his lips
were full and crimson. To me, at that moment, he looked surpassingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>He saw me at once, and after we had gazed at each other for a,
few moments, he put out his arms and said, "Louise, Louise;" and I
sank down into his arms.</p>

<p>The lights in the room had burned out, and the first gray tints of
morning began to appear, when I felt a fearful shudder pass over
Mark's form, and he writhed himself free from my embrace. Then
he asked hoarsely for water.</p>

<p>I sprang up, gave him a drink, and then stood at his bedside.</p>

<p>His eyes were on fire; his cheeks were covered with a burning
flush, and his hands trembled as he used them in gesticulation.</p>

<p>"Louise," he said, "I am dying."</p>

<p>Then an indefinable terror seized me, and I crouched down beside
the bed, but my eyes were fascinatedly fixed upon his.</p>

<p>"Louise, they told me, the doctors told me, that you were my
death; they told me that your love had killed me; and they wanted
me to quit you, Louise."</p>

<p>He put out his arms toward me, but I shrank from him with my
blood curdled.</p>

<p>"Louise, I mocked at them. I said you could not kill me, for you
had my life and soul in you as well as your own. <span class="smcap">God</span>! what a
pain!"</p>

<p>His form was thrown up from the bed in his agony, and then fell
down again.</p>

<p>"Mark, what can I do for you, darling?"</p>

<p>"Did you speak, Louise?" he said with a wild stare. "I saw
your lips move, but only heard your low, sweet voice saying, 'Mark,
Mark, I love you.' I hear it always. I feel your breath upon my
lips now. Come here, Louise. Quick!"</p>

<p>I bent toward him. His arms caught me in a fierce embrace,
and so he held me as if he would have pressed my very life into his
bosom, and he fastened his red lips on mine.</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>And there, in that clasp, the fires faded from his eyes, and his lips
froze there upon mine.</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">My</span> days pass pleasantly away,
    My nights are blest with sweetest sleep,
I feel no symptoms of decay,
    I have no cause to mourn nor weep.
My foes are impotent and shy,
    My friends are neither false nor cold;
And yet, of late, I often sigh,
                I'm growing old!</p>

<p class="stanza">My growing talk of olden times,
    My growing thirst for early news,
My growing apathy to rhymes,
    My growing love of easy shoes,
My growing hate of crowds and noise,
    My growing fear of taking cold,
All whisper in the plainest voice,
                I'm growing old!</p>

<p class="stanza">I'm growing fonder of my staff,
    I'm growing dimmer in the eyes,
I'm growing fainter in my laugh,
    I'm growing deeper in my sighs,
I'm growing careless of my dress,
    I'm growing frugal of my gold,
I'm growing wise. I'm growing&mdash;yes&mdash;

<p class="stanza">I see it in my changing taste,
    I see it in my changing hair,
I see it in my growing waist,
    I see it in my growing heir;
A thousand signs proclaim the truth,
    As plain as truth was ever told,
That even in my vaunted youth,
                I'm growing old!</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah me! my very laurels breathe
    The tale in my reluctant ears,
And every boon the Hours bequeath,
    But makes me debtor to the Years!
E'en Flattery's honied words declare
    The secret she would fain withhold,
And tells me in "How young you are!"
                I'm growing old!</p>

<p class="stanza">Thanks for the years, whose rapid flight
    My sombre muse too sadly sings!
Thanks for the gleams of golden light
    That tint the darkness of their wings!
The light that beams from out the sky,
    Those heavenly mansions to unfold,
Where all are blest, and none may sigh,

<h3 id="c17">Rambles in the "far West."</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY RALPH ROANOKE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1820, Missouri was the "far West," and Independence the
boundary of civilization. Now, in 1854, there is no "far West." It
has been crowded overboard into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Formerly, the hardy pioneer, impatient of the restraints of
society, and fired with the spirit of adventure, plunged into the
wilds of the West in search of happiness on his own hook. He had
no fear of a civilization which was travelling at a snail's pace to elbow
him out of his quiet home; neither did he recognize in himself its
champion, bearing the standard of empire westward. But now that
rampant spirit of go-ahead-ativeness which is knocking at the doors
of Congress for an appropriation to have our gold-diggers <i>rode on a
rail</i> is daily gaining strength, and will soon make itself heard. The
settlements which, under the present hot haste to make fortunes, are
to spring up and bridge over our vast western domain will wear a
new and widely different aspect. Pioneer life and pioneer progress
must soon pass away for ever, to be remembered only in story.</p>

<p>If the traveller of the present day takes no note of the changes,
leaves no foot-prints upon the sands of time, future generations will
utterly fail to appreciate from what beginnings and under what
auspices the great western cities have sprung into existence. They
may even imagine that, like Minerva, they sprang from the front
of those grand prairies, and from the banks of those mighty rivers,
ready paved with cubical blocks of granite and brilliantly lighted
with gas.</p>

<p>Perhaps no era in American history has been more fruitful in the
birth of what are destined to become genuine cities, or so prolific in

<!-- page 148 -->

spurious abortions, as that period of which, as Captain Cuttle would
say, I am about "to make a note." In the year 1837 the spirit
of speculation in "town sites" along the banks of the western rivers,
and in the large prairies of Illinois and Missouri was running riot
throughout the United States. Golden harvests of profit were
mathematically demonstrated on well-drawn and highly-colored maps,
and enticingly offered to those who wanted to turn a quick and
safe penny. Cautious and plodding citizens were tempted out of
their ordinary occupations and six per cent investments into the
whirlpool of chance. Even worthy pastors were known to dabble in
"town sites," doubtless with the hope of eking out their scanty
salaries by a large advance upon a small investment. The East was
in a state of fermentation, and the West was teeming with land
speculators, plotting and counterplotting to establish eligible localities.
Well would it have been for many who ventured into such
speculations had they been blessed with bumps of caution sufficiently
large to suggest the propriety of a personal visit to that land of milk
and honey. For seldom, if ever, has there been a more nefarious
scheme set on foot to rob the credulous and unwary of their hard
earnings than the sale of town lots in embryo cities, made attractive
on well-painted plots. Often must the traveller on those western
rivers sigh over the many disappointed hopes indicated by the
skeleton frames of houses imported from the East, dropped here and
there on "<i>corner lots</i>" and left deserted in their glory to commemorate
the folly of their deeply-deceived owners.</p>

<p>A sadder picture could scarcely be imagined than one of those
"town sites," in the centre of which might be seen a miserable hut,
giving the only presumptive evidence that a human being had ever
dwelt there. Looking deeper into the middle-ground in search of him
who called it home, anxious to find whether he was an object of pity,
as all around indicated, the weary eye finally rested upon a few overgrown
mounds and a freshly-made grave, the silent yet speaking interpreters
of the landscape. The damp chills of the night and the
poisonous miasma of the swamps had engendered fevers, and life,
unaided by comforts and unsupported by sympathy, had yielded its
spirit a victim to misplaced confidence.</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>In imagination I could perceive these squatter ghosts waiting in
solemn silence for the darkness of night to assemble together to howl
away its gloom in deep lamentations over the loss of their money;
or, like a tribe of witches, to stir up their boiling cauldron with direful
incantations, ever and anon sending forth horrific nightmares to
drive away sweet and balmy slumber from the eyelids of the "land
speculators" who had seduced them from their peaceful and happy
homes in the East, to try their fortunes in the West.</p>

<p>It was during the height of this town-making mania that I chanced
to be making a tour throughout the West. To one who is fond of
the study of humanity in all its various phases, such an era and such
a field of observation affords an infinite variety of amusement and
instruction. I not only obtained an insight into pioneer life, and the
<i>modus operandi</i> of land-speculators, but also had the rare good fortune
to make the discovery that a weasel can be caught asleep.</p>

<p>But while I enter my protest against that nefarious scheme of
town-making, I most cheerfully give my testimony in favor of the
local advantages and flourishing prospects of the town of Glasgow, in
the State of Missouri. I came in sight of this embryo city just as
the last rays of the setting sun were illuminating the slope of the hill
on which it is located. Although but three months old, it had its
tavern, its store, its blacksmith-shop, and many other signs of prosperity.
<i>Onward</i> was written on its first page; and to sum up my
impressions in a sentence, I mentally admitted it must flourish.</p>

<p>I have said Glasgow had its house of entertainment. This was
true. But it was not to be recognized by any of those outward signs
which ordinarily hang dangling before the door, doling out some
favorite ditty of the passing breeze. Looking around me as I entered
the town by the main road, and riding into the centre of an open
square which was marked out by the houses on the four corners, I
saluted a good-natured, broad-mouthed, honest-looking old darkie with</p>

<p>"How dy, uncle: is this the town of Glasgow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Massa, dis am he."</p>

<p>"Thank you, uncle; which is the best hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! yah! what dat you say, Massa? Which am de best
hotel?"</p>

<!-- page 150 -->

<p>"Yes, where would you recommend me to stop?"</p>

<p>"Why, see here, Massa, just take a correspontal view of dem
primsis, and den ax dis niggar which am de best hotel? We do n't
got no hotel in dis town. You call dat house a hotel! Yah! yah!
yah!"</p>

<p>"Well, but uncle, you do n't mean to say you have no hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I does mean to make dat statement for a solemn fac'.
Massa, do you tink I do n't know what am a hotel? I do n't come
from old Ferginy for nothin'. White folks can't fool dis child.
Whar's de Gen'l Washington? Whar's de Gen'l Jackson? Talk
about a hotel whar you do n't see none ob dem great gemmen hangin'
up fore de door!"</p>

<p>I soon discovered that my old colored friend was somewhat facetious,
and prided himself upon once having lived in Old Virginia,
where the "Mansion House" was honored by the "Father of his
Country," or the "Hero of New-Orleans" to watch over it in all kinds
of weather. Returning to the charge with,</p>

<p>"Well, uncle, I see you were not brought up among 'poor white
folks,' so here is a picayune for you to drink the health of</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'<span class="smcap">Old</span> Virginia never tire
Eat parch corn and lie by the fire.'</p>

</div>

<p>Now tell me where can I get accommodations for the night?"</p>

<p>Unluckily for me, this last speech touched a chord deep down in
the old man's heart, and instead of giving me an answer, his memory
was wandering back to happier days. He seemed determined to
overwhelm me with questions in turn.</p>

<p>"O lossey Massa, I'aint hearn dem delishus words since dese
twenty years. Oh! where did you come from? Did you ever see
my boy, Jim Sampson? O Jim! Jim! you could wait on de
gemmen! You could make de boots shine like two puter dollars
stuck in a mud-hole! O Jim! if de old man could just see him
once more fore he dies!</p>

<p>I was loth to break the old man's soliloquy. It was so natural,
unaffected, deep, and touching&mdash;and, alas! what a comment upon

<!-- page 151 -->

the human affections! But it was now night; and cold, and hungry, I
could not wait for his assistance. I therefore rode up to a house on
the brow of the hill and inquired of a woman standing at the door:</p>

<p>"Madam, will you please direct me to a house of entertainment?"</p>

<p>"<i>We take in strangers</i>," was her ominous reply.</p>

<p>"Thanks, madam, thanks! I am very tired and hungry, and
would like an early supper."</p>

<p>I soon dismounted and took the first opportunity to survey the
premises. It was a log cabin, built two stories high, with but two
rooms, one above and one below. It stood on the slope of the hill,
with the lower side to the street. On the upper side was a small
addition, made by driving four posts in the ground and fastening
thereto, by means of wooden pins, huge slabs of boards sawed out
from butts of trees, and placed at such a distance apart as to admit
air and light. This addition was the great convenience of the premises.
It served for kitchen, smoke-house, larder, pantry, wash-house;
in fact for every thing but the entertainment of strangers.
The first floor of the main building was filled quite full of chairs,
tables, and cupboards, in which the nicely-wiped crockery was tastefully
displayed. In one corner of the room was a bed, which, from
its cozy, home look, I took to be the resting-place of the master and
mistress of the premises. The darkness of the room prevented my
making any further observations as to the upper story, except to see
that those bound upward had to climb a small, narrow, rickety
ladder that stood in one corner.</p>

<p>There was nothing peculiar about the host and hostess except a
glaring disparity in their ages, the lady looking as if she might be
more readily taken for daughter than wife. Still there was a robust
vigor about the man which might readily encourage a widower in a
new country to venture a second wife rather than undergo the ills of
solitude. Beside, some how or other, in all new countries, the male
animal being in reality a kind of monarch of all he surveys, has a
wonderful propensity to be waited upon, and the last act of benevolence
he would be likely to be guilty of would be to allow any young
lady to live without a master while he could officiate in that capacity.

<!-- page 152 -->

The old man and I chatted, while the young wife prepared the supper,
which, in the West, especially with travellers, is a hearty meal, the
rule being to eat but twice a day. Consequently, the preparation for
supper was no small affair. There was evidently, however, a shyness
and reserve about him, which I did not at first exactly comprehend.
Subsequent experience would have enlightened me on that subject at
once, but it was some time before I discovered that he had a great dread
of "land speculators," and suspected me for being one of those much-dreaded
animals, so unpopular in all new countries. I was not ignorant
of the great curiosity of all mankind, and particularly of those
removed from much society, and I might have adopted Franklin's
plan of telling him my name, business, and residence if I had not
taken peculiar pleasure in watching his plan of attack to unravel the
mystery of my appearance in "those parts." Beside, it was as
pleasant a way as any to beguile the time before supper.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger," said he, "if I may make so bold, what might
your name be?"</p>

<p>"Not bold at all," replied I, "but a very natural question indeed,
Sir. My opinion is that Glasgow will some day become a very large
and flourishing city. By the way, can you tell me, Sir, is there much
land about here to be had at government price?"</p>

<p>"Why you see," continued he, "my business of intertainin'
travellers is not very agreeable. I git many a customer that do n't
look fit to be trusted with a night's lodgin;" and, glancing above the
door with a sort of blood-or-money expression to see that his never-failing
rifle was there, continued; "but you see I keep a close watch
on 'em, and if any 'scapes me they're welcome to all they git."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said I, "I should think from your phrenological developments
that you were a very benevolent man, and I have no
doubt that as you have lived in this country for many years, and
know all about the lands, that you would take great pleasure in pointing
out to a stranger such as are vacant."</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined he, "I should think you came from Kentuck.
There's a great many land-hunters from Kentuck and Virginy looking
about Howard county, and I do n't see what for, nuther. There's many
counties just above this where land is much better and plentier."</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p>A slight interruption to our game of dodge and gammon occurred
here, by the entrance of the wife to ask the old man whether the
stranger would have tea or coffee. To which I volunteered an
answer:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Madam; you are very kind. I will take tea."</p>

<p>Looking somewhat confused, she stammered out:</p>

<p>"I am sorry we have no tea in the house; it's just out."</p>

<p>"No matter," said I; "either will do."</p>

<p>But, as if a new thought had struck her, she continued:</p>

<p>"O Sir, if you would like tea, John can get some down at the
store. We are very well fixed now; we can get sugar, and coffee,
and tea, and molasses, and nails, and spades, and axes, and almost any
of the luxuries of life."</p>

<p>I replied:</p>

<p>"Madam, I dislike to give your good husband any trouble, but if
he could procure me a cup of tea, it would really be a very great
favor, I so seldom meet with such good society where one can get a
nice cup of tea."</p>

<p>This last compliment was irresistible, and <i>nolens volens</i>, John
Williams was despatched for tea. This afforded me a few moments'
conversation with the kind-hearted wife, who confidingly told me that
her husband, Mr. John Williams, was a very clever man. It was
true he had some strange ways about him, but after all, when he
was n't crossed in his humor he was very kind. A pause in the conversation
gave me an opportunity to observe her more closely, and I
saw clearly that there was something on her mind which she would
like to communicate, and I frankly said:</p>

<p>"Madam, excuse the liberty, but if I am not mistaken you have
some question to ask me, and it will afford me great pleasure to serve
you if in my power. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," she replied, "but I am sure you will excuse me when
I tell you that my husband is a poor man, and is saving up money to
buy a piece of land just across the river, which he is afraid every day
will be entered by some of those 'land-hunters,' and he has no peace of
his life. Now, Sir, I hope you do n't intend to enter it. Do you, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Give yourself no more uneasiness on that account, my dear

<!-- page 154 -->

Madam; I assure you I am not a land-hunter, and have not the slightest
intention of buying a foot of ground in the country."</p>

<p>No one but a married man can appreciate the sunny smile of triumph
which this good woman could not conceal as she thought of the
pleasure she had in store for the old man. Just as he returned with
the tea, in stalked another stranger, who seated himself <i>con amore</i>.
The old man and I did not resume our game of attack and defense.
It was easy to see that his wife had whispered something in his ear,
and that his suspicions were transferred from me to the new-comer.
The stranger was "the observed of all observers." I acknowledge to
some slight curiosity to see who was to be my companion for the
night, not doubting that if any number short of a dozen were to
arrive, they would all be bundled together in the same bed. The
good wife had a very proper curiosity to scan his dimensions with a
view to ascertain how much additional provender to prepare; and the
old man, ever ready to discover his mortal foe&mdash;a land-hunter&mdash;in
every traveller, came down upon him with a fixed stare that would
have disconcerted any body but an Irishman or a Yankee pedlar.</p>

<p>The object of our scrutiny was a tall, round-shouldered, hatchet-faced
individual, with that lignum-vit&aelig; complexion which would keep
one guessing till doomsday, whether he was just thirty-five years old
last thanksgiving day, or would be fifty the next. At a glance you
would feel in doubt whether he was a rough son of West-Tennessee, or
a '<i>cute one</i> in disguise from the land of pumpkin-pies and steady habits;
but one word uttered, and the doubt was at once dispelled. However,
let him speak for himself.</p>

<p>"Wall, I reckon as how I'm just in the nick of time, and no mistake.
Them are pork stakes a-fryin out there wake up one's innards
at such a 'tarnal rate that I'm almighty skeared least the old woman
should do up a short allowance. I say, landlord, I've a notion this is
a-growin up to be a smart sort of a town. How would a lot of
notions take among ye? I'm not partic'lar. I'll swap for any thing.
Would n't mind locatin' somewhere in these parts."</p>

<p>And so he might have run on until his mouth was filled with a
piece of the fat pork which he had scented out so sagaciously, if the
old man had not given him very strong indications of displeasure and

<!-- page 155 -->

astonishment at his nonchalance. When it is remembered that our
new-comer had brought with him no visible responsibilities in the
shape of a horse, wagon, or pair of saddle-bags, and that his garments
had seen many <i>rent-days</i>, the old man's indignation may be readily
conceived and appreciated, as he asked in a sharp tone:</p>

<p>"Have you any business with me, Sir?"</p>

<p>The Yankee replied:</p>

<p>"Wall, now, I rather guess I have. I hope I hain't made no mistake
nor nothin'. I inquired of that woolly-headed chap what set me
over the river a spell ago, where I'd find a night's lodgin', and he
p'inted right straight here, old dad, and no mistake, and I walked
right in and made myself to hum."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man; "I think you do make yourself at home
with a vengeance."</p>

<p>The Yankee rejoined:</p>

<p>"Now, old gentleman, I just begin to see how it is. I'm all the
way from down-east, and I'm rather green out here, but not quite so
green as a drake's neck. If you've any notion that I can't fork down
the dust, I rather guess you're a little bit out of your latitude."</p>

<p>The old man looked at me, and I could see he felt that he had
gone rather too far, and, in judging too much by appearances, had not
manifested his usual discretion. I answered his inquiring glance by
an indication that I thought our Yankee was all right, and the old man
was greatly relieved by a summons "to walk up to the supper-table,
and be seated."</p>

<p>Who that has ever been really hungry from exposure and violent
exercise, can fail in his imagination to see the warm fumes rise up
from a large pewter platter of fried pork, and as he scents the delicious
odor, congratulate our small party on the bounties before them?
Down we sat and fell to work in right good earnest. For a few
moments there was a truce to conversation&mdash;to the etiquette of asking
your next neighbor if you might have the pleasure of helping him
to this nice bit of lean, or that laughing potato. Even our Yankee
was metamorphosed into a man of deeds, and not of words, he having
hardly waited for the common announcement by the landlady, "Now
all turn to and help yourselves."</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>How lamentable has been his lot who has been reared in the lap
of luxury, and never known the ecstasy of appeasing an honest,
healthy appetite! Now would I give a guinea if Miss Bremer had
been present to see our Yankee eat. Reader, how many times do
you think he would have asked her to take "pickles?" Thanks to
the good landlady, she had a whole hog to cater from; and as fast as
a platter-full was demolished, another rose up piping hot in its place,
until I began to doubt whether my friend, the Yankee, had ever eaten
a meal before in his life, or whether he might not have the faculty,
among his other thrifty habits, of imitating the Pelican in stowing
away provisions for a rainy day.</p>

<p>But as all sublunary things must have an end, so it was with our
supper. After a hearty meal over the warm fire, the traveller is soon
wandering in the land of Nod, and seldom adds much to the stock of
information, as the family group sit chatting around the huge fire
place where whole trees are made food for the devouring flames.</p>

<p>It was evidently the desire of the old man to extract the Yankee's
history in a social chat after tea; but either the Yankee was mum,
when no more was to be made, or he was holding an indignation
meeting within himself on account of his previous treatment. Certain
it was, that, with the question of "Where am I to lay to-night?"
he left us to enjoy ourselves as we best could without even a passing
good-night. Well do I remember how he dragged himself up the
rickety ladder in the corner; and as he went, I mentally exclaimed:
"Well, my good fellow, peace be to the manes of the fat porker who
sleeps with you to-night! May you dwell in harmony together!"</p>

<p>The old man pressed me for my opinion of his lodger, intimating
that he did not half like his looks, and would n't wonder if he was in
search of land, adding that he had always made it a point to know all
about his guests before they passed a night under his roof, but this
fellow would give him no satisfaction. The more he thought of it, the
more indignant he grew, and, but for me, would have gone up after
him to demand an explanation.</p>

<p>But I told him I had no doubt he would turn out a good-enough
fellow in his way, and after a good night's rest would grow more communicative.
The old man shook his head, expressive of his great

<!-- page 157 -->

doubts, and by this time the good wife had put every thing to rights
for the night. Sleep soon began to wait upon me, and, bidding them
good-night, I clambered up the ladder with a small tin saucer, half-filled
with lard, in which a bit of wick, lighted at one end, floated
quite cozily.</p>

<p>On reaching the upper room, I could discern, by this dull light,
that it was the same size as the one below, and had a bed in each corner.
To have a whole bed to myself was a most unexpected luxury.
My worthy friend, the Yankee, had, by accident, taken possession of
the bed in the corner immediately over the one in the lower room,
which was occupied by the landlord and his wife, and was sound
asleep, giving evidence that my orisons for his good night's rest were
being realized. I must here explain, that, owing to a scarcity of flooring
plank, the floor upon which we were sleeping was not entirely
laid. The legs of the four bed-posts next to the walls were left to
rest upon one single plank, leaving all the space under the beds open
and communicating with the room below. The inner legs of the bed-posts
rested upon other planks, and that portion of the floor which
was in sight between the beds was all properly laid, except that they
were not nailed down, and made an ominous creaking as I walked
over them to choose my lodging-place, which I instinctively took as
far from the Yankee as possible. Now, this vacuum under our beds
was not known to either of us when we went to bed, and we laid
down in our respective places, unconscious of any lurking danger
beneath us. Fatigue is a great promoter of sound sleep; and I
should, doubtless, have remained quietly in the arms of Morpheus
until morning, had I not been aroused by the sound of a human voice,
apparently in great agony. Having gone to bed, fully impressed
with the idea of a catastrophe in that quarter, I asked, half-asleep and
half-awake:</p>

<p>"Who is making that noise? Is it the Yankee, or the pig?"</p>

<p>To which I received no other answer than another groan. Rising
up upon my elbow, I listened and soon discovered that the noise proceeded
from the bed of the Yankee, and immediately sung out:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>But my question seemed to have no other effect than to increase

<!-- page 158 -->

the rapidity of the Yankee's utterance, as he continued soliloquizing
his nightmare:</p>

<p>"O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! this beats all natur'. Aunt Jemima,
what shall I do?"</p>

<p>Jumping up in my bed, I cried out loud enough to alarm the
house:</p>

<p>"Hello there! are you mad or dreaming? What's all that infernal
noise about? Are you going to die with the cramp-colic, and
have me hung for murder?"</p>

<p>By this time I was getting furious, really not knowing whether the
fellow was shamming or crazy, as I could not get a word out of him.
But to my last appeal he appeared to understand that a friend was
near, and groaned out:</p>

<p>"Them darned pork-steaks have given me the 'Minerva Jane.' "</p>

<p>At this announcement, I was almost convulsed with laughter; but
his continued groans soon awakened a sympathy for his sufferings,
and I replied:</p>

<p>"Why do n't you see if the landlord has any brandy?"</p>

<p>No quicker suggested than attempted; but what was my horror
when, as he bounded out of bed, and was feeling in the dark for
his boots, I heard one long agonizing yell of, "Murder! murder!" as
he went head-foremost through the aperture down into the bed on the
lower floor. Before his voice had died away, the sound was re&euml;choed
by the old man, upon whom he had fallen, and who, being stunned by
the shock, and awakened out of a dream about land-hunters, redoubled
the shouts until the whole house rang with the startling cry. Springing
out of bed, and hurrying on my clothes, I ran down the ladder,
and reached the group, just as the wife had struck a light, and the old
man had discovered the cause of the disturbance in the form of the
suspicious Yankee. The terror of the shock and the monstrosity of
the act, added the strength of Hercules to the old man's muscles, and
he fell to belaboring the poor horrified Yankee most soundly. No
asseverations of innocence could reach the reason of the "green-eyed
monster;" and, but for the timely aid of the Madam and myself, who
dragged the old tiger off, the Yankee's peddling-days would have been

<!-- page 159 -->

numbered. Nothing could have pacified the old man but my relation
of the accident, and the Yankee's Bible-oath that he was no land-hunter.</p>

<p>Months afterward, I met this same Yankee on the Levee in New-Orleans,
and he declared to me that when he had closed out his venture
of notions&mdash;which did n't take in them parts&mdash;he would go
home to Varmount, and never, as long as he lived, would he eat fat
pork for supper, or go to sleep in a strange garret without first looking
under the bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of those villages peculiar to our Eastern coast, whose long
lines of pepper-and-salt stone-fences indicate laborious if not profitable
farming, and the saline breath of the ocean has the effect of
making fruit-trees more picturesque than productive, in a stone
chunk of a house, whose aspect is quite as interesting to the geologist
as to the architect, lives Captain Belgrave.</p>

<p>The Captain, as he says himself, "is American clean through,
on the father's side, up to Plymouth Rock, and knows little, and cares
less, of what is beyond that." To hear him talk, you would suppose
Adam and Eve had landed there from the May-Flower, and the
Garden of Eden was located within rifle distance of that celebrated
land-mark. His genealogical table, however, stands upon unequal
legs; for, on his mother's side he is part German and part Irishman.
I mention this for the benefit of those who believe that certain
qualities in men are hereditary. Of course it will be easy for them
to assign those of Captain Belgrave to their proper source.</p>

<p>The house is square, and not remarkable except for its stone
turret on one corner. This, rising from the ground some forty feet,
embroidered with ivy, and pierced with arrow-slits, has rather a
feudal look. It stands in a by-lane, apart from the congregated
village. On the right side of the road is a plashy spring, somewhat
redolent of mint in the summer. Opposite to this, in a clump of

<!-- page 164 -->

oaks, surrounded with a picket-fence, is the open porch, with broad
wooden benches, and within is an ample hall, looking out upon well-cultivated
fields, and beyond&mdash;blue water! This is the "Oakery," as
Captain Belgrave calls it. Here he lives with his brother Adolphus&mdash;bachelors
both.</p>

<p>His title is a mystery. There is a legend in the village, that in
the last war Belgrave was enrolled in the militia on some frontier.
One night he was pacing as sentinel on a long wooden piazza in front
of the General's quarters. It was midnight; the camp was asleep,
and the moon was just sinking in a bank of clouds. Belgrave heard
a footstep on the stairs at the end of the piazza. "Who goes there?"
No answer. Another step. "Who goes there?" he repeated, and
his heart began to fail him. No answer&mdash;but another step. He
cocked his musket. Step, step, step, and then between him and
the sinking moon appeared an enormous head decorated with diabolical
horns. Belgrave drew a long breath and fired. The next
instant the spectre was upon him; he was knocked down; the
drums beat to arms; the guard turned out, and found the sentinel
stretched upon the floor, with an old he-goat, full of defiance and
odor, standing on him. From that time he was called "Captain."</p>

<p>No place, though it be a paradise, is perfect without one of the
gentler sex. There is a lady at the Oakery. Miss Augusta Belgrave
is a maiden of about&mdash;let me see; her age was formerly inscribed
on the fly-leaf of the family Bible between the Old and New Testaments;
but the page was torn out, and now it is somewhere in the
Apocrypha. No matter what it may be; if you were to see her,
you would say she was safe over the breakers. Two unmarried
brothers, with a spinster sister, living alone: it is not unfrequent
in old families. The rest of the household may be embraced in
Hannah, the help, who is also "a maiden all forlorn," and Jim, the
stable-boy. Jim is a unit, as well as the rest. Jim has been a
stable-boy all his life, and now, at the age of sixty, is only a boy
ripened. His chief pride and glory is to drive a pair of bob-tailed
bay trotters that are (traditionally) fast! Adolphus, who has a turn
for literature, christened the off-horse "Spectator;" but the near
horse came from a bankrupt wine-broker, who named him "Chateau

<!-- page 165 -->

Margaux." This the Captain reduced to "Shatto," and the village
people corrupted to "Shatter!"</p>

<p>There was something bold and jaunty in the way the Captain used
to drive old Shatter on a dog-trot through the village, (Spectator
rarely went with his mate except to church on Sundays,) with squared
elbows, and whip depending at a just angle over the dash-board.
"Talk of your fast horses!" he would say. "Why, if I would only
let <i>him</i> out," pointing his whip, like a marshal's baton, toward
Shatter, "you would see <i>time!</i>" But he never lets him out.</p>

<p>The square turret rises considerably above the house-roof. Every
night, at bed-time, the villagers see a light shining through its narrow
loop-holes. There are loop-holes in the room below, and strong casements
of ordinary size in the rooms adjoining. In the one next to it
Miss Augusta sleeps, as all the village knows, for she is seen at times
looking out of the window. Next to that is another room, in which
Adolphus sleeps. He is often seen looking out of that window.
Next, again, to that is the vestal chamber of Hannah, on the southwest
corner of the house. She is sometimes seen looking out of the
window on either side. Next to that again is the dormitory of Jim,
the stable-boy. Jim always smells like a menagerie, and so does his
room, no doubt. He never looks out of the window except upon the
Fourth of July, when there is too much noise in the village to risk
driving Spec and Shat. No living person but the occupants has
ever been in that story of the house. No living person understands
the mystery of the tower. The light appears at night through the
loop-holes in the second story, then flashes upward, shines again
through the slits in the lofty part of the turret, burns steadily half
an hour or so, and then vanishes. Who occupies that lonely turret?</p>

<p>Let us take the author-privilege and ascend the stairs. First we
come to Jim's room; <i>we pass through</i> that into Hannah's apartment.
There is a bolt on the inside of her door; we pass on into the room
of Adolphus; it, too, has a bolt on the inside. Now all the virtues
guide and protect us, for we are in the sleeping-apartment of the
spinster sister! It, too, has a bolt on the inside; and here we are in
the tower: the door, like the rest, is bolted. There is nothing in the
room but the carpet on the floor; no stair-case, but a trap-door in the

<!-- page 166 -->

ceiling. It is but a short flight for fancy to reach the upper story.
The trap is bolted in the floor; there is a ladder standing beside it;
here are chairs, a bureau, a table, with an extinguished candle, and
the moonlight falls in a narrow strip across the features of Captain
Belgrave, fast asleep, and beside him a Bible, and an enormous horse-pistol,
loaded.</p>

<p>Nowhere but in the household of some old bachelor could such
discipline exist as in the Oakery. At night the Captain is the first to
retire; Miss Augusta follows with a pair of candlesticks and candles;
then metaphysical Adolphus with his mind in painful state of fermentation;
then Hannah, the help, with a small brass candlestick; then
Jim, the stable-boy, who usually waits until the company is on the
top-stair, when he makes a false start, breaks, pulls himself up, and
gets into a square trot just in time to save being distanced at the
landing. Adolphus and Jim are not trusted with candles. Miss
Augusta is rigorous on that point. She permits the Captain to have
one because he is careful with it; beside, he owns the house and
every thing in it; the land and every thing on it; and supports the
family; therefore his sister indulges him. We now understand the
internal arrangement of the Oakery. It is a fort, a castle, a citadel,
of which Augusta is the scarp, Jim the glacis, Hannah the counter-scarp,
and Adolphus the ditch. The Captain studied the science of
fortification after his return from the wars.</p>

<p>The Belgraves are intimate only with one family in the village,
and they are new acquaintances&mdash;the Mewkers. There is Mr.
Mewker, Mrs. Mewker, Mrs. Lasciver, formerly Miss Mewker, and
six or seven little Mewkers. Mewker has the reputation of being a
good man, but unfortunately his appearance is not prepossessing.
He has large bunchy feet, with very ineffectual legs, low shoulders,
a sunken chest, a hollow cavity under the waistcoat, little, weak,
eyes that seem set in bladders, straggling hair, rusty whiskers,
black, and yellow teeth, and long, skinny, disagreeable fingers;
beside, he is knock-kneed, shuffling in gait, and always leans on one
side when he walks. Uncharitable people say he leans on the side
where his interests lie, but Captain Belgrave will not believe a word
of it. Oh! no; Mewker is a different man from that. He is a member

<!-- page 167 -->

of the church, and sings in the choir. He is executor of several
estates, and of course takes care of the orphans and widows. He
holds the church money in trust, and of course handles it solely to
promote <i>its</i> interests. And then he is so deferential, so polite, so
charitable. "Never," says the Captain, "did I hear him speak ill of
any body, but he lets me into the worst points of my neighbors by
jest teching on 'em, and then he excuses their fibles, as if he was kind
o' sorry for 'em; but I keeps my eye onto 'em after the hints he give
me, and he ca n't blind me to <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>Harriet Lasciver, formerly Miss Mewker, is a widow, perfectly
delicious in dimples and dimity, fond of high life and low-necked
dresses, music, birds, and camelias. Captain Belgrave has a great
fancy for the charming widow. This is a secret, however. You and I
know it, <i>and so does Mewker</i>.</p>

<p>It is Sunday in Little-Crampton&mdash;a summer Sunday. The old-fashioned
flowers are blooming in the old-fashioned gardens, and the
last vibration of the old rusty bell in the century-old belfry seems
dying off, and melting away in fragrance. Outside, the village is
quiet, but within the church there is an incessant plying of fans and
rustling of dresses. The Belgraves are landed at the porch, and
Spec and Shat whirl the family carriage into the grave-yard. The
Mewkers enter with due decorum. Adolphus drops his hymn-book
into the pew in front, as he always does. The little flatulent organ
works through the voluntary. The sleek head of the Rev. Mr. Spat
is projected toward the audience out of the folds of his cambric
handkerchief; and after doing as much damage to the simple and
beautiful service as he can by reading it, flourishes through the regular
old Spatsonian sermon; its tiresome repetitions and plagiarisms,
with the same old rising and falling inflections, the same old tremulous
tone toward the end, as if he were crying; the same old recuperative
method by which he recovers his lost voice in the last
sentence, when it was all but gone; and the same old gesture by
which the audience understand that his labors (and theirs) are over
for the morning. Then the congregation departs with the usual
accompaniments of dresses rustling, and pew-doors slamming; and
Mr. Meeker descends from the choir and sidles up the aisle, nursing

<!-- page 168 -->

his knobs of elbows in his skinny fingers, and congratulates the Rev.
Mr. Spat upon the excellent discourse he had delivered, and receives
the customary <i>quid pro quo</i> in the shape of a compliment upon the
excellent singing in the choir. This account adjusted, Mr. Mewker
shuffles home beside the lovely widow; and Mrs. Mewker and the
small fry of members follow in their wake.</p>

<p>"I have looked into the records in the county clerk's office,"
Mewker says, in a whisper, to his sister, "and the property is all
right. That old Thing, (unconscious Augusta Belgrave, rolling
home behind Spec and Shat, do you hear this?) that old Thing,
and that fool of a book-worm (Adolphus) can be packed off after
the wedding, and then we can arrange matters between us. Spat
understands me in this, and intends to be hand and glove with Belgrave,
so as to work upon him. He will, he <i>must</i> do it, for he knows
that his remaining in this church depends upon me." Here Mr.
Mewker was interrupted by one of the young Mewkers, who came
running up, hat in hand. "Oh! pa, look there! see those beautiful
climbing roses growing all over that old tree!" "Jacob," said
Mewker, catching him by the hair, and rapping his head with his
bony knuckles until the tears came, "have n't I told you not to speak
of such trivial things on the Sabbath? How dare you (with a
repetition of raps) think of climbing roses so soon after church?
Go; (with a fresh clutch in the scalp of Mewker, Junior,) go to your
mother, and when I get home I will punish you." Mr. Mewker
resumed the whispered conversation. "Belgrave is ruled entirely
by his sister, but between Spat and I, she can be blinded, I think. If
she should suspect, now, she would interfere, of course, and Belgrave
would not dare to disobey her. But if we can get him committed
once in some way, he is such a coward that he would be entirely
in my power. Dear," he said aloud to Mrs. M., "how did you
like the sermon?" "Angelic," replies Mrs. Mewker. "That's my
opinion, too," responds Mewker. "Angelic, angelic. Spat is a lovely
man, my dear. What is there for dinner?"</p>

<p>If there were some feminine meter by which Harriet Lasciver's
soul could be measured, it would indicate "good" pretty high up on
the scale. Yet she had listened to this after-church discourse of her

<!-- page 169 -->

brother not only with complacency, but with a full and unequivocal
assent to all he had proposed. So she would have listened, so
assented to any thing, no matter what, proposed by him; and all
things considered, it was not surprising. Even as continued attrition
wears the angles of the flint until it is moulded into the perfect
pebble, so had her nature been moulded by her brother. He had
bullied her in her childhood and in her womanhood, except when
there was a purpose in view which he could better accomplish by
fawning; and her natural good disposition, so indurated by these
opposed modes of treatment, had become as insensible to finer emotions
as her heart was callous to its own impulses. There was one
element in his composition which at all times had cast a gloss upon
his actions. It was his piety! <span class="smcap">God</span> help us! that any one should
allude to that but with reverence and love! Nor do I here speak
of it but as a profession, an art, or specious showing forth of some
thing that is not real, but <i>professed</i>, in order to accomplish other ends.
What profited her own experience, when Harriet Lasciver was so far
imposed upon as to believe her brother's professions sincere? What
though all his life he had been a crooked contriver and plotter,
malicious in his enmity, and false in his friendship; <i>and she knew it?</i>
Yet, as she could not reconcile it with his affected sanctity, she could
not believe it. That wonderful power which men seldom, and women
never analyze&mdash;hypocrisy, held her entangled in its meshes, and she
was his instrument to be guided as he chose. Every noble trait
true woman possesses&mdash;pity, tenderness, love, and high honor&mdash;were
commanded by an influence she could not resist. Her reason,
nay, her feelings were dormant, but her faith slept securely upon
her brother's religion!</p>

<p>In this instance there was another consideration&mdash;a minor one, it
is true, but in justice to the widow, it must be added. She really
admired the Captain; but that makes no great difference. A widow
must love some body. Those delicate tendrils of affection which put
forth, with the experiences of the young wife die not in the widow,
but survive, and must have some support. Even if the object be unworthy
or unsightly, as it happens sometimes, still will they bind,
and bloom, and cling, and blossom around it, like honey-suckles
around a post.</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>The windows at the Oakery are open, and the warm air of a Sunday
summer evening pours in, as Augusta pours out the tea. The
Captain burns his mouth with the first cup, turns the tea into the saucer,
blows it to cool it, drinks it off hastily, takes a snap at the thin,
white slice of bread on his plate, takes another snap at a radish somewhat
overcharged with salt, wipes his mouth, goes to the window and
calls out "Jim!" Jim appears at the stable-door with a wisp of
straw and a curry-comb. "Put in the hosses!" Jim telegraphs with
the curry-comb, "All right, Sir!" Augusta stares at Adolphus, and
Adolphus brushes the metaphysical films from his eyes, and, for once,
seems wide awake. The Captain takes his seat and a fresh snap at
the bread. Augusta looks at him steadily. "Why, brother, where
are you going with the horses on Sunday afternoon?" The Captain
squints at the bread, and answers, "To Mewker's." "Mewker's!"
repeats Augusta; "Mewker's! why, brother, you're crazy; they
never receive company on Sunday. You know how strictly pious
Mr. Mewker is, and he would look at you with amazement. To see
you riding, too! why&mdash;I&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>The Captain, however, said nothing, but waited, with some impatience,
until Spec and Shat turned out with the carriage from the stable.
Then he took the ribbons, stopped, threw them down, went up
into the tower, came back with a clean shirt on, climbed into the seat,
and drove off.</p>

<p>"He'll come back from there in a hurry, I guess," said Augusta
to the wondering Adolphus.</p>

<p>But the Captain did not return until eleven that night, and then
somewhat elevated with wine. "Augushta," said he, as the procession
formed as usual on the stairs, "that Mucous 'sha clever feller, heesha
clever feller, heesha dev'lish clever feller; heesh fond of talking on
church matters, and sho 'mi. His shister, sheesha another clever feller,
she's a chump! I asked em to come to-morrow to tea, and
shaid they would."</p>

<p>"Why, brother, to-morrow is Monday, washing-day!" replied the
astonished spinster.</p>

<p>"Tha 's a fack, Gushta, fack," answered the Captain, as he took
the candle from his sister at the tower-door; "but, wash or no wash,

<!-- page 171 -->

musht come. When I ask 'em to come, musht come. Good
night!"</p>

<p>The bolts are closed on the several doors, scarp and counterscarp,
ditch and glacis are wrapped in slumber; but the Captain lies wide
awake, looking through the slits in the tower casement at the Great
Bear in the sky, and thinking rapturously of the lovely Lasciver.</p>

<p>Never did the old family carriage have such a polishing as on that
Monday morning. Never did Jim so bestir himself with the harness
as on that day under the eye of Belgrave. The Captain neglects to
take his accustomed ride to the village in the morning, that Spec
and Shat may be in condition for the afternoon. At last the carriage
rolls up the road from the Oakery, with Jim on the box, and the Captain
retires to dress for company. In due course the carriage returns
with Spec and Shat somewhat blown with an over-load; for all the
young Mewkers are piled up inside, on the laps of Mrs. Mewker and
the lovely Lasciver. Then Augusta hurries into the kitchen to tell
Hannah, the help, to cut more bread for the brats, and Adolphus is hurried
out into the garden to pull more radishes, and the young Mewker
tribe get into his little library, and revel in his choice books, and
quarrel over them, and scatter some leaves and covers on the floor as
trophies of the fight. Then the tea is brought on, and the lovely Lasciver
tries in vain to soften the asperity of Augusta; and then Mewker
takes her in hand, and does succeed, and in a remarkable degree,
too. Meanwhile the ciphers of the party, Mrs. Mewker and Adolphus,
drink and eat in silence. Then they adjourn to the porch, and
Mewker sits beside Augusta, and entertains her with an account of
the missions in Surinam, to which she turns an attentive ear. Then
Mrs. Mewker says it is time to go, "on account of the children," at
which Mewker darts a petrifying look at her, and turns with a smile
to Augusta, who, in the honesty of her heart, says "she, too, thinks it
is best for the young ones to go to bed early." Then Jim is summoned
from the stable, and Spec and Shat; and the Mewkers take
leave, and whirl along the road again toward home.</p>

<p>It was long before the horses returned, for Jim drove back slowly.
There was not a tenderer heart in the world than the one which beat
in the bosom of that small old boy of sixty. He sat perched upon

<!-- page 172 -->

the box, calling out, "Gently, soho!" to Spec and Shat, when they
advanced beyond a walk, and held a talk with himself in this wise:
"I do n't want to carry that old carcase agin. He gits in and praises
up the Cap'n so as <i>I</i> can hear him, and then asks me if I wo n't lay
the whip on the bosses. Says I, 'Mr. Mewker, them bosses has been
druv.' Says he, 'Yes, James, but you can give 'em a good rubbin'
down when you get to hum, and that will fetch 'em all right.' Now,
I want to know if you take a man, and lay a whip onto him, and
make him travel till he's sore, whether rubbin down is a-goin' to
make him all right? No, Sir. Then he calls me James. I do n't
want no man to call me James; my name's Jim. There was old
Midgely; he called me James; did n't he coax out of me all I'd
saved up for more 'n twenty years, and then busted? There was
Deacon Cotton; did n't he come in over the Captain with that pork?
He called me James, too. And there was that psalm-singin peddler
that got Miss Augusty to lend him the colt; he called me James. Did
he bring the colt back? No, Sir; at least not yit, and it's more 'n
three years ago. When a man calls me James, I take my eye and
places it onto him. I hearn him when he tells Miss Mewker not to
give beggars nothin'. <i>I</i> hearn him. He sez they may be impostors!
Well, 'spose they be? When a feller-creatur' gits so low as to beg,
have n't they got low enough? Aint they ragged, dirty, despised?
Do n't they run a chance of starvin', impostors or not, if every
body drives em off? And what great is it if they do get a-head of
you, for a crumb or a cent? When I see a feller-creatur in rags,
beggin, I say human natur has got low enough; it's in rags! it
begs! it's 'way down, and it do n't make much difference if it's
actin' or not. Them aint impostors that will do much harm. Them
aint impostors like old Midgely, and Deacon Cotton, and that psalm-singin
peddler that borrowed the colt; at least they do n't cut it so
fat. But 'spose they don't happin to be impostors, arter all?
Whar's that account to be squared? I guess I'd rayther be the beggar
than the other man when that account is squared. I guess when
that account is squared, it will kind a-look as if the impostor was n't
the one that asked for the stale bread, but the one that would n't give
it. Seems as if I've heard 'em tell about a similar case somewhere."</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>A good rubbing down, indeed, for Spec and Shat that night, and a
well-filled manger, too. When Jim picked up his stable-lantern, he
gave each horse a pat on the head and a parting hug, and then backed
out, with his eyes still on them. "Spec!" said he at the door. Spec
gave a whinny in reply. "Shat!" Shat responded also. "Good
night, old boys! Old Jim aint a-goin' to lay no whip onto you. If
old Jim wants to lay a whip onto something, it wo n't be onto you,
that's been spavined and had the bots, and he's cured 'em, and they
know it, hey! No, Sir. His 'tipathy works outside into another
quarter. Is my name James? Well, it aint. It's Jim, is n't it?
Yes, Sir!"</p>

<p>Old Jim's remarks being ended, and the stable-door locked,
nothing remained for him to do but to form the glacis before the
Belgrave citadel.</p>

<p>From that night, however, the halcyon days of Spec and Shat
were at an end. The Mewkers loved to ride, but they had no horses:
the only living thing standing upon four legs belonging to Mr. Mewker
was an ugly, half-starved, cross-grained, suspicious-looking dog,
that had the mange and a bad reputation. Of course, the Captain's
horses were at their service, for rides to the beach, for pic-nics in the
woods, for shopping in the village, or, perchance, to take Mr. Mewker
to some distant church-meeting. And not only were the horses
absent at unusual times; there seemed to be a growing fondness in
the Captain for late hours. The old-style regularity of the Oakery,
the time-honored habits of early hours to bed, the usual procession up
the stairs, formal but cheerful, were, in some measure, broken into;
not but what these were observed as formerly; not but what every
member of the family waited and watched until the Captain returned,
no matter how late; but that sympathetic feeling which all had felt
when the hour of bed-time came, had ceased to be, and in its place
was the dreary languor, the tiresome, tedious feeling that those experience
who sit up and wait and wait, for an absent one, waiting and
asking, "Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?" There was an increasing
presentiment, a gloomy foreshadowing of evil, in Miss Augusta's
mind at these doings of the Captain; and this feeling was heightened
by something, trifling in itself, yet still mysterious and unaccountable.

<!-- page 174 -->

Some body, almost every day, cut off a tolerably large piece from the
beef or mutton, or whatever kind of meat there chanced to be in the
cellar. And no body knew any thing about it. Hannah was fidelity
itself; Jim was beyond suspicion; Adolphus never went into the cellar,
scarcely out of the library, in fact. The Captain! could it be her
brother? Miss Augusta watched. She saw him do it. She saw him
covertly draw his jack-knife from his pocket, and purloin a piece of
beautiful rump-steak, then wrap it up in paper, put it in his pocket,
and walk off whistling, as if nothing had happened. "The widow is
at the bottom of this!" was the thought that flashed through the mind
of Augusta. She was indirectly correct. The widow was at the bottom
of the theft, and I will tell you how. I have mentioned a large,
mangy dog, of disreputable character, Mr. Mewker's property, and
"Bose" by name. Whenever the Captain drove up the path to the
house of his friend, there, beside the step of the wagon, from the time
it passed the gate until it reached the porch, was this dog, with a tail
short as pie-crust, that never wagged; thick, wicked eyes, and a face
that did not suggest fidelity and sagacity, but treachery and rapine,
dead sheep, and larceny great or small. And although the Captain
was a stout, active, well-framed man, with a rosy cheek, a bright eye,
and a sprightly head of hair, yet he was afraid of that dog. And
therefore, the Captain, to conciliate Bose, brought him every day
some choice morsel from his own kitchen; and as he did not dare
to tell Augusta, the same was abstracted in the manner already
described.</p>

<p>Here I must mention a peculiarity in Captain Belgrave's character.
He never saw a dog without thinking of hydrophobia; he never
bathed on the beautiful beach in the rear of his house without imagining
every chip in the water, or ripple on the wave, to be the dorsal
fin of some voracious shark. When he drove home at night, it was
with fear and trembling, for an assassin might be lurking in the
bushes; and if he passed a sick neighbor, he walked off with smallpox,
measles, typhoid, and whooping-cough trundling at his heels. In
a word, he was the most consummate coward in Little-Crampton. It
was for this reason he had built and slept in the tower; and what with
reading of pirates, buccaneers, Captain Kidd, and Black Beard, his

<!-- page 175 -->

mind was so infected that no sleeping-place seemed secure and safe,
but his own turret and trap-door, scarp, counterscarp, ditch, and glacis,
through which all invaders had to pass before they encountered
him with his tremendous horse-pistol.</p>

<p>It was not the discovery of the theft alone that had opened the
eyes of Augusta in regard to her brother's motions. Although he had
told her, again and again, that he merely went to Mewkers to talk
over church matters, yet she knew intuitively, as every woman would,
that a widow so lovely as Harriet Lasciver could not but have great
attractions for such an old bachelor as her brother. In fact, she
knew, if the widow, as the phrase is, "set her cap for him," the Captain
was a lost man. But to whom could she apply for counsel and
assistance? Adolphus? Adolphus had no more sense than a kitten.
Hannah? There was something of the grand old spinster-spirit
about Augusta that would not bend to the level of Hannah, the help.
Jim? She would go to Jim. She would see that small boy of sixty,
and ask his advice. And she did. She walked over to the stable
in the evening, while her brother was making his toilet for the customary
visit to the Mewkery, and, without beating around the bush
at all, reached the point at once. "Jim," said she, "the Captain is
getting too thick with the Mewkers, and we must put a stop to it.
How is that to be done?"</p>

<p>Jim paused for a moment, and then held up his forefinger. "I
know <i>one</i> way to stop him a-goin' there; and, if you say so, Miss
Augusta, then old Jim is the boy to do it."</p>

<p>Augusta assented in a grand, old, towering nod. Jim, with a mere
motion of his forefinger, seemed to reiterate, "If you say so, I'll
do it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, by Golly!" responded Jim joyfully, "arter this night
he'll never go there ag'in."</p>

<p>Augusta walked toward the house with a smile, and Jim proceeded
to embellish Shatter.</p>

<p>By-and-by the Captain drove off in the wagon, and old Jim
busied himself with Spectator, fitting a mouldy saddle on his back,
and getting him ready for action.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>There was a thin cloud, like lace, over the moon that night; just
enough to make objects painfully distinct, as Captain Belgrave turned
out from Mewker's gate, and took the high road toward home. He
jogged along, however, quite comfortably, and had just reached the
end of Mewker's fence, when he saw a figure on horseback, emerging
from the little lane that ran down behind the garden to the pond at
the back of the house. The apparition had a sort of red cape around
its shoulders; a soldier-cap, with a tall plume, (very like the one the
Captain used to wear on parade,) was upon its head; in its hand was
a long, formidable-looking staff; and the horse of the spectre was
enveloped in a white saddle-cloth, that hung down almost to the
ground. What was remarkable, Old Shatter, as if possessed with the
devil, actually drew out of the road toward the stranger, and gave a
whinny, which was instantly responded to in the most frightful tones
by the horse of the spectre. Almost paralyzed, the Captain suffered
the apparition to approach him. What a face it had! Long masses
of hair, like tow, waved around features that seemed to have neither
shape nor color. Its face seemed like a face of brown paper, so formless
and flat was it, with great hideous eyes and a mouth of intolerable
width. As it approached, the figure seemed to have a convulsion
it rolled so in the saddle; but, recovering, it drew up beside
the shaft, and, whirling its long staff, brought such a whack upon Shatter's
flank, that the old horse almost jumped out of his harness.
Away went the wagon and the Captain, and away went the spectre
close behind; fences, trees, bushes, dust, whirled in and out of sight;
bridges, sedges, trout-brooks, mills, willows, copses, plains, in moon
light and shadow, rolled on and on; but not an inch was lost or won;
there, behind the wagon, was the goblin with his long plume bending,
and waving, and dancing, and his staff whirling with terrible menaces.
On, and on, and on, and ever and anon the goblin steed gave one of
those frightful whinnies that seemed to tear the very air with its dissonance.
On, and on, and on! The Captain drove with his head turned
back over his shoulder, but Shat knew the road. On, and on, and on!
A thought flashes like inspiration through the mind of the Captain,
"The horse-pistol!" It is under the cushions. He seizes it nervously,
cocks it, and&mdash;bang! goes the plume of the goblin. "By gosh!" said

<!-- page 177 -->

a voice under the soldier-cap, "I did n't cal'late on that;" and then,
"I vum ef old Shat haint run away!" Sure enough, Shatto has run
away; the wagon is out of sight in a turn of the road; the next
instant, it brings up against a post; off goes Shat, with shafts and
dislocated fore-wheels; and old Jim soon after finds the remains of
the wagon, and the senseless body of his master, in a ditch, under
the moon, and a willow. To take the red blanket from his shoulders,
which he had worn like a Mexican poncho by putting his head through
a hole in the middle, is done in an instant; and then, with big tears
rolling down his cheeks, the old boy brings water from a spring, in
the crown of the soldier-cap, to bathe the face of the Captain. The
report of the pistol has alarmed a neighbor; and the two, with the
assistance of the hind-wheels and the body of the wagon, carry poor
Belgrave through the moon-lit streets of Little-Crampton, to the
Oakery.</p>

<p>When the Captain opened his eye, (for the other was under the
tuition of a large patch of brown paper, steeped in vinegar,) he found
himself safe at home, surrounded and fortified, as usual, by Augusta,
Adolphus, Hannah, the help, and Jim, in picturesque attitudes. How
he came there, was a mystery. Stay; he begins to take up the
thread: Mewkers, fence, the figure, the race for life, and the pistol!
What else? Nothing&mdash;blank&mdash;oblivion. So he falls into a tranquil
state of comfort, and feels that he does not care about it. No getting
up that steep ladder to-night! Never mind. It is a labor to think,
so he relapses into thoughtlessness, and finally falls asleep. There
was a stranger in the room behind the bed's head, a tall, astringent-looking
man, Dr. Butternuts, by whom the Captain had been let
blood. If Belgrave had seen him, he would have fainted. "No injuries
of any consequence," says the doctor, departing and waving his
brown hand. "Terribly skart, though," Augusta responds in a whisper.
"Yes, he will get over that; to-morrow he will be better;"
and the doctor waves himself out. Adolphus retires, and then Hannah,
the help; but Augusta and Jim watch by the bedside until
morning. The Captain, every now and then, among the snowy sheets
and coverlet, turns up a side of face that looks like a large, purple
egg-plant, at which Jim sighs heavily; but Augusta whispers soothingly,

<!-- page 178 -->

"Never mind, Jim, it's for his good; I'm glad you skart
him; you skart him a leetle too much this time, that's all; next time
you'll be more careful, wo n't you, and not skear him so bad?"</p>

<p>That Captain Belgrave had been thrown from his wagon, and
badly hurt, was known all over Little-Crampton, next morning.
Some said he had been shot at by a highwayman; some, he had shot
at a highwayman. The story took a hundred shapes, and finally was
rolled up at the door of the Rev. Melchior Spat, who at once took
his wagon, and drove off to the Mewkery. There the rumor was
unfolded to Mr. Mewker, who, enjoying it immensely, made so many
funny remarks thereon, that the Rev. Melchior Spat was convulsed
with laughter, and then the two drove down to the Oakery to condole
with the sufferer. On the way there, the Rev. Melchior was so wonderfully
facetious, that Mewker, who never enjoyed any person's
jokes but his own, was actually stimulated into mirth, and had it not
been for happily catching a distant sight of the tower, would have so
forgotten himself as to drive up to the door with a pleasant expression
of countenance. As it was, they both entered grave as owls, and
inquired, in faint and broken voices, how the Captain was, and whether
he was able to see friends. Augusta, who received them, led
them up to the room, where the Captain, with his face like the globe
in the equinox, sitting propped up in bed, shook both feebly by the
hands, and then the Rev. Melchior proposed prayer, to which Mewker
promptly responded by dropping on his knees, and burying his
face in the bottom of an easy chair. This was a signal for Adolphus
to do likewise; and the Captain, not to be behind, struggling up into a
sitting posture, leaned forward in the middle of the coverlet, with his
toes and the end of his shirt deployed upon the pillows. Then the
Rev. Melchior, in a crying voice, proceeded according to the hom&oelig;opathic
practice&mdash;that is, making it short and sweet as possible&mdash;touching
upon the excellent qualities of the sufferer, the distress of
his beloved friends, and especially of the anxiety which would be
awakened in the bosom of one now absent, "whose heart was only the
heart of a woman, a heart not strong and able to bear up against
calamity, but weak, and fragile, and loving, and pitiful, and tender;
a heart that was so weak, and loving, and pitiful, and tender, and

<!-- page 179 -->

fragile, that it could not bear up against calamity; no, it could not;
no, it could not; it was weak, it was pitiful, it was loving, it was tender,
it was fragile like a flower, and against calamity it could not
bear up."</p>

<p>So great was the effect of the Rev. Melchior Spat's eloquence, that
the Captain fairly cried, so as to leave a round wet spot in the middle
of the coverlet, and Mr. Mewker wiped his eyes frequently with his
handkerchief, as he rose from the chair. And although the voice of
the Reverend Melchior had been heard distinctly, word for word, by
Jim, in the far-off stable, yet it sank to the faintest whisper when he
proceeded to inquire of the Captain how he felt, and what was this
dreadful story. And then the Captain, in a voice still fainter, told
how he was attacked by a man of immense size, mounted on a horse
of proportionate dimensions, and how he had defended himself, and
did battle bravely until, in the fight, "Shatto got skeared, and overset
the wagon, and then the man got onto him, and pounded the life out
of him, while he was entangled with reins." Then Mr. Mewker and
the Rev. Mr. Spat took leave with sorrowful faces, and as they drove
home again, renewed the jocularity which had been interrupted some
what by the visit to the Oakery.</p>

<p>To say that Mr. Mewker neglected his friend, the Captain, during
his misfortunes, would be doing a great injustice to that excellent
man. Every day he was at the Oakery, to inquire after his health;
and rarely did he come without some little present, a pot of sweet-meats,
a bouquet, or something of the kind, from the lovely Lasciver.
How good it was of him to buy jelly at two shillings a pound at the
store, and bring it to the Captain, saying, "This little offering is from
Harriet, who thought some delicacy of the kind would be good for
you." Was it not disinterested? Hiding his own modest virtues in
a pot of jelly, and presenting it in the name of another! The truth
is, Mewker's superior tactics were too profound for Augusta to contend
against; she felt, as it were, the sand sliding from under her
feet. Nor was Mewker without a powerful auxiliary in the Reverend
Melchior Spat, who, by his prerogative, had free access to the house
at all times, and made the most of it, too. Skillfully turning to common
topics when Augusta was present, and as skillfully returning to

<!-- page 180 -->

the old subject when she retired, he animated the Captain with such
desire for the lovely widow, that, had it not been for his black eye, he
would assuredly have gone off and proposed on the spot. This feeling,
however, subsided when the Rev. Melchior was gone; the Captain
did not think of marrying; he was a true old bachelor, contented
with his lot, and not disposed to change it even for a better; beside,
he was timid.</p>

<p>At last our hero was able once more to go about, and Jim drove
him down slowly to the Mewkery. Such a noise as Bose made when
he saw the carriage approaching! But there was no present from the
hand of his friend this time; so Bose contented himself with growling
and snapping angrily at his own tail, which was not longer than half a
cucumber. What a blush spread over the face of the Captain when
he saw the widow, all dimples and dimity, advancing to meet him in
the familiar back-parlor! How the sweet roses breathed through the
shaded blinds as he breathed out his thanks to the widow for many
precious favors during his confinement. They were alone; the Captain
sat beside her on the sofa; one of her round, plump, white, dimpled
hands was not far from him, resting upon the black hair-cloth of
the sofa bottom. He looked right and left; there was no one near;
so he took the hand respectfully, and raised it to his lips, intending to
replace it, of course. To his dismay, she uttered a tender "O!" and
leaned her head upon his shoulder. What to do, he did not know;
but he put his arm around her bewitching waist, to support her. Her
eyes were closed, and the long, radiant lashes heightened, by contrast,
the delicious color that bloomed in her cheeks. The Captain looked
right and left again; no one was near; if he could venture to kiss
her! He had never kissed a pretty woman in all his life! The
desire to do so increased; it seemed to grow upon him, in fact;
drawn toward her by an influence he could not resist, he leaned
over and touched those beautiful lips, and then&mdash;in walked Mr.
Mewker.</p>

<p>Had Mewker not been a genius, he might have compromised
every thing by still playing the humble, deferential, conscientious
part; but hypocrisy on a low key was not his cue now; he knew his
man too well for that, and besides, familiar as this branch of art had

<!-- page 181 -->

been, there was another still more natural to him; he was wonderful
in the sycophant, but matchless in the bully! Those little, weak,
bladdery eyes seemed almost to distil venom, as wrapping his knobby
arms in a knot, he strode up to the astonished Belgrave, and asked him
"how he dared invade the privacy of his house, the home of his wife
and children, and the sanctuary of his sister? How he dared trespass
upon the hospitality that had been extended toward, nay, that had
been lavished upon him? Was not the respectability of the Mewker
family, a family related to the wealthy Balgangles of Little-Crampton,
and connected by marriage with the Shellbarques of Boston, a
sufficient protection against his nefarious designs? And did he undertake,
under the mask of friendship," and Mewker drew up his fore
head into a complication of lines like an indignant web, "to come,
as a hypocrite, a member of the church (O Mewker!) with the
covert intention of destroying the peace and happiness of his only
sister?"</p>

<p>Belgrave was a man who never swore; but on this occasion he
uttered an exclamation: "My grief!" said he, "I never had no such
idee."</p>

<p>"What, then, are your intentions?" said Mewker, fiercely.</p>

<p>"T' make it all straight," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Belgrave paused, and Mewker shuffled rapidly to and fro, muttering
to himself. At last he broke out again:</p>

<p>"How, I say?"</p>

<p>"On that p'int I 'm codjitatin'."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;you&mdash;mean&mdash;" said Mewker, with a remarkable smile,
placing his hand calmly on the Captain's shoulder, "to trifle
with me?"</p>

<p>"No," replied poor Belgrave, surrendering up, as it were, what
was left of him; "I 'm ready to be married, if that will make it all
straight, provided," he added with natural courtesy, turning to the
lovely widow, "provided this lady does not think me unworthy of
her."</p>

<p>Mewker drew forth a tolerably clean handkerchief, and applied it
to his eyes: a white handkerchief held to the eyes of a figure in

<!-- page 182 -->

threadbare black is very effective. The lovely Lasciver remained
entirely passive; such is discipline.</p>

<p>Here, at last, was an opportunity to beat a retreat. The Captain
rose, and shaking Mewker's unemployed hand, which, he said after
ward, "felt like a bunch of radishes," left the room without so much
as a word to the future Mrs. Belgrave. So soon as the door closed
upon him, Mr. Mewker raised his eyes from the handkerchief, and
smiled sweetly upon his sister. The thing is accomplished.</p>

<p>As some old bear, who had enjoyed freedom from cubhood, feels,
at the bottom of a pit dug by the skillful hunter, so feels Captain Belgrave,
as he rides home sorrowfully. His citadel, after all, is not a
protection. Into its penetralia a subtle spirit has at last found
entrance. The air grows closer and heavier around him, the shadows
broader, the bridges less secure, the trout-brooks blacker and deeper.
How shall he break the matter to Augusta? "No hurry, though;
the <i>day</i> has n't been app'inted yit;" and at this suggestion the clouds
begin to break and lighten. Then he sees Mewker, threadbare and
vindictive; his sky again is overcast, but filaments of light stream
through as he conjures up the image of the lovely widow, the dimpled
hand, the closed eyes, the long radiate lashes, cheeks, lips, and the
temptation which had so unexpected a conclusion. Home at last;
and, with some complaint of fatigue, the Captain retires to his high
tower to ruminate over the past and the future.</p>

<p>The future! yes, the future! A long perspective stretched before
his eyes; and, at the end of the vista, was a bride in white, and a
wedding. It would take some months to gradually break the subject
to his sister. Then temperately and moderately, the courtship would
go on, year by year, waxing by degrees to the end.</p>

<p>Mr. Mewker altered the focus of Belgrave's optics next morning,
by a short note, in which he himself fixed the wedding-day at two weeks
from the Captain's declarations of intentions. This intelligence confined
the Captain two days in the tower, "codjitating," during which time
every body in Little-Crampton was informed that Widow Lasciver
and he were engaged to be married. The news came from the best
authority&mdash;the Rev. Melchior Spat. On the evening of the second
day, a pair of lead-colored stockings, a fustian petticoat, a drab short-gown,

<!-- page 183 -->

and a bright bunch of keys, descended the steep step-ladder
from the trap in the tower, and walked into the room adjoining.
Then two hands commenced wringing themselves, by which we may
understand that Augusta was in great tribulation. The rumor, rife in
Little-Crampton, had reached her ears, and her brother had confirmed
its truth. The very means employed to keep him out of danger had
only assisted the other party to carry him off. This should be a
warning to those who interfere with affairs of the heart. But what
was her own future? Certainly her reign was at an end; a new
queen-bee was to take possession of the hive; and then&mdash;what then?
kings and kaisers, even, are not free from the exquisite anguish
which, in that hour, oppressed the heart of Augusta Belgrave. It was
but a step; but what a step? from mistress to menial, from ruler to
subordinate. She knelt down heavily by the bedside, and there
prayed; but&mdash;oh! the goodness of woman's heart!&mdash;it was a prayer,
earnest, sincere, truthful, and humble; not for herself, but for her
brothers. Then her heart was lightened and strengthened; and as she
rose, she smiled with a bitter sweetness, that, considering every thing,
was beautiful.</p>

<p>Great preparations now in Little-Crampton for the wedding. Invitations
were out, and needles, scissors, flowers, laces, ribbons, and
mantua-makers at a premium. The Captain took heart of grace, and
called upon his lovely bride, but always managed to get past <i>that
lane</i> before night-fall. Hood &amp; Wessup, the fashionable tailors of
Little-Crampton, were suborned to lay themselves out night and day
upon his wedding-suit. He had set his heart upon having Adolphus
dressed precisely like himself on the occasion. Two brothers
dressed alike, groom and groomsman, look remarkably well at a
wedding. But to his surprise, Adolphus refused to be dressed, and
would not go to the wedding&mdash;"<i>positively</i>." Neither would Augusta.
Brother and sister set to work packing up, and when the expected
night arrived there was all their little stock in two, blue, wooden
trunks, locked, and corded, and ready for moving, in the hall of the
Oakery.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy night outside and in, for the rain had been falling
all day, and a cold rain-storm in summer is dreary enough. But

<!-- page 184 -->

cheerful bars of light streamed across the darkness from the tower
windows, lighting up a green strip on a tree here and there, a picket
or two in the fence, and banding with an illuminated ribbon the side
and roof of the dripping barn. The Captain was making his toilet.
White ruffled shirt, with a black mourning pin containing a lock of
his mother's hair; white marseilles waistcoat, set off with an inner
vest of blue satin, (suggested by Hood &amp; Wessup;) trowsers of
bright mustard color, fitting as tight as if his legs had been melted
and poured into them; blue coat, cut brass buttons, end of handkercher'
sticking out of the pocket behind; black silk stockings and
pumps; red check-silk neck-cloth, and flying-jib collars. Down he
came, and there sat brother and sister on their corded trunks in the
hall, portentous as the Egyptian statues that overlook the Nile from
their high stone chairs. Not a word was said; but the Captain
opened the door and looked out. "Why, it rains like fury. Jim!"</p>

<p>Jim, who was unseen in the darkness, and yet within three feet
of the door, answered cheerily, "Aye, aye, Sir!"</p>

<p>"All ready, Jim?"</p>

<p>"All ready, Capt'in."</p>

<p>"Wait till I get my cloak;" and as the Captain wrapped himself
up, his sister silently and carefully assisted him; not on account
of his plumage, but to keep him from catching cold.</p>

<p>Off goes Shatter, Jim, and the Captain; off through the whistling
rain and the darkness. The mud whirled up from the wheels and
covered the cloak of the bridegroom, so he told Jim "to drive keerful,
as he wanted to keep nice." It was a long and dreary road, but
at last they saw the bright lights from Mewker's windows, and with
a palpitating heart the Captain alighted at the porch.</p>

<p>Old Bose, who had been scouring the grounds and barking at
every guest, started up with a fearful growl, but the Captain threw
off his travel-stained cloak, and exhibited himself to the old dog in
all his glory. The instant Bose recognized his friend and benefactor
he leaped upon him with such a multitude of caresses that the white
marseilles vest and mustard-colored trowsers were covered with
proofs of his fidelity and attachment, "Hey, there! hey! down,
Bose!" said Mewker at the door: "Why, my dear brother!"</p>

<!-- page 185 -->

<p>The Captain, with great gravity, was snapping with his thumb and
finger the superfluous mud with which Bose had embellished his
trowsers.</p>

<p>"Come in here," said Mewker, chuckling and scratching his chin.
"I'll get you a brush. No hurry. Time enough before the ceremony."</p>

<p>The Captain walked after him through the hall, and caught a
glimpse of the parlors, radiant with wax-lights, and crowded with
such a display of company as was rarely seen in Little-Crampton.</p>

<p>"Come in here," said Mewker, still chuckling, as he opened the
door. "This is your room;" and he winked, and gave the bride
groom such a nudge with his knobby elbow as almost tumbled him
over the bed. "Your room&mdash;understand? <i>The bridal-chamber!</i>
Wait here, now; wait here till I get a brush."</p>

The Captain, left alone, surveyed the apartment. The pillow-cases
were heavy with lace. Little tasteful vases filled with flowers,
made the air drunk with fragrance; a white, worked pin-cushion was
on the bureau, before an oval glass, with his own name wrought thereon
in pin's heads. The astral lamp on the mantel shed a subdued and
chastened light over the whole. Long windows reached to the floor,
and opened on the piazza; light Venitian blinds were outside the
sashes, without other fastenings that a latch. The Captain tried the
windows, and they opened with a touch of his thumb and fore-finger.
He had not slept in so insecure a place for more than twenty years.
Then he thought of the phantom horseman, and the deep pond behind
the house. He shivered a little, either from cold or timidity. The
window was partially raised, so he throws it up softly, touches the
latch; the blinds are open; he walks out on the piazza, and then
covertly steals around to the front of the house, where he finds
Shatter and the wagon, with old Jim peering through the blinds to
see the wedding come off.</p>

<p>"Jim," he says, in a hoarse whisper, "take me hum. I aint a-goin'
to sleep in such a room as that, no how."</p>

<p>The old boy quietly unbuckled the hitching-strap, and when
Mewker got back with the brush, Shatter was flying through the mud
toward the Oakery, at a three-minute gait. Two or three quick

<!-- page 186 -->

knocks at his own door, and it is opened by Augusta, who, with her
brother, had kept watch and ward on their corded trunks. The Captain
took the candle from the table, without saying a word, ascended
the stairs, passed through scarp, counterscarp, glacis, and ditch,
mounted his ladder, drew it up after him bolted the trap in the
floor, and cocked his pistol.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "let 'em come on! They 'aint got me married
this time any how!"</p>

<p>How precious a boon is memory; how prolific of disquisition in
the writings of the psychologist; how rich in associations when
treated by the poet; how full of pleasures and of pains in him who
has cherished this function of the mind by a proper observance of the
laws of organic health, without which soundness of intellect is impaired,
and our mental impressions resolved in a state of cloudiness,
or lost in oblivion. As this great quality of the mind furnishes our
most accurate knowledge; as by it we retain our power of recalling
the various and numerous incidents of by-gone days, it summons
our associations, as the occasion may demand, and yields gratification
or suffering, according as life has been appropriated in furtherance of
the proper destiny of our race. As retrospective reflections possess
within themselves a permanence of impression denied to prospective
views, and as time seems gradually to absorb the intensity of painful
associations, the poet Rogers inculcates the belief, that as we advance
in existence, past associations become less and less blended with
sorrows, and unmixed gratification crowns the issue. It were well,
indeed, could we be entirely confident of the truth of this theory of
the mind. We must, however, leave it to the school-men to descant
on, and to old heads to enjoy the fruition.</p>

<p>He who has passed a period of some three-score years and
upward, some faithful Knickerbocker, for instance, native born, and
ever a resident among us, whose tenacious memory enables him to
meditate upon the thirty thousand inhabitants at the time of his birth
with the almost oppressive population of some seven hundred thousand
which the city at present contains; who contrasts the cheap and

<!-- page 190 -->

humble dwellings of that earlier date with the costly and magnificent
edifices which now beautify the metropolis; who studies the sluggish
state of the mechanic arts at the dawn of the Republic, and the
mighty demonstrations of skill which our Fulton, and our Stevens,
our Douglass, our Hoe, our Morse, have produced; who remembers
the few and humble water-craft conveyances of days past, and now
beholds the majestic leviathans of the ocean which crowd our harbors;
who contemplates the partial and trifling commercial transactions
of the Confederacy with the countless millions of commercial
business which engross the people of the present day in our Union;
who estimates the offspring of the press, and the achievements of the
telegraph; he who has been the spectator of all this may be justly
said to have lived the period of many generations, and to have stored
within his reminiscences the progress of an era the most remarkable
in the history of his species.</p>

<p>If he awakens his attention to a consideration of the progress of
intellectual and ethical pursuits, if he advert to the prolific demonstrations
which surround him for the advancement of knowledge,
literary and scientific, moral and religious, the indomitable spirit
of the times strikes him with more than logical conviction. The
beneficence and humanity of his countrymen may be pointed out by
contemplating her noble free schools, her vast hospitals and asylums
for the alleviation of physical distress and mental infirmities; with
the reflection that all these are the triumphs of a self-governed people,
accomplished within the limited memory of an ordinary life. Should
reading enlarge the scope of his knowledge, let him study the times
of the old Dutch governors, when the Ogdens erected the first church
in the fort of New-Amsterdam, in 1642, and then survey the vast
panoramic view around him of the two hundred and fifty and more
edifices now consecrated to the solemnities of religious devotion. It
imparts gratification to know that the old Bible which was used in
that primary church of Van Twiller is still preserved by a descendant
of the builder, a precious relic of the property of the older
period, and of the devotional impulse of those early progenitors.*

<!-- page 191 -->

To crown the whole, time in its course has recognized the supremacy
of political and religious toleration, and established constitutional
freedom on the basis of equal rights and even and exact justice to all
men. That New-York has given her full measure of toil, expenditure,
and talent in furtherance of these vast results, by her patriots and
statesmen, is proclaimed in grateful accents by the myriad voice of
the nation at large.</p>

<p class="small">[*The Bible, that is, the Holy Scriptures contained in the Old and New Testaments. Quarto.
Imprinted at London, by Robert Barker, Printer to the King, 1615, followed by Sternhold &amp;
Hopkins' Psalms. This volume is now in the possession of Dr. Ogden, of New-York.]</p>

<p>But however gratifying to national feeling our cogitations on
themes of this nature might prove, they fall not within the scope
of our present intentions. A special and much more definite object
on this occasion is a reference to individuality. While we ponder at
our leisure on those great issues already hinted at, we feel that
specific justice has not been awarded to individual merit; and that in
our general glorification of acts and principles, we have proved
laggard in our encomiums on the authors and the actors of the very
deeds which invoke our panegyric. The most amiable tendency of
the human heart is the intrinsic appreciation of the noble spirits of
a land, whose services have conferred benefits of wide and lasting
duration; wisdom no less than gratitude cherishes their memories,
and the example of their life is the most powerful stimulus to future
efforts on the part of their successors. A people who cherish this
reverence must naturally possess that delicious frame of mind whose
most effective powers are manifested in the results of a philanthropic
spirit, and whose joys are most in harmony with the diviner essence
of our nature.</p>

<p>Duly to estimate the career of duty, which has marked the lives
of the men who thus by individual or confederated toil reared up the
nation to a commanding and an exemplary attitude, it becomes obligatory
on us to scrutinize in distinctive cases the circumstances which
checked or advanced their praiseworthy impulses for the public weal.
It is only by such investigations and inquiries that we become proper
umpires of their merits, can truthfully award the just meed of praise,
or hold in reverence their claims to regard. As at the juridical
tribunal circumstantial evidence is demanded, in order to arrive at a
proper conclusion and pronounce an honest verdict in the premises,
so in the various occupations and transactions of men, we associate the

<!-- page 192 -->

immediate and contingent relationship of affairs in order to arrive at
just conclusions.</p>

<p>A striking example to illustrate this opinion of life and its attendant
struggles is to be found in the auto-biography of Franklin. His
honest chronicle of all his thoughts and doings enables us to
recognize his extraordinary intellect, and his mighty services for the
age in which he flourished and for all posterity, with a truthfulness
we could never otherwise have obtained; and his renown is only rendered
more enduring when we contemplate the extremes of his existence&mdash;the
destitute journeyman printer, and the noble statesman and
philosopher: the self-taught sage is vested with still brighter renown
when we find him at one time at the compositor's case, and, after successive
changes, in the parliamentary arena, convicting the haughty
Wedderburn of ignorance and insolence, to the admiration of a whole
senate, and the approval of a Burke and a Priestley. He betrayed
the lofty aspiration of his nature, when, even a stripling in years, he
was solicitous of being introduced to Sir Isaac Newton, the philosopher
whose glories his own were destined afterward to outshine.
The cognomen of the penniless youth became a national name&mdash;the
appellation of the land of his birth&mdash;and American citizen, and a
countryman of Franklin, were synonymous terms.</p>

<p>Like remarks, and of a like tendency might be made in the case
of Fulton. The extraordinary trials of his early life, the provocations
he endured for years in his investigations and experimental
essays, ere he accomplished navigation by steam, endear the man to
us in a ten-fold view. I had the honor of a personal acquaintance
with him. His liberal nature, his frank utterance, his chivalric bearing,
all pronounced him one of Nature's noblest gifts. Neither the
jeers of the vulgar nor the scoffs of the sciolist ever disturbed his
equanimity or lessened the confidence he cherished in the ultimate
results of his bold project. After his successful toils on the Hudson,
it was affirmed it would be impossible to navigate in the East River,
or cross the ferry to Brooklyn, because of the force of the currents.
The folly of the declaration was soon demonstrated, and his floating
dock, the subject of laughter by the unwise, completed the work he
had long cogitated. When, soon after it was ascertained that this last

<!-- page 193 -->

labor of his had been adopted at Liverpool, and elsewhere abroad,
the skeptics disappeared. European approval had been secured, and
his sagacity and talent proclaimed even in the plaudits of his own
countrymen. But this was at a time when an American printed
book sold best with the imprint of&mdash;London: John Jones, Piccadilly.</p>

<p>If we view the early life of Fulton, and hold in memory his
achievements&mdash;at first the humble watch-maker, and finally the man
who, by his individual prowess, changed the relationships of remotest
people, and brought the old and the new worlds as neighbors
together; who, with pecuniary resources as nothing, save in the
liberality of Chancellor Livingston, has established the comity of
nations, and effected an annual profit to his country of more than one
hundred millions of dollars, our estimate of his brilliant career
becomes higher and higher by a proper study of his biography.
Colden has given his interesting story, and Tuckerman, in his American
Portraits, has drawn him to the life.</p>

<p>Another instance may be cited of profitable influence, in the case
of De Witt Clinton. We need not advert to the early portions of
his career. He was always a student, and it is sufficiently known to
all that he identified himself with the great interests of public education
and humanity. He was a naturalist of no mean pretensions, and
mineralogy, geology, and botany were the pursuits of his pastime.
To judge of his merits in the organization of the canal policy of the
State of New-York, it behooves the inquirer after truth to become
acquainted with the financial career and condition of the State, the
history of its political leaders and factions, the force of public opinion,
the persecuting vindictiveness of party strife, and the poison of a
hireling press. No measure of such magnitude as the Erie and Hudson
Canal was ever accomplished under such disheartening embarrassments.
In the great city most to be benefited by its completion the
opposition to it was strongest; and many of those who cherished
feelings favorable to the undertaking were luke-warm in the project:
the river counties were to be ruined by it, and a general bankruptcy
of the State was to follow. It was affirmed that it was premature to
be involved in such a mighty if not preposterous work. Clinton had
early written to Jefferson on the subject, and pointed out the practicability

<!-- page 194 -->

and advantages of the design. Mr. Jefferson writes in answer
that he thinks the time for such a vast work too early by a century.
Upon its completion, Clinton informs him that all doubts of the practicability
of the measure must now cease. Jefferson, in reply, congratulates him,
and adds, in substance, "My opinion only shows that I
have lived one hundred years too soon." The indomitable mind of
Clinton rose superior to all obstacles. Under the guidance of his
counsels, and his inflexible perseverance, the mighty undertaking was
brought to a successful issue. His eulogist, Charles King, thus eloquently
speaks of him: "In the great work of internal improvement
he persevered through good report and through evil report with a
steadiness of purpose that no obstacle could divert; and when all the
elements were in commotion against him, and even his chosen associates
were appalled, he alone, like Columbus on the wide waste of
waters, in his frail bark, with a disheartened and unbelieving crew,
remained firm, self-possessed, and unshaken."</p>

<p>The distinctive merits of individuals, such, for example, as those
we have now mentioned, whose renown must endure for ages, are only
to be fittingly awarded by thoroughly understanding the circumstances
inherent in their very position of life, their <i>habitat</i>, so to speak,
in the language of botany, when discoursing on the properties of
plants. This rule observed, how pre&euml;minently do they increase in
our estimate of their virtues, emphatic as their works proclaim their
noble powers! Were the writers of American biography more
attentive to considerations of this kind; were we furnished with more
of what is termed <i>ana</i>, in the sketches and accounts of our illustrious
men; were the novelty of situation, the condition of a new people, and
that pioneer effort, so arduous, yet so inseparable from our country,
dwelt upon, we would love with a greater devotion the character of
the men who wrought for us such blessings, while our patriotism for
the land of our birth, and the heritage bequeathed us, would be
cherished with a loftier estimate of their intellectual worth.</p>

<p>A glance at the advanced state of education at the present time,
compared with that of a former period, when instruction in the new
republic was sparsely provided, when competent teachers were rarely
found, and school discipline depended upon the arbitrary decision of a

<!-- page 195 -->

vain-glorious and ignorant pedagogue, would lessen our surprise that
so few well-armed scholars have been reared among us. But even
this state of education has not wholly suppressed the reputation we
may claim for distinguished examples of scholarship. In these days,
of more critical acumen, the science of mind seems better comprehended,
and studies apter for diversities of intellect, are selected with
better judgment and urged with greater fidelity. I tax memory for
a case in point under the older <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. I was a youngster at the
same school in New-York with Washington Irving. Every thing, I
believe, was professed to be taught by the Principal. I remember
how rigid was his law in enforcing public speaking; every scholar
was assuredly to be made a Cicero. The selections assigned to
each speaker were according to the master's deeper knowledge of
the temperament and physical qualities of the scholar. "Pity the
sorrows of a poor old man!" was given me. To young Irving, who
had the advantage of more years, capacity, and strength, was assigned
the heroic speech, "My voice is still for war." That my own exhibition
was a sorry affair may be readily admitted; but what are we to
think of the sedate, the peaceful and benignant Irving, whose bellicose
propensities have never yet been developed, and whose organ of combativeness
no phrenologist has yet discovered, selected to appear
before a large assemblage to display the heroic impulses of a son of
Mars! Time, however, has proved the futility of the instruction and
the folly of the instructor; and Mr. Irving, while he smiles in secret
at the discipline of his school-boy days, may rest satisfied that he
wears a chaplet of greater lustre and more lasting glory than ever
adorned the warrior's brow.</p>

<p>Life, physical and mental, is the result of association; we are
portions of all around us. The harmony of the physiological
organization preserves the one; the intellectual stores received by
perception sustain the other. By association, the cerebral faculties
become more capacious and of wider grasp, and judgment enlarges
her sphere and acts with greater wisdom and justice. I would
that truths founded on such a basis were more generally recognized,
and that opinions and decisions were made on such organic
principles. Association, not segregation, is the ladder we ascend, the

<!-- page 196 -->

better to have a true view of what we take cognizance of. The rule
applies equally to things, to acts, and to individuals. I know my
man, I make a right estimate, when I comprehend not merely what
he accomplished, but the circumstances in which he moved and acted,
the obstacles overcome, the incidents which favored his designs.
Every body knows that there never flourished, within our precincts,
a more beautiful wood than that which ornamented Hoboken and
Weehawken. It has been famous in prose and in song; but when
we are told that within that forest, in its best estate, Kalm, the botanist
of Abo, enriched the species plantarum of Lann&aelig;us: that here the
enthusiastic Masson discovered new plants of interesting character and
properties; that Volney here at times luxuriated while in philosophical
contemplation; that here, amidst these beautiful and majestic
trees, Michaux the younger composed some portions of his American
Flora; that Pursh added to his great botanical treasures from these
woods, as did also the unfortunate Douglass; that in these walks
Irving and Paulding and Verplanck, in their earlier days, cherished
those sympathies with nature which give vitality to their descriptive
powers; that here the ornithologist, Wilson, and his successor, Audubon,
passed many of the choicest hours of their pilgrimage of life;
that here Cooke, the tragedian, after undue excitement, found alleviation
of sorrow, and Matthews, the comedian, a solace for grievous
melancholy; that the soil of Hoboken yielded to Bruce the magnesian
lime-stone, a product most precious in a mineralogical cabinet; that
here the elder Stevens made experiments, the first in either hemisphere,
in demonstration of the practicability of railroad communication;
and more, when we find that our congenial Halleck has
enlisted his poetic gifts in laudation of this captivating spot, our
gratification swells, every tree seems clothed with richer verdure, and
becomes sacred to our feelings. I walk through these shady groves
with emotions enhanced an hundred-fold by such associations, and
consider how many rich minds have surveyed them, and what treasures
they have yielded to the philosophical and rational pursuits of
the disciples of knowledge.</p>

<p>But, passing from these general reflections on the prolific subject
of the acquisition of knowledge under extreme difficulties, and the

<!-- page 197 -->

accomplishment of great deeds under adverse circumstances, I hasten
to notice, though briefly, an individual who long bore a conspicuous
part in the affairs of our active population, and whose life and
trials may be set forth as an instructive instance of personal warfare
against conflicting elements. I allude to

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Christopher Colles</span>.</p>

<p>There must still be among us some few old Knickerbockers, whose
recollections of some thirty-five years ago may bring him before them.
The young men of the present day may have heard their fathers talk
of the little weather-beaten old man, small in stature, and attenuated
in frame, of weight some one hundred and ten pounds avoirdupois, who
existed by his telegraph on the Government-House at the Bowling-Green,
and his telescope in the Park.</p>

<p>Colles was by birth an Irishman, and, losing his parents when
quite young, accident placed him under the care of the renowned Richard
Pococke, the oriental traveller, and afterward Bishop of Ossory.
The pursuits of Pococke led the mind of his adopted student to physical
investigation, and, it would appear, that to considerable attainments
in languages he added a fair acquaintance with mathematics,
mineralogy, climate, antiquities, and geographical science. Shortly
after the death of his patron, in 1765, inspired with the travelling propensities
of his instructor, he set out a wanderer from his native land,
and we find him about the year 1772 engaged here in delivering a
series of lectures on the subject of lock navigation. He was the first
person who suggested canals, and improvements on the Ontario route.
In November, 1784, according to the records of the Assembly, he presented
a memorial on the subject, and, in April following, a favorable
report was had thereon. Colles visited the country, and took an
actual survey of the principal obstructions upon the Mohawk river as
far as Wood Creek. He published the results of his tour in a pamphlet
from the press of S. Loudon. 1785. "The amazing extent of the
five great lakes," says Colles, "to which the proposed navigation will
communicate, will be found to have five times as much coast as all
England: and the countries watered by the numerous rivers which

<!-- page 198 -->

fall into these lakes, full seven or eight times as great as that valuable
island."</p>

<p>In an article on the "Water Chronology of the City of New-York,"
published in that valuable repository, the Corporation Manual
of Mr. Valentine for 1854, the services of Mr. Colles are duly noticed
by the writer, Theodore R. De Forest. Colles, in 1774, proposed the
construction of a reservoir and other works, between Pearl and White
streets, in this city, and to answer that end, the expense was to be
defrayed by issuing redeemable paper money. The war of the revolution
arrested the undertaking, yet in 1778 the people petitioned that
Colles plan might be carried out. In 1797, we find his name among
the applicants for a contract to convey water through the city by
means of pipes. This was about the time that Dr. Brown associated
himself with the Manhattan Company, in order to procure for the city
a proper supply of pure and wholesome water. Dr. Brown recommended
to the Common Council the Bronx river for that purpose;
and this, it is affirmed, is the first indication on record that a supply
from without the city was to be looked for. I believe that Colles
made the original suggestion to Brown.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of a Knickerbocker friend, G. B. Rapelye, I
have before me an elaborate pamphlet written by Colles, and published
in New-York in 1808, on the interests of the United States of
America, extending to all conditions of men, by means of inland
navigable communications. He calls his plan, the Timber Canal, readier
and more feasible to make, and far cheaper. These several tracts
show the devotion and abilities of Colles, at a time when, in our country,
few indeed were qualified to enter as competitors in his design.</p>

<p>These several projects of public improvement gave to Colles occupation
congenial to his habits of study, though they resulted in but
trifling pecuniary returns. His modesty and unassuming character
were little calculated to force him within the channels of profitable
occupation; yet he filled up what leisure he had with mathematics,
hydraulics, and kindred studies. He was among the first,
if not the very first individual who commenced itinerant public
instruction. He practised land-surveying, and taught it in lectures in
different parts of this State and elsewhere. He lectured on electricity,

<!-- page 199 -->

though I do not know that, like Franklin, he made his own
electrical machine, in this city.* Mineralogy and manures, mesmerism
and mathematics were also topics of his public discourses. The expositions
of the orrery of Rittenhouse doubtless often aided to enlarge
his audiences in those days. My old friend, President King, might
have said more of him in his Memoir on the Croton Aqueduct.</p>

<p class="small">[*Colden Correspondence, when I examined it in 1810.]</p>

<p>As there were periods when he could not study, and hours when
he could not lecture, the propensities of his old master roused him to
new efforts as a traveller. He wandered through divers parts of
Pennsylvania and this State, until he, by personal examinations and
calculations, prepared a Book of Roads for New-York, which he published
in 1789. I never heard from his lips any lamentations on his
travels, or his gastric sufferings, such as old Mrs. Knight has recorded
in her Tour through the Wilderness from Hartford to New-York,
made some time before. Colles was a genuine philosopher; he had
studied the Salernian precepts, and could practically declare that a
bit in the morning was better than nothing all day.</p>

<p>Upon his final settlement in New-York, he at first lived by making
band-boxes: whether his mathematics gave them more symmetry
and grace, there is no one left to tell us. His support from this
source was precarious, and other appliances were at work, in the
manufacture of Prussian blue and other pigments. George Baron
commenced the <i>Mathematical Correspondent</i>, the first publication
of that sort in the Union, and similar in its intentions to the work of
Dr. Hutton. Baron was an English radical; and Colles, with a spice
of democracy in him, must have found politics and mathematics and
the social habits of Baron an occasional relief from his weightier
cares. The almanac-makers at fault, Colles supplied their deficiencies
in astronomical calculations; and he added to these avocations the
collecting and arranging of opossum and beaver-skins, Indian vases
and tomahawks, and other objects of curiosity with which he became
familiar during his extensive western tours through the Mohawk
country, and his interviews with the chiefs of Oneida Castle. He
found a congenial friend in Gardiner Baker, who was then engaged in

<!-- page 200 -->

fitting up a cabinet of native curiosities for the Tammany Society,
recently organized for the promotion of natural science and American
antiquities, the Grand Sachem of which was William Pitt Smith,
M.D., the author of the Letters of Amyntor.</p>

<p>A windfall seems to occur once in the life of every individual, and
so it happened to Colles. The Constitution of the United States being
adopted, and the duties on spirits established by Congress, both the
hydrostatics and chemistry of Colles were called into requisition, and he
was appointed to test the specific gravity of imported liquors. From
the scarcity of the article, he turned his artistic skill to the making of
proof-glasses&mdash;another source of profit to him. But this period of
advantageous business had its end; and, in his study of new things, he
projected his telegraph, which enabled him to meet his most pressing
wants, in his again straitened condition. The American Academy of
Fine Arts was now instituted, with Edward Livingston as its president;
and, enriched with the Napoleon presents and Chancellor Livingston's
rich gifts, needed a superintendent to watch over the beautiful
sculptures which it possessed. John Pintard, his ever-constant
friend, secured the trust for Colles, and we now find our ubiquitous
philosopher in good quarters and in wholesome employment. The
fondest mother never regarded with greater care her first-born than
Colles watched over the Venus of the Bath. He had leisure now to
drive another business, and perhaps the luckiest of his scientific hits
was the application he made of his telescope and microscope. The
casual pittance of a six-penny piece for a look at Venus, or the circulation,
through the web of a frog's foot, with his exegetical remarks,
proved adequate to his now fullest desires. What a contrast of condition
in life was Colles in New-York, with his old master, the affluent
Dolland, of London, with whom he had worked at achromatic lenses!
It was not always a clear atmosphere for Colles apparatus, but a
brilliant night or a cloudless day added to his receipts; and the fuller
contents of his basket, and the larger size of his head of cabbage, as
he returned from market, were diagnostic of the results of the preceding
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>While Colles was thus striving for the means of his daily existence,
he was aided by a residence in the Government-House, whither

<!-- page 201 -->

the Academy of Arts had been removed. Nor was he wholly over
looked by prominent characters. His acquisitions were known by
many, to be extensive if not profound; his industry through a long
life knew no idle hour; his talents were admitted to be above the
ordinary standard; his plans were sometimes pronounced visionary,
but his conversation was instructive, and his genius in mechanics sufficiently
original to command approbation. His nature was benevolent:
his morals void of offence toward <span class="smcap">God</span> and man. He was the
advocate of an enlarged toleration in political as well as in religious
opinion; and cordially as well as practically adopted the sentiment of
Jeremy Taylor, "The way to judge of religion is by doing our duty;
and theology is rather a divine life than a divine knowledge." It was
Iris constant aim to be useful. If his occupation was not always elevated,
he was too frequently the victim of controlling circumstances.
He knew Poor Richard by heart, yet he overlooked his aphorism,
"Three removes are as bad as a fire," and was wont to substitute, in
justification of his numerous transitions in life, the maxim, "A nimble
sixpence is better than a sluggish shilling." Many paid deference
to him amid all his disappointments. De Witt Clinton included
him among the prominent promoters of internal improvement, and
with philosophical liberality, uttered this noble sentiment in reference
to Colles as well as others: "For the good which has been done by
individuals or communities in relation to the work, let each have a
due share of credit." Dr. Mitchill often visited him and lauded his
services in the advancement of public works. Jarvis, the painter, pronounced
him a genius, and painted his portrait with great fidelity.
"My pencil," said Jarvis, "will render you hereafter better known:
you have done too much good to be forgotten." The picture is, or
ought to be, in the Historical Society. Dr. Hosack commemorated
him, in his Life of Clinton, as an early pioneer in behalf of the canal
policy of New-York, and caused an engraving of his portrait to occupy
a niche on the column of his canal worthies. Senator Seward has not
overlooked him in his elaborate introduction to the Natural History
of New-York. Trumbull, the historical painter, often cheered him
onward, and bid him hope, for on that article he himself had long lived.
Nor was that genuine Knickerbocker, G. C. Verplanck, indifferent to

<!-- page 202 -->

his condition, nor backward in suggestions. In the great celebration
which took place in this city in November, 1825, when the waters of
Erie united with the Atlantic, the effigy of Colles was borne with
appropriate dignity among the emblems of that vast procession. But
to John Pintard was Colles most indebted, many years, for numerous
acts of beneficence and for his bounty in greatest need. As
through his whole life of four-score years he had always more ideas in
his brain than pennies in his pocket, he must have proved something
more than an occasional customer.</p>

<p>As Colles was an instructive representative of much of that
peculiarity in the condition and affairs of New-York at the time in
which he may be said to have flourished, I shall trespass a moment,
by a brief exhibit of the circumstances which marked the period in
which he was upon the whole a prominent character. Every body
seemed to know him; no one spoke disparagingly of him. His enthusiasm,
his restlessness were familiar to the citizens at large. He, in
short, was a part of our domestic history, and an extra word or two
may be tolerated the better to give him his fair proportions. Had I
encountered Colles in any land, I would have been willing to have
naturalized him to our soil and institutions. He had virtues, the
exercise of which must prove profitable to any people. The biographer
of Chaucer has seen fit, inasmuch as his hero was born in London,
to give us a history and description of that city at the time of
Chaucer's birth, as a suitable introduction to his work. I shall
attempt no such task, nor shall I endeavor to make Colles a hero,
much as I desire to swell his dimensions. I shall circumscribe him to
a chap-book; he might be distended to a quarto. Yet the ardent and
untiring man was so connected with divers affairs, even after he had
domesticated himself among us, that the every movement in which he
took a part must have had a salutary influence on the masses of those
days. He was a lover of nature, and our village city of that time
gave him a fair opportunity of recreation among the lordly plane, and
elm, and catalpa trees of Wall-street, Broadway, Pearl-street, and the
Bowery. The beautiful groves about Richmond Hill and Lispenard
Meadows, and old Vauxhall, mitigated the dullness incident to his continuous
toil. A trip to the scattered residences of Brooklyn awakened

<!-- page 203 -->

rural associations; a sail to Communipaw gave him the opportunity
of studying marls and the bivalves. That divine principle of celestial
origin, religious toleration, seems to have had a strong hold on the
people of that day; and the persecuted Priestley, shortly after he
reached our shores, held forth in the old Presbyterian Church in Wall-street,
doubtless favored in a measure by the friendship of old Dr.
Rodgers, a convert to Whitefield, and a pupil of Witherspoon. This
fact I received from John Pintard. Livingston and Rodgers, Moore
and Provoost supplied the best Christian dietetics his panting desires
needed; while in the persons of Bayley and Kissam, and Hosack
and Post he felt secure from the misery of dislocations and fractures,
and that alarming pest, the yellow fever. He saw the bar occupied
with such advocates as Hamilton and Burr, Hoffmann and Colden,
and he dreaded neither the assaults of the lawless, nor the chicanery
of contractors. The old <i>Tontine</i> gave him more daily news than he
had time to digest, and the <i>Argus</i> and <i>Minerva</i>, <i>Freneau's Time-Piece</i>
and <i>Sword's New-York Magazine</i> inspired him with increased zeal
for liberty and a fondness for belles-letters. The City Library had,
even at that early day, the same tenacity of purpose which marks its
career at the present hour. There were literary warehouses in
abundance. Judah had decorated his with the portrait of Paine, and
here Colles might study Common Sense and the Rights of Man, or he
might stroll to the store of Duyckinck, the patron of books of piety,
works on education, and Noah Webster; or join t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te with old
Hugh Gaine or James Rivington and Philip Freneau; now all in
harmony, notwithstanding the withering satire against those accommodating
old tories by the great bard of the revolutionary crisis.</p>

The infantile intellect of those days was enlarged with Humpty-Dumpty
and Hi-diddle-diddle.* Shop-windows were stored with

<!-- page 204 -->

portraits of Paul Jones and Truxton, and the musical sentiment broke
forth in ejaculations of Tally Ho! and old Towler in one part of the
town, and, in softer accents, with Rousseau's Dream in another. Here
and there, too, might be found a coterie gratified with the crescendo
and diminuendo of Signor Trazetta; nearly thirty years elapsed
from this period ere the arrival of the Garcia troupe, through the efforts
of our lamented Almaviva, <i>Dominick Lynch</i>, the nonpareil of society,
when the Italian opera, with its unrivalled claims, burst forth from
the enchanting voice of that marvellous company. The years 1795-1800
were unquestionably the period in which the treasures of the
German mind were first developed in this city by our exotic and indigenous
writers. That learned orientalist, Dr. Kunze, now commenced
the translations into English of the German Hymns, and
Strebeck and Milledolar gave us the Catechism of the Lutherans.
The Rev. Mr. Will, Charles Smith, and William Dunlap now supplied
novelties from the German dramatic school, and Kotzebue and
Schiller were found on that stage where Shakespeare had made his
first appearance in the new world in 1752. Colles had other mental
resources, as the gayeties and gravities of life were dominant with
him. The city was the home of many noble spirits of the Revolution:
General Stevens, of the Boston Tea-Party, was here, full of
anecdote. Fish, of Yorktown celebrity, and Gates of Saratoga,
always accessible.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*<span class="smcap">We</span> have books without end concerning the origin of nations and races, while these mental
instructors of a people have been favored with scarcely a pamphlet in vindication of their claims to

mishaps. They have been too long the schoolmasters of early thought to be longer overlooked.
Why do not our scholars ferret out their birth-place, whether High Dutch or Low Dutch, with
more satisfaction, instead of referring us to the drama of the sixteenth century and the Bodleian
Library? Would the task prove unworthy of the learning of the distinguished teacher of German,
Professor <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>, of Columbia College? He might find in the inquiry a pastime from the cares of his
collegiate life. Notwithstanding Porson's labors, "What's Hecuba to me or I to Hecuba?" is the

<p>There existed in New-York, about these times, a war of opinion
which seized even the medical faculty. The Bastile had been taken.

<!-- page 205 -->

French speculations looked captivating, and Genet's movements won
admiration, even with grave men. In common with others, our school
masters partook of the prevailing mania: the tricolored cockade
was worn by numerous school-boys, as well as by their seniors. The
yellow fever was wasting the population; but the patriotic fervor,
either for French or English politics, glowed with ardor. With other
boys I united in the enthusiasm. The Carminole was heard everywhere.
I give a verse of a popular song echoed throughout the streets
of our city, and heard at the Belvidere at that period:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">America</span>, that lovely nation,
    Once was bound, but now is free;
She broke her chain, for to maintain
    The rights and cause of liberty."</p>

</div>

<p>Strains like this of the Columbian bards in those days of party
virulence emancipated the feelings of many a throbbing breast, even
as now the songs, of pregnant simplicity and affluent tenderness, by
Morris, afford delight to a community pervaded by a calmer spirit,
and controlled by a loftier refinement. Moreover, we are to remember
that in that early age of the Republic an author, and above all a
poet, was not an every-day article. True, old Dr. Smith, once a
chemical professor in King's College, surcharged with learning and
love, who found Delias and Daphnes everywhere, might be seen in
the public ways, with his madrigals for the beautiful women of his
select acquaintance; but the buds of promise of the younger Low
(of a poetic family) were blighted by an ornithological error:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" 'T is <i>morn</i>, and the landscape is lovely to view,
The <i>nightingale</i> warbles her song in the grove."</p>

</div>

<p>Weems had not yet appeared in the market, with his Court of
Hymen; Clifton was pulmonary; Wardell's declaration</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"To the tuneful <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> I now mean to hollow!"</p>

</div>

<p>was annunciatory and nothing more; and Searson, exotic by birth,
yet domesticated with us, having made vast struggles in his perilous

<!-- page 206 -->

journey toward Mount Parnassus, had already descended, with what 
feelings is left to conjecture, by the poet's closing lines of his Valedictory 
to his muse:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'<span class="smcap">Poets</span>, like grass-hoppers, sing till they die,
Yet, in this world, some laugh, some sing, some cry."</p>

</div>

<p>The Mohawk reviewers, as John Davis called the then critics of 
our city, thought, with the old saying, that "where there is so much 
smoke, there must be some fire." But it is no longer questionable, 
that our Castalian font was often dry, and when otherwise, its stream 
was rather a muddy rivulet than a spring of living waters. It needs
our faithful Lossing to clear up the difficulties of that doubtful period 
of patriotism and of poetry.</p>

<p>There were enough enlightened minds and generous hearts to 
recognize the merits of Colles. He stood before the community as a 
kind of miniature edition of Count Rumford. Projectors, with new 
inventions, sought his opinions. Garnett, of New-Jersey, a clever 
man, and in literary communion with the poet Akenside, conversed 
with him on the most effective impulse secured by the sails of the 
windmill. Williamson queried him on the electric powers of the 
gymnotus; Blanchard, the &aelig;ronaut, on the &aelig;riform currents of our 
atmosphere; and Mitchill unfolded to him his theory of septic acid and 
how the Python produced pestilence. When Perkins arrived among 
us, armed with his tractors, and fortified by the credentials of a score 
of bishops and other dignitaries of the Church of England, in behalf 
of their saving efficacy, Colles, who meddled a little with physic, had 
nearly been entrapped by that infamous impostor, who assumed the 
ability to cure yellow fever by his metallic points, during its prevalence 
in 1799. The death of Perkins himself, on the third day of 
his illness, by the epidemic, while in full use of his remedial agent, 
was too convincing evidence of the absurdity of his means, for Colles 
longer to prosecute inquiries into the nature of the tractors and their 
mesmeric influence. Yet after all this sort of Caleb Quotem occupation, 
it was demonstrable that Colles, in feelings or in thoughts, never 
dismounted from the hobby he first rode: water and water-courses,

<!-- page 207 -->

canals and aqueducts, were ever present to his mind: he could not 
visit Spuytenduyvel without thinking of his dear Bronx; the very 
flow from the spout of his tea-pot advised him of hydraulics and lock 
navigation.</p>

<p>I knew Colles well for a long period, and I, in my way, <i>pro re 
nata</i>, administered to him an occasional dose. On the old principle 
that misery loves company, I illustrated to him, from occurrences 
around him, that genius and poverty were often associates, as in the 
case of Oliver Evans, and told him what Bard had long ago told me, 
that the accomplished architect of the spire of our venerable church of 
St. Paul, died penniless, and in a hospital&mdash;but what has now-a-days 
become a creed in some brains, that like cures like, had no alterative 
influence in the present instance. Like other lovers of mathematics, 
he was fond of music, and versed in hymnology: he revelled 
with Toplady, and shed tears with Newton. When oppressed 
with inward sorrows he read Euler and Maclaurin, and occasionally, 
when without a meal, he summoned his ideality in calculating 
the safest means to sustain a bank currency. Like some 
political economists of the present day, he favored the notion that 
that bank was safest which has no capital. Colles cherished the doctrine 
of signs, which he derived, I believe, from Culpepper. He was 
wont to say that a disastrous star presided at his birth, and that if he 
had been brought up a hatter, the people would have come into the 
world without heads.</p>

<p>From this inadequate sketch it is sufficiently apparent that Colles 
pursued knowledge under the most stubborn difficulties; that through 
life he struggled with adverse forces, and rarely experienced the enjoyments 
of existence. His death took place in the fall of 1821, at the 
advanced age of eighty-four years. John Pintard and myself had the 
honor to be his only followers to the grave. The Rev. Dr. Creighton 
(that worthy divine who recently declined a bishopric) officiated on 
the mournful occasion. He lies in the Episcopal burial-ground in 
Hudson street, but no mark designates the spot. Thus much of Colles, 
and thus much was assuredly due to the memory of the man whose 
investigations more than three quarters of a century ago promoted 
the great internal policy which signalizes New-York, and finally ended

<!-- page 208 -->

in the erection of that immense undertaking, the Croton Aqueduct, a
demonstration worthy of the talents and renown of Major Douglass.</p>

<p>There was something very engaging in the physiognomy of Colles.
He was naturally cheerful and buoyant; at times pensive, yet free
from any corrosive melancholy. His ample front, his sparse white
locks, his cavernous gray eyes, with that weakness which often marks
old age, betokened a resigned spirit. To see him on an early morning
visit, seated at his small pine table, with his bowl of milk, his dry
bread and potato, offering up grace for the bounties he was favored
with, was a lesson to the ungrateful epicure, of edifying influence.
The cheerfulness and mellowness of his life are well expressed in the
words of Dyer, on another occasion:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">        "&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">There</span> is a mood,
(I sing not to the vacant or the young,)
There is a kindly mood of melancholy
That wings the soul and points her to the skies."</p>

</div>

<p>If to his great and varied attainments Colles had added the practical
functions of a school-master, or had he been more fortunate in his
fiscal relations, he might have been honored with the highest academic
distinction by some of our venerable collegiate institutions.</p>

<h3 id="c23">Edmund Kean.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>BY H. T. TUCKERMAN.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> finest moral trait in Kean was a certain spirit, tenacity of
purpose, and lofty confidence in himself, which differed widely from
presumption or conceit: a kind of instinctive faith, that no force of
circumstances or prescription ever quenched. This quality, more
easily felt than described, seems the prerogative of genius in all
departments of life, and is often the only explicable inspiration that
sustains it amid discomfiture and privation. It runs, like a thread
of gold, through the dark and tangled web of Kean's career&mdash;lends
something of dignity to the most abject moment of his life, and
redeems from absolute degradation his moments of most entire self-abandonment.
Thus, when an obscure and provincial actor, performing
Alexander the Great, he replied indignantly to the sarcasm of an
auditor in the stage-box, who called him Alexander the Little: "Yes,
Sir, with a great soul!" and exultingly told his wife, after his first
great success in London, in reply to her anxious inquiry what Lord
Essex thought of him: "D&mdash;n Lord Essex, the pit rose to me;"
he felt that the appeal of genius was universal, and that which
stirred in his blood demanded the response of humanity. This consciousness
of natural gifts made him spurn the least encroachment
upon his self-respect, however poverty weighed him down, and long
before fame justified to the world his claims. He rushed for ever
away from the house of his earliest protector, because of a careless
remark of one of the company that disavowed his equality with the
children of the family. Whenever an inferior part was allotted him,
he fled to avoid the compromise of his feelings; and after his triumph

<!-- page 212 -->

was achieved, poured a bowl of punch over the stage-manager's head
at Drury Lane, to punish his impertinent criticisms at the first
rehearsal. The same proud independence led him to avoid the social
honors of rank. He liked professional and literary men because he
thought they truly relished and understood his art. The restraints,
the cold uniformity, and the absence of vivid interest in the circles
of the nobility, either oppressed or irritated him, and he chafed until
free to give vent to his humor, passion, and convivial tastes among
boon companions.</p>

<p>A fine audacity and that abhorrence of the conventional we find
in hunters, poets, and artists&mdash;the instinctive self-assertion of a
nature assured that its own resources are its best and only reliable
means of success and enjoyment&mdash;thus underlaid Kean's wayward and
extravagant moods; and while it essentially interfered with his popularity
as a man, it was a primary cause of his triumph as an actor;
for no histrionic genius more clearly owed his success to the will.
In this regard he was a species of Alfieri. The style he adopted, the
method he pursued, and the aim he cherished, were neither understood
nor encouraged until their own intrinsic and overwhelming
superiority won both the critics and the multitude. The taste in
England had been formed by Kemble and his school: dignity,
correctness, grave emphasis, and highly-finished elocution had become
the standard characteristics. Kean was a bold innovator upon this
system; he trusted to nature more than to art, or rather endeavored
to fuse the two. Thus, while carefully giving the very shades of
meaning to the words of Shakspeare, he endeavored to personify the
character&mdash;not according to an eloquent ideal, but with human
reality, as if the very life-blood of Othello and Lear, their temperaments
as well as their experience, had been vitally transferred to his
frame and brain. He seemed possessed with the character he represented;
and, throwing mere technical rules to the winds, identified
himself through passional sympathy, regulated by studious contemplation,
with the idiosyncrasies of those whose very natures
and being he aspired to embody and develop.</p>

<p>Kean obeyed the instinct of genius, when, in opposition to the
management at Drury Lane, arranging his d&eacute;b&ucirc;t, he exclaimed,

<!-- page 213 -->

"Shylock or nothing!" In that part there was scope for his intellectual
energy, opportunity to give those magical shades of intensity
and throw into those dark, acute features the infinite power of expression
for which he was distinguished. A few weeks before that
memorable evening, his first-born son had died in a provincial town,
and in all the agony of his bereavement he had been obliged to act,
to gain money to defray the funeral expenses. Thence he had
gone up to town, and, owing to a misunderstanding of the contract,
for months endured the pressure of actual want and the heart-sickness
of hope deferred. The season was unpropitious, his spirits and
energy were depressed by fasting, affliction, and neglect. While he
was at rehearsal, his wife sold one of her few remaining articles
of apparel to obtain him a dinner, fortified by which he trudged
through the snow to the theatre. The series of triumphs succeeding
this memorable night are well known. The overpowering reality of
his personation gave Lord Byron a convulsive fit, caused an actress
to faint on the stage, and an old comedian to weep, replenished the
treasury of Drury Lane, electrified the United Kingdom, ushered in
a new theatrical era, and crowned him with sudden prosperity and
fame. His star, however, set in clouds; his last appearance in London
was as melancholy as his first was brilliant; alienated from his
family, the victim of excess&mdash;proud, sensitive, and turbulent&mdash;his
domestic troubles were only reconciled just before his death, which
came as a relief to himself and those with whom he was connected.</p>

<p>While the histrionic achievements of Kean identify his name
with the progress of dramatic art, his actual life and habits pertain
rather to a sphere without the limits of civilization. A wild vein
belonged to his very nature, and seemed indicative of gipsy or savage
blood. It gleamed sometimes from his extraordinary eyes, when
acting, so as to appal, startle, and impress every class of observers.
A man once cried out in the pit at the demoniacal glare of his optics,
as Shylock meditating revenge on his creditor, "It is the devil!"
His poet-biographer compares him to the van-winged hero of Paradise
Lost; and West, the painter, declared he had never been so
haunted by the look of a human face as by that of Kean. Something
of this peculiar trait also exhibited itself in his action and tones,

<!-- page 214 -->

and made his audience thrill with the fierce energy of his soul. But
while it thus subserved the purposes of art, and was, in fact, an
element of his genius, it infected his private life with a reckless and
half-maniacal extravagance that was fostered by his addiction to
stimulants, an unprotected infancy, and the precarious and baffled
tenor of his youth and early manhood.</p>

<p>When we bring home to ourselves this erratic behavior, combined
with extreme vicissitudes of fortune, the career of Kean, as a man,
seems almost as remarkable as it was as an actor. A stage-Cupid at
two years of age, a circus-rider and harlequin, then an infant prodigy
reciting Rolla; his very origin disputed; now the slave of a capricious,
ignorant, and selfish woman; and now the wayward protege of
a benevolent lady; arranging Mother Goose for one manager, and
taking the part of a supernumerary for another; reduced to such
poverty as to travel on foot, his wife trudging wearily at his side,
and his boy clinging to his back; at one time swimming a river with
his theatrical wardrobe in a bundle held by the teeth, and, at another,
for whole days, half-famished, and his wife praying at her lonely
vigils for a speedy release by death from hopeless suffering; to-day
dancing attendance, for the hundredth time, at Drury Lane, to gain the
ear of the director, and known among the bystanders only as "the
little man with the capes;" and to-morrow, the idol of the town, his
dressing-room besieged by lords&mdash;few chronicles in real life display
more vivid and sudden contrasts than the life of Kean. The mercurial
temper that belonged to him was liable, at any moment, to be
excited by drink, sympathy, an idea, or an incident. One night it
induced him to disturb the quiet household where he lodged, by
jumping through a glass door; another, to seize the heads of the
leaders attached to his majesty's mail-coach and attempt a wrestling-match.
In Dublin, it winged his flight for hours through the dusky
streets, with a mob of screaming constables at his heels. It inspired
him to engage in midnight races on horseback. In more quiet manifestations,
it induced him to make a pet of a lion, and a sacred relic
of the finger-bone of Cook; and prompted him, to his wife's extreme
annoyance, to retire to bed in the costume of a monkey. At one
time it led him to muse for hours in a church-yard; and, at another,

<!-- page 215 -->

to try country-life on his estate at Bute, or haunt the "Red Lion"
and the "Coal-Hole." In England it made him a volunteer jockey at
a race; in Italy, a fascinating story-teller and mimic to the monks of
road-side convents; and in America, caused him to be duly inaugurated
chief of a tribe of Indians.</p>

<p>There is no actor of whom such instances of arrogance toward
the public and individuals are related; but it is to be observed that
they generally originated in exasperated feeling, caused by undeserved
neglect or gross misappreciation; and charity will ever make allowance
for the inevitable results of an incongruous and homeless childhood.
Kean's father nearly ruined his son's physique by employing
him, at a tender age, to figure in pantomime; timely surgical aid
having only saved his limbs from utter deformity. The redeeming
influences of his early years were the benevolent intervention of Dr.
Drury, who, recognizing his promise, sent him to Eton; and the
patient teachings of Miss Tidswell, an actress of Drury Lane. That
he was born with a genius for the stage is evinced by the fact that
at the age of thirteen his Cato and Hamlet satisfied provincial
audiences; and his recitation of Satan's Address to the Sun, from
Paradise Lost, won royal approbation at Windsor. His talent for
feigning served him occasionally more practical benefit than that
derived from its entertaining quality; as, when he was released from
a rash engagement on board ship, as cabin-boy, for pretended deafness,
and escaped the indignation of a London audience he wantonly
disappointed, by a well-acted dislocation of the shoulder.</p>

<p>If Kean's early circumstances were adverse to his moral, they
were, in many respects, highly favorable to his professional development.
The long apprenticeship he served to the stage, embracing
every grade of character and almost all functions of a player, made
him thoroughly at home on the boards, and induced much of his ease,
tact, and facility; his circus experiences and habits of active life gave
both vigor and suppleness to his frame; while the vagrant career he
led, brought him in view of all kinds of character and phases of life,
by which he observantly profited to a degree that only those intimate
with him fully realized. While in this country, his genius excited
the intelligent admiration, and his recklessness the benevolent care, of

<!-- page 216 -->

a professional gentleman, who became his constant associate and
friend. From him I learn that the versatility of Kean's accomplishments
was quite as remarkable as the intensity of his acting and the
extravagance of his moods. He would often enchain an intellectual
circle at a fashionable party, by his exquisite vocalism, the effect of
which was inexplicable to those who listened to his limited, and unmusical
voice; or by the rich anecdotes or shrewd comments of his table-talk;
and when released from this to him intolerable social thraldom,
work off the nervous re&auml;ction induced by so many hours of
restraint, by throwing half-a-dozen summersets with the celerity and
grace of a practised harlequin. He was, indeed, a compact embodiment
of muscles and nerves; his agility and strength were such that
his frame instantly obeyed his will from the bound of a gladiator to
the expressive restlessness of quivering fingers. His voice ranged
through every note and cadence of power and sensibility; now by a
whisper of tenderness bringing tears from callous men, and the next
moment, chilling their very hearts with the fierce tones of an imprecation.
But these remarkable physical endowments would have merely
subserved the narrow purposes of the athlete or the mimic, had they
not been united to a mind of extraordinary sagacity and a face of
unequalled expression; by virtue of these he rendered them the instruments
of efficient art. The professors at Edinburgh were disappointed,
after seeing him perform and hearing him converse, to find
that he had no original theory of elocution to broach, and no striking
principles of oratory to advocate. His touches were a composite and
individual result, no more to be formally imparted than the glow of
poetry or the zest of wit; they grew out of profound observation
fused into a practical issue by the inspiration of genius.</p>

<p>Coleridge said that to see Kean act was like reading Shakspeare
by lightning. The spell of his penetrating eyes and half-Jewish physiognomy
was not more individual than his style of personation; and
the attempt to transfer some of his points to another has almost invariably
produced an incongruous effect. His excitable temperament
was another secret of his magnetism and his foibles; while it enabled
him wonderfully to engage the sympathies of an audience, it rendered
him liable to be overcome by the least moral or physical excitement,

<!-- page 217 -->

and made him the slave of impulse. Regularly in New-York, every
afternoon, he seized the copy of an evening journal inimical to him,
with the tongs, rang for a servant, and sent it away in this manner;
while, at the same time, he scrupulously laid aside a guinea a week,
during the whole of his sojourn, to reward the faithful services of a
poor servant: often drawn by his kind guardian from a haunt of
debauchery, just in time to appear on the stage, he would, at others,
attire himself like a finished gentleman, mix in the most refined society,
and manifest a noble scorn of money, and an absolute reverence
for mental superiority, that excited involuntary respect. Kean, the
dissolute man, the inebriated boon companion, quoting Latin, the
generous and loyal friend, the funny mimic, and the great impersonator
of Shakspeare, seemed like so many different beings, with some
thing identical in the eyes, voice, and stature: and as marvellous a
disparity marked his fortunes&mdash;it being scarcely credible that the
same man whose appearance brought a solitary sixpence to the Dumfries
theatre, is he who, glittering with the ornaments of Garrick, filled
Drury Lane to suffocation for entire seasons; or that the luxurious
apartments, crowded with men of note, are tenanted by him whose
wife for years kept vigils of penury. It is creditable to Kean's magnanimity
under these bewildering transitions, that he never played
the tyrant; that he was uniformly kind to poor and inferior actors,
and manifested a spirit above envy. After seeing old Garcia perform
Othello in New-York, he sent him a costly gift in token of his admiration;
he candidly acknowledged the superiority of Talma, and labored,
with genuine zeal, to commemorate the histrionic fame of Cooke.</p>

<p>It is common to speak of great acting or vocalism as indescribable;
and, to a certain extent, this is doubtless true; but distinctness
of style is characteristic of genius in all things, and an intellectual
observer can adequately report even the evanescent charms of dramatic
personation when harmoniously conceived and efficiently embodied.
Accordingly, we derive from the criticisms and reminiscences
of Kean's intelligent admirers, a very clear idea of his general merits.
It is obvious that these consisted of simplicity and earnestness; that,
endowed with fiery passions and a sagacious intellect, he boldly under
took to represent Shakspeare, not according to any prescriptive

<!-- page 218 -->

model or rules of art, but through his individual reflection and sympathy.
Like the great master of the written drama, he followed
closely the intimations of nature; cast, as it were, self-consciousness
away, and assimilated the actual elements of human life with his own
action and expression. Hence the truth of his violent contrasts the
light and shade of art. Hence the frequency and effect of his brief,
suggestive, and thrilling exclamations, that made a single word or
interjection reveal infinite woe, joy, surprise, or madness. It is for
the same reason, that, upon refined minds and earnest hearts, his acting
unfolded ever new beauty and truth, as described by Dana, whose
criticism, when Kean read, he exclaimed, "This man understands
me." By this firm, and, if we may so say, subtle yet instinctive
adherence to nature, a certain grandeur and effect, only yielded her
genuine votaries, seemed to invest and glorify the actor, so that his
most incidental attitudes and by-play wore a reality undiscoverable in
the most elaborate efforts of inferior performers. To the same principle
we ascribe his versatility. Each character was a distinct study.
Where his consciousness was at fault in suggesting the most authentic
manner, tone, or expression, he had recourse to observation; he
reflected deeply, and appeared to identify himself, by the process,
with the being he was to enact, until his very soul became imbued
with the melancholy of Hamlet, the insanity of Lear, and the mental
agony of Othello.</p>

With <span class="smcap">Griswold's</span> garnered hoard of native rhyme.
<span class="smcap">Heaven</span>, sure, the land with favoring eye regards&mdash;
Two hundred genuine and immortal bards!
Time was when Genius' weary growth was slow,
A century-plant, that once an age would blow,
A shooting orb, that as it rushed and blazed,
Drew eyes of millions, and their senses crazed:
And nations hushed as if the thunder spoke,
Then in one wide and general p&aelig;an broke!
How few enshrined and classic gods of rhyme,
Embalmed by fame, survive the rust of time!
Less than the muses that inspired their strain&mdash;
Still less&mdash;of Europe's modern boast remain.
Though myriad twinklers, struggling for our gaze,
Just stain the zenith with their general haze;
Apart and rare the lights of surer ray
Emerge like planets from that milky way.
But in our sphere what numbers claim the eye!
Two hundred lights contending for the sky!
Two hundred wits of one ripe age the birth!
Whence this profusion? Does the teeming earth

With the rank waste of vegetative life,
That plant a stake, at once it sprouts a tree,
Spawn genius, too, as well? How oft we see

Here planted, shoot, and laurel honors bear!

Rose on my sight great <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus'</span> golden car!
Harnessed to coursers, mettled, fleet, and proud,
Trampling the noiseless and unyielding cloud:
The linked Hours around the chariot flew,
Fair as the forms that <span class="smcap">Guido's</span> pencil drew.
<span class="smcap">Aurora</span>, leading the fair band of Hours,
Rained from her hand a shower of dropping flowers:
Seemed the whole vision, as it swam the sky,
An iridescent bubble floating by;
Which, as it neared Parnassus' sacred hill,
Lighted, re-bounded, quivered, and stood still!
At once dismounting there, the radiant god,
Gracious with smiles, the hallowed mountain trod.
His showering locks of amber, all unbound,
Shook the gold dust of shivered sunbeams round.
To greet him circling stood, with lesser stars,

Sensation stirred the court as he appeared,

In that benighted land where Gotham lies,
Heaping, or wasting, still on gain intent,
Unwisely gotten, more unwisely spent:
Where Learning withers 'neath the golden glare,
And men are measured by the purse they wear:
And bards, cold-shouldered, passed without compassion;
And song itself 'cui-bonoed' out of fashion:
Deeply it grieves us such as thou to find,
Sowing the golden harvest of thy mind
Not on the muses' gardens of the rose,
But that most sterile waste&mdash;(excuse me)&mdash;prose."
Replied the poet, somewhat nettled, "Sire!
My lord, and master of the matchless lyre!
True, prose for bread I bartered, I confess:
But I am toiling for the freest press
And freest party in a land most free:
In short, your grace, my theme is liberty;

Without regard to nation, hue, or race:
And little boots it, when that goal we'd make,
With all respect, what vehicle we take."
"Hold!" quoth the god, "Thou dost defame the art
That knows the readiest access to the heart.
The blows of prose, like those by fists applied,
Do service in close contest, side to side;
While song throws arrows, feathered and sublime,
That range through widest space and farthest time!
Yet wouldst thou match them as of equal might;
And this from thee&mdash;the muses favorite?
And this from one that wears the laurel crown?
With thy own weapons will I put thee down.
One lyric more from thy all-moving pen;
Another song like that of '<span class="smcap">Marion's</span> Men'

More zealous freedom in the nation's heart

<p class="stanza">The court is moved; the muses shout applause

That rigorous Justice deigns to list, and pause."
Replied the bard: "For lack of courtesy,
In presence such as this, none more than I
Could mourn his own short-comings: good my lord!
Thanks to all friends that lent me favoring word."
"Enough!" said <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span>, as he waved his hand,
"On graver charge we've called thee to the stand.
Where is the lyre, by our too partial love
Confided, when thy earliest songs were wove,
To thy twin-brother (now no more) and thee?
Dead <span class="smcap">Drake</span>! is <span class="smcap">Halleck</span>, then, less dead than he?
Unstrung, abandoned to the dust, that lyre
No more awakes us with its living fire.
Thy precious gifts all flung ignobly by,
When wings should give the energy to fly;
With voice, lyre, skill, and favoring gods, O shame!
That <span class="smcap">Halleck</span> loiters at the heels of Fame!"</p>

<p class="stanza">Quailed the poor bard: but more he felt the smart
Of self-reproach, that stung his troubled heart.
"Great Judge and Sovereign, thou hast justly spoke;
Without excuse, save what would smiles provoke.
I can but hint that, <span class="smcap">Pegasus</span>, grown old,
Prefers to graze him in the quiet fold;
And marks the caperings, with solemn eye,
Of reckless colts careering through the sky;
And hard the task, in this poor spavined state,
To prick the veteran to a decent gait.
When bards advanced would float, and dream again
In that rare half-way heaven, the muses reign,
They're prone, o'erbalanced by the drowsy god,
To topple over in the land of Nod.
And't were not wise, with rusty lyre, again
To claim your ears with my old-fashioned strain."
"By Jove! we fear not," shouts the god of day;
<!-- page 224 -->"For use will quickly wear the rust away:
And by the fame thy youth so richly won,
By thy land's hopes of her rare-gifted son.
By that posterity which looms before,
We charge you, strike that injured lyre once more!
Strike home! and fear not it will sound in vain;
'Strike! for your altars and your fires' again;
'Strike! for the green graves of your sires,' with hand
Of thrilling sweep: 'strike for your native land!' "</p>

<p class="stanza">Here general plaudits thundered widely round,
That all Parnassus echoed with the sound.
When <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> rose amid the general roar,
"Order!" cried <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span> "give the god the floor!"
"Our worthy host! your judgments are most sound
But let me hint, 't is time the cup went round;
'T is hot, near <i>you</i>, with other reasons why,
The law is so proverbially <i>dry</i>."
"Ho! <span class="smcap">Ganymede</span>; a stoup of nectar fill:
Or something stronger, as their graces will!</p>

<p class="stanza">"Call General <span class="smcap">Morris</span>!" From behind a tree
The woodman spared, where snugly hid was he,
Waiting for orders, not without some fears,
"<i>En grande tenue</i>" the warrior bard appears:
Salutes his great commander, and his lord;
But trips, embarrassed by his own good sword.
Tittered the muses, strange to warrior's gear,
Save <span class="smcap">Mars'</span> scant uniform of helm and spear.
Muttered the war-god with impatient stamp:
"Some carpet-knight this; drum him from the camp!"
"Order! sweet friends!" <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> soothed the bard:
"Thou'lt have fair hearing, and a just reward
For trophies won of every lyric sort
To claim the favor of this noble court.
Thy casual tripping should no jest afford;
'T is hard to climb Parnassus with a sword."
"Thanks for your grace, my chief!" the minstrel sighed;
"As for my deeds, from earliest youth I've plied
The poet's shuttle, not without success,
As songs, translated in all tongues, confess.
<!-- page 225 -->My Croton Ode, sung by three hundred men,
You must have heard it! made sensation then.
I've stood the fire on Independence Day,
And braved the muddy perils of Broadway."
"That needs some courage!" growled the god of war;
"In short, great king! my aim has been, so far
As strength is mine, to wield the sword and lyre.
I'm called the Western <span class="smcap">K&ouml;rner</span> by my choir."
<span class="smcap">Apollo</span> smiled, and shook his radiant head:
"Wouldst serve two masters? better one instead;
For <span class="smcap">Mars</span> disowns thee, and each muse above
Would spurn the proffers of divided love.
Be ruled by me, and hold to song alone,
Wherein thy genial gifts have fairest shown:
Touches of Nature wed with graceful Art
That rarely fail to move the common heart.
Nor seek with double chaplets to be crowned:
One <span class="smcap">K&ouml;rner</span> only in one age is found!</p>

<p class="stanza">"Now, from his rural mountain-home afar,
Go summon <span class="smcap">Willis</span> to our royal bar!"
He comes; no sooner said than done the deed:
More swift mercurial than electric speed.
To whom bright <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span> "Can it then be true
That thou, too, shunn'st us as the laggards do?
Thou! whom thy lady-friends with zealous glow
Once dubbed 'a young <span class="smcap">Apollo</span>' down below?"
"Great King of Rhyme-dom! you must be aware
Nature's a feminality, most fair,
Most jealous, too, and keeps me closely tied,
With delving, sowing, reaping, at her side.
That needs my jottings be confined to prose,
And 'oats-pease-bean-dom' scarce leaves time for those."
"Plausibly argued"&mdash;hero <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> smiled&mdash;
"To shield from blame thy truly idle wild.
Be Nature fair&mdash;sure poets should rehearse
Such fairest charms in fairest strains&mdash;of verse;
If jealous, surely 'ballad to her brow'
Is lover's remedy for lover's woe.
Nature's no Quaker; and the drab of prose
Is not the tint to represent the rose.
<!-- page 226 -->No! with the mated songsters of the spring
Thy very lines should couple, shine, and sing!
What! live 'mid birds, without an answering song?
On mountain-heights, nor soar on numbers strong?
Among the flowers, nor twine one lyric wreath
Of grateful tribute for their fragrant breath?
'Mid autumn-woods, nor paint in words the glow?
By streams, nor seek in limpid verse to flow?
By cataracts sit, nor tune the clarion voice
In like harmonious echoes to rejoice?
Canst roam the dells by <span class="smcap">Dian's</span> mellow blaze,
Nor weave one quiring chaplet in her praise?
Canst mark, unsung, the Pleiades? that fret
Like silver-fishes in a prisoning net?
Nor seek to hum, while choral stars are burning.
The music of their golden axles turning?
Degenerate bard! go sow your fields along
With the light-winged, far-roving seed of song!
Song such as cheered you when an unstained child,
Until fresh idyls echo through your wild!"</p>

<p class="stanza">"Call <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>! hold! saving too little done.
Who sings so well needs no advice. Pass on!
Next following, comes our favorite, <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>." "Stay!"
<span class="smcap">Minerva</span> pleads; "now, sacred from our sway,
He walks Hesperian gardens, plucking fruit;
Or groves Elysian in some flower-pursuit:
There, in rare dreams, on braver wings to soar
Than even his gallant fancy dared before."
The goddess ceased: all read, at once, that heard.
The bard's sad fate in her mysterious word:
Storm-driven, wing-broken, baffled, whirling still
Through the same heaven where he had plied at will;
And all recalled the long, o'ershadowed years
Of his waste-wanderings with unbidden tears!</p>

<p class="stanza">"Now summon <span class="smcap">Paulding</span> from his snug retreat!"
He moves sedately to the judgment-seat.
"What purpose, Sire! subp&oelig;naed from afar,
Juror or witness, bids me to thy bar?"
"No witness thou! thyself defendant art.
<!-- page 227 -->Attend!" cried <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span>, "and I will impart:
In youth you flattered me with song and lute,
Courted my sisters with impassioned suit;
Half-won, then jilted, first for vulgar prose,
And last for thorny office, spurned the rose;
Ever earth-plodding, though full-winged for air.
Bethink you, Sir! if 't is not hard to bear?"
Replied the bard: "My lord! 't is soon confessed;
I've had my school-boy fancies, like the rest;
But riper years, and themes of deeper truth
Chased, as they should, the follies of my youth."
Here a deep murmur rose; nor only this;
Among the muses something like a hiss;
So sharp a fling to rouse the god was sure.
"Would that thy manhood's follies were as pure!
The games of wealth and power are noble joys!
While song, great gods! is well enough for boys!
Your worldly wisdom, Sir, is but half-wise.
Then, know you not that feeling, at the rise,
Like mountain-stream, flows purest from its spring?
And early loves are of Heaven's whispering?
Aye! the song-bias that the young heart cheers
Betrays its kindred to harmonious spheres."</p>

<p class="stanza">"Pardon, my lord! I had no thought to wound
Your party-feelings here on your own ground;
Where such majorities are on your side
To take the stump were rash." the bard replied;
"I would but say&mdash;what might be left unsaid&mdash;
That by the favor of the nation's head
I rose, you know, to honors in the state;
And those who once have mated with the great
Should guard their dignity, and keep them free
From light amusements, graceful though they be.
In this, 'gainst Poesy I take no part;
Which, in its way, is quite a pretty art."</p>

<p class="stanza">Here groans tumultuous through the court are stirred,
While over all <span class="smcap">Apollo's</span> voice is heard.
Scornful, and radiant in his heavenly ire,
He stood sublime! and poured his words of fire:
<!-- page 228 -->"Now by the gods that high Olympus throng;
By the shrined masters of triumphant song;
By this melodious sisterhood, I swear,
This railing tongue is more than gods can bear!
'A pretty art!' the trophies of whose pride
Survive all else when states themselves have died.
'A pretty art!' The Greek's, that held all ears
Bound to his harp for thrice a thousand years;
Or his of Avon, while whose lyre was strung,
<span class="smcap">Apollo's</span> own was on the willows hung
A 'light amusement' were his rapturous lays,
Who 'scorned delights', and lived laborious days.
Immortal labor! whose renown shall soar
Till blooms the Eden of his song once more!"
Paused the proud god; to whom replied, unquailed,
The stolid minstrel: "Sire! I've not assailed
The bard's renown; yet stands it not alone;
The statesman's fame is no unworthy one.
There's <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>&mdash;&mdash;" "Granted!" broke the impatient god,
"Nay, more; his name most warmly would I laud,
Who serves his state in senate or in field.
The bard's supremacy I can not yield.
Though poor, though worthless in surrounding eyes,
He has the leaven that will make him rise,
Where reigning great ones vainly seek to climb,
But sink to silence with the dregs of time.
What most endure, though seeming weak, most strong,
Are words made buoyant by the wings of song;
That seem to lift them to a calmer air.
Where earth's abrading forces can not wear:
So near the stars' harmonious, glowing clime,
They catch their lustre, and perennial chime!
All that would bloom through time for ever young
Must sing as bards, or else by bards be sung;
Must in the flow of amber verse be drowned;
In web of song's embalming priest be wound.
Surest of balms! of all the precious spoils
Of spicy Araby, or tropic isles.
Mark the dim glories of the shadowy past!
So mighty once, how could they fail to last?
Where now the honors of the haughty great?
<!-- page 229 -->Where the strong laws that riveted the state?
Or they that made them, or that by them ruled?
How has stern Time their windy pride befooled!
Whirled them, and sunk them as he swiftly bore,
Or strewed in wrecks on his remorseless shore!
Man's works must crumble; even Art, most strong;
And naught endures but Truth and mighty Song!</p>

<p class="stanza">"Who were High Chancellors in <span class="smcap">Homer's</span> day?
What lordling's chariot brushed him by the way?
What man of power that voice of ages hired
To while a dull hour when his grace was tired?
None answer, while the minstrel's song of fire
Comes to our ears, as from a seraph-choir,
As fresh, as living as when poured the tone
From the blind harper sitting on his stone!
Think you <span class="smcap">Mec&aelig;nas</span> had survived the dead
Had he not linked him with the bards he fed?
Then they were great because the great man smiled,
And drew false fame from him for whom they toiled.
Now, turned the tables, 't is their buoyant lays
Have borne his honors to succeeding days.
You spoke of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, not because of place,
But, spite of it, he won th' immortal race.
Blending all powers, he mastered law and fact,
But 'of imagination all compact,'
To bold invention's loftiest peaks arose,
And was a poet in the garb of prose.
Great statesmen lived, not breathing air sublime,
Howe'er renowned, they perished with their time.
Laws are man's pride; and every praise we yield
The wise who frame them, or the strong who wield;
Needful, like bread, in man's imperfect state
To body politic or corporate:
The means of life; but, health and order found,
What is the end by which the whole is crowned?
The flower of this well-fed and rooted tree?
Oh! need I say it? 't is sweet Poesy!
Who takes our arm in childhood's roving hours,
To lead us wondering through fresh fairy bowers;
Admits, through sunset's golden bars, the gaze
<!-- page 230 -->To inner temples of imperial blaze;
Uplifts the rainbow, a triumphal arch
Sprung over hosts angelic on their march;
Throws us on clouds to bask, or softly slides,
Voluptuous rushing! down then-fleecy sides:
Whose wondrous chemistry transforms the mist
That robes the hills to veils of amethyst;
O'er common objects holds a glass of rose,
And common paths with hopeless blossoms sows;
And shading ruin with her ivy-wreath,
She crowns with amaranth the brow of Death;
Cloaking the scars of evil that we see,
To make things seem as we would have them be.
Always in season, her sweet, constant flowers,
To grace our festive or our mourning hours.
Yes! Poesy was sent to fallen earth
To wake afresh the graces of its birth.
'T is hers to gild refined gold alone,
And 'lilies paint' with hues that quench their own;
Still garlanding young beauty with her flowers;
Still dropping honey on our sweetest hours!
'Mid odors wafting us from birth to doom,
To wake, half-risen to the heaven to come!"</p>

<p class="stanza">"How poor the power of statesmen, sages, kings!
To his whose words, abroad on mighty wings,
(Sun-drawn exhalings of t' eternal seas!)
Rush over nations with their tempest-breeze!
O'ershadowing, thundering, showering in all parts;
Watering the growing graces of all hearts!
That in all moods that range from smiles to tears,
Come humming like sweet birds about our ears;
Drowning our groans, and setting husky sighs
To tenderest music, while our dancing joys
Tread double measure when those pipes do play.
And when poor life is foundering, and gives way,
Like hovering seraphs through the breakers' roar
Pilot the spirit to the tranquil shore!</p>

<p class="stanza">"Above, around, we find no deep recess
Their music reaches not, to rouse or bless;
<!-- page 231 -->Quickening the traveller's step to measure time
Unwearied, with th' imperial march of rhyme;
Cheering brown Toil, and when the day grows dim
Hallowing his musings with their evening hymn.
The infant's lullaby, the mother's prayer,
The soldier's charge, the lover's fond despair
Sweetening the moonlight with his murmuring;
All loftiest soarings from his numbers spring.
The patriot glows that feels the poet's dart
Flaming and piercing, while the pious heart
Mounts in adoring rapture, and high praise
To heavenly portals on his white-winged lays!"</p>

<p class="stanza">The Judge, exhausted, rested from his text
Till cheered with nectar: "Summon <span class="smcap">Flaccus</span> next
Not great <span class="smcap">Horatius</span> of immortal fame:
The modern wit that has usurped his name.
Swift <span class="smcap">Hermes</span> flew by forest, stream, and heath,
At length returning, gasped, quite out of breath,
"I've bawled till hoarse, and vainly, Sire! 't is clear
He's so far down the hill he can not hear;
Or thinks, discreetly hiding from all eyes,
When hail-stones fall to keep within is wise."</p>

"<span class="smcap">Park! Park!</span> art sure? Well, call him! Stay! hark! hark!"
Here thunders muttered rudely overhead.
Great <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span> paused; while <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> rose and said:
"Your Grace must not forget we dine above
On high Olympus, at the 'quest of <span class="smcap">Jove</span>;
And if aright these murmurings I read,
The Thunderer grows impatient&mdash;&mdash;" "True, indeed."
Quoth <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus; "Mercury</span>! we're pressed for time;
Call you the list. We'll score these sons of rhyme.
Nor need they wriggle, should we prick their nerves;
For spice, more sure than blandest sweet, preserves:
Safe in the pickle of our pungent line,
That longest keeps, when strongest is the brine!"</p>

<p class="stanza">"Here's <span class="smcap">Moore</span>!" "Respectable." "Here's <span class="smcap">Smith</span>!" "Pass on!"
"<span class="smcap">Ralph Hoyt</span>!" "His spiriting is gently done."
<!-- page 232 -->"Here's <span class="smcap">Coxe</span>!" "Diffuse." "Here's <span class="smcap">Richard Haywarde</span>!" "Better."
"Here's <span class="smcap">Cheever's</span> florid muse!" "I never met her."
"Next, <span class="smcap">Aldrich</span>!" "Humph!" "And <span class="smcap">Tuckerman</span>!" "Well! well!"
"And <span class="smcap">Stoddard</span>!" "Quaint&mdash;yet blows a dainty shell."
"<span class="smcap">Cranch</span>!" "Paints well." "<span class="smcap">Osborn</span>!" "Shows us in his line
The 'Vision,'* not the faculty divine."
"<span class="smcap">Wallace</span>!" "He's strong&mdash;stay <span class="smcap">Hermes</span>! let us see&mdash;

"<span class="smcap">Fay</span>!" "Not too good." "And <span class="smcap">Mathews</span>!" "Not too bad."
"She-Bards, strong-minded, big with women's wrongs
Come next." "Do n't touch them with a pair of tongs!"</p>

<p class="small">[*The Vision of Rubeta.]</p>

<p class="stanza">Here louder thunderings all the welkin shook.
"Call up the rest of Dr. <span class="smcap">Griswold's</span> book!
At least, all minstrels that from Gotham hail."
On this, there gathered, following <span class="smcap">Hermes'</span> trail,
A motley crew of varied power and grade.
Far down, a group of laggards shout for aid:
"Help, there! good <span class="smcap">Mercury!</span> 't is the toughest hill!
And we're quite blown&mdash;&mdash;" "Who wake these echoes shrill?"
"Sire! these are followers of the camp of rhyme,
Swollen with the wish without the breath to climb;
Some, novelists, that give us no <i>new</i> thing;
Translators some, that nothing with them <i>bring;</i>
Some, wrights of plays; all dullest <i>sport</i> exceeding;
Some, lecturers, whose tasks betray no <i>reading</i>,
Whose fat vocation threatens to command
All unrewarded talent of the land.
All stoop to song when they can time afford;
And feed the Muse with droppings of their board.
As if their crumbs her pride could fail to spurn,
When their choice dishes would her stomach turn!
Rank borrowers these, though that is nothing rare,
For such, somewhat, their laurelled elders are,
Only more cunningly the theft concealing.
Your Grace will pass so light a fault as <i>stealing?</i>"
"We'll pass them wholly!" burst th' indignant god;
"Nor waste on vanity the hopeless rod.
<!-- page 233 -->Let groundlings bend their strength to fitlier things;
Parnassus heights are only won by wings!"
"Pass on! What hungry group now stops the way?;
"Sire! these be wights of larger wit than pay;
Some, care-worn scribblers for th' exacting press,
Booksellers hacks, reviewers, in their stress
Obliged, on hire, applause or blame to utter
At a hard master's beck, for bread and butter;
And some, too noble, 't is relief to think,
To dip their free pens in corrosive ink."
So dense a litter of prolific rhyme,
Parnassus ne'er had harbored at a time:
To whom the Judge: "Forgive unseemly haste!
Most worthy friends! but there's no time to waste.
Some have done well, though here some doubt may rise;
Some ill&mdash;this truth there's no body denies.
Hail! and farewell! we charge you, to a man,
For <span class="smcap">Heaven's</span> sake, write better, if you can!
The Court's adjourned!" At once the Muses raise
A joyous choral in <span class="smcap">Apollo's</span> praise.
The god bows thanks; his dazzling car ascends,
And gives his last charge to his thronging friends:</p>

<p class="stanza">"Bards of the West! your country claims your voice.
Mark how old Europe's hills and streams rejoice!
Happy with minstrels to announce their name
To every passing age, with proud acclaim.
Sound! sound the lyre! 't is <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus'</span> last command:
Grand, ringing rhymes should peal around the land.
Clear the fogged heavens with new thunder-strokes!
Strike with a fire to rend all hearts like oaks!
Mountains are groaning for a lyric name;
Rivers implore the choral wreath of Fame;
Cataracts are shouting for young minstrelsy
To set their roar to music not to die.
Sound! sound the lyre! your heroes, slain too long,
Start from the field to claim new life of Song.
Your brothers' blood calls loudly from the ground.
Sound! ere the martyred ghosts confound you, sound!
Let them not die a second death, more sad,
From lapse of aught your saving art might add.
<!-- page 234 -->Sound! for the land's gray fathers, yet once more,
Whose mighty shadows cloud the Stygian shore;
Launch their proud names on ever-rushing rhyme!
Shrine them in niches to confront all time!

Of song! and hang them on the walls of fame!"</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Apollo</span> ceased, and waved his last adieu!
Seized on the reins, and dashed along the blue.
The crowd, dissolving, scattered down the hill.
Homeward I followed, shocked to witness still
As each, returning, went his usual round,
What poor return the god's good counsel found.
<span class="smcap">Bryant</span> went scribbling "leaders" as before;
And <span class="smcap">Willis</span>, prosy idyls yet once more;
While drowsy <span class="smcap">Halleck</span> laid him in his cloak,
To close the nap the intruding god had broke:
So must advice unrelished be put by!
Once more I turned me to the glowing sky,
Fired by the glory of <span class="smcap">Apollo's</span> car,
O'er sapphire pavement spinning fast and far,
When the rude poker woke me with a clang!
The bubble burst! the coursers diverse sprang!
And through the dazzling fragments, all amazed,
On the tame glory of the grate I gazed!
Who jogged my elbow? Was it goddess fair?
Or Muse to charm me with a chaunted air?
Or <span class="smcap">Ganymede</span>, with nectar held to me?
Only good spouse with cup of homely tea!</p>

<p class="small">BY P. HAMILTON MYERS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baltus Van Kleeck</span> left the world without disposing of that portion
of it which he claimed to own, and when his pretty daughter
Getty became, by operation of law, sole proprietress of several
square miles of the terrestrial globe, without any guardian or man
of business to guide or instruct her in its management, her position
was one of no little embarrassment.  Not that she would have so
regarded it had she been left quite to herself in exercising her sovereignty,
for Getty was an easy, good-natured soul, who said yes to
every body's advice, and to all applications for favors.</p>

<p>Not a tenant but would have had his rent lowered, or his house
repaired, or some privilege granted, or restriction removed, had it not
been for the perpetual interference of Aunt Becky, a shrivelled,
nervous old lady, who was kept in a continual state of excitement by
the fear that her niece would be imposed upon.</p>

<p>"Don't you do it, Getty!" were the words with which she
usually burst in upon these conferences, spectacles on nose, without
waiting to hear the specific subject of negotiation.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what, Aunt," said the heiress, one day, after one
of these interviews, from which the applicant had retired discomfited
by the very first gleam of Madame Becky's glasses, "I must have
an agent to manage these matters, for they are quite beyond my
comprehension.  What with firms to hire, and firms to sell, and

<!-- page 236 -->

stock to be disposed of, and rents to be collected, I shall go crazy; I
know I shall. I must have an agent."</p>

<p>"What for, then, would you have an agent?" said the dame, in a
loud key, scowling meanwhile over the black rims of her spectacles.
"To cheat you out of every thing, and grow rich on your money,
hey?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunt; some good, reliable man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good, reliable fiddlestick, Getty!"</p>

<p>"I say no, Aunt."</p>

<p>"I say yes, child. He will charge you half for taking care of
your property; and he'll run away with the rest. Do n't talk to me
about agents."</p>

<p>Getty had never divested herself of the dread with which, from
childhood, she had regarded her scolding relative, and so, without
fully resolving either to carry or yield the point, she sought to escape
further altercation, at present, by not pressing it.</p>

<p>"But these repairs, aunt," she said, "which are so much needed
for these poor men?"</p>

<p>"It is no such thing! There are no repairs wanted. Why, one
would think the houses and fences had all tumbled down the moment
poor Baltus was gone. It is no such thing, I say. They are well
enough. I have been in every house on the estate within a fortnight,
and they are well enough."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Jones, who has eight children, can't make his rent out
of the farm."</p>

<p>"Let him give it up, then, to some one who can. What <i>business</i>
has he with so many children?"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Smith has lost one of his best oxen."</p>

<p>"He must take better care of his oxen, then. He need not
expect us to pay him for it; I can tell him that."</p>

<p>"But I gave him ten dollars, at all events," replied Getty, not
without alarm.</p>

<p>"<i>Ten dollars</i>, child! Well now, did ever any body hear the
like of that? Ten dollars to that idle, whimpering fellow! Why,
Getty, you will be in the poor-house in a year, if that is the way
you are going on; that you will. <i>Ten dollars!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 237 -->

<p>Becky could hardly throw accent enough upon these two words
to express her appreciation of the magnitude of the waste.</p>

<p>"I dare say it was too much," said Getty, who had always been
accustomed to give way to her imperious aunt, and had not the
courage to disenthral herself from her tyranny, "but he told a very
pitiful story."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! they'll tell pitiful stories enough, if they can only find
any one silly enough to believe them. But I'll see to it that there is
no more such throwing away of Baltus's money. Give me the key!"</p>

<p>Getty submissively took from a side-pocket a small bunch of
keys, and slipping the smallest off the steel-ring which held them
together, handed it to her aunt. No sooner, however, had she done
so than the absurdity of the command and compliance became
apparent to her, and, with rising wrath, she was about to recall her
act, when her eyes met the dark scowl of the old lady, and yielding
to the force of habit, she remained quiet.</p>

<p>Now Becky's conduct, harsh as it seemed, was altogether caused
by excessive anxiety for her niece's interest; for she was, to the
full extent, as honest as she was crabbed. She felt her responsibility
as the only surviving adult relative of her brother, and as a sort
of natural guardian both of the heiress and her estates, a position
which she was by no means desirous of retaining longer than the welfare
of Gertrude required it.</p>

<p>Her only hope of relief from her self-imposed duties was in
seeing Gertrude married to some "stiddy, sober man;" but on this
point she had a morbid anxiety even greater than that which related
to the property; for she was in constant trepidation lest the heiress
should fall a victim to some needy fortune-hunter, in which class she
ranked all suitors who did not follow the plough, and wear homespun.
She even went so far as to question more than one presuming beau
as to his intentions; and one timid young man who had been a whole
month accumulating courage enough to make a first call upon Gertrude,
was so frightened by the fierce manner in which Aunt Becky
asked him what he wanted, that he only stammered out something
about having got into the wrong house, and retreated without ever
seeing the object of his hopes.</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>Strangely enough too, although Getty knew her aunt's conduct in
this instance, and her general asperity toward gentlemen visitors, she
did not seem to resent it, or to be rendered at all unhappy by it;
nay, she was even suspected of rejoicing at so easy a mode of escaping
the persecution of lovers. She was unwilling, however, that the
imputation of inhospitality or impoliteness should rest upon her
family; and on this point she remonstrated with the duenna.</p>

<p>"Let the <i>molly-yhacks</i> stay at home, then," said Becky. "What
business have they to come here 'sparking?' Let them stay at home,
and when we want them we'll send for them."</p>

<p>How and when Harry Vrail's acquaintance with Gertrude began,
it would be difficult to say; but for several preceding years his hunting
excursions had seemed to extend more often through her father's
forests than in any other direction; and the silvery stream which
tinkled across the meadows of Mynheer Van Kleeck afforded the
finest-flavored trout, in Harry's estimation, of the whole country
around. It was natural enough for him, on these expeditions, to stop
occasionally and chat with old Baltus on his <i>stoop;</i> and sometimes to
leave a tribute of his game with the proprietor of the domain on
which it was bagged.</p>

<p>If a string of finer fish than usual rewarded his afternoon's labors
the larger half was sure to be left at Baltus's door, despite all
resistance; and then the servant was to be instructed in the art of
dressing them, and Getty was to be taught the mystery of cooking
them, in the way which should best preserve their flavor.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the fatigued youth could be induced, at the close
of the day, to remain and see if his instructions were properly followed,
and at the bountiful board of the Dutchman, his seat chanced
ever to be beside that of Getty, who saw that he received of the
choicest portions of his own gifts. How she loaded his plate, too,
with dainties drawn from dark closets, the key of which was seldom
turned, save on such occasions as this! How the thickest cream
filled the old-fashioned silver cream-pot to the brim, and was half-emptied
over Harry's strawberries, or on Harry's currants, while with
her own white hand, she pitched the large wheaten slices, quoit-like,

<!-- page 239 -->

around his plate, enjoining upon him in the most approved fashion of
Dutch hospitality&mdash;to eat!</p>

<p>Nor did Harry always find himself sufficiently refreshed to start
for home as soon as the evening meal was finished. From the table
to the long covered stoop was a natural and easy transition, for there
the air was fresh and cool; and while Baltus planted himself, puffing.
in his favorite corner, and his silent vrow sat knitting and musing at
his side, and pussy, unreproved, now dandled the good dame's ball of
yarn in her paws, and now, tapping it fiercely, pursued it rolling far
across the floor; while the swallows darted daringly inside the pillars,
and skimming close to the ceiling, flew chirping out at the farthest
opening, Harry and Getty chatted and laughed together, talking
only on common themes, it is true, yet at times in tones which might
have been mistaken, by one who had not caught the words, for tones
of love.</p>

<p>And there <i>was</i> a time, when yet Harry's father was alive, and was
a man of wealth, that the young man dreamed of love. It was presumptuous,
he knew, in him, even then, to look up to one so fair and
pure as sweet Gertrude seemed to him, and one for whom so many
worthier than himself would be certain to aspire. Yet he could not
refrain from hoping, though with so faint a heart that he never found
courage to declare, or even most remotely to hint at, the love which
consumed him. But if, while he was the prospective heir of great
wealth, he felt thus unworthy of the object of his admiration, how
widely, hopelessly yawned the gulf of separation between them
when positive poverty became his lot! With a pang of unspeakable
intensity, he dismissed the bright vision which had gilded his heart,
and sought no more to recall so painful and illusive a dream.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, while he held himself thus unworthy of
Gertrude, and considered that his changed position precluded him
from the right to offer her his hand, he saw no such obstacles in the
way of his brilliant cousin Tom, now about to enter, with a victor's
stride, upon that field which he had so ingloriously relinquished.</p>

<p>A very young lawyer was Tom; decidedly handsome, and possessing
a moderate amount of talent, flanked by a most immoderate
and inordinate vanity. But, in Harry's estimation, his merits were

<!-- page 240 -->

so many, and his fortunes so sure, that he might almost be entitled to
wed a princess; and although he was incensed, he was not surprised
at the very confident tone in which the young disciple of Themis had
spoken of winning the beautiful Gertrude, if he chose. Harry
thought so himself: he had often thought of it before, and had wondered
why his cousin had never seemed to notice this sparkling jewel
in his path, any more than if it were but common crystal.</p>

<p>But true love, even when hopeless, instinctively revolts at the
idea of seeing the beloved object won by another, however worthy;
and Harry, although not without some upbraidings of conscience, had
carefully abstained from saying any thing which should set the current
of Tom's thoughts in the direction of the great prize he had discovered.
Very great, therefore, was his alarm, when his good grand-sire
had made his abrupt suggestion, and when Tom so coarsely and
ungraciously seemed to approve it. Yet he suppressed his great
grief, and replied truthfully to his cousin's inquiry, failing, in his
abundant charity, to perceive the utter selfishness which had so
entirely overlooked himself, or any predilections which he might
entertain.</p>

<p>He even acceded to his friend's request to accompany him on his
first visit to Getty; not because any formal introduction was needed,
for there had been a slight acquaintance existing between all the parties
from childhood, but because Tom thought it would serve to put
him at once on a better and more familiar footing with the heiress.
And so it did. Getty was delighted to see the cousins, for the lonely
child had few visitors, and she appreciated the kindness which remembered
her bereavement and her isolation. So very amiable and cheerful
did she appear, so naturally graceful and winning, especially when
conversing with Harry, with whom she was best acquainted, that Tom
was positively delighted with her, and on his return homeward, he
announced his fixed determination to offer himself within a week.</p>

<p>"Won't she be astonished?" he said.</p>

<p>"It will be rather abrupt," replied Harry. "She will hardly
expect it so soon."</p>

<p>"Very probable; but when a thing is to be done, the sooner it is
accomplished the better. Beside, it would be scarcely fair to keep
her in suspense."</p>

<!-- page 241 -->

<p>"Perhaps you are right."</p>

<p>"I shall not hurry her to fix the day, you know, but I abhor long
courtships; and these things can be as well settled in a week as in a
year."</p>

<p>"But if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no; a 'but' and an 'if' are quite too much in one sentence.
I tell you I have no fears. She may possibly be engaged to some
boor; but even then, Harry, I think it could be managed; do n't
you?"</p>

<p>"I do not think she is engaged; certainly not to any one unworthy
of her."</p>

<p>"Then we are on safe ground," said Tom, with hilarity. "She
seems a nice girl, and I have no doubt we shall get on capitally together.
She shall soon lead a different sort of life from her present
one, cooped up in an old brown farm-house, with a dragon to guard
her. Won't she open her eyes when we go to the city, and when she
gets into New-York society?"</p>

<p>Harry began to open <i>his</i> eyes a little, a very little, to his cousins'
character; but the force of education was strong, and he had been
taught to believe Tom almost perfect: so his invincible good nature
was busy in meliorating the harsh views which he was at first disposed
to take of his conduct, and in inventing excuses for him.
Beside, he had a strong affection for Tom, which he believed to be
fully reciprocated, and he did not doubt that Getty would inspire him
with the same fervent love which his own heart had once felt, and
even now with difficulty suppressed.</p>

<p>He did not pursue the subject, nor return to it again, excepting
when compelled to do so by the other, whose exuberant spirits ran
wild in contemplation of the fortunate change which he was about to
make in his affairs, and who could not cease to wonder that he had
never before discovered such an obvious opportunity for his personal
advancement. The more he thought of his project, the more deeply
his heart was set upon it, and so bountifully was he supplied with
that quality of mind which Harry most lacked, self-esteem, that he
had no misgivings as to success.</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> has come over you, then, Getty, that you have been sing-singing
all the time, up stairs and down, for these two days&mdash;hey?"
said Becky to her niece, on the afternoon of the second day after the
visit of the cousins Vrail.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing, aunty," said Gertrude, hesitating. "I often sing
like that; do not I?"</p>

<p>"Not often, I hope. I have counted these stitches three times,
and every time your ring-te-iddlety has made me forget how many
there are."</p>

<p>The dame's tone was severe; and as Getty spied the old scowl
taking shape on her forehead, she retreated to her own room to sing
away the remainder of the evening by herself. On the morrow, also,
her heart seemed equally light, and snatches of old songs were escaping
all day from her lips, making every room and closet vocal with
melody, as she flitted through them on various household duties.
Now and then a growl responded to some of these chirpings, silencing
them for a while only to break forth in some other quarter of the
house, more cheerily than ever. As evening drew nigh, her merriment
gradually subsided, and she withdrew to her own apartment in
a more thoughtful and pensive mood not long, however, to remain
unsought. Her heart beat quickly, when, listening, she heard the
voice of a visitor below, and far quicker, when a servant-girl came up
and informed her that Mr. Vrail was in the parlor, and wished to
see her.</p>

<p>Startled but not surprised, with a fluttering heart and a flushed
face, she flew to the glass to add the last touch to the simple adornments
of her person, and, although far from being vain, she could not
forbear contemplating a moment, with complacency, the sweet picture
reflected by the faithful mirror.</p>

<p>She waited a little while for her agitation to subside; for, with
that rapid breath and heightened color, and with something very like
a tear glistening in her eye, she was unwilling to meet her visitor;
but, while she waited, she received another and a more urgent summons.</p>

<p>"You had better come down, Miss Gertrude," said the girl, who
seemed to guess that her young mistress was expecting a not unwelcome

<!-- page 243 -->

visitor; "you had better come down, for your aunt Becky is
getting ready to go in and see the gentleman."</p>

<p>This announcement did not have a tendency to allay Miss Van
Kleeck's excitement, but it hastened her movements, and in a few
moments she was at the parlor-door, which she entered tremblingly,
and not the less beautiful for her fright. Her step had been agile,
but she stopped as if spell-bound just within the door-way, seemingly
unable to comprehend or reply to the very civil "Good evening"
with which she was addressed by Mr. Thomas Vrail.</p>

<p>The changed expression of her countenance, so radiant on entering,
so amazed and saddened now, did not fail to attract the notice of
that young gentleman, who, sagely attributing it to the awe inspired
by his presence, at once condescendingly resolved to re&auml;ssure the
heart of his charmer by his suavity. But, although Getty recovered
herself so far as to say "Good evening," and, after another considerable
pause, to ask her visitor to sit down, and then to sit down herself
on the farthest edge of the chair most remote from her companion,
she did not seem easily re&auml;ssured.</p>

<p>Tom said it was a pleasant evening; and Getty said "Yes," very,
very faintly.</p>

<p>Then Tom said it was a beautiful walk from his house to Miss
Van Kleeck's, and Getty again answered with a monosyllable, but this
time a little more distinctly.</p>

<p>"A very delightful walk," reiterated the suitor, "and one which I
hope I shall have the pleasure of taking frequently."</p>

<p>Miss Van Kleeck, thinking it necessary to say something in reply,
and, entirely failing to comprehend the drift of the remark, "hoped
so, too."</p>

<p>Tom now felt himself to be getting along fast, nay, with very railroad
speed; so he ventured to draw his seat a little nearer to Getty,
to her manifest trepidation, for her eyes turned quickly toward the
door, and she seemed to be contemplating flight.</p>

<p>But it was one of Tom's maxims to strike while the iron is hot,
and if he had been so well convinced of having made a favorable
impression on the evening of his first visit, he felt doubly sure now,
after the new encouragement he had received.</p>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p>"I may be a little hasty, Miss Van Kleeck," he said, again slightly
lessening his distance from her, "but I have had the presumption to
imagine that I&mdash;that you&mdash;that I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please not to come any nearer," said Getty, hastily, as her
suitor's chair exhibited still further signs of locomotion.</p>

<p>"Ah! certainly not, if you wish it," replied the lover very
blandly; "I mean, not; <i>at present;</i> but allow me to hope that the
time will come, when you&mdash;when I&mdash;that is to say, when both of
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom stopped, for Gertrude had risen, and had taken a step toward
the door, with much appearance of agitation.</p>

<p>"I fear you do not understand me," he said hastily.</p>

<p>"I fear I do," she replied quickly and sensibly, "although it is
rather your manner than your words which express your meaning."</p>

<p>"Stay, then, and be assured that I am quite in earnest."</p>

<p>"I do not question your sincerity, Mr. Vrail&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I have come here to offer you this hand," he continued,
extending certainly a very clean one, which bore evident marks of
recent scrubbing for its present service, but which the heiress
exhibited no haste to accept.</p>

<p>She had attained sufficient proximity to the door to feel certain
that her retreat could not be cut off, and her self-possession having in
some degree returned, she listened respectfully, and replied politely,
although with a tone of sadness.</p>

<p>"I will spare you any further avowal of your feelings, Mr. Vrail,"
she began.</p>

<p>"Do not think of such a thing, dear Gertrude," he replied, still
unawakened from his hallucination, "I am proud to make profession
of my love for you."</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me a moment before I go?"</p>

<p>"An hour! a week! nay, for ever!"</p>

<p>"I shall not detain you a minute."</p>

<p>"I assure you I am in no hurry!"</p>

<p>"<i>I am</i>. You are laboring under a mistake. We are nearly
strangers to each other, and you have scarcely the right to address
me in the way you have done; but if it were otherwise I have only

<!-- page 245 -->

to answer by declining your offer," she said, glancing at the hand and
arm which had remained projecting like a pump-handle all this
while, with the evident expectation on the part of Thomas, whose
whole attitude was quite theatrical, that it was speedily to be seized
and clung to.</p>

<p>He now began to look astonished and alarmed, but he immediately
rallied.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see how it is!" he said; "I have been rather abrupt, I
dare say; but we will become better acquainted. I will call often to
see you, and then&mdash;why, Miss Van Kleeck&mdash;<i>do n't go!</i>"</p>

<p>Getty had now become angry. She left the room and her astonished
lover, but paused a moment outside the door, and said, with a
very pretty flush on her cheek, and a very bright sparkling in her eye:</p>

<p>"Call as often as you choose, Mr. Vrail, but I shall never see
you. You do not seem to understand the plainest words, but I
assure you we shall never be better acquainted with each other than
we are now. Good evening."</p>

<p>So saying, Getty almost ran out of the outer room, shutting the
door after her with a haste which gave it quite the character of a
slam, and hurried up to her own apartment.</p>

<p>Tom's panoply of conceit, which was almost invulnerable, and
had withstood so much, only now gave way.</p>

<p>"I really believe she means to refuse me," he said, soliloquising.
"It is certainly very ridiculous; but perhaps she may come back.
I will wait a little."</p>

<p>He did wait some minutes, listening earnestly, and was at length
gratified by the sound of approaching steps, which he advanced to
meet with great alacrity; but what was his consternation on encountering
at the door the wrinkled and vinegary countenance of Dame
Becky, whose huge spectacles, as she stood confronting him a moment
in silence, glowered upon him like the eyes of the great horned owl.</p>

<p>The lover retreated a step before this apparition.</p>

<p>"<i>Do you want Getty?</i>" she said, at length, in a voice amazingly
shrill and sharp.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes, I should be happy to see her a few minutes if&mdash;if
you please."</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>"But do you <i>want her?</i> Do you want to marry her?" she asked,
in still more of a scolding tone.</p>

<p>"Oh! ah! yes, madam," said Tom, attempting to win the old
woman by a fine speech; "I am exceedingly proud to call myself an
admirer of your beautiful niece; and I have indulged the hope that
we might find our tastes congenial to each other, and our hearts sympathetic.
May I count, dear madam, on your influence with Miss
Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"No, you can 't; and more than that, you can 't have her. So,
no more of that. You are the <i>third</i> this week!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! the third <i>what</i>, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No matter what; you can 't have her. You understand, do n't
you?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes," said Tom, "I suppose I do."</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;no offense meant," said Aunt Becky, now
trying to modify what might seem harsh in her language, by a touch
of politeness, but who still spoke in the same high key. "Wo n't
you sit down?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," muttered Tom, now decidedly crest-fallen;
"I rather think it is time for me to go."</p>

<p>"Good night, then," said Becky, following him to the door, as
closely as if he had been a burglar. "<i>Take care of the dog!</i>"</p>

<p>"The deuce!" said Tom to himself, clutching his cane as he
walked off the stoop. "Is there a dog to be escaped too? I should n't
wonder if they should set him on me!" and he quickened his step
down the lane that led to the highway, and was soon out of sight
of the old farm-house, without even turning to take a last look at
the solitary light which gleamed like a beacon from Getty's room.
Alas! alas! no beacon of hope for him!</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Once</span> the Emperor <span class="smcap">Charles</span> of Spain,
    With his swarthy, grave commanders,
I forget in what campaign,
Long besieged in mud and rain
    Some old frontier town of Flanders.</p>

<p class="stanza">Up and down the dreary camp,
    In great boots of Spanish leather,
Striding with a measured tramp,
These Hidalgos, dull and damp,
    Cursed the Frenchmen, cursed the weather.</p>

<p class="stanza">Thus, as to and fro they went,
    Over upland and through hollow,
Giving their impatience vent,
Perched upon the Emperor's tent,
    In her nest they spied a swallow.</p>

<p class="stanza">Yes, it was a swallow's nest,
    Built of clay and hair of horses'
Mane or tail, or dragon's crest,
Found on hedge-rows, east or west,
    After skirmish of the forces.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then an old Hidalgo said,
    As he twirled his gray mustachio,
"Sure this swallow over-head
Thinks our Emperor's tent a shed,
    And our Emperor but a Macho!'*</p>

<p class="small">[*<span class="smcap">Macho</span>, the Spanish for mule.]</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p class="stanza">Hearing his imperial name
    Coupled with these words of malice,
Half in anger, half in shame,
Forth the great campaigner came,
    Slowly from his canvas palace.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Let no hand the bird molest,"
    Said he, solemnly, "nor hurt her!"
Adding then, by way of jest,
"<span class="smcap">Golondrina</span> is my guest;

<p class="small">[*<span class="smcap">Golondrino</span>, in Spanish, means a swallow and a deserter.]</p>

<p class="stanza">Swift as bow-string speeds a shaft,
    Through the camp was spread the rumor;
And the soldiers, as they quaffed
Flemish beer at dinner, laughed
    At the Emperor's pleasant humor.</p>

<p class="stanza">So, unharmed and unafraid,
    There the swallow sat and brooded.
Till the constant cannonade
Through the walls a breach had made,
    And the siege was thus concluded.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then the army, elsewhere bent,
    Struck its tents as if disbanding;
Only not the Emperor's tent,
For he ordered ere he went,
    Very curtly, "Leave it standing!"</p>

<p class="stanza">And it stood there all alone,
    Loosely flapping, torn and tattered,
Till the brood was fledged and flown,
Singing o'er those walls of stone,
    That the cannon-shot had shattered.</p>

<h3 id="c27">The Iron Man.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY HENRY J. BRENT.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>PART I.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Part</span> of the house, or hall, as it was called, was very old, and
the other portion was comparatively new. Its newness would have
been considered very old in this country; and the old part would
have been thought almost eternal anywhere.</p>

<p>This hall was situated on a rising knoll of ground, and overlooked
a meadow, through which ran a glittering stream, and the widest
spreading beeches waved in the almost perpetual breeze that leisurely
and happily came up the ravine. What the owner had built of fortifications
in the time of Bothwell, and Murray, and Mary Stuart,
could, with some aid of the feudal imagination, be traced from the
eastern wing&mdash;that was the oldest&mdash;down to the river's bank. Ivy
had crept, with its deep green family of leaves and tendrils, over the
vague line of conflict wall, and it was not difficult to picture a rather
hard fight along the barrier, between the old chief and some implacable
clan whose remotest ancestor had had his toes trod upon by the
remotest ancestor of the knight of the castle, in the remotest era of
Scotch-hatred tradition.</p>

<p>This old hall was approachable from every point of the compass,
by winding avenues, and all these avenues seemed to have been constructed
with the leading thought that they were to show the enemy
at all points of his approach.</p>

<p>The hall was of red granite, and had its turrets, whence some retainer,
too lazy to work in the fields, could espy the banner of an

<!-- page 250 -->

advancing Highland foray, and could quickly, in most unmistakable
Scotch, arouse the not unwilling chief and his vassals to a skull-cracking
and throat-cutting difficulty.</p>

<p>When I was there, some few years past, peace reigned over this
old Scotch residence, and beauty, throughout the year, hovered over
the mingled colors of the time-stained walls, and over the most
profuse and luxuriant combinations of foliage that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>The weather-tinted turrets rose in the still and beautiful gray air
incident to the climate of that inspiring land, and a solemn repose
pervaded the entire circuit of the scene.</p>

<p>I was an inmate of this dwelling for many years, and my hostess
was one of a peculiarly distinguished name in Scotland. My hostess,
for her husband had died a few weeks before my arrival, was far
advanced in her pathway to the tomb, and grief had bowed the tenderest
heart, the most noble head, that ever decked the divine form of
woman.</p>

<p>Her apartments were in the old wing, and there she loved to sit
and muse over the legends that, in their traditionary popularity and
close connection with general and more enlarged events, positively
made the history of her family an adjunct to the history of the
country.</p>

<p>I had been sitting by the bed-side of my venerable friend, one
evening, and as the shadows came from the western sun we mutually
sank into a state of listless repose.</p>

<p>She lay upon her bed, old and feeble, but full of wonderful
memories. Her dark bright eye&mdash;so bright then, at eighty, and in her
picture, painted when she was but eighteen, and which I fondly keep,
bright as a star, and soft as the sweet air that floats it in the heavens&mdash;kept
its gaze fixed steadily upon me, while her hand firmly held a
bunch of antique keys, about whose history she had been all the evening
talking.</p>

<p>The shades deepened with the hours, and the silence of the room
was only broken by the occasional jingle of those queer old keys,
held in the withered hand of the withering invalid. Now and then
I turned from my gaze upon the purpling mountains that barriered
toward the west the famous lake-region of Scotland, and glanced

<!-- page 251 -->

toward the bed. Those eyes, so dark, so wonderfully intelligent,
met me with such a strange expression that I involuntarily rose from
my seat and moved toward the deep window, to relieve myself of
a growing sentiment of almost superstitious anxiety.</p>

<p>"Will you be so kind as to ring the bell for me?" I rang it, and
soon after her maid entered the room: a prim, gaunt-looking woman,
with long black hair, pressed upward from her temples, and crowded
under a very white and close-fitting cap.</p>

<p>This maid, though almost speechless from respect, in that old
dwelling, and in that solemn servitude, though apparently gentle and
devoted to the singular mistress it had been her duty to serve for
years, was an object always of peculiar aversion to me. Her quiet
footfall, cat-like, through the long corridors, that I heard at night
when all the rest of the domestics were a-bed, often sent a small
shiver through my nervous system, and made me wish that she and
the rest of the ghosts would go to sleep.</p>

<p>Upon the entrance of this servant the lady rose, supporting herself
by both her arms, extended backward in her bed. Her long
white hair fell from her sculptured head upon her shoulders, and as
she lifted her hand, those old keys rattling, she said:</p>

<p>"Lift the carpet from the hearth-stone, and hold a light for
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;." I was standing by the window, and the red light from
distant iron furnaces gleamed over the gloomy landscape, and sent
an unnatural color into the room, deepening the gloom, and bringing
forward the rolls of the old damask curtains, that hung, as they had
hung for years, in almost funereal majesty, around the bed of the
invalid. The maid, after some moments of silent work, drew back
the carpet, and then, lighting a candle, beckoned me to approach.
The mistress placed herself in such a position that she could see me
and also the hearth. I came near, without uttering a syllable of
inquiry, to the spot that had been uncovered, and stood, with no little
anxiety, waiting farther direction.</p>

<p>"Stoop down and see if you can not find, upon that part of the
old hearth-stone nearest to the fire-place, the mark of a black ring."
I examined the stone, and there was, in truth, the mark of a ring
upon it. The ring was about as large as the bottom of an ordinary

<!-- page 252 -->

table-bowl, and was brown and distinct. After I had examined it for
some short space of time, I rose and awaited some explanation of
this demi-pantomime.</p>

<p>"I will ring when I want you," said the sick lady, and the maid,
placing the candle upon an old brass-bound oaken box, that stood in a
remote corner of the room behind a screen, withdrew.</p>

<p>"That is the sign of murder!" were the first words spoken by her
after the door had been closed. She pointed at the brown stain upon
the hearth.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the stain upon the stone; but there is a deeper
stain upon many hereabout than that. That stain was made when a
young girl died, and that stain can never be washed out. They had
better have burned this old wing to ashes than have burned that ring
there; better have burned all their fortunes, and all their liveries,
and coats of arms, and coronets, and coronation-robes, and themselves,
than have burned that little ring upon that long-lasting piece
of stone. It was many years ago when that ring was put there. I
have only seen it once before to-night, and I wanted you to see it too.
It shall never be uncovered after this until I die, and then I hope they
will bury this stone near where the young girl is buried. She is forgotten
long ago, but not so long that I do not remember her, as the
sweetest and gentlest girl in all the broad fields of Scotland. She was
the heiress, through her mother's right, to several of the finest estates
in this section of the country. She was to be their owner when she
should reach her sixteenth year. This property was to have been
hers. Here she lived. She was to be the mistress of the great
property of &mdash;&mdash;, where you have been." (I had spent some days
there.) "Her mother was dead, but her father lived here with her,
he not having any right to the property&mdash;not even a life-estate in
it&mdash;but he managed it for her. She was the only child, and a rich
one she was to be; the richest and the fairest of the land. But she
stood in the path of others. Should she die, the vast wealth that was
to be centered in her, at legal maturity, under the will, would revert
to several poorer relations. The laws of Scotland with regard to
property are strange, and bring about a great deal of trouble, and so
it turned out in this case. I was not a young person by any means

<!-- page 253 -->

when this affair happened; and I remember well how much was
feared always about this heiress. It seemed to be looked upon as a
matter of course, that her life was surrounded with danger. Her
father watched her life with the vigilance of a sentinel. He was a
young man&mdash;young in years&mdash;but old in the calmness and the
apparent coldness of his disposition. He was like a sentinel. He
knew, for he was Scotch, how deep the love of property is in the
Scottish character, and he felt that his daughter was not safe.</p>

<p>He never left his home&mdash;scarcely ever left her. A head-ache,
some little malady, she had, and it went on for a few days, and
turned to fever. The approach of the disorder, its consummation
in fever, the father watched. He sent for the surgeon from H&mdash;&mdash;;
he came; felt her pulse, and went away. Next day, he returned;
still the same symptoms of fever; but she was not ill. Again he
came. She had passed a pleasant night, free from pain, with a regular
pulse. She was better, and she and her father were brighter and
more cheerful. The father had watched her all the time. The news
of her indisposition had got abroad; the people talked of it. When
her fever was at its height, property changed hands, and the poor but
titled relations clutched the big money-bags, and rode over the broad
acres, and had their land laid out for new tenants, and built up the
decayed turrets of their thriftless castles. That evening, when the
surgeon came, she was better, but there was a dread of a return of
fever. Some warm and soothing draught had better be administered.
He felt her pulse. Would that she could have felt his! He took a
common bowl from the table, and made the servant pour some hot
water into it. He stirred his soothing draft in the boiling water.
The father looked on, and then tasted the medicine. The surgeon
watched him in his mind, but looked away and felt the pulse of the
sweet girl, who sat in her easy chair, looking out at those woods
through that window. He gave the cup to the father, and the father
gave it to the daughter, and the surgeon took the cup from his hand.
In drinking it, a portion had run over the brim, and down the sides
of the vessel. Upon that hearth-stone the surgeon placed the cup,
and left. He was not heard of for some time afterward, but it is
strange what happened to him. That night, as he rode home, his

<!-- page 254 -->

horse, it seemed, had stumbled in a hole that had been made by a
fallen tree, and he had been pitched over the precipice, where the
yew-tree is&mdash;your favorite seat&mdash;and his body was swept away by
the river. It was picked up a month afterward at the Broomielaw, in
Glasgow. That cup was a cup of poison; but though all the force of
law was brought to bear upon the investigation; though there existed
no doubt as to the parties who had paid, or had promised to pay, the
murderous surgeon, still they avoided a conviction. Whether it was
wealth, the vast wealth, at stake, and that could only go to them, that
prevented detection, or staid the avenging arm of Justice, I do not
know; but her death was called a death produced by the malady
under which it was known she had been for some days suffering. I
never saw her father afterward, for he left the country, and it was
said that he removed to America. I think it very likely. I heard
that he never spoke to any one of his plans, but kept all his sorrow,
and his agony, and his intentions, locked in his own breast. I heard,
also, that he married again in the New World. He was never liked
in the neighborhood, although no one knew why he was unpopular.
I always thought him a very intense man where his daughter's interest
was concerned; but otherwise he was cold and secluded, almost
forbidding. Whether it was that none of the succeeders to her property
liked to live here or not, I can not say, but so it was. This
estate was offered for sale, and my mother bought it. It was beautiful
then, and you know how much we have improved it. But, my
dear H&mdash;&mdash;, while we have made the roses bloom all around the
house, and built additions to it, and have made the fields green, and
got the trees in the park to be finer than any in Scotland, we have
never been able to wash away the poison-mark of murder from our
favorite room. Good night! I will try and sleep."</p>

<p>I took her hand and kissed her saintly forehead. She gave me
the bunch of keys, to put away in her desk, and having rung the
bell for her maid, I left her.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He</span> is a rich man, but he is a cold man; he is cold as marble.
He never smiles. He does nothing but sit in his library, they say
and look out upon the sky. His son is at sea, and his wife is dead;
and he might as well be dead as alive, for all the good he does. He
never attends public meetings, never votes, never was seen at a public
dinner or at a private one; and all that he does do is to sit in his
room and look at the sky."</p>

<p>Thus spoke one of a small circle of gossips in the sitting-room of
an inn in one of the Canadian cities.</p>

<p>"They tell me," said another gossip, "that he is a queer man, but
that he does something else beside sit in his room and look at the
sky. They say he goes round among prisoners in jail, from curiosity,
I suppose, and that he reads to men condemned to die for murder.
His face looks as dark and as grim as if he had bagged with Burke,
in his native Edinboro'."</p>

<p>"How do you know that he came from Edinboro' in particular?"
inquired another of the group.</p>

<p>"Because his servant-man says he told him yesterday that he was
going back to Edinboro' in a few days, and that he was going to
break up here, for good; and that's news that won't grieve any body
but the jail-birds."</p>

<p>Up and down the room, up and down another room, back and
forth, now looking at the sky, through the windows, now on the floor,
never stopping for a moment, restless, anxious, sorrowful, sorrowful,
with tears upon his cheek, tears in old channels, worn when the night
was down, dug when he was alone, all alone, poor fellow!</p>

<p>How white his face, how white his hands, and how his hair is getting
white, too! Up and down, with ceaseless step, all alone! How
perfectly all alone! He mutters to himself, he prays, and now at
last he stops and looks at his watch. It seems to be the moment for
some expected guest to arrive. Yes, it must be so, for he goes to the
door and opens it, and looks out into the passage.</p>

<p>The hall-door is opened, and the expected guest approaches the

<!-- page 256 -->

room, and enters. The eyes of the restless host are no longer wet
with tears: they are dry and hard and cold.</p>

<p>"Have you brought me that trinket, Captain, and the hat and
walking-stick, you spoke about yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I have, and they must have reached here before this, as I sent
them up by one of the sailors before I left the ship."</p>

<p>The master of the house rang the bell. A servant entered, to
whom he gave orders to have whatever things had been brought from
the vessel carried up stairs, to his son's apartment. The servant
looked for a moment at his master's face, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary for you to remain long in port?"</p>

<p>"Not over two days; and then I sail for Liverpool. My cargo is
nearly all stored, and I wait but your orders to name the day when
we shall leave."</p>

<p>"Then in two days we will sail. I will send for you to-morrow,
as I shall have to make arrangements with you regarding some private
matters. Good evening!"</p>

<p>The visitor bowed himself from the room, and closed the door.</p>

<p>In an instant, all was changed in the manner of the man whom
he had left alone in the chamber. The cold and frigid muscles
relaxed. The step, a few moments before so formal, became quick
and nervous. The eyes that had so suddenly dried, were wet again.
The brows were no longer knit together in forbidding gloom, but
expressed the wrinkled workings of some great internal agony. Up
and down the apartment he paced for a few moments, with that same
tread, whose sound seemed to syllable the sentiment of grief. Only
for a few moments, for he quitted the room, and mounted the stairway.
How slowly now he mounts the stairs: how slowly he places
his foot upon the landing; and how wearily, as if weak, exhausted
totally, he approaches a door that fronts him on his right! His hand
is upon the knob. He turns it and enters. Could that marble face
have been seen then, what a spectacle would it have presented!</p>

<p>"Utterly, hopelessly liveth that man," we would have said. "Keep
from him laudanum, the loaded pistol, and the razor! Keep him from
himself, for the love of <span class="smcap">God</span> and his angels!" He is in the room; a
trimly-finished room, with a single bed in it, and many comforts; a

<!-- page 257 -->

small library, foils hung upon the walls, old boxing-gloves placed
carefully upon the table, an ink-stand, with a pen lying by its side,
a book of travels open upon the desk, that stood by the favorite window,
the chains and collars of dogs, a portrait of the man who had
just entered the room, and a female portrait, too, both hung so that
the owner of the room could see them when he first wakened in the
morning. On the dressing-table was a golden locket, a plain straw
hat, with a broad black ribbon round it; and, leaning against a chair,
was a fragile cane, capped with some fancy head. Down into that
chair this gloomy man threw himself. He reached out his hand, and
grasped the hat, and then he held it to his lips; and while the tears
fell rapidly, he kissed it over and over again. The cane he kissed,
and then he sat moodily, with his eyes fixed upon the wall, where
hung the boxing-gloves and the foils. No one entered that room after
him, but there he sat until the sun, bathing the whole west, sent its
farewell glory into the apartment, and seemed, as it were, to summon
him. He rose and knelt by the bed, and then, with features fixed as
the everlasting granite, he left the room and descended the steps.</p>

<div class="center">

<h4>PART III.</h4>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> I took him those things, he was just as cold as a piece of
ice. I wonder if he has any feeling. I wonder what he is going to
do with those things. Most men would have asked me some further
questions about that affair. <span class="smcap">God</span> knows he can't blame me, though I
believe he hates me, and I am afraid to be left alone with him. I
do n't understand him. He does not deal as other men would in such
matters; but whenever I see him, he talks about his business matters;
what the cargo will bring him; when his other vessels will
reach port; what the price of goods is in every section of the world,
as if he was going to send his ships to the Arctic ocean, to trade in
icebergs."</p>

<p>Thus spoke one of two sea-faring men, in a small back-parlor in
an inn in the Canadian city which I have alluded to before. The
speaker was a man of rough exterior, blunt, and in all points a complete
old sea-clog. The tempests had tanned his cheeks like sheets

<!-- page 258 -->

of parchment, or something more tough, and there were evident indications,
throughout the whole man, that marked him as a stern and
unflinching performer of his peculiar range of duties. His companion
was the captain of another ship, owned by the individual with whom
the former had just held the short interview, already described.</p>

<p>"Well, he is the strangest man." said the second, "that ever
crossed my bows. Not one word of inquiry after the health of the
crews, or how they are fed and treated, but down he must go himself
to the ship, and in and through every place about he dives; and,
though he docs not seem to notice any thing, I am sure nothing
escapes him. He is close-fisted, but, I will say, just; and if there is
wrong anywhere, he will correct it if he can, and with his own property
he generally can and does. But you promised to tell me about
that affair of your last cruise. Go on with your yarn, and let's have
another glass of whisky hot."</p>

<p>When the whisky was brought in, the sea-captain lit a segar, and
between his smoking and his sipping, told a story in effect like this:</p>

<p>"We had as good a ship as ever floated on the sea, and we had as
good a cargo as ever was borne over the sea by a ship. Part of the
cargo was a large supply of flour, about which I had particular directions.
I was to deliver it to a certain house at Greenock, and I was
to tell the head partner of the house that this flour was not for sale;
that was all I knew about it, though I think now, as I thought then, it
was intended to be distributed among the suffering poor of some district
of the Highlands. He has never said a word to me about the
cargo.</p>

<p>"Well, we sailed out of Quebec, and had fair winds for three
days, when, all at once, the sky lowered down with heavy clouds, and
every thing seemed to indicate an approaching and a severe blow:
and it did come, and for two days we bore up against it, though
almost every hour found us in a worse condition to fight out the next.</p>

<p>"I had several passengers with me, and among them was the son
of the owner. He was a tall, handsome youth, nothing in him like
his father, except some slight resemblance of manner. I loved the
boy, and the boy loved me, and every body seemed to take to him.
He mixed freely among the men; most of them he had known a long

<!-- page 259 -->

time, as sailors, sailing his father's ship, and whom he had met on the
wharves whenever the vessels returned to port.</p>

<p>"His father had intrusted him to me, with special instructions to
be careful of him, and to see that he was safely left at one of the universities
in England. He was going abroad to finish his education.</p>

<p>"Well, the storm kept on, and, instead of diminishing, it
increased. Squall after squall struck her, and though every thing
was done to relieve the ship, I found that things were getting worse,
and finally a leak was discovered away down in the hold. The water
poured in faster than we could pump it out, and indeed we could
with difficulty work the pumps at all, owing to the constant pitching
of the almost ungovernable vessel. To make a long yarn short, we
were floundering away, with the pumps going, the winds blowing big
guns, and the waves pitching like mountains of solid granite put into
motion, when the helmsman was washed from the wheel; and before
another could take his place, the vessel fell into the trough of the sea,
and all was wild confusion and horror.</p>

<p>"I maintained sufficient command, at that terrible moment, to
have some of my orders obeyed. The boats were ordered to be lowered,
and when one had touched the water, the crazy sailors and passengers
rushed to it, and for an instant, when it was filled, it floated on
the back of a huge billow, and then was swept away into the foam,
and was seen no more. It had filled with water, and down it went,
with its cargo of screaming and blaspheming souls.</p>

<p>"The next boat fared better, and I had only time to get the remainder
of the passengers, two only beside the boy, and some of the sailors,
into it, when the ship went down into the deep sea, with a plunge
like a wild horse when he is shot.</p>

<p>"We escaped the pool made by the ship's going down, and, with
the greatest difficulty, we got the boat properly trimmed, and though
surrounded by a perfect seething of broken waves, we managed to
keep upon the surface.</p>

<p>"We had not a mouthful of any thing to eat on board, for we had
no time to secure a morsel from the stores, so sudden was the necessity
to take to the boats, and so short the time to accomplish our
rescue.</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<p>"Two days and two nights wore away, and we drifted about the
ocean without a compass and without a sail. Another day passed
over our heads and we began to be afraid to look at one another.
Thirst and hunger were turning us into tigers. The owner's son sat up
my side at the helm, and leaned his head upon my knee. He slept
most of the time, except at intervals, when he would waken up and
look, with a bright eager eye, far over the waste of the inhospitable
sea, and then he would gaze upon the miniature of his father that he
wore around his neck. I saw what was coming. We were dying of
thirst and hunger, and there was no hope. A few hours might delay
the catastrophe; and a few hours only did delay it. It began with
low whisperings and mutterings among the sailors, and then it broke
out into loud oaths and fierce gestures. Each man seized what way
nearest to him as a means of defense. The oars were raised from
the water, and held in the air like war-clubs, and the boat drifted
about, heedless of the helm, which I still held in my almost powerless
hand. I had placed a couple of loaded pistols in my coat-pocket
before we left the ship, and when I feared that I would have to prevent
some mutinous spirit at a moment when disobedience would
have been destruction to all; and these I guarded with a feverish
care, lest they might be seized upon by some wretch in his extreme
despair, and used as the means by which food could be obtained in
that awful hour of our starvation. I saw that a crisis in our lives
was at hand, for the low murmurs had grown into unmistakable
expressions, and at last a demand was made for human flesh. One
must be killed to feed the rest.</p>

"The skeletons were going to do murder for food, and yet one
human feeling beside that of hunger remained within them, that I
did not know of, positively, then; but subsequent events, speedily
following, revealed it to me.</p>

<p>"It was inevitable! one man among the gaunt and starving crew
must die; but who was to be that man 1 That was a question which
might possibly be determined on the instant where one man was
stronger than the other, and only two were in our lorn condition; but
when there were many, and none stronger than the rest, the matter
became one of terrible difficulty.</p>

<!-- page 261 -->

<p>"I determined to act on this hideous emergency, knowing full well
that sailors are subject to the spirit of authority from long subjection
to its practical exercise, and seeing that there was no escape from the
result, for I swept the horizon in vain for some signal of approaching
succor, I prepared to draw lots. Then arose the other startling and
thrilling question, Who shall arrange the lots? There was not much
time for argument, and so they agreed, after a moment's pause, that
I, their captain, should hold the fates in my hand. I tore a piece of
paper into as many strips as there were men to draw, and held them
in my hand. All drew, and the owner's son drew the fatal lot. He
was perfectly calm, although the youngest and the brightest-hoped of
the whole party, and seemed to yield at once, without a murmur, to
the horrid fate that in an instant awaited him. Then there sprang up
a discussion among the starving crew, and they declared that the lots
should be drawn over again: they would not have their favorite
slaughtered. I arranged the pieces again, and to my horror and surprise,
the youth again drew the fatal slip. Once more the crew, now
doubly excited, with their grim, famished faces staring at me, swore in
perfect madness that the youth should not die, and ordered me, with
savage gestures of insane fury, to draw again. I saw that I was to
do a duty beyond their wishes. I felt the terrific responsibility that
rested upon me, and it required but a few seconds to make up my
mind what Course to pursue. All was despair around me; all was
hopeless, utterly, and, I thought, eternally hopeless; and I felt that
I would not die with the crime of human partiality and injustice upon
my soul.</p>

<p>"I agreed to hold the lots again; and when I had arranged them, I
said that the youth must be excluded from the drawing, and for that
purpose told him to step forward to the bow. He rose to obey me.
I remember his thin figure standing between me and the bright line
left by the departed sun against the horizon of the heaving sea. One
instant, and one instant only, did he stand thus elevated like a living
cross, with his arms outstretched to balance his tottering steps, when
he fell forward into the arms of the excited sailors. I had shot him,
as he stood thus, determined to end the conflict for blood that was
raging around me, and satisfy the generous and noble-hearted sailors,

<!-- page 262 -->

whose lives were not dearer to them, in that hour of supernatural
honor and supernatural horror, than the gentle sentiments of love
toward the boy they had known so long.</p>

<p>A few days afterward, a vessel picked out of the trough of the
sea a boat with three men, lying, half-drowned, upon its bottom. I
was one of the three who had survived the bloody feats by which
several were killed, and only we had survived.</p>

<p>"I had taken the miniature from the neck of the boy, and the cane,
his father's parting-gifts, and his straw-hat I also preserved, for I felt
they would be dear to the unhappy man at home. When I took
them to him, he ordered them to be carried to his son's room; and
not even then, or before, when I first arrived, did he say one word to
me of censure or approval. I do not feel that I have done wrong, for
<span class="smcap">God</span> knows it was a hard and unheard-of condition we were all in."</p>

<p>After the captain had finished his story, he rose from his chair and
left the room. We may be sure there was no more whisky-punch
drank by the other captain, who was left, half-bewildered, standing
alone in the apartment.</p>

<div class="center">

<h4>PART IV.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> years had passed away. My relative had died, and I
had been living some time in Paris, when business-letters reached me
from the lawyer in Edinburgh who had charge of her estate, that
compelled me to relinquish my studies, and hasten over to Scotland.</p>

<p>When I reached Edinburgh I went directly to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s office,
and after going through some necessary forms of law, placed the
affairs of the property, so far as I was concerned, in a way of settlement.
As I was rising to return to my hotel, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; begged me,
instead of taking my dinner at the solitary little table in the coffee-room
of the inn, to come and dine with him at six o'clock. I readily
accepted his invitation.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the public-room of the Royal Hotel, gazing with
untiring admiration at the various points of view from the window;
the old Castle of Edinburgh, upon its rocky eyrie, overlooking a
glorious panorama of mountain, ocean, frith, and far-extended fields,

<!-- page 263 -->

waving up toward the regions of the lakes. Like a gallant soldier,
wounded in battle, his head crowned with laurels, his limbs shattered,
lay this beautiful and wonderful city before me; for part of it is
fresh and new, and the rest ruined and withered by time and the
elements. I could linger in description, forgetful of my story, but I
did not undertake to describe the outward characteristics of Scotch
scenery, but to delineate the not uncommon qualities of the people
of that country.</p>

<p>My attention was somewhat distracted by the entrance of a man
into the room. He threw himself into a chair; and it struck me,
though at the moment I was not observing him strictly, that he
sighed as he took his seat. I was not so hardened by the usages
of the world, or so indifferent to the phenomena of human idiosyncrasy,
as to let such a thing escape my reflection, and I turned more
fully to observe the stranger. He was, I should think, about sixty
years of age, tall and meagre. I felt no farther curiosity to examine
his person or his dress, after I had once seen his face. There, stamped
indelibly, were marks that time had had nothing to do with. Age
has its wrinkles by right; its furrows are made as if it were to let
the streams of life have passage to the great ocean of eternal rest.
Youth has its furrows too, by wrong; planted there by premature
crime, by premature suffering, by unhappy love, or morbid hope.
The face before me had doubtless been, in its youth, eminently
beautiful; but of that description of beauty to be found in the
bust of Brutus the Tribune, and seldom seen on Scotch shoulders.
The hair was black, but thickly sprinkled with gray. There
was an undying look of valor in the whole expression of the countenance.
It was not the look of the bully, or such as we would suppose
belonged to the soldier; but it expressed a moral courage, such as
martyrs wear when they die for truth, or suffer for the right.</p>

<p>While I was engaged looking at him, he took a letter from his
pocket, and, after hastily reading it, he rose and advanced to the
window through which I had been looking prior to his entrance. I
could well imagine how that earnest soul might be affected by such a
scene as met his view. He stood for several minutes at the window,
and I could observe, by that intuitive faculty common to all men, but

<!-- page 264 -->

not always recognized at the moment, that a deep gloom constituted
the chief element of his meditations, as he looked out upon the scene.
Looking at my watch, and finding it approaching the time that I
should be at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, I ascended to my room to dress for dinner,
as I had some distance to go to reach my friend's house, he living in
the country. I told the waiter to have a carriage at the door when
I should get through with my toilette. When I descended, the
stranger was standing at the front door. I simply gave directions to
the waiter to tell the coachman where to take me. The stranger
turned upon me abruptly upon hearing the name of my friend, and I
thought he was upon the point of addressing me. If that had been
his intention, he relinquished it upon the instant, and without farther
delay I entered the carriage and drove off. After I had been seated
with my friend some moments in his parlor, and the usual inquiries
and answers had passed between us, he smiled and said, "I have some
thing curious to show you to-day&mdash;an old friend; not that old
friends are curious; but really, a man whose history and whose
character will amuse and puzzle you. I want you to see him before
I tell you who he is, and what he is. You are a little in advance of
the dinner-hour, like all your countrymen, but he will be here exactly
to the moment, for all Scotchmen and Scotch watches are wound up
to go and stop at the same moment."</p>

<p>As my friend had predicted, the door-bell rang at the instant,
and the stranger of the coffee-room entered. There was a mutual
look of recognition between us, and a positive sensation passed
through my mind&mdash;a dim and mysterious thought which informed
me that I had heard the whole history of this man before. So much
so that I arose, upon the gestures of introduction, with warm and
growing sympathies at my heart for him.</p>

<p>My friend's family consisted of his wife, a daughter, some sixteen
or seventeen years of age, and a son, who was just down from one of
the universities to spend the vacation at home. It is not necessary
to enter into the details of the dinner, which came on and went off
with the usual incidents of such gastronomic events. The conversation
turned, and was continued throughout the repast, upon the very
recent revolution in Paris, which I, a foreigner, had had the singular

<!-- page 265 -->

good fortune to witness. Though my recitals of the daily scenes of
that chronic phase of French politics, seemed to interest my host and
his family, they appeared to have little effect upon the other guest.
Interested as I was in the circumstances I was relating, I was
mysteriously, and, despite myself, more interested in that consolidated
embodiment of moral and physical revolution that sat directly
opposite me. There seemed to be a tacit understanding with all the
parties present, myself included, though I knew not why, that nothing
should be said that was not general in its character. Though I knew,
from a slight incidental remark, that my host and his friend had only
met that day after a separation of years, I was not surprised at
their making me and my experiences topics of unflagging conversation.</p>

<p>In due season the dishes and the dessert were removed, and then,
the ladies retiring, left us to our wine and ourselves. There was an
uneasy pause after the ladies had left us&mdash;an almost embarrassing
silence. My topics were exhausted. It seemed as if they mutually
agreed that I could no longer, by any miscellaneous gossip, keep
them from some positive allusion to the past. Our host filled his
glass with claret and passed the decanter to me.</p>

<p>After I had filled my glass, I naturally pushed the wine across the
table to the stranger, when the attention of my host and my own was
riveted upon him. His head was bent upon the table. We could
not see his face, but we saw that his muscular hands were clenched
together, and his shoulders heaved up and down with convulsive
motion. Where his temple was exposed to our view, I saw a rapid
movement as of blood coursing to his brain. This lasted but a moment.
The face of the host, too, had undergone a change as suddenly;
tears stood in his hitherto happy and jovial eyes; his lips
quivered, and he arose from his seat, and, approaching his friend,
placed his hand upon his head. There sat that stern, apparently
unsympathizing man, his whole system heaving with some long-suppressed
and all-overmastering emotion; and over him the lawyer,
accustomed in chamber and in court-room to scenes of suffering arising
from outraged justice, or terror from detected guilt, now quivering,
weeping, at his own table, at the mere spectacle of a depressed head

<!-- page 266 -->

and a convulsed frame! I have described the features of the stranger,
when in their calm; but when he raised his head from the table, a
change the most singular had taken place. That undying valor,
almost stubborn in its expression before, had died away; the beauty
of his youth had returned to him, with almost feminine loveliness.
Looking up at his friend, he said:</p>

<p>"I can endure it no longer: for years and years, James, I have
kept this to myself, but now I must yield. To-day has brought back
to me scenes that I have only remembered at midnight in tears. I
could not bear to make my sorrows common. I could have borne it
to-day, if I had not come here to this house. I bore it when I first
met you, my oldest and my dearest friend. I bore it when the world
cried murder, and she perished unavenged; when her assassins took
possession of their blood-stained gains; when I left the land of my
birth, and the home of my youth, and went among strangers to live
and toil, toil for my boy, to give him wealth and station such as his
sister would have had. I bore it, and took a pride in keeping my
sacred agony to myself, when I heard that to appease the famine of
some of my shipwrecked sailors, my son was shot. I bore it when I
looked again upon the land I had so long left, but never had forgotten;
but I could not bear it longer when I saw your wife sitting happily
by your side, as my wife used to sit by mine&mdash;your daughter
smiling, as my poor child used to smile, and your son, just from the
college to which mine was going&mdash;all there were too much. I have
been called an iron man&mdash;a man almost dead to human feeling; but
you, who have known me, must have known it would come to this at
last,"</p>

<p>He finished speaking, and after a short interval, we returned to
the parlor. The iron armor, once thrown aside, seemed as it never
could be resumed, in the presence of his old friend's family. Long-smothered
emotions of his heart appeared to well up from him as if
his nature had received an invocation. Although that remarkable
countenance still wore the traces of long suffering, there beamed over
it a pervading recognition of long-sought but just-discovered sympathy.
I will not attempt to analyze in the exact crucible of philosophical
chemistry the various dispositions that characterized this man.

<!-- page 267 -->

There are few persons who have not met with similar individuals,
whose conduct in their human out-door walks has been at total
variance with their human in-door feelings. The only thing that I
esteem strange in all that I have related, is the singular train of co&iuml;ncidental
events, beginning with the small ring upon the hearth-stone of
my relation's bed-room, that had expanded into larger circumferences,
embracing years and distant countries; and then, after having encircled,
by so many extraordinary events, the destinies of people differing
so totally in pursuits and purposes, finding its concluding movement
near the same spot where it had commenced. It is ill-becoming in
us, with our limited knowledge, to set ourselves up as judges of
human character; for here, in an especial manner, was a man entirely
misjudged, since it was not long before I was informed by my friend
the lawyer, that he had been the agent of the most bounteous charities
imposed upon him by this Iron Man.</p>

<p>The ignorant traveller, entirely uninstructed in the truths of natural
history, upon first beholding the peaks of the Alps, shrouded in their
everlasting mantles of snow, would little dream that in the vales
beneath ran musical streams of summer water, and emerald meadows
spread their velvet cloaks, dappled with the clustering rose-bush, and
the sun-loving flowers of the gardens of the tropics.</p>

<h3 id="c28">The Death of Ulric.</h3>

<p>A FRAGMENT FROM THE LAST CANTO OF "<span class="smcap">Ulric</span> , OR THE VOICES."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY THEODORE S. FAY.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following fragment is the concluding canto of the second unpublished part of a poem
written in 1846 and 47. The first part appeared under the name of "<i>Ulric; or, the Voices</i>." There
is a period of ten years between the two parts. <span class="smcap">Emmeline's</span> son, <span class="smcap">Fritz</span>, has grown into a youth of
nineteen. In rather a strong contrast to the present state of the eastern continent, where a new
crusade appears being organized, not against, but in favor of Islamism, the Ottoman government,
after possessing itself of the most beautiful and celebrated countries of the ancient oriental
world, conceived the ambitious design of subjugating Europe to the faith of the Prophet.
Weakened and distracted by civil wars, the Christian princes might well tremble to behold Constantinople
the seat of the Sultan, and the Crescent advancing to Venice, Vienna, and Bavaria.
<span class="smcap">Solyman</span> II., furious at his defeat by the knights of St. <span class="smcap">John</span>, in the island of Malta, had invaded
Hungary with a powerful army, and laid siege to Sigeth, the bulwark of Styria against the Turk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulric</span> had promised to join his standard to that of the noble Count <span class="smcap">Zerrini</span> (according to a custom
of those days) whenever the Turkish forces should again threaten Europe. He reached
Sigeth with his forces just before the formidable army had approached its walls. Both <span class="smcap">Ulric</span> and
<span class="smcap">Zerrini</span> believed that the European <span class="smcap">Maximilian</span> II., who lay in the neighborhood with an army
not inferior to that of the besiegers, would at least attempt its relief; and on the supposition that
so noble an enterprise would be almost certainly victorious, and would open a brilliant career to
the son of <span class="smcap">Emmeline</span>, he had taken him as one of his aides. Arrived at Sigeth, it transpired that
the Emperor had resolved <i>not</i> to aid the city; and death now stared in the face of every one
within the fatal walls of Sigeth. The canto opens at the moment when <span class="smcap">Zerrini</span> and <span class="smcap">Ulric</span> had
adopted the desperate expedient of cutting their way out. This celebrated action of <span class="smcap">Zerrini</span> is a
well-known historical incident. The Turks left 30,000 dead on the field. <span class="smcap">Solyman</span> died during
the siege. His successor granted <span class="smcap">Maximilian</span> a twelve years' truce. <span class="smcap">Zerrini</span>, as the poem
relates, fell while cutting his way out of the fortress.]</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Hark</span>! hark! the thunder! not of Heaven,
But that which Hell to earth has given.
        Hark! peal on peal resound!
Where the hot battle fiercely burns,
The cannon's fiery fury turns
On Sigeth's gate. Hark! madly tear
Each crash along the broken air.
Death and destruction madly glare,
        And shake the affrighted ground.</p>

<!-- page 270 -->

<p class="stanza">And 'mid their solemn anthem rise,
Troubling the soft astonished skies,
Deep howls of hate, and yells of pain,
And shrieks of death that pierce the brain,
And fiends discordant glee,
And clashing steel and oaths of rage,
Vain prayers beneath the sabre's edge,
        And shouts of victory.
Amid the rout Hell's master stood,
And saw his work, that it was good.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ha! will the wreaths, slow-rolling by,
Of heavy smoke, for ever lie
Upon that group, and veil its fate,
Which issues from the castle gate?
Now wafts the breeze the rising cloud:
On! on! their foes around them crowd.
Hark! <span class="smcap">Ulric's</span> voice, like trumpet loud,
        His lagging men to chide.
Forward his sable courser springs,
And his dread sword, which terror wings,
As 'gainst each flashing blade it rings,
        Drips with the crimson tide.</p>

<p class="stanza">With him, what warrior, fiercely bright,
Cuts his way onward through the fight?
It is <span class="smcap">Zerrini</span>, and between,
Half 'mid the battle's fury seen
That bold boy-hero! How would start,
O <span class="smcap">Emmeline</span>! thy mother's heart,
        If, with unhelmed brow,
'Mid cannon crash and gory stream,
And whistling ball and sabre gleam,
As in some dark delirious dream,
        Thou couldst behold him now;
Couldst mark how near each hot ball hissed
That cheek thy lips so oft have kissed;
And how each sabre's deadly blow
Would deep have cleft that laughing brow,
But for one arm whose watchful blade
Ever like lightning round him played,
        Intent from harm to shield.
<!-- page 271 -->If once, amid that iron rain,
Yon broken bridge their steeds can gain,
They're safe&mdash;yet no! They strive in vain,
        'T is their last battle-field.</p>

<p class="stanza">But look! hurrah! new shouts resound!
Their foes give way, and bite the ground,
And like some strong uprooted oak,
        Contending with the blast,
Slow yielding to the tempest stroke,
Now wavering 'mid the billowy smoke,
That torn and flaunting Crescent look!
        Stoops to the dust at last.</p>

<p class="stanza">There, 'mid the battle's wildest storm,
Erect, <span class="smcap">Zerrini's</span>  glorious form
        Uptowers like a god.
With shout, resounding wild and far
Above the mad discordant war,
He cheers his men, "On! on! hurrah!"
But, now, St. <span class="smcap">Steven</span>! to the ground,
Borne, like the stag, by fierce blood-hound,
Overwhelmed with many a mortal wound
He falls, our eyes no more to greet,
Crushed 'mid wild horses' iron feet,
        A trampled, broken clod.</p>

<p class="stanza">On! on! mid shout and dying groan,
Now <span class="smcap">Ulric</span> and the boy are down!
But no! they rise: o'er heaps of slain
Forward their snorting chargers strain;
The masses break apart again.
        Their foes, they reel; they fly!
With their sharp swords they cut their way,
Uninjured, through the reckless fray.
The bridge! the bridge! they gain the day!
        "On! death or victory!"</p>

<p class="stanza">Oh, gallant <span class="smcap">Fritz</span>! not yet, not yet!
Beware that furious, hot onset,
With flaming eyes, together four
Against thee rush. One struggle more!
<!-- page 272 -->Thrice the sharp sabre to thy brow!
Thrice <span class="smcap">Ulric's</span> swift hand wards the blow&mdash;
Wards and avenges well&mdash;for low
They lie who struck. Each recreant dies!</p>

<p class="stanza">The last survivor, panting, flies;
But e'er his Arab steed he pressed
He turned to aim at <span class="smcap">Fritz's</span> breast
        One winged ball of hate.
Now, <span class="smcap">Ulric</span>! speed! In Sultan's flank,
Deep, deep the spur, encrimsoned, sank,
        Alas! too late! too late!
He sees his sword, so swift and keen,
All useless now, but rides between,
        With one convulsive bound;
And then the flash, the smoke, the shout,
The clear report rang sharply out,
The deadly messenger he feels;
Starts sudden, in his saddle reels,
        Then sinks upon the ground!</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Fritz</span> springs to save him! sees, oh <span class="smcap">Death</span>!
Thy heavy hand! Thy failing breath,
        Thy smothered groan of pain!
To stanch, he strives, the bubbling blood,
Outgushing in a swollen flood,
        A dreadful task, and vain.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Oh, general! Oh, fatal strife!
For mine thou gavest thy precious life!
        The ball was meant for me!"
"That flying fellow sent it home,
His aim was good; my hour hath come&mdash;
        My hour of victory."</p>

<p class="stanza">And now from <span class="smcap">Fritz's</span>  white cheek flowed
The hue, that all the battle stood;
        And dropped his blinded eyes.
"Oh, fatal, fatal day!" he said,
As o'er that brow the death-damp spread;
<!-- page 273 -->And still streamed forth the purple tide;
"So late, aloft, I saw him ride,
In all life's grandeur and its pride;
        Now, here he lies."</p>

<p class="stanza">Yes, yes, in death the warrior lay,
Each moment ebbed his life away,
The helm unloosed, the forehead bare,
Upraised to <span class="smcap">Heaven</span> in silent prayer.
Then gently spoke: "Dear <span class="smcap">Fritz</span>, no, no,
'T is vain, 't is vain; let&mdash;let it flow!
Weep not for me. Death is no theme
For weeping. It most sweet doth seem
    To yield my breath.
Oh! nothing in this world hath been
So slandered, with thy friendly mien,
Thy face, so hopeful, so serene,
    As thou, oh <span class="smcap">Death</span>!"
"Sweet, pitying <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>! my heart will break!</p>

<p class="stanza">"My breath, it fails; poor Sultan take
My parting gift, and for my sake
Be gentle with him, <span class="smcap">Fritz</span>; and when
Thou reachest Rudolstadt again,
And ridest him, all joyous, on
Through wood and vale, o'er hill and lawn,
    Each sylvan path I see!
The mossy steep, the silent wood,
Look! how the yellow golden flood,
The very spot on which we stood,
    Bid her remember me."</p>

<p class="stanza">"Oh, dearest friend! oh, gracious <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>!
His senses wander&mdash;&mdash;"
                        "I have striven,
Not all in vain, and now the spell
I break at last. Sweet boy, farewell!
Thy hand! I die&mdash;all cold&mdash;all dark!
My blessing to thy m&mdash;&mdash;. Hark! hark!
They call! what bright forms round me gather!
Ha! yes; my blessing to thy <i>father!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p class="stanza">Oh <span class="smcap">Death</span>! how beautiful, how still!
As if some sculptor's wondrous skill,
Out of the cold and lifeless stone
That noble warrior form had hewn.
Over the marble features stole
A light, as rose the parting soul,
And then, descending o'er the plain,
Floats softly an angelic strain
Of voices airy sweet, that seem
A loving thought, a tender dream.
It lingers not, that passing choir,
But slow recedes, and rises higher,
Fainter and fainter; now it dies,
Uncertain, in the farthest skies.</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Ulric</span>, farewell! Thy painful task is done,
Thy battle with the Prince of Hell is won.
Faith's narrow path thy child-like soul hath trod,
Thou hast believed, obeyed, and worshipped <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p class="stanza">And thus a Christian spirit, free at last,
Beyond the reach of wearying sin hath passed,
From its hard warfare with Hell's potent might;
Good against evil; darkness against light.
Victorious o'er the world, its sorrows ended,
And through Death's gates by angel forms attended.</p>

<p class="stanza">And thus, oh reader! whatsoe'er thou art,
Or high or low, or rich or poor, thy part,
Thus, in its hour, thy spirit, too, may rise
From earth's short sufferings to the happy skies,
If thou but care to choose aright between
The curse and blessing of this lower scene;
If thou but mark, as by <span class="smcap">God's</span> help we may,
Hell's filthy laughter, as thou go'st astray,
And the clear voices calling thee again,
With many a secret tone and thrilling strain,
Voices, perchance, now floating, faint and far,
From some light cloud or quiet gazing star.
While now, with trumpet tones, they burst and roll
Up from the depths of thy eternal soul,
<!-- page 275 -->Oh mortal! listen to them. Learn to know
Those earnest voices, whencesoe'er they flow.
Watch for them! Listen! Mark them and obey!
Follow not thou the Evil One's soft way,
For all his art can give. When, at thy side,
He stands and whispers thoughts of lust and pride,
From his vile spells, by prayer thy spirit free,
And break away, how sweet soe'er they be.
For sweet, oh <span class="smcap">God</span>! they are, and his old throne
Too firmly set for thee to move alone.
Oh, sorcerer! full many a wondrous charm
He knows to banish doubt and hush alarm,
Thy eyes to veil, and so to sway thy thought,
Clasped in his arms, thou still believest not.
All bright things of the earth, oh! mystery!
Are sometimes lent, his instruments to be;
Nature's fair visions, music, moonlight, love;
All that they will may captivate and move,
Soft vales and mountains, summer-days and flowers.
And golden hopes that wing youth's airy hours,
Science and taste and intellect refined,
The noble heart and the aspiring mind,
The fatal trust in conscious innocence
Whatever wakes the soul, or wins the sense,
There lies the dark foe mid the roses curled,
But <span class="smcap">One</span> alone can overcome the world.</p>

<p>A STORY OF KASKASKIA.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY J. L. M'CONNEL.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>LE MA&Icirc;TRE A DANSER.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaskaskia</span>, (properly written <i>Cascasquia</i>,) founded, according to
the best authorities, about 1688, by the good Father Allouez, is probably
the oldest settlement on the waters of the Mississippi. For
a long time the head-quarters of the French in the Great Valley:
successively a military post of some importance, and the capital of
the growing State of Illinois, it possessed, for many years, the distinction
of a frontier metropolis; but its site was chosen without
regard to that geography which ultimately develops its own <i>foci;</i>
and every new farm opened in the country hastened the decay of
its factitious prosperity. A few miles in any direction from the true
focus are sufficient to seal the obscurity of the most promising
town; and he who fortunately pitches his cabin upon the converging
point of the lines of commerce may safely await the lapse of time,
secure that his corn-fields will eventually become city-lots, and his
modest dwelling give place to palaces of trade.</p>

<p>In accordance with this geographical principle, as the country to
the northward was settled and improved Kaskaskia decreased in
importance; and, as St. Louis began to emerge into the light, the
shadow of her wings deepened the growing twilight around her elder
sister. The removal of the seat of government withdrew the only
remaining element of prosperity; and, in 182&mdash;, the period of our

<!-- page 278 -->

 story, the venerable old town was rapidly subsiding to her natural
 level of obscurity.</p>

<p>On a bright June morning, in the year last mentioned, a woman
of thirty-five or six sat at the bow-window of a house in the decrepid
old town. Like the little capital of which it formed a part, the tenement 
"had seen better days;" for it was somewhat dilapidated now,
and wore that threadbare aspect which distinguishes most men who
have fallen into the same lamentable category. The gloom which
attends decay was, however, in some degree relieved by the cheerful
notes of two or three song-birds that hung above the woman's head,
and the fresh green vines which tenderly concealed the ravages of
time. The occupant herself did not disturb the harmony of character 
which made the place so pleasing to the eye; for the scrupulous
neatness of her dress was apparently designed to compensate for
plainness of material; and though the touch of years had evidently
been upon her figure, the memory of its youthful contour yet
lingered in its well-preserved and flowing outline.</p>

<p>The street upon which she looked was a straggling thoroughfare,
that seemed to have been formed by a tumultuous and disorderly
recession of the crowd of many-gabled houses. As the whole town
was quaint, dingy, irregular, and crumbling, so the street was of no
particular width, full of odd corners, crooked, interrupted, and not
very well swept. But also, as the town was cheerful, vine-clothed,
redolent of flowers, and jubilant with the songs of unnumbered birds,
so the street was vocal with the silvery voices of bright-eyed and
half-naked children, who played merrily with whole packs of sleek
and worthless but good-natured curs; while fat and delighted <i>grand-m&egrave;res</i> 
gazed smiling from the open windows, on the gambols of their
bare-legged posterity. Gay, light-hearted groups passed to and fro
along the crooked passages, and black-eyed girls in <i>dishabille</i> flashed
flittingly from house to house, or, singing sweetly as their charges, fed
troops of gayly-plumed Canaries, or vied in liquidness of tone with
that full-blooded Frenchman, the mocking-bird. The morning sun
streamed down the openings, and gilding rusty porticos, and penetrating 
tangled vine-clusters, sharply defined the peaked shadows, and
poured in golden richness into open casements.</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>All Kaskaskia seemed in a joyful mood that morning, save only
the solitary occupant of that window, who contemplated, absently and
sadly, the animated scene before her. The antic gambols of the
lively French children called up no smile to her patient face: she
even slightly turned her head while merry groups were passing; and
once or twice, in the very midst of loud bursts of laughter, she rose
from her seat and slowly crossed and re-crossed the room. At each
turn she paused for a moment to listen at a door opposite to the window. 
No sound came forth, however, and at last she resumed her
seat with an air of weariness which seemed to forbid her again leaving 
it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she done so, when a quaint little figure, in a rusty
but well-brushed black coat, and a very large beaver hat, frisked
round the corner of the house, and paused in the attitude of a dancing-master, 
beaver in hand, directly before the open window.</p>

<p>"Ah! Madame Lefrette!" he exclaimed, in a voice of delighted
briskness, and with a salutation whose profundity he would have.
equally devoted to peer or peasant, lady or laundress, "<i>Bon jour,
Madame!</i>"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Maillefert," the lady quietly returned, and
was about to add some further common-place ; but the vivacious little
Frenchman would not allow it.</p>

<i>"I sall see you at <i>mi f&ecirc;te</i> this night, Madame, <i>certainement?</i> Eh?
You come?" he broke in rapidly.</i>

<p>"I fear not, Monsieur," she replied.</p>

<p>"<i>Non? Pourquoi? Pardon; eh?</i>"</p>

<p>"My husband is quite ill," she said.</p>

<p>"<i>Est-il malade?</i>" he interrupted. "<i>C'est mal; vraiement!</i>"</p>

<p>He pondered a moment, as if feelingly contemplating her affliction; 
but suddenly lifting his head, he na&iuml;vely exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Mais, Madame,</i> who sall <i>chaperon La Belle Marie?</i>"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she replied with a smile, "that Marie will wish
to go. If she should, however, shall I place her in your charge, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>A bow of profound obligation, and a broken speech, expressing
his deep sense of the honor, was all the overpowered artist could

<!-- page 280 -->

produce, before a light footstep and a silvery voice announced the
entrance of Marie herself.</p>

<p>A gleam of the yellow sunlight which bathed the street in front,
would not more suddenly or cheerfully have illumined the room.
The sweet songsters who occupied the cage above her mother's head
enriched the air with no mellower or clearer notes; no foot in Monsieur
Maillefert's dancing-school was lighter, no figure more graceful,
no eyes brighter, no face more beautiful. Light auburn hair, clear,
dark-blue eyes, a nose of Grecian truth, and a mouth combining all
the attractions of pearl and ruby; a throat as full, and neck as flexible
as the dream of a sculptor; shoulders white and round, with a
bust as faultless as the statue of the "Slave," completed the beauty
of a face and form as perfect as ever wore the youthful graces of
sweet seventeen.</p>

<p>She was arrayed in a loose though neatly-fitting morning-dress
of cross-barred muslin, white as the lily. This was confined at the
waist by a silken cord of pale pink hue; around her neck was tied a
narrow velvet ribbon, of the same becoming color; and her hair was
simply dressed in the fashion of the time, with a band and flowers.</p>

<p>Her appearance was the signal for the recommencement of the
little Monsieur's universal salutations, elaborate and profound, as
if given to a whole ball-room, marshaled for the dance; and in his
twinkling black eye there was a ray of light which showed that age,
though now approaching his fiftieth year, had not deprived him
of the Frenchman's greatest pleasure&mdash;admiration of female beauty.</p>

<p>"<i>Souhaits le bon jour, Ma'm'selle!</i>" he exclaimed with all the
artist's grace, as she came to the window, and received his salutation
with a smile which would have revived one of his nation, though he
were in the article of death.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Maillefert has called to inquire whether you will
attend his <i>f&ecirc;te</i> this evening, Marie," said her mother, "and I have
placed you under his protection."</p>

<p>"I am sure no better <i>chaperon</i> could be chosen," said Marie,
smiling in reply to the repeated bows of her whimsical protector;
"but how is my father this morning?"</p>

<p>"He is sleeping," her mother answered, glancing at the door at

<!-- page 281 -->

which she had listened, "and, though he passed a somewhat restless
night, he now seems much better."</p>

<p>"What time will you call for me, then, Monsieur?" she asked.</p>

<p>"At seven, Ma'm'selle, <i>exactement;</i>" and, gallantly touching his
lips with his fingers, with another flourish of his beaver, he took his
leave, and went on tip-toe up the street, by far the happiest man in
all Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>"Sit down here for a few moments, Marie," said Madame Lefrette,
pointing to a seat beside her own. Marie obeyed without speaking;
and while the daughter leaned upon her mother's lap, and the mother
placed her arm caressingly across the daughter's shoulders, both
gazed in silence for some minutes at the cheerful scene before them.
The elder was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Marie," she said, drawing the girlish form nearer to her bosom,
as if to compensate the harshness of a duty with increased affection,
"if you go to Monsieur Maillefert's <i>f&ecirc;te</i> this evening, I must warn
you against an error that I fear you are falling into."</p>

<p>Marie looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>Do n't alarm yourself," her mother continued with a smile; "I do
not apprehend any great danger&mdash;to you, my dear; but you are
young and impulsive, and may thus unconsciously do a very great
injury to another."</p>

<p>"I? Why, mother mine, what can you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, my daughter," said her parent, gravely, "that at M.
Maillefert's you will probably meet Coron de Cheville."</p>

<p>Marie's eyes fell as if a blow had been threatened her, and the
blood mantled in a deep blush to her very temples, while her frame
trembled as the young alder in a wandering wind.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to give you pain, Marie," her mother continued,
placing her arms about her neck; "but the circumstances of your
position render it necessary that I should guard you against an error
of manner which may be fraught with evil to yourself&mdash;and others."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do, mother?" she asked, without
raising her eyes, which were now ready to overflow.</p>

<p>"Nothing but what your own good sense will teach you. Receive
him courteously and kindly, but <i>not</i> warmly. Let your father's faith

<!-- page 282 -->

be kept, by showing him that you are willing to accept his <i>friendship</i>,
but will not encourage one step that leads toward the forfeiture
of any obligation."</p>

<p>"I am sure, mother," she said, hastily lifting her head, "if he
knew it he would not take such a step, however much encouragement
I might give him."</p>

<p>"Is it possible you have left him in ignorance, Marie?"</p>

<p>Again she dropped her eyes, and was silent.</p>

<p>"Well, well, my daughter," she resumed, replacing the arm,
which for a moment she had withdrawn, "I will not reproach you.
It is not too late, I hope. Let him know your position without delay.
It will be better for all parties. And now, I must go to your father.
You will have some preparations to make, and"&mdash;after a pause&mdash;" I
hope we may never have occasion to return to this subject."</p>

<p>She turned away as she spoke, and entered, the sick-chamber of
her husband, leaving her daughter occupied with reflections the most
unhappy her young life had yet known.</p>

<p>The "circumstances" referred to by the mother are essential to
our story.</p>

<p>Among the French customs which the shifting of population and
consequent change of social manners had not entirely abrogated, was
that of affiancing children in their infancy&mdash;a blind, pernicious system
of anticipation, which mortgages the Future to the mercenary
wants or conveniences of the Present, and plants the seeds of superfluous
immorality, whereof spontaneous growth is sure to yield a
sufficient harvest. In accordance with this custom, Marie had been,
in her sixth year, affianced to young Napoleon Le Vert, then a youth
of ten summers, the son of M. Lefrette's partner in business. During
the eleven years which had since elapsed, each had been reared and
taught to look upon the other as the companion of the future; and
though, after reaching those years which gave them a place in society,
neither had shown much attachment to the other, the only effect of this
indifference had been to conceal the knowledge of their <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i>
from their acquaintance, or to let it die to their remembrance; for
the parents of both still viewed the contract as irrevocable.</p>

<p>This arrangement had been ratified&mdash;perhaps suggested&mdash;by

<!-- page 283 -->

Marie's grandfather, who, although at this period some years dead,
must figure modestly in our narrative. He was a Virginian, who had
emigrated to Kentucky with some of the foremost pioneers, when
that country belonged to the venerable "Old Dominion." Having
made a settlement, and, by proper charters, secured the territorial
rights which accrued upon the act, his roving spirit had led him to
Kaskaskia. Here he became enamored of, and soon married Josephine
Le Vert, a young Frenchwoman, the sister of the elder M. Le
Vert, of our story. Lingering for some months, attracted by the
primitive simplicity of the people among whom he found himself
domesticated, a daughter was born to him; and this daughter was the
mother of Marie Lefrette. As soon after this event as his wife could
endure the journey, he returned to Kentucky. But, upon searching
for his land, he found that the man whom he had left in possession
had sold the most valuable portion of it, under a claim which he had
set up by virtue of actual residence! To add to his discomfiture,
on examining his papers to find the original grant to himself, he discovered
that that was lost or destroyed! The books of records,
which might have supplied its place, had been either burnt or carried
away by the Indians in some murderous foray; and all muniments
of title were thus obliterated.</p>

<p>He resorted, however, to the desperate expedient of a suit at law,
endeavoring to show that the grantor under whom the occupants
claimed, was a tenant, and could not be allowed to deny his landlord's
title. But no lease could be produced; indeed, he had for
gotten whether a lease was ever made; and, in the absence of any
paper to support it, his suit failed, and his land was lost. Soured and
disgusted, he returned to Kaskaskia, where, at the age of fifteen, his
daughter was married to Monsieur Lefrette. Of this marriage, the
only issue was our Marie, whose grandfather lived just long enough
to confirm her <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i> with the son of his brother-in-law, claiming
the Episcopal right of confirmation in virtue of his will, which made
her sole heir to the lands he had lost!</p>

<p>By these possessions, which might just as well have been "castles
in Spain," no body save the poor old man set very great store; and
the fact that Marie's father was a large stockholder in various land-companies,

<!-- page 284 -->

and was accounted rich, (prospectively,) probably had
more influence in inducing the elder Le Vert, who was supposed to
value good lands higher than good hearts, to seek the betrothing of
his son with his partner's daughter.</p>

<p>One other character noticed, and the story may march on.</p>

<p>Coron de Cheville, a young man two or three years the senior of
Marie's <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, was a descendant of M. Rocheblave,* the last French
governor of Kaskaskia. Having inherited a moderate fortune, he
had, to some extent, enjoyed the advantages of travel, and of an education
which this country did not then afford. At the age of twenty-four
he had returned to his native town, and now divided his time
about equally between Kaskaskia and St. Louis.</p>

<p class="small">[*<span class="smcap">Whose</span> wife, on the taking of the place in 1778, by Gen. George R. Clarke, concealed or
destroyed all his public papers; and by the loss of many grants and charters, was the cause of
infinite confusion in land-titles.]</p>

<p>Mingling freely in the unconstrained society of the former place,
he could not fail to meet Marie Lefrette; and, just at that age, when
all such impressions are more vivid and definite than at any other, he
was at once attracted by her beauty, grace, and simple refinement of
manner. Ignorant of her engagement, he prosecuted a series of delicate
but unconcealed attentions, which, in a circle more thoroughly
organized, would have been at once set down as indications of a desire
to make her his wife. Even here, observations had been made upon
his assiduity, in so much as to excite the jealousy of Napoleon Le
Vert, Marie's intended husband&mdash;a young man of morose and
haughty temper, who, although incapable of loving any thing very
deeply, was yet, of all men, most likely to resent what he superciliously
deemed a trespass. Nothing but Coron's self-control, and the
manly contempt he felt for the other's boyish demonstrations, prevented
a collision; for, we are bound to say, the conduct of Marie,
guided only by her feelings, and tempered by no respect for Napoleon's
half-formed character, was not calculated to avert it. She took
little pains to conceal her preference for the free and open bearing of
the former to the arrogant and sullen manner of the latter; probably
reflecting, if she ever thought seriously of the matter, that she would
have quite enough of his vapors after her marriage, and willing, while

<!-- page 285 -->

she was yet free, to obey an impulse, of whose whole force she was
ignorant. It was this imprudence against which her mother warned
her.</p>

<div class="center">

<h4>II. MONSIEUR MAILLEFERT'S FETE.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Maillefert's</span> house was situated almost in the heart of the
town, but was surrounded by a garden carefully and elegantly cultivated,
and containing, perhaps, two acres of land. Overlooking this
on three sides was a broad, wooden corridor, which contained more
space than lay within the walls; though the omnipresent vine, which
hung in masses from the eaves, and clambered, richly laden with the
choicest flowers, up every column, and along the balustrade, inclosed
it from the sun and rain almost as effectually as the rude carpentry
which marked its inner limit. The whole edifice looked as we might
imagine a Chinese pagoda, which had been crushed toward the earth
by a steady pressure from above; not falling into ruin, but expanding
horizontally in proportion as it subsided vertically. Its peaked
gables and projecting eaves; its triangular attic windows, and broad,
low doors; its "sway-backed" roof and narrow flights of steps, all
encouraged the illusion. But the presence of an elegant and ornate
taste, everywhere visible in the arrangement of flowers and the training
of a thousand creepers, fenced out the idea of decay; while the
merry notes of the little Monsieur's fiddle, heard from within, or the
cheerful tones of his bird-like voice, banished all gloom, and peopled
the rooms with gayety.</p>

<p>In those old days, when a morose and mistaken puritanism had
not given dancing to the devil, and then denounced it for belonging
to him, the dancing-master was no unimportant personage, at the
worst; and on this great occasion&mdash;the closing <i>f&ecirc;te</i> until the cooler
weather of the autumn&mdash;the moral stature of the character was not
diminished. When M. Maillefert, proud of his charge, as a young
emperor of the conquest of a capital, marched up with Marie to the
gate, the little crowd assembled there respectfully gave way for him
to pass, but affectionately closed in upon his heels, and followed him
within the house.</p>

<p>A narrow hall ran through from front to rear, dividing a large

<!-- page 286 -->

saloon and a suite of rooms; and these, notwithstanding their low
ceilings, unlevel floors, and bare walls, presented an appearance quite
elegant and imposing. The planks had either been diligently rubbed
smooth for the purpose, or worn so by the friction of many feet.
Garlands of evergreens, and wreaths of flowers, and quaint devices
made of various leaves, adorned the window-frames, or drooped
gracefully between; while bouquets and choice single flowers were
scattered on the unobtrusive little tables, or strewed along the divans.
Green branches of the delicate pine were fixed against the wall, as
brackets to support the numerous lights; and the radiance of these
was a-tempered, not diminished, by the veil through which it was
filtered.</p>

<p>As the company entered, little negro girls, with their wide mouths
full of ivory and fun, attended to receive the hoods and mantles, while
two boys of the same shining sable were already "tuning up" their
fiddles. These were the Monsieur's musicians; pupils of his own,
whose proficiency reflected as much honor on his musical ability as
the graceful dancing of the active 'demoiselles, upon his standing as a
master of the "art of motion."</p>

<p>One long, complaining cry from both instruments, to try their
tone, and then a sudden shifting to the rapid notes of a dancing tune,
"put life and mettle" in the expectant company. The little Monsieur
led his partner, Marie, to the head of the saloon, and at his signal the
figures were speedily filled up. His shrill voice was now heard from
end to end, and, as if instantly affected by some volatile gas, the
whole array began to move with as much agility as art, and more
grace than either. Round and round, to and fro, up and down, the
dancers went; the flashing of light drapery, the wreathed smiles of
pleasure, the flitting of fair forms through mazy order, and the
changing lights and shadows, furnished forth a scene of animation far
more common then than now. The tripping of light feet, the exhilarating
music, the hurried chat and merry laughter, pervaded with a
careless gayety the perfumed air; while the hurried <i>alto</i> of the <i>ma&icirc;tre</i>
shot, like a sunbeam, through the mazes of the figure, and illumined
all with the light of discipline and order.</p>

<p>The rooms gradually filled up with old and young; and many a

<!-- page 287 -->

fat little dame danced with her eyes, though she might not with her
feet, and gazed in envy on the figures, remembering her own gay
days of youth. The fathers of the village, too, were gathered in;
and boys and girls, who now impatiently awaited the coming of that
time, whose passage they were destined to regret. After the first
"set," the master, having given the example, consigned Marie to
another partner, and devoted himself to the comfort and enjoyment
of others. Cool, light beverages and delicate spicy-cakes, were
passed about from time to time by the little negroes; and, at eleven,
a supply of strong hot coffee, accompanied by viands more substantial,
was served to every guest.</p>

<p>While the dancers were standing in their places, to do honor to
this favorite stimulant, two gentlemen advanced from the line of spectators,
and approached the spot where Marie was chatting with her
partner. The younger of these, who was a rather handsome man of
perhaps five-and-twenty, with an air of quiet grace and thorough
good breeding, pressed the hand which Marie timidly extended him,
glanced for a moment at the rapidly-changing color in her face, and
then introduced his companion a tall, middle-aged man, with the
keen look of an attorney.</p>

<p>"Mr. Beman," said De Cheville, "informs me that he knew your
grandfather, in Kentucky, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," interrupted the elder, with a somewhat elaborate bow,
"desired this introduction as much on account of his grand-daughter's
own attractions, as of her relation to his old friend."</p>

<p>Marie inclined her head rather coldly; for she was somewhat
shocked at the breadth of the opening compliment; but hastened to
say, as if conscious of the ungraciousness of her manner:</p>

<p>"I am always glad to meet any one from Kentucky; and my
mother will be happy to see you at our house."</p>

<p>"He was just asking me to take him thither," said De Cheville,
"when I told him you were here."</p>

<p>"And justified his ardent praises," added Beman, with a laugh,
"by pointing you out."</p>

<p>De Cheville glanced at Marie with a conscious blush; but she
turned away her face, to cover a confusion, which, however, gave him

<!-- page 288 -->

more pleasure than a look of frank directness. At the same moment,
the tap of the bow upon the fiddle announced the re-commencement
of the dance. Coron had only time to make a hurried engagement
for the next figure, and retire with his companion from the floor, when
the master's voice again set all in motion.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Napoleon Le Vert&mdash;a young man who
might have been called well-looking but for a certain fullness about the
corners of the mouth, which invariably indicates a hot but selfish temper&mdash;pushed
rudely through the crowd, and forced Marie to pause in
the movement.</p>

<p>"Shall we dance the next figure together, Marie?" he asked in a
tone which sounded more like command than request.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to Monsieur de Cheville for the next," said Marie,
timidly; "but the following one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am engaged for that, myself," he interrupted, and abruptly
turned away. A flush of anger rose to her face; but, without otherwise
noticing his rudeness, she recommenced the dance.</p>

<p>It so happened, that she had been arrested very near the place
where De Cheville and his companion had taken their stand among
the spectators; and, though the former did not overhear the words of
the brief conversation, he comprehended the pantomime sufficiently
to see that Napoleon was uncivil and offensive, and that Marie was
distressed. His blood boiled with indignation. He was about to
intercept and accost Le Vert, when the latter pushed past, and roughly
jostled him, evidently on purpose. Coron put out his hand and
stopped him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by pushing me thus?" he asked, in as calm
a voice as he could command.</p>

<p>"If you are so dull as not to understand it," answered the other,
"perhaps you will know what <i>this</i> means!" And he struck him on
the cheek with his open hand.</p>

<p>The insult was scarcely complete, when De Cheville seized him
by the throat, and, jerking him from his feet, pitched him headlong
through the open window upon the corridor. Beman grasped his
arm, and the crowd rushed forward to interfere; but, shaking them
off, he sprang through the casement, almost upon the prostrate Le

<!-- page 289 -->

Vert. Two or three of the men hurriedly followed him; but, before
they could interpose, Le Vert had risen, bruised and bleeding, and,
with the spring of a cat, buried a knife in De Cheville's side! The
latter reeled for a moment, but recovered himself; and, as the blow
was about to be repeated, grasped his assailant's arm, and, wresting
the knife from his hand, would have sheathed it in his bosom. But
now came a rush of men, accompanied by the clamor of many voices;
and, at the same moment, Coron's hand dropped, his eyes closed, and
he sank lifeless into the arms of his friend Beman.</p>

<p>"He is dead!" shouted the latter. "Seize the murderer!"</p>

<p>The crowd swayed to and fro, and, in the obscurity, several persons
were arrested; but Le Vert was nowhere to be found. Marie,
with several other ladies, without knowing the cause, were involved
in the confusion, unable to ascertain what had happened, until she
heard Beman's exclamation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Who is dead?" she asked, but without
eliciting an answer, until some one clambered into the window, and,
after looking out upon the corridor, turned to announce</p>

<p>"It is Coron de Cheville!"</p>

<p>A scream rang through the saloon, of such intense and sudden
agony, as to silence the clamors of the crowd; and, dashing both
hands against her temples, Marie reeled, fainting, to the floor! Monsieur
Maillefert raised her, placed her tenderly upon a divan, and
called frantically for water. While it was being brought, he stood
disconsolately wringing his hands, and repeating, in a voice of ruin
and despair:</p>

<p>"<i>Ah! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mi f&ecirc;te is spoil! mi f&ecirc;te is
spoil!</i>"</p>

<p>The women clustered about the prostrate girl, and, dashing water
into her face, soon brought her back to partial consciousness. She
sat up and looked, bewildered, about her, unable to recall the meaning
of the scene. But, when some one came in from the room where
De Cheville had been carried, and said that the doctor pronounced the
wound dangerous, but not mortal, she threw herself into the arms of
the woman who knelt beside her, and burst into tears, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Thank <span class="smcap">God</span>! Oh! thank <span class="smcap">God</span>!"</p>

<!-- page 290 -->

<p>Monsieur Maillefert now bustled forward, as if suddenly recollecting
himself, and said:</p>

<p>"<i>Ma'm'selle, votre m&egrave;re</i> have send <i>un</i> messenger in ver' mosh
hurry&mdash;I take you, then?"</p>

<p>"A messenger!" exclaimed Marie, lifting her tearful face. "For
what?"

"<i>Ma'm'selle</i>, I know nothing," the master replied, with a shake of
the head, which, however, contradicted his words.</p>

<p>"My father! My father!" she cried; and, springing to her feet,
hastily put on her mantle, and, taking the master's arm, hurried
eagerly homeward.</p>

<p>Her fears had been but too well founded. Her father, whose
illness had been considered serious by no one but his wife, had grown
suddenly worse. The physician had been called, and, by his direction,
Marie was sent for at once. It was impossible, he said, that
Monsieur Lefrette could survive the following day; and, though he
made no such admission in words, it was plain that the sudden turn
in the disease took him as much by surprise as it did Marie herself.
He was not mistaken now, however. His patient lingered, free from
pain, until near noon on the morrow; when, without a struggle, he
passed from life.</p>

<p>Two days afterward, the kind-hearted people of the good old <i>ville</i>
attended his remains to their last resting-place; and, having done him
this final service, turned away toward home, speculating upon the
extent of his widow's dower, and the amount of his daughter's inheritance.
The prevailing opinion was that Lefrette had died wealthy;
and if the supposition was based rather too exclusively upon his
part-ownership of certain company land-grants, whose value lay chiefly
in the future, this fact only served to rebut one argument against the
hypothesis, by accounting for the plain manner in which the deceased
had lived.</p>

<p>Mr. Beman, who walked homeward with a knot of gossips, listened
to the discussion in silence; but, on learning that all these castles
were founded upon stock in the "&mdash;&mdash; Land and Emigration Company,"
incontinently broke into a loud laugh, which not a little scandalized
his grave companions. He gave no reason for his mirth, but,

<!-- page 291 -->

turning aside, down a quiet road, drew a bundle of papers from his
ample pocket. Of these he selected three, and opening the first, as if
to assure himself that he had not laughed too soon, glanced with a
recurring inward chuckle, down the ample folio pages.</p>

<p>Folding this carefully, he opened in succession the other two, and
read them gravely from end to end. Replacing the whole in his
pocket, he turned upon his steps, and walked slowly back into the
quiet town.</p>

<p>The first and most amusing of these papers was a full and complete
assignment of all the effects, "goods and chattels, lands and
tenements, rights and credits," of the aforesaid "&mdash;&mdash; Land and
Emigration Company;" setting forth, in elaborate legal verbiage, that
their title to certain tracts, upon which their speculations were based,
had been declared invalid by the courts, and providing as effectually
as possible for the safety of certain creditors, by declaring a trust in
their favor, and appointing Beman assignee. Then followed a short
inventory of property, and a long list of creditors; and the footings
showed a very large balance on the side of insolvency! A ruin more
complete and irretrievable never overtook a company or individual!
No whisper, however, of the failure had ever reached Kaskaskia; and
among all who had curiously speculated upon Beman's business there,
none had ever approached the truth. The lawyer, himself, had as yet
kept his own counsel.</p>

<p>The nature of the other papers, which he perused with such grave
interest, we shall see in the sequel.</p>

<h4>III. REVERSES.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> weeks passed away, bringing little that is essential to be
told. Marie and her mother remained in the homestead, mourning,
as a mother and daughter only can mourn, for the departed. Monsieur
Lefrette had not been a very domestic husband or demonstrative
father; yet the hand which had snatched him away had touched
his memory with gold; and his death seemed more a loss than his
return would have seemed a gain. They did not yield weakly to
lamentation, however; for each was a support to the other. And

<!-- page 292 -->

had it not been for the unutterable sense of loneliness and the constant
impulse to <i>wait</i> for some one's arrival, before engaging in any
thing, they might, after the first burst of grief, have at once regained
their cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Many of their friends and neighbors came to the house with such
condolence as occurred to them; and kindness to the widow and
orphan was far more delicate and genuine among the simple villagers
than often it is among the more artificial denizens of cities. Had
their loss not been irreparable, the fountains of sympathy and affection
which were now opened for the first time, might well have
renewed the greenness that was withered; and, as it was, the repeated
and unprompted offers of kind service did much to assuage the sense
of desolation which always accompanies the sudden death of a long-trusted
protector.</p>

<p>Among those who called with these and other motives was the
elder Le Vert&mdash;a man whose delicacy was in an inverse ratio to his
business capacity, and who, therefore, in proportion as he over-valued
money, under-valued kindness and affection. No one would have suspected
him of attempting to console a mourner, or of sympathizing
with a sorrow; and Madame Lefrette was, accordingly, not mistaken,
when, upon his entrance, she concluded that she owed the visit to
some matter of business.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary, Madame," he commenced almost as soon as
he had deposited his heavy person in the chair offered him, "that letters
of administration on your late husband's estate be taken out as
soon as convenient&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>True; she had not thought of that, as yet.</p>

<p>"And," he continued, wiping his damp forehead, and speaking in
the tone of a man who had already settled the affair in his own mind,
"I have determined that, as his partner in trade, the duty will most
properly devolve upon me."</p>

<p>It was precisely what she would have requested, she said.</p>

<p>"You perceive," he went on, graciously affording a reason, when
the arrangement had been sanctioned without it, "I shall be allowed
by the law, a certain time in which to settle up the partnership business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 293 -->

<p>"Can you tell me what the state of the business is likely to be?"
she asked, with some interest. "I ask because, from the anxiety he
expressed, I was led to apprehend some embarrassment."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man of business, "he is somewhat in debt to the
concern, for funds drawn out in his land speculations; but that is well
invested; and, as I was about to observe, since Napoleon and Marie
are to be married, that will make no difference."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "that reminds me: is Monsieur de Cheville out
of danger?"</p>

<p>"I am not advised," Le Vert replied drily; "but Doctor Lutin
has notified Napoleon that he need not keep out of the way any
longer; so I suppose the fellow is considered convalescent."</p>

<p>Madame Lefrette made no articulate reply; though the aspiration
with which she acknowledged the information was probably quite as
much an exclamation of surprise that Coron de Cheville should be
classed as a "fellow."</p>

<p>The heavy gentleman rose after a pause, and, making a ceremonious
bow, took his leave, graciously informing the widow, that his
son Napoleon would do her and Marie the honor to call in the evening.
A curl of scorn bent her lip for a moment, and it was her only
acknowledgment of the condescending announcement; but it was
softened immediately by the reflection, that loyalty to the memory
of her departed husband required her to keep the faith he had pledged,
and for this purpose, if necessary, even submit to be "patronized" by
a pompous blockhead. She therefore faintly smiled a pleasure which
she faintly felt, and the dull man's shadow was removed.</p>

<p>Marie entered by another door, as the first closed upon her
intended father-in-law. Her step was not so light as when we saw
her at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, nor her face so blooming; but the pensiveness of sorrow
but added an element of interest to her beauty, and quietness of
bearing detracted nothing from her grace.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Le Vert has been here?" she said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," her mother answered, "and left word that Napoleon will
call this evening."</p>

<p>"Is Napoleon, like his namesake, a great sovereign," she asked

<!-- page 294 -->

with a faint smile, "that his progresses must be announced by so dignified
an <i>avant-courier?</i>"</p>

<p>"Neither he nor his father, Marie," said her mother, somewhat
severely, "is the proper subject of a jest&mdash;from you."

<p>Marie smiled again, as if the qualification "<i>from you</i>" implied
only a special prohibition. But the rebuke was too sadly true to
afford amusement; and without replying, she walked to the window,
with her lip quivering from far different emotions. Her mother
watched her for some moments, as if waiting for her to speak, but at
last broke the silence herself.</p>

<p>"You do not ask," said she. "how it is that Napoleon can re&auml;ppear
openly, without risk?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he has been tried," Marie answered, with a curl of
the lip, "and acquitted on the usual plea of self-defense."</p>

<p>"No," her mother replied, glancing keenly at her; "it is because
Monsieur de Cheville is out of danger."</p>

<p>"Scarcely, I should suppose," returned Marie, "so long as the
man lives whose hatred could prompt such an assault!"</p>

<p>"It does not become you to say so, Marie!"</p>

<p>Again the daughter's head drooped in acknowledgment of the
just rebuke. Napoleon Le Vert was her affianced husband; and
whatever would have been her feelings toward Coron de Cheville,
had she given them sway, she was under a bond, whose penalty
was her dead father's faith, to justify, or at least not to condemn,
the acts of him to whom the solemn compact had assigned her. We
will not undertake to inquire how her heart rebelled against this hard
necessity, nor how much Le Vert's offense was increased in enormity
to her view, by the fact that it had been committed against De Cheville.
Let it be sufficient that, in spite of all her mother's exhortations,
and the severe schooling of her own best reason, it <i>was</i> thus
increased; and that, before the effort to repress her indignation was
required, she could never have conceived its difficulty.</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening when she went to the window;
and while she stood, buried in thought of no pleasant nature, the sun
dropped below the horizon, and the shades of evening gathered on
the street before her. The day had been intensely warm, but now

<!-- page 295 -->

a gentle breeze sprang up, and laughing groups assembled on
piazzas, or in front of open doors; strolled leisurely among flower
beds, and gayly promenaded on the walks. The hum of business was
suspended, but the hum of pleasure filled the air instead; for the
light-hearted people of the place were almost all without their doors.
As the sun-light faded out, the moon rose on the scene; the shadows
which had pointed toward the east were now turned westward; and
the sheen lay on the quaint old town like a silvery mantle. Sweet
music floated on the wind, and perfumes from a hundred gardens,
exhaled by the sun, now settled toward the earth, and mingled with
the coolness of the closing night.</p>

<p>Marie stood at the window until the gathering darkness made her
figure but a shadow. Her mother had left the room, and she was
alone with her thoughts. A knock at the front door startled her
from reverie; and had there been an observer present, even the
moonlight would have revealed the flush that overspread her face on
suddenly recalling the promised visit of Le Vert. It must be, she
thought, Napoleon's knock; and its alarum had scattered from her
mind a crowd of images, among which the figure of her future husband
had filled a place. She reproached herself with this; but it
augured ill for time to come, that it was only sense of duty that
prompted the censure.</p>

<p>She had scarcely time to gain a seat, and still the fluttering of her
heart, when the door was opened, and, instead of Napoleon, Mr.
Beman was shown in. A sigh of relief, still less promising for
future happiness, escaped her, as she rose and welcomed the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I fear I am liable to the charge of intrusion," said the latter,
courteously, as he took the seat offered him; "but as my time in
Kaskaskia is somewhat limited, and I could not think of going away
without seeing my old friend's daughter, I determined to take the risk,"</p>

<p>"We should be more unsociable than grief ought to make us,"
said Marie, warmly, "if we were not glad to see you; and I am sure
my mother will say the same."</p>

<p>"She is well, I hope?" he said, in a tone of interest.</p>

<p>"She has not recovered from the shock of my father's death,"
Marie answered, sadly, "and I am fearful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 296 -->

<p>The sentence was arrested by the entrance of Madame Lefrette
herself, whose feeble step and pale face gave but too evident ground
for the fear her daughter was about to express. She received Mr.
Beman, of whom Marie had spoken as a friend of her father, with
a grace which always marked her manner; and as that gentleman,
referring to events which had taken place in her girlhood, mentioned
names and recalled circumstances about which she had not thought
since her father's death, a conversation ensued, which Marie was
delighted to see gave her great pleasure. He seemed to have been
intimately acquainted with all the difficulties, law-suits, arbitrations,
and controversies, whose result had been the return of her parents to
Kaskaskia; and from these, as from a common center, his recollections
radiated in all directions, returning from time to time, until the
contributions of the two presented a clear summary of the whole
disastrous business.</p>

<p>"My uncle," said he, "was your father's counsel in these affairs;
and having been a junior partner in the office at the time, I well
recollect the zeal and industry with which he endeavored to unravel
the complicated transaction. But, if my memory serve me well, he
was met at every point by the loss of certain papers, and the disappearance
of a witness, named, I think, Miller McAllen."</p>

<p>"I have heard something of the kind," said Madam Lefrette.
"And up to the very day of his death my father clung to the hope,
which I suppose was desperate, that these papers might finally be
found. Indeed," she added, sadly, "the thought went with him to the
grave; for in his will he made my daughter heir to these same lost
estates."</p>

<p>This information seemed rather to take Mr. Beman by surprise;
and from the momentary working of his expressive features, one
would have supposed it of more importance than he had apparently
attached to the subject.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, "may I ask whether that will has ever
been regularly proven?"</p>

<p>"I think no legal steps were ever taken in the matter," said
Madam Lefrette. "The will itself was preserved as a testimony of

<!-- page 297 -->

my father's affection for Marie, and not for any pecuniary value it
was ever presumed to have."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," returned the lawyer, "even as such testimonial
it was worth placing upon record; and if you will pardon the
officiousness, I would advise that it be done yet."</p>

<p>"If I thought it could be of advantage to Marie&mdash;&mdash;" she commenced.</p>

<p>"I do not know that it would," Mr. Beman interposed; "but my
experience as a lawyer has taught me the wisdom of allowing no
paper, which on its face conveys a right, to remain imperfect for want
of legal authentication."</p>

<p>"I am sure, mother," said Marie, "the gentlemen of the law
understand these things better than we can."</p>

<p>"Of course," the widow said; "and I have often thought that
something ought to have been done in the affair, out of respect for
your grandfather's memory, if for no other reason."</p>

<p>"If you will allow me to do you this service, then," said Mr.
Breman, "I will undertake to make the probate immediately."</p>

<p>By her mother's direction, Marie brought the will and gave it to
Mr. Beman, who opened and perused it carefully from beginning to
end. After ascertaining that it was all in due form, and learning
that the subscribing witnesses, one of whom was the elder Le Vert,
were still resident in Kaskaskia, he placed the paper in his pocket and
resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"I met this M. Le Vert awhile ago, he said, "and shall have
occasion to call on him again to-morrow, if, indeed, the communication
I made to him do not bring him to me first; so there need be no
delay."</p>

<p>"The communication must have been a very important one," said
Marie with a smile, "if its effect is likely to be the unbending of his
dignity so far."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;rather so," said the lawyer drily; and the conversation
flowed in another channel.</p>

<p>Two or three hours passed pleasantly away. Mr. Beman was a
man of varied observation, keen humor, and a kindness of heart,
which had survived the assaults of years, and the hard experiences of

<!-- page 298 -->

professional life. This toned his manner, as well as tinged his
thoughts, giving to both a quaint <i>bonhommie</i>, which kindly forbore to
censure, yet could not fail to penetrate, the absurdities before it. A
propriety of anecdote, and an unobtrusive cheerfulness, which gently
interposed itself between his listeners and all gloomy thoughts, gave
wings to moments, which condolence would have loaded. It was not
until he rose to go, and she glanced out of the window, where the
waning moon was tardily clearing the eastern horizon, and the still
ness of the village indicated the approach of midnight, that Madame
Lefrette became aware of the lapse of time.</p>

<p>"I ought to apologize for staying so long," said he; "but it is the
nature of all apologies to be too late."</p>

<p>"An acknowledgment of the pleasure you have given us is in
time, however," said Marie.</p>

<p>"And we shall always be glad to see you, Mr. Beman," said the
widow, "without requiring apologies for pleasant visits."</p>

<p>The lawyer received the invitation as cordially as it was given;
and then a pause ensued, during which he seemed debating within
himself whether to go or sit down.</p>

<p>"Before I leave you," he said at last, as if his mind had settled
upon his course, "I ought, perhaps, to say a few words on business.
I would not trouble you with it at such a moment, but it is necessary
you should hear the truth."</p>

<p>Madame Lefrette turned deadly pale. "I am sure," she said,
"that you would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say nothing unpleasant," he interrupted, finishing the sentence,
"except for imperative reasons: you are right. In a day or two, I
shall set off for St. Louis, to be absent some weeks; and before my
return you could not fail to hear what I am going to say&mdash;perhaps
in a distorted form. Do n't be alarmed," he continued, with a smile
to reassure her, "at my awkward way of preparing you for information,
which, after all, requires no preparation."</p>

<p>"I suppose I know what you refer to," said the widow, faintly.</p>

<p>"I judged so, from some expressions you used a while ago. The
'Land and Emigration Company,' in which your husband held a large
amount of stock, is, as I see you suspect, insolvent. But I am the

<!-- page 299 -->

assignee, and you may rest secure that your rights and the rights
of my young friend here shall be protected."</p>

<p>"I would not have troubled you with this communication," he
continued after a pause, "except to give you this assurance, and a
little piece of advice: Let some acute and reliable friend immediately
take out letters of administration upon your husband's estate; and
let him, <i>without delay</i>, proceed to examine the accounts of the late
partnership."</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Vert has undertaken to do so," said Madame Lefrette.</p>

<p>"I am aware of that," said the lawyer; "but it will be, as I told
him this evening, taxing his good-will too far, to place him in circumstances
of such temptation."</p>

<p>"Temptation!" exclaimed the widow, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Temptation," repeated the lawyer, decidedly. "I do not know
that he would use the pen otherwise than for its legitimate purpose
of rendering fair accounts; but the only means of making honesty
certain, is to remove all temptation from its path."</p>

<p>After some further conversation, and a promise by Madame
Lefrette to think seriously of his advice, Mr. Beman left them.</p>

<p>As the sound of his footsteps died away on the street, and his
figure grew dim in the moonlight, Marie turned from the door, to
which she had attended him, and approached the chair where her
mother still sat, dejected and sorrowing.</p>

<p>"Mother, my dear," said she, placing her arms about the widow's
neck, and smiling in her face, "you must not be cast down by these
tidings; for I have a firm faith that this will turn out to be a blessing
rather than a misfortune."</p>

<p>"It is not on account of the insolvency of this company, my
daughter," said her mother, drawing her down upon a seat, "that I
am cast down; for I have expected that result for a long time. It is
only for your sake that I have ever wished to realize your father's
visions; and it is now solely on your account that I regret their
failure."</p>

<p>"If it have no worse effect than it has had to-night," said Marie,
gayly, "I shall not quarrel with Fortune about it, mother. We have
both spent a far more pleasant evening than we would have done

<!-- page 300 -->

otherwise; and for the future, Mr. Beman whispered two words to
me at the door, which I shall adopt as a motto."</p>

<p>"What were they?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Courage and Patience."</p>

<p>The cloud floated away from her mother's brow, and she folded
her daughter in her arms, with one of those caresses which express
relief as well as affection.</p>

<p>"What communication do you suppose it was," asked Marie, after
a pause, "that Mr. Beman made to M. Le Vert?"</p>

<p>"The same as that to us, I presume," her mother answered.

"And do you think that had any thing to do with Napoleon's failure
to meet his father's engagement?" said she smilingly.</p>

<p>"I should hope not, indeed, Marie!"</p>

<p>"So should I," said the daughter, "for <i>his</i> sake, however."</p>

<p>"We must not do him injustice," urged the widow.</p>

<p>"Of course not." And Marie walked to the window, and stood
gazing, her face radiant with smiles, upon the quiet, moonlit street.</p>

<p>The sudden announcement of De Cheville's death, at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, had
given her a glimpse into the depths of her own heart. But duty and
the exhortations of her mother had produced an effort which she had
supposed effectual. And yet, when he, for whose sake she had thus
struggled, and conquered, as she thought, remained absent even after
announcing his coming, and contemptuously neglected to send reason
or apology, she was far more rejoiced at her exemption from the visit,
than offended at the slight.</p>

<p>Her conquest, it would seem, was not complete.</p>

<div class="center">

<h4>IV. A NEW HOME.</h4>

</div>

<p>Two days after Mr. Beman's visit to the Lefrettes, it was generally
known in Kaskaskia, that the "&mdash;&mdash; Land and Emigration Company"
had made an assignment; and, in the absence of definite information,
the most absurd rumors were in circulation. The names of
various people were confidently mentioned as involved in the failure,
who never owned a dollar of the stock, nor bought an acre of the
land. It was stated that Le Vert was the assignee; that he had been

<!-- page 301 -->

made so, and had, also, sued out letters of administration, in order to
save a portion of his deceased partner's estate; but that, on examination,
he had discovered this to be impossible, since Lefrette's property
would not pay five cents in the dollar of his liabilities.</p>

<p>Every body agreed in crediting these latter accounts; the more
especially, as Le Vert was careful not to contradict, even if he did not
encourage them. A little hesitation on the part of Madame Lefrette,
growing out of an unwillingness to accept the suspicion for which she
saw no reason but Beman's advice, had enabled him to secure the
possession of his partner's property; and when he filed his inventory,
which he did without delay, its statements consisted but too well with
the current rumors. It appeared, from a careful examination of the
partnership-books, that Lefrette, in his land speculations, had largely
overdrawn his stock; and, so far from having any assets there, was,
in fact, considerably in debt to the concern. Even the homestead,
which sheltered his widow and daughter, had been mortgaged for
more than its value; and, to make the ruin complete, Madame
Lefrette had joined in the conveyance. Poverty, unmitigated by the
saving of even a plank from the wreck, stared them inexorably in the
face.</p>

<p>When the administrator, Le Vert, made his report of the state of
affairs, he did so in the cold, business-like manner, which had always
distinguished him; but Madame Lefrette imagined he was even
more pompous than usual, as if expecting, and prepared to repel,
an imputation of having produced rather than discovered the insolvency.
She made no observation, however, and the important official
was fain to depart, without even guessing what effect his announcement
had upon the widow. He must have been considerably over-awed,
too&mdash;if the word be applicable to so dignified a gentleman&mdash;by
her perfect freedom from agitation; for a declaration, which he
had fully determined in his own mind to make in her actual presence,
died upon his lips. On his way home, he wondered what could have
possessed him. It could not have been shame for the intended meanness;
for, whatever his pride or will resolved, his judgment approved,
as both prudent and proper. Could it be the spiritual rebuke, which
the presence of the injured always gives the wrong-doer? And was

<!-- page 302 -->

it for a wrong, not meditated, but accomplished, that his conscience
now exacted tribute from his rigid manhood?</p>

<p>Madame Lefrette was a strong-minded woman, and was not cast
down by the intelligence of her sudden reduction to poverty. She
was not a masculine woman, however&mdash;one of those double-gendered
animals, who, having over-ridden and disregarded all the proprieties
of their station, and being, notwithstanding their hybrid nature,
dimly conscious of the falsehood of their position&mdash;like the fox, who
sought to have every body else's tail cut off because he had lost his
own&mdash;now seek to make deformity a law, and hide their own disgrace,
by degrading the whole sex; but a woman of true womanly instincts,
whom affliction braced to fortitude, who recognized the Christian duty
of endurance, and despised all weak repining. She calmly surveyed
her position, estimated its inconveniences, accepted its necessities, and
formed her resolution.</p>

<p>"We must leave this house immediately, Marie," said she, "and
surrender it to the creditors."</p>

<p>"Had we not better wait," suggested Marie, "until Mr. Beman's
return?"</p>

<p>"And be thrust out by process of law? Oh! no! And beside, I
am sure it will discharge a larger debt if given up quietly, than if
yielded only to vexatious litigation. We are very poor, it seems;
but this must not make us dishonest."</p>

<p>Marie thought her mother was taking rather higher ground than
the circumstances required. She was a woman; and, like all her sex,
regarded dishonesty more as meanness than immorality; so that, in
endeavoring to avoid it, she approached generosity more nearly than
justice. Her daughter made no remark, however; and, on the following
day, their preparations were begun for leaving the roof which
had sheltered them for so many years. Before the end of the week
the house was closed, and the mother and daughter were occupying a
single small room in the modest residence of Madame Dupley&mdash;a
widowed sister of the late M. Lefrette. The plump little figure of
this lady was but the type of a heart well preserved; and, though
like her sister-in-law, she had been left in poverty by the death of her
husband, kindness and content remained. She bustled round so

<!-- page 303 -->

cheerfully to make her guests comfortable, and welcomed them so
cordially to the room which she had hastily got ready for them, that
it seemed that <i>she</i> was the obliged party, and not they to whom she
was giving shelter.</p>

<p>"We shall live like three princesses," she said cheerily, at breakfast
on the morning after the removal; "and," she added, glancing
smilingly at Marie. "one of these bright mornings, some knight in
rich armor will ride up to our castle-gate, and demand one of us in
marriage. Which of us do you think it will be, Marie?"</p>

<p>"I hope he will have taste enough to ask for <i>you</i>, aunt," Marie
answered with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No doubt he will," said the little woman, "if he do n't see you
first. But I hope he will not come soon."</p>

<p>"He's not very likely to, I think," said Marie quietly; and a
sudden look from her mother denoted that their thoughts were tending
in the same direction.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lefrette had now been dead about seven weeks; and
during the whole of that time Napoleon Le Vert had not once called.
His father, as the reader knows, had once announced his coming. But
on his way homeward, the same evening, that gentleman had met Mr.
Beman, who informed him of Lefrette's insolvency, and Napoleon did
not make his appearance. His absence could not be accounted for
now, as it had been for a few days, by the necessity for keeping out
of the way; for De Cheville was nearly recovered, and had declared
his intention to give no further notice to the assault. The elder Le
Vert came frequently to consult with the widow about the business
of his administration; but at no time had he ever mentioned his son's
name, or hinted at the engagement between him and Marie. Once,
when Madame Lefrette alluded to it, he coldly changed the subject;
and when he went away, the impression was left upon the widow's
mind, that he had determined wholly to ignore the contract. She did
not speak of this to her daughter, however; and the glance which
passed between them at the breakfast-table, as we have related, was
their first communication on the subject.</p>

<p>The insult thus evidently meditated was the more offensive because
the affray between Le Vert and De Cheville had made the

<!-- page 304 -->

marriage-contract public talk; and while the meanness of the slight
was thus made more conspicuous, the affront became more decided.
As yet no observation had been made upon it; and judging from
Marie's increasing cheerfulness, as week after week passed away without
her seeing her future husband, it seemed that the person most
interested was in truth the most indifferent. After the first shock of
grief for her father, her spirits rose, as it appeared, in an inverse
ratio to her reverses of fortune; and on the morning of which we
are writing, when she left the table and went, singing, into the garden,
it was with a joyousness which suggested, if it did not fully justify,
the reflection of her mother, "She rejoices in our poverty, because
it seems to have freed her from an irksome bond." She might lament
the want of pride which thus quietly accepted the affront; but the
mother's heart could not but feel happy in the happiness of her
daughter.</p>

<p>Time passed more rapidly with the afflicted in their humble
abode, and brought more speedily its healing influences than they had
ever hoped. Their reduction to poverty had been so complete and
irretrievable, that not even the usual effort to save a portion of the
wreck harassed them with its sordid and recurring struggles. All
was given up, without a murmur or a day's delay; and having thus
severed their bonds with what was past, they were free, with energy
and composure, to address themselves to that which was still before
them.</p>

<p>The means of procuring at least the necessaries of life were soon
furnished; for offers of service, which, however, they declined, except
in the shape of such work as they were able to do, poured in from
many, whose friendship thus took the course in which only it could
benefit them. A few of their former friends had forgotten them;
but of this they took no thought; and every succeeding day produced
new proof that those who worthily deport themselves in prosperity
will not be deserted in adversity.</p>

<p>Among the first who called upon them in their new home, and
afterward the most frequent visitor, was our friend Monsieur Maillefert.
It was he who first gave employment to their needles. But it
subsequently transpired, through the garrulous and simple-minded

<!-- page 305 -->

Madam Dupley, who seemed to take great pleasure in descanting
upon the Monsieur's kindness, that he had taken this step only after
an ineffectual attempt to convey assistance to them, by placing money
in her hands under an injunction of strict secresy. Madam Lefrette
blushed with offended pride when this came to her knowledge; but
her attention was forcibly attracted by the warm praises bestowed
upon the Frenchman by her enthusiastic sister-in-law; and it was
remarked by both Marie and herself that these had more general
reference to the little Master's character than to the generosity of
this particular act. They observed also, that, although he never
failed toward <i>them</i> in that delicate politeness which was his by the
three-fold propriety of national, individual, and professional character,
toward <i>her</i> his manner was far more impressive and devoted; and
the fact that they had several times seen him leave the house when
his entrance had not been notified to them, led them silently to suspect
that the brisk little widow's commendations were as much the
expression of a personal interest in <i>him</i> as of gratitude for friendly
offices to <i>them</i>. This suspicion they never intruded upon their kind-hearted
relative, however; and thus the quiet household went on for
nearly two months.</p>

<p>Mr. Beman was still absent in St. Louis, or, at all events, not in Kaskaskia;
although his proceedings, in the matters of his trust, were yet
in progress, in both places. He had once written to De Cheville, who
was now entirely recovered, in regard to some business, requesting
at the same time that the young man would call upon the Lefrettes,
before answering, and give him reliable information of their circumstances.
But the latter had heard of Marie's engagement to young
Le Vert; and being thus able to account for the assault upon him,
believed that his visit could not be viewed otherwise than as an intrusion.
He therefore contented himself with making minute inquiries
of Monsieur Maillefert, on whose shady premises he spent much of
his time, and communicating the result to his correspondent.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this well-considered delicacy, however, De Cheville
could not help haunting the neighborhood of her whom he loved;
and this attraction might not only account for his remaining in Kaskaskia,
but also for the singular intimacy which had grown up

<!-- page 306 -->

between him and the little <i>ma&icirc;tre;</i> for that polite gentleman's house
was almost directly opposite to that of Madam Dupley. During the
slow weeks of his convalescence the shaded garden-walks and airy
corridors had given him a pleasant retreat; and now that he no
longer needed such, habit and the nameless attraction stronger than
habit, led him as constantly as ever to seek the tempered air and
quiet precinct.</p>

<p>The subject of his conversations with M. Maillefert was far more
frequently the widow and her daughter than comported with the prudence
which had forbidden his calling, as Beman had requested.
His friend needed little prompting on the theme; and had De Cheville
been in daily intercourse with the household he could not have
been better informed of every circumstance surrounding them.</p>

<p>Among all these, nothing disquieted him so much, and yet gave
him so much unconscious pleasure, as the fact that, since her father's
death Marie had not once seen her promised husband! As day after
day and week after week passed by, and the indignant Monsieur still
repeated that the absence was not yet broken, the impulse to seek
her and offer a more faithful heart, which he had formed on first
hearing of the young man's neglect, gained strength, and had now
almost become a settled purpose. He still hesitated, however; and
his resolution was but half-formed more than a month after his health
was fully restored.</p>

<p>One afternoon toward the end of August, the friends were sitting
on the eastern corridor, sheltered by vines and flowers from the glare
of the summer day, and enjoying that most unalloyed of luxuries, a
genuine Habana cigar, in a cool and balmy atmosphere. They had
been speaking of Marie Lefrette, and the Monsieur was wondering,
in his peculiar mosaic of English and French, how she could tamely
and even cheerfully endure a neglect which had grown marked and
offensive. He had, indeed, just come to a conclusion which made
him start from his chair, and walk hastily from one end of the corridor
to the other, as if the revelation of his own logic had been a
startling communication.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, folding his arms and nodding his head, as if

<!-- page 307 -->

to some invisible interlocutor, "<i>Oui! certainement!</i> Of co'rse!
<i>Pourquoi</i>, what for I not see, eh? <i>d'avance?</i>"</p>

<p>"See what, Monsieur? What is it you have not seen before?"
asked his companion, smiling at his excitement.</p>

<p>"Dat she not love; she, Marie love Napoleon; <i>non!</i>"</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" exclaimed De Cheville, almost rising
to his feet, as if the thought had suddenly occurred to him also.</p>

<p>"Re'ly! <i>assur&eacute;ment!</i> Ah! what you call? certainly!" he answered
with great vehemence, striding rapidly toward the end of the corridor,
and still nodding his head in growing conviction, as one circumstance
after another arose to his memory. De Cheville sank back
into his seat, and covered his face with his hands, while visions of
happiness, which he had schooled himself to reject and discourage
came thronging through his excited imagination.</p>

<p>He was recalled by the sound of a strange voice; and on looking
up, perceived a middle-aged gentleman, wearing the unmistakable air
and dress of a clergyman, who stepped upon the corridor and inquired
for Monsieur Maillefert.</p>

<p>"<i>Je suis l'homme, Monsieur</i>," said that gentleman, halting before
him with a courtly bow.</p>

<p>"My name is McAllen, Sir," the stranger said, returning his salutation.
"I have some business with a Madame Lefrette, who lived
near here, and have been referred to you, as a person probably willing
to accompany me to her. I knew her father," he added, apologetically,
"in my boyhood, but am not personally acquainted with her."</p>

<p>"I go with mosh plaisure, Sare," said M. Maillefert. "You stay
<i>mon ami?</i>" he added, to De Cheville. "I return&mdash;what you call?&mdash;forthwith!
<i>Allons, Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>The two walked away toward Madame Dupley's, leaving De Cheville
pacing, with an unquiet step and perplexed face, up and down
the half covered corridor. He paused from time to time at the end
next the street, and once stepped down upon the walk, as if to follow
Monsieur Maillefert and the stranger; but the next moment a shade
of irresolution crossed his brow, and he reluctantly and slowly
retraced his steps. He felt as if drawn by an almost irresistible

<!-- page 308 -->

attraction toward the house just entered by his friend; yet the
timidity of strong affection, and the delicacy of his character, restrained
the impulse.</p>

<p>The stranger bowed low as he entered the presence of Madame
Lefrette; and as M. Maillefert introduced him, the name awakened
recollections, vague, however, and indefinite. She received him with
quiet politeness; but was somewhat disturbed when the little monsieur
declined the seat offered him, and left them evidently under the
impression that there was something in the visit which required
privacy.</p>

<p>"I believe, Madam," said the clergyman, "that you are the
daughter of the late Lee Farrington, formerly of B&mdash;&mdash; county, in
Kentucky?"</p>

<p>"I am, Sir," she said, inclining her head.</p>

"I was sorry to learn," he resumed, "on my arrival here, that he
was no longer living; for I had hoped to do an act of justice which
was but too long delayed. Do you recollect ever to have seen
Miller McAllen?"</p>

<p>"I have heard the name frequently," said she, "but was too
young when I was in Kentucky to remember him, if I had seen him,
which I did not."</p>

<p>"He was my father," resumed the stranger. "He died a few
months ago, in New-Orleans, where he had been residing since my
boyhood. With almost his last breath," he continued, drawing a
paper from his pocket, "he directed me to place this dying declaration
in your father's hands, and to ask his forgiveness for a grievous
wrong done many years ago. It now belongs to you."</p>

<p>She took the paper, and without opening it waited for explanation.
It was evidently an unpleasant duty to the stranger; and this rendered
his narrative somewhat rambling and involved. We had better,
therefore, simply state the contents of the paper.</p>

<p>It set out that the declarant, Miller McAllen, had been many
years before a trusted agent of Mr. Farrington, a young man of fortune,
from Virginia, who had emigrated to Kentucky, and become
the owner of a large amount of property there, consisting chiefly of
a very extensive grant of land. Farrington was careless and roving,

<!-- page 309 -->

easily disgusted with the details of business, and trusting his affairs
implicitly to agents. About the year 179&mdash;, he had gone on a visit to
the Western frontier settlements, leaving his affairs in great confusion.
Before going, he had executed a lease for the term of five
years, conveying about two-thirds of his land to one Robert Crabell,
and placing him in possession. This lease had been executed in
duplicate, one copy being given to Crabell, and the other retained, as
Farrington's agent, by the declarant, who was the only witness. With
this, was also left in McAllen's possession the original grant, upon
which Farrington's title rested.</p>

<p>The proprietor himself remained so long in the West that a
rumor gained credence that he had been killed by the Indians; and
the rapid influx of emigration enhanced the value of the land so
much as to present a strong temptation to those in whose power it
thus seemed, to possess themselves of the legal title. The accidental
destruction of the public records of the district strengthened the purpose,
and rendered it safe. The two papers in McAllen's keeping
were the only existing muniments of title.</p>

<p>Crabell and his two brothers-in-law, who were in possession, were
aware of this state of things, and immediately opened a negotiation
with McAllen to secure the papers. He declined to part with them
on any terms; but, after several weeks of hesitation, finally agreed,
for a bribe of ten thousand dollars, to destroy them. Crabell and
his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> had not so much money; and it thus became necessary
to take into their counsel other persons, willing to furnish the cash.
It was these other persons with whom Farrington afterward carried
on his ineffectual and ruinous legal controversies.</p>

<p>The iniquitous bargain was concluded; but in the very moment
of its execution, one of those sudden and unaccountable "accesses of
conscience" which sometimes come to the greatest villains, arrested
McAllen's hand. Instead of burning the papers, as he assured his
conspirators he had done, he placed them securely in his own strong
box. Subsequently, disturbed by their possession, and pressed by
conscience, he disposed of them in a way which quieted him with the
fallacious hope that they might one day fall into the proper hands,
but which, it seemed, had resulted in a loss as total as if they had

<!-- page 310 -->

been burnt. He had them built into the chimney of a house, then
being erected for an office, and thus effectually concealed.</p>

<p>"This house," the declaration went on to say, "is the one now
occupied by Mr. Beman as an office, in P&mdash;&mdash;, Kentucky; and the
papers will be found in the chimney, on the south side, five courses
of brick from the floor."</p>

<p>"But," said the clergyman, at this point, "I have been to P&mdash;&mdash;,
according to my father's direction, and found that the old building
has been torn away for more than six months, and a new house is
now in process of erection on the same site."</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," said Madame Lefrette, "I hear the voice
of this same Mr. Beman." And a moment afterward that gentleman
was ushered into the room.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Maillefert</span>, as we have said, declined the seat offered
him, and went in search of the brisk little widow Dupley. He found
her without difficulty; and, in view of his age and well-accredited
character for steadiness, I grieve to relate that his first movement
was to throw his arm, with a graceful flourish, around her plump
figure, and <i>sans c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</i>, snatch two or three kisses from her full
red lips. The robbery was, however, not very fiercely resisted; and
an observer might even have suspected that it was not the first
depredation. A merry laugh and a volley of French raillery, discharged
as only a Frenchwoman can manage such a <i>fusillade</i>, were his
only punishment. She did not remove the hand which grasped her
waist until, after half an hour spent in walking, like two younger
lovers, up and down the floor, they were interrupted by the knock of
Mr. Beman. A little vexed, even then, at the interruption, she ran
to the door, and having shown the lawyer to Madame Lefrette's
room, came hastily back to her youthful swain.</p>

<p>The brief interlude, however, had given him time to recollect
himself; and he was about to take his leave, excusing himself upon
the ground that he had left De Cheville waiting for him, when she

<!-- page 311 -->

suggested that he call the latter over, declaring that she had not seen
him for an age, and always did love him <i>infiniment!</i></p>

<p>It needed but this to overcome De Cheville's wavering resolution;
and when the pair came to the gate and beckoned him across, the
alacrity with which he obeyed the summons but faintly evinced his
pleasure. He might not see Marie; but even to stand at the
threshold of her residence was a happiness not to be foregone.</p>

<p>His foot had hardly passed the gateway when the little widow
almost overwhelmed him with voluble questions and congratulations
upon his recovery.</p>

<p>"Blood-letting must agree with me," he said, with a smile, "if
your compliments are as true as they would be addressed to yourself."</p>

<p>Monsieur Maillefert grasped his hand cordially.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>" he cried, "you speak true&mdash;vary&mdash;Eh? Madame
is my vife, sare&mdash;dat is&mdash;vary soon!"</p>

<p>"Why! listen to the crazy little man!" exclaimed the merry
widow, with a twinkle in her bright black eye, which contradicted her
denial. "I assure you I have just rejected him <i>tout de bon!</i>"</p>

<p>"Call me as a witness against her!" suddenly cried Marie Lefrette,
springing, with a laugh, from the shelter of some shrubbery,
toward which De Cheville's back had been turned. She had mistaken
him for some one else, through the leafy screen; and was now
advancing with a quick step and smiling face, when he suddenly
turned toward her. An exclamation of surprise, and a blush to the
very temples, accompanied the recognition. She hastily paused, and
seemed about to fly, when De Cheville advanced, and, with an eager,
though respectful gesture, took her hand.</p>

<p>"You seem surprised to see me," said he, in a low tone, "and
perhaps I ought to apologize for the intrusion; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, indeed!" she interrupted, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, indeed!" repeated her aunt, laughing; "she is only a
little vexed because you did not come sooner!"</p>

<p>"Aunt Dupley," said Marie, recovering her self-possession, and
shaking her finger playfully at the merry little bride-expectant,
"would you like to have me tell what I saw in the parlor half an
hour ago?"</p>

<!-- page 312 -->

<p>"We will not stay to hear it," she answered, with an affectation of
disdain, which, however, did not conceal the blush that covered her
rosy cheek. "Come, Monsieur," she continued, taking his arm, "I
have never shown you my new flower-beds; will you go to see them
now?"</p>

<p>The Monsieur bowed a courtly acquiescence, and the pair set off
toward the garden.</p>

<p>"Will you not let us admire them too, aunt?" said Marie,
hastily, as if afraid of being left alone.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," she answered; "you may come along, if Monsieur De
Cheville will pledge himself for your good behavior."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a bond if you wish it," said De Cheville, offering
Marie his arm. This, however, she declined, and walked on by his
side, talking rapidly, and with some excitement in her manner, as
if fearful of the introduction of some unpleasant subject. De Cheville
observed this, but, with a sigh, endeavored to reply to her in
her own strain. They followed her aunt and the Monsieur, pausing
from time to time, as the former directed their attention to various
improvements in her tasteful plats and beds, until they had nearly
reached the lower end of the garden. Here two or three native trees
of the forest had been surrounded by a circle of exotic shrubs and
plants; these had reared their luxuriant heads to the lower branches,
and formed within a cool pavilion of green foliage. A narrow
entrance had been left on the southern side, and within were erected
several rustic benches. At this point Madame Dupley and her
cavalier suddenly disappeared; and Marie and De Cheville, supposing
they had entered, passed in and found themselves secluded and alone!</p>

<p>"Why! where can they have gone?" she exclaimed, calling
loudly, but tremulously, her aunt's name.</p>

<p>No answer was returned, save the echoes of her own voice,
coming back from the surrounding solitude.</p>

<p>"They are somewhere near," she said, trembling in every limb;
"let us search for them." And she approached the entrance.</p>

<p>"Marie," said De Cheville, all his resolutions melting away before
the temptation of opportunity, "will you not remain here with me
for a few moments?"</p>

<!-- page 313 -->

<p>He took her hand as he spoke, and gently drew her, yielding
reluctantly, to a seat. Then, without premeditation, he dropped
upon one knee before her, and poured forth that eloquence which
gushes from a full and loving heart. She covered her face with her
hands as he proceeded, and tears of mingled happiness and sorrow
evinced the conflict of her emotions.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mr. Beman had been introduced to McAllen,
and had listened attentively to his story, and carefully read the
declaration.</p>

<p>"You say," said he, "that you have carefully examined the place
of deposit indicated here, which, singularly enough, seems to have
been my office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," McAllen answered; "and the workmen said they had
seen nothing of any papers in taking down the chimney. I even had
the floors lifted, and a strict search made; but was reluctantly forced
to the conclusion that the papers had been destroyed."</p>

<p>"If we had those documents," said Beman, musingly, "this
declaration would be, though not strictly legal evidence, of great
service. By establishing the fact of your father's death we might be
permitted to prove his hand-writing. But, as it is, this seems only
to ascertain that a great wrong has been done, without giving the
means of righting it."</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the entrance of the elder Le Vert, who
accompanied his announcement with a stately bow first to Madame
Lefrette, and then to the two gentlemen, and, declining the seat offered
him, at once addressed the former.</p>

<p>"I have but a few moments to spare," he said, in that tone which
seemed to declare his time more valuable and his business more
important than those of any one else; "will you allow me to speak
with you in private, Madam?"</p>

<p>Madame Lefrette rose, and without replying, led the way into
another room. Here he again declined a seat, and without preface,
with the rashness which always indicates the trepidation of fear or of
conscious meanness, declared his business.</p>

<p>"My son, Napoleon," he commenced, "informed me to-day that
he has not seen your daughter for several weeks."</p>

<!-- page 314 -->

<p>"He informed you truly, Sir," said Madame Lefrette, calmly;
"he has not seen her since her father's death disclosed her poverty."</p>

<p>Le Vert had the grace almost to blush, but went on:</p>

<p>"I had for some time suspected something of the sort&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame Lefrette smiled quietly in his face; she knew he had
been fully aware of it.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;and," he continued, more rapidly, "what Napoleon told
me, only confirmed my apprehension, that his engagement with
Marie had become somewhat irksome to both parties; and that,
in short&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In short," she interposed, calmly, "it were better broken off.
Is not that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," she interrupted. "And now let it be
considered ended, expressly, as it has been tacitly, for some time."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the old gentleman, "its end must date from this
moment as a mutual agreement neither party being liable to the
charge of bad faith."</p>

<p>"Let it be so, then," she said with a scornful smile; for she
divined his thoughts. "Legal proceedings, in such matters, are not
to my taste."</p>

<p>"It is settled, then," he returned, unbending his dignity a little,
"and I hope without unkind feeling?"</p>

<p>"With heartfelt rejoicing, rather," she replied, accepting his hand
for a moment, and returning his profound salutation, as he bade her a
stately adieu.</p>

<p>Madame Dupley and M. Maillefert entered the room as he left it.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where Marie is?" asked Madame Lefrette.</p>

<p>"We have just left her in the garden," the little widow replied,
with a glance of merry intelligence toward Monsieur Maillefert,
which that gentleman returned with a twinkle of his laughing eye.
Madame Lefrette did not observe this telegraphing, but went immediately
in search of her daughter. Passing along the main walk, a
few moments brought her near the natural summer-house, where we
left De Cheville and Marie. Here the tones of his voice, not loud,
but impassioned and trembling, came, softened by the leafy screen,

<!-- page 315 -->

but still distinctly audible. The mother paused to listen; and, as
she recognized the voice, a flush of surprise and pleasure crossed her
handsome face.</p>

<p>"But I <i>must</i> speak <i>now</i>" De Cheville said, apparently in reply to her
imploring for delay. "I have been, silent until the words will no longer
be restrained; my heart is too full, and I must speak <i>now</i>. You
know how I have loved you&mdash;how long, and how well. I will not
believe&mdash;nay, I <i>can not</i> believe&mdash;that you have been indifferent to
that love. Let me, at least, hear you say that I have not built my
hopes altogether upon the sand; that, whatever your feelings may be
to-day, in times past you have known, and felt, and appreciated, the
devotion I have given you!"</p>

<p>"But, De Cheville," she sobbed, "you know I am not free; you
know I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Engaged to another. I know it; I do know it!" he exclaimed
impetuously. "But I know, also, that you have not seen him during
all the afflictions through which you have passed. I know that he
shuns you like a stranger, leaving you to bear your burden alone!
This engagement no longer binds you! You can not&mdash;I am sure,
you can not&mdash;give up the devotion I offer you, for a hand which, if
ever given at all, will be as cold as ice!"</p>

<p>Marie's convulsive sobbing could no longer be restrained; it
became audible even where her mother stood, and seemed the very
bursting of her heart. A tear of maternal sympathy filled the eye
of the latter; a tear of sympathy, yet, also, of happiness. "This is
too great a trial for her," she thought; and, advancing toward the
arbor, called her daughter's name. Marie sprang to her feet, and was
hastily drying her tears when her mother appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"You need not wipe them away, Marie," said she, smiling with
an expression which made De Cheville's heart spring to his throat.
"I have overheard enough to satisfy me that you had better let them
flow; for I am sure they are as much tears of joy as of sorrow."</p>

<p>Marie threw herself in her mother's arms, and gave way to "her
weeping. Madame Lefrette placed her hand tenderly upon her head,
and looked at De Cheville.</p>

<p>"You love her, then?" she said.</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"I do," he replied fervently, "better than life!"</p>

<p>"And wish to make her yours?" she continued.</p>

<p>"I do," he again replied. "She has told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I heard what she said," interrupted the mother. "And now I
must have some conversation with her. Will you continue in the
same mind till to-morrow, think you?"</p>

<p>De Cheville smiled faintly. "I fear I shall," said he.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," Madame Lefrette continued; "come to us at
three to-morrow, and Marie shall give you your answer. Can you
curb your impatience so long?"</p>

<p>"I will try," he said, and with a bow, left the mother and daughter
alone together.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> justices' courts, it is always two o'clock till the third hour is
complete; but among the suitors in the courts of Cupid, the "practice"
is reversed; and no lover ever had an appointment which he did
not meet before the time. De Cheville was no exception to the
remark.</p>

<p>At least half an hour before three o clock, on the following day,
his patience was exhausted, and his nervous eagerness beyond resistance.
He walked resolutely to the house where the great question
of his life was to be solved, and was archly shown into the parlor by
Madame Dupley. Marie's mother sat near the window, alone. It
was with a sinking heart that he took the seat to which she directed
him. His voice was hardly sufficient to reply to her grave observation
upon the fineness of the weather.</p>

<p>Other common-places followed, solemn as a funeral. A quarter
of an hour passed, and De Cheville believed himself older by, at least,
a twelve-month. He was about to rise and retire&mdash;deeming this
only a delicate way of conveying a negative&mdash;when the voice of
Marie was heard upon the corridor, and Madame Lefrette suddenly
turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Your mind has not changed, Monsieur?" she asked hastily.</p>

<p>De Cheville began awkwardly to protest his undying fidelity,
when Marie's entrance interrupted him.</p>

<!-- page 317 -->

<p>"Enough, I understand," said Madame Lefrette; and, rising, she
approached her daughter, who had paused suddenly, in surprise at
seeing him already present. Her mother took her hand, and placed
it in his.</p>

<p>"This is her answer," she said, and glided from the room, leaving
the pair, with joined hands, gazing bewildered into each other's
eyes. De Cheville was the first to recover himself; with a sudden
and passionate gesture, he caught her to his bosom. Madame Lefrette
closed the door.</p>

<p>To her infinite surprise, almost at the threshold, she met Monsieur
Le Vert and Mr. Beman! To the latter she gave her hand; to
the former, a salutation as stately, though not so eager, as his own.</p>

<p>"Walk into this room, gentlemen," said she, leading them away
from the parlor, which she deemed already sufficiently tenanted.</p>

<p>"I have called to-day," M. Le Vert commenced, as soon as they
were seated, "to correct a mistake into which I unfortunately fell
yesterday; and I do so at the request of Napoleon, who is very much
distressed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Madame Lefrette, in surprise.</p>

<p>"He is, indeed, Madame: Mr. Beman will confirm it."</p>

<p>"I believe what he says is quite true," said that gentleman, with,
however, an equivocal smile.</p>

<p>"I asked him to accompany me," continued Le Vert, "in order to
avouch the distress of my son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to be a witness of your conversation," interpolated Beman.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;yes&mdash;to hear me acknowledge how much mistaken I
have been," the anxious father continued, "and to propose, for the
happiness of my son, and, I trust, of your daughter, that the engagement
between them may be re&iuml;nstated on its former footing. Napoleon
would have come in person; but he insisted that I should first
undo the evil I alone had done."</p>

<p>"Is there any thing behind all this, Mr. Beman?" asked the
widow, appealing to him as if at a loss what to say.</p>

<p>"Only half-a-million of dollars," drily answered the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Villain!" exclaimed Le Vert, springing to his feet as if to strike
him.</p>

<!-- page 318 -->

<p>"Keep cool, Monsieur," calmly remonstrated Beman, "until I
explain. You are aware, Madame," he continued, turning quietly to
the widow, "that the recovery of your father's estates would have
been easy, but for the loss of two papers and the disappearance of
one witness. Those two papers I have for some time had in my
possession. I did not mention the fact to you, because the witness
was still to be found, and I did not wish to raise hopes that might be
disappointed. The grant, or warrant, alone, was not sufficient; for
the 'Statute of Limitations'&mdash;which enacts that if you can continue
a <i>wrong</i> for a certain number of years, the law will perpetuate it by
pronouncing it a <i>right</i>&mdash;would have cut us off; and the rules applying
to the lease&mdash;a part of whose meaning is, that no wrong can be
<i>righted</i> until you have first proven that no wrong has been <i>committed</i>*&mdash;would
have enabled the other party to put us upon the proof
of the signatures. But for the opportune appearance of Mr. McAllen,
this would have been impossible. Now, we shall be able to account
for the witness, and for the custody of the papers; and shall, also, be
able to introduce other testimony, which would otherwise have been
excluded.</p>

<p class="small">[*<i>Id est</i>, before you can avoid the operation of the "Statute" named in the text, (in matters
of ejectment) you must prove that there has been no "adverse," or wrongful, "possession."]</p>

<p>"All this, you will say," continued the lawyer, "does not explain
the sudden revolution disclosed in the sentiments of Napoleon Le
Vert and his father. But listen a few moments. About two thousand
dollars will be necessary in order to prosecute the affair to a
successful issue. I knew you could not raise this; but I had heard
that the young man and Marie were to be married, and I therefore,
this morning, told him the whole story. I must do him and his father
the justice to say, that they promptly offered to furnish the money
informing me, at the same time, of the <i>mistake</i> of yesterday, and
exacting a promise that I would accompany Monsieur Le Vert hither,
and throw my weight into the scale."</p>

<p>"Your weight will hardly be sufficient, Sir," said Madame
Lefrette, waving her hand to silence Le Vert, who was about to
speak.</p>

<p>"I am aware of that," said Beman calmly, "and rejoice that it is

<!-- page 319 -->

so. Since this morning, I have had a conversation with Monsieur
Maillefert, who made no scruple to tell me of Marie's preference for
De Cheville. He, also, at once furnished the requisite money, for
which I gave him a receipt, as your attorney; but not until he had
established his right to do this kindness, by informing me that he is
about to become your brother-in-law!"</p>

<p>"Is this true, Madame?" exclaimed Le Vert, purple with passion,
and hardly able to wait for Beman to conclude. "Is my son jilted
for this upstart?"</p>

<p>"I can not permit this language here, Sir," said she, with eyes
flashing the ire of insulted pride.</p>

<p>"Let me represent you," said Beman quietly. "Monsieur, I
think your negotiation has failed, and you had better let me escort
you to the door. And," he added in a low tone, as the discomfited
old gentleman allowed himself to be gently ejected, "you may consider
yourself well off, if I do not too closely scan your accounts as
administrator!"</p>

<p>A look of consternation was his only reply; at least, if he
intended any other, Beman did not wait for it, but closed the door
and returned to the window.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the middle of October&mdash;when the "Indian summer" had
veiled the prairies, and the distant woods wore a hazy blue, and the
sky seemed charged with rain that never fell&mdash;one pleasant evening,
when the winds were low, and the moon rose dusky red, and the stars
shone faintly through the gauzy screen&mdash;after sunset, when the darkness
had come in, yet the daylight lingered still, when the gay Kaskaskians
were all upon the street, and care was driven out by laughter&mdash;a
stream of guests, of every age and sex, began to pour into the
house of Monsieur Maillefert. The master and mistress, who had
been married a month, at the close of the carnival-honeymoon, were
celebrating a sort of "Pancake Tuesday;" but the brightness of their
faces, and their unaffected joyousness of manner, gave no token of the
matrimonial Lent, which the world supposes invariably to follow that

<!-- page 320 -->

festival. Ash Wednesday never came in the nuptial calendar of that
simple pair.</p>

<p>The Monsieur's closing <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, but for the sad affray between De
Cheville and Le Vert, had been a grand affair; but this occasion quite
eclipsed its grandeur. Female hands had now been busied with the
preparations; female taste had twined the wreaths, and arranged the
flowers, and decorated the rooms; and not a guest, of all that company,
came in without admiring the proofs of female presence.</p>

<p>Before eight o'clock the house was full; and yet, although the
buzz of animated conversation and the ring of merry laughter filled
the air, the stated pleasures of the evening had not yet commenced.
Monsieur Maillefert and his joyous little wife had quietly slipped
away for half an hour or more, but no body was surprised at their
absence. They had crossed the street to witness the marriage ceremony
between Marie Lafrette and De Cheville, and all knew that
they would soon return, bringing with them the happy pair, in whose
honor the company was assembled.</p>

<p>Their absence seemed protracted to the waiting throng; but at
length the word was passed that they were coming, and a little procession
of about a dozen persons, all decked with wreaths and flowers,
and in bridal and holiday attire, came marching, in a shadowy though
shining train, across the moonlit street. Gay groups of friends
assembled at the gate, and welcomed the bride and bridegroom, who
led the little <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>. Then came the mother, cheerful and calm, leaning
upon the arm of Mr. Beman. The active aunt, with her springing
step, kept even pace with her laughing husband. Kisses and congratulations
were showered on them all, and jest and laugh went
round the groups, as if each were striving to be merrier than all
others.</p>

<p>The host's clear voice was now heard calling them within, and&mdash;a
summons quite as moving&mdash;notes of preparation from the fiddles
came mellowed through the windows. The company in the large
saloon retired to the walls; the Monsieur led De Cheville and his
bride, with a grace unrivalled, to the head of the room; the dancers
took their places. At a signal from the master, the fiddlers drew
their bows with a vigor known only to those primitive days. De

<!-- page 321 -->

Cheville took Marie's hand, and all admired the lithe and bending
figures, as they floated down the room. Close after them came Monsieur
Maillefert and his active bride, with rapid feet and cloudless
faces; and then such crossing in and out, such swinging right and
left, such airy harmony of movement, such natural grace and deep
enjoyment have not been seen in Kaskaskia since the Monsieur's
school was closed.</p>

<p>With a delicate, though healthy, bloom upon her cheeks, with
eyes sparkling happiness and love, the young bride seemed wafted
through the figure; and when, with one bright glance into his eyes,
she placed her arm within De Cheville's, and retired from the floor, a
murmur of unenvying admiration passed along the ranks of pleased
spectators.</p>

<p>As they approached the window, and stood leaning there, a passing
figure, muffled in a cloak, paused for a moment, and looked in.
Could they have seen the fierce hatred of that look, so happy as they
were, they could but have pitied him from whose heart such bitterness
could rise. They saw him not, however; and, with that devilish
glance, he gathered up his cloak, and passed on. It was Napoleon Le
Vert, who thus gazed on what his mercenary soul had lost him.</p>

<p>After midnight the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> broke up; but the memory of that evening
did not pass away with the night; for many an old Kaskaskian can
recall this brilliant commencement of the happy married life of De
Cheville and his peerless bride.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so to conclude.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage, De Cheville discovered that he had
acquired, unawares, one of the greatest fortunes then in the West;
but, as the prospect had not influenced, the possession did not injure,
him. Both he and his yet lovely wife have borne themselves meekly
in their prosperity; and if an austere economist might carp at the
style of their living, he could, at least, never reproach them with vulgar
ostentation, of reckless profusion in unworthy pursuits or for
unworthy objects, nor instance any refusal of assistance to the needy
and deserving. De Cheville occupies a high federal station; and his

<!-- page 322 -->

wife, in the very bloom of her matronly beauty, is still one of the
fairest ornaments of her brilliant circle.</p>

<p>A year after Marie's nuptials, the attachment which had quietly
grown up between her mother and Mr. Beman, but which had never
been expressed, was spoken and acknowledged; and when she had
given a few more months to her weeds, in the beginning of the Christmas
feasts, she exchanged them for new bridal ornaments.</p>

<p>The light-hearted and amiable Monsieur Maillefert and his kind
and active spouse have both gone to their rest; but a son and a
daughter faithfully bring down their memories, and honor them by
blameless lives.</p>

<p>But two of our <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> remain to be accounted for; the
elder and younger Le Vert.</p>

<p>The former settled up the business of his administration, without
interference from any quarter, and, it is to be hoped, to his own satisfaction.
His trade was rapidly increased, and streams of affluence
poured in upon him for several years, precisely as if his capital had
been honestly acquired. But the evil propensities of his son, developed
by enlarged means of dissipation, were a fountain of bitterness
in his later years; and the consequences of a brawl, in which the latter
had committed a homicide, during one of his annual visits to
New-Orleans, gave a blow to both the health and fortune of the former,
from which he never recovered. Napoleon escaped the penalty
of his crime; but it was at the cost of nearly all his father's hard-earned
and ill-gotten gains; and as, after this, the elder sank rapidly
into poverty and imbecility, the younger speedily reached the depths
to which gambling and drunkenness drag their votaries. He finally
died in a disgraceful rencontre in the streets of the same city where
he had so narrowly escaped a death but little different.</p>

<p>The quaint old town of Kaskaskia still holds a place upon the
map; and light hearts and simple lives are as numerous there as
ever. She has long been overshadowed by her neighbors; but if, in
her quiet streets, she miss the active bustle of the marts of commerce,
and lose something of the exhilaration of enterprise, she gains far
more in amiable cheerfulness, whose calm is not broken by the heated
passions, and sordid schemes of more engrossing pursuits.</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> lightning grew pale,
And the thunder was dumb.
As if the old devil
In person had come,
When in vengeance and fury
The Death-raven black,
The Vikingir <span class="smcap">Alvar</span>
Came sweeping the track.
"Great <span class="smcap">Odin</span>, thou storm-god!
Crack on with our ship!
We are off on a batter,
Hurrah! let her rip!"
So the wild pirate shouted
In madness and scorn,
While down went the liquor
And round went the horn.
        So all hands, as you see, kept
            a good head of steam on!</p>

<p class="stanza">By the sea, by the mountain,
On Norway's strand,
<!-- page 324 --><span class="smcap">Brenhilda</span>, the peerless,
Sat high on the sand;
When, smack! o'er the water
In time double quick,
Great <span class="smcap">Alvar</span> came down,
Like a thousand of brick.
Splash! into the ocean
The Vikingir sprung,
And pick-back the princess
O'er shoulders he flung:
Like an arrow he darted
The wild billows through,
And into the "Dragon,"
<span class="smcap">Brenhilda</span> he threw,
        While all hands gave a
            yell and took drinks on the strength of it!</p>

<p class="stanza">By the Gods of <span class="smcap">Valhalla</span>!
I'm done for!" she cried.
"By <span class="smcap">Thor</span> and by thunder!
You <i>are!</i>" he replied.
No more spake the maiden,
No more spake her lord,
But he stamped on the short deck
And brandished his sword.
"There's a sail to the leeward!
A <i>sail</i> in our path!
Do you hear! blood and brimstone!
Lok! blazes! and wrath!
The bier-sucker madness
Is boiling me through!"
Then he took a "long drink,"
And right into it flew,
        While the Ravens all
            round took a horn and went at it.</p>

<p class="stanza">Oh! then on the helmets
The death-biters rang,
While <span class="smcap">Alvar</span>, the Raven,
Swore, murdered, and sang:
<!-- page 325 -->"The deck is blood-painted&mdash;
A wound, all the bay&mdash;
While round rage the sea-wolves
And fight for their prey.
<span class="smcap">Brenhilda</span>! land-maiden!
Look up, and you'll find
How the Raven can 'go it,'
When once he's inclined.
See these skulls! how I split 'em!
These throats how I slice;
And all for thy sake, love!
Thou pearl beyond price!"
        So the fight being over
            they all went and liquored.</p>

<p class="stanza">"The <span class="smcap">Valkyries</span> scream
For the souls of the dead,
While <span class="smcap">Balder</span>, the Sun-God,
Shines down on our head!"
So, like good, pious fellows,
They knelt on the deck,
And thanked the great gods
That their foe was a wreck.
For on points of religion
Great <span class="smcap">Alvar</span> was "strict,"
And always "held prayers"
When a ship had been licked.
On a prisoner they found,
By unanimous vote,
They first carved the eagle,
And then cut his throat;
        Then, church being over,
            adjourned for refreshment.</p>

<p class="stanza">And over the ocean
And over the foam,
Like a shot from a shovel
The <span class="smcap">Vikingirs</span> come.
Loud roared the wild tempest,
Loud roared the mad sea,
<!-- page 326 -->But louder great <span class="smcap">Alvar</span>
Sang forth in his glee:
"Grim spectres sweep o'er us
In lightning or gloom,
I see their eyes gleaming
Like fire round a tomb:
The Runes of the valiant
Dead heroes obey,
Let's pitch into Naples
And plunder and prey!"
        So they gave him three cheers,
            and then emptied a barrel.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Set fire to the churches!
Set fire to the town!
Grab, murder, and plunder.
Drag out and knock down!
Go it strong, ye brave Northmen.
Crush, tumble, and slash!"
Roared the <span class="smcap">Jarl</span>, as with each hand
He held a mustache,
And glared on the town.
Like a wild devil grim:
An <span class="smcap">Aesir</span> in fury,
A <span class="smcap">Jotun</span> in limb.
Now the blue shields are crimson.
The spires are in flame,
But on pitch the Ravens,
All grit and all game:
        Only stopping to bolt
            down the wine on the altar.</p>

<p class="stanza">Like fiends winged for murder
The arrows flew forth,
While red swords were ringing
The knell from the North,
And maces, deep mashing,
Laid saints in the mud;
While the black crow and eagle
Went wading in blood.
<!-- page 327 -->But where flames were loud roaring
With Death by his side,
Rose the giant Jarl Alvar,
In glory and pride.
"We have thrashed them to flinders
And knocked 'em from time!
<span class="smcap">Brenhilda</span>, thou white one
Say&mdash;is n't it prime?"
        While the Northmen
            all round took a drink from their helmets.</p>

<p class="stanza">"The men are all murdered,
The town all aflame;
And we've bagged all the pewter;
Let's slope whence we came!
And under a full head
Of glory we go:
No <i>scald</i> now, thank <span class="smcap">Braga</span>!
Can chalk us as 'slow.'
To our Death Dragon hasten:
How stately and light
She rides the bright Belt
Of the Daughter of Night!
And be glad! for our voyage
Full plainly hath shown
That the gods, when we're pious,
Look after their own."
        So they took one good
            horn, and went off in the Dragon</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Marquis di Sangrido owns the grim old palace that
fronts the public square in Rieti. He is not a favorite with the
peasants. Even the children of that little Italian town pass the
great door or <i>portone</i> of the palace hurriedly, and their prattle sinks
into a whisper "beneath those gloomy windows. No guests ever come
from Rome and pass into the palace with festal welcome to visit the
Marquis di Sangrido. Those heavily-framed, gloomy windows never
flash with the brilliancy of revels within. They are like dead-lights&mdash;like
the staring eyes of a corpse.</p>

<p>When the summer-storms burst among the hills, and the gleaming
lightning and rattling thunders appal the superstitious peasants,
while the church-bell rings solemnly in the storm, and kneeling, with
muttered prayers, the poor people of Rieti shudder and make the
sign of the cross, the yellow palace of the Marquis di Sangrido
stands sullen in the tempest, sardonic with a sickly glare, against
the heavy black cloud that rises behind it.</p>

<p>On the holy feast-days, when the sun lies lazily in the great
square of Rieti all the long Italian morning, and the peasants, in gay

<!-- page 330 -->

costume, dance the Tarantella and the Saltarella, and with music and
flowers go into the church to hang votive pictures to the Madonna,
one suspending the shoe which he wore when Our Blessed Lady saved
him from drowning; and another, the cap of the child whom the
Holy Virgin raised from sickness; and another, the necklace which
her lover gave her when he went to the wars, from which he returned
safely; the Marquis di Sangrido does not come, nor look out of
those gloomy windows, nor send wine and money. But often in the
midst of the festival a fear falls upon the peasants, like a cloud-shadow
upon a waving, glittering rye-field; they look furtively at the
sullen yellow palace, which watches them in malicious silence; a
sudden horror seizes them all, as if they expected the great gates to
swing open, creaking upon rusty hinges, and a black procession of
death and despair to issue forth and chill the summer day.</p>

<p>It is in vain that the servants of the Marquis di Sangrido endeavor
to be friendly and sociable with the people of Rieti. They
are regarded as parts of that gloom and mystery which envelop the
palace and its master. Their most cheerful smile is suspected; their
jokes make the people shudder, for they believe them to be magic
spells in grinning masks. They move in a circle of solitude, for
every inhabitant of the town instinctively withdraws, until the servants,
too, gradually grow sardonic and gloomy; and when they
appear it is as if the yellow old palace were taking a walk, and
sullenly cursing the little cowering town of Rieti, that hides upon the
plain beyond the Campagna.</p>

<p>Twice a year the great gate of the palace opens. Then the people
shrink into their houses and peer through the windows and doors;
for the heavy lumbering state-carriage of the Marquis di Sangrido
rolls clumsily out, with a flaring chasseur riding before, and a dozen
servants on horseback grouped behind and around like a body-guard.
The doors are closed; the blinds are drawn up; nothing is seen within
the carriage; but the people of Rieti know that the Marquis is
sitting there, alone, in the shadow; and their terrified and bewitched
imaginations enter and sit beside him, and try to see the expression
of that face, and to conceive the grimness of his smile, and the
demoniacal horror of his frown. But not even their imaginations can

<!-- page 331 -->

figure him. The Marquis di Sangrido sits inscrutable, wrapped in a
cloud, and the lumbering state-carriage thunders out of the staring,
wondering town, and rolls across the Campagna toward Rome, where
the Marquis has another palace. Rieti is then very cheerful, for the
Marquis di Sangrido has gone to Rome.</p>

<p>Once again during the year the grim gates open, and the heavy
carriage, and the little group of servants, and the flaring chasseur
leading the way, are absorbed within the mysterious yellow walls;
and the little town of Rieti is chilled and trembles because the Marquis
di Sangrido has returned from Rome.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant summer-day when I came to Rieti, and after
eating the <i>frittata</i> and <i>prosciutto crudo</i> at the <i>albergo</i>, I looked idly
out of the window into the great square of the town. The sun
blazed upon the open place, and there was perfect silence in the air.
My eyes were dazzled, as I gazed, by the yellow wall of the palace;
and I called the landlord and asked the name of the owner.</p>

<p>"The Marquis di Sangrido," replied the <i>padrone</i>, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Is he here?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Excellency, no," returned the host as he moved away.</p>

<p>"But tell me, can I get into the house? there may be pictures&mdash;or
into the grounds?"</p>

<p>"Excellency, <span class="smcap">God</span> forgive us our sins! I know nothing," answered
the <i>padrone</i>, with such undisguised fear that I pressed him no farther,
and he withdrew.</p>

<p>Of course I sauntered out immediately toward the Sangrido
palace. I was sure that I had struck the trail of a romance; for
what are anguish, doubts, despairs, years of life lost in misery, all the
acutest forms of human woe, but romances to the traveller who
saunters out on warm summer mornings, when they are the tears and
the woes of other people and other years?</p>

<p>I paused before the great gate, sheltered from the sun by the
shade of the heavily-projecting mouldings, and almost feared to rattle
with my stick upon the massive panels. After a few moments the
slide was slipped, and a curious restless glance danced over my face
and figure, while a sharp low female voice inquired my business. I
answered that I was a stranger passing through Rieti, and wished to

<!-- page 332 -->

see the pictures in the palace, and also the garden, if it were possible.</p>

<p>After some sharp questioning, which I answered very simply and
directly, the gate was opened, and I entered the court. The garden
rose behind the palace in broad terraces upon the hill-side, and I went
directly toward it. The <i>custode</i>, who told me she was the only servant
left in the house, the Marquis being in Rome, disappeared, and I
passed up the broken, crumbling steps of the terrace in entire solitude.</p>

<p>The garden was fallen into decay. Weeds grew and glittered
in the walks. The long, narrow avenues of cypress and ilex
were not smooth and clipped, but untrimmed boughs and shoots
leaned out beyond the line and towered in slim, swaying twigs
above. In the misshapen niches of this green wall stood broken
statues of discolored marble; fauns holding to their mouths hands
whence the pipes had fallen; and nymphs who held vases and flowers
no longer. In <i>carrefours</i>, where the paths crossed, were huge globular
vases, broken and stained, but overflowing with the leathery leaves
of the aloe, like jagged green flame flaring and falling. The great
plants burst out luxuriantly from the crevices of the walls, and lay
sprawled over them, lazily sucking the sun, while the lizards darted
among them, half-loathsome miniatures of crocodiles; and high over
all, the dome-topped stone-pines lay like heavy bars of cloud in the
glittering air. In the universal sunshine and ruin, there were only
silence, sadness, and decay.</p>

<p>I passed along, perplexed with a strange and nameless sorrow,
and sat down upon the crumbling stone margin of a fountain, long
since dry, and in whose basin lay pebbles and twigs. A reverie in a
decayed garden naturally decks the trees again with the splendor of
long-vanished summers, trims them as they had once been trimmed,
and throngs the paths and the arbors with that host of the young
and beautiful which the imagination accords to all gardens, and
palaces, and happy haunts. But as I sat and dreamed, I felt my
self seized with the spell of mysterious horror which I had perceived
in the <i>padrone</i> at the inn, and saying with him, "<span class="smcap">God</span> forgive us all
our sins!" I arose and strolled along the melancholy avenues, and
descending the terraces, entered the house.</p>

<!-- page 333 -->

<p>I saw no <i>custode</i>. The old woman, I fancied, sure that I was no
thief, did not intend to disturb her siesta to look farther after me.
So I walked slowly on, and passing up the grand stone-staircase in
the cold hall, I entered the suite of state apartments. They were
lofty and spacious. The ceilings were painted in fresco, and there
was an unnatural freshness in the color, as if it was not the work of
many years before. The windows were heavily and richly draped.
The furniture was stately and costly, and the walls were tapestried.
There was an oppressive air of cold regal magnificence in each
apartment. There was nothing domestic; no pleasant disorder; no
gentle confusion, as if children had just fled from the rooms; nothing
that indicated a home; every thing that bespoke a ceremonial palace.
Some of the walls were not tapestried, and upon them hung pictures&mdash;mainly
portraits&mdash;soldiers in uniforms, and noblemen in
robes, or dignified Italian ladies in the stiff fashions of dead centuries.
At length I reached the state bed-chamber. In the centre of the
room stood the bed, ascended by steps, and muffled in thick clustering
draperies, covered with the crest of Sangrido. There was an
oratory adjoining, with a massive silver crucifix and a carved <i>priedieu</i>.
But my eyes clung with a painful curiosity to the solemnly-draped
bed. The curtains were black, and folded over it like a heavy
cloud; and as I gazed, the whole seemed to me to form a funeral
catafalque. Through the thick glass of the windows, rimed with the
gathered dust of years, and through the plain white muslin curtains
that hung over them like shrouds, the light came sickly and thin, and
the funeral drapery apparently thickened the air of the room. Instinctively
I stepped to the window, but I could not open it, and it
was so coated with obscurity that I could not look down into the
sunny square. I listened for a sound, but there was nothing to hear.
My own respiration was as audible as at midnight, and I turned back
into the solemn chamber. Almost involuntarily, and as if drawn by
an irresistible fascination, I climbed the steps that ascended to the
bed, and laying hold of the heavy black curtains, pulled them aside
and looked within them. There was nothing to be seen but a bed
fairly made; the linen yellow, as with time. But as I looked up I
saw something black hanging from the ring in the ceiling which held

<!-- page 334 -->

the drapery, so that the curtains made a funeral tabernacle for it. It
was beyond my reach, but I could see that it was a frame shrouded
in a black bag. It was evidently a picture: it must be a portrait.
Why shrouded in black? Why there?</p>

<p>As I stood upon the steps, still holding back the curtains, still
staring upward and wondering, I felt my foot forcibly seized, and
looking down, saw a shrivelled, bony hand grasping it. It was the
hand of the old <i>custode</i>, whose withered face, white and terrified, was
turned beseechingly toward me. The forefinger of one hand was
pressed over the mouth in sign of silence, while the other grasped
my foot. I descended the steps, and the old woman seized both my
hands with frenzied earnestness, and glared into my eyes, while her
frame trembled, and upon her wan lips quivered the words:</p>

<p>"For the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>, signor! For the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>, signor!"</p>

<p>I waited patiently for her to speak, which she did at length, in a
low, hurried, and appalled tone, begging me to leave the palace upon
the moment, and if I had the slightest regard for the life of a miserable
sinner, never to betray that I had penetrated so far as to see the
bed and the shrouded portrait.</p>

<p>"I fell asleep, signor, and did not hear you when you came in
from the garden. <i>O Dio! O Dio!</i>"</p>

<p>I left the yellow palace, and left Rieti, but not until I had learned
the secret of that picture.</p>

<p>Ten years before, the Marquis di Sangrido concluded to marry.
He was then sixty years old, a man of high family, of large fortune,
of good person. He ordered the state carriage and drove to Rome.
He was known everywhere, and was especially intimate with the
Countess Ondella, who was the guardian of her orphan niece, Maddalena.
The girl had grown up in a Venetian convent. She had
seen no man but Padre Giuseppe, who wore long clothes like the
women, and droned all the morning, and dozed all the afternoon, and
did not seem to be a man. To him she confessed regularly every
week. The old man usually went to sleep before the tale was over,
for there were no very startling sins to confess, but occasionally
strange thoughts and emotions, which Maddalena did not understand,
nor the good Giuseppe either. On the whole, it was pleasant childish

<!-- page 335 -->

tattle, which soothed him to sleep, in which he dreamed of other
times and other children, among whom was one child early habited
in a solemn separate robe and divorced from life. In the face of that
dream-child Padre Giuseppe seemed to see his own features, but delicate
and youthful, without wrinkles and snuff-stains. And so the
placid confessor dreamed until dinner-time, and feared, as he arose
and found that he must wipe the moisture from his eyes, that he was
getting old and rheumy.</p>

<p>Maddalena was taught the duty of all good children&mdash;to confess
and pray, and guard her mind from thoughts of men; never to tell
lies, and always to obey her elders. She listened and learned. In
the silent old convent-garden she read and mused, and vague hopes
and yearnings fluttered sometimes across her mind as she saw birds
floating in the sky, or bright leaves whirling and whirling, and then
dropping, dropping, until they were lost upon the ground. Sixteen
eventless years thus passed, and Maddalena Ondella was a woman.</p>

<p>One day, after having confessed to Padre Giuseppe, she went into
the garden at sunset, and sat upon a pedestal whence a statue had
long ago fallen. The vesper bell had ceased ringing; there was no
wind to stir the leaves, and the darkening twilight touched her beauty
with more exquisite grace as she sat motionless, gazing at the West,
longing and hoping, with all the passionate possibilities of life glimmering
in her luscious lips. That moment she was summoned by
the superior, and informed that she was to go to Rome immediately.</p>

<p>"Thank the Holy Virgin, Maddalena," said the abbess, "that you
are to be married to a noble and worthy man. In all things, my
child, remember our instructions, and obey your husband."</p>

<p>Padre Guiseppe's soft soul was touched. He shed tears as Maddalena
bade him farewell. The good Padre did not know how
beautiful she was, but the Marquis di Sangrido had accompanied the
Countess Ondella to Venice, three years before, and had then seen
her niece. Three years being past, he considered that he was sixty,
and concluded to marry. He came to Rome in the state-carriage,
and proposed to the Countess for Maddalena.</p>

<p>The aunt apprised the niece, and the day for the nuptials was
appointed. The Marquis di Sangrido had returned to his country-palace

<!-- page 336 -->

at Rieti after his proposals were accepted, and carried with
him workmen to decorate his house. Rieti was gay in the prospect
of a bride who would bring youth, beauty, and society to cheer its
loneliness. No one was permitted to see the work going on in the
yellow palace, but it did not lose in splendor by the eager gossip of
the town. One morning the workmen did not come. The work was
finished. The next morning the old state-carriage, newly burnished,
and drawn by the old horses in new and glittering harness, passed
out of the gates. The servants wore bridal-favors. The blinds were
drawn down, and the hard face of the Marquis di Sangrido returned
the gratulations of the town.</p>

<p>A few days afterward a courier came dashing into Rieti, and disappeared
in the palazzo Sangrido. It was rumored that the bride
would arrive before night, and at sunset the bridal <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> appeared.
A face more radiantly beautiful than they had ever seen beamed
gratitude upon the peasants, who threw flowers before the bride's
carriage, and the Marchioness Maddalena di Sangrido went into her
palace. There were money and wine distributed in the square of
Rieti that night, and prayers were uttered for the bride in the church
next morning by those she never saw.</p>

<p>From an old convent in Venice to an old palace in Rieti the
change was not great. But the change was entire in all the habits of
life; and sometimes, when Maddalena stole away to a lonely corner
of the garden, which had been trimmed and beautified in her honor,
she looked wistfully at the long range of hills undulating into the blue
distance; and, longing for a richer experience, shuddered as she
reflected that, while dreaming in the convent-garden, everything was
possible; but that, sitting in the garden of the palace, her future was
an endless iteration of the present. She grew sad and silent in the
rural splendors of Rieti.</p>

<p>The Marquis di Sangrido watched his wife with an intentness that
seemed ferocity. If she went alone into the garden he presently
appeared, and taking her arm led her back to the house, or paced
solemnly and silently at her side, along the stately green avenues.</p>

<p>He was of high family, and great fortune, and of good person.
The girls at the convent in Venice sauntered in the sunny garden, and

<!-- page 337 -->

talked, by stealth, of the happy Maddalena, and envied her splendid
fortune and career. Maddalena, in the sunny garden of Rieti, longed
for Venice, for companions, for life, for any thing. She grew pale,
like a flower in the dark.</p>

<p>The time came to go to Rome. Before ordering the carriage the
Marquis di Sangrido warned the Marchioness of the dangers of
society, and the duties of wives. Her eyes flashed alternate scorn
and longing as he spoke, and with a heart yearning and bursting, she
leaped into the carriage, while her brain swam with the sudden and
gorgeous hope of a new life. They reached Rome, and took possession
of the palace. F&ecirc;te followed f&ecirc;te. Everywhere Maddalena
was the idol of admiration. The elastic Italian tongue was compelled
into new forms of compliment; and she, like a thirst-stricken victim,
plunged into the stream of life and madly revelled. She tasted new
and wild experience, and quaffed it fiercely like burning wine. She
had scarcely reached Rome when she saw Giulio. Their eyes met,
then their hands. A week had not passed before they were ardent
lovers. The whole restrained passion of her nature rose at once to
flood-tide. The arrears of years were paid in moments. There was
imperial splendor in her beauty. At home, at church, at the opera,
upon the promenade, she was radiant, and wherever she was, Giulio
was by her side and in her heart. She did not try to disguise it.
The dames of high society thought her audacious, shook their fans,
and recommended prudence. Maddalena scoffed at their suggestions,
laughed prudence to scorn, and gloried in the tumult of her new life.</p>

<p>Before the shrewdest dame had even suspected, however, the Marquis
di Sangrido was sure. His eye grew like a serpent's eye, and
women shuddered as its livid glare fell upon them. His movements
became sinuous and stealthy. Like a reptile, he chilled the sunshine
as he slipped along the street to the Casino or the Caf&eacute;. To see him
was like being smitten with disease. At the opera, in church, upon the
promenade, he watched the young Giulio with his wife. Flowers
were not fair enough, nor the sun bright enough, nor the day long
enough for them.</p>

<p>The Marquis di Sangrido came home quietly one day an hour
before the time he had mentioned. He entered softly, and glided

<!-- page 338 -->

through the apartments, with spectral stillness, toward his wife's
room. His hard, cold face had a glacial intensity that froze with
horror the valet who saw him pass. Reaching the door of his wife's
room, he entered without knocking.</p>

<p>The Marchioness was not at the opera in the evening, nor at the
ball afterward, nor was she seen during the next day. The Marquis
and Marchioness di Sangrido had returned to Kieti. As the carriage
thundered into the town, the blinds were closed; there was no beaming
bridal face at the window; there were hurry and stern command,
and the great gate closed behind the carriage in sullen gloom.</p>

<p>In was a solemn and melancholy supper that the Marquis and his
wife eat that night. From his cold, hard face the snake had vanished,
but its frigid ferocity was more terrible; and the pale marble rigidity
of his wife was sadder to see. She rose from the table and passed
alone through the vast, cold, silent apartments toward her chamber.
Her heart was stony with the fixed resolve not to be baulked of life,
and love, and happiness, but at some time, by some means, to escape
the imprisonment of that palace, and dare the worst for Giulio.
She reached her room and dismissed her maid, who withdrew, leaving
her alone. Through the lofty windows the full moonlight streamed,
and flooded that young beautiful woman who stood with her hands
clasped before her, and her head leaning against the window-frame.
She was entirely abandoned to the glowing remembrance of the last
few weeks. One image, one memory, one hope, one thought, possessed
her. She was a child in knowledge and in power, but a
woman in passionate emotion. Like a stormy sea ebbing and flowing
fiercely in a cavern, her feelings, and wishes, and vows, fluctuated
through her mind, and she stood confounded by the greatness and
glory of the passion that agitated her whole being. She was its
slave, but knew not how to obey it. The night waned, and she stood
musing, her hands still clasped, her head leaning, when suddenly she
heard a chorus of late revellers, artists returning from a festa:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ah! senza amare,
Andare sul mare,
Col sposo del mare,
Non puo consolare!"</p>

</div>

<!-- page 339 -->

<p>The song was very distant and passed slowly out of hearing. Yet
it lingered and lingered. It haunted the moonlight; beseeching,
yearning, wailing; a whole history singing and sighing in its measures;
a whole history, at least, when a heart listened in which all
passionate powers thrilled and throbbed in answer.</p>

<p>Maddalena turned from her window, and walked slowly up and
down the chamber. She paused and loosened her dress. It fell away
from her like a cloud, and around her in the dark of the chamber, the
dim outline of the furniture was not more still than the statuesque
repose of her form. A faint, heavy odor from a vase of flowers filled
the room. She moved slowly away, and slowly seated herself upon
the edge of the bed, resting her head upon her hand, and murmuring
almost inaudibly, as if dreaming:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Ah! senza amare!"</p>

</div>

<p>The Marquis di Sangrido waited until he supposed that his wife
had reached her chamber. Then he passed quietly through another
door to a farther part of the palace, and entering a room which he
unlocked with a key that he took from his pocket, he closed and
locked it carefully behind him; then opening the small door of a cupboard
in the wall, he took from a shelf a large glass jar, full of a
green liquor, which he carefully examined; then closed and locked
the cupboard-door, and left the room. When he reached the dining-hall,
he summoned his valet, and ordered him to assemble all the
servants, who instantly came thronging in. After looking at them
sternly for a few moments, the Marquis said:</p>

<p>"I wish you all to return to Rome at an early hour in the morning.
I shall follow you two days hence. Vincenzo," he said to his
valet, "you will remain."</p>

<p>As the servants were leaving the room, he said to them with a
kind of hiss,</p>

<p>"If any man remains behind after to-morrow morning, he will
never see Rome again."</p>

<p>And with a shudder of fear the servants withdrew.</p>

<p>By dawn the next morning, they had all left the palazzo, and at

<!-- page 340 -->

sunrise were crossing the Campagna toward Home. As the Marquis
was finishing his breakfast, he ordered his valet to tell the maid of the
Marchioness that he wished to know when her mistress was awake.
As he arose from table, he gave the valet a letter for the Countess
Ondella, sealed with black, which he charged him to deliver as soon
as possible, and to make no delay in mounting and taking the road to
Rome. The valet bowed, took the letter, and in ten minutes was galloping
out of the town.</p>

<p>A little before noon, the maid appeared to say that her mistress
was awake. The Marquis bade her remain for a moment. He went
toward his wife's room, but immediately returning, told the maid
that her mistress preferred to dress alone, and wished her to go with
the <i>custode</i> to visit her sick child among the mountains.</p>

<p>"Stop and ask Padre Luigi to come instantly to the palace," said
he, "and return by evening, but not before, or you will take the fever
in the sun."</p>

<p>The maid and the old <i>custode</i> instantly departed. The suggestions
of the Marquis di Sangrido were the sternest commands to his
dependents.</p>

<p>He sat quietly for some time, until he heard a tap at the gate,
and, descending, he opened to the Padre Luigi. The priest muttered
a blessing as he entered, and followed the Marquis up the staircase.
They advanced together through the rooms until they reached the
chamber of the Marchioness. The priest paused a moment while the
Marquis passed in.</p>

<p>"Maddalena," said he to his wife, who was kneeling at her Prie-Dieu,
"Padre Luigi is here to receive your confession."</p>

<p>"I have none to make," returned she in a whisper, as a deathly
pallor settled upon her cheek.</p>

<p>The Marquis did not respond, but, opening the door, he beckoned
to the priest, who entered, and the Marquis retired.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" demanded Maddalena, suddenly springing
up.</p>

<p>"Signora, to hear your confession," replied the priest quietly.</p>

<p>"Go!" she said with a startled horror in her eyes, and pointing
toward the door.</p>

<!-- page 341 -->

<p>In vain the priest expostulated and besought her to confide to him
the grief that weighed upon her conscience, and to receive his consolation.
She said nothing but "Go!" and waved him away.</p>

<p>Padre Luigi passed out of the chamber. The Marquis waited in
the adjoining room, and, without speaking, led the way toward the
grand staircase. Still without speaking, they descended. The host
opened the gate; the priest murmured a benedicite, and departed.
Then the Marquis fastened the bolts and bars, locked the world out
from himself and his wife, and slowly ascended the staircase. He
went to the secret cupboard, where he had seen, on the previous evening,
that the jar full of a green liquid was safe, and taking it in his
hands, glided through the vast, silent rooms as spectrally still as
when in Rome he had entered his wife's chamber suddenly.</p>

<p>The Marchioness Maddalena was still kneeling at her Prieu-Dieu.</p>

<p>"You have, made your peace with God?" demanded the Marquis,
as he closed the door, and stood before her, holding the jar.</p>

<p>She rose slowly, with her eyes fastened upon his; and tottering
across the room, fell at his feet, and still staring in his face, gasped in
a piteous whisper:</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>He did not reply; but placing the jar upon the ground, he raised
his wife from the floor, and leading her toward a huge, carved, oaken
chair, he placed her upon it, and said in a voice cold and hard as his
rigid face:</p>

<p>"Maddalena, you must die!"</p>

<p>With silken cords which he drew from his pocket, he bound her
with inconceivable rapidity and firmness to the chair. She moaned
like a dying child. The suddenness and hopelessness of her fate
crushed her at once.</p>

<p>Tapestries and curtains hung about the chamber, and the summer
light streamed golden through the windows. But it was spectral and
dim to those young eyes. Upon the cypress terraces of the garden
fountains were plashing in the sunshine, and in the deep shade of the
trees cicadas sang. She thought of them all; she knew it well; but
not a sound reached her ears.</p>

<p>Her whole short life lay clearly before her: the Venetian garden,

<!-- page 342 -->

the dream, the marriage, the blight, the new hope, the love,
Giulio.</p>

<p>The Marquis raised the jar. The green liquor was vitriol. He
stood over her, behind, where he did not see her face. The first drop
fell upon her head.</p>

"O my <span class="smcap">God</span>!" she said slowly, "forgive my sins, but I love him
with my whole soul."</p>

<p>In startled Rieti there was constant and terrified surmise all the
day after the return of the Marquis and his wife. It was one of the
breathless, glaring days of midsummer; a day of preternatural
silence, when the sultry glare is a spell of terror, and men instinctively
talk in whispers. Not a wind sighed; not a bird sang. Only
at intervals a solitary cicada stung the ear with its dry, sad tone.
There was no dancing at the Osteria; the cattle and the dogs lay listless
in the shade; and as the awful heats deepened to noon, the inhabitants
were stretched in the shadow of the houses uneasily dozing, or,
starting suddenly from hot sleep, glanced with vague apprehension
about the sky, as if a fearful tempest were gathering.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp, agonized, muffled scream pierced the very heart
of that silence, and curdled the blood in the veins of the awe-stricken
peasants. They stared at each other speechlessly, sat transfixed as if
awaiting another sound; then, after long, breathless minutes, turned
their pale faces and whispered stealthily together&mdash;not quite sure if
that shriek were earthly; but muttering <i>Ave Marias</i>, and making the
sign of the cross, their eyes gradually turned, as by tacit conviction,
toward the grim palazzo Sangrido, standing sullen in the sun.</p>

<p>Vincenzo, the valet, upon his arrival in Rome, delivered to the
Countess Ondella the letter of the Marquis sealed with a black seal,
and informing her of the death of her niece, the Marchioness Maddalena.
The next evening, Padre Luigi and his brother monks celebrated
a funeral mass in the little church of Rieti.</p>

<br/>

<p>I heard this history after I had left the little town, but I was glad
of an opportunity of returning two years afterward. I found the
same padrone at the Osteria, and endeavored to learn from him and
from the peasants something farther about the Marquis di Sangrido.

<!-- page 343 -->

He was an old man, they said hideously ugly. They believed,
evidently, that he had horns and hoofs. But no one confessed that he
had ever seen him.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival, I went again to the palazzo. The same
old woman examined and admitted me, evidently without recognizing
me as the audacious stranger who had penetrated to the black and
solemn chamber. She told me that I could not go into the palace,
because the Marquis was living there, and would not go to Rome for
several weeks; but I had her permission to stroll in the garden.</p>

<p>It was even more ruinous than before. Everywhere reigned the
same desolation and sadness&mdash;doubly sad and desolate now that I
knew the story. Yet everywhere in Italy you feel the possibility of
such tragedies. Robert Browning's poem of "My Last Duchess"
and Beckford's tale of the old woman near Naples are simple studies
from life. The old villas and gardens crumbling in that hot southern
sun are like memorials of the fierce excesses of hot southern passion.
Love, hate, enthusiasm, revenge, despair, dark eyes, black hair, the
stiletto, ignorance and mystery, ambition and superstition&mdash;these are
the quick-glancing threads of which that life is spun. Venice explains
Venice. The Council of Ten, the Bridge of Sighs, the Piombi, Marino
Faliero, as well as Titian and Don Juan, are all bred of that silence,
splendor, and isolation.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I turned into a neglected ilex-path, I met an old man.
He might have been seventy years of age; he was still erect, and
long white hairs clustered around his cold, hard face. He paused
courteously, saluted me with dignity, and bade me good day. Perceiving
from my reply that I was a foreigner, he stopped and fell into
conversation. In all that he said the shrewd observation of the man
of the world was evident. He was familiar with the current gossip,
spoke of society in Rome, of the belles and the beauties. Passing to
pictures and the subjects that most interest strangers, he showed himself
a judicious critic and connoisseur. Of certain pictures he spoke
with a kind of cold ardor that was very singular, and as I mentioned
one that I had seen in the palazzo Mazzo in Rome, he discovered that
his friend, the Cardinal Mazzo, was also a friend of mine, and immediately

<!-- page 344 -->

invited me to dine with him on the following day; but I
hastily declined upon plea of my early departure.</p>

<p>After a little more conversation, he bowed and wished me good
morning.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that my pictures are all in Rome," said he, as he
turned away. "There are none in the house yonder," he continued,
pointing toward it through the cypresses, "of any interest to those
out of the family."</p>

<p>So saying, the Marquis di Sangrido disappeared down the terraces.</p>

<p>But I remained in the solitary, sunny garden, remembering the
black-shrouded picture, looking along the paths that Maddalena had
paced. The tragedy of Maddalena was wringing my heart, but the
sun shone bright, the nightingales sang, the wind blew gently, and the
courteous tones of the Marquis were ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">God</span> forgive us all our sins!" I said as I recalled the words of
the <i>padrone;</i> and I passed swiftly and for ever out of the garden and
the gate of the Palazzo Sangrido.</p>

<h3 id="c32">To a Beautiful Girl.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY GEORGE D. PRENTICE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Beautiful</span> girl! I have wandered far
Toward the rising sun and the evening star;
I have roamed 'mid the northern wastes of snow,
And strayed where the soft magnolias blow,
But I never gazed on a face so bright
As thine, sweet spirit of young delight.</p>

<p class="stanza">Beautiful girl! thou art bright and fair
As an angel shape in the moonlight air;
No shadow rests on thy brow of snow,
Save that of thy tresses drooping low.
Love's own dear light is wandering oft
O'er thy gentle lip of carmine soft.
Thy lovely cheek, where the rich, red glow
Of the warm blood melts through the virgin snow,
Is sweetly blending in one bright dye,
The woven beauties of earth and sky.
Truth, holy truth, in its freshness dwells
Deep, deep in thy dark eyes shaded wells,
And fancies wild from their clear depths gleam,
Like shadows of stars from a trembling stream;
And thy thoughts are a dream of Eden's bowers,
And thy words are garlands of flowers, bright flowers.</p>

<p class="stanza">Beautiful girl! I have seen thee move,
A floating creature of joy and love,
As light as a mist on the sunrise gale,
Or the buoyant sway of a bridal vail,
<!-- page 346 -->Till I almost looked to see thee rise
Like a soaring thought to the free blue skies,
Or melt away in the thin, blue air,
Like a vision of fancy painted there.
Thy low sweet voice, as it thrills around,
Seems less a sound than a dream of sound;
Softly and wildly its clear notes swell,
Like the spirit-tones of a silver bell;
And the lips whence the fairy music flows
Is to Fancy's eye like a speaking rose.</p>

<p class="stanza">Beautiful, beautiful girl! thou art
A vision of joy to the throbbing heart;
A star sent down from the world of bliss,
And all undimmed by the shades of this;
A rainbow pictured by <span class="smcap">Love's</span> own son
On the clouds of being, beautiful one!</p>

<p class="stanza">Beautiful girl! 't is a weary year
Since thy sweet voice fell on my ravished ear;
'T is a long, long year of light and gloom
Since I gazed on thy young cheeks' lovely bloom:
Yet thy gentle tones of music still
Through the holiest depths of memory thrill
Like tones of a fount, or breeze, or bird,
In the long-gone years of childhood heard.
And oft in my dark and lonely moods,
When a demon wing o'er my spirit broods,
Thine image seems on my soul to break
Like the sweet young moon o'er a gloomy lake,
Filling its depths, as the shadows flee,
With beauty and love and melody.</p>

<p class="stanza">Beautiful girl! thou art far away,
And I know not where thy steps now stray;
But oh! 't is sweet, it is very sweet,
In the fairy realms of dreams to greet
Thy cheek of rose, thy brow of pearl,
And thy voice of music, beautiful girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corydon and Thyrsis</span> no longer pipe to Phyllis, and Phyllis goes
no more about with a wreath on her crook. This we all know&mdash;and
those among us who are poets, with the down of youth upon our
cheeks, remember with a sigh&mdash;and look to find in our summer
rambles in the country, not shepherdesses to whom we may pay sentimental
court, and with whom breathe air redolent of thyme and
goat's-milk, but <i>pensionnaires</i> from Madame M&eacute;re de Treubleu's
famous school, and scented rather too lavishly, as country belles are
apt to be, with the last fashionable perfume of Mons. Lubin's laboratory.
Unless one travel quite beyond the circle of the city's influence,
into the purely rustic regions, where two-pronged forks at table,
and sun-bonnets still hold their own, but where Corydon and Phyllis,
alas! are not more recognized, it is vain to imagine the gauds and
vanities of the metropolis left behind. Haughty Georgiana of last
winter's balls, who, forgetting her pedigree&mdash;old McKrell having
begun life a fishmonger&mdash;suffered you to lead her to the floor by the
tips of her white kids, as any other queen might a subject, finds a
parallel, for example, in the persons of the two Misses Snack, co-heiresses
of the little fortune accumulated by the country-practice of
the late Dr. Snack, their papa; both tall, both dressy, and perfectly
conscious of their superior attainments and momentary position.
They differ, it is true, on most points, but are united in this that
their country admirers, the most constant of whom are Jenkins, who
wears such preposterous collars, and is a clerk down the street, and

<!-- page 348 -->

Stump, the short attorney, can be tolerated only so long as there are
no arrivals from the city; precisely as Miss Georgiana gave the
cold shoulder to your pleasantries and bon mots the very evening that
young ape, Prunelle, exhibited his waxed moustache and French graces
within her circle. In like manner, chaperoning Mrs. Van Waddlevurst,
all embonpoint, turban, and pomp, who carries that bashful
blonde, her niece, to every Rout and At Home, under her wing, as it
were, and brings it about that every young fellow of ton in the room
shall be presented to her, in the vain hope of eclipsing sparkling
Celeste, who sways all hearts this season, is she not re-produced in
sanguine Mrs. Brown&mdash;slim though she be, and with her hair put up
in a rather sparse knot on the summit of her head, and the same
everlasting smile upon her face, most unlike dowager Van Waddlevurst's
fat dignity of chin, who has not ceased to indulge in various
secret dreams of distinction, founded on her Amelia Ann's accomplishments,
ever since the return of that young lady from finishing-school.
Mrs. Brown, indeed, is a woman of more energy than the
dowager, having been compelled, for many years, (since Brown's
demise,) to battle for herself; but she drags about and placards the
attractiveness of her Amelia Ann, a shame-faced girl, who seldom
answers except in monosyllables, with much the same good taste that
Mrs. Van W. does <i>her</i> Amelia.</p>

<p>It is only you, O sweet Mary Jones, who have not been spoiled
by living in a city. It is only you who go about singing or humming
one of the songs you learned long before you came to be taught those
grand symphonies from the opera of the Don, which the Miss Snacks
performing together draw a chorus of bravas from the throats of
moustached visitors, when the season for moustached visitors has
arrived. Yes, it is certainly you, pretty, lovable Mary Jones,
swinging your cottage bonnet about by its blue ribbons, and glancing
here and there with eyes quite as blue, and a great deal pleasanter to
behold, even were a man-milliner the arbiter, who, for the first time,
perceives the young gentleman seated yonder by his fish-basket on
the bank, who has been looking at you all this while with so much
attention, not to say pleasure, that a perch has actually, after many
delightful bobs, drawn his float under the surface and become entangled

<!-- page 349 -->

among the roots and weeds at the bottom, without his captor
being any the wiser for it.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Jones&mdash;to assume a past tense, for these events have
long gone by&mdash;halted then in her walk and in the song she was
singing, in the pleasantest of voices, half aloud, and a little natural
color came up into her face, partly, perhaps, because she found herself
an object of attention, when she imagined the trees and birds
only composed her audience; and partly, because the observation
which she had courted seemed unlikely to be speedily withdrawn.
The young gentleman, with his back to the trunk of a beech, and his
eyes diverted from their proper occupation of watching his float,
seemed to relish the effect of his curiosity, it must be admitted, and
surveyed the nymph with a smile which would have appeared impertinent
but for a challenge at recognition in it when his glance encountered
the momentary surprise in those blue orbs of sweet Mary
Jones. It did not please the nymph, however, to accept the acquaintance
so proffered, and with the slightest possible <i>moue</i> in rejoinder,
she turned into a path branching off opportunely from that by which
she had approached, and would soon have left the scene of her interrupted
solitude, and perhaps the memory of it, behind her. But the
first comer entertained other views, it seemed. He promptly rose
when about to be deserted, and finding his line tangled, as shown
above, without ado snapped it in twain. Had it been too strong for
him, he would have thrown the rod and all into the stream rather
than be baffled, for it was part of the character of this young gentleman
to take the shortest means at hand for ridding himself of the
last pleasure in anticipation of the next in order. This done, he presented
himself before our heroine, who, to say the truth, had not
advanced far, nor seemed in much haste to go. She had stopped to
pull a wild violet, but then she had dropped it again; and when she
stooped to recover it, Mr. Clarence Van Trump, who was the angler,
had it already in possession, and presently protested he could part
with it on no terms, and would set it in water when he got home;
though I believe he really put it in his vest pocket, and there forgot
it, nor beheld it again for many months after all the events in this
tale had transpired. This was not all either; Miss Mary Jones

<!-- page 350 -->

carried her bonnet&mdash;a pretty little bonnet with blue lining and
ribbons, which must have made it become her exceedingly when on&mdash;slung
over her arm for the occasion, and filled with flowers, which
last, in the flutter incidental to the loss of the violet, were liberally
scattered over the ground.</p>

<p>Her companion gathered them again, with a slight laugh: "Then
you really have forgotten me?" he said, while so employed. "I who
once fished and hunted for your especial benefit, and have never been
in love since! Suppose I had been on the opposite side of this mill-race,
and so unable to reveal myself, and you had gone away as you
were doing a minute ago without recognizing me? I know I should
have fallen into a state of low melancholy. Oh! by Jove! I recollect,"
the young gentleman added, rising in a sudden and stroking the
ornament in question, " 't is this moustache&mdash;this grisly moustache
which makes the difference&mdash;and come now! I lay an even wager&mdash;this
violet against your bonnet of flowers&mdash;that who the present
speaker really may be is a question this moment in your&mdash;a, well&mdash;lovely
head."</p>

<p>The lovely head was shaken half-pettishly, half in denial. "I
knew you very well, Mr. Clarence," the owner of it said, "but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mr. Clarence.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;am not to be treated like a school-girl."</p>

<p>"No?" said Clarence, laughing.</p>

<p>"No. And as for your moustache disguising you"&mdash;here the
blue eyes of Miss Jones glanced at the downy indication of a beard
which the owner thereof had termed <i>grisly</i>, and whether that a moustache
is always fascinating in female eyes, or that it was not in the
power of such celestial orbs to long display anger toward any one,
all appearance of vexation quickly vanished, and her companion held
out his hand, from which he had drawn his glove. Yes, this young
Brummel had been actually angling in gloves, the identical white
kids in which, perhaps, he had handed Miss Georgiana McKrell, or
the lively Mrs. Tomtit to supper, two weeks before, at Newport!</p>

<p>Indeed, if Miss Mary Jones had failed to remember in Mr.
Clarence Van Trump the little boy in corduroy pantaloons who had
been her assiduous "sweetheart" once upon a time years before,

<!-- page 351 -->

when he had come down to spend the vacation with his uncle, the
patroon, and slept in the identical bed-room, with the chintz curtains
and patchwork quilt of faded satins, manufactured by the fingers of
his great grandmother, which he occupied on the occasion of his present
visit to that distinguished relative from whom his expectations
were so great; if Miss Mary had failed to recall the shame-faced
little lover in this smart young fellow, whose costume must have
astonished the fishes, and was certainly not of a kind with that they
had been used to regard upon the persons of the anglers of that
region, there would have been no just cause for wonder. Had he not
been abroad meanwhile, and mingled, as all our countrymen do, in
the best foreign society? Were not his manners now so far from
being <i>distrait</i> as almost to fall into the opposite extreme of too great
assurance? and was he not esteemed by all the young ladies of his
set in the city, a love of a man? and finally, was not his present nose
as unlike that through which, as a boy, he had had that ugly habit of
sniffling; and his face as dissimilar from the beardless and freckled
cheek of that period, as time, nature, and a careful employment of
art could make them?</p>

<p>But after all, there was no merit really in Miss Jones' recognition.
She had quite forgotten the lover of three feet six, when one day,
walking with Madame Treubleu's <i>pensionnaires</i> through Lafayette
Place, two youngsters dashed by in a trotting wagon, not so fast but
that Miss Simmons, who, being the chum of Miss Jones, was then, as
ever, linked arm in arm with our heroine, had time to recognize a
cousin, of whom she was naturally proud, and his friend.</p>

<p>"Why, lor!" Miss Simmons exclaimed, "if there ain't Prunelle
and Mr. Van Trump. O my! such lovely eyes as Mr. Van Trump
has, you can't think! I saw him at my aunt's soir&eacute;e the other night,
though no body introduced him to me. They say he is going to see
his great uncle, who lives in our village, you know. Won't it be
funny if he waits till we go home ourselves, and pays attention to a
certain some body and makes some body else jealous? You <i>know</i> you
would fall in love with him," Miss Columbia Simmons says to her
friend, giggling behind her fan; "he is so handsome, and he said he
was your sweetheart when you were no bigger than Nanny Fogg
there."</p>

<!-- page 352 -->

<p>"Poh! what nonsense!" her friend replies, and changes the topic.
But she did not dismiss it from her mind, for that very evening she
wrote a name in the fly-leaf of her Italian grammar which, when her
chum looked over her shoulder, she hid, or attempted to hide, with
quite a show of color, and some confusion. But Miss Columbia having
pulled away the hand, in school-girl fashion, read it and laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah! you naughty, funny thing!" said she, " '<i>Mrs. Clarence Van
Trump!</i>" Ah, won't some body be jealous!"</p>

<p>Now, although tender-hearted little Mary Jones repented on that
occasion, and actually shed tears upon her pillow after her chum was
asleep, and called herself I don't know how many hard names for her
hard-heartedness in forgetting, for an instant, all the good qualities of
one Thomas Elkhart, and how devoted to her, and what a genius he
was, and a great deal more; it was not in the nature of a young
lady on the point of leaving boarding-school, and whose patronym
was merely Jones, to despise the probability, or shun at all times the
thought, of being one day received into the distinguished connection
of the great Van Trump family. Was not that family the most
aristocratic in America, and possessed of estates and tenantry which
made them almost resemble the dear old romantic barons of feudal
times? Had not old Van Trump, the major-general, pounded over
and over again upon the floor or ground, as the case might be, with
his splendid gold-headed cane, the better to enforce his views, and
averred that&mdash;"A Van Trump, Sir, is fit to marry a princess, Sir, and
ought, by right, to hold the position of perpetual chief magistrate of
this country, Sir, without the fiddle-faddle of the ballot-box!" And
was not the old patroon who lived in her (Mary Jones') own village,
but had very little to do with any body there, so dreadfully proud
that people said he ate with nothing less than gold spoons? gold
spoons&mdash;think of that! The idea of one of this distinguished
family paying court to so undistinguished a maiden as Miss Mary
Jones was perhaps enough to turn the head of a school-girl who had
devoured any quantity of romances during the past eighteen months,
and was not wiser or more experienced than girls in their teens usually
are.</p>

<p>But crotchets such as these are not the offspring of young heads

<!-- page 353 -->

only; and it might be that Mrs. Jones herself entertained some
vague wishes, not to say anticipations, when, looking from her door
step on the afternoon with which this tale commences, in search
of Miss Mary, for whom their early country tea waited and gave
out such an odor of Bohea and fresh cakes from the back-parlor,
whom should she behold but that truant, accompanied by Mr.
Clarence Van Trump, elegantly flourishing his fishing-rod, now reduced
to the size of a stout cane, and wonderfully resembling the
paternal gold-headed one. Perhaps he was taking off that swagger
of the brigadier-general, the better to illustrate an incident in which
they two had had a share on the sands of Newport, at which Miss
Mary and himself were now laughing. At all events, the pair of
young people were as sociable as if Mr. Clarence had never lived
elsewhere than with his great uncle, the patroon, and as Mrs. Jones
thought, with pride in her heart, on their coming up.</p>

<p>That estimable lady, after the first glimpse she had obtained of
her daughter's escort, had slipped into her chamber, hard by, and
donned, a new and famously be-bowed cap, the pretty handiwork
of Mary herself, before you could say Jack Robinson; and reappeared
as if she had not been guilty of that sly man&oelig;uvre. She
even affected for a moment to overlook the presence of the heir
of the patroon.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clarence Van Trump," Miss Mary said, smilingly presenting
that young gentleman, who bowed elegantly, as his wont is.
Mrs. Jones also dropped a courtsey in the manner of a lady's maid
on the boards, which she believed to have a stylish effect, and to show
her familiarity with good society. "Columbia is here," Mrs. J. remarks
to her Mary, inclining her head in the direction of the parlor,
"and Mr. Tom. He has something wrapped in a cloth which he will
not let us see. You do n't know Mr. Thomas Elkhart, do you, sir?"
says Mrs. J. to Clarence.</p>

<p>"I really haven't the pleasure," Mr. Clarence returns, glancing at
our heroine, who does not look at him, but colors, a little, perhaps.
"Is tea ready?" she asks mamma, and mamma takes the hint.</p>

<p>"I trust you will give us the pleasure of your company at our
humble board," the dear soul says, with much urbanity and state;

<!-- page 354 -->

and when our young gentleman, after pretending to hesitate on the
score of the solitary condition of his uncle, whom the rogue knew
to be at that hour, namely, candle-light, on the eve of getting into
bed, allows himself to be entreated, and declares taking tea in that
house reminds him of the happy days of his boyhood. Mrs. Jones,
I am bound to say, being of a sanguine turn of mind, began to speculate
in earnest upon the probability of a certain desirable event.</p>

<p>It has just been disclosed that the elder Van Trump&mdash;not the brigadier-general,
but the patroon&mdash;retired with the sun, or a little later,
partly because his constitution and senile infirmities required, and
partly because, having few associates among his immediate neighbors,
the best way of disposing of the tedium of the evenings was to cut it
short altogether. During the occasional visits of his grand-nephew
and heir, it is true, the last-named motive could not be said to exist,
but it was scarce worth his while, the old man thought, to break in
upon a habit of years growth for a satisfaction of ten days standing;
so Mr. Clarence, had he staid at home on the night in question,
would have had a dull time of it in the library, yawning or dozing
over a few dusty gazetteers or odd volumes of magazines, containing
such tales as delighted our grandmothers a half century back. To
own the truth, however, it was not the habit of our young gentleman
to spend many hours of the evening within the recesses of the dismal
pile known among the villagers as the 'Squirery, on the occasions of
his visits; and occasionally he was absent&mdash;looking at the moon,
perhaps&mdash;at least, that was what he told the ancient housekeeper&mdash;most
of the night. But at breakfast-table, next morning, Mr. Clarence
was sure to present himself, whence-ever he might last come,
and make himself agreeable to the great proprietor sitting opposite,
sipping his weak tea, and wagging his revered head at the sallies and
gossip of his youthful kinsman. The morning after the evening spent
in Miss Mary Jones's society, the Joneses were, of course, the text.</p>

<p>"You ought to have seen Mother Jones, Sir!" Mr. Clarence said.
That was the scarcely respectful way in which he chose to designate
that worthy lady. "Such attention as she paid me! By Jove! if I
had eaten half the sweet-meats, only, she put upon my plate at supper,
you would have had to send for Snack's successor before morning.

<!-- page 355 -->

I was obliged to take refuge from her in the conversation of
her lovely daughter, who plays the deuce-knows-what, all upon a piano
that has a distinct jingle in most of the chords, as if a handful of silver
were dancing a jig upon them. And then there was a sandy-haired
young lady present&mdash;a hand-and-glove friend of little Mary Jones, I
presume, who could not help casting admiring glances at your humble
servant all the evening, and would have fallen in love at a moment's
notice if I had given her half a chance. As it was, she told
me she had seen me at a crush at one of Prunelle's confounded low
relatives', where I went to please him, and also somewhere in the
streets, I believe. What do you think they call her, Sir? by Jove!
you could never guess: 'Columbia;' patriotic, ain't it? Columbia
Brown, or Smith, or something."</p>

<p>"Simmons, Columbia Simmons, I know," the old gentleman says,
nodding and chuckling. It quite rejuvenates him to listen to the
prattle of his nephew. "Ah! ah! you young rogue," the senior adds
presently, while the young rogue sips his coffee, and smirks a little
complacently behind his old-fashioned mug; "I see how it was; you
had it all your own way. If there had been some other youngster
present, you would not have thought widow Jones and the rest of
them setting their caps for you, aha!"</p>

<p>"Why, for the matter of that," says Mr. Clarence, no ways
abashed, "I was not precisely <i>cavalier-seul</i>, you know. There was
one Buckhart, or Elkhart, or something of the sort there&mdash;a not
ill-looking fellow for his station, which I take to be that of a mechanic.
But his style of costume; by the lord Harry! Sir. I looked at
him with as much curiosity as if he had been a South Sea Islander,
and, to say the truth, he regarded me rather cavalierly in turn. He
had something wrapped in a handkerchief, which might have been the
remains of his dinner for any thing I know, though he had better have
left it, in that case, in the passage, instead of on the centre-table in the
parlor. Who is he?" Mr. Clarence asks with a short laugh. "Does
he do jobs for you in brick and mortar? I fancied his hands looked
rather gritty, Sir."</p>

<p>"No, no; not he, but his grandfather did," the great-uncle returns.
"Elkhart, the potter; that water-jug was made at his pottery. And

<!-- page 356 -->

that's where he made the money this young fellow is to have directly,
they say. We old fellows stand in you youngsters' shoes unreasonably
long; hey, Clary, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Not in mine, Sir; <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>  forbid!" Mr. Clary says piously and
hypocritically.</p>

<p>"Well, well, what were we talking about? Elkhart, the potter.
No, young Elkhart&mdash;Tom, I think they call him. Instead of making
jugs and pots, his turn is for modelling little figures in clay, and very
pretty figures, too, if Bridget here is to be credited. Bridget was in
their house awhile, were n't you, Bridget?" And Bridget, who, broom
in hand, chanced to be slipping through to arrive at a neighboring
chamber, stops, nothing loth, and drops a low courtsey. "Sure an' he
does," she says, "the beautifullest things iver was seen, Sir. Sure
an' did n't he make the Blissed Virgin, Holy Mother of Hiven, out
of as much mud&mdash;thrue as I'm standing here, Sir&mdash;as might go in
your tay-cup! And more than that, though not wishing to be mintioned
in the same breath, me and my ould blind mother, Sir, the first
time we came to the old gintleman's house, my mother houlding me
by the hand, and groping with her staff like, and me a-wearing the tore
bonnet which the mistress Hannagan gave me in the ould country,
sure, and set us up on the mantel-shelf where any body can see us to
this blissed day for the asking. An agin, my own pathron Saint
Bridget, which," says Bridget, suddenly dropping a curtsey and her
broom, and disappearing to return again presently and take up her
sentence where interrupted, "will your honors be pleased to igxamine?"</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Clarence Van Trump, though at the time a fop, and, I
am afraid, a little of a <i>rou&eacute;</i>, was neither a blockhead nor so ignorant
of art as most of his compeers. He had not spent all, if he had the
greater part, of his time, in Paris in the cafes and hells, or places
worse yet, and by mere occasional contact with artists and connoisseurs,
had picked up some slight acquaintance with the subject under
consideration. Neither was he ill-natured or apt to bear malice,
though his self-love had been slightly wounded the evening previous
by the young sculptor, or modeller, if you will, having failed to do
him homage, I believe. On that occasion he had planned to avenge

<!-- page 357 -->

himself by flirting with little Mary Jones, and making her lover, as
he more than suspected him to be, miserable during his (Van Trump's)
stay in the vicinity. But Bridget's patron saint caused him to forget
his resolve the moment he had taken the figure into his hand.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said he ingenuously, "it is wonderful! by Jove, it
is! and as good as What-d'ye-call-em, the great modeller's, in Paris.
I can guess now what was in the cloth on the table: something pretty
for Miss Mary Jones, I'll be bound. I'll ask her to show it to me,
and I'll get him to let me see his Madonna, and Bridget's likeness,
and the rest. I'll make friends with him, I will, by Jove!" cried our
young dilletanti, and meant all he said.</p>

<p>Even pretty Mary Jones had not seen what the thick cloth concealed
the night before, until Miss Simmons had been duly escorted
home, over the way, and young Van Trump, believing the enemy to
have abandoned the field, went away himself. That young gentleman,
however, would have smoked his cigar with less gusto on his
way to bed, had he surmised that, however his whispered flatteries
had fluttered the little heart of our heroine, and for the matter of that
of castle-building mamma also, not one pang of jealousy had he yet
created in the breast of his single-minded rival. Why should he
(Elkhart) have been miserable? He had formed his own estimate of
the worth of elegant Mr. Clarence, and scarce troubled himself, save
in one instance, to enter the lists into which that accomplished cavalier
desired to lure him, sure of victory in the end. While Mr. Clarence
was turning the music, and singing second, and otherwise manifesting
his interest and admiration, though secretly amused and purposing
to take it all off to a few of his friends in the city some day
after dinner, Elkhart stood by with an ear only for the one voice out
of three, which to him always discoursed melody. For him there
were no jingling keys in the whole ricketty piano-forte, no false note
in Miss Columbia's singing, even when she dropped her handkerchief
and picked it up tittering, (Mr. Clarence feigning blindness on the
occasion,) and fell again into her place in the concert. For him
"Mary Jones" was a name interchangeable with "angel," and where
she dwelt by no means the humble residence the widow's house in
reality was, and such as Mr. Clarence unmistakably perceived it.

<!-- page 358 -->

All through his art, like a vein of gold in the clay he modelled, the
thought of her beauty, her sweetness, her excellences ran: "If I
could but model her as she appears to me!" he thought over and
over; but, then, what artist who is a lover can? "With wings upon
her shoulders and the softly flowing white dress she wears on midsummer
afternoons, I think all the world would stop and hold its
breath for reverence and love of a figure and face so celestial!" And
so, though the task seemed impossible, he had set about it in earnest,
and labored on in secret and patiently, until there stood your prototype,
prettier, perhaps, than yourself, but still yourself and none
other, O gentle Mary Jones! A charming figure it was, too; not a
copy of an antique, or modelled after rules of ancient art; but possessing
a maiden-like purity of outline which made equally consistent
the muslin skirt or the wings which were not at first sight visible;
they were budding wings, rather than matured, and so, perhaps, helped
to embody his ideal of a person he believed to be mortally perfect.</p>

<p>When Senator Mac&aelig;nas saw the statuette&mdash;it was nearly life-size,
and the most ambitious our hero had modelled&mdash;he had much
ado to persuade the young sculptor to send it to a neighboring city;
but that he did so, and found himself famous, and that Senator Mac&aelig;nas
subsequently obtained for him the order for the great national
work in marble upon which he is now engaged, we all know; for it is
not a part of the policy of that great man to keep secret the good
deeds he perpetrates, but rather to let both hands know what either
may be doing. But let us all hope, for our hero's sake, that <i>this</i> great
work may not resemble the wonderful pantomime in marble of
COLUMBUS perpetually performing on the steps of the national Capitol,
which does so much credit to the taste of the committee who accepted
it, and is so much more laughable than any pantomime that was ever
acted before.</p>

<p>Before it went, however, young Elkhart made a copy of his earth-angel
<i>in piccolo</i>, and this it was that he brought for a gift to the fair
original. She only, of all the village, had seen and praised the statuette;
and with her pretty dimpled chin resting in her hand, watching
the unwrapping of its lesser fac-simile, was it that she was reminded
of the blissful occasion, when they two, standing before his best work,

<!-- page 359 -->

she had conceived herself honored in the love of this young artist,
moustacheless though he were, and by no means so elegantly winning
in address as our friend Van? But, O Mary Jones! of whom as a
heroine nothing but good should be predicated, how can I bring myself
to declare what really occupied your thoughts? "Did they really
and truly use a service of gold up in the 'Squirery yonder? and how
fine it must be to dine off plate!" were the initial words of your
reverie. And when young Elkhart had unswathed the graceful copy
of your own unworthy self, and asked, with a slight dash of disappointment
in his voice, perhaps, Was it not like the other, and Did n't
you like it? it was not a flush of pleasure that rose to your cheek, so
much as a blush for your own faithlessness.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful! How good you are to me!" she exclaimed,
awaking with a start, and, as has been said, a blush; and leaning over
the statuette, half concealed both her face and it in a cloud of curls;
and be sure Elkhart repeated to himself many times on his way home
those simple words, and built as many castles in Spain (though of different
materials) as Mrs. Jones herself was doing about the same
time.</p>

<p>That excellent lady, though no strategist, was as fond as her sex&mdash;and
for the matter of that, ours, too&mdash;of having her own quiet way,
and so the next forenoon, when our friend Van T., having yawned and
bored himself to the extent of his capacity at home, bethought himself
of paying the Joneses a morning visit, but in the end changed his
mind, and sent a note instead, soliciting the pleasure of driving out
Miss Jones in the cool of the afternoon; and when the fair recipient
of the note remembered the trotting wagon in which Mr. Clarence
and his friend had dashed by in Lafayette Place, and how delightful it
must be, but recalled also a promise given to some body else the past
evening, and sent a polite excuse, the widow, who took the message
to the door in person, added a protocol to the effect that if Mary could
not, Miss Columbia might: a message which amused Mr. Clarence,
and of which, on cross-questioning the servant who brought it, he sagaciously
divined the latent purport.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that without the least intention of honoring the
last-named young lady, and to whom, though she had spent the major

<!-- page 360 -->

part of that very forenoon in her house, mamma Jones had not, in
truth, communicated one word of the supposed treat in store for her,
Mr. Clarence Van Trump presented himself at quite an early hour at
the widow's door, not in the rather rickety chaise upon leathern
springs, in which the patroon made his manorial progresses, but in a
light wagon, which our young gentleman, knowing the style of equipage
in use where he was about to go in pursuance of duty, had caused
to be forwarded all the way from the city. Was it the showy elegance
of the carriage, or the high-spirited horse which had brought it
to the door with such marvellous celerity, and stood pawing the dust,
impatient to be gone again; or the subtle charm of Mr. Clarence's
moustache and pleading manner, which made the invitation now irresistible?
No; Mrs. Jones, be it said, aided by good-natured and
unsuspecting Miss Simmons, had carried the day beforehand. The
arguments that had been used were not very strong of their kind, and
were chiefly confined to truisms. They said a ride in a nice wagon
with so pleasant a companion, was not to be picked up in the streets;
that she, Mary Jones, could of course walk at any time; that Thomas
Elkhart would not, of course, be so unreasonable as to be offended,
even if she had promised to walk with him this afternoon, and much
more of the sort. After all, it has not been said that Miss Mary
Jones was perfect, but only that Elkhart believed her so. She was
very pretty and amiable, and not naturally coquettish; but who could
resist the fascinating influences concentred in Mr. Clarence Van
Trump? And what was it, Mr. Clarence, that you said in the course
of your drive, which so turned, for a time, the not over-strong little
head beside you? And what was there in the face of young Elkhart,
when you two met him taking his perforce solitary walk, which stung
you into forgetting your late resolve to patronize this native artist,
and caused you to commence that methodical flirtation which ended
somewhat otherwise than you anticipated?</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Elkhart had, in the meanwhile, indeed, enjoyed a
t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te interview with the mother of the young lady in lieu of her
absent self, and may not have been the better in temper for a rather
odd conversation, in which Mrs. J. had been chief speaker. He had
learned with surprise, and perhaps, for the first time, something

<!-- page 361 -->

approaching jealousy, that he had been unjustifiably slighted; that
Mamma Jones thought Clarence a most desirable match for her Mary,
and was disposed to believe his (Thomas') love for the same young
lady, and their tacit engagement, and all that, mere child's play,
which they would both have forgotten when he (Elkhart) had been a
year in Italy. He was going there soon, was n't he? Now that he
was of age and had come into the property, of course he could
travel and improve his mind, and perhaps would marry some foreign
lady and settle abroad, who knows?</p>

<p>Elkhart knew, if Mrs. Jones did not, there was only one woman
in the wide world who would ever be his wife. He looked at the
castle-building lady in the fine cap (donned not to do him, but Mr.
Clarence, honor) without resentment, but with a hitherto unknown
weight at heart. He quite understood the latent meaning in what
he had just heard, and the not unkind motive in which it may have
originated; there was no balm in <i>that</i>. He went home and chipped
away at a block of marble without purpose, then threw down his
tools, and walking out at random, encountered our heroine, who,
however, did not see him as they flew by, her face being addressed
elsewhere. But Mr. Clarence, whose eyes were just then engaged in
peering admiringly under the bonnet with the fluttering blue streamers,
naturally caught the rather fierce glance which proceeded from
the same direction a little beyond, and involuntarily bit his lip and
frowned. "Confound his impudence!" he growled, below his breath,
"does the fellow remember who I am, and what he is? By Jove! I
suppose he is jealous, and waylaid us to frighten this little girl, who
is a deuced deal too pretty for him to think of, by the bye; and I'm
glad his purpose miscarried, and my stare was all he got in return
for his ill-looks."</p>

<p>"Why, dear! how cross you look," cried Miss Mary, in great
astonishment, who saw no cause for the change of countenance.</p>

<p>"Cross! what, to you! Did I look so? Surely not," was what
Mr. Clarence replied, with a very different expression of face. "By
the Lord Harry!" he added, mentally, he had been looking,
while he spoke, so earnestly at his companion that she was blushing
a little, and looking prettier for it, "how charming she is! and I

<!-- page 362 -->

will flirt with her to my heart's content, if only to spite what's his
name, the potter."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was in virtue of this resolution that he was so amiable
and pleased with every thing on the widow's supper-table. What
bread, and what delicious butter! and did Miss Mary really and truly
make that cake? He had tasted nothing like it in New-York, nor in
Paris either. And this must be caravan tea; it could be no other.</p>

<p>The tea was some Mrs. J.'s brother, Captain Bluff, in the East-Indian
trade, had brought home for her; and so was the preserved
ginger. He must try some; it was the best thing in the world for
a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"O ma!" cried Miss Mary here. Indeed the old lady valued
it as a stomachic, and never brought it to table even when her best
friends supped with her; but who, let it again be asked, could resist
the blandishments of so delightful a guest? It almost brought tears
to her eyes to see how he ate out of their plated spoons as if they
had been the gold ones he was accustomed to, and which she began
to think her Mary would one day have the charge of counting. She
longed to tell him he had her consent and blessing beforehand, and
took great credit, in secret, for the adroit conversation with poor
Thomas Elkhart, which no doubt caused that young gentleman's seat
at table to be vacant, the first evening for weeks past. To do her
justice, our heroine noticed the empty place too, and with some expressions
of regret, at first, which annoyed Mr. Clarence more than
he would have chosen to confess; but as the field was his for the
evening, and he exerted himself to fascinate, perhaps Elkhart was in
the thoughts of none of them long. Mrs. J., who, for the past hour,
had been rocking herself in her state mahogany-and-mohair chair,
smiling perpetually, listening and castle-building, declared him, when
he was gone, to be the most talented young man she had ever laid
eyes on; meaning young Van Trump! What beautiful compliments
he paid! Who was that he said she was like&mdash;the Duchess who?
Sweet Mary Jones did not remember the name, but she did the substance
of the compliment, and of many others, and wished in her heart
Elkhart were as elegant in address. Thomas Elkhart seemed to
think her better than she was, she knew, but then why did n't he say
so sometimes, even if she were not to believe it all? What a pity

<!-- page 363 -->

he had not been present to see how such things were done by the
best society; he was so diffident of his own attainments, and so willing
always to learn, that she was sure he would have been able to
pick up a grace or two while looking on. Perhaps he might have
been even persuaded into wearing a moustache in future, when he
heard how it improved a bass voice. With a moustache now, and his
large eyes to help, he would look almost like a foreigner; more so
than Mr. Van Trump even, though of course not so good-looking.
But then he was so good; yes, if not handsome, he was certainly
good, very good to her, Miss Mary thought, before falling asleep.</p>

<p>If Elkhart had not had some good in him, as Mary Jones had admitted;
and more than that, if he had not been so much in love with
our pretty heroine, that even the self-respect which lies at the bottom
of all worth had no opportunity to assert its claim to consideration,
perhaps the hints thrown out by Mrs. J., in person, would have been
received for the daughter's own aspirations at second-hand, and his
chair at the widow's supper-table and accustomed place in her little
parlor, have remained thenceforward forever untenanted. But
although such was really the state of things at first, the lapse of
twenty-four hours brought a change in his views. He even began to
judge himself unreasonable, and to be contrite accordingly. Why
should she not ride with a friend on occasion? The fact of her doing
so, under the circumstances, showed a familiar confidence in his affection
which he was sorry to feel himself unworthy of. Could he have
seemed more a Bluebeard if he had been indeed her husband, and
she anything but the angel she was? What did it matter if he should
be occasionally compelled to listen, in common with sweet Mary
Jones, to this Van Trump's flippancies? they both would understand
the true value of the coin in which he dealt, and not be deluded by
its glitter, as Mrs. Jones was. He could afford to smile now when
he recalled that lady's hints and inuendoes. At least, however, he
would make amends for his late ill-humor, this true lover thought,
by leaving his angel free to fly about with whom she would, to ride
when she willed, and be as happy as the day was long. For himself,
he would look on and enjoy her happiness, which would be the best

<!-- page 364 -->

means of securing his own. And full of this fine resolve, young
Elkhart, the following evening, took his usual place at table, and by
the piano afterward, at which last Mr. Clarence did not fail to join
them a little later. The ricketty little instrument over which the
glances of these rivals occasionally met, threateningly, during subsequent
evenings, became, from the first, a battle-ground for both.
If Clarence sang and laughed, and was gay and audacious in his
flatteries, and affected to overlook our hero's presence, for the most
part, the last-named young gentleman was not likely to beat a retreat
after the first instinctive recoil before Mother Jones's fusilade, unless
by order expressed or implied of bewitching Mary Jones herself.
For such a sign, indeed, he watched incessantly, but without jealousy,
and with nothing like a scowl upon his face or perdue in the
depth of his heart. He did not think to console himself with
the trite proverb of "as good fish as she being to find," but in his
simplicity believed all perfections met in this little girl with blue
eyes, and blue ribbons to her bonnet, and set his hopes upon her
accordingly. What delightful conversations those were when Mr.
Clarence was absent, or had not yet arrived, and how much more
pleasing, because more in keeping with the place and performer, were
Miss Mary's bird-like songs, than the fine operatic performances with
which she delighted the refined and travelled ear of Mr. Van Trump.
Elkhart sometimes talked of art and of his aspirations, of books, of
nature, of whatever he loved, and thought this <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ve</i> of Madame Treubleu
loved equally. It is always so with your lovers. Does not
young Cuticle, whose talk is chiefly of the hospitals which he has
been lately walking in Paris, believe Miss Tompkins (who had
resolved to accept him long before he proposed) to be intended by
nature for a surgeon's wife, because she would actually&mdash;if you are
polite enough to take her word for it&mdash;prefer a walk of the above
kind to even one about the Palais Royal or on the Boulevards. The
fault lies a little on both sides, but in Mary Jones's case there was at
least no deception; she liked nature very well, and art, and books,
and so on, very well too, and so she did music and admiration, and
perhaps equally every thing agreeable you could name. I believe
she had the capacity to love earnestly, as afterward appeared, but in

<!-- page 365 -->

mere matters of liking, the present object was perhaps the best liked,
because more in mind. Mrs. J. would fidget a little during these
confidential talks between the young people in the dusk of the afternoon,
or when Elkhart, leaning over her Mary's shoulder to turn the
music of some favorite air, would catch the kindly glance of those
cerulean eyes, and be incited straightway to feel himself, as of old,
the accepted suitor of so much loveliness. But when that exquisite
Clarence arrived the tables were quickly turned. I verily believe he
laid out his plan of the evening campaign during the mornings, when
he had nothing better to do, and went to the extent of committing to
heart daily a page or two out of an old copy of Joe Miller, one
of the few books in the library our young dandy cared to kill time
by reading. Whence else did he pour out such a flood of slipshod
anecdote, sometimes audaciously told for his own adventures, that Miss
Columbia Simmons, who was frequently present, gnawed through I
do n't know how many handkerchiefs, in attempts to stifle her laughter,
and Mrs. Jones came to think the narrator incomparably more
talented than our hero, who, for his part, commonly sat and listened,
with more philosophy and forbearance than gratification, be it said.
However much his conclusions may have differed from Mrs. Jones's,
he kept them to himself, and took part here and there in these conversations,
on which occasions Mr. Van Trump, to show his superior
station, perhaps, rather than his better breeding, usually fell to talking
with some one else. In truth&mdash;and the truth will out at some
time in a history such as this&mdash;a great change had been undergone
since the beginning of this pastoral in the views and feelings of the
young gentleman last named. He had ceased to make fun of
"Mother Jones," as he had at first called her, for the entertainment
of the grinning old patroon, at the breakfast-table, and some how had
lost perception of the false notes in the performances upon the veteran
instrument in Mrs. J.'s parlor. He did not now forget the flowers
he took from Miss Mary's scarcely resisting fingers, and suffer them
to perish, for want of care, in the button-hole of his coat; the glass
on his bureau at home always contained one or two. He had her
album to write some verses in, and was laboring with touching
energy to collate some "original stanzas" which might put to

<!-- page 366 -->

shame the not ungraceful verses preceding them, signed T. He
drove her almost every afternoon in his love of a wagon, he attended
her to church, where she played the organ in lieu of a professional,
and where he and Elkhart sang bass on either side of the fair
musician. He considered with himself the probability of being disinherited
in a certain event, and was so much in love that he gave it
little heed. He had chanced to step in twice or thrice during those
familiar chats by the open window, between Elkhart and our heroine,
already recorded, and had been stung to jealousy in no usual degree.</p>

<p>Elkhart himself had not been without his trials of this sort; and
it was about this time, one evening, that Miss Mary's handkerchief&mdash;a
very pretty little embroidered handkerchief&mdash;having fallen to the
floor, Mr. Van Trump hastened to possess himself of it, but instead
of restoring the estray first pressed it, half-jestingly, to his moustached
lips, and finally deposited it under his vest on the left side.
He caught his rival's eye while doing so, and there was a fierce
wrath in its blaze which caused Mr. Clarence to quake a little, it
must be admitted; perhaps he discerned, by some curious instinct,
what was passing just then in the other's mind. As for Miss Jones,
she smiled, I am sure, when she turned her head aside. It is certain
she affected to see nothing of the impertinence; yet, when Van
Trump took his leave, a little later, and our hero, following suite,
overtook the latter in the street, close to the door, and there intimated,
in a tone more imperious than was his wont, or in truth, than
members of that distinguished family are accustomed to be addressed,
a purpose to speak with Clarence as they walked, Miss Mary
Jones suddenly appeared on the door-step they had just quitted, and
called out "Mr. Elkhart!" in her most persuasive manner. Then, as
he only looked back and nodded, with a somewhat sardonic smile, she
called him a second time, by his Christian name, and what lover could
resist that? Tom, as has been noticed, is not an harmonious syllable
in itself, but in Miss Mary Jones's pretty mouth it became quite
irresistible; and the owner came, as would any well-trained dog&mdash;Mr.
Clarence sauntering slowly on.</p>

<p>"Do n't ask him for it; please do n't ask him?" the young lady
supplicated; meaning, of course, the handkerchief, which she could

<!-- page 367 -->

not have seen Mr. Clarence Van Trump slip under his vest. Elkhart
saw the inconsistency, and paused in what he was about to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; thank you: I know," Miss Jones ran on; "but I will
send for it in the morning. I can send a note to ask if he took it by
mistake, or mamma can, if that will be more proper. He would
never return it to you, I am almost sure."</p>

<p>"No?" said Elkhart.</p>

<p>"No; and how cross you are! Why you can have another
handkerchief just like it to keep as long as he keeps that. Come in,
please, or promise me to remain there, and I will fetch you one."</p>

<p>"No," our hero said a second time, perhaps a little scornfully,
but with wonderful coolness, the number of emotions by which his
mind had been agitated during this short debate, being considered,
"Mr. Van Trump has nothing to fear under your protection," he
added, and held out his hand. "Good night; good bye!" poor
Thomas Elkhart ended by saying, somewhat less steadily, and walked
away from the woman he loved, with a resolution never to see her
more. "If she ever loved me, as I once thought, she certainly does
not now, and my presence encumbers her. I know I am not worthy
of her. Who is? I will at least be in Italy before the sacrifice is
complete, and may never hear that she is the unhappy wife of this
man," were the meditations which went with our hero to his pillow
that night. They had been less orderly upon his first arrival home,
two hours earlier, or those bitter tears, which had forced themselves
between the fingers of the hands in which his face was so long buried
upon the bed-side, would not have been to chronicle. Afterward he
dreamed that he was engaged upon a colossal statue of some great
personage; and when it was done, lo! there stood the exact resemblance
of Mr. Clarence Van Trump, in marble, even to his favorite
short cutaway coat and light fancy trousers. But when, in a fit of
ungovernable rage, he had seized a mighty sledge to demolish the
figure, which was, oddly enough, grinning at him, and stroking a
finely-chiselled moustache, on a sudden the likeness of sweet Mary
Jones, as he had carved her, occupied the pedestal instead; then the
hammer, checked in mid career, alighted on his own head, and he
awoke to find it broad day, and his temples throbbing as fiercely as

<!-- page 368 -->

if the blow had fallen where he had dreamed. Indeed, a fever had
set in, which not only induced numberless greater vagaries than that
of a colossal statue to Van Trump, during the succeeding ten days, but
postponed, for a much longer time, the voyage to Italy, which our
unhappy young friend had previously arranged should commence the
next day but one.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarence Van Trump woke about the same hour, but with
widely different sensations, and, to argue from his countenance, none
of an unpleasant kind. lie had leisurely pursued his homeward course
undisturbed the previous night, and had triumphantly brought off the
little perfumed handkerchief, which had so nearly proved a <i>casus
belli</i>.</p>

<p>What could there have been in the retention of that trifle which
had caused our young gentleman, on retiring to his chamber, to
regard it with such complacency, when produced and laid upon his
dressing-table? Had he feared any opposition to the laudable purpose
of elevating one of the Joneses to be a Van any thing? None,
certainly, from Mrs. Jones herself, who would have lost a finger
rather than such a son-in-law, and was, perhaps, more open in that
respect than the other ladies in the village who had marriageable
daughters, judged becoming. The old sea-captain in the India trade,
Mary's uncle, had paid them a short visit, too, and had expressed his
bluff concurrence, but not until his sister had clearly manifested that
Elkhart could never have thought of marrying her Mary; how could
he, when he certainly was not a lover, and had not paid Mary a compliment,
such as Mr. Van Trump was always doing, once in his whole
life-time, she believed? As for Miss Columbia Simmons, let it suffice
to know that she had already arranged what dress she would wear on
a certain grand occasion, as likewise during the first subsequent visit
to her friend's palatial mansion in the city.</p>

<p>The personage chiefly interested in this pleasing little drama, how
ever, did not at first give in her acquiescence. It is true, she rode
and walked with the <i>sous</i>-hero of this tale, and was not a little carried
away by his delightfully fashionable conversation. But was it not
enough to flatter Miss Jones into a passion&mdash;meaning <i>la grande passion</i>&mdash;that
the man who had waltzed with and made love to Countesses

<!-- page 369 -->

and High-Mightinesses at the German spas, to say nothing of his
home position, should run after her in the way he did? Had he not
given her flowers? then a book&mdash;a Book of Beauty, of course&mdash;then
a ring, and finally a perfumed pink paper note, an answer to which
was to be conveyed in the tacit gift of the handkerchief? There
would have been no want of opportunity to have given either a
verbal or written response, it may be remarked, in a more usual manner;
but the worth of a romantic incident with the more youthful of
your sex, ladies, was not unknown to this young Alcibiades. Beside,
he entertained other views&mdash;views which I shall take great pains to
avoid the mention of here. Indeed, they were not expressed in the
pink billet, nor even hinted at, nor were they directly referred to in
any of the pink perfumed notes which followed this forerunner. But
in each and all there was thenceforward a more open avowal of his
passionate affection, and much re&iuml;teration of the unbounded sacrifices
he would make for her, sweet Mary Jones's, sake. This, too, was the
burden of most of his conversations. To do him justice, he spoke the
truth here, so far as it went. It has been incidentally shown in the
first pages of this history, that a gratification of any sort would be
purchased by this patrician off-shoot at the cost of the whole future,
if necessary; and in the present instance he certainly would not have
scrupled to risk the paternal and avuncular favor and inheritance at
once, rather than forego his wishes.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, there might be some safer means for attaining
his end. If he were so disposed to risk every thing, should not she
make some sacrifice? It would be safer to delay their marriage until,
at least, his uncle, the patroon, should have left him his heir&mdash;in a
year, possibly, or at the end of a few months or weeks. Meanwhile,
should greater delay be required by after events, or should either
weary of the other&mdash;&mdash; But let us not record the musings, held in
private with his segar, of this delightful young rou&eacute;, whose moustache
and cane, or lorgnette, we are always secretly flattered to see promenading,
or at the opera, with our sisters and daughters. He was
crazy with love at times, kissing over and over again a likeness of
Mary he had taken from the parlor table, and he was content to be
the sacrifice in the event of <i>her</i> refusing to be. On the whole, it is

<!-- page 370 -->

not saying too much, that there are honester and more honorable men
wearing the striped uniform of Sing-Sing at the present day, than Mr.
Clarence was in heart at this juncture.</p>

<p>If the poor child had fallen into the snare, who would have been
to blame? Not you, of course, most excellent and moral Mrs. Jones;
nor would it have been the fault of her education, of course. We
Americans are intolerant of an hereditary nobility, but consent to
worship any pretender. We brag of our republicanism, and cringe
to self-assumed superiority. In what was this son of a patroon better
than the son of a potter? and in how much and how immeasurably
inferior? Observe, gentle reader, the present writer is far from
believing all men equal; but let superiority be purchased by some
thing more than lawful dollars or the counterfeit coin of assurance.</p>

<p>How could Elkhart contend alone against this social ill, or hope to
uproot it? While he stood looking on, vexed at heart and conscious
of the wrong, the love of the woman he would have given his life for
was cajoled out of his keeping. She had been flattered into believing
Elkhart's to be friendship, and Van Trump's true love; how could
both be love which were so different? The descent to Avernus is so
proverbially easy, that in the end who can say she may not have
fallen, as natures as sweet and good have fallen before? But "when
the tale of bricks is double, Moses comes."</p>

<p>Moses came now in the person of one Miss Keziah, the maiden
aunt who had kept Elkhart's house for him since his falling heir to it.
She came straight from his bedside, from hearing him raving of Mary
Jones, and believing him on the verge of death. Mrs. Jones, from
some feminine instinct not easily definable, had settled it in her own
mind, that upon this especial forenoon young Van Trump would propose;
and, taking her work with her somewhere, had left a clear field
to these two lovers. There was no one else in the house, and when
Miss Keziah, with her cap-strings undone, rushed unannounced into
the parlor, Clarence was down upon his knees, protesting, imploring,
almost crying, and poor frightened Mary Jones weeping for very
bewilderment and helplessness.</p>

<p>But Miss Keziah cared for none of these things. It is doubtful if

<!-- page 371 -->

she even saw Clarence at all; but sat upon the sofa, with her face
buried in her apron, and rocked herself to and fro.</p>

<p>"Oh! he's dying, I feel he is!" she sobbed aloud; "he that promised
to be such a great man, and would have been, I know. And
all for love of you, Mary Jones; he raves of nothing but you, day and
night. He's dying for love of you, cruel, cruel Mary Jones! and
you will have his life to answer for one of these days. Come, come
and see him before it is too late."</p>

<p>"Dying&mdash;dying for love of me!" Mary Jones cried, standing up,
pale and wild, the tears running fast down her cheeks.</p>

<p>What a frightful past was that she had just escaped! It made her
shudder. Was there time to make peace with the man she had so
injured, and now knew that she loved so with the whole depth and
strength of her nature? Like Margaret, she breathed one prayer
aloud; and was that Faust hurriedly groping for his hat, and cursing
his fate, in the entry? Then she flung her arms about the neck of
Miss Keziah, and sobbed upon her breast.</p>

<p>"Save me, save me, O Keziah!" she said, "and take me with
you. I will never leave his bedside while he lives, until he is my
husband."</p>

<p>Elkhart lived&mdash;of course he did&mdash;under such careful nursing.
Mrs. Jones plead, and half the village held up their hands, but Mary
Jones was not to be moved. She became Mrs. Elkhart in time, and
what sweeter face or better wife was there known to artists in all
Rome? We all saw and admired lately the greatest work, thus far,
of Elkhart's chisel; but what that work is I am not going to say, for
then every one would know the true and proper name of our sculptor,
and, perhaps, next Sunday in church, would be staring at still
pretty Mrs. Elkhart, and, by inference, condemning young Van
Trump, in place of attending to the Collect for the day, or crying&mdash;as
every one of us has occasion to do, not less than Mr. Clarence, per
haps&mdash;"<span class="smcap">God</span> be merciful to me a sinner!"</p>

<h3 id="c35">Traditions of the Natchez.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY T. B. THORPE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all our Indian tribes, none were more interesting or more
rudely destroyed than the Natchez. What is remembered of them
is calculated to make a deep impression upon the imagination, and to
cause regret that some historian had not preserved a truthful history
of this singular people. In the early traditions of the Mexicans, preserved
to us in their hieroglyphical paintings, there is presented the
wonderful spectacle of families and nations, from innate impulses,
moving from "the North," and, ever restless, wandering over an
unoccupied continent in search of homes. It is evident that the same
wisdom that confounded the primitive language at Babel, and scattered
the swarming millions of Asia, impelled the early occupants of our
continent to move onward like advancing waves of the sea.</p>

<p>In these strange migrations, some chief must have separated from
the parent multitude, and turned his face with his followers toward
the South-west; and finally reaching the delectable lands of all the
valley of the lower Mississippi, there established what was afterwards
known as the tribe of the Natchez.</p>

<p>The country selected is of surpassing loveliness; for, from the precipitous
bluff that so unexpectedly frowns down upon the Mississippi,
inland, to where the nation erected its great mound, is one continuous
undulation of picturesque scenery, originally enriched with groves of
live oaks and magnolias. It was really a fairy land, and enough of
the primitive forest still remains to give the sanction of truth to the
most florid description of it preserved in legendary lore.</p>

<p>There can not be a doubt, that it the time these nomadics took

<!-- page 376 -->

possession of their adopted homes, that the surrounding country was
comparatively without inhabitants; for the savage and warlike nations
which lived in the neighborhood never would have permitted the Natchez,
when in their infancy, to occupy lands, which afterward even
they defended more by moral than by physical force.</p>

<p>As fire-worshippers, the Natchez displayed their Oriental origin,
and they were more sincere in this most poetic of all idolatries than
the magi of the East. They possessed a tradition which, unlike the
traditions of any other nation, gallantly ascribed the salvation of their
race to a woman. This was, that after the destruction of all the inhabitants
of the earth, save a single family, which family was about to
die because of the continued darkness of the heavens, a young girl,
inspired with the wish to save her race, threw herself into the fire which
was used as a light; and that no sooner was her body consumed, than
she arose in the East, surrounded with such surpassing glory that her
form could not be looked upon: thus enshrined, she became the chief,
her nearest female relation being elected her successor. Hence was
established the worship of the sun, and the living sacrifice of the sacred
fire, together with the belief, that so long as it blazed upon their altars,
the Natchez would be powerful and happy.</p>

<p>The Sun, a female sovereign, was absolute in power. The rewards
of the chase, and of the cultivation of the soil, were placed under her
charge, implying, that they were the results of her genial rays, and
through her, as if direct from the hands of Providence, they were distributed
among the people.</p>

<p>The Natchez must have rapidly increased after their establishment
on the banks of the Mississippi; for their tradition was, that in the
first century of their settlement, they erected those monuments of
industry on which to erect their temples and bury their dead, the
remains of which are so much admired to this day. Their great work
was built upon a hill, where they believed fire fell from the sun, indicating
that their wanderings were at an end. This series of mounds,
the most remarkable in the valley of the Mississippi, have been almost
entirely overlooked by the curious in such relics of ancient days.</p>

<p>A natural hillock was levelled upon the top, and used as the foundations
of the mounds, the only example known. Upon a base thus

<!-- page 377 -->

prepared was raised the grand elevation for the great temple of the
Sun, and the inferior works used for defence, and the graves of the
nobles. In examining these singular ruins, now covered with trees of
a century's growth, it is not difficult to conceive them rising in their
perfection from the open plain, their summits smoking with sacrificial
fires, and covered with priests and people. It was only upon the
great mound, and at the festival of fruits, that the Sun showed herself
to the multitude. Attired in robes of white cotton, adorned with
feathers, and her breast glistening with various brilliant stones, she
assisted in the early greeting of her supposed ancestor, and as the god
of day ascended in the East, and shot his bright rays across the land
scape, they first of all fell upon the sacred priestess, and were reflected
back in ten thousand rays, which were regarded by the worshippers,
as a recognition of sympathy and acknowledged relationship.</p>

<p>According to the belief of the Natchez, the extinction of the fires
of the temple would be the signal for their destruction; thus having,
it would seem, with some other nations mentioned in history, a foreboding
of their extermination. A brief period before the French
invaded their homes, by some accident this fearful catastrophe happened,
and the nation was consequently suffering from superstitious
depression. It was therefore that they fell a comparatively easy prey
to the superior arms and discipline of the European invader.</p>

<p>In their struggle for existence, after an obstinate defence, they were
first driven from the banks of the river, but again rallying, they
gathered for their final struggle at the base of the great mound. As
soon as the tribe thought themselves sufficiently prepared, they provoked
attack, and their last great battle took place. The Sun-Chief
was killed, and the survivors, believing that the dark prophecy that
rested upon the Natchez had been fulfilled, as a crowd of flying fugitives
retreated west of the Mississippi, and after various misfortunes,
were lost, or became absorbed among the Oumas, the Tensas, and
other friendly tribes.</p>

<p>The enlightened mind, in speaking of the Natchez, explains their
destruction upon philosophical reasons. It was the weak giving way
to the strong; but their fate appealed to more sympathising and more
imaginative hearts, who have softened the story of their ruin, stripped

<!-- page 378 -->

it of its harsher features, and left it so interwoven with golden light,
that we half forget the unwelcome truth, and think hopefully of the
departed. The Southern Indians of our day, when sitting beside their
"council fires," and speaking of the times that are past, tell us:</p>

<p>That a young Natchez chief, famed for his virtue and bravery,
became enamored of a beautiful maiden, and that his passion was
returned. His interviews were stolen ones, and few and far between.
On one occasion, when the young chief was keeping his night-watch
over the sacred fire of the temple, he heard the plaintive song of a
day-bird; and flying to the neighboring groves, there met his mistress,
and exchanged the solemn vows of eternal love. Returning to the
temple, the young chief, to his horror, discovered that the flame had
expired in his, unconsciously to him long absence, and the altars,
which had ever glowed with living fire, were cold.</p>

<p>Alarm filled the young warrior's breast; despair was impressed
upon his features; and as the sun illumined the hills, and made the
homes of the Natchez glisten in its refreshing, and to them sacred
radiance, there was no response of ascending sacrifice, and the chief
priests rushed with precipitation to the temple, to learn the cause.</p>

<p>Terrible indeed were the wailings that ascended from the soul-stricken
worshippers. It was deemed that a curse had fallen upon the
nation; that its speedy extinction was shadowed forth; and amidst
the excitement, by order of the great Sun, the young maiden was sacrificed,
not only as a propitiation, but that her surpassing beauty should
no longer tempt the guardians of the sacred altars to neglect their
vigils.</p>

<p>The young chief was doomed to make expiation in fastings and
prayers; and after due ceremonies, he was imprisoned in the centre
of the great mound, there to remain until he wooed back the lost fire
from heaven. It was in vain that he essayed the comparatively easy
task of lighting the proper combustibles by rapid friction. Over
whelmed by religious fear, his strength of arm appeared to have
departed; and even when, from long and patient labor, the fire was
about to descend, a tear of regret for the memory of his mistress would
fall upon the just-igniting wood, and leave his interminable task to be
again renewed.</p>

<!-- page 379 -->

<p>Although years, yea, centuries, have passed away; although the
entrance to the great mound has crumbled undistinguishably into the
surrounding mass, and huge trees have usurped the places of the
ascents and the altars, yet the old Indians, in their day-dreams, visit
the young chief, who is still in the centre of the mound, perseveringly
engaged in his labor&mdash;and confidently assert, that when he recovers
the sacred fire, he will again appear at the altar, and that the Natchez,
in all their former glory, will take possession of their now desolated
homes.</p>

<h3 id="c37">The Sun-Dial of Isella.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY RICHARD B. KIMBALL.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> young traveller&mdash;we have no means of ascertaining his
name, or who he was, possibly the author of "Views Afoot"&mdash;had
safely crossed the last torrent, which, the bridge having been swept
away a few days previous, was even now not altogether free from
danger. He had passed the boundary of the Valais, and, in fact,
stood upon the soil of Italy. To be sure, he did not at once behold
the deep blue of the sky, nor breathe the mild atmosphere, nor witness
the exuberance of foliage and of flower, which belong under an
Italian sun. Nevertheless, the presence of the luxuriant chestnut, the
softer green of the grass, and the frequent appearance of the vine
itself, proved to our pedestrian, as he entered the little village of Isella,
that he was fast bidding adieu to the desolate majesty of the mountain,
and would soon enjoy a prospect of the loveliness of the plain.</p>

<p>There was nothing inviting about the place which the youth had
reached, save its romantic situation. At the present time it was filled
with travellers in great variety, who had been detained by the overflowing
of the "gallery" beyond, which rendered an advance impossible.
The sole house of entertainment was a miserable and dirty
inn, now literally without provisions, if we may except a quantity of
onions and some fat bacon. It could, of course, afford no accommodation
for the hourly increasing additions to the company. The only
building of decent appearance was the custom-house; for Isella, being
the frontier town and on the Simplon route, the number of travellers
was large at certain seasons, and at this spot every species of luggage
underwent a close examination. Finding he could obtain nothing

<!-- page 384 -->

whatever at the tavern, the youth, without delaying to exchange courtesies
with any of his fellow <i>voyageurs</i> whom he encountered there,
turned suddenly away, and with the promptness and alacrity of an old
soldier, entered one of the meanly-built cottages which compose the
town, and soon procured half a loaf of black bread, some very poor
cheese, and a bottle of wine, so exceeding sour that, thirsty as he
was, it was not till he had been nearly choked by the coarse crumbs
he could bring himself to swallow it. He left the hut, making a
series of wry faces, but, after all, feeling much refreshed and quite
ready for adventure. The "gallery" was still filled with water; yet
to a pedestrian, this might not prove an insurmountable obstacle; so
he resolved, after reclaiming his knapsack at the custom-house, and
with another glance at the surrounding scenery, to hasten on his way.
Who will blame our hero? What to him&mdash;young, eager, and enthusiastic&mdash;was
the crowd which pressed around the inn? What to
him was the look of interest displayed by many a fair girl, as he
passed, this way and that, unconscious? He was entering Italy for
the first time. But he did not hasten on his way; he staid more
than one good hour at this unpromising, wretched place. Notwithstanding
the sun began to decline, and kept sinking and sinking
toward the west, still he remained quietly on the same spot where he
stopped&mdash;as he thought but for a moment&mdash;just after leaving the
officers of the customs, with his knapsack in his hand.</p>

<p>It was before a sun-dial: a dial not remarkable in its appearance,
an ordinary dial, but having some letters engraved on it, which
attracted his attention, and he paused to read them. The lines made
such an impression on him that he put down his knapsack, drew out
his memorandum-book, and seated himself a few steps aside to copy
the inscription. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">Torna</span> tornando il sol, l'ombra smarritta;
Ma non pi&ugrave; r&egrave;torna l'et&agrave; fuggita."</p>

<p class="stanza">The vanished shadow returns when returns the sun;
But fugitive Life returns never again.</p>

</div>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<!-- page 385 -->

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the youth sat for a moment, engrossed with reflections
which the words suggested, two persons approached the dial, and
stopped before it. They were husband and wife, refined in appearance,
and considerably past the prime of life. They stood quite still
for two or three minutes, their eyes fixed on the inscription. The
woman was the first to speak. Turning her face full on her husband,
though still retaining his arm, she exclaimed: "Now I know why you
left the young people at Martigny to follow us in the morning; I
have not forgotten this spot; I have not forgotten that thirty years
ago this day"&mdash;and tears started to her eyes as she spoke&mdash;"you and
I were here, in this very place, reading these same lines: impulsive,
vivacious, and very happy; we were just married; these lines struck
me as full of sentiment, but it never occurred to me that they conveyed
a moral lesson, for a moral lesson just then seemed quite out
of place. So I thought, at least, when, with serious, almost solemn,
look, you said to me, 'No, it returns no more again! Let us live so
that we shall never have one regret that it does not return; let us
live so that, growing wiser and happier each day, to go back to yesterday
would only be a lessening of our joys.' But I did not forget
what you said, Walter," she added, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"You did not, Maude," replied her husband gently; "and here
we stand, before this mute monitor, to thank <span class="smcap">God</span> that we did not
pass it unheeded. Thirty years seem compressed into a day," he continued
in a less serious tone; "indeed I do not feel one hour older."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," responded the wife; "and as for you, your heart
positively seems younger than on the morning you spoke so seriously."
There was an interchange of affectionate looks, when she said to him,
"And yet, Walter, how insensibly events steal upon us! What agency
is at work, unseen, unfelt, and unperceived, till we are taken by surprise
by what is accomplished? Do you not think"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Holloa</span>, there! is there any thing worth seeing up yonder?"
echoed from a coarse voice below, so startlingly that our youth lost
the remainder of the sentence. At the same moment, from another

<!-- page 386 -->

direction, appeared a party of young fellows, evidently students; and
the <i>lovers</i> walked quietly away.</p>

<p>The young men came up in great glee. One read the inscription
aloud, two or three gesticulating vigorously to his emphasis. Vociferous
plaudits followed the performance. "Bravo!" cried one, "those
lines are worthy of the old 'Many-Sided' himself; not unlike"&mdash;&mdash;
"Our subject, gentlemen, is <i>Time</i>" broke in another with an oratorical
tone; "a very important one, when you consider how long we
may be kept here, subjected to such entertainment as is served up for
us at the <i>Inferno</i> over the way. Nevertheless it is my duty to caution
you. Beware of impatience. Do well and wait. Let it be
your consolation that time flies swiftly; for what says Horatius Flaccus?</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="center">

<p>" '<i>Eheu, fugaces, Posthume, Posthume, labuntur anni!</i>'</p>

<p class="stanza">'To-morrow will be one day after to-day,
and
One more day carries us a day farther on.'</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>That shall be the inscription on my sun-dial, when I erect one. But
I am growing tedious; I perceive it myself; I beg pardon for interrupting
some body, who was about to say something. Pray, proceed."
"Good people," harangued another of the group, mounting a large
stone for a rostrum, "permit me to arouse you to a sense of your
unhappy condition. You are neglecters of the present; while you
spend your precious moments here, Alfieri Fieralfi is cooking his
last onion. <i>Carpe diem</i>. You doubt, you gainsay, you deny absolutely,
you don't budge, one of you, after that onion. You are
thinking of Godot's soups and Stein's fricandeaus. What a mistake!
what a fatal error! Listen to me. Look not behind; the past is
monumental salt; 'a living dog is better than a dead lion;' so the present
living and breathing onion is worth more than a kitchen-full of
have-beens, whether roasted, stewed, or fried! All which Master
Schiller (catching the thought from me) indifferently well paraphrases
as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" '<span class="smcap">Friends</span>, fairer times have been,
Who can deny, than we ourselves have seen,
<!-- page 387 -->And an old race of more majestic worth?
Were History silent on the Past, in sooth,
A thousand stones would witness of the truth,
Which men disbury from the womb of earth
But yet that race, if more endowed than ours,
Is past! No joy to death can glory give;
But we, we <i>are</i>, to us the breathing hours;
They have the best who live!"</p>

</div>

<p>Immense applause succeeded the recitative, and with a general
shout of</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Huzza for the omnipotent Now!"</p>

</div>

<p>the party went frolicking on their way.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> had scarcely left before another company appeared, composed
of tourists, who had evidently made each other's acquaintance
<i>en route</i>, and their plans co&iuml;nciding, were going on together. There
was a handsome girl among them, with a stylish figure, black
hair, and dark eyes, who was particularly demonstrative in praise
of the inscription.</p>

<p>"Italian!" she exclaimed; "we are really, then, in Italy&mdash;in
Italy!"</p>

<p>"You are, Mademoiselle," said a young man, with as much admiration
in his look as he dared to manifest; "this is the frontier."</p>

<p>"Indeed! oh! how happy I am! in Italy at last! My dreams
so soon to be realized! I can scarcely contain myself with delight!
And these lines: I must have a new title in my common-place book;
here it is; your pencil a moment: <i>Sun-Dial</i>"&mdash;and the inscription
was copied. "How admirable! how appropriate! Time, the runaway.
Ah! yes! he is a runaway; and how he keeps us chasing
after him!"</p>

<p>While the fair one, in the exuberance of life and health, was
giving play to her elastic spirits, a young girl, very pale, with hollow
cheeks, attenuated form, and weak step, leaning on the arm of

<!-- page 388 -->

her father, came up and stood behind the group&mdash;a victim of consumption
doubtless, on her way to a more genial climate, and&mdash;a
grave. The eye of the invalid rested on the dial. Word by word
she seemed to take in what was written. She did not speak, but
with a gentle sigh, and a look mournful yet placid, she turned aside,
and parent and child proceeded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other young lady was running on as vivaciously as
ever.</p>

<p>"Well," she continued, "now that I have one inscription, I wish
I could find another."</p>

<p>"Allow me to furnish one," said the young man before named;
"I took it from the dial at Ununa:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" '<span class="smcap">Vulnerant</span> omnes, ultima necat';
All wound, the last slays."</p>

</div>

<p>He pronounced these words in a tone so pointed that the hand
some girl, although evidently used to compliment, blushed, and asked,
hastily, "Where is Ununa? My geography at this instant fails me."</p>

<p>"It is on the Spanish frontier," replied the other.</p>

<p>"You have been in Spain, then?" said the handsome girl, fixing
her eyes on her admirer with a glance of deeper interest than she had
hitherto manifested. "Oh! how I want to go to Spain! I must go to
Spain, before we return&mdash;the country of"&mdash;&mdash; The company were
walking on, and the rest of the conversation was lost.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> <i>can</i> it be yon party were gazing at?" said one of two
very solemn personages who now drew near, in charge of a courier.</p>

<p>"A sun-dial, Messieurs&mdash;a very famous one&mdash;erected by Charles
the Great when he conquered the Alps; to show, as you perceive,
the hour of the day, and also to indicate when the weather is cloudy."</p>

<p>"Indeed! is it possible? You will please render the lines for
us?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Messieurs; very famous lines they are&mdash;written

by the poet Alpheus. It's Italian&mdash;Italian, Messieurs." And the
courier proceeded to translate them thus:</p>

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">When</span> you see the sun, you see the shadow;

<p>"Exceedingly," echoed the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this moment the president of the &mdash;&mdash; Bank in &mdash;&mdash; street, a
little in advance of his family, to show his leading position, reached
the spot.</p>

<p>"Strange," he exclaimed, "that in these old countries they should
have introduced so few modern improvements!" Turning to his
daughter, he demanded "The English of those words?" It was given
pretty correctly, for the young lady had "attended" to the modern
languages.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the bank president, "this is absolutely untrue.
Any body knows that the sun comes round every day; and any body
ought to know, too, that in cloudy weather the shadow do n't come.
Ridiculous! Preposterous! All stuff! This machine may do well
enough here, but I hardly think it would answer for a rainy day
at the bank. Our notary would not know when to protest."</p>

<p>"But, father," said the daughter, timidly, "how do we ascertain
when we have the true time except by the sun? and how else can
we correct our time?"</p>

<p>"Child!" replied the financier, in an authoritative tone, "I am
astonished at this display of your ignorance after such an education
as you have received. How do we correct our time? By the
chronometer, to be sure!" And the president of the &mdash;&mdash; Bank in
&mdash;&mdash; street strode on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next comer was a pragmatical old gentleman, having in his
charge, as pupils, two young scions, who appeared particularly to disrelish

<!-- page 390 -->

the restraint which their senior attempted to impose, and the
instruction with which he was continually endeavoring to cram them.</p>

<p>"Ha! a sun-dial," said the old fellow; "an excellent opportunity
for investigating the subject of dials! They are of great antiquity&mdash;very
great antiquity. The first we have any account of is the dial
of Ahaz, of which we read in the Second of Kings, and on which the
shadow went ten degrees backward, as a sign to King Hezekiah; and
in this connection I deem it proper to observe that the miracle was
probably effected by means of refraction, performed on the atmosphere
by the agency of clouds or vapors rather than by an interruption
of the course of the earth or any of the heavenly bodies.
I will remark about the dial, first, as to its antiquity. Ahaz began
his reign just four hundred years before Alexander, and twelve after
the foundation of Rome. How long the dial was in use before the time
of Ahaz, we know not; without doubt a considerable period. Some
writers insist that Anaximenes, the Milesian, four hundred years be
fore <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, was the first who made a sun-dial. Others bestow this
honor on his countryman, Thales, who lived two hundred years
earlier. I will not now speak of Aristarchus, nor of Papyrius Cursor,
and others named in history as having made dials; for the moderns
have brought dialling to much greater perfection. Opportunity, however,
is wanting, else I would give you a lecture on this rigidly
mathematical science. Nevertheless, if you will lend me your
crayon, I will teach you how to construct the common dial, referring
you, at the same time, for more special scientific information, to the
works of Rivard, De Parcieux, Dom. Bedos de Celles, Joseph Blaise
Gamier, Gravesande, Emerson, Martin, and Leadbeater. Now for a
gnomonic figure. Let A, B, C represent"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tom! I say, Tom! what the deuce are you loitering there for?
We are having lots of fun up this way."</p>

<p>Whereat the two youths, in the most abrupt manner, took to
their heels, leaving pencil and paper in the hand of the astonished
preceptor, who, slowly shaking his head, but without a word of comment,
walked reluctantly forward.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<!-- page 391 -->

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> immediately after, the author of &mdash;&mdash; passed the spot.
His person was known to our youth, who watched the movements
of the man of celebrity with considerable interest. A glance was
given at the dial, the lines were rapidly transferred to his note-book,
while he muttered, half aloud, "A good motto for the heading of a
chapter. It <i>may</i> do for an article. Strange, often as I have been
here, this should have escaped me." It seemed to our young traveller,
as the author walked away, as if his heart had been taken out, and an
artificial one put in its place.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A solitary</span> and sad-looking figure paused before the dial, and
raising his eyes to heaven, said something about "a day's march
nearer home," and pursued his course.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young pedestrian fell into a reverie. "It is even so," he said
to himself; "the world is a mirror which reflects one's own thoughts,
and feelings, and hopes, and fears, and character, and disposition.
Hence the great truth: 'Seek and ye shall find.' No matter what
one seeks, a supply always follows the demand."</p>

<p>The youth was startled from his day-dream by the vigorous and
healthful voice of a man, in the prime of life, who, with a companion,
had approached the dial unobserved, and was in his turn reading the
inscription.</p>

<p>"Very neat," he exclaimed; "the Italians have a most delicate
way of expressing a sentiment; but after all, this does not compare
with our straightforward and forcible English proverb:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">" '<span class="smcap">Time</span> and tide wait for no man!' "</p>

</div>

<p>So it seems, thought the youth; for, starting hastily to his feet,
he threw his knapsack over his shoulder, and was presently hid from
sight by an abrupt bend in the road just below the village.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the month, the saddest one
    Of all the varied year;
The slant beams of the setting sun
Touched the long vapors, thick and dun,
    Like hope that brightens fear.
And far and near, with dash and moan,
The waves, like prisoners, dungeon-pent,
        Beat on the rocky bars;
When forth upon my voyage I went,
Companioned, yet alone!
        Friends made I of the stars;
For, ere the day had slowly rolled,
The mists were all bedecked with gold,
    And when dark shadows grew,
Those lustrous children of the Night
Looked with their tender eyes of light
    Serenely from the blue.
I was no sage astrologer,
Yet in their pure and brilliant lore,
Without one cloud the page to blur,
    As gently, smoothly, softly o'er
Now sparkling waves our vessel flowed,
    Could I a radiant story see
    Of that not far futurity,
That longed-for, sighed-for, dear abode,
From which, forlorn, I had departed,
    To drink awhile the healing airs,
To taste the effluence, which imparted,
    In answer to unfaltering prayers.</p>

<p class="stanza">Joy to the storm-tost mariner,
    When, dimly far, <span class="smcap">Columbus</span> spied
The blue line of San Salvador
    Lift o'er the golden tide!
Yes, hopes and wishes fell like rays
Upon me from that starry blaze;
And well I knew that I should turn
    Safely my homeward prow once more,
And once more view their glory burn,
    Silvering the billows toward the shore
Of Northern climes, to which my soul
    Still pointed with magnetic power;
    Though soft the scene and fair the hour,
And though the billows murmuring roll
Lulled every sense in deep repose,
And winds, that seemed to waft the rose,
    Came to me through the Tropic night,
    Suggesting visions of delight,
    And rapturous dreams of beauty bright,
In Southern chambers, never known
To dwellers in the Temperate zone.</p>

<p class="stanza">And so we sailed&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;while smiles
    Dimpled each billow's azure cheek,
And then we hailed those happy isles
    That Nature's fond enthusiasts seek,
Because perpetual Summer dwells
In all their flower-besprinkled dells,
And lifts his banners green above
    Their hills and woods, and hangs his wreaths
In all their bowers&mdash;where lasting love
    The incense of fruition breathes.</p>

<p class="stanza">It is, in truth, a fairy clime,
With all its beauty spared by Time.
Though Cultivation o'er the land
Hath sown its seeds with liberal hand;
Though, in the lapse of many a year
The Spirit of the Storm appear,
And hurl destruction far and near,
So rapidly is life regained

Where the swift deluge fiercest rained,
    Will all its vegetation yield,
With more luxuriance than the first
New morn the faithful soil was nursed.</p>

<p class="stanza">Long graceful lines of coast were seen,
Fringed with the deepest tints of green;
The waves ran up and kissed the shore,
    As if inspired with child-like glee,
Then, laughing at the robbery, bore
    Leaves, buds, and blossoms out to sea.
It was a heartfelt joy to hear
    Their merry voices; to behold
Gleaming upon their foreheads clear,
    Circlets of silver, wreaths of gold;
To deem them living creatures, blest
    With the soft airs and genial glow
Of this Elysium of the West,
    Unchanging ever in their flow,
Save with the changes of their queen&mdash;
    The Moon&mdash;subdued by whose sweet face,
They rolled away and left between

A glittering belt of sand and shells,
Tossed from the ocean's treasure-cells.</p>

I voyaged to lands of small renown&mdash;
Lands where no war was ever waged,
Where none but lovers were engaged;
Where old Association finds
No records of illustrious minds;
No ruined temple, broken bust,
Nor urn nor venerated dust;
But where, a Matron-Bride arrayed

<h3 id="c39">The Satanic in Literature.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY SAMUEL S. COX.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an anachronism to date the connection of "<span class="smcap">Old Knick</span>" with
literature from the establishment of the Magazine, which is thus playfully
personified by its familiar readers. Long before the brothers
Clark rescued "Old Knick" from his bad fame, and gave him credit
and character, there were intimate relations existing between the
genius of type and the genius of "Knick."</p>

<p>Our votive offering upon the shrine where so many flowers, so
much fruitage, and such grateful incense has been so often offered
before, and <i>malgr&eacute;</i> the terrors of the name, offered by such good and
genial souls, shall be an examination into this relationship between
the aforesaid genii. Before we have finished our analysis, it will be
found that "Old Knick" has had more to do with human literature
than we are apt to imagine, and that without him much of its mirth
and more of its tragedy would be wanting.</p>

<p>If we are to believe the authentic records of the past, we shall find
him, in the earliest times, inaugurating the typographical art. "He
is in league with the devil," said the learned Sorbonne at Paris, of
Dr. Faust, who had, under pretence of copying the Bible, sold the
first printed edition to the Parisians at sixty crowns a volume; while
those "slow coaches," the clerks, sold manuscript copies at five hundred!
And the astonished professors, not dreaming of <i>printing</i>, and
not considering the inconsistency of the devil becoming a pioneer colporteur,
examined the quickly-produced copies, all minutely alike, and
declared, "Surely the devil is in this marvellous matter!" And when
Faust lowered his price, and multiplied his volumes, and as his red

<!-- page 398 -->

ink was observed to be peculiarly sanguine, they thought it best to
inform the magistrate against him, as a magician, who, with his own
blood, and by Satanic help, had multiplied Bibles beyond the power
of human handicraft. And the magistrate, with the profundity of
Justice Shallow, found that he was in league with the devil, and
ordered that he be made a public bonfire. Faust saved himself by
revealing his art to the Parisian parliament. The decision of Justice
Shallow was not wholly in error. There is much beside his judgment
to confirm the tradition. At this day there is none to deny that the
devil has much to do with printed thought; if not with its form and
type, certainly with its essence and spirit.</p>

<p>This must be so necessarily. So long as the drama of life alternates
between good and evil, will the devil be a star among the
actors. Being the principle of evil, he will have more or less to do
with human nature, until that principle loses its place in the heart and
its power over the head. It is a restless principle; ever busy at the
loom of life, weaving into the tissue its sombre strands, and unrolling
to the gaze its fantastic figures, which in letters become the mirror of
human vicissitude.</p>

<p>As our imperfect nature has no exemption from its temptations,
so every department of literature bears evidence of its influence. Is
it the lyric gush? The principle of evil sparkles in the ruby wine,
and melts with the amorous eye. Is it the stately drama? It plays
the prompter, and puts on the mask. Is it the grandeur of the epic?
It gives unity to the action, of which it is the hero!</p>

<p>To analyze this element, it may be necessary&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, to define what is meant by the Satanic element;</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, to trace it to its source and display its greatest examples
in literature;</p>

<p>And <i>lastly</i>, to discuss the good taste of their appearance in so
notorious a form.</p>

<p>I. It is hardly necessary that I should give a formal introduction
to a personage so well known as the subject of my paper. Most of
my readers are acquainted with him, at least by reputation. It may
not be necessary to search books to define him. He can be found

<!-- page 399 -->

when and where you are <i>disposed</i> to look for him. Paracelsus stiffly
maintains that the air in summer is not so full of flies as it is with his
presence. The odium which hangs most heavily upon him is the
<i>odium theologicum</i>. We do not propose to take this view of him,
except so far as it may throw light upon his literary uses. A theological
view might include his abuses rather than his uses.</p>

<p>It may be more original, if not so interesting, to consider the
devil as of some use in the world. That his unprepossessing features
have often inoculated the young with wholesome fear will even yet
be stoutly maintained. Ever since the days of Luther, the catechisms
of Germany have been adorned with a frontispiece, representing him
with the appendages of horn, hoof, and forked tail; and this was one
of the modes employed for teaching youth correct theological notions.
But the march of intellect, which is said to lick all the world into
shape, has licked the devil out. His horns are no longer a dilemma
to the sinner; his claws no longer reach out after the wicked; and
his tail is no longer unfolded to harrow up the soul! Our intellectual
age has acted upon him as the crowing of the cock is said to act
upon ghosts&mdash;the visible presence vanishes before daylight. But it is
unphilosophical to affirm that he <i>is</i> not, because his visible form has
vanished. He may make his tracks in other people's shoes, and in
the multiplicity of his engagements he does not always cover them.
We may tell, from the slime he leaves behind, that a serpent went
that way, and not less certainly that the devil has been about by certain
actions in human society. His horns are hid under many a
judge's wig; his hoof is pinched by many a patent-leather boot; and
his tail concealed by costliest broadcloth. And, my fine lady, he
does not disdain to hide in your dimpled smile, to wanton with your
ringlets, glitter in your ear-drops, nestle in your muff, and shoot his
darts in your glances.</p>

<p>He has no particular profession or trade, though he can lend a
hand to all. He preaches, though he has never taken orders. He is
no lawyer, but who can sophisticate like him? He is no doctor, but
he often kills. He is no mechanic, but he glories in a glowing forge,
where implements of manifold deviltry are turned out. He is no
broker, but none of your old, sleek, plump cent-per-cents has such

<!-- page 400 -->

razors for so close a shave. He is no editor, but every one has heard
of the Satanic press. He is no tailor, but ever since he sat cross-legged
over the first suit of fig-leaves, he has had a remarkable run in
furnishing the disguises in which cant, humbug, duplicity, and villainy
appear. He is not in the mercantile line, strictly, but yet he is</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">    &mdash;&mdash;"a merchant, too,
Who sells by the shortened yard;
Who keeps his accounts in a way of his own.
When he sells two ounces, he sets <i>three</i> down,
And charges two shillings as half-a-crown,
And proves by his clerk 't is true!"</p>

</div>

<p>In fact, he attends to no body's business, only because no body's business
is every body's business. The whirr of his unseen wings, as he
goes skurrying through the air, may be heard at any time by any
one who chooses to listen! Any one who is after the devil will find
the devil after him.</p>

<p>To define this ubiquitous personage is as difficult as to "paint
chaos, to take a portrait of Proteus, or to catch the figure of the
fleeting air," which is his principality.</p>

<p>But that would be a poor transcript of human thought in which
this element of evil were omitted.</p>

<p>Whether its introduction into literature has been of any benefit
to our race, we do not now consider. Even in poetry and fiction,
familiarity with its presence is by no means to be coveted. If the
devil is truly represented, he must be shown as a fiend of tact and
talent; and then he is as certain to excite admiration as he is to
blaspheme; and if, as an amiable devil, why the <i>better</i> devil he is
made the <i>worse</i> devil he <i>is;</i> for his character then would be altogether
mistaken. If the bad passions are sought to be represented
in him, if he is portrayed as one seeking whom he may delude and
devour, there are enough of his clan in the human mould, which the
varied pen of literature has delineated, and may yet delineate.</p>

<p>The spirit of evil may as well be illustrated indirectly in the
human character as in the direct Satanic character, for the reason that
the old rogue appears more at home when abroad, more easy in a

<!-- page 401 -->

counterfeit than in his genuine shape. But whether in the one or the
other; whether in his own dim hide the devil plays his part before
the "bacon-brained" boors of the middle ages, in the "Mysteries;"
or whether, as Appolyon, he wrestles with Bunyan; or, as Astorath,
assaults Saint Anthony; or plays the mischief with Faustus in Marlowe;
or fills Dante's Inferno with his form; or sits at the dreaming
ear of our first mother with Milton, whispering his wily wickedness;
or hovers over Madrid on the mantle of Asmodeus; or wings his
way with Byron's Cain to the nethermost abysses to look upon pre-Adamite
phantoms and the chaos of death; or, with Goethe, dances
through the Walpurgis Night among the witches of the Brocken; or
blurts out crazed blasphemy with Bailey's Festus; or lures Beauty to
a noble sacrifice in Longfellow's Golden Legend; he is not more
certainly the principle of evil, and the antagonist of good, than when
he plays the hypocrite with Joseph Surface, murders noble natures
with the <i>honesty</i> of Iago, harps on his humility with Heep, or embodies
the intense badness of Jeffrey Puncheons, or lubricates the
downward way with Oily Gammon, or teases and cheats simplicity
with Becky Sharp, or dishes out to poor school-boys molasses and
brimstone with the ladle of Mrs. Squeers!</p>

<p>But my subject is large enough when limited to the analysis of
the Satanic element in literature, where Satan appears in person, and
not by proxy. The consideration of the use made of him by Dante,
Marlowe, Milton, Goethe, Byron, Southey, and Bailey, will afford
theme enough. Its discussion will imply an examination into the
original suggestions which these authors profited by in the delineation
of their several devils.</p>

<p>The Mosaic history of the evil spirit, his form in Eden, and the
consequences of his temptations are familiar. They are the germ
out of which nearly all diabolic literature has grown. Wherever
introduced, the arch-rebel tempts man to his fall by the alluring
fruits of pleasure and knowledge. Another Biblical account, nearly
contemporaneous with that of Moses, is that in which Satan is represented
as asking of <span class="smcap">God</span> the privilege to tempt Job. It represents
Satan, not as a fallen rebel, but as a tempter; the more potent
because <i>authorized</i> by <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>; or, as Bailey expresses it, as the

<!-- page 402 -->

shadow of <span class="smcap">God</span> himself. "There was a day when the sons of <span class="smcap">God</span>
came to present themselves "before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and Satan came also."
He had been walking to and fro upon the earth, and having scoffed
at Job's integrity, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Satan, "Behold, he is in thy
hand." This relation of Job has been made the scape-goat for the
bold blasphemy of Byron, the insane licentiousness of Bailey, and
the scoffing jeers of Goethe.</p>

<p>The unwritten literature of the earliest ages and rudest nations
has contained traditions as to the evil spirit. He takes various forms
and characteristics, according to the physical environment or condition
of the people. In the Indian mythology, the dominion of the Universe
was divided, and even the powers of darkness had their castes.
The Indian Trinity consisted of Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the
Preserver; and Sheva, the Destroyer. Sheva was represented as a
black figure, with a terrible countenance. He is the only devil whom
literature has united in the holy bands of matrimony. If <i>he</i> is such
a monster devil, what must his wife be? Her name was Goorga.
She was quite as black as her amiable husband, with forehead and
eyebrows dripping blood. The feminine taste is displayed by a
necklace of skulls, and ear-rings of human bodies. At her zone hang
the hands of the giants whom she had slain. Quite an eligible match
for Sheva, and not unsuitable for any devil!</p>

<p>The tropical sun of Africa daguerreotyped him in blackest shades
as a divine devil, whose worship even yet holds the swart Ethiop in
thrall. In Scandinavia the grim spectres of the misty North were
servitors of the Great Evil One, whom to propitiate was accounted
wise devotion. The power of evil was very naturally feared by the
savage, and his religious instincts led him to give hostages and pay
homage to an enemy more formidable than the lion of the jungle and
more insidious than the serpent of the fens.</p>

<p>This profane idea of the devil is not unlike that of the more
refined nations of antiquity, of which it is the prototype.</p>

<p>The Greek classics might as well be without their heroes as their
Hades. Homer led Ulysses into the realms of Pluto. Thither
Euripides, in the Alcestis, and Hercules Furens, represents his heroes
as descending. Sophocles has shown the son of Jupiter and Alcemene

<!-- page 403 -->

carrying off the three-headed dog of hell. Similar marvellous
narratives formed the subject of two of the lost plays of &AElig;schylus,
and the soul of his grand tragedy, the sublimest effort of the Grecian
tragic muse, is the man-loving and Jove-despising Prometheus, with
his will of adamant, unmoved amidst the thunders and lightnings of
<span class="smcap">Almighty</span> wrath!</p>

<p>We find the prototype of Milton's Satan in this sullen and
implacable hater of heaven. &AElig;schylus had a genius for painting with
a terrible grace. He delighted to represent those old demi-gods&mdash;those
dark powers of primitive nature, who, warring against the
divine order, had been driven into Tartarus, beneath a better-regulated
world. The emperor among Titans, even as Satan among the
fallen angels, was Prometheus, half-fiend, yet benefactor of the
creature, though invincible in his endless hatred of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>.
The Titan suffers, with what a hopeless agony! yet proud above all
pain&mdash;chained to the naked rock on the shore of the encircling
ocean, conscious that he holds the secret on which rests the <span class="smcap">Almighty's</span>
throne; and whether silent in the energy of his will, or
giving it expression to the condoling sea-nymphs and the wandering
Io; and at last, when still braving the threats of Jove, and amidst
the storms of his unappeasable vengeance, he is swallowed up in
the chaotic abyss, still defiant, still exultant!</p>

<p>Some have found in this demi-Satan a prototype of the sacrifice
of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. Prometheus suffered to give man perfection; in
this he was like our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. But he did this contrary to the will
of the <span class="smcap">Omnipotent</span>; and here the comparison fails. In one case the
throes of nature were sympathetic with the sacrifice of <span class="smcap">Deity</span>. In the
other, they were <span class="smcap">Heaven's</span> implements of torture! The resemblance
between the chained Titan and the fallen son of the morning is so
striking that Milton must have taken it as his model of Satanic intellectual
energy.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Prometheus may be found lurking in nearly
every mythology and religion.</p>

<p>Although the province of the devil was well defined and limited
in the Christian dispensation, yet even in its earlier literature we find
a sect, who, having taken Prometheus as a type, erected a throne on

<!-- page 404 -->

earth for the power of hell. The Gnostics of the second century
held the doctrine of two principles, from which proceeded all things;
one a wise and benevolent <span class="smcap">Deity</span>; and the other, a principle essentially
evil. Elxai and Saturninus propagated these doctrines in
Syria, and in the Greek language, and instituted an order whose
tenets utterly degraded the religion of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Valentine of Egypt
formed them into a system, and evoked out of it, by some fanciful
angelic marriages, a Superior Power, called Demiurgus, from whose
forming hand our globe and our race issued, and to whom men were
enslaved by their evil passions. <span class="smcap">Christ</span> came to this world to redeem
it from Demiurgus, and the contest was to rage until Demiurgus was
dethroned.</p>

<p>But another Gnostic branch held that the serpent by which our
first parents were deceived was either <span class="smcap">Christ</span> himself or Sophia, the
perfect wisdom concealed under the serpent's form; and serpents
became with them objects of Christian worship! The sophistry of
Greece was thus renewed; the distinctions between good and evil
were brushed away, and an admirable hint given to the nineteenth-century
lawyer, Bailey, of the Inner Temple, for his Festus, in which
he beatifies the Gnostic vision, and makes the <span class="smcap">Deity</span> and the devil
to be one!</p>

<p>In the dark ages the devil assimilated himself to the gross imagination
of the ignorant, and walked forth in all the material deformity
of hoof, horns, claws, and tail. The medium by which he was
exhibited was the theologic drama called the Mysteries. The pilgrims
from the Holy Land were the actors. In later times, and even
up to the Reformation, a higher form of these mysteries obtained,
and greater attention was given to their composition. In these plays
the devil was a favorite, for <i>he</i> always raised the laugh. This theologic
stage usually consisted of three platforms, and the devil had
the lowest, the angels the next, and <span class="smcap">God</span> the highest. On one side of
the lower platform was a yawning cave, from which the devil
ascended to delight and instruct the spectators. Never a king or
a baron gave to his subjects or retainers a gala where this rude representation
was omitted. Indeed, the devil became so common that
men ceased to regard him as other than a jolly good fellow; and the

<!-- page 405 -->

actor who could growl his part most <i>demoniacally</i> won the applause of
the men and the smiles of the women.</p>

<p>The relics of this age are yet to be seen in Europe. Many an
ancient minster or chapel has its images over the door-way carved in
stone, bedaubed in canvas, or illuminated in missal, representing the
laughing prince of perdition. I remember one in Fribourg, Switzerland,
where the devil appears with the head of a hog, and a basketful
of sinners at his back. He weighs them in the scales, and while
good angels in vain strive to make the beam kick in favor of heaven,
the satellites of sin strive on the <i>other</i> side, and that successfully.
When weighed, they are shovelled into a seething caldron, where
grinning imps stir them into a hotch-potch of slab hell-broth, with an
industry worthy of a better cause, and an indelicacy which would
shock a Parisian <i>cuisine</i>.</p>

<p>The coarseness of the dark ages disappeared, and with it this
ribald devil. But in cultivated minds there still lingered a terrible
form of evil. It was a reality even as late as Luther&mdash;a reality at
which the burly reformer hurled his ink-stand in the Wartburg. In
the fourteenth century, hell and purgatory were realities, ever present
to the eye of the Christian. The vices and follies of men had run
riot with a prodigality which called for a retribution; and the stern
justice of Dante's intellect created an Inferno, where, with dreadful
distinctness, grim and gibbering fiends should add terror to the torments
of the damned. At this time learning was just opening its
way out of the cloister to the sun-shine; statuary began its mission
by carving a Madonna or a crucifix; painting colored a missal, as
initiatory to the frescoes which now glorify the domes of the Italian
basilicas; eloquence, waiting its Luther and Erasmus, spake in panegyric
of some favorite saint; and history toyed at legends preparatory
to her more serious duties: then arose Dante, and with the
same power with which he dared to scale a heaven of bliss, descended
to the abodes of despair.</p>

<p>Yet even his retributive morality, elevated for his age, partakes
somewhat of its coarseness. In his description of Satan he seems to
have been stricken dumb by the dread apparition, so that his pen
trembles in view of its awful office. The few etchings of Satan

<!-- page 406 -->

which he gives, might have been then considered as sublime at the
Florentine court, and would be now, had not Milton far outstretched
him in the grandeur and boldness of the vision, and had not some of
the features been so grotesque as to be laughable. The first observes
Satan standing mid-breast in the icy lake of hell, his black banners
before him, and a cloud of night around him. Dante is in stature
more like a giant than the giants are his arms!</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">If</span> he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his <span class="smcap">Maker</span>&mdash;well from him
May all our misery flow&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p>He has three faces; one of vermilion, representing anger; one
between wan and yellow, representing envy; the third black, representing
gloom. Vast wings shoot forth under his shoulders, made,
like those of bats, without plumes, yet larger than any sails upon the
sea! He flaps them, and three cold winds come forth, freezing
Cocytus to its depth. His six eyes weep tears of bloody foam. At
every mouth he champs a sinner, bruising them as with ponderous
engine. One of these victims, honored as a special mouthful, is
Judas Iscariot, the skin of whose back is stripped up occasionally, by
way of variety. No dead Judas either, but extremely vital, for we
are told that while his head is in the Satanic jaw he plies his feet
without! The last view which Dante has, places his lordship upside
down to his vision, which position certainly takes nothing from the
terrible grotesqueness of the scene!</p>

<p>But as without the rude Mysteries we would have had no Dante,
so without Dante we should have had no Miltonic Satan. The seed
of one age becomes the blossom and fruit of another; for the black
art of the middle ages gave Goethe the seminal idea of his great
drama.</p>

<p>The revival of learning found Europe full of legends of devilish
tricks with witches, wizards, warlocks, conjurers, magicians, astrologers,
and others of that ilk. How men and women walked invisibly,
rode in the air on broomsticks, gibbered a universal language, raised
winds, disturbed the dead, and tormented the living&mdash;are they not

<!-- page 407 -->

written in the black-letter folios of the Magi, seldom to "be conned
seriously in this matter-of-fact age? It may now be thought very
undignified in Satan to condescend to such hocus-pocus whimsies as the
evil eye, magic circles, tipping tables, cabalistic words, changing a
truss of hay into a horse, producing the phantom of a deer-hunt in a
banqueting hall, saying the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Prayer backward, and the like.
That credulous age has gone by, and we, vaunting our <i>science</i>, sneer
at it; yes, <i>we</i>, in this age of table-tapping spiritualism! Our learned
judges who ridicule Lord Hale for his faith in witchcraft; our <i>savans</i>
who smile at the idea of the protective horse-shoe, who can not see
the peculiar virtue in hanging a witch with a green withe, instead of
a rope, swallow whole tomes of gibberish revelations from silly and
lieing spirits, rapping out their ridiculous fanfaronade on varnished
mahogany! There was something horribly definite in the shapes
which peopled the medieval imagination. After beating around literature
for dim intimations of spiritual devils, it is refreshing to come
upon the devil in fact and in form. Those two great eyes stare at
you; the flame which breathes from mouth and nostril glares upon
you. There is the snaky hair and hardened horn, the dim hide and
shaggy back, the divided hoof and double vibrating tongue, the brim
stone smell and candles burning blue, as they wink and flicker. The
air grows hot, the heart beats as it burns, and the hair of the flesh
stands up, while in icy rills sensation chills to the bone! Oh! there
was in this a sturdy belief, unruffled by science, quite ravishing to
transcendental souls. There was then a happy propensity, especially
among the ignorant, to resolve every thing strange and wonderful
into devilism. A solution so convenient will commend itself to our
rapping circles, as well for its simplicity as for its agreement with
the maxim, that where the marvel is unaccountable, the devil is in it.
Beside, if not true, it is as good a solution as any yet submitted.
This is the way the ignorant people of the fifteenth century resolved
all the wonders of magic and the results of alchemy. The wooden
pigeon of Architus, the brazen serpent of B&oelig;tius, which hissed, the
golden birds of Leo, which sang, and the brazen head of Friar Bacon,
which spoke, were evidences of Satanic connection. The scholars and
chemists of that time did not feel indignant, either, at the alliance;

<!-- page 408 -->

for many of them, bedevilled by the madness which vanity, seclusion,
and the fumes of an indigestible learning created, gave out in speeches
that, in their transmutation of metals, and in their search after the
elixir and the philosopher's stone, the assistance of his nether majesty
had been politely tendered.</p>

<p>It was out of this credulity that Dr. Faustus, the sorcerer, became
so intimate with the devil. Marlowe, one of Shakspeare's contemporaries,
first fixed this legend in the drama. But his Faust was a vulgar
sorcerer, tempted by a poor devil to sell his soul for the ordinary
price of sensual pleasure and earthly glory; and who, when the forfeit
comes to be exacted, shrinks with very unheroic whining.</p>

<p>Many German writers have attempted the same legend: they
failed. It was reserved for the great leader of the German choir, to
inspire, with perpetual life, this thrilling tradition. Goethe seized
upon it, not to gratify the curious, but to establish a truce between
the ideal of his soul and the actual of his life, which elements had
long warred in his bosom with no determinate purpose or goodly
end! He travels with his devil along the dusty pathways of life,
penetrates into its purlieus of vice, even becomes licentious, blasphemous,
and vulgar in holding the mirror up to its changeful scenes,
revels in the wine-cups of the Rhine, and runs the whole round of
human pleasure and knowledge; but at last, guided by the gentle
spirit of Margaret, whose excellence, innocence, Christian faith, and
sensitive purity could not bear even the disguised presence of evil,
seeks in her an ideal so ethereally pure and consolingly serene, even
amid the prisons and tortures of earth, that the seraphs of <span class="smcap">God</span> welcome
her with transporting minstrelsy on the golden lyres, as if she
were the very essence of GODhood and grace! This ideal is the object
of the devil's hate. Faust would woo her to himself; but <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>  at
last divides them; for Faust hath sold himself to the devil, and the
sweet presence of Margaret could never dwell, save in unrest, near
the dark companion of her love.</p>

<p>The story of Faust is every one's own experience. We burn for
more pleasure, knowledge, and power. The fiend promises them if
we will sell to him our souls, and then the strife begins.</p>

<p>Solomon has been called the Faust of Scripture. He found the

<!-- page 409 -->

vanity of pleasure, knowledge, and power, when he had become their
bondman. "A genuine and generous attachment might have placed
happiness by means of the affections once more within reach of the
oriental monarch. But the presence of three hundred wives and
seven hundred concubines deprived him of even that contingency."
Mephistopheles, the caustic and cynical voluptuary, could have wished
for no better subject. "If an overgrown library can produce a surfeit
of knowledge, an overstocked seraglio will more certainly bring
an atrophy of the affections. When reason, feeling, and conscience
are ill at ease, to fall back upon sensual indulgence for a remedy is to
take a roll in the gutter by way of a medicated mud-bath!"</p>

<p>To this recreation the sated scholar, Faust, is invited by Mephistopheles,
and in the course of their companionship, the character of
Mephistopheles, as "the best and only genuine devil of modern
times," is revealed. It is this character we now propose to discuss.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles is not the devil of horn and hoof; for he expressly
repudiates the use of such signs of his calling. He says of these
appendages, that they would prejudice him in society; shrewdly
implying that he could get into many a man's graces in a fashionable
doublet who would cut his acquaintance if he swished a tail! Carlyle
has said, "Goethe's devil is a cultivated personage, acquainted with
modern sciences; he sneers at witchcraft and the black art while
employing them." He has the manners of your modern gentleman;
can swagger and debate, drink and poetize, swear and pray, smoke
and philosophize. He is a diplomatist, and can lie with "distinguished
consideration." He is a politician, and can talk and trim in
a bar-room with as easy a tact as in the study of the scholar. He is
a sneering, scoffing devil, sharp at sarcasm, quick to the ridiculous,
appreciative of the rascally, loves a lie as an Englishman does beef,
or a Spaniard a bull-fight; and has altogether the coolest inventive
malignity, mingled with the most infernal meanness ever embodied in
literature. He is perfectly at home in a pew, can say most gracefully
his grace, and dusts his knees after devotion with great demureness.
He believes in himself, and is true to no one else but himself, which
makes him consistently false to all.</p>

<p>His first appearance when he asks the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, with great self-complacency,

<!-- page 410 -->

leave to guide Faust in his own way, and offers to bet with
the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> that he will win, is about as frigid a piece of blasphemous
mockery as can be found. Obtaining and expressing great
thankfulness for the privilege, he goes off from the presence of the
<span class="smcap">Almighty</span> and his angels with the remark, "I like to see the ancient
one" (or old gentleman) "occasionally. It's quite civil in so great a
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> to talk with the devil himself." It is this ultimate, impudent
depravity, "logical life with moral death," which makes him so fascinating
to the skeptics of Germany. Yet, if need be, he can hide this
repulsiveness. You may keep him company for weeks and never
have a hint of hell or a sniff of brimstone. He may be with you
without your knowledge, seeing without being seen, hearing without
being heard, coming in without leave, and leaving without noise; can
be shut neither in nor out; is seen when he is not known, and is
known when he is not seen: so that he is the more potent in his allurements
and dangerous in his designs, because he is so complete in his
duplicity. As Spenser was called the poet's poet, so may Mephistopheles
be called the devil's devil. He assumes the form of a poodle
or a gentleman at will; goes off in thin air, or takes substantial form;
sings songs with the jovial; talks like an institution with a "we;"
argues philosophy with the pedantic, and plays the Satanic all the
time.</p>

<p>One of his many sides is the comical. He has his fun, but it is a
diabolical fun. In the wine-cellar, at Leipzig, is a drinking party,
loud in carousal and deep in their cups. The devil would show Faust
with what little wit and much content life may fly away; and in the
guise of travellers they join the party. He sings a song, furnishes
liquor by boring a hole in the edge of the table, draws from it wine,
some of which, spilt by an awkward reveller, turns to flame. Then,
indeed, is dismay; then ensues a fight, in which, of course, the devil
gets the best; after which he transports, by his necromancy, the
carousing company into a paradise of beauty, where, amid flowers
and fruit they revel, plucking luscious grapes with avidity, which, as
the illusion is dispelled, they find, for grapes, each other's noses.</p>

<p>It is said that the devil has a hand in all the fun and frolic of life.
There is some reason for the assertion. The confession may not be

<!-- page 411 -->

creditable; but an analysis of the most comical characters of Shakespeare
or Dickens will reveal a large alloy of deviltry. Mischief is
first cousin to Momus. "Old Knick" always has fun at his "table."
There is an infirmity in our nature which likes this flavor of sin in the
wine of life; it may be because it prefers the joking to the earnest
devil. Many never think of him without a chuckle, or talk of him
without a joke. The majority will enjoy the Devil's Drive of Byron
better than his Lucifer, and the Devil's Thoughts with Coleridge much
better than Satan's speeches to his fallen comrades. Coleridge has
happily seen the laughing side, and catches this view of him when he
sings,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">From</span> his brimstone bed at break of day
    A-walking the devil is gone,
To visit his snug little farm, the earth,
    And see how his stock goes on.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Over the hill and over the dale,
    And he went over the plain,
And backward and forward he switched his long tail,
    As a gentleman switches his cane.</p>

<p class="stanza">"He saw a lawyer killing a viper
    On a dung-hill hard by his own stable;
And the devil smiled, for it put him in mind
    Of <span class="smcap">Cain</span> and his brother <span class="smcap">Abel</span>.</p>

<p class="stanza">"He saw an apothecary on a white horse
    Ride by on his vocations,
And the devil thought of his old friend,
    <span class="smcap">Death</span> in the Revelations.</p>

<p class="stanza">"He saw a cottage with a double coach-house,
    A cottage of gentility,
And the devil did grin, for his darling sin
    Is pride which apes humility.</p>

<p class="stanza">"He peeped into a rich bookseller's shop,
    Quoth he, 'We are both of one college;
For I sate myself, like a cormorant, once
    Hard by the tree of knowledge.' "</p>

</div>

<!-- page 412 -->

<p>Byron took up this strain, and tried to handle it similarly, but he had
less humor than spleen. His devil drove with him into London,
visited the booksellers, the Lords and Commons, and found so much
geniality, that he went back delighted to his meal of homicides done
in <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, and a rebel or two in an Irish stew, and sausages made of
a self-slain Jew.</p>

<p>But no author has combined, in this jolly devil, such a variety of
diabolic attributes as Goethe. It was necessary that life be exhibited
in all its phases, and to omit laughter would have been a sad deprivation.
Having bound Faust in a contract signed with his own blood, he
runs with him the round of transient joy, takes him through the racking
experiences of love, hampers his mind with denial, harrows it with
doubt, proves to him the emptiness of pleasure, and drives him to
despair, and would drive us also, but for the heavenly vision of Margaret,
whose life, like the prayers of Dante's Beatrice, buoy the soul
upward to the SOURCE of Love and Light! whose life leaps from the
dark drama like a silver cascade from a gloomy Alpine gorge, white
in purity, spanned by the iris of Hope, and singing like a seraph of
Joy.</p>

<p>The Satan of Milton is so familiar that it needs no analysis in
order to compare him with this sneering skeptic of Goethe. The
former is epical, the latter dramatic. The former is a higher reach
of genius. It is transcendental. The Satan of Milton, like the witches
of Macbeth or the Tempest, is supernatural. The scenery and conduct
belongs not to our sphere, the earth. Mephistopheles is entirely
at home among <i>men</i>. The Satan of Milton is vast, vague, uncertain.
"floating many a rood;" a conception, not a form of matter; a shadowy
phantom towering sublime like Teneriffe, with features scarred
with the thunder of <span class="smcap">God's</span> vengeance. Mephistopheles is a worldling,
a changeling, a schemer, with no very determinate means, but takes
any to a bad end.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"So monarchs, when their politics grow stale,
Change measures, and by <i>novelty</i> prevail."</p>

</div>

<p>The Satan of Milton in intellectual massiveness is only equalled by
his moral obliquity. He embodies <i>a will</i> more than Promethean.

<!-- page 413 -->

Mephistopheles seems to say, "I would," or "I may;" Satan, "<span class="smcap">I
will</span>!"</p>

<p>Napoleon coped with destiny, and read in the stars his horoscope;
and he moved on to its fulfillment as the cannon-ball which he sped,
regardless of the ruin it made. Talleyrand played with men and
associated with women, and, like the Vicar of Bray, by a mobility in
duplicity, retained his place under every form of government. Bonaparte
was more like Satan; Talleyrand, Mephistopheles. Mephistopheles
copes with man, and laughs over his success in human weakness;
Satan copes with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and energizes, by his nervous oratory,
the myriads of hell to rise against the <span class="smcap">Omnipresent</span> in arms. The
one shirks and dodges through life; the other rises above life, defies
Death and conquers Despair.</p>

<p>In Mephistopheles we have a dove in gentleness, if need be; a serpent
in cunning at all times; but he never rises to that lofty daring
in which the heroic element consists. "But Satan's might intellectual
is victorious over all extremities of pain; amid agonies unutterable,
he delineates, resolves, and even exults. Against the sword of Michael,
the thunder of <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, the naming lake, and the marl burning
with solid fire; against the prospect of an eternity of unintermittent
misery, his spirit bears up unbroken, resting on its own innate energies,
requiring no support from any thing external, nor even from
hope itself!"</p>

<p>Satan and Mephistopheles are neither old wives' devils, such as
those of Tasso and Klopstock; they are not vast, well-defined machines,
munching Iscariots, like Dante's Satan; not allegorico-mystico-sophistico-metaphysical
devils, like Bailey's Lucifer, hungering
and thirsting after unrighteousness, and striving to reconcile good
with evil, and to educe purity out of pollution.</p>

<p>There is a fascination both in Satan and in Mephistopheles, which
belongs not to the heroes of Byron and Bailey. Byron reflects in his
Lucifer his own morbid doublings, and reviles <span class="smcap">God</span> with a bitterness
of spirit which deserves the reprobation of the good. Bailey, in his
Festus, loses all regard for the properties of the diabolic. His devil
falls in love in one place; in another, scolds the damned like a fish-woman,
reproves his under-fiends for laziness, telling them that they

<!-- page 414 -->

do not earn enough to pay for the caloric that burns them; mingles
love and lust; loses sight of the distinctions between the moral and
the intellectual, and ends his medley with the triumph of sensibility
over reason and the endevilment of <span class="smcap">God Almighty</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose proclamation were made for a great congress in Pandemonium.
The infernal palace of Dis is lighted with the lurid flames;
the hissing of the serpents, the wail of the lost, and the surging of the
liquid lake ceases for the occasion. Suddenly the smoke of the pit
clears away, the seats of the Satanic senators are revealed, and the
roll is called. Sheva, the black destroyer of Ind, answers for himself
and queen; Prometheus, the Titanic heaven-hater, and Demiurgus,
the gnostic world-king of evil, are there! The arch-fiend of the
Mysteries exalts his horn, and stamps with his iron hoof! The three-faced
Emperor of Dante, with his mouthful of sinners, sends a tempest
from his mighty wings to announce his presence! The leering
Mephistopheles swaggers to his seat with a devil-may-care air! And
Lucifer, Moloch, and Belial, and Beelzebub, and all the devils of
romance, tradition, and history, fill the hall. But the great leader
appears not yet! Suspense reigns in the abyss! Far off his coming
shines! And Satan, the self-elected king of all, strides proudly to the
highest seat! Then go up the shouts which shake hell's concave!</p>

<p>No caucus for speaker is needed now. No wrangle for the premiership;
for no voice is heard till the ruined archangel has first spoken
and commanded. He overtops them all, even as Jove the gods
of Olympus, "in mien and gesture proudly eminent!"</p>

<p>Other languages have had worse specimens of depravity in their
literature than ours. France, in her licentiousness, Germany, in her
skepticism, Italy, in her abandonment, have more of the elements of
positive evil; but it was reserved for the English muse to produce
this unrivalled genius of evil; and while we deplore that industry
intellect, and will are associated with so much badness, yet, thanks
to John Milton, the freeman of English intellect, at once heroic and
holy, he has created an impassable gulf between evil and good, and
testing human action by these most radical distinctions, sings a "Paradise
Regained" from the thraldom of Satan!</p>

<p>Thus much for our analysis of the Satanic element of literature.

<!-- page 415 -->

There is much only hinted, more unsaid. My limits allow no excursions
into the fields of theology. Nor have I introspected the human
heart, to find its legions of devils, who harbor along its sinuous avenues,
and revel in its chambers of imagery. We may feel bold at
the idea that the material devil has disappeared; may draw a relieving
sigh that all these creations we have considered are but the figments
of the imagination; but this one fact remains as palpable as
granite, that there is a devil, all the more real because viewless, all
the more subtle because concealed, all the more dangerous because he
hides in our hearts, befools our senses, and makes his hell in our own
unhappiness. His is a spiritual existence, and therefore a more terrible
reality!</p>

<p>Is, then, the "Paradise Regained" but a song? And shall the
fact ever be a Paradise Lost&mdash;<i>lost</i>&mdash;<i>lost for ever!</i> Shall those mysterious
relations of the soul to evil, emblemed in these creations of
literature, continue? Shall the soul for ever "lacerate itself with
sin and misery, like a captive bird against the iron limits which
necessity has drawn around it?" We answer fearfully, <i>Yes;</i> yet
hopefully, <i>No!</i></p>

<p>Fearfully, <i>Yes;</i> for while the human intellect is prostituted
through print, there is the most enduring of wrongs, the most irrevocable
of evils. It is the angel of light, fallen, and eclipsed of
his glory, and dragging other angels with him. Wit, fancy, talent,
humor, judgment, and genius join in some gifted mind with the cunning
craft of deviltry, and an influence like that of a leprous spot
enters and defiles the soul for ever.</p>

<p>Hopefully, <i>No;</i> for as the age grows brighter and warmer, a
kindlier philosophy bedews the lip of song, and a holier spirit enkindles
the fire of enthusiasm. The works of those who refuse consecration
at the font of purity, who would wanton with licentiousness
and error, will be thrown aside among the rubbish of dullness and
duncery. The splendors of genius will not save them from the
eclipses of neglect. This idolatry of the Satanic will pass away, and
the prince of the power of the air will in vain seek for his old alliance
with the genius of print, so long as virtue is regarded as better

<!-- page 416 -->

than ability, and godliness than gain. Shall the evil one for ever
haunt humanity? Hopefully, no! no! no!</p>

<p>I have an Italian painting which is emblematic of this contest between
evil and good on the earth. It is a night scene on the shores
of Sicily. The artist stands amidst the broken columns and disjointed
arches of a villa, beautiful in its ruin, even as man in his fall.
He overlooks the blue sea. There is an unwonted blending of light
and shadow on earth, wave and sky. Light and shadow? Rather
<i>lights</i> and shadow; for two lights reveal a scene of loveliness and
terror. Yon red and lurid light bursts from the top of &AElig;tna in
eruption. Yon white and tranquil light gleams from the moon,
through rolling clouds of smoke&mdash;gleams in broken silver on the
wave, on the ruin, against the lining of the cloud, and mingling with
the lurid blaze, bepaints the mountain sides, the half-hid villages by
the shore, and interpenetrates the moving masses of smoke, which
the sea-breeze bears away from the peak to the inland. The chaste
light of heaven thus blends with the impure fires of earth, as the
good struggles with the evil.</p>

<p>Lo! ships skim the sea, full-rigged and swift; for interchange
goes on amidst the elemental strife. In the light which fills the rents
of the ruin, in the foreground, sits a rustic maiden in picturesque
white boddice and scarlet kirtle, blushing at the tale of love whispered
by the shepherd at her side; for love survives, though polluted
Pompeiis perish! The fire-mount rises from the sea, whose waves.
moonlit and musical, spring to kiss its throbbing feet and cool its
raging fire; for joy is not wholly hushed by the earthquake which
"smacks its rumbling lips," eager to devour. The lights reveal,
amidst the villages and through the smoke, many a spire of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
church, pointing with silent emphasis upward.</p>

<p>But a pall overhangs the picture; yet through it the allegory
shines. The shadow of evil beclouds human destiny, yet through it
we see commerce knitting man to man by the amenities of intercourse;
love blending heart to heart by her solaces of sweetness;
joy making music on the sands of time; and religion pointing out
the path of aspiration to a better home, where throes of earth and

<!-- page 417 -->

the temptations of Satan come nevermore! Through it shines the
queen of heaven, serene as faith, and beautiful as hope.</p>

<p>&AElig;tna's fires grow dim before the rising day, but that queen of
heaven, untainted by its impurity, sails away to smile on other lands.
The morning shows but the ashes of the wasted energies of the
night of boding. Wasted? Oh! no; for even its ashes may fructify
the earth; and it is well said, that in the ploughing of the earthquake,
even as in the ploughing of grief, wrought by temptations, is
the agriculture of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Without it no rich immortal vintage can be
gathered. And trials and temptations of the evil spirit, and the
literature which enshrines it, may last, like &AElig;tna's fire, for a night;
but hopefully the heart yearns for the joy which cometh in the
morning!</p>

<p>IN THE HEBRAIC MANNER.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1776 of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> advent, the people rebelled
against England, and against all her lords and counsellors, and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> prospered it, and caused it to be successful, seeing that it would
be for the benefit of the people on each side of the great waters,
even of the Atlantic sea, which divides the Old from the New World;
and for the advancement of the cause of truth; and for the good of
mankind. In this great war, George led the armies of the thirteen
tribes, and the war lasted seven years.</p>

<p>2. And the people, when they had accomplished the rebellion,
and made it sure, formed a league and set up a government, saying,
We will be united henceforth for ever, and will help each other in
peace and war. And after twelve years of the league had passed,
they made a firmer and a broader league, and wrote a new frame of
government, and set up a great commonwealth. And when they had
finished it, and put their names to it, they chose George to rule over
them in peace, for he had led them wisely and prudently in war.
And he ruled over them eight years; doing, at all times, that which
was well-pleasing, just, and right. And he sought peace of days in
his own house, where he died, saying, Stand fast in these things, and
let them not slip, and remember the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> who hath helped us. And
all the people mourned with sincere mourning; and they respected
his memory, as they had respected him, while living, and while leading

<!-- page 422 -->

their armies in battle, and in governing their councils in peace.
Thirteen tribes were there when George began the government, and
Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee were added in his days.</p>

<p>3. And they raised a monument of hewn stones to his memory,
because he had been a just and wise man, and a leader of his people
in troublesome times. And the people of all the tribes, who had
greatly multiplied in the land, contributed stones to this monument;
and they engraved on the stones, "<span class="smcap">George</span>, first in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen." So was he gathered to his
fathers.</p>

<p>4. Now when George had finished his reign, and laid down the
sword of power, the people called John to be their leader. He was
a bold man, who had raised his voice for the rebellion, and stood by
it, and he had spoken good and firm words of truth therein, to
encourage the people, and to lead them to go forward. Neither did
threats appal him, or cause his heart to flag, and he stood close by
George, and was one of his chief elders and counsellors. Nevertheless
he had some misgivings of the wild murmurings of the people
of the Old World, which he heard, as a gathering tempest, across the
great waters. And he sought to sustain and strengthen himself, in
holding up firmly the sceptre of the government. Yet did he nothing
that it forbid, being a patriot all his days. But the people took
umbrage at his acts, after he had ruled four years. And he passed
the days of his declining years in peace and serenity, amid the
vineyards of his fathers, respected by all, and beholding, with a calm
brow, the spreading and growth of the league of the people.</p>

<p>5. Then called the people Thomas, who had been the chief scribe
of John, to rule over them, and he ruled eight years; and it became
a saying from that time that eight years was the term of approbation
of a faithful ruler. His rule was pleasing to those who had caused
the rebellion, and to all the tribes and nations of people, who desired
that no heavier burthens should be laid on one man's shoulders than
another. For he had written sound and true words on this subject,
and the thirteen tribes had made a notable declaration of them to the
world.</p>

<p>6. Thomas trusted in the principles of the frame of government,

<!-- page 423 -->

and in the people to maintain it. Yet not by wars, for he was a man
of peace, and sought to multiply knowledge. In his days the nations
of the old world rose up against their rulers, and overturned thrones
not a few; raging with the violence of a storm. He mingled not in
these wars, as George had counselled, and kept his ships from the
seas, though many of his people wished to lade them with bread, and
carry it into the gates of foreign cities. In his reign was Louisiana
purchased, and Ohio added to our circle of States.</p>

<p>7. When Thomas had finished his course, and the eight years
were ended, the people called James the civilian; and he found a
time of trouble. In his days the Lion of England spoke proud,
swelling words, haling men by the hair of the head from the ships
that carried bread over the ocean. James and his scribes and elders
then stamped on the ground, and he ordered the sword of George to
be drawn from its scabbard.</p>

<p>8. Then war raged for the space of two years and six months; for
the Lion again asserted his right to the land and to the government
which had been wrested away by rebellion; and he sent ships and
armies to burn our cities with fire, and lay waste the land. For he
had not forgotten the great and terrible rebellion; and he roared out
loud and unjust words in council; and by them placed, as it were,
chains of iron in the seas.</p>

<p>9. He also spoke to the sons of Shem, who stood with bows and
spears in their hands, in the forests, and they fell with fury on the
borders, and wrenched off the bloody scalps of men and women,
raising horrible cries to please the Lion.</p>

<p>10. These were the days of trial, and of searchings, and of blood;
army fighting against army, and navy against navy. And it fell out
that a man named Isaac, in a stout ship, mastered one of the Lion's
ships, and shot cannon-balls through her sides, and sunk her; and
other ship-masters of the commonwealth did the same, and the mistress
of the ocean was shaken.</p>

<p>11. In these days also rose another great ruler among the nations
on the other side of the water, called Napoleon, who executed the
wrath of <span class="smcap">God</span> upon unjust kings and potentates, whom he seized by the
neck and stamped on, and overthrew their governments, and entered

<!-- page 424 -->

their cities with banners, and exercised authority exceedingly between
seas and seas. He reigned about twelve years, more or less, till he
had accomplished his end, when <span class="smcap">God</span> began to loosen his hold on the
nations, by covering him and his large armies in snows; and he afterward
shut him up on an island in the sea, and then loosed him a
little to fight the Lion and the down-trodden kings; when he again
shut him up on another island, in another far-off sea, where he died.
Now, this man had also spoken proud words against James the
civilian, and against Thomas, his predecessor, at Berlin and at Milan;
and he cast proud glances across the water at Thomas and at James
the civilian, and their government, albeit he sold to Thomas, for a
possession, Louisiana, and took the value thereof in silver, weighed
in the scales.</p>

<p>12. So died the great disturber of nations, who had been a rod in
the hands of the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span>, and a leveller and a preparer of ways for
the chariot of events, albeit the nations acknowledged it not. And
after his fall there prevailed peace in the world&mdash;a great and notable
peace&mdash;as it is at this day. And the Lion of England made peace
with James the civilian, and left him his borders to the utmost, and
all his forests, which were filled with the sons of Shem; nor would
James admit these into the writing of a treaty which he made at
Ghent, though strongly urged by the Lion; for James said, With a
cruel and bloody hand have they wielded the arrow, and the club, and
knife against me, and have unjustly sided with the Lion; and to me
only shall they bow, and with me make the peace. And my name
and the name of my land is the Eagle, and with my strong wings
will I cover the land, and all the seas and mountains thereof; and
with my claws and my beak will I defend it against the Lion. and
against the sons of Shem, and against all nations.</p>

<p>13. Eight years had James the civilian ruled, and his days were
called the days of vindication, for he had conquered the country
anew, and established its liberties; and his ships and armies had
gained credit, which gave him a name over the nation. And Louisiana
assumed its manhood and became a State, and Indiana did like
wise, and the Union grew.</p>

<p>14. Then the people assembled together again and chose James

<!-- page 425 -->

the soldier to govern them. And his reign was the reign of peace.
In it the nation began to grow and to extend its borders into the
lands of the sons of Shem, and into the valley of the mighty river,
even the river whose outflow and course the ocean can not arrest,
pouring out thick floods of water, mixed with earth, and trees, and
drowned beasts. Then, also, knowledge was increased, and plenty
rewarded the labors of men. The axe was lifted against the thick
trees, and the ploughshare driven through valleys. And the sons of
Shem were advised to do the same labors, and to drop the bow, and
to dwell in fixed houses, and forsake evil spirits and worship <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>.
And to this end peace was made with them, and a place was assigned
to them, even a colony.</p>

<p>15. Eight years ruled James the soldier. In his days Mississippi,
and Illinois, and Missouri, and Alabama were added to our
borders; and it was a time of rest, and of ceasing from strifes and
divisions of men, and the people greatly multiplied and prospered.</p>

<p>16. After this the people called John the son of John to rule over
them; and Harry of the West was his scribe. Now John had been
the chief scribe of James the soldier, and he was a ready writer, and
understood the method of the government. He ruled four years;
and in his days peace continued, and the nation increased in wealth
and strength. His ships went to every part of the world, and they
returned loaded with the products of foreign lands. And he sent
ambassadors to Panama, for Harry had advocated the cause of those
lands and peoples, for they would be free.</p>

<p>17. And when John the son of John, had finished his course, the
people chose Andrew to the government. Andrew was a man of a
stout will and a strong mind, ruling men with vigor and with fear.
He governed the land eight years, and they were years of great excitements
and overturnings of opinion, but of great prosperity. The
enlargement of the cultivated borders, under the hands of art and
industry, which had been commenced under James and under John
the son of John, continued and increased, and the treasury overflowed.
Money became as plenty as iron, and the people were surfeited with
prospects of wealth.</p>

<p>18. And the people liked Andrew. He knocked shackles from

<!-- page 426 -->

commerce, and made it free. He also overthrew the treasuries of
paper-money, and gathered the silver and gold into separate treasuries,
and put faithful men over them, to see that there was no waste.
He made the land of Napoleon pay for the proud words spoken by
that proud man, at Berlin and at Milan, holding up the truncheon of
his power with great authority. He caused one of the tribes of the
Eagle family, which had faltered in a certain particular, to walk up
and tighten her hold on the national chain.</p>

<p>19. In Andrew's days large spaces of the wilderness were possessed,
and ploughed with the plough; Michigan and Arkansas arising
and saying, We, too, will join the league, and they joined it; and the
sons of Shem, whom James had kindly and wisely advised, gathered
he together, from their wayfaring positions, and sent them to a territory
and a colony, west of the great river, where they might till the
land and become followers of the plough and dressers of vines, and
keep cattle. And Andrew died after he had gone home to his own
house, even the Hermitage, praising <span class="smcap">God</span>, and telling his household
and servants of <span class="smcap">His</span> goodness.</p>

<p>20. Then called the people Martin to rule over them, and he
ruled four years. Martin was a civilian of great foresight and knowledge,
and subtlety in affairs. He had been the chief scribe of
Andrew, and had served him at the court of the Lion, and he carried
out the principles of Andrew respecting the method of the government.
He continued the treasuries of hard money, and left the
ships of the merchants free to sail, and fetch and carry whatsoever
they would. And the people traded exceedingly, and they also put
high values on all lands and houses, and every thing whatsoever, insomuch
that there was a great re&auml;ction, and revulsion, and outcry
among the merchants and the artizans, for much money had made
the people mad.</p>

<p>21. In Martin's days, the provinces of the Lion toward the
North rebelled, and there were battles, and there was bloodshed,
men being hanged, and a ship pitched over the great Falls; and they
sought to entangle him and his government in this rebellion. But he
stoutly resisted it, and sent Winfield, the captain of the host, to keep
peace on the borders, and to restrain the violence; and it was

<!-- page 427 -->

restrained. And our borders were enlarged by Iowa, one of the
growing tribes of the Eagle.</p>

<p>22. And the people laid the sins of Andrew at the door of Martin,
saying, that both these had too much slackened the cords that
bind men in the traces; and there was a vast commotion of opinions,
which heaved like a tempest of the sea, and parties were broken up,
and the people marched with drums, and banners, and songs, and
shoutings; and the shoutings prevailed, and they chose William
Henry to the government.</p>

<p>23. Now William Henry was an aged man and feeble of body,
but the people clave to him because he had fought well, in former
years, against the Lion, and against the sons of Shem, whom he had
overthrown in a great battle, and killed their great chief (Tecumseh)
with the sword. And when he had set his feet in the White House,
which is the "Shushan" of the people, they thronged greatly upon
him and pressed him sorely for places in the treasure-houses and in
all posts of power and influence, so that his frame shook with the
continuous appeals and graspings of hands, and he fell sick and died.</p>

<p>24. Thirty days only had William Henry ruled when he died.
And the custom of the government called John, the Tilite who sat
near William, to step in his place, and to exercise the powers thereof,
during the rest of the time for which the people had called William
Henry.</p>

<p>25. Now John the Tilite was a man of words without stability;
and the tempest of opinion which had brought him up raged yet
more and more. It drew, as it were from the depths of the sea,
mud and slime, and all manner of creeping things, and John crowned
them with power, saying, "Be rulers of ten, and twenty," and they
ruled. And the land was vexed, and troubled sore, for the remaining
space of three years and eleven months that remained of William
Henry. And he stood aghast all his days, saying, What shall I do
with this great people, and how shall I get bread to satisfy the hunger
of so many? And he fed them, sometimes with crumbs, and sometimes
with loaves, and he satisfied them not. He also continued
Daniel, the scribe, whom William had called, and afterward, when
Daniel went to his own house to abide there, he chose Caldwell, a

<!-- page 428 -->

wise man from the South, to fill his place. Through Caldwell's
influence much good was done. In his day Texas was added to the
land, and he gave continually wise counsel to maintain the treasury
of silver and gold, and to keep the seas open, and leave every State
its just rights, and every man his reserved privileges. For he was not
a time-server and zealous of the rights of States, and they called him
the "Nullifier." And in his days joined Florida, and Wisconsin, and
Texas the league.</p>

<p>26. Then gave the people out lots between Harry of the West
and James the Third; and the lot fell on James the Third, a civilian
from the country where Andrew had risen, even Tennessee;
and James ruled four years. In his days sought the Lion to curtail
our borders, on the west, along the great sea, even in Oregon;
and the waves of opinion heaved heavily, with the people saying,
"We will have a great line, even 54&deg; 40';" but in the end James
accepted a small line, as Daniel the scribe had done aforetime, in the
days of John the Tilite, on the north-east border; and the writing
of a treaty was also made with the Lion, touching the extreme
western border, and that border was fixed and established. Yet
had the land no rest, for there arose a great cloud in the South, and
trouble on the southern border, where the sons of Shem had had a
great kingdom, and offered idolatrous sacrifices to the sun and to the
great god of war, Huitzelapochtli. And Lopez rose up, saying,
"Thou hast stolen away my vineyards and fields, even Texas, and I
will smite thee with armies." And Lopez was a cruel man, shooting
prisoners in cold blood, and vaunting vehemently.</p>

<p>27. And the armies of Shem and of the south country, led by
Lopez and by vain persons, crossed the borders and vaunted themselves;
and they were met by the armies of Samuel of Texas, and by
the armies of James, led by two valiant captains of the host, even
Zachary and Winfield, and they were utterly discomfited and over
thrown, battle on battle, with a heavy slaughter, and driven back
even to their chief city, which was taken and conquered, and the
whole land subdued. Then made the chief of that land terms of a
treaty, and ran the lines of it from the riv-er to the great hinder sea,
and it was made sure to James and his people, so that the rule of

<!-- page 429 -->

James was very prosperous, and the country grew, and the people
were multiplied exceedingly, and our borders were greatly enlarged
on the south and west.</p>

<p>28. And in his days was gold discovered in the country of one of
the tribes, even in California; and it was found in great abundance,
and continually, so that Ophir itself could not exceed it. And gold
became as plenty as iron, and they shipped it as they ship bread, and
the country grew and prospered in all things, and the fame of it went
abroad into all nations. So brought James the period of his rule to
a close with great gladness and rejoicings. And he went home and
died at peace with <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>29. Then spake they of Lewis of Michigan. Now Lewis was a
man brought up among the people, and he was wise and prudent,
having used both pen and sword for the land, wherefore the people
demanded him. And there was a man named Zachary, who was
brave and undaunted, one who laughed at fear. Now, the people
ever loved a man who had fought battles, and Zachary was a soldier,
rough and ready, who had led the armies of James in the field, and
conquered the enemy both on the plains and in fenced cities, and mastered
them mightily.</p>

<p>30. And when they had given out lots between Lewis and
Zachary, the lot fell to Zachary; and to quit himself of the duties of
the civilian, he chose men for scribes, of every sort, who understood
the manner of the government. Still pressed these duties heavily on
him, for in his days rose a great question of the sons of Ham, whom
Japhet held in bondage, and whom certain of the tribes said, Why
keep ye them in bonds? let them go free. And when a year and
six months had passed, Zachary fell sick and died. For <span class="smcap">God</span> took
him away from a dreadful tumult to come, and from civil war.</p>

<p>31. Then called they, for so was the custom of deaths, Millard,
his right-hand man, who sat near the chief ruler, as John the Tylite
had, and he served the remainder of the time of Zachary, even two
years and six months. In his time was the question of the sons of
Ham made great, and the people had a mind to settle it, and they
settled it after great and angry debate; and so it was that nothing
was diminished from every man's right, leaving the sons of Ham in

<!-- page 430 -->

a mild bondage, where aforetime they were in bondage, and free
where aforetime they were free, saying, Let the new territories decide
for themselves, for the people could not otherwise agree, and it was a
question which threatened the stability of the government. In his
days was California added to the league, and the people grew.</p>

<p>32. During the rule of Millard was the seventh numbering of the
people, and they were found to be three and twenty millions, not
counting smaller sums. And there were counted three millions of
the sons of Ham, but the descendants of Shem numbered they not,
for they were wild men, and dwelt in the forests with bows in their
hands. Albeit the third James had said to a man named Henry, Go
number them, and return their number so that we may know it. In
the days of Millard answered the said Henry, there are four hundred
thousand of the sons of Shem, and the numbering is not finished, and
they possess a wide country between sea and sea, even millions of
squares, with mountains and fastnesses and plains, and they are a
fierce people; and Millard said, Go on, number them, and make an
end of it, and write the account.</p>

<p>33. Then the people, when Millard's time drew near, assembled
together in great numbers, abiding in one place for many days, and
there were great searchings to find a man to be put in the government.
And the most part were for Lewis, and others for James the
Pennite, and for William of York, and for Stephen, and for Daniel of
York, and for Samuel. Also were there great canvassings for Winfield
the captain of the host, and for Millard, who still ruled, and for
Daniel the Scribe. But they chose Franklin of the Granite State,
whose father had fought in the Rebellion; for they said, He is both a
civilian and a soldier, who understandeth the manner of the government,
and he will firmly stand by the Compromise which is made
respecting the sons of Ham.</p>

<p>34. And Franklin called William of York to be his chief scribe,
and the country prospered and grew. His ships went freely to every
land, and gold, which had been found in the time of James the Third,
continued to be dug up, as stones and iron are dug, and it was sent
across the waters to foreign nations as bread. And no country hath
ever prospered in this manner, since the Lord established Israel in the

<!-- page 431 -->

promised land. For the name of <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> and the <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
is called on in all the length and breadth of the land. There is no
land that has prospered like this land, and no people who have multiplied
and prospered like this people; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath a favor unto
them, because they serve and praise him. This is the history of
eight and seventy years, and they have been years of increase. Thirteen
tribes have multiplied into one and thirty, and three millions of
souls into three and twenty millions. And they retain their integrity
still, as when they came over the sea, when they fled from the symbolic
Babylon, singing praises to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and trusting in <span class="smcap">Him</span> while they
laid their hands on the plough, and scattered the seed in the ground.
Every man here standeth on his own legs and his own feet, with none
to lay unequal burdens on his shoulders or make him afraid, but he
truly liveth by his own vine and fig-tree. Every man also lifteth up
his soul and his voice to <span class="smcap">God</span>, without any name or power standing
between him and his <span class="smcap">Maker</span>, but the Great <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, who is

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Holy</span> is human life; a mystery
    Beyond the surgeon's ken, the sage's thought
Whence comes it? Why and whither doth it flee?
    Science in vain its secret haunt hath sought;
Its mystic errand Nature never taught;
    Man knows not even what bids those heart-springs move
By which life's current through his frame is wrought;
    Yet, guiltily presumptuous, looks above,
And dares <span class="smcap">God's</span> heart to search, <span class="smcap">God's</span> attributes to prove!</p>

<p class="stanza">Can the white hand of pure and holy Right
    Be in the hue of human slaughter dyed?
Can Piety a pretext find to smite,
    Making libation of the gashed heart's tide?
What right to quench that flame to <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>  allied,
    Which earth can ne'er relume? Could human deed
Have driven <i>our Saviour</i> to a homicide?
    Dread should the danger be, and dire the need
That asks one sacred life, or bids a nation bleed.</p>

<p class="stanza">Accurst the miscreant, whose spider care
    Weaves o'er a people's fate the web of war!
Too cold to pity, and too base to dare,
    He gloats o'er Murder's revel from afar:
Selfish, impassive, 't is his part to tar
<!-- page 434 -->    Men's passions on to crime; till, axle-deep
In human gore, they drive the conqueror's car,
    And call it Glory! Can the monster sleep?
Mads he not, as hot waves of blood his couch o'erleap?</p>

<p class="stanza">Still guiltier, baser, see the Duel ape
    The strife of realms I With ceremony due,
His friends&mdash;<i>his friends!</i>&mdash;the formal folly shape,
    And give it murder's form and murder's hue:
They phrase it honor! Honor never knew
    The idiot crime; but, wise and pure and brave,
Is ever unto <span class="smcap">God</span> and duty true:

For 't is not Passion bids the victim bleed;
    And oft the murderer slays when loth to kill.
Not erring Nature, Hate, nor Rage, nor Need,
    His wretched plea: he goes, in conscious ill,
Defying <span class="smcap">God</span> and man, a felon's grave to fill.</p>

<p class="stanza">'T is <i>basest</i>, for not willingly he goes,
    That whipped and trembling thrall of sordid fear;
(Save when the dark life-gamester deftly throws
    The loaded dice of death; whose life's a sneer,
Whose wine is blood, whose banquet-board the bier:
    The licensed bravo, with his heart of hate,
And eye of snake, who kills with jocund jeer,
    And lives to kill: fiends on his triumphs wait,
And own, abashed, their lord and master, not their mate!)</p>

<p class="stanza">'T is basest, for not willingly he goes,
    But lashed by fears that wisdom would deride;
Not fears of life nor law, of friends nor foes,
    Of conscience outraged, nor of virtuous pride.

    A sneer! From whom? Fools with nor heart nor brain,
Whose praise, as unto infamy allied,

And yet the craven bows, and basely wears their chain!</p>

<p class="stanza">The voluntary madman dares not think;
    From that dread gulf he turns, appalled, away;
He dares not, standing on the dark grave's brink,

He asks no good man's blessing on that day;
    But to the field, with guilty stealth, he hies;
Brute nerves suffice his brutal part to play.

    A blissful home, ev'n Virtue's honest scorn;
All could not lift the hero's soul above
    A false and fatal shame. Well might he mourn
His bride and babes, left stricken and forlorn;
    His cause deserted, and his country: still
He left the fame so nobly won and worn,
    Conscious and sad, the duellist's grave to fill:
False honor's loud call drowned the voice&mdash;<i>Thou shall not kill!</i></p>

His life a torture, and his name a stain!
    When will true Honor's sons to teach unite

<p>What a beautiful night it is! What a jingling of sleigh-bells, and
what a scene of gladness in the streets! And here I am, an old bachelor,
confined by rheumatism, solitary and alone. That was a most
miserable mistake I made twenty years ago, not to have secured the
love of some loving heart, whose presence would have poured a flood
of light into the depths of my darkened soul; and here I am at the

<!-- page 438 -->

disposal of that young gal of mine, neglectful of me because her head
is full of some body else. Sophy! Sophy! What can have become
of the gal? [<i>Looks out at window.</i>] Ah! there she is, standing on the
door-step, bare-headed, looking up and down for that harum-scarum
lover of hers. [<i>Raps on the window</i>]</p>

<div class="center">

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span>, <i>who makes ready to set the table.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Why is my dinner delayed? I have been waiting for two hours
for my dinner. What am I to have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. You are to have no dinner; the doctor said you must diet
yourself upon tea and toast.</p>

<p>Mr. C. The doctor be hanged! I won't starve to please him.
Bring me up that cold turkey and canvas-back duck; roast me some
potatoes; make me some toast and a cup of strong coffee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. It can't be. The doctor must be obeyed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Say to Doctor Hall I've changed my physician, and
have called in Doctor Green. I want something to eat, and I will
have it. If Allopathy won't give me food, Homeopathy will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. You must be content for to-night with tea and toast, for
I've nothing better for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Nothing for me! Where's the turkey roasted yesterday!
Where's that canvas-back duck the widow Simpkins sent
over to me? I hate to receive her gifts, but for this time I will thank
her heartily. Go! bring up my dinner. Do n't delay a moment,
[<i>putting his hand on her shoulder, and hurrying her toward the door.</i>]</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span> <i>stops at the door, and, turning round, says:</i></p>

<p>You can't have the turkey, nor the duck. You must diet for
to-night, any how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. I will have it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. You can't have it!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Who says 'can't' to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>, [<i>with a low curtsey</i>] I say it; and for sufficient reasons.
Old Tom came in and ate up the turkey for his dinner; and I ate the
canvas-back duck for mine; and there's nothing left for you but what
the doctor ordered&mdash;tea and toast, [<i>Aside.</i>] Master's mad as a

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Is not this beyond all endurance? And yet this
wild girl is the most kindly-disposed servant I have had for the last
two years; who plunders me least, and sometimes has a heart of
sympathy. That Dick Driver takes up too much of her time. I
must marry her off; I see that clearly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpkins has called over to see Mr. Crusty. What shall I
say, Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Tell her I am lying down before the fire, in great
misery, and can't see her; and when she goes out, bolt the door.

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, [<i>solus.</i>] Was ever such a wretched man as I? Left
by my nieces for their new-found homes and husbands, I sit here for
hours alone, with no body to care for me but this gal, who comes
between me and all the nice things my lady friends send me day by
day; all because I did not marry at twenty-five. A most miserable
mistake I have made of it. Alas! 'tis now too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. And are you not a prisoner? Have n't you said so, a hundred

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. What sort of bread is this? [<i>taking up the loaf and
looking at it angrily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. It is wheat bread, Sir. I bought it at Mr. Havennus' for
wheat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, [<i>rising in a rage.</i>] I tell you it is rye bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. I say it is not rye.</p>

in his hand, with</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span> <i>following</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. My pretty Sophy, you know you love me, and why do you
deny it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. I love you! Who told you so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. You told me so with your own sweet lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Are you crazy? I never told you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Do you deny it? Do you forget who brought you home
last Sunday night, from meeting? and after I had eaten supper with
you, do you not remember that you went with me to the back-door,
and just before you unhasped the door, that I put my arms round
your waist, and&mdash;you kissed me, Sophy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. And how dare you remind me of it, if I did? It was
unmaidenly in me to do so, and it is most impertinent in you to tell
me of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Well, Sophy, I did n't suppose you played at fast-and-loose
with any one, or that you ever gave a kiss where you had not before
given your love. I hate a flirt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. What did you come here for? to pick a quarrel with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. No, indeed, I did not. But it is so nice a night, that I
thought you would like to take a sleigh-ride with me, and it was to
ask you I came; but no matter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. And why did n't you say so at first, and so have saved
me all this bother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. And will you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. If Mr. Crusty will give me leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. And you do love me, Sophy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. I love to go a-sleigh-riding with you, Dick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. And to kiss me at the back-door in the dark, but not in the
parlor; that won't do for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. It will do for you. You shall never have it in your power
to remind me of what, if I am willing to do, I am not willing ever to

<!-- page 441 -->

be told of doing. Hush now! Mr. Crusty's coming. If you want
me to go a-sleigh-riding, ask his leave.</p>

on a sleigh-ride with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. And what have you to say to it, my young gal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Please do n't call me gal, Sir. Call me Sophy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. That's no answer to my question. Tell me, <i>gal</i>, is
this young man your lover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. He says he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. And what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. I <i>say</i> nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Nothing! What right has he to ask me this permission
in your presence without your leave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. He does many things without asking my leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. He does! A pretty gal you! Have I warned you
to keep yourself away from these young chaps, and here comes one
and asks to take you out a-sleigh-riding? I am ready to give my consent
when I know he has sought yours as his wife, and has obtained
it. What say you, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. I am ready to marry Sophy on sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.] What does Sophy say? a sleigh-ride and
a husband, or no husband and no sleigh-ride?</p>

happy that Dick is ready to take me off your hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. You baggage! You know I marry you to Dick,
that I may be better attended to when you shall have no one to look
out for who does not reside under my roof with you. Go! and be
happy. I will see that all things are ready for the tieing of the knot,

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. All alone, Mr. Crusty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Certainly; always alone!</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Oh! it is so hard to be all alone!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Pray, what do you know about solitude? You are
a young lady still; a widow of a year's growth; young, quite young;
and what do you know of being all alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. And have n't I had a world-wide experience?
Have I not loved, and can I ever cease to feel the want of my Henry's
presence, and his voice to soothe and encourage me? Oh! how can
I cease to be wretched, when, with a woman's heart, I am alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Why in the world do n't you marry? There is
Ned Dashall, who has been following you like a shadow; why not
make him happy, as you know how?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Do you think it would be wise in me to marry a
man whose only recommendation is his youth? Dear Mr. Crusty,
you do n't know the heart of a loving woman! It is truth, talent,
and virtue I love; and I do wish I had such a heart to love me!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. You are very candid. Why do n't you advertise
for a husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. O, Mr. Crusty, enough of this badinage. I did n't
come here to talk about marrying. But here's a paper Lawyer
Sparrowhawk has sent me by his man, and says I must return it
to him signed, and there's no time for delay. It is something about
the cotton lands in Alabama. And here's a letter from the Auditor
of the State, saying, unless taxes are paid up at once on these lands,
they will be sold. Now, I never heard of these lands before. I would
not sign this paper till you had seen it, for I can trust no one but you.
I am a poor widow, with no one to advise me.</p>

<!-- page 443 -->

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. How can you say so? Not a day has passed since
the death of your heels-over-head husband, that I have not been at
work to save you from the net-work of embarrassments in which he
has involved all your property and his own.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Do n't, do n't! I can't hear one word said to the
disparagement of dear Henry. He was always a loving husband
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Let me see that paper. [<i>Reads the paper; lays it
down with emotion.</i>] That lawyer is a nice nut for the devil to crack
one of these days. My poor child! there's no saving you from rascality,
but by marrying you myself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. You, you, my dear Mr. Crusty? Oh! you do n't
mean what you say!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. I do, from the very bottom of my soul!</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. And are you indeed, indeed serious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Never more so in my life. You need a husband to
take care of your affairs; I need a wife to take care of me. The
exchange is most unequal on your part, to marry an old man like me.
Ah! I made a mistake twenty years ago, and I have been finding it
out for ten years past; but I feared it was too late to confess it to
any lady, and I do now tell it to you, my lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Oh! it is great joy to me to hear it; to know it is
now told to me by yourself. To me!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. You are an angel, and I shall clip your wings before
you fly away. Now, then, will you marry me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. I will, six months hence; for, you know, I must
have time to make all suitable preparations for such an event. I
must first lay aside my weeds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Not an hour! In matters of this sort, especially,
there's danger in delay. Do n't you reflect that your "dear five hundred
fashionable friends" will all do their best to put me out of your
head. They will tell you, and tell you truly, I am too old for you.
They will count every gray hair in my head, and tell you the exact
number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. If all the world were to unite, it would not move
me. No, never!</p>

<!-- page 444 -->

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Ah! well. It may be true of a woman; but, I fear,
if the outcry of all the Mr. and Mrs. Grundys of our town should not
move you, they would move me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. O Mr. Crusty, do n't say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Yes, but I do say so; and upon my soul, I believe
they will be in the right, and I, for the first time in my life, will be
all in the wrong. They will tell me what a fool I am, on the shady
side of forty-five, to marry a young widow, who will be made miserable
for life by her folly and mine; and upon my soul, I think they
will have the right of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Oh! no! I do n't care a pin what people may say;
they always will talk, and let them. I <i>will marry you</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Now or never, then, my sweet lady; at once. If I
am to do a foolish act, let it be done now. If it be an act of folly,
we shall find it out, all in good time, and save our friends the trouble
of doing so in advance.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Yes, it will be best; for though they never could
change my mind, they might make us feel, for a time, unhappy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. We won't give 'em a chance.</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span> <i>are heard in the entry. They enter.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. I hope you have enjoyed your ride, and now, Mister
Dick, I want the use of the sleigh for myself. Sophy, bring me my
hat and cloak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Are you mad, Mr. Crusty, to be going out; and, pray,
what for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Mrs. Lovely and myself are going down, with you
and Dick, to Doctor Butler's, to see you safely married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Bless me, Sir! I am not ready to be married, nor Dick
either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Well, if you are not, Mrs. Lovely and I are; so
bring me my hat and cloak, and you and Dick may follow our example,
if you choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Is it so, Mrs. Lovely?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>. Yes, it is all true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>, [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, <i>aside.</i>] I fear master is mad as a March hare.</p>

<!-- page 445 -->

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>, [<i>aside.</i>] Mad! to marry so sweet a lady!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>, [<i>aside.</i>] If she comes here, my nose will be put all awry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>, [<i>aside.</i>] Marry me, my dear gal!</p>

<span class="smcap">Sophy</span>, [<i>aside.</i>] I won't be called <i>gal</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>, [<i>aside.</i>] Let me call you wife, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, [<i>who, while this has been going on, has had his hat
and cloak put on by</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lovely</span>, <i>who has put her own scarf around
his neck with utmost care and regard.</i>] What is all that whispering
about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Sophy consents to follow the example of her kind master,
and we will all be happy together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Happy! I had thought that word could never be
mine. We <i>will</i> be happy together. I will write my own Epithalamium,
and we will sing our madrigals with merry hearts together.
Let us now go to the parson.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. What makes you so <i>glum?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. I do n't like the way we were married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Do you dare tell me you are so soon sorry you have
made me your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. I am not sorry for that, Sophy; but I do n't like what the
minister said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Why, when he had got through almost, he pronounced us
"<i>man</i> and wife." I wonder if I was n't a man before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. No, indeed. You were <i>no body;</i> and, let me tell you,
you are not the first no body who has been made <i>some body</i> by marrying
a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>, [<i>muses a little, and then speaks.</i>] I've a great notion to go
back and have it done over again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. For why?</p>

<!-- page 446 -->

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. I'll tell you for why. The parson made us all stand up
together, with Mr. Crusty and Mrs. Lovely, so as to save time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Well, what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. It seems to me too much like saying grace over a barrel of
pork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. If Doctor Butler had married us separately, what is the
difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Ah! then I would have stopped the parson until you said,
out loud, "I will," and not made a bow and said in your heart, "I
won't."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. How do you know I said, "I won't?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. Do n't I read you like a book? When he said, "Wilt thou
obey him and serve him?" and all that, you brought your lips to a
pinch, and said to yourself, "I won't." Did n't you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Yes, I did; and I mean what I said then, and say now.
I won't obey you when I think my way is the best; and now I may
as well tell you once for all&mdash;I make a fair bargain with you&mdash;I
will take charge of the inside of the house, and you shall take the outside.
If you are industrious, honest, and cheerful, outside, you shall
find the inside of the house as warm and as snug as a dove's nest;
but if you do n't, you will find yourself lying on a bed of thorns.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Why! quarrelling with your new husband, Sophy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>. Oh! no, Madam; I was only telling Dick what I expected
of him, and what he might expect of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span>.] She has promised you, as I heard just
now, a bed of thorns. Do n't you wish yourself unmarried, Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span>. I have no fears for Sophy. Love shall never be wanting
on my part; and it is love, and not duty, on which I rely to control
any waywardness of my young wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>. Bravo! Dick, and now let us sing our <span class="smcap">Madrigal</span>,
and then good-night!</p>

<p>A FRAGMENT FROM AN UNPUBLISHED STORY.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">And</span> I look up to Heaven in supplication;
    With passionate prayers along the pathway starred
I send my soul to <span class="smcap">Christ</span> for an oblation,
    But find the entrance to his presence barred.
To Love Supreme, upon their pearly hinges
    The golden gates of Paradise unfold,
As after night and storm their blazing fringes
    The clouds lift up, and glory is unrolled,
So beautiful and grand, upon the mountains,
    That we see not the valleys, nearer lying,
Nor even hear the musical play of fountains,
    Nor the earthlife that gives it glad replying.
To Love Supreme! but ah! my heart is buried
    There in her coffin; and the prayer I'm breathing
Is for her smile, on flowers I there have carried,
    Her gentle smile, on flowers I there was wreathing&mdash;
With more of fear than love, as to a teacher
    Comes the young child to ask his mate for playing,
And, as he speaks, lets go his soul to reach her
    Ere he has heard the voice of his own praying.</p>

<p class="stanza">You can not come, you can not even hear me,
    The gates are closed while I without am calling.
I look around, no more I see you near me,
    Upon my lifted face are arrows falling.
<!-- page 450 -->Because I love you more than I love Heaven
    Heaven has no mercy. All my heart's fond caring
Was for your eyes' sweet light, that now is riven,
    And I grope on in darkness and despairing.
Hear me, oh <span class="smcap">God</span>! if there await no morrow,
    If, for our severed hearts, there is no meeting,
If still must fall in tempests all this sorrow,
    (No sorrow whiles I held <i>you</i> from its beating!)
Then let the hills, in avalanches turning,
    Engulf me in their centres; with her features,
Dear, though so cold, on mine, into that burning
    I would go down, with all the meaner creatures,
Calmly into extinction; but desiring
    That as I bore what was her form, in blindness,
She would in it relive, for my expiring,
    And thrill my panting, sinking soul, with kindness.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah! I from that verge of Death's dark boundless ocean,
    As I the cliffs from life and hope descended,
Could I look back and know that your devotion
    Not with your glory or my gloom is ended&mdash;
Hear the old tones, see in the eyes old feelings,
    While, for one moment, on my own the pressing
Of your dear lips: O <span class="smcap">Heaven</span> ! those wild revealings
    Should turn this blast to an immortal blessing.
Then, O ye surges, that are now entombing
    The ever-dying in your caverns dreary,
Then I could hear all unappalled your booming,
    Nor of your crowding horrors ever weary&mdash;
With the last effort of each sense receiving
    The truth that should be foil against your powers,
Brave your strange boiling, roaring, and upheaving,
    Leap to your horrors as to seas of flowers!</p>

<h3 id="c46">Letter from Mr. Willis.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[<span class="smcap">The</span> contribution to our volume which was promised by Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span> has been interrupted by
the state of his health; but the letter which he writes to Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, explanatory of his delay, at
the same time that it is expressive of his kind wishes, is of a tone and quality so suited to the
general reader that we will venture to place it in the vacant niche.]</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Idlewild</span>, <i>October</i> 8, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Clark</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I regret</span> exceedingly to say that I must be the delinquent among
your troop of friends. The time is up, and I have no "article" to
send you. My long and tedious illness would be an excuse if I could
explain to your public why I can go on writing as freely as ever for
myself, and yet be too much of an invalid to write for a friend. But
so it is. The mind of an ailing editor will go on with its <i>weakly</i>
iteration when, for the production of any thing in an unaccustomed
form, it <i>will not</i> come to the scratch. I assure you I have tried&mdash;for
two patient days I have subjected my "promise of an article" to
conscientious incubation. In vain&mdash;the ugly customer will not chip
shell. I rejoice that the "Turkey extra" which your Prospectus
offers to subscribers does not depend upon <i>my</i> hatching.</p>

<p>But who wrote that same Prospectus? And what does he mean
by your labors being "ill-requited"? Come, come, my dear fellow!
The forty leading authors of the country rushing up with pick-axe and
shovel to stop the first break in your mill-dam, and yet no complaint
as to the popularity of your grists! What fortune that was ever
made in trade would buy the equivalent of this honor? How are
you an object of sympathy, I should like to know? Money (beyond
victuals and clothes) is no necessity to <i>you!</i> Other people want it
to put them on the first round of the ladder you are thus proved to
be at the top of. The Fates have regulated these things ever since

<!-- page 452 -->

fame was a commodity. One man is not to have every thing. If
you want to know what you weigh, see what Destiny has put into the
opposite scale.</p>

<p>No, my dear <span class="smcap">Clark</span>! You are far off yet from the only point
where the world can be fairly called upon for sympathy with a literary
life. There is such a point: its old age is apt to be bitter. You are
in the prime of manhood; in the full exercise of vigor and resource;
likely, for many a year, to hold the willing attention of your tributary
thousands. But there comes a time when the pen falters&mdash;the brain
faints&mdash;the hand that was reluctantly paid, even for its fulness, comes
empty or poorly laden&mdash;a time when it would be wiser for the pen
to stop, but it dare not&mdash;when sickness and weariness enfeeble the
mind upon which necessity still calls for brilliancy and strength.
Then comes what might well ask for sympathy. The old age of
literary men seems to be a Lethean unavoidable gulf of oblivion
which they must needs cross to their immortality. The world which
is to honor them when dead forgets them when old. Willing gold
for your monument, but reluctant pennies to keep you from starving
on your way to it!</p>

<p>It has been often enough said that nations will not be just to their
glory-furnishers till they look kindly on the improvidence of genius,
giving to literary men who have run their career and won their
laurels either means to resist poverty or an honorable asylum out of
its reach. The latter would be the better thing; but there is likely
to be no such Vallambrosa. John Bull would have thought of it for
Hood and Campbell, if for any body; and Uncle Sam thinks it quite
enough to "put the train through" for immortality, without building
a waiting-room for passengers.</p>

<p>Well, success to you!&mdash;only do n't be so prosperous as to stagger
our faith in your other deservings&mdash;and among those who will "take
stock" in you, (as long as you continue "ill-requited,") put me down
for a share or two, and believe me</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">N. P. Willis</span>.</p>

<p>" 'So,' muttered the dark and musing prince, unconscious of the throng, 'so perishes the Race
of Iron. Low lies the last Baron that could control and command the people. The Age of Force
expires with knighthood and deeds of arms. And over this dead great man I see the new cycle
dawns. Happy, henceforth, he who can plot, and scheme, and fawn, and smile.' "</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">And</span> so the Race of Iron passed&mdash;
    So Burnet's bloody field
Saw, cold and still, its lion heart
    Lie crushed with <span class="smcap">Warwick's</span> shield;
And when the victor's trumpet rang
    Above his fallen head,
The age of knightly deeds had passed&mdash;
    The Baron-power was dead.</p>

<p class="stanza">Lord of a hundred baronies,
    Chief of a mighty race,
His lightest word the people's law,
    The throne his knotted mace;
Girt by his more than royal host,
    He heard his war-trump ring,
And towered among his barons bold,
    Too proud to be a king.</p>

<p class="stanza">But Time was working wondrous change,
    And from his native realm
Were passing fast the Barons' rule,
    The haubert and the helm.
<!-- page 454 -->The land was dealt to nobles new,
    And men of foreign birth,
And London loons were swarming round
    The broad old Norman hearth.</p>

<p class="stanza">His Age had perished, and the Race
    That gave the Age renown
Fell with it, and the Castle bowed
    In silence to the Town.
Low lay its great and mighty Chief,
    Its last and noblest man,
And dawning o'er his broken brand
    The Age of Trade began:</p>

<p class="stanza">The Age when Barter sneered at Birth,
    And parchment pedigrees
Outweighed the names the Normans bore
    Across the stormy seas;
When shone no more the honest brow
    Beneath the burgonot,
And men began to fawn, and smile,
    And cheat, and lie, and plot:</p>

<p class="stanza">When knaves trod on the knightly heel,
    And Avarice, like a rust,
Eat out the brave old chivalry,
    And swords grew thick with dust;
When churls and serfs grew fat with gain,
    And villains bought the land,
And scorned the iron men of yore,
    The battle-axe and brand.</p>

<p class="stanza">The pen usurped the sword; the loom,
    The mace; the plough, the spear;
And Agriculture cut the grain
    Where rang the battle cheer;
And men began to feel the rule
    Of Trade, more potent grown
Than baron grim, or iron earl,
    Or monarch on his throne.</p>

<!-- page 455 -->

<p class="stanza">'T was best, perhaps: yet from the Age
    When trick and traffic came;
When knights turned knaves, and ladies fair
    Grew false to woman's fame;
The Age in mincing merchant-kings
    And London tailors great;
When craft and cunning, fawn and fraud,
    Began to rule the state:</p>

<p class="stanza">We turn, great Baron! to the men
    That crowned thy regal times,
Admire their rude, gigantic strength,
    And half forget their crimes.
The castle nursed a mighty race&mdash;
    A race of Nature's mould;
And worth meant something more than wealth,
    And grandeur, more than gold.</p>

<p class="stanza">Those monarch earls and lion lords,
    And barons stout and brave,
Despised the crawling sycophant,
    The sleek and cringing knave;
Their grim baronial banners told
    Of battles <i>they</i> had fought;
Of honors passed from sire to son,
    And not of titles bought.;</p>

<p class="stanza">But trade and traffic, stock and steam,
    The platter and the plough,
The mallet and the milliner
    Are lord and lady now.
The Castle crowns the mousing mart,
    The Palace sails the deep,
Ambition mounts to bantam hens.
    And chivalry to sheep.</p>

<p class="stanza">The Earl discusses curly blues,
    The Baron runs to seed,
And Fame combines a purgative,
    And Skill invents a mead;

<h3 id="c48">Trees.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY ALFRED B. STREET.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> pluming the mountain, edging the lake, eye-lashing the
stream, roofing the waterfall, sprinkling the meadow, burying the
homestead, or darkening leagues of hill, plain, and valley, trees have
always "haunted me like a passion." Let me summon a few of
them, prime favorites, and familiar to the American forest.</p>

<p>The aspen&mdash;what soft, silver-gray tints on its leaves, how smooth
its mottled bark, its whole shape how delicate and sensitive! You
may be sitting on the homestead lawn some summer noon, the trees
all motionless, and the hot air trembling over the surface of the
unstirred grass. Suddenly you will hear a fluttering like the unloosing
of a rapid brook, and looking whence comes the sound, you will
see the aspen shaking as if falling to pieces, or the leaves were little
wings each striving to fly off. All this time the broad leaf of the
maple close by, does not even lift its pointed edges. This soft murmur
really sends a coolness through the sultry atmosphere; but
while your ear is drinking the music and your eye filled with the
tumultuous dancing, instantly both cease as if the tree were stricken
with a palsy, and the quiet leaves flash back the sunshine like so many
fairy mirrors.</p>

<p>Next the elm. How noble the lift and droop of its branches!
With such graceful downward curves on either side, it has the shape
of the Greek vase. Such lavish foliage also, running down the trunk
to the very roots, as if a rich vine were wreathed around it! And
what frame-works those branches shape, breaking the landscape
beyond into half-oval scenes which look through the chiaroscuro as

<!-- page 458 -->

if beheld through slightly shaded glass. And how finely the elm leans
over the brook&mdash;its native place&mdash;turning the water into ebony, and
forming a shelter for the cattle from the heat. It is scattered, too,
over the meadow, making shady nooks for the mowers at their noontide
meal, shadowing also the farmer's gate and mantling his homestead
in an affluence of green.</p>

<p>Then the maple. What a splendid cupola of leaves it builds up
into the sky&mdash;an almost complete canopy from the summer shower.
It reddens brilliantly when the blue-bird tells us spring has come,
and, a few days later, its dropped fringes gleam in the fresh grass like
flakes of fire. And in autumn, too, its crimson is so rich, one might
term it the blush of the wood.</p>

<p>And the beech. How cheerfully its snow-spotted trunk looks
in the deep woods&mdash;how fresh the green of its regularly-scalloped
leaves! At spring-tide the tips of its sprays feather out in the
glossiest and most delicate cream-satin, amid which the young leaf
glows like a speck of emerald. And in the fall what rich clusters of
fruit burthen the boughs! The pattering of the brown three-cornered
beech-nut upon the dead leaves is constant in the hazy, purple
days of our Indian summer, and makes a sweet music, almost continuous
as the dripping of a rill, in the mournful forest.</p>

<p>The birch is a great favorite of mine. It reminds me of the
whistles of my boyhood. Its fragrant bark&mdash;what delight it was to
wrench it from the silvery wood for the shrill music I delighted in,
particularly by the hearth-stone of my home!</p>

<p>"Conscience!" my aunt Katy used to ejaculate, holding her ears;
"is that whistling coming again? John, (John is my name&mdash;John
Smith,) do, <i>do</i> stop!"</p>

<p>And when came a shriller blast,</p>

<p>"John, you little torment! if you do n't stop, I'll box your
ears!"</p>

<p>What splendid tassels the birch hangs out at the bidding of
April!&mdash;tassels that Indian sachems were proud to wear at the most
honored feasts of their nation.</p>

<p>And into such rich gold is it transmuted by October, a light is
almost shed of its own within the sylvan recesses. The speckled

<!-- page 459 -->

bark of the black birch is glossy and bright, but give me the beauty
of the white birch's coat. How like a shaft of ivory it gleams in the
daylight woods&mdash;how the flame of moonlight kindles it into columned
pearl!</p>

<p>Did you ever, while wandering in the forest about the first of
June, have your eyes dazzled at a distance with what you supposed
to be a tree laden with snow? It was the dogwood. Glittering
in its white blossoms, each one spread over a broad leaf of the
brightest verdure, pointed gauze upon emerald, there stands the
pretty tree like a bride. The shadbush and cherry have dropped
their white honors a month before, but the dogwood keeps
company with the basswood and locust in brightening the last days
of spring with its floral beauty. Up in the soft blue it lifts its
wreathed crown, for it gathers its richest glow of blossom at its head,
and makes the forest bright as with silver chandeliers.</p>

<p>While admiring the dogwood, an odor of exquisite sweetness may
salute you; and if at all conversant in tree-knowledge you will know
the censer dispensing this fragrance. But you will have to travel
some distance, and you will do it as the hound tracks the deer, by
scent, for the perfume fills the forest long before the tree catches
the eye. At length you see it&mdash;the basswood&mdash;clustered with
yellow blossoms, golden bells pouring out such strong, delicious fragrance,
you realize the idea of Shelley:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">And</span> the hyacinth, purple, and white, and blue,
Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew
Of music so delicate, soft, and intense,
It was felt like an odor within the sense."</p>

</div>

<p>And the deep hum, too, about it&mdash;an atmosphere of sound&mdash;the
festival of the bees surrounding the chalices so rich with honey.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the flowers of the locust and chestnut in conjunction
with the basswood. Delicate pearl does the former hang
out amid the vivid green of its beautiful leaves, and sweet is that
pearl as the lips of the maiden you love.</p>

<p>And the chestnut&mdash;scattered thickly among its long, dark-green
leaves are strings of pale gold blossoms&mdash;haunts also of the revelling

<!-- page 460 -->

bee. Does the school-boy ever forget "the days that he went"
truanting after the auburn fruit embedded in velvet within, but
without protected by porcupines of husks? With what delight did
the young good-for-nothings pelt down those yellow husks to be
crushed open by indefatigable heels! Ah! the aurora of life&mdash;how
bright, how merry it is!</p>

<p>For ever linked in the minds of these truants with the chestnut is
the walnut. How the green, smooth globes that insphere the fruit
make the eyes of the young vagabonds dance, and how eagerly they
mount to shake down those globes, each fracturing at the fall, and
letting out the round ivories that in turn imprison the dark gold
meats!</p>

<p>And now the oak, "the brave old oak," and so forth. Suppose
yourself in a wood! Do you see that little brown vegetable cup
with a braided cover&mdash;there by the dead maple leaf and tuft of
crimson-headed moss? Yon robin just planted his foot upon and
covered it. And then do you see that towering tree whose head
seems nearly to touch the white cloud above it? Look! upon its
very apex there is a bird, seemingly the size of this wild pigeon on
the beech-tree, but in reality an eagle. A great many years have
intervened between the two objects, it is true, but you think twice
ere realizing that yon seamed, stern, sturdy oak once nestled in this
acorn. So of all trees, you say, from the seed. True again, but
none strikes you so forcibly in this contrast as the oak. And what a
tree it is! First piercing the mould, a tiny needle that the ground-
squirrel would destroy with a nibble, and then rearing grandly
toward the sun a wreath of green to endure for ages. Does the wild
wind dash upon it? Its shakes its proud head, but no more bends
its whole shape than yon crag. Doth the arrowy sleet strike it? Its
leaves only make clicking music; and as for the early snow, it bears
it up easily as a deer would fragments of kalmia-blossoms on his
antlers. How finely its dark green stands out from the lighter hues
of the beeches, birches, and maples! And then how it keeps old
Time at a distance! Why. decades are nothing to it. The child
gathers the violet at its foot; as a boy, he pockets its dropped
acorns; a man, he looks at its height, towering up, towering up, and

<!-- page 461 -->

makes it the emblem of his ambition. Years after, with white hairs
and palsied limbs, he totters at noontide to lie within its shade and
slumber, "perchance to dream" of that last sleep which can not be
distant, and which "knows no waking." But has the oak changed?
Mocker of the storm, stern darer of the lightning, there he stands, the
same, and seemingly for ever. Challenger of Time, defier of earth's
changes, there he stands the pride of the forest, satirizing, in his mute
language, alike the variations of fortune and evanescence of man.</p>

<p>And he does all things in a grand, slow way, unlike other trees.
In spring-time, when the aspen has showed for a month its young
leaves of silver gray, when the beech has thrust forth its beautiful
feathers, when the maple has made a red rain of its glowing blossoms
upon the forest floor, the oak still looks as he did when January
was frowning upon his branches. When the aspen has elaborated
its small leaves into thick foliage, when the beech has spangled
itself over with emerald, when the maple has hung upon its slender
stems its broad pearl-lined verdure, no tint of green upon the oak.
He stands yet in dark disdain, as if mourning the perished winter.
But at last, when the woodland is smiling in its fully-developed glory,
when the tardy blossoms of the locust and tulip-tree are drenching
the air with delicious sweetness, then stirs the oak. Little brown
things are scattered over his great boughs, which in due time become
long, deep-veined leaves; and lo! the regal oak has donned his
splendid robe. The summer passes, and the autumn comes. What
stands at the corner of yon wood, swathed in a mantle of the true
imperial? Crimsons, and yellows, and golden-browns are flashing all
around him, as though there were a carnival among the trees, but no
hue is brighter than that of the brave old oak in his robe of royal
purple. And he is in no more haste to let that robe of his go than
in putting it on. When the shrieking blasts have torn its mantle
from every other tree, the oak still clings to his, as if he said to those
shrieking blasts, "I defy your fury!" When the snow-bird comes
twittering among the woods to tell them the snow will shortly be
showering loose pearl all through their gaunt domains, the oak yet
holds to his mantle, blanched and tattered though it be. High amid
the snow-drifts, firm amid the blasts, the pale crackling leaves still

<!-- page 462 -->

cling, with nothing in the wide, bleak forests to keep them company
save here and there a shivering lingerer upon the beech-tree. Often
it is only when their successors come "to push them from their
stools" that the old leaves quit the gallant oak and lie down to
perish. So a health to the oak!</p>

<p>We will merely touch, in passing, upon the horse-chestnut, with
its great glistening spring-buds bursting into cones of pearly, redspotted
blossoms that almost cover its noble dome of foliage; upon
the hemlock, with its masses of evergreen needles, and the cedar, with
its misty blue berries; upon those tree-like shrubs&mdash;the hopple, with
its gigantic leaves serving as sylvan goblets at pic-nics; the sumac,
with its clusters of splendid crimson; the sassafras, diffusing from its
thick leaf a most delicious breath; the laurel, arching above the
brooks a roof radiant with immense bouquets of rose-touched snow,
and even garlanding the apex of the water-beech with its superb chalices,
while its younger sister, the ivy, crouches at the foot of the
tamarack and spruce, rich in red-streaked urns of blossoms; and the
witch-hazel, smiling at winter, with its curled, sharp-cut flowers of
golden velvet.</p>

<p>We come now to the pine, of all my greatest favorite.</p>

<p>Ho! ho! the burly pine! Hurrah! hurrah for the pine! The
oak may be king of the lowlands, but the pine is the king of the
hills&mdash;aye, and mountains too.</p>

<p>Ho! ho! the burly pine! how he strikes his clubbed foot deep
into the cleft of the rock, or grasps its span with conscious power!
There he lifts his haughty front like the warrior-monarch that he is.
No flinching about the pine, let the time be ever so stormy. His
throne is the crag, and his crown is a good way up in the heavens,
and as for the clouds he tears them asunder sometimes, and
uses them for robes. Then hurrah again for the pine! say I.
Reader, did you ever hear him shout 1 Did you ever hear
thunder?&mdash;for there is a pine mountain on the upper Delaware
that out-roars, in a winter storm, all the thunder you
ever heard! Stern, deep, awfully deep, that roar makes the
heart quiver. It is an airquake of tremendous power. And his
single voice is by no means silvery when he is "in a breeze." When

<!-- page 463 -->

the stern warrior-king has aroused his energies to meet the onslaught
of the storm, the battle-cry he sends down the wind is heard above
all the voices of the greenwood. His robe streams out like a banner,
and so wild does he look, you would think he was about to dash himself
from his throne of rock upon the valley beneath. But no; his
great foot grasps more closely the crag, and when, after a while, the
tempest leaves him, how quietly he settles to his repose! He adorns
his crown with a rich wreath caught from the sunset, and an hour
after, he wears the orbed moon as a splendid jewel upon his haughty
brow. The scented breeze of the soft evening breathes upon him,
and the grim warrior-king wakes his murmuring lute, and oh! such
sounds&mdash;so sweet, so soothing! Years that have passed live again
in the music; tones long since hushed echo once more in the heart;
faces that have turned to dust&mdash;but how loved in the old time!&mdash;glimmer
among the dusky boughs; eyes that years ago closed on
earth to open in heaven smile kindly upon us. We lie down in the
dark shadow upon the mossy roots and are happy&mdash;happy in a sad,
sweet, tender tranquillity that purifies the soul, and while it makes us
content with earth, fills us with love for heaven.</p>

<h3 id="c51">The Physical Development of the United States.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY HON. WM. H. SEWARD.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nations</span> are intelligent, moral persons, existing for the ends of
their own happiness and the improvement of mankind. They grow,
mature, and decline. Their physical development, being most obvious,
always attracts our attention first. Certainly we can not too
well understand the material condition of our own country. "I
think," said Burke, sadly, addressing the British House of Commons,
just after the American war; "I think I can trace all the calamities
of this country to the single source of not, having had steadily before
our eyes a general, comprehensive, well-connected, and well-proportioned
view of the whole of our dominions, and a just sense of their
bearings and relations."</p>

<p>Trace on a map the early boundaries of the United States, as they
were defined by the treaty of Versailles, in 1783. See with what
jealousy Great Britain abridged their enjoyment of the fisheries on
the north-east coast, and how tenaciously she locked up against them
the St. Lawrence, the only possible channel between their inland
regions and the Atlantic ocean. Observe how Spain, while retaining
the vast and varied solitudes which spread out westward from the
Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean, at the same time assigned the
thirty-first parallel of latitude as the southern boundary of the United
States, and thus shut them out from access by that river or otherwise
to the Gulf of Mexico. See now how the massive and unpassable
Alleghany Mountains traversed the new Republic from north to
south, dividing it into two regions: the inner one rich in agricultural

<!-- page 468 -->

resources, but without markets; and the outer one adapted to defence
and markets, but wanting the materials for commerce. Were not the
Europeans astute in thus confining the United States within limits
which would probably render an early separation of them inevitable,
and would also prevent equally the whole and each of the future parts
from ever becoming a formidable or even a really independent Atlantic
power? They had cause for their jealousies. They were monarchies,
and they largely divided the western hemisphere between them.
The United States aimed to become a maritime nation, and their success
would tend to make that hemisphere not only republican, but
also independent of Europe. That success was foreseen. A British
statesman, in describing the American Colonies just before the peace,
had said to his countrymen: "Your children do not grow faster from
infancy to manhood than they spread from families to communities,
and from villages to nations."</p>

<p>The United States, thus confined landward, betook themselves at
once to the sea, whose broad realm lay unappropriated; and, having
furnished themselves with shipping and seamen equal to the adventurous
pursuit of the whale fishery under the poles, they presented
themselves in European ports as a maritime people. Afterward,
their well-chosen attitude of neutrality, in a season of general war,
enabled them to become carriers for the world. But they never forgot,
for a moment, the importance of improving their position on the
coast. France was now the owner of the province of Louisiana, which
stretched all along the western bank of the Mississippi. She wisely
sold a possession, which she was unable to defend, to the United
States, who thus, only twenty years after the treaty of Versailles,
secured the exclusive navigation of the great river; and, descending
from their inland frontier, established themselves on the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico. Spain soon saw that her colonies on that coast, east
of the Mississippi, now virtually surrounded by the United States,
were untenable. She, therefore, for an equivalent, ceded the Floridas,
and retired behind the Sabine; and so the sea-coast of the United
States was now seen to begin at that river, and passing along the
gulf, and around the peninsula, and beyond the capes, to terminate at
the St. Croix, in the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<!-- page 469 -->

<p>The course of the European war showed that Spain was exhausted.
Nearly all her American colonies, inspired by the example of the
United States, and sustained by their sympathy, struck for independence,
established republican systems, and entered into treaties of
amity and commerce with the republic of the North.</p>

<p>But the United States yet needed a northern passage from their
western valleys to the Atlantic ocean. The new channel to be opened
must necessarily have connections, natural or artificial, with the inland
rivers and lakes. An internal trade ramifying the country was a
necessary basis for commerce, and it would constitute the firmest possible
national union. Practically, there was in the country neither a
canal to serve for a model, nor an engineer competent to project one.
The railroad invention had not yet been perfected in Europe, nor even
conceived in the United States. The Federal Government alone had
adequate resources, but, after long consideration and some unprofitable
experiments, it not only disavowed the policy, but also disclaimed
the power of making internal improvements. Private capital was
unavailable for great national enterprises. The States were not convinced
of the wisdom of undertaking singly works within their own
borders which would be wholly or in part useless, unless extended
beyond them by other States, and which, even although they should
be useful to themselves, would be equally or more beneficial to States
which refused or neglected to join in their construction. Moreover,
the only source of revenue in the States was direct taxation&mdash;always
unreliable in a popular government&mdash;and they had no established
credits, at home or abroad. Nevertheless, the people comprehended
the exigency, and their will opened a way through all these embarrassments.
The State of New-York began, and she has hitherto,
although sometimes faltering, prosecuted this great enterprise with
unsurpassed fidelity. The other States, according to their respective
abilities and convictions of interest and duty, have co&ouml;perated. By
canals we have extended the navigation of Chesapeake Bay to the
coal-fields of Maryland at Cumberland, and also by the way of Columbia
to the coal-fields of Pennsylvania. By canals, also, we have
united Chesapeake Bay with the Delaware river, and have, with alternating
railroads, connected that river with the Ohio river and with

<!-- page 470 -->

Lake Erie. By canals we have opened a navigation between Philadelphia
and New-York, mingling the waters of the Delaware with
those of the Raritan. By canals we have given access from two
several ports on the Hudson to two different coal-fields in Pennsylvania.
By canals we have also extended the navigation of the Hudson,
through Lake Champlain and its outlet, to the St. Lawrence near
Montreal. We are just opening a channel from the Hudson to Lake
Ontario, at Cape Vincent, near its eastern termination, while we long
since opened one from the same river to a central harbor on that lake
at Oswego. A corresponding improvement, made by the Canadian
authorities on the opposite shore, prolongs our navigation from Lake
Ontario to Lake Erie. We have also connected the Hudson river
with the eastern branch of the Susquehanna, through the valley of the
Chenango, and again with its western tributaries through the Seneca
Lake. We are also uniting the Hudson with the Alleghany, a tributary
of the Mississippi, through the valley of the Genesee. One long
trunk of canal receives the trade gathered by most of these tributary
channels, while it directly unites the Hudson with Lake Erie at Buffalo.
The shores of that great lake are the basis of a second part of
the same system. Canals connect the Alleghany, in the State of
Pennsylvania, with Lake Erie at Erie; the Ohio river, at Portage
and at Cincinnati, with Lake Erie, at Cleveland and at Toledo; and
again the Ohio river, in the State of Indiana, with Lake Erie, through
the valley of the Wabash. Lake Superior, hitherto secluded from
even internal commerce, is now being connected with the other great
lakes by the canal of the Falls of St. Mary; and, to complete the
whole, the Illinois canal unites the lakes and all the extensive system
I have described, with the Mississippi. Thus, by substituting works
purely artificial, we have not only dispensed with the navigation of
the St. Lawrence, but have also opened a complete circuit of inland
navigation and traffic between New-Orleans, on the Gulf, and New-York,
Philadelphia, and Baltimore, on the Atlantic. The aggregate
length of these canals is five thousand miles, and that of the inland
coasts thus washed by natural and artificial channels exceeds twenty
thousand miles.</p>

<p>Railroads constitute an auxiliary system of improvements, at once

<!-- page 471 -->

more complex and more comprehensive. By railroads we have connected,
or are in the act of connecting, together all the principal sea
ports on the Atlantic coast and on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico,
namely: Portland, Boston, New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk,
Charleston, Mobile, and New-Orleans. Again, railroads from
each or most of these ports proceed inland through important towns,
to great depots on the St. Lawrence, the lakes, the Ohio, and the Mississippi,
namely: Quebec, Montreal, Ogdensburgh, Oswego, Rochester,
Buffalo, Erie, Cleveland, Sandusky, Toledo, Monroe, Detroit, Chicago,
Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, Cairo, and Memphis.
Again, there are tributaries which search out agricultural and
mineral productions and fabrics, accumulated at less notable points;
and so a complete system is perfected, which leaves no inhabited
region unexplored, while it has for its base the long line of seaboard.
The aggregate length of these railroads is sixteen thousand miles, and
the total cost is six hundred millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Immediately after the purchase of Louisiana, President Jefferson
having conceived the idea of a national establishment on the Pacific
coast, an exploration of the intervening wastes was made. An American
navigator about the same time visited the coast itself, and thus
laid the foundation of a title by discovery. A commercial settlement,
afterward planted on the Columbia river by the late John Jacob
Astor, perished in the war of 1812. Ten years ago, the great thought
of Pacific colonization revived, under the influences of the commercial
activity resulting from the successful progress of the system of Internal
Improvements. Oregon was settled. Two years afterward, its
boundaries were defined, and it was politically organized; and now it
constitutes two prosperous Territories.</p>

<p>The social, military, and ecclesiastical institutions of Mexico
proved unfavorable to an immediate success of the republican system.
Revolution became a chronic disease there. Texas separated,
and practically became independent, although Mexico refused to
recognize her separation. After some years, Texas was admitted as
a State into our Federal Union. A war which ensued, resulted not
only in the relinquishment of Mexican claims upon Texas, but in the
extension of her coast-frontier to the Rio Grande, and also in the

<!-- page 472 -->

annexation of New-Mexico and Upper California to the United
States.

Thus, in sixty-five years after the peace of Versailles, the United
States advanced from the Mississippi, and occupied a line stretching
through eighteen degrees of latitude on the Pacific coast, overlooking
the Sandwich Islands and Japan, and confronting China, (the Cathay
for which Columbus was in search when he encountered the bewildering
vision of San Domingo.) The new possession was divided into
two Territories and the State of California. The simultaneous discovery
of native gold in the sands and rocks of that State resulted in
the instantaneous establishment of an active commerce, not only with
our Atlantic cities, but also with the ports of South-America and
with the maritime countries of Europe, with the Sandwich Islands,
and even with China. Thus the United States ceased to be a mere
Atlantic nation, and assumed the attitude of a great Continental
Power, enjoying ocean navigation on either side, and bearing equal
and similar relations to the eastern and to the western coast of the
old world. The natural connections between the Atlantic and the
Pacific regions are yet incomplete; but the same spirit which has
brought them into political union is at work still, and no matter what
the Government may do or may leave undone, the necessary routes
of commerce, altogether within and across our own domain, will be
established.</p>

<p>The number of States has increased, since this aggrandizement
began, from seventeen to thirty-one; the population, from five millions
to twenty-four millions; the tonnage employed in commerce,
from one million to four and a half millions; and the national revenue,
from ten millions to sixty millions of dollars. Within that
period, Spain has retired altogether from the continent, and two
considerable islands in the Antilles are all that remain of the New
World which, hardly four centuries ago, the generous and pious
Genoese navigator, under the patronage of Isabella, gave to the kingdoms
of Castile and Leon. Great Britain tenders us now the freedom
of the fisheries and of the St. Lawrence, on conditions of favor to the
commerce of her colonies, and even deliberates on the policy of
releasing them from their allegiance. The influences of the United

<!-- page 473 -->

States on the American continent have resulted already in the establishment
of the republican system everywhere except in Brazil,
and even there in limiting imperial power. In Europe they have
awakened a war of opinion that, after spreading desolation into the
steppes of Russia and to the base of the Carpathian Mountains, has
only been suppressed for a time by combinations of the capital and of
the political forces of that continent. In Africa those influences, aided
by the benevolent efforts of our citizens, have produced the establishment
of a republic which, beginning with the abolition of the traffic
in slaves, is going steadily on toward the moral regeneration of its
savage races. In the Sandwich Islands those influences have already
effected, not only such a regeneration of the natives, but also a political
organization which is bringing that important commercial station
directly under our protection. Those influences have opened the
ports of Japan, and secured an intercourse of commerce and friendship
with its extraordinary people numbering forty millions thus
overcoming a policy of isolation which they had practised for the
period of an hundred and fifty years. The same influences have not
only procured for us access to the five principal ports of China, but
have also generated a revolution there which promises to bring the
three hundred millions living within that vast empire into the society
of the western nations.</p>

<p>How magnificent is the scene which the rising curtain discloses to
us here! and how sublime the pacific part assigned to us!</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">The</span> Eastern nations sink, their glory ends,
And Empire rises where the sun descends."</p>

</div>

<p>But, restraining the imagination from its desire to follow the influences
of the United States in their future progress through the Manillas
and along the Indian coast, and beyond the Persian Gulf to the far-off,
Mozambique, let us dwell for a moment on the visible results of the
national aggrandizement at home. Wealth has everywhere increased,
and has been equalized with much success in all the States, new as
well as old. Industry has been persevering in opening newly-discovered
resources and bringing forth their treasures, as well as in the
establishment of the productive arts. The Capitol, which at first

<!-- page 474 -->

seemed too pretentious, is extending itself northward and southward
upon its noble terrace, to receive the representatives of new in-coming
States. The departments of executive administration continually
expand under their lofty arches and behind their lengthening colonnades.
The Federal City, so recently ridiculed for its ambitious solitudes,
is extending its broad avenues in all directions, and, under the
hands of native artists, is taking on the graces, as well as the fullness,
of a capital. Where else will you find authority so august as in a
council composed of the representatives of thirty States, attended by
ambassadors from every free city, every republic, and every court in
the civilized world? In near proximity and in intimate connection
with that capital, a metropolis has arisen which gathers, by the agency
of canals, of railroads, and of coast-wise navigation, the products of
industry in every form throughout the North-American States, as
well those under foreign jurisdiction as those which constitute the
Union, and distributes them in exchange over the globe&mdash;a city
whose wealth and credit supply or procure the capital employed in
all the great financial movements within the Republic, and whose
press, in all its departments of science, literature, religion, philanthropy,
and politics is a national one. Thus expansion and aggrandizement,
whose natural tendency is to produce debility and dissolution,
have operated here to create, what before was wanting, a social,
political, and commercial centre.</p>

<p>In considering the causes of this material growth, allowance must
be made liberally for great advantages of space, climate, and
resources, as well as for the weakness of outward resistance, for the
vices of foreign governments, and for the disturbed and painful condition
of society under them&mdash;causes which have created and sustained
a tide of emigration toward the United States unparalleled,
at least in modern times. But when all this allowance shall have
been made, we shall still find that the phenomenon is chiefly due to
the operation here of some great ideas, either unknown before or not
before rendered so effective. These ideas are, first, the equality of
men in a State, that is to say, the equality of men constituting a
State; secondly, the equality of States in combination, or, in other
words, the equality of States constituting a nation. By the Constitution

<!-- page 475 -->

of every State in the American Union, each citizen is guaranteed
his natural rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and
he, at the same time, is guaranteed a share of the sovereign power
equal to that which can be assumed by any other citizen. This is the
equality of men in the State. By the Constitution of the United
States, there are no subjects. Every citizen of any one State is a
free and equal citizen of the United States. Again, by the Constitution
of the United States, there are no provinces, no dependencies.
The Union is constituted by States, and all of them stand upon the
same level of political rights.</p>

<p>The reduction of the two abstractions which I have mentioned into
the concrete, in the Constitutions of the United States, was, like most
other inventions, mainly due to accident. There were thirteen several
States, in each of which, owing to fortunate circumstances attending
their original colonization, each citizen was not only free but also
practically equal, in his exercise of political power, to every other
citizen of that State. The freedom and equality of the citizen, and
the inalienability of his natural rights, were solemnly reaffirmed in the
Declaration of Independence. These thirteen States were severally
free and independent of each other. They therefore were equal
States. Each was a sovereign. They needed free and mutual commerce
among themselves, and some regulations securing to each equal
facilities of commerce with foreign countries. A union was necessary
to the attainment of these ends. But the citizens of each State were
unwilling to surrender either their natural and inalienable rights or
the guardianship of them to a common government over them all,
even to attain the union which they needed so much. So a Federal
Central Government was established, which was sovereign only in
commerce, at home and abroad, and in the communications with other
nations; that is to say, sovereign only in regard to the mutual
internal relations of the States themselves, and in regard to foreign
affairs. In this government the States were practically equal constituents,
although that equality was modified by some limitations found
necessary to secure the assent of some of the States. The States
were not dissolved nor disorganized, but they remained really States,
just as before, existing independently of each other and of the Union,

<!-- page 476 -->

and exercising sovereignty in all the municipal departments of
society. The citizen of each State also retained all his natural rights
equally in the Union and in the State to which he belonged, and the
United States were constituted by the whole mass of such citizens
throughout all the several States. There was an unoccupied common
domain which the several States surrendered to the Federal authorities,
to the end that it might be settled, colonized, and divided into
other States, to be organized and to become members of the Union
on an equal footing with the original States. When additions to this
domain were made from foreign countries, the same principles seemed
to be the only ones upon which the government could be extended
over them, and so, with some qualifications unimportant on the present
occasion, they became universal in their application.</p>

<p>No other nation, pursuing a career of aggrandizement, has adopted
the great ideas thus developed in the United States. The Macedonian
conquered kingdoms for the mere gratification of conquest, and they
threw off the sway he had established over them as soon as the sword
dropped from his hand. The Roman conquered because the alien
was a barbarian rival and enemy, and because Rome must fill the
world alone. The empire, thus extended, fell under the blows of
enemies, subjugated but not subdued, as soon as the central power
had lost its vigor. The Ottoman, although he conquered with the
sword, conciliated the subjected tribes by admitting them to the rites
of a new and attractive religion. The religion, however, was of this
world, and sensual, and therefore it debased its votaries. France
attempted to conquer Europe in retaliation for wrongs committed
against herself, but the bow broke in her hands just as it was bent to
discharge the last shaft. Spain has planted many colonies and conquered
many States, but the Castilian was proud and haughty&mdash;he
enslaved the native and oppressed the Creole. The Czar wins his way
amid kindred races as a parent, extending protection in the enjoyment
of a common religion. But the paternal relation in politics is a
fiction of despotism which extinguishes all individual energy and all
social ambition. Great Britain has been distinguished from all these
vulgar conquerors. She is a civilizer and a missionary. She has
planted many Colonies in the West, and conquered many and vast

<!-- page 477 -->

countries in the East, and has carried English laws and the English
language around the world. But Great Britain at home is an aristocracy.
Her Colonies can neither be equal to her nor yet independent.
Her subjects in those countries may be free, but they can not
be Britons. Consequently, her dependencies are always discontented,
and insomuch as they are possessed or swayed by freemen, they are
only retained in their connection with the British throne by the presence
of military and naval force. You identify an American State or
Colony by the absence of the Federal power. Everywhere, on the
contrary, you identify a British Colony, whether in British America,
or on the Pacific coast, or on its islands, or in Bombay, or in India,
or at St. Helena, or at Gibraltar, or on the Ionian isles, by the music
of the imperial drum-beat and the frown of royal battlements. Great
Britain always inspires fear, and often commands respect, but she has
no friends in the wide family of nations. So it has happened that
heretofore nations have either repelled, or exhausted, or disgusted the
Colonies they planted and the countries they conquered.</p>

<p>The United States, on the contrary, expand by force, not of arms,
but of attraction. The native colonist no sooner reaches a new and
distant home, whether in a cleft of the Rocky Mountains or on the
sea-shore, than he proceeds to found a State in which his natural and
inviolate rights shall be secure, and which shall become an equal
member of the Federal Union, enjoying its protection and sharing its
growing greatness and renown. Adjacent States, though of foreign
habits, religion, and descent, especially if they are defenceless, look
with favor upon the approach of a power that will leave them in the
full enjoyment of the rights of nature, and at the same time that it
may absorb them, will spare their corporate existence and individuality.
The attraction increases as commerce widens the circle of
the national influence.</p>

<p>If these positions seem to require modification at all, the very
modifications will, nevertheless, serve to illustrate and sustain the
general principles involved. The people of Mexico resist annexation
because they fear it would result in their being outnumbered by
Americans, and so lead to the restoration of African slavery, which
they have abolished. The natives of the Sandwich Islands take alarm

<!-- page 478 -->

lest by annexation they may themselves be reduced to slavery. The
people of the Canadas hesitate because they disapprove the modifications
of the principles of equality of men and equality of States in
favor of slaveholding States, which were admitted in the Federal
Constitution.</p>

<p>What is the moral to be drawn from the physical progress of the
United States? It is, that the strongest bonds of cohesion in society
are commerce and gratitude for protected freedom.</p>

    Beneath my window-blind,
And plumes its winnowing wings for one
    It never more may find.
The birdling that you seek, wind,
    In your &AElig;olian play,
Some wandering seraph, stooping, saw,
    And bore to Heaven away.</p>

<p class="stanza">You took your flight, O southern breeze,
    When Summer's sheaves were bent,
And there was sorrowing round my hearth,
    When your sweet joyance went:
But little did I know how much
    Of happiness was left,
Until of that young love of ours
    My sad home was bereft.</p>

<p class="stanza">He went when Autumn's golden light
    The glowing world o'erspread;
And left behind a night of gloom
    And rayless dark instead.
Life was not life to me, unless
    His presence formed a part,
For he was the irradiate light
    And day-spring of my heart.</p>

<p class="stanza">At sound of my familiar step,
    How brightened all his looks;
<!-- page 480 -->Down went the play-things, and away
    Went all his pictured books:
His little hands, like fluttering wings,

And, happy in each other's arms,
    The father clasped his boy.</p>

<p class="stanza">We lived and loved&mdash;a blessed life&mdash;
    As we shall live no more,
For angel-pinions bore him off

The cloud that shut him from my sight

And made my quailing spirit shrink
    Where its dark shadow fell.</p>

<p class="stanza">Blow softly, gently, southern breeze,
    Amind the buds and bloom,
And let your odor-laden airs

And though you gladden other hearts,
    You wring my own the more.</p>

<p class="stanza">I read aright the moaning sigh
    Beneath my window-blind,
It is the loving sprite who seeks

For one whose bright and starry eyes

While Memory fills its vacant halls
    And corridors with him.</p>

<p class="stanza">O <span class="smcap">God</span>! that such a world as this,

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="small">A LITTLE EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS AMBITIOUS OF DISTINCTION: COMPILED
FROM PAPERS WHICH WERE DISCOVERED IN HIS DESK, AFTER HE HAD LEFT HOME
ON A TOUR THROUGH EUROPE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this brief memoir, which must be restricted to
twelve pages of the present volume, was the son of wealthy but honest
parents; at least they had never been convicted of larceny, nor of any
other crime. We mention the fact of their honesty for the reason
that there is a prevalent opinion among a certain class, that in this
country, where wealth is so rarely inherited, it can not be honestly
obtained; honesty and fair dealing not being supposed to be favorable
to large gains. Though the father was engaged in the most
respectable business of importing German dolls and other useful articles,
and was one of the safest men down-town, he had enlarged views
for his son, and determined to give him what he had always felt the
need of himself&mdash;a thorough education; that he might have a capital
to start with, which no adverse circumstances could deprive him
of. Bonds and stocks might prove worthless, banks might fail, and
merchandise depreciate in value; but no changes in the market could
affect Latin and Greek; and with a good stock of these commodities,
the father had no fears for his son. His reasons for attaching so
much importance to these valuable languages, could not have been the
wealth and importance which they have usually conferred upon those
who possessed them in the greatest quantities; but, whatever the reasons
were, they were all-sufficient in his opinion. After leaving college
with the degree of A.B., and as much knowledge as young men usually
take from the halls of learning where they graduate, the subject of

<!-- page 482 -->

our memoir very sensibly took a wife, to aid him in combatting and
overcoming whatever obstacles he might encounter in his way through
the world. Having no leaning toward any particular profession, and
feeling quite indifferent whether he earned his living by preaching the
Gospel, practising medicine, or promoting litigation, provided he could
distinguish himself, he hesitated a long time before he could prevail
upon himself what to do, and perhaps he would never have come
to any decision upon this important point, had not his father intimated
to him, at last, that he should shut off the supplies, unless his
son showed a disposition to do something for himself. Marvin, for
that happened to be his Christian name, suggested to his father
that a year or two spent in Europe might enable him to determine
what profession would be best adapted to the bent of his genius. But
the father did not see the force of the suggestion, whereupon the son
was suddenly illuminated by a brilliant thought, which put an end to
discussion and satisfied all parties. He would start a magazine, and
distinguish himself as Jeffrey, Brougham, Campbell, Sydney Smith,
Kit North, and other illustrious men had done before him, in the same
way, and make lots of money beside. Any of the learned professions
would require years of patient drudgery to gain respectability even,
but here was a plan, now, by which reputation and wealth could be
attained at a bound.</p>

<p>"Where there is a will there is a way," is an excellent maxim
when there is money to back it up, which happened to be the case
in this instance. Paper-makers, printers, binders, and all the operatives
whose aid is necessary to further a literary enterprise, are the
most amiable, obedient, and manageable of slaves, and always hail,
with encouraging cheerfulness, every new attempt to establish a literary
undertaking, when they are sure of their pay. Authors, too,
forget their caprices, suddenly grow industrious and obliging, genius
brightens up, and a thousand friends come forward with manuscripts
and advice, under similar circumstances, and with a similar contingency.
So the subject of this brief history found, and chuckled with
inward delight over the opening glories of his career, as he made his
preparations for issuing his first number. There were drawbacks to
the business, to be sure&mdash;a back side to the canvas, which, it was consoling

<!-- page 483 -->

to him to remember, none would see but himself. He would
become so prominent an object of popular esteem and curiosity, that
he foresaw many annoyances and inconveniences, from being so continually
invited to dine with this and that great man, to be compelled
to attend the <i>d&eacute;jeuners</i> of renowned prima donnas, to join literary
coteries, being bothered for his autograph, and to accept conciliatory
and grateful offerings, from authors, artists, and actors; all these
things, to a gentleman of his quiet and unostentatious habits, would
prove annoying; but he heroically straightened his back for the burthen
which was to descend upon his shoulders, and resolved to take
the bitter with the sweet of his new employment without grumbling.
His consolation and reward would be the consciousness of having elevated
the tone of popular sentiment, of enlarging the bounds of
human enjoyment, and of assisting in the development of American
genius, and rewarding native talent. Very likely other men may
have entertained some such feelings in embarking in similar enterprises,
and they will readily comprehend the emotions of Mr. Smilax,
at this momentous period of his career.</p>

<p>Our twelve pages will not allow us the pleasure of giving the
world an account of the reception of the first number of the magazine,
nor permit us to chronicle the gradual change which took place in the
feelings of its proprietor and editor, as he day by day discovered he
had so wonderfully over-estimated the delights and profits of his
enterprise, and so ridiculously under-estimated its troubles and annoyances.
How could he have so deluded himself! Manuscripts poured
in upon him by the cart-load, and he was required to read every thing
he received, and give a critical opinion upon it the next day. If he
accepted an article, he did not thereby make a grateful friend; but if
he refused one, he created an implacable enemy. Illustrious authors
did not manifest any of that feverish anxiety for his company to dinner
that he had anticipated, unless he acted the part of Amphitryon
himself; and as for his autograph, the only applications he received
for it were from certain gentlemen who were anxious to have it on
the backs of notes, which they wished to part with.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat in the little apartment, which was most
absurdly called his "sanctum," for it was as open to the inroads of

<!-- page 484 -->

impertinent people as an intelligence office, looking over a heap of
manuscripts with aching head and weary eyes, and thinking to himself
that the business of enlarging the boundaries of human enjoyment
was not half so agreeable an occupation as that of importing German
dolls would be, when he was diverted from his desponding thoughts
by the sudden apparition of a lady, accompanied by a small boy, who
carried a large roll under his arm.</p>

<p>"You are the editor, I presume?" said the lady; and, having been
assured of the correctness of her supposition, she seated herself in the
only chair which was vacant in the sanctum&mdash;all the other seats
being filled with bundles of manuscripts, which were waiting to be
returned to their authors, or consigned to the balaam-box. The lady
then lifted her veil, and taking the roll from the boy, pleasantly
informed the dismayed editor, for whom such visitors had long since
lost all novelty, that she wished to occupy a few minutes of his time
in reading a manuscript novel, which she desired his opinion of.</p>

<p>The editor declined the favor she intended him, as courteously as
his temper would permit him to do; but she insisted that he would
be charmed with the work, and she would permit him to publish it
in his magazine. He pointed to the heaps of manuscripts lying all
about him, on the shelves, on the tables, in baskets, on the floor, and
in the chairs, beside two or three green boxes, which were filled full
of accepted articles, waiting their turns to be published, and told her
they had all prior claims, which must first be attended to.</p>

<p>But ladies who have a point to carry are deaf to all arguments
which do not tend to further their purposes, and the strange authoress
only smiled more pleasantly than before, and tossing her ringlets
from her pale cheeks, said, in her persuasive voice, "Allow me to
read you one chapter? I am sure it will interest you."</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the beleaguered editor, "I have no doubt of
it; but what's the use? I could not use the story if it pleased me
never so much. And then I should only feel the greater regret in
being compelled to reject it."</p>

<p>"Ah! now," said the lady, "there is the most delightful character
in it, and a ghost, and a most mysterious personage. It would make
your magazine sell wonderfully. It is just the kind of story which

<!-- page 485 -->

every body says your magazine needs. Let me read you but one
chapter?"</p>

<p>A pitcher of water and a tumbler were standing upon the table,
and the editor, taking up the pitcher, filled the tumbler full.</p>

<p>"There, Madam," said he, "you see that when a vessel is full it
will hold no more; see, another drop and it overflows. I am full,
my room is full, desks, drawers, baskets, boxes, magazine, and all
are full. I can receive no more."</p>

<p>"Just one more will make no great difference, I am sure," said
the authoress, paying no other heed to the forcible illustration of the
editor, than to smile most benignly and patiently while he demonstrated
the simple fact. "Come, let me read my introductory chapter,
and I am sure you will want to read the rest yourself."</p>

<p>"Madam, I have been compelled to deny thousands of such
requests," said he, biting his lips.</p>

<p>"But a lady!" said she. "You might refuse to hear a gentleman,
but you would not refuse a lady?"</p>

<p>The editor paused a moment, and he was ruined. He was naturally
tender-hearted, and he thought of his wife and his mother; what
if either of them should ever be compelled to solicit a favor from an
editor? and how would he feel to hear they had been refused?</p>

<p>"Madam," said he, with a softened tone, "it is quite impossible
for me to hear you read your novel now; but leave it with me, and
I will read it through at my earliest leisure."</p>

<p>"I may depend upon you?" she said half-doubtingly, as she deposited
the roll on his table.</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word as a gentleman," he said.</p>

<p>"I will call again soon," said the lady, who courtsied and smiled,
and then retired, followed by her page.</p>

<p>But she had scarcely left the sanctum when the wretched man, as
he took up the roll of manuscript, and tossed it upon a shelf, where
lay heaps of similar bundles, repented of what he had done.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was!" he exclaimed, as he glanced around him,
"to make that rash promise! There is O'Mulligan, who will challenge
me if I do not read his essay on the Round Towers; there is
the Reverend Doctor Slospoken, who will denounce me to his congregation,

<!-- page 486 -->

if I neglect his essay on Human Responsibilities; Professor
Verdigriss will speak sneeringly of me to his class, if I am not prepared
with an opinion of his article about the Retrocession of Solar
Paradoxes; and Mrs. Winkle's Blighted Buds must be reviewed for
my next number. How am I to do all these things, and read that
woman's tremendous manuscript! I was a madman to make such a
promise! The deuce take her! But I will not be so caught again."</p>

<p>He gave strict orders that no woman, under any circumstances
whatever, should ever again be permitted to enter his sanctum; and
after spending a few more hours at his dreary employment, he went
home to his wife, solacing himself with the recollection of his domestic
happiness, and repeating to himself a quatrain from some verses
which he had addressed to his Maria Jane before their marriage:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"<span class="smcap">Maria</span>, on thy peaceful breast
The weary worker seeks repose,
And in thy fond affections blest
He finds a cure for all his woes."</p>

</div>

<p>"A cure for all his woes!" he repeated to himself, as he put his
night-key in the door, and bounding up-stairs into the boudoir of his
Maria, was suddenly arrested by discovering her in tears.</p>

<p>Maria Jane in tears! The heart of Smilax was smitten by the
sight, and his anxiety to learn the cause of her first sorrow may
readily be imagined by husbands who have had a similar experience&mdash;and
what husband has not?</p>

<p>But he then learned that when a wife is most afflicted, there is
nothing the matter with her. Mrs. Smilax continued to weep, and
at every appeal of her husband, to enlighten him as to the cause of
her grief, she would only reply, "Nothing!"</p>

<p>But Smilax knew perfectly well that "nothing," in this case, meant
something dire and calamitous to his domestic peace. After a while,
the torrent of his wife's grief subsided into a sullen and reproachful
melancholy, more hard to endure than the most terrifying outbursts
of grief and passion.</p>

<p>Maria Jane was not one of the Queen Catharine style of wives;
she calmly subsided into the injured innocence state, and personated

<!-- page 487 -->

most effectively the character of a resigned saint, persevering in
her sad declaration that nothing had happened&mdash;nothing! She had
no complaints to make. It would all be over soon; and what was
her happiness, if he were only happy!</p>

<p>Smilax went to his office the next day, a thoroughly wretched
man; but his duties were too engrossing to permit him to dwell on
his domestic troubles. He had tried in vain to imagine the cause of
his wife's griefs, but he could not call to mind any circumstance
which could, in any manner, have awakened her jealousy, or given
her reason to shed a tear. What added to his distress was his
inability to consult with any of his friends in regard to the matter, or
ask advice as to the proper mode of procedure in such cases. The
spirit of discontent had entered his paradise, and he was unhappy,
and that was all he knew about it.</p>

<p>The mail had brought him heaps of letters and manuscripts, all
of them requiring immediate attention; the printer had sent him
bundles of proofs, which must be read and returned at once; and
O'Mulligan had threatened him with a scorching, in a rival magazine,
for not deciding on his manuscript sooner; and two clergymen, a
lady, a Polish lecturer, and half-a-dozen suspicious-looking men of a
very miscellaneous character, were waiting in his ante-room, some to
learn his decision in regard to communications already sent, and
some to offer him essays and poems. It was a melting hot day; all
the rest of the world had gone to the country or the sea-side; but he
was forced to remain to make up his next number. The perspiration
rolled from his clouded brow, as he seated himself at his overburdened
desk, and thought of his duties. With a kind of grim desperation, he
took up the roll of manuscript which the lady had left him the day
before, and smiled scornfully, as he read the title, "A Pledge of
Affection. By Pattie Passionflower."</p>

<p>"Another vegetable name in literature!" he said to himself; "Poppyflower
would be better. I thought, when I received a poem from
Carry Cauliflower, that that particular form of literary disease had
come to an end; but here is another." He ran his eye rapidly over
a few leaves of the manuscript&mdash;for he had learned the art of judging
of the character of a literary performance without reading it all

<!-- page 488 -->

through&mdash;and remorselessly writing a mystical word upon it, tied
up the bundle and threw it into the balaam-box, with a large heap of
other rejected offerings to be returned to their owners.</p>

<p>This was, at first, a most painful thing for him to do; for he had himself
once been a contributor to a magazine, and he well knew the irritating
anxiety which a young author feels for the fate of his manuscript;
and he used to write soothing letters to the poor adventurers whose
bantlings he was compelled to reject; but he had long since become
hardened to his duty, and rather felt himself the aggrieved and injured
party, when a manuscript was offered to him, which, after being at the
cost of reading, he was compelled to reject. "It is not my fault,"
would Smilax say to himself; "if they can't write better; why should
I be unhappy about it?"</p>

<p>Ah! little did the public think or care, that, to obtain the one
tolerably good essay, which they would find fault with for not being
more brilliant, he had been obliged to read through four or five hundred
much worse ones. "What does the world care about the troubles
or sufferings of any of its servants, who wear their lives out in
trying to give pleasure or instruction to others? Not a straw! Yet we
will be martyrs for the chance smile of approbation which the world
now and then bestows upon us&mdash;slaves of its whims," said Smilax
to himself, as he wended his way home that night, wearied with
his day's work, and half-dreading to meet Maria Jane. The truth
was that she had neglected to give him the customary parting
kiss, which she had never forgotten to do before. "Forgotten!"
exclaimed Smilax bitterly in his thoughts; "she did not forget it
she did it on purpose; she had her handkerchief to her eyes, and she
would not allow me to kiss her. I have broken my wife's heart; but
how I did it I have not the ghost of an idea. I hope she has got over
it by this time, though."</p>

<p>But the faint hope was soon withered; for, as he opened the door,
he heard a stifled sobbing, which he knew at once proceeded from
Maria Jane; and worse and more ominous than all, the severe visage
of his mother-in-law frowned freezingly upon him, as he entered the
room where the wife of his young affections lay sobbing hysterically
upon the sofa. Maria Jane had sent for her mother, and Smilax

<!-- page 489 -->

knew that <i>she</i> would not say that "nothing was the matter," for that
is not the way in which mothers-in-law vent their reproaches. It was
a comfort to the distressed husband and editor to feel sure that he
would now know the worst, let it be what it might. And he was
perfectly correct in his assumptions; for, as he mildly asked what
was the matter, the word "Monster!" fell upon his ear with a clearness
and distinctness of utterance that made him hop.</p>

<p>"Do n't, mother!" sobbed out Maria Jane; "I can die, but I will
never reproach him."</p>

<p>What Smilax would have said, or might have said, if he had not
been rendered speechless by the strangeness of these proceedings, we
must leave the public to imagine.</p>

<p>"I do n't wonder at your silence," said his mother-in-law. "You
have killed this suffering angel, and made me childless."</p>

<p>Maria Jane, we may observe, was an only daughter, from which
the tender manner of her bringing up may be inferred.</p>

<p>"If I have killed her," said Smilax, meekly, "I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't bear hypocrisy," said his mother in-law; "I should think
much better of you if you confessed your villainy openly. Read that
letter, and save yourself the trouble of further dissimulation."</p>

<p>As the word "letter" was named, the suffering angel on the sofa
broke out in a fresh agony of hysterical sobs.</p>

<p>Smilax took the letter, and with a puzzled expression examined
the direction, which was to his wife; the hand had a very familiar
look to him; but, accustomed as he was to examining so many specimens
of handwriting daily, he had but a confused idea of its individual
character. He opened the letter with a trembling hand, and had read
but a few lines when, to the horror of his mother-in-law, he broke out
in a fit of the most obstreperous mirth. Unable to restrain his
laughter, he threw himself upon the floor and fairly roared, holding
on to his sides with both hands, and kicking his heels as though he
were in convulsions.</p>

<p>Maria Jane started up wildly, and her mother tried to look very
indignant, but felt that she must look very foolish. She knew she
had made a mistake; and to be compelled to confess it to her son-in-law,
in whose eyes she had ever striven to appear immaculate, and

<!-- page 490 -->

not liable to any mistakes whatever, was enough to make her feel and
look very foolish.</p>

<p>It was a good while before Smilax could command himself long
enough to speak, but the moment he did, his wife leaped from the
sofa, threw her arms around his neck, and, if there had been a piano
in the room, she would have gone off with "<i>Ah! non giunge!</i>" in a
manner that any prima donna might have envied.</p>

<p>To save the trouble of an explanation, we will give our readers a
copy of the letter which caused this domestic <i>emeute</i>, and leave it to
their own imaginations to do the rest.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span></p>

<p>"Though a stranger to you, I am not to your husband; and I do
not flatter myself that he would confide to you the kind of transactions
which such as I have with him; and I would not now intrude
upon you, were it not for the <i>peculiar circumstances</i> in which I am
placed. I am a <i>mother;</i> I believe that <i>you</i> are <i>not</i>, and <i>you</i> may not
understand <i>my</i> feelings. But my offspring must be provided for. I
am not mercenary, yet I can not afford to part with the 'Pledge of
Affection' which I left with him yesterday, without pay. This I wish
you to say to him. After a long and <i>most satisfactory</i> interview
which I had with him, when I returned to say this much, and 'nothing
more,' I was denied all access to him, and have ventured to request
you to act as my mediator with him. If my <i>presence is disagreeable</i>
to him, he has my address, and may drop me a line informing me of
his decision. The 'Pledge' may be sent back if he declines to pay.</p>

<p class="right">"Most truly yours,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Pattie Passionflower</span>.</p>

<p class="small">"<span class="smcap">To Mrs. Smilax</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>This little affair proved the straw which broke the camel's back.
Smilax concluded the next morning that his martyrdom in the cause
of literature had been endured long enough. The delusive idea of
distinguishing himself by acting as a monthly nurse to other people's
literary bantlings, and of elevating popular taste by any such means,
was entirely dissipated. He sold out to some body as deluded as he

<!-- page 491 -->

had been; and soon after, the following advertisement in the morning
papers told the catastrophe of his literary career, and the total eclipse
of all his ambitious aspirations for distinction:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Partnership Notice</span>.&mdash;Mr. M. Smilax. Jr., having been admitted
a partner of our house, the business of importing German
dolls will be conducted under the name of M. Smilax, Son &amp; Co.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Smilax &amp; Co</span>."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"After all," said Smilax to me, one day, as I met him coming out
of his broker's, where he had been looking over the stock list, with
the view of making a safe investment of his spare capital, "what a
precious delusion this love of distinction is! What more should sensible
men like ourselves aspire to, than to be distinguished in their
own families as good husbands and fathers, and to have the satisfaction
of knowing they owe no man a dollar, which they can not pay on
demand? That's the only distinction worth striving for."</p>

<p>I am afraid there was a shade of sarcasm in the smile which passed
over my features in reply to these grovelling sentiments of my friend;
for he immediately added with a slight blush:</p>

<p>"It is true that importing German dolls is not the noblest occupation
in which a reasoning creature can engage; but children must be
amused with dolls, as well as men with magazines, and why not
choose the business which affords the best returns?"</p>

<p>I could only smile again, for arguments of this nature have but one
side to them; and Smilax, feeling his triumph, changed the subject by
inviting me to a family dinner, with Maria Jane and the children.</p>

<p>A LEGEND OF DOSORIS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY J. T. IRVING.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Not</span> far from the great throbbing city of New-York, and on the
borders of a beautifully indented bay, called Hempstead Harbor, there
stood about half-a-century since, a little sleepy town, named Mosquito
Cove, which, being very materially protected from invasion by its
name, was a kind of terra incognita to the rest of the world. In its
immediate neighborhood were the villages of Wolver Hollow, Cedar
Swamp, Duck Pond, Buckram, and Matinicock&mdash;all sturdy towns
of great repute among their own inhabitants, and of strong tenacity
of name; for, although Mosquito Cove in after-times became Glen
Cove, the others still vaunted their ancient titles with vain-glorious
obstinacy. Not far from Mosquito Cove was a retired road, about a
mile in length, in some parts running through open woodland, and in
others so completely embowered in trees, that twilight reigned there
even at mid-day. There was a dreamy stillness about the place,
which was apt to conjure up odd fancies in the mind of the loiterer,
and he might have fancied himself in some old abbey, as he looked
among the columned tree-trunks and the green arches overhead,
until startled from his reverie by the shrill cry of the blue jay, or
the workmanlike tap of the wood-pecker, as he scrambled around a
tree-trunk. Here and there a ray of sunlight, straggling through the
overhanging branches, or the matted grape-vines which clambered
over them, would stream across the road, or lie in golden flecks upon
the dead leaves which strewed the ground.</p>

<!-- page 494 -->

<p>Such at that time was Dosoris lane; and, even at the present day,
it retains much of its primitive character. The tide of travel, which
has found its way to these regions, filling them with the hum of life,
seems, in a great measure, to have spared this lane. In earlier times,
however, quiet and dream-like as it seemed in the day-time, no spot
was more astir than this after night-fall. Elves and spirits, and goblins
of all denominations, made it their haunt, and tales of unearthly
doings, which had taken place there were rife through the country
round. At one time the ghost of a hard-drinking miller was seen
galloping up and down the lane, astride of a huge demijohn, which
he was spurring like a fiery charger&mdash;no doubt, a retaliation
for the spur which it had so often applied to him in his life-time&mdash;always
disappearing at a great oak-tree, at the foot of which
he had drank himself to death, and which, in commemoration
of that event, is called the drinking-tree to this day. At another
time, the ghost of one Billy Cowles, who had died long before of
asthma, and was buried in a small graveyard at the head of the
lane, was seen patrolling the place. It was generally rumored that
he was in search of breath, as he wheezed as he hurried along, and
was always seen with his coat open, his shirt-collar thrown back, and
an old cravat in his hand. These, and a number of other characters
of the same kidney, made this vicinity their rendezvous, and many a
weird prank and gambol were carried on there, until the place gained
an evil name; wayfarers began to take a wide circuit to avoid its
fated neighborhood; the grass began to grow in its wagon-track, and
bold, indeed, was he who would venture to brave its perils after
night-fall.</p>

<p>Just about this time, the place fell under the domination of one
Parson Woolsey, a stern old clergyman and a large landholder, who
looked narrowly after his own interests, and kept the whole country
round in wholesome subjection. Neither ghost nor man was permitted
to cross his path; loud prayer exorcised the former, and a strong
arm, a long purse, and a rigid determination to enforce his own
rights, kept the latter in his place.</p>

<p>The resolute old clergyman carried matters with a high hand until
he died. He was buried under the shade of his own forests, where

<!-- page 495 -->

his grave-stone still stands, half-eaten away by time, and over-run by
weeds and briars, with a figure of the sturdy parson in full canonicals
carved on the top, scowling from the midst of a bag wig, and apparently
keeping a grim watch over the precincts.</p>

<p>After his death, his lands passed into the hands of a more degenerate
race, and once more the powers of the air were rampant.</p>

<p>Not a great while after this, there dwelt in this neighborhood a
person of no small repute, named Zadoc Town. He had come there
a few years previous, from parts unknown. He was a thin, keen
man, with sharp features, and a pair of restless black eyes, placed so
close to his nose, that they seemed intended to look straight forward,
and in no other direction. Mosquito Cove had been a quiet place
enough before his arrival, dozing away under the weight of its own
antiquity, believing in nothing, and looking upon all greatness as
departed from the earth when Parson Woolsey was buried, and somewhat
disposed to think, as all shrewd towns are apt to do, that what
Mosquito Cove did not know was not worth knowing, and what Mosquito
Cove did not possess was not worth possessing, unless it might
be the money of other people. But when Zadoc came, he stirred
them up, he removed the veil from their eyes, and soon had the town
in a turmoil. He took up his abode on a narrow by-road, at a short
distance from the village, in a precise-looking house with green shutters,
in which two holes were cut like eyes, giving the house as keen
and wide-awake a look as its owner.</p>

<p>Here he dwelt under the shadow of two poplar-trees, and of a
sister as keen and straight-forward in aspect as himself, and for whose
energetic spirit and sharp tongue, it was said, he had a very wary
deference. Be that as it may, any restraint that he suffered at home
only rendered him more restless abroad. He was here and there, up
to his eyes in every man's matters, except his own. He called public
meetings; he demonstrated to them the size of the world outside of
the village; he denounced Quakerdom, then the prevailing epidemic
of the place; he talked of establishing schools, newspapers, periodicals,
and banks. He failed in all! but succeeded in forming a fire-insurance
company, of which he was the president, and had all the
honor, while a tight-fisted old former was made treasurer, and kept

<!-- page 496 -->

the funds in a stone pot, buried in his cellar, whence he dug them up
and counted them every night, after saying his prayers, and just before
going to bed.</p>

<p>It chanced that shortly after Zadoc had been installed in his new
office, that he had been passing an afternoon with an old friend named
Tommy Croft, who lived at Buckram. Tommy was a sturdy, weather-beaten
veteran, resembling, in strength and toughness, one of the
oaks of his own woods. In his youth he had been a double-jointed,
hard-fisted fellow, who could cudgel it with any man of his inches.
He was noted for believing in no law but what he carried in his own
arm, and for doubting every one's opinion but his own; and, although
a Quaker, and, of course, a hater of broils, it was whispered that he
and his cudgel were sometimes at variance, and that his cudgel did not
always carry out the precepts which he advocated. Be that as it
may, he was a favorite with all; for he was frank, open-hearted, and
never stubborn, except when he could not have his own way; and as
Zadoc, though restless and persevering, was pliant, there was no collision
between them&mdash;they were fast friends.</p>

<p>As I said before, Zadoc had been passing the afternoon with his
friend, and, being tempted by Tommy's home-brewed ale, to linger
longer than was his wont, the two sat gossiping at the door of the
house, until the setting sun warned Zadoc that it was time to turn his
face homeward. So, taking his leave, he set out, and Tommy, with
his cudgel under his arm, accompanied him several miles on his way.
But at last the darkness, which increased as they went, rendering the
road obscure, indicated to him that it was time to return, and bidding
Zadoc "<span class="smcap">God</span> speed!" he left him just as he was approaching the perilous
regions of Dosoris.</p>

<p>Zadoc was pot-valiant just then; for at least a quart of Tommy's
ale was buttoned under his jacket, distending his stomach and humming
through his head, until he felt himself a match for the largest
ghost that had ever made Dosoris its haunt.</p>

<p>The principal scourge of this lane, of late years, had been the apparition
of one Derrick Wilkinson, a hard-riding horse-jockey, who had
broken his neck about twenty years before, and was said to patrol
the lane from one end to the other, and even to waylay wayfarers,

<!-- page 497 -->

and at times to cudgel them soundly, and at others to lead them into
all sorts of wild adventures.</p>

<p>Among others, there was a tale current of his having beset a
hard-headed old negro, named Knot, as he was reeling homeward
from a husking frolic, somewhat the worse for his potations, and had
led him a helter-skelter chase, all night long, through bush and brier;
at one time dragging him through the swamp at the head of a small
stream called Flag Brook, and at another, ducking him in the Dosoris
mill-pond, paying no regard to his entreaties for rest, but, as he
became weary, plying him with a fiery liquor of such potency as to
keep up his strength and courage, and make him as reckless as the
goblin himself; and that the negro had been banged about in this
rakehelly manner until the distant crow of a cock gave warning of the
approach of day. The ghost then dashed at a tremendous rate into
the fastnesses of Boggy Swamp, and, with a loud yell, disappeared,
not forgetting to bestow a hearty thwack on the head of Knot, which
left him senseless.</p>

<p>The story was laughed at by the young and incredulous; but the
older inhabitants, who had grown gray and wise with their years,
placed implicit faith in the tale. They had lived long in the world,
and had amassed a great fund of experience; and the most of them
recollected that when they were boys, ghosts and hobgoblins were
plenty. Moreover, it was certain that Knot was found on the morning
after the adventure, lying at the foot of a large tree in Boggy
Swamp, very drunk no doubt, from the effects of the miraculous
liquor, and very much stupefied doubtless, from the effects of the
blow.</p>

<p>From this time, Knot became a standard authority on all subjects
relating to the unseen world. From that date, too, Dosoris became
more of a wizard lane than ever.</p>

<p>Zadoc Town had been one of Knot's most virulent opponents, and
had once or twice, in broad daylight, and under the wing of his sister,
openly avowed his utter disbelief of the whole story, and had even
said, that he would like to catch Derrick stopping him, "that
was all!"</p>

<p>Returning Tommy's salutation in a tone as valiant as his own, he

<!-- page 498 -->

strode boldly into the lane. It was not long, however, before the
fumes of the ale began to evaporate, and as they disappeared, certain
vague apprehensions took the place of the false courage which had so
far supported him. All the tales which he had heard came crowding
into his mind. He remembered, too, his own vaporings about ghosts
and hobgoblins, and particularly about Derrick, and was not a little
cowed at the recollection of the rash courage which he had showed in
daylight. He kept a stealthy watch on the dim hedges at the road
side, and, several times, fancied that he saw a dusky figure flitting
before him, but it always proved to be a bush or a rock. There
was no sound to break the echo of his own footfall, except the creaking
noise of the thousand insects which darkness had awakened into
life. He cleared his throat loudly, and looked up toward the sky, but
the interlaced branches shut out the stars, and overhead it looked as
black as midnight. The sides of the road, too, were completely shut
in by trees over-run by scrambling vines. He began to doubt whether
it would not be better to retrace his steps, and spend the night under
the hospitable roof of Tommy Croft; but he recollected the shrill-tongued
sister at home, who had set her face against vagabondizing
and rantipoling of all kinds, under both of which heads she particularly
classed all indulgences which conduced to irregularity or lateness of
hours. Zadoc thought of this. If he braved the dark lane, he might
escape its perils; if he did not, a warm reception at home was certain.
"Egad!" thought he, "if I but had Betsey Town here to back
me, I'd like to see Derrick tackle <i>her!</i> He'd catch a Tartar!"</p>

<p>Had he been elsewhere, he would have chuckled at the idea of
such an encounter; but it was no time nor place for laughing, for he
was at the very spot where the ghost was said to make its appearance,
and he was debating in his mind as to the propriety of taking to his
heels when he was arrested by a voice at the road-side calling out,
"Mr. Town, I'm waiting for you!"</p>

<p>Zadoc's knees shook under him, but before he could rouse himself
he was jerked off his feet, and whisked over the fence by a power
which he could not resist.</p>

<p>"Follow!" said the voice.</p>

<p>Zadoc saw, in front of him, the dim outline of a figure gliding

<!-- page 499 -->

swiftly through bush and brier, stopping at no impediment, and also
felt himself impelled to follow. As they glided along through an
opening in the wood, he obtained a better view of his guide, and, to
his horror, recognized the small jockey-cap, the lank, straight hair,
and gray, glittering eyes of Derrick Wilkinson.</p>

<p>The cold perspiration stood on his forehead, and his terror was
not a little increased by hearing a heavy step following them. He
cast a stealthy glance over his shoulder, and caught a glimpse of a
figure as far behind as the other was before him. All hope of retreat
was cut off, and muttering a kind of rambling prayer, Zadoc followed
the spectre until they came to a large tree at the head of Flag Brook.
Here the ghost stopped, and turning short round, glided up to Zadoc,
and said, in a very respectful tone:</p>

<p>"Mr. Town, in starlight and storm, many a weary night I've
waited for you. I'm Derrick Wilkinson! Be seated, Sir!"</p>

<p>This confirmation of his previous knowledge was by no means
consolatory. Derrick had always been a harum-scarum dare-devil
during his life-time, and Zadoc had strong misgivings that death might
not have improved his character. He recollected, too, Knot's adventure,
and his heart died within him. He, however, slid to the ground,
as directed, and at the same time attempted to express some satisfaction
at the desire evinced for his acquaintance, but the words stuck in
his throat, and he could only move his lips without speaking.</p>

<p>"I'm told you've got up in the world since I left it," said Derrick,
by way of opening the conversation, and of putting his companion
at his ease.</p>

<p>Zadoc was wary, and as he did not understand the purport of the
remark, he made a very non-committal answer.</p>

<p>"You've been a very busy man in the village," said the apparition;
"you've made great changes."</p>

<p>"I've tried to do my duty," replied Zadoc, deprecatingly, at the
same time endeavoring to change his position in such a way as to
catch sight of the other figure, which had followed at his heels, and
which he now observed under a tree close by, apparently ready to
back his fellow-goblin in any unearthly project which he might have
on foot.</p>

<!-- page 500 -->

<p>"You <i>have</i>, Mr. Town; and I honor you for it," replied Goblin
with strong emphasis. "I take a strong interest in the Cove, even
yet. There were the Cowles, and the Crofts, and the Dyhers, and
the Blarcoms, and the Smiths, and the Howlets, and dozens of others:
they were rare boys in my day."</p>

<p>"They are all dead and gone," said Zadoc, as, beginning to feel
less nervous, he grew more loquacious.</p>

<p>"I see most of them every day," replied Goblin; "one or two of
them have gone elsewhere, but I meet nearly all of them constantly:
in fact, they sent me to see you."</p>

<p>Zadoc's hair began to bristle, for he had not imagined that this
visitation was a concerted project of all the defunct worthies of the
town. He made no reply, but sat with every sense on the alert;
for he observed the attendant goblin drawing still nearer, and was
apprehensive lest he might represent another of the departed worthies.</p>

<p>"Rumors of the great good that you have done have reached even
us," continued the ghost in a tone which was intended to be insinuating,
but which, owing to the flimsy texture of its owner, was rather
asthmatic.</p>

<p>Zadoc remained taciturn.</p>

<p>"We've heard, among other things, that you've formed a company
to insure against fire. A fire is a dreadful calamity, Mr.
Town."</p>

<p>"Very!" replied Zadoc.</p>

<p>"Fires are very prevalent where we are," said the ghost; "in
fact, they are the greatest drawback to the place. We all suffer
from them."</p>

<p>Zadoc moved uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>"I think you insure against fire, Mr. Town, do n't you?"</p>

<p>For a brief moment he felt that he was president of the insurance
company, and that here was a chance of turning an honest penny.
He replied in the affirmative with some alacrity, and began to recapitulate
the terms.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Mr. Town," said the goblin, assuming a winning
tone, and endeavoring to coax up a smile on his sinister features,
"you could insure us?"</p>

<!-- page 501 -->

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, me," replied the goblin, "and your other friends."</p>

<p>"Against what?" inquired Zadoc.</p>

<p>"Fire. It's very warm where we live," replied he; "and I've
leave of absence till cock-crow. We thought if we could get insured
during the night, we would snap our fingers when I go back. We
do n't mind money, and it would be a praiseworthy act on your part
to out-wit 'Old Scratch.' It tells greatly in a man's favor to annoy
the old gentleman, and that <i>would</i>, I can assure you. I know him
well."</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma, and Zadoc felt that his present position
required adroit management.</p>

<p>"You do n't mean to say," said he, evasively, "that all those very
respectable people&mdash;<i>very</i> respectable people&mdash;have gone to the
dev&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whist!" said the goblin, "do n't be uncivil, Sir. Wherever
they are, I mean to say that the climate does n't agree with them&mdash;being
rather too tropical. I mean, too, that they want to be insured
against <i>fire</i>. Do I make myself understood?"</p>

<p>There was something too positive to permit of farther equivocation.
Zadoc muttered something about his being unable to insure
out of the county without consulting the stockholders, and that he
feared the risk was "extra hazardous."</p>

<p>The goblin's eyes fairly glowed with fury as he said, "Refuse, if
you dare! <i>You</i> are mine till cock-crow! Will you insure?"</p>

<p>Zadoc closed his eyes, and muttered a prayer. The idea of getting
the ill-will of the "Old Boy" by interfering between him and his
property was not to be thought of for an instant, and he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the goblin, gnashing his teeth, "then here's at
you!"</p>

<p>"And here's at thee!" exclaimed a voice behind him. "Ghost or
devil, take <i>that!</i>" At the same time, a heavy cudgel was flourished
in the air; it descended on what appeared to be the very head of the
goblin, and cleaving through head and body, rang hard against the
ground. There was a bright flash, a puff of sulphurous smoke, a loud

<!-- page 502 -->

discordant scream in the tree-tops, and Zadoc found himself alone in
the presence of his deliverer, Tommy Croft.</p>

<p>"Thee was hard bested, Zadoc," said Tommy, "and thee was
wrong in saying goblins were ag'in natur, but thee withstood that fellow
as thee should. I'm very sorry, however, to hear that so many
of our respected friends have got into such unpleasant quarters. Thee
won't laugh at old Knot again. It's very sartain I never saw so
unsubstantial a thing as that goblin; the stick went clean through
him, as if he was smoke. Pah! he smells like burnt gunpowder.
Come, Zadoc, let's be moving."</p>

<p>Taking Zadoc under one arm, and his trusty cudgel under the
other, Tommy tramped through the woods and across the fields; nor
did he relinquish the guardianship of his friend until he had seen him
fairly housed beneath his own roof, and under the vinegar eye of Sister
Betsey, where he felt certain that neither hobgoblin, nor Old Nick
himself, would be hardy enough to disturb him.</p>

Have watched, and cheered thee on thy way
    O'er Duty's chosen path severe,
And seen thee, heart and thought full grown,
Tread manhood's thorns and tempters down.
    And win, like Pythian charioteer,
The wreaths and race-cups of renown&mdash;
Seen thee, thy name and deeds, enshrined
Within the peerage-book of mind&mdash;
And seen my morning prophecy
Truth-blazoned on a noon-day sky,
That he, whose worth could win a wife
    Lovely as thine, at Life's beginning,
Would always wield the power, through life,
    Of winning all things worth the winning.</p>

<p class="stanza">Hark! there are songs on Summer's breeze,
And dance and song in Summer's trees,
And choruses of birds and bees
    In Air, their world of happy wings;
What far-off minstrelsy, whose tone
And words are sweeter than their own,
    Has waked these cordial welcomings?
'Tis nearer now, and now more near,
And now rings out like clarion clear.
They come&mdash;the merry bells of Fame!
They come&mdash;to glad me with thy name.
<!-- page 505 -->And, borne upon their music's sea,
From wave to wave, melodiously,
Glad tidings bring of thine and thee.
They tell me that, Life's tasks well done,
Ere shadows mark thy westering sun,
Thy Bark has reached a quiet shore,
And rests, with slumbering sail and oar,
Fast anchored near a Cottage door,
    Thy home of pleasantness and peace.
Of Love, with eyes of Heaven's blue,
And Health, with cheek of rose's hue,
    And Riches, with "the Golden Fleece:"
Where she, the Bride, a Mother now,
    Encircled round with sons and daughters,
Waits my congratulary bow
    To greet her Cottage woods and waters;
And thou art proving, as in youth,
By daily kindnesses, the truth
And wisdom of the Scottish rhyme&mdash;
To make a happy fireside clime
    For children and for wife,
Is the true pathos and sublime,"
    And green and gold of Life.</p>

<p class="stanza">From long-neglected garden-bowers
    Come these, my songs' memorial flowers,
With greetings from my heart, they come
To seek the shelter of thy home;
Though faint their hues, and brief their bloom,
And all unmeet for gorgeous room
Of "honor, love, obedience,
    "And troops of friends," like thine,
I hope thou wilt not banish thence
    These few and fading flowers of mine,
But let their theme be their defense,
The love, the joy, the frankincense,
    And fragrance o' <span class="smcap">Lang Syne</span>.</p>
