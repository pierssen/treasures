<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> long felt that there was a remedy for the
present unbalanced condition of society in the sphere
of wealth; one which would release the masses from
the pressure upon them that so often ends in crime,&mdash;crime 
that is more the result of circumstances,
than of any criminal intention on the part of the
individual.</p>

<p>I felt that this remedy would secure to the individual 
his selfhood, and, at the same time, give his
individuality its proper social balance; such balance
as would not, could not, result in injustice to any.</p>

<p>I sensed the fact that such a remedy existed; but
I could not formulate it, could not discover the
underlying principle, by means of which it could be
demonstrated and made applicable.</p>

<p>I saw the efforts that were being made by the various
labor-combinations,&mdash;the Grangers, Sovereigns of
Industry, &amp;c.,&mdash;but I could not work with them, for
they seemed to me but the ineffectual struggles of
guess-work; like striking out in the dark against an
enemy that is too subtle for us. It was only combining 
competition into classes, and arraying them

<!-- page 4 -->

the more completely, the one against another; it did
not touch the root of the evil.</p>

<p>I listened to the talk of "gold basis," on one side,
and "legal tender, with expansion of currency," on
the other; of "tariff" and "no tariff," and to the
countless other propositions that came up; and they
all seemed equally futile. All were in the sphere of
effects: not one touched upon causes.</p>

<p>Suffrage for woman I believed was a legitimate
right; and yet I had come to see that even a right
may be exercised under such false conditions as to
render it a curse. So I watched and waited, sensed
what I could not see, felt that it existed, and yet
did not try to find it, did not wander in search, when
each step would have been a step in the dark. I
worked faithfully in those fields of thought in which
I could see light, and waited for the opening door to
this.</p>

<p>I realized that nothing less than a national movement&mdash;something 
that would include the whole
people&mdash;could be of any avail. At length I met the
unpretending man who is the author of the following
treatise upon Economic Science.</p>

<p>Uneducated in the learning of the schools, but
with a soul attuned to nature's laws, he was able to
study the working of society free from the prejudice
of preconceived opinions. His conclusions, slowly
arrived at, I am satisfied are correct. I am satisfied
that he has found the true cause of our trouble,
has found the law by means of which the products
of labor are centralized in the hands of the few, to
the injury of the many.</p>

<!-- page 5 -->

<p>And I am also satisfied that he has found the true
remedy. I am aware that each proposition needs
elaboration; that there is enough subject matter in
the following pages for volumes; for, like mathematical 
laws, they cover every possible case. But
the elaboration will come in time.</p>

<p>I am well aware, also, that we shall meet with
opposition in the propagation of said principles; for,
people have so long recognized assumed rights as
legitimate ones, it will take time to show them the
difference. But, seeing therein the remedy for
existing evils, we shall not fear to press them.</p>

<p>True, the change proposed is very great, but not
so great as will be the ruin of this mighty Republic,
unless something can be done to remove the power
accruing to individuals and to corporations, through
the immense wealth that they gain control of at the
expense of the people.</p>

<p>It has been well said, that corporations are soulless. 
Corporate companies pay no attention to the
needs of the people; nor will they, till they become
representative of the people.</p>

<p>Six years ago I purchased a railroad ticket from
Boston to Chicago for twenty-one dollars: now I
cannot purchase one for less than twenty-five.</p>

<p>The country to-day is depressed far beyond what
it was then; the general pay to railroad employees
is less: why, then, this extra four dollars upon every
passenger who travels that distance? It costs no
more to send a letter through the mail; and why
should it to ride in a rail-car? The profits arising
from railroad enterprise go into the pockets of individuals; 

<!-- page 6 -->

they control public necessity in this direction; 
and they, with other rich monopolies, control 
and corrupt government. And, as Mr. Densmore 
says, there is no remedy for this state of things,
only through revolution, or through the method he
indicates. To me, his conclusion is axiomatic.</p>

<p>If the working people will use the ballot wisely,
they may bring the remedy through the legitimate
channel; and, to avoid too great a shock in the change
that must come, it were well to secure the surrender
of individual control over collective fields of interest
gradually; while the collective interests of the town
or county need not be more directly under the control 
of the State than is the election of town and
county officers now.</p>

<p>The principle is simple, and may be made easy of
application, if the people will keep cool, while persistently 
determined to establish conditions of justice
in the sphere of wealth; keeping in mind, the while,
that the change is to be sought for the good of the
whole people, rich as well as poor; for in it I see the
only possible method by means of which we can prevent 
such a conflict between capital and labor in the
near future as will bring the horrors of the French
Revolution upon us; from which "May Heaven save
us!" is the prayer of</p>

<p class="small">Why does Wealth centralize?&mdash;A Knowledge of Sociology
needed&mdash;This Science in a Chaotic Condition&mdash;The Powers
that govern Man's Will&mdash;Education upon other Subjects can
not bring Balance to the Sphere of Wealth&mdash;Man's Aversion

Sphere of the Individual and of the Collective Will, &amp;c.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> being able to reach the summit of Nature's
observatory, from whence conclusions can be reached
free from the prejudices of previous ideas, and every
question of human interest truly answered, I can
only present the views contained in this essay, as my
opinion as to the true reply to the question so often
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>How is it in this new country, which has been
discovered and settled under the light of modern
science, art, and literature, that wealth is coming as
effectually under the control of the irresponsible few,
as it already is in Europe, where its present aggregation 
is an inherited evil, and not, as with us, an
adopted one that has been fostered and nurtured into

<!-- page 8 -->

its present magnitude principally by the very parties
who now possess it? Or, to put the question disconnected 
from king or country, What are the elements
of centralization in the sphere of wealth? through
what method has it fallen into the hands of the few?</p>

<p>In proceeding to reply to this question, it seems
necessary that we should assign some reason for our
differences of opinion upon the subject; for there is
no general agreement as to any one answer that has
yet been given. Our most learned men have not
pretended to any very creditable degree of satisfaction 
to themselves or others.</p>

<p>Does this state of confusion arise because the question 
is unanswerable; because there are no fundamental 
principles pertaining to political economy, by
means of which this branch of sociology can be
reduced to a science?</p>

<p>This can not be, from the fact that wealth holds
more real power, governs with more uniformity, than
king or president; and also that it is possessed by
those who are engaged in certain departments of
public interest, while those engaged in other departments 
have ever been correspondingly poor. That
men are rich or poor (as classes) as to the work in
which they are engaged, is sufficient proof that such
results are not the effects of blind chance, but of
some first principle in political science underlying all
habits and customs.</p>

<p>This being true, our ignorance of social science
has produced such a diversity of interests, that our
opinions and convictions are fashioned accordingly;
and there appears to have been none who have so

<!-- page 9 -->

thought upon this subject as to find their way through
these secondary causes, to first principles: consequently 
we have been under the light of said causes;
and it has been just enough to enable us to see faults
in another's views, but none in our own.</p>

<p>Whether the above conclusion is warranted, or not,
I shall not at this time undertake to prove; but I
write this essay under the conviction that it is. Consequently 
I shall make it my especial study to direct
your attention, through the workings of society, to
some of the first principles of its movements within
the sphere of wealth. And in doing this, I shall
speak first of the necessity of a knowledge of the
science of sociology.</p>

<br/>

<p>Of all the fields of thought demanding attention,
there are none so undeveloped as is this most important 
of all sciences, so much so, that, with the
exception of the definition of a few words, it is
really in a chaotic condition: consequently we have
no practical knowledge of the principles which,
moving upon society through its varied pursuits, lead
to given results.</p>

<p>This being true, and the exactly opposite being
indispensable to any correct idea of economic science,
it becomes imperative upon those who enter this field
of investigation to do this work for themselves; and
he who shall accomplish this, will have done a work
that must eventually be crowned with success,&mdash;a conclusion 
that is not visionary, but fully warranted by
the results that have followed corresponding work as
done in connection with other sciences.</p>

<!-- page 10 -->

<p>Astronomy, chemistry, physiology, &amp;c., were once
in the same chaotic condition as to their relations
to society, and continued to produce as many different 
opinions as to their true uses, as are now prevalent 
respecting the causes that aggregate wealth,
centralize it in the hands of the few. And this state
of things continued till these sciences were reduced
to order by the labor of those who saw the necessity
of such a work. And now they are so far developed
that there is a general agreement as to their uses;
and they have thus become conserving forces to the
good of society.</p>

<p>But, important as these sciences are, they are
merely auxiliaries to private purposes, compared to
the philanthropic work that will permeate and change
the whole aspect of society when a corresponding
work has been done in the field of sociology.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the order of the heavenly bodies,
in their movements to certain results, is a source of
agreement and consequent pleasure; as is also that of
the chemical changes that are occurring about us and
within ourselves, resulting in both mental and physical 
action; and so throughout the developed sciences.</p>

<p>But, great as these pleasures are, they are small
compared with what will follow from a development
of the science of sociology, that will enable men to
shake hands as brothers across the chasm of our
present social evils.</p>

<p>As we enter this field of science, the first object
that presents itself for our consideration is man; and
he is of such a compound, of so complex a nature,
that one pursuing an inquiry involving the principles

<!-- page 11 -->

of his movements necessarily assumes a work of the
same character.</p>

<p>He seems to possess two distinct departments of
being, each with functions of its own, and yet each
subject to the other; for, while the mind controls
the movements of the body (so far as they are voluntary), 
the action of the mind is in turn controlled
by the pains and pleasures of the body. And it is
not only thus subjective to the condition of its own
body, but its will is correspondingly controlled by all
other bodies; and regardless of their nature, structure, 
or the skill and labor bestowed upon them, ever
gives prominence to, and strives to perpetuate, not
only those that are necessary to the comfort and preservation 
of the body, but also to the ornamental, or to
whatever else is considered an exponent of the fact
that due provision has been made for such comfort.</p>

<p>And through the same power, to wit, the sensations
of the body, the will is correspondingly controlled to
the suppression of whatever stands in the way of
such provision being made.</p>

<p>The nature of this union between these two
departments of man's being, the whole world questions, 
but does not comprehend.</p>

<p>At first sight, the mind seems to have as perfect
and independent charge of the body, as though it
were some foreign power that had come here for a
few days, to lead about at will a piece of clay in the
form of a man; not permitting itself to be questioned
as to whence it came, the source of its knowledge, or
its right so to do.</p>

<p>It engages the body in all kinds of pursuits, both

<!-- page 12 -->

human and inhuman; sets it to building costly temples 
in which to teach the way to eternal bliss; and
at the same time uses it to adulterate articles of commerce, 
till the nations reel with drunkenness and disease. 
This is continued till the body becomes old,
worn out in such service. Then it is left to be buried
from sight; while this same mind, spirit, or whatever
it may be, takes its flight to parts unknown.</p>

<p>So mysterious have been the workings of this
power in man, that up to the present time, instead of
seeking to understand the laws controlling it, we
have looked upon it with awe, and submitted to our
fate. And here let me say, that our present condition 
of things must continue to exist till the science
of sociology becomes more thoroughly developed,&mdash;a
conclusion which we find fully warranted, even in its
present crude condition, when we study man through
one of the departments of this science, to wit, that
of wealth.</p>

<p>Here we find the mind in complete subjection to
the demands of the body; for no amount of willing
to the contrary can prevent the body from becoming
cold or hungry. Hence man is controlled to the
good of society, when the conditions upon which his
bodily comfort depends are in harmony with the
good of society. He will, he <i>must</i>, strive to perpetuate 
the conditions which secure to him bodily comforts.</p>

<p>In other words, through a true knowledge of the
science of wealth, man will not only be controlled to
the good of society, by having secured to him the
conditions through which he can provide for his

<!-- page 13 -->

bodily wants; but the agreeable influences thus
brought to bear upon his mind must predispose his
will, through the legitimate law of its control, to the
conservation of such conditions. That which is
necessary to the comfort of the body not only holds
the will in conformity with the enjoyment thereof,
but predisposes it to use the body to do the work,
and endure the fatigue, necessary to the continuance
of said comfort. And this it never fails to do, unless
the pain to be endured in order to the performance
of the work is a stronger motive to inaction, than the
expected good is to action. So truly are our wants
the governing power of the will, that we may in one
sense call them the god of the will.</p>

<p>The wealth now possessed is an exponent of the
resistance and encouragement that has been brought
to bear between the different classes, and also between
their unit members, while in its pursuit.</p>

<p>These motive powers that exist in the necessities
of our being, when properly understood and applied
in the interests of society, will secure to all what is
justly theirs. And this is particularly true of food,
clothing, and shelter.</p>

<p>The pain of hunger, and the consequent palatableness 
of food, are the motive powers that control the
will to determine to obtain food; so that any sane
man or woman in good health can be trusted to obtain
food for themselves, if the conditions necessary to
such provision are secured to them. And this is true
of all our physical wants.</p>

<p>Why, then, are so many so illy provided for? Is
it because the motives to cause them to strive to

<!-- page 14 -->

obtain what they need have not been brought to
bear? This can not be true, for they suffer from the
lack of those things more than others; and, as proof
that the will is not wanting, they do more work, and
suffer more fatigue, in proportion to what they
obtain, than does any other class in society.</p>

<p>Powerful as these motives are, they fail to direct
the will to labor under certain degrees of oppression;
but they fire that same will to resistance, even till
the lives of the oppressors are taken in self-defense.
The nobler the man, and the better informed, the less
oppression he will endure before he will turn upon
his oppressor, forcing him to lose his hold or his life;
a condition of things that must ere long exist here in
our United States, unless something can be done to
check the flow of wealth from the many to the few;
for the intelligence of our American people is such,
that they will not much longer submit to the oppression 
that arises from this cause.</p>

<p>Then let us reason in council together, O men of
America! and see if we can not find some method
through which the threatened conflict can be averted,
while the plowshare continues its work, and the
pruning-hook to prepare for the gathering of fruit.</p>

<p>The laws which will secure the peace and harmony
of society are inherent in our nature, and will be
directed, both individually and collectively, to that
end, just so soon as the individual is secured the
proceeds of his own labor, when he shall be able
to live without being forced to butter another's
bread, while eating his own dry.</p>

<p>The lack of this balance in the sphere of wealth,

<!-- page 15 -->

the failure to secure this condition to the individual,
is the germ from which has sprung countless wars,
national, civil, and individual. For the will is so
under the control of wealth, is governed so much more
by it than by any other power, because of the pleasures 
and pains consequent upon its possession or the
lack of it, that men will protect each other where
their interests in connection therewith are in harmony; 
and contend, even unto death, where such
interests are opposed, one's to another's.</p>

<p>We are pointed to education as a remedy for the
evils under which we are suffering; and, so earnest
are the people in their efforts in this direction, that
enforced, or compulsory, education is becoming the
law of the land. But this will not, can not, remove
the difficulty.</p>

<p>We do not need to secure a balance between the
mental and physical natures of men; for this has been
the work of the civilized world for a century or more.</p>

<p>Republics have been established; schools have been
multiplied beyond that of any former period; knowledge 
has been scattered broadcast over the land, and
under the influence of as pure motives as can inspire
human action, even till the powers of nature, that
were once looked upon with awe, have been utilized
to our service. And this has been done, not only in
our own country, but in other lands as well.</p>

<p>Both the government and the people at large have
countenanced and supported the inventive genius of
the age, and the diffusion of the knowledge that has
made it effective, with an idea to the best good of
the whole; and have tried to hold the results of such

<!-- page 16 -->

knowledge, the wealth thus accruing, to the service
of all. But they have failed.</p>

<p>And why? Because Nature is true to herself, and
provides no means of removing an evil, only as we
act upon and remove the cause. The unequal distribution 
of wealth keeps steadily on the increase;
and the future darkens proportionably to nine-tenths
of the people, pointing to poverty and want, not only
to the ignorant and vicious, but to the prudent, the
moral, the educated man and woman.</p>

<p>The inevitable conclusion is, that the work necessary 
to be done does not lie in the direction of education. 
The individual members of society can never
remove the difficulties under which we labor from
the lack of adjustment in the sphere of wealth,
through the development of their capacities in the
sphere of education, only so far as it shall teach them
the laws pertaining to the sphere of wealth.</p>

<p>Our work lies in the direction of capital, and its
power to secure its own ends at the expense of the
public good. Capital is the king of this age, who
claims the divine right to rule. This is the power
that we must meet, and subjugate to the good of all;
and this can be done only as a proper balance is
secured between public and private interest. No
man or class of men should be allowed to hold, as a
private right, the control of that which can interfere
with the public good; must not hold, as a privilege,
that for which an equivalent can not be secured to
every member of society.</p>

<p>That all will improve their advantages alike, can
not be expected; but, till this condition or relation

<!-- page 17 -->

of things is secured, it can be said of no man that he
is really accountable for his poverty, and no man can
have an honorable title to wealth. In fact, there is
nothing else that can place society upon a sound
basis, one in which industry and economy are the
sure and only conditions to wealth.</p>

<p>To secure this balance of power between the different 
classes, with their divisions and subdivisions,
is the work of the collective will. This collective
will has the right, through its agents, and should take
the charge of all work, the nature of which, if entered
into as a private right, would in any way enable its
possessor to draw to himself the conditions of another's
independence.</p>

<p>When the conditions of balance are thus secured
by the collective will, then the individual has the
right to improve, and apply to private purposes.</p>

<p>Thus the individuality which man shows himself
determined to retain would be legitimately secured;
and at the same time there would be nothing to stand
between industry and its just rewards, or willful
neglect and consequent poverty.</p>

<p>These legitimate rewards and punishments should
not be interfered with, for they are Nature's methods
of teaching. Thus you see that I do not believe in
a community of goods. Man works to meet the
demands of his being, from the knowledge that he
must do so, or suffer; and a community of goods has
a tendency to remove this direct responsibility to
one's self, which is Nature's power to industry.</p>

<p>The aversion that man has to labor seems at first
sight an evil; but upon further examination we find it

<!-- page 18 -->

an essential element to progress. If he toiled simply
for the pleasure of toiling, there would be no incentive 
to utilizing the forces of nature. He would not
even have a donkey to carry a grist to mill, or a mill
to grind it, but would find some method by which he
could save that pleasure to himself; to wit, that of
working upon the grain to make it fine.</p>

<p>If labor was a pleasure to a man, simply for its own
sake, and not for what it will bring him, he would
not, as now, strive to produce the most possible with
the least labor; but, on the contrary, would strive to
make the most labor produce the least, thus rendering 
him unfit to be called a progressive being. Nature
does her work correctly, as those will see who study
her motive powers. She has so constituted man, that
it is what he obtains through labor that he enjoys; and
at the same time there is such a disinclination to
labor, that he utilizes every force possible.</p>

<p>So keenly does he enjoy the results of labor, and
so thoroughly disinclined is he to toil, that he will
force others to labor, and take to himself the products, 
if he can. And here is where the true work of
the reformer lies at this time. The balance must be
struck between labor and capital. The collective
will must take charge of the collective interests of
the people, giving the individual the control of that
which is particularly his only so far as said control
can be used without danger to the liberties of
another.</p>

<p>That men have aggregated to themselves the rewards 
that were honestly due to others, and that
they are doing so in our country to-day to a greater

<!-- page 19 -->

extent than ever before; and that those who hold
special or chartered privileges, or have in any other
way obtained possession of that which affects the
public good, are using their utmost power to secure
to themselves a still greater harvest in the future,&mdash;is 
a fact patent to all.</p>

<p>It is not to find fault with, to disapprove of the
disposition in man which leads him to seek pleasure
and shun pain, that I call your attention to what has
resulted therefrom. Not at all; for it is the conserving 
power of all progress. It is because these motive
powers of nature, as brought into relations with
wealth, are out of balance, that so many are forced to
work for themselves and others too. It is because,
as members of society that has common as well as
individual interests, individuals and classes have been
permitted to hold privileges which have enabled
them to subject the former to the latter.</p>

<p>In dealing with the innate principles of our nature,
it is important that we have a proper understanding
of their relations; for they are the base upon which a
true structure of society must rest. To trace those
principles in their future action upon society through
the successive changes which they will force it to
take ere it rests squarely upon this solid base provided 
by nature, is more than I am able to do. But,
that I have stated what the next step must be, I
think is proven; or, if not, the fault is in my inability
to set forth the evidence properly, and not because it
does not exist.</p>

<p>Admitting that one could thus trace the steps
necessary to reach an ideal, or perfect state of

<!-- page 20 -->

society, it would probably destroy his influence in
his own time; for those that were any great distance
in the future would appear so erroneous to those of
the present age that to state them would be useless.</p>

<p>Past changes have not been wrought in this manner; 
not by fixing the mind upon some ideal in the
future, toward which society deliberately tends, but
as a means to removing some great evil that could
not be longer endured.</p>

<p>But let future changes come as they may, whatever 
structure society takes upon itself, the individuality 
of each must be so secured that all can feel
sure of the full benefits of their own labor, and be
certain that they must also reap the consequences of
their own neglect. Then the same motives that now
prompt a man to compel another to serve him will
compel him to serve himself.</p>

<p>The full statement of my idea, in as few words as
possible, is this: I would so balance the forces that
call men into action, as to have them see and feel
that they can not enjoy the results of another's labor,
either directly or indirectly, without giving an equivalent 
in return. It may be asked if this will not interfere 
with our liberty. Yes, it will interfere with
the liberty that enables the few to make the many
serve them; will hold in due subjection the freedom
that one man enjoys at the expense of another.</p>

<p>This kind of freedom has had to be surrendered
in the past in exact proportion to the increase of the
freedom of many. This surrender of the privileges
of the few to the rights, the interests, of the many,
has been steadily on the advance; the evils that

<!-- page 21 -->

arose from different phases of oppression never failing, 
in their turn, to remove the causes which produced 
them, and each in their true and legitimate
order.</p>

<p>In the earlier history of the race, the evils that
demanded removal through change arose from small,
distinct, but hostile clans that made it their business
to prey upon each other. This condition of things
could not be removed, or at least it was not, till
those clans surrendered their liberty as hostile clans
by coming under the control of a centralized government; 
which was really a concession in behalf of the
people's rights, though not seeming so at first sight,
for it gave them advantages that they could enjoy
as clans.</p>

<p>But the king, or the combined aristocracy, became
tyrannical in proportion to the security of their
position, and so oppressed the people that another
change was sought and consummated, one which
secured to the people the right of self-government,
or the choice of their own rulers.</p>

<p>In looking at those changes after they have been
effected, and after the comparative happiness consequent 
thereon has been enjoyed, they appear to us
to have been so necessary and so simple that we lose
sight of the fact, that, while they were pending, men
of science and ability, men of culture and experience,
alike with the most profound philosophers, were at
loss to know what were the powers out of balance,
and so could not indicate the changes requisite to
their adjustment.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the questions affecting those

<!-- page 22 -->

changes of the past may be partially ours, by taking
into consideration the time it took to effect them,
the conditions under which they were secured, and,
after all, the limited manner in which they are now
enjoyed.</p>

<p>I have referred to the changes that have given us
our present phase of civilization, for three very important 
reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, To show that the power of the few over
society has in each case been surrendered to the
liberty and happiness of the many.</p>

<p>Second, Because we must have some knowledge
of the conditions connected with, and the effects
resulting from, past changes; or we are without the
necessary landmarks by which to determine whether
we are advocating a measure of reform or anarchy.</p>

<p>Third, Because society in its progress never contradicts 
itself, or changes the order of its growth:
consequently the same work, in point of principle,
requisite to effect the changes of the past, must be
done to secure similar or needed changes in the
present or future. Life in all its varied forms, both
animate and inanimate, gives its affirmation to this
last statement; from the fact that development is
secured by an extension of the first principles of the
existence of each individual form, and not by the
introduction of any new law of growth.</p>

<p>This being true, as all nature declares, there is
only one method through which we can hope to be
successful in bringing about the reform desired; and
that is, to extend the principles that our fathers found
necessary to apply to the ruling power, to take up

<!-- page 23 -->

the work just where they left it off. For the evils
that press so heavily upon us have not resulted from
what they did, but from what they left undone, and
which must be done before said evils can be removed.</p>

<p>Here is a method of inquiry that will lead one who
pursues it to the cause of our present social evils; for,
if an evil that presents itself is the effect of some work
that has been done, it proves that work itself to be
the effect of an evil, and not of an intelligent action
on the part of the people for the removal of an evil
by removing its cause; and to deal with the said
work, in order to remove further resulting evils, is
only dealing with effects to remove their causes.</p>

<p>But, when we trace said evils up through their
working till they point to something that has not
been done, then we have discovered their true
foundation; and when we remove them, as far as it
is in our power to do so, by doing the work indicated,
the conservative nature of society is such that they
are removed forever, unless said society is thrown
back by some foreign invasion.</p>

<p>In looking at the evils of to-day from this standpoint, 
our attention is not directed to man's nature
as their source, but to some work, either in the field
of individual or of collective enterprise, that he has
not yet done. All departments of human interest
connected with the sphere of wealth are included
under the above heads; the labor of society being
thus separated into two grand divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>One, that to be entered into by the individual, to
be superintended and controlled as he sees best, as
we see him doing in his private affairs now; the

<!-- page 24 -->

other, the field of collective enterprise, into which
the individual may enter only by the consent, and
as the representative, of the collective will.</p>

<p>I should like to speak further of these two fields
of labor, but will only say at this time that the work
of the first tends to centralization, from the extreme
action of which we are suffering so much to-day;
while the work of the collective field is that of
decentralization, and tends to hold wealth and its
sources of production justly related to all concerned,
minorities as well as majorities.</p>

<p>These two kinds of work are so different in their
nature, that it is impossible for society to be at peace
with itself, no matter what its knowledge, or humanity 
of purpose, so long as a proper division of their
respective spheres of labor has not been made.</p>

<p>To mistake the collective field of labor for that of
the individual, would be a misdirection of our powers
and capabilities that would produce a state of society
such as we now have. This being true, to refuse to
assign our present evils to the misdirected energies of
the unit members of society, is to suspend judgment,
and refrain from action under the clear light of day,
and under the most urgent demands that can command 
attention.</p>

<p>Society ever has and ever must suffer the evils
perpetrated by itself through the misdirected energies 
of its members; and these energies will continue 
to be misdirected till the collective field of rule
is fully possessed by its legitimate authority.</p>

<p>Society has its center, as well as other organized
bodies; and that center is its collective interests.

<!-- page 25 -->

Those who are successful in controlling said interests 
to their individual benefit prove that they are
in their right places; only they should serve the collective 
interest, instead of controlling it to themselves.</p>

<p>They should be the representatives of said collective 
interest, managing it for the public good; they
receiving no benefit therefrom further than their salaries, 
only as they are a part of that public. They
should act in such capacity, or they should let the
collective interest alone. This field of labor is now
held by individuals or by corporate bodies; and they
force the public to accept their terms, or refuse to
serve it; and, holding the avenues to said work in
their own hands, they of course become the real
rulers of the people.</p>

<p>This unbalanced power has so perverted the judgment 
of those who hold it, that they believe in their
right to hold it to their own aggrandizement as much
as ever king believed in his divine right to rule. And,
what is more deplorable still, the whole community
is taught to look upon them in the same light; thus
embalming, as it were, in the very heart of society,
the cause of its oppression.</p>

<p>These two interests, the individual and the collective, 
correspond, in their action upon society, to the
two forces that rule the planetary system. The sun
is one: the planets are many. The power of the
sun is the centralizing force which would draw
every thing to itself; but the collective tendency of
the planets is against this centralizing tendency; and
the proper balance between the two keeps the system 

<!-- page 26 -->

in harmony. Should the centralizing force get
the control, the planets would be drawn to the center 
to their own ruin, if not that of the sun. On the
other hand, should the planets get the balance of
power, they would run lawless through the sky, and
we should have planet-anarchy.</p>

<p>But society to-day is in the condition that the
planetary system would be if the sun, or governing
power, were not large enough to balance them, and
Jupiter, Saturn, or other of the larger planets, should
get between it and the lesser planets, and attempt to
run the system for their own particular benefit, taking 
to themselves the warmth of the sun, and leaving
the lesser ones to suffer from the want thereof, even
as our millionaires do the small planets of society.
The collective interests that pertain to society must
be put in their proper center before the true balance
can come. The centralization that we have to contend 
with to-day is not only undue, but in the wrong
place.</p>

<p>Still, in looking at the causes that have produced
the present conditions, you will readily see that
there is no special blame to be laid at the door of
any one man, or class of men, further than that
which is common to us all. These conditions are the
results of the abuse of the undue power that unlimited 
wealth gives one man over another, or the individual 
over society. This being true, there is only
one method of relief; and that is to superintend the
avenues to unlimited wealth by the collective will.</p>

<p>Men are not so heterogeneous or so dissimilar in
their natures as to render them uncontrollable by

<!-- page 27 -->

any government or rule securing good society.
They are every thing to the contrary; for the interest 
of one man, when properly understood, is so in
conformity with the true interests of all men, that it
may be said, with more truth than fiction, that the
whole human family is but one man moving around
in different bodies, with hardly enough difference in
temperament to make him a first-class man in any
one of the several occupations if left to himself.
Each needs the others for completeness: consequently
we have nothing to fear in pressing the changes
that we can show are for the best good of all.</p>

<p>This need that one has of others in the different
occupations, is, in my opinion, proof also that one
should not, can not from the standpoint of principle,
of justice, claim greater remuneration for corresponding 
labor performed in one department than in
another; and any thing other than this seems to me
an encroachment of the individual over society, or of
society over the individual.</p>

<p class="small">The Power of Public Sentiment&mdash;The Concealed Cause of our
Trouble&mdash;In which Division of Society concealed&mdash;The Law
by which Wealth flows from the Many to the Few&mdash;The
Purification of Government&mdash;The Conditions under which a
Political Party desiring Reform can be organized to become
a Success, &amp;c.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Believing</span> that by this time you have an understanding 
of what I consider the power out of balance, 
and also of the work of its true adjustment, but
not a convincing view thereof, I feel it a duty that I
owe to you and to myself, to ask you to throw aside
the prejudice of preconceived opinions, that we may
look, if possible, from some common standpoint upon
the workings of society through the principles that
move it.</p>

<p>Unless we can do this, our efforts will be fruitless;
and all that has been said up to the present time
has been for the express purpose that you might be
able to comply with this request, that you might
be able to weigh the summing-up of my evidence
with unbiased minds.</p>

<p>Hoping that my efforts have not been in vain, I
shall now direct your attention to the working of
society as indicated above.</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>When I think of the power of public sentiment, I
feel that society must be laboring under the effects
of some false idea that has been incorporated into
the relations underlying its movements; something
that has not yet been discovered as false, and, consequently, 
has been indorsed as a fundamental principle 
of good society, and thus has escaped public
censure.</p>

<p>That every nation in the civilized world is suffering 
under oppression, of which they would gladly
rid themselves if they knew how, is proof to my
mind that society is holding in its conserving
embrace the very cause of its adversity; for I believe
it impossible for an evil to exist long when the cause
thereof is so well understood as to fall under general
condemnation.</p>

<p>There may seem to be exceptions to this; but it
will be found, upon closer inspection, that in such
cases the censure has fallen upon effects, instead of
causes.</p>

<p>Public sentiment is a controlling power. That it
should be, and is designed to be, is too well known
to need confirmation. Long-standing institutions,
governments, customs, and habits, though once powerful, 
have crumbled to pieces before its revolutionizing 
tendency. Hence, for any form of oppression to
be on the increase when the cause of such oppression
has, for any considerable length of time, been under
public censure, is simply impossible.</p>

<p>The cause, therefore, of the evils under which we
now suffer can not, as yet, have been discovered as an
evil, but must be looked upon as a necessary condition 
to good society and public security.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>We may begin to see, then, why it is that industry
and economy do not necessarily keep their possessors
from poverty, nor the lack of those virtues prevent
wealth from flowing into the coffers of those who
stand so related to this hidden cause that it turns in
their favor; for, public censure ruling from a false
standard, society must of necessity be falsely affected.</p>

<p>Having thus, by the aid of one of the strongest of
social elements, proved the cause of our oppression
to be a disguised power, some evil that is dressed in
the garb of good, the next step in order is to ascertain 
in which department of public interest this disguised 
power is so concealed as to escape public
detection, and, consequently, public censure.</p>

<p>Upon analyzing society, we find it to consist
mainly of two grand divisions, to wit, the producing
and the trading classes, to the latter of which the
professional and the official classes are comparatively
subjective. These two grand divisions comprise
nearly the whole human family; the first producing
the wealth, and the latter distributing it, controlling
its exchange. But which possesses the most of it?</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the trading division
does, and through such possession controls those who
produce it, as well as the professions and the officials.
On the contrary, those who are engaged in
productive labor are comparatively poor; and, as a
class, have but very little control over society, are in
what may be called a besieged condition.</p>

<p>This, to me, is conclusive evidence that the hidden
evil, the perverted power, that has produced, and
still continues, yea, increases, the oppression that is

<!-- page 31 -->

so apparent,&mdash;it is to me, evidence that this power is
in the trader's hands, or, at least, inclines in his
favor. Our well-stocked markets and our crowded
warehouses prove that the poverty of the productive
classes does not result from a lack of effort on their
part. They have produced enough to supply the
needs of society.</p>

<p>And yet, owing to the power that the trader has
of getting their productions from them without a
just compensation, producers are dependent upon the
very ones that they feed and clothe; so dependent
that they themselves often suffer from the lack of
what they furnish others. Now, if the power by
means of which the trader does this was not a disguised 
one, an injustice wearing the form of justice,
would the productive classes submit to it?</p>

<p>They possess as much sterling worth of character,
and as much persistency of purpose, as does any
other class of people; and, if they saw the cause of
that which oppressed them, they would resist the
imposition, would work persistently to its suppression. 
In fact, I do not believe that the traders themselves 
realize that their relations one to another, and
to the productive classes, necessitate injustice to the
latter. But the fact that they possess the greatest
proportion of the wealth, proves that they have got
it somehow, and that too without giving a just
equivalent in return: otherwise the productive
classes would be equally as wealthy, in proportion to
their numbers; for it is certainly as much labor to
produce, as it is to trade upon that which has been
produced.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>The productive classes are, likewise, just as selfish
as are the trading classes. They have as strong a
desire to possess wealth, and strive as hard to obtain
it, if not harder; and, if the disguised power was in
their favor, would be equally as ready to use it to
their own aggrandizement. And, further, if this disguised 
cause of evil existed in any thing that is common
to both classes, then it would affect both classes
alike; for they have their origin in the same ancestry, 
and, with equal opportunities, must be correspondingly 
equal as to condition; for like causes
produce like consequences.</p>

<p>Therefore inequitable money, false systems of currency, 
tyranny of the majority over the minority, the
question of suffrage for woman, &amp;c., having a common 
bearing upon both of these great divisions of
society, any of them that would benefit or injure one
class would do the same to both. This goes to show
that that which secures the success of the trader over
the producer is a special power in the hands of the
trader, one that can not be held in common by the
producer under their present relations.</p>

<p>In tracing the effects of this disguised power, we
are constantly pointed to the trader. Still we find
them a class of men who seem to be honestly engaged
in the work of transfer and exchange,&mdash;a work that
is just as necessary as is that of production; for
without it our productive industries could not well
exist.</p>

<p>Having, as it were, arrived at the top round of
human enterprise, and not yet having pointed out the
cause of the centralization of wealth in the hands

<!-- page 33 -->

of the few, to the oppression of the masses; not yet
having answered the question with which we started,&mdash;you
may be inclined to point the finger of scorn,
and to call me an impostor in the field of political
economy; and justly, too, did not the movements of
society point to the disguised power in the shape of
the trader as a private speculator in the collective
field of enterprise, diverting the life-currents of the
nation from their legitimate channels of decentralization, 
into those of centralization, till it has become
so debilitated that it shakes like an aspen in the
hands of a few Wall-street brokers.</p>

<p>Never were a people more victimized under the
plea of public utility, when it was believed that the
few possessed the superior wisdom to rule despotically 
the destinies of empires, than are the masses to-day, 
when acting under the delusion that the inner
currents of society, on which flow the world's commerce, 
are superintended with greater justice to the
public by private enterprise, than they could be by
collective rule.</p>

<p>The patricians of Rome never feasted more sumptuously 
on the delusions of their day, than private
speculators upon public interest are doing in our
midst now.</p>

<p>The injustice is the same in point of principle as
was that inflicted by despotic power; and there is no
help for our depending classes only in the surrender
of the power that holds them in dependence; and,
if we fail in this, we have a fearful precedent of the
future of this great nation in the ruin, the desolation,
of the Roman empire.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>That the speculators of Wall Street have held this
nation trembling in the balance, is publicly recorded
in the history of the gold conspiracy of 1869; and
but for the gold under the president's control, thus
enabling him to hold them in durable subjection,
they would have succeeded in their attempts against
the public good, for their individual benefit. Charles
Francis Adams, jun., says of these immense combinations 
of wealth, in the thirty-eighth volume of the
Westminster Review, "An empire within a republic, 
with wealth greater than that controlled by most
kings;" and he further says, "<i>The corporation is in its
nature a threat against the popular institutions which
are spreading so rapidly over the world. Wherever
there is a popular and limited government, this difficulty 
will be found in its path; and, unless some satisfactory 
solution of the problem can be reached, popular
institutions may yet find their existence endangered</i>."</p>

<p>We believe that the only possible solution lies in
the division of the fields of individual and of collective 
enterprise, giving to the latter the control of all
avenues to unlimited wealth; and, in support thereof,
would ask, why it is, when the president and his cabinet, 
and the Wall-street brokers, are so nearly alike
in their selfish natures, that the gold which in the
hands of one conserves the public good is in the
hands of the other such a power to the dissolution of
business, that the National Government has to interfere 
to prevent utter ruin.</p>

<p>The answer is simple. The money, in the one case,
is under the control of the decentralizing power of
the collective will; and, in the other, is under the

<!-- page 35 -->

control of the centralizing power of private enterprise.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have an example of the humane
effect of the collective rule in the domain of wealth,
and of the opposite tendency of private speculation.
Yet the Wall-street trader is no more oppressive, in
accordance with the nature and power of his business, 
than are other classes of traders. They are all
engaged in a common effort to draw to themselves, as
far as is possible, the wealth of society, and the consequent 
power to command further possessions.</p>

<p>The Wall-street broker does not deal with the
money market with any greater spirit of injustice,
nor make the welfare of those depending upon it any
more uncertain, than the traders in the production of
raw material have done, and are doing in the labor
market to-day. They take every possible advantage
of the laborer: they use their millions to get possession 
of all the paying enterprises, on the one hand;
and, on the other, introduce the most improved machinery, 
and then demand a reduction of wages.</p>

<p>The laborer having but little money (owing to
small wages), and no general knowledge (on account
of the nature of his work, and the monopoly of his
mind in the interest of his employer), feels himself
completely besieged, and surrenders at will, only to
be forced to still further submission.</p>

<p>What is true of these two classes of traders is true
of every other class; they subjugating each other
also, just as far as it is in their power to do so.</p>

<p>But, to follow the workings of the respective
classes in detail, would only be spending time to

<!-- page 36 -->

prove what must, ere this, be apparent to all: therefore 
we will only look further at the two great divisions, 
the productive and the distributing traders.
Here we shall find, in its true action, the centralizing
power that gathers the wealth of the nations into the
hands of the few. And what is it? What is this
power that thus gathers to itself the products of the
labor of others? It is the control that the individual 
holds over that which becomes, through the
necessities of the public, a source of wealth.</p>

<p>This is the fixed and only principle upon which
the centralization of property is based; and men
gather it in exact proportion to the extent of their
control over public necessities; or, in other words, in
accordance with the amount of that which is a public
necessity, which passes under their control as private
property.</p>

<p>The productive traders, or those who deal in the
raw material of our products, in doing their work
decrease in numbers, and increase in wealth, as they
succeed each other in the movements that are necessary 
for the raw material to become developed
wealth. But when, by being made ready for use,
these products have changed their relation to the
public need, and are being demanded back again,
then this law of centralization is proved inversely.
For, the nearer we come to the people, the greater the
number of traders, and the less the individual wealth.
Controlling a less quantity of the public necessities,
they have, as a natural result, less power to draw
wealth to themselves through those necessities.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is the power that public wealth has in

<!-- page 37 -->

the hands of the private speculator, that gives rise to
interest on money, and consequently makes money
another power of centralization, besieging the speculator 
as he does the depending public.</p>

<p>The centralizing power here complained of is not
the disposition that man has to draw to himself; for,
if he lacked this power, he would be a trouble to
himself and others. It is because he occupies a position 
in which this centralizing power tends to undue
action; because he is permitted to hold, as private
property, that which the public or any considerable
number of the public must have to live upon, and
also gets control of the conditions through which
that living must be secured.</p>

<p>It is as men possess this privilege over society, that
they have the power to draw to themselves the wealth
of a people, a nation. Men are made to serve each
other through the necessities of their being; and
having and holding private control over the conditions 
which meet those necessities, is the true cause
of the wealth of the many passing into the hands of
the few.</p>

<p>It is this centralizing power that now has control
of every department of public interest. It owns
and manages all our manufacturing interests, our
railroads, telegraph-lines, controls our shipping interests, 
conducts our commerce, and, through the wealth
thus accumulated, builds our large cities, where tens
of thousands eke out a bare subsistence, or are driven,
through the pressure upon them, into desperation and
crime; and thousands grow rich, and erect palaces, at
the expense of the producing classes; and is the true

<!-- page 38 -->

and only cause of the unendurable burdens laid
upon us by non-producers, and by the false expenditure 
of wealth.</p>

<p>All this, and much more, is the legitimate outgrowth 
of private speculation in the collective field
of enterprise. It is the power accruing from wealth
thus gathered, that is bidding defiance to all kinds of
governments, republican not excepted; and this is
the power that we are called upon to subdue, in behalf
of the consequent sufferers that are on the increase,
both in point of numbers and privation, throughout
the civilized world.</p>

<p>Gravity is no truer to its own law, and no more
necessary to the existence of solid bodies upon this
earth, than is wealth to the existence and welfare of
man. It is the divine power, so to speak, which
governs him; and it has demonstrated its power to rule
wherever and by whomsoever possessed.</p>

<p>It is this power of wealth, that makes it imperatively 
necessary for potentates to have control of it
in some form, in order to hold any command over
their subjects. The power that wealth has to feed
and clothe us is a sufficient reason why every man,
woman, and child should have command of enough
of it to meet their needs. In fact, wealth is to society
what a rudder is to a ship; and whoever controls it
controls society.</p>

<p>I do not call your attention to the power of wealth
because I consider it an evil: on the contrary, it is
good, and becomes evil only when out of balance,
when held by the few, to the injury of the many.
I only wish to show you, in connection with what I

<!-- page 39 -->

have previously said, that this power is a true and
legitimate one, and only becomes oppressive when it
is held as private property, to make gain at the
public expense.</p>

<p>It was once thought to be the divine right of the
king to control the wealth of the people at will; and
it is now thought to be the divine right of the few to
get and hold wealth under the plea of public utility,
and to govern the masses under the garb of democracy; 
though they do so at the expense and consequent 
delusion of universal suffrage.</p>

<p>True, we have the right to vote; but, to those who
are not so fortunate as to be among the wealthy few,
it makes but little difference whether we have the
ballot, or not, unless we can learn to use it to the
abrogation of that centralized condition of wealth
which now holds us in subjection. The advantages
of the common people in this country, over and above
those enjoyed by a similar class in other countries,
has not been due so much to a democratical form of
government, as it has to the fact that this was a new
country, and, the conditions to wealth not having
been monopolized, every provident person had a
chance to provide for themselves,&mdash;a conclusion that
is verified from the fact, that our monopolies increase
in proportion to the increase of our population.</p>

<p>True, wealth is not controlled by a despotic form
of government in our country; but it is held and controlled 
by the few, and those few are private individuals, 
or corporate companies, with rights of which
an equivalent can not be possessed by the masses.
These few, with the wealth in their hands, control the

<!-- page 40 -->

government; and we, being subject to the government, 
are as completely under the rule of an aristocracy, 
as are any people in Europe.</p>

<p>A condition of things that must continue to exist
as long as the avenues of public wealth are under
the control of private enterprise, instead of being in
the hands of the true decentralizing power,&mdash;the
collective or democratic will. The individual will
is aristocratic in its nature, and the collective is the
true democratic. We claim to be a democracy; and
yet, when funds were needed to defray the expenses of
a war that threatened the life of the nation, we had
to borrow of the aristocrat, of the individual, and
are to-day burdened with taxes to pay the interest
thereon. A democracy playing rule, with the feet
of the aristocracy upon its neck! Had we managed
our own public interests, this need not have been.
The government&mdash;to wit, the people&mdash;would have
had money to lend, instead of having to borrow.</p>

<p>But it has been otherwise; and, as a consequence,
we are showing signs of national congestion. For the
circulating and distributing power of society, or its
inner currents, upon which flow the world's commerce, 
hold the same relation to its unit members as
do the lungs and heart of our bodies to the molecules
or atoms of which they are composed; and any
derangement of the former is attended with as serious
consequences as would be a derangement of the latter;
and the symptoms of vital derangement may be
detected in society, as readily as in the human body.</p>

<p>The atoms that make up the most perfect development 
of our bodies are the elements of premature

<!-- page 41 -->

decay when they lose their balance in the vital organs
of life so those men, who are by nature a conserving
force to good society, become a power to anarchy and
rebellion when they get out of balance, and lose their
true relations one to another.</p>

<p>I would say, then, and think that I have conclusively 
shown, that the cause of the present unjust
distribution of wealth is not from the want of more
general culture, and a reduction of the hours of labor;
it is not that our system of finance is wrong; it is
not because our natures are selfish and corrupt: but
because men, through ignorance of their true relations 
to each other, have lost their place in the specific
realm of wealth, and are trying to centralize and
hold to themselves the life-currents of society.</p>

<p>I do not intend to say that our system of finance
is a correct one, or that we do not need more culture
and less toil; but I do say, that whatever is wrong
here is not a <i>cause</i>, but an effect.</p>

<p>And I further say, that, though there may be temporary 
palliatives, there can be no remedy for the
evils under which we are suffering but in the surrender 
of private control over public necessities. And,
to secure such surrender, we must show to the people
at large that their happiness and security, yea, that
the very life of the nation, demands the supervision
and control of collective rule in every department of
public industry; and that only in this manner can
government be purged of its corruptions.</p>

<p>But it devolves upon me here to show why it is
that our government has become so corrupt, and to
explain, as well as to assert, the method of its purification. 

<!-- page 42 -->

Government does not become corrupt without 
an adequate cause; and, so far as I can see, the
cause lies in the lack of the direct action of public
sentiment upon it. Public sentiment holds the purifying 
power; or, if not, there is none that can be
made available in this direction.</p>

<p>But this power has not been brought to bear upon
the government: those who are interested in the
controlling avenues of wealth stand between it and
the people, protecting it from public censure, while
corrupting it to their own ends. You may look into
whatever department of business you please: if public 
sentiment is not the ruling power, there is little
or no regard for public rights. Power must balance
power, to secure justice; and men's natures are not
changed by being elected to Congress, or by being
appointed to public offices. They are the same modifiable 
beings all the while; and, whatever acts they
may be guilty of in any department of public trust,
such acts, I am fully convinced, are the results of the
modifying power brought to bear upon them while
discharging their respective duties.</p>

<p>Consequently men who under the right influences
justify public trust are, through the action of the
same laws of their being, made corrupt under false
conditions. Hence the only way to purify government 
is to extend its work, and thus secure the power
of public sentiment in that work. This can be done
only by government taking upon itself the work in
which the public is directly interested. Said work is
the superintendence and control of both natural and
produced wealth, in order that it may be held in its

<!-- page 43 -->

true relation to the interests of the whole people;
subject to the principle of democracy, and the authority 
of those interested.</p>

<p>In this manner we secure two results; to wit, the
purification of government, and the equitable distribution 
of wealth: consequently two evils are removed
through one and the same work.</p>

<br/>

<p>We have so far talked of what must be done; but
we have said nothing of the how to do it. The
change that we desire, and which must come, can
only be effected through a new political party, or
through revolution. The latter we would avoid if
possible: if it must come, let our working people be
found upon the platform of constitutional right, leaving 
the aggression, as in the case of the recent Rebellion, 
to come from the other side.</p>

<p>But what are the powers that organize successful
political parties? In looking at the causes that have
led to such results in the past, we find that we must
work with Nature as she unfolds society through her
laws of progress. And it is of little use to move till
she is fully ready, has fully prepared the way for such
movement; and she does this through the law of
growth.</p>

<p>This growth does not come in a day, a week, or
even in a generation; yea, if a century fits us for so
important a step as must next be taken, we shall have
advanced rapidly, compared to what has been in the
past. The last positive step in advance was taken
nearly a hundred years since, by our Revolutionary
fathers, in their declaration of independence from the

<!-- page 44 -->

mother-country, which culminated in securing to the
people the right to govern themselves. Time was
necessary to test the practicability of that movement.
The people must have their rejoicing over what they
had gained, and must learn, through experience,
what is wanting, if any thing, to complete its triumph.</p>

<p>The law that controls the growth of society, being
true to itself and to the interest of future generations, 
does not stop to rest, so to speak, but continues 
its work till it brings to the surface some
other hitherto undetected condition by means of
which one portion of society oppresses another, and
develops the evils that arise from such oppression till
they become so great that another step must be
taken. To-day the people are groaning under the
oppression coming from the power of centralized
wealth. They have tried various expedients to rid
themselves of this oppression; but it only holds them
the tighter. And something must be done; but what
is it?</p>

<p>Society will not take any great step in reform, or
make a successful effort to rid itself of any species
of oppression, till it has not only a knowledge of
what constitutes the oppression, but a clear view of
some specific work, which, if accomplished, will
remove such oppression. It will stand and contend,
no matter how heavily burdened, till the right step
in the onward march of progress is indicated, marked
out, and a reasonable hope of success made apparent.</p>

<p>Our fathers, when they secured the right to govern 
to the will of the governed, took the last vital
step in reform that has yet been taken. They did

<!-- page 45 -->

this because of finding from long experience that,
when one man or class of men govern without being
under due restraint from the will of the governed,
that man or class of men, by the very nature of their
being, are too local in their feelings and interests to
enable them to govern with any creditable degree of
justice: hence there was no power upon which the
government could rest, in point of justice, except
upon the corporate will of the governed.</p>

<p>This principle is the one supposed to be secured to
the United States citizen; but, notwithstanding all
this, the wealthy few still rule.</p>

<p>This is proof to me that a mistake has been made
which prevents the application of the principle
designed. That mistake, as I see things, consists in
the fact, that, while the right to govern is secured to
the will of the governed, the means necessary to execute 
that right are still held by the individual.</p>

<p>If it can be shown that either the individual or
the collective will has any power to self-preservation
without the requisite means to that end, then all
men, and governments as well, can be wealthy by
simply willing to be so. This we know is not possible; 
hence the corporate or collective will can not
govern till it has control of the means that will
secure the power to govern.</p>

<p>Our government does not possess this means: it is
forced to draw its revenues from the people by taxing 
the necessities of the poor, from those it lends
its aid to oppress, and pays the results of their hard
toil to millionaires as interest on money that should
have been its own, and will be when democracy is
in possession of its legitimate field of rule.</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>Then industry and economy will be the only conditions 
to wealth; positions of trust, the strongest
incentives to justice; and talent and ability receive
their highest rewards when seeking the public good.</p>

<p>This conclusion is no phantom of the brain. Our
Constitution, in point of principle, is an engine
already geared and belted, and attached to a forty-million 
power, and only waits the turning-on of the
steam to make us in love with the simplicity of justice.</p>

<p>“But how is it," the critic will ask, "that men
were induced to adopt a constitution so far in
advance not only of the then existing state of society, 
but even of the present, if, as you have stated,
society cannot be induced to take a step in advance
only to get rid of an evil experienced; if we are
really advancing according to society's legitimate
law of growth; if the evils under which we are now
suffering are not the result of a retrograde movement?"</p>

<p>The question is a legitimate one; and it will be
remembered by those who have read carefully what
has already been advanced, that we have stated that
there are different classes of evils of a national character, 
and that they come up in the order of their
magnitude, and are removed through experience.
As society advanced, this order continued its
work till the evil that came uppermost was a denial
of the right of freedom of speech upon religious and
upon State matters. I mean that this evil that had
long been submitted to as a necessity arising from
the divine right of the ruler, and the law of its preservation, 

<!-- page 47 -->

increased in magnitude till there was no
safety for any: then the people sought to remove it.</p>

<p>It was during this struggle for religious and civil
liberty that the continent of America was discovered; 
and it was settled largely by those who were
desirous of this liberty, and who improved the first
opportunity of securing it by establishing our present 
Constitution.</p>

<p>Thus you see that our Constitution was not
adopted to remove the evils under which we now
suffer; though, in my opinion, it provides for them
almost as well as though it had been.</p>

<p>It was written to protect the liberty of speech
and of the press upon matters civil and religious,
without which life and property seemed of but little
value. The liberty of speech and of the press is
alike to be enjoyed by the individual and the State;
and it would be disastrous to attempt to draw a line
between them. The individual may speak and write
upon any thing that concerns the interest of the
State; and those who represent the interest of the
State have the liberty to adopt or reject the views of
the individual as they in their deliberations may
decide is best, but may not deprive the individual or
the minority of the right of educating the majority
to think with them if they can bring convincing
arguments to that effect. And thus a healthy competition 
in the realm of mind is secured.</p>

<p>Allow me to say here, that, while admitting full
individual liberty in the mental sphere, it seems to
me that the liberty that permits a man to inflict suffering 
on another by the extension of the principle

<!-- page 48 -->

of competition into the field of physical necessities,
such as food, clothing, and shelter, is quite another
thing.</p>

<p>The ultimate consequences of competition in the
two fields of action are as different as are light and
darkness, or right and wrong.</p>

<p>The concussions of mind upon mind through
speech and pen are the true conditions that develop
the capabilities of mind, and are indispensable to
good government; while the expenditure of our
physical natures in the competitive struggle for the
necessities of life tends to both physical and mental
inability; it has produced our present inequitable
distribution of wealth, and is, in fact, an extension
of the principles of war.</p>

<p>Therefore, while we can not draw a line between
individual and collective right in the sphere of mental 
liberty, when we come to the field of our physical 
necessities, it becomes absolutely necessary to
draw a line between individual and collective rule.
Therefore, though our Constitution was not formulated 
and adopted to guard against the evils under
which we now suffer, it contains the elements by
means of which they can be removed as well as
though made for that express purpose; from the fact
that liberty of speech, both civil and religious, is
encroached upon through the undue power of
wealth not directly, but just as effectually; for
thousands are so situated that they dare not speak
their honest sentiments lest it take the bread from
them and theirs.</p>

<p>Real mental freedom can not exist so long as our

<!-- page 49 -->

physical welfare is subject to the control of others,
through the power of wealth.</p>

<p>Yes: our Constitution secures us the power,
through the action of a successful political party, to
bring in the reform desired. Our fathers secured to
us the right of liberty in the sphere of mind, but, for
want of experience, failed to confine the liberty of
the individual within its true province in the sphere
of wealth. Consequently the right to mental liberty
is in danger; and this danger must be removed, can
be through the channel provided.</p>

<p>But the power to organize a successful political
party does not lie within the province of any one
man, or class of men. It is incorporated into the
very constitution of society, and ripens into action in
perfect accordance with the magnitude of the change
to be effected.</p>

<p>We may decide, however, when the time to commence 
the preparatory work has arrived. We may
quicken the action to such ripening by pointing to
the evils to be removed, and indicating the method
of removal. Slavery was removed in this manner;
and I fully believe that the time has come to take
the initiatory steps to the next great change that
must come, or our national ruin instead.</p>

<p>If, when the principles involved in this essay are
laid fairly before the people, their attention is not
arrested, it will prove one of two things: the principles 
are not sound, or the nation has not ripened
to their acceptance.</p>

<p>But being convinced that they are sound, and that
the times are propitious for their presentation, I am

<!-- page 50 -->

satisfied that when even a few band themselves
together, with said principles as their basis of action,
they will fasten public attention upon them; and
that the work thus commenced will so organize itself
as to secure success eventually, if not immediately,
and that in much less time than it took for the
removal of chattel-slavery.</p>

<p>And with this, my honest conviction, I leave these
thoughts for your further consideration.</p>
