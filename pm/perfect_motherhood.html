<div class="small">

<p>Oh, mothers, prospective mothers, wake up to the power you possess, and
claim your heritage&mdash;the conditions for perfect motherhood. From out the dim
vista of the future comes the call of the advancing generations: "Prepare, prepare
the way." Oh, women of the world, arise in your strength and demand that
all which stands in the path of true motherhood shall be removed from your
path. Carry the spirit of this demand with you. Let the very atmosphere that
surrounds you&mdash;the sphere that is made up of the activities of your mental and
moral being carry with it a firm faith in the possibility of the better state of
society. Let your own children and prospective mothers all about you sense this
power, this feeling, this faith in humanity's power to rise, and if you do not
remain in the body long enough to witness the inauguration of the new, you will
see from your home over there, the harvest of the seed you have sown.</p>

<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader</span>: Do you ask why I continue to
write stories? Because of the influence of stories
upon me when I was a mere child. My parents
held the Abolitionists in contempt, and my father, to
express his disgust, would swear about the "d&mdash;&mdash;d
nigger." But I liked to read&mdash;most children do, if they
can have reading in story form&mdash;and through the influence
of little Antislavery stories which fell into my
hands I became in full sympathy with the Abolitionists
before I was a dozen years old, and when I was
twenty-seven years old I had the satisfaction of knowing
that not only my father, but every member of the
family (and there were six children), was in full
sympathy with the Antislavery cause, and that I had
helped to make them such.</p>

<p>Realizing how much truth in story dress did toward
abolishing chattel slavery, I now, while nearing my
threescore years and ten, would fain impress upon the
minds of the rising generation the necessity of furnishing
the conditions for <span class="smcap">Perfect Motherhood</span>; and I

<!-- page 6 -->

would have those mothers whose hopes have been
blasted feel that by buying and scattering books written
for that purpose they may help to remove the
causes which have wrecked their happiness.</p>

<p>Oh! mothers with aching hearts, aid one who suffers
for you, and with you, in removing from the path
of the coming generations those conditions which curse
mothers during gestation, and children from birth.</p>

<h2>PERFECT MOTHERHOOD;</h2>

<p class="small">OR,</p>

<p>MABEL RAYMOND'S RESOLVE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">MISS QUEER.</p>

</div>

<p>WHY call her Sal? it is not respectful."</p>

<p>"Call who Sal?"</p>

<p>"Miss or Mrs. Magundi"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"You said Sal Magundi"</p>

<p>At this the party addressed, a lad of thirteen summers,
threw himself upon the floor rolling and screaming
with laughter. "Oh, oh, it's too rich," he said,
and then looking up into the wide-open, wondering
brown eyes of his questioner, he went off into another
fit of laughter.</p>

<p>A girl of ten years, who, for her straightforward,
matter-of-fact ways, had been christened Miss Queer
by her laughter-loving brother, turned to a lady who
sat looking out of the window, and asked:</p>

<p>"What is Walter laughing at, mother?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Walter?" said the mother, quietly.</p>

<!-- page 10 -->

<p>"Oh, mother, it's too rich; Miss Queer will be the
death of me yet."</p>

<p>"But what is it?"</p>

<p>"I said"&mdash;oh, oh, holding his sides as he went off
in another fit of laughter&mdash;"I&mdash;I said Salmagundi, and
she asked me"&mdash;oh, oh&mdash;"why I did not call her"&mdash;ha,
ha&mdash;"Miss or Mrs., instead of Sal;" ha, ha, ha,
"it's too rich."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond smiled, and, turning to her little
daughter, said: "Never mind, darling, it was only a
mistake."</p>

<p>"What does it mean, then?"</p>

<p>"Salmagundi&mdash;it is a kind of food made of chopped
meat and pickled herring, seasoned with oil and vinegar,
and sometimes other things are added."</p>

<p>The child stood a moment looking very thoughtful,
then with half a smile she said:</p>

<p>"Well, I have learned something, and that is what
Walter has not done by laughing at me; but it was a
little funny." And the shadow of a smile broke into a
broad ripple over the rather plain features, making
them look really attractive.</p>

<p>Mabel's philosophizing somewhat sobered Walter,
though what she said was not exactly correct, for he
had learned as much as she had. But not liking to
acknowledge his ignorance he simply said:</p>

<p>"Come, Salmagundi, get your hat and we will go to
the park."</p>

<p>"And how many more names are you going to give
me?" she asked, as she turned to obey the request, but
her mother remarked:</p>

<p>"I think you have made a mistake, Mabel."</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<p>"In what, mother?"</p>

<p>"In saying that you have learned something while
Walter has not. I question if he knew the meaning of
the word he was using."</p>

<p>"Did you, Walter?" asked Mabel, turning toward
him.</p>

<p>Walter colored. "No, I did not, I only repeated
what the boys use as a sort of byword; I did not suppose
it had any particular meaning."</p>

<p>"And now that you do know, you call your sister by
it," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Why not, mother? She is about as queer as
chopped meat and smoked herring, or any other mixture."</p>

<p>By this time Mabel was ready, and the children
started for their walk. Mrs. Raymond smiled at the
remembrance of Mabel's blunder, and turned to pick
up a book which had fallen to the floor, when a lady
sitting outside upon the veranda which ran along another
side of the room, from the window out of which
she had been looking, remarked:</p>

<p>"Your Mabel is a very peculiar child, Mary."</p>

<p>"You there, Marion," was Mrs. Raymond's response.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been here for some time," said the first
speaker, as she stepped through the French window
into the room and took a seat beside her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mabel is rather peculiar," continued Mrs.
Raymond; "but the best-dispositioned child I have;
nothing seems to disturb her, and her reasoning powers
are remarkable."</p>

<p>"Strange what makes such a difference in children
of the same family," said the other.</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>"Well, yes, somewhat; and yet not so strange as
seems at first sight. My surroundings were entirely
different during the months preceding her birth from
what they were with either of the others, and I think
that accounts for the difference in her case."</p>

<p>"Your surroundings, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was very much out of health, and the doctor
ordered country air and freedom from all excitement,
and Mr. Raymond found for me a most delightful retreat.
I took Walter with me, and his father came
every Saturday night and stayed till Monday morning
with us, and altogether it was one of the happiest summers
of my life."</p>

<p>"What did you do with yourself without society?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never was such a votary to what is called
society as you are, Marion; and, so far from being
alone, I had what to me was the very best of society.
I had books and papers in abundance, and I never
tired of watching the chickens, geese, ducks, cows,
calves, and other accompaniments of farm life. I
walked when I pleased, and rode when I wished. I
went to the fields where they were making hay, or
into the dairy where they made butter and cheese, for
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Miss Hibbard burst into a hearty laugh.
"Pardon me, please," she said, when the outburst had
subsided; "but the thought of the elegant Mrs. Raymond,
the looked-up-to in society's circles, rambling in
the fields with the farmers, or sitting chatting with the
dairymaids was too much for my risibility."</p>

<p>"Laugh as much as you please, Marion, but I would
like to spend another summer in the same way, and far

<!-- page 13 -->

better than conforming, even as little as I do, to the
hollow conventionalities of society."</p>

<p>"Yes, I wonder at it, Mary, that society courts you
as it does. It generally resents a neglect of its claims."</p>

<p>"That is easily enough explained. I happen to be
so situated that I can do without society better than
society can do without me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see; your husband is a leading man here, so
his wife is a privileged character."</p>

<p>"But were it otherwise, Marion, I should never
court society."</p>

<p>"No, you are too proud to court anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you call it pride."</p>

<p>"But do you really think that your surroundings
had anything to do with Mabel's character?"</p>

<p>"Why not? When they are lying beneath the
mother's heart and living upon her life-blood why
should not her feelings affect them?"</p>

<p>"It may be true; and if so, I can see in your case
the why of Mabel's happy disposition, but not of her
simplicity in many things&mdash;her matter-of-fact way
that makes her seem so devoid of imagination."</p>

<p>"She has imagination enough in her way, but I have
not told you all. There lived just across the fields
from Mr. Wilson's large farm-house an honest Scotchman
and his wife, who both possessed the peculiarity
that is so noticeable in Mabel, and I used to spend hours
with them, listening to their quaint stories of Scotland,
second sight, and various other matters, all told with
such simple-hearted belief in the entire truthfulness of
what they were relating that I loved to listen."</p>

<p>"Second sight, what is that?"</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"It is the faculty which, they claim, some of their
people possess of seeing things before they come to
pass, also of seeing what we call ghosts&mdash;apparitions."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could you listen! It makes me feel uncanny
to think of it!" And Miss Hibbard glanced
uneasily around, as though she expected to see a ghost,
giving a perceptible start as Mabel stepped from the
veranda through the same window she had done when
she came in.</p>

<p>"Why, Mabel!" exclaimed Mrs. Raymond, "I
thought you went to the park with Walter."</p>

<p>"I started to go, mamma; but we met Hugh Barber,
and he wanted Walter to go somewhere with him, so I
came back and sat down out there just as Miss Hibbard
laughed out," and then going up to her mother she
said:</p>

<p>"Mamma, did I really grow beneath your heart?"</p>

<p>The ladies glanced at each other, and the mother
hesitated for a moment, but rising equal to the occasion
she put her arms around the child and asked:</p>

<p>"Where did you think you grew, darling?"</p>

<p>"I never thought much about it, but the minister
says God made us."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he would tell you that God makes the
trees and the flowers, but they grow all the same and
have a place to grow in."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell me, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Because mamma did not think her little daughter
was old enough to understand it yet."</p>

<p>"I do not understand it now, but I know it is so,
mamma, for you said so, and it makes me love you so
much," and seating herself upon her mother's lap she

<!-- page 15 -->

laid her head upon that mother's bosom, looking the
very picture of happiness.</p>

<p>Miss Hibbard, woman of the world that she seemed,
turned her head away and there were tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>For some moments mother and child sat thus in
close embrace, and no word was spoken. At length
Mabel raised her head and asked:</p>

<p>"Am I good, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, you are mamma's good little girl."</p>

<p>"And if your being happy and having what you
liked when I was growing makes me good, is it because
his mother had bad things around her that makes
Tommy Gone so naughty?"</p>

<p>There the two women looked at each other again,
and Mrs. Raymond said, "Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Why can't everybody have good and beautiful
things, mamma?"</p>

<p>"That is a bigger question than mamma can answer,
or little daughter understand if I could."</p>

<p>"You tell me there is always a reason for things, so
there must be one for that, and I mean to find it out,"
said the child straightening herself up as though she
felt a consciousness of undeveloped power.</p>

<p>"And what will you do then, daughter?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to make things better."</p>

<p>"Mamma hopes you can, but had you not better go
now and amuse baby till tea-time, so nurse can go
out awhile?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," and she hastened away as though it
gave her new pleasure to do something because mamma
wished it.</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>"There is logic for you, Marion," said Mrs. Raymond
as soon as Mabel had left the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was very much amused."</p>

<p>"It is not a very amusing thought to me that so
many mothers have such bad conditions under which
to do their best work."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't help it and what's the use of
fretting?"</p>

<p>"It is true that I am unable to change things, but
why is it so, Marion? If we knew the why, perhaps
we could help it."</p>

<p>"The preacher tells us that God appoints our estate,
and that all should be content in the station to which
they are assigned."</p>

<p>"He is a very unjust God then."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Mary, that the Rev. Mr. Hunter does
not hear you say a thing like that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond only smiled at this, and after a moment
Miss Hibbard continued:</p>

<p>"I wondered what you could say to the child when
she asked you about growing beneath your heart."</p>

<p>"What could I say but tell her the truth?"</p>

<p>"And now she will be talking it to others in that
honest way of hers."</p>

<p>"I will take care that she does not speak of it improperly,
Marion."</p>

<p>Again there was silence for a time, and then Miss
Hibbard remarked:</p>

<p>"If your theory is true I don't see how the world
can ever be made any better, for if you attempt to
give all mothers, or prospective mothers, good conditions
you have a big job on hand."</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>"Conditions are not all, Marion; the quality of the
parentage comes in for consideration."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I never expected to hear you discussing
such themes as this. For my part, I do not care to
bother with anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"And yet you started it."</p>

<p>"Me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, by remarking that you wondered what made
such a difference in children of the same family."</p>

<p>"I did not suppose, however, that you would attempt
to tell."</p>

<p>"I will say nothing further, and if you remain in a
state of single blessedness a few years longer you will
not need to trouble yourself about such matters, so far
as you are personally concerned."</p>

<p>"That is saying I am an old maid, Mary."</p>

<p>"I believe you used to be some three months the
oldest when we went to school together, and I have
been married fourteen years."</p>

<p>"I used to be the oldest!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I do not know how it is now; people some
times stop getting any older," said Mrs. Raymond,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"How many children have you, Mary?" was Miss
Hibbard's next question.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I have some of them hidden
away, that you ask that, Marion?"</p>

<p>"No, but I want you to remember that every child
adds two years to a woman's age, so with the three
living and the two you have lost, you are now nearly
ten years my senior," she replied, with a sparkle in her
eye.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>"So that is the way you try to cheat Father Time,
is it?"</p>

<p>"That is one of the ways; but here come callers, so
a truce to nonsense."</p>

<p>"It is more likely to be just where the nonsense, or
no sense, begins," was Mrs. Raymond's response.</p>

<p>The callers were Mrs. Hunter, the minister's mother,
and "Mrs. Professor Thompson, of Hartford, Connecticut,"
as she was introduced by Mrs. Hunter. "Of
course the fact that she was the wife of a college professor
must be told," said Miss Hibbard, as soon as
they were gone.</p>

<p>"As was the fact that you was nobody's wife,
when I introduced you," quietly remarked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what nonsense are you talking now; how
else could I be introduced?"</p>

<p>"Than as Miss Hibbard, in no other way unless you
adopt the Quaker style, but it told your position all
the same."</p>

<p>"And do you consider it a disgrace?" she asked,
petulantly.</p>

<p>"You know, Marion, that I do not," replied Mrs.
Raymond; "but tell me, please, why it is that a man is
Mr. as soon as he is of age, while a woman is never
Mrs., or Mistress, till she marries?"</p>

<p>"And how could she be?"</p>

<p>"She ought to be mistress of herself when she becomes
of age, had she not?"</p>

<p>"How many more new-fangled notions have you
got into your head, I should like to know, Mrs. Raymond?"</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>"There is no need of being offended, dear."</p>

<p>"I am not offended, but I must say I am astonished
to hear you talking like a ranting free-lover. Is the
world to be turned upside down?"</p>

<p>"I fear, Marion, that it will have to be, and inside
out, before it gets much better."</p>

<p>Walter came in just then and asked: "Where is
Salmagundi?"</p>

<p>"In the nursery, if you mean Mabel," said his
mother; "but why, Walter, do you continually nickname
your sister?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fun, and she takes it so quietly; it don't
hurt her, she's so good, you know; for little girls are
made of</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">" 'Sugar and spice, and all things nice,' "</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>he sang as he danced out of the room.</p>

<p>The nurse girl had returned, and Mabel was just
coming in, so they met at the door, she hearing the
words he sang.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "that I am made of chickens,
goslings, calves, fruit, flowers, and new-made hay."</p>

<p>"And pigs," shouted Walter, going off into one of
his immoderate fits of laughter.</p>

<p>"Were there pigs there, mother?" asked Mabel
with a simple earnestness that made even Mrs. Raymond
smile.</p>

<p>The child stood with a wondering look on her face,
as much as to say, "What are you laughing at," as her
mother replied: "Yes, dear; but mother didn't pay
much attention to them."</p>

<p>"Then I am not made of part pig, for mother didn't

<!-- page 20 -->

like the pigs much," she said, turning to her brother
with a triumphant air.</p>

<p>"Not made of part pig, what do you mean?" said
the now astonished boy, seeing that there was some
thing serious involved.</p>

<p>"Why, mother says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, dear," interrupted Mrs. Raymond, "we
will not talk about it anymore now, mother will explain
another time."</p>

<p>"Can Salmagundi go to the park with me after tea,
mother?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"I will see about it," was the reply, while Mabel
added: "I am not made of chopped meat, pickled
herring, oil, and vinegar. You didn't have anything of
the kind that summer, did you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I did not; but I thought we were not to talk of
that any more now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot. I wasn't good then."</p>

<p>That night Mrs. Raymond took Walter and Mabel to
her own room and explained to them as much of the
mystery of life as she thought suited to their years;
showed them some plates illustrating the subject;
talked to them of the sacredness of their persons; told
them how proud and happy she was in her children;
told them of the injury that any of their creative
organs would be, not only to themselves but to their
children, should they live to become parents; cautioned
them about talking on such subjects with their playmates,
etc., and when she had finished, Mabel threw
her arms about her mother's neck and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, it is beautiful, what you have told us
about our wonderful bodies."</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>But Walter, true to his irrepressible boy-nature,
said: "I don't care, Meb, I shall call you Salmagundi
all the same."</p>

<p>As there is always a cause for things, even for the
existence of a rose in a desert, it were perhaps well to
trace the antecedents of those of whom we have been
speaking, so as to be able to explain, or at least to
understand, the equally strange phenomenon of such
deep, such radical thought in the very heart of New
York society.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Tall oaks from little acorns grow."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Independent thought, that which dares to question
existing beliefs and methods of action, has wondrous
vitality; otherwise progress would be impossible, as
each new idea is forced to walk through the fiery furnace
of intense opposition&mdash;of hatred.</p>

<p>Mary Vernon was the descendant of the persecuted
Quakers of New England on her mother's side, and
her father was a sea-captain whose wide experience
with the world did not admit of very bigoted views.
He was successful in his calling, and for those days
quite wealthy, and he determined that his children
should be well educated, he not having had the opportunity
to acquire more than the common rudiments as
obtained in the district school.</p>

<p>His only daughter, now Mrs. Raymond, had been
educated at Holyoke, Mass., and Marion Hibbard was
a school-mate. They had contracted the warm friendship
that opposite natures sometimes do, for in their
mental make-up two could hardly be more different.

<!-- page 22 -->

Still, Mary always called out the best that was in
Marion, while the latter's frivolity never seemed to
annoy her.</p>

<p>Mary could realize something of the nobility of the
founder of that celebrated school&mdash;Mary Lyon; but
Marion only looked upon being there as a sort of unpleasant
necessity. She must be educated, of course,
and why not there as well as anywhere.</p>

<p>When they graduated, Marion went to her home in
Boston, and indulged in the round of parties and balls
which the wealth of her parents enabled her to do,
while Mary Vernon went to Newport, R. I., and devoted
herself to her sick mother, and from that mother's
last hours she learned that one need not be strictly
orthodox in belief in order to die happy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vernon seemed to catch sight, as she neared
the confines of another life, of many of the causes
which produce so much sorrow in this; and these
thoughts she imparted to her daughter. During the
year of mourning, Mary, at the urgent request of her
friend Marion, spent a few weeks in Boston. It was
there that she met Mr. Raymond, a rising young lawyer
of New York, who was also visiting friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond came also of a stock that had dared
to think for themselves, though they did little more
than <i>think</i>, for outwardly they conformed to religious
customs in all but in becoming actual participants in
church ordinances. The young man was first attracted
to Miss Vernon by a remark she made that was in direct
opposition to the belief of those about her. He
was pleased with her quiet independence of thought,
and the very thing which alarmed her friend Marion,

<!-- page 23 -->

lest she should make herself unpopular, was the means
of securing her a good husband&mdash;"the best catch of
the season," Marion said, when she attended the wedding.</p>

<p>"If I had supposed you would do that I would not
have invited you to Boston till I had tried my powers
upon him," she laughingly continued.</p>

<p>"Well, Marion, I shall not be in your way anymore,"
was the response.</p>

<p>"Oh, but there's no one left worth having now!"</p>

<p>"Thanks for your high compliment to my husband,"
rejoined the now Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>This conversation occurred at Mary's home, and just
after the ceremony, where Marion had acted as bridesmaid,
while the newly made wife was changing her
wedding dress for a travelling suit, preparatory to a
short trip with her husband before going with him to
their New York home.</p>

<p>From that time on there had been visits, then letters,
until the summer in which our story opens, when
Marion was spending a few months with her friend,
"Mrs. Judge Raymond."</p>

<p>Remaining unmarried her years of parties and society
frivolity had begun to pall on her senses, and
that summer with her friend had now and then called
out a remark which showed that she was capable of
comprehending more important subjects than the last
new style of dress, and what Mrs. Fashionplate had
worn at the last party&mdash;showed that she was capable
of, but not enamored with thinking.</p>

<p>Judge Raymond was in Washington City upon business
that it would take him some time to complete,

<!-- page 24 -->

and that was one of the reasons urged by Mrs. Raymond
when inviting Marion to visit her. "I shall be
alone much of the time, with the exception of the
children," she had said.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond's friends were anxious that he should
represent his State, or the district in which he resided,
in Congress; but this he refused to do, and they did
not urge the matter for they knew that when he said
a thing he meant it.</p>

<p>The judge had two reasons for refusing. One was
he was much attached to his family and did not like to
be absent when it could be avoided, and neither he nor
Mrs. Raymond thought the moral atmosphere of Washington
good for the children. New York was bad
enough, but here there was a sort of wall about them,
as it were. Mrs. Raymond was not expected to live as
much in society when at home as she would be in the
capital of the nation as the wife of a Congressman.</p>

<p>His other reason was: in his decisions as judge he
had gone adversely to cliques and parties in favor of
justice, and he knew that the influence of said cliques
would be exerted against him; consequently, if he
would succeed he must match intrigue with intrigue,
and this he had no desire to do. So Judge Raymond
escaped the added prefix of "Hon.," and another, a
less capable and less honest man, went to sit in the
national council, and Mrs. Raymond remained contentedly
at home, ready to turn that, which otherwise
might have proved evil, into good for her children.</p>

<p>The night following the Salmagundi incident Mabel
was the only one whose rest was undisturbed. She had
said I mean to find out why&mdash;she intended it&mdash;so she

<!-- page 25 -->

accepted what she had learned&mdash;and expected to learn
more&mdash;in a spirit of such genuine trust that no anxious
thoughts disturbed her.</p>

<p>Walter, on the contrary, was so intensely alive to the
new ideas he had received that sleep was impossible.
He was not only lifted entirely above any feeling of
vulgarity in connection with the subject, and his
mother invested with a new dignity in his eyes, but his
mind went out toward birds, bees, flowers, and all animal
and vegetable life, inwardly determining to solve
the mystery of them all.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to trace the course of Miss Hibbard's
musings, but that she was wakeful she herself
asserted the next morning at the breakfast-table; while
to Mrs. Raymond's mind the subjects started seemed
to stretch out in illimitable proportions, and their continued
growth in the minds of the people pointed to
changes to accomplish which there must come such an
upheaving as made her shudder as she contemplated.</p>

<p>Finally she dropped into a disturbed slumber, from
which she awoke with a start, seeming to hear the
words: "The judgment of the present system of unrighteousness;
look soon for the beginning of the end."</p>

<p>A few months afterward, when she heard of the
firing on Fort Sumter, the scenes of that night came
back to her with a vividness that made her cheek turn
pale.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE YOUNG PHILOSOPHER.</p>

</div>

<p>I CAN'T understand this, wife," said a Kansas
farmer when looking over his accounts
preparatory to finding where his interest
money was coming from.</p>

<p>"Can't understand what, James?"</p>

<p>"When our candidate for Congress was here he
said prices varied, but that in the long run the medium
was about fair. For instance, if wheat is seventy-five
cents per bushel one year, and one dollar and
twenty-five the next, it made an average of a dollar,
and in the end it was as well for us farmers as though
it was a dollar all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so far as the wheat is concerned, but not in
the cost to me; not when it comes to paying debts."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"You know, Lucy, it is now four years since I borrowed
that five hundred dollars, agreeing to pay ten
per cent. interest, and in wheat at the market price.
The first two years wheat was a dollar a bushel, and it
took fifty bushels a year, just one hundred bushels for
the two years. Last year wheat was twenty-five cents
per bushel higher, and of course it took but forty

<!-- page 27 -->

bushels of wheat to pay the fifty dollars of interest.
This year wheat is but seventy-five cents per bushel,
and if Congressman Waldron was correct, sixty bushels
ought to pay the interest this year, thus making a hundred
bushels for the two years, the same as the first
two."</p>

<p>"Well, won't it?"</p>

<p>"No, it will not. I have been figuring here, and I
find it will take sixty-six and two-thirds bushels, at
seventy-five cents per bushel, to pay fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"How is that? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Neither do I; that is what I said at first, wife."</p>

<p>"That you could not understand&mdash;yes, I believe it
was; but wheat certainly does average a dollar a
bushel, if twenty-five cents above that price one year,
and twenty-five cents below it the next. You must
have made a mistake, James."</p>

<p>"I certainly have not."</p>

<p>"I think I understand it, father," said a lad of fourteen,
who sat by the window seemingly absorbed in
watching the teams that were passing, but who in reality
had been intently listening.</p>

<p>"You do!" said Mr. Gray, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"I think I do, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, we will hear your explanation, Mr. George;
perhaps your book-learning may be of some use after
all."</p>

<p>The manner in which his father said this was anything
but encouraging, and the boy hesitated.</p>

<p>"Speak out, boy," urged Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>Thus prompted, George Gray said: "It is simply
the difference in the proportion that twenty-five cents

<!-- page 28 -->

sustains to the higher and the lower price of a bushel
of wheat."</p>

<p>"The proportion&mdash;what has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"How many twenty-fives is there in a hundred and
twenty-five, father?"</p>

<p>"Five, of course. I am not so big a fool as not to
know that."</p>

<p>"Don't, James; let the child go through with his
explanation," said Mrs. Gray, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"The rise, then, as to the price of a bushel is one
fifth, consequently it takes one-fifth less number of
bushels to bring fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is plain enough, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, father, please. Twenty-five cents
is one-third of the lower price, and by the same proportion
it will take one-third more bushels to bring
fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"How is that? Tell it again, George."</p>

<p>"At a dollar and a quarter a bushel, four-fifths of a
bushel will bring a dollar&mdash;forty bushels, fifty dollars;
but at seventy-five cents a bushel it takes one and a
third bushel to bring a dollar; so you see it takes.
one-third more bushels to bring fifty dollars. But one-third
of fifty is sixteen and two-thirds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's so," said Mr. Gray, scratching his
head, "and yet it bothers me."</p>

<p>"It is the difference between one-fifth and one-third
that makes the difference in the number of bushels it
takes to make the two payments, more than it would if
the price was a dollar all the time. To make matters
even, the rise must be in the same proportion to the
higher price as the fall is to the lower price."</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"How is that, George?" asked Mr. Gray, now
thoroughly interested.</p>

<p>"The rise must be one-third the higher price to balance
a fall one-third the lower price."</p>

<p>"And what would that be in this case?"</p>

<p>"The rise must be fifty cents."</p>

<p>"What! you don't say that it takes a rise of fifty
cents to balance a fall of twenty-five cents?"</p>

<p>"It will prove itself, father, in this case that is,
with the price at a dollar. Two-thirds of a bushel will
bring a dollar with wheat at a dollar and a half a
bushel, and it will take one and a third bushel to
bring a dollar at seventy-five cents a bushel; and two-thirds
of a bushel and one and a third bushel make
two bushels."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true, George, and yet fifty bushels of
wheat at seventy-five cents a bushel, and fifty bushels
at one twenty-five per bushel make just a hundred dollars
for a hundred bushels; I can't see yet where the kink
lies."</p>

<p>"If the man to whom the interest is coming would
take thirty-seven and a half dollars&mdash;just what fifty
bushels of wheat will bring at seventy-five cents a
bushel&mdash;if he would take that the first year, and the
sixty-two and a half dollars the second year, just
what the same number of bushels will bring at an
added price of twenty-five cents, then it would be all
right; but no, he must have his fifty dollars each
year, no matter if it takes a hundred bushels to pay
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see now! If debts would rise and fall with
prices, it would be all right, but as they do not, we

<!-- page 30 -->

farmers lose more by the low prices than we gain by
the high," said Mr. Gray, his brow clearing.</p>

<p>"That is just it, father, and better than I could say
it."</p>

<p>In most homes the youngest child is the favorite,
but it was not so with farmer Gray. Born of the work
spirit, as most of the New England farmers had been
from the necessity of the case, he was never so happy
as when seeing his work "go ahead," as he expressed
it; and moving to the fertile plains of Kansas had not
changed his nature in the least. It was still work,
work.</p>

<p>His two older boys and his married daughter were,
like himself, great workers; "but George, well, I don't
know what ails him, there is no work in him," he used
to say to his wife, who would quietly reply:</p>

<p>"Oh, George will come out all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose you think so, but he's not one bit like
me; he's more like that lazy schoolmaster who boarded
with us before George was born."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray would laugh. She knew he did not mean
half his words implied. It was true, that, being shut
out from society as she had been much of the time
after coming to Kansas, she had really enjoyed having
the schoolmaster there; but she would as soon
have thought of turning the sun backward in the heavens
as of being false to her husband, and he knew
it. Still, with a sort of perverseness peculiar to some
natures, he didn't like the schoolmaster because she
did.</p>

<p>"That may be," she would reply to her husband's
peevish taunt; "but really he is more like you in form

<!-- page 31 -->

and features than any of the others, and the best looking
child we have."</p>

<p>Here he would mutter something about "stuff, flattery,"
and again that low, rippling laugh as she added:
"He was homely, and you know it, but a good talker,
and much more intelligent than some of the teachers
we have had, to say nothing of the rest of the society
here at that time, and I did enjoy his company, but&mdash;well
you are so cross I don't think I'll tell you ."</p>

<p>"Might as well say it all when you are about it," he
replied, trying to look crosser than ever, then catching
her mischievous look, he had to laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't," he said; "that look was what entrapped
me into marrying you, and I am not proof against it
even yet."</p>

<p>"That set you to trying to get me," she amended;
"but as you are good-natured now, I will tell you what
you don't deserve to know. I used often to look at
you when talking with him, and think you so much the
best-looking, and that I think is what makes George so
good-looking."</p>

<p>"Soft soap," he said, leaving the room, more pleased
than he liked to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Still George was not his favorite, but the aptness he
had shown in the matter over which he himself had
been so puzzled raised the boy in his estimation somewhat.
In thinking the matter over he found himself
saying:</p>

<p>"I wonder if slick-tongued politicians would fool us
as they do if everybody was taught to really think? I
studied 'rithmetic as much as the other boys did, but I
never understood the law of proportion before. Let me

<!-- page 32 -->

see: it was not the proportion that the price of wheat
sustained, one bushel to another, but the relation the
lower price sustained to our debts. Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell that fellow he lied," he said one
day when talking of the matter.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, father; I don't think he meant to lie,"
said George.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to lie! Of course he did," said Mr.
Gray, indignantly. "Those political chaps will say
anything to get our votes."</p>

<p>"I don't think he understood it himself, father."</p>

<p>"What! up for Congress and not understand that!
I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"My teacher says there are real truths and apparent
truths, and that unless we examine carefully we sometimes
mistake the apparent for the real."</p>

<p>"It does seem at first sight that what he said was
right," said Mr. Gray, after a moment's thought; "but
then, up for Congress," and he shook his head.</p>

<p>"It really is a puzzler," said a neighbor, "and I
can't quite get it into my head yet."</p>

<p>"Can you get it into your head clearly that the sun
does not rise and set, Mr. Jones?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I never try to, and yet I know it is the world instead
of the sun that moves; but it makes no difference
to us which way we think about it."</p>

<p>"But in this case it does," said Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"Not any practical difference, father."</p>

<p>Mr. Gray opened his eyes very wide, as if to say
what next, and George continued:</p>

<p>"If we could regulate prices it might&mdash;could regulate
prices, or make debts rise and fall with prices."</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>"That is another view of the case."</p>

<p>"Suppose, Mr. Gray, when Mr. Waldron comes into
the neighborhood again, you invite him here and we
will test the matter. We can find out if he meant to
deceive us as to the rise and fall of prices," said Mr.
Jones.</p>

<p>"I will do it, neighbor; he is to be here the last of
the month."</p>

<p>The time came, and with it the Hon. Mr. Waldron,
the man who had been representing the people in Congress,
and who was seeking for re-election. Mr. Gray
managed to get a few hours of the gentleman's company
at his own home. Neighbor Jones and several
others were there to learn for themselves if the man
was honest or a political trickster. He little thought,
as he smilingly talked with his host and the honest
farmers who had come, as he supposed, to do him
honor, how many votes hung upon the decision of the
next hour.</p>

<p>After supper the men took seats in the shade of the
house, and Mrs. Gray, instead of clearing the table,
spread a cloth over the whole to keep the flies out of
things, and then seated herself in the door near them,
while George took a stool and sat at her feet with one
hand resting upon her knee.</p>

<p>Mr. Waldron looked up as if a little surprised, but
remarked:</p>

<p>"I am always glad to see the ladies taking an interest
in these questions, and our young friend here will
soon be a voter, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help make laws for his mother," interrupted Mrs.
Gray.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>The gentleman parried this thrust by saying: "The
future of our country depends upon them, and the
work that woman can do in preparing them for their
responsible position gives her the pre-eminence."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray smiled in a way that showed she was fully
aware of just how much the compliment was worth,
seeing which Mr. Waldron colored.</p>

<p>"Our boys, some of them think faster than we do
now," said Mr. Gray. "George solved a problem for
me the other day, over which I had puzzled my brains
in vain."</p>

<p>"Ah, how is that?"</p>

<p>"If you remember, sir, you told us when you was
here before that if we got six shillings per bushel one
year for our wheat, and ten shillings the next year, it
was as good for us as though we got a dollar a bushel
all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I find that it is not, sir."</p>

<p>"I should like to see the proof, Mr. Gray. If so
self-evident a thing can be proved false, I think most
anything can."</p>

<p>"I think I can soon show you, Mr. Waldron, that
while fifty bushels of wheat at seventy cents a bushel,
or six shillings, as we Yorkers say, and fifty bushels at
ten shillings a bushel, will bring just an even hundred
dollars, still it is not so much to our advantage to have
the price vary thus as it is to have the price steady at
a dollar."</p>

<p>"I cannot see the difference."</p>

<p>"Suppose I contract a debt of fifty dollars when
wheat is a dollar a bushel, how many bushels of

<!-- page 35 -->

wheat will it take at six shillings per bushel, to pay
it?"</p>

<p>"Sixty-six and two-thirds," he said, after a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>"Suppose the next year I have another fifty dollars
to pay and wheat is ten shillings a bushel?"</p>

<p>"It will take only forty bushels to pay it."</p>

<p>"Forty and sixty-six and two-thirds are how many?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and&mdash;" The gentleman stopped,
colored to the roots of his hair, stammered something,
and then remained silent, but with an expression of as
blank astonishment upon his face as though he had
suddenly discovered that two and two made five.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Gray, "that buyers get over
six bushels more wheat from us for the same money
with the fluctuating price than if the price is held
steady, even if the rise for a given time does balance
the fall for the same length of time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see; but who would have thought it? There
is a principle involved that I must look into, gentlemen"
said the Congressman, turning to the listening
company.</p>

<p>"He is honest," was their thought, "and we will
vote for him."</p>

<p>The conversation now became general, while each
seemed to have some particular thought to present; but
the interest in the previous question soon reasserted
itself, and George was requested to state the proportion
between a rise and fall of prices that would make
things even.</p>

<p>Mr. Waldron listened attentively. "The proportion
of the rise to the higher price must be the same as is

<!-- page 36 -->

the fall to the lower price," he repeated; "give us an
example, please."</p>

<p>"How many bushels of wheat will it take at a dollar
and a half a bushel to bring fifty dollars?" was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Thirty-three and a third, is it not?" said the Congressman,
and then&mdash;"yes, that number added to sixty-six
and two-thirds makes one hundred."</p>

<p>"And fifty cents is one-third of the higher price,
while twenty-five cents is one-third of the lowest price,"
continued George.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, that proves itself, as I see; but will
it prove itself if the rise and fall be still greater? For
instance, if wheat falls to fifty cents one year and rises
to two dollars the next, will your rule apply?"</p>

<p>George thought a moment: "That supposition does
not come within the rule," he said.</p>

<p>"How is that? The rise is double the fall, as in the
other case."</p>

<p>"True, sir; but the rise is half the higher price,
while the fall is equal to the whole of the lower
price."</p>

<p>"Sold again," said Mr. Waldron, who had so far recovered
from his embarrassment as to laugh at his own
blunder.</p>

<p>The crowd laughed heartily and Mr. Waldron continued:</p>

<p>"You are right, Master Gray; my supposition does
not come within your rule; but, as I see that this rise
and fall of prices has a great deal to do with the welfare
of you farmers, suppose we examine its workings
a little further. What would the difference be to the

<!-- page 37 -->

farmer in the number of bushels of wheat he must
raise to pay, say fifty dollars a year, if one year wheat
brings but fifty cents per bushel, and the next year it
should rise to two dollars per bushel, how much more
wheat would it take than if it remained at a dollar a
bushel?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five bushels, sir!"</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"If wheat remained at a dollar a bushel, it would
take fifty bushels each year&mdash;one hundred for two
years. If it were fifty cents the first year, it would
take a hundred bushels to pay fifty dollars, and the
year wheat was two dollars it would take twenty-five
bushels, making a hundred and twenty-five bushels for
the two years."</p>

<p>"But suppose the farmer raises two hundred bushels
each year to sell, how then will the rise and fall of
prices affect him?"</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Waldron, there are too many things
to be considered to properly answer that question in
the time we have to spare now," said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a question that demands thought, friend;
more and closer thought than I, at least, have hitherto
given it, but I would like to hear the boy's reply."</p>

<p>"That will do no harm, to be sure, as he, with the
rest of us, will have plenty of time to think about it
after this."</p>

<p>"Plenty of time before things can be made right,
I think," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>George here remarked that at the prices named the
farmer would handle more money in disposing of the
same quantity of wheat than if the price was uniformly

<!-- page 38 -->

at a dollar, but it was a question if he would save
more; and Mr. Gray said:</p>

<p>"You forget, sir, that the cause which so increased
the price of wheat would be very likely to decrease its
quantity; a drouth for instance, that would cut the
crop short."</p>

<p>"I have forgotten in my previous calculations many
things that should have been considered, but shall
try to do better in the future. One thing, however,
has a direct bearing upon this matter, which I see has
much to do with the result. The farmer's taxes, interest
upon noted bonds, debts, and his other necessary
expenses do not vary with the prices of what he has to
sell; and debts, obligations incurred when prices are
high often prove his ruin when prices fall, for his land
will produce no more wheat at fifty cents a bushel,
than it will, other things being equal, at two dollars per
bushel, and yet it takes four times as much wheat to
bring the money to pay a given amount of tax or interest."</p>

<p>"It is a deep problem; I can't see bottom," said
Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"I know it is, but I mean to find the bottom," replied
the Congressman.</p>

<p>"Will thinking do any good, Mr. Waldron, if we
stop here?"</p>

<p>"How, now, Master George; what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Will thinking out the effect of the fluctuation of
prices do any good, if we can do nothing to regulate
them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my young philosopher; but perhaps
we may learn how to do that too. This is a wonderful

<!-- page 39 -->

age of discovery and improvement, and we shall
have you in Congress by and by to help us. But I believe
I have another audience to talk to to-night, so
shall have to forego the pleasure of further discussion
now."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that farmer Gray felt
very proud of his son. He had at first felt a sort of
chagrin that George had explained what he could not
understand; but when he found that Congressman
Waldron had understood the question no better than
himself it took away the sense of humiliation that had
annoyed him.</p>

<p>The next week brought Mrs. Gray's birthday, and
some one remembered her by sending her a book. Mr.
Gray brought it from the office.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "it must be from your cousin
Mary, and no doubt, contains some of her new-fangled
notions."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked the book over to find something
to indicate the sender; but there was nothing. "I
shall probably get a letter soon," she remarked, and
then began to examine its contents. Her husband
looked over her shoulder, and read:</p>

<p>"The Influence of the Conditions and Surroundings
of the Mother during Gestation upon the Character of
the Child."</p>

<p>"I wonder what next!" he said, in an irritable tone.
Mrs. Gray made no reply, but laid the book aside and
went on with her work.</p>

<p>A few days afterward Mr. Gray asked: "Do you
think, wife, that is a proper book for George to read?"</p>

<p>"What book do you mean?"</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>"The one you got the other day through the mail;
I see he has it."</p>

<p>"Most certainly I do; and I want you and the other
boys to read it, and then I shall send it to Julia."</p>

<p>"It may be well enough for the older boys and
Julia, but he is quite too young to have such books
put into his hands," was the decided reply.</p>

<p>"Read it, please, and then tell me if you think so,"
she said, gently.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I've no time to read it, and where's the
use?"</p>

<p>"Read it to please me," she urged.</p>

<p>He still dissented, and she said no more; but the
next day she saw him looking it over. She made no
comment, but watched without seeming to. Presently
she saw he was getting so interested that he used every
spare moment in reading it. Still she said nothing.
"Wife," said he, when he had finished it, "I wish I
could have read such a book when I was of George's
age; I think I should have done differently in some
things from what I have."</p>

<p>"And so should I," she replied; "but I think I understand
now why George is so different from the
other children. But I will say first, that I do not think
the writer of that book has gone to the bottom of the
question."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is like George's problem, has no bottom."</p>

<p>"I believe it is that in which we get interested, or
that which we dislike in and of itself that affects the
embryo, and not that we study conditions with our
minds upon the child."</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"How is that, wife? I do not quite understand."</p>

<p>"I think we cannot make the child what we wish by
making that our aim&mdash;by keeping the mind fixed upon
a model. No, we must like a thing for its own sake&mdash;because
it is good, right, beautiful, and dislike a thing
because it is wrong, and not because by liking or disliking
we may affect the child."</p>

<p>Mr. Gray looked at his wife with a puzzled air, as
though he still did not comprehend, and she continued:</p>

<p>"Suppose I want to make a mathematician of my
child, and I study mathematics. I do not like the
study&mdash;do not feel interested; still, for the child's sake,
I keep studying&mdash;worry myself in doing so&mdash;do you
believe my child will like mathematics?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," was the hesitating reply.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. It would take on my feelings till dislike
would be the result. As I drove myself to the
task, so would the child have to be driven to the task.
But suppose I take to studying mathematics because I
wish to understand for myself, and as I get an insight
into its general principles I become very much interested,
but I do not once think how it may affect my
child. That is Nature's work, not mine, and I leave it
with Nature; but in giving Nature material to work
with I have put in a love of mathematics. She weaves
it into the child's make-up, and it is a born mathematician;
do you understand the difference?"</p>

<p>"I think I do. In the first instance you try to oversee
the work; in the second, you furnish the needed
material and let Nature do her own work."</p>

<p>"Exactly; and now I can explain the cause of the

<!-- page 42 -->

difference between George and the other children.
When we first came here, as you know, James, our
whole thought was for the home. I was interested in
my work because it would help to make the home
what we wished it to become, and the more work I
could accomplish the better I was pleased. I did not
work because I wanted to make the children workers.
I never once thought of that; but our first children
are workers."</p>

<p>"And you got tired of work before George was
born, did you?" he said, half-laughingly.</p>

<p>"I did; I was not well and my work was a task, and
but for Mr. Randal's boarding with us that winter I
do not know how I should have kept up."</p>

<p>"Yes, that old school-teacher again!" but he said it
in a different tone than ever before.</p>

<p>She paid no attention, but continued: "He managed
to get me interested in books that he had, gave
me new subjects of thought; in fact, roused portions of
my brain to action that had lain dormant for years,
and I became very much absorbed in the problems his
talk suggested. I scarcely thought of my condition
for days at a time, but George takes naturally to that
in which I was so interested. He solves almost intuitively
problems involving the principles over which I
pondered."</p>

<p>"But he don't like to work," interrupted Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"He does not like your kind of work; but he does
like mental labor, and that is work as well as is digging
potatoes."</p>

<p>"So you bookworms say, and I guess it's true, for I
had rather dig potatoes all day than study two hours."</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"I believe you," she said; "but here comes George
with a letter."</p>

<p>"And I think it is about that book, mother. It is
postmarked New York," said George.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray opened the letter, and after scanning its
contents said: "Yes, the letter is from the one who
sent the book&mdash;from a cousin Mary, but not the one
you was thinking of, James."</p>

<p>"I did not know as you had but one cousin Mary."</p>

<p>"You forget. I have told you, I am certain, of
cousin Mary Vernon, who came with her mother to
visit us the summer before we were married. Mary
was only eight years old, but she seems to remember
all about it. Her mother and mine were sisters, but
that is the only time I ever saw them."</p>

<p>"How happened the families to become so separated?"</p>

<p>"I really do not understand the whole story, James;
but I think there was some property question involved.
Something that produced hard feelings between her
father and mine in the first place, and then, soon after
Aunt Rebecca was married they moved to Rhode Island,
and we went to Vermont, so we were a long way
apart."</p>

<p>"But they found you out once, Lucy, it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes, but mother and aunt had not seen each other
for more than sixteen years, and never met afterward."</p>

<p>"But what does she write&mdash;this cousin of yours&mdash;mother?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lucy, what does she write?" reiterated his
father.</p>

<p>"It's kind of queer," said Mrs. Gray, scanning the

<!-- page 44 -->

letter again; "her mother and mine were born Quakers,
as you know, but both married out of the church, and
this cousin Mary is the wife of a New York Judge. I
will read you a passage:</p>

<br/>

<p>" 'Cousin Lucy: Thee may think it strange, but had
I remained in the Quaker Church I should say, the
Spirit moveth me to write to thee, and to use the plain
language. The Spirit moveth me to say that somewhere
in the future our life-lines will run very close
together. I think this a gift of prophecy that belongeth
to our people, and though I have not remained
in the fold the Spirit followeth me.</p>

<p>" 'Last week a gifted Quaker lady visited my home
in connection with business pertaining to the escape of
some slaves, and of whom the masters were in pursuit.
Since her visit I feel this Spirit upon me, and it impelleth
me to write to thee. Thee knowest that our
Quaker ancestors have ever opposed that which they
saw to be wrong&mdash;that they defended the oppressed and
opposed the oppressor&mdash;that our people still do the
same. Now, cousin, my husband says, and I feel it
to be true, that this Antislavery agitation will bring
war&mdash;that it cannot be far away; in fact, if Abraham
Lincoln is elected the South will rebel&mdash;&mdash;' "</p>

<br/>

<p>"Let them rebel; we are ready," said Mr. Gray,
starting to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down, James; war is not declared yet," said
his wife, laying her hand upon his arm, "cousin further
says that her husband, Judge Raymond, will do
all that lies in his power to help elect Lincoln, notwithstanding

<!-- page 45 -->

what he foresees will be the result, for better
war than African slavery fastened forever upon this
nation."</p>

<p>"God bless him for that," said Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"And yet war may mean terrible things to us," said
his wife, in a saddened tone.</p>

<p>The man dropped his head in his hands, and for
some minutes no word was spoken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray again scanned her letter. "Here are
other singular passages," she said, and read as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>" 'It may seem very strange to thee, cousin Lucy,
that I, who have not mingled with the people of my
mother's faith since early childhood, should feel the
Spirit so moving me now; but it can seem no more
strange to thee than it does to myself, and the Spirit
moveth me to say that the coming war, which will
blot out chattel slavery, is but the beginning of the
end.</p>

<p>" 'There are other slaveries to be abolished. Woman
must be freed from all that mars her work as a mother.
The book I sent thee will explain what I mean, and
the same spirit that prompted our ancestors to rebel
against the lordly claims of men&mdash;the same spirit that
has prompted our people to be the steadfast friend of
the slave and helped to propagate the truths that tend
to the breaking of his bonds&mdash;that same spirit will animate
us in working for this grander freedom. And
now I will tell thee what prompted the state of mind
that gave the Spirit power to move me thus&mdash;that
made my heart feel till I travailed in agony, as it were,
for the coming generations&mdash;till my very soul went out

<!-- page 46 -->

to grasp the heart of the world. It is said of individual
cases if we touch the heart we can succeed. I
would touch the heart of the world.</p>

<p>" 'But to the incident that has proved the impelling
cause. My little daughter Mabel, but ten years old,
overheard me speaking of the effect of conditions upon
the child when growing beneath the mother's heart.
She came right to me and said, "Mamma, did I grow
beneath your heart?" Thee may rest assured, cousin,
that I told the child the truth. She also got the idea
that she was good and happy because my conditions
were good before her birth, and she asked me if it was
because his mother had bad conditions that made
Tommy Gone so naughty. I have no words to tell
thee the feelings that were called up by that question;
but it so opened up my heart that the Spirit could
enter, and I tell thee, cousin, the heart of the world is
wrapped up in what is involved in the question of my
child.</p>

<p>" 'But I shall weary thee, so will say no more now.
Write me if the Spirit move thee, and remember me to
James and the children.</p>

<p class="right">" 'Your cousin,<br/>
" '<span class="smcap">Mary Raymond</span>.</p>

<p>" '51 Blank Street, New York City.' "</p>

<br/>

<p>"You have read it all," said Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"Nearly so. There is a little in the first part that I
have not read, but here is the letter; I expected you
to read it."</p>

<p>"The heart of the world," he repeated, not heeding
that she held the letter toward him, "the heart of the

<!-- page 47 -->

world," and turning on his heel he walked out of the
house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked after him wonderingly, but made
no comment, and George, taking up the book he had
been reading before he went to the post-office, was soon
lost in its contents.</p>

<p>Nothing further was said of the letter till weeks
afterward, but it made a deep impression upon them
all.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">COVERED PATHS.</p>

</div>

<p>THE bond of sympathy between Mabel Raymond
and her mother seemed to increase
in strength after the explanation related
in our first chapter had been made, and
Mrs. Raymond often found herself saying,
"thee" and "thou," instead of you, when speaking
to her daughter.</p>

<p>The child noticed it and asked what it meant.</p>

<p>"It is the Quaker way of speaking, dear, and thee
makes me think of my mother. I think thou art
growing to look like her," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Was grandma a Quaker?"</p>

<p>"Her parents were, but as she married a man of the
world&mdash;that is, one who was not a Quaker&mdash;she was cut
off from the church; but she often used their language,
their way of speaking."</p>

<p>"Cut off, mamma, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The children of Quakers are members of their
church by what is called birthright; but if they do not
obey the rules of the church they are declared to be
members no longer, and it is called cutting them off."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand now. So grandma was cut off
because she married grandpa; wasn't he a good
man?"</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"One of the best of men, dear."</p>

<p>"I can't see why they should punish grandma for
marrying him, then; but you sometimes talk to me
the Quaker way, and sometimes the other, why do you
do that, mamma?"</p>

<p>"And you sometimes call me mother, and sometimes
mamma, why do you do that?"</p>

<p>Mabel stood for a little time entirely still. Not a
muscle of her body moved, but one could see by the
look in her eye that her mind was active.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, at length, "it is because I am
growing to be a woman, and when I feel most like a
woman I say mother."</p>

<p>Miss Hibbard, who had been listening to this conversation,
laughed out at this unlooked-for explanation,
but her mother said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pretty good reasoning, Mabel; now I think thee
can answer thine own question."</p>

<p>"What question&mdash;oh, I forgot; it must be because
you sometimes feel like a Quaker, and sometimes not."</p>

<p>"I think that is right, and mother has felt more
Quakerish than usual to-day," said Mrs. Raymond,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Why mamma? there must be a reason for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose there is, but I do not know what it
is."</p>

<p>"Why do you not say it is the Quaker feeling you
gathered from your mother before you were born
coming to the surface?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"It may be that; we have much to learn in that direction."</p>

<p>Just here the bell rang, and presently the servant

<!-- page 50 -->

came to say that a lady in the parlor would like to see
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Did she give her name?"</p>

<p>"She did not, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How does thee do, Mary Raymond?" interrupted
a pleasant voice. "I knew thy mother, and I wanted
to see thee right in thy sitting-room. I am Hannah
Davis, from Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see thee, Hannah," was Mrs. Raymond's
ready response; "this is my friend, Marion Hibbard,
and this my daughter Mabel."</p>

<p>"How does thee do, Marion? how does thee do,
Mabel?" giving her hand to each, and then looking at
Mabel a moment she said: "She is much like what
thy mother was at her age, Mary."</p>

<p>"So you knew my mother, Mrs.&mdash;I beg your pardon,
Hannah."</p>

<p>"I prefer being called Hannah. Yes, thy mother
and I were children together, but when we married she
went one way with her husband and I another with
mine, and we never met but once afterward, and that
was when thee was a baby; but, Mary, I wish to talk
with thee a few minutes, and then I will see thee
again before I leave the city. I cannot tarry now."</p>

<p>"Then I will take thee to my own room; Marion
will excuse us, and we shall not be interrupted there."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that old Quaker woman wants to
say to Mrs. Judge Raymond," was Miss Hibbard's
thought, as they left the room; but her wonderment
was doomed to remain unenlightened.</p>

<p>There are covered paths in life, and the fact of their
remaining covered depends very much upon the belief

<!-- page 51 -->

that they do not exist. Judge Raymond was a man of
influence and unquestioned integrity, but there were
subjects upon which he seldom, if ever, expressed an
opinion. Not a slaveholder's tool in all that city would
once have thought of searching his premises to find a
fugitive slave; but to that fact scores of slaves owed
their final escape to Canada.</p>

<p>The public never once dreamed that certain unused
rooms in Judge Raymond's elegant mansion were
really a depot for the underground railroad. Neither
did the other members of the family, except Phillis,
the black cook, and her husband Pomp, who was Mr.
Raymond's coachman. But the tried and true friends
of the slave knew, and that is why Hannah Davis went
there at that time. There was a reward of a thousand
dollars offered for certain fugitives. They were but a
few miles away, but not where it was considered safe
for them to remain.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour after the Quakeress left
the room with Mrs. Raymond, Pomp drove up to the
office of the Judge. In passing the window which gave
the Judge a view of the street, Pomp managed to pull
a rein in a way that made one of the horses rear, and
then spoke to him in a sharp, chiding tone that caught
the Judge's ear. He raised his head and looked in the
direction from whence the sound came. Pomp put up
his hand as if brushing something from his face, and
then sat quietly till the Judge appeared.</p>

<p>"On time, as usual," he remarked, and loud enough
for those standing near to hear, and the closest observer
would have seen nothing to indicate that Pomp
had not come by previous arrangement.</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>Pomp drove back to the house. Mrs. Raymond
came out and took the back seat, while her husband
sat upon the front one, his back to the driver and facing
her. It was a chilly day, and they were plentifully
supplied with blankets and robes, but the carriage-doors
were both left wide open.</p>

<p>Pomp drove off at a brisk trot. In something over
two hours they returned, sitting as when they started,
and no one dreamed that a human being lay at the feet
of each, crowded down in the closest space possible&mdash;a
man and his wife&mdash;of each of whom the master was
the father, and fleeing to prevent being sold apart.
The estates to which they belonged joined. They
were kindly treated, and had never had a thought of
running away till learning, accidentally, that they were
to be sold and sent in different directions; then they
escaped together.</p>

<p>No, there was not the least suspicion, as they were
driven leisurely past the officers in search, that the palpitating
hearts of their desired victims were beating
beneath the rich robes in Judge Raymond's carriage;
but so it was.</p>

<p>"You are safe now, my friends; no one will think
of seeking you here," said Mrs. Raymond, as upon her
first visit to the room assigned them they wept,
trembled, and poured out their thankfulness in words
broken by emotion. When she left them, "Covered
paths, covered paths," were the words that seemed to
be whispered in her ears; and as she mused upon the
events of the day, there came also those other words:
"Covered in the secret places of the Most High," and
filled with a meaning strange and new.</p>

<!-- page 53 -->

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Hearts as open as the sunlight<br/>

Forced to wear a masking face,<br/>

But the dove will hide her nestlings<br/>

Lest the vulture's eye should trace."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Covered in the secret places of the Most High."&mdash;what
a sense of peace and rest the words brought, and
how slow she would have been in exchanging the feeling
for any amount of worldly honor.</p>

<p>Right here we cannot forbear relating another carriage
story connected with those Antislavery times.
True, it is not exactly in line with our present story,
but it illustrates the use of covered paths, and also the
part played by our Quaker friends, who so often successfully
matched stratagem against force.</p>

<p>An Antislavery speaker in an old Connecticut town
had good reason to expect violence. Parties from the
town in which he had his next appointment had said
he should not speak in their place, and they came in
force to this meeting. Their purpose was to waylay
him and treat him to a coat of tar and feathers. An
old Quaker lived next to the hall in which the meeting
was held, and there was a high board-fence around his
lot, shutting off all ingress except through a gate, which
was kept locked, and through the house. The friends
of the speaker learned of the danger and informed
Obadiah.</p>

<p>Pointing to a wide board in the fence, he said: "I
think we can circumvent them; drive the carriage
close up beside that and I will look out for the rest."</p>

<p>On the night in question the carriage was placed as
indicated, and the driver remained to see that the harness

<!-- page 54 -->

was not cut or other damage done. When the
lecture was over the friends of the speaker walked on
either side of him to the carriage, into which he sprang
and the door was closed. One of their own number
purposely made a diversion which caused, perhaps, two
minutes' delay, and then the driver cracked his whip
and they were off. Numbers of the crowd followed;
two or three in light carriages, the others on horseback.
When about a mile from town one of the men rode
ahead and commanded the driver to stop, at the same
moment grasping one of the horses by the bits. Others
yelled: "Come out here, you nigger-lover, and get your
new dress;" "And a free ride," still others added, while
one of the party rode up and throwing the carriage-door
open, flashed the light of his lantern upon the inside,
paused a moment in surprise, and then called out:
"Boys, there is no one here."</p>

<p>The man who held the horse by the bits involuntarily
dropped them to get a look within, and the driver,
watching his opportunity, struck his horses a sharp
blow, which started them upon a run. The disappointed
crowd looked into each other's faces in mute
surprise and forgot to follow.</p>

<p>"That is strange," said one, at length.</p>

<p>"I saw him get in," said another.</p>

<p>"So did I," "And I," "And I," went from mouth
to mouth.</p>

<p>"He must have slipped around from the back side
and got into the other carriage," remarked another.</p>

<p>"That's the way it was," they all decided; then they
went, each to his own home, fully resolved to watch
closer next time.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>The wide board in the Quaker's fence was unsuspected;
but at the right moment it had been removed
to let the speaker through, and was then as quietly
replaced. Some of them did say they knew "the
damned Quaker" was at the bottom of it; but they
had no proof; and Obadiah Jenkins was too good a
citizen, had too many friends, to be molested on suspicion
only. True, they might have done him some secret
injury, but that would not have accorded with
their spirit of bravado.</p>

<p>This was what the Quakers called non-resistance,
and what others called passive resistance, but it finally
so pervaded public sentiment&mdash;its influence so touched
the hearts of the people that it roused the slaveholder
to active resistance against the silent force which had
for the most part chosen covered paths, and in the
struggle slavery went down&mdash;chattel slavery did.</p>

<p>History can never do full justice to the part played
by our Quaker friends in that struggle&mdash;not so much
in the actual struggle as in preparing the way for it.</p>

<br/>

<p>A few days after the secretion of the fugitives of
whom we have spoken, Mabel came to her mother and
asked if Quakers were thieves.</p>

<p>"Quakers thieves! What makes you ask such a question?"</p>

<p>"Luna Bell says that if one should steal a horse and
another should hide it, or if a horse should run away
and some one should put it where the owner could not
find it, that would be stealing, and that it is as bad to
steal slaves as it is horses."</p>

<p>"And what has that to do with the Quakers?"</p>

<!-- page 56 -->

<p>"She says a great many slaves run away and the
Quakers hide them, so that their masters cannot find
them."</p>

<p>"I hardly think Luna understands what she is talking
about. She has been taught to think it right to
buy and sell men and women, and she don't know any
better."</p>

<p>"Buy and sell men and women!" exclaimed Mabel,
with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, child, what did you think they were? You
certainly know that the slaves are negroes," continued
Mrs. Raymond, "for you have learned that much in
your geography."</p>

<p>"Slaves negroes; yes, how silly I am. But, mamma,
I never thought to call them men and women; but they
are, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, men and women, like Pomp and
Phillis, and little children, too, are sold as we sell
horses; but that does not make it right."</p>

<p>"Of course it does not, and I shall tell Luna so."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I would not say anything to her about
it; it is not necessary that she should know you do not
think as she does."</p>

<p>"Not tell her it is wrong, mamma!" exclaimed Mabel,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mamma knows, dear, what is best. Suppose the law
made white people slaves instead of black people, and
your papa and mamma should run away to keep from
being sold, papa to one man and mamma to another,
what would you like to have those black people do
who did not believe it right to hold slaves, if we
should go to their house?"</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>"I should want them to hide you, so the bad black
men could not find you."</p>

<p>"And if they did so, and they had a little girl who
should go and tell the black people who thought it was
right, that it was not right, don't you think those who
were hunting us would believe the little girl's folks
had hidden us, and so would come and find us?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If my little daughter will come with me I will show
her what I mean; I know I can trust you," and she
took the child where the fugitives were, and told her
why they were there; "but thee must tell no one, not
even Walter."</p>

<p>"Now thee is a Quaker, mother," said Mabel,
laughing.</p>

<p>"And thee feels like a woman," was the laughing
reply.</p>

<p>"But why do you tell me and not Walter, mother?"</p>

<p>"Because you are very different from Walter. Do
you remember, Mabel, what you said when you asked
me why every one could not have beautiful things and
good conditions around them?"</p>

<p>"I think I said I meant to find out why, because
there must be a reason."</p>

<p>"When, daughter?"</p>

<p>"When I get old enough to understand, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And when you do find out, what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother, I shall try to help fix things so that
everybody can have good things, of course."</p>

<p>"You have a great deal to learn, my child; but I see
where your work lies, and you can begin by teaching
those poor people to read."</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>"Why, mother, can't they read?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Those who held them as slaves did
not want them to read, any more than they did their
horses."</p>

<p>"Will not Walter find out? Why can't he help
me?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; Walter means all right, but he is too
thoughtless. He would forget and say something that
would lead people to suspect, and then we could not
help others. I will fix it so you can stay awhile with
them each day, and I think they will learn very fast.
It will be some time before they can leave here with
safety."</p>

<p>From that time on for more than a month Mabel
spent a portion of each day in teaching William and
Lucy Peters to read, and the progress they made was
simply astonishing. About this time Miss Hibbard
returned to Boston, otherwise Mabel's task of secrecy
would have been much more difficult.</p>

<p>The day before the presidential election there came
the waited-for opportunity to start Peters and his wife
on their way to Canada, and the second day after they
were gone, when Judge Raymond came home at night,
he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Lincoln is elected; there will be war, and the
slaves will be freed; but it will be at a terrible cost to
the nation."</p>

<p>Walter noticed something in his father's tone that
prompted him to ask: "Do you want them to be free,
father?"</p>

<p>"I do," he replied, remembering as he did so that
his boy had not even suspected what his views were on

<!-- page 59 -->

the slave question, so secretive had he been; and he
blushed at the thought&mdash;felt small in his own eyes.
"And yet, what good would it have done?" he reasoned
with himself.</p>

<p>Three days afterward he said to his wife: "One of
the most influential Democrats in the city called at the
office this morning, and the first words he said were:
'So you are going to set the slaves free.' "</p>

<p>"What reply did you make?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I said, 'What put that into your head?'</p>

<p>" 'Your boy told mine,' he said, 'that now Lincoln
was elected there would be war, and the slaves would
be freed. Said you said so. Is that your intention?'</p>

<p>" 'I have no intention in the matter, Mr. Broughman,'
I said, but I know the Southern spirit so well,
I am satisfied they will rebel, and that will bring war.'</p>

<p>" 'And you hope the slaves will be free,' he continued.</p>

<p>"I told him I thought it would be better for the
country, and he sprang up in a rage and said: 'After
this, when slaves are missing, your house shall be
searched;' so you see I have defeated myself and the
Friends by speaking out."</p>

<p>"Well, some one must speak out, and I am tired of
so much secretiveness," replied Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"But it has spoiled our only way of helping, wife."</p>

<p>"It may have spoiled our way of helping individual
slaves, but not in helping to remove slavery. We
have done very little compared with those who have
spoken out, and persistently."</p>

<p>The Judge was silent. Waiting, and finding he made
no reply, she continued. "The heart of the world

<!-- page 60 -->

must be reached, the thought must be sent out and
embodied, and that can be done only through agitation.
Do you know, dear, that the most of those of Quaker
descent who have such a dislike to tyranny, not only
drank it in with their mother's milk, but from her
blood while lying beneath her heart; that it thus became
a part of their very selves."</p>

<p>"I know that is the teaching of some, but there are
so many counter-influences."</p>

<p>"True, but the stirring appeal makes its impression
upon woman when man would hardly feel it. As I see
things, those early and persistent agitators had to create&mdash;that
is, so impress upon woman's sensibilities the
wrongs of slavery, that children born during those
years were born with a nature that could easily be
moulded into Antislavery voters, and in that sense
they created the agents that are to be used to destroy
that which they have so persistently opposed."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are counting largely on what
might have been, perhaps was done, as you think; are
you not, wife?"</p>

<p>"How long is it since the agitation of this question
began?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not remember exactly, something near thirty
years."</p>

<p>"Well, husband, we will say twenty-six. How many
thousands who are voters now, suppose you, came under
the direct influence of those appeals through the
mother's heart-beats upon the plastic&mdash;the partly
formed&mdash;brain?"</p>

<p>"You bewilder me, Mary, I never thought of it in
that light."</p>

<!-- page 61 -->

<p>"I only wanted to show you how much more important
the work of the agitator, how much wider in its
results than that done by those who have walked in
covered paths."</p>

<p>"And yet we have helped to save those very agitators
more than once."</p>

<p>"True, so when one comes to look on all sides it is
hard to say who has done the better work; but I think
the time has come when it will be well to show our
colors."</p>

<p>"That may be, but our house will be searched for
the next slave that is suspected to be in the city."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I think we can stand it. They will
never find a slave that I undertake to hide."</p>

<p>The Judge laughed. "Trust a woman for strategy."
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the strategy of success when she really sets
about a thing, and this Antislavery struggle is but a
ripple on the surface of what is to come after."</p>

<p>"Of what is to come after&mdash;are you prophesying
too?"</p>

<p>"And why not I as well as you, Judge Raymond?."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be sarcastic, wife; could I have
my say I could select a good many women who could
fill positions of public trust much better than those
who now hold them," he replied.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me why I cannot prophesy
as well as you."</p>

<p>"I do not prophesy in any true sense of the term; I
only trace known causes to their inevitable result."</p>

<p>"Suppose, husband, a decree should go forth that
from henceforth all prospective mothers should be surrounded

<!-- page 62 -->

by good conditions, pleasant society, inspiring
music; have all they needed, and be free from
wearing toil; I do not mean a part, but all, every
woman, everywhere, who was carrying the burden of
maternity, do you not think it would cause a greater
upheaval than anything connected with chattel slavery
can?"</p>

<p>"Of course it would, Mary; but that cannot be till
the millennium comes."</p>

<p>"But the millennium cannot come till we work to
bring it, any more than slavery can be abolished without
our efforts; but suppose I tell you that the child is
born who has formed the purpose to find out what it is
that prevents all women from having just the conditions
I have named, and when she finds what this preventing
cause is, she determines to work for its removal,
would you not think I had reason to prophesy
great effects from such a cause?"</p>

<p>"From the whim of a child, no."</p>

<p>"Have not all great effects started from a single
point or germ, Richard?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they have, but who is this wonderful
child?"</p>

<p>"Your daughter Mabel."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Your daughter Mabel, a descendant of George
Fox; he whose intensified opposition to a hireling
ministry, and refusal to have marriage solemnized by
them, so far revolutionized the marriage laws of England
as to secure a recognition of the Quaker formula;
he whose followers have done so much toward educating
public sentiment to a point whence you declare

<!-- page 63 -->

that slavery is doomed, and whose women hold the
right to preach as well as the men, a right that even
now is beginning to be claimed by other sects&mdash;do you
think such a spirit will die out or increase in volume
as the years roll on? No, the thought is born that
woman must have good conditions in order to give the
world good work, and that thought will accomplish its
purpose if it has to overturn every government upon
earth."</p>

<p>"Hold, hold, Mary, or I shall think George Fox is
looking at me through your eyes, and speaking to me
through your lips."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is," she replied, as she turned to listen
to the wants of her youngest child, while he took up
his hat in an absent manner and went to his office like
one in a dream. Soon after an old friend came in, and
the conversation turned upon the recent election and
its probable results. "I have no patience with those
abolition fanatics," he said.</p>

<p>The Judge opened his mouth as if to reply, then, remembering
his recent experience, remained silent, and
his friend continued:</p>

<p>"If I believed them honest, I should feel differently
about it, but when they so persistently declare that
negro slavery is a sin against God, I can see that they
are simply religious bigots."</p>

<p>"How do you come to that conclusion, Mr. Lent?"
asked Mr. Raymond, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"If you will go through this city with me, Raymond,
and see the squalor, the poverty and wretchedness
that exist in some portions of it&mdash;will examine life in
tenement-houses, some of which are church property,

<!-- page 64 -->

and then will ask me that question, you are not the
man I suppose you to be."</p>

<p>"But the church is not the most active in this matter.
Indeed, the greatest opposition to the agitation
of the slave question has come from the churches."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it has, but those who do oppose negro
slavery know of these conditions here at home&mdash;know
that church members own much of the property
where these conditions exist, are living upon the money
paid them by those who live crowded together like
cattle&mdash;this while they are building churches and sending
missionaries to the heathen. And why do not our
abolitionists denounce these wrongs and their perpetrators?
We hear but little of what is right here at
home&mdash;of wrongs here as bitter as any the negro endures."</p>

<p>"Men and women are not bought and sold here like
cattle, Mr. Lent."</p>

<p>"Not like cattle, for in such case one piece of flesh
sells another. In the kind of slavery I am talking of,
people are obliged to sell themselves."</p>

<p>"To sell themselves!" said the Judge, as though he
did not quite comprehend.</p>

<p>"Yes, the men their labor, and the women their
persons."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"And by a combination of circumstances, sir, over
which they have but little or no control. I, sir, would
as soon be sold by another as to be forced to sell myself
or starve."</p>

<p>"I am surprised to hear you speak in this way," said
the Judge, not knowing what else to say.</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>"How many, suppose you," continued the other,
"of those who have taken in fugitive slaves and cared
for them for weeks, would have aided, or given employment
to, a woman who was a fugitive from a
brothel?"</p>

<p>"Not many, I fear."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir; not many, and yet which is in
the worst kind of slavery? No, it is not a genuine
love of the race, but a morbid idea that they are serving
God, which animates in all reforms and will, so
long as God is put above humanity."</p>

<p>"I did not know you were an infidel, Mr. Lent."</p>

<p>"I am infidel, Judge Raymond, to a religion which
teaches that we must be born again, and to the institutions
built upon that idea. A second birth may do for
the next world, but for this, one needs to be born right
in the first place."</p>

<p>"And how can that be done?" asked the Judge,
half mechanically, for it could not be said that he
was really thinking. So many and various were the
ideas that flashed through his brain, he was bewildered.</p>

<p>"Give every woman the conditions for the highest
grade of motherhood, or, rather, accord to her her
right to a share of the law-making power, and she
will do the rest&mdash;<i>the mother heart will not fail when
it has scope equal to its power</i>."</p>

<p>"Just what my wife says," exclaimed the Judge,
starting to his feet; "but have you any idea of what
it involves?"</p>

<p>"Where there is a will there is a way, Judge Raymond.
There was a time when the idea of destroying

<!-- page 66 -->

chattel slavery was not thought of, but now it will go
in less than five years."</p>

<p>"But think what the other&mdash;the right conditions for
motherhood&mdash;will cost."</p>

<p>"Think what it costs to have things as they now
are, please; but I must bid you good-day, Judge," and
the gentleman bowed himself out.</p>

<p>Judge Raymond was too excited to continue his
writing, so he took his hat and tried to walk his excitement
off; but every turn he made he was confronted
with scenes that, though common, now had a
new meaning, and the question kept pressing itself
home: "How can children be rightly born amid such
surroundings;" and in a sort of desperation he turned
and went to his home. Mrs. Raymond was surprised
to see him back so soon, but in answer to her inquiring
look he only said:</p>

<p>"I am not very busy, so I have been walking;
please have Phillis tell Pomp he need not go to the
office," and throwing himself down upon the sofa, he
took a book and tried to read, but his wife's keen eye
detected a something unusual; still she said nothing.</p>

<p>Waiting till tea was over, and the children in bed,
she then asked: "What is it, Richard?"</p>

<p>"What is what, wife?"</p>

<p>"Something has disturbed you."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, and then went onto relate
what had occurred at the office. "And coming so
soon after what you had said, it has made me think a
little more deeply than I am accustomed to doing,"
he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lent is right in some things, but I think he

<!-- page 67 -->

misjudges the motives of those he pronounces fanatics,"
she said, after thinking over what had been told
her; "people cannot handle too many things at once,
but they will keep trying till the right thing is done,
and one work only prepares the way for another and a
greater."</p>

<p>"Prepares for a greater, wife; there can be no
greater than that which you are planning. I am appalled
at the thought of what it will cost."</p>

<p>She made no reply, but he remembered what Mr.
Lent had said of what things cost as they are.</p>

<p>But it was not long ere the reverberations of the
guns fired upon Sumter aroused the nation. The war
came, and the slaves were freed. They were the harvest
of previous agitation&mdash;that which will bring the
full freedom of women is yet in embryo. That harvest
is in the future. Out of the life-currents of woman's
being flow, not only the tidal-waves of death,
as in the past, but of a full-orbed life, as it shall yet
be&mdash;as it will hasten to be when all women ask the
question asked by the child-woman, Mabel Raymond.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">SOWING SEED.</p>

<p class="small">"Behold, a sower went forth to sow."</p>

</div>

<p>ABOUT twenty women were assembled at
the home of James Gray, and all busily
at work preparing the material which was
to fill a box with comforts for the "boys in
blue;" substantial evidence that those at
home had not forgotten them. There were, among
the more solid articles, little mementoes the significance
of which only the recipients understood&mdash;letters,
photographs, needles, thread, paper, pens, and whatever
else love could suggest.</p>

<p>Not a woman there but had husband, brother, son,
or lover upon the battle-field, or lingering in the hospital,
or dying slowly in some Southern prison. Yes,
it was a Christian war, and pious chaplains of the gospel
of love were paid to pray over the dying soldier. Not
one there but had a friend upon the list, and some had
several. Susan Fosten had two brothers and a lover,
Mary Drake a husband and two cousins, and so on; and
not one present who felt sure that any of theirs would
return, while not one dared to hope that all would.</p>

<p>The company to which the box was going had been
made up in that and adjoining towns, and of the women
there assembled each felt an interest in them all as

<!-- page 69 -->

well as in the members of their own particular families;
and sometimes the silent tear fell as they worked, and
then again there would be laughter as some amusing
incident occurred.</p>

<p>What a mystery is human life! How readily it
catches flashes of sunlight, even when the clouds mass
the heaviest. The rainbow, or even the forked lightning,
are made the means of diversion. It is said of
one of the old martyrs that, when being broiled upon a
gridiron to satisfy religious hate, he said to the one
who had doomed him to this fate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Well, this side enough is toasted,<br/>

Turn me, tyrant, then, and eat,<br/>

And see if either raw or roasted<br/>

I am the better meat."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Be the legend true or false, there is certainly a wondrous
power in the human heart to find light in the
midst of darkness&mdash;to triumph over the bitterest agony&mdash;to
cover graves with flowers, or to root them in the
very soil which covers our blighted hopes, and from
which there floats out upon the air a sweeter fragrance,
and the eye is gladdened with a finer, tenderer phase
of beauty because of that which lies beneath.</p>

<p>During a lull in the conversation one of the party
saw through the window another woman approaching,
and asked, "Who is that coming?"</p>

<p>This drew the general attention, and Letitia Barnes,
who lived farther away than the others, remarked: "I
wonder what is bringing her here?"</p>

<p>"You know her, then," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"I have met her several times at Uncle John's, over

<!-- page 70 -->

in Windsor, but did not know as she ever got so far
from home."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"The Widow Hovey; I presume you have heard of
her; most people in this part of the country have."</p>

<p>"Yes, poor woman, I know something of her history,
though I never happened to meet her; but as you say,
Letitia, I wonder what is bringing her here?"</p>

<p>"To sow seed, I presume."</p>

<p>"To what?" exclaimed two or three of the others
at once.</p>

<p>"To sow seed, as she calls it; to tell mothers how
to live, that their children may be good."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"They say she is crazed with grief since her son
turned out so badly, and says that he is the harvest of
seed sown and grown under bad conditions, and that
right ideas sown in the minds of those who are to be
mothers will give better results in the future," said
Mary Drake.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she thinks children can be born naturally
good; it's contrary to the Bible," remarked Polly
Wheeler, a spinster of fifty.</p>

<p>"Hush, or she will hear you," said another, in a
whisper. The door was open, and Mrs. Hovey had
paused upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, ladies," she said, running her eye
over the group as if to take them all in.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mrs. Hovey," said Letitia, rising
and stepping forward; "you will remember meeting
me at Mr. Jackson's, in Windsor; he is my uncle."
And turning to the group, she continued:</p>

<!-- page 71 -->

<p>"Mrs. Hovey, Mrs. Gray; ladies, Mrs. Hovey."</p>

<p>"We are glad to meet you, Mrs. Hovey," said Mrs.
Gray, extending her hand, while the others bowed;
"this way, please, and have a seat close by me, for I
think I shall be interested in what you have to say, and
I want to hear it all."</p>

<p>"Are you deaf?" asked the old lady, taking the
proffered seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but you know so many women together
do a good deal of talking, and they sometimes forget
to wait one for another; but let me have your things,
and as you have been walking some distance, rest a little
while I get you a cup of tea; then you will be all
right, and I shall be delighted to listen to you; for I
think, from what the ladies tell me, you and I must be
thinking in the same direction."</p>

<p>The poor woman's face lighted up with pleasure.
"Who sowed the seed in your mind?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind that till you rest and have your tea,"
and with an answering smile, Mrs. Gray disappeared in
the direction of the kitchen. Presently she returned,
bringing with her a steaming cup of tea and just such
a piece of pie and cake as farmers' wives know so well
how to make and deal out, and placing them before
her guest, she said:</p>

<p>"Now don't mind us, but take your time and enjoy
your lunch, and we can talk after a while."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hovey looked at what had been brought and
sighed: "Yes, I will try to enjoy it, but I wish Willie
had some of it; he has only prison fare now, poor boy.
The fathers eat sour grapes and set the children's teeth
on edge; the mothers starve, and the children steal."</p>

<!-- page 72 -->

<p>"Never mind, sister, the past is past, but the future
is ours, in which to do the best we can."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Gray, and I must not waste my strength
in fretting, but save it and sow all the seed I can;" and
she took up her spoon and began sipping the fragrant
beverage. The others went on with their work, but
there was very little conversation. Some of them were
wondering what Mrs. Gray meant by saying she believed
her thoughts ran in the same direction with
Mrs. Hovey's, but Polly Wheeler was watching the
opportunity to controvert the idea that children could
be born naturally good.</p>

<p>"We are born depraved," she said to herself; "there
is no good in us, and such doctrine is dangerous."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hovey, all unconscious of what Polly was
thinking, finished her repast, and shoving back from
the stand upon which the things had been put, said,
with a tremor in her voice, reverting to the subject
that was ever uppermost in her mind: "Could I have
had such good victuals before Willie was born, he would
not now be where he is."</p>

<p>"Didn't you teach your boy it wasn't right to
steal?" asked the impatient Polly.</p>

<p>"Always," responded the unhappy mother.</p>

<p>"Then you need not blame yourself and go to laying
his faults to bad conditions; it's dishonoring to God,
Mrs. Hovey."</p>

<p>"But it was bad conditions; it was born in him, and
that is why I feel so badly about it. He could not help
it; he is not to blame."</p>

<p>Miss Polly was taken a little aback at this view of
the subject, but she rallied: "God's grace is sufficient,

<!-- page 73 -->

Mrs. Hovey, so that is no excuse; I fear you did not
teach him rightly," she continued.</p>

<p>"I tried to," was the meek response.</p>

<p>"But did you trust in God yourself? If we doubt
him he will not answer our prayers."</p>

<p>"If he answered our prayers we should trust him,
Miss Wheeler; the trouble was I trusted too much and
knew too little."</p>

<p>"Trusted in God too much!" exclaimed Polly, dropping
her work and holding up her hands in horror.
"Oh, you wicked woman! trusted in God too much;
What do you mean? I don't wonder you are punished."</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say, and I wouldn't mind
being punished if I have done wrong; but why punish
Willie? You are the one who dishonors God."</p>

<p>"Me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a just God would never punish a child because
of a parent's mistakes."</p>

<p>"Mistakes, Mrs. Hovey; what you say is downright
wickedness, it is blasphemy; and your boy is punished
for his own sins, not yours."</p>

<p>People said Mrs. Hovey was crazy, and the cunning
twinkle of her eye, at times, would seem to justify the
idea that she was not wholly right; and yet she could
outreason the minister at any time, could outquote
scripture and turn it in favor of her own positions.
Was she deranged, or had suffering only quickened, intensified
her intellect? She sensed the fact, in the
present instance, that neither Polly nor her iron-bound
creed were popular with the company present, so, casting
her eyes around the room with that peculiar twinkle,
she said:</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"Miss Wheeler, are you God's lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hear the woman!" almost shrieked Polly.</p>

<p>"I thought you might have been employed for that
purpose, you are so earnest in his defence," continued
Mrs. Hovey, with imperturbable gravity.</p>

<p>With the most present this seemed a little impious,
and yet they could but laugh. "Come," said Mrs.
Gray, "tell us all about it, and then we shall know
better what you mean."</p>

<p>This quieted the others, and Polly, too, subsided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hovey looked up into Mrs. Gray's face, not
quite understanding if she was shocked or no, and then
said:</p>

<p>"Friends, I know there is a power above and beyond
us as well as you do; and I know also that only so far
as we obey that power do we escape suffering; but the
laws which are a manifestation of that power are not
written in books, as I have long since learned."</p>

<p>"So you deny the Bible," interrupted Polly.</p>

<p>"Please don't interrupt her," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"I don't understand the Bible as you do, Miss Wheeler,
but there are natural laws that must be obeyed in
the production of human beings as well as in the production
of plants and animals&mdash;but to explain what
I meant by saying I trusted God too much: Nature
furnishes the material, but we must build our own
houses, and if we waited and trusted God to build
them, should we not trust too much?"</p>

<p>"But children are not houses," retorted Polly.</p>

<p>"Their bodies are&mdash;houses for the spirit that dwells
within, that indwelling spirit which you call depraved;
but it is the house, the organs of the brain through

<!-- page 75 -->

which this spirit must manifest, that are at fault.
They are not built right, are not rightly proportioned,
and the spirit <i>cannot</i>, instead of <i>will</i> not, act rightly
through them."</p>

<p>"But I do not see&mdash;I cannot understand what you
mean," said Polly, surprised beyond what she could
find words to express at Mrs. Hovey's reasoning.</p>

<p>"You are not expected to understand as well as
those who are mothers," remarked Mrs. Gray. Polly
blushed and was silent while Mrs. Hovey continued:</p>

<p>"If you attempt to raise a crop and the soil is poor
and thin, you must supply what is needed, or your crop
is a failure, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's queer, comparing human beings to crops
that grow out of the ground," interrupted Polly, unable
to keep quiet when ideas were being broached so
at variance with what she had been taught, or, rather,
what she had taken for granted; for she had not been
taught at all upon the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hovey turned her eyes full upon the spinster
as she replied: "The mother's body is the soil in
which they grow, and they feed upon her heart's blood,
and unless the mother has what she needs, the child is
not well made up."</p>

<p>Polly shrank back into herself again, while the old
lady sat for some minutes in thoughtful silence, and
with a look upon her face as if recalling painful memories.
At length she resumed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, how I did want good food that summer! but
we were poor and must save every cent to pay for a
home. Husband said if we did not get a start then,
we never should, so I went without tea, sugar, fruit&mdash;lived

<!-- page 76 -->

upon the plainest food, and had hardly a decent
dress. The dress I did not care so much for, but it did
seem to me that I should starve, and it ruined my child,
my only one. Better never have had a home," and
dropping her face in her hands, she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>When her emotion had subsided, Mrs. Gray said:</p>

<p>"Please explain more fully; there are some here
that you may benefit."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is why I came here to-day. It is only
that which makes life bearable&mdash;the hope that I may
sow seeds of thought which will bring a better harvest
in the future; so I will tell you all I felt&mdash;all that I
suffered, struggled, as well as I can.</p>

<p>"Week after week Henry would bring home the
pay for his work, count out what he thought we must
have to use, then hand me the balance to put away
toward paying for our land; and week after week I was
tempted to take some of it and buy that for which I so
longed; but I prayed to God to keep me in the right,
and trusted that all would be well, but I trusted in
vain; I was breaking Nature's laws, ignorantly it is
true, but there was no God who could set aside the effect.</p>

<p>"Because of that want which was not supplied&mdash;because
of the desire to take that money, which I resisted,
my boy is a drunkard and a thief&mdash;" and again
her grief burst forth.</p>

<p>"Oh, had I known, had I known," she murmured
between her sobs, "I would have taken what I needed&mdash;would
have given my child what he needed before
he was born, and trusted for a home. As it was, my
husband overworked and did without what he needed,

<!-- page 77 -->

and when sickness came he could not rally, and I, left
alone, struggled on for years to maintain myself and
child, only to find him in prison at last."</p>

<p>"These are strange ideas," said Miss Polly; "I don't
see what's to become of our religion and our souls if
such teachings are allowed."</p>

<p>"But if they are true, what then?" asked Mary
Drake.</p>

<p>"They are not true. Let God be true, though
every man a liar."</p>

<p>"And every woman, too, Polly?"</p>

<p>"And every woman, too, Mary Drake. It was woman
who sinned in the first place, and she ought to
bear her burden humbly."</p>

<p>"The burden of motherhood do you mean?" asked
another.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Bible says she is to bear children in sorrow."</p>

<p>"You do not seem to have obeyed that command,"
was the quick retort, and Polly indignantly left the
room.</p>

<p>"You are too bad, Jane," said Mrs. Gray, in a tone
that seemed hardly like a reproof.</p>

<p>"Let her keep still, then, about that of which she
knows nothing; the idea of her throwing the Bible at
us to prove that black is white! I think those who
profess to know the most about God and the Bible are
the ones who really know the least, Mrs. Gray."</p>

<p>"That is my opinion," "And mine," "And mine,"
responded several others.</p>

<p>"Poor creature, I dare say she was fed upon the
elements of election, depravity, and damnation from

<!-- page 78 -->

before her birth&mdash;I mean that such were the teachings
to which her mother listened, and in which she believed,"
said Mrs. Hovey.</p>

<p>"And if her mother had listened and had not believed,
but did not dare to say so, what then?" said
Susan Fosten.</p>

<p>"In that case, her child would have said for her
what she had not dared to say for herself, and Polly
Wheeler would have been an unbeliever, a questioner
of old creeds, instead of what she is now, one of the
most bigoted women in the country," was the reply.</p>

<p>"The seed, then, that is to be sown for future harvests,
Mrs. Hovey, must find lodgement in woman's
mind, if I understand you rightly," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that is why I call myself a seed-sower.
That is why, as I told you before, that I came here to-day"
she replied, looking around upon the ladies
present.</p>

<p>"And I, for one, thank you most heartily; and I
believe I echo the sentiments of all present," said Mrs.
Gray, turning toward the others for a response; and
they, without exception, bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Sowing seed&mdash;and what shall the harvest be?" said
the old lady, as if speaking to herself.</p>

<p>"The harvest of abolition thought is war," remarked
Semantha Guston.</p>

<p>"You mistake," was Mrs. Hovey's prompt reply;
"the war is the harvest of previously sown seed; the
harvest of freedom is yet to come. That harvest will
be seen when those who are now slaves shall rise to the
dignity of citizens&mdash;of educated men and women."</p>

<p>"You don't think the niggers will ever be citizens?"

<!-- page 79 -->

said Polly, who had so far gotten over her resentment
as to return to the room.</p>

<p>" 'No black, no white, no rich, no poor,' what is the
rest of that, Polly?" asked Mrs. Drake.</p>

<p>" 'No bond, no free, but all one in Christ Jesus,' "
responded Polly, glad to be appealed to in reference to
Bible texts.</p>

<p>"And that means that all are equal as to rights and
privileges, as I understand it."</p>

<p>"Yes, as Christians in the life to come."</p>

<p>"But why, Polly, cannot those who are to be equal
there, have the same rights here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's quite different; if they were all Christians
it might do."</p>

<p>"But some of them are Christians."</p>

<p>"Then they will be content with the place that God
has assigned them, till, in his own good time, he shall
say, 'Come up higher.' "</p>

<p>"You say they are all equal there?" continued Mrs.
Drake.</p>

<p>"In heaven, yes."</p>

<p>" 'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as
it is in heaven.' Why pray for a thing, Polly, and then
refuse to accept it as fast as it comes?"</p>

<p>"It hasn't come yet, and I don't want to live to see
the time when I shall be put on a level with a nigger,"
retorted Polly, indignantly.</p>

<p>"A free negro is equal with us before the law now;
he cannot vote, neither can we," said the one called
Jane.</p>

<p>Polly opened her mouth for some kind of a reply,
but the entrance of George Gray with a letter in his

<!-- page 80 -->

hand put a stop to further conversation. He was very
pale, and going directly to his mother handed her the
letter, saying: "Mrs. Johnson sent it; it is from
James."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray glanced at the contents, and then at the
group before her. They all saw that she was struggling
for self-control, and waited with bated breath.
"There has been a battle," she said, as soon as she
could speak, "several of our boys are prisoners, and
two have fallen."</p>

<p>"John!" exclaimed Mary Drake, starting to her
feet, and then reading in her friend's look the confirmation
of her fears, the fair young wife fell prostrate in
a dead faint.</p>

<p>While the others cared for her, Mrs. Gray arose and,
going to the far corner of the room, she threw her
arms around her son's betrothed, and they wept together.
When the first spasm of agony was over, Mrs.
Hovey went to Mrs. Gray, and taking her hands in her
own, said:</p>

<p>"Your first-born has died with honor, my only one
lives in dishonor. Our false system of society, the outgrowth
of superstition and ignorance, gives one a
grave, the other a prison; when will woman's day
come?"</p>

<p>"When such seed as you are sowing, my friend,
gives its full harvest, there will be no more children
born with the instinct to vice, no more prisons, no more
war, and&mdash;no, I will not say God, but woman speed the
day," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I wonder God don't strike her dead," muttered
Polly to herself.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p>"I think you had better leave lest you get killed
for being in bad company," said Letitia Barnes, who
was standing just back of Polly and overheard the remark.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Mrs. Gray, "this is no time for the
exhibition of resentment."</p>

<p>"Nor of religious prejudice," retorted Letitia, flashing
indignant eyes at Polly.</p>

<p>"I think submission to God's will would better become
us all," said meek little Mrs. Brown, wiping the
tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is not God's will, but our ignorance, that has
brought all this about, my sister. If I believed there
was a God who willed all this suffering, I should hate
him," said Mrs. Hovey.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, friends, we must bear it, no matter what
the cause," and Mrs. Gray turned and took up her
work. The others did the same, all but the poor bereaved
wife and her sister. They silently left for
their home, and before another day the dead babe and
its mother had gone to join the husband and father in
that home where it is hoped the sorrows of earth do
not enter.</p>

<br/>

<p> A few evenings after the above, as the Grays sat
around the almost untouched meal and talked sadly of
him who had fallen, Mrs. Gray turned to George and
said:</p>

<p>"If this cruel war continues, I may lose all my sons.
You will be old enough in less than a year to be
drafted, if you do not, as your brothers did, volunteer."</p>

<p>"I shall never volunteer, mother."</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>"But if you are drafted you will have to go."</p>

<p>"I will go to Canada first."</p>

<p>"What, what, my boy a coward!" exclaimed Mr.
Gray.</p>

<p>"No, father, I am not a coward, but I believe there
is some Quaker blood in me. I certainly do not believe
in fighting. I was not made to be shot at,
neither will I shoot at others&mdash;at those who have never
harmed me nor mine or, at least, would not have done
so had they been left free," he added, remembering
his brother's death.</p>

<p>"But they rebelled against our glorious flag,
George."</p>

<p>"A great deal of glory in a lie, I should think."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean that our flag is a flaunting lie so long as it
floats over a single slave, and it is no worse to make
slaves of individuals than it is of States."</p>

<p>"Slaves of States, George?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father, slaves of States."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that they have the right to
secede?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean."</p>

<p>"For the sake of holding slaves?"</p>

<p>"They would have had hard work to keep them,
even with an army all along their northern line."</p>

<p>"But our nation would have been dismembered,
George."</p>

<p>"And you would have had a son, and I a brother
that we have not now; a pretty high price to pay for
being able to say that we are a great nation, father."</p>

<p>Mr. Gray looked toward his wife in a sort of helpless

<!-- page 83 -->

way, as though he did not know how to reply to
his son's reasoning, and yet felt that he must; at
length he said:</p>

<p>"I never expected to hear a son of mine talk like
that; have you no love for your country?"</p>

<p>"The world is my country, father, and when men
cease to serve rulers, there will cease to be a demand,
even unto life itself, for service. If there is war,
those who make it will have to do the fighting."</p>

<p>"Well, well, you are talking pretty large for a boy
of your years, I think."</p>

<p>"I feel old enough, father, to have lived twice that
long; I think mother must have thought me several
years ahead before I was born."</p>

<p>"Wife, this is your work," said Gray, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, it commenced before he was born. I believe
he is right, that I did think him ahead."</p>

<p>"That old schoolmaster again!" and James Gray
looked thoroughly out of humor.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, and I can never be thankful enough
for what he did the books he gave mother to read, and
the explanations that helped her to understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"George, my son," said Mrs. Gray, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"No, let the boy talk. He thinks more of that
schoolmaster than he does of me, and I might as well
know it first as last."</p>

<p>"Father, father, you mistake; you are not to blame
because you did not have the education that Mr. Randal
had. I love you, and you know it, better than anyone
except my mother, but I should be a coward if I
feared to express my real sentiments," said George, so
earnestly that his father's brow began to clear.</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>He could but admire the manly bearing of his son,
and presently he said: "And so you will not fight,"
going back to where their difference first started.</p>

<p>"No, father, I will not fight. I can do more for
my country and the world at large by living for it,
than I can by dying for it."</p>

<p>"But what do you expect to do?"</p>

<p>"I shall first try and learn what needs to be done."</p>

<p>"Whew! how wise we are, or are going to be."</p>

<p>"There is certainly much to be learned, James, before
the world can be saved," said Mrs. Gray, "and
new methods must be adopted, for, so far, those which
have been tried have failed; and when one is desirous
of learning what those new methods are to be, he
should be allowed the privilege."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, wife&mdash;you generally are;
but what is it that George wants, or you want for him?
There is something back, I know."</p>

<p>"He wants better opportunities than he can have
here."</p>

<p>"And where is he going to get them?"</p>

<p>"I have been corresponding with Cousin Mary Raymond,
and she wants him to come there and study
with her children."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and while my other sons are fighting and dying
for their country, he must be made a gentleman."</p>

<p>"James, are they not my sons too?"</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to beat you two," he said, impatiently,
but his tone told that he felt more than he
was willing to show.</p>

<p>She made no reply, and he presently added: "Yes,
they are your sons, and you are in the right, but somehow

<!-- page 85 -->

I can't feel quite reconciled to your and George's
way of thinking."</p>

<p>"So much the more noble in you, then, to let reason
decide instead of feeling."</p>

<p>Whatever effect her words had he did not choose
to show, but presently he repeated, interrogatively:
"Wants him to come and study with her children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are abundantly able, so spare no pains
to secure the best teachers at home, and George, being
older than their son by two years, can help Richard in
the office a part of the time, and so can be of service to
them."</p>

<p>"Richard, who is he?"</p>

<p>"Cousin Mary's husband, Judge Raymond; I
thought you knew."</p>

<p>"And so I did, but I forgot. Well, well, I suppose
I shall have to let him go; he isn't much help to me,
nohow, still I hardly know how to spare him."</p>

<p>"Hire a good man, father, and charge his wages to
me."</p>

<p>"Charge his wages to you! what have you got to
pay with, boy?"</p>

<p>"How much land have you now?" was the response.</p>

<p>"How much land have I? You know as well as I
do, but what has that to do with the matter?"</p>

<p>"I supposed you meant to give me some of it some
time; you gave Julia eighty acres when she married;
I only meant that you could count the wages of a hired
man as so much of what might yet be mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very generous with what is not yours,
but I will do it; what of the money you will need to
go with, and to clothe you?"</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p>"You can count that in the same way, if you wish."</p>

<p>James Gray turned his back and laughed to himself,
and then, with a great show of generosity, he said:</p>

<p>"If you stayed here I suppose I should have to take
care of you, so if you pay the hired man&mdash;if I charge
his wages to you, I mean&mdash;perhaps I can afford to furnish
what you will need, if you are not too extravagant."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father, and I will try and make good
use of your kindness."</p>

<p>"The rascal," said Gray, after George went to his
room; "and so I may charge him with a hired man's
wages, ha, ha! that's rich, and I with one of the best
wheat farms in Kansas, and wheat selling at two dollars
a bushel! I guess I can afford to help him a little,
even if he doesn't choose to go my way."</p>

<p>"I knew you would do what was right, James."
said his wife, and then throwing herself into his arms
she sobbed: "Oh, James, it is so hard to feel that our
Edward will never come home anymore."</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE PSYCHOLOGIST.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is three years since Walter Raymond had
his laugh about the salmagundi mistake,
and Mabel has grown to be nearly as tall as
her mother. "You grow like a pigweed,"
said Walter, in one of his teasing moods.</p>

<p>"What is a pigweed, mother?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"Ask Walter," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Walter, what is a pigweed?"</p>

<p>"A weed that grows where pigs do, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You suppose," repeated his mother, in that quiet
way of hers which meant so much.</p>

<p>Walter colored. "John Williams talks about pigweed,
and he is from the country," he said.</p>

<p>"And what does he say about it?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said to Mabel; he said his sister grew
like one."</p>

<p>"And like a parrot you repeated it. I fear you will
get into trouble some day by repeating what you do
not understand."</p>

<p>"Why, mother, is there anything bad about a pigweed?"</p>

<p>"No, it is the habit of which I speak&mdash;the repeating
of phrases you hear without stopping to learn what
they mean; I wish you would not do so."</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>Walter looked sober for about half a minute, and
then exclaimed, "I must get my lessons, or Monsieur
Costin will make a pigweed of me," and away he went
in the direction of his room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond smiled. "The thoughtless boy," she
said. Just then the postman brought the mail, and
taking up a letter directed to herself, she glanced it
over, and then said to Mabel:</p>

<p>"Cousin Lucy Gray's youngest son, George, is coming
to stay with us for a while, daughter."</p>

<p>"Your Cousin Lucy? I did not know you had
such a cousin."</p>

<p>"No, I never saw her but once, and I have not told
you because I did not wish to divert your mind from
your studies by talking of people you might never
meet."</p>

<p>"Where does he live, mother?"</p>

<p>"In Kansas."</p>

<p>"In Kansas, that is a long way off. How old is he?
who will come with him?"</p>

<p>"He will come by himself, he is in his eighteenth
year."</p>

<p>"But why does he come here, so far from home,
mother?"</p>

<p>"The spirit moved me to write to his mother nearly
three years ago, and we have kept up the correspondence,
and now her son is coming here."</p>

<p>"The spirit moved thee? Thee is a Quaker now,
mamma," said Mabel, playfully.</p>

<p>"And the spirit moves me to say now that thee will
find a good helper in thy future work, in cousin Lucy's
boy, and&mdash;&mdash;" here Walter rushed in with:</p>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p>"Oh, mother, see there, read that, can't we go?"</p>

<p>"Who is we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all of us, mother."</p>

<p>"Give me time to see what it is, please?" and Mrs.
Raymond read aloud:</p>

<p>" 'A Wonderful Science. One Mind Controlling
Another. Professor Medwell at Music Hall, Tuesday
Evening, September 30th.' "</p>

<p>"That's to-morrow," interrupted Walter.</p>

<p>" 'Don't fail to come if you like to laugh. The
Professor is, without doubt, the best psychologist in
the world,' " continued Mrs. Raymond, finishing the
circular. "Where did you get this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I saw it thrown into the yard and ran down to see
what it was; can we go?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you at noon; go back to your lessons
now, and don't allow yourself to be interrupted again."</p>

<p>When his mother spoke in that tone Walter knew
there must be no trifling, so he went without a word.</p>

<p>"What is a psychologist, mother?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"The word comes from Psyche, the soul. What is
known of the subject is called psychology, and one who
demonstrates this power of soul, or will, of one over
another, is a psychologist. I think we will go, Mabel;
it will be a lesson for thee."</p>

<p>"The soul lives when the body is dead, does it not,
mother?"</p>

<p>"We are so taught, and we have good evidence that
it is true; but why does thee ask that, daughter?"</p>

<p>"I thought it might be the soul power of thine ancestors
that made thee act the Quaker sometimes,
mamma."</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>Mrs. Raymond looked thoughtful. "It may be,"
she said; "there are many things that we do not understand.
I only know that when I get particularly
interested in that which will help the people I feel
like a Quaker."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, mamma, that a knowledge of psychology
will be useful," said Mabel, with a far-away
look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, we will go and see this wonderful professor,
will see and hear what he does and says."</p>

<p>"Mother says we can go," said Mabel, the first time
Walter came into the room.</p>

<p>"Who, you and I?"</p>

<p>"Not alone, my boy; I shall go with you to see that
the professor gets no control over you."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I should like it; it would be such
fun."</p>

<p>"Mother would rather you would not, you are too
easily influenced by others now."</p>

<p>"But what difference would that make?"</p>

<p>"When you submit to be controlled by the will of
another it weakens your selfhood, and yours needs
strengthening instead."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, he can't make me play the fool; Harry
Green says it's all a cheat anyhow&mdash;that he arranges
with people beforehand what to do, and then divides
the money with them."</p>

<p>"I think Harry is mistaken; we will see to-night
and judge for ourselves."</p>

<p>"To-night&mdash;you mistake, mother, it is to-morrow
night," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Well, to-morrow night, then."</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>"I wish George Gray could be here in time to go
with us," continued Mabel.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will," and then, in answer to her husband's
look of inquiry, she added, "I received a letter
from Cousin Lucy to-day, and they have decided to
have him come. He is likely to be here at any time
now."</p>

<p>"What, who, what is it?" said Walter, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>When his mother had explained the matter to him
he sat silent for some minutes, and then said: "He
will be Meb's company, not mine."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that, my son?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I feel it, mother; he will be too
nice and wise for me. Meb is made up of better material
than I am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond saw, for the first time, that their talk
of hereditary conditions had made an impression on
Walter's mind, and that the idea that his sister was
naturally better than he was had taken possession of
him, and was having a discouraging effect. She arose,
and going to him, she put her arms around him, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way, Walter, you will break
mother's heart."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't. I'll be as good as I can," dashing
a rebellious tear aside; "but somehow, Meb always
does just the right thing, and I the wrong one; but,
never mind, we'll have a jolly time in witnessing the
Professor's wonderful powers, won't we, Meb? And if
that Kansas cousin comes in time it will be rich to see
him open his eyes, tra, la, la!" and away he went, chasing

<!-- page 92 -->

the cat out of the room, and pinching the dog's tail
as he passed him at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond was very thoughtful after he left.
His tone of sadness in speaking of the difference between
himself and sister made a deep impression
upon her, and she said to herself: "I will not reprove
him nor correct his mistakes after this in the presence
of others. His self-respect must be encouraged."</p>

<p>The Kansas cousin came in time, and at the hour
appointed he, with Mrs. Raymond, Walter, Mabel, and
their teacher, Monsieur Costin, went to see and hear
the Professor. Mr. Raymond had intended to be of
the party, but was detained by business.</p>

<p>They went early and took seats well up in front, for
Mrs. Raymond wanted the young folks to see and hear
all that was to be seen and heard. The Professor came
forward, talked awhile of the science he proposed to
illustrate, and then asked if there were persons present
who were willing to come to the platform and test
his power. After a little hesitation, and a casting of
eyes in all directions by the audience to see if anyone
would respond, a young man a little to the left of our
party arose, then another, and another farther back.</p>

<p>"Three, that is a good number to commence with;
there is luck in odd numbers," said the Professor.
"Come right forward, gentlemen; I began to think
none were going to offer, and in that case I should
have had to will them forward, as I once did; for
everybody was afraid, and it wouldn't do to make a failure,
you know. Take these seats, gentlemen, I will attend
to you in a moment." And thus he kept on
talking, not giving those in the audience a moment to

<!-- page 93 -->

centre their wills upon the subjects in opposition to
his.</p>

<p>In the meantime he took from his pocket three
highly polished steel buttons, and giving one to each,
he bade them keep their eyes fixed upon the same.
"Let your eyes close if they want to, but don't look
away," he said, and again he launched a volley of
small talk upon the audience. An auctioneer uses the
same policy in crying off his goods, and not one in five
would buy but for the magnetism, the psychological
power thus constantly thrown upon them.</p>

<p>Young Gray watched every movement with the
closest attention, while Walter seemed half fascinated.
He wanted to test the matter and thus prove that he
could not be subjected to the Professor's will; but
Mabel was simply seeing. Her time to analyze would
come afterward. Mrs. Raymond watched Walter
without seeming to do so, and presently she leaned
toward him and whispered:</p>

<p>"Be careful, my boy, or the Professor will have you
before you know it."</p>

<p>Walter laughed. "Why, mother, he is not trying
to control me," he said.</p>

<p>"He's trying all of us in a general way, and when he
sees one who is susceptible, he will fix his mind on that
one."</p>

<p>After talking to the audience, perhaps five minutes,
the Professor turned toward the young men, and laying
his hand upon the shoulder of the one nearest him,
he said: "How came you to put your coat on wrong
side out, Brown?"</p>

<p>The man looked at himself, then started up as if to

<!-- page 94 -->

leave. "No, I wouldn't go away; you can turn it in
a minute, no one will see you," was the next remark;
and as quickly as it could be done the coat was taken
off, turned, and put on again; then the man sat down
with a satisfied air, as if to say, "it's all right now."</p>

<p>"Smith, the people are expecting you to preach to
them," said the Professor to the next one in the row.</p>

<p>Smith sprang to his feet. "Sing 'Yankee Doodle,'
first," was the next order.</p>

<p>"Yankee Doodle went to town," rang out clear and
strong.</p>

<p>"That's not 'Old Hundred,' " said the Professor,
with a stamp of his foot; and then a line sung to that
famous tune followed.</p>

<p>"Now tell them about South America."</p>

<p>"South America, gentlemen and ladies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not right, you should address the ladies
first."</p>

<p>"South America, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take care there, that snake will bite you," was the
next diversion, as he thrust his cane toward the helpless
victim of his will; and the man shrank back, trembling
from head to foot.</p>

<p>"See, I have brought you your sister that you have
not seen for so long," and in an instant the cane was
clasped to the man's breast. "There, you can go behind
that curtain and have a good visit all by yourselves,"
was the next remark, and both cane and man disappeared.</p>

<p>He then went to the third one: "Jones, why did
you steal my purse?" The man looked up, the very
image of guilt.</p>

<!-- page 95 -->

<p>"I see," said the Professor, "it is the first time you
ever did such a thing; and as I don't want to ruin
you, if you will get down on your knees and promise
never to do so again, I will forgive you."</p>

<p>Jones (if that was his name) fell on his knees and
opened his mouth to speak, but before he could utter a
word, his tormentor shouted: "Look out, you careless
fellow, that gun is loaded!" and in an instant Jones
was on his feet again, and staring at a second cane
that had been provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Professor held it up: "It is the handsomest
horse I ever saw, and I will give him to you if you
will ride him," he said, extending that which he had
just before called a gun.</p>

<p>Jones took it, and throwing himself astride, went
prancing around the stage to the great amusement of
the audience.</p>

<p>Just here the Professor cast a furtive look at Walter.
His mother saw it, and saw also that Walter was
becoming excited, so she said to him:</p>

<p>"Mother is feeling badly, Walter, can I hold your
hand?" at the same time taking one of Mabel's in her
other hand.</p>

<p>The professor now threw the influence off the three
young men and they returned to their seats all right,
except the one who had turned his coat, and had
forgotten to turn it back. Indeed, he did not notice
that it had been turned till the young lady he was sitting
beside pointed it out to him.</p>

<p>Stepping to the front of the platform, Professor
Medwell made a few remarks about what had been
done, and then said:</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>"I never saw those young men till I came into this
hall, but all of you cannot know that, and some are
unkind enough to say of such manifestations of the
power of psychology, that it is all a trick, or a pre-arranged
plan between the subjects and the operator.
I will now bring subjects from the audience by the
power of my will," and glancing first at Harry Green,
and then at Walter, he commenced stepping slowly
backward.</p>

<p>Presently Harry Green arose and went toward the
platform like one walking in sleep, but Mrs. Raymond,
noting the glance fixed upon Walter, diverted his attention
for a moment, and then did what she could to
impart her own calm, firm feeling to her son; still he
felt the professor's will upon him and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I want to go."</p>

<p>"I had rather you would not, dear; I am feeling
badly, and I could not bear to see you up there acting
so foolishly."</p>

<p>"But he can't make me do as they did," and he nearly
pulled his hand from his mother's grasp.</p>

<p>She turned and whispered to his teacher, Monsieur
Costin, and that gentleman arose and said: "Professor
Medwell, you will please cease trying to psychologize
any of this party; the lady is nearly sick now."
And so she was with her struggle to hold Walter, who,
when he heard this, thought the professor was trying
to control his mother; this made him angry, and
broke the influence.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, if it is not agreeable to his
friends, but the young gentleman is a fine subject," replied
the professor, bowing.</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<p>"He means Cousin George," thought Walter, never
once thinking that his own intense desire to go up
there and defy the professor's will was the direct effect
of that will upon him, the method that gentleman was
taking to get him upon the platform; and that once
there, he would have done whatever he was told to do,
just as the others had.</p>

<p>Harry Green, in the meantime, was the perfect image
of submission, his every muscle seeming to ask:
"What wilt thou have me to do?"</p>

<p>"Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will show you what
there is in spiritualism," was the professor's next remark.
"You know they claim to see their spirit
friends, and I will make this young gentleman see
anyone I choose, living or dead." Then stepping up to
Harry, he placed his fingers upon the boy's eyes, saying:
"I am going to make you clairvoyant, so that you
can see spirits." He then stepped back and made a
few downward passes very near the face, and asked:
"Who would you like to see?"</p>

<p>Harry hesitated as if trying to decide.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, there comes your mother, speak
to her."</p>

<p>"Did the professor make you come too?" asked
Harry, as if very much surprised.</p>

<p>He then held up his pocket-handkerchief and said:
"Do you see this beautiful spirit?"</p>

<p>Harry's face wore an ecstatic expression, and when
the professor added: "She says she is your guardian
angel, and that you may come and kiss her," he touched
his lips to the handkerchief with as much reverence as
if a Catholic in the presence of his patron saint.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p>"And now your father and mother have both come;
poor orphan, they have not forgotten you; they are
always with you." Here Harry reached out his arms as
if embracing first one, and then the other.</p>

<p>"What do they say?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"That I must be good and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall be with them by and by, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured, and reeled as if about to fall.
The professor caught him, threw off the influence, and
the boy was all right, but very much surprised to find
himself upon the platform, and the way he returned to
his seat was quite in contrast with his slow movement
in going up.</p>

<p>"Will someone please inform me if this young
man's parents are living?" was next asked.</p>

<p>"His mother is," said a voice from the audience.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she will not be displeased with the experiment
I have made with her son, but he is a very
fine subject, and if I can have further opportunity to
test him, I can show up every phase of spiritualism
through him; but he can bear no more now," he
said glancing over the audience with a look of triumph.</p>

<p>Just here a tall, middle-aged man arose, and said he
would like to ask a question or two.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," was the bland response.</p>

<p>Turning toward the audience, the stranger said slowly:
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very interesting
science, and the better we understand it, the greater
the good we may receive from it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," repeated the professor.</p>

<p>"The better we can avoid the evils that sometimes

<!-- page 99 -->

result from the partial application of a really good
thing," continued the stranger, not heeding the interruption;
then turning to the professor, he asked:</p>

<p>"Sir, can you make your subjects see that which
does not exist?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; did you not see for yourself
that there was no woman, serpent, horse, or spirit
here?"</p>

<p>"That there was nothing of what you mention except
spirit I admit, but as spirits are not visible under ordinary
circumstances, neither you nor I can say that
there was no spirit there; but that is not the question.
Serpents, horses, men, and women exist, for we have
all seen them, know how they look; can you make
your subjects see that which has no existence anywhere?"</p>

<p>The audience began to be interested, and the professor
looked confused. The stranger waited a moment,
and receiving no reply, continued:</p>

<p>"If I understand this matter rightly, you will your
subjects to see that of which you form a picture in your
own mind; can you form an image of that which does
not exist, I mean so far as the different parts are concerned?
I know that we can take parts of that which
does exist, but do not belong together, and make a new
mental image, as, for instance, a horse with a man's
head; but could you do this if neither horse nor man
existed?"</p>

<p>The professor hesitated, but "Question," "Question,"
came from all parts of the house, and he was
forced to say that he could not.</p>

<p>The gentleman waited till all was quiet: "Can anyone,

<!-- page 100 -->

anywhere, under any circumstances, see that
which does not exist somewhere and in some shape?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"In all ages of the world men and women have
claimed to see the spirits of the so-called dead, consequently
they must exist, and they must have been
seen to give the first idea of their existence; so it
seems to me, sir, that your statement of spiritualism
being simply the result of psychological impressions
made upon the mind is not susceptible of proof."</p>

<p>"Are you a spiritualist, sir?"</p>

<p>"What my belief is, Professor Medwell, has nothing
to do with the question, but I do not hesitate to
say that the testimony as to the reality of modern
manifestations, equals, if it does not exceed, the testimony
as to what is related in the Bible."</p>

<p>"Oh, an infidel."</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled. "I am aware," he said,
"that the public mind has been so psychologized by
priestly teachings, that people shrink when you call a
man an infidel, nearly as much as your subject did when
you told him your cane was a snake; but, calling the
cane a snake did not make it so, and I am not troubled
in the least by the appellation; neither will I trouble
you with any more questions. This audience is composed
of intelligent men and women who are capable
of judging for themselves." And he took his seat with
the air of one who feels that he has the best of the
argument.</p>

<p>"Well, cousin, what do you think of psychology?"
asked Mrs. Raymond, when on the way home.</p>

<p>"There is more think in it than I can get together

<!-- page 101 -->

in one evening, Mrs. Raymond, but when that young
man shrank from the cane believing it to be a snake, I
could not help thinking how some of our Kansas
preachers make people tremble by talking to them of
hell."</p>

<p>"So you believe their hell has no more existence
than had the professor's snake?" remarked Monsieur
Costin.</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that all the danger lies in the idea, in
both cases."</p>

<p>"And I think he was real mean, trying to control
mother," said Walter. "I would have shown him that
he could not handle me, could I have had the chance."</p>

<p>"He had as good a right to try to control me without
my consent as he had Harry Green or anyone else,
but I think you mistake his intentions."</p>

<p>"What was it that made you sick, then?"</p>

<p>"My effort to keep him from controlling you."</p>

<p>"Me, mother! he did not try to control me. I
think he knew better."</p>

<p>"Why were you so anxious to go up there, then?"
asked his teacher.</p>

<p>"To show him he could not control me, of course."</p>

<p>"Where did that feeling come from? you are not in
the habit of being so defiant."</p>

<p>"Where, now&mdash;you don't think he made me feel
that way on purpose to get me up there?" said Walter,
beginning to understand.</p>

<p>"That is just what he was doing, and but for your
mother he would have succeeded, and once there he
would have willed that defiance all away, and you could
not have helped doing as he said."</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>Walter drew a long breath, and Mabel remarked:
"I think we have both learned lessons."</p>

<p>Monsieur Costin looked at Mabel in silence, and
George Gray thought her a remarkably intelligent
girl.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">MONSIEUR COSTIN'S STORY.</p>

</div>

<p>GEORGE GRAY remained with the Raymonds
something over two years, when
circumstances occurred which made it
necessary for him to return to his Kansas
home. He had made good progress
in his studies, and the judge liked his quiet, helpful
ways in the office. "You would make a good lawyer,
Gray," he said, "and I hope you will yet adopt the
profession."</p>

<p>"I cannot decide as yet what I shall do; I must
first learn more of what can be done to better the conditions
of the people," replied George, launching off
into what the judge laughingly called the cranky notions
of the trinity, referring to his wife and daughter
in the connection.</p>

<p>Monsieur Costin, or M. Costin, as they called him,
thus abridging the prefix, was present, and knew something
of what those notions were, so when Mrs. Raymond
said: "Our cranky notions will be considered
the best of sense when rightly understood, and thee
will be the first to say so," he remarked:</p>

<p>"You will find the church your most formidable opponent,
Mrs. Raymond."</p>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>M. Costin had been the children's teacher about six
months when George came, was well recommended,
and had proved to be just what was wanted, so was
treated as one of the family.</p>

<p>"Who ever knew a French infidel to see anything
good in the Church?" said Mr. Raymond, in response
to the above.</p>

<p>M. Costin smiled: "Perhaps I understand what I
am talking of better than you think, sir. I never saw
France till I was nearly twenty-one years old, and
then I stayed there less than a year."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I supposed you to be a born Frenchman."</p>

<p>"My father was French, sir, but my mother was
English, so I was born only a half Frenchman, and in
this country."</p>

<p>"You would make a good detective," said the
judge.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Because of your secretiveness. You have been in
my family nearly three years, and from no word of
yours have I gathered the least intimation that you
were not born and brought up in France."</p>

<p>M. Costin looked around upon the group, upon the
faces of which curiosity and surprise were plainly written.
"I think I may trust you all," he said, "to say
nothing of what I am about to relate, but I was educated
for the priesthood, and actually took orders."</p>

<p>"You a priest!" exclaimed Walter.</p>

<p>"That is where you got your education?" said the
judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was a priest, and that is how I got my education.
My father belonged to a French family of

<!-- page 105 -->

some note. The spirit of adventure brought him to
this country, and he fell in love with and married an
English girl by the name of Helen Brightly, who had
come here with a cousin's family who were Catholics.</p>

<p>"A young priest by the name of Bremen often
visited them and tried to induce my mother to join
their Church, but this she would not do. When my
father began to visit her this priest warned her against
trusting a French infidel, told her he would deceive
her, but all to no purpose. A few months after his
marriage, father went to France on business, the result
of which was to decide whether he would make
America his home, or return permanently to his native
country.</p>

<p>"My mother failed to receive his letters, and after a
time this priest came to her with a letter he had received
from France, in answer to one of inquiry he had
sent, so he said. This letter stated that my father
was married before he came to America, and of course
she thought she had been deceived, as the priest had
warned her she would be. In the meantime father
received a letter stating that mother had died at my
birth, and I had lived but a few days, so he never returned.</p>

<p>"This Father Bremen, as he was called, professed
great sympathy for my mother in her trouble, but said
nothing further about her joining the Church; but he
managed to steal me, together with my mother's marriage
certificate and a locket containing my father's
likeness, thus leaving her utterly desolate."</p>

<p>Here M. Costin paused as if to regain his self-control,
that the recital had disturbed, while his listeners

<!-- page 106 -->

expressed their sympathy by looks more than words.
Mabel was the first to speak:</p>

<p>"Why did the priest do that?" she asked, always
looking for the reason of things.</p>

<p>"To obtain my father's wealth for the Church. My
father was an infidel, please remember, and it is a part
of a Christian's creed that infidels have no rights they
are bound to respect. The story that my father was
previously married was a lie. They knew that my
mother was his legal wife, and if he should marry
again, believing mother dead, the children of such
marriage could not inherit the property, and when
father died it would be mine."</p>

<p>"But you are not the Church," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"No, but, as I have told you, I was educated for the
priesthood and had taken orders, consequently it would
have all gone to the Church, had I remained true to my
vows."</p>

<p>"An ex-Catholic priest my teacher!" said Mabel,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"How did you find out who you were?" asked
Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, please tell us," added the others.</p>

<p>M. Costin looked at Mabel and laughed. "I think,"
he said, "I shall have to make use of the same application
of psychological law that you do in accounting for
your mother's Quaker talk&mdash;the soul-power of my ancestors."</p>

<p>Mabel blushed and looked at her mother. "Yes,
dear, I told him," she said, "I thought the application
a good one."</p>

<p>M. Costin continued: "I think I inherited my

<!-- page 107 -->

father's dislike to the Church, and though treated with
kindness and taught their doctrines, I always had a
deep-down feeling that something was wrong; and if it
is a fact that our ancestors can influence us, they must
have kept the feeling alive, for there was that in me
that could not be psychologized. True, I was educated
for the Church, but I submitted to all that was required
like one in a dream. The awakening came at length.</p>

<p>"I entered the ministry very young, not quite
twenty years of age, but I now believe they sensed
that I was liable to rebel, and so hastened matters as
to make me fast beyond escape, as they supposed.
Not long after this, word came to Father Bremen that
my father was dead, and I was then informed that I
was heir to his estate; that father had tried to deceive
my mother, but they, the Church agents, had seen to
it that the marriage was legal, and such other lies as
they believed would make me very grateful.</p>

<p>"When asked why I had not been told this before,
Father Bremen said, with tears in his eyes: 'When I
took you from your dead mother's breast, Paul, my
heart so went out to you that I wanted you for my
own, wanted your love; so I simply told you that you
were an orphan, but now it is different. Your father is
dead, and the property is legally yours, and though it
is painful to tell you of them, you must know the
facts."</p>

<p>"The old hypocrite!" exclaimed Walter.</p>

<p>"Poor man, how bad he was," said Mabel.</p>

<p>M. Costin did not notice the interruption, but continued:</p>

<p>"I told him that I did not care to go to France, that

<!-- page 108 -->

I wanted nothing from the man who had so wronged
my mother.</p>

<p>" 'Your feeling is perfectly natural,' he said, 'and I
do not blame you in the least; but think of the good
that can be done with the property, and of your duty
to the Church and to the world at large. Have you
the right to refuse? I will go with you, and we ought
to start soon; I have your father's likeness, and all
the papers needed,' he said, taking from his pocket a
small case.</p>

<p>"We had walked out toward the forest and were
sitting under a tree not ten rods from its border. We
had chosen the place because the broad-spreading
limbs and heavy foliage made so good a shade. Before
taking the case from his pocket Father Bremen
had looked in every direction but up. As he was
about to open it, an Indian woman sprang from the
tree, snatched it from his hand, and was half-way to
the forest before we recovered sufficiently from our
astonishment to follow her. We then started upon a
run, but had gone but a few steps when she was out of
sight.</p>

<p>" 'It is of no use,' he said, panting for breath, 'we
cannot catch her. She seems to have a passion for
stealing lockets, but she always brings them back.
But who would have thought she was in that tree; she
has not been seen about here for several months.'</p>

<p>" 'Who is she?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'They call her wild Nell, a half-crazy half-breed
who seems harmless, but I begin to think she ought to
be shut up; there's no knowing what she might do.'</p>

<p>"Somehow I could not be sorry for what had happened,

<!-- page 109 -->

and all the evening the words, 'has a passion
for stealing lockets,' seemed to haunt me. Could it be
possible that she was searching for the likeness of
someone in whom she was interested, and that she restored
them because she had not yet found what she
sought. My sleep that night was filled with visions of
wild Nell. I would see her in one scene and then in
another, but somehow she always lost her Indian look,
and became a well-dressed lady in the end.</p>

<p>"The next day Father Bremen came to me and
said there had been an exact copy made of both likeness
and papers, and if Nell did not return the
original within ten days, we could take the copies with
us to France. The words sent a chill all through me,
and I resolved then and there that I would not go,
that I would run away first; but I was well aware that
I must not let this feeling be seen, so I said: 'Why
wait that long, will not a week be enough?'</p>

<p>"There was one sister in this convent who was reputed
to be possessed of remarkable gifts; Sister
Myra, they called her; they said she could even read
people's thoughts. In my then state of mind I was a
little afraid of her&mdash;not that I believed in all the powers
attributed to her, but I had just as soon keep away
from her as not, and a little more so. Judge, then, of
my feelings when I found that she was watching me.</p>

<p>"About three days after the episode of the stolen
locket, she came to me, as I was walking in the garden,
and said: 'Do not be afraid of me, I know how you
feel, and I do not want to stay here any more than you
do. I know your history. They have lied to you.
Your mother is living, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>" 'Where is she?' I almost whispered, so surprised
that I could hardly speak above my breath. She
looked at me a moment, and then stooping as if to examine
a flower, said: 'Wild Nell is no more an
Indian than I am; she is disguised&mdash;be careful, Father
Bremen is coming.' She turned and walked toward
him, signing me to follow. They talked of various
matters, I forcing myself to join in the conversation.
Presently she stepped a little in front of me, and pointing
to someone in the distance, asked, 'Who is that,
Father Bremen?' at the same time dropping her other
hand behind her, in which I saw a note which I knew
by her manner she wished me to take.</p>

<p>"She held the priest's attention till I had transferred
the note to my pocket, and then asked him
about something that took them to another part of the
grounds. I hastened to my room and read: 'Tell the
young chief to come to the forest beyond the tree.
We shall be waiting. <span class="smcap">Nell</span>.'</p>

<p>"To paint my feelings when I read this is more
than I can do. The opportunity to reach the place
designated soon came, and I found not only Nell, but
an aged Indian, and three fleet horses. They each
mounted one, and pointing to the third, said: 'Come
with us if you wish to find your friends.' I did
not hesitate a moment, but took the horse assigned me.
We followed a winding path with which they seemed
perfectly familiar, and after about five hours' ride we
came to a cabin deep in the forest, at which we
stopped.</p>

<p>"Nell took a seat upon a pile of skins, dropped her
face upon her hands, and remained perfectly quiet,

<!-- page 111 -->

except an occasional sob, while the old Indian commenced
preparing something to eat. I could only
watch and wait. Presently Nell arose and went into
an inner room, and the old Indian said: 'The young
chief must eat, and then he shall know all.' I felt
very little like taking food, but I tried to obey; I noticed,
however, that the old man spoke good English.
When I had eaten what I could I turned to him with
a look of inquiry, and he rapped upon the wall.</p>

<p>"Nell came in answer to his call, but what a transformation!
She was neatly dressed in good English
style, the dark skin had disappeared, and I could
hardly believe her the same person with wild Nell.
'My son, my long-lost son!' she exclaimed, extending
her arms, and I knew I had found my mother."</p>

<p>"I think she found you," said Mabel, innocently.</p>

<p>The remark was timely, notwithstanding, for it
helped to break an intensity of feeling that was becoming
oppressive.</p>

<p>"When the first transports had subsided, I turned
to see if the old man was still an Indian, but he had
disappeared," continued M. Costin. "Presently he
too came from the inner room, dressed in a suit of steel
gray of fine texture, but a little out of date as to fashion.
The paint had disappeared from his face also,
and my mother said: 'My father, my son.'</p>

<p>"Wonder on wonder; I, who had believed myself
alone in the world, had found not only a mother, but a
grandfather. As I looked at the two I said, 'Father
Bremen would not know you, should he meet you
now.'</p>

<p>" 'I am not so certain of that,' said grandfather,

<!-- page 112 -->

'those priests are very cunning; they always pretend
ignorance when it suits them, but with your disappearance,
the unreturned locket, etc., they will draw
their own conclusions, and it will be well to keep out
of their reach. As soon as Myra can reach us we will
leave this part of the country.'</p>

<p>" 'Who is Myra?' I asked, for I began to think she
too might be a relative.</p>

<p>" 'She is my cousin,' said my mother, 'the daughter
of my mother's sister. My mother was Scotch, and
aunt married a Scotchman, thus making Myra pure
blood while I am but half Scotch; and the Scotch
people are famed for second sight and other peculiarities
that the Yankee spiritualists call mediumship.'</p>

<p>" 'How long has she been a Catholic?'</p>

<p>" 'She is not a Catholic, but about two years ago she
kept having visions of a stolen child and of this particular
place&mdash;this convent school. She lived only a
few miles away, or, rather, was staying there for a few
months, and had visited the school in company with
others. These visions made such an impression upon
her, that she finally began to think they had something
to do with the child that had been stolen from
me, and wrote me her impressions.</p>

<p>"I had gone back to England and was living there
with my parents. We received Myra's letter only a
week before mother's death, but we communicated the
contents to her, and she said "Go to America by all
means; I believe, Helen, you will yet find your boy."
So a few days after her funeral we started, father and
I. In the meantime Myra had made friends at the
convent, professed to be much pleased with all she saw,

<!-- page 113 -->

and proposed a course of study so as to become better
acquainted, and perhaps she would join them.</p>

<p>" 'Her peculiar gifts have served her a good turn,
and she has been counted as one of them for the last
six months. She has so won upon their confidence
that she has learned many things that others could not
have done, and one was that the heads of the institution
had likenesses, marriage certificates, etc., by the
means of which they could establish the parentage of
the most of those children who were supposed to be
orphans.'</p>

<p>" 'And that was what set you to stealing likenesses?'
I said.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, and when I got the right one I lost no time
in communicating the fact to Myra, and now that our
object is accomplished she will leave them as soon as
she can get away. They have much faith in her gifts,
as they call them; they will go to her to learn what
has become of you. She will put them on the wrong
track, and then escape here. Father will resume his
disguise, go back to the edge of the forest, and wait
for her, but you will remain with me.'</p>

<p>"I sat for some time thinking of all this, and then I
asked: 'Are you sure there can be no mistake, that I
am really your child?'</p>

<p>"I am sure," she said, 'you are the living image of
your father. Had I seen you fairly in the face before
I got the locket, I should have known that you were
his child. I only had a partial view the day I was in
the tree.' How strange it all seemed, and yet it was
true. In two days Myra was with us, and then I was
ready to go to France."</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>"And you went," said Mrs. Raymond, unable longer
to keep silence.</p>

<p>"We all went, but I want to say, right here, that
Myra had so identified herself with that school, or
with its teachers, that even I supposed she was a sister
in full fellowship. I was only a visitor; I found
her wearing a sister's dress, and I was not told the
difference."</p>

<p>"I did not suppose they ever put on the dress till
fully initiated," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"They do not, usually. Indeed, it is against the
rules, but she asked to wear it for a while to see how
it would seem, and in order to secure her they complied.
It was her peculiar gifts that they wanted the
use of. She would have been canonized as a saint."</p>

<p>"But did you get the property?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Do you think it would have been right to take it
from my father's other son?" asked M. Costin.</p>

<p>"Did he have another son?"</p>

<p>"Yes; supposing my mother dead, he had married
again, and that boy had grown up supposing the property
would be his. He is my father's son, and his
mother is a worthy woman; why should I spoil their
lives? Mother feels as I do about it."</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"She is with grandfather," but he did not say where,
"and will remain with him while he lives. We went
to France under an assumed name, and revealed ourselves
to no one but my father's wife. When the son
comes of age he will divide with me, turning my share
into money; in the meantime I receive annually one-half
the rents, which I safely invest."</p>

<!-- page 115 -->

<p>"So Costin is not your true name," persisted the irrepressible
Walter.</p>

<p>"I did not say that it was not, Master Raymond."
Walter felt a reproof in the tone and was silent, while
M. Costin continued:</p>

<p>"I had two reasons for using another name while in
France. I did not wish to annoy my father's wife and
son, and when she found how father had been deceived,
mother felt as I did; besides, I did not care to
set the priests upon my track. I know too much of
their doings to suit them, and I might be put out of
the way."</p>

<p>"The Catholic Church is very corrupt," remarked
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"The Catholic Church loves power, my dear madam,
and so does the Protestant. They both, as do all religions
founded upon the idea of a personal God, with
a priesthood to expound his will, stand directly across
the path of human progress."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe in God?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"Not in a God who needs temples, churches, or
priests. The Infinite life-spirit gives no worded commands
to be executed by one class of people over another.
The priest is a fraud upon the race, and must
be set aside."</p>

<p>"And you have to watch to keep the priest from
setting you aside. Such talk sounds very much like
the advice of the mouse to bell the cat," said the
judge.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir," replied Costin, "there is where
the trouble lies. We have tried to bell the cat, but
have not once thought of killing it."</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p>"It would take a heap of mice to kill a cat."</p>

<p>"Do mice come in heaps, Walter?"</p>

<p>"Well, a drove, then."</p>

<p>"Are you serious, sir, in your idea of killing the
cat, or, dropping the figure, of abolishing the priesthood?"
asked George Gray.</p>

<p>"Entirely so, young man. Bring mice enough to
the charge, and the cat can be killed. Make the people
sufficiently intelligent, and the priesthood will disappear."</p>

<p>"You say you do not believe in a personal God;
will you please give us your idea of God?"</p>

<p>"Why try to form an idea of that which is unthinkable,
Mr. Gray? Can God be defined? That
which has no definition is not&mdash;cannot be a thinkable
quantity; and that which can be defined is less than
the definer, so cannot be God. I can only say that to me
the life essence of all things is as measureless as space,
as formless as an axiom in mathematics, and as bodyless
as are the laws which govern chemical combination.
Temples and priests represent only the ideas of
mental babyhood. They are the offspring of conceptions
as baseless as that canes are snakes to fear, or
horses to ride, and none know this better than the
priests themselves."</p>

<p>"I see," replied George, "that the lessons of the
psychologist have a wide application. What I saw the
first night I came to this city will not soon be forgotten,
and I am glad to have heard your story, Monsieur
Costin. I have learned much since I left home; but
it seems to me that my first and my last lessons are
the most valuable."</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>"We are all sorry that it is to be the last," said
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Not more so than I am; but M. Costin says that
the Church is the greatest obstacle in the way of our
work. I would like to ask if the Church would not be
comparatively powerless were it not sustained by the
government?"</p>

<p>"This is supposed to be a secular government, Mr.
Gray, one in which the Church plays no part, or, at
least, but a subservient one."</p>

<p>"But is the supposition true?"</p>

<p>"About as true as that the cane was a horse. The
Church not only does not play a subservient part, but
whenever the chaplain, in Congress or elsewhere, is
called upon to invoke the divine blessing, the Church,
through her representatives, is really exalted above the
government."</p>

<p>"I do not see it so, sir; it is only an acknowledgment
that God is above all governments."</p>

<p>"Then his agents, or representatives, must be. We
can take no other position and be consistent. Besides,
it is the Christian's God, a personal being, that is recognized.
If we recognize the Christian Fatherhood,
we must also recognize the Sonship; and the claim is
that Jesus is to be ruler among nations&mdash;not church
and state, but church over state."</p>

<p>"I had never thought of it in that light," said the
judge.</p>

<p>"Then think of it now and ask yourself, if accepting
as our rightful ruler an invisible potentate with visible
representatives is likely to conduce to human freedom."</p>

<!-- page 118 -->

<p>"There is another point, M. Costin," said George;
"a masculine ruler with masculine representatives,
will not be very likely to aid woman in securing the
best conditions for motherhood."</p>

<p>"That point is well put, Mr. Gray; and I think
Mrs. Raymond and Miss Mabel will find food for reflection
there."</p>

<p>"A Christian government," said Mrs. Raymond,
musingly.</p>

<p>"Will never give woman the right to herself," responded
M. Costin.</p>

<p>"Then woman must take that right, for without it
she can never do her best work," said Mrs. Raymond,
in the same emphatic tone.</p>

<p>"Which she can never do till the power of the priesthood
is broken, thus proving my position correct; to wit,
that the Church is the greatest obstacle in the way."</p>

<p>"Well, I think thee is about right, friend Costin,
and the Friends&mdash;Quakers thee calls them&mdash;commenced
the work in the days of George Fox; and dost thou
not think his descendants should continue it?"</p>

<p>Monsieur laughed, and Walter, as if tired of listening
to such serious talk, said: "Well, George, I suppose
you leave us to-morrow, so good-night, with the hope
that</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'We'll all meet together in the morning.' "</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Then, as he disappeared up-stairs, they heard him
singing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Breathes there a man with soul so dead<br/>

Who never to himself hath said,<br/>

I'll rap that fellow on the head<br/>

Unless he lets my girl alone."</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 119 -->

<p>"Nothing serious about him," said his father.</p>

<p>"An encouraging sign," said Costin. The others
looked up in surprise, and he continued: "In the disposition
to caricature things looked upon as sacred, lies
the germ of that which will destroy all gods, Jehovah
not excepted; then, where will your priesthood be?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THAT CRANK&mdash;DEBT SLAVERY, ETC.</p>

</div>

<p>GEORGE GRAY knew that his father was
not well enough to work, but supposed
him well enough to ride, and expected to
meet him, or his brother John, at the station
five miles from his home; but instead
a stranger stepped up and called him by name.</p>

<p>"You are your father's image, young man," he said,
"so I know you are the one I want. I was coming up
with a load of corn, so I told your folks I could just as
well take you and your traps back as not; my name is
Steadman, at your service."</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, Mr. Steadman; how are
the folks?"</p>

<p>"Your mother is well, I believe, but your father's
down with a lame back, and John's foot, where he was
shot, is so sore he can't step on it, and the work is hurrying
'm so they didn't know how to spare the team or
either of the men, so I told 'm I guessed I could fetch
you without breaking, if you was a city chap."</p>

<p>George laughed at this. "Thank you, Mr. Steadman,"
he said, "I am glad to hear that mother is
well."</p>

<p>"Yes, the old lady is well, but working herself almost
to death; I think the old man has played the

<!-- page 121 -->

fool running into debt for more land, and nearly killing
himself and all the rest trying to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Buying more land! What does he want of more
than he has?"</p>

<p>"That is what your mother was saying only yesterday,
and she said, 'I haven't told George because I
thought it would worry him, but it's the foolishest
thing father ever did, buying land because two bushels
of wheat'll pay for an acre; but these are only war
prices, things can't stay this way,' and she's right."</p>

<p>"Two bushels pay for an acre, at what price?"</p>

<p>"Two dollars and a half, but I'm thinking it'll cost
him five bushels before he is through; wheat has begun
to fall now, and it's sure not to stop till it gets
down to a dollar, if not less."</p>

<p>"I did not suppose wheat had been that high&mdash;what
is it bringing now?"</p>

<p>"Two dollars; he bought out Henry Ozmun, pays
five dollars an acre and ten per cent. interest; three
hundred and twenty acres, sixteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Where has Mr. Ozmun gone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's gone further West, he and his boys. They
have bought up a lot of soldiers' claims, leaving your
father to pay for them, that is, the boys have agreed
to take the first payments on the place&mdash;three claims I
think it is the Ozmuns have got&mdash;and then he and the
boys will pre-empt government land, so you see they'll
be extensive landholders. The first payment, two
hundred dollars, helped them to go, and as soon as
the claims are paid for, they will use the rest that
comes from the old place to fix up with."</p>

<p>"You say, Mr. Steadman, father pays ten per cent.

<!-- page 122 -->

interest; so if the soldiers receive the same on their
claims, that will leave eighty dollars a year interest
money for the Ozmuns to fix up with, as you say?"
said George.</p>

<p>"True, I didn't think of that, but the Ozmuns have
made a good move; they'll get along all right, but it's
a seven years' pull on your folks, two hundred a year,
with interest on the balance."</p>

<p>"I can't see what father wants of more land," said
George, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That's just what I say. True, it took only eighty
bushels of wheat last year to raise the money, but with
the fall in the price and the interest added, it will take
more than twice that this year; the interest on fourteen
hundred dollars is one hundred and forty dollars,
it'll take seventy bushels to pay that."</p>

<p>George remembered the talk, five years before, of
high prices and low prices, but he said nothing, and
Steadman continued:</p>

<p>"I think it's the fall in the price that worried the
old gentleman, and he tried to work enough harder to
make it up, but he's flat on his back now, and I'm
thinking he'll stay there for a while."</p>

<p>"Does John's foot trouble him all the while?"
asked George, thinking to change the subject.</p>

<p>"No, only by spells, but he'll never be able to do
hard work any more; but his girl won't consent to give
him up, so they are going to be married, and that's
why I think the old man wanted more land. If he
can fix it so someone else must support John and the
children, if there should be any, then they will be all
right."</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Someone else support them!" repeated George, in
a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, they say I'm cranky, but's all the same to
me. No one has any real right to more land than they
can take care of. Nature furnishes land for us all, and
those who have more than their share rob the others;
while those who live by rents from land that others till
are simply supported by those others."</p>

<p>"With so many men wanting work, a man can take
care of a great deal of land, Mr. Steadman; all that he
needs to do is to be able to oversee things."</p>

<p>"Did you ever stop to think why so many need
work, young man?"</p>

<p>George was silent for some moments. "I don't believe
I ever did, Mr. Steadman," he said, at length.</p>

<p>"Is it not because someone else has their land? If
one man holds thousands of acres somebody must go
without; that stands to reason, don't it?"</p>

<p>"I have not thought upon the matter, sir, so am not
prepared to give an answer."</p>

<p>"Well, think, then. They say you are quite a philosopher,
so I'll risk the conclusion; but you must be
careful how you handle the old gentleman about his
buying that land, for he's awful touchy about it. I
think he feels that he's made a mistake."</p>

<p>"I think I understand father; but sometime I should
like to talk with you more upon this question of land-holding."</p>

<p>"You have rightly said land-holding, for no man
can own the land."</p>

<p>"Not own land, Mr. Steadman! What do you
mean?"</p>

<!-- page 124 -->

<p>"I do not mean that they may not have a legal
claim to it; the slaveholder had a legal claim to the
slave, but not a rightful one, and no man has a rightful
claim to land only as he uses, occupies, and cultivates
it. I care not how many legal claims are set up, in
Nature's court of equity all that a man raises from any
land by his own labor is rightfully his, which could not
be if another man could rightfully own it."</p>

<p>"I must study this question, Mr. Steadman."</p>

<p>"Do so; but there comes your mother; kiss her
quick, now, and then help me out with this trunk, for
I cannot stop more than a minute."</p>

<p>George and his mother had many things to talk of;
John was to be married in two weeks, and as his wife
would come there to live, he laughingly said he
thought he could get along with two women to wait
upon him. There was much to be done as well as to
be said. Julia and her children were coming home on
a visit, and to be at the wedding, so the land question
did not come up for some time.</p>

<p>Julia remained some days after John's marriage, and
one day, when there was no one present but George and
their mother, she remarked: "If father had not that
land to pay for, you would get along all right now."</p>

<p>"I have said nothing to George about that yet."
said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"But I know it all the same, mother; Mr. Steadman
told me."</p>

<p>"And you have not even mentioned it to me."</p>

<p>"I thought you had enough else to think of now,
mother; but Mr. Steadman has some very peculiar ideas
about land-holding."</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>"Not so peculiar to me. Mr. Randal held the same;
but I never told your father so, and he never spoke of
it to anyone else; I don't think he could have kept his
school out if he had; times are changing."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall have more talk with Mr. Steadman,
and if I find he is correct, I shall advocate his views
whether people like them or not," replied George.</p>

<p>"Of course you will; but what's to be done about
that land your father has bargained for? He has
paid only two hundred dollars yet, and I would rather
lose that than have him go on, if there is any way to
get out of it."</p>

<p>"I fear there is none, mother. But for those soldier
claims we might let the land go; but as it is, Ozmun
has really half his pay, for the men have taken
father's obligation and released him."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said, with a sigh, "for it was
overwork that made your father sick in the first place.
He got some better, went to work, and overdid himself
again. I knew he would kill himself if he kept
on, so I sent for you."</p>

<p>"Was there no help to be had?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there are men enough who want work,
but when wheat began to go down he seemed frightened
and would not hire the help he needed lest he should
fail on his payment. Will Hines, the first of the soldiers
to be paid, has bought a house and lot in town with
his little earnings, and depends upon what is coming
from your father to finish paying for it and get his
deed. You know Will and our Edward were bosom
friends, and I think father would about as soon die as
disappoint him."</p>

<!-- page 126 -->

<p>"Completely tied up, I see. Well, I see no other way
but to go through with it," said George.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care so much, George, if it was once
paid for, but we don't need it, and a seven years' pull,
two hundred a year with interest on the balance, and
nearly all the work to be done by hired men&mdash;it is a
dreary outlook to me."</p>

<p>"Only six years after this fall, mother, and they will
not seem half so long if we don't keep counting them,"
said George, cheerily; for whenever George Gray decided
that a thing had to be done he always made the
best of it.</p>

<p>"Six hundred and forty acres of land ought to pay
that much without any trouble," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, daughter; but remember there is
your father and I, and John and his wife to board and
clothe, and now George, too; and the hired men to
board, their wages to be paid, and the extra taxes,
doctors' bills, the risk of loss of crops, prices of what
we raise going down&mdash;the risk is too great. We may
come out ahead and we may not."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said George, "how many children have
been ruined before birth by that kind of worry?" He
was thinking of John's wife.</p>

<p>Julia laughed. "You are a pretty fellow," she said,
"to be talking to us women on such subjects, and you
not yet twenty years old."</p>

<p>"If all young men were taught as I have taught
him, Julia, they would make better husbands and
fathers; but as it is they are taught the least about
that which they should understand the best," said Mrs.
Gray.</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"It is this one-sided man-power, of which I am
thinking, mother," said George. "Father has bought
this land against your wishes, against your better judgment,
and now we must work like slaves to help pay
for it."</p>

<p>Just here little Katie, Julia's oldest, ran in with a
handbill. "See," she said, "the man threw it over
the gate." George took it from her hand, and at the
same moment his father hobbled into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," he grumbled, "my back's nearly broke,
but I must try and get around a little&mdash;what's this?"
reaching for the paper in George's hand.</p>

<p>" 'Woman's Relation to Human Progress. Professor
Steadman will lecture at the town-hall to-night,
October 2d, on this most important of all subjects.
The public respectfully invited;' ho, ho, that crank;
everybody's professor nowadays."</p>

<p>"Who is he, father?" asked Julia.</p>

<p>"Our neighbor here; the man who don't believe
in people owning land."</p>

<p>"He must be a queer man; what could people do
without land?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he don't expect them to do without, but no
man is to own, to have a deed, and buy and sell; everybody
is to cultivate what they need and leave the rest
for someone else, any lazy devil that comes along."</p>

<p>George smiled as he said: "He couldn't be very
lazy, father, if he worked the land, and in that case
the lazy devils who will not work at all, but who happen
to have money, could not buy up the land and
force others to work it for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I expected that you would agree with

<!-- page 128 -->

him, and he is trying to make me believe I made a
mistake in buying Ozmun's land; but I guess I know
my own business."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear what he has to say," remarked
Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, wife; but the team can't be spared
now till that wheat's off to market."</p>

<p>"Never mind the team, father, I can walk."</p>

<p>"Yes, you look like it. Do you think I'll let you
work hard all day and then walk four miles at night?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked up with one of her comical smiles,
"You won't let me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't feel so cranky because I'm lame;
I have the law on my side, madam;" but he laughed
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>She ignored his last remark by saying, "It is only
two miles to the hall."</p>

<p>"And I suppose it isn't two miles back," he retorted.</p>

<p>"It didn't use to be when I went five nights out of
a week two miles to a revival meeting, and had you to
come home with me," she replied.</p>

<p>This turned the laugh on him, and he snapped out,
"That was all you went for; you didn't care for the
meeting."</p>

<p>"As much as most young folks care; but with you
with me I never minded the coming home; but I suppose
it will be different now, as you can't go," she
replied, and so demurely that her husband again
laughed.</p>

<p>"Better be careful, or I'll go just to spite you, my
lady," he said.</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>"I'll be careful," she replied in the same tone.</p>

<p>"Well, go if you must; but you don't walk, I can tell
you that," he said, assuming a severe tone again.</p>

<p>So when evening came they were all on hand for the
lecture except little Katie, who said she would stay
and take care of grandpa. John thought at first that
his foot was too sore, but when he found that Margaret
wanted to go he decided that perhaps he could
stand it. Grandpa thought he could get along a little
while with only Katie; "but I have seen the time,"
he said, "when Lucy would not have gone without
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, James, I used to be very foolish, but it is
hardly fair to tell me of it before the children," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, go along with you, you always make me wish
I hadn't said anything," and turning upon his heel he
went back to his room as fast as his back would let
him, and Katie told her mother he said, "What an
infernal fool I was to keep lifting those bags of wheat
after my back commenced hurting me."</p>

<p>The hall was filled, and many were surprised to see
their own townsman take the platform. They had
supposed that some stranger was to speak, and that
the name merely happened to be the same as that of
their cranky neighbor. And they were surprised to
see him so well dressed and so gentlemanly in his manners.</p>

<p>"Friends," he said, "I was brought up in the country.
I am a farmer's son&mdash;not one who owned the
land he cultivated, but a tenant farmer. My mother
was a rich man's daughter, who was disinherited for

<!-- page 130 -->

marrying the man of her choice. She died when I was
sixteen years of age, and then my rich relatives offered
to take me and educate me, provided my father
would give me up wholly to them.</p>

<p>"This he consented to do, for he felt that he could
not survive my mother long, which he did not, and he
wished to see me well provided for; it thus happens
that I am a kind of mongrel. But I love the country;
it has been a pleasure to make myself one with
you; so you see before you Professor Steadman the
speaker, or farmer Steadman the crank, just as you
wish, and at your service."</p>

<p>This good-natured explanation put them all at their
ease and prepared them to listen favorably to what he
had to say.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he continued, "the subject
announced is one to which little attention has been paid
in the past, but it must come to the front or our Republic
will prove a grand failure, a magnificent ruin.
I hope there are no such men in this intelligent audience,
but there are those who think it their inalienable
right to make laws for their mothers; but that the
mothers would be entirely out of place in assisting to
make the laws by which all are expected to be governed.</p>

<p>"Such men&mdash;I say again I hope there are none such
present, for I am afraid I should hurt their feelings&mdash;such
men think women have not the brain-power for
such arduous work; but should there be such men present,
I would say to them: 'Every ounce of brains you
have, sirs, was gestated beneath a woman's heart,' and
who are you that claim to be superior to her whose

<!-- page 131 -->

life-blood fed your brains in their growth, to her from
whom you received your brains?</p>

<p>"No, I do not believe with Paul that woman should
be subject to man, or that modesty requires that she
sit with covered head in the presence of husband,
sons, and brothers. The trouble is, my friends, man
has not understood woman; neither has she understood
herself, hence her weakness, so called&mdash;that in
which her greatest power lies, either for good or evil&mdash;has
been quoted as a term of reproach. 'As nervous
as a woman,' is a term used to designate weakness in
man; but have you any idea why woman's nerves, as
a rule, are so much more sensitive than man's?</p>

<p>"If you will go with me to the room of a photographer,
and watch the process of likeness-taking, I think
I can make you understand what I mean. The first
thing the artist does is to pour upon the plate or glass
a solution of ether and gun-cotton, into which certain
chemicals have been dissolved. The ether evaporates,
leaving the chemicals in the gun-cotton, which coats
the plate, which is next taken into the dark room and
immersed in a liquid solution of silver. The chemicals
in the coating of the plate now combine with the silver,
and this combination makes the coating exceedingly
sensitive, susceptible to the action of the rays
of light.</p>

<p>"What do I mean by sensitive? Hold up your hand
and the atmosphere creates no pain upon its surface.
Uncover the nerve of a tooth and then see. So of that
plate; the light will make no more impression upon it
before it is sensitized by the mingling of the chemicals
and the liquid silver, than the air does upon the back

<!-- page 132 -->

of your hand; but after the gun-cotton coating has
taken up all the silver it will hold, then it is as sensitive
as the nerve of a tooth.</p>

<p>"Nature protects the nerve of the tooth, and if we
would have the desired result we must protect the
coated plate till it is in the right position to receive
the impression we wish; so it is taken from the silver
bath and enclosed in a little box called a tablet; then
it is brought out of the dark room, the ground glass is
taken from the camera-box, and the tablet put in its
place. Previous to this the artist has placed you just
where the rays of light which strike you can be reflected
back upon the lens of the camera. The slide
in the tablet is then drawn, and the lens uncovered,
and the rays of light reflected back from the one
whose likeness is being taken, pass through the lens
and reach that prepared&mdash;that sensitized plate&mdash;making
the impression or likeness.</p>

<p>"Now mark: The prepared plate corresponds to
the unborn babe in Nature's tablet, and the sensitive
nerves of the mother are the lens of the camera
through which impressions are made upon the child
before birth."</p>

<p>Here he paused a full half minute and then asked:
"What would be the effect if, when having your likeness
taken, a fly should light upon your nose just as
the lens of the camera was uncovered? Please answer,
any one who knows."</p>

<p>"I should have the picture of a fly upon the nose of
my likeness," said George Gray.</p>

<p>"Right, young man, and permit me to say that
there is no process known by which the likeness could

<!-- page 133 -->

be developed, as it is called, without bringing out the
fly. I will now repeat:</p>

<p>"The prepared plate corresponds to the unborn
babe in Nature's tablet, or dark room, and the mother's
nerves to the lens of the camera, through which
impressions are made upon the child before birth; and
the influences which act upon her, the conditions which
surround her during that sacred and critical time, determine
in a measure the future of the child, its character
for good or ill.</p>

<p>"This is done, first, by the direct action of the
nerves, as in case of what are called birthmarks, or indirectly
by affecting her thoughts, her feelings, thus,
as it were, chemicalizing her blood, and giving character
to the child through the elements that go to make
up its brain. This being true, the finer, the more
sensitive the mothers, the greater the good or evil
to the race, as coming through good or bad surroundings."</p>

<p>He then went on to paint some of the conditions and
surroundings under which prospective mothers, many
of them, are forced to live. He took his audience to
the city, painted the tenement-houses, the attics, the
cellars, the alleys, the saloons, the gambling hells. He
then pointed to the immense tracts of land claimed by
individuals, and held for a rise; spoke of the millions
of acres of government land, of the thousands of families
who might find homes thereon could they have a little
assistance; of the extra cost to cities in the way of
police force, prosecutions and imprisonments, which
applied year by year would soon relieve the crowded
condition of the cities, if the cities could do without

<!-- page 134 -->

those who were thus stowed away in cellars and garrets.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean it, if the cities could do without them,"
he repeated, bringing his hand down with terrible emphasis,
"but they cannot. What do I mean? I mean
that your present property system generates crime as
truly as stagnant pools generate miasma. Children&mdash;grown
children, men and women you call them&mdash;have
been born under conditions that make it impossible for
them to be good. The fly has been stamped upon the
nose, the spirit of murder upon the brain, and what
is to be done?</p>

<p>"What do I mean by saying that cities cannot do
without a degraded class? I will show you. Suppose
the power you call God answered prayers. The poet
says, and truly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'Each hour a million knees are bent,<br/>

A million prayers to heaven are sent;<br/>

There's not a woe afflicts our race,<br/>

But some one bears to the throne of grace.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Suppose the prayers put up for those poor children,
for those degraded fathers and mothers&mdash;degraded as
to condition, if not otherwise&mdash;suppose those prayers
should be answered and every one of them be taken
from their miserable surroundings and placed in the
country; good homes, healthy work, and all needed
comforts furnished, what would be the result?</p>

<p>"Judge Hendricks says: 'Mary, I cannot furnish
the money for you to go to Europe this year. My
tenement-house on Bleecker Street is empty, and no
prospect of tenants. Fifty families at from five to ten

<!-- page 135 -->

dollars a month was quite an item, and I don't see how
I am to get along.'</p>

<p>"Deacon Careful says: 'Those three saloons and
that house on Dupont Street are empty, and I can't
help build a new church now,' and so on to the end of
the chapter. Thousands would be entirely broken up
because their rat-riddled rooms were no longer occupied.
In fact, the city would collapse as if its bowels
had been torn out; everything would be disarranged.
The bears on Wall Street would growl, and the bulls
would bellow, and the collapse would be simply terrible.</p>

<p>"But it's got to come, friends; not just in that way,
perhaps, but when our men&mdash;the masses of men&mdash;begin
to understand the necessity of giving woman the best
of conditions in order to a grand motherhood, the
divine in the hearts of fathers, husbands, brothers, and
sons will so assert itself as to overthrow all that stands
in woman's way.</p>

<p>"The Catholics make Mary the queen of heaven;
we shall be content when our Marys, and Janes, and
Julias are queens in their own right&mdash;the right to themselves."</p>

<p>It is useless to attempt to do justice to the lecture
unless quoted as a whole, but there is one more point
that should not be left out.</p>

<p>"You are often told," he said, "how much stronger
and better your grandmothers were; what families
they brought up; how much more work they could do;
is it not just possible that if they had done less you
might be able to do more?"</p>

<p>There were tears in the eyes of more than one, and

<!-- page 136 -->

the first words uttered by the Grays when the lecture
was over were: "Oh, I wish father had been here."</p>

<p>A few days after the land subject came up for discussion,
but James Gray would not admit but that he
had done a wise thing.</p>

<p>"I don't see," he said, "what there is to worry
about; with fencing, the place will feed cattle enough
to pay for it."</p>

<p>"But it will cost something to fence so much land,
father," said George; "that which you had is not all
fenced yet."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but John is fit for nothing else now
but to ride horse and herd cattle."</p>

<p>"But suppose there should come a drouth to ruin
the crops and the grass, what then?"</p>

<p>"Bother your suppositions; suppose Noah's flood
comes back; I guess we could stand it as well as
others."</p>

<p>George said no more; Julia went to her home, sixty
miles distant, the next day, and things soon fell into
their old routine, with the exception that Mrs. Gray
did not have to work quite so hard now she had John's
wife to help her.</p>

<p>Once afterward Mr. Gray, in referring to the land
matter, remarked: "I suppose you will not help me
any longer than till you are of age, George?"</p>

<p>"I do not think I shall remain on a farm after that,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I have about a year and a half yet, and I
shall make the most of it, young man."</p>

<p>"All right, father."</p>

<p>This reply seemed to irritate him, and he continued

<!-- page 137 -->

in a complaining tone: "John was fighting for his
country and exposed to all sorts of hardships while
you were taking your comfort with those aristocratic
cousins, and I think it no more than right that he
should be provided for."</p>

<p>As George did not reply there was nothing further
said.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">ANOTHER STORY.</p>

</div>

<p>GEORGE GRAY really remained at home a
little over two years, and the claim of the
last of the three soldiers was paid for,
the day before he left for the East again.
From thence on the payments were to be
made directly to Mr. Ozmun, who had already received
two hundred and forty dollars as interest. Four payments
more, four years of anxiety and careful saving,
four years of pinching the heart out of life's enjoyment,
the sentence, "that note must be met," ever before
them&mdash;the handwriting of fate upon the wall of
the future.</p>

<p>M. Costin was still with the Raymonds, but in a
little more than a year he was to return to France
for a final settlement with his half-brother, of his
father's estate. His mother and grandfather lived in
a little town just across the Hudson River, and about
ten miles from the city. His mother had visited him
twice; the second time his grandfather was with
her, and they remained several days; but M. Costin
himself seldom went anywhere, only as he visited
them.</p>

<p>Once Walter came in highly excited, and said that
as he was passing the Catholic church he heard one of

<!-- page 139 -->

the men address a priest who was standing on the
steps as Father Bremen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he is here, I have seen him on the
street twice, but I do not think he recognized me;
however, there is no knowing," said M. Costin, quietly.</p>

<p>"I can see no reason for being afraid of him; you
had a right to leave them if you chose," said Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>"They will not try to do anything publicly; if they
ever harm me it will be in secret and in a way that it
cannot be traced to them."</p>

<p>"Well, they would hardly be likely to know you
after so many years, and under another name."</p>

<p>"It has not been very many years, Mrs. Raymond.
I was not twenty-one when I left for France, and I
was gone only a year, counting the trip both ways, and
a few weeks that I spent with my mother's people in
England, and I have been back but eight years."</p>

<p>"That tells us how old you are, monsieur. If you
don't marry soon you will be an old bachelor," said
Mrs. Raymond, playfully.</p>

<p>"Not quite thirty, madam, but I think the Church
lost track of me when I went to France. They would
naturally expect that I would claim my inheritance,
and as I made no move in that direction that could be
traced, they were, no doubt, nonplussed. Besides, I
have known of some of their methods in another case,
and for a time I was in the same house, and had they
suspected me I should have seen some sign of it before
now."</p>

<p>"In another case?" repeated Mabel.</p>

<p>"Yes, the case of a priest who had forsaken the

<!-- page 140 -->

Church and married. If you would like, I will tell you
the story."*</p>

<p class="small">[*A true story as to facts.]</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us, please," said Mrs. Raymond, while
Mabel looked the same request.</p>

<p>"Soon after I returned from France," he began, "I
boarded for a time with a widow lady named Fisher.
One day a dark, Spanish-looking gentleman came and
asked for board and room for himself and wife. Mrs.
Fisher had but one empty room, and that was back
from the street, but on the first floor.</p>

<p>" 'I will bring my wife,' he said, after looking at
the room, 'and if it will suit her we will take it.' I
happened to be in the sitting-room when he came, and
I noticed a sad, hunted look upon his face.</p>

<p>"He was gone about an hour and then returned with
his wife, and as she seemed satisfied with the room
they remained, and their trunks came in the evening.
I said to Mrs. Fisher, in reply to her expressions of
admiration for the couple, 'They are in trouble; something
is hidden.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, I hope not,' she said, 'I do not like to have
suspicious characters in my house."</p>

<p>" 'Cannot one be in trouble and not be a suspicious
character?' I asked.</p>

<p>"They gave the name of Dusharm. They were
very quiet. Mrs. Dusharm said her husband was not
well, had become despondent, and shrank from society;
that she did not like to oppose his wishes as it seemed
to make him worse.</p>

<p>" 'Are you French?' I asked, knowing Dusharm to
be a French name.</p>

<!-- page 141 -->

<p>" 'My husband is,' she replied, and when I told her
I was French, she said she wished I would try and interest
Mr. Dusharm; so I made an excuse to rap at
their door one day, and when she came to the door I
said, 'Madam, as your name is French, and I am
French and alone in this country, I would like, with
your permission, a better acquaintance.'</p>

<p>"She turned to her husband with: 'Henry, here is
a countryman of yours.' He bowed a cold assent, and I
was invited in, but she did the most of the talking.
Once or twice he became temporarily interested, but
he soon fell back into a sort of listless state that I could
see distressed his wife, and my conviction that something
was troubling them both was strengthened by this
interview; still I did not once associate the thought
of crime with them. No, it was not that. He was no
criminal hiding from justice.</p>

<p>"The fourth morning after they came a boy brought
a note to the door for Mrs. Fisher which read: 'You
have suspicious persons in your house; the gentleman
and his wife. A word to the wise is sufficient.'</p>

<p>" 'You were right,' she said, handing me the note,
'there is something wrong about these people.'</p>

<p>" 'I beg your pardon,' I replied, 'I did not say there
was anything wrong, neither do I believe there is.'</p>

<p>" 'But what do you make of the note?' she asked.</p>

<p>" 'An anonymous note, Mrs. Fisher, proves that
they have an enemy or enemies somewhere; but if
there is crime it is more likely to be the one who is
afraid to sign his name to a paper calculated to injure
another.'</p>

<p>" 'You may be right,' she said, 'but they must not

<!-- page 142 -->

stay here. I have myself and children to support, and
there must be no scandal connected with my house.'</p>

<p>" 'What will you do, tell them you have received
this note?'</p>

<p>" 'No, that would be too embarrassing, but I will
find some excuse.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, what hypocrites and cowards society makes
of us,' I said; 'here you will send these people away
because of a note some coward sends, and not even give
them a chance for self-defence.'</p>

<p>" 'I cannot help it, M. Costin,' she replied, 'it must
be done.' She sat down and wrote a note saying that
she was going to have unexpected company, and so
needed the room, and sent it to them by her little boy.
About ten minutes after, Mr. Dusharm came into the
room.</p>

<p>" 'Madam,' said he, 'I do not wish to be impertinent,
but I have a reason for asking, will you please tell
me of what Church you are a member?'</p>

<p>"She looked surprised, but replied, 'I am not a
member of any church, but I usually attend the Methodist.'</p>

<p>" 'Not a Catholic then,' he said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>" 'No, not a Catholic, certainly.'</p>

<p>"The manner in which she pronounced the last
word seem to inspire him with confidence, and taking
a seat he said, 'I think I will tell you my story. It
can do no harm, to say the least.' His wife in the
meantime had come in, and she took a seat near him.
He took out his handkerchief, wiped his forehead and
began:</p>

<p>" 'I am, or was, a Catholic priest. My parents were

<!-- page 143 -->

Protestants, but they were very poor. We lived near
a Catholic school and the Sisters were very kind to us.
I attended their school, came under their influence or
psychological power, and decided to prepare for the
ministry. In this I had every assistance, as you can
readily believe; but after taking orders I found that
many things had been kept back, and I became very
much dissatisfied. When under the first smart of this
disappointment I met the lady who is now my wife.
Her attractions completed my alienation; I forsook the
Church and married her.'</p>

<p>"When he announced himself an ex-priest I had,
almost without knowing it, drawn my chair nearer his.
I think he must have read my sympathy in my face,
for his voice grew firmer as he proceeded. 'From that
time to this we have been followed by an invisible but
no less effectual persecution. We are driven from place
to place, and I am tired out. You, madam, have, no
doubt, as did the others, received an anonymous note.
It seems impossible to go anywhere but they find us.'</p>

<p>"Here he sank back in his chair, turned very pale,
and we thought he was going to faint; but his wife took
both his hands firmly in hers, and presently the color
came back to his face.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Mr. Dusharm,' said Mrs. Fisher when he rallied,
'I have received such a note, but my sympathies
are with you, and but for one thing you should stay.
The man of whom I rent is a Catholic, and there would
be some excuse gotten up for putting me out. With
that and their insinuations they could ruin me.'</p>

<p>"I laughed at this. 'You think,' I said, 'they
would be as adept at finding excuses as you are.'</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"She colored and asked, 'What is a poor woman to
do?'</p>

<p>" 'We can none of us do anything, we are helpless,'
said Dusharm, despondently.</p>

<p>" 'If you could only rise out of your depressed condition,
Henry, we could defy them,' said Mrs. Dusharm.</p>

<p>" 'Why do you not come out boldly and face them?
There are plenty of Protestant homes in which you
would be safe from their persecutions,' I said.</p>

<p>"He shook his head, and his wife said, 'He has lost
faith in all religions and only wishes to be left alone;
he is sick, and there is no fight in him.'</p>

<p>"Just here Bridget opened the door and asked,
'Did you call, mistress?'</p>

<p>" 'No, but this gentleman and his wife are going to
leave; are you not sorry?'</p>

<p>" 'An' sure an' he's a foine gintleman, and it's a
swate lady he has, it's a pity they don't stay,' and she
disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dusharm went to the table, took pencil and
paper and hastily drew the form of a serpent, held it
up where we could all see it, nodded in the direction
of the kitchen, and then walked to the grate and laid
the paper on the coals.</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' I said in response, 'and our Edens are continually
poisoned by his slimy trail.'</p>

<p>"Dusharm turned toward me with a look I shall
never forget as he said: 'The Church used itself as a
pattern for its devil.'</p>

<p>" 'And yet there are good people in the Catholic
Church,' said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p>" 'Yes, madam, in all churches, but they are not
wise people, or they would not be there; they are stool
pigeons for crafty designers,' he replied.</p>

<p>"She seemed a little shocked that he should repudiate
all religions, but her sympathy for them prevailed,
and she said: 'I wish I could keep you here.'</p>

<p>" 'It does not matter, madam, I prefer to find another
place now.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, don't leave till your week is up, and I shall
pay you back your money; it shall cost you nothing
for that time.'</p>

<p>"The couple expressed their thanks and returned to
their room. This occurred on Monday morning, and
it was understood that they would leave on Wednesday.
I felt very much like going up and giving them my
own history, but finally did not. Dusharm went out
during the day, but the next day his wife took his
meals to him, saying he was sick, and in the morning
of the day they were expected to leave they did not
respond when they were called, and upon investigation
it was found that they were gone.</p>

<p>"The unfastened window showed the way of their
exit, and the night being dark facilitated their purpose.
Trunks and all had been lifted out, the lower
part of the window being about as high from the
ground as a man's shoulders, and they must have been
carried at least thirty feet, as no conveyance could have
got nearer than that."</p>

<p>"And did you never hear anything more from
them?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"I did, though I do not think Mrs. Fisher ever did.
It was coming winter and I decided to visit California,

<!-- page 146 -->

and by water, and the third day out, while walking on
the upper deck of the steamer, I came face to face
with Mrs. Dusharm. 'You here, Mrs.&mdash;' but there
was that in her look which arrested my words, 'Winters,'
she added, as I hesitated; 'yes, I am here; but I
see you are not as good at remembering names as I
am, Monsieur Costin,' she continued, as she gave me
her hand.</p>

<p>" 'I am rather stupid about names,' I said, as I returned
her grasp; 'but where is Mr.&mdash;' Dusharm I was
going to say, but she interrupted with, 'Mr. Winters is
lying down, he is a little seasick. Had I known you
were contemplating a trip to California when I met you
at Cousin Julia's, I should have suggested that we go at
the same time, as it is more pleasant in a journey like
this to have someone you have known along, even if it
is but a slight acquaintance; but you are here now, and
it is all right.'</p>

<p>"There were others near; I knew she did it all for
a purpose, and readily acted my part. I found Mr.
Dusharm, or Winters, as he was registered on shipboard,
looking much better, and his wife was as bright
and as charming a woman as one often meets. She
called her husband Lewis instead of Henry, so, as far
as names were concerned they were quite other people
than when I first met them.</p>

<p>"We had been out nearly two weeks, had crossed
the Isthmus, and were steaming up the broad Pacific at
satisfactory speed; Mrs. Dusharm and myself were
sitting upon the steerage-deck away from all the
others, when Dusharm came to us looking as pale
as death. 'Wife, it is of no use, we are tracked,' he

<!-- page 147 -->

said, sinking into a seat and dropping his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>" 'Are you sure?' she asked, in a steady voice,
though she too paled.</p>

<p>" 'As sure as I am here. The clerk just called me
by name; I thought his face looked familiar.'</p>

<p>" 'Is he a priest in disguise?' she asked.</p>

<p>" 'No, a lay Jesuit, I think, wife.'</p>

<p>"She turned to me with, 'I think the Church is the
beast spoken of in Revelation, it has eyes on all sides;
we came to the steamer in separate hacks and from
different directions, and I disguised myself and bought
tickets for two.'</p>

<p>" 'The devil helps his own,' said Dusharm.</p>

<p>" 'Do not say the devil, Mr. Winters, for of the two
mythological characters he is the best,' I replied, getting
up and walking back and forth in my excitement.
I could keep it back no longer. I turned, and sitting
down beside them again, I told them who and what I
was.</p>

<p>"They listened to my story, and then Dusharm
said: 'You slipped away from them quietly, and they
lost the trail at first, while I openly defied them, and
then tried to escape while their eyes were upon me,
and that is the difference. Let them once get track of
you again, and then see if they ever lose it.'</p>

<p>" 'Well,' said Mrs. Dusharm, 'we will fight it out
now; they dare not kill us: it would attract too much
attention, and that is what they don't want; but I had
hoped we were free from their espionage.'</p>

<p>"From that time on Dusharm seemed utterly despondent.
When we reached San Francisco they went

<!-- page 148 -->

to a little town about fifty miles away, and I remained
in the city. Returning here in the spring, I did not
see them again, but he lived only a few months; and
from her letters I learned she believed him to have
been poisoned."</p>

<p>"Poisoned!" exclaimed Mrs. Raymond, while Mabel's
dilating eyes spoke for her.</p>

<p>"Yes, slow poison put into his wine. She believed
it began before I first met them, and that it was the
cause of his apathetic condition, of the sort of shrinking
from which she could not arouse him. She said:</p>

<p>" 'I never drink wine, but the priests all do, and
Henry continued the habit. One day a priest, an old
man, called to talk with him about the step he had
taken. We thought it a little strange, but Henry had
been one of his favorites, and he seemed so grieved
we could not do otherwise than treat him kindly. Before
he left, Henry called for a particular brand of
wine of which they were fond. They sat and talked
and drank till it was all gone, the old man remarking,
"I ought not to do this, but it will come all right at
last." Henry never seemed the same afterward. At
the time I attributed it to the priest's influence, and
thought it would soon wear off; but I now believe that
the infamous work commenced then, and that they
found opportunity to repeat the dose from time to
time. Could I see you,' she continued, 'I could give
you many little incidents which have confirmed me in
this belief, but they are too many and too connected
with other things to be easily put into a letter. A few
days before his death the priest of the place came to
see him. I saw him coming and suspected his object,

<!-- page 149 -->

so locked Henry's door and put the key in my
pocket.</p>

<p>" ' "Madam," he said, "I wish to see Mr. Dusharm."</p>

<p>" ' "He does not see anyone," I replied, and was about
to close the door, when he pushed past me.</p>

<p>" ' "Madam," said he, "I know your secret; the man
you call husband is going to die. He has grievously
sinned, but the Church is very merciful, and I would
give him absolution."</p>

<p>" ' "You cannot see him," I replied.</p>

<p>" ' "I shall not leave, madam, till I know for myself
what his wish is," he persisted.</p>

<p>" 'I called through the locked door, "Henry, the
priest is here, do you wish to see him?" "Not in this
world, nor in the world to come," was the prompt response.
The priest stepped to the door, and finding
it locked, turned upon his heel with:</p>

<p>" ' "Very well, I have done my duty; his ruin be
upon his own head&mdash;and upon yours," he added, after a
moment's struggling with his rage at being foiled. I
think he would have killed me if he had dared.
Henry's answer was very positive, but could the priest
once have caught his eye, in his weak state he could
not have resisted the psychologic power that would
have been exerted, and would have done just as he
was told. I knew this and determined to protect him.'</p>

<p>"I have thus given you the contents of her letter in
nearly or quite in her own words," said M. Costin, as
he concluded.</p>

<p>Mabel drew a long breath, "What a work there is to
be done," she said.</p>

<p>M. Costin looked at her with his soul in his eyes:

<!-- page 150 -->

"Miss Mabel, you have no idea of the strength of the
Church and the money power combined; you had better
give up your idea of helping to change all this, and
try to enjoy life as it is," he said.</p>

<p>She turned her luminous eyes full upon him: "I
cannot, I cannot," she said; "I could just as easily be
happy with the shrieks of the dying ringing in my
ears. No, I must work to change all this, must work
while life shall last, and no heaven can hold me when my
body is dead, so long as these things are done on earth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond listened with wonder. Could it be
her Mabel, her baby that she had nourished and cared
for, a girl not yet eighteen years old, who was talking
thus, who was pouring forth such a tide of feeling?</p>

<p>M. Costin, too, felt the power of her words, and the
intensity of feeling was becoming almost painful when
Walter rushed in with: "Oh, Meb, George is coming
back; father's just had a letter, and he'll be here
Saturday. Say, Meb, I think you'll be too well off.
Here's my humble self, always proud of your company,
and Monsieur ready at all times to be your obedient
servant, and now, when George comes, which of us
must stand aside?"</p>

<p>"Walter," said Mrs. Raymond, in that peculiar tone
which always meant so much.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, mother, and all of yees," bowing all
round, and so comically that they could but laugh. "I
beg pardon, but you looked so serious I had to do
something to break the spell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond noticed the shadow that overspread
M. Costin's face when George's name was mentioned,
but she said nothing.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 151 -->

<div class="center" id="ch09">

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">TWO BIRTHDAYS.</p>

</div>

<p>GEORGE GRAY took his old place and resumed
his studies, and things went on
much as they had done when he was there
before. True, Mabel was a young lady
now, in her eighteenth year, and Walter
was nearly twenty-one; but George had grown just as
much older than he was, so their relative positions had
not changed.</p>

<p>Mabel was the same straightforward, true-hearted
girl as of yore, but her happy flow of spirits had given
place to an earnest thoughtfulness that made her seem
more like a woman of thirty instead of only a little
past seventeen. Walter's birthday came about three
months before Mabel's did, and he was continually referring
to it and planning this and that "to celebrate
my advent into the ranks of manhood," he would say,
in his jocular, off-hand way; but Mabel said nothing
about hers.</p>

<p>"Come, Meb," Walter would say, catching her in his
arms and whirling her around, "come Meb, don't look
as if the world rested on your little white shoulders,
but tell us what's to be done when the auspicious morn
arrives that ushers in your freedom day. Funny, isn't
it, that girls should come of age three years sooner

<!-- page 152 -->

than boys do. I expect it's because they are not capable
of such exalted positions, so it don't take 'em so
long to fit for it, eh?" Mabel would only smile at all
this banter, and Walter would go off declaring her the
beatenest girl he ever did see.</p>

<p>"What does beatenest mean, Walter?" asked his
mother.</p>

<p>"Beatenest, why, that she beats everything, of
course; give me something harder, mother, for I am
almost a man, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, and I know there is a great deal of
sound sense under all that rattling, or I should feel that
you would never be a man in fact, whatever you might
be in years."</p>

<p>"There, now, mother, don't preach and I'll be good,
sure," and away he would go, singing something laughable,
yet he was a good scholar and applied himself entirely
to his books in his hours of study. His fun
seemed a necessity, a recreation that he must have.
When his birthday came it was celebrated according
to his wish by a party, and the house was one brilliant
illumination from top to bottom, music, dancing,
etc.</p>

<p>Mabel joined in with the others, but a close observer
might have seen that though with the others she was
not of them. She was known to have a very sweet
voice and she was several times importuned to sing.
She complied twice, but when, to fill up a pause in the
dancing, she was called upon the third time she refused,
but promised one last piece before they broke up.
With this they were obliged to be content, and when
Walter asked her what she intended to sing she said

<!-- page 153 -->

he would know when he heard it, that she had not
fully decided yet.</p>

<p>When the time came she went to the organ and
played and sang "The Watcher:"</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"A watcher, pale and tearful."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>When she came to the verse,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Ye gay and thoughtless creatures,<br/>

One light from out your store<br/>

Would give that fair boy's features<br/>

To his mother's gaze once more,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>there went a flash of resentment over the faces of some
of the company when the first line of it was being
sung, but the tender pathos of her tone prevailed, and
when she concluded there were tears in the eyes of
more than one of her listeners. As her voice lingered
over the last words she arose and faced the company:</p>

<p>"My young friends," she said, "I have not done
this to destroy your pleasure but to help you to think.
Because there are hundreds in this city to-night too
poor to purchase even a candle, it does not make it
wrong that we have lights many, or that music and
dancing are out of place, but we are just entering upon
the active duties of life and we should work to bring
about a condition of things in which none need comfort
themselves for the lack of light here by saying,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">" 'There's light for us in heaven.' "</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>When she commenced singing, Walter had said, in
an undertone, "Oh, Meb," but she sang on as though

<!-- page 154 -->

she had not heard, but when she closed with a speech,
as Walter called the few words she said, her friends
were astonished. Mabel was generally so quiet and
retiring they could hardly believe their ears; but Mrs.
Raymond felt a thrill of satisfaction in witnessing her
daughter's perfect self-possession under what would
have been a very trying position to almost anyone, no
matter how much in earnest and in sympathy with the
sentiment.</p>

<p>George Gray gazed upon her as though he saw a
being from another world almost, such was his admiration;
and meeting M. Costin's look he saw more
than admiration. It was intense, worshipful love that
illuminated the teacher's features. It was only a moment,
however, that he so far forgot himself as to
allow his feelings to come to the surface. When he
caught George's eye he was himself again, his features
under perfect control; but George caught also, in the
flash of the change, the fear that he himself was a
rival. This set him thinking.</p>

<p>"Do I love her? I have never thought of her in
that light, but what are my real feelings?" were the
questions he asked himself, and he spent a sleepless
night in trying to solve the problem. Finally he said:
"No, I do not love her; I will not love her. I have
nothing to offer her. I came here a poor boy, am poor
yet, and indebted to her father's kindness&mdash;and her
mother's&mdash;for much that I am, and I feel certain that
she has never thought of love. Her heart is in the
work she has chosen, and her mind must not be diverted,
disturbed. I am glad M. Costin's look brought
me to my senses before I was too far gone to use reason.

<!-- page 155 -->

I wonder if he will ever tell her. He has wealth,
and he is worthy&mdash;as worthy as anyone can be&mdash;of her.
As anyone can be," he repeated; "but she is peerless&mdash;take
care there, George Gray, don't make a fool of
yourself after all," and summoning his will-power he
dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>That Mabel's song and speech elicited much comment
was to be expected. Some said she was loony,
some that she was preparing herself for a Woman's
Rights lecturer, and others made other remarks equally
untrue and unkind. It is true that some had their
feelings touched to tenderness at the time, but all but
one or two rebelled afterward. "It was out of place;"
"It was an insult&mdash;calling them thoughtless;" "They
guessed they did as much thinking as Miss Raymond
did."</p>

<p>Not one, except those in her own home, knew that
there was nothing premeditated in what she had done&mdash;that
it was but the spontaneous outflowing of the
feelings uppermost in her heart.</p>

<p>That night, or morning, rather, when Mabel retired,
her mother went to her room and said: "Thee did
right, daughter; the Spirit moved thee to speak and
thou wert not afraid. The spirits of thy ancestors are
with thee:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'Though unseen, but yet, believe me,<br/>

They thy footsteps will direct.' "</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Mamma, dear, hast thou turned poet?" said Mabel,
smiling with a look of more real enjoyment than her
face had shown during the party&mdash;"hast thou turned
poet, or become a Spiritual medium?"</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>"The Spirit, the Infinite through the finite, moves
upon us all in accordance with our life-work, daughter.
The finite channels with which we connect may be our
friends in that life; why not? do they forget us?"
was the reply, and then, as if wondering at herself, she
added: "Strange, what this is that comes over me; I
feel as if myself and yet not myself."</p>

<p>"That is just the way I felt to-night when singing
and talking," was Mabel's reply.</p>

<p>"Well, we will work on and trust in the right.
Good-night, daughter, and pleasant dreams;" and Mrs.
Raymond repaired to her own room with the intention
of sleeping, but she lay and thought instead.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly, and it was but three days
till Mabel would be eighteen years old. Once or twice
her mother had referred to it with the intent of learning
what were the girl's feelings in reference to some
sort of entertainment, or something to commemorate
the day, but she had said nothing; on that morning,
she asked:</p>

<p>"Mother, would you object to my having a few
young girls here on the evening of the tenth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Who do you want?"</p>

<p>"Not any of those in my own circle; they would
only laugh at my ideas, and I could not presume to
teach them. There are poor but good girls that I
could instruct, and I want them all to myself. I want
a good supper prepared and some presents for each,
that they may remember my birthday with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thee shall have it as thee wishes; but what wilt
thou do before evening?"</p>

<p>"I want to visit the homes of the poor, to go

<!-- page 157 -->

through some of those tenement-houses and see for
myself under what conditions women become mothers."</p>

<p>"But you cannot go alone, dear; who do you want
to go with you?"</p>

<p>"Yourself and M. Costin. Walter would only annoy
me with his nonsense, and George is too busy
helping father. You two will be enough."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond at first thought she would object to
M. Costin's going, as she feared that Mabel's preference
in this matter would encourage the man to hope
for what was not likely to be realized; but upon second
thought she decided to say nothing. She knew that
Mabel had no idea of what she herself suspected, and
she could not object without giving her reason, and so
remained silent.</p>

<p>The birthday came; a carriage was at the door ready
to convey the parties wherever they wished, and to
wait as long as desired. "Where shall we go, Mabel?"
asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"To Hester Street; I saw a notice in the <i>Sun</i> a few
days ago of the cloak-makers there," was the reply.
The driver looked surprised, but obeyed orders.</p>

<p>The place was reached, and the investigation commenced.
We will not try to follow them through all
the rooms, or describe what they saw of the conditions
under which children are born, grow to womanhood,
live&mdash;if their wretched existence can be called living&mdash;become
mothers, and after a few years die, leaving
their wretched offspring to fight it out in their struggle
for existence as best they can.</p>

<p>Several times Mabel turned so pale that the others

<!-- page 158 -->

feared she would faint. They urged her to give it up
and return home, but her answer was:</p>

<p>"I can stand for a few hours what these have to endure
continually."</p>

<p>A description of one room&mdash;of dozens, yes, hundreds
and thousands that can be found in that great city&mdash;will
give the reader some idea of what met their eyes
at every turn.</p>

<p>A rap upon a door that led somewhere, and a "Come
in;" the inmates could not spare the time from their
work to get up and see what was wanted. They open
the door and start to enter, but find almost every inch
of available space occupied.</p>

<p>"Friends," said Mrs. Raymond, as they paused and
looked over the group, "we want to talk with you a
little while."</p>

<p>"No time to fool away," said the woman nearest,
"we have to earn our bread."</p>

<p>"We will pay you for your time," said Mabel; "we
are gathering information, and seeing a statement in
the <i>Sun</i> in reference to your condition, we wish to see
if it is true."</p>

<p>The women, six in number, looked at her as if they
thought her daft, all but one, and she kept her eyes
fixed upon her work. "The <i>Sun</i> is the name of a
newspaper published in this city," she explained, seeing
that they did not comprehend her.</p>

<p>"Oh, an' are they ral'y puttin' us in the papers?"
said one.</p>

<p>Mabel took a survey of the scene: a room not more
than twelve feet square filled with women, sewing-machines,
and stacks of cloaks ready to be put together.

<!-- page 159 -->

She noticed that they did not pause a moment in their
work, but kept their fingers flying as though driven
by steam. "Here," she said, handing them a dollar
each, "I want information, and am willing to pay for
it."</p>

<p>It was pitiful to see their look of astonishment.
The work actually dropped from their hands as they
grasped the silver. Two or three tested theirs by biting,
and then said, apologetically: "Sometimes they
gives us bad money, an' we have to be keerful."</p>

<p>Another asked: "Ye'r not playin' a trick on us, for
if the bosses find us complainin' it makes it harder for
us?"</p>

<p>"We only want to see if the paper tells the truth.
We find the description of the conditions so far correct;
please tell us how many hours you work, and
how much you get?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss, if we work from four in the mornin'
till eight at night, we can earn fifty, sometimes seventy-five
cents; seventy-five generally, unless sumthin'
happens, and yer can count the hours for yersel'."</p>

<p>"Sixteen hours, day after day, and in such a place
as this," said Mabel, shuddering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond looked around the room, noted the
low, slanting ceiling, the begrimed walls, and panes
of the gable window, the only source of light; at the
uncombed hair and dirty faces of the women, and then
at her fair, refined, and well-dressed daughter, and felt
as if the spirit of George Fox indeed animated her, but
Mabel went on questioning:</p>

<p>"Have you families?" she asked.</p>

<p>"All but Sarah there, an' she has her ole mother."</p>

<!-- page 160 -->

<p>"Anyone to help you support them?"</p>

<p>"Jane an' Peggy have husbands who help some."
said the one who acted as spokesman, "an' Mag's boy
is big enough to turn a penny, an' so is Jules, an' my
Sally gives me a lift now an' then;" but the blush on
her face told how it was that Sally lived. Mrs. Raymond
understood, Mabel did not.</p>

<p>"Where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>The woman opened a closet, in which was rolled up
a dirty mattress and a few rags. "We shove the
machines aside when the others have gone, spread that
on the floor, an' Mag, Jule, an' I sleep on't."</p>

<p>"And your children?"</p>

<p>"My two stay with Sally, an' Mag an' Jane have
places for theirn."</p>

<p>"What do you eat?"</p>

<p>"Here's soup, an' here's bread," she said, taking
both from a corner of the closet not filled by the
mattress.</p>

<p>"Can I look out of your window?"</p>

<p>They made way for her to pass. Roofs, chimney
stacks, clouds of smoke, but not a green nor a bright
thing to be seen. "Laws, Miss, it don't matter, we
don't get the time to look out'n winders," was the
comment when Mabel spoke of this.</p>

<p>"And so the paper tells about us; I'd like to read
it," said the one called Sarah.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed the others in chorus.</p>

<p>"Yes, girls, I can read. I had good times once; I
was a happy child and went to school, but father died,
and mother had to work so hard; she can't work any
more now, and I've been pushed down, down, till, if it

<!-- page 161 -->

wasn't for mother, I wouldn't try to live," and dropping
her face upon her hands she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>Four of the women looked up at Mabel as if to say:
"Now see what you've done;" while the fifth yelled:</p>

<p>"None of that, you'll spile that cloak," at the same
time deftly taking the garment from her.</p>

<p>"Do come away," said M. Costin, noticing Mabel's
pallor. She negatived him with a look, and taking a
slip of paper from her pocket she handed it to the sobbing
woman, saying:</p>

<p>"Here it is, I should like to hear you read it."</p>

<p>Sarah hushed her sobs, took the paper, glanced it
over, and then read it to her companions. The writer,
in an official report to the Legislature, deposed as follows:*</p>

<p class="small">[*A genuine extract, as are all those credited.]</p>

<p>"During one of my visits to a tenement-house in
Hester Street I inadvertently entered a room on the
attic floor and found myself in the midst of a number
of cloak-makers. The room was possibly ten feet
square&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If this is really the place, he has made that part
worse than it is; this room is about twelve feet each
way," said M. Costin. "I beg your pardon for the interruption,"
he continued, "please go on."</p>

<p>"The ceiling was low and slanting, and its only
light was the begrimed panes of a gable-window
opening out upon the roof. In these cramped quarters
were six women and four sewing-machines," resumed
Sarah.</p>

<p>"That's us," said one.</p>

<p>"Hush, there's hundreds sich," said another.</p>

<!-- page 162 -->

<p>"Piled upon the floor," continued the reader, "were
stacks of cloaks ready to be put together. The air was
stifling to one not accustomed to a temperature well up
into the nineties, and odoriferous with sewer-gases.
The women were scantily clad, their hair unkempt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Much time to comb hair, we have," interrupted the
one whose head looked the worst.</p>

<p>"And their pale faces as they bent over their work
formed a picture of physical suffering such as I had
never seen before, and hope never to be compelled to
look upon again. They were working as if driven by
an unseen power, and when I learned that they were
able to earn but fifty cents by working sixteen hours a
day, perhaps more, I needed no further investigation
to convince me that the unseen power was the necessity
for bread for their own and their children's
mouths."</p>

<p>Sarah read on, but when she came to the following,
the others said: "No, he don't mean us, there's no
sich room here."</p>

<p>"Inquiry elicited the fact that the strong smell of
sewer-gas came from a sink in an adjoining apartment.
Curiosity led me to venture into this inside room. It
was without light or ventilation save that which came
through the door of the front room, and it was only
after standing several minutes that I could distinguish
the black lines of the walls, and the sink from which
rose clouds of deadly gas. Upon the floor was spread
a mattress, which in appearance partook of the filth of
the whole building, from the cellar up; and it was on
such a bed, and in such quarters that three cloak
makers, tired and worn with a long day's work, and

<!-- page 163 -->

with a scanty, if any, supper, threw themselves down to
sleep and wait the coming day's awful toil for bread."</p>

<p>While Sarah was reading, Mrs. Raymond pencilled a
note which she managed before she left to place in the
girl's hands without the others seeing her. "She and
her mother can be helped, the others are too ignorant."
she remarked, as they descended the stairs.</p>

<p>"If you attempt to save all who are savable, you
will have your hands full," replied M. Costin.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," remarked Mabel, "for the
writer of that article says that hundreds of such are
massed in a few squares about the east end of this
street, and there certainly is not less than one in six
who knows enough to be helped if they could get the
help."</p>

<p>"What then can be done?" said Mrs. Raymond, in
a despairing tone.</p>

<p>"That is what we must find out, mother," replied
Mabel; "but I have stood all that I can now. There are
other days, and I shall continue to investigate, but now
I must rest," so the driver was told to take them home.</p>

<p>Upon reaching it, the first thing done was to take
a bath all around; afterward a short rest, then dinner.
After dinner Mabel went to the organ and played and
sang the following lines, which she called</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Soul Murder.</span></p>

<div class="small">

<p>"In the garrets and the cellars,<br/>

In the close and noisome places,<br/>

Where the breeze is never blowing,<br/>

Where the sunlight cannot enter,<br/>

From the sunrise to the sunset,<br/>

<!-- page 164 -->

From the sunset till the midnight,<br/>

Sit the weary woeful women,<br/>

Working treadles, working bobbins,<br/>

Working many kinds of needles,<br/>

In their dull and ceaseless toiling,<br/>

Victims of a competition<br/>

That is cruel, bitter, ruthless.</p>

<p>"Full of hurry, full of worry,<br/>

With the children grouped around them,<br/>

Little hands stretched upward vainly,<br/>

Little mouths so vainly pleading,<br/>

They must work all else forgetting,<br/>

Swiftly plying weary fingers,<br/>

From the sunrise to the sunset,<br/>

From the sunset till the midnight,<br/>

With an anxious fear upon them,<br/>

Whether, when the work is finished,<br/>

They will get the meagre pittance.</p>

<p>"None need wonder if, despairing,<br/>

They should lose their hold on heaven,<br/>

Saying: 'Why should I be living?<br/>

What is life that I should choose it?<br/>

Only endless toil and sorrow,<br/>

Joyless, rayless, helpless, hopeless.'<br/>

Yet they labor, worn and woeful,<br/>

From the sunrise to the sunset,<br/>

From the sunset to the midnight,<br/>

Getting for their ceaseless striving<br/>

Just enough to keep them toiling,<br/>

Only that, and naught beyond it."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>"Where did you get that?" asked M. Costin.</p>

<p>She picked up a slip of paper and handed it to
him.</p>

<p>"Cut from a newspaper," he said; "but why do you
call it 'Soul Murder,' it is not so headed?"</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<p>"No, but mark the lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'None need wonder if, despairing,<br/>

They should lose their hold on heaven.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is not the soul worse than murdered, if they must
live such toiling lives here,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'From the sunrise to the sunset,<br/>

From the sunset to the midnight,'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and then lose heaven also because in their weariness
and woe they lose faith in the God they are taught to
look to, in the Christ they are told to believe in?"</p>

<p>"Miss Mabel, can you believe it&mdash;believe that those
poor creatures will be shut from heaven, provided
there is one, because of their doubt under such horrible
conditions? But if there is no heaven, no future life,
the sooner they and theirs die the better."</p>

<p>"They say, Monsieur, that there is a God who rules
all things, and if so, He rules <i>here</i> as well as there; and
if after coming into this life <i>innocent</i> of all wrong,
they must be subjected to such a life of misery here,
what reason have we to believe He will do any
better by them there?"</p>

<p>"I should like to have you ask every minister in this
city that question, Miss Mabel."</p>

<p>"And I should like to ask them how they can be
content to live in affluence while so many are forced
to endure conditions unfit for a decent dog."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can tell you that. It is because they believe
that God will take care of the others and make it all
up to them in another life. 'The poor of this world,

<!-- page 166 -->

rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom,' that is what
they teach, and that is what their acts show that they
believe."</p>

<p>"Well, I have about concluded that such belief in
God is a curse, and the sooner we discard from our
creed the idea that any God will do anything for us,
the sooner we shall be able to do for ourselves and each
other."</p>

<p>"And that is just what I believe, Miss Mabel."</p>

<p>"Are you ready for the insane asylum, sister mine?"
asked Walter, walking into the room with a stately
tread so unlike his usual self that they all laughed,
and his mother said:</p>

<p>"Why, have you been promoted to the office of insane
superintendent?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but I may become an inmate of such
institution if they put my sister there, and they say
she is crazy."</p>

<p>"Who says so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the <i>&eacute;lite</i>, those who belong to our set. They
were expecting a grand time on the birthday of Judge
Raymond's only daughter, and instead of meeting the
laudable expectation of friends she has been gallivanting
around tenement-houses, and among sewing-women."</p>

<p>Mabel looked up with a defiant air and said: "If
Judge Raymond's daughter cannot choose her own
way of spending her time, then she is a slave."</p>

<p>"As the most of us are, puss; but then they only
pity you. They say it is the old Quaker blood you have
inherited&mdash;that cranky traits reappear from generation
to generation&mdash;that your mother has managed to keep

<!-- page 167 -->

comparatively free, though she's a little queer, but that
you have got it bad."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Mabel, with more of mirth in her
tone than was usual to her, "society will discard you if
you sustain your cranky daughter."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" replied Mrs. Raymond, in the
same tone, while Walter sang:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Ye gay and thoughtless creatures,<br/>

A little from your store<br/>

Would give those weary women<br/>

A chance to rest some more;"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and then: "What's on the carpet for this evening,
Meb?"</p>

<p>"A good time with some friends, but you are not
wanted, sir."</p>

<p>"Which is it, then, that your highness favors?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I am going to be aristocratic and have a
set of friends all to myself."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go to the theatre. <i>Au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">MABEL'S FRIENDS.</p>

</div>

<p>EVENING came, and with it came ten
girls, besides Sarah from the tenement
house. Sarah came in answer to the note
Mrs. Raymond slipped into her hand,
when our party were there in the morning.
She came late.</p>

<p>"It was almost impossible for me to come at all, but
I felt that I must;" and her look was so appealing, it
touched Mrs. Raymond deeply. It seemed to say:
"You have raised my hopes, don't disappoint me."</p>

<p>"I have sent for you," she said, in reply to this unspoken
appeal, "to see if I cannot make things better
for you. I have a small empty room into which I will
have a couple of cots put, one for yourself and one for
your mother, and you will stay with us till we can decide
what is best to be done. No thanks, I am glad to
do this; now come with me to the bath-room.</p>

<p>"My daughter has a few girls with her to-night,
like yourself, and as I know you have had no time to
make yourself presentable, you will here find comb and
brush, and as you are about my size I have selected
for you a full suit of plain clothing; I want to exchange
them for yours. I want to keep yours to show
people how our workers are forced to dress. What is

<!-- page 169 -->

your full name, I shall want to introduce you to Mabel's
company?"</p>

<p>"Wilson," was the reply, in tones scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Wilson, come to me when you are
ready," and she turned to go, but had not gone three
steps before she heard a fall. Sarah had fainted.</p>

<p>"How thoughtless I am," she said to herself, as she
set herself to work to restore the girl to consciousness;
"I should have given her food the first thing, poor
girl."</p>

<p>When Sarah revived, Mrs. Raymond said: "I have
made a mistake; you are in no condition to meet company
to-night. I will give you a cup of tea and some
food, and something for your mother, and then you go
directly home, and have everything ready, and I will
send for you both to-morrow; then you can have your
bath and time to rest."</p>

<p>So Sarah was taken to the kitchen and her wants
supplied; a better meal was provided than she had
eaten for many a day, and laden with food she hurried
home with renewed strength and a light heart.</p>

<p>In the meantime a nice repast had been prepared
for those who had been invited, while Mabel sat at the
table, passed the tea, and did all that she could to make
her guests feel at their ease, unaware, the while, that
her laughter-loving brother was watching her from a
hidden corner from which he could not retreat without
discovery till she, with her friends, should leave the
room, and he was not sorry to hear her say:</p>

<p>"Now, girls, come to my room and we will have a
good talk."</p>

<p>These girls Mabel had come in contact with in various

<!-- page 170 -->

ways during the last three or four years. They
had to earn their own living; but as nurse-girls, dining-room-girls,
seamstresses, etc., they were accustomed to
seeing good things, so the rich carpets and furniture
did not surprise them in the least; and the fact that
they were not just upon the same level socially was
forgotten in the presence of "Miss Mabel," as she
treated them all as friends.</p>

<p>"Now, girls," she said, "for I want you to feel that
we are all girls together, I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>She then commenced with the time when she overheard
her mother saying, "Why should not the conditions
which surround the mother affect the child
growing beneath her heart?" related her talk with her
mother afterward, dwelling particularly upon the idea
that if her mother being happy had made her good,
was it because Tommy Gove's mother had bad conditions
around her that made him so naughty.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me a logical conclusion," she said,
"and I wondered why everybody could not have good
things. Mother had always taught me that there was
a reason, a cause for everything, so there must be for
this, and I felt that I must find out what it was, and
when I found it out, would work to change, to make
things better. It was a big plan for a small girl to
make, but from that time till now I have never given
it up.</p>

<p>"To-day I am eighteen years old, and it is time I
began to work as well as to think; but what can I do?
I feel so small compared with this great world, and
with the greatness of the work I have chosen, and can
do so little alone, so I want girls like myself to study

<!-- page 171 -->

this question with me. It would be of no use for me
to look for them among the daughters of the rich, for
their parents would not be willing even if they were;
so I have invited you here because I want your help,
your sympathy, your love.</p>

<p>"I have known something of you in the past, I have
studied your capabilities, have seen that you meant to
be good, and I feel that with the opportunity you can
each become a blessing to the world, to yourselves, and
to me; and now, if you will accept me as a sister, we
will study this question together."</p>

<p>Would they&mdash;they the toilers&mdash;would they accept the
educated and refined daughter of Judge Raymond as
their sister? The idea almost took away their breath.
Seeing their embarrassment, Mabel took a playful way
to set them at their ease. She said:</p>

<p>"When I was a little girl we used to play 'Old Simon,'
and when the leader said, 'Simon says, Thumbs
up,' all who failed to raise the thumb had to pay a forfeit;
we will change it to hands up, and now all of you
who want me and each other as sisters, will please raise
the right hand," and quickly raising her own she called
out, "Simon says, Hands up."</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation, and then every
right hand was raised.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, "I am rich. I who never had a
sister, my papa and mamma never gave me one, I now
have ten, for if I am your sister you are mine, and I
must give my new sisters something to make them remember
my birthday and theirs. It is your birthday
as sisters, you know," and she distributed to each an
appropriate gift, saying: "I hope when my next birthday

<!-- page 172 -->

comes, to be able to present each of you with a
locket containing my likeness, and I shall want yours
in a group to frame and hang in my room."</p>

<p>When the presents were sufficiently admired Mabel
asked if any of them had ever been inside of one of
the poorer class of tenement-houses, or among those
women who sewed for the shops. They all seemed to
know something of both, but upon further questioning
she found that what they had come in contact with
was several grades above the house in Hester Street.
After listening to their stories, she said:</p>

<p>"I will now tell you what I have seen to-day, first
asking you, Mary Green, to read aloud this slip that I
cut from a newspaper."</p>

<p>Mary read it slowly, carefully, giving full weight to
each sentence: "No," she said, "I have never seen
anything like that; it does not seem as if it could be
true."</p>

<p>"It is all true, girls; for I found a room so like the
one there described that for a time we thought it was
the same; but as the inner room with the sink was
lacking we decided it was not, and working there in
that dreadful place we found a girl as intelligent as
yourselves, one who had once been in good circumstances;
but her father died, and one misfortune after
another had pulled herself and mother down till the
mother can no longer work, and the daughter works
sixteen hours out of twenty-four to get bread for both."</p>

<p>"Did you learn her name?" asked Nellie Stone.</p>

<p>"They called her Sarah. I did not hear her other
name."</p>

<p>"The reason I ask, Miss Mabel, is, mother has a sister

<!-- page 173 -->

that she has lost track of. Uncle died, and we do
not know where she and her little girl went. Cousin's
name was Sarah; wouldn't it be strange if this girl and
her mother were my aunt and cousin; mother would
be so glad to find her sister."</p>

<p>"It is not impossible. Mother asked her to come
here to-night. If you will excuse me I will go and see
if she has come."</p>

<p>Presently Mabel returned and said: "Sarah has just
gone to the bath-room with mother, and when she has
bathed and had a cup of tea mother will bring her up.
What was the name of the man your aunt married,
Miss Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Wilson," replied Nellie, looking a little embarrassed
at Mabel's calling her Miss. Mabel noticed
this and added: "You are my sister now, and if you
call me Miss, I must you."</p>

<p>In about fifteen minutes Mrs. Raymond came up
and told them of Sarah's fainting: "She is now with
Maggie, who will give her something to eat, and then
John will take her home, for she is in no condition to
see anyone to-night," she said.</p>

<p>Mabel was upon the point of asking her mother if
she had learned what Sarah's other name was, but did
not; something seemed to hold her back, as she afterward
said: "But I am glad I did not, as it would have
so excited Nellie as to have spoiled her pleasure for
the evening."</p>

<p>"Now girls," she said, when her mother left, "we
have had enough of the serious for one night; we
have stated our object and we are going to learn all
about it, and as fast as we can, and I want you all to

<!-- page 174 -->

come again this night two weeks, but we will make
merry the rest of this evening."</p>

<p>She then sang a lively and familiar song, asking the
others to join, all who could. Several took part, and
ere they had sung it through they had forgotten their
strange position and let out their voices till they made
the walls ring. Then various games were introduced,
and the minutes sped till only Mabel's watchful eye
noted that it was time for her guests to go. Then
came the good-bys, she claiming a kiss from each, and
when the girls reached the street they found a conveyance
ready to take each to her own home.</p>

<p>"Well, mamma," she said, when all had gone, "I
have made a beginning; but oh, the terrible conditions
that must be changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; but thy work will be as the sowing of
the seed for a wonderful harvest."</p>

<p>"If the soil was only prepared for the seed,
mamma."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond with a far-away look upon her face
presently said: "There is as much soil ready as the
present workers can cultivate. When the workers are
ready the soil will be."</p>

<p>"I hope so; where is papa?"</p>

<p>"In the library, dear."</p>

<p>She arose from her seat at her mother's knee, and
going to the library she knelt at her father's feet and
laid her head on his knee. "Papa, I am your own little
girl yet," she said.</p>

<p>"And not the stately Miss Raymond who henceforth
belongs to herself," he said, as he raised her
from his feet and seated her where her head had lain,

<!-- page 175 -->

giving her at the same time a kiss, and asked, "What
has my little girl been doing to-day?"</p>

<p>She told him how she had spent the day, and something
of what she had seen.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I fear my little girl has undertaken
a Quixotic work. If wise men have not been
able to regulate these things, how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wise women will," she interrupted, placing her
hand upon his lips. "Now don't preach, papa; I
know I am not wise, but I hope to become so, and
mamma approves."</p>

<p>"Well, make your experiments; no great harm will
be done. I had rather you would do that than be a
society belle."</p>

<p>"Thank you for that, papa, and good-night, I can
sleep now."</p>

<p>She and her mother had planned the day's work, but
she wanted to feel that her father did not entirely disapprove,
even if he did not enter into the spirit of
what she wished to do as her mother did.</p>

<p>The next day after Sarah and her mother had been
comfortably established in their room, Mabel, having
learned from her mother that their name was Wilson,
asked Mrs. Wilson if she had any brothers or sisters
living.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Miss; I had a sister Sarah, who
married a man by the name of Stone; my Sarah is
named for her, but I have not heard from her for
years."</p>

<p>Becoming satisfied that Nellie and Sarah were cousins,
she sent a note to Nellie, stating the facts, and asking
her or her mother to call, and within two hours they

<!-- page 176 -->

both came. Mrs. Wilson and Sarah had been prepared
for the interview, but stranger eyes looked not upon the
meeting of the long separated sisters. Within a week
they were under the same roof, and Sarah had, through
Mrs. Raymond's influence, secured a situation in which
she received fair wages, and thus could do her part in
supporting her mother and making her feel comfortably
independent in her sister's home.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," said Mabel, "this is worth a dozen
birthday parties; it makes me very happy to think
we have been the means of bringing those sisters together,
and Sarah and Nellie are so happy too."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Spirit moved me to write that note, and
good has come of it," replied Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Nellie is not as pretty as some of the others," remarked
Walter, demurely.</p>

<p>"How happens it that you know? I supposed you
were away," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Suppositions don't always come true, Miss Mabel."</p>

<p>"Nor are young men always truthful," she retorted.</p>

<p>"Sorry, sis, that Monsieur Costin and Mister Gray
have taught you that lesson; is your heart broken?"</p>

<p>"Walter, have done with your nonsense, and tell us
how it was that you saw Mabel's company," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Well, mother mine, I went into the room where
their dainty repast was laid, to get a book I had left
there, and as Meb was so particular, so exclusive, and
as I am a regular descendant of grandmother Eve my
curiosity got the better of me, and I hid where I could
see and not be seen; so while they were daintily sipping
their tea I had a fair chance to judge."</p>

<!-- page 177 -->

<p>"Do you think that a gentlemanly act, my son?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never thought of that; I only thought that
I should want a wife some day, and that I would be as
likely to find a good one among that group as elsewhere.
Say, mother, may I go with you the next time you and
Meb go out as an investigating committee?"</p>

<p>"Do you really want to go, Walter?"</p>

<p>"I really do; I was reading an appeal from some
Reverend only this morning. The article was headed,
'Tenement-house Morality,' in which the writer tries
to show, and he does it too, how next to impossible it
is for anyone to be good in the midst of such surroundings,
and I thought I should like to see for myself
what the conditions really are."</p>

<p>"You can go, if Mabel don't object."</p>

<p>"Of course, mother, he can go with us; in what
paper was the article published, Walter?"</p>

<p>"I found it in a paper wrapped around a bundle,
and never stopped to look to see what it was, but I cut
it out for your benefit, and here it is. The name of
the Reverend is J. O. S. Huntington, perhaps you may
have heard of him."</p>

<p>"I have," said M. Costin, who had just come in,
"he is a Catholic, and really a self-denying, devoted
man."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw he was a Catholic, for in the first
sentence here he speaks of a lad coming back to him
after confession."</p>

<p>"And he lives right in among those he is trying
to save", said Mabel, "for he says, 'If anyone is disposed
to be skeptical let him investigate for himself.
Let him spend days and nights here; let him live,

<!-- page 178 -->

as I have done, in a tenement block; let him visit
people at all hours; let him, above all, spend a public
holiday here; let him see the carnival of sin on a
Fourth of July or a New-Year's night. I do not say
that he will even then understand the conditions of
tenement-house existence; but I know that his incredulity
will give place to a sad realization of the
horrors of a state of things where manhood is brutalized,
womanhood dishonored, and childhood poisoned
at its very source.' "</p>

<p>For some seconds after the reading of this paragraph
no word was spoken, then Walter walked out
repeating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Jesus, my all, to heaven has gone,<br/>

He whom I fixed my hopes upon;<br/>

I wish he'd come and clean away<br/>

Those hell-holes where the poor must stay&mdash;<br/>

Would take of the Church's extra gold<br/>

To make for them a better sheepfold."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">THE POOR OF THIS WORLD.</p>

</div>

<p>" 'THE poor of this world, rich in faith,' and
rich indeed they must be to have it last
through a life like this," said Walter, as
he looked about him.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the first expedition,
and this time Walter accompanied them in
the place of M. Costin. They had been pretty well
through one tenement-house of a block, and found
things fully as bad as the Reverend J. O. S. Huntington
had described. Walter took from his pocket and
read a slip of paper he had asked Mabel to let him
take on entering the building&mdash;the one he had given
her a few days before:</p>

<p>" 'Take one block of a tenement-house district. It
will measure 700 by 200 feet. On all sides there are
rows of houses (tenements) four or five stories high.
Behind one-third of the houses are rear houses with
smaller rooms, darker and dirtier passages, backed often
by another rear house, a brewery, a stable, or a factory.'</p>

<p>"Well, this place, so far, is wonderfully like this
description," he said, and then read on:</p>

<p>" 'Altogether there are 1,736 rooms&mdash;' heavens!
that gives but a fraction over eight by ten feet to the

<!-- page 180 -->

room, counting nothing for halls, stairways, nor anything
else," he exclaimed, after a moment's computation;
"it cannot be."</p>

<p>"Please read on," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>" 'In these rooms live 2,076 souls&mdash;' more than two
thousand souls and less than four acres of ground!"
was the next comment after another computation.</p>

<p>"I thought you had read that article once," said
Mabel.</p>

<p>"And so I had, but I am verifying the problem
now: 'Many of these rooms are hardly more than
closets, and dark closets at that&mdash;' ah, that explains the
number of rooms; an eight by ten would divide into
two eight by five&mdash;' "</p>

<p>"You have forgotten one thing, Walter," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Those houses are four and five stories high, so you
must multiply the ground space by, say three and a
half, as the inner row of houses are probably not as
high as the others."</p>

<p>"Sure enough! how stupid."</p>

<p>"And then Mr. Huntington says one-fifth of those
rooms are in basements below the level of the streets,"
added Mabel.</p>

<p>"Well, with all the addition of space it is bad
enough." Reads again:</p>

<p>" 'Almost all the bedrooms measure only seven feet
by nine, and have but one door and one window. The
door leads into the apartment that serves as kitchen,
parlor, sitting-room, laundry, and workshop, and the
window opens on a dark stairway, up which the moisture

<!-- page 181 -->

from the cellar, and the sewer-gas from the drains
are continually rising; and nearly half of even the
outer rooms open into courts only twenty feet wide, in
which there are usually several wooden privies.'</p>

<p>"Well, so far there is nothing worse described here
than we have found; I wonder how much the money
expended on churches, cathedrals, and the like in this
city would do toward removing all this?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Walter, but I do not think that individual
effort or charitable movements can ever cure
these evils. The cause of such results must be found
and removed," said Mrs. Raymond. Mabel the while
was watching an opposite window.</p>

<p>"See," she said presently, "there is a little girl at
that window who has a clean face; we must find the
way to that room."</p>

<p>"Somebody who has fallen among thieves," said
Walter, "and we must be the Samaritans."</p>

<p>After going some distance round they found the stairway
that led to the room they wished to reach. "A
dark stairway sure enough," was the comment, but they
finally reached the door of the room from the window
of which the little girl had looked. They rapped, and
heard a woman's voice say:</p>

<p>"Rock the baby, Lillie, while mamma goes to the
door." Presently the door was opened by a cleanly,
but poorly dressed woman, whose countenance expressed
surprise when she saw who was there.</p>

<p>"Madam," said Mrs. Raymond, "we are looking
into the condition of tenement-houses, and seeing your
little girl at the window, we felt certain from her
appearance that her mother had not always lived in

<!-- page 182 -->

such a place as this, and so found our way to your
room."</p>

<p>"Will you come in," she said, and as they complied
she handed the two ladies each a chair, and brought
Walter a stool; they in the meantime were noting the
cleanliness of the room in spite of the miserable surroundings.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, as soon as they were seated, "you
are right; I have not always lived in a place like this,
and but for my children I should wish to die. I feel
sometimes as though I would go and take them with
me."</p>

<p>She said this in so quiet and sad a tone that it
brought tears to Mabel's eyes. "It would be better for
the children to die now while they are innocent, but I
have not quite the heart to do it," she continued.</p>

<p>"You have seen better times," said Mrs. Raymond,
forgetting that she had already said the same thing.
She wanted to say something, and could not find it in
her heart to utter reproach for what to many would
have seemed great wickedness.</p>

<p>The woman looked at her in surprise. "Why do you
not reproach me for my wickedness; are you not a
Christian?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not reproach you because I should feel as you
do, did I have to live here," she replied, ignoring the
Christian part of the question.</p>

<p>At this manifestation of sympathy the enforced
calm that had so far sustained the woman was broken
up, and she wept like a child.</p>

<p>"My husband does the best he can," she said, as soon
as she could speak; "but he is not strong, and has work

<!-- page 183 -->

only part of the time, even when he is able to work,
and the terrible conditions here are enough to drive a
man wild; they cannot endure like women, you know,"
she added, looking up as if apologizing for even having
suspected that he could be tempted to do like those
about him.</p>

<p>She was interrupted by oaths and curses that came
from the next room. Mabel shuddered, and Mrs. Raymond
involuntarily put her hands to her ears, while
Walter looked as though he would like to take them
both and fly through the window to get away.</p>

<p>"That is a usual thing," said the woman, "and to
think of my little Lillie growing up amid such sounds!
They tell us there is a God, but I begin to doubt it."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Walter, again producing the slip
of paper, "if the priest who wrote this should, in a
few hours, be summoned to the dying bed of those who
are now drinking, swearing, and fighting, he would
confess them and administer the sacrament, and thus
give them and their wretched companions the idea that
they are to be saved in heaven."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that very fact encourages them in sin,"
said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"And gives the priest such power," added Walter.</p>

<p>"Don't talk of sin," said Mabel; "if people are
forced to go where the smallpox prevails and they
take it and become scarred and hideous, it is their misfortune,
not their crime, and none but a monster would
talk of either punishing or forgiving them, and conditions
like these are far worse."</p>

<p>"And yet this priest talks of the God of the poor;
hear him: 'And so be called to answer to the God of

<!-- page 184 -->

the poor when he shall arise to shake terribly the
earth;' " and then rising to his feet, as though he could
not say it strong enough if he continued so sit, Walter
stretched out his arm, and with a sneer upon his lip,
asked:</p>

<p>"Will the shaking do any good? A God, and of the
poor, who will sit quietly and see them so wronged,
and then, after the mischief is done, gets mad and
goes to shaking things generally is&mdash;well, a poor stick
for the poor to trust in&mdash;no, that is not strong enough&mdash;deserves
hell himself, and I should like to help pour
in the brimstone. Come, mother, Meb, if you stay
here longer, you must stay alone, for I can't stand it."
and throwing a five-dollar bill into the woman's lap,
he started down the stairway. Mrs. Raymond gave
the woman her address, and asked her to have her husband
call, and then she and Mabel followed.</p>

<p>When they reached the street, Walter shook himself
like a dog that has just come out of the water. "Ugh!
I have had enough of this," he said.</p>

<p>"To think of allowing children to grow up in such
places, and then expect them to be good," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"And then send them to prison if they are not,"
retorted Walter; "really I wonder how it is that the
rich are safe in their beds!"</p>

<p>The slip of paper was again resorted to, but he was
too excited to read, so he handed it to Mabel, and as
they rode slowly homeward she read:</p>

<p>" 'Side by side with those poor outcasts of humanity
are hard-working men and women who are leading
lives of heroic purity; it is in their name I plead.
They are fighting at fearful odds to keep themselves

<!-- page 185 -->

and their children from the filth and pollution all about
them."</p>

<p>"I must look into this," said Mabel, "I must learn
if those who are thus struggling were any of them born
under such conditions."</p>

<p>"You must find someone else to go with you then.
I have had enough of it, am willing to take the Reverend
gentleman's statements for the rest."</p>

<p>"But he says nothing on this point, Walter."</p>

<p>"Never thought of it, I presume; it takes you women
to do that."</p>

<p>As before, when they reached home, they each took
a bath, while the clothing they had worn was hung out
to air.</p>

<p>After dinner Walter again had recourse to the slip
of paper. It seemed to fascinate him. "Here is one
thing we did not see, Meb," and he read:</p>

<p>" 'And death, from its frequency and the coarseness
that surrounds it, loses, if not all its terrors, at least
its dignity&mdash;' ha, ha, ha, the <i>dignity</i> of death."</p>

<p>"Walter, Walter!" exclaimed his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I know death is a solemn thing, but
the dignity part I had never heard of before; a dignified
death, such will be the heading of death accounts
after this. But I must finish this paragraph: 'is regarded
as one of the disagreeable accidents of life,
hardly worthy of even idle curiosity. <i>The corpse lies
for two days in the room where the family eats, works,
and often sleeps</i>.' "</p>

<p>"Oh, Walter, that is horrible," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"What else can they do with it, mother?" asked
Mabel.</p>

<!-- page 186 -->

<p>"True enough, what can they!" and the woman
covered her face with her hands, and soon after left
the room.</p>

<p>"I wish you had noticed what paper it was from
which you cut that slip, Walter."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, Meb. It was the <i>Sun</i>, the <i>World</i>,
or some other prominent city paper, as I noticed at the
time, but I have forgotten which. But for your hobby
I should not have paid any attention, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I am glad you cut out the article."</p>

<p>"And I wish I hadn't; if it would do any good to
look into these things I wouldn't care, but we can't
change things, and where's the use of troubling ourselves
about what we can't help, Meb?"</p>

<p>"It would trouble me not to try," was her reply, as
Walter took his hat and left the house. She then took
up the slip of paper and read again:</p>

<p>" 'If there is a God in heaven, and if righteousness
is the habitation of His throne, it is not His will that
one of these little ones should perish.' Whose will
then is it," she thought, "for they are surely perishing.
'<i>If</i> there is a God'&mdash;<i>if</i>, here we have the supposition of
a personality, a habitation and a throne; it cannot be;
there is no such personality. There are only eternal
laws, principles, which we must discover and apply;
and when applied all such conditions will vanish. It
must be so;" and she, too, dropped her face in her hands
and thought, thought till her tired brain demanded
rest, but not for a moment did she yield her purpose.</p>

<p>Not so her mother. Mrs. Raymond had her first
real struggle as to whether she should continue to sustain
Mabel, or try to dissuade her from the task she

<!-- page 187 -->

had undertaken. Why should her bright young life
be sacrificed to try to accomplish that for which so
many had toiled and failed. The struggle was still going
on when Mabel rapped at her door.</p>

<p>"Mamma, may I come in? I want to talk with
you," she said.</p>

<p>"Come, my child; but I myself need some one to
counsel me."</p>

<p>"Let us counsel together, then," was the response.</p>

<p>She took her accustomed seat on a stool at her mother's
feet and waited; but as her mother said nothing
she asked:</p>

<p>"What have been the motives prompting reformers
in the past?"</p>

<p>"The motives?" repeated Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, what reasons have been given to induce
people to be good?"</p>

<p>"Various reasons," she replied, after a moment's
thought; "but the principal one, that which has been
urged as paramount to all others, has been that God
commands us to be good."</p>

<p>"In other words, God's will has been the measure of
right and wrong; if God so wills we may destroy the
nations, as in the days when the Israelites destroyed
the Canaanites, or if He wills that we let them alone,
then that is right; either murder or kindness, just as
God wills."</p>

<p>"That seems about the way, Mabel. He says, or we
are told He says, 'If there be evil in a city, I, the Lord,
have done it."</p>

<p>"And no one has set aside this idea of obedience as
the law of right?"</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"No, child; obedience, resignation, content with the
station in life to which God has assigned us, are
counted the highest virtues."</p>

<p>"Then I shall never reach the highest standard of
virtue, mother, for I never can, I never will be resigned
to such a state of things. If it pleases God to
have it so, it does not, never will please me. If there
is such a God, such a heaven as they talk of, I do not
wonder there has been war there."</p>

<p>"But, darling, what can we do about it? the task
seems hopeless."</p>

<p>"I shall do what I cannot help doing, mother, for
it will be the only happiness I can have, to oppose all
doing for God's sake and to work for humanity."</p>

<p>"Daughter, thou hast conquered; thy mother's heart
had failed her, but thou hast given her new courage."</p>

<p>"Mother, a system of society built upon such ideas
cannot help being wrong, and it seems to me that it
must be reconstructed, and in that case the more discontent
that can be created, the more dissatisfaction
with the present order of things, the sooner the new
order will come."</p>

<p>"France tried such revolution, Mabel, and with what
results?"</p>

<p>"I have not studied history enough to know if things
were made very much better; but France to-day does
not seem to be any worse off, to say the least, and as
to those miserable beings who must live as do those we
have seen to-day&mdash;well, if my little brother had lived
and had to be brought up in the midst of such surroundings,
I should rejoice in the fire that burned the
building and him in it."</p>

<!-- page 189 -->

<p>"But, Mabel, many children, yes, many thousands,
are born under such conditions, and they are as dear
to their mothers as ours are to us."</p>

<p>"Mother, would you bear a child under such conditions,
knowing what you do? I would not, I would
take my own life first."</p>

<p>"But you have no right to do that, child."</p>

<p>"I would take the right then, before I would be the
means of bequeathing such a heritage to another."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond said no more, and Mabel left the
room. A few minutes after Walter brought in the
<i>Irish World</i>, and pointed to an article in the editorial
column which read:</p>

<p>"Is our condition what that of a wisely governed
nation ought to be&mdash;every daily paper a <i>contented</i>
chronicle of destitution, crime, despair, and death?</p>

<p>"A young man, a baker, can get no work, is hungered
for four days, has no place to sleep, throws himself
over Harlem Bridge, strives against those who
come to rescue him, for permission to die, is brought
before a judge who reproaches him for not bearing up
manfully against the four days' hunger, and his four
nights' sleep out in the frost.</p>

<p>"Another young man huddles under a rail car for
a bed. Before he awakens the car wheels are run over
his body and he is carried off to die. But the newspapers
comfort us by saying he was a 'tramp,' and
when a 'tramp' is tramping for something to do, he is
a man no longer. The <i>Herald</i> says:</p>

<p>" 'Seven, or several suicides this morning, and if they
had looked around they would have found people worse
off than themselves.' That's a ghastly remedy."</p>

<!-- page 190 -->

<p>"Where did you get this?" Mrs. Raymond asked,
when she had read thus far.</p>

<p>"I bought it of a hungry-looking boy just now, one
of those tenement children, I presume." She laid it
aside, and picking it up he said:</p>

<p>"Here is a passage you have not read, mother, and
it makes me sick. I think I shall come to hate the
very name of God yet. After saying, 'Evils that a
hundred volumes wouldn't describe prevail everywhere;
the brain reels under the variety and vastness; a thousand
families set right by charity would be but a speck
of foam from the ocean of distress,' he goes on in this
strain:</p>

<p>" 'But God has not forsaken us. Boundless are the
resources He presents. <i>All</i> the lands of this Republic
are His lands, and all the people are <i>His children</i>.'
Nonsense; I wouldn't give much for a rich father
who takes no better care of his children&mdash;who lets some
have an abundance, and starves the others; how long
will people be stuffed with such an idea of God, and
continue to worship, all the same."</p>

<p>"Well, you and Mabel are alike in that, if in nothing
else; neither of you seem to have any fear of God
before your eyes," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"That, mother, is because we have both had the
same teacher, one who knows something; by the way,
the time is most here when M. Costin leaves us; how
we shall miss him." Then he went out singing:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p>"If man would cease to trust a God<br/>

And learn to trust himself,<br/>

We rather think that Jesus would<br/>

Be laid upon the shelf;<br/>

<!-- page 191 -->

No more we'd claim another's back<br/>

On which to lay our sins,<br/>

But wade right through to firmer ground,<br/>

E'en though we hurt our shins.</p>

<p>"The nipping weather, it is said,<br/>

Has shortened many a breath,<br/>

And empty stomachs, too, have caused<br/>

Or hastened some to death;<br/>

For when the biting frosts set in<br/>

'Tis needful that the blood<br/>

Be warmed by flannels, and be fed<br/>

By good and wholesome food.</p>

<p>"Then let us cease to trust in God<br/>

And learn to trust ourselves,<br/>

And wading through to firmer ground<br/>

Lay creeds upon the shelf."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Mabel, true to her purpose, went through several
tenement-houses to ascertain if any of the better class
of tenants were born and reared under such conditions.
This time George Gray went with her, and her mother
remained at home.</p>

<p>George took down, as far as was possible to obtain
them, the birthplace of the heads of families, whether
in the country, or in the better portions of this or
some other city. Of course many were from the old
countries&mdash;Ireland, France, Germany, and various
other places in Europe&mdash;and of these one could not
judge; but of American-born citizens, not one who
bore the marks of any reasonable degree of cleanliness
and sobriety had been reared amid such surroundings.</p>

<p>One poor woman, with a babe at the breast, and
two playing about the floor, said with tears in her
eyes: "My parents owned a little house in the suburbs,

<!-- page 192 -->

and we had a yard with flowers, and I was as
happy as any child could wish. I grew to be a woman
and commenced going out to service, where I met
John, and the first two years he had plenty of work
and all went well, but since then&mdash;" she could not go
on.</p>

<p>"Where are your parents now?" asked Mabel, after
giving her time to control her feelings.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are both dead, and I am not sorry; it
would break their hearts to see me and the children in
a place like this."</p>

<p>"And the little home?"</p>

<p>"There was little left after paying the debts;
father was sick a long time, and it had to be sold."</p>

<p>Mabel looked at the little ones and their mother.
The woman noted the look and said: "The darlings,
I could not weep to see them die, I could bear it better;
but John&mdash;" she paused and choked.</p>

<p>"Is getting discouraged," said George.</p>

<p>"Yes, and falling in with the ways here."</p>

<p>"And this is Christian civilization," said George as
they left the room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">LOVE.&mdash;DISAPPOINTMENT.&mdash;FRANCE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE time was at hand when M. Costin was
to leave for France. He had been the
children's teacher and companion over
seven years, and of course they were all
very much attached to him.</p>

<p>Mabel kept up her meeting for her young friends,
sisters, as she called them, and Sarah Wilson having
been added to the number made an apostolic dozen,
counting herself, as she laughingly said.</p>

<p>"But there were twelve apostles besides Jesus," said
Walter.</p>

<p>"Not after Judas hanged himself, and we will have
no Judas in ours," she retorted.</p>

<p>"But they chose another to fill Judas' place."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not obliged to copy after any <i>man</i>, and
I do not expect to be crucified."</p>

<p>"You maybe, notwithstanding; there are more kinds
of crucifixion than one," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"If I am, mother, I do not wish to be worshipped
because of it," she replied.</p>

<p>"The crucifixion that tears the heart and makes the
living death may be worse than the death of the body."
said M. Costin.</p>

<p>"Whose heart is being torn now?" asked Walter.</p>

<!-- page 194 -->

<p>"A great many hearts are being torn daily," said
Mrs. Raymond, fearing that Walter would say something
personal; but he was not so easily suppressed.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," he said; "I didn't know but Monsieur
was leaving some cruel maiden behind."</p>

<p>M. Costin turned so pale that even Walter noticed
it, and left the room. Mabel was busy, and so used to
her brother's chaffing that she paid no attention to it.</p>

<p>"Zounds!" he exclaimed, as soon as the door closed
behind M. Costin; but his mother caught his eye and
put her finger to her lips, so he said no more, but as
she involuntarily looked toward Mabel he comprehended
the situation.</p>

<p>Presently Mabel went out also, then he asked:
"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know, but I have long suspected."</p>

<p>"Do you think she does?"</p>

<p>"No, not in the least; but if I am not much mistaken
he will tell her before he leaves."</p>

<p>Walter thrust his hands into his pockets and walked
the floor for some minutes. He loved to tease Mabel
about the "fellows," as he called the young men of
their acquaintance, but the thought of anything serious
in that direction nearly took his breath away.</p>

<p>"Does father suspect?" he asked, at length.</p>

<p>"I do not think he does; if so, he has said nothing
to me."</p>

<p>"That is no proof; neither have you said anything
to him," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>"How long have you suspected this, mother?" he
continued, after another turn or two across the floor.</p>

<p>"Ever since I saw the cloud come over his face

<!-- page 195 -->

when George's return was mentioned, and on the night
of the party when she sang 'The Watcher' I caught
his eyes fixed upon her with a look that I think I
could not mistake."</p>

<p>"George, yes, he would think him a rival; by the
way, I wonder George don't fall in love with her;
she is sweet enough for anybody to love; if she wasn't
my sister I shouldn't wait long."</p>

<p>"And get sent about your business. She would
never fancy a man of your stamp," said his mother,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but M. Costin is good-looking, well
educated, and rich; I don't see what more she can
want."</p>

<p>"We will not discuss the matter any more now, I
hear Mabel coming," said Mrs. Raymond, and Walter
walked off whistling.</p>

<p>Two evenings after was Mabel's company night, and
as M. Costin was to leave before another gathering, she
planned for a sort of general entertainment in which
they all joined, her father included.</p>

<p>"I would invite some more young men and have
dancing," said Mabel, "only I know of none I dare
trust. Rich men's sons do not hold themselves bound
to treat poor girls with respect at all times and places,
and I must not subject them to the danger of being
annoyed by them."</p>

<p>"Rich men's sons would feel insulted to be invited
here to a gathering in which poor girls took part as
equals," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"But will take part in low-down dances, in low-down
places," said M. Costin, indignantly.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>"Such young men are not worthy to meet with my
girls," replied Mabel.</p>

<p>"Have none of your girls brothers?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Mary Green and Susie Hosmer have, but I do not
know them."</p>

<p>"Well, invite them to come with the girls; I think
we can manage two if they should prove to be boorish."</p>

<p>"No, that will not do; they are not used to as good
company as the girls are, and I would not make their
sisters ashamed."</p>

<p>"How is that, Mabel?" asked her father.</p>

<p>"Because girls employed in wealthy families see
more of refined society than their brothers do at their
work; besides, the girls have been coming here for
some time."</p>

<p>"And where will they find husbands, puss, if you
lift them out of their own sphere?"</p>

<p>"I shall try and lift them so high, father, that they
can live without husbands, unless they can get good
ones, and be useful and happy too."</p>

<p>"Mabel does not believe that marriage is the aim
and end of woman's existence," said Walter, in his
usually teasing tone.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not, sir."</p>

<p>"And you never intend to marry?" he continued.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry a man of your stamp, sir," was
her prompt and rather emphatic retort.</p>

<p>"No, you would want some one older, wiser."</p>

<p>"Walter! Walter!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; but I like to see Meb's eyes snap; I
want to make the most of her while I can, for some

<!-- page 197 -->

fellow will be carrying her off by and by, and then I
shall have to let her alone, my poor Salmagundi."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond ignored Walter's jokes by turning
the conversation back to the point whence it started,
and M. Costin quietly left the room. There was something
in Mrs. Raymond's tone as she said "Walter,
Walter," that made him think she had discovered his
secret, and his bosom was a tumult of conflicting emotions.
Walter noticed his leaving, and drawing his
own conclusions turned to Mabel with:</p>

<p>"Your marriage ideas have sent Monsieur Costin
from the room in despair."</p>

<p>She gave a low, rippling laugh, as though the thought
was simply ridiculous, while his mother said: "Walter,
I will send you from the room if you do not behave
better," giving him at the same time so appealing
a look that he really sobered down for fully ten
minutes.</p>

<p>His next move was about the dance. "I guess we
can fix it," he said; "there are four of us men, counting
father, and there is Jim the coachman; nothing coarse
about him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it is not best; if we have one of the servants
we must have them all; we can dispense with the
dancing," said Mabel, so decidedly, that nothing further
was said upon that subject, while the Judge said:</p>

<p>"What next, Walter?" in a tone that completely
subdued his exuberant spirits.</p>

<p>The night of the usual gathering for the girls came
and passed off pleasantly. Mabel had wanted her father
to see the companions she had chosen&mdash;her mother
had already made one of their party on two different

<!-- page 198 -->

evenings, and now when her father commended her
for the good judgment she had exercised in her selections
she was happy.</p>

<p>"It's rather queer that you should do so, daughter."
he said; "but I am not certain but it's wise, for your
eccentricities will protect you from the fops and fools
of the matrimonial market."</p>

<p>"A man's view of it," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"I do not have the idea of marriage thrust upon me
at every turn, when I am with them," said Mabel, with
just a shade of impatience in her voice.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, puss, girls are born to marry," said the
Judge, "so don't put on airs."</p>

<p>The next evening they all remained in the parlor
till quite late, and at the last Mabel and M. Costin
were discussing something that the others did not join
in, and they became so intent that one by one retired
till only they two remained in the room.</p>

<p>"We shall not agree," said Mabel, at length, "if we
talk all night," glancing at the same time at her watch.</p>

<p>"It is not worth disputing about," he said, as they
both rose to their feet, "and the time is so short that
I can be here."</p>

<p>"Does your mother go with you, Monsieur?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"She will go to England with grandfather, if I do
not return."</p>

<p>"And do you intend to remain in France?"</p>

<p>"There is only one thing that can induce me to return,
and&mdash;" his tongue refused to obey, he could only
look what he felt.</p>

<p>His hesitation and the tone of his voice startled her,

<!-- page 199 -->

and as she met his eye she understood. She flushed,
and then turned deadly pale, and seemed about to faint.
He put out his hand to support her, but she waved him
back, then his long-controlled feelings found utterance.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mabel," he said, "I have loved you so long; it
is the hope of my life, do not, do not send me away in
despair."</p>

<p>Mabel had recovered her self-control, and as soon as
the torrent of his words would permit, she said: "I
am very sorry, Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, don't refuse me, till you have had time to
think. I have startled you, and you don't know your
own mind yet; I will work with you, will devote my
life, my fortune to the work you have chosen."</p>

<p>"No, my good friend, I do not need time; it pains
me more than words can express to give you pain; I
honor you, next to my father, above all men, but I do
not, never can love you in that way."</p>

<p>"You love another," he said, his mind reverting to
Gray.</p>

<p>"No other has asked for my love. Good night;"
and she was gone.</p>

<p>He stood a moment, as if turned to stone, and then
with an effort to throw off the feeling of despair, he
turned and went to his room with: "I might have
known it; she has never given me cause to hope, why
did I speak?" He passed a sleepless night, and the
next morning his pale, almost haggard face told his
struggle, and under plea of severe headache he did
not come down till after the breakfast-hour, and then
announced that he was going to Boston for a few
days.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>Mabel went straight from the parlor to her mother's
room, after bidding M. Costin good-night, and going
up to her dropped upon her knees and buried her face
in her mother's lap.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I am so sorry," she said, bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>"But what is it?" and then she seemed to divine
what had happened, and added, "Has M. Costin proposed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I never dreamed of such a thing, and
to think that I must disappoint him, must give him
such pain, after all his years of patience and kindness
to me."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you know your own heart, daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure," she said, and in a way that made
her mother fear she had given her love elsewhere, but
her next words dissipated it: "I have never thought
of love; only my work holds my heart, and I never
once dreamed that he could feel that way toward
me."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you are not to blame," said her mother,
running her hand caressingly back and forth over her
hair. Presently she grew calm and arose and kissed
her mother good-night.</p>

<p>The next morning at the breakfast-table Walter
asked, "Where is M. Costin?"</p>

<p>"He has one of his severe headaches," said his
mother.</p>

<p>The next question was, "Where is Meb?"</p>

<p>"She has not come down yet; I think she has overslept
herself."</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p>"Whew, what's in the wind that Meb oversleeps?"</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond, who had been informed how matters
stood, uttered the single word, "Walter," and Walter
was silent.</p>

<p>About an hour after M. Costin had gone, the girl
who took care of the rooms said to Mrs. Raymond,
"What is the matter with Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"He said he had a headache, Mary."</p>

<p>"He looked more as if he had the heartache, and he
seemed so strange, and when I went to do the work in
his room, supposing he was down-stairs, I found him
at his table writing, and his trunk was all packed and
strapped, and his valise lay upon the floor beside it,
and as full as could be crowded."</p>

<p>" 'Are you going to leave us to-day, Monsieur?' I
asked, but he only asked, 'Is Miss Mabel up?' 'Not
yet,' I said, and he said, 'Do the other rooms, and then
come back here,' and he kept on writing. It seemed
so strange, I thought I would tell you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane; have you been back?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, I am going now. I thought I would tell
you first," and then the girl went on upstairs. It was
about fifteen minutes after that when M. Costin came
down and announced his intention of going to Boston.</p>

<p>"But you will have some breakfast first," said Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>"No, you know I never eat right after one of my
headaches," he said, with an attempted smile.</p>

<p>"How long will you be gone, Monsieur?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not many days, if I get back in time for the next
steamer to France; but I must hurry to catch the train.

<!-- page 202 -->

Good-morning, and the same to the others for me,
please;" and he was gone.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," she thought, "it will help to take
the edge from his disappointment." She had forgotten
what Mary had said about the trunk, but he had
hardly left the room when the girl hurried in looking
more excited than ever.</p>

<p>"What did Monsieur say?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"He said, 'Please clean my room right now, for
there will be someone here soon, and then take this
package and put it in Miss Mabel's room,' and then he
ran down the back-stairs. I did as he said, and then
took the package to Miss Mabel's room, and stayed to
put it in order. Just as I had finished, I heard a noise
and went to see what it meant, and a man was carrying
a trunk down the back-stairs. I then looked
into Monsieur's room and his trunk and valise were
gone."</p>

<p>"He was here only a minute ago, and said he must
hurry to catch the train for Boston; he will be back in
a few days," replied Mrs. Raymond, with the purpose
of satisfying the girl, but she thought it strange that
he should take his trunk. She then went and found
Mabel, and told her what Jane had said, and of the
package.</p>

<p>"Come with me, mamma," was her reply, as she
started for her room, but she was very pale.</p>

<p>There lay the package addressed to Miss Mabel Raymond.
Mabel took it up, glanced at it, and then said:
"Open it, mamma, please." Upon doing so they found
enclosed certificates for ten thousand dollars deposited
in a New York bank, with the words:</p>

<!-- page 203 -->

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Mabel</span>: Forgive me for presuming to
love you, and accept the inclosed to use in forwarding
your work. Truly yours,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Paul Dumark</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Costin</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>"Oh, mother!" was all that Mabel could utter.</p>

<p>There was another note, addressed to Mrs. Raymond,
and written for the family, which read as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear and valued Friends</span>: I have been very
foolish, but I could not help it; who could; and see
year after year so much goodness and loveliness combined?
I might have known that so rare a treasure
was not for me, but I have ventured and failed, so to
spare the embarrassment of further association under
the circumstances, and also the painful parting scene
in leaving those I love so well, I take this method of
going. Farewell,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Paul Costin</span>."</p>

<p>For some minutes mother and daughter sat in silence,
Mabel quietly weeping. At length Mrs. Raymond
said:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to have him leave in this way,
but as things are, perhaps it is best."</p>

<p>At dinner the Judge asked, "Where is Monsieur,
is he not down yet?"</p>

<p>"He has gone out," replied Mrs. Raymond; but,
when dinner was over, she asked them all to her own
room, all but Mabel, and then related what had occurred,
read his note, and stated the contents of
Mabel's. She would not have revealed the fact that

<!-- page 204 -->

Mabel had rejected M. Costin to George, only no other
reason could be given that would account for his sudden
departure; besides, George was a relative, and she
looked upon him as one of the family.</p>

<p>But M. Costin had been with them so long that he,
too, seemed as one of them, and surprise, sorrow, and
sympathy were so mingled it was hard to tell which
predominated, from the various expressions made by
the different parties. But the money was the greatest
surprise.</p>

<p>"Here he has been working for more than seven
years as a teacher, and yet rich enough to make a
donation like that," said the judge.</p>

<p>"I believe he was always a little afraid of those
priests," said George.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a rap upon the door,
which Mrs. Raymond recognized as Jane's. "Come,"
she said, and the girl entered with the announcement:
"A gentleman to see M. Costin; I told him Monsieur
was not here, and he then asked to see Mrs. Raymond."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond arose to her feet, and then, as she
afterward said, the Spirit moved her to sit down again.
"Go, Walter, and see who it is," she said, instead of
going herself.</p>

<p>Walter went to the waiting-room, but the first glance
startled him. He recovered his presence of mind in a
moment, however, and coolly said, "Did you wish to
see Mrs. Raymond, Father Bremen?"</p>

<p>The priest was more startled at this address than
Walter had been when he saw the priest, but he rallied
and said: "You mistake, sir, my name is Brentwood;

<!-- page 205 -->

but I have an important message for the gentleman
who, I understand, has for some years been a teacher
in this family, and I wish to learn where I can find
him."</p>

<p>"He is not here now, and I cannot give you his
present address."</p>

<p>"Does he not return here?" asked the stranger,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"He does not; but, I presume, when he gets settled
we shall hear from him," said Walter, still eying the
man suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Then please send word to this address, as the matter
is of great importance to him," handing Walter a
card on which he had pencilled an address.</p>

<p>Walter took it, bowed, and showed the man out;
then hurrying back to where the others were, exclaiming:
"Who do you think it was? Who but that infernal
old priest, Bremen. He tried to deny it, but he
didn't fool me in the least."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Walter," said the judge,
while the others looked their surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember the name of the priest
who stole M. Costin from his mother? I heard his
name called on the street one day, and I looked at him
too sharp to be mistaken; I told M. Costin he was
here, and he said he knew it, but that the priest did
not recognize him. Brentwood, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Was that the name he gave?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I called him Bremen as soon as I saw
him, and the rascal was too much startled to make me
believe his subterfuge."</p>

<p>"Thee is in the right," said Mrs. Raymond, with her

<!-- page 206 -->

Quaker style and look, "and M. Costin has been impressed
to leave as he has, thee may be sure, though
he may not understand why."</p>

<p>Some two weeks afterward Mrs. Raymond received
a letter from M. Costin, in which he assured her that
the money he had given Mabel would not in the least
incommode him, as he had an abundance; said that
the greatest happiness he had left was the thought
that he could thus aid her in her work. "Besides, I
had another reason for leaving as I did, which I had
not time to tell you. I did not go to bed for some
hours that night, but sat looking out the window and
thinking. It was dark in my room, so I could see and
not be seen. Two men stopped, or rather met, under
the lamp-post, and there was something about one that
seemed familiar. They stood and talked perhaps five
minutes, and then they both turned and looked toward
your house, and I distinctly saw Father Bremen. Toward
morning I threw myself on the bed and fell almost
immediately into a sort of a doze, and I distinctly
heard the words, 'Father Bremen is after you.' I was
wide awake in an instant, and the impression the words
made was such that, in connection with what had already
happened, I decided to leave as I did, and went
to packing my trunk.</p>

<p>"Again, I say, do not allow Mabel to hesitate to use
the money. I will give no address, but I shall hear from
you. I can plot as well as Father Bremen.</p>

<p class="right">"Farewell, <span class="smcap">M. Costin</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>"Did I not tell thee that M. Costin had warning?"
said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"You said he had been impressed, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, and does thee not see that the words
he heard impressed him?"</p>

<p>"I am impressed that you are both mejums," and
he went out singing one of his favorite ditties.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">USURY AND MOTHERHOOD.</p>

</div>

<p>FOR two years Mabel continued to study and
think, continued to meet as many of her
chosen friends from time to time&mdash;sisters
she called them&mdash;as could come and study
with her the problem she was trying to
solve, but she found many difficulties in the way.
Some from one cause and some from another were
sure to be absent.</p>

<p>Finally four of the girls married, went into homes
of their own, such as they were; two of them sickened
and died, and one went with her parents to another
city, so there were but three, besides herself and Sarah
Wilson, left. It looked rather discouraging, but
Mabel did not flag in the least from her purpose.
Others had from time to time come to her gatherings,
and that each had caught at least one new idea, and
would retain it, seemed probable.</p>

<p>At the gathering held on her twentieth birthday
they had an unexpected addition, none other than our
old friend Marion Hibbard. She had come that day
from Boston, and almost the first thing she asked was
how Mabel was prospering in her work.</p>

<p>"I have become a crank myself," she said, "since I
saw you. I never could forget what you said when I

<!-- page 209 -->

was here before, of the effect of ante-natal conditions
upon the character of the child, and I have watched
the results of good or bad conditions till I am fully
satisfied that the millennium will never come till all
that prevents nature from doing her best work in human
motherhood is removed."</p>

<p>"It is a mighty work, such removal," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary, but it must be done."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond looked up in her friend's face wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Well, I see the world does move. I never expected
to hear you talking in that strain," she said.</p>

<p>"It was Mabel's question about her being good and
Tommy Gove bad, that set me to thinking, so you see
she began her work then and there," replied Marion.</p>

<p>Mabel looked up with a glad light in her eye:
"First-fruits," she said.</p>

<p>"Are generally windfalls or wormy, but are better
than nothing," was Marion's quick retort; and then,
"so you have a class in the science of motherhood to-night.
I wish you would let me tell the girls a story,
and I want them all to hear; Walter, Mr. Gray&mdash;I believe
you said he was here&mdash;Mr. Raymond, and yourself,
Mary, with any others in the house that you think
can be benefited. I want to show you what ministers
cost, and the effect of usury upon motherhood."</p>

<p>Of course Mabel and her mother were delighted
with the proposition. As it was her birthday the
judge was persuaded to become a listener, though he
said, "The world is being turned upside down, sure."</p>

<p>When they were all gathered Miss Hibbard turned to

<!-- page 210 -->

Mrs. Raymond and said: "As you know some of the
parties, I shall tell you the story, and the others can
listen. You remember Frank Burton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, how could I forget her, she is a character in
her way."</p>

<p>"She certainly is; well, I visited her last summer
and stayed over two months. 'You have very fine college
buildings here,' I said, the next morning after my
arrival.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, we have,' was her quiet reply.</p>

<p>" 'Many students?'</p>

<p>" 'The college is well patronized.'</p>

<p>" 'Theological course?' I persisted.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, and a ladies' department also; or, if they
choose, the ladies can take a college course; several are
doing so.'</p>

<p>" 'That is progress; I suppose you will look for the
ballot next,' I said.</p>

<p>"She turned away, but I caught a look upon her
face I did not quite understand. 'What is the matter,
Frank?' I asked, for I expected some enthusiasm on
this her favorite theme when I last saw her.</p>

<p>" 'Nothing.'</p>

<p>" 'Nothing, nonsense, you can't put me off in that
way, you who used to talk so much of woman's having
equal rights with man, and now not a word to say of
this astonishing step in advance, a full college course
for woman: something is wrong.'</p>

<p>"She looked up at me as if surprised: 'Why,
Marion, did you not know that Oberlin College had
given equal educational opportunities to woman for several
years? This only patterns after that.'</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

<p>" 'No, I did not know it; I never troubled myself
to keep track of fanatics, you know, but I am
not to be put off. A change has come over the spirit
of your dream since you visited me ten years ago,
and what is it?' I asked.</p>

<p>"She smiled. 'Do you remember, Marion, the
lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'A little learning is a dangerous thing;<br/>

Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring,<br/>

Where shallow draughts intoxicate the brain.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"And that is what's the matter with our reformers,
they are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was not your put in, Judge Raymond," she
laughed, shaking her finger at him, and then "I interrupted
her with,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">" 'And drinking largely sobers us again.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>" 'Do you wish me to infer that you have been
drinking so deeply of this college spring as to take
all the enthusiasm out of you?'</p>

<p>"She turned and looked out of the window. There
comes Professor Getchell, he will be here to dinner.'</p>

<p>" 'Did you invite him?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, I want you two to become acquainted.' I
am telling it all, Mary," said Marion, by way of explanation,
"because I want you to see just the steps
it took to show me the curse of usury. 'I want you
two to become acquainted,' she said, 'so I began in
season, for I should like to keep you here, Marion.'</p>

<p>" 'What has keeping me here to do with Professor
Getchell?' I asked.</p>

<!-- page 212 -->

<p>" 'He's a bachelor,' she said in her old, teasing
tone.</p>

<p>" 'Oh, you mischief,' I called out, as I went to make
some changes in my dress.</p>

<p>"I knew that Frank had said what she did as a diversion,
that there was something lying back of it all,
and that I determined to find out.</p>

<p>"The dinner passed off pleasantly. Upon repairing
to the parlor the Professor remarked: 'And so you
have provided against loneliness in your husband's absence,'
glancing at me.</p>

<p>" 'I have provided myself with a foil against Mother
Grundy,' she laughingly retorted.</p>

<p>" 'You have beautiful college grounds here, and fine
buildings,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, we have, they are the admiration of all who
visit the place.'</p>

<p>" 'Handsomely endowed, I presume,' I continued, in
the meantime I was furtively watching Frank. She
sat toying with her watch-chain and did not seem to be
noticing.</p>

<p>" 'A hundred and fifty thousand,' he said.</p>

<p>" 'And that sum at ten per cent. is fifteen thousand
dollars, a pretty good income,' I remarked.</p>

<p>" 'You are very practical, Miss Hibbard,' he said, in
a sort of surprised way, 'but we get only eight per
cent., and it costs a great deal to keep up such an institution.'</p>

<p>" 'A great deal more than appears on the surface,'
said Frank, in a tone that made us both look up.</p>

<p>" 'What do you mean, Mrs. Burton?' he asked, after
a moment's silence.</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p>" 'I mean just what I say; is it not so?'</p>

<p>" 'It certainly is, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'You think my tone conveyed some hidden meaning?'
she said.</p>

<p>" 'It sounded like it. I fear you are getting impractical
notions into your head,' and then turning to me
he continued: 'We had a man here a while since who
claimed and tried to prove that interest for the use of
money is wrong, and ever since then your friend here
occasionally drops a remark that sounds as though she
was becoming affected with the same idea.'</p>

<p>" 'I was thinking long before he came,' she replied,
in the same quiet tone I had noticed from the first.</p>

<p>" 'Indeed! how long since?'</p>

<p>" 'I will tell you that another time, but please tell
me, sir, who earns those twelve thousand dollars?'</p>

<p>" 'Who earns them! why the people who hold that
money are glad to get it, and they make it pay them,
too!'</p>

<p>" 'I do not question that. I heard a member of the
manufacturing firm here say that they cleared twenty
per cent. last year. They hold fifty thousand of your
money I understand.'</p>

<p>" 'Did I not tell you that people were glad to get
the money, and if they can clear twenty per cent. they
certainly can afford to pay us eight,' he said, very earnestly.</p>

<p>" 'But you have not answered my question, Professor;
who earns that twenty per cent. and that eight
per cent.? Whose toil produces the results which
bring it? Not the college trustees, not the men who
borrow the money; now who does?'</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>" 'I suppose the men employed produce the material,
which when sold brings it,' was the reluctant admission.</p>

<p>" 'In other words, the men to whom that fifty thousand
dollars give employment must earn, produce over
and above the cost of running the establishment, twenty-eight
per cent. more than they receive.'</p>

<p>" 'Twenty-eight per cent.!' he said in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, twenty to the borrower and eight to you. I
cannot speak for the balance of your endowment fund,
but I presume the cost to labor is about the same.'</p>

<p>" 'The cost to labor, Mrs. Burton!'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, sir, or rather, the laborer. I fear, Professor,
if the cost was all counted&mdash;the wrecks all brought in&mdash;all
the men who take to drink because of overwork
and poor pay&mdash;all the children badly born because
their mothers were overworked&mdash;because of the lack
of what their husbands earn but do not get&mdash;all of my
sex who are gradually dragged into the depths because
of the pressure brought to bear upon them that you
may get your twelve thousand, and those who hold
your money the profit they expect, I think you would
conclude it costs more to run such an institution than
appears on the surface.'</p>

<p>"No one spoke for several moments. At length Mr.
Getchell said: 'I did not know as you could be so eloquent,
Mrs. Burton.'</p>

<p>" 'Was that the only point you noticed?' she said,
in a tone that brought the blood to his face.</p>

<p>" 'No, indeed! the things you mention are terrible,
and if it can be shown that they are the legitimate results

<!-- page 215 -->

of interest-taking, it would forever condemn the
practice; but I cannot see it so,' he said.</p>

<p>" 'I tried not to, but was forced to yield,' she said.
'I tell you, Professor, your reforms amount to nothing;
the whole system must be changed, and the magnitude
of the work appals me."</p>

<p>Here Miss Hibbard paused in her story to remark:
"When I heard her talk of the effect upon the children
of stinted and tired mothers, my mind went right
back to that conversation when you was but ten years
old, Mabel, and I wondered if the whole system must
be changed, and if you had found it so."</p>

<p>"I am studying the question yet, and your story will
help me to decide," Mabel replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I must keep to it, or I shall tire you all:
'And you look like an inspired prophetess declaring
its doom,' said the Professor, trying to laugh off what
was becoming too serious for comfort.</p>

<p>" 'Here then was the secret I sought. This was why
Frank had that far-away look when I questioned her.
I must talk with her, I am becoming interested, I must
study this question for myself&mdash;' such were my thoughts
as I listened. The Professor looked at his watch, and
regretted that he could not remain longer. 'Come
again,' she said, as she went with him to the door,
'now the subject has been broached, I want to talk
with you more.'</p>

<p>" 'Thanks, I shall certainly avail myself of the opportunity,'
was his reply, but he did not come again
while I was there.</p>

<p>"The next morning I expressed a desire for further
conversation on the question, and she only replied:

<!-- page 216 -->

'Come with me,' and taking her hat and sunshade, and
indicating that I was to do the same, started out. She
led the way across the common to a sort of Potter's
Field, and paused beside a grave at the head of which
was a small, plain slab, on which was the single word,
'Helen.'</p>

<p>"I read the name and wondered why she had
brought me there, and then remembered that I had
once a friend by that name of whom I had lost track.
I had an indistinct memory of hearing she was
dead, but of the when, where, and how I had not
the least idea. I looked at Frank, and something I
saw in her face made me fear, I hardly knew what.</p>

<p>" 'It is not&mdash;it cannot be,' I began.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Marion, it is Helen Peck;' she interrupted,
'she is one of the wrecks.'</p>

<p>" 'Caused by that college fund?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'In part,' was her reply; 'the college funds did not
make the business pressure nor the lack of work, but
they together wrecked Helen Peck, or Campbell, for
she was married.</p>

<p>" 'Now, Marion,' she continued, 'I want you to understand
that I am not <i>blaming</i> the college people, nor the
ministry. Could they see the enormity of the property
system under which we live, as I do, they would shrink
from it with horror; yes, that college fund is connected
with Helen's ruined life, but it would have been the
same had they borrowed the money elsewhere. It is
the taking of interest-usury that makes the mischief."</p>

<p>" 'You say she was married, did she marry well?' I
asked.</p>

<p>" 'If you mean did she get a good husband, yes; but

<!-- page 217 -->

he was poor. He was very industrious and had the
confidence of all who knew him. I never saw a couple
more devoted to each other. They had one child, a
beautiful little girl.'</p>

<p>" 'Is she living?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, she is completing her education.'</p>

<p>" 'Who is educating her?'</p>

<p>" 'She has found friends;' was the reply, in a tone
that forbade further questioning.</p>

<p>" 'Verner Campbell had saved five hundred dollars,'
she continued; 'that was his fortune when he married
Helen. Her parents went to Oregon soon after, and
her father, when they left, gave her two hundred more,
making seven hundred between them. With this they
decided to buy a small place, for which they paid twelve
hundred, borrowing the other five hundred of the college,
for which they gave a mortgage upon the place,
he agreeing to pay ten per cent. interest, with the understanding
that so long as the interest was paid the
principal could stand.'</p>

<p>" 'I begin to see,' I said.</p>

<p>"Without noticing my remark she continued: 'For
six years they paid their fifty dollars a year, all this
time improving the place, and the seventh year they
commenced to lay by to pay off the mortgage; but before
the year was half gone there came a financial
crash. Verner tried hard to stem the tide, but his
plans were all upset. He did manage to pay the interest,
but anxiety and overwork, with a not very
strong constitution, were too much for him, and after a
two months' sickness he died.'</p>

<p>" 'And then the place had to be sold,' I said.</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>" 'Yes, Marion, a woman must have someone to look
after her, you know. Had she died he would have
been left to manage his own affairs,' she said in a tone
of bitterness.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, I know, Frank, she must have someone to
look after things and take a goodly portion of what was
left, but the college was not to blame for that,' I remarked.</p>

<p>" 'I know it, Marion, but still the place had to be
sold, and as prices were down, the college trustees got it
for a thousand dollars, their debt and five hundred more.
In two years' time they were offered two thousand and
would not take it. They got two hundred in rent annually.
After taking out their five hundred, paying the
funeral expenses, the expense of selling, and the doctor's
bill, Helen had two hundred and fifty dollars left.'</p>

<p>" 'Seven hundred dollars and seven years' work had
dwindled down to that sum,' I exclaimed, 'while
without work the college five hundred had drawn three
hundred and fifty in cash, and had not shrunk at all.'</p>

<p>" 'Worse than that, Marion,' she replied, 'their five
hundred, by putting five hundred with it, secures a
piece of property worth four times five hundred.'</p>

<p>" 'Abominable,' I said, walking back and forth beside
the grave in my excitement. You see, friends, I
had never thought on this question before, and to have
had it illustrated through the sufferings of one I had
known and loved touched me deeply.</p>

<p>"Frank smiled. 'They must have money to educate
young men for the ministry,' she said.</p>

<p>" 'The ministry be&mdash;well, I never want to see another
minister, if that is what they cost!'</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>" 'Keep cool, Marion, I am not done yet,' she said.</p>

<p>"I resumed my seat on the rough bench, that some
one had placed there, and she continued: 'If there
was one thing that Helen worshipped it was her
child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Made an idol of it, and God punished her, I suppose
the preacher would say,' I interrupted.</p>

<p>" 'Don't, Marion, I am ashamed of my kind that
they can think of anything so preposterous. A God
who could be jealous of his creatures because of their
love for each other would deserve only contempt.'</p>

<p>" 'But it is taught, all the same,' I urged.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Church teachings come between
husband and wife, parent and child, brother and sister;
I do not wonder that the world is full of discord.'</p>

<p>"The idea was new to me. 'I never thought of
that,' I said, 'as a cause of discord, but really it is a
logical conclusion; go on, please, and I will try and not
interrupt you again.'</p>

<p>" 'As I was saying, she was passionately fond of her
child,' she resumed, 'and determined that at any and
all cost she should have an education. Her home was
gone, so she came into town, rented a place, and
boarded students. She kept no girl, so had to work
very hard sometimes, doing her boarders' washing even,
and often sitting up half the night. I presume you
know, Marion, that in institutions of this kind board,
washing, and all else in that line is put at the lowest
figure, the motive being to make the course as cheap as
possible.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' I said, 'theological students are generally
poor, I believe.'</p>

<!-- page 220 -->

<p>" 'Mostly so, rich men's sons seldom choose that
calling.'</p>

<p>" 'But what made it easier for them made it harder
for Helen, and at best she could but little more than
meet expenses. Such struggles soon tire one out, soul
and body, and under such conditions one often does
what under other conditions they would not think of
doing. She married again, and not wisely.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, Frank, how could she! She could not have
loved him,' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>" 'She was tired out: she was not herself, and he
obtained a psychological power over her. Still, all are
not like you, Marion, utter unbelievers in a second
love. He was all kindness in all that could be
seen." Here Miss Hibbard paused.</p>

<p>"I do not want to shock your modesty," she said,
"but I want to finish this story just as Mrs. Burton
told it to me, and if we are searching for the causes
that stand in the way of the highest order of motherhood,
what I wish to say should certainly be told."</p>

<p>"Do not hesitate, Marion," said Mrs. Raymond,
"we have no false modesty here, and I will risk all
that you can say."</p>

<p>"You will think I have been converted, made new,"
said Miss Hibbard, with a smile, "and so I have, but
it is to Humanity instead of God; but to go on with
Mrs. Burton's story of Helen's wrongs. 'He was kindness
itself in all that could be seen, but his demands
upon her as a wife were more than she could endure,
and when she refused him he struck her&mdash;this but six
weeks after marriage.*</p>

<p class="small">[*A fact.]</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>" 'The brute, I wouldn't&mdash;I wouldn't&mdash;have stayed
with him an hour longer,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'She did not; she took her child and came to me.
"I cannot endure it," she said. "I shall die, and then
Lola will have no one to take care of her."</p>

<p>" 'And the law makes no provision against marital
murder?' I asked, or rather asserted.</p>

<p>" 'None whatever, Marion. Of course she was
condemned. They said she was breaking her sacred
marriage vows.'</p>

<p>"I will pass over all the remarks I made about such
sacredness, friends, and continue Mrs. Burton's part of
the story.</p>

<p>" 'I think,' she said, 'that Helen's trouble partly unhinged
her reason. A friend of mine, a physician tells
me that the abuse of the creative functions often produces
that effect. The Church cut her off from its fellowship
because she would not live with her husband,
and she was about as helpless as a woman well could
be, while her all-absorbing thought was how she could
educate Lola.'</p>

<p>" 'She said to me one day, while talking of her life
with&mdash;I will not call him husband&mdash;'I know there are
men who would be glad to support me, and who would
not murder me either,' and after a moment she added:
'I'm an outcast now, and it couldn't be much worse.'
There was a wild look in her eye that alarmed me, and
I said soothingly, 'Never mind, you shall always have
a home with me.'</p>

<p>" 'Soon after that she left me, and in a few days I
received a note from her which read: 'I am lost,
Frank, do not try to seek me, but Lola will be educated.

<!-- page 222 -->

I have put her where she will have good advantages,
and she will never know at what cost to her
wretched mother.'</p>

<p>" 'For a year or so I saw her occasionally, and always
well dressed; but after that she began to go
down, and the end was reached about a year since.
She sent for me at the last, told me where Lola was,
and committed her to my care. I have adopted her.'</p>

<p>" 'I little thought that Helen Peck would ever come
to such an end,' I said, as soon as I could speak for
tears.</p>

<p>" 'Do you wonder, then, Marion,' she said, 'that I
do not mourn for my children? Had Mary lived, she
might have met a similar fate. No more unlikely than
that Helen should, as things were when I first met
her.'</p>

<p>" 'But your boy,' I said, 'society could not have
cursed him in the same way.'</p>

<p>" 'True,' she replied, 'but there are various kinds of
wrecks. There is a gentleman living down the river
about a mile, who manufactures different kinds of
machinery; he holds twenty thousand dollars of the
college fund and employs a good many men. He is
very good to them, and they all like him.</p>

<p>" 'When the crash came that ruined Verner Campbell,
he called his men together and stated the case to
them. "Now, gentlemen," said he, "you must pull
with me or I must go down. If I am forced to stop
that twenty thousand must be paid, and at the ruinous
rates at which things will be sold, I shall be utterly
broken up, and you will have to seek employment elsewhere.</p>

<!-- page 223 -->

<p>" ' "I have looked the ground all over; my family
will retrench to the utmost, and if you will consent to
twenty per cent. reduction on your wages, I think I can
go through." After a little thought, the unanimous response
was, "we will." He weathered the storm.'</p>

<p>" 'Without any wrecks?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'That is the point, Marion. The men were heart
and soul with their employer; they worked like heroes,
and at least three of them now fill drunkards'
graves, the habit being induced during that struggle,
they working beyond their strength and stimulating
to keep up.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, Frank, are you certain of this?' I said.</p>

<p>" 'As certain as I am of anything, Marion. Their
poor wives tell me that they never drank before. The
overwork and the stimulant so weakened them that
they could not throw off the habit.'</p>

<p>" 'This is terrible,' I moaned, dropping my face in
my hands. There was a quiet power in the way she
told all this which made me see it all&mdash;feel it, till I
actually writhed.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, it is terrible, but this is not all,' she continued.
'I have taken pains to study the children born
during that year of struggle and averaged with those
born in more prosperous years&mdash;they are inferior both
physically and mentally. So much for the interest on
twenty thousand dollars of the college money, for the
college must not fail, no matter who or what else perishes;
what, then, of a hundred and fifty thousand?
And if such are the results here, how many wrecks are
there in the whole, yes, throughout the civilized world?'
she added, with kindling eye."</p>

<!-- page 224 -->

<p>"Well, well, well," said the judge, "I never expected
to hear Marion Hibbard talking like this; it is
a miracle."</p>

<p>"No, Judge Raymond, you mistake," she replied.
"In my younger days, I was thoughtless, careless, but
not heartless. Mrs. Burton, in speaking of Professor
Getchell, said his heart was all right, and she was trying
to reach his head. She reached my head and
made me understand."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE PHILOSOPHER SPEAKS.</p>

</div>

<p>IN a previous chapter, or, rather on his first
introduction to our readers, we spoke of
George Gray as the young philosopher.
Years have not lessened his thinking capacity.
He has continued to reason from
cause to effect, but while studying problems he has not
talked very much; but after listening to Miss Hibbard's
story, as related in our last chapter, he expressed a wish
to meet with Mabel's class, as he called it, at its next
gathering and do some talking.</p>

<p>"I do not expect to instruct you, ladies," he said,
"but I may be able to say something to help solve the
question under consideration; and, as our present civilization
is, so far as the ruling power is concerned,
emphatically a masculine civilization, perhaps I may
understand some of its workings better than woman
can."</p>

<p>So, when the time came, Walter, George, Mabel, her
four friends, her mother, and Miss Hibbard, nine in all,
were present&mdash;all who had been at the previous gathering
except the judge. After a little general conversation
the speaker of the evening, as Walter called him,
said:</p>

<p>"As I understand the purpose of this and previous

<!-- page 226 -->

meetings, it is to ascertain what it is that stands in the
way of the best conditions for motherhood, and as all
must have mothers to bring them into this life, I have
an interest in this question. I have a good mother, but
that she had the best conditions for transmitting to me
the highest endowment it was possible to bestow upon
me, is not so sure. That she gave me the best she
could under the conditions I do not question, but
better conditions might have enabled her to produce
better work.</p>

<p>"But all mothers have not had even good conditions,
to say nothing of the best, and thousands are surrounded
by the worst conditions possible, and as a result
we have natural criminals&mdash;men and women who
are born damned. Now we have a daily birth of scores
of infants so embedded in criminality that you may
lay your hand on each and say that if not rescued by
a miracle this child is inevitably destined to a criminal
career."</p>

<p>"Do you not think," asked Miss Hibbard, "that such
children, could they be taken away from all criminal
surroundings, could be so reared as to obviate this
criminal tendency?"</p>

<p>"I do not. That with some the tendency might be
modified, I believe, but not wholly eradicated; besides,
such training, and the surroundings adapted to the case
would be almost a miracle, because they must have different
training than our well-born children need. They
would have to be placed where every possible influence
could be brought to bear upon those qualities that were
deficient, and there must not only be the absence of all
that could tempt to crime, but such restraint as would

<!-- page 227 -->

forcibly hold them from going where the unsatisfied
inherited tendency would naturally lead them if left to
themselves."</p>

<p>"As I have observed human nature, there are many
good children who would become bad with bad surroundings,
and many bad ones who would become good
with good surroundings; but sometimes we find a child
so well born that no amount of temptation, or privation,
or even evil companions can drag him down, and
of course the reverse will hold good," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we are now speaking of things as they
are, and to children so born and destined to so live, it
would be a mercy to kill them when they utter their
first cry&mdash;yes, a mercy, for our civilization cares not a
straw for them; it permits them to be trained in crime,
and then, at greater cost than would have provided for
their mothers good conditions in the first place, imprisons
or hangs them."</p>

<p>"It would be better for those who have such surroundings
to refuse to become mothers," said Miss
Hibbard.</p>

<p>George Gray turned and looked at the speaker a
moment. "Miss Hibbard," he said, "do you forget
Helen Peck's second marriage?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Mr. Gray, but she had no such surroundings
as those of which we are speaking."</p>

<p>"Do you not know that she not only violated her
pledge, but the law, when she refused her husband's
demands upon her?"</p>

<p>"Violated the law!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the law of the land gives the husband the unlimited

<!-- page 228 -->

right to his wife's person, and in case of refusal
will give him a divorce, and the right to marry again;
she being cast off with nothing, even if she was rich, unless
she holds her property in her own name, and the law
gives him the control of the children, if there be any.
If I am not mistaken, murderers are often made by
the feelings of the unwilling mother being stamped
upon the child. She often tries to destroy it, and if
not, wishes it dead before it sees the light. Helen left
the man who called her wife, was condemned by society
for it, and driven to ruin.</p>

<p>"Now think of the wives of those men who are
ignorant, debased, and unfitted for anything but sensual
pleasure, and tell me how such wives can avoid becoming
mothers? The marriage system, as it exists to-day,
the power that the husband holds over the wife, stands
in the way of perfect motherhood."</p>

<p>"And 'embedded in criminality' is as true of children
so begotten, and so gestated, as of any other, no
matter how good the conditions and surroundings
otherwise; for enforced motherhood, and enforced so-called
marital rights are the greatest of crimes against
nature," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"I believe you, madam, and were all children rightly
born, and then taught as my mother taught me, such
crimes would never be committed; but I want to take
up the interesting part of Miss Hibbard's story. Mrs.
Burton says to Professor Getchell: 'Your reforms
amount to nothing; the whole system must be changed,
and the magnitude of the work appals me.' Now we
want to find if she is correct, and if so, our efforts must
be directed to that end."</p>

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"The whole system," said Walter, "that is a big
work; I think you will have to count me out."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"We want no cowards in our band,<br/>

They will their colors fly;<br/>

We call for valiant-hearted men<br/>

Who are not afraid to die."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Oh, yes, Miss Meb, those lines are easily repeated,
and you women think it a nice thing to have men die
for you; suppose you try it yourselves," said Walter,
as Mabel concluded her quotation.</p>

<p>"Mamma nearly died that you might live, my son,"
said Mrs. Raymond, in a tone of tenderness that so
touched him as to bring the quick tears, though he
tried to hide it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, it is a big work," replied George, "and
the fact that it must take more than one generation to
bring it about will test our love for Humanity. If we
do what we can toward it, present reward, other than
the love of doing, will not enter into our thoughts to
urge us on."</p>

<p>"You mean that the force which holds us to our
work must come from within instead of from without,"
said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have expressed the idea," he said, "but
Miss Hibbard has illustrated the cost of making ministers;
I propose to carry out the idea by showing
what it costs to keep them when they are made. I
have before me a statement in reference to some of
the ministers of this city which I propose to read,
and then apply. It is from a recently published
work, issued by Burr &amp; Co., of Hartford, and copyright

<!-- page 230 -->

secured both in this country and in England. It is
headed:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ministry of New York</span>.</p>

<p>" 'This city is the paradise of preachers. The clergy
are independent and well supported. Many who
came to the city poor are rich. Some have saved a
fortune; others have married a fortune; others have
been fortunate in speculations in stock, oil, and real estate.
Ministers can do in New York, and maintain
their position, what the profession can do in no other
city. No churches are more elegant or parsonages
more costly than those of the Methodist denomination,
and their ministers enjoy salaries exceeded by few.</p>

<p>" 'Trinity Church, the wealthiest (Church) corporation
in the land, has four parishes, a rector, and six assistant
ministers. The rector has a yearly salary of ten
thousand dollars and a house. The assistants have each
six thousand dollars and a house. Munificent presents,
a tour to Europe, a life settlement, a provision for sickness
and old age, are among the perquisites which these
ministers enjoy.</p>

<p>" 'Dr. Spring, of the Old Brick Church, came to
New York a young man and poor. He has always
lived in a fashionable part of the city, keeps his carriage
and footman, and is a wealthy citizen. From
Philadelphia to the old Beekman Street Church of St.
George came Dr. Twing. A large salary has enabled
him to live in good style. He rides in his carriage,
owns valuable estate, and is wealthy. Dr. Hardenburg,
of the Reformed Dutch Church, has always lived in

<!-- page 231 -->

good style, and, possessing a fortune, dwells at his ease.
Dr. Van Nest is one of the richest men in New York.
His own wealth and that of his wife make a colossal
fortune.</p>

<p>" 'The Collegiate Church, older than Trinity, has
four pastors, to each of whom an elegant house and a liberal
salary are given. Dr. Vermilyea, who came to the
city from a small Congregational church in Massachusetts,
is in possession of a handsome fortune, and dwells
in metropolitan style in the upper part of New York.
Dr. Adams has a fine fortune, and dwells in a fine mansion
within a stone's throw of that abode of aristocracy,
Madison Square. Dr. Spear, by a fortunate speculation
in stocks, acquired a fortune. Dr. Smith, his
neighbor, bought an oil-well, and wrote himself down
worth two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>" 'Professor Hitchcock, of Union Seminary, owns the
elegant mansion in which he lives on Fifth Avenue.
Dr. Taylor, of Grace Church, had one of the costly city
residences, and, with his country-seat, lived like a millionnaire.
Drs. Burchard and Hatfield live in fine
brown-stone mansions, which they own, and in which
they enjoy the comforts of a luxurious home. Dr.
Crosby inherits the vast wealth of his father. Dr.
Booth dwells at ease, supported by a wealthy parish
and a wealthy parent.</p>

<p>" 'Dr. Farley, supported by one of the wealthiest
congregations in the State, resigned, and took with him,
as a parting gift, a donation of twenty-five thousand
dollars. Dr. Osgood has always enjoyed a large salary,
has a fine city residence, and a country-seat, where he
passes his summer vacations. In no place on the continent

<!-- page 232 -->

are parishes more liberal, more devoted to their
pastors than in New York.'</p>

<p>"We here have a statement of the material conditions
of twenty-six ministers, and their combined salaries,
aside from the houses they own or are furnished
them, are fully equal, if not greater, than the endowment
fund of that college of which Miss Hibbard told
us, and who earns it?" said George in conclusion.</p>

<p>"If that is Christian civilization I want none of it,"
said Walter.</p>

<p>"Do you think it wrong that ministers should be
rich, any more than that Church members should?"
asked Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong somewhere," replied
Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, there is, and I think you are wrong
in calling this a Christian civilization. I use masculine
in the place of Christian, because it seems to me
the proper term. If I mistake, I shall be glad to stand
corrected," said George.</p>

<p>"I did not suppose you were partial to Christianity,
George."</p>

<p>"Neither am I, but I do not hold an effect responsible
for its cause, and if I understand the religions of
the world, Christianity included, they are all of them
branches of the tree whose root is a masculine God,
with masculine domination. They are all systems in
which motherhood is dishonored unless regulated by
masculine rule, unless woman pledges herself to be
obedient to man during life," he replied.</p>

<p>"That is a new idea, but I think a correct one," said
Mabel.</p>

<!-- page 233 -->

<p>"Yes, and it will keep till we have further use for
it; I want to take hold of those ministers again.
They are non-producers; they are richly supported,
and their ostensible business that of saving souls; now
suppose we look into this matter a little. If it can be
shown that the money which it costs to keep them, by
being drawn, directly or indirectly, from the toiling
classes, destroys as many or more souls than they save,
even admitting their terrible theology to be true, and
that souls need saving, then we have made a good
count against them. What were the number of
rooms, Mabel, the Rev. Mr. Huntington gave for one
square of tenement-houses?"</p>

<p>"One thousand seven hundred and thirty-six."</p>

<p>"Thank you; now I do not know what is the rent
paid, but it is not less upon the average than two dollars
per room, per month, or six dollars per family for three
rooms, and that would bring over forty thousand dollars.
The presumption is that this estimate is too low, but we
will call it that, and then taking off eleven thousand for
taxes, repairs, insurance, and care of the building, collecting
rents, etc., and we have thirty thousand dollars
as profit to the owners. But as I have not looked into
this matter of risk, cost of collecting, etc., do not know
how many men are employed, and other matters connected
with the business, I will put in four thousand
dollars more into that fund, and we then have twenty
six thousand left."</p>

<p>"Twenty-six thousand dollars clear profit on a block
of such buildings," said Nellie Stone; "I never
thought it could be so much, and the poor people pay
it."</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>"Yes, the poor people pay it; but how many people
live in these rooms?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand and seventy-six, this was the estimate
of Mr. Huntington of one block only; I suppose
they vary," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Over two thousand souls, and at least half of them
children, and it will take some six blocks to pay the
salaries of those twenty-six ministers' salaries, untaxed;
the parsonages in which they live, if church property,
untaxed; the great churches in which they preach, untaxed,
and everyone of those poor people paying more
rent for their rooms because the owners pay higher
tax to make up for the untaxed Church property; a
pretty heavy count."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the account is not yet all in," said Walter.</p>

<p>"I am aware of that, sir. Now, in six such blocks
there are at least six thousand children, three thousand
men, and as many women, besides the transients.
Of one-fourth of those children it may be said that
they will, sooner or later, commit some criminal act,
and so of the six thousand men and women; and all
the cost of the courts, witnesses, lawyers' fees, police
salaries, everything in that line that requires an extra
officer, or an extra dollar, every single crime that would
not have been committed if the subjects thereof
could have had the benefit of that money&mdash;both before
and after birth&mdash;of the money paid to those ministers
and of the cost of the crimes committed because of the
lack of it, all this is chargeable to the account."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the cost of the extra jails, prisons, and
keepers," added Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"And yet," continued George, "these ministers are

<!-- page 235 -->

not more responsible for this state of things than others
are. It is the system&mdash;the masculine system. In the
planetary worlds there are two forces acting as equals,
which balance and harmonize. One, called the centripetal,
draws to the centre, the sun; the other, called
the centrifugal, unrestrained, would send the planets
off in a straight line through space. The two acting
as a check, each upon the other, keep our earth and the
other planets in their appropriate places."</p>

<p>"You mean to call the centralizing force the feminine
and the other the masculine, if I understand your
illustration, and if so, it is easy to see why it is that
things are so out of joint; the masculine, the projecting
element, has held undue power," said Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I mean, and yet man is doing no
worse than woman would do did she hold undue power.
Each must find their true places as equals ere harmony
can come, or justice be done, and that woman's sphere
is pre-eminently that of motherhood, of looking after
and caring for, as well as gestating, seems to me too
plain to be denied; consequently, whenever man projects
his work into her sphere, either as it interferes
with the best conditions for motherhood in the first
place, or as caretaker afterward, he is cursing himself,
her, and the race.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'For ages past the men have led<br/>

In Church, and State, and home,<br/>

And battle-fields have strewn with dead<br/>

To gild ambition's dome.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Furnham, in her 'Woman and her Era,'
claims that man has ambition, woman aspiration&mdash;that

<!-- page 236 -->

ambition brings war and all its attendant evils&mdash;that
aspiration would lift the world above the war
plane; but we are running off into the abstract. We
must not lose sight of the practical in this important
search, and I assert that cities themselves, as they
now exist, stand right across the path of true motherhood."</p>

<p>"What will you do with them, burn them?" asked
Walter, with a comical grimace.</p>

<p>"No, I would spread them out till no woman would
have to climb two, three, or four pair of stairs to
get back to her room every time she went upon the
street."</p>

<p>"New York would spread a good ways," remarked
Sarah Wilson.</p>

<p>"It seems to me you have not brought all the cost
of poor tenement-houses to society into account yet,"
said Mabel.</p>

<p>George looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You say nothing of the cost of the poverty and
sickness that is not attended with crime, the cost of
the charities."</p>

<p>"True," he replied, "that is a very large item."</p>

<p>"Charity," said Mabel, "is called a Christian grace,
an evidence of the humanizing tendency of the Christian
religion, but I agree with Professor Clifford when
he says to the churches: 'You have stretched out
your hand to save the <i>dregs</i> of the <i>sifted sediment</i> of a
residuum.' "</p>

<p>"So you would obliterate the charities too? What
destroyers you are!" said Walter.</p>

<p>"I would obliterate the charities by destroying the

<!-- page 237 -->

need for them," she replied, "and it seems to me a very
suspicious kind of charity, that which takes the dregs,
the residuum of our cities&mdash;children having by the law
of heredity every taint of evil&mdash;and scatters them all
through the country in Christian families, thus vitiating
society to build up the Church. It is counted
Christian charity, this scattering the seeds of human
weeds&mdash;of human dregs&mdash;but I should call it a Christian
curse."</p>

<p>"What would you do with them, Mabel?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"What would you do with those who had been
exposed to small-pox, mother? No, if such crime-tainted
specimens must continue to be manufactured
it were better that the grave became the quarantine."</p>

<p>"You would not kill them, Miss Mabel?" asked
Mary Green.</p>

<p>"No, Mary, but I would see to it that the contagion
did not spread. Even the heartless cruelty of society&mdash;the
cruelty which says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'Huddle them in, huddle them in!<br/>

They have no money, no home, no kin!<br/>

They cannot come, or go, or stay&mdash;<br/>

Crack the whip, driver, and drive them away.<br/>

Drive them away down the crazy stones,<br/>

Rabble and rags and rotting bones;<br/>

Tax-gatherers of the people's toil<br/>

For prisons in which to rot and spoil.<br/>

Hurry them off to the hospital!<br/>

The great iron gate as it creaks with pain,<br/>

Says, 'Who enters here never comes out again.'<br/>

The steam that puffs up from the dead-boat's stack<br/>

Says, 'They'll never come back! They'll never come back!'<br/>

<!-- page 238 -->

And the Potter's Field, with its mound of green,<br/>

Says, 'The grave is the only quarantine<br/>

For suffering, woe, disease, and crime,<br/>

And all the horrors that thrill their time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>even that horrid picture is more merciful to society
at large than would be their scattering through the
land in the many homes that are comparatively happy."</p>

<p>"Where did you get those lines?" asked Nellie
Stone, while Sarah Wilson covered her face with her
hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>"They are from a dirge called 'The Black Maria.'
But I have interrupted Mr. Gray; he was going to
show us how cities stood right across the path that
leads to the best conditions for motherhood. I will
try and not interrupt you again;" she said, turning to
George. "Please proceed."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me what would become of
cities if the poor and the vile were all removed?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Mabel paused, thought a moment, and then said:
"I have not investigated the subject enough to be able
to answer that question."</p>

<p>"Then I will ask another; what would become of a
tiger if its bowels were torn out?"</p>

<p>"Do you compare our cities to tigers, George?"</p>

<p>"How much better are they? Do they not consume
the very life-force of the toiler, drink him up&mdash;his
blood, like water, and grind up not only his
bones but his babes&mdash;his little ones&mdash;to increase the
fortunes of the rich? Dry up the forced contributions
of the classes I have named, and what would be

<!-- page 239 -->

the result? We have found by computation what one
block of tenement-houses contributes. Where would
the owner get the money to pay the taxes and the insurance
if it were not occupied?"</p>

<p>"To say nothing of the loss of employment to the
agent, and to those who are paid for watching and taking
care of it, and the twenty-five thousand dollars out
of which he can help pay the minister, buy silks and
diamonds for his wife and daughters, or take a trip to
Europe," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"The evils of which we have spoken," said George,
"are the inseparable results of our system of usury
and land monopoly. Society as it exists to-day in our
cities cannot do without the degraded, the reckless, the
cunning, the desperate poor. Without them our cities
would tumble in pieces as readily as does a barrel with
the hoops off.</p>

<p>"Whence come the revenues of so many of our rich
property-holders here and in other cities? Some of
them own whole blocks, yes, almost whole streets.
There are many thousands who rent of these rich men,
and then subrent, thus making their living off the
under-renters. Every room, every cellar, every garret,
every outhouse must be utilized at the highest price
possible.</p>

<p>"Now suppose that in one day some beneficent
power could take all those who are too poor to live in
good quarters, or so degraded that they do not care
for better surroundings, and transplant them to homes
in the country with plenty as their lot, thus leaving
every garret, every dark unhealthy cellar, every dilapidated
room empty, what would be the result?</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>"Not a dollar for the use of the empty rooms to
swell the pockets of their owners. The sums that these
wretched ones pay as rent, and for the absolute necessities
of life, would, if withdrawn, so upset the general
stream of business that props could not prevent the
inevitable tumbles that would occur, and the misery
created would be greater than that relieved."</p>

<p>"I think you have proved your point," said Miss
Hibbard.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, as I see these things, cities as they
exist to-day are both moral and physical swamps, from
which gangrene and miasma exhale continually, poisoning
the very atmosphere in which the prospective
mother must live and breathe. It enters into her
veins and reaches even to the little nest under her
heart where the coming one cuddles like an unfledged
bird.</p>

<p>"I have hitherto said but little, but the more I investigate,
the more determined do I become to work
while life lasts for such a change in our social system
as will remove from coming generations that which
now poisons life at its fountain."</p>

<p>Mabel looked and listened with her soul in her eyes,
and when he made his declaration of devotion to humanity's
cause she took a step forward as if to place
herself by his side; then paused, while the quick blood
suffused face and neck, but their eyes met.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you need not come to me," as he
stepped to her side; "I come to you as your devoted
servant in this work, that may yet bring us martyrdom."</p>

<p>"Not as my servant, but as my equal," she replied,

<!-- page 241 -->

as she placed her hand in his, and all present felt that
it was an unpremeditated but genuine betrothal.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Raymond told her husband of what had
happened, he said: "It is all right; I have long looked
upon George as a son." George himself was very
much surprised that he had so forgotten everything
but his love, "but how could I help it when she called
me," he said.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">BACK TO KANSAS.</p>

</div>

<p>FROM thence on George and Mabel were considered
engaged, and they in their happiness
seemed content to rest awhile as acknowledged
lovers, leaving the thought
of the closer relation for the future to settle.
Love so intellectual and spiritual does not hasten
toward physical consummation, but takes time
to bring all the powers of the being to the sacred
shrine.</p>

<p>George had been kept informed of the condition of
affairs at home. The first year after he left, the payment,
with the eighty dollars of interest to Ozmun, was
promptly met; but the second year the crops were so
far destroyed by drouth and grasshoppers that half
the cattle had to be sold to purchase food for the other
half, and to meet the payment was simply impossible.
It was allowed to stand by adding the interest to the
principal.</p>

<p>The third year's crops were partially destroyed by a
severe hail-storm, and though things were not quite as
bad as they were the previous year, still the payment
could not be met, and again the interest was added to
the principal, making for the final payment due that
year the sum of nearly eight hundred dollars. Mrs.

<!-- page 243 -->

Gray wrote George that they could not possibly raise
it, and the place would have to be sold.</p>

<p>"Prices have so fallen," she said, "land as well as
everything else, that what we agreed to pay sixteen
hundred dollars for eight years ago, and on which we
have paid a thousand dollars of the principal, and four
hundred and fifty in interest, would not to-day bring at
forced sale more than a thousand dollars, and would
not be considered worth more than twelve hundred at
best. And, added to all this, your father is sick, and
I fear he never will recover, so please come home, for
he would like to see you once more, and I need you."</p>

<p>Of course George heeded the call. The first thing
he did was to show Mabel his mother's letter, and give
her a full account of the buying of the land. Hitherto
his mother's letters had been read only by himself, but
he now had one to share them. Mabel, when she
fully understood how matters were, said, "Do not go
for a few days, I want time to think."</p>

<p>He gave her a questioning look: "Not till you return,"
was her reply, and he acquiesced without a word,
while she added:</p>

<p>"I want to think about this land business. To-day
is Friday, write to your mother that you will start on
Monday. I shall have thought out the problem by
that time; in the meantime I want all the information
you can give about the country, the quality of the land,
etc."</p>

<p>This he gave and asked no questions, though he wondered
what she wanted to understand about it for.
The next morning Sarah Wilson came to her and
said:</p>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p>"Last week I went to another part of the city to
visit an old friend, one that I had not seen for a long
time. Her husband, Mr. Norton, is a carpenter, but
has been out of work for some time. About three
weeks ago her brother came there; he was about half
sick when he came, and nearly out of money. The next
day he was taken down so as to have to keep his bed.
Yesterday I went again. Mr. Baker is getting better,
but not able to be up but a part of the time, and with
Mr. Norton out of work and his sickness, it is making
it very hard for them. I wish you would go and see
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can go now; this afternoon I have
another engagement." So the carriage was brought
round and the visit was made.</p>

<p>Several times it had occurred to Mabel that while
she was helping girls, she was really placing them
where they had no associates of the opposite sex, for
they were being raised above their old associates and
not being brought in contact with any who could understand
their new ideas. The general class of young
men had been so educated that she could not approach
them, could not teach what true purity and genuine respect
for womanhood, for motherhood was, without the
liability of being misunderstood, if not insulted.</p>

<p>Now she had hoped that George could help on the
work by calling about him the young men, and so preparing
them, that they could meet with the girls and
discuss the subject in common; but his visit to Kansas
would defer this for a time, and Walter was not the
one to aid her. She found herself a good deal interested
in the sick man, Mr. Baker, and she fancied that Sarah

<!-- page 245 -->

was more so. She found that he was from the country,
understood farming, and would gladly go back to
country life, and that turned her thoughts to the Kansas
land.</p>

<p>She remembered the gift of M. Costin: "Poor fellow,
I wonder where he is," she said with a sigh, and
again she fell athinking. Finally she resolved to talk
with George about the plan that was slowly evolving
in her mind. When he came home in the evening she
said:</p>

<p>"George, I want you to help me plan. I have never
used half the interest, as yet, upon M. Costin's gift."
and she shuddered as she said interest. "I have felt
that I was not wise enough to use it to the best advantage.
I wanted to learn more of ways and means of
reaching the people, but it now seems to me that I
might invest a little of it in that land you was telling
me of, and thus save the cost of the sale, and, at the
same time, secure a place to which I could now and
then send a worthy family who are being crushed
here; what think you?"</p>

<p>"The question is a serious one, my dear. We all
feel an interest in individuals, and would save them if
possible; but how can we do the most, by scattering information
among the people at large, or by founding
schools and picking up here and there individuals that
we can educate to the work."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she said, "that we need both
methods. We want a general diffusion of knowledge,
and we want those who are prepared, who are in full
sympathy with us, to help diffuse such knowledge.
This must necessarily be a slow work at first, and as

<!-- page 246 -->

you and I have pledged our lives to it, let us make
haste slowly."</p>

<p>He sat silent for some minutes, as if weighing her
words: "What is it you propose to do?" he asked, at
length.</p>

<p>"I propose to find out, first, what you think of my
double line of work, Mr. Reticent," she said, playfully.</p>

<p>"I think you are right; we need more than one line
of advance, and by a decided move in the direction of
scattering the idea that our present system of society
must go, we might raise a breeze about our ears that
would put out our light."</p>

<p>"So you think we had better have several lights
burning before raising any too high? Just about what
I was thinking; but another thought comes to me here
that I will explain another time, and to carry that out
I must see that I do not defeat myself by using up my
capital too fast. I will now answer your question. I
was thinking of buying that land at the highest price
your mother names, twelve hundred dollars, and utilizing
it in my work."</p>

<p>"Are you sure," he asked, "that sympathy with my
father and mother in their trouble has nothing to do
with your decision?"</p>

<p>"And why may I not act from sympathy?" she said;
"is not sympathy a good thing?"</p>

<p>"Not unless held in abeyance to the judgment; if
you respond to every call upon your sympathy you
would soon find yourself a beggar&mdash;would need help
instead of being able to give it."</p>

<p>"Oh, George, I see now why it is that the rich often

<!-- page 247 -->

seem so hard-hearted. They have so many calls that
if they did not steel themselves to indifference everything
would be pulled from them."</p>

<p>"Yes, and those who are really the most tender are
so hurt at the sight of so much misery that they have
to harden themselves to bear it, even till they seem the
most unfeeling of all. They see no way to remedy the
evils that confront them on every side, so persistently
ignore them; but what I meant to ask in reference to
that land was, do you think you would buy it if it was
held by some one in whom you felt no personal interest?"</p>

<p>It was now Mabel's turn to be silent. Finally she
said: "I do not know as I should have thought of buying
it in the first place had it been someone else; but
now I have thought of it, I think I should, no matter
who it was."</p>

<p>"Well, we will say no more about it, and if you do
not see any cause to do differently, you can give me
the money on Monday, and if you do not, I shall feel
it is all right."</p>

<p>"I understand you, dear," she said; "you want me
to keep the purpose in view for which the money was
given, making that the first and controlling motive;
but I should like to have you go with me to-morrow
to see this young Baker. You are a man, and can
understand men better than I can. If he is worthy,
and he and Sarah are interested in each other, I
must help them to get a start. In helping Sarah I
shall help on the work; and she is like a sister to
me."</p>

<p>So on Sunday they drove around, and taking Sarah

<!-- page 248 -->

with them, went to Mr. Norton's. Sarah at first objected.
"They will think I am there all the time,"
she said.</p>

<p>"What if they do, I want you to go with us," said
Mabel, while George smiled to see the look of pleasure
with which she consented to Mabel's wishes.</p>

<p>It was for this that they wished her to go. Mabel
wanted George's judgment as well as her own as to
whether there was a mutual attraction, and if so to
encourage; or break up without seeming design, should
he prove unworthy. Mr. Baker was sitting up and
showed a decided improvement over the day before,
and the way his face lit up when he saw Sarah, decided
the matter with George and Mabel as to what
his feelings were.</p>

<p>George studied him closely, talked with his sister,
Mrs. Norton, and his impression was favorable. The
next morning, when he was about ready to start on his
Kansas trip, Mabel put the money into his hands to
purchase the place with, and said:</p>

<p>"When Mr. Baker is well enough to travel, I shall
send him to you if it will suit him."</p>

<p>"What next?" he asked, looking a little surprised.</p>

<p>"I may send his sister and husband with him; their
two beautiful children ought not to be brought up in
the midst of such surroundings as they are likely to
have. But no more now," she added, seeing another
question on his face.</p>

<p>So George Gray sped away toward his Kansas home,
and Mabel remained to think and plan. When she
first found Sarah Wilson in that terrible room, battling
to keep starvation from herself and mother, she was

<!-- page 249 -->

nineteen years of age, only one year older than herself,
consequently was now a little over twenty-one; and she
found, by a little adroit questioning of his sister, that
Edgar Baker was twenty-three past; so their ages harmonized
well.</p>

<p>Mabel's next move was to get the opinion of a competent
phrenologist as to the temperamental and phrenological
adaptation of the two, and to do so without
their suspecting what she was doing. She first called
upon the phrenologist and stated her object, and made
her appointment as to hours, being able to secure two
consecutive ones. She then went and got Sarah, and
took her there. When the examination was over, she
took her to a friend's house and asked her to wait a
while. Then she went directly for Baker, having previously
arranged to call and take him for a ride at that
hour.</p>

<p>When she came to the place she said: "Oh, here is
a phrenologist, suppose we go in and see what he has
to say, Mr. Baker?"</p>

<p>He could not well do otherwise than consent, and
when upon entering she said, "I have brought a
friend for an examination, and I want you to tell him
just what kind of a woman he needs for a wife," the
young man looked a little surprised, but took his seat,
thinking it a bit of pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I have a friend to call on, but I
will be back by the time you are through," and without
another word she was gone.</p>

<p>Just as the man was describing the woman that Mr.
Baker ought to have for a wife, Mabel came back with
Sarah.</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>"Why, here she is now," he said, looking first at
Sarah, and then at Baker.</p>

<p>The sweet confusion on her face and the glad light
in his eyes told the whole story. "Have you come to
have your head examined too?" he said, trying to appear
at his ease.</p>

<p>"I have had it examined already," she said, and
then they both turned their eyes upon Mabel. The
whole thing flashed over them, as they saw the demure
look on her face and the mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you plotter!" they both exclaimed, in the
same breath.</p>

<p>"You need not hesitate to sanction the union,"
said the man of science, "it is nature's own selection."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Raymond, for your plotting,"
said Baker, "otherwise I should not have dared to
speak, as I have only myself to offer her; but I can
work if I can get work to do."</p>

<p>"We will see about that," she replied, "and now I
am going to take you both home with me."</p>

<p>After tea they talked the Kansas matters over,
Mabel telling them something of her plans, and asking
them how they would like to go out there.</p>

<p>"If we only could," said Baker, looking at Sarah.</p>

<p>"Not while my mother lives," she replied, and then
starting to her feet, she said: "How selfish I have
been; she told me when I left she did not want me to
stay long; I must return immediately."</p>

<p>"We will all go," said Mabel, and the carriage was
again brought around. Just as they were about to
start, Sarah's nephew came with a message that grandma

<!-- page 251 -->

was very sick, and the poor girl was almost overcome
with grief to think that in the excitement of the
last few hours she had forgotten her mother's request.
When they reached the place, they saw that the poor
lady's hours were numbered. The hardships of other
days had nearly snapped life's cord, but with the kindness
of friends and needed comforts her days had been
so far prolonged.</p>

<p>Sarah threw herself upon her knees beside the bed
in an agony of grief, while her mother slowly raised
her hand and placed it upon the bowed head, at the
same time casting her eyes inquiringly around. Mabel
she knew, but who was the gentleman?</p>

<p>Mr. Baker saw the look and stepped forward, and
kneeling beside Sarah, said: "May I not call you
mother, too?"</p>

<p>Again the eyes were raised, and seeing approval in
Mabel's face, she placed her other hand upon his head
and murmured, "Heaven bless you both," and sinking
away, they thought she was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mother, look at me, speak to me once
more," cried Sarah, in agonizing tones. The lids unclosed,
the lips murmured, "My child," then a sweet
smile settled upon her features, and she ceased to
breathe.</p>

<p>About a week after the burial of Mrs. Wilson,
Mabel went to her father and asked: "What did Walter's
birthday party cost you, father?"</p>

<p>"About three hundred dollars, I believe."</p>

<p>"And had I been a society devotee, I should have
had at least two such parties before now, besides one
on my birthday?"</p>

<!-- page 252 -->

<p>"Yes, I presume so; but what are you driving at,
Puss?"</p>

<p>"There is about eight hundred dollars interest due
me, is there not?" she continued, without heeding his
raillery.</p>

<p>"A little over that, I believe, but you are not going
to take interest after listening to Miss Hibbard's story,
I hope?"</p>

<p>"Will those who hold my money do any better by
those they employ if I do not require interest?" she
asked; "if I knew they would, I might decide not to
take interest; but as it would only go into their own
pockets, I prefer to take and use it to help enlighten
the people."</p>

<p>"Whew, what sophistry! You would do evil that
good may come, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, evil to this present system of things,
that a good one may come in its place; and now Puss
will tell you what she is driving at. She wants some
money to use, so please give her the interest due and
what three parties would have cost."</p>

<p>With a bantering remark he turned to his desk and
filled out checks for eighteen hundred dollars; but
when she reached her hand to take it he put his hands
behind him and said:</p>

<p>"But I must know what you are going to do with so
much money?"</p>

<p>She stepped back, and putting her hands behind her,
she said: "Do I demand to know what you do with
your money?"</p>

<p>"But only a part of this is yours, unless I choose to
let you have it, little girl."</p>

<!-- page 253 -->

<p>"Granted, but papa, do you believe I will spend it
as foolishly as though used for the pleasure that fashionable
parties bring? But to please you I will explain."</p>

<p>She then told him of the land she had authorized
George to buy, of Sarah's engagement, and of her wish
to send both Mr. Baker and his sister's family out
there.</p>

<p>"Quixotic as ever," he said; "but where did you get
the money you gave to George?"</p>

<p>"Part of it was interest money that you paid me
some time ago, and part of it mother gave me."</p>

<p>"So you have not drawn upon your capital at all?"</p>

<p>"No, I first thought to fill out checks and have you
honor them, but when I told mother, she said she had
always intended I should have a part of the money
that came from grandfather; so she filled out checks
for eight hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well, so Do&ntilde;a Quixote has become a
landholder! I don't see but I must yield," said he, as
he placed the checks in her hand and kissed her cheek.
"But mind you, George must come back here; I cannot
consent to his taking you away, little one."</p>

<p>The next thing was to go to her room and think and
plan again. "Poor papa," she said to herself, "he
will have to do without me by and by, if I carry out
my plans; but not yet awhile."</p>

<p>The next evening was the regular one for meeting,
and Mr. Baker, his sister, and her husband were invited.
At Mabel's request, her mother made a few remarks
to explain the object of the meeting to the strangers.
Mr. Raymond had also consented to be present, to give
countenance to the bashful ones, he said; so there was

<!-- page 254 -->

Mr. Raymond, Walter, Mr. Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Norton,
Nellie Stone, Mary Greene, and Sarah Wilson;
the last three, with Mabel, were all that remained of
the original twelve; these with Mrs. Raymond, Miss
Hibbard, and a very intelligent, good girl who took
care of the rooms, making twelve in all.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton seemed surprised at the plainness of speech
in a mixed company upon what are called delicate matters,
but when Marion repeated what George had said at
their last meeting but one, to wit, that evil surroundings
poisoned life at its fountain, reached even the new
being nestling like a bird beneath the mother's heart,
Mrs. Norton looked at her husband, and the tears
started, while Edgar Baker turned toward Sarah with
an expression of reverence on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond saw it, and thought: "They are right;
such talk will make men's hearts pure if anything will."</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was profitably spent with
various remarks from Mabel and the others, and at its
close Mabel unfolded her plan of having Edgar and
Sarah, together with Mr. and Mrs. Norton and the
children, all going to Kansas together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norton sprang to her feet and grasped Mabel's
hand. "You are an angel," she said, and then burst
into a fit of almost hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>"Don't, Anna, don't cry so; daylight has come and
all will yet be well;" and then turning to the others, he
said, "I might as well be frank with you: Disappointment
and enforced idleness was beginning to fasten the
habit of drink upon me, and my poor girl was almost in
despair, but it's all right now&mdash;I will touch the stuff no
more."</p>

<!-- page 255 -->

<p>The tears came to Mabel's eyes, and turning to her
mother, she said: "Mamma, the spirit moved me to
this; surely the power of the unseen aids us."</p>

<p>"Thou art right, my child; the angels, the friends of
humanity, who have gone to that life, are aiding thee."</p>

<p>Things were getting too serious for Walter's comfort,
so he must needs make a diversion; throwing his head
back, closing his eyes, and giving a few spasmodic jerks,
he arose from his chair, and spreading his hands out
like one in the act of pronouncing a benediction, he
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, the spirits are with you; there are hosts of
friends here; be faithful, and you shall come to us by
and by; I am Martin Luther." And then, with a gasp
and a yawn, he awoke.</p>

<p>"Really," he said, "I did not know I was so good a
medium; did I give any tests?"</p>

<p>"Walter, Walter! is there anything you will not
make sport of?" said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"I think I must have a very beautiful name, mother,
you like to repeat it so well;" and then, as usual on
such occasions, he marched out of the room singing.
This time the words were:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p>"A little girl would be a farmer,<br/>

So she sends away her charmer,<br/>

To buy of land way over yonder,<br/>

To which of friends she'll be the sender.<br/>

Tra la, tra la, tra la.</p>

<p>"And there her friends will do the farming,<br/>

While she in city will be charming;<br/>

If she should find some other charmer,<br/>

Then Gray may stay and be the farmer.<br/>

Tra la, tra la, tra la."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 256 -->

<p>In the meantime, George, as soon as he reached home,
began to take steps to secure the farm for Mabel. By
paying the interest for the full time and the balance of
the principal in advance, he got hold of the papers
some months before the time that the money was due,
and when he had been gone a month, Mabel received
her title&mdash;was the owner of three hundred and twenty
acres of land.</p>

<p>"Can't you bring some of it here, Meb," said Walter,
"so we shan't be so crowded?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that Mahomet will have to go to the
mountain," she replied.</p>

<p>"What, go away out there to be eaten up by grasshoppers!
please excuse me, Miss&mdash;Mrs. Raymond Gray;
one victim ought to satisfy you."</p>

<p>"I have sent no one there," she said.</p>

<p>"No, but you're just agoing to; I expect it's to keep
the grasshoppers off from George, that you're sending
'em," he added, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>Within a week after she received her deed, the Nortons
and Edgar Baker, with his new-made wife, were
on their way to Kansas, and a happy party they were.
The children were delighted with what they could see
from the car windows, and heaven seemed to have come
to the so lately weary mother.</p>

<p>Sarah carried the balance of the money left after
buying the tickets and furnishing what was necessary
for the journey; and also a letter of instruction was
sent to George as to its disposal. I forget; Mabel
had given Sarah three hundred dollars for her own
personal use; that, too, came out of the eighteen hundred.</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>Two plots of land, twenty acres in each, were to be
selected. They were to be about one-fourth of a mile
apart, and on each a little house or cabin was to be
reared, of sufficient size to make them comfortable.
They were to have all they could raise upon the twenty
acres each, and to be paid for what they did on the rest
of the land, and other improvements to be made in accordance
with his judgment. A strict account of what
was expended on each twenty acres was to be kept, and
when they had paid it all back, together with the
cost of the land, it was to be theirs, but no interest
charged.</p>

<p>"And if you remain long," she added, "I think I
shall run down there myself. I should like to look at
my patrimony."</p>

<p>The man who owned the next section of land was
very much disappointed when he found that "old man
Gray's" land had gone into other hands, as he had
planned to bid it in for the debt and costs. He was
the only one about there who had the money, and he
had felt so sure of it; so he was disappointed, but everyone
else was glad.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray lingered month after month, full of bodily
pain, but with a mind clear and active. John and his
wife still lived with them, and they had three boys,
the youngest but a week old when George arrived.</p>

<p>"It was for them and those who may come after,
that I wanted that land, but it was not to be," said the
old man, sadly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, father," said George, "when you and
mother are done with it, they can have all of the
homestead, and if there should be half a dozen more,

<!-- page 258 -->

a little land well tilled is better than a large farm half
tilled."</p>

<p>"They can have all of it! Do you mean it?" asked
the old farmer, rising upon his elbow and looking
George full in the face.</p>

<p>"Certainly, father; I thought that was understood
when I left you and went to New York."</p>

<p>"You proposed to have the wages of a hired man
charged to your part, but I never intended it to be so,
and it isn't right; you must have your share."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it, father, I am more than satisfied.
I would not exchange what I have gained for a dozen
such farms."</p>

<p>James Gray lay back in his bed and closed his eyes,
and presently he said: "My best boy, after all, and
wisest, too."</p>

<p>He still continued to linger on, though the doctor said
there was no hope of his recovery, and he clung to
George so that it was impossible for him to leave, no
matter how much he might desire to return to Mabel.
He had told only his mother of his engagement, not
thinking it well to burden his father's mind with it,
but the old man felt that something was drawing his
boy's mind from him.</p>

<p>"What is it, my son, that gives you that absent
look," he asked; "is some pretty girl waiting for you?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, father, I shall not leave you," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"But I know I am holding you, when you want to
go," he persisted, looking earnestly into his son's face.</p>

<p>"You make me unhappy, father. I have no wish
to leave you, so please say no more about it."</p>

<!-- page 259 -->

<p>After that he was quiet, but he was not satisfied.
The company that came from New York George had
met at the depot, and provided for them elsewhere, not
wishing to excite his father's curiosity, for his mind
was altogether too active as it was. James Gray did
not even know who it was that had purchased the land.
He only knew that it was a friend of George's, and,
when the others came, that someone had been sent to
settle upon it.</p>

<p>"Tenantry: that is the way this country is going,"
he said, and did not refer to it again.</p>

<p>When George had been there nearly five months,
Mabel made good her threat of coming out there, but
she did not inform George, so took him by surprise.</p>

<p>"Who can that be?" thought Mrs. Gray, as a carriage
stopped before the door. George was reading to
his father, and did not notice the arrival. Mrs. Gray
went to the door to meet the lady who was advancing
down the path.</p>

<p>"Is this Mrs. Gray?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And I am Mabel Raymond," she said, reaching
up her face for a kiss.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my child," was the quick response, as she
was folded to that motherly breast.</p>

<p>George read on, all unconscious of who was so near.
Mabel was seated in the big rocking-chair and her
wraps laid aside, and then George was called. We are
not good at painting lovers' greetings, but, these over,
the next question was how to best break the news "to
father." Mrs. Gray took this task upon herself. She
went into the room.</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<p>"James, who do you think has come?" she said.</p>

<p>"How should I know. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"The woman who bought that land."</p>

<p>"The woman! I supposed it was a man."</p>

<p>"No, it is a woman, and a young woman at that."</p>

<p>"A young woman! bring her right in here, and
George with her; I smell a mouse." This was his favorite
way of saying, "I begin to suspect." Mrs.
Gray laughed, and called the parties.</p>

<p>George came in, leading Mabel by the hand.</p>

<p>"Mabel, my father; father, Miss Mabel Raymond,
my promised wife."</p>

<p>James Gray sprang up in bed, looked from one to
the other, and then stretched his arms toward Mabel.
She put herself within their clasp, and, kissing him,
said: "Father, I am sorry to find you sick," laying him
at the same time gently back upon his pillow.</p>

<p>For a little while he seemed quite exhausted, but
presently rallied, and lay looking at them with such an
expression of content upon his face as had not rested
there for many a day. At length he said:</p>

<p>"I can see now, George, why you do not care for
any part of the old farm."</p>

<p>"Is she not worth a dozen farms, father?" he asked,
turning his eyes fondly upon Mabel's face.</p>

<p>His father laughed: "Certainly, and especially as
you get a farm also."</p>

<p>"There is where you mistake, father," said Mabel.
"That land is mine, and it is dedicated to an entirely
different purpose. George gets none of it."</p>

<p>"But he gets you."</p>

<p>"And that is enough," said George.</p>

<!-- page 261 -->

<p>Mr. Gray seemed to rally after this, and for several
days was better, more free from pain, and then he began
to go down again. Still, his old restlessness was
gone and he appeared perfectly content when he could
have Mabel or George with him&mdash;both, when they could
be. There was but one request he had to make, and
that was to see George and Mabel married.</p>

<p>Mabel would have preferred to return home first,
but she could not refuse the wish of the dying man,
who clung to her with so much love and content; so
she wrote her mother the facts of the case, and one
day there was a quiet wedding by James Gray's bedside.</p>

<p>"It is enough, I am ready to go now," he said. He
lingered about a week longer, and then closed his eyes
as quietly as a child going to sleep.</p>

<p>George remained about a month after his father's
death, and helped to put things in good shape for his
mother and crippled brother. He made over in full
his claim to the place to John, and then he and Mabel
began to turn their thoughts homeward.</p>

<p>They both tried to persuade Mrs. Gray to go with
them, and spend a few months, at the least, but she
said:</p>

<p>"No, my children, my home is here, and my duties
are here. John and Margaret need me; you do not,
and I should feel out of place there; besides, I do not
wish to go so far from your father's grave."</p>

<p>There was a final gathering at the old place of the
Nortons, Sarah Baker and Edgar, and with the others
came the crank Professor Steadman, of whom we have
spoken in another chapter. Mabel had met him at

<!-- page 262 -->

Sarah's home, and was pleased with his intelligence
and his quaint ways, so she desired his presence with
the others.</p>

<p>Then there were the tearful good-bys, and away sped
the iron horse that bore the couple back to the great
metropolis.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch16">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">MONSIEUR COSTIN'S FATE.</p>

</div>

<p>AFTER their return, George and Mabel were
sitting on the front porch one evening,
and the question of what had become of
M. Costin was broached.</p>

<p>"It is now more than two years since
he left us, and never but that one letter; I wish I knew
what had become of him," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"It is strange that we hear nothing further," replied
George, "but I have supposed it was because he could
not get over his disappointment."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," she sighed, musingly; then, with
a smile, she added, "but I thought, for a time, I too
must continue to sigh in silence&mdash;I thought you never
would speak, and finally decided it was Nelly that you
preferred."</p>

<p>He gave a low, happy laugh: "How absurd; why did
not you speak before? I came as soon as you called,
dear. As to Nelly, I think Walter has an eye that way."</p>

<p>"What, for Nelly Stone? Well, she is a good girl,
but what will Mother Grundy say?"</p>

<p>"She will say that plebeian blood will show&mdash;that
it is the low, Quaker element in his wife that makes
Judge Raymond's children take to farmers' sons and
penniless girls."</p>

<!-- page 264 -->

<p>It was now Mabel's turn to laugh: "They need not
lay it all to mother," she said, "for father has good
sense, too; but who is that?"</p>

<p>A lady had entered the gate, and was coming slowly
up the walk. There was a something in her air
that inspired respect, and they both arose as she approached.</p>

<p>"Is this the home of Judge Raymond?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is, madam, and this is his daughter," said
George, turning toward Mabel.</p>

<p>The lady bowed: "Was a French gentleman, called
Costin, your teacher for a time, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gray," corrected Mabel; "yes, do you bring
us news of him?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could," she said. "But I think you must
have heard him speak of me; I am his mother's
cousin, the Myra who helped him away from those
who stole him when a babe. My name is Lenox."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mrs. Lenox, we are very glad to meet you;
please walk into the house, my mother must see you,"
and, leading the way to the parlor, Mabel insisted that
the stranger should remove her things and stay at least
that night, and then went to inform her mother.</p>

<p>"And you came to inquire about M. Costin," said
Mrs. Raymond, as soon as the introduction was over.</p>

<p>"I had hoped you could tell me something," she
said; "as I have heard nothing for over a year, I fear
something has befallen him."</p>

<p>"We have heard nothing since soon after he left,
over two years ago; Mr. Gray and I were speaking of
him just before you came, and wondering what had
become of him," said Mabel.</p>

<!-- page 265 -->

<p>"He went from here to England, as I presume you
know, taking his mother with him."</p>

<p>"What of his grandfather; I believe they were
together," interrupted Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes, they went together, but uncle took sick soon
after they reached England, and was not willing that
Paul should leave him. He lingered several months,
and after his death his mother clung to him so that he
did not reach France for more than a year later than
he had intended. He wrote her once after he crossed
the channel&mdash;told her not to be uneasy, even if she did
not hear from him, as he did not think it wise to put
too much of his affairs on paper."</p>

<p>"He always seemed to have a haunting fear of the
Jesuits," remarked George.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Walter, who had come in just before,
"I saw Father Bremen on the street one day, knew
him by hearing his name called, and I told M. Costin.
He said, 'Yes, I know he is here, but he does not
recognize me,' but I noticed that he stayed off the street
pretty well after that."</p>

<p>"So Father Bremen has been in this city," said Mrs.
Lenox, or Myra, as she is known to our readers.</p>

<p>"Yes, he called here the very evening M. Costin
left, gave his name as Brentwood, and said he had important
news for M. Costin."</p>

<p>"If Father Bremen saw M. Costin, he could not
help but recognize him, he is so like his father," said
Myra, "and I more than fear he has fallen a victim to
their cunning."</p>

<p>"Has his mother heard nothing since that first letter?"
asked Mabel.</p>

<!-- page 266 -->

<p>"Not a word, and I have seen him&mdash;I beg your pardon,
did he ever tell you of my peculiar gift inherited
from my Scottish ancestry?"</p>

<p>"It was through that that his mother found him, I
think," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"It was; well, I have seen him several times lately,
and though he says nothing, there always comes with
him the wish to visit you, but while my husband lived
I could not leave."</p>

<p>"It is all very strange," said George, "but I hope no
harm has befallen him. He was more than a good fellow;
he was a noble man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox leaned back in her chair and closed her
eyes, and as she seemed inclined to be silent, the others
were also. Presently the expression of her face
changed, and in a clear distinct voice, but with eyes
still closed, there came the words:</p>

<p>"As I told you years ago, friends, you will find the
Church your most formidable opponent."</p>

<p>"M. Costin's very words and tone," said George,
while there came a sort of startled, awed look upon
the faces of the others. Mabel, however, did not lose
her presence of mind, but going up to Mrs. Lenox, she
took her hand and asked: "My dear teacher, is it
you?"</p>

<p>The hand closed over her own: "But another is
dearer, I am glad you are happy;" then the other arm
was extended and she was drawn close to the woman's
breast. "I may hold you in my arms a moment now,
he will not deny me that;" then the arms relaxed, and
with the words, "I will come again," all was still.</p>

<p>The face resumed its natural expression, and soon

<!-- page 267 -->

Mrs. Lenox opened her eyes. She looked around in an
absent way, then, fully herself, she said:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, friends, I seem to have been
asleep; I scarcely slept at all last night, so please excuse
me."</p>

<p>"Have you known nothing of what you have been
saying?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Been saying?" she repeated, looking from one to
the other.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have been talking to us," and then she
was told what had been said.</p>

<p>"I have no recollection of saying a word, and I can
not understand it," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"Are you subject to such experiences?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"I never have been, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you never see anyone entranced, as it is called?"</p>

<p>"I never did; I have heard it said that spiritualist
speakers were entranced, and did not know what they
were saying, but I thought it only pretence, and as
Mr. Lenox was bitterly opposed to every such thing, I
have never been to any of their meetings, and did not
even tell him of my own peculiar gift."</p>

<p>"Well, you talked, sure enough, and in M. Costin's
voice&mdash;repeated things of which you could not have
known, and you must, if possible, remain with us for a
time. I want to investigate further," said Mrs. Raymond,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam, your request accords with my
feelings, for I am strangely at home here."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;but did you come directly from the cars
here?"</p>

<!-- page 268 -->

<p>"No, I drove to a hotel, and took a room and supper."</p>

<p>"I thought you might wish a cup of tea, but as you
have had supper, the company will excuse you and
I will show you your room; as, not having slept last
night, you must need rest."</p>

<p>She was put in the room M. Costin had occupied,
but without thought on Mrs. Raymond's part, till she
sank upon a chair with the same look she had previously
worn, and the words: "At home again."</p>

<p>She did not seem to know she had said anything,
but rousing up, remarked: "I am so sleepy, I can
hardly keep my senses."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond made no reply, but related the fact
when she returned to the parlor.</p>

<p>"There are more things in heaven and earth than
our philosophy has dreamed of," quoted George, in
commenting upon the events of the evening.</p>

<p>"Strange," said Mabel, "that Myra should come
just when we were talking of M. Costin."</p>

<p>"Did you never talk of him before?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, a great many times."</p>

<p>"Strange that somebody didn't come before," he
said, in that inimitable tone that always brought a
laugh.</p>

<p>"I have never had time to trouble my head about
spiritualism, nor have I thought it worthy of much attention,
but it may be well enough to look into the
subject a little," remarked George.</p>

<p>"Shall I secure for you the services of some noted
medium?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"No, I beg to be excused; I want to investigate

<!-- page 269 -->

with someone who has no moneyed interest in the
matter. The system of society that forces people to
adopt all sorts of expedients in order to get bread is
not the best calculated to develop integrity."</p>

<p>"The motive powers of society seem to be directed
against the good and in favor of evil," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"How is that, Meb?"</p>

<p>"If you were a woman, Walter, and had to choose
between a poor man that you loved and a rich man
that you did not love, I think you would understand."</p>

<p>"I don't see what that has to do with it."</p>

<p>"You are very stupid, brother mine, or very wilful;
the two strongest feelings in woman's nature are her
conjugal and her maternal love. In the illustration I
gave, she has those two feelings put right in conflict.
If she marries the poor man, who lacks only business
skill to make him all that can be wished&mdash;well, think
of tenement-house poverty for her children; but if she
marries the rich man, she has&mdash;oh, the thought is horrible&mdash;to
feel around her the arms of a man she does
not love. Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand as well as one can be expected
to who is not a woman, and who has had no experience.
Nothing like a plain explanation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">For the little god, Cupid, has grown so very bold,<br/>

He now tips his arrows with the finest of gold."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"It is finished," said George, referring to Walter's
poetical method of winding up a conversation.</p>

<p>The next evening they all assembled in the room occupied
by Mrs. Lenox, not only to avoid interruption,
but because, it having been M. Costin's room, it was

<!-- page 270 -->

thought possible that if it was he who had spoken
through her the night before, he might do so more
easily in what had been his own room for so long.
Mrs. Lenox had said but little during the day, and
they forbore questioning her, but when they were
seated in the evening, Mrs. Raymond asked:
"Did you see anything during the night, Mrs.
Lenox?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw a great deal, but I prefer not to speak
of it now; Mrs. Gray, will you please sing 'Auld Lang
Syne'?"</p>

<p>This was a favorite song of M. Costin's, and they
had often sung it together. The request brought tears
to Mabel's eyes, but she sang it through in a clear, firm
voice. When it was finished, Mrs. Lenox was sitting
in a listening attitude, but on her face a far-away look.
Soon there came a spasmodic jerk, and the words:</p>

<p>"Good-evening, friends; this is kind to meet me in
my old room. Thanks, Miss Mabel, for your song&mdash;yes,
I know, but you will always be Miss Mabel to
me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox had been purposely kept from knowing
that the room had been M. Costin's. Mrs. Raymond,
when she remembered it, said nothing, and had cautioned
the others when she went down-stairs, and then
had made the same request of the servants.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell us what this all means?" said
George.</p>

<p>"It means that I am beyond Father Bremen's reach
now, and much good may my money do the Church.
They had schemed for it too long to be foiled. I was
mistaken in believing that the arch-fiend did not recognize

<!-- page 271 -->

me when here, and they had a spy in the home of
my father's wife who picked everything out of them
pertaining to our agreement, and then watched till they
knew I had the money. It was an easy thing to finish
me then, and take it."</p>

<p>"Can they not be brought to justice?"</p>

<p>"They might possibly, but it would cost too much;
better work toward destroying all church power, root
and branch."</p>

<p>"Is spiritualism true?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Lenox, or the power controlling her, made
a very wry face. "Will you please tell us?" said
Mabel.</p>

<p>"That depends upon what you mean by spiritualism.
The fact that I am here proves that spirits can
communicate through what are called mediums, but a
large proportion of what is taught through mediums is
simply trash, or positively injurious, in that church
spirits over here seek to control the movement."</p>

<p>"Then spirits are not safe guides?"</p>

<p>"No more safe than mortals are, and it is not so
easy tracking them; but I am not here for the discussion
of spiritualism, and I must not hold Myra too
long. Please write to Madame Dumark, Auxile Place,
France, and ask if there was not a young man in her
home for more than a year before I came to settle the
estate business&mdash;a young man calling himself Jean
Rictor, and who disappeared soon after I left; take
the address down, please."</p>

<p>They did so. "Now, good-night." They could get
nothing more, and when Mrs. Lenox came to herself
and was shown the address, she was simply astonished.

<!-- page 272 -->

"But before you tell me anything more, I will tell you
what I saw last night," she said.</p>

<p>"I slept a while and then awoke in a condition that
may be described as very wide-awake. M. Costin, or
Paul, as I always call him, was standing at the foot of
my bed. He smiled and pointed to the east, and I saw
in the distance the inside of a residence. There were
three people in it, a woman and two young men, and
one of the young men was very much like Paul. I
turned to look at him, so as to compare them, when I
saw just in front of him, the words, 'My half-brother,
watch.'</p>

<p>"I looked again, and saw Paul there, saw money
paid him, saw him leave, saw the other young man
follow him, saw him struck down; then all was blank,
and I knew nothing more till morning."</p>

<p>"He must have been murdered," said Mrs. Raymond;
"when did you say you last heard from him?"</p>

<p>"Just after he landed in France, more than a year
ago."</p>

<p>"If upon writing we learn that it was as has been
stated about that young man, I shall be willing to investigate
this new ism," said George.</p>

<p>"It will do no harm to investigate whether we hear
from France or not," said Mabel. "If the psychic
power of those in this life can affect us for good or ill,
I do not see why it may not be continued after the
death of the body; but the trouble is, the masses of
those who accept this idea seem to depend upon
spirits and be guided by them. M. Costin was my
friend. I loved him as a teacher, and had great respect
for him as a man, but could I positively know

<!-- page 273 -->

what I am inclined to believe true, to wit, that he has
talked to us to-night, I should no more think of allowing
him to control my life than I did when he was here."</p>

<p>"There is another thought in connection with this
subject, that makes it worthy of investigation. If
those who are called dead really can make themselves
felt, and can control certain organizations, they can affect
the character of the child by their influence upon
the prospective mother," said Mrs. Raymond; "and
Mabel, the summer before thee camest to my arms, I
read the life of George Fox and I admired his character
very much, and I have thought that reading had
its effect upon thy character; but it may be true that
George Fox himself was present, thus giving thee that
devotion to humanity that has so far marked thy life,
dear."</p>

<p>"And the Quaker is here now," said Walter; "please
ask him if that is why she likes the name so well; not
exactly George Fox but George Gray&mdash;might make it
gray fox."</p>

<p>"Thou art profane in thy speech, young man. Sacred
subjects should not be thus handled," was the response.</p>

<p>"And that is just what the Christians say of their
Bible, Mr. Quaker, but I do not revere it, all the same."</p>

<p>"Thou art incorrigible, son of thy mother," was said,
in the same deep tone.</p>

<p>Walter straightened himself up to his full height.
"No insinuations against my mother," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox laughed: "It is Paul playing Quaker,"
she said, "but the first speaker was a Quaker, he
stands a little back."</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p>"Yes, and it was done to show thee how much
chance there is for deception, if there is a motive for
deceiving. Beware; investigate as if handling edge
tools, or poisons." Here Mrs. Raymond gave a start,
and then said: "Are we all going crazy? I know
what I said, but I did not seem to say it myself;" and
then she added, "it was Walter's mischief that changed
the influence."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox here remarked: "I once heard a very
ignorant but devoted Methodist say of her son, who
did not seem to me very bright, 'I know he'll be a
great man, for I was under the influence of the Lord's
spirit for months before his birth."</p>

<p>"Just the reason why his brain should be soft," said
George; "she fed him on namby pamby emotions, he
was as happy as a clam and thought as little; why
shouldn't his brain be clammy-like?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the same idea is expressed, that of ante-natal
influences, and if Jesus, the man they call Lord,
or the thought of him, could affect one child, the devotion
to spiritualism, the sitting in circles, and the
constant reaching out for development felt by so many,
must affect many children, and not always in the best
way."</p>

<p>"I see that this is one of the subjects that must be
understood, in order to perfect motherhood," said
Mabel.</p>

<p>"And the dangerous element in it is the idea of
submission to the unseen world, that has been inherited
from the churches," added Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"And the personal God idea is the source of that,"
continued George, "and I have come to the conclusion

<!-- page 275 -->

that those who worship such a God, no matter how
good they may be, or how earnest as reformers, are
really helping to chain humanity, instead of advancing
the cause of liberty; and whatever their work, if they
put God in the front, give such an ideal being the
credit of every advance step, such work cannot be on
the side of freedom, for it is chaining the race to a
throne."</p>

<p>"Our God shall lead us on," said Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what the temperance people sing, what
the moral reform people sing, and what the churches
sing; yet in every step of advance, it is they who lead
their God on."</p>

<p>"Then you do not believe in God, Mr. Gray," said
Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"I do not believe in one infinite personality, but I
believe there are gods many, and lords many in that
life, as well as kings many in this, men who have held
power here and want it there. The over-ruling, all
pervading life is so much beyond our conception, that
only ignorance will attempt it, and it seems to me to
be the height of folly to worship we know not what,
or that the infinite life-force ever recognizes such worship."</p>

<p>"To worship we know not what, Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if we knew what, if we in our ignorance could
comprehend, then where is your God? and if we cannot
comprehend, if we worship at all, we worship we
know not what, we pray to we know not what. If I
should telephone for someone to come to me from
some other part of the city, and did not know who I
wanted, anyone could come who pleased. So of this

<!-- page 276 -->

praying to we know not what, and any spirit who loves
power can come and fill us with a zeal that we call the
love of God in our hearts. Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I have often felt the same," said Mrs. Lenox, "but
did not know how to express myself; I am glad to find
one who has clear ideas on that question."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Mabel, "that such prayer is
worse than nonsense, it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"And does not the same law apply to those who are
always calling upon the 'dear spirits,' or sitting in circles
for the spirits to come, and welcoming any tramp
who happens to drop in and claims to be George Washington,
or some other notable; George Washington
Jones, with the Jones left off, and the son of some negro
washwoman, perhaps," said Walter, with more
earnestness than was usual to him.</p>

<p>"You are becoming eloquent, Walter," said his
mother, "and I think there is a great deal of truth in
what you say."</p>

<p>He had forgotten himself for a moment, and spoken
out in real earnest, but the next moment he looked so
abashed that they all laughed but Mrs. Lenox, and even
she could not restrain a smile. He could clothe his
feelings in nonsense and get along nicely under the
cover, but here he had actually dropped his mask.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lenox, we shall write that letter, and
I hope you will stay with us till we get a reply," said
Mrs. Raymond, changing the subject.</p>

<p>"That depends upon how long it takes, but I will remain
awhile," she replied; "but I am as well satisfied
now as I ever can be."</p>

<p>The letter was written, and a few weeks brought a

<!-- page 277 -->

reply confirming the communication in every particular.</p>

<p>A few days after the letter was sent, Mabel and Mrs.
Lenox were riding out, when suddenly Mrs. Lenox
grasped Mabel's arm and exclaimed, "Look," pointing
at the same time to a young man crossing the
street.</p>

<p>Mabel looked in the direction indicated: "Why, that
is Mr. Hapgood," she said; "I have known him ever
since I was a little girl. He is Dr. Hapgood's oldest
son."</p>

<p>"Are they Catholics?" asked Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"I really don't know what they are."</p>

<p>"Has he been here all the time?"</p>

<p>"No, he was travelling in Europe for two or three
years; has been back&mdash;let me think&mdash;yes, it is eleven
months."</p>

<p>"That accounts for it!"</p>

<p>"Accounts for what, Mrs. Lenox?"</p>

<p>"He is the very man I saw that night, the first night
I came, in that room in France, the one who followed
Paul."</p>

<p>"No, no! it cannot be!" exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox sank back unconscious, and the deep
voice said: "Yes, it is; the plot was concocted here;
his people are Jesuits; do not let him know he is suspected,
you will endanger yourselves; tell no one but
your mother and George."</p>

<p>"If they were watching for you in France, why did
Father Bremen call here under another name, just
after you left?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know; to try to learn when I was to

<!-- page 278 -->

leave, perhaps; but no more now, I have other work
to do."</p>

<p>When George was told of this he said: "Really, I
begin to believe the Bible."</p>

<p>"I do not see what this has to do with believing the
Bible," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Do we not read in Revelations of the beasts that
had eyes on all sides&mdash;'before and behind,' I believe
is the exact text; the beasts that praised God continually;
the Catholic church is one of God's beasts."</p>

<p>The letter received from Madame Dumark stated
that such a young man had been with them, had been
the bosom friend of her son, and had disappeared very
mysteriously; that she feared some mishap had befallen
him, and begged to know why they inquired. They
made no reply to this letter; they had learned all they
wished to know, and further correspondence did not
seem advisable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">METHODS OF WORK.</p>

</div>

<p>THE effect upon Mabel of the discovery
made the day she was out with Mrs.
Lenox, was intense. She had never realized
the immense sweep, the cool cunning,
the subtlety of the Catholic Church as then,
and when she remembered the words of M. Costin, to
wit, that the spirit of the Protestant Church was the
same in the central law of its life, she could hardly
restrain herself from crying out in agony.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the work she had chosen was
like trying to lift a chain of mountains from off millions
of children that were held down by their weight.
"Oh, George," she said, "the little children, the little
children, gestated from poisoned blood, and fed upon
adder's food&mdash;what can be done? what can be done?"
At night even, she would start from her sleep, and
reaching out her arms, would cry out: "Save, save the
children!"</p>

<p>Finally Mrs. Lenox said: "We must have some
settled plan of work, or she will break down utterly."</p>

<p>"And what would you propose?" asked George,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"We must meet and talk it over," she replied. "Say
nothing to Mrs. Gray of this special cause of her excitement.

<!-- page 280 -->

What we have received from Paul, coupled
with its confirmation in the letter from France, will be
sufficient basis for urging definite and cautious plans,
and we will have Mary Green and Nellie in the consultation."</p>

<p>"Why do you object to Walter's knowing of that
recognition on the street?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Raymond has not your caution, and
his indignation would give some sign by which they
would know that they were suspected."</p>

<p>"You may be right, madam," he said; "I think you
are; but Miss Hibbard, a friend of the family, will be
here in a day or so, and I would prefer to have only
mother, yourself, and Miss Hibbard, besides my wife
and I, present at the time. When our plans are once
formed, we can act from them, and inform others only
so far as is necessary in carrying them out."</p>

<p>"You would make a good Jesuit yourself, so far as
secrecy is concerned," she laughingly said; "but go
and tell Mrs. Gray; it will give her something to think
of, and we will have our talk as soon as convenient
after your friend comes. In the meantime, we will
think and plan, so as to compare notes when we come
together."</p>

<p>"If we knew more of their plans we could plan
better; I wish we had some reliable ex-Catholic priest
to help us," said George.</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't, unless Paul can help us by his
influence upon our minds, and we must not rely upon
anything of the kind; we must think for ourselves."</p>

<p>The next day Marion returned, but as she, too,
needed time to think, the facts were laid before her,

<!-- page 281 -->

and the next evening was appointed for the consultation.
Marion was a little inclined to laugh at what she
called the mediumship vagary, when Mrs. Raymond
began her story; but when she went on to tell of the
recognition on the street, the confirmation by Madame
Dumark of what Myra had seen clairvoyantly, coupled
with the fact that Hapgood was said to be travelling in
Europe at the time, the laugh gave place to rather a
sober look.</p>

<p>"Well, there may be something in it; it is no more
strange than what is told of Bible times," she said,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"These accounts not only abound in Bible history,
but in the history of all nations, Marion; every religion
has been founded upon such phenomena, ignorantly
accepted instead of intelligently investigated. Blind
rejection will not down them; ignorant acceptance empowers
the priesthood to enslave the people. The only
sensible course is intelligent, unprejudged investigation."</p>

<p>"Your theory is plausible, to say the least," replied
Marion; "but the world is so full of superstition, and
this subject takes such a hold upon those who commence
to investigate, that I confess I am afraid of it."</p>

<p>"Fear never probes falsehood to the bottom in a
search after truth; don't tell me you are a coward,"
laughed Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>The next evening the five assembled in Mabel's
room. The room occupied by Mrs. Lenox was proposed,
but Mabel said, "No, I do not want to be psychologized
by any foreign influence, and here I can
hold the fort myself," so they deferred to her wishes.</p>

<!-- page 282 -->

<p>She looked very pale as she sat back in her rocking-chair,
and all regarded her with looks of tenderness.
They were hardly seated before Walter rapped at the
door. "Let him come in," she said, and so he became
one of the party.</p>

<p>The first part of the conversation related to the subtlety
of the Church, and the utter impossibility of
securing the right conditions for motherhood while it
retained its present power. Once or twice someone
began a reference to Hapgood's case, then paused, and
turned to something else. Walter looked from one to
the other:</p>

<p>"You are keeping back something," he said.</p>

<p>"Tell him all," said Mrs. Lenox, in a tone that made
Walter start.</p>

<p>"And so you were afraid to trust me with this?"
he said.</p>

<p>"We only feared that you might inadvertently betray
the fact that he was suspected," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, you don't know me. I could be a vendetti
in killing rats," he said, with a look that startled them
all.</p>

<p>"Speaking of rats," said George, "reminds me that
secret undermining will accomplish what open warfare
cannot do."</p>

<p>"Countermining; our designs must be kept secret."
said Miss Hibbard. Mabel looked from one to another,
but as yet had said nothing. She now remarked:</p>

<p>"I dislike secret ways, paths that are winding; but
if we would dislodge rats, I suppose we must go into
the cellar."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox looked at Mabel for some moments, in

<!-- page 283 -->

silence. At length she said: "Mrs. Gray, feeling these
things as intensely as you do, you ought to travel."</p>

<p>"In what way could I benefit the cause by travelling,
Mrs. Lenox?"</p>

<p>"If you had some ostensible reason to give to the
public&mdash;failing health, for instance&mdash;and could spend a
month, two months, three, or more, as seemed best, in
a place, make acquaintances, scatter carefully prepared
printed matter, statistics, etc., much quiet work could
be done in that way."</p>

<p>Mabel's eyes began to brighten: "I see," she said,
"a broad field in that direction; but George should
have some business that would bring him in contact
with the people, and I could form classes and talk with
women, not the uppertendom, but the wives of mechanics,
artisans, etc.; but it needs money to do all
this."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said George, "but I can easily find
some business that will support us both; and you can
charge a small price for your lessons, sell books when
you can, and give them away when you choose; and
you could use the interest on your money to pay for
printing, purchasing books, etc."</p>

<p>Here Walter settled back and burst into a hearty
laugh, and Mrs. Lenox got up and went quickly to the
door&mdash;went quickly, but quietly. She stood there perhaps
half a minute, and then threw it wide open, confronting
the girl who had been doing chamber and
dining-room work for the last six months, and who was
known to be a regular attendant at the Methodist
church.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Nancy?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<!-- page 284 -->

<p>"I wish to go out a while, and wanted to ask if there
was anything to prevent."</p>

<p>"Not in the least; you can go just as well as not,
only come back in good time," she replied; while Mrs.
Lenox crossed the hall and went into her own room,
as though her opening the door just then was accidental.</p>

<p>"She shall be discharged," said Walter, as soon as
she had gone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox had returned immediately: "No, you
must not do that," she said; "keep her, treat her with
seeming confidence, but be watchful, and, while keeping
your own counsel, drop now and then a word that
will mislead."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she heard anything?" said Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"No, I think I felt her coming; I was at the door
first."</p>

<p>"Do you think, Mrs. Lenox, that one person can feel
another's mind?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss Hibbard, and not only the action
of another's mind but physical danger, that by its impending
cause changes the vibrations of the atmosphere.
I was reading, not long since, an essay upon
that very subject, and the writer said people who were
sensitive often moved just in time to save themselves
from being crushed by falling timbers, or some other
danger; and the superstitious called it an intervention
of Providence, or of spirits, when it was simply the
power of their own spirits to feel such subtle changes."</p>

<p>Walter by this time had forgotten his laugh, and was
looking as serious as any of them. Mabel resumed the

<!-- page 285 -->

subject of travel and self-support, and though Walter
tried to create a diversion by picturing the horrors of
Madam Grundy upon learning that Judge Raymond's
daughter was earning her bread, the effort fell flat even
upon himself.</p>

<p>"I am delighted with the plan," said Mabel, "for it
will give me a feeling of dignity that elegant idleness
could never impart; and as I have married a farmer's
son, why should I not work?" glancing playfully at
George.</p>

<p>"It is just the thing; she feels better already,"
thought he, as he made a retort of a similar nature.</p>

<p>"But what about books, printing, and matters of
that kind? A secret that is not suspected is the safest,
and if printed matter follows us from place to place,
our object may be discovered and impeded, where
otherwise it would not be," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Oh, that can be easily enough managed," said
George; "we can have them expressed in a way that
the contents of the packages will not be known, and
they can be sent from different points; your Kansas
colony can be made available."</p>

<p>Marion here interposed: "I cannot see," she said,
"the why of so much secrecy; others openly oppose
the present order of things, and why cannot we?"</p>

<p>"We can when the right time comes; but the crows
cannot pull up corn if they do not know where it is
planted; and if you frighten the fish beforehand, they
will not take the bait."</p>

<p>Marion laughed: "I can understand the crow parable,
sir, but that of the fish is not quite so clear."</p>

<p>"How many of the Church people, or of those who

<!-- page 286 -->

do not belong to, but are in sympathy with the Church,
would listen to us or read our books and pamphlets, if
we gave out our object in full, Miss Hibbard?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, but this sneaking way looks so cowardly;
and, besides, when the battle is won, those who have
been outspoken will get the credit, that is, if the battle
is ever won."</p>

<p>"Don't say <i>if</i>, Marion," said Mabel; "and were we
working for the credit, instead of the cause, your objection
would be valid; but, as it is, such reasoning has
no bearing on the question. Still, I do not undervalue
the bold, outspoken workers, for they will make such
work as we propose the more effectual."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"By engaging the attention of the enemy. Let the
Church, and those most interested in our present system
of robbery, called business, suppose that all attacks
upon them are open attacks, and our way is comparatively
clear."</p>

<p>"Well, sis, you are a reasoner," he replied.</p>

<p>"You are in the right, Mrs. Gray," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"And Miss Hibbard yields the point," laughed
Marion.</p>

<p>"The next point is the kind of literature to be circulated,"
said George.</p>

<p>"And the kind of lessons Mabel is to teach," said
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"I think that something must be prepared for the
purpose, mother; a course of lessons, first showing the
effect that the conditions of the mother have upon the
child; then, showing the things that stand in the way

<!-- page 287 -->

of perfect motherhood; and, lastly, suggesting the
thought that whatever it is that stands in the way
must be changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, that is just what is needed in your efforts
with women, only you want to so present your
subjects as to make them suggestive to the minds of
your hearers that the change&mdash;the revolution&mdash;must
come, rather than declare it directly."</p>

<p>"You mean, mother, that I shall manage to make
it seem to them that that thought comes from themselves;
thank you. But what about the printed lessons?"</p>

<p>"Something must be prepared for them, too, and
they must also be in such shape as will lead the reader
to his own conclusions."</p>

<p>"And who is to do all this writing, prepare all these
lessons?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"I expect you will help," replied Mabel; "and Mrs.
Lenox, here, and mamma, Walter, George, and I, will
do our part."</p>

<p>Just here Mrs. Lenox held up a warning finger.
She had remained near the door with one ear toward
it, from the time she had confronted Nancy in the
earlier part of the evening. She had previously covered
the keyhole, and now all were mute. Those
nearest the door caught the sound of a slow, cautious
footstep. It stopped opposite the door a moment, and
then passed on without any further attempt at concealment.</p>

<p>"That girl is certainly a spy," said Mrs. Lenox, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>Walter made an unintelligible sound that spoke of

<!-- page 288 -->

disgust and indignation. It drew the attention of all,
and they saw upon his face a conclusion of some kind,
but could not tell what. The next day he began chatting
very familiarly with Nancy, quietly complimented
her, teased her, and occupied her attention in various
ways.</p>

<p>The others noticed it, were somewhat surprised, but
said nothing. The next day he hardly spoke to her,
and the next took considerable notice of her. This
continued for several days, and, as Nancy was really a
pretty girl, it looked very much like a flirtation.</p>

<p>"Take care, or I shall tell Nellie," said George.</p>

<p>"What business is it of Nellie's?" he asked; but
his flushed face told that he felt an interest in his
sister's friend that he felt in no other lady.</p>

<p>A week had not passed before, in some unaccountable
way, Miss Nancy fell and broke her ankle. No,
Walter was not with her, but somehow the others
could not rid themselves of the feeling that he had in
some way brought it about. He had left her about
five minutes before, and just as she fell George heard
him call to her from the upper porch. He ran to her
when he heard the outcry, picked her up and carried
her to a lounge; but the look on his face was one of
triumph, instead of sympathy.</p>

<p>But Nancy watched no more at chamber-doors. As
soon as it was possible she was removed to her own
home, and she never returned. Mrs. Raymond bore
the expense occasioned by the accident, and the others
were equally kind. The girl suggested another to take
her place till she should be able to fill it again; but
Mrs. Raymond, Miss Hibbard, and Mabel divided her

<!-- page 289 -->

work between them, till they could send to Kansas, and
have Sarah Baker send them one on whom they could
rely; and from that time forth they were very cautious
as to whom they employed.</p>

<p>One thing more; they afterward learned that
Nancy's parents were Catholics, and that for some
time before coming to the Raymonds she had been at
work for the elder Hapgood's family.</p>

<p>"All this espionage has come about because of M.
Costin," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, I loved him as a brother," said George.</p>

<p>Walter said nothing, but there came that same dark
look over his face, as when he said he could be a perfect
vendetti in killing rats.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond watched this new development in her
son's character anxiously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>One day he said to her: "I wish I had Hapgood's
likeness. I do not like to be unjust to him, and if I
had his likeness I would send it to Mrs. Dumark, and
if she recognized it I should then feel satisfied that he
is really a Jesuit, and murdered M. Costin."</p>

<p>"As long as nothing can be done about it, I do not
see what good it would do," she replied.</p>

<p>"It would do me a good deal of good, and I mean to
have it," he said, and then again that swift look of
hatred and determination.</p>

<p>From then on, for several weeks, he seemed deeply
interested in photography, and was at times seen in
Hapgood's company; once he brought him home to
tea, telling his mother at noon that she need not be
surprised if he brought home company. When she
asked who, he only said, "Perhaps not any one."</p>

<!-- page 290 -->

<p>After tea they repaired to the parlor, and he managed
to get Hapgood and Mabel to looking over the
large album, and then he sat back and watched. Presently
Hapgood asked:</p>

<p>"Who is that fine-looking gentleman?"</p>

<p>"That," she replied, "is a likeness of our family
teacher; he was with us for several years, but has gone
to France now."</p>

<p>"You hear from him, I presume?"</p>

<p>"We have not heard very lately."</p>

<p>"Of whom are you speaking, Mabel?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Of M. Costin."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, did you never meet him, Mr. Hapgood?
He was an excellent teacher, but very peculiar; he never
said very much of himself, and had few correspondents.
We always thought he had some deep trouble
of some kind. I believe he did write once after he
left, but not since."</p>

<p>"I think I met him once, and that's why the face
seemed familiar," and then they turned over the leaf,
and no more was said about M. Costin; but Walter
had scrutinized every expression of countenance as
closely as a cat watches a mouse.</p>

<p>A few days afterward Walter came in with Hapgood's
likeness. "No matter how I got it," he said,
"so that I have it. Please, Mrs. Lenox, take this, go
to Philadelphia, and from there write a letter to Mrs.
Dumark, telling her what you have seen, who you are,
what M. Costin has said through you, and enclose
this. I will bear all the expense. Give a false name
in your address, and then return here, please."</p>

<!-- page 291 -->

<p>"And suppose I do not do all you mention," she
asked, smiling at his earnestness.</p>

<p>"Then please do what you please, so that the likeness
gets there."</p>

<p>She took the likeness, and said, "I will manage it."</p>

<p>The next morning she announced at the breakfast-table
that she was going to Newark, N. J., to spend a
few days; but instead she went to a little country town
some twenty miles beyond, and finding a photographer
she got several tintype copies of the likeness he had
given her; then, selecting the best one, wrote the letter
to Mrs. Dumark, and enclosing the tintype, mailed
the letter on the train while on her way back.</p>

<p>She requested Mrs. Dumark to mail her reply to
Boston, in care of a friend there, at the same time
writing to her friend to enclose any mail that came to
such a name in a letter to her at New York, "and I
will explain when I come," she said; "and be sure
you name it to no one." She then destroyed the likeness
Walter had given her, so that in no case it could
ever be traced to any of them. She had a strong suspicion
that he had stolen it from Hapgood's home, as
she knew he had been there.</p>

<p>In due time the reply came. "Yes, it was the very
man; where was he?" But there was no reply sent
back.</p>

<p>Mabel and Walter were busily preparing for their
work, Miss Hibbard and the others aiding as far as
they could. M. Costin came no more, or, if he did,
Mrs. Lenox never named it; but after the reply to her
letter containing the likeness, she told Mabel how she
had managed, and said: "I did as I felt I must."</p>

<!-- page 292 -->

<p>Walter and young Hapgood continued their intimacy,
and when his mother objected, he replied:</p>

<p>"I cannot break with him in a minute, mother; he
would suspect something."</p>

<p>One day, about a month after this, the two young
men went out in a small boat together, and by
some means the boat was upset. Walter reached the
land, but Hapgood was drowned. George noticed, soon
after Walter came home and changed his clothes, that
he put something in the stove and built a fire over it.</p>

<p>"I am chilly," he said; but George always believed
it to be a cork jacket that Walter burned, though he
never named it to anyone till years afterward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond, however, could not divest herself of
the feeling that Walter was in some way connected with
Hapgood's death, and she said as much one day to
Marion.</p>

<p>"I hope he did," was her reply. "There is no
question but he murdered M. Costin, and there was no
other way to reach him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond said no more then, but she afterward
told how bitterly she felt at one time, before Walter
was born, toward a man who abused a poor girl living
at his house. "I felt as if I would like to kill him,"
she said, "and I never felt so before nor since."</p>

<p>"And is it that feeling that you fear Walter has
lived out, Mary?" asked Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"It maybe, Marion; I have sometimes thought it
was."</p>

<p>Soon after this, Mabel and George started on their
mission of love, and for ten years they worked quietly,
continuously. The idea went abroad that Mrs. Gray

<!-- page 293 -->

was in delicate health and travel was considered necessary;
and so it was, but not as they understood it.
They made no blow, no pretentions, but were quietly
sowing seed for future harvests. Their acquaintance
inquired after them for a time, and then they were forgotten
by all except the personal friends who knew and
sympathized with their purpose.</p>

<p>Mabel during this time bore one child, a boy, but
he had not vitality enough to live. As she looked
upon its tiny form when arrayed for the grave, she
said:</p>

<p>"I have given the life of my son, my first-born, for
the world. In my earnestness to prepare the way for
coming generations I have used up the life-force that
should have been his."</p>

<p>They had investigated Spiritualism till they were
satisfied of continued life, so felt that their baby would
be cared for and unfolded in a higher condition of life
than he could have had here under existing conditions,
and they were content.</p>

<p>Yes, they accepted the facts of continued life and
the communication between those there and here, under
some conditions, but they never sought tests when
once so satisfied, for they believed that those who
were in sympathy with their work would come and
help them so far as they could, when it was best they
should do so&mdash;that they need no more teasing to do
this than the mother needs to be reminded of the
needs of her child.</p>

<p>Neither did they in any way recognize anything that
savored of a personal God, nor anything of what is
called Christian Spiritualism. Having satisfied themselves

<!-- page 294 -->

of another life, they let it rest there, and worked
for this life while here. That life would take care of
itself when it was reached.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel, "I have given my only son for
the world, but I have not worked up the lives of other
mothers' sons to gain wealth, and I am glad that I have
not."</p>

<p>At the end of ten years they returned to the old
home for rest, and to collate facts that they had gathered,
and illustrate the principles involved in book
form.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox and Miss Hibbard had also been at work,
each in their own way, but they had also been quiet
workers.</p>

<p>Walter had married Nellie Stone and remained with
his parents. Three bright children were theirs&mdash;Mabel,
George, and Marion. Mary Greene had married
and gone to the Kansas farm with her husband. Mabel
had continued her plan of settling those she thought
worthy upon the land there, holding the title herself
till they had paid her the actual cost of the land, and
whatever else had been furnished, and then using the
money to settle others in the same way, till now there
were ten families with twenty acres each, leaving one
hundred and twenty acres still unappropriated, and
that she resolved to hold, as she had the principal of
what M. Costin had given her, for some purpose in the
future.</p>

<p>The interest on M. Costin's gift had been used mostly
in adding to the effectiveness of their work while travelling.</p>

<p>Having now summed up, so far as is possible, the

<!-- page 295 -->

work done thus far, we will let them rest a few months
before tracing their further plans.</p>

<p>One more statement. "We can afford to rest
awhile," said George, "for I can count from fifteen to
twenty active workers of both sexes who have told us
that their first start came from something that Mabel
or I said to them, first-fruits, Mabel calls them, and
more of the crop to ripen."</p>

<p>Mabel looked smilingly into her husband's face as
she said: "It is not what we can afford, dear, but
what seems best."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would never rest if you could help it," he
replied.</p>

<p>"I enjoy my work, George, and only rest because I
must. The next life must be full of work, if it is
heaven to me, and I hope I shall not be subject to
weariness there."</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her lips, and sighed to
think how much of her life had already gone into her
work; and indeed she did look so ethereal, one could
almost fancy that she might vanish like a spirit.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">RESULTS AND NEW PLANS.</p>

</div>

<p>TWENTY-ONE years have passed since a
child asked 'why' upon the most important
question that can occupy human
thought. Yes, <span class="smcap">the most important</span>, for
no outreaching toward the unknown that
we designate as God, or what maybe our fate in another
life, can for a moment compare with the question
of human perfection here and now.</p>

<p>"If natural laws are unvarying, then, another existence
conceded, the same laws must hold good there as
here. All that tends toward the common centre of a
sphere must be down, and its opposite up, there as well
as here. Love must be sweet and hate bitter, harmony
heaven, and discord hell, two and two four, and eight
divided by four two, there as well as here, and all the
personal commands of all the personal Gods in the universe
can have no more effect upon these immutable,
axiomatic laws than did the command of the king to
the waves that they should not wet his royal feet."</p>

<p>Such were the words of George Gray, as addressed
to the friends assembled in Judge Raymond's parlor,
after the three months' rest taken at the close of ten
years of travel. During these years there had been a
remarkable growth of radical thought, many of the

<!-- page 297 -->

best workers in the country taking substantially the
same ground as did Mabel and George, some of whom
had been educated by them.</p>

<p>Several advanced thinkers, to whom they were personally
unknown, had been invited because of having
put themselves upon record before the public as earnest
radicals. Miss Hibbard and Mrs. Lenox were there,
with several ladies that they had interested. George
opened the meeting, as above, while Mabel sat beside
him with a look upon her face that seemed pleading
with those present for the knowledge of a more efficient
plan of work.</p>

<p>"Human perfection here and now," continued
George, "is the most important of all subjects, for
only in the expansion of the intellectual, moral, and
spiritual nature can happiness be found. It matters
not where we may be, whether in this life or the life
to come, we must possess the power of hearing and seeing,
or we cannot enjoy beautiful sights or harmonious
sounds: If our moral natures are undeveloped, if we
have no sense of justice, of right-doing one toward another,
then we can never enjoy society, for society
would have no use for us, even in heaven.</p>

<p>"But what are our spiritual faculties, it may be
asked, for though this part of our human heritage is
generally an accepted fact, yet there is no very clear
idea of what it is. 'It is goodness,' says one. 'It is
religion,' says another. 'It is devotion,' remarks a
third; while another says 'it is living above the world.'</p>

<p>"It is none of these. It is the capability that we
possess for abstract happiness, a happiness that does
not come from eating, drinking, and sleeping; it is the

<!-- page 298 -->

development of our finer selfhood in harmony with the
finer life of nature. It is that which can enjoy the
beautiful, the grand, the tender, sweet, harmonious currents
of life; it is that which can do this unconnected
with the idea of dollars and cents. It is the heart, the
aroma, the sweetness of life&mdash;the power to sense and
make it our own.</p>

<p>"Such an unfoldment here for all, coupled with the
intellectual power, or wisdom to adapt external conditions
to such unfolded selfhood will give us heaven
here, and without it there is, there can be, no true
happiness anywhere. A clod of earth can sense no
happiness, and the more stupid, the more like clods we
are, the less the happiness possible to us.</p>

<p>"But the naturally appointed way to unfold the race
in these finer forces&mdash;capabilities&mdash;is through the law
of motherhood. Take a common grub and feed it upon
the right food and it becomes a queen-bee. Surround
the mothers with that which is sweet, beautiful, tender,
strong, and noble; call out the best in her nature, and
the birdling nestling beneath her heart is fed upon that
which will make it a king or a queen in its own right;
but subject the mother to coarse surroundings, to brutal
sights and sounds, to overwork and privation, and that
birdling comes forth a bat; a stupid, blind, weak, or
brutal creature.</p>

<p>"Then our work as humanitarians, as lovers of our
race, is all summed up in these words: To find and remove
all that stands in the way of the best motherhood.
Weigh the words well, and let not the greatness of the
work appal you: 'To find and remove all that stands in
the way of the best motherhood.' No interest in any

<!-- page 299 -->

other life can possibly compare with this; it involves the
unfolding, the fair proportions, the strength, the power
of the soul itself. Now what are the things that stand
in woman's way, and what the best methods of removing
them?"</p>

<p>A young man, by the name of Brisko, who had not
been long in the work, arose and said: "Friends, I
hope you will not think me presuming, but it seems to
me that no more worthy cause has ever demanded the
attention of thinking men and women, and that each
and every one of us should be instant in season and out
of season in showing our colors and propagating our
ideas."</p>

<p>"Pardon me for the thought," said Mrs. Lenox,
"but will not seed planted out of season require too
much nursing?"</p>

<p>"I only quoted a Scripture phrase, madam, and it
seems to me the growth of the Church ought to show
the wisdom of the course."</p>

<p>"The Church never made any great headway till it
allied itself with the ruling power, and for us to do this
would be our defeat. Our work lies across the path of
the ruling powers of the world; we must oppose their
combined forces and never recede an inch," said
George.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe in open warfare, Mr. Gray; no covering
up for me. Your way may be the best, as I
understand that you have been quietly at work for ten
years, and yet I have never heard your name in connection
with any of the reforms of the day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Mr. Brisko; but will you please tell
me how you first came to think upon these questions?"</p>

<!-- page 300 -->

<p>"It was from reading this little book, sir. A friend
gave it to me, said it had been sent to him by some
one; that there were many good things in it, but he
could not quite endorse it all. Well, sir, I was delighted
with it; I endorse it all, and I have talked to
every one who would listen, and it has been read by
several. I wouldn't part with it for anything. Would
you like to look at it?" George took the book, glanced
at it, and handed it to Mabel. "I am sure you will
like it, and I will lend it to you for a few days; I
would give anything to see the writer."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said George, "I have read it."</p>

<p>"If you knew the writers as well as I do, you might
feel differently," said Walter.</p>

<p>"And you have read it, Mr. Gray! and you know
who wrote it, Mr. Raymond!" said Brisko, looking
from one to the other as though he could not understand
how they could be so cool about it.</p>

<p>George stooped down and whispered to Walter's little
Mabel, and she left the room. "Yes, Mr. Brisko,
I have read it," he said, "and like the ideas very much;
but think with more experience the writers might express
them better, more forcibly."</p>

<p>"I cannot see how they could be better expressed,"
said Brisko, looking somewhat crestfallen to hear his
favorite book criticised.</p>

<p>Little Mabel now came back, bringing with her two
books of the same kind. "Give them to auntie," said
George, glancing at his wife and then at the gentleman.
Mabel took them, and turning to Mr. Brisko,
she said:</p>

<p>"Allow me, sir, to present you these, with thanks

<!-- page 301 -->

for your high appreciation of my husband's and my
own work. I know you will make good use of them."</p>

<p>"Who! what! You don't say you wrote the book?"
exclaimed the astonished man, as he sank abashed into
his seat.</p>

<p>"It is our joint work, sir, and we have sold and
distributed over two thousand of them. I hope none
have fallen into worse hands than your own, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I never," was all the reply the man could
make.</p>

<p>George turned to the company and said: "I appreciate
the gentleman's feeling. Open and direct warfare
would be much more congenial to my feelings; but
we decided, Mrs. Gray and I, that wisdom was in this
case the better part of valor, that rats might undermine
a building that cannon could not blow down, and
we were willing to follow the lesson of the rats and
work out of sight, and right glad are we to find skirmishers
in front attracting attention from the undermining.</p>

<p>"We never paid a newspaper a dollar for advertising
us, never scattered circulars on the street, but went
quietly at work with the well-to-do class of people.
Mrs. Gray has gone to the minister's wife and interested
her in physiological facts belonging to motherhood,
has listened to their prayers and Bible-reading,
and has adroitly turned their own weapons into tools
to help further our cause. We have taught them certain
truths with a shade of difference in the application,
thus leaving room for bigger wedges.</p>

<p>"We never gave out very radical books personally,
unless to known radicals, but quietly took the names

<!-- page 302 -->

of such as we felt were ready to read, and mailed them
our strong works, they not knowing from whence they
came. Books of less pronounced character we sold.
Thus we never aroused opposition; no warning words
were sent after us as we went from one place to another,
and we have thus made ourselves acquainted
with much that we could not otherwise have reached,
which will be of use to us in the future.</p>

<p>"One thought more. We never followed the command
or example of Jesus, by going into the highways
and byways to gather up the wrecks of a false
system, and we never associated with publicans or harlots.
It may be Christian work to save them, if they
can be saved to this life, but it is not wise in those
who contemplate building anew to waste time in trying
to cement the rotten fibres of the old. As individuals
we pity them, but still must leave them to
mother nature to work over in her own laboratory, while
we deal with the causes which have made such wrecks.</p>

<p>"We do not mean to say that we ever treated them
unkindly, or with contempt, but we never tried to work
them over into sound timber. Neither do we claim
that the quiet way in which we have worked is the
way that all should work. We know it is not. Some
can do their best work only when opposed."</p>

<p>"Then it is the righteous, and not the sinner, that
you would reach," said one.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to answer that question so as
to be understood; perhaps a comparison will help me.
Would you spend your time with the wounded and
helpless if you were recruiting soldiers to meet an
enemy?"</p>

<!-- page 303 -->

<p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, that is what we are doing. We are recruiting
the comparatively sound, mentally and morally&mdash;educating
them and ourselves to fight the greatest battle
the world has ever known, and we cannot afford to
spend our time on the mentally and morally diseased.
Our work does not consist in trying to save the wrecked,
but in preparing to destroy the wreckers; am I understood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Gray, I understand what you mean; but
is the case really so desperate that we may not care for
the wounded while fighting the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Those who have been forced down among the
wrecks, but are not yet crushed, may be rescued to
advantage if it can be done without detracting from
the main work."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray," said another, "your position is correct,
and in a physical warfare the principle can be readily
seen; but when it comes to a conflict of ideas the reasoning
is not so apparent. If I understand you rightly
you would not try to save a man who had inherited a
love for liquor, unless you could put him where he
could not get it, this not as a punishment but as the
only method of cure, and so of all other forms of vice."</p>

<p>"Something like that, under our present system; but
under a new and correct system the healthy moral
atmosphere would cure such diseased conditions with
little or no restraint. Perhaps, however, a few facts
from real life will better show the folly of trying to
save the wrecked while the wreckers are still at work,
also the folly of allowing any man, or set of men, to
control public necessities because they have the money

<!-- page 304 -->

to purchase, and the law of property permits one to do
what he pleases with his own."</p>

<p>"Are property rights to be interfered with?" asked
another.</p>

<p>"You shall judge for yourself, sir. During the
great wheat corner of 1879 a company of men got
control of some sixty million bushels of wheat. This
attempt to rob the people through the power of money
was headed by a man of this city, and during the winter
four hundred vessels lay in our harbor for months
begging for cargoes. Hungry children in other lands
as well as in our own country were crying for bread,
but those men held the wheat till they could get their
own price, utterly regardless of the suffering caused.
Suppose, sir, that our government should send out
word that every man, woman, and child in the country
should give fifty cents each, to some one man, and
should attempt to enforce the order, what would you
think?"</p>

<p>"What would I think! I would call upon every
man in the country to arm and resist."</p>

<p>"That was what was done in that case through the
law of property rights. Those men first ran down the
price of wheat by the means of a systematic effort,
using the press to circulate their lies; then they bought
it up, and would not sell till they got fifty-one and a
half cents per bushel more than they paid. The cent
and a half would pay the cost of handling, thus leaving
a clear gain of thirty million dollars, taken from
sixty million people."</p>

<p>"But what had government to do with that?"</p>

<p>"It stood back and looked on, and, had the hungry

<!-- page 305 -->

people attempted to take one bushel of that grain, its
guns would have been turned against them. They
would have been shot down like dogs."</p>

<p>"Of course, the law must be sustained."</p>

<p>"To hell with such laws, and with the governments
that uphold them," said Walter, rising to his feet, and
then sitting quickly down again, because there was not
room for back and forth locomotion.</p>

<p>"My son, you forget."</p>

<p>"No, mother, I do not forget; but when a man is
more than full he must have vent or burst, and that
wouldn't be pleasant here," he added, looking around
upon the company with his old-time drollery.</p>

<p>This created a general laugh, and gave Walter relief.
Then George continued:</p>

<p>"One of the oldest members of the Produce Exchange
prepared for the Legislature an estimate showing
that that company of men, by not selling, by not
allowing others to sell, by the injury done to the milling
and shipping interest, and from results in various
other ways, caused a loss to the country of not less than
three hundred million dollars&mdash;five dollars to every
man, woman, and child&mdash;destroyed in order that a company
of men may get fifty cents out of each; and the
government permits, sustains it, because property rights
must not be meddled with.</p>

<p>"But this estimate of the cost only contemplates
business losses; we who have been looking beneath the
surface have another view to present; the cost in human
wrecks, the cost in manufactured criminals, the
cost in children born damned&mdash;in mothers' hearts
broken&mdash;of women driven to prostitution and men to

<!-- page 306 -->

desperation&mdash;this cost flowing down the stream of time
and embittering life in all its channels.</p>

<p>"Statistics show, as gathered by Dr. Farr, that in
England, when the price of wheat rises even less than
it was forced up by those natural productions of our
present system of society, robber-fiends, that the death-rate
is increased three per cent. Allowing for the different
conditions here, and calling the increase one-half
per cent., and we have three hundred thousand deaths
as the result. What killed them? Unlimited property
rights.</p>

<p>"How many women were forced into prostitution to
save their children from starving? What did it? Unlimited
property rights. Well, you can carry out the
idea for yourselves, and ask and answer the question if
the united efforts of all Christendom, taking their Sunday
meetings, their denominational schools, their missionary
efforts, their charities, and the efforts of individuals,
all combined, have saved as many in five years
as were destroyed by this single agency in one, to say
nothing of all the other grinding machines extant."</p>

<p>"The following lines, written by an ex-lunatic, contain
the keenest sarcasm upon church methods of saving
the world of anything I have ever seen," said Miss
Hibbard:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Oh, ye paid and trusted leaders,<br/>

Listen while you hold your breath&mdash;<br/>

In this land of Bible readers,<br/>

Wives and mothers <i>starve to death</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Walter drew a long breath; "Well, folkses, God,
the church, and the government say we must have law

<!-- page 307 -->

and order, that property rights must be respected; and
what are we going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"We will leave God out of the question as an unknown
quantity, and turn our attention to the other
two," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"And what guns shall we use?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Masked batteries, till a breach is made in the
walls; paper guns, in the form of books, do good execution."</p>

<p>"And that brings me to a plan that Mrs. Gray and
myself have been thinking of. During our years of
travel we have taken thousands of names&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just here an aged lady who had come with one of
the parties, and of whom but little was known but
that she was intelligent, poor, and had suffered, arose
and said: "Pardon me, please, for the interruption,
but I would like to say a word about the wrecks of
society."</p>

<p>"We will listen with pleasure, Mrs. Proctor," replied
George, bowing respectfully.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment: "I hardly know how to
commence," she said, "but I felt that I must speak. I
was left motherless at fifteen; was untaught in all that
it was most vital for me to know. We were very poor,
and my father worked very hard to support us. Presently
he took another wife, and I, to escape from my
wretched home, married a comparative stranger, and
became a mother before I was eighteen. I learned,
when my boy was nearly two years old, that his father
had another living wife, and I took my child and left
him.</p>

<p>"Gerald Massey says of those who reject the prevailing

<!-- page 308 -->

idea of hell and the devil: 'Ours is the devil
of heredity;' and it has proved both hell and the devil
to me. I can say, truthfully, that I came of an honest
family. The idea of crime as connected with any of
them was unknown. His father was not a thief, but
the fact that he deceived me, making me believe he
was a widower, is proof that he was not morally honest;
but the curse of crime, as I afterward learned, was in
that family, and though born of honest blood on his
mother's side of the house, and taken away from his
father before he was old enough to remember him,
my son, in spite of all that I could do, has grown up a
criminal." Here she broke down and sobbed aloud,
and there was not a dry eye in the room as those present
saw the convulsive anguish that shook her frail
form.</p>

<p>As soon as she could command herself she resumed:
"He came out of prison, and I thought that after that
terrible experience he would do better if he could have
a chance, so I risked the few hundreds I had saved and
tried to help him&mdash;this for his sake, and for his wife
and children. He robbed me of it all, left his family
and fled, and to-day I do not know where he is, and I
am left to toil for my daily bread, while the keenest of
sorrow embitters my life."</p>

<p>Again she choked, but forced herself to continue:
"But this infliction upon your sensibilities is uncalled
for unless a lesson can be learned from it; the point
I wish to reach is this: Had I known of the danger I
could have prevented the result, even after conception,
for my natural dislike for dishonesty and untruthfulness
would have been aroused for that purpose; but as

<!-- page 309 -->

it was, I had not the least idea that I had any power to
affect my child either way.</p>

<p>"Still my nature has so far prevailed in him that his
life has been one long conflict with himself. For years
he would so conduct himself that he would have the
confidence of all who knew him, then he would commence
being restless, and it seemed as if he could not
stop till he had spoiled it all. I did not give him up
till he was over forty years of age, and, at times, my
agony has been so great that I have cursed the hour he
was conceived and the day in which he was born," and,
shaking in every limb, the wretched mother staggered
from the room.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Lenox, "I must add my testimony&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the side of the Lord, as the Methodists say,"
interrupted Walter, dashing away a tear, but relieving
the intense feeling that pervaded the room.</p>

<p>Without noting the interruption, she continued: "I
have a letter from which I will read an extract, promising
that the lady who wrote it is very sympathetic and
has been wont to accuse me of cruelty because I have
refused to spend time in trying to save individual
wrecks. She says:</p>

<p>" 'You remember the woman I took in last winter,
the one who told so pitiful a tale of the way she had
been crushed, and how glad she would be to reform if
she had a chance.' By the way, my friend is a poor
woman and depends upon her son for support. She
says:</p>

<p>" 'I kept her with me four months, and she was so
winning, so sweet, that I learned to love her very much.

<!-- page 310 -->

She was sick a good deal, and I took care of her. Finally
she grew very angry at some trifling thing, and so
abused me that I sent her away, and I then learned
that the change in her treatment of me came from a
feeling of anger because she could not seduce my son,
and she has since annoyed us in many ways; and her
known character, with the fact that she was with us so
long, has injured us very much in the eyes of those who
do not know the facts. Myra, you are right; I am
done trying to save society's wrecks."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Lenox," said George, when she
had finished, "I am very glad to have these results of
personal experience. If, as in Mrs. Proctor's case, even
a mother has to give up in despair, of what use is it for
others to try? Moral hospitals should be established
for such, where kind treatment and restraint go hand
in hand, but we who work to destroy the causes which
produce such results have no time nor means to establish
such."</p>

<p>"And no power to hold them there if we had," said
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"And of what use would such wrecks be to our
cause, even if seemingly heart and soul with us, and, I
may add, really in feeling, for it is but a feeling. They
are swayed by the emotions, have no fixed principle, and
we could never trust them, should not know at what
moment they would cover us with disgrace," remarked
Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"I am glad of what has been said," continued
George, "but it is growing late, and with your permission
I will now present the plan of which my wife and
I have been thinking. We have, as I said, taken a

<!-- page 311 -->

great many names during our ten years' travel, and
now we want to utilize them. Mrs. Gray has held ten
thousand dollars for over twelve years, in trust, for this
work, feeling all the time that the principal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has been on interest, then?" remarked Mr.
Brisko.</p>

<p>Here was another criticism to be met, as the man
had previously declared that interest must go, and his
tone was one of blame.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a portion of that interest has been used
to help sow the seed which will eventually destroy the
system which allows interest, and another portion has
been used to purchase country homes for poor but
worthy people, giving them time to pay back the original
cost, but without interest, and she has now ten families
who have been thus settled; any one of them would
lay down their very lives for this cause if the occasion
required it. Besides, there are thirty children being
prepared for future work, and not an unsound timber
among them; pretty good use, I think, she has made
of her means."</p>

<p>Several expressed warm approval, and our critic said
no more.</p>

<p>"But now the time has come, as I was saying, that
she feels we can use the principal to good advantage,
and as much more as we can get. She proposes to
write a story in which the principles we advocate, and
the importance of true motherhood, shall be illustrated
from life, and that which stands in the way shall be
shown as vividly as possible. This book we shall publish;
also an appeal to mothers. We shall take a
summary of the book and the appeal, use them as circulars,

<!-- page 312 -->

and mail one to all the names we have, and get
as many more as we can. We must print at least a
hundred thousand of these circulars."</p>

<p>"To mail that number of circulars separately will
cost a thousand dollars in postage-stamps," said Walter,
"to say nothing of the cost of paper, printing, envelopes
and labor of mailing. I think your ten thousand
will soon be gone."</p>

<p>"We hope some of you will try to aid us," continued
George, "for we ought to send out an appeal to
every thinking woman in the country."</p>

<p>"That would not need very many, I fear," persisted
Walter.</p>

<p>"More, perhaps, than you think, my son," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"If I should judge by the quality of the ladies present,
I should say there were millions," he gallantly responded,
letting his eyes rove around the room, and
then rest lovingly upon his wife.</p>

<p>"Mothers can feel, if they have not been taught to
think," said Mabel; "and if we once get them aroused,
something will be done."</p>

<p>"We hope," continued George, "to make large sales
of the book, and in this way to make our money last the
longer; but there are many ways in which money must
be used, if we make the book do its best work, and
reach the greatest number. 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' gave
Southern slavery its death-blow, but that work, compared
with what must be done before woman can be free to
realize the best motherhood, is like a drop of water to a
bucketful. A million of circulars ought to be scattered,
and thousands spent in having the book advertised."</p>

<!-- page 313 -->

<p>"The million of circulars would use up your ten
thousand dollars, Mabel," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"I will write a glowing advertisement for nothing,"
said Walter.</p>

<p>"You?" said Nellie.</p>

<p>"Yes, me, little wife, and I will pay for having it
inserted in some leading paper."</p>

<p>"As editorial?" asked Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"Yes, if anything short of a fortune will induce the
editor to father it; but perhaps you think I cannot
write; I will show you. It will be the blossoming
hour of my ability, the occasion that calls my genius
forth."</p>

<p>"You have only anticipated me, Walter, in what I
was going to say; the leading papers of the country
must be paid, some of them to abuse, and some to
praise; abuse will bring a book into notice as quickly
as will praise," resumed George.</p>

<p>"Novels and hypocrisy," muttered our critic to himself,
but louder than he had intended.</p>

<p>"All's fair in love and war," said Walter.</p>

<p>"Our friend does not see this just as we do, but he
means all right," said Mabel, gently.</p>

<p>"The next question before the house is: Do you approve
our plan?" asked George, appealing to those
present.</p>

<p>All responded favorably but one, and he said
nothing.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Walter, as soon as the meeting
was over, going up and grasping his hand. "You are
right in not sanctioning what you do not approve.
You are sound to the core, and all that is needed is to

<!-- page 314 -->

get over your scruples against fighting fire with fire, as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes," added George, "we must match both
strength and cunning, and when an enemy is so powerful,
we must turn their own weapons against them
when we can. Nature gives us this right; still, we
prefer open, straightforward methods when they can
be applied; but when they cannot, then we must do as
we can. And yet it is hard for such natures as yours
and mine, to feel that we must handle such weapons."</p>

<p>"I will use them if I must," replied Brisko, "but
my mother used to warn me against novels, but I can
see that such works can be made useful; then those
methods of advertising&mdash;well, we will do the best we
can, and you can count on me for hard work with my
face to the foe. Good night."</p>

<p>"He will know more when he has worked a few
more years," was George's comment.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">ECONOMY&mdash;DISAPPOINTMENT.</p>

</div>

<p>FOR several months after the meeting recorded
in the last chapter, George Gray
worked in the Judge's office days, and
talked and read with his wife evenings,
studying the plot of the book they proposed
to write. What should be put in and what left
out, was the question, for the material going to prove
the utter failure of the present order of things to furnish
the conditions required for perfect motherhood
were so abundant, the wonder was that they had not
been gathered up and applied before.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," said Mabel, "that mothers,
with all these facts before them, have been silent
so long."</p>

<p>"It is hereditary," replied George, "the result of
ages of false teaching organized into the very selfhood
of woman. Mothers have been taught for centuries
that children are, must be, born in sin and shapen in
iniquity; they became psychologized with the idea.
You remember that the psychologist made the man
believe the cane was a horse. It would have had no
effect upon him had every person in the audience disputed
the statement, so long as the psychologist held
control; and so of the psychology of an idea."</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"And the words of M. Costin, 'the church is the
greatest obstacle across your path,' are again proved
true," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, wife, and the very virtues so sedulously inculcated
by the priesthood, and by the wealthy classes,
would, if carried out, produce greater ruin than war
and pestilence combined."</p>

<p>"The very virtues?" she repeated, looking up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we will call Mrs. Lenox and Miss Hibbard,
for I think they will appreciate the illustration
I have to give."</p>

<p>"Yes, we must make good use of their stay, for
they are quick to perceive and good counsellors, and
the work of putting into attractive form the truths I
wish to impress upon the people is so great that I want
all the help I can get."</p>

<p>"When do they leave?"</p>

<p>"Next week; they will do good work going together
as they have planned&mdash;but here they come; I think
they are easily called when our thoughts can bring
them," she said.</p>

<p>"Thanks for saving us the trouble, we were just going
to send for you. I am going to strip a counterfeit
of its disguise, and I want you to see how dexterously
I do it," said George.</p>

<p>"Proceed, we are all ears and eyes," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"What is the counterfeit that you are going to
strip?" asked Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"Economy."</p>

<p>"Economy! You don't pretend to say that economy
is a counterfeit!" they both exclaimed at once.</p>

<!-- page 317 -->

<p>"Yes, a counterfeit virtue, as you shall judge, if we
are to decide by what the effects would be if carried
out to the legitimate end, that is, practised by all of
the class upon whom it is urged."</p>

<p>"Give us the benefit of your reasons for such a conclusion,
please," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Practical as ever," he remarked, with a laugh;
"well, little wife, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you hesitate, sir?"</p>

<p>"I was trying to think of the feminine for fellow,
but as I can't make it sound pretty, I will say, my sister-workers,
please tell me how many working-men
there are in the United States?"</p>

<p>"Haven't the least idea, sir," said Marion.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to calculate a little," he said.
"We have twelve million voters in a population of
sixty millions, and at least three out of four are
workers, those who work for wages, farmers, etc."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that we have nine million men
who toil for their bread in some shape?" said Mrs.
Lenox.</p>

<p>"Yes, but six million will be enough to prove our
position. Now, what are counted as essential virtues in a
working-man?"</p>

<p>"Industry and economy are the chief ones," said
Marion.</p>

<p>"One question here: A genuine virtue, if I understand
what virtue is, can be practised by all without
injury to any."</p>

<p>They all agreed to his definition, and he continued:
"Then we will make six million men, with their
families, thirty million people, economical for one year.

<!-- page 318 -->

They shall set themselves to saving a little for a rainy
day, say fifty dollars for each family. Many of them,
with a little care, could do this, and some could save
more, others less, but we will make that the average&mdash;no,
Mr. Banker, we will not deposit this money with
you. We will put it where we shall know it will be
there when we want it.</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' says the banker, 'I will pay you interest for
its use.'</p>

<p>"Ah, and where are you going to get your interest?
You do not produce a dollar's worth of anything; all
that you get is drawn from what we produce. No, sir,
we will keep our money, and we will take gold for our
paper, as the bondholders do for theirs. How much
would that draw from the money of the country&mdash;that
which is kept in circulation&mdash;Mrs. Lenox?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred million a year, twenty-five million
a month," she said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"To save this they must economize; we will now
see what they must do without. Remember, we have
thirty million people, counting five to the family, who
must do with less of the products of labor, who will
buy less than now. We will commence with one pound
of sugar less per week to the family, fifty-two pounds
less per year, three hundred and twelve million less
pounds of sugar sold; how would the raisers of cane
like that?"</p>

<p>"I think it would raise Cain with a good many of
them," said Mabel, and the others laughed at the application.</p>

<p>"And how many men would it throw out of employment?"</p>

<!-- page 319 -->

<p>"That I have no means of knowing," she replied,
soberly, for she began to get a glimpse of what the result
of such a course would be.</p>

<p>"We have now saved five dollars and twenty cents
toward the fifty dollars. We will next count ten yards
of cloth less to each person, fifty yards to the family; it
will make extra patching for the women, and perhaps
keep some of them from church, but we don't care
for that. Cotton cloths and calicoes are cheap, and
the poor do not buy many costly goods, but we will
put the average cost per yard at twelve and a half
cents.</p>

<p>"We now have three hundred million yards less
cloth sold, and six and a quarter dollars more toward
the fifty; but how would the raisers of wool and
cotton feel about it, and how many more would that
throw out of employment?"</p>

<p>"A very large number of men, and women too," was
the response.</p>

<p>"We will next count a hat and bonnet less to each,
thirty million hats and bonnets less, and as many pairs
of boots and shoes less. We will count eight dollars
and fifty-five cents less to the family on these articles,
making twenty dollars saved toward the fifty; but how
could those who were thrown out of employment buy
at all? You see we are burning the candle at both
ends."</p>

<p>The three women were looking pretty sober by this
time. They began to see that economy was not what
it has been supposed to be, that its effect upon society,
if practised by all, would be destructive instead of constructive.</p>

<!-- page 320 -->

<p>"Why don't you economize on those things that injure
instead of benefit?" asked Miss Hibbard.</p>

<p>"Do you mean tea?" he asked, mischievously.</p>

<p>"Tea, coffee, whiskey, and tobacco," she replied.</p>

<p>"So long as the rich and idle use these things we will
not take them utterly from the toiling poor, but we will
economize on their use, say five dollars worth less of each
to a family&mdash;thirty million dollars worth less of each.
The tea would affect foreign trade, but there would be
ninety million dollars worth of the other three products
of our country unsold, if not unproduced. If
produced and unsold, the money invested is a dead loss;
if unproduced, then we have a certain number of men
and women unemployed.</p>

<p>"The people are better off without any of those
stimulants," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"That may be true, but who is going to take care
of those who are thrown out of employment?"</p>

<p>"Start some other enterprise; there is enough to be
done."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mrs. Lenox, there is enough to be
done, but unless the bankers of the world consent that
we, through our representatives, issue legal tender
notes, where is the money to come from?&mdash;Remember,
we have supposed the gold thus saved to be in the
hands of those who save it, and the money and property
invested in the coffee, tobacco, and liquor business
would not be available for new enterprises."</p>

<p>"The thing is an impossibility," said Mabel; "such
economy would be like a man sawing off the limb upon
which he was standing, between himself and the body
of the tree."</p>

<!-- page 321 -->

<p>"But we have ten dollars of the fifty yet unaccounted
for," said George, "and we will save five of
that on books and papers, and five on recreation, such
as plays, picnics, railroad excursions, etc. Thirty million
dollars less books and papers sold, and thirty million
less to railroads, circuses, and theatres. Not less
than a hundred thousand people thrown out of employment
by these two items of economy, allowing six hundred
dollars to each, and that is more than the average
of what our working-people get."</p>

<p>"There is one point you have not considered," said
Marion.</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Or, only indirectly, as they are among those thrown
out of employment; I mean business failures."</p>

<p>"True, and the effect of a business failure is much
more far-reaching. Three hundred million dollars
withdrawn from the general circulation would cause,
say, a hundred thousand business failures. There are
that number of men in the country who would fail if
three thousand dollars were taken from each."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel, "and among all these distressed
families, merchants broken up in their business, and
laborers out of employment, there would be born perhaps
half a million children less richly endowed at
birth, because of the break-up caused by such attempted
economy; and though we can see that the attempt
could not be carried out, do not financial panics
produce similar results?"</p>

<p>"They certainly do," said George, "and panics are
purposely made by those who control the money of a
country. Our national bankers have, some of them,

<!-- page 322 -->

already declared that by concert of action they could
produce a panic, should Congress dare to pass a law
detrimental to their interest."</p>

<p>"If all mothers could see the effect of a panic upon
the unborn as clearly as I can, every such banker,
should the attempt be made, would hang to the first
lamp-post, and by women's hands," said Mabel, with
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"I did not know, little wife, that you could be so
savage."</p>

<p>"Oh, George," she replied, with a tremor in her
voice, "I wish woman would wake up to her responsibility.
I once read a story of a woman who was
pursued by wolves, and when she saw that both must
perish if she did not, she dropped her babe, and by
the temporary delay she saved herself; and because of
this, because she did not cling to her babe and perish
with it, she was looked upon with horror. What then
could be thought of a company of women who could
stand idly by and see the men turn the wolves loose
upon the children?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mabel! exclaimed Marion and Myra, both at
once.</p>

<p>Mabel continued: "I found some lines the other
day which read,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">Oh, deeper for me the pathos<br/>

Of a mother's face and eyes,<br/>

When she sees the beautiful body<br/>

Of her child that lifeless lies&mdash;<br/>

Beyond all the expression<br/>

Of marble Laocoon&mdash;<br/>

Of painted crucifixion,<br/>

And Christ-head pale and wan.'</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 323 -->

<p>"When I read it, the form of my own dead boy
came before me, and I thought: 'Suppose he had lived
to become a wreck of society,' and the pain I felt at
the thought gave me to understand something of the
pain felt by thousands of mothers continually&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'So deeper to me the pathos<br/>

Of the sorrow that tells of the wreck<br/>

Of the child that once lay in her bosom&mdash;<br/>

Whose arms once encircled her neck.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Are not the mothers who see and feel this unworthy
the name, if they put not forth all their powers
to prevent such results?"</p>

<p>No one responded, and she continued:</p>

<p>"My poor baby boy, I did not think I was using up
your life, but you will not reproach me, and though
the <i>say so</i> of the Church could not comfort me, reason,
common-sense, and the revealments of modern experience
do. Clairvoyance proves that you still live, and
I shall go to you ere long."</p>

<p>"Mabel, Mabel," cried George, "you are becoming
morbid; do not let the thought of leaving us rest in
your mind for a moment."</p>

<p>"What did I say?" she asked, rousing as if from a
dream. "Oh, I remember; well, is it not true? It
cannot be long, at the most. More than twenty-one
years ago I chose my life-work, and it seems more like
so many months than years."</p>

<p>"And the more we talk of the work the greater it
seems," said Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"I am glad George brought this question of economy

<!-- page 324 -->

up, for I want all these things made clear in our book,"
replied Mabel.</p>

<p>"Another point, wife," he said; "there is not a
single prevailing vice, no matter how debasing, that
society, as it exists to-day, can do without&mdash;not one that
could be eradicated but the suffering caused would be
greater than that relieved, unless our whole economic
system is changed."</p>

<p>"And still another point," said Marion. "It is said
that the rich furnish employment for the poor, but do
they?"</p>

<p>"Apparently they do, but really they do not," replied
George, "as we have seen that buying less on
their part throws them out of employment."</p>

<p>"But does not the reduction of wages have the same
effect?" asked Mrs. Lenox.</p>

<p>"With this difference," he replied: "if each family
gets fifty dollars less wages, the money remains in the
hands of the employer, and is used to help secure foreign
markets for the goods produced&mdash;but why try to
unravel all the tangles? When it is done they are
only ropes to tie us up with. An entirely new system
is the only remedy."</p>

<p>"Is it not barely possible," asked Mabel, "that, with
the tangle unravelled, we may use the ropes to tie up
the other party?"</p>

<p>George laughed. "There may be something in
that," he said, "if you mean that by understanding it
ourselves we can show up its evils the better."</p>

<p>"That is what I mean, but I have thought enough
now."</p>

<p>"That is to say, you are tired," said Marion, kissing

<!-- page 325 -->

her, "so we will go now, and when you want us again,
please let us know."</p>

<p>"Thanks," and when they were gone, she laid her
head on George's breast and said: "Oh, if I can only
say half I feel, our book will do its work."</p>

<p>"Why do you say our book, dear?"</p>

<p>"Because without your love I could not write it."</p>

<p>Months passed, and the book grew apace. The ten
thousand dollars had been called in and placed in the
bank ready for use, when one day the doors were closed,
and depositors informed that the leading clerk had disappeared
with the funds.</p>

<p>When the news was broken to Mabel, she fainted,
and it was some time before they could bring her to
consciousness again. Of course, in this case, as in
nearly every other, the absconding villain was a good
church member, but he did not happen to be a Sabbath
school superintendent.</p>

<p>"Another vendetti rat," said Walter, with that same
terrible look in his eye.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox, who had been away travelling with Miss
Hibbard, had returned the day before, while the latter
had gone to Boston to visit friends. She was present
when Walter uttered the above words, as was also Mrs.
Raymond and George, and they were startled to hear,
in the deep tones of old:</p>

<p>"The vendetti has reacted from the other side."</p>

<p>Walter turned pale, while Mrs. Raymond, seeing the
entranced condition of Myra, said: "Please explain
yourself."</p>

<p>"I mean that I made a mistake when I influenced
Walter to bring Hapgood into your house. The magnetic

<!-- page 326 -->

lines were thus laid that enabled him to watch
his opportunity. That bank clerk is what is called a
sensitive, and is only partly responsible, no more so
than was the agent I used to accomplish my purpose."</p>

<p>"Why do you not come to us oftener? It is now
more than ten years since we have heard from you;
we thought you had forgotten us," said George.</p>

<p>"You are never forgotten," was the response, "but
soon after my mistake, ten years ago, I learned that
wise spirits do not communicate often. The tendency
to rely upon us would prevent the development of your
own powers. I only come now to impress a lesson."</p>

<p>"What is your lesson, please?"</p>

<p>"It is this: whenever we act from a feeling of personal
revenge, no matter how great the provocation, it
is sure to react upon us, and where we least expect it."</p>

<p>"Why could you not warn us, and thus save the
money?" asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"Because Hapgood being in your home last, was able,
with the help of others, to bar the door against me. I
could not get control in time; but I must go," and Myra
Lenox slowly opened her eyes, and said, "Really, I
have been asleep;" and then, noticing the expression
on their faces, started up with:</p>

<p>"Paul has been here again."</p>

<p>They assented, and told her what he had said; and
then there followed a discussion as to the reasonableness
of his statements. Was it possible for one to act
through the magnetic lines thus formed?</p>

<p>"Why should not a spirit have as much power as a
dog?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>They all looked up in surprise, and Nellie, who had

<!-- page 327 -->

just come in, said, "That is a strange comparison,
spirits with dogs."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a dog who could not follow his
master's track by the magnetism coming through the
heel of his boot?" he continued, not noticing Nellie's
remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, and when he has found him, or any other
game, he can summon dogs enough, if they are to be
had, to help him keep all others back."</p>

<p>"I see the application," said George.</p>

<p>Mabel came in, looking sad and pale. They told her
what had been said. She smiled:</p>

<p>"There is one way in which they cannot beat me,"
she said; "I gave my baby, I can give myself," and
she passed on, leaving them in doubt as to her meaning.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch20">

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">ALL OF LIFE.</p>

</div>

<p>"WHAT did you mean, dear, by saying you
could give your own life for the cause?"</p>

<p>Just then there came a rap at the door,
and upon opening it Myra Lenox stood
there.</p>

<p>"It is late, I know, but I want to tell you what I
came for early in the evening. I became so interested
in what you were saying that I forgot all about it," she
said.</p>

<p>"Never too late to see you; but George has just
asked what I meant by giving my life to the cause. I
did not know but you were worrying over it, too; are
you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;what did you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" she paused, a sort of dreamy
look came over her face, and presently she said:</p>

<p>"I will try to tell you. We put a portion of our
own life into whatever we do, if we are in earnest, if
the heart is in it. That my heart is in my work, you
know. I can see now that I put it before even my
mother love, and in doing so I put into it the life force
that should have been my child's, and it could not live.
I did not do this purposely, intentionally, but because
the life naturally went with the strongest love, and my

<!-- page 329 -->

love, my desire to see the wrongs removed which stand
in the way of perfect motherhood, was stronger than
all else."</p>

<p>She paused again, as though the intensity of her
feelings wearied her. They looked into her earnest
eyes, and saw them take on their far away look, but
said nothing, simply sat and waited.</p>

<p>Presently she came back to her subject&mdash;the question
she had begun to answer: "Do you think I have lost
any of my earnestness, any of my purpose, to see all
that stands in the path of true motherhood, withdrawn?
They say that Christ bore our sins and carried our sorrows;
as to bearing our sins, he could not, but he could
so put himself in sympathy with human woe that he
could feel every sorrow that could have become his, in
fact. He could feel it all when he became one with
the race; but he was not a woman." Again she paused,
but only for a moment.</p>

<p>"I mean," she said, "that anyone who has the power
to lay his or her heart close beside the great, suffering
heart of humanity, can feel the tide of human woe as
it rolls along; can understand, suffer every sorrow which
could under the same circumstances have been theirs;
but man can never be a mother, can never feel as a
mother does, cannot understand her sorrow; I can."</p>

<p>"Then if Jesus ever lived and died, as is said of him,
and if he was, or is, man's Saviour, you would say that
he could not be woman's?" said Myra.</p>

<p>"No man can; no man living can feel a woman's
sorrow at the wreck of her child as a woman can&mdash;no
man can feel the horror of enforced, unwelcome
motherhood as woman can. If they could once get a

<!-- page 330 -->

glimpse of such horror, they would not make laws
putting the wife's person in the husband's keeping,
making him responsible for her support if she is obedient,
and freeing him from such obligation if she refuses.</p>

<p>"It is of no use to expect man to do this work;
woman must. Then, with my heart fully set in this
direction, when I am shut off from other channels of
work, my very thoughts will drink of my vital force,
and go forth like winged arrows, making their way to
woman's brain, to woman's heart&mdash;will do this till the
last drop of vitality is gone&mdash;that is what I mean."</p>

<p>"And now I will tell you what I came for," said
Mrs. Lenox. "I was thinking of you, Mabel, and I
seemed to see, not with my physical eyes, but mentally,
a large dandelion blossom; presently it ran up its stem
and ripened its feathery seeds, and a breeze scattered
them; but even as I looked, another blossom came
from the same root and ripened in the same way; then
another, and another, on till the life of the root was all
gone; and it made such an impression upon me, I felt
I must tell you."</p>

<p>"A good symbol, I am glad you came," said Mabel,
smiling cheerfully; but George could not smile. As
he looked upon his wife's pale face and earnest eyes,
he felt that she must go, but how could he give her
up?</p>

<p>"Emerson says," Mabel continued, " 'Thoughts
float in the air, and the most susceptible, the most easily
impressed, catch them first.' Oh, how I shall send
out my thoughts, and in form just suited to woman's
nature, and some will reach good ground, I know, and
the hundred-fold fruit be sown to multiply again, and&mdash;no,

<!-- page 331 -->

I shall not be defeated; the work I have set
myself to do will be done," and her face shone as her
spirit reached into the future to grasp her triumph.</p>

<p>"What of your book?" asked Myra, more for the
purpose of turning the thought than anything else, for
she felt awed, oppressed with the intensity of Mabel's
mood.</p>

<p>"I shall finish that if I can, but if not, later on
someone else will write a better one."</p>

<p>"Oh, finish your book, and we will see that it is
published. I will give a hundred dollars myself toward
it."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mrs. Lenox, but a book opposing so much
of things as they are, will fall flat if not extensively
advertised. It will be like a man nominated for the
presidency and not elected; he is not likely to be nominated
the second time. His chance is gone."</p>

<p>"Then finish the book and let it lie till we have the
needed funds to advertise as you wish. Finish the
book, and we will then go to work for the money."
said George.</p>

<p>"I will finish the book if I can, if it is never published;
for giving my thoughts form upon paper will
help to intensify them, to send them out well defined
upon the mental atmosphere. Who knows but, like an
arrow shot in the dark, my thought may thus reach
some mind of the mental power to write a much better
book than I can. No, don't worry about my book; it
may be premature only in the sense I have named."</p>

<p>"But, Mabel, do you really believe that thoughts go
out on the mental atmosphere to be taken up by other
minds?"</p>

<!-- page 332 -->

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"Will you please give me your reasons?"</p>

<p>"George, you are the philosopher, please explain to
Mrs. Lenox the <i>modus operandi</i>."</p>

<p>"I will try, Mabel; Mrs. Lenox, when I speak to
you, what is it that conveys the sound to your ear?"</p>

<p>"The atmosphere, of course."</p>

<p>"And without the atmosphere there could be no
sound?"</p>

<p>"They say not."</p>

<p>"Of what is the atmosphere composed?"</p>

<p>"Of fine particles of matter."</p>

<p>"Yes, so fine as to be invisible to the naked eye;
but how are they created? whence come they?"</p>

<p>"How are they created? through some natural law,
but who understands the law, Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>"I do not mean in the sense of absolute creation. It
is a demonstrated fact that a portion of what we eat
and drink passes out through the pores of the skin,
and we call it insensible perspiration; that insensible
perspiration is thrown out through the activities of the
life-force within us, is <i>our</i> atmosphere. The atmosphere
of the earth is created by the activities of the
life-force of matter; is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It must be so, if the time was, as geologists say,
that the earth was destitute of an atmosphere such as
we have now," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then, if the activities of life acting through and
upon matter produce a physical atmosphere, why
should not the activities of life acting through mind
produce a mental atmosphere? and if the action of life
in words can be carried upon the physical atmosphere

<!-- page 333 -->

to another's consciousness, why should not the activities
of life through thought be carried on the mental
atmosphere to another's consciousness?"</p>

<p>"You have made the matter very clear, Mr. Gray,
so far as theory is concerned, but have you facts to confirm
your theory?" she asked.</p>

<p>"When the cars are coming, you generally hear
them before you see them, because the sound caused by
the concussion of the atmosphere goes ahead of that
which produces it. Can you not think of facts in the
mental atmosphere to correspond?"</p>

<p>"I do not at this moment think of any."</p>

<p>"And yet I feel quite certain, Mrs. Lenox, that you
have experienced many. Did you never, when a friend
came to see you, say, 'I was just thinking of you?' "</p>

<p>"Many a time, Mr. Gray, and I have often asked
myself why it was."</p>

<p>"Your friend was thinking of you, and the thought
came ahead on the mental atmosphere, just as the sound
goes ahead on the physical atmosphere. The sound
reaches the brain through the medium of the ear; the
thought goes direct."</p>

<p>"If that is so, why can we not learn to talk by
thought?"</p>

<p>"We can, Mrs. Lenox, when we take as much pains
in educating the mental sense as we do the sense of
hearing. The child hears the sound, but it has to learn
to understand; we feel thought, and can surely learn
to understand also; would, if shut up to the mental
sense as the blind are to the sense of feeling.</p>

<p>"They learn to read through the ends of the fingers
by having raised letters, and the intense thought

<!-- page 334 -->

thrown out by one who feels as Mabel does is to the
mentally blind what raised letters are to the physical;
and more&mdash;it brands itself in red-hot colors upon the
mental atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mabel, "your illustrations make
me strong to feel, and thus to do."</p>

<p>George looked as though he would prefer to weaken
instead of strengthening her purpose, if he could
thereby save her; but, feeling that he could not, he
simply said: "I am glad of anything that helps you."</p>

<p>Mabel grew weaker day by day, and finally laid
aside her pen altogether. She smilingly said:</p>

<p>"Mother Nature has been experimenting, and she
finds the material not strong enough for the pressure,
but she will try again."</p>

<p>But she still read, or had others read to her, and
she always selected those subjects that bore upon the
questions involved in her work. One day she picked
up a paper containing two articles placed together by
way of contrast. The heading of the first was:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>GODISM EXEMPLIFIED.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Czar, as God's Representative, must Keep his
Kingdom Intact&mdash;hence Siberia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Read and Ponder</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>This was followed by an exile's description of his
trip to Siberia, in company with many others. In
speaking of the stillness of the room in which they all
gathered before starting, this exile said:</p>

<p>"We dared not speak; the incautious manifestations

<!-- page 335 -->

of emotion by one convict as he met another, might
result in both being returned to the casemates (cells) of
the fortress, till their relations could be investigated.
On one side of the table sat a young man and his betrothed,
who had not seen each other for five years, and
who, when thus reunited under the eyes of the gendarmes,
did not dare to speak."</p>

<p>As she read this, she paused and thought: "A personal
God upon a throne in the heavens, with a hell to
punish rebels; the result is a personal representative
upon the earth, with Siberia to punish rebels."</p>

<p>"Yes, and England has Australia," said George,
when she pointed out the fact to him.</p>

<p>The writer then went on to describe the scene after
they were on the convict cars, but out from under the
immediate eye of the gendarmes and once fairly on
their way to Russia's hell, Siberia. He said:</p>

<p>"To a prisoner who had lived in silence in a bomb-proof
casemate for years, the noise and rush of the
train, and the unfamiliar sight of the outer world were
at first intensely exciting, but the excitement was followed
by complete prostration. They became delirious
or lay on the floor unconscious. Stimulants were administered,
water was dashed into white, ghastly faces,
but all night long the car was filled with moans and
hysterical weeping."</p>

<p>Again Mabel paused, and as she thought she said to
herself:</p>

<p>"If there could be such a thing as a universal personality
sitting upon a throne and ruling the universe,
one who could permit of such injustice, I would summon
all the hosts of hell to help dethrone him."</p>

<!-- page 336 -->

<p>Finishing the terrible recital, of which the above is
but a fraction, she then turned to the one set opposite
it, and read:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>"THAT THE COST OF THIS."</p>

<p class="small">THE PALACE OF ONE OF GOD'S REPRESENTATIVES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">what wonder the people are poor!</span></p>

</div>

<p>Then followed a description of the Czar's Winter
Palace, the largest building in the world, which was
built at a cost of about forty million dollars; or rather,
remodelled at that cost, after having been partly destroyed.
The writer said:</p>

<p>"The throne-room is a magnificent apartment, of
marble, and so large that the entire White House, at
Washington, might be erected within its walls. The
hall of St. George is one hundred and fifty feet by
eighty in size, and sixty feet high, with a ceiling carved
and gilded with pure gold-leaf."</p>

<p>After naming several other magnificent halls, the
writer continues: "These great halls have sometimes
been used for banquets, and in them have dined three
thousand people at once, served on solid silver plate
throughout a menu of twelve courses, by eighteen hundred
liveried attendants, while the imperial family sat
at the end of the room on a raised platform, and took
their dinners off solid gold."</p>

<p>Further on it was said: "There seems to be no end
of the display; not only the furniture, but the walls,
ceilings, doors, and mouldings around the windows are
covered with sheets of gold."</p>

<!-- page 337 -->

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "and over, under, and
through it all is blood. Hearts are ground and mixed
with the gold; brains bespatter the walls, and infants'
skulls harden the glass and marble floors," and she covered
her face with her hands to shut out the awful sight.</p>

<p>She calmed herself presently, and read it all&mdash;the
description of the magnificence of a part, as a sample
of the whole seventeen hundred rooms of one of
the palaces, that, according to Christian teaching, God
permits his earthly representative to wring the cost
of from the suffering millions. She then turned to an
article in the next column, headed, "Consecration,"
and read the following definition of the word:</p>

<p>"You must forget self-advancement. You must be
ready for any work that promises progress in the right
direction. You must learn to have no fears of police
or prison when they stand between you and duty;
must put heart and soul in the cause; must study
ways and means for pushing forward the great end;
must ignore respectability, conventionalities, worn-out
moral codes; must brave persecution, misrepresentation,
and death itself if need be."</p>

<p>What was this cause that required such entire consecration?
She read on and found the following:</p>

<p>"Take a walk to Lake Randolph, or Madison Street
bridge, at six o'clock at night, and watch the listless,
stunted forms of children, with their old, tired faces,
passing over in throngs, and you have an object-lesson
that will startle you!" Ah, it was the betterment of
conditions for children that required such consecration.
She read on:</p>

<p>"Remember that these are the future members of

<!-- page 338 -->

society&mdash;the fathers and mothers of future generations;
that all buoyancy, energy, life, the very springs of progressive
existence, are being crushed out of them; that
they are overworked, often hungry and cold." Ah, it
is the good of future generations that demands such
consecration. Still she read on:</p>

<p>"You <i>read</i> of women whose wages, even when toiling
fourteen hours a day, are not enough to keep her
babes from hunger and cold, but could you know one
such woman; could you see her in her poor rooms,
dusty and disordered with slop-work; could you watch
the little children trying forlornly to amuse themselves
throughout the long, dull, days&mdash;could you see her
cheeks grow thin and her strength decline&mdash;could you
see all the struggle between virtue and desperation, in
which the latter, aided by hunger and mother-love,
finally triumphs, and she goes upon the street, soliciting
what her soul abhors."</p>

<p>She could not go on, but when she glanced at the
signature and found that it was a woman who was demanding
consecration to what would remove such conditions,
it brought a ray of light to the picture with such
dark shading&mdash;yes, another woman was at work with
pen of fire and soul of flame, and she was glad for this.</p>

<p>But turning back to the woman so crushed onto the
street, and reading that the one case could be multiplied
by thousands, she said: "Oh, I wish that every
such woman, every one so crushed, would kill first
their children, and then themselves. I think it would
force people to think." She said the same to George
when he came in.</p>

<p>"They dare not," he said, "because of the pictures

<!-- page 339 -->

of a future hell that the priests have placed before
their eyes."</p>

<p>From that time forward, when she took her daily
ride, she would ask one day to be driven among the
tenement-houses, and along the streets where poverty
and wretchedness prevailed; and the next along the
wide streets upon which were the palaces of the rich,
and would always say, as she rode along past the latter:
"That is the price of this; that poverty to pay for
this magnificence."</p>

<p>Finally, the time came when she could no longer go
out. The minister whose church they used to attend
had called a few times after they ceased to go, but had
not been there for years. What, then, was their surprise
to find him so anxious about Mabel's soul, as to
come again at this particular time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond greeted him cordially, spoke of his
being quite a stranger, etc.</p>

<p>"I supposed," he said, "that you had become dissatisfied
with my preaching and so went elsewhere;
but hearing that your daughter was very sick, I felt
that I should like to see her once more."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hunter, I am not attending church elsewhere,"
she said; "but I thank you for your kindly interest
in my daughter," she replied.</p>

<p>"You do not mean to say that you do not attend
church anywhere, Mrs. Raymond," he said, with a look
of surprise.</p>

<p>"That is what I said, Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes very wide, opened his lips as if
to speak, and then closed them again, for her cool self-possession
disconcerted him.</p>

<!-- page 340 -->

<p>She laughed pleasantly: "I have some Quaker
blood in me," she said, "and I think their dislike
of what they call a hireling ministry has proved hereditary,
only it did not show itself very early in
life."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, the Quakers are a very good people. Can
I see Mrs. Gray?"</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me a moment, I will see how
she feels;" and going to Mabel's room, she said: "The
minister, Mr. Hunter, is here; do you wish to see
him?"</p>

<p>Mabel thought a moment. "I will see him as a
friend, but not as a minister. I am not in the least
anxious about death or a future life, and I do not wish
to be worried by any talk upon such subjects," she
said; then, as her mother turned to go, she seemed to
change her mind, and she added:</p>

<p>"I don't know as I care what he says, either. I may
be able to say something that will do him good."</p>

<p>And so the reverend gentleman, who had so often
been called upon to give comfort to the dying, went
to the room of the woman whose very life was going
out&mdash;being used up in love for humanity&mdash;went
to this woman, who forgot self in that great love,
with the idea of pointing her to Christ as the only Saviour.</p>

<p>She smiled, gave him her hand, thanked him for
remembering her, and then there was silence, for there
was that in her face that forbade the stereotyped
phrases he was accustomed to using.</p>

<p>Presently she said: "I am glad you have come, sir.
I want to ask why it is that the ministers in this city

<!-- page 341 -->

do not prevail upon their rich parishioners to take
hold of, and remove, such evils as our tenement-house
system of living produces. I want to ask why they do
not find out the cause of such poor wages as many
women get, and how they think people can live virtuous
lives under such conditions."</p>

<p>"My dear child, we do what we can, but our work
is a spiritual one; it is to prepare people for the next
life, instead of interfering in the affairs of this; besides,
the working people are mostly to blame for their
own condition. They get wages enough to make them
comfortable, if they would not use up what they earn
in drink."*

<p class="small">[*A fact.]</p>

<p>She turned her luminous eyes full upon him:</p>

<p>"Enough to make them comfortable, do you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thousands of them waste their money in
drink, cheap shows, and the like, and then complain
of their poverty. There is a great deal of misapplied
sympathy, Mrs. Gray. People ought to suffer for
their own wrong-doing."</p>

<p>"Do not tire yourself, dear," said her mother, seeing
that she paused before replying.</p>

<p>"It does not tire me, mother; but Mr. Hunter says
the working-men get enough to make them comfortable.
I was wondering how many ministers would
think they could be comfortable on the same amount."</p>

<p>"It is very evident, Mrs. Gray," said Mr. Hunter,
"that you are talking of what you do not understand.
Your remarks do credit to your heart, and we all feel
sorry for the evils we see; but, seeing no way to remove
them, we must leave all to God."</p>

<!-- page 342 -->

<p>"Mr. Hunter, as a dying woman, I tell you that these
things have been left to God too long; they will never
be remedied till the people take hold with an earnest
determination to do the work themselves," said Mabel,
in reply.</p>

<p>"As a dying woman, you are not afraid to arraign
God's methods. His ways are higher than our ways,"
said the minister, backing toward the door as if he
would like to get out of the job he had undertaken.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am not afraid. I have no belief in a
personal God, and the stream of the infinite life that
flows through my life prompts me to seek for the
causes which produce such terrible results, and if I
should drop this body to-night, that same feeling
would draw me back from the very portals of heaven
to earth again, and I should continue to work for the
removal of such conditions, for,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"I could not remain in a world filled with bliss,<br/>

While rivers of sorrow were rolling through this."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The man was touched in spite of his theology.
"Yours is a strange faith," he said; "but with so much
love for humanity as you express, I will trust in God
for you, and hope it will all be right; he understands
better than I can."</p>

<p>"Trust not for me, but work for this world&mdash;give
yourself to the work of humanity with entire consecration&mdash;<i>entire</i>
consecration," she repeated, "and the next
world will take care of itself," and then closed her eyes
as though her strength failed her to say more.</p>

<p>"Farewell, then," he said. She opened her eyes and
reached her hand. "Farewell," she responded, and

<!-- page 343 -->

the Reverend Mr. Hunter went out feeling a new sensation.</p>

<p>George came in soon after, and regretted that he
had not been present. He seldom left her now, for he
felt that the end could not be far away.</p>

<p>A few days after this she asked to be propped up
in bed, and then she sent for them all to come to her
room. "I have a few requests to make," she said,
"and I do not want George to have all the responsibility
of carrying them out."</p>

<p>"First, I want Marion and Myra sent for, and when
the end comes I want no one but them to touch my
body&mdash;that is, I want no stranger to handle it. If
they cannot come, mother, please, you and Nellie prepare
it for the grave."</p>

<p>They bowed their heads while tears rolled down
their cheeks, and the next moment Nellie was on her
knees beside the bed. "Oh, live, live, and I will devote
my life to you," she cried.</p>

<p>"My poor sister, you forget; Walter and your children
need you," she replied, gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, Salmagundi, how can I give you up!" cried
Walter, forgetting in his anguish all but the old, teasing
name, and that she was the playmate of his childhood.</p>

<p>Mabel smiled, even then, at the memory of the old
time blunder. She had not heard the name for so
long that the present was for a moment lost sight of in
the memories of the past, and then she turned her
eyes wearily to her father.</p>

<p>"Don't, children, you distress her," he said in response,
while his own strong frame shook with emotion.

<!-- page 344 -->

She then looked toward her mother and gave a
hand to each.</p>

<p>"Father, mother, do not let the world blame
George; he knows what my wishes are, and will carry
them out, but I want you to stand by him. I want
none but those I have named to George, and the family,
present; no funeral sermon, no prayer; only the
verses I have selected sung. Marion and Myra will
place my body in the casket if they are here; if not,
father and mother will please do it."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and they gave her a glass of
water. "You may think it strange," she said, "that
I make these requests, but I want no one not in full
sympathy with the dearest object of my life-work to
bring magnetic lines that will come as a cloud, a mist
between me and this my home, for it will still be my
home. Now please lay me down."</p>

<p>She lingered some ten days longer, and then, with a
smile on her lips, she simply stopped breathing&mdash;went
to sleep as quietly as does a child upon its mother's
breast; and her wishes were carried out as sacredly as
though commands from the infinite heavens. And so
they were; they came from the love-life which flowed
through her life like a perennial stream, and what else
