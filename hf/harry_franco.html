<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>Being the beginning of the Book, is very properly devoted to
the beginning of the Hero.</p>

<p>ANCESTRAL.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is a generally received opinion in some parts
of the world, that a man must of necessity have
had ancestors; but, in our truly independent
country, we contrive to get along very well without
them. That strange race, called Aristocrats,
it is said, consider every body as nobody, unless
they can boast of at least a dozen ancestors. These
lofty people would have scorned an alliance with
a parvenu like Adam, of course. What a fortunate
circumstance for their high mightinesses, that
they were not born in the early ages. No antediluvian
family would have been entitled to the
slightest consideration from them. When the
world was only two thousand years old, it is
melancholy to reflect, its surface was covered with
nobodies; men of yesterday, without an ancestry
worth speaking of. It is not to be wondered at,
that such a set of upstarts should have caused the
flood; nothing less would have washed away their
vulgarity, to say nothing of their sins.</p>

<p>But in this blessed country, as is known to all
the world, men rest their claims to notice on their
own merits; and as we neither hold ourselves
accountable for the vices, nor take credit to ourselves
for the virtues of our ancestors, it will not
be necessary for me to trace my pedigree any
farther back than to my immediate progenitor;
and of him I shall write but very sparingly, as it
is my intention, in these pages, to confine my
narrative to my own personal adventures.</p>

<p>Every body has heard of the long Embargo;
but every body, it is probable, has not heard as
much about it as I have. It was by that wise and
patriotic measure, that my father was ruined; and
it will not be wondered at, that it should have
formed, ever after, the staple of his conversation.
It was not the fashion in those days for a man to
set up his carriage after he had failed in business;
so my father conformed to the custom of the times,
as he would have done, probably, if his misfortunes
had overtaken him later in life, and having
paid all his honest debts, he scraped together the
odds and ends that were left to him, and removed
to his native village, there to await for better
times; and in due course of events, I made my
appearance in the world.</p>

<p>My native village was a quiet little out-of-the-way
place, about a day's ride from one of the
steamboat landings on the Hudson. Like every
other little out-of-the-way village, its quiet was in
appearance only, for the men and women who
made up its body politic, were as much under the
dominion of the enemy of man's peace, as ever
were the dwellers of a great and crowded city. Of
this fact, my unfortunate parents very soon became
convinced. My father, it is probable, always was
convinced of it; but my mother, who was city
bred, and who had picked up her ideas of human
nature from novels and romances, expected to find
country people and villagers, as innocent as the
lambs that frisked about on their meadows; and
the first outbreak of uncharitableness, which she
witnessed in her new neighbors, caused as much
astonishment in her mind, as though she had found
a thorn on the stem of a butter cup.</p>

<p>Having thus accounted for my being in the
world, I shall close this chapter, and in the very
next, proceed at once to the business in hand, and
relate my adventures with as little digression as
possible. And I trust that my kind reader, when
he shall arrive at the end, will not be compelled
to ejaculate, as the old woman did when she read
the dictionary through from <i>A</i> to <i>izzard</i>, that she
could make neither head nor tail of the story.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>Although very short, will contain more than half my life.</p>

</div>

<p>I ONCE had a maiden aunt, who used to say it
was easier to raise children than chickens; from
which it might be proper to infer, that she hated
little boys and girls, and loved poultry. The inference
may be true, or not; but none, except the
inexperienced, will doubt the truth of her saying.
Certain it is, children will thrive upon means in
credibly small; and where one little existence is
suffered to go out for want of sustenance, dozens
are surfeited out of the world, before they are
surfeited with it.</p>

<p>I had one sister; she was two years older than
myself, and we grew up together almost miraculously;
for my father having expended nearly all
his means in a legal contest with a stubborn lawyer,
had but a trifle to bestow upon his offspring.
The next ten years of his existence he lived upon
hope, expecting, at the death of my grandfather,
who was rich, to come into possession of his property,
jointly with my uncle. But my grandfather
was an implacable old man, and for some reason,
which I never rightly understood, he took a dislike
to my father, and bequeathed him but one
dollar, leaving the bulk of his property to my
uncle. Although the disappointment to my father
was very great, when the only prop upon which
his hopes rested was knocked from under him, yet
the reflection that his father had gone into an unchangeable
existence with hatred in his heart
against him, gave him more pain than the mere
loss of the property. When the full extent of
our misfortunes was known, domestic matters
were much straiter with us than before my grandfather's
death. My father had seemingly lost
all his energy; and my mother, to solace herself,
took to two articles of domestic manufacture,
which owe their support chiefly to indolent old
ladies, and romantic young ones; viz., novels
and snuff.</p>

<p>My sister and myself were left to follow the
bent of our own inclinations, which would no
doubt have led us into the street, where the inclinations
of young folks generally lead them, had
it not been that we were very proud, and our little
hearts could not brook the sight of our cousins
better dressed than ourselves, and, as we were
taught to believe, at our expense. We had no
companions, and all our little stock of knowledge
was gained from the books which my mother read.
Miserable food it was for the minds of young creatures
like us, who had no opportunities of correcting
by observation the strange accounts we read of the
world we lived in. And so, in this idle manner I
grew up, ignorant of every thing around me, and
with dreamy, ill-defined apprehensions of the way
of the world. I had attained to my seventeenth
year; and I might have continued until now doing
nothing better than reading novels, or what is
worse, perhaps, writing them, had it not been for
a very trifling incident, which sent me forth into
the world to encounter the adventures which I am
now about to relate, for the especial instruction and
benefit of my kind reader.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>The first impulse which set the locomotive of my destiny in
motion.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was one of those peculiar days in March, of
which the words bitter, intense, freezing, chilly, or
piercing, do not convey an adequate idea, but
which the term raw, very nearly defines. I had
been on an errand for my mother, and was returning
home chilled to the midriff, for I had neither
cloak nor great coat, when, as I turned the corner
of the street, I met my cousin John, who was
advancing towards me clothed in a handsome surtout
with a fur collar; his flushed cheek, and his
laughing mouth, showed how well at ease he felt,
and how well he was defended against the inclemency
of the weather. He was a proud, overbearing
boy, and I had always tried to avoid him;
but I encountered him so suddenly now, that I
could not get out of his way without appearing to
be either afraid or ashamed of meeting him.</p>

<p>"What," he said, tapping me on the shoulder
with his rattan, "have you got no cloak to wear
this chilly weather, cousin Harry?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind the cold," I said, trying to look
very warm and cheerful, although my lips were so
benumbed I could hardly move them.</p>

<p>"I see you don't," he replied.</p>

<p>I felt too indignant to make him any answer,
and I turned to leave him, when he called me
back.</p>

<p>"I will tell you something," he said, "if you
will promise not to let on to any body."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked eagerly, thinking it
might be something in relation to my grandfather's
estate.</p>

<p>"I am a prophet," he said.</p>

<p>"Is that all!" I replied.</p>

<p>"O, no, not quite all; I prophesy that you will
die the death of old Cole's dog one of these days.
Do you know what complaint he died of?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He died of pride and poverty." And so
saying, he laughed sneeringly, and we parted.</p>

<p>There is neither heat nor cold, sunshine nor
gloom, in outward nature; they exist in the mind
alone. The raw east wind still beat in my face&mdash;the
long icicles still hung from the branches of the
leafless trees&mdash;the ground was still frozen beneath
my feet, and my back was still unprotected by the
friendly warmth of a furred great coat&mdash;but I no
longer shivered with the cold; the blood burned
in my veins, and the sweat started upon my forehead.
The words of my cousin entered into my
heart; they had either created or put in motion
feelings which I had never known before. In a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, I was changed.
I was an altered being. I felt desires and aspirations
springing up within me, which almost drove
me mad.</p>

<p>I hurried home, and throwing myself on the
floor, covered my face with my hands, and burst
into tears. I had never known the bitterness of
grief before. My heart seemed to be running out
at my eyes, and at each sob the cause of my grief
seemed but to increase. My mother was in the
middle of a new novel, but she threw it aside, and
caught me in her arms, and began to examine to
see if my limbs were broken; and my sister, with
out asking the cause of my grief, lifted up her
voice, and wept from sympathy. My father looked
on in silent wonder, until finding that none of my
bones were broken, he said it was extremely indecorous
for a lad of my time of life to behave so
childish.</p>

<p>I could make no reply to my father's remarks,
nor to my mother's tender inquiries, other than to
beg them to ask me no questions, and to let me retire
to my chamber.</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" I exclaimed, when left to myself,
"it is too true; I shall die, as my cousin has
predicted; pride and poverty will lead me to an
ignominious grave. I must live, while I do live,
known to but few, and despised even by them; and
at last I shall die, despised by myself."</p>

<p>After a while my grief began to subside; the
fountain of my tears was exhausted; the dreadful
words of my cousin grew more and more indistinct,
and in their place came thronging into my brain
the many wonderful stories I had read, of good
luck befalling the poor and the friendless; of
great men having taken a fancy to adventurous
boys, who had left their homes with nothing but a
wallet and a mother's blessing; and of their making
their fortunes, and returning with their pockets
lined with gold. These fine stories, it is true,
were nothing but fictions; but I did not then
know nor indeed dream, that there were men and
women in the world wicked enough to invent stories
to mislead the minds of the young and simple.
They were to me veritable histories, the truth of
which it had never entered into my head to call in
question. And so I asked myself why I might
not be as acceptable to fortune as others who had
stood in need of her favors, and boldly sought
them at her hands; and as I could make no objection
to this very reasonable demand, I resolved
at once, that I would set out in quest of a fortune
myself, and trust to that friendly divinity for aid,
who had conferred favors on others no better entitled
to them than myself.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I exclaimed, in the pleasant excitement
of my feelings, "I will prove my cousin a
lying prophet; I will gain a name among men&mdash;I
will become rich&mdash;my parents shall lean on me as a
staff in their old age, and my sister shall look to
me for support, and she shall not look in vain."</p>

<p>With such bold exclamations as these on my
lips, and with high resolves in my heart, I fell
asleep, and bright and pleasant were the visions
which visited me in my slumbers. When I awoke
in the morning, I made fresh resolutions to avert
the doom which the sneering prophecy of my
cousin had invoked upon my head; and when I
told my parents of my determination to seek my
fortune in the world, they made fewer objections
than I had anticipated. In truth, I believe my
father was not at all displeased to have the responsibility
of providing for me shifted from his shoulders
to mine; and my mother was so sanguine of
my success, that she could not find it in her heart
to oppose my wishes. Indeed, she had always
said I should some day get to be governor,
and my early ambition she considered as an earnest
of my future greatness. But my poor sister
did nothing but cry at the prospect of our being
parted, and for her sake I should have been willing
to give up all my ambitious designs.</p>

<p>After many days spent in debating the subject,
it was at last determined that my father should
furnish me with all the money he could raise, and
that I should proceed to New York, and seek for
employment as clerk in a counting house, it being
agreed on all hands that that was one of the genteelest
avenues which led up to the temple of the fickle
goddess; for it was a primary consideration with
my parents, that whatever I did should be done
genteely. But I made a mental reservation myself,
that fortune should not be rejected, let her
approach in what guise she might, but particularly
if in the shape of a young and beautiful heiress.
My plan of operations having been determined
upon, no time was lost in getting me ready for my
entrance into the world. Although my wardrobe
was by no means extensive, it required a great
many days to complete all the ripping and altering
which my mother considered necessary. I thought
there would never be an end to the preparation
for my departure; but at last the end came, and
unfortunately, the last article of dress which my
mother completed was a white Marseilles vest,
which she had altered out of an old one of my
father's, but it was so bespotted with tears and
snuff I was never able to wear it; I prized it more
highly, notwithstanding, than I did my new coat,
which was made at the tailor's. Very much to
my surprise, I succeeded in packing all my clothes
into a small hair trunk, which had been a travelling
companion of my father's many years before; the
corners of it were secured with strong iron clamps,
and the top was studded with my initials in brass
nails; altogether, I thought it made a very grand
appearance, and felt very proud of it. All things
being prepared, the night before my departure was
spent in talking over with my parents and sister
the great things that I was to accomplish in the
world; and every moment I felt myself increase
in importance, as the time drew near when I
should not only be uncontrolled in my actions,
but should also have the care of making provision
for my own wants.</p>

<p>As you, gentle reader, have no doubt known
the sad feelings of one who leaves his home for
the first time, it would be superfluous to relate
what mine were on this melancholy occasion.
Were I a poet, or, indeed, had I any other object
in view than simply to make a record of my adventures,
this would afford me an excellent opportunity
for dilating to the very edge of endurance
upon this most interesting period of a man's life.
But I shall spare the reader any further reflections
on this momentous occasion; and in the next chapter,
we will take our seats together in the stage
coach, and so proceed on.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>The departure and the journey.</p>

</div>

<p>THE day had just begun to show itself in the
east, when the rattling of wheels was heard approaching
nearer and nearer, and presently the
shrill notes of the stage driver's tin horn saluted our
ears. It was the signal for me to get ready, and
I obeyed it as well as I could; but my eyes were
so blinded with tears, I could scarcely see to do
any thing. I kissed my mother and sister again
and again; and when the coach stopped at the
door, I was ready with my trunk, and prepared to
step in. My father alone had followed me out,
and while the driver was securing my baggage,
he took my hand, and gave me a few words of
advice.</p>

<p>"Your mother, Harry," said my worthy parent,
"is, of course, entitled to your affection, and it is
your duty to obey her in all things, as the good
book says; but, you must be aware, that women
are not the fittest persons in the world to give advice
to young men on their entrance into the
world; therefore, when her advice comes in opposition
to mine, your own good sense will tell you
that mine is entitled to your first consideration.
Never, my son, be ashamed or afraid of speaking
to any body, either to solicit a favor, or for any
other purpose; bear in mind that men are but
men, and there is no station whatever can make
more of them; we are all very much alike, and
you can judge from your own feelings that there
is no man so good as not to feel secretly flattered
by the attention of any body who will notice him.
And let me once more remind you never to eat
an egg out of a tumbler; nature, my son, has bestowed
more care upon eggs than upon her other
productions, and has furnished in their shells the
vessels out of which they should be eaten."</p>

<p>The driver having strapped on my baggage,
my father put a small roll of bank bills into my
hand, saying it was all he had to give me, and
that I must use it with discretion. I squeezed his
hand in reply, jumped into the coach, and the next
minute I was fairly on my journey. The first
bound of the coach imparted life to my feelings,
and I should very soon have been in a high state
of excitement, but we soon came to a dead halt at
the post office, where we were kept waiting half an
hour or more for the post master to make up his
mail bags. At length the mail bags were ready,
and again we started, and again we stopped; it
was at the tavern, and here we were forced to
wait another half hour for the driver to get his
breakfast. The passengers all kept their seats,
and some of them grew very impatient at the delay.
One threatened to write an article and put
into the papers, and others proposed appointing a
committee to wait on the driver, and request him
to hurry with his breakfast; but while they were
debating the matter, he made his appearance with
a cigar in his mouth; but instead of jumping on
to the box, as he ought, he stood talking quite
composedly with the hostler about his horses. A
little gentleman who sat along side of me, dressed
in a satinett frock coat and a white cravat, put his
head out of the window, and spoke to the driver.</p>

<p>"Capting," said the passenger, "I wish you
would be so good as to let us be going, if you
please."</p>

<p>"O, I presume there's no occasion for hurrying,"
said the driver. "Yes there is though, you
pisen critter," said another passenger, "for I shall
have a note protested if I don't get to Simpsonville
before three o clock."</p>

<p>But the impatience of the passengers had but
little effect upon the driver, who continued to puff
his cigar, and talk to the hostler; when he did
mount the box, however, truth compels me to say
that he drove in handsome style. Good humor
was soon restored among all the passengers but
one, a very pale faced man, with a bombazine
stock, who remarked that whoever served the public,
whether he held the reins of government or of
a stage coach, ought never to be behind the
wishes of his employers.</p>

<p>"No politics if you please, mister," said a red
faced gentleman; upon which the discontented
passenger drew his chin within the circumference
of his bombazine stock, and said not a word.</p>

<p>This was the first coach I had ever seen the inside
of, and it appeared to be a very grand affair.
The cushions were stuffed very curiously with spiral
wires, and some of them had worked through
the leather, and at every jolt of the carriage they
scratched me very unpleasantly, besides making a
rent in my trowsers, which I could not very well
conceal. The gentleman who sat behind me said
his great objection to wire cushions was, that they
attracted the electric fluid in a thunder storm. But
I was glad to observe from the bright face of the
sky, that there was no danger of a storm before
our journey would be at an end. There were just
nine passengers, and but one female among them;
she sat opposite to me on the front seat, but as she
wore a green hood, I had not been able to catch a
glimpse of her face. A very finely dressed young
gentleman sat next to her, and from his magnificent
appearance, I set him down for the governor's
son at the least; for I had then no idea of the
cheapness of finery, or that a governor's son could
dress in any other than the very genteelest clothes.
He wore a lilac calico shirt, with a little ruffle
bristling in the bosom, and a cameo breast-pin almost
as large as a saucer; he appeared quite unconscious
of there being any body in the coach
besides himself, for he amused himself by whistling
a tune, and occasionally tapping the side of his
long nose with a little ebony stick which he carried
in his hand. After we had travelled some
distance, he turned to the young lady, and asked
her if she didn't consider Bulwer a very powerful
writer.</p>

<p>The young lady raised her head, so that I
caught a glimpse of her face, and replied in the
sweetest, gentlest voice I had ever heard, that she
had never read his works.</p>

<p>"What! never read Pelham," exclaimed the
magnificent gentleman, in apparent astonishment.</p>

<p>"I have not, indeed," replied the young lady,
more sweetly, if possible, than before.</p>

<p>"Then I pity you," said the supposed governor's
son.</p>

<p>As this remark seemed expressive of disrespect
for the young lady, I thought I had a right to resent
it, for I had conceived a liking for her the
moment she spoke.</p>

<p>"I have not read Bulwer either," I said smartly.</p>

<p>"Then I pity <i>you</i>" said the gentleman.</p>

<p>I felt highly indignant at this cool reply, but I
remembered the advice which my father gave me,
never to speak when I was in a passion, and so I
bit my lips and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Is Pelham a good thing?" inquired one of
the passengers.</p>

<p>"It's splendid," replied the gentleman; "so
sentimental."</p>

<p>After this, there was a good deal of conversation
on various subjects among my fellow travellers,
all of which I remember very distinctly, for
I noted the leading ideas at the time in my memorandum
book; but as I have doubts about its
possessing much interest for the general reader,
I shall relate no more of it.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind to be very polite to the
young lady on the very first occasion which should
offer; but, when we stopped at the Eagle Tavern
to dine, instead of helping her out of the carriage,
my attention was so completely absorbed by the
exhibition of a monstrous circus handbill, that I
left that delicate duty to be performed by the Lambert-like
landlord of the tavern. As I stood gazing
with intense curiosity at the grotesque figure
of the clown in the handbill, somebody struck me
a smart blow with a rattan across my shoulders,
which caused them to smart not a little, and turning
around briskly, I perceived it was the finely
dressed gentleman with the calico shirt, who had
given me this gentle tap; I felt strongly disposed
to be angry, but as he seemed to consider it a
good joke, I thought it was one of the ways of
the world; and I remembered that my father had
told me, that if I set myself up in opposition to
them, I should have a rough time of it.</p>

<p>"Come, Colonel," said the gentleman, slapping
me on the shoulder, "what'll you take?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I thank you," I replied, "I have
taken enough already."</p>

<p>"What! don't you liquorate?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, for I did not exactly understand
him.</p>

<p>"Don't drink, hey?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," I answered.</p>

<p>"What! temperance man? Signed a pledge?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not signed a pledge not to drink."</p>

<p>"Then you shall take a horn, so come along."</p>

<p>And so saying, he dragged me up to the bar.
"Now what'll you take? julep, sling, cocktail, or
sherry cobbler?"</p>

<p>"Any thing you choose," I replied, for I had
not the most remote idea what the drinks were
composed of which he enumerated.</p>

<p>"Then give us a couple of cocktails, bar-keeper,"
said the gentleman, "and let us have them as
quick as you damn please, for I am as thirsty as
the great desert of Sahara, which old Judah Paddock
travelled over."</p>

<p>I was shocked to hear such language from a
gentleman who dressed so genteely, and who professed
to be an admirer of Bulwer; but I kept
my thoughts to myself, and watched the bar-keeper
as he mixed the cocktails: they were a mixture
of gin and water, and sugar and nutmeg, and a
few drops of a red liquid, which he poured out of
a little cruet like an ink bottle with a quill stuck
in the cork.</p>

<p>My companion tossed off his cocktail almost
at a single swallow, smacked his lips, and pronounced
the gin damn'd splendid. But the splendor
of the gin proved too much for my unpractised
throat, for in my attempt to imitate my companion
in pouring down the cocktail, it almost took away
my breath, which gave the black hostler and the
bar-keeper such lively pleasure that they came near
laughing themselves into convulsions.</p>

<p>The bell soon rang for dinner, and I followed
my fellow traveller into the dining room, and took
a seat at table by the side of a jolly looking double-chinned
gentleman, who, as he drew his chair
up with one hand, reached out the other and
seized a covered dish, one half the contents of
which he emptied into his own plate; and I emptied
the remainder into mine.</p>

<p>"That's right," said the double-chinned gentleman,
"always eat oysters at a place like this,
because you can eat them quick; no bones to
bother you, toast soft, too, nice and brown.
What's that, mace? mace, I declare! Capital!
What a fat one! it just fills up the mouth, touches
all the organs of taste at the same time, and leaves
nothing to be desired. Delicious! what a fat
one! Lovely! I knew a man once, an acquaintance
of mine&mdash;first rate, ain't they?&mdash;an
acquaintance of mine who&mdash;best stew I ever sat
down to!&mdash;'quaintance of mine who&mdash;lovely!&mdash;most
expeditious eater I ever knew; never was
gone from his store more than fifteen minutes to
his dinner; in twelve months eat himself into dyspepsia;
next twelve, into consumption; travelled
on a railroad for his health; next twelve months
on his way to kingdom come in his grave."</p>

<p>"He was expeditious," I said, drawing a long
breath, and laying down my spoon as I finished
the last oyster upon my plate. The double-chinned
gentleman finished his at the same moment,
although he had been talking all the while,
and I had not spoken a word.</p>

<p>"Very, <i>in</i>deed," he said, in reply to my remark,
"very expeditious. He lived wretchedly,
but he died rich."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," he repeated; "why he was president
of a bank; poor fellow, indeed! he left a
great estate. But don't waste time; let me help
you to a piece of this steak; how do you like it?
speak quick."</p>

<p>"I have no choice, I thank you, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"What, no choice, no choice, bless me!"</p>

<p>"None, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, my friend, do allow me the pleasure of
choosing for you. What a steak! how rich! what
juice!"</p>

<p>The ejaculations of my jolly companion, and
the sight of the juicy steak, caused my mouth to
overflow.</p>

<p>"<i>De</i>licious, ain't it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Very indeed, very, how tender; what bread!
Salt, sir?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Stop a moment, don't disturb it; let me tell
you a secret. When you sit down at a table, always
look at the salt first; you will find it a sure
index of the quality of the fare, nine times out of
ten. Never knew it to fail. Now look at this,
ain't it a gem? none of your finical flutings and
notchings about it; but a piece of plain unpretending
glass, polished like a diamond. How
nicely it is filled, how smooth and white on its
surface: it looks like a piece of alabaster inserted
in a crystal. How fine and spotless! look, it
scarce touches the steak before it is dissolved; not
a particle of it will grate against your teeth, but
its delicate flavor will gratify your palate without
your being at all aware that you owe an exquisite
enjoyment to so common an article as salt. See,
the little heap on the side of your plate looks like
a snow flake just fallen."</p>

<p>"Salt is certainly a great thing," said the gentleman
with the lilac shirt, who sat opposite, and
who had been listening, with his knife and fork
suspended, to the remarks of my double-chinned
friend.</p>

<p>"'Tis indeed, a very great thing, very <i>in</i>deed."

<p>"Quite an article of commerce," said the other.
"I shouldn't wonder if Congress laid a duty
upon it."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," replied the jolly gentleman,
winking slyly at me.</p>

<p>"Where on earth does salt come from?"</p>

<p>"Knowing, ain't he?" said the jolly gentleman,
aside to me.</p>

<p>"Quite an extensive assortment on the table,"
remarked the elegantly dressed gentleman, apparently
ambitious of being noticed by the double-chinned
gentleman. But his sagacious remark
gained him no further notice from the object of
his attention, for just at that moment the tin trumpet
of the driver was heard, and a general rush
took place from the dinner table to the bar-room,
and after paying half a dollar a piece for our dinner,
we scrambled into the stage again; the young
lady, I blush while I write it, was handed in by
the driver, after all were seated.</p>

<p>"Do you know the name of that individual
who helped you to steak?" asked the supposed
governor's son in a whisper.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, I do not," I replied; "do you?"</p>

<p>"I know him all to pieces," replied the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Who is he; some great man?"</p>

<p>"He is so. He is the celebrated Mr. Bulbief,
the importer of spool cottons."</p>

<p>I looked again at Mr. Bulbief, but he had covered
his face with his pocket handkerchief, and
was apparently sound asleep. I should soon have
dropped asleep myself&mdash;but I sat on the middle
seat, with a gentleman each side of me, who commenced
smoking segars, very much to my annoyance.
I thought it was ungentlemanly, and I had
a good mind to have told them so, for the smoke
made me deadly sick; but I bore in mind my father's
saying, "that in private, as well as in public,
the will of the majority ought to be the law, even
though the minority suffer in consequence;" and
I bore the nauseous smoke from principle as long
as I could, for I supposed there was a point of endurance,
beyond which rebellion would be justifiable.
When they lighted fresh cigars, I ventured to hint
that the smoke might not be agreeable to the
young lady. Whereupon one of the smokers replied,
"that he would not smoke another cigar if it
was productive of the least discomfort to her; but
he presumed the fragrance was rather pleasant
than otherwise, as he smoked none but the best regalias,
which cost him three cents apiece."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to deprive the gentleman of
a pleasure," replied the young lady, very much
to my mortification.</p>

<p>"I thought so," replied the smoker, lighting
another cigar.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>The Steamboat.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was dark when we reached the landing place
on the river, and we had but just time to get our
baggage on to the dock, before we heard the distant
ringing of the steamboat bell, which was soon
followed by the noise of her wheels splashing in
the water, and the hissing of the steam, and then
the boat herself came in sight, vomiting forth
smoke and fire. It was the first steamer I had
ever seen, and the dim outline of her huge form,
partially illuminated by the lights on her deck, as
she floated past on the dark bosom of the river,
filled my mind with extravagant and grotesque
ideas of her size and shape. As I stood gazing
at her with absorbing curiosity, a small boat suddenly
darted up to the dock with the velocity of
lightning, the sparkling white foam rising from
her bows like a snow drift. Two men jumped on
to the dock, and began to throw the baggage into
the boat, and one by one, my companions in
travel all disappeared. I was completely bewildered,
and at a loss what to do with myself.</p>

<p>"Bear a hand," cried a gruff voice from the
boat, "or you'll be left."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get in, boss?" said one of the
men on the dock.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can," I replied, looking
over the end of the wharf. Without more ado,
somebody gave me a push, and I tumbled headlong
into the boat; fortunately, I lighted upon a
heap of carpet bags, and although I was not much
hurt, I was most terribly frightened. The boat
was drawn with amazing velocity through the water,
and we were very soon alongside of the steamer.
The passengers scrambled on board, but as
I had so far recovered my senses as to perceive
my beautiful fellow traveller sitting in the stern
of the boat, I resolved not to let this last opportunity
escape of showing my gallantry, and seeing
somebody near her, I stepped briskly past, and
asked her if I should have the pleasure of assisting
her out of the boat; she thanked me very
sweetly, and took hold of my extended hand; but
as I stepped back my foot slipped, and I fell my
whole length in the bottom of the boat. When
I got upon my feet again, she was gone. I hobbled
on board the steamer, but I could see nothing
of her; I had caught her pocket handkerchief
in my fall, and as I could not find her to restore
it, I put it into my pocket, to keep in remembrance
of her.</p>

<p>The deck of the steamboat was crowded with
passengers, and a little bow-legged negro was running
about, with a bell in his hand, crying out,
"passengers what hasn't paid his passages ull
please call to the capn's office and set-tel." So
I obeyed the call of the little negro, and having
paid my passage, I ascended a pair of stairs close
by, and found myself alone on the upper deck.
There was no moon, but the stars were shining in
all their brightness and beauty, and by their light
I could trace the outline of the banks of the river,
which rose high above my head in black and in
distinct masses. The water looked black and cold,
and the night wind was damp and chilly. Below,
all was light and life; but here, a step removed, all
was solitary, dark, and still. I took the handkerchief
of my beautiful fellow-traveller from my pocket
and kissed it, and pressed it to my heart; I felt
very grand, and clasped my hands together, and
looked up to the stars, but blushed as the thought
crossed my mind, that they might be intelligent existences,
which were looking down into my breast,
and reading my thoughts.</p>

<p>I now felt that I was in reality afloat upon the
wide world, ignorant of its ways, with no definite
object of pursuit, and with but slender means of
support. I thought of my mother and sister, and
my eyes filled with tears. Vague and indistinct
apprehensions of evil rushed through my mind,
and I looked forward to the termination of my
journey, and the return of day, with dread. And
then I called to mind the scornful prediction of my
proud cousin, and the feelings it awakened absorbed
all others. I threw my hands above me with
a feeling of confidence and pride, and I vowed
never to despair, nor to slacken in my exertions,
until I had attained to wealth and fame, and proved
my haughty cousin a liar.</p>

<p>To prevent a return of dull and gloomy forebodings,
I left the upper deck, and found my way
down into the cabin, where the brilliancy and
gayety of the scene completely staggered me; so
great was the change from darkness and solitude,
to light and revelry. The cabin was crowded with
passengers; some were lolling on the sofas; some
were reading; but the greater part were clustered
around the card tables, where they were playing
for money. My fellow traveller in the lilac shirt
was dealing out the cards at one of these tables,
and after dealing them round for a few times, he
exclaimed, "vantoon," and without more ceremony,
he caught up a little heap of sixpences and shillings,
and rose up from the table; and seeing me
standing by, took me by the arm, and would make
me drink with him at the little bar at one end of
the cabin; and then we went on deck together,
when he pulled out his pocket book, and asked me
to accept his card; it was as follows:</p>

<p><img src="fig01.png"/></p>

<p>I read this card over and over several times before
I could exactly understand its import; but the
thought occurred to me that it was intended for an
introduction, and that my new friend must be Mr.
Lummucks. I felt very much embarrassed, for I
had no card of my own to return, and I was at a
loss how to make myself known to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lummucks, I presume?" I said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the gentleman, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>"I have no card about me," I said, "but my
name is Franco."</p>

<p>"Mr. Franco, how do you do," said Mr. Lummucks,
taking my hand and shaking it very warmly,
as though he had met with an old friend after a
long separation, "I am very happy to see you."</p>

<p>"I am very well, I thank you, sir," I replied,
with as much solemnity as though I had an insurance
upon his life, "how is your health?"</p>

<p>So our introduction being over, we talked quite
freely again, and I thought Mr. Lummucks was
the noblest hearted, the genteelest, and the finest
fellow breathing; and I looked upon it as a very
favorable omen, that I should in the very outset of
my career, gain the friendship of so fine a gentleman.
Finding that I was unacquainted in New
York, he invited me to go with him to the City
Hotel, where he lived. I promised to do so, and
we parted for the night.</p>

<p>Being tired and sleepy, I went down into the
cabin again to go to bed, but to my amazement, I
found not only all the berths occupied with sleepers,
but all the settees, and chairs, and tables. I looked
all about, but I could find no vacant spot to
stretch myself out upon. The cabin was very warm,
and the air disagreeable, and the music of three or
four hundred men snoring in concert, was any
thing but pleasant. I went on deck again, and
having found a vacant place, I spread out my plaid
cloak and lay down to sleep. Seeing something
round and glossy near me, and supposing it to be
a pumpkin, I rested my head upon it for a pillow,
and should very soon have been fast asleep, but for
the difficulty of keeping it steady. It kept rolling
away from under my head, till at length I caught
hold of it with both hands, determined, if possible,
to keep it still.</p>

"Murdther! murdther! murdther!" cried out a
voice close by my ear. I started up affrighted, and
half a dozen men, in red shirts and begrimed faces,
came running to the place where I lay, when I discovered
by the light of a lantern, which one of
them carried, that the pumpkin which I had been
trying to keep under my head, was the bald pate
of a drunken deck passenger. When I had succeeded
in convincing the men that I had no murderous
designs upon the deck passenger, I crept
away to another part of the boat, and was soon
fast asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke, it was broad day light, the boat
had arrived at the wharf, and the passengers were
hurrying ashore; I jumped up and rubbed my
eyes, very much alarmed, for fear that Mr. Lummucks
had gone off and left me; but luckily I
found him, and he called a coach, and we rode up
to the City Hotel together, where I was accommodated
with a room in the fifth story; it was a weary
long way up to it, and when I got there, I felt no
disposition to go down again. I had never been
so far from the earth before.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>My first dinner at a Hotel, and the consequences of taking wine
too freely.</p>

</div>

<p>HAVING thrown myself upon the bed, I slept until
the bell summoned me to dinner. I dressed myself,
and hurried down to the dining room; and seeing
at a glance that there was no standing upon
ceremony, took a seat at one of the long tables,
which were spread the whole length of a very long
room. I eat a plate of black looking soup which
was placed before me, and then waited to be helped
to something else, but nobody spoke, nor even
looked at me. There was a constant shouting of
"waiter! waiter! waiter!" and a confused noise
of the popping of corks, the rattling of dishes, and
the smacking of lips, enough to have confused my
senses, if they had not been sharpened by hunger.
The gentleman who sat at my left hand, was a lank
cadaverous looking personage, with long black
hair, and keen glossy eyes; he wore a white cambric
cravat, tied in a large bow knot in front, the
projecting points of which had intercepted not a
few droppings of tobacco juice; he spoke in a
drawling effeminate voice, but in a peremptory
manner, to a stout negro man who stood behind
his chair, and jumped at his commands with the
greatest alacrity, while I could not get a waiter to
listen to me. There was a decanter of wine standing
between this gentleman's plate and mine, with
a piece of paper stuck round the neck, on which
was marked No. 49, which I took for the number
of the cask out of which it was drawn.</p>

<p>Finding that nobody was disposed to help me
to anything to eat, I thought I would help myself
to something to drink. "Is this Madeira?" I
asked of my left hand neighbor, pointing to the
decanter.</p>

<p>"I imagine not, Sir," he replied sharply; "I
kind o'reckon its sherry."</p>

<p>"Is it indeed," I said; "then I will try a glass of
it in remembrance of my father, for I have often
heard him say that sherry was his favorite wine."
So I filled my glass, and drank it off with a good
relish, for it was smooth and finely flavored.</p>

<p>"That's right cool," said my neighbor, fixing
his keen eyes upon me.</p>

<p>"Yes it is," I replied; "I guess it has been iced.
I believe I shall try another glass." And so I
took hold of the decanter again to help myself,
upon which the sallow faced gentleman started
upon his feet, and squealed out, "You infernal
son of a northern abolitionist, I will teach you to
drink a gentleman's wine;" and at the same time
seizing a table knife, he made a pass at me, which
I fortunately dodged, and seized hold of the decanter
of wine, and aimed a blow at his head,
which would infallibly have cracked his skull, had
not the big negro interposed his head, and caught
the decanter in its descent upon his own wool,
thereby saving his master's head, but not his wine,
for the decanter was shivered into a thousand pieces,
and its contents flew over me and my antagonist.
My next impulse was to lay hold of a dish
of cranberry sauce, with which I might have
been more successful than with the decanter, but
before I had time to reach out my hand, I was
surrounded by a dozen, or more, men, who caught
hold of me, and dragged me out of the room, amid
a wild uproar of voices, which sounded in my ears
like the yells of demons. They dragged me
through the hall into a small room adjoining, two
having hold of my collar, and a stout fellow
hold of each arm. Some eight or ten men followed
into the room, and then one of them stood
with his back against the door to keep the others
from crowding in. Somebody on the outside
knocked and kicked very hard against the door,
and demanded entrance on the score of his being
one of the gentlemen of the press. But the man
who was guarding the door refused to move, and
the gentleman of the press on the outside gave
another savage kick, and swore that the public
should be informed of the outrage it had suffered,
in the disrespect shown to his person.</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen who were admitted into
the room, was an elderly man with gold spectacles,
and a high bald forehead; they called him
"judge;" his heavy black eyebrows, and a protuberant
under lip, gave his face an expression of
sternness, and I trembled as he bent his eyes upon
me. He took a piece of paper and a pencil out
of his pocket, and asked me my name, and where
was from; but I was so terrified I could make
no reply to him, but burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, sir," said the judge,
quietly; "nobody shall harm you, unless indeed
you deserve it very richly, which I am inclined to
believe is not the case."</p>

<p>After a few sobs, which I could not suppress, I
told the judge my name, where I was from, and
the particulars of the affray, without being at all
aware of the offence I had committed.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared the judge, as I concluded
my account; "I see through it all, I think;
you did not attempt, then, to entice away the gentleman's
slave?"</p>

<p>"A slave!" I exclaimed, in amazement, "I
never saw a slave in my life."</p>

<p>"Well, well; but how is this, colonel?" said
the judge, addressing one of the gentlemen, "you
said you could swear you saw the young man put
a tract into the nigger's hand."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I mought never see ole Virginny
agin, if I couldn't a took a right smart oath I seen
him do it, any how; but praps I was mistaken, it
mought a been a napkin."</p>

<p>"Very likely it was," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Hows'ever," said the colonel, "I'll take my
oath I seen him, if you wish; but as the young
gentleman says himself he didn't done it, I reckon
I might as well not."</p>

<p>"So I reckon," said the judge. "Well, gentlemen,"
he continued, "I think you must be pretty
well satisfied of the young gentleman's innocence."</p>

<p>"O, perfectly," they all replied, without appearing
to have any will of their own about the
matter.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied if you is, judge," said the colonel,
"but as you and I were at college together,
I should like just to swear to something to oblige
you."</p>

<p>The judge thanked him for his kind feelings,
but said there was no particular occasion just
then.</p>

<p>For my own part, my amazement and terror
increased ever moment, and I was expecting to
hear sentence of death pronounced upon me, when
the judge cleared up all the mystery which hung
about the proceedings. "Let me advise you, Mr.
Franco," said the judge kindly, "the next time
you feel an inclination for a glass of sherry, to
call for a bottle yourself, and not to drink another
gentleman's, unless he should offer it to
you. I don't know what the custom may be where
you were raised, but such things won't do down
south. That gentleman whose wine you made
free with with, was no less a person than the Honorable
Sylvanus Spliteer, the celebrated southern
orator, and these gentlemen are his particular
friends, who, hearing something said about abolitionists,
for their ears are very quick to catch
any thing that is said on that subject, and seeing
you and the orator in an antagonistic position,
they very naturally concluded that you were trying
to entice away his black boy, who was waiting
upon him at table."</p>

<p>I did not think the conclusion was a very natural
one, by any means, but I felt no inclination to
dispute the point.</p>

<p>"But I am very happy to find that all the difficulty
has arisen from a very natural mistake of
yours, in supposing that the wine upon the dinner
table, like the brandy and the butter, was for the
benefit of the public."</p>

<p>Although the explanation of the judge had relieved
my fears, yet I felt so mortified and abashed,
in finding that I had been guilty of a gross breach
of good manners, that my face burned with shame,
and I could not raise my eyes from the floor. But
one of the gentlemen having stepped out of the room,
returned again, bringing Mr. Spliteer himself with
him, who having heard all the particulars, shook
me heartily by the hand, and insisted on my returning
to table, and drinking a bottle of wine
with him. The judge, and the colonel, and the
other gentlemen, said they would join us, and of
course I could not refuse so kind an invitation; so
we all returned to the dining room, where, as the
orator himself expressed it, the remainder of the
afternoon was spent with "a perfect looseness."</p>

<p>I must confess that, after this, the titles of judge
and colonel lost something more than half their
awe inspiring influence over me; for such songs,
and such speeches, as came from the mouths of
these gentlemen, I never listened to before nor since.
Even the orator himself outdid the colonel. The
other gentlemen, one of whom was a doctor, and
another a major, told several stories, and related
circumstances which they swore had happened to
themselves, although I had read of the same things
in an almanac when I was a little boy, and I remembered
that my grandmother told me they had
happened when she was a girl. I have no distinct
recollections of the manner in which the dinner
terminated; but I remember very vividly, that I
found myself, the next morning, lying on my
chamber floor, with a burning thirst, and a violent
pain in my head.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>Shows with what ease a man may enter into a commercial
speculation, when he has the means and the inclination so
to do.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD as yet seen nothing of the city; so after
breakfast, not being able to find my good friend Mr.
Lummucks, I ventured to take a stroll through
Broadway alone, to see the sights, and put myself
in the way of fortune. I had not rambled far,
when I caught sight of a little red flag hanging
upon a pole which was stuck out of a shop door,
and hearing a man talking very loud inside, I stepped
in, to see what was going on.</p>

<p>It was a little narrow place, hung round with
lithographic prints, and double barrelled rifles, and
duelling pistols, and other works of art, both instructive
and destructive. There was a counter
in the centre of the shop, and at one end of it, elevated
on a high stool, stood a little bald headed man,
with protuberant black eyes and prominent front
teeth. He had a little ivory hammer in his hand,
which he flourished about with great earnestness,
crying out all the while, "a hof, a hof, a hof, a
hof," till at last he struck the counter fiercely
with it, and said, "Mr. Smit takes the lot at
eighteen and a hof." There were two or three
gentlemen standing about the counter, but I could
not discover that they took the slightest interest in
what was going on.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said the man with the ham
mer, "I will give you very great pleasure; you
shall all bless your lucky stars, which has superinduced
you to enter this store at this present time.
I shall now, gentlemen, put up lot number twenty
one, and it must be sold to the highest bidder,
pos-i-tive-ly&mdash;it must indeed, upon my honor.
Here, gentlemen, is something worthy the very
highest consideration of connoisseurs, amateurs,
and epicures; it is indeed. You see, gentlemen,
it is a most magnificent rose wood casket, all inlaid
with the mother of pearls and divers other waluable
minerals, very rare to be got or obtained. But,
gentlemen, before I open this casket, and dazzle
your precious eyes with the contents thereof, let
me tell you its history.</p>

<p>"This casket, gentlemen, is the property of a
wirtuous young orphan lady, which lives in the upper
part of the city, who is reduced to the unfortunate
extremity of disposing of a part of her personal
effects, because she done so many charitable
acts to the poor, and therefore it must be sold.
Why don't you bid!"</p>

<p>So saying, he opened the casket, and emptied
its contents on to the counter; they consisted of a
necklace, a pair of ear rings, a silver bodkin, a
needle case, a musical snuff-box, and a cameo
breast pin. They all looked bright and new, and
for aught that I could discover, were none the
worse for wear.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen," exclaimed the little man,
flourishing his hammer, "why don't you bid! I
shan't take offence at any thing, say two hundred;
one hundred; any thing to start with; say fifty dollars;
the casket alone is worth five times the money.
Any gentleman as wants to make an operation, has
now a beautiful opportunity to make four or five
hundred dollars, by purchasing this splendid article.
Hasn't he, Mr. Isaacs?"</p>

<p>"You may well say that, Mr. Shooda," said
the gentleman addressed; "any shentleman is a
fool which doesn't buy that bargain at any price."</p>

<p>The demon of avarice whispered in my ear that
now was my time to turn a penny, and I resolved
to bid for the casket, and so lay the foundation of
my fortune. And then the blood rushed to my
cheek at the base thought of taking the advantage
of a poor orphan girl's necessities to enrich myself;
and then I resolved I would do no such thing.
But as the auctioneer went on setting forth the
value of the casket, and the low price at which
he would sell it, I reasoned with myself thus: if I
do not buy the casket, another will; and if I do
buy it, and give more for it than another would, of
course I shall do a good deed, and while I enrich
myself, I shall benefit the poor orphan girl. And
then I thought it might possibly belong to the beautiful
young lady, my companion in the coach, for
whom I felt so great a regard, and if it should be
hers, with what pleasure I would restore it to her.
This last thought overcame all my scruples, and I
determined to buy the casket at all hazards.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to confess that, although these
thoughts did pass through my mind, still it was the
desire of gain that influenced me. So easy is it,
when we do a mean action, to flatter ourselves
that it is from good motives we do it.</p>

"Do you think he would take a bid of fifty
dollars?" I asked of the gentleman whom the
auctioneer addressed as Mr. Isaacs.</p>

<p>Mr. Isaacs had a nose both high and long, and
his eyes were very black, but large and heavy;
his hair was black and crispy, and he had a stoop
in his shoulders; he wore a blue frock coat, with
a black velvet collar, and altogether his dress had
a second hand appearance. Upon my putting
this question to him, he drew me aside, and whispering
in my ear, told me not to bid as high as fifty
at the first going off, although he didn't believe the
auctioneer would sell the casket for less than two or
three hundred dollars; and then, in a very solemn
manner, he advised me not to let the opportunity
slip of buying the casket. And he told me upon
his honor as a gentleman, that he would buy it of
me the very next day at just double the money
which I might give for it, if I should buy it, protesting
that he would bid it off himself, if he had
not left his pocket book at home.</p>

<p>So good an opportunity to make money, I was
fearful might not occur again very soon, and I
resolved to make the most of it. And according
to the advice of Mr. Isaacs, I bid thirty dollars for
the casket.</p>

<p>"For shame, for shame," exclaimed the auctioneer,
"to bid thirty dollars for a magnificent
article like this."</p>

<p>I blushed very red, and bid forty.</p>

<p>"Forty, forty, forty, forty, forty, and five, did
you say; five, five, five, five, five."</p>

<p>I did not hear any body bid five, but as the auctioneer
had said that nods and winks would
be taken as bids, I supposed that some gentleman
had given him a sly wink.</p>

<p>"Forty-five, forty-five, forty-five, forty-five, forty-five,
forty-five," he exclaimed with astonishing
rapidity, and just as he was on the point of letting
fall his hammer, I bid fifty.</p>

<p>"Fifty, fifty, fifty, fifty, fifty," he exclaimed
more than fifty times, my heart all the while beating
time to the flourishes of his hammer, till it
descended to the counter, and I found myself the
purchaser of the valuable casket, and its contents,
for the very small sum of fifty dollars. I paid for
it immediately, and to make sure of it, wrapped it
up in my pocket handkerchief, and tucked it under
my arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Isaacs said I had made a great purchase,
and tried to persuade me to stop and bid for some
thing else; but I was too much elated, and in too
great a hurry to get to my chamber, and glut my
eyes with my treasure.</p>

<p>As I left the store, I heard a loud whistle, and
suddenly turning my head, I perceived Mr. Isaacs
with his cheeks distended like a bladder, and his
broad lips screwed up like the mouth of a tightly
drawn purse, whistling with all his might; but
I was so eager to get to my chamber that I did
not turn back to inquire the cause of it.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>A school for morals, and the beginning of an adventure.</p>

</div>

<p>AT the tea table I met Mr. Lummucks; he had
heard of my encounter with the great orator from
the South the day before, and he laughed heartily
at my blunder, and said, if I would put myself
under his tuition, he would soon make a man of
me, and learn me what life was. By way of giving
me an introductory lesson, he said, I must go
to the theatre with him that evening; and as he
offered to pay for my ticket, I did not feel at
liberty to refuse.</p>

<p>As I had often heard the theatre spoken of as a
school for morals, I was not much surprised to
meet a good many people there whose morals
seemed to stand in need of a pretty severe schooling;
for my own part, I do not think my own
morals were much the better for any thing that I
saw or heard while there.</p>

<p>Mr. Lummucks said he was acquainted with all
the principal actors and actresses, and he promised
to take me behind the scenes, and introduce me
to some of them, but first he took me up two or
three flights of stairs into a long room with green
walls and red moreen curtains, with a bar at one
end, behind which were half a dozen yellow women
serving out cakes and coffee, and all manner
of liquors. There were a great many young ladies
moving about, some with gentlemen, and
some without, but all very gayly dressed, and very
free in their manners; indeed, one of them had
the boldness to ask me to treat her to an orange,
which I did, and then she asked me to treat her
to a glass of cordial, which I could not refuse to
do, because she was a lady, and I judged from
the familiar manner in which Mr. Lummucks
spoke to her, that she was an intimate acquaintance
of his. Another young lady came up to me,
and offered me her card, which I took, and promised
to call on her. Mr. Lummucks appeared to be
perfectly at home; he called one Bess, another
Sue, and another Liz. If this, I thought, is the
first lesson in life, I shall not be astonished at any
thing which I may meet with hereafter.</p>

<p>I heard a great clapping of hands and stamping
of feet, and as I began to grow tired of the
company I was in, I made an excuse that I wanted
to see the play; so I went out of the punch room
into the gallery to see what had called forth the
clapping of hands, and to take a lesson in morals.
On the stage, which was a long distance below
me, were a man and a woman singing with all
their might, with their hands stretched out as if
imploring mercy from the audience. He was tall
and thin, with sunken cheeks, which were, not
withstanding, very red; and she was short and
fat: they were both dressed in the strangest looking
clothes I had ever seen, but apparently very
richly. I listened attentively, but I could not understand
a word of the song, and the musicians
kept up such a noise I was hardly able to distinguish
the tune. I must acknowledge that I was
greatly disappointed in the exhibition; but it
would be wrong in me to condemn what I could
not understand, and, as some do, pronounce every
thing bad which is above my comprehension.</p>

<p>Not feeling any interest for the people on the
stage, I began to look around among the audience,
and soon discovered something more interesting
and beautiful than I had anticipated. There
were a great many ladies among the audience,
who, being dressed in gay clothes, gave a bright
and beautiful appearance to the theatre; but the
lights were so glaring, and the whole scene was so
strange to me, it was some time before I could look
composedly, and view in detail the lovely beings
who were clustered together in the circle below
me. When my eye had become more familiar
with the scene, and my perception keener, as I
glanced from group to group, my attention was
suddenly arrested by a beautiful girl, who sat in
the lower tier of boxes, dressed in white, and looking
like a lily in a bed of tulips. Upon looking
at her more attentively, I was electrified at discovering
in her my gentle companion of the stage
coach. It gave a momentary shock to my feelings
to find one whom I had, in imagination, invested
with a pure and holy character, breathing
the atmosphere of such a place; but descending to
the next tier of boxes, I took a seat opposite to her,
and soon became so completely absorbed in the
contemplation of her beauties, as to be insensible
to every thing else. She was very beautiful, and
having gazed on her for hours, I thought her image
was stamped upon my heart, and that it would
be ever present to the eyes of my mind; but when
I could see her no longer, and I tried to recall her
to my mind, it was in vain; I could only remember
that I had seen a being of light and loveliness,
but the form she wore had left no distinct impression
upon my memory.</p>

<p>She sat between an elderly gentleman, and a
lady apparently older than herself, to whom she
occasionally spoke; and I thought I could distinguish
the gentle tones of her voice above all the
noise of the orchestra and the hubbub of the pit.
When the performances were ended, I hurried
down to the lobby, that I might catch a parting
glimpse of her as she left the theatre. I saw her
come out leaning on the arm of the elderly gentleman
who sat by her side, and I got as close to
her as I dared, hoping to catch the sound of her
voice. They stood on the steps a few minutes,
until a carriage drove up, into which they got with
the other lady; the footman banged to the door
and got up behind, and away they drove. I stood
for a moment almost bewildered, and then darted
off in pursuit of the carriage; I ran with all my
might, and hard work I had to keep it in sight.
It was a weary long chase, up one street and down
another, till at length, when I was quite exhausted,
and scarcely able to move another step, the
sweat pouring from every pore in my body, and
my wind quite gone, it stopped in front of a brick
house opposite to a large square filled with trees.</p>

<p>The party got out of the carriage, and the old
gentleman handed the ladies up the steps of the
house. "Good night, uncle," said the youngest
lady, in a voice which I could have distinguished
among all the babel tongues of the world. "Good
night, Georgy, good night," said the old gentleman.
The door closed upon the ladies, and the
old gentleman stepped into the carriage again,
and drove off.</p>

<p>I sat down opposite to the house, under the
shade of the trees, to recover my breath; and
having rested myself, I very reluctantly quitted
the spot; but not until I had noted down the number
of the house, and read the name on the silver
door plate; it was simply, "Mrs. Smith."</p>

<p>It was past midnight when I got back to the
hotel, but I found Mr. Lummucks sitting in the
bar-room, drinking and smoking with two or three
bilious looking gentlemen, whom he introduced
to me as merchants from Mississippi. Mr. Lummucks
tried to make me sit down and smoke and
drink with them, but I resolutely refused, notwithstanding
the Mississippi merchants joined in the
request, promising me that they would tell me a
mighty big heap of good stories, and that the way
they would amuse me would be sinful to a christian.
But I was in a hurry to be alone in my
chamber, where I could shut my eyes upon the
world, and think only of her who had enchanted
me.</p>

<p>When I got to my chamber, I locked the door,
and took out the pocket handkerchief, of which I
had by a lucky accident become the possessor, and
having pressed it to my heart, spread it out for
examination, with the hope of discovering about
it some clue to the name of its owner. It was a
beautiful handkerchief; the material was of a
delicate texture, surpassing any thing of the kind
I had ever seen before; it was edged with broad
lace, and the corners were curiously embroidered
with fruits and flowers, the like of which I had
never seen in nature; on one of the corners was
a scroll, surrounded by a wreath of roses, and on
it was printed, in delicate little letters, "Georgiana
De Lancey." I pressed the name to my lips, and
kissed it a thousand times, and did many other
foolish things, till at last growing weary, I lay
down upon my bed with the handkerchief in my
hand, and dreamed that the lovely Georgiana was
hovering over me, poised in the air by a pair of
purple wings, the gentle motion of which fanned
the cool air across my brow.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>Getting into a Newspaper.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the course of my limited reading, I had met
with accounts of men who had become famous by
accident, and gained an immortality without having
labored for it; but, I had never, in my wildest
dreams, imagined that such a lot would be mine.
I did, indeed, indulge in the pleasing hope of
achieving fame and fortune, but I did not expect
to have notoriety thrust upon me at the very commencement
of my adventures.</p>

<p>The morning after my visit to the Theatre, I
was sitting in the bar room of the hotel, reading
the morning papers, when I was startled at seeing
my own name in print. The sensations which I
experienced on the occasion, can be imagined by
those who have found themselves unexpectedly in
a newspaper. I was seized with such a fit of
trembling, that it was some time before I could
gather my senses sufficiently together to enable
me to read the following article, which fully accounted
for the mark of distinction which had
been bestowed upon me.</p>

<p>"<i>Serious Affair</i>.&mdash;We have been at great pains
to gather the particulars of the late disgraceful
outrage at the City Hotel, knowing the anxiety
of the public mind in relation to this event, and
feeling the full weight of the responsibility which
rests upon our shoulders, as public journalists, to
furnish our subscribers,&mdash;who, we are proud to say,
are daily increasing, having added more than two
thousand to our lists within the last week, which
we happen to know, is more than the entire subscription
of any of our contemporaries,&mdash;with the
latest and most correct information.</p>

<p>"Now we distinctly charge, that our contemporary,
with whose vile name we will not soil our
columns, has presented his readers (?) with a garbled
and incorrect statement of the transaction
alluded to, notwithstanding he knew we were in
possession of the entire particulars of the affair,
which we had obtained at a great expense, and
with vast trouble. However, we feel ourselves
touched in a very tender point, and we shall condescend
to hold the wretch personally accountable;
and were it not beneath the character of a gentle
man to bandy terms of abuse with a blackguard,
we should call him an ingrained villain, a brute
dyed in the wool, a dirty contemptible creature
who could not speak the truth, though it were for
his interest to do so, and who never does stumble
upon it, unless he surreptitiously filches it from our
columns; but we will not make use of the homely
phrases of our vernacular; we forbear; we have
no wish to take the bread out of innocent lips.
We understand our contemporary has an interesting
family dependent upon him; but how he came
by any thing interesting, is to us a matter of astonishment,
and, indeed, we doubt the fact. We leave
the creature to work his own ruin, and hasten to
lay the particulars of this gross outrage before
our numerous readers, premising, merely, that a
paper is left at our office for signatures, requesting
the Mayor to call a meeting of our fellow citizens
to express their feelings on the subject.</p>

<p>"One of those pestiferous vermin, a travelling
abolitionist, by the name of Franco, had the unparalleled
audacity to enter the City Hotel
yesterday, and endeavor, by his damnable arts, to
entice away the faithful slave of the Honorable
Sylvanus Spliteer, the chivalric orator of the
South, who being at his dinner, and having just
finished a plate of oxtail soup, a delicacy than
which none know better how to concoct than the
worthy hosts of the City, and having taken a decanter
of sherry in his hand for the purpose of
taking wine with a distinguished Senator, and
perceiving an attempt made by the abolitionist to
force an incendiary pamphlet into the hands of his
honest negro, with that promptness peculiar to
southern climes, and with that indignant energy
with which the chivalry of the South defend their
rights, jumped from his seat, and, with unerring
aim, hurled the decanter at the head of the fanatic.
But unfortunately the decanter was shivered to
pieces instead of the head, and the shrivelled creature
got his hide well soaked with good wine, a
piece of good luck which, we will venture to assert,
never befel one of the fraternity before. We regret
to add, that Franco was allowed to escape
without farther chastisement.</p>

<p>"Now we sincerely deprecate any attempt at
violence or an infringement of the peculiar privileges
of the law, but there are cases, which of necessity
must occur, which call upon the high-souled
and the chivalrous to take the law into their own
hands, and inflict summary punishment. This
maybe one of those cases; we do not say it is, and
therefore if any violence should be committed, let
no one lay the blame at our door. We have not
recommended a coat of tar and feathers, neither
have we made any allusions to the salutary effects
of a ride upon a rail.</p>

<p>"Franco's first name, we gather from the books
of the Hotel, is Harry; he is a youngish person,
apparently not more than twenty-one, of a fair
complexion, light blue eyes, and chestnut hair. His
clothes are healthy in their appearance, that is,
they appear never to have suffered from a fit of
any kind."</p>

<p>Having always believed implicitly every thing
which I saw in print, I could hardly persuade myself
that I had not been guilty of the outrage of
which I saw myself accused. I felt all the shame,
at least, of a real culprit, and hung down my head
and pulled my hat over my eyes for fear of meeting
the scornful glances of the men who were moving
about me. I was terrified beyond measure at the
allusion to the coat of tar and feathers, and a ride
upon a rail. The prophecy of my haughty cousin
flashed across my mind, and now, I thought,
the time of its fulfilment had come. The unfeeling
allusion to my clothes filled me with indignation;
for my mother had exhausted her skill, and
her strength too, in making them, and I thought they
fitted me to a hair. I sat in a corner of the bar-room,
with apprehension, trembling and expecting every
moment that violent men would lay their hands
upon me, when I heard the voice of Mr. Spliteer
himself in the bar-room. I rose up, and with tears
in my eyes, showed him the paper, and begged him
to screen me from the threatened violence. He
read the article, and laughed heartily at it, which
I thought showed a great want of feeling in him;
but he could well afford to do so, for he got a
good deal of praise at my expense.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, young man," he said, "abuse
and misrepresentation are the unavoidable penalties
of newspaper notoriety. I have had a heap of
it in my day, I can assure you, and I care nothing
for it now; but I must confess it did grind me
at first no ways slow. As for tar and feathers, and
a ride upon a rail, don't care a fig about them;
there's not a bit of danger; nobody cares any
thing about a newspaper, for although there is
nothing which men read more eagerly, there is
nothing which they heed so little, not even their
Bibles. However, to make all sure, I will take it
upon myself to see the Editor, who is a personal,
as well as a political friend of mine, and to-morrow
you shall see that he will contradict every
word he has said to-day in relation to you. And
now, do me the favor to drink a julep with me,
and you will feel better, I dare say."</p>

<p>I thanked the honorable Mr. Spliteer for his
kindness, for I did not know how to refuse,
and I had, moreover, a curiosity to know
what a julep was. He gave the necessary orders
to the bar-keeper; and after a great display of
nutmeg graters and muddling sticks, and of sousing
and flourishing of tumblers by the latter gentleman,
the juleps were mixed; and the honorable
Mr. Spliteer himself reached me one of them, for
it would have been quite beneath the dignity of
the bar-keeper to have stooped so far below his
proper level as to have acted in the capacity of a
waiter. What the ingredients were of which the
juleps were composed I could form no idea; there
was a bunch of green mint in the tumbler, topped
off with a cap of snow, and a slender glass tube
was stuck in the middle. As I had never seen a julep
before, I watched the motions of the orator before
I touched the glass; he drew his tumbler up to him
and applied his mouth to the tube, and I did the
same.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of juleps?" he asked, taking
a long breath.</p>

<p>"Very," I replied, for I found it very palatable.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Mr. Spliteer, "I like them
because they are so wholesome."</p>

<p>"Are juleps healthy, then?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Very," he said, drawing another long breath.
"My father drank so many juleps, that when he
died the mint sprouted up all over his grave, and
one of these days you will see it growing on
mine."</p>

<p>"I hope not," I replied.</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed," said the chivalrous orator,
"why so?"</p>

<p>"Because," I answered, "I hope you will never
die."</p>

<p>"Good, good," he exclaimed, apparently highly
delighted, "right good, considering you tried
only yesterday to break my head with a decanter."</p>

<p>"You must expect when you take wine, that it
will get into your head," I replied.</p>

<p>"So I do," he said, "but not through my
skull." And then he laughed very heartily, and
I laughed too, and said a thousand other foolish
things. Having sucked the last drop out of our
tumblers, Mr. Spliteer ordered two more juleps,
and told the bar-keeper to make them stiff.</p>

<p>I have not a very clear recollection of what occurred
after drinking the second julep, neither do
I remember exactly how many I did drink; but I
know I felt very valiant and very witty, and that
I threw a tumbler at the head of the bar-keeper,
and told the honorable Mr. Spliteer that he looked
like a bilious baboon. And, I was afterwards
told, that I soon grew stupid and sleepy, and was
taken up into my chamber, and put to bed by some
of the waiters.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p>Recovering from a Julep.</p>

</div>

<p>HAD I been philosopher enough to have doubted
the truth of a spiritual existence independent of
the body, the effects of the juleps would have
cured me of skepticism forever. It is a curious
fact, that when the senses are benumbed with the
fumes of strong drink, and our limbs can no longer
perform their offices, and we fall down drunk,
stupid, insensible&mdash;our bodies deprived of all sense,
sympathy or feeling; when the noble mansion,
which was created for the in-dwelling of our immortal
spirit, has been prostrated by our own follies,
and become a mere heap of breathing matter,
and all of our faculties are benumbed by the
fumes of strong drink, and all of our sympathies,
and feelings, bodily and mental, are paralyzed
and drunken, then our souls, as if exulting in the
release, which our deadened bodies give them, or
as if ashamed of the disgraced habitations to
which their destiny has assigned them, spread out
their wings, and soar away to scenes where the
body is incapable of accompanying them. At
least such was the case with me, for although I
lay on my bed stupid and insensible as a log,
never before was my mind so actively employed
as then, and never did my fancy play such wild
and fantastic tricks, or bear me so high on her
wings, in my sober moments.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when I roused up,
and found myself upon my bed with my clothes all
on. It was a long while before I could convince
myself that I was not somebody beside myself,
and I should have rubbed my eyes and doubted
for a long time, had I not been impelled by a burning
thirst to go in search of water; luckily there
was a goblet full in my chamber, which I soon
emptied, and by degrees became convinced that
I was indeed nobody but myself; a very uncomfortable
conclusion to arrive at, for I should just
then have been glad to have been convinced that
I was anybody in the world besides myself, for I
felt very wretched. Although I soon established
my own identity, I could not easily separate and
distinguish the transactions of the past two days
from the transactions of my drunken visions.</p>

<p>My father was very particular, when I left home,
to caution me against eating an egg out of a wine
glass, but he never said a word about abstaining
from juleps. It was wrong in me to blame him
for my own misdeeds, but I could not help thinking,
that, if he had cautioned me against drinking,
I might have been spared the bitter feelings which
I then experienced. The prophetic words of my
cousin were constantly ringing in my ears, and
the reflection that I might, by my own folly, have
aided to bring on their fulfilment, filled me with
grief and shame. I had not yet done any thing
towards bettering my condition, and I made fresh
resolves not to let another day pass without making
a vigorous effort to obtain employment. But
the saddening thought came over me, that I was
without friends, and I knew not to whom I could
apply for help or advice, and I had not even fixed
in my own mind what kind of employment I should
seek. But I had met with nothing but kindness
thus far, and I felt assured that I should still meet
with kindness and polite treatment; for if men
would, when unsolicited, show me kindness and
favor, surely when I did solicit them they would
grant it more readily. Thus I reasoned with my
self, and very sound reasoning I thought it.</p>

<p>Of all the men whom I had seen, none had
treated me half so politely as Mr. Lummucks.
I never met him, but he would make me drink with
him; he slapped me across the shoulder with the
familiarity of a brother; he would make me go to
the Theatre with him, and he would pay for my
ticket; if I sat near him at table, he would send
me his wine, and after dinner he would offer me a
cigar, although I always refused it; he had given
me his card on board the steamboat, and he had
since pressed me to call at his store and see him.
What but the kindliest feelings, and the most generous
nature, could cause a man to show such civilities
to a stranger. Fortune, I thought, had
evidently thrown me in his way, and I determined
to second her endeavors to help me along, by
applying to him for assistance in procuring a
situation; and, I had not a doubt, but that a gentleman
of his benevolent feelings, would be very
glad of an opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>With these soothing and comfortable reflections,
I lay down again, to sleep off all effects of my
dissipation, that I might get up in the morning
refreshed and invigorated, and better prepared to
prosecute my schemes for defeating the malicious
prophecy of my cousin. And so I fell asleep, and
dreamed of my mother and sister, and of the
beautiful Georgiana. For all the cares and
anxieties and disappointments of this wicked
world, cannot deprive us of the privilege of visiting,
in our dreams, the gentle beings whom we love.</p>

<p>Tells of my reception by Mr. Lummucks, and of the manner
in which that polite gentleman answered my solicitations.</p>

</div>

<p>HAVING dressed myself in my very best clothes,
which, to tell the truth, were my very worst also,
I set out, soon after breakfast, in search of the
store of Messrs. J. Smith Davis &amp; Co., whose
names were on the card which Mr. Lummucks had
given me.</p>

<p>It was a bright and pleasant morning; the
streets were full of life and animation, and every
thing looked promising and joyous to me. Men
were hurrying past me in every direction, with
looks full of business and importance, and I
thought, where all seemed to be so well employed,
and in such haste, there could be no difficulty in
finding something to do. But, as I was not stinted
for time, I did not hurry myself, and walked
leisurely along beneath the awnings, stopping
occasionally to gaze at the heaps of goods which
were displayed in the stores, or to read some curious
sign which attracted my attention. After a
while I succeeded in finding Hanover Square,
which I was astonished to find was triangular in
shape, and soon discovered the large gilt sign of
Messrs. J. Smith Davis &amp; Co. Luckily, Mr.
Lummucks was standing in the door with his hat
off, and his hair brushed down smooth and glossy.
As soon as he saw me, he caught me by the hand,
and dragged me into the store.</p>

<p>"How are you this morning, Colonel?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Very well, I thank you," I replied, speaking
as respectfully as I knew how; "are you well?"</p>

<p>"Fine as silk," said Mr. Lummucks.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear him say so, and congratulated
myself upon finding him in such a pleasant
humor.</p>

<p>The store of Messrs. J. Smith Davis &amp; Co.
was not very large, but it was crowded with goods
to the very ceiling, and in the middle of the floor
were long piles of calicoes, about which were
several young gentlemen, as busily employed as
bees in a hive.</p>

<p>A very little man approached us from the further
end of the store, jerking his little arms and
legs with the precision and ease of an automaton.
His dress was new, and bright, and neat. Mr.
Lummucks introduced me to him. He was no
other than Mr. Smith Davis himself, the principal
of the firm. I was almost struck dumb to see so
much importance confined within so small a compass.
He shook me cordially by the hand, and
asked Mr. Lummucks if he knew me.</p>

<p>"Know him like a book," replied Mr. Lummucks.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith Davis shook me by the hand again,
and said he was very happy to see me; he asked
me how the times were, and offered me a cigar,
which I took for fear of giving offence, but the
first opportunity I got I threw it away.</p>

<p>"Buy for cash, or time?" he asked.</p>

<p>I was a little startled at the abruptness of the
question, but I replied, "for cash."</p>

<p>"Would you like to look at some prints, Major?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you," I replied, "I am
very fond of seeing prints."</p>

<p>With that, Mr. Smith Davis commenced turning
over one piece of calico after another, with
amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>"There, Major,&mdash;very desirable article&mdash;splendid
style only two-and-six; we done a first rate
business in that article last season; cheapest goods
in the street."</p>

<p>Before I could make any reply, or even guess
at the meaning of Mr. Davis's remarks, he was
called away, and Mr. Lummucks stepped up and
supplied his place.</p>

<p>"You had better buy 'em, Colonel," said Mr.
Lummucks, "they will sell like hot cakes. But
did you say you bought for cash."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said, "if I buy at all."</p>

<p>He took a memorandum book out of his pocket,
and looked in it for a moment.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said, "Franco, Franco,
Franco, what did you say your firm was, some
thing and Franco, or Franco and somebody?"</p>

<p>"I have no firm," I replied.</p>

<p>"O, you haven't, haven't you? all alone, hey?
but I don't see that I have got your first name down
in my tickler."</p>

<p>"My first name is Harry," I said.</p>

<p>"Right, yes, I remember," said Mr. Lummucks,
making a memorandum; "and your references,
Colonel, who did you say were your references?"</p>

<p>"I have no references," I replied, "indeed I
know of no one to whom I could refer, unless to
my father."</p>

<p>"What, the old boy in the country?"</p>

<p>"My father is in the country," I answered seriously,
not very well pleased to hear my parent
called the old boy.</p>

<p>"Then you have no city references, hey?"</p>

<p>"None at all, sir; I have no friends here except
yourself."</p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed Mr. Lummucks, apparently
in great amazement. "Oh, ah! But how much of
a bill do you mean to make with us, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may buy a vest pattern," I replied,
"if you have got some genteel patterns."</p>

<p>"A vest pattern," cried Mr. Lummucks, "what,
haven't you come down for the purpose of buying
goods?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "I came to New York to
seek for employment, and as you had shown me
so many kind attentions, I thought you would be
glad of an opportunity to assist me in finding a
situation."</p>

<p>Mr. Lummucks countenance underwent a very
singular change when I announced my reasons for
calling on him.</p>

<p>"Do you see any thing that looks green in
there?" he said, pulling down his eyelid with his
forefinger.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not," I replied, looking very earnestly
into his eye.</p>

<p>"Nor in there, either?" he said, pulling open
his other eye.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Mr. Lummucks; and with
out making me any other answer, he turned on his
heel and left me.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>A change of quarters, and a new friend.</p>

</div>

<p>I FOUND that the high rate which they charged
me for board at the hotel, would soon exhaust my
slender means, so I applied at a genteel boarding
house in Pearl street, kept by a Mrs. Griggs, and
agreed with her for a bed in a room with only five
other young gentlemen; the price which she asked
was something less than half what they charged at
the hotel. I was very glad to make the exchange,
for I was not only continually annoyed by the sight
of Mr. Lummucks, but by the frequent mention of
my ludicrous encounter with the Southern orator.</p>

<p>The first time I dined at Mrs. Griggs', I was
reminded of the advice given me by my fellow
traveller, about the salt cellar, for on casting my
eyes upon that piece of table furniture, I perceived
that it did not indicate a very sumptuous dinner:
it was a little gilt edged glass dish, with a piece
broken out of each corner, and its contents were
coarse and damp; consequently I was prepared to
find the soup cold, the mutton overdone, the vinegar
sweet, and the salad warm. But, thanks to the
poverty of my parents, I had learned to eat my
dinner without finding fault with its quality, always
satisfied if it was not deficient in quantity; and although
I flattered myself I could distinguish a good
meal from a poor one, I could be content with
either.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griggs' boarders were all young gentlemen,
fashionably dressed, apparently full of fun,
and with most excellent appetites. Their greatest
care seemed to be who should eat the greatest
quantity in the shortest space of time. I must confess
I could not but regard them with feelings of
envy, for they were mostly clerks in counting
houses and stores, and I knew it was employment
which gave them such light hearts and happy faces.
They were somewhat rude in their behavior, but,
as it was the rudeness of buoyant spirits, and not
of ill nature, there was nothing offensive about it.
A very tall young gentleman, with a ring on his
forefinger, and a gold chain round his neck, filled
the office of carver, and his perquisites of office
were, as a matter of course, sundry little pieces of
the outside, which he contrived very ingeniously
not to touch when he was helping round.</p>

<p>"Mister Barilla, will you, if you please, sir,"
said one of the young gentlemen to the carver, "be
so kind as to send me, per bearer, a small invoice
of that mutton?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity
of informing you, sir," said Mr. Barilla, "have
none remaining in first hands, but will be 'stremely
happy to send you this tumbled lot," pointing to a
scrag on the side of his plate.</p>

<p>"Not as you know on, you may say to your
friends when you write home," replied the other.</p>

<p>"I say, Mrs. Griggs," said another, "haven't
you a very good memory, mem?"

<p>"Why yes, sir," said Mrs. Griggs, "I believe I
have, I was never called unforgitful; my husband
used to say I was very good at remembering
things. Why did you ask, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular, mem, I only wanted to
inquire how long it might be since this bread was
baked?" said the boarder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griggs blushed very red, but all the young
gentlemen tittered as though they were highly delighted
at this piece of wit; but for my part, I
looked upon it as a piece of great rudeness, and I
did not even smile.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I do remember," said Mrs.
Griggs to the quizzical boarder, "and that is, that
you haven't paid your last month's board, you impudence,
and I wish you would, or else leave my
house. A poor widow lady, like me, can't afford
to keep a genteel boarding house for nothing."</p>

<p>There was a general burst of laughter at this
reply of Mrs. Griggs; and the witty gentleman
turned very red, and looked very sheepish, but he
made no reply.</p>

<p>A young gentleman, who sat at my right, observing,
I suppose, that no one took any notice of
me, and pitying my loneliness, commenced a conversation
with me, by asking if I was fond of Manhattan water.</p>

<p>"Is it mineral?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I should think it was," he replied; "it is very
hard, at least."</p>

<p>"Does it promote longevity," I inquired, thinking
that my neighbour must be a scientific gentleman,
and that it would be necessary to speak in a
dignified manner.</p>

<p>"It promotes longevity of office," he replied;
"his honor, the Recorder, drinks a pint before
breakfast every morning, and he has held his office
these twenty years. And the company which supplies
it will live forever, they have got a perpetual
charter."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said I, "that is very curious," not
knowing exactly what else to say. "Pray, what
are its component parts?"</p>

<p>"Professor Silliman analyzed it once," replied
my communicative neighbor, "and found it contained
two parts cats and dogs, and the other parts
different kinds of salts, the names of which I have
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Does any body besides his honor, the Recorder,
drink it?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir, it is drank to a very great extent in
this community&mdash;you have been drinking it your
self."</p>

<p>"O, no, I have never tasted it, I am certain," I
replied.</p>

<p>"O, yes, I am certain you have."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not," I replied sharply, not
liking to be contradicted in so positive a manner.</p>

<p>"Allow me to insist that you have, sir; that is
the very article in your tumbler."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mrs. Griggs removed my plate,
and placed before me a saucer full of bread pudding,
and a copper tea spoon to eat it with; but the
remarks of my communicative neighbor had taken
off the keen edge of my appetite, and I rose up
from the table without tasting it.</p>

<p>After dinner, I wandered about the streets until
I was tired and weary, and then I returned to my
boarding house, and went early to bed, with a
vague hope of being warned in a dream of some
piece of good fortune, which might be in store for
me.</p>

<p>About midnight, I was aroused out of a deep
slumber, by the entrance of three of my room
mates; two of them had been to the theatre, and
they commenced singing "Meet me by Moonlight,"
while the third, who had been practising
at a Thespian club, delivered himself of Hamlet's
soliloquy, trying to make my head answer the purpose
of Yorick's skull, which caused a great deal
of merriment; but I twitched my head away,
and drawing the counterpane over it, pretended to
be asleep.</p>

<p>It was not long before my other two room mates
came in. They were firemen. They were dressed
in red flannel shirts, drab jackets and trowsers,
and large leather caps. They were not both members
of the same company, and they began talking
about their respective machines in a very animated
manner, and I expected every moment to see
them get into a fight; but after they had abused
each other, in a shocking manner, for a few minutes,
they suddenly stopped, and joined in the
song of "Meet me by Moonlight." I ventured
to lift up my head to take a peep at them, when
one of the firemen, a little black haired man, with
steel spectacles, cried out, "hollo! chummy! come
jump out of that, and see the lions dance;" and
without more ado, he took hold of my heels and
dragged me out on to the floor before I had time
to make any resistance. I jumped upon my feet,
full of indignation, but perceiving it was all a joke,
I joined in the laugh, which was raised at my expense,
and was very soon on as good terms with
my five room mates as need be.</p>

<p>They were whole-souled liberal hearted young
fellows, and therefore they would have something
to drink. They cast lots to see who should pay
for the drink, and then drew a card out of a pack
to see who should go after it, and oddly enough it
fell to the lot of the same person to do both; the
amateur Thespian was the unfortunate individual.
He went out to a neighboring bar-room, and soon
returned with a couple of tumblers, and a pitcher
full of mint juleps, which were no sooner drank,
than we were all seized with a desire to sing.</p>

<p>The little curly-headed fireman, it is proper that
I should mention, being pious, refused to drink
any of the juleps, but he lighted a cigar, and almost
suffocated us with smoke.</p>

<p>The breakfast bell rang the next morning before
any of us were awake, but my room-mates
all started up at its summons, and began to dress
themselves with great expedition, and with a most
generous indifference about whose clothes they put
on. There appeared to be a complete abandonment
of all individual ownership in such articles
as shirt collars and stockings, and one of these
free-hearted fellows put on my stockings without
showing the slightest compunction of conscience.
One furnished a bottle of cologne water, and another
a pot of bear's grease; one a hair brush, and
another a comb. But I believe each one confined
himself to his own particular tooth brush; at all
events, I was determined to do so myself.</p>

<p>These young gentlemen made a very genteel
appearance when they were dressed, and I have
no doubt they made a great show in Broadway of
an evening, when they were released from their
business. I could not avoid reflecting on the ease
with which mankind can be imposed upon; and
as I had myself been most grossly deceived by
outward appearances, I determined to be on my
guard for the future, and take nothing upon trust.</p>

<p>I was highly delighted with the profundity of
my reflections, and flattered myself that I had made
a discovery in morals. The reader will discover,
long before he will arrive at the conclusion of my
adventures, in what manner I profited by this great
discovery.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>A new field, and another speculation.</p>

</div>

<p>ONE of my room-mates was a tall slender youth,
with light blue eyes and whitish hair; he wore a
blue frock coat, with a stand-up collar; a black
stock, and a blue cloth cap very much pulled over
his eyes; he usually carried a little ebony stick
under one arm, and a half-bound book under the
other. Sometimes, when he did not forget to put
them on, he wore a pair of steel bowed spectacles,
the glasses of which were slightly tinged with
blue. He had once been a cadet at West Point, and
he still wore a certain military air, which, although
very easily recognised, would be very difficult to
describe. He was very grand in his conversation,
and made use of the choicest words in the dictionary.
His name was D. Wellington Worhoss.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my room after breakfast, with
my eyes resting on Miss De Lancey's handkerchief,
while the eyes of my mind were looking
into the dim future which the light of my imagination
was beginning to enliven, when Mr. Worhoss
came in, and having pulled off his cap and
gloves, he sat down, and resting his heels upon the
mantel piece, he tipped himself back in his chair,
and without apparently observing that I was in
the room, began to read aloud.</p>

<p>I did not feel myself very highly complimented
by the little notice which Mr. Worhoss took of
me, and to show him that I held him as cheaply
as he seemed to hold me, I opened a book, and
began to read aloud myself. He looked at me
over his shoulder with as much sternness as a
young gentleman with blue eyes and whitish hair
could assume, but perceiving that I showed no
signs of immediate dissolution from the effects of
his glances, he threw down his book, and I did the
same.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss and I were, a very few minutes
after, established friends. He swore he would
never desert me, and made me his confidant on
the spot.</p>

<p>I was sorry to learn from Mr. Worhoss that
times were hard. He informed me that the
"House" in which he had been employed as a
clerk, had "bursted up," and that he was, in consequence,
a gentleman at large. "However," he
said in a solemn manner, "I don't care a tenpence
about it; I never did like mercantile pursuits. It
indicates a want of soul to be devoted to them.
Business has a tendency to blunt the finer feelings
of our nature, and I will acknowledge to you in
confidence, that I always found it an extremely
difficult operation to adjust my mind to the level
of a counting-room."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "I should be very glad of an
opportunity to adjust my mind to any occupation
which would yield me a small salary."</p>

<p>"Be content," said Mr. Worhoss, "to cultivate
your sensibilities in some gentlemanly manner,
and don't throw away your talents upon trade.
However," he continued, "if gain is your object,
I can put you in a way of making a handsome
per centage on a small investment."</p>

<p>I told Mr. Worhoss I should feel myself under
great obligations to him, if he would; that I had
got a little money left, and that I should have no
objection in the world to investing it to a good
advantage.</p>

<p>"Then you are just the gentleman I wanted to
see," he replied, taking my hand, and squeezing
it very warmly. "I have written a prize article
for the Mirror, for which I expect to obtain fifty
dollars, and if you will advance me five dollars, I
will return you ten, when I receive the prize."</p>

<p>I thanked Mr. Worhoss for his liberal offer,
and ventured to ask, if there was not a possibility
of his not receiving the prize?</p>

<p>"Not the slightest in the world," he replied;
"it is to be awarded by a committee of literary
gentlemen, all men of taste, and they cannot do
otherwise than decide in favor of my article.
But you shall judge, yourself, of the probability
of their doing so. I will read the article to you."</p>

<p>I told Mr. Worhoss he might spare himself the
trouble, as I had great confidence in his representations.
But, in spite of all I could say, he would
read it to me.</p>

<p>As mankind are prone to wreak their vengeance
on the innocent when they cannot on the offending,
I do not feel myself at liberty to break through
an established custom, as I might thereby subject
myself to be called a fanatic, or some other evil
name; I shall, therefore, revenge myself upon
you, most gentle reader, for the sin of Mr. Worhoss,
by repeating to you the prize article which
that gentleman wrote for the Mirror. Here it is:

<div id="center">

<h2>AUGUSTUS DE SATINETT,</h2>

<p>A TALE OF FASHION;</p>

<p>OR,</p>

<p>THE MYSTERIES OF THE PASSIONS.</p>

<p><i>Dedicated to the Thoughtful.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Augustus de Satinett was a jobber; a choicer
spirit the region of Hanover square boasted not.
Pearl street and Maiden Lane may have known
his equal, his superior never. He had risen from
junior clerk to junior partner, in one of the oldest
firms. The best blood of the revolution flowed in
his veins; his mother was a Van Buster, his father
a de Satinett; a more remote ancestry, or a more
noble, it were vain to desire. Augustus had a noble
soul, it was a seven quarter full; his virtues
were all his own, and they were dyed in the wool;
his vices were those of his age&mdash;they were dyed
in the cloth.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write, Augustus was perfect
in manly beauty; his teeth were white and
even, his lips were finely chiselled, a profusion of
chestnut curls clustered upon his noble brow, and
genius flashed from his hazel eyes. He lifted his
hat to all his acquaintances with an air of easy
dignity, which spoke, as plainly as an air could
speak, that Augustus had travelled in foreign parts,
for he had drummed in Arkansas, and collected
in the lithograph cities of the west.</p>

<p>It required no stretch of classic fancy, in those
who saw de Satinett, to believe that some fond
Pygmalion of the sex, whose existence is a sentiment,
had loved into life a marble Antinous,
which, stepping from his eternal pedestal, had put
on the habiliments with which fashion clothes her
votaries.</p>

<p>Eugenia Bergenville was the only daughter of a
doting mother. She, Eugenia, and not her mother,
was all loveliness and all sentiment. In her were
all the elements of beauty combined, in parts harmonious.
She was like one of those glorious visions
of light and loveliness, which sometimes visit us
when the soul is warm and plastic, and which leave
upon the tablets of memory, an impression which
time cannot efface.</p>

<p>Her mother had seen much of the world, for she
had once dispensed the culinary offerings of Pomona,
in the temple which bears the honored name
of Fulton; to speak plain, she used to sell kitchen
vegetables in Fulton market. But she had become
rich by the purchase of a lucky ticket in a lottery,
and retired to private life; and all the energies of
her soul were devoted to the education of the young
Eugenia, whom she determined to bring up in the
genteelest manner; with her, to determine was to
do. Eugenia was genteely brought up.</p>

<p>She was an accomplished performer on the piano,
and sang in the Italian style; how could she be
otherwise than accomplished&mdash;had she not taken
forty lessons of Goward? Not having a decided
taste for reading and writing, those ordinary
branches were dispensed with, they not being
deemed essentials in a genteel bringing up. But
she knew several French phrases by heart, and she
could sing an Italian song. What more could the
most fastidious desire? But, she could boast of
more. Her dresses were made by Madam Martineau,
who received the <i>Petit Courier</i> by the Havre
packets, direct from Paris. It was the boast of
Eugenia's mother, that her daughter dressed in the
very first style.</p>

<p>Augustus and Eugenia met: the Fates had designed
them for each other; there was, therefore,
no reason why they should be kept asunder. It
was at a benefit ball in St. Tammany that they first
saw each other.</p>

<p>It may be thought by some, that this was an
improper place for two such beings to visit. Perhaps
it was. Charruaud's might have been more
select, or Niblo's a thought genteeler. But perils
are to be encountered wherever youth and beauty
meet; and we have no desire to interfere with the
doings of those peremptory personages, the Fates;
it was by them ordained, that Augustus and Eugenia
should meet within the walls sacred to St.
Tammany.</p>

<p>Many and fair were the forms that graced that
benefit ball. Chatham street sent forth its beauties,
and the Bowery held not back its gay creatures
from the festive scene. Long wreaths of
greens and paper roses, were suspended from the
pillars of the hall, and the gas lights burned with a
brilliancy which made every thing short of liquid
rouge look pale. Augustus danced a <i>pas de trois</i>
with the Misses P., and Eugenia danced a <i>pas de
deux</i> with Mr. P.</p>

<p>Augustus had no sooner seen Eugenia, than he
felt that his time was come, and he sought for the
master of ceremonies, who wore a white riband in
his button hole, and requested to be introduced.
Now, the master of ceremonies had never seen Augustus
before; but being a perfect stranger, is no
bar at a benefit ball, to an introduction; so the
master of ceremonies took Augustus under his
arm, and introduced him to Eugenia, as his particular
friend. Augustus bowed to Eugenia, and
requested the pleasure of dancing with her in the
next quadrille. Now, Eugenia had engaged her
self for every dance that might be danced, and for
the rustic reel at the close; but feeling that her
destiny was sealed, with an ingenuousness peculiar
to the place, she suddenly forgot all her promises,
and yielded at once to the solicitations of Augus
tus; and he had the pleasure, not only of dancing
the next quadrille with her, but of dancing all the
quadrilles that were danced on that eventful night.</p>

<p>Many months did not pass by before Augustus
spoke of marriage; but Eugenia was a child of nature,
and with an artless simplicity, peculiar only to
children of nature, and to the disciples of Madam
Darusmont, she exclaimed, "what is marriage?"</p>

<p>Augustus endeavored to explain to her how it
was necessary, before two souls could be made one,
that some form of ceremony should be submitted
to, although a very trifling one would satisfy the
law; very trifling indeed, compared with its enduring
effects. But Eugenia could not understand
why she could not love and be loved, as purely
and as ardently, without the aid of priests as with.
"What is marriage?" she exclaimed again, in simple
purity of soul; "if it is to love my dear Augustus
better than any other object on earth, better
even than my music master, or my mother, then
am I married already."</p>

<p>But, if Augustus was satisfied that Eugenia
needed not the ties of the matrimonial statutes to
ensure her felicity, he knew that they were necessary
to ensure his, so he insisted on being married
in the old fashioned manner. Eugenia at last consented,
and one bright and pleasant moonlight
night, they were made one by a Roman Catholic
priest, in his back parlor, in Orange street. The
priest being an Irishman, his foreign accent imparted
a degree of romance to the ceremony;
which, in a measure, softened the feelings of Eugenia,
and made the requirements of the law less
odious to her susceptible soul.</p>

<p>The honey moon had fulled and waned, when I
received an invitation to spend a sociable evening
with Augustus. I found him seated with his wife.
He welcomed me with a cordial welcome, but she
neither looked at me nor welcomed me. An ill-natured
observer might have said she was in the
sulks, but doubtless her heart was too full; she was
too happy to speak.</p>

<p>Augustus was a ripe scholar, and he loved to
talk of books. His library was choice and elegant;
it contained Bulwer and Scott complete, and
the "Encyclopedia Americana," and books of a
graver cast were not wanting; the works of Hannah
More held a conspicuous place on his shelves,
and their contents were familiar to his mind: he
had read Coelebs when a boy, and he had the
highest regard for its author; and when speaking
of her, he called her "<i>his Hannah</i>," and his "<i>favorite
Miss More</i>." In the course of the evening,
he frequently spoke of her by these familiar names,
which showed the warmth of his affection for his
favorite authors.</p>

<p>Time will pass away even when familiar friends
are discussing their favorite authors. Mrs. de Satinett,
for so we must call Eugenia, began to give
hints, which could not be misunderstood, that it
was time to retire. The rain was pattering against
the windows, and the house was far up town. Augustus
pressed me to take a bed; I could not refuse.
As he showed me to my chamber, he took
my hand, "Belville," he said, with a solemn earnestness,
"you are not married."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "but you are."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I feel that I am."</p>

<p>He could say no more, and I bid him good
night.</p>

<p>My chamber adjoined that of Augustus and his
wife, and as it was a genteel house, the wall was
not so thick but that I could hear the conversation
that passed between them. I was unwilling to do
so, of course, but I could not avoid it.</p>

<p>"I wish I was dead and in my grave," said
Eugenia.</p>

<p>"How can you, my dear, distress me to death,"
said Augustus to this unnatural wish of his wife.</p>

<p>"No danger of your being distressed to death,"
said Eugenia, sobbing.</p>

<p>"What on earth have I done, my dear, to deserve
this?" said Augustus.</p>

<p>"You have broken my poor heart," said Eugenia.</p>

<p>"My dear, you will drive me mad," said Augustus.</p>

<p>"No danger of your going mad," sobbed Eugenia.</p>

<p>"Don't say so, dear, don't; there," a kiss,
"there, then."</p>

<p>"Let me alone," exclaimed Eugenia.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" groaned Augustus, "what have I
done or said to offend you?"</p>

<p>I could hear him pacing the room with quick
and rapid strides, and I thought to myself, how
surprising it was, that he did not pursue the only
obviously proper course in such a case. I will not
name the course of action which appeared to me
proper on the occasion, for fear of giving offence;
for I am aware that there are differences of opinion
on this as well as on other subjects.</p>

<p>Eugenia, after sobbing hysterically a few minutes
longer, exclaimed again, "I wish I was dead
and buried." "Don't, my dear," said Augustus,
"tempt me to say I wish you were." "You cruel
wretch," exclaimed Eugenia, "you are trying to
kill me. To sit there all the evening, before my
face, and talk about that nasty Hannah."</p>

<p>"What Hannah?" exclaimed Augustus, in
great consternation.</p>

<p>"Your old flame, Miss More, your favorite, as
you call her; to my face too."</p>

<p>Augustus laughed outright. He expostulated
with Eugenia; he explained to her that Hannah
More was only his favorite author; that he had
never seen her in his life; that she was an ugly old
maid, and above all, that she was in her grave.
But it was all to no purpose, he might have rebuked
the angry sea with as much effect. Eugenia
had no conception of such a thing as a favorite
author; all books were alike to her, from a penny
magazine to a polyglot bible; and as to a book having
been written by a woman, it was something entirely
beyond the circumference of her understanding;
she would not believe a word of it. She would
have it that Hannah More was nothing more nor
less than an old flame, or something worse, of her
lord's. <i>She</i> sobbed, and at last <i>he</i> swore.</p>

<p>How they settled the difficulty for the night I am
ignorant to this day, for I soon fell asleep, and
heard nothing farther of their conversation.</p>

<p>From that memorable night I saw a great
change in Augustus de Satinett; but, why prolong
a painful tale, or dwell upon the events which
prostrated a noble nature. Thenceforth Augustus
knew no rest. Eugenia would sit for hours,
and the only words which would escape her lips,
were, "Miss More." When he sought his home,
after a day of fatiguing toil, the first sound that
struck his ear, was, "Hannah;" and when he laid
his head upon his pillow, instead of the sweet
spirit of sleep which once closed his eye lids, the
sound of his no longer favorite "Hannah's" name
chased the kind sprite away, and he was doomed
to hear more of Miss More.</p>

<p>At last, Augustus took to gin; but, that old
fashioned alleviator failing to bring relief, he
sought for peace amid the din of battle, and on
the plains of Texas joined the brave spirits who
poured out their blood in the cause of liberty and
land speculations.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>When Mr. Worhoss concluded his article, he
exclaimed triumphantly, "what do you think
now?"</p>

<p>The truth is, thought I, that fifty dollars would
be an extravagant price to pay for the history of
Mr. de Satinett, but I was afraid to say so, for
fear of offending Mr. Worhoss, so I took out my
pocket book and lent him five dollars, and he gave
me a promise in writing, to return ten dollars in
case he should receive the prize of fifty.</p>

<p>As Mr. Worhoss had been so free in his remarks
to me, I frankly told him what my own condition
was, and asked him to recommended me to some
employment. He advised me to take an office
in Wall street, and commence the brokerage business,
or to open an eating house, or to study for
the ministry. But, as neither of these employments
exactly suited my expectations, he promised
to take me under his protection, and procure a
situation for me immediately, with some respectable
jobber.</p>

<p>I felt myself fortunate in securing, at so cheap
a rate, the friendship of so accomplished a gentleman
as Mr. Worhoss, and I listened to his
conversation for two or three hours with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"For my own part," said Mr. Worhoss, as he
threw his heels over the back of a chair and lighted
a cigar, "I am determined to live easy, to live
well and genteely; and work, I won't."</p>

<p>"Then you have got a rich father to lean upon?"
I said.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Mr. Worhoss; "I am
sorry to say it, but, my father is very poor. He
was a member of Congress a good many years,
and as he spent all his time in attending to the
affairs of the nation, of course his own affairs all
went to sixes and sevens; and all he ever got for
his patriotism, was an appointment at West Point
for myself, and a midshipman's warrant for my
brother, who was dismissed the service for sleeping
in his watch; and I left the Point, because I
couldn't brook the restraints that were put upon
my actions. The fact is, I had a <i>penchant</i> for a
remarkably fine turkey cock of the Colonel's,
which I endeavored one Christmas eve to introduce
into my room; and this trifling circumstance,
some how or other, caused me to leave the Point.
But, it is not absolutely necessary to have a rich
father, in order to live without work. Society,
you must know, that is, the civilized world, have
agreed that a few of their number shall live in
ease and elegance, while the many shall work and
sweat like slaves."</p>

<p>"I knew that such was the case," I remarked,
"but I never knew before that there was any
agreement about the matter. Pray how long is
it since the arrangement was made?"</p>

<p>"Ever since the flood," replied Mr. Worhoss,
"and probably long before. I do not positively assert
that there have been any writings drawn up and
signed by the parties, but still the agreement exists,
and it has been strictly adhered to in all ages,
and will be in all time to come, at least in my
time; so I have resolved to make the most of it,
without stopping to inquire into the justice of the
arrangement."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "it is the tyranny of custom, and
not an agreement between the parties that causes
such an unnatural state of things to exist."</p>

<p>"All stuff," replied Mr. Worhoss; "how can
you call it tyranny, when the strongest party volunteers
to serve the weakest. Tyranny is an unrighteous
exercise of power over those who are
incapable of resistance. If seven eighths of mankind
choose to endure all manner of privations,
that the remaining eighth may enjoy all manner
of comforts, you may call it infatuation, but call
it not tyranny. However, if you are fond of argument,
I will argue with you about the moon
being made of green cheese, because that is a
subject on which there may be doubts; but to argue
about an established fact is an absurdity.
The truth is as I have stated it to you, and I will
tell you in confidence that I have enrolled myself
in the ranks of the minority who receive tribute
from the majority, but in what manner I shall receive
my portion I have not determined. You, I
perceive, are anxious to join the many, and labor
for us; well, every man to his liking; I shall not
dispute with you in a matter of personal tastes,
but, one thing I will advise you to do before you
proceed any farther; and that is, to have your
head examined."</p>

<p>"My head," I exclaimed in astonishment,
"there is nothing the matter with my head."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied Mr. Worhoss; "I
mean the developments of your skull, that you
may know what pursuit is best adapted to your
powers of mind, and in which you would of course
be most likely to succeed."</p>

<p>As this was a point on which I was most anxious
to receive information, I thanked Mr. Worhoss
for his suggestion; and he proposed that I
should go with him to the phrenological rooms of
his friend, Mr. Fingrum; whither I accompanied
him, to submit my head, with all its imperfections,
to the examination of that celebrated philosopher.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>Like a previous chapter, adds another link to the chain of my
adventures, without increasing the intensity of interest which
they may have excited.</p>

</div>

<p>THE "phrenological rooms," were a very small
office in Nassau street, with a dark closet attached
to it. There was a little cupboard in one corner,
filled with plaster busts, and most hideous looking
skulls. In the little closet, the floor of which was
covered with a dirty carpet, sat a lady on a high
stool, with her hair over her face, and Mr. Fingrum
the phrenologist standing over her, poking
his long bony fingers over her head, and calling
out the size of her organs to a pale young man,
who marked them upon a phrenological chart, as
they were announced. Mr. Fingrum was a tall gaunt
man, with a very thin face and a very red nose.
He wore a rusty suit of black, and a dirty white
cambric cravat. Altogether, his appearance was
philosophical in the extreme.</p>

<p>After the manipulation of the lady's head was
completed, and all her organs were properly set
down, she glanced over the chart, apparently with
great satisfaction; but, she thought her "amativ."
was put down a number too high; upon which,
the phrenologist requested her to take off her
bonnet again, and he re-examined that particular
organ, and decided, that instead of its being rated
too high, it was actually a number too low. He
explained, that the reason why the lady had doubts
about it, was all owing to her "self-esteem" being
so very small.</p>

<p>With this explanation, she appeared entirely satisfied;
and when she left the "rooms," she said she
should recommend several of her female acquaintances,
who had very interesting heads, to call on
Mr. Fingrum and be examined.</p>

<p>As the phrenological rooms were conducted on
the strictly republican principle of "first come first
served," I was forced to wait my turn, and a stout
red faced gentleman next took his seat upon the
stool.</p>

<p>Mr. Fingrum hesitated for a minute before he
put his hands upon the head of his sitter, and going
to a glass case, he took out a half decayed skull,
which he appeared to regard with great delight.</p>

<p>"This," said the phrenologist, with great solemnity,
"is the skull of Saint Paul."</p>

<p>"What, the apostle!" exclaimed the stout gentleman,
starting upon his feet.</p>

<p>"The very same," replied Mr. Fingrum.</p>

<p>"Bless my heart, bless my heart," said the
gentleman, almost turning pale, and taking his seat
upon the stool again, "that ever I should live to
see the skull of Saint Paul the Apostle. Why he
has been dead these eighteen hundred years."</p>

<p>"No he hasn't," replied the phrenologist, "you
must remember that Saint Paul was a very old gentleman
when he suffered martyrdom, and that he
was not converted until some years after the ascension."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the gentleman, "he has not
been dead as long as I thought at first."</p>

<p>"I want you should observe, sir," continued Mr.
Fingrum, while he polished the skull with the
palms of his hands, "that a gentleman may have
a development of very bad propensities, and yet
be the best and noblest of his race. Or rather he
may have organs which might be productive of
evil, but which, under proper guidance, will be
come instruments of good. Thus you see that destructiv.
and combativ., which are so fully developed
in Saint Paul, and which once sent him on
an errand of cruelty to Damascus, afterwards, when
his conscientiousness, which you observe is also
very large, had aided the Holy Spirit to work his
conversion, caused him to speak out so bravely
before Festus and Agrippa, and enter valiantly
into the theatre at Ephesus."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I shouldn't wonder, said the
sitter.</p>

<p>Mr. Fingrum replaced the skull of Saint Paul
in the glass case, and commenced the examination
of the stout gentleman, who shut both eyes, and
held down his head as reverently as though Mr.
Fingrum was about to pronounce a benediction
upon him.</p>

<p>The phrenologist pressed his hands upon the
head of his sitter, and began to name over the developments
to his assistant, who sat, pen in hand,
ready to take down his remarks on a chart.</p>

<p>"Amativ. large," mumbled Mr. F.; "Philoprogenitiv.
full; Adhesiv. large; Inhabitiv. small;
Concentrativ. large; Combativ. very large; Destructiv.
very large."</p>

<p>"What," exclaimed the gentleman, opening his
eyes, and turning redder in the face, "do you
mean to tell me that I am a destructive?"</p>

<p>"I say that you have combativeness and destructiveness
very largely developed, and that you
must, in consequence, be addicted to fighting,
and&mdash;"

<p>"I say I am not," replied the gentleman, "and
don't you tell me that again. I am one of the
most peaceable men in my Ward."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are," said the phrenologist, "but
I am not accountable for your developments, and
I must repeat, that your destructiveness is very
large."</p>

<p>"Take your hands off of my head," exclaimed
the gentleman, jumping up, "and take that for
your insolence, you red nosed ghost." And with
out more ado, he struck the phrenologist a blow
under the ear, which sent him reeling up against
his assistant, who stumbled against the case which
contained the head of Saint Paul, which he over
turned, and smashed the glass plate which covered
that valuable relic. The destructive gentleman
then took his hat, and walked out of the "rooms,"
in a state of high excitement.</p>

<p>The phrenologists got upon their feet again, after
a while, but it was a long time before either could
speak.</p>

<p>"That is all owing," said Mr. Fingrum, as soon
as he had recovered from his fright. "to my cautiousness
being so small; confound it, I wish it was
bigger. I perceived, at a glance, that that man's
self esteem and combativ., would make him a dangerous
subject to handle, and so I showed him the
peculiarities of Saint Paul's skull, to prepare his
mind for what I should be obliged to say about
his own; but I ought to have been more cautious."</p>

<p>"And was that really Saint Paul's skull?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"That, no," said the phrenologist, "it was the
skull of Gibbs, the pirate. I saw that the man's
marvel was so large that he would believe any
thing I might tell him; if I had told him it was the
skull of Cain, he would have believed it. But he
shall find that my combativeness is as large as his
own; I will go immediately to the police office
and have him arrested." And so he took his hat
and cane, and walked off, and I was obliged to
leave the rooms without having my head examined,
a circumstance which I regretted very much, as I
felt myself entirely at a loss to determine what pursuit
my talents best qualified me for. My inclinations
rather leaned to the course which my new
friend, Mr. Worhoss, had marked out for himself;
but I thought it would be prudent to try something
else first before I joined his party.</p>

<p>At the tea table I met Mr. Worhoss again, and
that kind hearted young gentleman invited me to
take a walk with him after tea and see the town.
As I was anxious to see every thing worth seeing,
I thanked him for his kindness, and accepted his
offer. He said he would just step up to his room
and dress, and then he should be ready for a walk.</p>

<p>As Mr. Worhoss's "to dress," meant nothing
more than buttoning up another button of his coat,
and brushing his hair, and pulling down his wrist
bands, I thought he was an unreasonable long time
in doing it. At length, however, he made his appearance,
with his slender ebony stick in his hand,
and we walked out together. The street lamps
were lighted, and Mr. Worhoss remarked that as
it was too late to see any thing in Broadway, it
would be advisable to go direct to the theatre. He
said there was to be a sterling English comedy, and
a new French dancer, and consequently, all the
beauty and fashion of the city would be present.</p>

<p>I very gladly assented to his proposal, thinking
that where all the beauty of the city was gathered
together, my beautiful Georgiana could not be
absent.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss proposed that we should sit in the
pit, as it was decidedly respectable, although not
as genteel as the boxes. Of course, I made no
objections; and when we reached the entrance, I
stopped short, expecting that he would procure the
tickets, as Mr. Lummucks had done, when he pave
me an invitation to go to the theatre with him.
But Mr. Worhoss only pointed to a little round
hole in the partition, and observed that that was
the place where they took the money for the
tickets.</p>

<p>"Is it indeed?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Worhoss, "and you had better
get a couple of tickets before they begin to
crowd about the doors."</p>

<p>"O, ah," I said, feeling very foolish, "I didn't
think of that."</p>

<p>"I knew you didn't," replied Mr. Worhoss,
"and that is the very reason why I reminded you
of it."</p>

<p>According to the delicate suggestion of my new
friend, I bought two tickets, and we entered the
pit about half an hour before the performances
commenced, which gave me an opportunity to observe
all the beauties as they took their seats in
the boxes. I watched them very narrowly, hoping
to discover my beautiful Georgiana among them,
but I was disappointed; she did not come. It was
some consolation, however, to me, to know that
her ears would not be offended by the rude and
ribald language of the people in the pit. They
were a rough set. I thought that the respectability
of the pit was not quite so decided as Mr.
Worhoss had intimated; but he remarked, that
there was an unusual number of butcher boys present,
who were always a great annoyance to the
lovers of the legitimate drama, by their eating of
roasted pea nuts, and encoring all the songs.</p>

<p>I forget the name of the sterling comedy which
was played, but it was all about a wild young fellow,
who ran away with a beautiful young lady,
whom he succeeded in marrying in spite of the
exertions of her old guardian to prevent him. I
was delighted with the plot, and thought that the
moral was most excellent. After the comedy, Mr.
Worhoss, who appeared to know every body in
the Theatre, told me not only the names, but the
personal histories of a good many of the audience.
Amongst the rest, he pointed out to mean elderly
gentleman, with a good humored broad countenance,
a high nose, and a pair of twinkling black
eyes. "That gentleman," said Mr. Worhoss, "is
Major Rigmaroll, the editor; he has written criticisms
about the stage for the last thirty years. I
know him all to pieces. He is going to publish a
book about Shakspeare, and he has already published
one, in which he proves as plain as the nose
on his face, which you see is plain enough, that the
American Indians are descended from Shem, Ham,
or Japheth, I forget which; he claims relationship,
by the way, with one of them himself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps." I said, "he wants to lay claim to
some Indian lands, on the score of family connexion."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul I believe he has done so already,"
said Mr. Worhoss.</p>

<p>"He must be a very learned man," I said, "to
be able to trace the origin of a people who are
themselves ignorant of their own descent."</p>

<p>"I guess he is learned," replied Mr. Worhoss;
"he knows Josephus Millerius by heart. But
look, see what a long glass he has got in his
hand; he has come here on purpose to criticise
the new <i>danseuse</i>."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the stage bell rung; the musicians
in the orchestra began to play. "Hats
off," cried the people in the pit. Up went the
green curtain, and disclosed a scene representing
a forest of trees growing out of a board floor, and
in bounced a fat woman, who, as soon as she got
to the centre of the stage, elevated one foot to a
horizontal position, and whirled round on the
other like a top. I must confess I was shocked
beyond measure, for I had some how or other imbibed
an idea that an opera dancer was a light
and gentle little creature, who tripped and bounded
before your vision in graceful movements,
like a sprite; but nothing could be more unlike
the reality, for here was a full grown woman
throwing about her legs in all manner of ungainly
attitudes, and with such an indecent scantiness
of clothing as to fairly make me blush.</p>

<p>But my ideas on this subject, I must acknowledge,
differed very much from those of Mr. Worhoss,
for he declared she was a magnificent dancer,
and he said, that, after witnessing such an exhibition,
it would be a down right bore to sit
through the farce. As I agreed with him in his
last opinion, we came out of the theatre, and I
was glad to get into the open air again. Mr.
Worhoss proposed taking something to prevent
our taking cold, and I followed him into a showy
bar-room, next door to the theatre. He called
for two glasses of port wine sangaree, and after
he had emptied his tumbler, he appeared to be
deeply absorbed in the contemplation of a hunting
piece which hung opposite to the bar. As
there were a good many young men standing
around, and the bar-keeper seemed to be waiting
for the pay for the sangarees, I threw down a
shilling, upon which Mr. Worhoss turned suddenly
round, and putting his hand into his pocket,
exclaimed, "you don't say you have paid?"</p>

<p>"Yes I have," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, that is too bad; come, let us go," said
Mr. Worhoss.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Mr. Worhoss, "let us have
some oysters, and then we shall be prepared to
finish the evening."</p>

<p>I observed that I was not in the least hungry.</p>

<p>"That is nothing," said Mr. Worhoss; "people
don't eat oysters because they are hungry,
any more than they drink wine because they are
thirsty."</p>

<p>I did not want to show my ignorance, so I
made no further objections, but followed Mr. Worhoss
down a steep pair of stone steps into a cellar,
which was brilliantly lighted up with gas
lights, and we took our seats in a little box just
big enough to hold two persons. The front of
it was enclosed by a red moreen curtain, behind
which a man's head obtruded itself as soon as we
entered, and ejaculated, "stew?"</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that," I asked, staring
at the head.</p>

<p>"Stew?" ejaculated the head again.</p>

<p>"He wants to know if you want a stew," said
Mr. Worhoss.</p>

<p>But I did not know whether I wanted a stew or
not. So I made no reply, and the man exclaimed
once more, "stew?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Worhoss, "none of your stews.
Give us two half dozens fried, and whilst they
are cooking, two half dozens of raw ones in the
shell, and a lemon."</p>

<p>The head disappeared, and very soon returned
with the raw ones, which were large and delicious.
Although I was not hungry, I succeeded
in swallowing half a dozen without any difficulty.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't often drink anything?"
remarked Mr. Worhoss, in an inquiring tone.</p>

<p>"Not often," I replied.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Mr. Worhoss, "but a
glass of brandy and water is indispensable with
oysters. Shall I order a couple of glasses?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied, and the brandy and
water was brought.</p>

<p>In the next box were two young men regaling
themselves with a bowl of oyster soup. From
the sound of their voices I thought they were very
young. As they talked very loud, I could not
avoid hearing their conversation.</p>

<p>"I say, Nick," says one, "how much does your
old man allow you per week?"</p>

<p>"Only a dollar," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Only a dollar! what a mean old skunk he
must be!"</p>

<p>"Isn't he, proper? I'm blistered if I ain't ashamed
of him. But I tell you how I manage it.
When I want money, I go to the old woman and
tell her I want to subscribe to the Missionary Society,
and she always forks out."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, that is first rate. But you know I
haint got no mother, so I can't do that, of course.
But I will tell you how I work it; when I want
money, I go down to the store and get a new
suit of clothes, and then go and pawn them in
Chatham street."</p>

<p>"You do? Well I'm blest if that ain't capital.
I mean to try that myself. But hurry and
eat up your soup, or we shall miss the after
piece."</p>

<p>"What, ain't you going to have some pie?"</p>

<p>"No, I never eats pastry."</p>

<p>"Then let us have some brandy."</p>

<p>When these interesting young gentlemen were
gone, I remarked to Mr. Worhoss that I didn't
like the cellar at all, it was so close and confined.</p>

<p>"Not like it," he exclaimed; "why, oysters
would not be oysters if they were not eaten in
a cellar. Don't you know there is an eternal
fitness about every thing, but particularly about
eating. The luxury of a dish does not consist so
much in its material, as in the place and manner
in which it is served. A bowl of greasy soup,
for instance, with kernels of pimento floating in
it, may be eaten in such a place as this with great
gusto; but if it were placed before you at a regular
dinner table, it would cause a rebellion in
your bread-bearer. And what man, in his senses,
would sit down to a table so narrow that his knees
interlocked with his neighbor's opposite, in any
place but an oyster cellar. But there is one exception
to the eternal fitness of things. Fried
oysters are fitting on all occasions and in all places."</p>

<p>The fried ones were now brought, and Mr.
Worhoss called for more cold slaw, and two more
glasses of brandy, and during the next quarter of
an hour he did not speak a word. When we had
finished our oysters, he drew a long breath, and
we rose up to-go, and instead of going up to the
bar, to pay, he took up a newspaper, and pored
over it as earnestly as though he was reading it
for a task. The bar-keeper looked at me very
hard, and as Mr. Worhoss was so intensely interested
in the paper he was as reading, I could not do
less than offer a bill in payment for the oysters and
brandy. After I had received my change, he
threw down his newspaper, and walked up to the
bar with his hand in his pocket, but the bar-keeper
told him the oysters were paid for.</p>

<p>"Franco," says Mr. Worhoss, putting on a very
stern look, "don't do that again."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, I assure you," I replied.</p>

<p>"If you do you will offend me," he replied.</p>

<p>And so we ascended into the upper world
again.</p>

<p>"It has just occurred to me," said Mr. Worhoss,
when he had reached the pavement, "that
to-night is soiree night at No. 8. We will go there
if you have no objection; they will admit me because
I am a volunteer, and they will not object
to you because you are a stranger."</p>

<p>I told Mr. Worhoss I was entirely at his disposal,
and he might lead me wherever he liked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would prefer to go to a musical
party at the Shades," he said.</p>

<p>"Which will cost the most?" I inquired; "the
Shades or the soiree."</p>

<p>"O, the Shades, of course," he said; "it will
cost nothing at the soiree."</p>

<p>"Then I think I should a little prefer the soiree,"
I said.</p>

<p>"That is a bright idea," said Mr. Worhoss,
"so come along."</p>

<p>We walked down Broadway a short distance,
and then turned into a dimly lighted street, where
there appeared to be no dwelling houses, and the
side walks were lumbered up with bales and boxes.
We had not travelled far before we came to a very
small house, jammed in between two very high
warehouses, with large folding doors, painted in
fancy colors, and gilt block letters over the entrance,
indicating that it was the Engine Company
No. 8. I thought it was a very strange place for
a soiree, but I said nothing, and Mr. Worhoss took
a small key out of his pocket, and opened the door,
and I followed him through a dark and narrow
passage, up a pair of steep steps, wondering where
in the world he was leading me, when suddenly he
opened a door, and I found myself ushered into a
brilliantly lighted room, with a long table in the
centre, around which were seated fifteen or twenty
young men; they were all dressed in drab jackets
and trowsers, and red shirts, in the bosoms of
which was the figure 8, embroidered with white
tape. At one end of the table, seated in an arm
chair, which was elevated above the others, I
immediately discovered the little curly headed
captain, with steel spectacles, who had pulled
me out of bed the night before. The room was
elegantly furnished, and every thing in it bore
a strong contrast to the rough dresses of the company.
The chairs were of mahogany, with the
figure 8 carved in their backs; the floor was carpeted,
and the walls were hung round with pictures
in gorgeous gilt frames. One of the pictures represented
the apotheosis of a chief engineer,
whose name I have forgot.</p>

<p>The little captain in the chair requested us to be
seated, but remarked that it was against the rules
of the company to allow any but members to be
present at a <i>soiree</i>. I put my hand upon the handle
of the door to retire, but the little captain begged
that I would remain for <i>his</i> sake, and I hung
up my hat among the leather caps, and took a seat
at the table by Mr. Worhoss.</p>

<p>"That is just the way," muttered a sallow looking
member, "we make laws and hang them up
in gilt frames, and then we obey them&mdash;if we
please."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the chairman, "it must be a
very bad community where they have not the grace
to make good laws, for nothing can be easier than
to pass virtuous resolutions; and any society or
company, that neglects to do that, must be in a
very bad way. That I take to be an axiom, to
say the least of it." Saying which, the little chairman
took off his glasses, rubbed them with his
pocket handkerchief, and put them on again, and
looked as though he was determined to frown down
all opposition.</p>

<p>But the discontented member went on growling
and grumbling, utterly regardless of the
chairman's axiom and his severe frowns.</p>

<p>"That is the very thing that I find fault with,"
he said; "we pronounce our own condemnation by
making laws which we have not the virtue to observe.
It is just the way with us as a nation; our
fathers were willing to stake their lives, their fortunes,
and their sacred honors, to maintain the assertion
that all men are born free and equal, while
at the same time they held one quarter part of the
population of their country in bondage."</p>

<p>"Fine him, fine him," cried a dozen voices, "he
is talking politics."</p>

<p>"I won't be fined," said the grumbling member;
"I am only speaking the truth, and that is not politics,
no how you can fix it."</p>

<p>"You must be fined," said another, "for you
are talking religion."</p>

<p>"I am not talking religion," said the grumbler;
"I am only speaking my sentiments. I appeal to
the chair."</p>

<p>"There is no religion in your sentiments, I will
swear," said the chairman. "But you shall be
fined and turned out too, for you have been talking
abolition, and that is worse than either politics
or religion."</p>

<p>"Turn him out, turn him out," they all exclaimed,
starting upon their feet.</p>

<p>"I won't be turned out," said the refractory
member, putting himself in a position of defence;
"Let not a soul of you dare to put a finger on
me."</p>

<p>But firemen dare do any thing, and the abolitionist
was seized and hustled down stairs, and into
the street, in spite of all his threats and struggles.
Order was very soon restored, and the chairman
being called on for a song, he sang the following,
which he said was his own composition, and we all
joined in the chorus:</p>

<div id="center">
<p>THE CAPTAIN'S SONG.</p>
</div>

<p>When years twice as many as o'er me have flown,<br/>

Shall have dropped from their pinions more sorrows and cares,<br/>

And I'm left to bear onward the burthen alone,<br/>

Whose weight now a lov'd one endearingly shares.<br/>

Fond memory then, with her pencil of light,<br/>

Shall depict in bright colors the joys of this night.</p>

<p>When health shall desert me, when friends shall depart,<br/>

When wealth shall have open'd his pinions and flown;<br/>

When love, even love, shall have fled from my heart,<br/>

Then friendship shall cling to me still, though alone.<br/>

And memory then, with her pencil of light,<br/>

Shall depict in bright colors the joys of this night.</p>

<p>When death, even death, shall approach like a friend,<br/>

And I yield myself up to his chilling embrace;<br/>

With a hope of hereafter, though here all shall end,<br/>

My last effort shall be to help memory trace,<br/>

The forms of my friends with her pencil of light,<br/>

As she paints in warm colors the joys of this night.</p>

<p>All the rest of the company either sang a song or
told a story, as they were called upon. And then
the little captain was called upon to relate how he
got stuck upon the gable end of an old Dutch
house, down in Coenties slip, one winter night, at
the time of the great fire, by the seat of his trowsers
freezing to the ridge pole; and how all the
engines played upon him two or three hours without
any body discovering his perilous situation,
and how it took two or three kettles of hot boiling
water to make Jack Frost relieve his hold of him.</p>

<p>This he did with surprising exactness, as Mr.
Worhoss observed, considering he had told it so
many times before; for men, he said, were apt to
forget the particulars of a story after having repeated
it two or three hundred times.</p>

<p>The captain appeared gratified by the compliment
which Mr. Worhoss paid to his memory,
and shook his head despondingly, and said, fires
are not what they used to be, and intimated that
the department might go to blazes, for all he
cared, if there was not a turn out soon.</p>

<p>"There has not been a fire worth mentioning
since the great fire," said one of the members,
who had not opened his lips before, and who
now looked up and down the table very sagaciously.</p>

<p>"That is a fact," exclaimed one or two other
members, with as much solemnity as though it
was the only fact that had been uttered for the
evening.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that a first rate fire?" said another.</p>

<p>"I guess it was," said two more simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it?" said another.</p>

<p>"Didn't Bill Davis do something that night?"
said another.</p>

<p>"Do something?" said another little member;
"you may well say that; he did more than some
thing; he saved ever so many children. How
many was it, captain?"</p>

<p>"One only," said the captain, "and a little
one too."</p>

<p>"Of course it was a little one, or it could have
saved itself," said another.</p>

<p>"How did it happen," I asked, for I did not
care to remain silent any longer.</p>

<p>"Is Bill Davis present?" asked the gentleman
to whom I addressed myself.</p>

<p>"No, I see he is not, so I will tell you all about
it. You have heard about the great fire in
Chatham street of course," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "I never heard it spoken
of before."</p>

<p>"You never did?" he exclaimed; "well, wonders
will not soon cease, I do believe. I thought every
body had heard about that; why, it was on that
memorable occasion that I turned out for the
first time with number eight. It was a bitter cold
night in the month of January, and when I went
up to bed, says I, Mrs. Mix, says I, I shouldn't
think strange if we had a fire to-night. I shouldn't
wonder, says she, if we had, for I have always
observed, Mr. Smith, that fires happen in very
cold nights. So I went up to bed, and just as I
was in the very act of undoing my stock, bang
goes the jail bell, so down I went and ran for
dear life, and reached the house just as Bill Davis
was taking the machine out all alone by him
self."</p>

<p>"Isn't that Bill Davis a smart fellow?" said
one of the members, interrupting the story teller.</p>

<p>"Isn't he?" said another.</p>

<p>"I guess he is," said a third.</p>

<p>"That is a fact," said another, striking the table
enthusiastically with his fist.</p>

<p>The important truth that Bill Davis was a
smart fellow being established, the story teller proceeded.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Smith, is that you, said Bill; yes,
says I; is that you, Davis? That is me,
says Bill, and so we never exchanged another
word until we reached the fire, and then, says he
to me, I tell you what, Smith, it is going to be a
rouser. Isn't it? says I, and then at it we
went. Bill took the pipe, and we began to play,
when up started a lady; where she came from,
we couldn't tell; save my child, she screamed,
save my child. Where is he, says Bill; up
there, says the lady, pointing to a window in the
third story, out of which the flames were bursting.
Bless my heart, says Bill, if he is in there, he is
gone already. O don't say he is gone, says she;
I must save him, he is my only boy; and with that,
she steps on the ladder; I can't stand that, says
Bill, turning to me, and letting go the pipe; she
is the ladiest woman I ever saw, and I will save
the child or lose myself; and so he lifted the lady
off the ladder, and up he went, and into the window;
we never expected to see Bill again; but
I'm blest if he didn't soon make his appearance
again, with the child in his arms; and down he
came, and put it into its mother's lap, who was
sitting on the curb stone wringing her hands, and
crying enough to break the heart of a loco foco.
Didn't she then kneel right down in the gutter,
and begin to invoke blessings on to Bill's head.
But, Bill says, don't bother me, good woman,
with your nonsense. We got comfortable lodgings
for her that night, and the next day we got
up a complimentary benefit-ball for her and the
rest of the sufferers, and I wish I may never see
another house afire if her part of the proceeds of
that ball didn't set her up in an elegant thread and
needle store in the Bowery. And they do say
Bill means to marry that woman."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was something like a fire," said the
little captain, shaking his head mournfully; "that
happened before the hydrants were invented.
You don't see such fires now-a-days."</p>

<p>One of the company, after this, favored us with
the following song:</p>

<div id="center">
<p>THE SECOND FIREMAN'S SONG.</p>
</div>

<p>Whose fate 'twill be to weep,<br/>

Whose fate 'twill be to die,<br/>

Before our feast again we keep,<br/>

You neither know, nor I.<br/>

But since this hour hath found us,<br/>

And friendship together hath bound us,<br/>

Pluck memory's flowers, while these moments are ours,<br/>

And throw her gay garland around us.</p>

<p>Whose fate 'twill be to prove<br/>

Women are not all true,<br/>

Is known to one above,<br/>

But not to me nor you.<br/>

But since this hour hath found us,<br/>

&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whose fate 'twill be to find<br/>

How weak is friendship's tie,<br/>

We do not know, but may it bind<br/>

Most firmly you and I.<br/>

But since this hour hath found us,<br/>

&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whose fate will't be to know<br/>

The griefs which spring from wine,<br/>

To taste the dregs of human wo,<br/>

May't be nor yours nor mine.<br/>

But since this hour hath found us,<br/>

&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The captain declared the song to be so decidedly
sentimental that he proposed a turn out and
a race with the machine, to work off its depressing
effects. The proposal was received with
general approbation; but there being nothing on
fire just at that moment, they requested Mr. Worhoss
to go up to the head of the street and give
an alarm. I thought it was a very strange proposition,
but he considered it a very good joke,
and agreed to do as he was requested. So the
soiree broke up, and we all repaired to the engine
house, the members in high glee, and the
little captain full of importance. The preparations
for rolling out were no sooner completed,
than we heard the cry of "fire! fire! fire!"
The doors of the engine house were immediately
thrown open, and away we started, dragging the
engine after us like horses, for I had volunteered
my services, expecting to see some fine sport.
Two ragged little boys ran on ahead with flaming
torches, and another followed in the rear with a
blue signal lantern. The little captain made as
much noise as he possibly could with his speaking
trumpet, shouting out, "pull away, boys, pull
away, boys," with as much earnestness as though
half the city had been on fire. We had not rattled
over the pavements long, nor far, before the
church bells began to ring, and other engines and
hose carts began to dash up Broadway, thundering
over the pavements, and adding to the din
and confusion. But I got out of breath very
soon, and was compelled to let go the drag rope.
In escaping to the sidewalk, I came very near being
crushed beneath the wheels of a hose cart.
The lights from innumerable torches and signal
lanterns was flashing and flickering on every
side, lighting up the faces of the firemen as they
hurried past, and displaying the gorgeous ornaments
of the engines which they dragged after them.
It was a picturesque and novel sight to me, and
as I looked on to the confused scene, I forgot for
a time that it was all a farce, and that all the
noise, and turmoil, and display, was caused by
half a dozen thoughtless young fellows wanting to
have a spree. The uproar did not continue a
great while, for as soon as it was discovered that
there was no fire, the bells ceased ringing, and the
firemen dragged their machines slowly back to
their respective engine houses.</p>

<p>As I returned to my boarding house, I could
not help reflecting, as I went, on the many false
alarms there had been in the world, calling mankind
from their quiet homes to march like fiends
to battle, neither knowing whither they went, nor
for what reason they offered up their own or
sacrificed the lives of others; and accomplishing
no better end than to furnish picturesque subjects
for painters and poets.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>Shows the benefit of studying morals at the theatre, and the
difference between falling in love on the stage and off.</p>

</div>

<p>BEING left alone the next morning after the
night of adventures related in the last chapter, I
had abundant time to ruminate on all I had seen,
as well as to form new plans for my future conduct.
But the moral of the sterling English
comedy which I had seen, took so strong a hold
of my imagination, I could think of nothing else.
I could not but fancy myself in the situation of
the fine, free-hearted, thoughtless young fellow,
who ran away with a beautiful young heiress from
her boarding school, and then cajoled her cross
old guardian into good humor, just before the
curtain fell, by a witty repartee. Nothing could
be more palpable than the moral of such a conclusion,
and nothing more desirable than to imitate
such a proceeding. I found no difficulty in
comparing myself with the hair-brained hero, and
the ingenious architect of airy castles lent her
ready aid to help transform the gentle Georgiana
De Lancey into the heroine of the comedy. That
she was rich I had no doubt; that she was at a
boarding school I knew, for a silver plate on the
door of the house into which I had seen her enter,
announced that fact to the world; that she loved
me was not to be questioned; I had travelled
with her in the stage coach; and that I loved
her, every fibre in my body, and every pulsation
of my heart, bore witness. Nothing could be
plainer. The fates had very obligingly given me
possession of the young lady's handkerchief, as
if on purpose to afford me an opportunity of seeking
an interview with her; and to neglect such
evident advantages would be to tempt fortune;
something I could not well afford to do, seeing
that all my hopes rested upon her caprices. As
I thought over these things, and revolved in my
mind the ease with which an heiress could be obtained
and her guardian mollified, my imagination
became wrought up into a perfect phrensy of
delight. But nothing gave me half so much
pleasure as the thought of triumphing over my
haughty cousin, and of giving the lie to his prediction.</p>

<p>To make all the points of resemblance to my
model as exact as possible, I went to a clothing
store in Maiden Lane, where I furnished myself
with a suit of clothes, at a moment's warning, precisely
like his, namely: a claret colored frock
coat, a pair of striped pantaloons, and a figured
satin vest. It took nearly all the money I had in
the world to pay for them; but I bore in
mind the valuable casket that I had purchased on
speculation, and the ten dollars which Mr. Worhoss
was to pay me when he got paid for his prize
article. But I should not have hesitated in the
purchase, even though I had not had these valuable
reliances to fall back upon in case of need; to
have done so would have been quite out of character
with my original.</p>

<p>Having dressed myself in my new clothes, and
made a pretty liberal use of a bottle of cologne
water which I found in my room, I liked the appearance
of myself so well, that I resolved to set
off without any delay, and call on Miss De Lancey,
under the pretence of returning her pocket
handkerchief, and trust to the kind power who
takes venturesome young fellows under her charge,
to bring matters to the wished for conclusion.</p>

<p>There had been a slight shower in the morning;
but now the sky was clear and blue, and the
sun was shining bright and warm, but the snowy
white awnings stretched across the side walks
gave a cool and delightful shade. The activity
and bustle which I encountered as I made my way
through the crowded streets, added to my hilarious
feelings, and as I emerged from a bye street
into Broadway, they were still more excited by
the lively and elegant scene which that famous
promenade presented, and I pulled up my shirt
collar and mingled in the throng with as consequential
an air as I could assume, and probably
with as light a heart as any in the crowd. When
a man's happiness is based upon things in possession,
it must, of necessity, be limited in extent;
but when it springs from his hopes, there need be
no limits to the amount of it. There was, therefore,
no reason why I should not be perfectly happy,
for I had nothing but my hopes to build
upon.</p>

<p>Although I was sufficiently engrossed with a
sense of my own importance, I could not avoid
bestowing a glance, as I sauntered along, upon
the numerous groups of gayly dressed and beautiful
women who tripped past me, chatting and
laughing, and showing their brilliant white teeth.
Some of them were leading by the hand cherublike
children, with golden locks flowing down
their graceful shoulders. Others were stepping
in or out of elegant carriages at the doors of the
fancy stores, while the liveried servants, with gold
bands round their hats and white gloves on their
hands, stood, either holding open the carriage
doors, or leaning idly against the awning posts.
Neatly dressed young gentlemen, with ebony
sticks in their hands, and a tuft of hair on their upper
lips, made a part of the crowd, and paced
along with measured step, and with an air as solemn
and important as though the sun was shining
expressly for their particular pleasure and benefit.</p>

<p>What with the attractions of the shop windows,
the beauty of the women, the loveliness of
the children, and the odd airs of the men, my attention
got completely diverted from myself, and
I forgot the errand on which I was bound, until
I was reminded of it by reaching the street which
led to Miss Smith's boarding school. My heart
fluttered, and the blood rushed into my face, as I
found myself so near the end of my journey; but
I got fresh courage, and strengthened my nerves
with a glass of wine and a cracker at the Independent
Coffee House, and then walked briskly
on until I reached Miss Smith's establishment. I
felt in my pocket to make sure that the handkerchief
was there, and then ran boldly up the white
marble steps, and gave the bell handle a pull.
The door was opened by a stout black girl, and
I asked if Miss De Lancey was at home. "Walk
into the parlor," said the girl, "and I will call
Miss Smith." I did walk into the parlor, where
I was left to my reflections for a length of time,
which I could have sworn exceeded an hour, had
not a French clock on the mantel piece assured
me it did not exceed five minutes. The parlor
was altogether the handsomest room I had ever
seen, and besides a great abundance of furniture,
it contained a good many curious works of art,
principally composed of shells, such as grottos and
temples, vases of flowers, and card racks in the
shape of harps set off with blue ribands; there
was also the picture of a young lady and a weeping
willow, looking very much like two sisters,
embroidered on white satin, and hung up in
a highly ornamented gilt frame; this last work
of art was executed by Miss Isabella Davis, aged
eleven years. Having at a glance observed all
these things, and a good many more, I began to
feel very uneasy, and I had just made up my
mind to steal out of the house as quietly as possible,
when I heard a light step on the stairs. It was
light to the ear only, for each step seemed to
strike as palpably upon my heart as though it
had been trod upon; and I am certain if I had
died at that moment, the print of a little shoe
would have been distinctly seen there. I held my
breath with apprehension, but tried to look remarkably
easy. The door opened, and in walked,
not the beautiful Georgiana, but a tall lady,
dressed in a snuff colored silk gown and a turban
of fearful dimensions. It was no less a person
than Miss Smith herself. I made a low bow,
and being entirely at a loss for a remark, waited
for Miss Smith to speak.</p>

<p>"Which of the young ladies did you wish to
see?" asked Miss Smith.</p>

<p>"I called for the purpose of seeing Miss De Lancey,"
I replied, blushing very red.</p>

<p>"Have you a letter from her guardian?" inquired
Miss Smith.</p>

<p>"Not exactly a letter," I replied.</p>

<p>"Only a note, then, I suppose," remarked Miss
Smith.</p>

<p>"I believe not," I replied, feeling in my pocket
for the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Miss Smith, "you are not
aware, that it is contrary to the rules of my establishment
to allow any young lady under my
charge to see a gentleman without the permission
of her parents or guardian."</p>

<p>"Indeed I was not," I replied, drawing a long
breath.</p>

<p>"I must then inform you that such is the case,"
replied Miss Smith, with cold dignity.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is very unfortunate that I did not know
that before," I said, as the recollection of the cost
of my new clothes flashed across my mind.</p>

<p>"Pray, could I have the liberty of addressing
a few lines to Miss De Lancey?"</p>

<p>"By all means," replied Miss Smith, "provided
you allow me to read them first."</p>

<p>I thanked Miss Smith for her kindness, made
her another low bow, and wished her a good morning.
As I turned to go out of the hall, I discovered
there were a score of bright eyes peeping over
the bannister at the head of the stairs, and not
doubting that the brightest and bluest pair among
them belonged to the beautiful Georgiana, I consoled
myself with the reflection, that she would recognise
me, and give me credit for trying to see
her. I could not prevail upon myself to give up
her pocket handkerchief; for now that I had been
disappointed in my attempt at an interview with
her, it was more precious than ever in my sight,
and I resolved henceforth, that I would wear it
next to my heart.</p>

<p>I could no longer compare myself with the lucky
scapegrace in the comedy, and nothing could
have been more undramatic than my interview
with Miss Smith. I felt unhappy and dispirited,
and I made my way back to my boarding house,
through lanes and bye streets, avoiding Broadway,
with its gewgaws and crowds.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>Is full of disappointments, and ends with the commencement of
a new career.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. WORHOSS repeated his kindnesses to me so
often, in showing me the lions, as he called it, that
I was soon left without a sixpence in my pocket;
for it so happened that I was always left to pay
all the expenses incurred for drink and oysters, for
these were necessaries, it appeared, which could
not be dispensed with on any occasion. And as
he had not yet received the money for his prize
article, I had no other resource but the casket and
its contents; and I determined to avail myself of
the offer of Mr. Isaacs, who had promised to buy
them of me at just double what I gave for them;
so I took the casket under my arm, and went in
pursuit of that gentleman, expecting to find him at
the auction store where I made the purchase. But
I was disappointed in not finding him there. I
asked the auctioneer if he could inform me where
Mr. Isaacs was to be seen.</p>

<p>"Bless your innocent heart, my friend," said
the auctioneer, "how should I know any thing
about him?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought he was a friend of yours," I
replied.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine," said the auctioneer contemptuously,
"why I never seen the gentleman
but once in my life, and I probably shall never see
him again."</p>

<p>I was struck aghast at this intelligence, for all
my expectations of profit were founded upon Mr.
Isaacs' promise. I told the auctioneer that as he
had not promised to give me double the cost of the
casket, although Mr. Isaacs had, I did not think I
could, in strict justice, demand it of him, notwithstanding
he had sworn that it was worth more than
three times the money that I gave for it; therefore,
I would only request him to take back the casket,
and return me the money that I gave for it, as it
was much too costly an article for me to keep.</p>

<p>"That is a very unmercantile proposition, young
man," said the auctioneer, "it is quite out of the
common course of business. I couldn't think of
doing any such thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may not be strictly according to
mercantile usages," I replied, "but as the advantage
will all be on your side, I should not think
you would refuse my offer."</p>

<p>"You talk exactly like a book, young man," replied
the auctioneer, "but it would never do for
me to make such an unmercantile operation; if I
should, there is no knowing what the Board of
Trade might do with me; they would haul me up
to Albany right off."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," I asked, "that the rules of
trade are so positive?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear sir," replied the auctioneer;
"the Board of Trade is a very positive
body of individuals; look how that respectable
institution used up the Phenix, down there in Wall
street, just because it conferred a favor on an individual
one morning, just as you want me to do to
you. It will never do in the world. But I will
tell you what I can do for you, and perhaps it will
meet your views. I will take the casket, and sell
it for you to-morrow. I expect a very good company,
as I have advertised some splendid watches."</p>

<p>Being unwilling to take the casket back again,
I thanked the auctioneer, and told him he might
sell it the next day, provided he could get what it
cost me.</p>

<p>"You had better not limit it, young man," said
the auctioneer, "it would be a pity to lose the sale
of it for the sake of a shilling or such a matter."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I replied, "sell it for what it
will bring; but if Mr. Isaacs should come in,
please ask him to take it at the price which he offered."</p>

<p>"I will with pleasure, sir," said the auctioneer,
"but I think it is extremely improbable whether
he comes."</p>

<p>I left the auctioneer's store, and sauntered about
the streets in a very unpleasant state of mind, for
the disappointment of not seeing Miss De Lancey,
and of not finding Mr. Isaacs, added to the
mortifying reflection that I had, in so short a
space of time, spent the little money that my father
had given me, made me very unhappy. I was
still without any prospect of a situation, although
Mr. Worhoss had promised to procure one for
me, and I resolved to keep closely all the money
that I might receive from the sale of my casket.</p>

<p>The next day I called at the auction store, and
was told that my casket was sold for five dollars.</p>

<p>The auctioneer reached me four dollars and a
half, saying that his commissions were half a dollar.</p>

<p>"Five dollars!" I exclaimed; "you mean fifty-five,
I presume."</p>

<p>"No I don't," said the auctioneer, "I mean
five dollars; it was every cent the casket fetched;
I can prove it by my book-keeper."</p>

<p>I grew sick at the intelligence. "Certainly the
silver was worth more than that," I said.</p>

<p>"German silver is not very valuable," replied
the auctioneer, at the same time winking to a
man who was paying a bill. "Is it, mister?"</p>

<p>"Not very," replied the man; "German silver
is something like German philosophy, not
worth much when you come to use it."</p>

<p>"Here is your money, young man," said the
auctioneer, reaching me four dollars and a half.</p>

<p>"I won't have it," I replied, growing angry
at the insolence of the auctioneer. "You have
cheated me most grossly either in the first or the
last sale."</p>

<p>But the auctioneer, instead of resenting my imputation
on his honesty, only laughed and picked
his teeth. "Very well, young man," he said, "if
you don't choose to take the money, I shall be very
glad to keep it these hard times."</p>

<p>"You had better take it," said the man who
had given his opinion about German philosophy.
"It will be the only satisfaction you can ever obtain;
he has the law on his side."</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection I came to the same
conclusion, and I took the money and put it in my
pocket, feeling that I owed my disappointment to
my own credulity and avarice. I said nothing
farther to the auctioneer, but as I was going out
of the store, I happened to look behind a green
baize curtain at the end of the counter, and there,
to my great astonishment, I saw Mr. Isaacs himself,
scouring a watch case. It was well both
for him and myself, that I had no deadly weapon
in my hand, for I felt that I could kill him on the
spot. As it was, I said nothing to him, but I
gave him a look which he must remember till
his dying day.</p>

<p>The sale of my casket was a bitter disappointment
to me, and when I reached my chamber I
could not refrain from tears. Mr. Worhoss came
in while I was crying, and asked me if I had
heard any bad news. I told him the cause of my
grief, and requested him to return me the money
I had loaned him, as I wanted it to pay my board
with. But that scrupulous gentleman said that
he could not return it until the committee of literary
gentlemen had decided about his prize article,
as it would not be fulfilling the conditions on
which he borrowed it, if he should. But I told
him if he would return me the five dollars I
would not require ten. He said, however, that
his principles were too honorable to allow him to
do so, and that he could not think of paying me
less than he agreed to. I then reminded Mr.
Worhoss of his promise to procure me a situation,
thinking, of course, that a gentleman who was so
scrupulous in fulfilling all his promises, would
like to be reminded of any that he had forgotten.</p>

<p>"That is very true," said Mr. Worhoss, "there
is a house of my acquaintance that wants a young
man from the country, and I will give you their
number, and then you can make your own arrangements
with them."</p>

<p>"What kind of a house is it?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O, a first rate house," replied Mr. Worhoss,
"Stripes &amp; Co.; they do a splendid domestic
commission business in Pine street."</p>

<p>My feelings were so elated with the prospect of
employment, that I told Mr. Worhoss I would forgive
him the debt he owed me, in consideration of
his kindness, and begged him to give me the address
of Stripes &amp; Co., that I might call on
them without delay. He took a newspaper out of
his pocket, from which he cut an advertisement,
stating that Stripes &amp; Co. were in want of a
clerk. I asked him if I should make use of his
name, and he said I might if I chose, but he
didn't think it would be of any particular benefit
to me, as they didn't know him, although he knew
them very well. So I started immediately for
Pine street, hoping to make a favorable impression
upon Stripes &amp; Co., but I was so agitated by
my hopes and fears, that, when I got to their
counting room I could scarcely speak, and my
agitation was not at all soothed by meeting five or
six young men coming out as I went in. I inquired
for Mr. Stripes, and was shown into a little
room just big enough to contain Mr. Stripes and
the desk at which he sat writing. I held my hat
in my hand, and in a trembling voice, asked him
if he was in want of a clerk.</p>

<p>"We have advertised for one," said Mr.
Stripes, laying down his pen, and looking me full
in the face, "are you an applicant?"</p>

<p>I replied that I should be glad to obtain the
situation, if it would afford me a living.</p>

<p>"What do you think you could live upon?"
asked Mr. Stripes.</p>

<p>I replied that I was a stranger in the city, and
consequently ignorant of the expenses of a clerk,
but that I could, no doubt, live on whatever salary
he might pay me.</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Mr. Stripes, "young men
can live very cheap when they are so inclined. I
used to live on a shilling a day when I first came
to the city. Do your parents live in the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."

<p>"Are they wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Not very; indeed, I am afraid they are quite
poor."</p>

<p>"Ah, then they are not in the manufacturing
line?"</p>

<p>"Not much; my mother used to make all my
clothes."</p>

<p>"Indeed; did she make those you have got
on!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I bought these in Maiden Lane."</p>

<p>"Any relations living in the city?"</p>

<p>"None, sir, that I know of."</p>

<p>"Are your parents pious?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed."</p>

<p>"Then I guess they are not. Are you pious
yourself?"</p>

<p>As I didn't know what answer to make to this
question, I only blushed and remained silent, feeling
sensible that I looked very foolish.</p>

<p>"Would you like to distribute tracts?" continued
Mr. Stripes.</p>

<p>"I should be willing to do any thing that was
not dishonorable."</p>

<p>"What did you say your name was?"</p>

<p>"Franco."</p>

<p>"Franco, hey, what is your first name?"</p>

<p>"Harry."</p>

<p>"Harry Franco, Harry Franco, it seems to
me I have heard that name before. Are you not
the abolitionist?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you not mistaken? I am pretty certain
I saw it in the papers. Are you a colonizationist?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly; I believe not."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think about it. I
wouldn't have an abolitionist in my employ. Can
you write well?"</p>

<p>"Tolerably; I can show you a specimen."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have been a good deal to
school?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but very little."</p>

<p>"Have you any brothers?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am an only son."</p>

<p>"Are you, indeed! There were thirteen of
us; two are dead, and the rest are all doing a good
business. Are you acquainted with domestics?"</p>

<p>"What, servants?"</p>

<p>"No, no; Ticks and Shirtings and bleached
goods."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir."</p>

<p>"Hem, I don't think we shall want to engage
you now; we have had applications from&mdash;let
me see how many&mdash;I will foot up the list: six
hundred and eighty-three. But we have engaged
a young man who is to come in the morning.
He is to have nothing for his services the first
year, and the empty boxes the second."</p>

<p>I was completely astounded at the termination
of Mr. Stripes catechism, for I had made up my
mind that he meant to employ me, from the minuteness
of his inquiries, and I stood looking at
him without moving, thinking I had certainly
misunderstood him.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mr. Stripes, "I have no
farther inquiries to make; we have engaged
an individual to fill the vacancy in our office."</p>

<p>"Then why did you put all these impertinent
questions to me," I said, my anger getting the
better of my discretion.</p>

<p>"Don't be saucy, sir," exclaimed Mr. Stripes,
turning blue, for his face before was as white as his
bleached goods, "or I will send you to the police
office."</p>

<p>I came out of the store of Stripes &amp; Co. with
my heart in my throat; the last hope on which I
rested was knocked from under my feet, and the
terrible prophecy of my cousin seemed about to
be fulfilled. His words sounded in my ears, and
the forms of my heart-broken mother and sister
were the only objects that presented themselves to
my vision. "Alas! alas!" I exclaimed, "O that
the earth would open and swallow me up." But
my wish was unheeded, and I continued to walk
on over the hard bosom of the earth, if the paved
streets of a city can be so called, until I found
myself at the foot of Pine street, in sight of the
East River and the shipping. This was a new
scene to me, for since the morning on which I
landed from the steamboat, I had not seen the water.
The life and bustle and novelty of every
thing about me soon engrossed my attention, and
I forgot my chagrin and disappointments; and even
the sound of my cousin's hateful voice no longer
rang in my ears; it was completely drowned in
the cheerful "ho, cheerly!" which proceeded
from the ships, where they were discharging and
taking on board their cargoes. Every thing around
was full of liveliness and joy, and I wondered at
the stupidity of Mr. Worhoss in taking me to
walk in Broadway, while here was a scene so full
of noble sights. The sky was bright and blue,
and a thousand penons and signals, and the flags
of many nations, floated gracefully upon the breeze.
The magnificent proportions of the ships, with
their beautiful figure-heads, and rich gilding, and
bright waists, and tall taper masts, and outstretched
spars, filled me with amazement; and the
countless multitude of smaller vessels, their curious
and varying shapes, and the regular confusion
of their ropes and spars, gave me no less astonishment.
Perhaps those who are in the daily
habit of seeing sights like these, may think it extravagant
in me to speak of them in such terms;
but those who have spent their lives in a secluded
village will remember with what wondering eyes
they first looked upon the crowded wharves of a
thronged seaport like New York in its hey day of
activity, and they will think my words are cold,
and my descriptions tame, as in truth they appear
to me. Since that day I have seen the navies of
half the world, and the crowds of merchant ships
which fill the walled docks of London and Liverpool,
with their flags floating heavily in the murky
atmosphere of those smoky cities; and I have
visited most of the seaports worth seeing in the
old world and in the new, but I have never seen
any, for brightness and beauty, for liveliness and
joy, that can compare with New York.</p>

<p>As I sauntered along the wharves, I thought of
Robinson Crusoe, and Sinbad the Sailor, and
Christopher Columbus, and Americus Vespucius,
and all of a sudden it struck me that greater things
were to be accomplished on the ocean than upon
the land, and that it would be a greater triumph
if I could achieve a fortune in a foreign land than
if I were to acquire one by regular drudgery at
home. It as suddenly occurred to me, that I had
heard my father speak of a relation of his, whom
he used to call Tom Gunnell, who came down to
New York, a wild youth from the country, and
went to sea in one of my father's ships previous
to the embargo. I thought that by this time he
certainly ought to be captain of a ship at least,
and I determined if possible to find him, and if it
should prove that he had a ship, to ask him to take
me to sea with him. I popped into the first grocery
store I came to, and took up the morning
paper to look over the marine list, with the hope
of finding the name of Captain Gunnell, and almost
the first advertisement that I caught sight of
was the "Ship Two Marys, Captain T. Gunnell,
for Buenos Ayres;" I could scarcely believe my
eyes at first, and I read the advertisement over
three times before I was convinced that there was
no deception about it. This was a piece of real
good luck. I thought the tide of fortune had
turned in my favor, and I took heart again; but
remembering the many disappointments I had encountered
already, I controlled my feelings, and
set off immediately in pursuit of Captain Gunnell's
ship, determined to know, before I went back
to my boarding house, whether he was my relation
or not. With the help of an old sailor, who
offered his services in consideration of a glass of
gin, I found the Two Marys. She was a smaller
ship, and much blacker and dirtier looking than
those which had attracted my attention at first;
she had neither gilding on her stern, nor a varnished
waist, nor a figure-head; but the old sailor
who had assisted me in finding her, observed that
she was a "good wholesome lump of a barkey."
Without being very critical in my observations, I
climbed up a rope-ladder at her side and jumped
upon deck. A stout red-faced man, with whiskers
of the same hue, and dressed in a blue coat and a
white marseilles vest, was standing under an awning
on the after part of the deck. I stepped up
to him, and asked him if Captain Gunnell was on
board.</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," he said.</p>

<p>I then informed the captain who I was, upon
which he lifted his hat very politely, and shook
me by the hand, and said he was very happy to
seem; told me I was welcome on board the
Two Marys, and inquired very kindly after my
father, and asked me how many sisters I had, and
whether all the girls were married up in the country.
And then Captain Gunnell called out in a
gruff voice, "Steward!" But no steward came,
and in a few moments he called again still more
gruffly, "you steward!" But still no steward
came, and then Captain Gunnell called "Mr.
Ruffin!" "Ay, ay, sir," answered a voice in
the ship's hold, in a still gruffer tone than Captain
Gunnell's. "Mr. Ruffin," said the Captain,
"send that black rascal to me." "Ay, ay, sir,"
answered a voice, which I presume was Mr. Ruffin's.
Presently, a dirty looking negro, with his
head covered with flour, made his appearance from
below.</p>

<p>"You black scoundrel," said Captain Gunnell
to the steward, "why didn't you reply to me
when I called?"</p>

<p>"Cause I don't hear," replied the steward; "I
was stowing away eggs, with my head in flour
barrel."</p>

<p>"Silence, sir," said the captain, "don't make
any back answers; but the next time I call, do
you answer me whether you hear me or not, or
I'll pick your ears with a crowbar, you black
rascal."

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said the steward. And he was
turning to go away, when Captain Gunnell again
called out, "steward!"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the steward.</p>

<p>"What did I call you for, steward?" said
Captain Gunnell.</p>

<p>"Captain Gunnell didn't say what he call me
for," replied the negro, meekly.</p>

<p>"Steward," again exclaimed the captain,
"bring me two chairs."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said the steward, and disappeared
down the cabin stairs, and soon returned, bringing
two chairs with him; one had no back, and the
other but three legs. Captain Gunnell invited
me to sit down, apologizing for not inviting me
into the cabin, as they were stowing away the ship's
grub, and it was not in a fit condition to receive
company.</p>

<p>I was impatient to know whether Captain Gunnell
would take me to sea with him or not, and in
a very few words I told him the object of my visit,
the which he no sooner heard than he put his hat
upon his head, and looked at me from head to
foot. I have found it to be almost invariably the
case, that when I have asked a favor of a man, his
bearing towards me has undergone an immediate
and by no means an agreeable change. Captain
Gunnell was not an exception to this rule.</p>

<p>However, I was not disposed to be very particular,
so I did not pretend to notice that he spoke
to me, after he heard the object of my visit, very
much in the same manner that he spoke to his
steward, as he consented to take me with him, if I
chose to go as a green hand. I did not exactly
understand the meaning of the term, but I told
him I had no objections to going in any capacity
that he thought me qualified for.</p>

<p>"Qualified!" said the captain, "I don't think
you are qualified for any thing but eating duff.
However, young fellow, you are like a young
bear, all your troubles are before you, and if you
insist on going, I will take you with me for your
father's sake; he did me a good turn once, and
one good turn deserves another." And then he
called for Mr. Ruffin.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruffin answered "ay, ay, sir," from below,
and then followed his voice by springing out of the
hold on to the deck. He was not by any means a
very pleasant man to look at; he was short, and thin
visaged, and bow legged; he had a most awful
squint, and his nose was all bent on one side; his
shirt sleeves were rolled up above his elbows, and
displayed his long ape like arms as brown as a
piece of old mahogany, and with all their cords
and sinews plainly developed; he was dressed in
a pair of canvass trowsers and a calico shirt,
neither of which was remarkably clean, and on
his head he wore a low crowned drab wool hat.
with a piece of red quality for a band; every time
he spoke he turned over an enormous quid of tobacco
in his mouth, and squirted out a torrent of
juice; he was the chief mate of the ship.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ruffin," said Captain Gunnell, addressing
the mate, "is all the hands shipped?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Mr. Ruffin, "there is one
vacancy."</p>

<p>"Then don't give another order, sir," said the
captain, "this youngster wants to ship as a green
hand, and I will give him an order myself on the
notary."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," replied the mate; and then
bringing his eyes to a focus, he surveyed me from
head to foot, and jumped down into the hold
again; he had no sooner disappeared, however,
than the captain again called out in his gruff
voice, "Mr. Ruffin!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," again answered the mate, and
sprang on deck once more.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ruffin," said the captain, "you understand,
sir, that I will give this young man an
order myself."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," replied the mate, without showing
the slightest impatience at being called up on
so trifling an occasion, or indeed on no occasion at
all.</p>

<p>Captain Gunnell then gave me an order on the
notary, to ship me as a green hand, at ten dollars
per month, and told me if I wanted a month's advance,
to tell Tom Goin that he would be security
for me. After I had left the ship, he called me
back, and told me to be on board the next day at
twelve o clock.</p>

</div>

<p>IT may be thought that my prospects were not
very bright, and that I had no great cause for rejoicing;
but whether I had or not, I left the Two
Marys with a heart much lighter than when I went
on board of her. My mind was not occupied with
Captain Gunnell and his mate, but with the silver
mines of La Plata, and my proud cousin, and the all
lovely Georgiana De Lancey.</p>

<p>It is a blessed thing for the poor wretches who
are, by some means or other, defrauded of their
rightful portion of the good things which surround
them, that they can wander at will, and appropriate
to their own use the greenest spots that they can
find in the broad region of Hope. This was my
privilege, and I was by no means heedless of my
prerogative.</p>

<p>I hastened back to my boarding house, packed
up my clothes, paid Mrs. Riggs* for my board, and
told her I should leave her in the morning. For
the first time, I wrote to my father, and informed
him of my determination to go to sea, and hinted
that I should not come back until I could come
with a fortune. I said not a word to Mr. Worhoss
about my intentions, for I didn't consider him entitled
to any consideration. As soon as it was dark,
I strolled up to the establishment of Miss Smith,
with the hope of catching a glance of Miss De
Lancey, but without success; there was not a light
to be seen, nor a soul stirring about that respectable
school; so I gave a parting look to the brick
walls, which enclosed the form of the gentle Georgiana,
and turned my back upon them with a sigh,
without even daring to hope that I should ever behold
her again.</p>

<p><i>[*Transcriber's Note: At this point, "Griggs"
becomes "Riggs" and remains so throughout the rest
of the novel.]</i></p>

<p>In the morning I went to the Notary's office,
and signed my name to the ship's papers; and
while I was reading the articles of agreement, and
the act of Congress which they contained, the notary's
clerk snatched them away from me, and
asked me if I wanted to eat them. I replied, that
I didn't like to sign my name to an agreement
without reading it; upon which he cursed both his
eyes most profanely, and wished he might be
knocked into the shape of a cocked hat, if such a
thing was ever heard of, as a sailor reading a
ship's articles.</p>

<p>A bluff looking sailor who was standing by, said
he had got an old "articles" in his chest, and as
he was going in the Two Marys himself, he would
let me read them in my watch below, when we got
to sea. The notary asked me if I had got a protection,
and on hearing that I had not, he wanted
to know who was going to swear that I was an
American, as it was necessary for some body to do
so before I could get one. I expressed my fears
that I should not be able to get a protection, as I
knew of nobody who could swear to the fact of my
being a native born. As I said this, a greasy looking
man, in a bob tail green coat, said he would
sell me a protection that would exactly answer the
description of my person, if I had no objections to
changing my name to Smith.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I thank you," I replied, "I don't like
the name of Smith."</p>

<p>"You are a real fool," exclaimed the Notary,
"Smith is as good a purser's name as a man need
have."</p>

<p>"I think so too," said the bob-tail-coated gentleman,
"it's a good name enough for a green
hand any how."</p>

<p>"But why don't you swear for him, Pete?"
asked the notary.</p>

<p>"So I scall," said the obliging Pete, "if he
scall give me two skillings?"</p>

<p>"I would do so with pleasure," I replied, "but
will it not be perjury?"</p>

<p>"Don't make a josey of yourself," said the notary's
clerk, "if the man is willing to swear for
you, what do you care about his perjuring himself?"</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "I am willing."</p>

<p>So the gentleman swore that to the best of his
belief, &amp;c. that I was born, &amp;c.; and some other
form having been observed, a protection was procured
for me from the custom house, and I received
a month's pay in advance, and was told to be
on board the ship with my duds by two o'clock.
The sailor who offered to lend me the "articles,"
asked me to take a horn with him, and as I was
anxious to offend no one, I followed him into a
grocery close by; he walked up to the counter, and
filled a tumbler half full of whiskey, nodded to me,
and said, "here's luck, shipmate," and drank it off,
without adding a drop of water to it. But for my
part, I took a very little gin, and a good deal of
water, and nodded to Jack, and repeated his words,
but I could not for the life of me swallow a drop of
the gin and water, the scent of it was so nauseous.
Jack threw down a sixpence, but the bar-keeper returned
him a cent, saying he charged three cents
a glass at retail, but as Jack took his whiskey by
the wholesale, he should only charge him two.
There were three or four dirty looking fellows, and
a couple of negroes, standing round the bar, and
they all laughed very loud at the bar-keeper's wit,
as though they had never heard the joke before.
Jack himself laughed, and the bar-keeper giggled,
and swore it was "too good;" the negroes said it
was "too sweet;" and they all swore with one
voice, that Jack was bound to treat the company;
so he told them to "take hold;" one of the negroes
beckoned in two more darkies, who were luxuriating
in the hot sun on a lazy bench at the door.
While these amiable gentlemen were filling their
glasses, I contrived to make my escape unperceived.</p>

<p>As I had no farewells to take, all my little arrangements
for the voyage were soon completed,
and at the appointed hour, I was on board the
Two Marys, with my chest, which contained a
couple of calico shirts, a pair of duck trowsers, a
monkey jacket, a black silk handkerchief, Blunt's
Navigator, and a jack knife. As soon as I got on
board, Mr. Ruffin, the mate, told me I must take
my long-tail coat off; I told him I would as soon
as I had put my chest away, and found a convenient
place to undress myself in.</p>

<p>I had got my chest half way down the cabin
stairs, when Mr. Ruffin called out in his gruff
voice,</p>

<p>"Hollo! youngster, if you want to get into the
after part of the ship, you musn't crawl in at the
cabin windows, but come aft as I did, by degrees,
through the hawse holes, and through every ringbolt
in the ship's deck."</p>

<p>I have generally found it a safe way, when any
body addressed any conversation to me which I
could not understand, to make no reply, and as I
didn't comprehend a word of what Mr. Ruffin said
I made no answer, but continued to take my chest
down into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, youngster?" growled Mr.
Ruffin.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, looking up, "I hear you,
but I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Don't understand me." exclaimed Mr. Ruffin
with an oath, "can't you understand English?
Take your traps forward into the forecastle. Do
you understand that?"</p>

<p>I did not exactly understand it, but the steward
came to my assistance, and showed me where the
forecastle was, and helped me to put my chest into
it. I could not help thinking that so much violence
was entirely uncalled for on the part of Mr.
Ruffin, as I would have obeyed the most gentle signification
of his will with the greatest alacrity.</p>

<p>The forecastle was a dark and dirty looking
hole, without a particle of paint, and destitute of
every kind of convenience, for either dressing or
eating. If I had seen it before I signed the ship's
articles, I doubt whether I should have had courage
to have ventured on going to sea. It was not,
however, in my nature, to repine long at anything,
so I hauled off my coat, and went upon deck, and
bustled about and made myself as busy as possible,
trusting that I should do right, but I doubt whether
I was of much service. The decks were full
of ropes and sailor's chests, and all manner of articles,
not one of which could I call by its right
name.</p>

<p>The crew being all on board, the pilot took
charge of the ship, the lines were cast loose, and
we drifted off into the river, Captain Gunnell standing
on the end of the wharf, hallooing and cursing
until we were out of the sound of his voice. When
the ship reached the middle of the river, the anchor
was let go, the riggers were sent ashore, and the
cook, whom Mr. Ruffin called the "Doctor," was
ordered to give the crew their suppers. It was an
order I was very glad to hear given, for I was very
hungry; but I looked in vain for the preparations
for eating, which I expected to see. My heart sank
within me, when on going into the forecastle, I
discovered that our supper consisted of a tub of
salt beef, some hard biscuits, and an iron kettle
filled with black tea, sweetened with molasses.</p>

The sailors were the roughest looking set
of men I had ever seen in my life; they were
seated in a half circle on their chests, with each a
tin pot of smoking hot tea, and a long sheath
knife in his hand; they grumbled and damned,
and found fault with every thing before them, for
which I did not think they were much to blame.
They called the tea "water bewitched," and one
of them swore it was the regular "Yawpan," which
he had seen sold for sixpence the bushel in Macao.
Another said the beef was part of an old horse, and
swore he found a horse's hoof, with the shoe on it,
in the cook's coppers. As for the bread, they said
they should be obliged to carry a ten penny nail
in their pockets, whenever they went to their
meals, to nail the biscuit down to the deck, to keep
the worms from running away with it.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Bob," said one, "we shall have
small stores all the voyage?"</p>

<p>"You may swear to that," replied another,
"Philadelfy small stores, a tar pot and a scraper."</p>

<p>At the first sight of the beef, I thought I could
not prevail upon my stomach to become a receptacle
for a mouthful of it; but, by degrees, my hunger
got the better of my scruples, and I borrowed
a knife from one of the sailors, and commenced
cutting myself a slice; forks there were none, but
I found that good carving was an accomplishment,
indispensable even in a ship's forecastle, for as my
knife diverged a little from a strait line, to include
a morsel of fat in the vicinity, one of my shipmates
growled out in no very pleasant tones, "cut square,
matey;" "none of your Philadelfy slices," exclaimed
another, and without further notice, I received
a rap across the knuckles, from the knife
handle of the last growler.</p>

<p>"Who did that?" I exclaimed, starting upon
my feet.</p>

<p>"Who did it? you Johnny raw, I did it,"
replied a sailor; at the sight of whom all my valor
melted away. A stouter person than myself might
have pocketed an insult from him, without suffering
an imputation of cowardice; his huge fists and
broad shoulders inspired me with a feeling of respect
rather than fear. But I felt that I had been
insulted, and a feeling of shame made me shrink
from the notice of my companions, and I crept into
one of the berths, from whence I could look down
and take a leisurely survey of all that was going on.
As I gazed upon the rough faces, and listened to
the profane conversation of the sailors, I felt a misgiving
that there were evil days in store for me,
and I could not but wish that I had never left my
quiet home, to seek my fortune in the turbulent
world; but thoughts of home were always accompanied
with recollections of the cause of my leaving
it; and I dismissed all fears, and thought only
of the sneering prophecy of my cousin.</p>

<p>A smoky lamp, suspended from the ceiling of
the forecastle, gave but just light enough to show
the hard faces of the men who sat immediately
under it; and to reveal but dimly the prominent
features of those who were farther removed, leaving
a part of their persons completely wrapped in
obscurity; so that they appeared like half formed
beings, emerging out of chaos. They were all either
drunk, or in that surly and brutish state, which
succeeds to a drunken revel. When their supper
was over, they kicked the tub of beef into a corner,
and threw their tin pots on one side, and all signs
of a meal were gone: clearing away the supper
things was a short ceremony. Notwithstanding
their apparent surliness and ill humor, one of them
volunteered a song, and in a voice like a northwester,
was proceeding with great solemnity to
sing</p>

<p>"It was a ship and a ship of fame,<br/>

Launched off the stocks, and bound for the Main,"</p>

<p>when he was suddenly interrupted by a voice on
deck, exclaiming, "hallo there below! stand from
under!" And down jumped a young sailor, with
a little blue keg under his arm. "Who knows
me?" exclaimed the new comer; "here I am, Jeremiah
Bowhorn!"</p>

<p>Whether it was because of the light hearted and
merry tones of the young sailor's voice, or his neat
and good-looking person, or the sight of the little
blue keg which he brought with him, I cannot say,
but his presence seemed to give universal satisfaction;
and the sailors all gave him a hearty welcome,
although none of them recognized him for
an old acquaintance, which gave Mr. Bowhorn,
some surprise, for he said he thought he knew
every body. After he had satisfied sundry inquiries
about the names of his landlord, his sweethearts,
and his last ship, he sat down and called for
a tort, upon which, one of the sailors took a little
horn drinking cup out of the till of his chest, and
Jeremiah filled it with gin, out of his little cask,
which he called his "bull," and passed it in turn
to each of the sailors. As he filled the last tort,
he caught sight of my head, as I stretched it
out over the side of the berth, to see what was going
on, and he swore he would have me out of my
hiding place in a trice, if I didn't jump out and
take a horn. "Come, come, shipmate," he said,
"it is too early to go to prayers yet, so haul your
self out, and take a tort of the real stuff." So I
jumped out of my birth, for my heart yearned towards
the new comer the moment I heard his
voice; and in a valiant attempt to swallow a horn
of new whiskey, I came near being strangled. My
imminent danger, instead of exciting sympathy,
caused the most boisterous merriment among my
shipmates; and to show me what a green horn I
was, each of them drank another tort of the newly
distilled poison without winking. A song appears
to be always the natural effect of drinking. The
singer, who had been interrupted by the sudden
dropping in of Jeremiah Bowhorn, again commenced
his solemn ditty, which was patiently listened
to by all hands until the close. But I will only transcribe
this one verse, for the benefit of my readers:</p>

<p>"It was a ship and a ship of fame,<br/>

Launched off the stocks, and bound for the Main,<br/>

With a hundred and fifty bold young men,<br/>

They were picked and chosen every one."</p>

<p>It may, however, be considered ungenerous to
give but one verse, and as the next one seems to
be necessary to complete the sense of the first, I
will transcribe that too:</p>

<p>"Benjamin Jones was her captain's name,<br/>

He was a fine and a brisk young man,<br/>

And as brave a sailor as ever went to sea,<br/>

And we were bound for the coast of Africa."</p>

<p>After this song, there was more whiskey drank,
and another song was sung, "'T was down in Cupid's
garden," and then another and another. All
the songs had choruses, in which I joined with all
my might, and a terrible uproar we made. The
fish in the river, as they swam past our ship's
bows, must have been frightened at the noise.
For my own part, I began to think myself fortunate
in falling into the society of such a fine set
of fellows, and my unfavorable impressions were
fast wearing away. Even the man who had rapped
me over the knuckles with his knife handle,
no longer looked as forbidding as at first sight he
appeared; his black shaggy eyebrows, it is true,
cast a dark shadow over his face, but the eyes
which looked out from beneath them were as blue
and as mild as an infant's; and then his broad,
manly chest, and bull like neck, to which his curly
black hair clung like the tendrils of a vine to the
trunk of an oak, gave an assurance of strength
which it was comfortable to know I could depend
upon in time of need.</p>

<p>The tort was passed around so freely, that at
last my pleasant companions began to lose their
relish for music, and commenced making sounds
which were any thing but indicative of harmonious
feelings. In the place of singing, they all
evinced a decided inclination for fighting, and
more than one boasted of his individual prowess.
Fearing that I might get into a broil, and distrusting
my ability to defend myself with credit, I
again retreated to my berth, that I might be out
of harm's way; but it was no easy matter to get
into it, for it appeared to be flying round and
round, and I was obliged to stand still some time
before it got steady.</p>

<p>The stout sailor with the shaggy eye brows,
whose name I found was Jack Snaggs, had remained
remarkably quiet for some time, sitting
with his lips tightly compressed together, apparently
waiting for one of his shipmates to begin
a quarrel with him. But stout men are generally
the last ones that quarrelsome individuals
choose to interfere with, and Jack Snaggs would
probably have had to forego the pleasure of a
fight, if he had not provoked one himself. He
sat for some minutes looking steadily at Jerry
Bowhorn, who, nothing daunted by his frowns,
shot fiery glances at him from his keen hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>"I say, shipmate," at last said Jack Snaggs to
Jeremiah Bowhorn, "what are you looking at
me for?"</p>

<p>"Because you were looking at me," replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like the looks o'me?"
said Jack.</p>

<p>"I don't like the looks of you at all," replied
Jerry, with an oath.</p>

<p>"How are you going to help yourself, shipmate?"
growled Jack.</p>

<p>To this interrogatory, Jerry made no other reply
than to untie his black silk neckhandkerchief
and throw it upon the floor.</p>

<p>"I say, shipmate," said Jack, "warn't you
once in Jib-boom alley?"</p>

<p>"I disremember," replied Jerry, "whether I was
or not; 'spose I was?"</p>

<p>"I know blasted well you was," replied Jack,
getting more excited, "and you are the highbinder
which took away my young woman, the boy
Jack, one night at old mother Dooqueen's, when
I was swipy."</p>

<p>"Did I?" said Jerry, tauntingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are the very highbinder, which did
that thing," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Do you call me a highbinder, you drunken
swab," exclaimed Jerry, starting upon his feet,
and at the same time pulling off his shirt, and
flourishing his fists in the air.</p>

<p>Jack Snaggs no sooner witnessed this feat,
than he imitated it without the least possible delay,
and made a pass at Jerry with one of his
huge fists. But the other sailors interfered, and
said if there was going to be a fight, it should be
done in ship-shape fashion or not at all. They
then pulled a chest into the middle of the floor,
and having placed the two combatants astride of
it, with their faces to each other, at a proper distance
apart, they fixed them in their places
by driving a couple of nails through the seats of
their trowsers to prevent them from rising and
closing in.</p>

<p>Jerry squared his arms, and looked with an undaunted
eye upon his antagonist; but I trembled
with fright when I contrasted his slight and delicate
form with that of Jack Snaggs, who, now
that he had divested himself of his shirt, displayed
a broad chest covered with crispy hair, and an
arm with prodigious muscular developments; my
heart was in my month, and I felt that the only
hope for Jerry was, that liquor might have rendered
that arm powerless.</p>

<p>They made several ineffectual passes at each
other, and at last Jerry succeeded in giving his
antagonist a blow in his left eye, which immediately
began to swell and turn black. Jack, however,
didn't appear to notice it, but sparred away,
and presently Jerry got a blow in his chest which
staggered him for a moment, and then, as if he
had received new vigor from the effects of it, he
plied his fists so well, and parried his antagonist's
blows with such dexterity, that he soon planted
another blow on his right eye, which evidently discomposed
him, so much so, that it was plain to
perceive he threw about his fists at random, and
although he had a decided advantage in the
length of his arms, yet Jerry, from the quickness
of his motions, soon succeeded in gaining complete
mastery over him, when the sailors interfered,
and declared Jerry the victor. Poor Jack
was dreadfully disfigured; the blood was streaming
from his mouth and nostrils, and his eyes
were frightfully swollen; he acknowledged that
Jerry had flogged him fairly, and threw his arms
around his neck, and wept like a child. I could
not refrain from weeping myself to see him, apparently
without a particle of animosity, take the
young sailor in his arms, who had so beaten and
bruised him, and hug him to his shaggy breast,
while tears, mingled with blood, ran down his
rough face.

<p>One of the sailors took a bottle of brandy out
of his chest, and washed the faces and hands of
both the combatants, and it was discovered that
they were neither of them as badly hurt as they
appeared to be. As soon as Jack could speak,
he declared it was the first time he had been licked
since his name was Snaggs.</p>

<p>"Your name ain't Snaggs?" said Jerry.</p>

<p>"But it is though," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"What, Jack Snaggs?" exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>"Ay, Jack Snaggs," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Wasn't you in the Vandilly?" inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>"I was quarter-gunner of that barkey," replied
Jack.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I may be turned ashore on a
grating, with a pig for a coxswain, if I wouldn't
sooner have struck my old mother than you.
Don't you remember your old chummy, Bill
Bowlin, the side boy, who was put into the mizen
top?"</p>

<p>"Remember you, yes," said Jack, trying to
pull open his swollen eye lids, "but you said your
name was Bowhorn."</p>

<p>"T'other was only a purser's name," said Jerry,
"but my real name is Jeremiah Bowhorn."</p>

<p>This discovery, of course, caused a good deal
of talk and wonder, and more drinking, and more
singing had to follow. While we were in the middle
of a roaring chorus, Mr. Ruffin, the mate,
came to the forecastle scuttle, and called out,
"hallo, there below!"</p>

<p>"Hull high, and you won't break your shins,"
answered Jerry.</p>

<p>"Do you know who you are talking to?" said
Mr. Ruffin, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know who you are," replied Jerry,
"you were picked up along shore, the other day,
with an eye out."</p>

<p>"What is that you say?" called out Mr. Ruffin
in great anger.</p>

<p>"Our Sal says she seed you in the museum for
a show," replied another of the sailors, mimicking
the voice of an old woman.</p>

<p>"Come up on deck, and keep watch, you rascal,"
said Mr. Ruffin.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better keep it yourself, as you
are up there," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Come up at once," said Mr. Ruffin, "or I'll
be down among you in less time than a cat can
lick her ear."</p>

<p>"Come along," growled Jack Snaggs, "and
I'll straiten that 'ere crooked eye of yourn."</p>

<p>Nothing will rouse a man's temper like an allusion
to his personal blemishes; and he will fight
in defence of his deformities when his character
might be assailed with impunity. The reply of
Jack Snaggs brought Mr. Ruffin into the forecastle
at a bound, as soon as the words were uttered.
The stairs which led into the forecastle had been
removed to make more room, and it showed no
small degree of courage in Mr. Ruffin, to intrude
himself among us, as there was no way for him to
retreat. He had no sooner landed on the floor,
than somebody put out the light, and with one
accord they all fell afoul of him and beat him until
he cried murder. Feeling certain that I should
have abundant cause to wish for an opportunity to
do so, before the voyage should be ended, I could
not restrain an inclination to give him two or three
smart kicks myself. At last he begged for mercy,
and the sailors took him up and helped him on
deck; and glad enough, no doubt, he was to escape
with the breath in his body.</p>

<p>They struck a light again as soon as they had
disposed of Mr. Ruffin, and to their utter dismay,
discovered that in the scuffle the keg of whiskey
had been overturned, and all the liquor spilled.
It was immediately determined that Jack Snaggs
should go on deck and ask permission of the
mate to go ashore and get a fresh supply of
grog, and if he should refuse, as it was presumed
he would, all hands were to rush up and
seize the mate, tie him to the fife rail, and then
take the boat and go ashore.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the next chapter with what
success this plan was carried into execution.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>According to promise, relates how Mr. Ruffin was tied to the
fife rail, and how the sailors went ashore in the jolly boat,
and how they returned again.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. PATERSON, the second mate, having been
married only the night before, had obtained permission
from the captain to sleep ashore with his
wife; the cook was drunk in his berth; so there
was nobody for the mate to call to his assistance
but the steward; it was not, therefore, a very
valiant feat which my shipmates had undertaken
to perform.</p>

<p>Jack Snaggs went on deck, and found Mr. Ruffin
walking fore and aft, with his arms folded, and
his mind, no doubt, busily employed in devising
plans for "working up" the sailors when he should
get them off soundings, to pay them for the drubbing
they had given him.</p>

<p>"What the h&mdash; do you want?" he growled
out, as Jack approached him.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Jack, in a supplicating
voice, "I left all my white shirts ashore at
the washerwoman's, and I want to borrow the loan
of the jolly-boat to go after them."</p>

<p>"Go below, you mutinous scoundrel," replied
the mate, "or I'll blow your brains out." At the
same time he called to the steward to bring him
his pistols.</p>

<p>But Mr. Snaggs was not a man to stand still
and have his brains blown out; so he caught Mr.
Ruffin in his arms, and held him fast, until the men,
who were waiting to hear a scuffle, rushed on
deck, and according to previous arrangement,
bound him hand and foot, and then lashed him to
the fife rail. The steward, in the mean time, had
come on deck with the pistols, and Mr. Ruffin ordered
him to shoot Jack Snaggs, but he declined
doing any such thing, saying he didn't ship for it.
Jerry had sense enough to reflect that pistols were
dangerous instruments, so he took them out of
the negro's hands, and threw them overboard.
They then lowered away the jolly boat, and finding
themselves masters of the ship, they came to the
conclusion that they would take their chests
ashore with them, for fear they might wish to remain
after they got there. One of the sailors
said they could go before the Mayor and swear
they were afraid of their lives, and that would
clear them from all harm. They accordingly put
all their baggage into the boat, and insisted that
I should go with them; but I was afraid of the
consequences, and refused to go. They made me
promise that I would not release the mate, and
then they jumped into the boat, gave three cheers,
and pushed off. As soon as they were gone, I
jumped down into the forecastle, crept into a berth,
and snored away with all my might, pretending to
be fast asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruffin was no sooner set at liberty by the
steward, than he came forward, swearing and cursing
most horribly; he jumped down into the forecastle,
and going to the berth where the black
cook was fast asleep, began to flog him with a
piece of tarred rope; but finding he could not
wake up the negro, he came to the berth where I
lay, probably attracted by the noise I made
through my nose, in trying to appear as though I
was sound asleep, and the first thing I perceived
was a stinging cut across my shoulder from a
rope's end. I started up to avoid a repetition.
"Haul yourself out of that, you green horn,"
exclaimed Mr. Ruffin, "and come upon deck and
keep watch." So without any opposition, I followed
Mr. Ruffin on deck; he ordered me to keep
watch for the remainder of the night, and to
rouse him at seven bells in the morning; he
then went below, and after knocking the steward
down, and kicking him for falling, he went to
bed.</p>

<p>I paced the deck until I grew weary and sleepy,
and then I wrapped myself up in a monkey jacket
and lay down, and was soon lost in sleep.
Dreams are not often interesting at second hand,
so I shall not intrude upon my kind reader those
with which I was visited on this occasion.</p>

<p>I felt a sudden twinge at my ear, which brought
me upon my feet, and opening my eyes, the first
object I saw was the ugly face of Mr. Ruffin.
"This is a pretty way to keep watch," said the
mate; "the sun has been up these two hours."

<p>"I dare say," I replied, rubbing my eyes.</p>

<p>I felt stiff and lame, and it was some time before I
could move myself with my accustomed activity.
Mr. Ruffin made a signal of distress, by hoisting the
ensign union down, and very soon Captain Gunnel
came off with a boat full of men. The mate related
to him the particulars of the last night's rebellion,
with a few gratuitous additions respecting
his own valorous achievements; at which Captain
Gunnel was so enraged, that he called the steward
to him, and then knocked him down the cabin
stairs, for having refused to shoot Jack Snaggs;
he then struck the cook over the head with an iron
soup ladle, and shook his finger at me in a threatening
manner. After having promised to do a good
many horrible things, he got into the boat and
started for the shore, and in less than an hour, he
returned with the ship's jolly boat, and all the deserters;
but they were as drunk as lords, and Mr.
Ruffin, the cook, and myself, were forced to hoist
them on board. Another boat came off soon after,
with half a dozen riggers, and the pilot; the wind
springing up fair, the ship was got underway, and
we were soon outside of the Hook, and before sunset,
the Highlands of Neversink looked like a little
blue speck in the horizon.</p>

<p>The first three days I was deadly sick, and I am
entirely ignorant of every thing that took place
during that time. The fourth day I began to recover
my appetite, and as it returned I devoured the
coarse food voraciously, which my stomach had
refused to receive before. I gradually gained
strength, and ran up and down the rigging without
fear, and felt as happy and as careless as the porpoises,
which leaped about our ship's bows. All
the sailors, with the exception of Jack Snaggs, had
recovered from the effects of their dissipation, and
they jumped at the call of Mr. Ruffin, and appeared
to obey his orders with as hearty a will as
though nothing had ever happened between them.
Captain Gunnell had lain aside his white waistcoat
and ruffle shirt, and made his appearance on the
quarter deck, in a dress not much better than a
sailors. I have no doubt he felt himself much more
at his ease, than he did when dressed up in his
shore suit.</p>

<p>The weather was bright and warm, and every
thing appeared joyous and pleasant; the ship
bounded and dashed through the water, leaving a
foaming white track behind her, and throwing the
spray from her bows like drifts of snow; the very
waves appeared to leap up with pleasure, and the
glorious sun seemed to look down upon us with
intelligent kindness, for there was not another object
that we could see upon the waters, to be gladdened
by his beams; and at night the stars twinkled
merrily and brightly, as though they kept watch
over our destinies; the winds and the waves made
music expressly for our ears, at least I could not
but think so, for there were none to participate
with us in these delights. I was very happy, and
had it not been for thoughts of home, and dreams of
Georgiana De Lancey, I could have remained forever
at sea; at least I felt so then. Every day I
learned the name of some new rope, and added to
my nautical accomplishments, by practising, in my
watch below, the art of making running bowlines
and turk's heads.</p>

<p>I have said that all hands had recovered from
the effects of their drinking, but Jack Snaggs; he,
unfortunately, had contrived to smuggle on board
in his chest a jug of rum, of which he drank so
constantly, that the delirium tremens, or, as the
sailors called it, the horrors, was the consequence.
It was a melancholy sight to see a stout vigorous
man, like Jack, stand with terrified looks, and cry
out that the evil one was in pursuit of him; when
ever he laid down in his berth, he would exclaim,
"there he is, there he is&mdash;save me, save me,"
and then the sweat would start upon his forehead,
and his teeth would chatter like a man's in an ague
fit.</p>

<p>On the fifth day after we left port, towards sunset,
a heavy black cloud was seen in the horizon
ahead, and, as it grew dark, a constant succession
of flashes of vivid lightning appeared to dart from
it. The sailors said we were getting into the Gulph
Stream. The cloud began to rise as we approached
it, and the air grew warm and oppressive. We
were soon in thick darkness, which was relieved,
however, by continual flashes of lightning; the
thunder pealed and rattled over our heads, and our
ship trembled like a leaf; soon the rain came
down in torrents, and sudden gusts of wind assailed
us on either quarter. Fortunately, we had
shortened sail, and made every preparation for a
storm before it grew dark. The courses were
hauled up, the topsails close reefed, the jib and
spanker hauled down, and a storm staysail set. All
hands had been called upon deck, except Jack
Snaggs, who, on account of his horrors, was allowed
to remain below; and we all stood huddled
together, on the quarter deck, that we might be in
readiness to carry into execution any orders which
should be given. For my own part, I enjoyed the
sublimity of the scene highly, and felt not the least
fear; indeed, the only thing which annoyed me was
the water running down my back, which rather
dampened my admiration of the tempest. The
sky was pitch black, but the sea was covered with
little particles of luminous matter, so numerous and
so bright, that they cast a greenish glare upon our
ship, and showed in strong relief all her spars and
ropes against the sky; in addition to this strange
and unnatural light, a ball of phosphorescent matter
had gathered at each mast head, and at the ends
of the yards, and gave the ship the appearance of
being illuminated with goblin lanterns. These were
novel sights to me, but to the sailors, and even to
Captain Gunnel and the mate, they were sights of
terror; these men who, on ordinary occasions,
were full of ribald jests and wanton oaths, now
stood with hushed voices, apparently waiting for
some expected evil. They knew from experience,
the dangers which surrounded them; but I, from
ignorance, was without fear or apprehension. I
stood looking over the gunnel, watching the
lightning as it crinkled along on the surface of the
waves, when a shrill cry rising above the tumult of
the elements, and the pelting of the rain and the
roaring of the thunder, caused all hands to start
with fear. The sound came from the forward part
of the ship, and I recognized in it the voice of
Jack Snaggs; a flash of lightning the next moment
showed the poor wretch standing between the
night heads, with his hands thrown above his
head, as if preparing to leap into the ocean.
"Bear a hand forward," exclaimed the captain,
"and save him be quick." But it was too late;
we heard him as he plunged, and I ran to the ship's
side, and caught a glimpse of him struggling in
the water; we threw overboard all the loose articles
about deck, but they were of no avail; it was
the last we ever saw of poor Jack.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p>Will bring us into port.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next morning we were out of the Gulph,
and the sky was as blue, the wind as fair, and the
sun as bright and as warm as before; the waves
again seemed to leap up with joy, and the ship
bounded and dashed through the water as gayly as
ever; and I should have forgotten the events of the
night before, had it not been that Jack Snaggs
was missing from our mess.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Mr. Ruffin, the mate.</p>

<p>"Sir?" said I.</p>

<p>"Take a slush shoe, and go up aloft and grease
the peril of the maintopsail yard; the slush was all
washed off by the rain last night."</p>

<p>"I don't comprehend you, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Don't what?" exclaimed the mate.</p>

<p>"I don't comprehend you."</p>

<p>"What the h&mdash; is that? don't spout any of
your dictionary to me, but go do as I order you."</p>

<p>All hands, except the man at the wheel, were
aloft, some at one mast head and some at another;
there was no one to whom I could apply for information,
and I had not the most vague idea of what
a peril could be. However, I thought, I will go
up and grease the maintopsail yard all over, and
then I shall be sure of greasing the peril. So I
got a bucket of warm grease from the cook, and,
not without a good deal of difficulty, succeeded in
getting it into the main top. I sat the bucket of
grease down in the top to rest myself, and at the
same time to take a look at the maintopsail yard,
to see if there was any curious looking article
about it, that probably bore the name of a peril.
But I could see nothing which apparently needed
greasing. I looked down on deck again, and observing
that the Captain and Mr. Ruffin were busy
on the quarter deck looking at the sun, with their
quadrants, it occurred to me that I might slip
down on deck, and get my Blunt's Navigator out
of the forecastle, and take it up into the top with me,
where I could look for the meaning of the puzzling
word at my leisure. I accordingly left the bucket of
warm grease standing in the top, and slid down on
deck by the mainstay, and got into the forecastle
unperceived; but I had scarcely got the Navigator
into my hand, when I heard a terrible outcry
on deck, and Mr. Ruffin calling out my name with
all his might. I dropped the Navigator, and jumped
upon deck, and it was not long before I found
out the cause of the tumult.</p>

<p>Now it happened, that in consequence of Captain
Gunnell having got all his sea clothes wet the
night before, he had been obliged to dress himself
in his long shore suit, while his other duds, as he
called them, were hung up on the spanker boom
to dry; it being also clean shirt day with Mr.
Ruffin, he too had dressed himself in a new calico
shirt and a blue roundabout, for which he paid two
pound ten to a Liverpool tailor, and which was as
good as new, for Mr. Ruffin having a wife and
half a dozen children, was very careful of his
clothes. Now, Captain Gunnell and Mr. Ruffin,
as I have observed before, were on the quarter
deck, taking an observation of the sun, but as the
wind was drawing aft, and the ship kept coming
up, the maintopsail kept dodging against the sun,
and obstructing their view, so they took their stations
amidships directly under the maintop, where
they could have a better sight.</p>

<p>"Does she rise yet?" asked Capt. Gunnell,
putting his quadrant to his eye, and turning his
face upward; "does she rise, sir?" for sailors
call every thing she, even the sun.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," replied the mate, who also had
his face turned upward, with one eye shut, and
the other applied to his quadrant, while his mouth
was wide open.</p>

<p>It unluckily happened that while the captain
and mate were in this position, the man at the
wheel put his hand in his pocket to feel for his tobacco,
and a sea striking the ship at the same
moment under the counter, the wheel was knocked
out of his other hand, which caused the ship
suddenly to broach to, and the motion overturned
the bucket of warm grease in the top, and down
came a torrent of slush, which covered the Captain
and his mate from head to foot; and not a small
quantity found its way down Mr. Ruffin's throat.
Of course there was no observation got that day. I
cannot pretend to relate what happened after I came
upon deck, for I was so much terrified when I discovered
the mischief that was done, as to be quite
beside myself. The captain ordered Mr. Ruffin to
flog me, and swore he would send me back to the
States in irons, by the first man of war he should
meet with, to be tried for my life. He threatened,
besides, to feed me on bread and water the remainder
of the voyage, and to stop all my wages,
to pay for his clothes which I had spoiled.</p>

<p>I told Captain Gunnell the reason of my leaving
the grease bucket in the top; and after that,
neither he nor the mate ever refused to explain
the meaning of any term which I did not understand.</p>

<p>It was more than two months after we left the
Hook, when, at day break in the morning, we
made the land on our lee bow. It proved to be
Cape St. Marys, at the mouth of the Rio de la
Plata, and as the wind was fair, we were soon
making our way up the yellow waters of this famous
river. We passed by Monte Video with
out dropping anchor, and on the fourth day after
entering the river, we were moored in five fathom
hole, opposite Buenos Ayres. Captain Gunnell
dressed himself in his greasy blue suit, and went
ashore in the jolly boat. He sent back orders to
the mate not to allow a soul to leave the ship. I
was grieved to hear this order, for I longed to set
my feet once more upon dry land; and the sight
of the domes and towers rising above the flat roofs
of the distant city, excited the strongest curiosity
in me to have a nearer view of them. I had
heard extravagant stories told of the magnificence
of the old churches, which were erected in
this city by the Jesuits, when the province abounded
with gold and silver; of crucifixes of solid
ingots, and altars and images of gold, sparkling
with precious stones. Night after night, when
the labor of the day was over, have I sat gazing at
the faint and glimmering lights ashore, until I fell
asleep, and dreamed of walking with black eyed
Spanish girls beneath the lofty roof of some cathedral,
the floors of which were paved with pure
gold.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ruffin was determined that dreams
like these should never be realized. It was a favorite
maxim with him, to obey orders if you
break owners; and I do not believe he would
have consented for a man to leave the ship if she
had been sinking. He was one of those strict
disciplinarians, who will keep the letter of the
law, even though they break the spirit of it in
so doing.</p>

<p>Jerry Bowhorn and I had become fast friends,
and he was as anxious as myself to go ashore,
though from different motives; he wanted to see
the girls, and have a blow out of grog, and I
wanted to see the churches and hear the women
talk Spanish. Had Jack Snaggs been living,
we would have tied the mate to the fife rail, and
gone ashore in spite of him, and the Captain's orders.
There was no one in the forecastle besides
Jerry to whom I could have safely trusted a
plan for committing such an outrage, and, even
had I been disposed to do so, we were all so tired
and weary with hard work when it came night,
that we were glad enough to lay down to rest.
There is nothing which will so effectually quell
discontent, and put an end to a revolt, as good hard
work; a man who is tired to death with labor has
but an indifferent appetite for treason.</p>

<p>At last an opportunity offered for both Jerry
and myself to gratify our desires. We had been
in the roads almost three weeks, and we had not
seen Captain Gunnell during that time, when at
the close of a dark and blustering day, he came
on board in a shore boat, which he dismissed as
soon as he left her. I thought he had taken a
very strange time to visit us, but I was glad to
see him again, although he didn't put himself to
the trouble of speaking to me. He was dressed
in a new suit of clothes, and I thought he looked
remarkably fine; indeed it was so long since I
had seen any body besides Mr. Ruffin and the
swarthy custom house officer, that he must have
looked very bad indeed for me to have thought
otherwise.</p>

<p>As soon as the Captain came on board, he took
the custom house officer on one side, and I observed
they were in very earnest conversation.
The officer at last shrugged his shoulders, and
was walking away, when the Captain took a roll
of bank bills, as I supposed, from his pocket
book, and gave him, upon which they resumed
their conversation, and then the Captain ordered
the jolly boat to be lowered away, and Jerry and
I were told to get into her. I obeyed the order
with great alacrity, thinking an opportunity had
come of visiting the city. But Jerry told me I
had no great cause for rejoicing, as he understood
perfectly well the nature of the expedition on
which we were bound; he said the Captain had
chosen a stormy night for smuggling some goods
on shore, and that he had bribed the custom
house officer to assist him in landing them. "How
ever," said Jerry, "if you choose to join me, we
will work a traverse, and get ashore in spite of
them."</p>

<p>I told him I would join him in any thing he
might propose or undertake short of murder and
robbery, for my desire to go ashore amounted to
a frenzy.</p>

<p>Jerry's supposition proved true; the jolly boat
was filled with small packages of light goods,
and then the Captain and the custom house officer
got into her, and we shoved off from the ship,
and began to pull in for the shore, the second mate
acting as coxswain, while Jerry and I pulled at
the oars. The night was dark and stormy, and
the waves ran high, which caused us to make but
little headway. I rowed with all my might, but
the Captain got angry, and swore at me for not
rowing better. I had never been accustomed to
handle an oar, and I suppose I exerted myself
twice as much as was necessary, for, by the time
we reached the shore, my hands and arms
were so violently cramped I could hardly move
them.</p>

<p>The faithless guardian of the customs pointed
to a spot opposite to the Recolata, a spacious cemetery,
with a large chapel for the performance of
the burial services, as being the best and most secure
place to land the goods; but the boat was
deep, and there being no pier, we could not approach
very near to the beach. So the Captain
asked Jerry if he thought he could carry him
ashore on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Certainly I can, sir," replied Jerry, "I could
carry two just like you."</p>

<p>"But, consider," said Captain Gunnell, "I
am very heavy, much heavier than you think I
am."</p>

<p>"And I am very strong in my back," replied
Jerry, "I was always considered so; I once carried
old Commodore Pottgut ashore on my back,
in Ballyparaso."</p>

<p>"You did?" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," replied Jerry, "when I
was in the States' service."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Captain, "if you carried
him, you can carry me, I know."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Jerry jumped into the water,
which was almost up to his middle, and Captain
Gunnell tucked the tails of his coat under his
arms, and took the watch out of his fob, and held
it in his hand to prevent it from getting wet in
case of an accident, and then mounted himself
upon Jerry's shoulders. He was a pretty good
load, but Jerry, as he said, was very strong in
his back, and he bore off his burden very steadily,
but not exactly in the direction of the shore.
When he had gone about three times the length
of the boat, he suddenly stopped, and gave a
loud scream.</p>

<p>"Hush, you rascal," said the Captain, in a
suppressed voice, "you will alarm the guard."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," roared Jerry, "I have got
the cramp. Oh!"</p>

<p>"Silence, you villain," exclaimed the Captain;
"if you let me drop, I'll send you on board the
prison ship, and have you flogged."</p>

<p>"O, Captain Gunnell," again shouted Jerry,
"I shall let you drop unless somebody comes to
my assistance. Come here, Franco, and lend
me a hand to keep the Captain from falling."</p>

<p>"Jump," said the second mate, "before he lets
the Captain fall."</p>

<p>I didn't wait to be ordered a second time, but
leaped into the water, and Jerry seeing me coming
towards him, suddenly shook his burden from
his shoulders, and called to me to follow him, and
off we started, leaving the Captain floundering in
the water. We soon reached the shore, and
climbed up a steep bank, and ran about half a
mile, without stopping either to speak or look behind
us.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p>Relates what happened after getting ashore.</p>

</div>

<p>"THERE is no danger," said Jerry, "that we
shall be pursued to-night," as we stopped to take
breath, "so let us find a place to lodge in, and in
the morning we will look about us."</p>

<p>Although I was wet and weary, my hands covered
with blisters, and the night was dark, and
the wind was cold, yet my spirits were light as a
feather. The uncertainty of our prospects, and
a curiosity to see what the morning's light would
reveal, kept my thoughts from dwelling on the
destitute condition in which we were placed.
We were outside of the town, but there were no
indications that we were in the immediate vicinity
of a populous city, and there was neither a tree,
nor a house to be seen. It was as still and as
desolate as the great desert.</p>

<p>"Come," said Jerry, "let us get amongst the
houses, and I will soon hunt out something to eat,
and a bed, never fear."</p>

<p>"Have you got any money?" I inquired, for
I began to fear it would be no easy matter to
procure food and lodging without it.</p>

<p>"Not so much as would jingle on a tombstone,"
replied Jerry, "but I have got something
that we can make a raise with, I dare say; here's
the captain's watch. I caught it out of his hand
to keep it from getting wet, and forgot to stop
and return it to him."</p>

<p>I was very sorry to hear this, and told Jerry
I would never consent to his selling the watch,
nor take any part of the proceeds of it; but he
succeeded in silencing my scruples, by reminding
me that the wages which were due us, and the
clothes which we had left behind, would repay the
captain for the loss of his watch.</p>

<p>We turned our faces towards the city, and
soon found ourselves in a dark, narrow street,
with low, flat-roofed houses on each side, having
windows with iron bars and gratings, which gave
them the appearance of prisons. We walked
some distance down this street without meeting
any one, or seeing a light in any of the houses.
At length we came to a house which give some
evidences of its being inhabited. A light was
streaming from a half-opened door, into which I
peeped, and discovered a swarthy looking man
with long black hair hanging down his shoulders;
he wore a conical shaped red cap, and a green
jacket, embroidered with silk braid; he was sitting
on a low stool, singing in a subdued voice,
and thrumming on a guitar; at a table, on which
were standing a brown jug and two or three tumblers,
were seated two men dressed similarly to
the other, apparently amusing themselves by
making passes at each other with long, murderous-looking
knives, which they parried with great
dexterity; they formed a highly picturesque group;
but thinking the society of gentlemen who amused
themselves after such a fashion, not very desirable,
we continued our walk in search of a house of
more promising appearance, until we came to a
cross street, which by the aid of a very dim lamp
we discovered was the <i>Calle Viente Cinco de
Mayo</i>. By the captain's watch it was near midnight,
and we began to be apprehensive that we
should be compelled to spend a sleepless and a
supperless night in the streets, for we could neither
see a soul stirring, nor catch the glimpse of a
light in any of the houses. As we stood hesitating
which way to turn next, our ears were suddenly
gladdened by a shout of many voices from the
house opposite to where we were standing, and
the oaths and expressions which we heard assured
us they were not uttered by Spaniards. We
knocked loudly at the door of the house without
any hesitation, and it was soon opened by a tall
muscular looking man in a blue jacket, who exclaimed,
upon seeing us, "d&mdash;n your souls, what
do you want?"</p>

<p>"We want something to eat, and a bed," said
Jerry.</p>

<p>"The divil take your carcasses then," said the
man, "why didn't you come before?"</p>

<p>"Because we couldn't get ashore," replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>"Have you run away from your ship?" asked
the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Yankees too. Och faith, it is all right; come
in, and go back into the abbey, and tell the cook
to give you some beef. But stop, and take a drop
of brandy first." We walked in, and he bolted
the door again.</p>

<p>There were about twenty sailors seated at a
long table, with cards in their hands, pipes in their
mouths, and glasses standing before them. They
had apparently just arrived at that point in good
fellowship and merry-making, where a man feels
himself impelled to call his friend a thief and a
liar, and to strike any one in the face who may
happen to sit along side of him. But as Jerry
and myself were perfectly sober, of course we felt
no disposition to participate in their boisterous
mirth, but on the contrary we regarded them with
feelings which would have done honor to a tetotaller.
We passed on through this apartment,
preceded by the man who admitted us, into a
little square building, which he called the "round
house;" here he ordered the cook, who was a
one-legged old sailor, to give us some supper.
The cook placed before us, with very little delay,
a huge piece of roast beef, a couple of very small
loaves of bread, and a pitcher of aqua vit&aelig;.</p>

<p>When the keen edge of our appetites was taken
off, we asked the cook, who was solacing himself
with a paper cigar, what the name of our entertainer
was.</p>

<p>"None of your gammon, my coveys," replied
the cook, "you know Jemmy as well as I do."</p>

<p>"If that is the name of the landlord here," I
replied, "I can swear that I never heard of him
before."</p>

<p>The cook having given vent to his astonishment
in a multitude of curious oaths, informed us
that our entertainer was Irish Jemmy, who had
deserted many years before from an English Sloop
of War, but who now kept a house for runaway
sailors, and who was universally known as the
sailors friend.</p>

<p>"Jemmy is the best man as ever lived," said the
cook; "he will feed you on beef and rum as long
as you have a mind to stay in his house, and never
ask you when you are going; and when you do
go, if you haven't got a jacket, he'll give you one.
But then you musn't make him mad."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Jerry, "who would make such a
man mad?"</p>

<p>"Why, you might do it by accident, and then
he would as lief kill you as drink a horn of brandy,"
replied the cook.</p>

<p>"He never did kill any one, did he?" I asked,
somewhat alarmed at the cook's account.</p>

<p>"He shot his wife wonst in this very blessed
room," replied the cook, in a low voice, "Cos
as she disputed him when he was swipy."</p>

<p>"And why didn't the authorities arrest him,
and hang him," I asked.</p>

<p>"What, just for shooting his wife?" replied the
cook; "you may tell your mammy when you see
her, they don't do such things in this here country.
Besides, if she didn't wish to be shooted, she
oughtent to have disputed him; warn't he her husband?
Sarved her right."</p>

<p>"Did she die?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Dead as a door nail. And now he's got
another reg'lar nice young heifer," replied the
cook.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Jerry, "he never so much
as winks one of his blackguard eyes at his customers,
if he does shoot his wives."</p>

<p>"Don't he?" replied the cook; "why bless yer
heart, 'twas him as broke my leg, cos I made him
mad."</p>

<p>"He break your leg," said Jerry, letting his
knife fall.</p>

<p>"To be sure he did," replied the cook, "what
on it. I don't care; he's got to find me in grub
all the rest o' my days, besides all the new duck
I want for frocks and trowsers. I am nothing but
an old bugger, it makes no odds whether I've got
one leg or two; I'm not running arter the gals,
like you young chaps."</p>

<p>"Are you an American?" I asked, feeling my
sympathies excited for the old cook.</p>

<p>"Me a yankee!" replied the cook, disdainfully.
"No, I am a reg'lar born cockerny. Do you
know what that is? A real citizen of Lunnun,"
he continued, answering his own question; "and
do you know what makes me a citizen of Lunnun?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is because you were born there,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"No, that ain't it, young feller," he replied.</p>

<p>"Because you were born in Bow Bells," replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>"That ain't it," said the cook. "It's because I
was born in the cells of New-Gate, you green
horn; I knew you couldn't tell." And so saying,
the old cook hobbled away with the remains of
the beef, chuckling at the recollection of his illustrious
birth.</p>

<p>I was not particularly well pleased with the
cook's account of Irish Jemmy, so I proposed to
Jerry to start for the pampas in the morning, and
wait there until our ship should sail. Jerry agreed
to do so; and as he had fortunately brought a
pistol ashore with him, he swore if Irish Jemmy
offered to harm a hair of my head, he would shoot
him without any hesitation. But as we had eaten
Jemmy's beef, and drank his brandy, I told Jerry
we would first talk about paying him, and then we
could shoot him afterwards, if there should be any
necessity for doing so.</p>

<p>Jerry acknowledged this was right and proper,
and said he would leave the Captain's watch in
pledge, until we might return. But when we
proposed it to Jemmy, he would listen to no such
thing.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," he said, "don't bother me with your
nonsense. Put up your watch; you may eat and
drink here as long as you like in welcome, for
nothing, if you only pay me out of your advance,
when you get a ship."</p>

<p>He said we might go out into the camp if we
chose, and if we escaped the Montaneros and the
Indians, we should find a hearty welcome at any
estancia or saladara, that we might fall in with,
where, if we were fond of jerked beef and farina,
we might stay forever, and no questions would he
asked us.</p>

<p>We were delighted to hear so good an account
of the hospitable habits of the Gauchos, and retired
to bed, with an intention of setting out for the
country as soon as it should be light. But the
fleas prevented us from closing our eyes, and as we
found it was impossible to sleep, we set off before
the day broke.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p>Adventures in the Pampas, a Pampara, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>WE made our exit from the town by the same
narrow street through which we entered it the night
before; and we made such good use of our legs,
that by the time the sun peeped up above the level
plain, which lay stretched out to the horizon before
us, we could see nothing of the city at our backs,
but the domes and spires of the churches and convents.
Magnificent objects they were at a distance;
but a near view of their dilapidated walls, and the
nasty finery of their interiors, completely dispelled
all the bright dreams in which I had indulged of
their splendor. Alas! alas! that the Cross of
Christ should be elevated on a towering dome,
only to designate a collection of every thing that
is wretched in taste and blasphemous in art.</p>

<p>We continued to trudge on without meeting
with either Gauchos or Montaneros; and as the
day advanced, and our hunger increased, we began
to have serious misgivings of getting neither
jerked beef nor farina for our dinners. But we walked
sturdily on, neither being willing to give out first,
and at last we descried a clump of trees, at the apparent
distance of two or three miles, and shaped our
course for them, expecting to find an estancia; but
on reaching them, they proved to be a small orchard
of peach trees, with the walls of a house
standing near, which appeared recently to have
been burned. The house was surrounded by a
deep ditch, with a small draw bridge. We looked
for something eatable, but in vain. As we were
leaving the place, we discovered a party of horse
men approaching, so we halted for them to come
up. As they were riding at a furious gallop, it
was not long before they were along side of us.
There were four of them; fine cut-throat looking
rascals they were. The foremost and youngest of
them, was a noble looking fellow, and he sat as
easily and as gracefully upon his horse's back, as
though he had been born there. His face was full
and swarthy, his shoulders broad, and his eyes
black and fiery; his long glossy black hair streamed
upon the wind as he rode. On his head he wore
a broad brimmed hat, and over his shoulders a
scarlet poncho, the simplest, but most graceful covering
ever worn upon a man's back. His legs
were bare. The other three were leaner and
dirtier, and their ponchos were coarse and ragged.
One of the horsemen spoke to us in Spanish,
which neither of us could understand; but Jerry
supposing they asked us what we were in search of,
replied, "very much of the beef and the farina,
signors." This they understood as little as we had
understood them, and they directly saluted us in a
manner which we could not fail to feel, if we did
not understand.</p>

<p>The fine looking fellow in the red poncho, drew
his sabre, and gave Jerry a hearty thwack across
his shoulders, with the flat of it; and one of the
ragged rascals at the same time complimented me
in a similar manner, with the handle of a spear,
which he carried in his hand. This had a similar
effect upon both of us, for, without any concerted
action, we immediately took to our legs and scampered
for life; but we soon found ourselves stretched
upon the ground, for these fine fellows had, with
inconceivable dexterity, contrived to throw a small
cord around our heels, with which they tripped us
up. Finding it was impossible to escape, we made
no further attempt, and our captors having bestowed
two or three more whacks upon our shoulders,
motioned to us to get up behind them. As I had
taken a fancy to the wearer of the scarlet poncho,
I mounted behind him, and Jerry got up behind
the ruffian who had belabored me with the handle
of his spear. We were no sooner mounted, than
away they started at a hard gallop; it was with the
greatest difficulty that I made out to keep my seat.
I clung to the scarlet poncho with all my might,
and came near two or three times bringing both
the wearer of it and myself to the ground, for which
I was favored with some of the choicest curses in
the Gaucho dialect. We rode for more than an
hour, without in the least slackening our speed.
By and by, we came to an enclosure, where there
were a great number of horses. The Gauchos dismounted,
and caught, with their lassos, fresh horses
for themselves, and for Jerry and myself. When
they were remounted, they motioned to us to follow
them, and off they started again at a full gallop,
and off came Jerry and myself, almost simultaneously.
Fortunately, neither of us was hurt by
the fall, so we mounted again, and started once
more, and succeeded in keeping our seats; we had
no saddles, and it was terrible hard riding, for we
galloped very hard. Soon, however, my blood
became heated, and the rapidity with which we
scoured over the plain, excited my feelings, and I
experienced a sensation of wild delight, which I
had never felt before. I forgot my hunger, my
bruises, my perilous situation, and the aimless
journey on which I was bound, and thought how
happy I should be if I could but ride on forever
over those boundless plains.</p>

<p>These sensations lasted but a short time; our
horses began, after a while, to flag, their motions
became more uneasy, and my blood began to
cool, and feelings of hunger and weariness began
to oppress me. The sun was sinking in the west,
and a heavy, dull looking cloud, apparently
charged with rain, and wind, and lightning, was
rising in the opposite direction, when we came to
another roofless house, with blackened and smoky
walls, exactly like the one we had left. It was
surrounded by a deep ditch, with a draw bridge,
but there were no peach trees near it. There was
a drove of cattle grazing near, and one of our
captors caught a young bullock with a lasso by
his hind heels, and brought him to the ground;
and another of the Gauchos severed the head of
the animal from his body; it was quick work.
We all dismounted, and from the movement of
the Gauchos, Jerry perceived that they intended
to cook the bullock. So we set ourselves to work,
to collect together a heap of sticks, over which
they erected a gallows, from which they suspended
the carcass, without even divesting it of its skin.
One of the Gaucho's took a little pouch from beneath
a scarlet girdle, which he wore around his
waist, and having struck a light, he set fire to
the heap of sticks, which cracked and snapped
right merrily, and crisped the hide of the bullock.
This manner of roasting beef was entirely novel
to me, and under other circumstances, I might not
have regarded it with very pleasant yearnings;
but as it was, my mouth watered as I stirred up
the fire, and the carcass hissed, and cracked, and
sputtered. My appetite was so keen, it appeared
to me the heighth of human bliss to sit down to
sup off a whole ox.</p>

<p>It grew dark very suddenly, and the sky was
completely overcast with clouds. The fire, as we
stirred it up, and added fresh fagots, cast around
a lurid glare, which fell upon the forms of the
Gauchos, who were stretched out upon the ground,
wrapped in their ponchos, taking a nap, while the
bullock was roasting; the grazing cattle and the
blackened walls of the house were the only other
objects which the light revealed. It was a scene
of savage picturesqueness, and I should have enjoyed
it highly, had I not been so hungry. When
we thought the beef was sufficiently roasted, we
let the fire go down, and called up the Gauchos,
who began immediately to rake away the coals,
and make preparation for taking the bullock down.
But they suddenly stopped, and having listened for
a moment with hushed breath, they began to extinguish
the flaming embers, and to smother the
fire by throwing sand upon it. Judging from the
earnestness with which they set themselves to work,
we conjectured they had some good cause for doing
so, and we aided them with all our might.
Presently the sound of horses' feet was heard,
which grew plainer and plainer every moment;
the practised ears of the Gauchos had enabled
them to distinguish it long before it reached ours.
Having extinguished the fire, they caught their
horses and mounted them, and Jerry and I were
about to do the same, when one of the Gauchos
struck me across the shoulders with his sabre, and
throwing me the end of his lasso, the other being
fastened to a ring in his saddle, pointed to the
roasted carcass, to which I made it fast. I then
mounted my horse; the Gauchos appeared impatient
to be gone, but they walked their horses,
dragging the roasted bullock after them, and
Jerry and I followed in the rear. The tramp of
horses' feet approaching us, grew more and more
distinct, and from the sound there appeared to be
a numerous troop. The Gaucho who was dragging
along the carcass, finding it an incumbrance,
cast off his lasso and left it behind him. We continued
to walk our horses a little further, and then
we came to a halt. The horsemen from whom
we were fleeing were, as I judged from the exclamations
of our captors, a party of Indians, who
were attracted by the light of our fire. If they
had surprised us, they would have cut our throats
first, and then regaled themselves with the bullock
which we had been roasting for our supper; a consummation,
which it was any thing but pleasant to
anticipate.</p>

<p>From the actions of the Gauchos, I concluded
they considered themselves in danger of being
surprised, and I was impatient to start off on
a gallop. Our safety, however, was in the
pitchy darkness of the night, which almost
prevented our seeing each other, although we
were closely huddled together. By and by, the
horsemen reached the spot which we had left, and
came to a halt. They raked open the coals, which
sent up a few glimmering sparks, but not light
enough to reveal the forms of the marauders. We
could hear them yelling and shouting, apparently
giving vent to their disappointment in not finding
their expected prey. Presently we heard them in
motion again, and I thought they were going to
continue on their way, but my heart died within
me, when I discovered that they were riding in a
circuit around us, probably supposing that we
were somewhere in their immediate neighborhood.
From the sound of the horses' feet, there must
have been at least thirty of them. Round and
round they rode, sometimes approaching us so
closely, that we could hear their voices, as they
muttered to themselves. The Gauchos held their
breaths, and ground their teeth; they kept their
sabres in their hands, and their horses reined up
ready for a start. Jerry and myself were closely
huddled together, but we were afraid to speak,
even in a whisper; he trembled like a leaf, and
whether I trembled or not, I came near dying with
fright. I thought that my time was come, and the
prophecy of my cousin about to be fulfilled. I
saw myself, in imagination, with my throat cut
from ear to ear, blasting upon a desert plain, and
I thought of my poor mother, and my heart broken
sister. The horsemen, Indians or Montaneros,
or whatever they were, continued to ride
around and about us, sometimes almost touching
us as they flew past. Once I thought I could distinguish
a dusky form, but before I could assure
myself of it, it was lost in the darkness. At last
the troop halted again, and after giving another
yell, they galloped back in the direction which
they came, and as the sound of their horses feet
grew fainter and fainter, my heart grew stouter
and stouter, and by the time the sound had died
entirely away, thoughts of the roasted bullock began
to intrude themselves into my mind. Doubt
less, the musings of the Gauchos were running in
the same direction, for they dismounted from their
horses, and groped their way back to the ruined
house which we had left, feeling about on the
ground, as they went, and Jerry and I did the
same, but without finding the bullock. Strangely
enough, we were unable to find it at all, and the
Gauchos each lighted a paper cigar, and crawled
up alongside of the half demolished house, and
stretched themselves out to sleep. Happy fellows,
they could solace themselves with the unsubstantial
fumes of a paper segar, and take their rest on
the bare ground without inconvenience. Jerry
and myself sat together on the ground, conjecturing
the probable motives of the Gauchos in making
us their captives, and offering such encouragement
to each other, as our minds could suggest.</p>

<p>Although the sky was filled with black and
heavy clouds, there was not a breath of wind
stirring. The atmosphere was warm and oppressive,
and I experienced a difficulty of respiration.
The horizon in the south-east had for some
time been constantly illuminated with flashes of
lightning, and every thing seemed to give notice
of an approaching storm. One of the Gauchos
started up, and exclaimed, "pampara," upon which
the others withdrew from beneath the walls of the
house, and drew their ponchoes closely about them,
and lay down again in an exposed spot. I looked
to the east, and discovered the cause of the Gaucho's
exclamation. A bright yellowish cloud was
rising rapidly above the horizon, and spreading
itself over the sky; we were not kept long in
ignorance of its quality, for it soon burst, and a
gust of wind and hail swept over us, compared
with which the hardest gale I had ever experienced
was a gentle zephyr. It was well with the Gauchos
that they had crawled away from the walls
of the house, for they were prostrated in a moment.
As we were unable to stand upon our feet, we
threw ourselves upon the ground, with our faces
down, and a cloud of dust and leaves, branches
of trees, sticks, hail-stones, and fire, passed over
our backs. I was expecting every moment to
hear the troop of horsemen rush by on the wings
of the wind. The uproar and hurly burly of the
elements did not continue long; but when the tumult
began to subside, the rain began to pour down in
torrents. The Gauchos raised themselves up,
made the sign of the cross, muttered their prayers,
and laid down again, and apparently they soon fell
asleep. But I was not used to sleeping under
such circumstances, and, if I could have slept with
the rain pouring down upon me, my fears would
have kept me awake. Jerry himself was nodding,
and I was left alone to my reflections.</p>

<p>It was very evident that the Gauchos had no
intention of robbing us, for they had made no
attempt to search our persons, and I could not
believe that they had made captives of us for the
mere pleasure of beating us; the only use to
which I imagined they could put us, was to compel
us to join them on some perilous expedition
against the Indians.</p>

<p>That was an enterprise for which I had not the
least possible inclination. There was neither
profit nor honor to be gained in it; nothing that
would enable me either to gain the affections of
Georgiana De Lancey, or to triumph over my
haughty cousin. Weak and exhausted as I was,
and hopeless as the attempt seemed, I resolved to
make an effort to escape, and find my way back
to Buenos Ayres. It so happened that on the
afternoon in which I left the ship, I had taken the
pocket handkerchief of Georgiana De Lancey,
and tied it about my neck underneath my shirt,
and now pressing it to my heart, I thought of its
lovely owner, and the blood seemed to start with
quickened pulsations through my veins; it gave
me new life and fresh vigor to go through with
my resolution.</p>

<p>I jogged my companion, and told him what I
had resolved to do; he was at first loth to join me,
fearing that, if the Gauchos should awake before
we could make our escape, they would murder us
for making the attempt. But I soon prevailed
upon him to accompany me, and we crept away
from where the Gauchos were sleeping, upon our
hands and knees, until we were securely out of
their hearing. We were lucky in catching two
of the horses which were within the enclosure of
the ditch, and having walked them quietly over
the little bridge, we mounted them, and turning
our backs to the rain, galloped away as fast as
they would carry us. I felt at first very stiff and
sore, but the motion of the horse soon made me
feel warm and supple. We galloped away at the
imminent risk of breaking our necks till daylight
appeared, when the rain began to abate, and the
wind to lull. We were far enough from the Gauchos
to have no fear of them; but there was no
house in sight, and I felt that I could not hold out
much longer without food or rest. We continued
to ride until the sun was above the horizon, when
our eyes were gladdened by the sight of a house,
a long way off, with wreaths of blue smoke ascending
from the chimney; it was the most beautiful
sight that ever met my eyes; never before
did smoke find favor with me. We turned our
horses heads directly for the smoking chimney,
and when we got to the house, which was only a
rude hut, we dismounted from our horses, and
walked in without any ceremony. Our appearance
told our tale; there was no need of words,
even though we could have spoken them. The
inmate of the hut understood our wants, and
treated us kindly. In the centre of the floor was
a bright fire, on one side of which, stuck upon a
long stick, was half of a sheep roasting, and suspended
over the fire from the end of a pole was a
pot boiling and bubbling, and sending forth a
savory odor, which caused the water to run out
of both corners of my mouth. A swarthy looking
Gaucho, and his still swarthier wife, with three
naked children, were seated on the bare clay floor
watching the fire. The man beckoned us to the
fire, and the woman brought us a log to sit upon,
while the children crowded around their father's
knees, and stared at us with their fingers in their
mouths.</p>

<p>Jerry observed that these little Gauchos conducted
themselves for all the world like the children
in the States, for they, he said, always put
their fore fingers in their mouths when they saw
a stranger.</p>

<p>By the time our clothes were dry, the mutton
was roasted, and the Gaucho's wife having spread
it on a board, and taken the pot off the pole, gave
each of us a small biscuit, and something like a
squash shell; the man motioned to us to eat, and
we fell to, first upon the roast and then upon the
boiled, and then upon the roast and then upon
the boiled again.</p>

<p>It was a delicious meal. Such mutton! and
such soup! The Gaucho and the Gaucho's wife
looked at us with amazement, as we devoured the
fat and juicy meat, and swallowed the scalding
hot pot liquor. Many and hearty were the encomiums
which Jerry and I pronounced upon our
entertainers as we devoured their mutton. Jerry
swore that the Gaucho was the gentlemanliest
man he had ever seen in his life, and I told his
wife, although she could not understand a word
of what I was saying, that she was the handsomest
woman in the world but one, and that was
Georgiana De Lancey.</p>

<p>At length, our appetites began to fail us, and
Jerry, in the fullness of his gratitude, pulled out
the Captain's watch, and offered it to our host, at
the same time turning out his pockets to show
that we had nothing else to offer in payment for
our breakfast. The Gaucho's eyes sparkled at
sight of the watch, but he struck his hand upon
his breast, and shook his head indignantly, and
told us in very excellent pantomime that his feelings
were hurt by the offer. I rebuked Jerry
for insulting the honest man's feelings by offering
him such a trifle.</i>

<p>"What, then, shall we give him," said Jerry;
"you know we haven't got a <i>midi</i> to bless our
selves."</p>

<p>"Give him," I replied, "we will give him
nothing, since we have nothing to give; but we
will stay with him, and work for him, to show our
gratitude."</p>

"So we will," said Jerry, putting the watch in
his fob again; "we will stay with him the rest of
our lives. But I feel confounded sleepy; let us
take a nap on that pile of sheep skins in the corner,
and when we wake we will pitch into the
mutton again. So we lay down upon the sheep
skins to sleep, and when we awoke, the sun was
in the western sky. I felt greatly refreshed, although
somewhat stiff and feverish. Perceiving
that the Gaucho's wife was making preparations
for the afternoon meal, we got up and stretched
ourselves, and when the mutton was ready, the
Gaucho invited us as before, and we began to
eat, but with appetites not half as keen as they
were in the morning; indeed, the mutton appeared
to have lost its exquisite flavor, and the
pot liquor was barely palateable, Jerry actually
found fault because we had but one little biscuit
given us. He said he didn't half like the
Gaucho's looks, and I was obliged to confess that
I thought he had a cut throat cast of the eye. After
dinner was over, we sat picking our teeth in
the door way; I told Jerry I felt more like travelling
than sleeping, and by way of sounding his
feelings, observed, that Buenos Ayres could not
be a very long way off.</p>

<p>Jerry replied that he did not think it was, and
if I would say the word, he was all ready to pull
up stakes and steer for Irish Jemmy's.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear him say so, and we agreed
to set off immediately. I beckoned to the Gaucho,
who was reclining on the floor, with his head
in his wife's lap, and the little Gauchos playing
about him, and tried to make him understand
that we were going to set off for the city, and
wanted him to show us the way. He pointed in
the direction that we must take, and we shook
hands with him and his wife, and then took our
departure on foot. The horses that we rode the
night before having been left to themselves, had
taken themselves off.</p>

<p>The storm had passed over, and the pampas
looked green and pleasant, the sky was soft and
blue, and the sun, though fast sinking in the
west, still imparted a warmth to the air; as a good
man, even in his dying moments, will warm the
soul by his converse.</p>

<p>We trudged on in fine spirits, exhilarated by
the influences of the weather, and the happy contrast
which our condition bore to what it was the
night before. Jerry pulled out his pistol, and on
examination, found it to be in good order. We
resolved to fight if either Indians, or Gauchos, or
Montaneros, should attack us again, and to die
rather than incur the risk of spending another
night like the last. We had advanced about two
miles, when we made these valiant resolves; there
was not a soul in sight, and our courage was
high. The sun had just disappeared behind the
horizon, when we heard the sound of horses feet
behind us. I looked round, and perceived a
horseman approaching us on full gallop, his poncho
streaming out behind in the wind. We stopped,
and Jerry pulled out his pistol and cocked
it. As the horse neared us very fast, we soon
discovered the rider to be no other than the Gaucho,
whose hut we had just left. He was coming
at a full gallop, and I perceived him to raise
himself upon his stirrups and swing his lasso
round his head, and the next moment I felt the
noose drop over my shoulders, and before I could
disengage myself from it, I was jerked to the
ground, and dragged along with great rapidity.
I heard the clank of the Gaucho's cutlass, as he
drew it from its steel scabbard, and wheeled up
towards Jerry, who levelled his pistol at him and
fired. The Gaucho fell immediately from his saddle,
and his horse stood still. Jerry cut the lasso,
and disengaged me, but I was so terribly frightened
I could not stand upon my feet for some minutes;
my head swam round, and I felt deadly
sick; the sight of the bleeding Gaucho was by no
means calculated to restore me. However, I
soon recovered from my fright, and began to assist
Jerry in stopping the blood which gushed out,
thick and black, from the wound in the Gaucho's
breast. Unfortunately, neither Jerry nor myself
had on a linen shirt, but I tore the lining out of
my jacket, and with it tried to stop the wound,
but it was in vain. The poor wretch never
spoke after he fell; his eyes were rolled up in his
head, and his teeth ground together. He was
evidently dead, but I was unwilling to leave him.
I was horror struck at the thought of our kind
entertainer having been murdered by one of us
who had so lately been sheltered beneath his
roof.</p>

<p>"Come," said Jerry, "we must not stop to
set up an Irish howl over the blackguard now;
he's as dead as Julius C&aelig;sar, and it is not his
fault that we are not taking our measure on the
green sward, with the heart's blood running out
of a hole in our breasts, instead of himself. I
am sorry he's dead though, any how, for we eat
his mutton, and this is a poor way of discharging
a debt."</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "since we can't restore him
to life, let us, at least, restore his body to his poor
wife."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Jerry, "let us mount his horse
and be off towards Buenos Ayres, or they will
make mince meat of us if we are caught here."

<p>So both of us mounted the Gaucho's horse, and
rode as fast as he would carry us towards Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>I remember having heard that the Gauchos,
though they would never deny a stranger a shelter
beneath their roof, nor molest him while a guest,
yet they would rob him if they could after he had
left their door. This may not be true, but I have
no doubt of the intention of the Gaucho to murder
us, for the sake of the watch, which his sense of
honor would not allow him to accept as a present,
while we were his guests.</p>

<p>Jerry and I indulged in a good many grave
speculations on this singular trait of character,
which helped to pass away the time, and to divert
our thoughts from the unpleasant situation in
which we were placed. We both came to the conclusion,
that, strange and incredible as it might
appear for a man to treat us with every kindness,
while we were under his roof, and then attempt to
rob us as soon as we had left it, it was not a whit
more wonderful than that, at home, a man could
be a knave, a cheat, and a turncoat in politics,
and at the same time be a gentleman and a christian
in private life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p>Return to Buenos Ayres and Departure for Rio.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN the sun rose the next morning, the towers
and domes of the city were in sight; glad enough
we were to see them once more. For fear of exciting
suspicion, we dismounted from our horse
and proceeded into town on foot. We went directly
to Irish Jemmy's, where we learned that the
Two Marys had parted her cables, during the
pampara which we had encountered in the pampas,
and that in consequence of all the cargo being out,
she had capsized and sunk; the water being shallow,
the crew had saved themselves by clinging to
the tops of the masts which were still out of water.</p>

<p>We were now no longer in fear of Captain Gunnell,
and I prevailed upon Jerry to return him the
watch. After having satisfied myself with rambling
about the city, and having discovered that
the precious metals were no longer the principal
articles of traffic, and that nothing more precious
than hides and horns had taken their place, I determined
to seek my fortune elsewhere, and accordingly
I shipped on board the brig Juno, bound
to Rio de Janeiro. Jerry had shipped, unbeknown
to me, to go to the coast of Africa, in a slaver
which lay at Encinada. We parted very reluctantly,
for we were endeared to each other, and I
could not help shedding tears when I shook his
hand and bade him good bye.</p>

<p>Just ten days after leaving the mouth of the river,
we entered the magnificent harbor of Rio. I felt
myself amply repaid for all the hardships I had
encountered since leaving home, by the sight of
this beautiful bay, with its mountains clothed with
eternal green, and its waters and sky of unchanging
blue.</p>

<p>Our brig lay at anchor, and after the cargo was
discharged, I went ashore one afternoon, to look
at the city, and while I stood in the palace square,
watching the young Emperor, who was playing in
one of the balconies of the palace, I felt myself
suddenly seized by the arms, and looking up, found
that I was in the hands of a Brazilian naval officer,
who was accompanied by two men with cutlasses
in their hands. The captain of the brig had cautioned
me before I went ashore, to keep an eye to
windward for a press gang who were picking up
all the sailors they could pounce upon for a frigate
in the harbor.</p>

<p>As the officer who had seized me by the arms,
turned to speak to one of the men, I gave a
sudden spring and cleared myself from his grasp. I
immediately took to my heels and ran for life, the
two men with the cutlasses following in pursuit.
Fortunately, I was not encumbered with any superfluous
clothing; a pair of duck trowsers, a calico
shirt, and a light straw hat, was all the weight I
carried. By a dexterous leap over a heap of bananas,
I gained a slight advantage over my pursuers;
away I went, making my heels fly, but with
out knowing where I should land. In turning the
corner of a street, I overturned an old bald-headed
priest, who stood under an awning, with a silver
plate in his hand, begging patacs of the passers by;
I meant no disrespect to his black gown, but I was
in too great a hurry to stop to make an apology,
so I kept on my way and reached the wharf just as
a boat was shoving off with an American ensign
flying at her stern. I gave a leap and landed just
inside of her gunwale, without doing any other damage
than knocking the skin off of my shins, and
breaking in the corner of the bowman's tarpaulin.</p>

<p>"How dare you leap on board this boat," exclaimed
a cadaverous looking man, with an epaulet
on his shoulder, who sat with his arms folded in
the stern sheets.</p>

<p>As soon as I recovered my breath, I explained
the cause of my hasty visit.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said he, "I will teach you
better manners. Back water."</p>

<p>The boat was backed up along side of the stairs
at the end of the wharf.</p>

<p>"Go ashore, sir," said the man with the epaulet.</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," I replied, "you will not turn me
ashore to the mercy of the press gang, from which
I have just escaped."</p>

<p>"How dare you hesitate, you scoundrel!" said
the epauletted gentleman, with severity.</p>

<p>"Because I am an American," I replied,
"and I thought I had a right to claim your protection."</p>

<p>"How do I know you are an American?"
he replied snappishly. "Where is your protection?"</p>

<p>"I have got none," I answered; "the ship to
which I belonged capsized in a pampara, and I
lost the one I had."</p>

<p>"That is no fault of mine," replied the officer;
"go to the consul and get a certificate from him
that you are an American, and then I may allow
you to go on board."</p>

<p>There was another officer in the boat, a light
haired young gentleman, with an anchor worked
on the collar of his jacket, who interfered in my
behalf, and observed, that there would be no
harm in allowing me to go on board the ship, and
then I could return in the market boat in the morning,
and, if necessary, the coxswain could take
me under his protection to the consul's office.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the elder officer, "shove
off."</p>

<p>I took a seat in the bows of the boat, and in a
very few minutes we were along side of the ship.
Two little boys, looking like miniature sailors,
with blue shirt collars, and white duck trowsers,
buttoned very tightly round the hips, reached out
the man ropes to the officers for them to ascend
by, and when they had left the boat, I asked
the bowman the name of the ship, and of the
officers.</p>

<p>"The name of the ship," replied the bowman,
"is the sloop of war Columbia, and the name of
the brute who wouldn't allow you to stay on
board the boat is Mr. Wollop; but all hands call
him dismal Jerry, except Mike, the mast man,
and he calls him Sergeant Longshanks; he is first
leftenant of the ship, but he is much fittinger to
be captain of a millinery store than one of Uncle
Sam's ships. The other officer ain't no officer at
all; he is nothing but a drunken swab of a young
gentleman by the name of Mr. Ruffalley."</p>

<p>The boat being made fast to the swinging
boom, I climbed on board the ship, and never having
been on the deck of an armed vessel before, I
was amazed at the sight of such a number of men
lounging about without apparently having anything
to do. Some were reading, others were
sewing, and some were playing drafts with the
marines between the guns. Nobody seemed to
be doing any other duty than amusing themselves,
excepting a sailor dressed in a snowy white shirt
and trowsers, who was walking the poop-deck
with a spy glass under his arm.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the apparent contentment
and ease of the sailors, such a set of grumblers
I never encountered before; they all agreed that
a certain unmentionable place would be a pleasant
abode compared with their ship. For my part, I
thought that nothing could be more delightful
than to lounge about a ship's deck, with an awning
spread over your head, an abundance of
oranges and bananas to eat, and the loveliest and
most picturesque scenery in the world to gaze up
on. I found that the Columbia had been almost
three years on the station, and that she would
soon be relieved, and I resolved not to go ashore
again unless I was sent.</p>

<p>At sun down, the band was stationed on the
poop, and played some martial airs, which were
answered, seemingly by echo, from the French and
English frigates which lay moored at some distance
from us. The last tune played was, "Hail
Columbia," and as the final note died away, a
couple of violins struck up a sadly merry Scotch
reel, in the starboard gangway, and all the
younger and thoughtless part of the crew capered
away with great industry till the perspiration
ran from their faces in streams.</p>

<p>This was all very pleasant, and fixed me in the
determination to stay on board if I could. The
Captain, a man of kind and gentlemanly looks,
was walking the deck with his thumbs thrust in
the arm holes of his waistcoat, apparently utterly
regardless of every thing around him. I thought
he might be thinking of his wife and little ones at
home, and that it would be a favorable opportunity
to speak to him; so I stationed myself by
the fife rail of the main mast, and, as he approached
me, I touched my hat to him. He stopped
and asked me what I wanted.</p>

<p>I told him the reason of my being on board his
ship, and asked him to allow me to enter as an
ordinary seaman.</p>

<p>He replied that he would speak to the first
lieutenant about me in the morning, and then
resumed his walk.</p>

<p>It was a bright and pleasant evening, the sea
breeze had just begun to ripple the still surface
of the bay, and the Magellan clouds, and other
celestial beauties, which are hid from the gaze of
northern eyes, were beginning to show their
bright faces. I felt melancholy, notwithstanding
the mirth and laughter and boisterous gayety of
those around me. Thoughts of home, of the
beautiful Georgiana De Lancey, and of the harsh
prophecy of my cousin, came over me and oppressed
me; I yearned for a sympathetic bosom,
with one throb which beat in unison with my
own; there were none among the living souls
around me. I crept away unperceived, and lay
down on the top gallant forecastle, and stretched
out my arms to the huge fantastic hills which
reared their giant heads against the night sky.

<div id="center">

</div>

<p>The next morning one of the boatswain's mates
told me to go down to the doctor. I accordingly
went and found him on the birth deck with the
lob-lolly boy. The doctor was a little man, with
red hair and a very long nose; he was dressed
in a thread-bare blue suit with tarnished buttons,
and a black bombazine stock; pretty sure signs
that he had a growing family at home, which absorbed
about seven eighths of his pay and rations;
but that was no business of mine. He felt of my
arms and legs, pounded on my chest, and did
some other things, the propriety of which I could
not exactly understand, and having pronounced
me sound in limbs and body, I was enrolled on
the ship's papers as an ordinary seaman.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p>Is devoted to a slight sketch of Lieutenant Wallop, and being
not at all essential to a proper development of my adventures,
may be read or not, as the reader pleases.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. WALLOP was by courtesy gallant, as all
officers of the navy and army are; he had seen
service on board of a revenue cutter, which
might have been seen during the time of his command,
at least eleven months and some odd days
out of the year, lying quietly at anchor in the
neighborhood of that famous strait known to the
dwellers about Gowannus Bay by the name of
Buttermilk Channel. It was not a service in
which much renown was to be gained, but in
which a good deal of comfort could be taken, and
that with some is quite as desirable as fame.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallop was tall and thin; his face was
pale, and his eyes were fishy in their aspect. He
was troubled with a cough which should have
admonished him that his body was made of perishable
materials, the thought of which, one would
suppose, should have softened his temper and
humanized his feelings: but the effect of it was
the reverse; he seemed to feel a spite towards
every one who enjoyed better health than himself,
and yet he never showed the slightest compassionate
feeling for those who were sick and feeble,
but on the contrary, he did all in his power to
make them miserable. Some people, I doubt not,
considered Mr. Wallop the very nicest person in
the whole world; for there are those who estimate
a man's virtues by the complexion of his garments,
and Mr. Wallop's vest was as spotless as snow,
and his buttons were innocent of rust. He was
cleanly to a degree passing credulity. If others
reckoned cleanliness among the half virtues, he
considered slovenliness as a whole vice, and he
punished all dirty offenders accordingly. If a man
by accident spit upon deck, he flogged him; and if
in his walks about the ship's decks, he discovered
a hat or a jacket, or any other article, no matter
how valuable, out of its proper place, he would
throw it overboard, without asking to whom it
belonged, or moving a muscle in his face. Once,
he threw a jacket overboard, which belonged to
an old sailor who had lost an eye in one of the
engagements of the Constitution, in the last war,
which so enraged the old veteran, that he caught
up his bag, which contained all his earthly store,
and in a paroxysm of rage, threw it out of a port
hole, to keep his jacket company. Mr. Wallop
smiled, but said nothing; and when the old man
appeared at quarters without his jacket, the gallant
lieutenant stopped his grog for a fortnight.</p>

<p>But Mr. Wallop was pious; he read prayers
every Sunday morning on the drum head of the
capstern, for there was no Chaplain on board, and
in the afternoon, he read a chapter or two from
the Bible. His readings, however, were never of
gentleness and mercy, but always of wrath and
indignation. He would smack his lips over the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, with as
much apparent satisfaction as though he had been
personally aggrieved by the abominations of those
wicked cities; and a smile of delight would steal
over his cadaverous features, while he read of the
terrible feat of Samuel, in hewing down the captive
Agag, in Gilgal. It is but justice, however,
to say, that Mr. Wallop never allowed himself to
get into a passion; he always had the most perfect
mastery of his passions, and he would give
the harshest commands in the meekest and most
lamb-like voice.</p>

<p>One morning, while we lay at anchor in Rio,
he came out of his state-room, just as the hammocks
were piped up, in his dressing gown and
slippers, and ordered the gratings to be rigged,
and told the boatswain to send Jack Hanson to
him. It was in the gray of the morning, and the
night mists still hung about the ship. Jack Hanson
came aft to the lieutenant; he was a weather
beaten old sailor, who had been petted by all the
officers in the ship, except Mr. Wallop, who never
petted any body but himself. Jack was in some
sort a privileged character, and he had been allowed
to do, and to say, any thing he pleased; but he
had, unfortunately, the night before, drank a glass
of whiskey, which one of the boys had contrived
to smuggle out of the ward room, to pay for a
hammock lashing, which Jack had grafted for
him; and his old head being weak, and his blood
thin, the fumes of the liquor had warmed his feelings,
and he had had the audacity to sing "The
Guerriere so bold," in a louder tone than exactly
harmonized with Mr. Wallop's ear.</p>

<p>Hanson had not the slightest suspicion that the
preparation for flogging were intended for him;
and when Mr. Wallop told him to take off his
shirt, the old man turned pale with fright.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going to flog me, sir,"
said Hanson, his lips trembling as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am," replied Mr. Wallop, calmly.</p>

<p>"For what, sir?" said Hanson.</p>

<p>"For being drunk," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"When, sir?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you," said Hanson, "I was
no more drunk than the sheet anchor is at this
moment. I was only a little swipey."</p>

<p>"Silence," said Mr. Wallop. "I say you
<i>were</i> drunk. Tie him up, quarter master."</p>

<p>"I am an old man, sir," said Hanson, looking
imploringly up into the lieutenant's face.</p>

<p>"I know you are," replied Mr. Wallop, in his
mild and gentle voice, "and I would flog you, if
you were my grandfather."</p>

<p>Hanson was too much of a sailor to handy
words with his officer, so he took off his shirt, and
the quarter master tied his ancles to the grating,
and his wrists to two eye-bolts in the gangway
above his head. The boatswain's mate, a stout,
active man, with an arm so muscular, as to he
unable to strike a light blow, if he had wished to,
took his station, and leisurely disentangled the
cords of his cat.</p>

<p>"Begin," said Mr. Wallop.</p>

<p>Hanson groaned as he heard the command
given, and when the first blow fell upon his bare
back, he gave a terrific shriek which went to my
very heart. I had never seen a man flogged before,
and I had no idea that one human being
could inflict such a punishment upon another. I
shuddered at the thought of unwittingly incurring
it myself, and, dreadful as it appeared, the disgrace
appeared to me greater than the suffering.</p>

<p>The master at arms, a gray headed old sailor,
counted the strokes, as they fell upon poor Han
son's back, with a tremulous voice, and when he
had counted twenty-four, Mr. Wallop motioned
the boatswain's mate to stop, and wrapping his
gown about his lank person, he retired to his
state-room, probably to engage in his morning's
devotions.</p>

<p>Hanson was cut down, and he went below to
his berth; his back was purple with gore. He
wanted for neither torts of grog, nor sympathising
friends, but the old tar's spirit was broken, and
he never again could be prevailed upon to sing
his favorite song of</p>

<p>"The Guerriere so bold,</br>

On the foaming ocean rolled."</p>

<p>It was not my intention when I commenced
writing my adventures, to make an omnibus of
them; but I find that when a man makes up his
mind to go down to posterity, he must of necessity
drag others along with him, whether their company
be agreeable or not. Mr. Wallop is one of those
that I am thus compelled to take with me, but to
render his company as little obnoxious as possible,
I have, as it were, given him an outside seat, all
alone by himself.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p>Continues and ends on Shipboard. A narrow Escape from a
flogging, and from Death.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next day after I came on board, I was put
into a mess, and when dinner was piped, for they
do nothing on board a man of war without first
being piped, I took my seat with my messmates,
around a huge plumb pudding, and a kid of boiled
beef.</p>

<p>I don't know how it happens, but it is always so
arranged on board a man of war, that there is a
bully, a buffoon, and a butt, in each mess. I am
not certain that such is not the case every where;
even in bodies of collected wisdom, I have heard
of things very much like bullying, and buffoonery,
and perhaps there always will be butts in all societies,
as long as there are inequalities of intellects.</p>

<p>Now, in the mess which I had joined, it chanced
that the butt had lately set up for a buffoon, and
they immediately pitched upon me to fill the vacancy
which he had left.</p>

<p>"I say, chummy," said Tom Sweeny, the captain
of the after guard, "ain't your name Newcome?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"But it's Johnny Comelately, ain't it, you?" said
a young mizen topman.</p>

<p>"No," I replied again, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Well, it's Johnny Raw, I know," said a foretopman,
who was the bully.</p>

<p>I gave the bully an indignant look, but made
him no reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what it is, sloop mate," said
Mr. Sweeny, winking to his messmates, "it's my
'pinion the doctor won't pass you no how."</p>

<p>"Why won't he?" I said.</p>

<p>"Because you have got strong symptoms of the
fantods; your skin is so tight you can't shut your
eyes without opening your mouth."</p>

<p>At this bright sally, all the mess laughed very
heartily, the captain of the after guard, as a matter
of course, laughing louder than any.</p>

<p>The late butt, who had been absent, now joined
the mess, and perceiving the laudable work in
which his messmates were engaged, took his part,
by saying that the boatswain had sent him to tell
me to go down to the purser's steward, and get a
piece of cheese to make a fid for the foretopgallant
mast.</p>

<p>"And when you come along," added an ugly
old brute, who acted as cook of the mess, "please
to give my complements to the capting, and tell
him as Mister Swazey would be werry much obliged
to him for the loan of one of his eperlets, as I
wants to go ashore this arternoon, to see my sweet
heart, the Countess of Santos."</p>

<p>"What did you come to sea for any how?"
asked the foretopman.</p>

<p>"I know," replied Mr. Sweeny, "it was to wear
out his old clothes."</p>

<p>"No it warn't," said the cook, "he is a gentleman's
son, and he corned to sea cos as they wanted
him to marry a gal which he didn't like, so he
run'd away."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I didn't come to sea for,"
I said, jumping up, "I didn't come to be made fun
of by a dirty rascal like you."</p>

<p>"O, ah! didn't you mister?" replied the cook.</p>

<p>"No," I said, throwing down my knife, "and
neither you nor any other man shall make fun of
me." So saying, I leaped on to the messcloth,
and gave him a blow in the eye, which sent him
reeling against the bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Hallo, there," cried the officer of the deck,
"what's all that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," answered the captain of the after
guard, "only this here Mister Comelately wants
to take charge of the ship."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied the officer, "let me
hear no more of this, or I will make every mother's
son of you drink six water grog for a fortnight."</p>

<p>Whether it was owing to the threat of the officer,
or to the attack I made upon the cook, I cannot
say, but neither the bully, nor the buffoon,
nor the captain of the after guard, ever again
attempted to crack any jokes at my expense.</p>

<p>About a month after this, part of the starboard
watch, to which I belonged, was sent on to Hospital
Island in charge of a midshipman and the
boatswain, to overhaul some rigging, preparatory
to our departure for home. Hospital Island is
one of the pretty little spots of living green
which dot the upper part of the harbor of Rio;
there is on it a pile of grotesque old buildings,
which were once occupied as a convent, but
they are now, or were, rented by the United
States, for a store house for the government ships
on the Brazilian stations.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruffally was the officer whom the first
lieutenant sent in charge of the gang, with the
launch, and he had strict orders, neither to allow
a boat to approach the island, nor one to leave
it, lest grog, in some shape, should be smuggled
on board the ship; for Mr. Wallop believed that
the Evil One entered mankind through their gullets,
in the shape of strong drink, and he was determined
that no evil spirits, nor any other spirits,
should enter his ship's company, at least in
that manner. But Mr. Ruffally liked a horn himself,
and what was more, he had no objection in
the world to others taking a horn, and he was the
very last man in the steerage that Mr. Wallop
should have sent in charge of the starboard
watch to keep them sober. But the first lieutenant
had never known Mr. Ruffally to go ashore
with the other midshipmen, and he thought him
one of the discreetest young gentlemen in the
ship.</p>

<p>The reason why Mr. Ruffally did not go ashore
was this: he was once, before Mr. Wallop joined
the ship, appointed caterer of his mess, and the
very first time he went ashore to purchase provisions,
he gambled away all the mess money,
pawned his side arms, lost his gold laced cap, and
came off to the ship with an old straw hat on his
head, and his face most wofully scratched. The
consequences were, the mess had to eat pork and
beans for the next three months, and he was not
allowed to go ashore until he had furnished him
self with side arms, and so forth, and the
state of his finances had not yet enabled him to
do so.</p>

<p>We had not been on the island long, when a
little skiff was seen approaching the shore from
Pragy Grand. Mr. Ruffally discovered the corpulent
form of Portuguese Joe seated in the
stern, and guessing the errand on which the crafty
smuggler was bound, he contrived to busy himself
in the chapel of the convent in overhauling
some old rubbish.</p>

<p>The little skiff touched the beach, and landed,
in the twinkling of an eye, some dozens of bladders
well filled with Aquadente, and Portuguese
Joe being well paid for his trouble, shoved off,
and continued on his way towards the opposite
side of the harbor. Mr. Ruffally made his appearance,
and exchanged a knowing wink with
the boatswain, and very soon contrived to have a
whole bladder of Aquadente to himself, to which
he paid his respects so freely, that he soon was under
the necessity of laying down on the grass, observing,
as he stretched himself out, that the climate
was so enervating he should be under the
necessity of leaving the ship if she was not ordered
home immediately. It was not long before
he was snoring, as Bill Littlepenny said, like seven
bells half struck.</p>

<p>All work now ceased, or rather we all went to
work in good earnest, under the directions of the
boatswain, winding spun yarn round the bladders
of liquor, so that they could be smuggled on
board the ship, where they would be under the
charge of that worthy gentleman, who would
then be enabled to indulge in deep potations of
the most abominable distillation that ever scalded
the throat, or eat up the liver of a man, whenever
he had an inclination. We had hardly got
through with the job of enclosing the bladders of
liquor in a covering of spun yarn, when the signal
was set for the launch to return to the ship.
Mr. Ruffally was too far gone either to move or
speak, so we lifted him into the boat, and laid
him in the stern sheets, and shoved off for the
ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Bunker, the boatswain, was very happy;
his eyes sparkled, and his tongue, though apparently
too big for his mouth, was not idle a moment;
he cursed, and laughed, and cried by
turns, and in quick succession; he told stories
about killing whales, and talked about the Essex
Junior and Commodore Porter; and he bet his
silver call, chain and all, against a head of tobacco,
with Bill Littlepenny, a foretopman, that
he could out jump him, out lift him, out drink
him, and out sing him. Such familiarities from
the boatswain, gave the boat's crew immense satisfaction,
and we came along side the ship in
high glee. Myself and a marine were the only
sober men in the launch; but the others, drunk
though they were, had sense enough left not to
make any noisy demonstrations of their happy
condition, as we came within hail of the ship.</p>

<p>The captain was walking the poop, and seeing
Mr. Ruffally lying in the stern sheets of the
boat, he called out to the boatswain, to know what
ailed him.</p>

<p>"I cant say, sir, exactly," said Mr. Bunker,
very prudently keeping his seat, "but I believe he
is in a fit."</p>

<p>"A fit!" exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the boatswain, "appleplexy,
or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"How long since he was taken?" asked the
doctor, who now appeared at the gangway.</p>

<p>"About two hours since, sir," replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>"In the name of heaven!" exclaimed the captain,
"why did you not bring him on board before,
or send to the ship for assistance."</p>

<p>"I had no orders, sir," replied the boatswain,
gravely, but at the same time giving a comical
twist of his mouth, which set the whole boat's
crew in a broad grin.</p>

<p>"What stupidity!" exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>"Bear a hand there, Mr. Gravel," he said, addressing
the officer of the deck, "and get a whip
on the main yard, and hoist Mr. Ruffally on board,
in a chair."

<p>The doctor ran below for his phlebotomising
instruments, to be in readiness to bleed the unfortunate
midshipman to death, in case he should not
be dead already; and the whole ship was in commotion.
The whip was overhauled, and Mr. Ruffally
put into a large arm chair, out of the captain's
own cabin, and carefully hoisted on board,
in an incredibly short space of time. His case
was immediately reported to the first lieutenant,
who reported it to the captain, who ordered the
drunken young gentleman to be put under arrest.
Mr. Bunker was sent below to his state-room,
with a marine, with a rusty cutlass in his hand,
to stand guard over him. Mr. Wallop looked
paler than ever, and he was seized with a fit of
coughing, which he had no sooner recovered from,
than he ordered all the gang who were on the
island, to come aft and toe a seam in the deck.
But this was a performance which none of them
were equal to, except the sober marine and myself;
so they were all put in irons, and soon became
very noisy.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallop asked me how the men got their
liquor, and whether they had smuggled any on
board. But I remembered the kindness which
Mr. Ruffally had shown me, when I leaped into
the boat, and I was resolved not to betray him, let
the consequences be what they might. So I replied
to Mr. Wallop, that I knew nothing at all
about the matter; as I was not placed in charge
of the men, I had not troubled myself to watch their
actions.</p>

<p>"You lie, sir," said the lieutenant, with a little
more passion than he usually showed, "you do
know all about the matter, and I will flog it out of
you, if you do not tell me."</p>

<p>This threat was placing me in an antagonist
position, and instead of terrifying me, it only in
spired me with fresh courage to hold out in my
determination. As I had conceived a most thorough
contempt for Mr. Wallop, I could not resist
the inclination to tell him, if he attempted to flog
any thing out of me, he would find it would flog
it into me.</p>

<p>"Order the gratings to be got up instantly,
sir," said the captain, who overheard me; "and
if he does not tell you, sir, give him two dozen."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed with great alacrity. The
gratings were placed in the gangway, and the
boatswain's mate summoned.</p>

<p>"Now, you scoundrel," said Mr. Wallop, "answer
my question instantly, or I will flog the life
out of you."</p>

<p>The sight of the preparations for flogging were,
indeed, terrifying, and a glance at the sturdy boatswain's mate,
with his arm bared, and the cat with
its thongs still red with Jack Hanson's blood, in
his hand, made me quail; but I was resolved to
die, sooner than I would yield to the tyrannical
command of the lieutenant. I made no reply to his
threat, except by a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Strip off your shirt, you wretch," he said, trying
to suppress a cough, "and, boatswain's mate,
pipe all hands to witness punishment."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed. The men came crowding
aft to the gangway; the marines were turned
out under arms; the old gray-headed master at
arms took his station; the boatswain's mate stood
ready, and the quarter masters, with their nettles
in their hands, were prepared to seize me up. I
took off my shirt, and stepped with my bare feet
upon the gratings; they put the cords about my
ankles, and around my wrists; they were in the act
of making them fast, when I made a sudden spring
on to a gun, and then on top of the hammock nettings,
and from thence into the main rigging. It
was a sudden impulse, for the possibility of escape
had never occurred to me, and, indeed, if the act
had been premeditated, I could not have accomplished
it. Luckily, there was no one aloft, and I
reached the top before the first lieutenant recovered
from the astonishment into which my sudden
leap threw him.</p>

<p>"Come down, sir," called out the captain, who
stood with his sword in his hand on the poop.</p>

<p>But I made no reply to his command, and
sprung into the topmast rigging.</p>

<p>"Jump aloft there, captain of the main top,"
said Mr. Wallop, "and bring the rascal down, or
throw him out of the top."</p>

<p>But the captain of the top did not jump quite as
fast as I did, and before he showed his head
through the lubber's hole, I had reached the topmast
cross-trees, where I stood with my arms folded,
and gazed about quite at my leisure. Two other
men were sent up to catch me, and as they moved
rather faster than the captain of the top, I climbed
up the topgallant rigging, and then up the royalmast
shrouds, and clinging around the foot of the
skysail mast, with my feet resting upon the stay
for support, for a moment I almost forgot my perilous
situation. The higher I mounted, the lighter
my spirits grew, and the less fear I felt. So grand
and glorious a view as met my eye, while I gazed
around, might have beguiled a man's thoughts
even upon the gallows. But I was not allowed to
enjoy the prospect long. The captain of the top
reached the topgallant mast head, and told me if I
did not come down, he would certainly haul me
down; but I told him if he came within the reach
of my feet, I would give him a kick, which should
send him headlong to the deck, as sure as his name
was Dick Smith. But the captain was bellowing
through his speaking trumpet, commanding him
to shake me off the mast, and Dick knew no better
than to obey the command of his superior,
even at the risk of his own life, and he began to
climb up towards me. My first impulse was to
carry my threat into execution, which I could have
easily done; but a better thought suggested itself
to me, and I slipped down on the opposite side of
the royal shrouds, and laying hold of the topgallant
lift, slid down and perched myself on the end
of the yard, where, with my arms crossed, I looked
down upon deck, with a feeling of exultation. My
pursuer was about to follow me, when I drew my
knife, and assured him, with an earnestness which
frightened him, that if he made the attempt I would
cut the lift, and both of us should go overboard together.</p>

<p>The captain threatened to shoot me, if I did not
come down, but I preferred being shot to being
flogged, so I shook my head, and folded my arms
again, and turned my face towards the sun, which
was just going down behind the long range of
grotesque and lofty mountains, which bound the
western horizon, giving their peaks of deepest blue
a tinge of gold and crimson. The Sugar Loaf,
and Gloria Hill, and Cocovado, began to look
black and sombre, as the sun withdrew his rays.
The time for sending down the topgallant yards,
on one of which I was perched, had arrived; the
sun had set, but the colors were not hauled down,
and the sunset gun had not been fired.</p>

<p>I could see all the movements that were going
on upon deck, the captain and first lieutenant
were pacing the poop deck in a rage, while the
other officers were collected together in little
knots, and all the men were gazing up at me,
apparently with intense solicitude. Presently I
saw Mr. Wallop speaking to the marine who had
returned from the island with me in the launch;
and from what followed I supposed that he too
had refused to tell how the liquor was procured;
for he was seized up at the gangway, and directly
his piercing cries rang through the air, as the
boatswain's mate laid the cat upon his bare back.
I writhed and shuddered every time the boatswain's
mate raised his arm. They gave the
poor marine thirty-six lashes, and then they cut
him down; he behaved manfully, and refused to
divulge a word.</p>

<p>The captain seized his speaking trumpet again,
and called out to me to come down, swearing a
horrible oath, that he would shoot me if I did not.
I only shook my head, and clung more closely to
the lift. He called for the sergeant of marines,
who, I remembered having heard, was an expert
marksman with the rifle. The sergeant went upon
the poop with his rifle in his hand, and the captain,
ordered him to take aim at me, and fire; but he
hesitated, upon which the captain drew his sword,
and commanded him again to fire at me, swearing
that he would run him through if he missed me.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I felt any fear; death was a
thousand times preferable to the disgrace of a flogging,
besides, I felt myself innocent of any offence.
And there, too, were the upturned faces of the
whole crew, gazing at me with their hearts in their
eyes, and I knew that I had the sympathy of
every man on board, with the exception of the
captain and Mr. Wallop, and even they, I knew,
could not condemn me in their hearts.</p>

<p>I saw the sergeant bring his rifle to an aim, I
averted my head; there was a death-like stillness
on deck; the next moment I heard the click
of the trigger, and quicker than the ball which
sped from the rifle came the thoughts of my
mother and sister, the gentle Georgiana, and the
prophecy of my haughty cousin; now was its fulfilment,
and all my exertions had come to nought.
O that these thoughts had come but a moment before;
with them in my mind, the gangway would
have been divested of its terrors, the anguish of a
life was crowded into the smallest conceivable
space of time. I made an effort to raise my arm,
but it was too late; the ball whizzed through the
air, and struck the lift just beyond the reach of
my arm. It did not cut it in two, only two strands
of the rope were severed. There was a hope!
How my eyes gazed upon that slender thread
upon which my earthly existence was hanging,
and with what a shock the blood rushed back into
my head as I saw it snap asunder.</p>

<p>In my fall from that fearful height I glanced
against the main yard, which gave a slight turn
to my body, just sufficient to carry me clear of the
main chains into the water. The rush of the air
as I fell, the many-voiced shriek of the crew, and
the roar of the water as I sank beneath its surface,
all sound in my ears even now while I write;
and often since have I started from a deep sleep,
with the same confusion of noises ringing in my
brain.</p>

<p>I had scarcely touched the water before a dozen
men had leaped overboard to rescue me, and,
strange as it may seem, the captain was among
the number; they caught me as I rose to the surface,
and lifted me into one of the cutters, from
which I was hoisted on board by the same whip
which was got up for Mr. Ruffally, the cause of
all the tumult. I was scarcely for a minute insensible
to all that was going on, but I did not choose
to show any signs of life till I had been well rubbed,
and had a glass of brandy poured down my
throat, when I opened my eyes, and made a motion
with my hand, just in time to save myself from
being bled by the doctor, who stood by me with
his lancet in his hand. I was then taken below,
and put into a cot, where I lay comfortable enough
for the next three weeks, receiving visits every
day from the doctor, and congratulations and
kind words from all my shipmates, particularly
from the boatswain and the men who were on the
island with me; all of whom had been set at liberty,
without being punished, and even Mr.
Ruffally, the drunken swab of a young gentle
man, was liberated from his confinement.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

<p>Leave Rio, and arrive at New York: a wide interval, but a
short chapter.</p>

</div>

<p>DURING the time that I was confined to my
cot, our ship was relieved by the arrival of the
Corvette Union; but a revolution having broken
out in Rio, the American merchants residing
there, and the English admiral on the station,
sent to our captain, requesting him to delay his
departure for a few days, until the result of the
outbreak should be known; but he had promised
his crew that he would weigh anchor for home
the day after his relief should arrive; and before
he returned an answer to these requests, he called
the crew aft, and told them he felt it his duty to remain,
but that he could not do so without they
would release him from his promise; they, however,
were too anxious to get home to do so,
and they insisted on his fulfilling it, which he
did.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallop's cough had grown so bad he considered
it prudent to remain on the station, and
when he left the ship, the crew could hardly be
restrained from giving three cheers. The third
day after the ship left Rio, I came upon deck, and
continued to perform my duty the remainder of
the time I was on board, without experiencing
any inconvenience from the effects of my fall.
The officer who succeeded Mr. Wallop as first
lieutenant, was Mr. Futtuck, a good sailor and a
strict disciplinarian; under his command the duty
of the ship was well performed; the crew were
cheerful and obedient, and the cat was dispensed
with. The brutalizing exhibition of one man
flogging another was never again repeated. Mr.
Futtuck was not one of those imbeciles, who are
forced to seek the aid of a boatswain's mate
to compel respect from their inferiors in station.</p>

<p>We were favored with bright skies and full sails
on our homeward passage, and on the forty-seventh
morning after leaving Rio, we came in sight of
the Highlands of Neversink, with their woody
sides and white beach, standing like an old
friend, to greet me on my return, with an unchanged
face.</p>

<p>The wind being favorable, we sailed directly
up to the Navy Yard, and the next day the crew
were paid off. As I was only rated an ordinary
seaman, it will readily be supposed that the
amount of my wages was but small, which was
true enough, and yet I was paid off with more
than double the amount that any of the crew had
to receive.</p>

<p>Mr. Futtuck, the first lieutenant, called the
petty officers together the morning on which we
were paid off, and told them if they did not get
up a subscription for me, as a compliment for my
generosity in refusing to inform on them, even
at the risk of my life, they were no men, and
not deserving the name of sailors; and he promised
them if they did not, he would work the
souls out of them, if he ever caught either of
them on board of a ship again.</p>

<p>They all acknowledged it to be a good and
seamanlike proposition, and showed their convictions
of its propriety, by ripping out some of the
roundest oaths that were ever uttered. A paper
was accordingly drawn up, requesting the purser
to stop out of each man's pay the sum which
should be subscribed against his name, and to pay
the same over to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruffally headed the list, by putting down
his name for fifty dollars; but it was not paid, as
he had already overdrawn his account; but he
told me not to think the less of his generosity, as
he intended, when he went back to North Carolina,
to make me a present of a rice plantation
and a hundred negroes. The boatswain, determined
not to be outdone by a reefer, put down his
name for fifty dollars, which was paid. When
the list was handed in to the purser, it amounted
to something more than a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>As I was the last man that joined the ship, I
was the last paid off; and when the purser reached
me a check, I was startled at the amount, and
told him he had made a mistake; for I knew
nothing about the subscription, it having been
kept a secret from me on purpose. When the
purser explained to me, and told me the money all
belonged to me, I could not help bursting into
tears. I told him my conscience would not allow
me to keep the money, as I had done nothing to
entitle me to it.</p>

<p>"Don't be a simpleton," said the purser, "you
must take it, for the men are now all ashore, and
most of them drunk before this time. So take the
check, and make a good use of the money. I am
only sorry it is not twice as much."</p>

<p>So I put the check into my pocket, and having
packed up my few clothes in a canvass bag, I was
about leaving the ship, when Mr. Futtuck called
me to him on the quarter deck.</p>

<p>"Now, Franco," said Mr. Futtuck, "how
much money have they given you?"</p>

<p>I showed him the check which the purser had
given me.</p>

<p>"Now that is something like," he exclaimed;
"I am glad of it; you deserve it all, and more
too. If it were not for my poor old aunt, who is
on my hands just now, God bless her! I would
add something handsome to it, I'm d&mdash;d if I
wouldn't. However, it's a pretty good sum; more
than I ever expect to be worth, unless the 'bill'
should pass both houses, and I know it won't.
But, my fine fellow, don't go among the girls
with a copper in your pocket; they are the very
devil for getting money away from sailors, as I
know to my cost. And take my advice, and don't
go to sea again; it's a dog's life. And yet it is
a pity that you should not, for I don't know exactly
what a smart youngster like you could do
ashore; perhaps you might get the cashiership of
a bank, or something of that sort. However,
keep a stiff upper lip, and if the bill for creating
admirals should pass through Congress, I will
use my influence with the Secretary to get you a
midshipman's warrant. I will, upon my soul; but
the service is going to kingdom come, as it is.
Bless my soul, it eats into my happiness, like
salt water on a gilt button, to think that a set of
broad-shouldered, strong-fisted, stout-hearted,
clear-headed, and free-thoughted, fine fellows,
should be at the mercy of a third rate lawyer or
a second rate hack novelist&mdash;fellows that don't
know a cat-head from a cat-harping."</p>

<p>Knowing it was a peculiarity of Mr. Futtuck's
to talk as long as any one would listen to him, I
thought there would be no more incivility in cutting
him short at one time than another. So I
thanked him for his kind promises and good advice,
which I promised faithfully to observe, and
bade him good bye.</p>

<p>I took my bag under my arm, jumped into the
boat along side, and pulled myself ashore.</p>

<p>All my shipmates had left the ship some time
before me, and she looked dreary enough. The
only signs of life about her were two or three
midshipmen standing on the poop, looking very
anxiously upon the green fields of the Wallabout.
Her colors were hauled down, her masts housed,
her rigging was hanging about in disorder, and
her top gallant yards, the scene of my triumph,
lay upon deck. I gave her a parting glance, and
calling to mind the gang-way and gratings, and
the cat o'nine tails, I turned my back upon her,
and quickened my pace.</p>

<p>My first object was to find a boarding house,
and to divest myself of my short jacket and nankin
collared shirt.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>Get settled in a genteel boarding house. Grow sublime.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a broiling hot day, and as I toiled along
through the dusty streets of Brooklyn towards
the ferry, I almost wished myself back again upon
the blue sea.</p>

<p>It was almost two years since I left New York
in the Two Marys, but when I stepped ashore
from the ferry boat by the Catharine Market,
every thing looked as natural and as unchanged
as though I hall been absent but a day. I looked
around in the expectation of seeing some familiar
face into which I could look for a smile of welcome.
There was an old red faced apple woman
sitting under the shade of a tattered canvass
awning, brushing away the flies from her little
pyramids of dusty fruit, with a palmetto leaf in
one hand, while with her other she wiped the perspiration
from her broad face. Close by, was a
negro opening hard shelled clams, with a red flannel
shirt on his back, and a bell crowned brown
beaver hat on his head. Not far from him was a
young girl in a black silk dress and a tattered leghorn
hat, selling ice cream; and near her was a
negro wench, sitting on a curb stone, and crying
out in the most heart-reading tone imaginable,
"Here's your nice hot corn." Three or four
cartmen, in dirty frocks, were seated on their cart
tails, each of them studying a penny paper, apparently
with the most intense curiosity. There
were also wood sawyers sitting listlessly on their
bucks, and spruce looking gentlemen, very much
dressed, with glass show cases on the side walk,
displaying quantities of jewelry, and soaps, and
penknives; and there was an old man, very poorly
dressed, with an assortment of second hand books
and tattered maps.</p>

<p>These might all have been old acquaintances of
mine, for aught that I knew to the contrary.
They looked extremely natural, and even familiar;
but as I could call neither of them by name, I
passed on, feeling lonesome and down hearted. I
longed to grasp somebody by the hand.</p>

<p>I turned down into Water street, and perceiving
a door open with the sign of the Foul Anchor
above it, I walked in, and engaged board with the
proprietor, Mr. Robert Murphy, a gentleman who
had had the misfortune to lose one of his legs. There
was nothing particularly attractive in the appearance
of Mr. Murphy's bar-room, so I gave him
my bag to take care of, and set out in search of a
tailor's shop. I found one close by, the "Emporium
of Fashion," in Cherry street, where I procured
a full suit of clothes, very similar to those
which I had purchased in Maiden Lane, nearly
two years before. As I had not got the money
for my check, the tailor's bookkeeper went with
me to the bank to get it changed, and having paid
him for my clothes, I put the balance in my pocket,
and went in search of Mrs. Riggs' boarding
house, for I was impatient to see somebody that I
knew, and I had no intention of returning again
to the Foul Anchor.</p>

<p>I found the place where I had left Mrs. Riggs'
house standing, with a brass plate on the door;
but no house stood there now: a street had been
cut through the very spot, and towering high brick
stores, with square granite pillars, had sprung up
all around it. I could hardly believe that it was
the same place; but I inquired in one of the stores,
and found that it was. I inquired about Mrs.
Riggs, and was told that she had sold her lease to
an operator, in real estate, for ten thousand dollars;
and that she kept a genteel boarding house
in Broadway. I took her number, and soon found
the house. It appeared to me to be on the most
magnificent scale. There was a large silver plate on
the door, with "Riggs" engraved on it; it is not
a very imposing name in itself; but being surrounded
with a good many flourishes, it made a very
respectable appearance. I pulled the bell handle,
and the door was opened by a black man, with
gold lace on his coat collar, much finer than our
lieutenant of marines. He showed me into the
parlor, and Mrs. Riggs soon made her appearance;
she wore more ribands, and wrinkles too,
than when I saw her last; but I knew her, the
moment she entered, and I jumped up and took
her hand, and shook it very heartily; but she drew
back, and I was surprised when I found that she did
not recognise me.</p>

<p>I explained to her who I was, and then I had the
additional mortification of learning that she had
forgotten that she ever did know me; but it was
still a pleasure to me to see her, and I engaged
the only vacant room she had. Her charges were
just treble what they were in Pearl street, and the
dinner hour was changed from two to five o'clock.</p>

<p>"Is not five o'clock a very late hour for dinner?"
I inquired.</p>

<p>"It may be for some," replied Mrs. Riggs.
"Mechanics dine earlier, but five o'clock is much
the genteelest."</p>

<p>I never knew before that one hour was more
particularly genteel than another; and as I was
anxious to conform, in all things, to the very genteelest
customs, I asked Mrs. Riggs what was considered
a genteel hour for going to bed.</p>

<p>"Some of the gentlemen," she replied, "which
goes to the Opera, don't retire to rest until after
one o'clock."</p>

<p>I apologized for my ignorance, by observing
that I had been absent from the country almost
two years, and that things appeared to have
changed very much.</p>

<p>"Been travelling?" asked Mrs. Riggs.</p>

<p>"Some," I replied.</p>

<p>"They are quite genteel in Europe, I presume?"
suggested Mrs. Riggs.</p>

<p>"I presume they are," I replied, "but I have
not been travelling in Europe. I have only been
in South America."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Riggs, "that, I believe, is
near Cape Horn."</p>

<p>"Somewhere in that neighborhood," I answered.</p>

<p>"Were you in any of the gold, or silver mines?"
inquired Mrs. Riggs; whose views of South
America were very much like my own, before I
had any experimental knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Riggs was called away before I had time
to make any reply, but I was not left a great while
to my reflections, for a young lady, almost immediately,
entered the parlor, and taking a seat at the
piano, began to thrum away, and scream with all
her might.</p>

<p>As I was not particularly charmed with the
young lady's voice, I left the parlor, and with the
hope of catching a glimpse of Georgiana De
Lancey, I walked up to St. John's Square; but
here I was doomed to another disappointment.
The house in which she had lived was pulled down,
and a larger and handsomer one was built in its
place. It was not finished, and a heap of rubbish
obstructed the side walk in front of it.</p>

<p>I returned to my boarding house, weary, disappointed,
and dejected, and went up to my chamber,
and threw myself upon the bed to revolve in my
mind some plan for my future conduct.</p>

<p>I could no longer derive consolation and pleasure
from the bright and glittering hopes which
crowded about me, before an encounter with the
stubborn realities of the world bad put them all
to flight. I had to build my expectations out of
such materials as my slender experience had furnished
me.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to go home, for I loved
my parents and my sister most dearly, and my
heart yearned after them. But I loved Georgiana
De Lancey also, although against hope and reason;
and I felt unwilling to leave New York without
first seeing her, or hearing of her; if I could
have caught but one glance of her soft blue eyes,
I should have felt happy; at least I thought so.
And then the prophetic words of my cousin, too,
rose up to deter me from returning home; how
could I meet his sneering look, while the great
object of my pursuit was not half accomplished.
It was true, I had money sufficient to enable me
to make a transient flourish before him; but as
I had no permanent source of income, and not
even a profession to lean upon, I should, by doing
so, only draw down fresh contempt upon my head,
not only from him, but from others. So I resolved
that I would not return to my home until I
had attained a station in the world that would entitle
me to the respect of my cousin. And that I
might not be turned from my purpose, I determined
to keep my arrival at New York a secret
from my parents. I struggled hard with my feelings
in forming this determination, and many bitter
tears it cost me.</p>

<p>I got off the bed, and to soothe the anguish of my
feelings, paced back and forwards in the chamber.
I perceived there was a small black bottle standing
on the dressing table, which had probably
been left there by the former occupant of the
room; and thinking it was a cologne bottle, I
smelt of it; but its contents proved to be brandy.
I put it to my lips, and drained it dry.</p>

<p>It was dark; the air was warm and heavy, and
I sat down at the open window of my chamber
with my cellar unbuttoned, and cast my eyes upward
to the stars, which shone dimly above me;
they seemed to be oppressed with the heat. I
felt very grand, and very gloomy. I threw my
hands above my head, and gazed upon the dim
stars, until they appeared to be shining within my
very soul.</p>

<p>Men have delivered themselves of maudlin sublimity
before now, and much of it has been well
received by the world; why should not I do the
same? It was the last strain of the kind in which
I indulged, and it shall not be lost to the lovers of
fine writing.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I exclaimed, "ye bright and beautiful
existences, glorious in your mystery, and eloquent
in your eternal silence; solitary in your companionships,
and in your might subservient, do ye
hold within your burning orbs the destinies of
beings like me? Creatures as ye are, formed as
I am, but to fulfil your ends, and then expire? If
ye do, O! reveal to me, in characters bright as
your own fires, the fate which awaits me! Or do
you, by your strong power, hold an unacknowledged
influence over the thoughts of men, leading
them to foretel, in their dull whisperings, those
changes of fortune, which should only be revealed
by your own voices. O, stars! bright and beautiful!
ye are high and enduring, but I am low
and transient. Speak to me, that I may know
my fate. Waste not your existence in ethereal
solitudes, but hold converse with me, who am
your fellow-being; we are children of the same
parent. Glorious cousins, satisfy my longings, and
give me to know whether I shall die the death
of old Cole's dog?"</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>Magnificent Prospects.</p>

</div>

<p>SUDDENLY I heard a strange noise; it was as
though all the starry host were shouting together.
I started upon my feet; my heart beat
terribly, and the sweat started upon my forehead.</p>

<p>It was morning. The bright warm sun was
shining full in my face, and, very much to my
astonishment, I discovered that I had not been undressed,
and that I had spent the whole night sitting
with my head resting on the sill of the window.
The stars had all modestly withdrawn
themselves, and I could not distinctly remember
whether they had answered the questions which
I had put to them or not. But with the bright
and cheerful rays of the morning, my spirits
had mounted up, and I should have been inclined
to doubt the stars themselves if they had
taken me at my word, and revealed a different
destiny from that which I wished them to. The
strange noise which had startled me was caused
by a Chinese gong; a signal for the boarders
to make preparations for breakfast, like seven
bells on board a man of war.</p>

<p>After I had dressed myself, I counted my money
over, to make sure that none had been abstracted in
the night, and then buttoned it up in my pocket, and
descended to the breakfast parlor, which was also
the dining room and the drawing room. There
were but three or four gentlemen at the breakfast
table, and I took my sent rather timidly, fearing
that the hour was not strictly a genteel one. A
young man sat opposite to me, with a pale face,
and very red whiskers, which grew under his
chin, and gave his head something the appearance
of a Ph&oelig;nix sitting on its funeral pyre. On
his upper lip were two tufts of light colored hair,
which threatened to soak up his coffee every time
he put the cup to his month. I felt very hungry,
and I could have eaten up every thing I saw before
me; but in the presence of a personage so
evidently genteel, who picked up a few crumbs of
dry toast, and carried them deliberately to his
mouth, on the ends of his long fingers, without
the least apparent satisfaction, I felt afraid to eat
any thing with a hearty good will and a smack of
the lips, a practice which I was very much given
to when I felt hungry. So I restrained the urgent
demands of my appetite, and sipped my coffee
and nibbled apiece of dry toast, as genteelly as I
could.</p>

<p>"How is lots?" said one of the gentlemen at
the table, addressing the man with the sandy moustachios.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," he replied, "but I am devlish
sorry I didn't keep that piece of property I sold
yesterday. I only made twenty thousand dollars
by the operation, and the gentleman which bought
it of me has went and made forty thousand by
selling it at Bleecker's."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes very wide to hear a man
talk so coolly about making twenty thousand dollars;
but his reply did not cause any astonishment
in the others at the table, from which I concluded
they must all be immensely rich.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the gentleman who made the first
remark, "I believe it is utterly impossible for a
man to buy a piece of property without doubling
his money on it."</p>

<p>"I believe so," said another gentleman.</p>

<p>"And so do I," said Mrs. Riggs; "there was
my milkman, old poppy Van Krouteater, which
served his customers with milk only last Tuesday
morning, rode past here yesterday afternoon
in his own carriage, with two great black
Long Island niggers, all dressed in beautiful liveries.
He had sold his farm for almost a million
of dollars, on the condition that the purchaser
should build a town on it, and call it Van Krouteater
city."</p>

<p>"That's nothing at all," said the gentleman
with the fiery whiskers; "there was a reskill of a
hackdriver called for me yesterday while I was
into Bleecker's, at the sale of some splendid lots in
Bulwer city, and he popped his ugly head into
the auction room just as the auctioneer was going
to knock down a corner lot at twenty-two hundred
dollars, 'what shall I say for you,' said the
auctioneer, catching the twinkle of the hackman's
eye; 'twenty-four,' replied the scamp, meaning the
number of his coach. 'Twenty-four hundred
dollars,' exclaimed the auctioneer; and down
went the hammer. 'What name, sir,' said the auctioneer.
'Barney,' said the hackman. 'What is
your first name, Mr. Barney?' said the auctioneer.
'Sure that is my first name,' said the hackman
'Ah, then what is your last name, sir?' said the
auctioneer. 'McFee,' says Barney. Now when
Barney found he had bought a corner lot for
twenty-four hundred dollars, without knowing it,
he almost went crazy, he was so frightened, for
he hadn't twenty-four cents in the world to bless
himself with. So the auctioneer put the lot up
again on Barney's account, and I wish I
may never sell another piece of properly if he
didn't get forty-eight hundred dollars for it; so
Barney made twenty-four hundred dollars by the
operation."</p>

<p>Having tantalized my appetite beyond all possible
endurance, with nibbling a piece of dry toast,
I get up from table, and went out to a pie shop,
where I eat apple tarts and drank coffee, until the
cravings of hunger were appeased; after which, I
read all the morning papers, and then look a walk
into Wall street.</p>

<p>Here all was bustle, and life, and gentility; the
side walks were filled with well dressed men, some
of whom carried long half bound books under
their arms, and others maps in their hands. The
walls of the houses, the trunks of the trees, the
fences, and the lamp posts, exhibited innumerable
plans of lithographed towns and cities, which were
to be disposed of at auction, on the most liberal
terms. Every man's face wore a keen and anxious
expression; a vacant stare was not to be encountered
in that whole assemblage of busy men. Every
body was talking to somebody, or watching for
something. The questions most frequently heard
were, "how's stocks?" "how's lore?" "how's
money?" And the answers almost invariably given
were, "up," "so, so," and "tight." Nobody appeared
to have an inclination to inquire after any
body's wife and children, nor to make any sagacious
remarks about the weather.</p>

<p>I had no recollection of ever having heard or
seen any thing about speculations in lots and new
cities, when I was in New York before, and I stood
on the corner of William street, watching the
crowds of men as they hurried to and fro, wondering
to myself what could be the cause of all the
stir and bustle which I witnessed, when I observed
a tall young man, with a stout ebony cane, almost
as big as his leg, in his hand, and a roll of paper
under his arm, walking with a solemn stride towards
me. I recognised the gentleman instantly;
it was no less a person than Mr. Worhoss. Remembering
our former intimacy, and that he had
not paid me the five dollars which I lent him, I felt
myself free to claim his acquaintance. But Mr.
Worhoss had forgotten me entirely. However,
when I mentioned the circumstance of his borrowing
five dollars of me, it refreshened his memory
wonderfully.</p>

"But," said Mr. Worhoss, "as the committee of
literary gentlemen were a stupid set of fellows, they
rejected my article, and, consequently, you cannot
expect me to return the money; the fault was all
theirs, and not mine; so you will know where to
lay the blame."</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss also informed me, that he had
given up literary pursuits, as he found them not
only unprofitable, but quite disreputable; as all his
intimate friends cut him, when they found he was
engaged in writing for periodicals. He said he
was now gelling rich fast, by operating in real estate.
He gave me to understand that he considered
poverty highly disgraceful. I blushed as I remembered
my own condition.</p>

<p>"I presume you have been making money since
I saw you last?" observed Mr. Worhoss.</p>

<p>"Some," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Mr. Worhoss, "been speculating
in fast property?"</p>

<p>I did not precisely comprehend the meaning of
his question, and I replied that the property which
I had acquired, was all in cash.</p>

<p>"In cash," exclaimed Mr. Worhoss; "what,
money down? Perhaps you would like to make
fifteen or twenty thousand dollars by a small investment?"</p>

<p>I replied that nothing would be more agreeable
to me; upon which he instantly unrolled the paper
which he carried under his arm, and displayed to
me a lithographed map of Gowannus city. I had
no recollection of ever having heard of such a city;
but Mr. Worhoss told me it was one of the most
prosperous in the union; and truly it had a very
pleasant appearance on paper. It was regularly
laid out with avenues and streets intersecting each
other at right angles, and plentifully ornamented
with squares and public places, with the very
grandest names.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss offered to sell me a choice of corner
lots, in a certain section of the city, at the very
moderate price of one thousand dollars each; and
he assured me if I kept them only one week, I
might sell them again for double that sum.</p>

<p>I replied that I should be very glad to make
such a speculation, but that I should not be able
to buy more than one lot.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss replied, that that should be no hinderance
to my entering into the speculation, for by
paying ten per cent. down on the purchase money,
the balance might remain on bond and mortgage,
and by repeating the operation until I had purchased
and sold a hundred lots, I could easily clear
a hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Such magnificent prospects almost deprived me
of breath. In my wildest dreams of fortune, I had
never imagined any thing half as brilliant. One
hundred thousand dollars! The very mention of
it bewildered me. But Mr. Worhoss spoke very
coolly about it, and said such operations were of
daily occurrence. He invited me into a coffee-house
near by, and asked me to take a mint julep,
and then took me down to an auction store in
Broad street, where there was a sale of lots, that
I might see with my own eyes the manner in
which fortunes were made.</p>

<p>The auction room was long and narrow, and
crowded to suffocation, with all manner of men,
who were bidding for lots, in a high state of excitement.
Some of the bidders were ruffian-looking
fellows, with long beards, and a little rivulet
of tobacco juice trickling down the corners of their
mouths; others were very neat and delicate in
their persons. Lots upon lots were knocked
down by the auctioneer; I forget in what city
they were located, but I believe it was in the city
of Julius C&aelig;sar. After the sale was over, the
buyers began to boast of their bargains, and according
to their own showing, there was not a
man present who had not made at least twenty
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>For my own part, I was strongly tempted to
make a bid, but remembering my former speculation
in an auction room, I restrained my desires
to purchase "fast property" in spite of all the
seductive temptations with which I was beset.</p>

<p>When we came out of the auction room, Mr.
Worhoss introduced me to a gentleman, whom he
called Mr. Dooitt. He was a tall, square-shouldered
man, with high cheek bones, a pale, freckled
face, and a paltry little nose; he shook my
hand, and begged me to excuse his glove; he
said he was extremely happy to see me, and hoped
I was very well, and concluded by observing
that the weather was remarkably pleasant for the
season.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss told me in a whisper that his
friend Mr. Dooitt was immensely rich, although
six months before he was as poor as a church
mouse, and that he made his money by speculating
in up-town lots.</p>

<p>I looked at Mr. Dooitt's person again, and observed
it was ornamented with a gold chain, worn
around his neck, and an enormously large breast
pin.</p>

<p>Mr. Dooitt asked me if I had a mind to speculate
in fast property.</p>

<p>I replied that I had some thoughts of doing so,
upon hearing which he winked to me knowingly;
and while Mr. Worhoss was occupied in reading
an advertisement, he whispered in my ear,
and told me not make any purchases until I
had first called at his office, and looked at a map
of a city in which he was interested in Ouisconsin;
and slipping his card into my hand, he bade me
good morning, and left me.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss gave me a map of his city&mdash;"Gowannus
City," and told me he would call on
me at my lodgings, but before he left me he cautioned
me against making any purchases except
from him, as he was bent upon making a fortune
for me for old acquaintance's sake.</p>

<p>After Mr. Worhoss left me, I sauntered about
the streets, under the cool shade of the awnings,
delighted with every thing and every body. I
considered myself already worth a fortune. All
my highest wishes were about to be gratified, and
more than I had dared to hope for would be realized.
The pleasurable anticipations in which I
indulged were almost maddening; there was,
however, one dark spot in my bright horizon&mdash;I
was ignorant of the dwelling place of Georgiana
De Lancey; but I consoled myself with the
thought that fortune had now, for a certainty,
taken me under her especial charge, and that
surely so great a requisite to my happiness as the
possession of her whom I loved would not be
denied me.</p>

<p>These were pleasant thoughts, and under the
influence of them I went home to my dinner, and
called for a bottle of three dollar Madeira, and
took wine with every body at the dinner table.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>Bright and pleasant.&mdash;On the high road to riches.</p>

</div>

<p>AS I was sitting in the hall of my boarding
house after dinner, conjuring up a thousand bright.
images, I heard my name spoken by somebody at
the door, and starting up, I perceived Mr. Dooitt.
That wealthy gentleman had called on me to invite
me to his house to tea; his carriage was at
the door, and of course I could not refuse so
great an honor. I took my seat in his barouche
in a high state of excitement. Mr. Dooitt's equipage
spoke his immense riches. His coachman
was dressed in a long blue coat, the seams of
which were covered with gold lace; he wore a
pair of bright yellow gauntlets, such as tragedy
heroes wear on the stage, and his glossy hat was
ornamented with a broad gold band. The footman
behind the carriage was dressed in the same
manner, with the exception of the gauntlets.</p>

<p>Mr. Dooitt. was not, like some great men,
ashamed of the condition from which he had risen,
but, on the contrary, spoke with becoming frankness
of his sudden elevation.</p>

<p>"Only eight months ago," said Mr. Dooitt, "I
done a small business in the hook and eye trade."
"As a jobber?" I inquired, wishing to make myself
agreeable.</p>

<p>"No, I warn't even a jobber," said Mr. Dooitt,
meekly, "I was only a commission agent for a New
England concern."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is possible," he replied, "and now I
am worth millions. But mind you, I don't want
it to be known."</p>

<p>"Why not; it is not looked upon as disgraceful,
is it?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O! no, quite the contrary," said Mr. Dooitt,
"but they would make me pay a heap of taxes if
they knew how rich I am."</p>

<p>I could not but express my admiration of Mr.
Dooitt's talents and good fortune.</p>

<p>"There is no good fortune about it," he said,
"any man may get rich if he isn't a fool. I have
taken a kind of a liking to you, and if you will
take my advice, I will put you in a way of making
two or three hundred thousand dollars in less than
six months."</p>

<p>I thanked Mr. Dooitt, with great fervency, for
his kind offers, and as he saw my eyes fill with
tears, he very considerately turned the conversation,
and told me he intended, as soon as he could
arrange his affairs, to go to Europe, where his father's
relations were living.</p>

<p>I asked him in what part of Europe his relations
lived; he said he didn't exactly know, but he had
no doubt he could easily find them for money.</p>

<p>As Mr.Dooitt's house was in the very genteelest
extremity of the city, it was almost dark before we
reached it, but there was still light enough for me
to discover that it was a bran new house, and as
nearly resembling all the rest in the same street, as
though they had all been cast in the same mould.
It was as red as red paint could make it, the windows
were shaded with bright green blinds, and the
front door and iron railings were all bronzed. As
we walked into the hall, it smelt of varnish, like a
cabinet maker's shop; every thing was bright and
new. Mrs. Dooitt was seated in the parlor, on a
crimson ottoman, with a superbly bound annual in
her hand.</p>

<p>"Allow me to make you acquainted with my
wife," said Mr. Dooilt. "My dear, this is my particular
friend, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;. I forget exactly the
name."</p>

<p>"Mr. Franco," I said, blushing very red.</p>

<p>"Mr. Franco," said Mr. Dooitt.</p>

<p>The lady rose and made a very low curtsey,
and I made a very low bow.</p>

<p>I felt very much embarrassed, but ventured to
remark that the weather was very pleasant.</p>

<p>"It is indeed very," said Mrs. Dooitt, with so
much earnestness in her manner, that I congratulated
myself upon having made an observation exactly
suited to the occasion. So I followed it up
with another on the same subject.</p>

<p>"I think we may reasonably expect a change
before long," I said.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should not be extremely surprised,
if we did experience one before a very lengthy
period of time," observed Mrs. Dooitt, emphatically.</p>

<p>Feeling entirely at a loss for another remark, I
fixed my eyes upon a plaster cast of General Lafayette,
which stood on the mantel piece, with as
much earnestness as though I had never seen one
before in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. D. seeing that I cast a glance towards the
marble centre table, remarked, that it was a beautiful
piece of mechanism, and asked me to guess
how much it cost.</p>

<p>I had not the slightest knowledge of the value
of furniture, but I felt ashamed to say so, and I
guessed a thousand dollars. At which Mr. and
Mrs. D. both laughed very loud, and both spoke
at once, and said it cost eighty dollars only. I felt
very much confused, but Mrs. D. appeared to be
highly delighted with my blunder. She asked me
to guess how much the French clock on the mantel
cost; and then Mr. D. asked me to guess how
much the card tables cost. My answers caused a
good deal of merriment to Mr. D. and his accomplished
lady, and, after having spent half an hour
in this pleasant manner, he asked me to take a
glass of champagne with him, which of course I
did not refuse, and then I was invited into the tea-room
to tea.</p>

<p>The tea-room was a little square box, with whitewashed
walls, and one window with a green blind
to it. Like the hall and the parlor, the tea-room
smelt disagreeably strong of paint. We were
waited upon by the coachman, with his blue laced
coat, but without his yellow gauntlets. The tea
table was most abundantly covered with all manner
of contrivances, for destroying the appetite;
there were two plates of cakes, a plate of cheese,
another of bread, another of crackers, two glass
dishes of preserves, a champagne glass full of radishes,
a dish of hot waffles, a plate of raw beef,
and a plate of butter.</p>

<p>I had eaten a hearty dinner at five o'clock, and
the champagne which I had just drank, had given
me a perfect loathing for food, and I was distressed
beyond measure by Mr. Dooitt and his wife, pressing
me to eat, sometimes alternately, and sometimes
together.</p>

<p>"Have you got the dyspepsia?" asked Mrs. D.</p>

<p>"Ain't you a Grahamite?" asked Mr. D.</p>

<p>"Why don't you eat?" ejaculated both together.</p>

<p>I spent a very uncomfortable half hour at the
tea table, and then Mr. Dooitt and I returned to
the parlor; Mrs. D. remaining in the tea-room,
as she said, to feed the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. Dooitt exhibited to me the plan of a good
many new cities, and he promised to name a street
after me in one of them, if I would take an interest
in it.</p>

<p>I replied, that I certainly should take a very
lively interest in it.</p>

<p>He said the kind of interest he meant, was to
buy some of the lots. He offered them to me on
the same terms that Mr. Worhoss had; but as I
had promised that gentleman that I would not
make any purchase, without consulting him, I was
obliged to decline Mr. Dooitt's liberal offer.
Finding that I would not buy any lots, he said if
I would lend him a thousand dollars, he would
allow one quarter per cent. interest per day for it,
and give me some endorsed paper as collateral
security. By doing this, he remarked, my money
would not remain idle an hour.</p>

<p>I liked this proposition very well; for the rate
of interest which he offered me, would pay my
daily expenses, and I could select some lots, either
from his city or from Mr. Worhoss's, at my
leisure. But I felt a little delicate about receiving
collateral security, from a gentleman of Mr. Dooitt's
wealth, and liberal feelings; so I told him if
he would give me his own note, and name in it
the rate of interest which he proposed to pay me,
to guard against accidents, I would not require
the collaterals. He assented very willingly to this
proposal, and I gave him the money, and he gave
me the note as I wished. After we had concluded
this negotiation, I pretended to have an engagement,
and took my leave of my generous host. It
is such men as Mr. Dooitt, I thought to myself, as
I left his door, who compel us to think well of our
species, and convince us that the human heart is
not, as some assert, wholly evil.</p>

<p>As I am writing my own adventures, I might,
of course, pass over all my own weaknesses without
noticing them, and so give the reader a more
favorable impression of my character than it
might deserve; but that, I conceive, would be
acting unfairly, and I shall therefore make a record
of my foibles with as much candor, as though
I were writing the adventures of somebody else.</p>

<p>The attentions which were shown me by the
wealthy speculator in fast property, and the bright
prospects which were opened to my delighted fancy,
by the promises of that gentleman, and my
old friend, Mr. Worhoss, nearly upset my reason.
As I walked from Mr. Dooitt's house down Broadway,
I felt very grand, and twirled round my black
ebony stick, and inclined my head from one side
to the other, as though it was so full of big
thoughts, that I could not keep it balanced upon
my shoulders. I stopped at some of the genteelest
bar-rooms, and drank a julep in one, a cock
tail in another, and a sangaree in another; and
to appear grand, I bought a shillings worth of
Spanish cigars; but I took good care not to put
one of the nauseous things into my mouth.</p>

<p>I got to my boarding house about midnight,
and went to bed, and awoke the next morning
with a burning thirst, and a terrible feeling in my
head. At the breakfast-table, I nibbled my toast,
and sipped my coffee, with as poor an appetite as
the greatest gentleman could desire. There was
not the least affectation in the mincing airs which
I exhibited. I felt miserably enough.</p>

<p>It was not long before I began to have misgivings
that the suit of clothes which I had purchased
at the "emporium of fashion," were not as
strictly genteel as they might be, and I consulted
Mr. Worhoss on the propriety of purchasing a
new suit. He advised me to do so by all means,
and said he would introduce me to his own tailor,
the celebrated Mr. Suffers, of the late house
of Allskirt and Suffers. Mr. Worhoss was very
warm in the praise of his tailor; he represented
him as being a perfect gentleman in his manners,
and so entirely devoted to the science of
cutting, that he cut up five pieces of superfine
wool dyed black cloth, annually, in experimental
garments. Like all the rest of the world,
Mr. Suffers had grown immensely rich by speculating
in lots, but he still continued to carry on
his business from a love of art.</p>

<p>For my own part, I thought the best plan would
be to employ the gentleman who published the
reports of the fashions, but Mr. Worhoss said it
was a decidedly vulgar concern, and I allowed
myself to be guided by his better judgment. He
took me to the establishment of the celebrated Mr.
Suffers, in Broadway, and introduced me to him,
and I submitted myself to the hands of that accomplished
gentleman, who took my measure for
a full suit, consisting of a black dress coat
with a velvet collar, a green satin vest, and a pair
of pantaloons of ribbed cassimere. Mr. Suffers
recommended me to have my coat of <i>inwisible</i> green,
and although it was, no doubt, presumption
in me to differ from such high authority in
matters of dress, yet I insisted on having black.</p>

<p>Fine clothes, they say, make fine birds; but
they do more, they cause fine feelings. I was so
well pleased with my new suit when I put it on,
that I made a memorandum, at the time, of the
leading ideas of an essay I meant to write on the
usefulness of tailors; but as I was afterwards very
much annoyed by the frequent calls of Mr. Suffers'
collector, I concluded not to write it.</p>

<p>Time passed pleasantly away for a few days;
I became acquainted with a good many genteel
young men, and a good many lucky speculators
in lots&mdash;noble, whole souled fellows, who spared
no expense in promoting their own pleasures,
but who were quite indifferent about the happiness
of others. Female society I was a stranger
to, but I did not regret it. The gentle image of
Georgiana De Lancey, which grew brighter and
brighter in my memory, was all-sufficient for me.
I felt myself in honor bound, for her sake, to
keep aloof from all woman kind.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>A change. Mr. Dooitt turns out to be anything but a gentleman.</p>

</div>

<p>AFTER repeated consultations with Mr. Worhoss,
and the examination of a great number of
lithographed maps, I, at last, concluded a bargain
with him for one hundred lots in the city of
Communipaw, at one hundred dollars each, ten
per cent. of the purchase money in be paid down,
and the balance to be paid in five annual instalments,
for the security of which I was to give a
mortgage on the property.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss proved to me very clearly that
the lots were worth five hundred dollars each,
and he assured me upon his word and honor that
he would not sell them for less than that to any
other person.</P>

<p>"It is first rate properly," said Mr. Worhoss,
"and you may consider yourself worth fifty thousand
dollars as soon as the bargain is closed, by
your paying the first instalment."</p>

<p>I had set my heart upon a hundred thousand,
so I did not feel much elated when I found I
should be worth only half that sum. I asked Mr.
Worhoss if he would oblige me by selling me one
hundred more lots at the same price, if I should
want them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might," said Mr. W. "if you
would not object to taking a few water lots with
them."</p>

<p>"What are water lots?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Some very beautiful situations," he replied,
which extend about two hundred yards into the
river; they require nothing but merely to be filled
up, to make them very desirable spots to build
upon."</p>

<p>He pointed them out to me on the map, and
as they looked quite as well as the others, I promised
to take them; it was a matter of very trifling
moment with me, where the lots were situated;
all that I wanted was to speculate with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Worhoss reminded me that it was near
three o'clock, and that he had made his calculations
to pay a note at the bank with the money
which I was to pay him.</p>

<p>So I ran in great haste to the office of Mr.
Dooitt, and requested that lucky operator to give
me a check for the amount I had loaned him.
But Mr. Dooitt requested me to call at some other
time, as he was busily engaged in transferring
some property.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not for me to urge a gentleman,
through whose influence I expected to make
a fortune, and I ran back empty-handed to Mr.
Worhoss, who was pacing the floor of his little
office in great agony. It lacked but five minutes
of three. When he found I had returned without
the money, he cursed and swore most vilely. He
stuffed half a dozen blank checks into his hat, and
said he must go out and kite it to save his credit.
I must confess it astonished me not a little, to
find that men so immensely rich as Mr. Worhoss
and Mr. Dooitt represented themselves to be,
should be put to such shifts for so trifling a sum
as a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The next day I called again at the office of
Mr. Dooitt, and luckily I found him disengaged;
he shook me cordially by the hand, said he was
very happy to see me, and hoped I was quite
well; asked me if I had heard any news from
Europe, and whether I should like to travel with
him.</p>

<p>I was quite overcome with his politeness, and
in my turn inquired after his health, the health of
Mrs. Dooitt, and the health of the little boy; and
then added, that he would oblige me by returning
the money which I had loaned him.</p>

<p>"O, ah, yes, certainly," said Mr. Dooitt; "if
you will call at precisely half past one o'clock, it
will give me great pleasure to do so."</p>

<p>I promised to return at that hour, and I did, to
a second. But Mr. Dooitt was not in his office,
neither did he return again on that day.</p>

<p>The next morning I waited on him again; he
was not quite as polite as he had been, and when
I reminded him that he had not kept his promise
the day before, he looked very surly, and asked
if I meant to insult him in his own office.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," I replied, "I certainly do not mean
to insult you, and I hope you did not mean to
insult me when you appointed an hour to meet
me here, without any intention of keeping the
appointment."</p>

<p>"Don't bully me in this office," said Mr. Dooitt,
raising his voice, "I won't stand it no how.
Walk in here, Mr. Carrygutt, and hear what this
fellow says." This was addressed to a cadaverous
looking clerk in the outer office, for Mr. Dooitt
was in his sanctum.</p>

<p>"Now repeat that again, will you, Mister," he
said, as his clerk poked his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"There is no need of my repeating it," I said,
"but I repeat that I want my money, and I must
have it, and I will have it."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said Mr. Dooitt, "if you must
have it, and will have it, of course I have nothing
more to say about it; get it if you can. Mind
this, I always deal fairly and honestly with every
body."</p>

<p>I was completely thunderstruck by this strange
conduct of Mr. Dooitt's, and I walked out of his
office without making him any farther reply.
Fortunately, I had his note of hand For the money
I had loaned him, with the exorbitant rate of interest
named in it, and I was determined to let
him know, that he should not trifle with me with
impunity. I went straightway to a lawyer, determined
to prosecute him on the note, and take the
full measure of vengeance which the law might
allow me.</p>

<p>I remembered to have read in the newspapers,
a few days before, of a counsellor who threw an
ink-stand at the head of the judge, in one of the
courts, and I thought he would be a very proper
person to carry on a suit with spirit. I found his
direction in the city directory, and called upon
him at his office in Beekman street; his name was
Slobber.</p>

<p>Seeing Mr. Slobber's name on a tin plate on
the window shutter, I walked boldly into a little
musty room, the walls of which were blackened
with smoke, and the windows and shelves covered
with dust and cobwebs.  A young man was writing
at a desk in one corner of the room. I asked if I
could see Mr. Slobber.</p>

<p>"Certainly you can," replied the young man,
in a voice enriched by an unaffected brogue, "if
you will please to walk into the back office."</p>

<p>I walked through a long, dirty hall, and feeling
a little timid at the idea of entering unbidden into
the presence of so spirited an individual as Mr.
Slobber, I tapped gently at the door at the end
of the passage.</p>

<p>"Come in," exclaimed a voice inside.</p>

<p>I took off my hat, and opening the door, found
myself in the presence of a little gray-headed man,
stretched out at his full length on a dirty, red
sofa, smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" said the little man, looking up in
my face, but without moving.</p>

<p>"I wanted to speak with Mr. Slobber," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that is me, I am that individual;
speak on."</p>

<p>"I have a claim for a thousand dollars," I replied,
"against a gentleman, who has not only refused
to pay me, but has insulted me grossly. I
should like to take out a writ immediately, and
have him sent to prison."</p>

<p>"I will attend to you with a gwate deal of pleasure,"
replied Mr. Slobber, and forthwith he leaped
off the sofa, and took a seat at his baize covered
table, and having favored me with three or four
puffs of segar smoke, he said, "Well, sir?" again.</p>

<p>I related to Mr. Slobber the whole story of my
loaning the money to Mr. Dooitt; told him how I
was like to lose an opportunity of making fifty
thousand dollars, by an operation in lots, and was
proceeding to tell him some other things, when a
rap was heard on the floor above our heads.</p>

<p>"Stop one minute, if you please, young man,"
said Mr. Slobber, "and I will return and hear
the remainder."</p>

<p>Mr. Slobber was gone more than half an hour;
and as he left me without any means of amusement,
I am very certain he will not take it amiss when he
finds that I employed part of the time in writing a
description of his office.</p>

<p>It was a little old fashioned room, with a very
low ceiling, and from its shape and situation, I
presume it had once been used for a dining room;
from the dusky appearance of the wall, and the
tattered condition of the paper with which the sides
were covered, and the venerable looking cobwebs
which rounded off all the angles, it would not be
unfair to infer that neither mop, broom, nor duster,
had invaded its precincts since the late war.</p>

<p>There was a wooden clock in one corner, without
any pendulum, and a pair of monstrous jack
boots hung directly under it; an Indian bow and
arrow hung in another corner, and a small birchen
canoe was suspended over one of the windows;
there were two book cases, neither of which had a
whole pane of glass, and one of them had a faded
green silk curtain, which displayed innumerable
rents; there were piles upon piles of soiled papers,
tied with red tape, and half a dozen shelves of
sheepskin covered books, well filled with dust, as
though time had been sifting the sand from his
hour glass upon them. I took one of them down
and opened it, and it emitted an odour, which suggested
no other idea than that it was caused by the
flapping of the gray wings of the old destroyer.</p>

<p>At last, Mr. Slobber reappeared, picking his
teeth, his face giving a pretty sure indication that
he had just risen from dinner. He took his seat
in an old arm chair, and having lighted a segar
with a loco foco match, he asked me to let him see
the note of hand which Mr. Dooitt had given me.</p>

<p>I reached it to him, and he contracted his eye
brows and screwed up his mouth, as he read it.</p>

<p>"Of course, you are appwised, young man,"
said Mr. Slobber, "that it is the custom always
to pay for legal adwice?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," I replied.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mr. Slobber, "I am not such
a downwight Tool as to spend my pwecious time
and money in acquiring knowledge for the benefit
of indiwiduals for nothing."</p>

<p>"Of course not," I said, "and how much must
I pay you for the advice which you are going to
give me in this business?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," replied Mr. Slobber, "the charges
are warious for legal adwice, sometimes fifty dollars,
and sometimes less. I think a ten dollar bill
would be about fair in this case."</p>

<p>This was more than I could afford to give, indeed
it was nearly all the money I had in the world;
but I saw no other alternative, so I took out my
wallet, and reached Mr. Slobber two fives.</p>

<p>He put the bills into his pocket, and gave me
back Mr. Dooitt's note of hand.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Slobber, "as you have
paid me for my adwice, of course I shall give the
best I am capable of. Don't think of going to law,
you will only incur a heavy bill of costs for nothing.
The note isn't worth two stwaws."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I inquired, although it was with
difficulty I spoke, I was so agitated.</p>

<p>"Why not, sir," said Mr. Slobber, "because
it is tainted, sir."</p>

<p>"Tainted!" I replied, looking at the note,
"how tainted?"</p>

<p>"Tainted with woosuwy, sir," replied the lawyer.</p>

<p>He then explained to me the beauty of the usury
laws, and to my great astonishment, as well as
grief and mortification, made me acquainted with
the fact, that in our free country, a man has no
right to pay what he pleases for the use of his
neighbor's money.</p>

<p>I was astounded at this intelligence. I felt humbled
and abased; I was caught in a pit of my own
digging. But I could not believe that Mr. Dooitt
would be guilty of such an act of wicked cruelty,
as to withhold my money from me. I hurried
back to his office, and requested him, very humbly,
to return me my money, and offered to give
him all the interest that was due on the note. But
he pretended that I had insulted him grossly, by
doubting his honor, and ordered me to leave his
office. He even went so far as to say, he didn't
owe me a copper.</p>

<p>I did leave his office, and without saying a
word; I was too full of grief to make a reply.
I saw too plainly that Mr. Dooitt had intended to
cheat me, from the beginning; and I had no doubt,
but that my old friend, Mr. Worhoss, had similar
designs upon me; I, however, went immediately
to the office of that gentleman, and told him all
the particulars of my transactions with Mr. Dooitt,
and observed to him, that as he had introduced
me to Mr. D., I should look to him for assistance
in getting my money back again.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Worhoss, when I had finished,
"you are a devilish sight greener than I
took you to be; if you had put confidence in me,
I would have made your fortune for you; but as
you saw proper to act on your own responsibility,
you must continue to do so. There is the door;
I have business of my own to attend to."</p>

<p>My feelings were almost too keen for endurance;
the sudden overthrow of my hopes, left me without
one prop; so deep and bitter was my grief,
that I was denied the poor solace of tears. I am
ashamed to confess that I had recourse to the vulgar
expedient of drinking brandy to drown my
reflections. Having, as I thought, drank myself
into an oblivious condition, I staggered to my
chamber, and threw myself upon the bed, and was
tormented in my drunken sleep with visions, a
thousand times more frightful than any that my
sober senses could have conjured up.</p>

<p>A very short acquaintance with almost any of
the ills of this life, will reconcile us to them.</p>

<p>When I arose in the morning, I felt much more
serene than when I lay down at night. I bathed
my temples in cologne water, and having dressed
myself with uncommon care, I assumed as pleasant
and unconcerned a look as I could, and descended
to the breakfast room; and at the table I had the
gratification of hearing the particulars of my transaction
with Mr. Dooitt related by one of the
boarders, who had not learned the names of the
parties. It caused a good deal of merriment, and
to my utter astonishment, nobody spoke a syllable
in condemnation of the scoundrel who had wronged
me; but, on the contrary, every one spoke of him
as a confounded smart fellow. In addition to
this pleasant story, I had the mortification of hearing
each of the boarders tell of some lucky fellow
who had made a fortunate operation by purchasing
lots the day before.</p>

<p>I made out to swallow one cup of coffee, and
then I left the table with my blood in a commotion.
I knew not which way to turn, nor whither
to go for relief; but with the hope of diverting
my thoughts from my melancholy situation, I took
a stroll through Broadway.</p>

<p>I was always hoping for something, I hardly
knew what; a dim form, like the shadow of a desire,
was ever before me, to beguile my senses. I
could not even now divest myself of the idea that
some piece of sudden good luck would befal me.
With feelings like these, I stumbled upon a lottery
office, and immediately purchased a ticket in a lottery,
which was to draw the next day; after I had
paid for the chance, I had but seven and sixpence
remaining in my pocket. But the possession
of the ticket placed me two or three steps
from absolute despair. My hopes had now something
tangible to feed upon, and miserable fare
though it was, they thrived upon it amazingly;
they were like balloons, the lighter the substance
with which they were filled, the higher they rose.</p>

<p>When I went to my boarding house to dinner,
I was struck aghast by the sight of my bill, which
Mrs. Riggs put into my hand as soon as I entered
the parlor door. I took it in as careless a manner
as I could, and told her I expected to receive
some money in the morning, when I would pay it.
My manner did not seem to impress my landlady
very favorably, and when I went up to my chamber,
I found the door locked; I asked for the key,
and was told that I could not have it until I had
paid my bill.</p>

<p>I afterwards found that Mr. Dooitt had called
on Mrs. Riggs, and cautioned her against keeping
me any longer in her house, as he knew I had no
money to pay my board with.</p>

<p>Of course I did not eat my dinner at Mrs.
Riggs's, but I went and satisfied my appetite with
a bowl of oyster soup, in an oyster cellar in the
vicinity of the Bear Market. Afterwards I sauntered
about the battery, and about midnight,
when the tread of feet was no longer heard, I
stretched myself out on one of the benches, and
soon fell asleep; my feverish brow cooled by a
gentle breeze, which just rippled the water, and
caused the tiny waves to dash with a pleasant
sound against the sea wall. In the morning, I
awoke refreshed and invigorated, and without experiencing
any inconvenience from sleeping on an
outdoor couch, other than a most ravenous appetite.</p>

<p>Let those enervate gentlemen who turn and
toss through a weary night, and rise from their
beds more fatigued than refreshed in the morning,
try a night's lodging on one of the battery
couches, and they will learn to speak with less contempt
of those houseless loafers who sometimes
spend a night on that lovely spot. For my own
part, I was so well pleased with my first night's
lodging, I did not scruple to sleep there again
and again. But there are, it must be confessed,
two disadvantages in making your bed on the
battery; one is, that you sometimes lay down in
company with gentlemen, who may be well
enough when the mantle of night covers them,
but whom you would not care to acknowledge
were your bed fellows when the bright sun
shines upon them; the other is, that you get up
with such a devouring appetite, that you will find
some difficulty in appeasing it, if your means do
not happen to be extensive.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>Meet with no less than two old acquaintances under very peculiar
circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p>I inquired at the lottery office, with a beating
heart, and found that my ticket was a blank. I was
now without a hope; not the slightest foundation
left for me to build upon. I had neither a cent
in my pocket, nor a single article of any value;
even my pencil case and pocket knife were both
gone. But I did not despair; I was too hungry
to feel gloomy. My supper the night before
was a very light one, and my breakfast was still
more unsubstantial; a glass of cold water was
the only refreshment I had taken. There had
been a change in the weather, and a keen cold
wind had given an edge to my appetite, sharp
enough to have rendered even a sloth ferocious.</p>

<p>There are many men, beyond a doubt, who go
down to their graves without ever having known
what hunger is; they are to be pitied who do;
they lose an existence, without having tasted one
of the highest tests that can be imparted to it;
their experience of life is imperfect.</p>

<p>I knew there was nothing to be gained by
standing still, and as I came out of the lottery
office, I turned up a street towards the Park, and
was tantalized by the savoury vapors which ascended
from the Terrapin Lunch, beneath the
American Museum. As I continued on through
Park Row, it appeared as though all the restaurateurs
in that gormandizing region, had conspired
together to torment me with an exhibition of
good things. Such steaks at the Goose and Gridiron,
with delicate streaks of yellow fat, a thousand
times more precious to the eyes than the
heaps of golden coin in a broker's window! such
oysters at the Shakspeare, and such fish and
game at the Cornucopia! I had never seen the
like before, but I averted my head and walked
on; they were as much beyond my reach as the
Georgium Sidus; if I looked upon them, it was
only in silent admiration. I continued to walk
on, until I came to Catharine street, and then
turned down towards the market, attracted
thither, perhaps, by that secret sympathy which
causes birds of the same feather to fly together.
It was certainly one of the last places that I
should have resorted to, under other circumstances.</p>

<p>The impressions which I had received of
the region round about it, were any thing but
pleasant. But I continued on my way until I arrived
opposite to the door of a cook shop, which
emitted such a delicious odour of fried eels, and
other delicacies peculiar to that quarter, that I
found it impossible to resist the temptation to go
in.</p>

<p>I took a seat at one of the little tables, covered
with oil cloth, and looked wishfully at the various
dishes which were displayed on the counter; my
eyes rested with peculiar satisfaction on a huge
basin of baked beans and pork; it appeared to me
the loveliest object in the world.</p>

<p>The master of this house of refreshments, was a
round-faced, big-bellied man, with a bright hazel
eye and glossy black hair; he wore a snowy white
apron, and brandished in his right hand an immensely
long carving knife. Supposing, as a matter
of course, or perhaps judging from my anxious
looks, that I wanted something to eat, he asked
me what I would have?</p>

<p>"Beans," I replied, for I had not the power of
resistance.</p>

<p>"Small plate or large?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Large," I replied, of course.</p>

<p>And forthwith he brought me a large plate, with
praiseworthy alacrity.</p>

<p>It was a large plate of smoking warm baked
beans, with a slice of pork, the rind nicely checkered
and most deliciously browned, lying on top;
there was a pickled cucumber on the edge of the
plate, and a slice of bread stuck on the end of the
fork.</p>

<p>I smacked my lips as I drew it before me, and
seized the knife and fork, and was about to begin,
when the keeper of the eating house exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I suppose, bossy, you mean to pay for that
'ere?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I replied, for so I did intend to
do when I got able.</p>

<p>"Then of course you mought as well hand over
a shilling first as last, if you please."</p>

<p>I was entirely at a loss for an answer; had there
been less at stake, my wits might have suggested
a satisfactory reply, but the stupendousness of the
demand, completely paralyzed me, and I let the
knife and fork fall in despair.</p>

<p>The man seeing my confusion, caught hold of
the plate, and bore it back to his strong hold.</p>

<p>Never before had I known what disappointment
was; this was its bitter dregs; the loss of my money
was a trifle in comparison.</p>

<p>"That is a magnificent vest of yours," said a
man who set at a table opposite, and whom I had
not observed until he spoke. "Why don't you
offer it to Mr. Stewpy in pledge, and take your
plate again?"</p>

<p>"Do you think he will take it?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"To be sure you will, won't you, Mr. Stewpy?"
said the benevolent stranger.</p>

<p>"I should rather think I would, if it was offered
to me," replied Mr. Stewpy.</p>

<p>I made no further inquiries, but pulled off my
coat and vest, and gave the latter garment to Mr.
Stewpy, who, in the most generous manner, returned
the plate of beans to me, and I fell to, and devoured
them as quick as I could, for fear of another
surprise.</p>

<p>"Is that all you are going to call for?" asked
the stranger, who had kept his eyes steadily fixed
upon me all the time I was eating the baked beans.</p>

<p>"I could eat something more," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you call for a couple pieces
of pie, and a couple glasses of beer?" said the
stranger. "These eating house people have no
sensibility; good eating blunts their finer feelings;
they have no soul, sir; if you don't ask for something
more, you may depend upon't Mr. Stewpy
will not offer any thing to you; and your vest is
worth a good many shilling plates."</p>

<p>I improved the hint of the stranger, and requested
Mr. Stewpy to bring two pieces of pie and two
glasses of beer.</p>

<p>"I will take pumpkin pie," said the stranger,
"and be so good as to put my beer into a pewter
mug."</p>

<p>Mr. Stewpy brought the pie and the beer without
any hesitation.</p>

<p>Feeling a little more at my ease, I took a glance
at the features of the kind stranger, who had rendered
me such important service. He was a youngish
person, with a pale oval face and black restless
eyes; he had a remarkably hook-billed nose, and
a high forehead, with a narrow promontory of
crispy black hair, extending far down the centre,
and a rivulet of bare skin running up on each side
towards the top of his head. His dress was none
of the brightest; and his shirt collar, although making
no pretensions to a snowy aspect, was ostentatiously
turned over his black stock, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"You ought always to drink out of a pewter
mug," remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Why so?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have not been in the habit of attending
lectures at Clinton Hall?" he said, without
answering my question.</p>

<p>"I must acknowledge I have not."</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so. If you had, you might
have learned that when you apply your warm lip
to the edge of the pewter, a sort of an electro-galvanic
action takes place, which imparts a very
peculiar flavor to the liquor, as it pours over the
surface of the metal into your mouth."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Fact, upon my soul," said the stranger, "just
try it. And so saying, he put the pewter mug to
my lips, and I drank a swallow, but I was obliged
to confess that I failed to detect the flavor.</p>

<p>"Now let me try yours," he said, and taking
up my tumbler, he drank off its contents, and
smacked his lips with great satisfaction, and said,
the difference was quite obvious.</p>

<p>"This is a vulgar hole," exclaimed the stranger,
after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"I dare say it is," I replied.</p>

<p>"I perfectly detest it," he said.</p>

<p>"Then why do you come here?"</p>

<p>"Why!" he exclaimed, striking the table with
his fist, and putting on an indignant frown.
"Because&mdash;but no matter; perhaps you will not
comprehend me."</p>

<p>"O, I dare say I shall," I replied, for I was
very curious to know why a gentleman should
visit an eating-house which he detested so
heartily.</p>

<p>"Because," said the stranger, with a solemn
air, "I am in advance of the age."</p>

<p>He had rightly surmised that I should not understand
him. I thought that a very strange
reason indeed, and I said so.</p>

<p>"It is because I have got a soul above these
money-making wretches. They toil for silver, I
work for fame. They revel in ignominious wealth,
I eat my crust with the Muse. Wealth is aristocratic;
genius is democratic. But I will take
my revenge of them; they shall go down to posterity
with a brand in their foreheads. I will read
you a thrilling extract from my work in the press.
There is one consolation about it, I shall get as
much for it as Milton got for his Paradise Lost.
You know Otway?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I do."</p>

<p>"He was one of us. He starved to death.
And Chatterton, poor Chatterton! You know
him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He was another. Sons of Fame, but heirs
of Indigence."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" I ejaculated.</p>

<p>"It is ever thus with poets, 'tis too true.
Who would be a poet?"</p>

<p>"Not I, for one," I replied.</p>

<p>"No more I wouldn't," said Mr. Stewpy.</p>

<p>"How could you help it?" exclaimed the
stranger, striking his forehead, and rolling up his
eyes, as though his system was undergoing an
agonizing revolution.</p>

<p>"I guess I could help it very easily," said Mr.
Stewpy; "I never writ a line of poetry in all my
life, I am blessed if I did."</p>

<p>The poetical stranger made no other reply to
the remark of Mr. Stewpy than a disdainful toss
of the head. But turning to me, he asked me
where I lodged.</p>

<p>I blushed at the question, and replied, "down
town."</p>

<p>"On the battery?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," I replied, affecting to speak
carelessly.</p>

<p>"It is getting to be too common on the battery,"
said the poet; "there are so many low characters
resort there for a lodging, it makes it
quite disagreeable for a gentleman of any sensibility.
Now Washington Square is quite select,
beautiful, clean spot, elegant houses; Waverley
Place is quite a poetical name. Then there is
the University, it imparts a classic gusto to the
reflection of having slept under its shadow."</p>

<p>This singular gentleman having delivered himself
of his encomiums on Washington Square,
begged me to excuse him, as he had an engagement
with a gentleman of the press; he said he
should be most happy to encounter me again,
when he would read me an extract from his poem,
of thrilling interest; he then shook my hand very
warmly, and bade me good bye.</p>

<p>After he had left, I asked Mr. Stewpy to make
a further advance on the vest, which he agreed
to do, and I indulged myself with a cup of coffee,
and half a dozen dough nuts.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day I sauntered
about from street to street, reading the names on
the door plates, and trying to beguile the time,
and cheat myself with idle surmises and conjecture
about the occupants of the houses. But the day
wore away very slowly. I thought the sun would
never go down. By and by, however, it was
dark, and then I walked through the most frequented
streets, up and down Broadway, and
round and round the park. I looked with envy
upon the watchmen, as they walked their prescribed
limits. They had something to walk for;
they were occupied; they were paid for sauntering.
Every body I met appeared to be engaged
about something. On what a variety of errands
were the multitudes bound who passed me. I
alone was without an aim.</p>

<p>I often wonder now, as I pass through the
crowded thoroughfares of the city, if there are any
among the seemingly hurried multitude that I
meet, who, like me, are wholly without an aim;
who walk in weariness of heart and body, striving
to forget the cheerlessness of their condition,
but reminded of it at every step by the contrasted
cheerfulness of those they encounter. What
a relief to such, is the upsetting of a coach, a
cry of fire, or of stop thief, a new print in a book-seller's
window, or a new placard stuck upon a
wall; any thing, though it may beguile the mind
but one minute, or one second; is a relief; and
it is sought for with the same earnestness that
Dives prayed for one drop of water to cool his
burning tongue.</p>

<p>I continued to walk until nearly midnight, and
then feeling sleepy; I took the poet's advice, and
sought for a lodging in Washington Square.
I found that he had not overrated it. The
houses were elegant, the grounds were neat, and
the university, though looming up in the moonlight
like a mountain of snow, cast a broad dark
shadow around. Fortunately, the large door in
front was left open, and I took the liberty of entering
the hall, and coiling myself up on the marble
steps.</p>

<p>The morning was well advanced when I awoke.
I felt cold and stiff. Marble steps make but an
indifferent resting place of a chilly night. I resolved
in my mind not to lodge again in the hall
of the university.</p>

<p>The weather was comparatively mild and
pleasant when I fell asleep, but during the night,
one of those changes, so common in our climate,
had taken place, and a dry, piercing cold wind now
swept through the streets, converting heaps of
mud and filth into clouds of fine and penetrating
dust. The shop doors were all closed, and men
hurried through the streets, wrapped in their
cloaks, and their hats drawn lightly over their
eyes, and their heads bowed down to keep the
dust out of their faces, as it met them in spiral
eddies at the corners of the avenues. The omnibuses
were all crowded, for nobody would venture
to walk through clouds of dust and coal
ashes, when they could ride under cover for a
shilling; and the little ragged omnibus boys
would hardly condescend to take their hands out
of their pockets, to open the doors for passengers.
A poor seamstress, but slenderly protected
from the cold wind by a thin shawl, might be seen
here and there, hurrying to her daily task. Little
barefooted boys were crying out, "here's the
Sun," in shrill piping voices, while their teeth
chattered together, and their faces were blue with
cold. Although I was compelled to walk very
fast to keep myself from shivering, and sometimes
by the force of a sudden gust of wind, I
could not help noticing these poor creatures, and
envying them, miserable though they were. They
had something to do.</p>

<p>I was very cold, and with my coat buttoned
close up to my throat, I have no doubt I made a
very wretched appearance; but I was indifferent
about my looks; I was hurrying down Broadway,
with a determination to go to Mr. Stewpy,
and make an appeal to his generosity for at breakfast.
I had got as far as Reed street, when, as I
was about to turn the corner, I encountered an
apparition, which drove all thoughts of breakfast
out of my mind, and caused the sweat to start
from every pore in my body.</p>

<p>The apparition which I encountered was not
of the spectral order; it would have startled me
less if it had been; but it was a ruddy cheeked,
hearty looking young man. It was none other
than my haughty cousin, whose unfeeling taunts
had driven me from my home, to seek a fortune
in the world. He was elegantly and warmly
clad, with a fur collar to his outside coat; he was
leaning on the arm of a young man, and laughing
right heartily, apparently at some observation of
his companion. As soon as I caught sight of
him, I crossed over to the opposite side of the
street, hoping to escape his notice; but he recognised
me, and called out my name. But I kept
on my way without turning my head, and heard
him exclaim, "I told you so; remember what I
told you." And then he and his companion
laughed.</p>

<p>I did remember what he had told me; the words
still burned in my brain. I thought my heart
would burst; all the blood in my veins seemed, to
rush into it at once. I wandered about, blinded
with grief; my brain was dizzy, and I felt sick. I
looked around in search of some place where I
might hide myself from observation, and give vent
to my feelings in tears.</p>

<p>I had unconsciously strayed into a wretched
street, the houses of which on either side were
disgustingly mean and filthy in their appearance.
Vile looking women, negroes, and squalid children,
hogs, and all manner of unclean things,
were seen all around; and oaths, and lewd talk,
and boisterous revelry, without mirth, were
heard proceeding from the cellars and shop doors.
I did not know before that there was such a vile
and wretched spot in the city, and I spoke to a
negro woman, who sat on the sill of a cellar door,
smoking a pipe, and asked her what place it
was.</p>

<p>"Get away, white man," replied the wench,
"you don't say you don't know where de pints is;
get along wid your bodering me. Dis is Five
Points, dat you knows precious well."</p>

<p>While I was looking around me at the squalid
misery on every side, which appeared a thousand
times more hideous from its evident association
with the most degrading vice, a little bare-headed
and bare-footed child asked me for a penny, in a
voice so weak and feeble, that it smote upon my
bean. But I looked sternly upon the little wretch,
and answered, "no."</p>

<p>"Won't you come and see mother," said the
child, at the same time reaching up to take hold of
my hand.</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She's a bed," answered the child. "Do come
and see her."</p>

<p>I had nothing to give, not even a penny, but I
could not resist the appeal of the little creature,
and I followed it through a dirty narrow passage,
into a little square court, surrounded by old wooden
sheds, in at most ruinous and dilapidated condition.</p>

<p>Into one of these hovels I was led by the child.
In a low room, destitute of every convenience, was
a bed, on which lay a middle aged woman, covered
over with a few miserable rags. Two children,
smaller than the one that had led me in, were nestling
over a few expiring embers; they were almost
naked, and their pale and emaciated faces showed
too plainly how severely the little innocents had
suffered for the want of wholesome food. The destitution
of the place was extreme. I could hardly
believe that there were human beings living, or rather
dying, in such a condition, in the very centre
of this great and wealthy city.</p>

<p>The poor woman hardly moved her head when
I came in. I stood some minutes, and gazed on the
misery around me, and forgot my own; but when
I remembered that I had not the power to offer the
slightest relief; I wept tears of bitter agony. The
little children ran to the bed side of their mother,
and she looked up at me with disappointment in
her face, when she found that I had nothing but
tears to offer her.</p>

<p>The little boy, who had gone back as soon as he
had conducted me into the room, now came running
in, exclaiming, "she's coming, mother, she's
coming; don't die mother, she's coming, she's
coming." I looked out of the window, and saw a
female approaching across the court. Ashamed to
be seen in such a place an idle looker on, I stole
out of a side door, and left it partly ajar, that I
might catch a glimpse of the gentle being who
had come on an errand of mercy, into this loathsome
place.</p>

<p>The children crowded around their visiter
when she entered, and I observed that she gave
them some food from a basket which she carried in
her hand; her face was turned from me towards
the sick woman, but I could hear the tones of her
voice, which were soft and musical. Although I
could not hear the words she uttered, I doubted
not they were words of consolation and pity. After
she had administered to the poor woman's wants,
she took a seat on the side of the bed, and taking
a book from her basket, she commenced reading;
from the few words that I heard, I supposed it was
a religious tract. The gentle murmur of her soft
voice fell upon my ear like angel whispers; I stood
completely entranced, while she was reading, with
the tears running from my eyes. The sick woman
sobbed aloud, and the gentle being at her side,
when she laid down her book, spoke a few words
to her, and then took off her bonnet, and knelt
down by the bedside to pray.</p>

<p>When she knelt down, her face was turned towards
me. My eyes were almost blinded with
tears, but I could not be mistaken. She lifted her
eyes to Heaven. I could never forget their gentle
expression. It was Georgiana De Lancey.</p>

<p>She crossed her hands upon her breast, and
prayed long and fervently for the sick woman and
her children. O! that I too could have been remembered
in her prayers. Surely, I thought, if
ever prayer be heard, it must be when it is breathed
by lips like hers.</p>

<p>Had she been a stranger to me, I could not have
looked upon her unmoved. Had I never loved
her before, I must have loved her then. When I
saw her last, she was in a crowded theatre, amid
the glare of bright lights, and surrounded by forms
and faces, perhaps as beautiful as her own, and I
thought her then the loveliest vision that had ever
been revealed to mortal eyes. In the two years
that had elapsed, she had grown in stature, and,
if possible, in beauty, and now I saw her in her
proper sphere, like one of God's particular angels,
just lighted upon earth on an errand of love.
When I saw her last, I had some hope, but now I
had none. I had not the courage to hope to be
ever admitted into her society. I felt the wretchedness
of my condition in all its force. I had
struggled in vain. The objects at which I aimed
could never be mine; they were placed at an immeasurable
distance from me. I felt that I was
doomed to misery; the prophetic words of my
cousin had been again repeated, but I had no kind
parents now upon whose bosom I could pour out
my grief; and no tender sister to mingle her tears
with mine. But I could die, and I exulted in the
thought. Death would not turn from me. I resolved
to die, and I felt calm.</p>

<p>I looked again at the fair vision before me, but
my eyes were blurred with tears; I never expected
to behold her again, until I should look upon her
in the next world.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>Verifies the old saying, it never rains but it pours; I meet
with another old acquaintance.</p>

</div>

<p>IN opposition to half the world, and perhaps to
the whole of it, I must be allowed to say, that
hunger and cold are life preservers.</p>

<p>I am very certain that if my back had been
warm, and my belly well filled, when I quitted the
miserable hovel in the Five Points, I should have
gone immediately to the nearest and most convenient
spot, and there have put an end to my existence.
My determination to do so was fixed.
But I had not walked the length of half a dozen
blocks, before the piercing cold wind, and the urgent
demands of my appetite, completely drove
all thoughts of suicide out of my head. The idea
of killing myself before I got something warm and
comfortable to eat, was not to be endured. Mr.
Stewpy, and his warm cooking stove, completely
usurped the place in my affections, which Georgiana
De Lancey and my cousin occupied but a
few minutes before.</p>

<p>This is a humiliating confession to make, and
perhaps justice to myself would allow me to withhold
it; but as I am writing a true history of my
adventures, and not a fictitious story, I feel bound
to record it.</p>

<p>I was walking as fast as I could towards the
eating house of the portly Mr. Stewpy, when, as
I crossed Water street, my eye caught sight of
the sign of the Foul Anchor, which brought to my
recollection the fact that I had left my bag of
clothes there in charge of Mr. Murphy, the landlord,
the day on which I came over from the navy
yard, a circumstance which I had unaccountably
forgotten. The bag contained some articles of
value, and I stepped into the house, and inquired,
after my property.</p>

<p>The bar-room was full of sailors, drinking and
singing, and it was some time before I could get
the bar-keeper to attend to me. Mr. Murphy, the
landlord, bluntly and resolutely refused to give me
back my bag, notwithstanding I pointed it out to
him, among a heap of others, and told him I could
describe its contents. He said it was left in his
charge by a sailor, and he would not deliver it up
to a long coated highbinder.</p>

<p>While I stood disputing with Mr. Murphy, one
of the sailors stopped short in the middle of a
song, and stepping up to me, exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Hallo, shipmate!"</p>

<p>But as I did not know him, I supposed he wanted
to pick a quarrel with me, and so I turned my
back upon him, without noticing him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the sailor, with an oath, "I see
how it is; now you have got a long tailed swinger
on, you are too proud to speak to an old shipmate."</p>

<p>I looked at the man again, and notwithstanding
his voice sounded very familiar, I could not recognise
him.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," I said, "I do not remember
you; but if you remember me, I am very glad
to hear it. Perhaps you can convince Mr. Murphy,
here, that I am no highbinder, although I
have got a frock coat on."</p>

<p>"What, disremember me," exclaimed the sailor,
"after you and I have rid half over South
America, on one horse together."</p>

<p>"What, is it Jerry?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" he said, "Jeremiah Bowhorn, himself.
I guess it's me. I am not certain, but I
believe so."</p>

<p>I was so delighted, I could have fallen upon his
neck and kissed him. I had now found a friend.
It was no wonder that I did not know him; he
had but recently recovered from an attack of the
small pox, and his once handsome face was very
badly marked.</p>

<p>Jerry was not less delighted to meet with me,
than I was at meeting him. He took me out of the
bar-room into the back parlor, or dining room,
where we soon became acquainted with each
other's situation and prospects. He called for
something to eat, and while I was regaling myself
with same baked beef and potatoes, and a glass
of Monongahela whiskey, he gave me a summary
of his adventures since we parted company in
Buenos Ayres, the conclusion of which was, that
he was paid off the day before from his last ship,
and that he had something more than a hundred
dollars in his pocket, any part of which, or the
whole, was entirely at my service.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy, the landlord, finding that I was
not a highbinder, and that the bag of clothes
really belonged to me, delivered it up to me. I
took off the coat, which had caused me to be
regarded with suspicion, and put on my blue
jacket, and exchanged my black satin stock for
a black silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>Jerry swore that I looked more ship-shape, and
something like a man in my new dress, or rather
my old one, and he was so well pleased with my
appearance, that he insisted on taking me up
stairs into the parlor to introduce me to Miss
Mary Ann, the landlord's daughter. As I saw
Jerry thought it would be conferring a great
honor upon me, I made no objection, and was
accordingly introduced to the young lady.
The parlor of the Foul Anchor was on the
second floor, and the front windows commanded
a view which included a coppersmith's shop, a
clothing store, and a camboose factory. Jerry
called the parlor the ladies' cabin, and Miss Mary
Ann sat in it, surrounded by the gifts of a thousand
ocean rovers. She was an only daughter,
and a pretty little black-eyed girl she was. She
had a round face, glossy black hair, and sparkling
bright eyes; as she was always good-natured,
and neat in her dress, she won the good-will of
all her father's boarders, who rarely failed to
bring her a present when they returned from sea.
Her little parlor was literally filled with all manner
of curious things, enough to stock a dozen
village lyceums. There were sea-fans, and
branches of coral, Indian arrows, and models of
ships, ostrich eggs and whale's teeth, stuffed birds
and flamingo's feathers, shark's jaws and albatross'
wings, the skin of a penguin, and Chinese
slippers, a Turkish pipe, and a model of London
Bridge, a glass ship and a view of Mount Vesuvius,
and a thousand other equally rare and curious articles.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Ann affected to simper and look
shy, and as I felt in no humor for trifling, I remained
but a very few minutes with her.</p>

<p>Jerry was a favorite in the house, and to please
him Mr. Murphy consented to receive me as a
boarder. I had not fully recovered from the
severe shock which I experienced in the morning
in encountering my cousin and Georgiana De
Lancey; no, no, my feelings had been so severely
worked upon that their elasticity was gone; I felt
heart-broken and dejected still, and was still determined
upon self-destruction; the more familiar
the idea became, the less repugnance I felt to the
act. I saw no prospect of realizing my former
hopes; but as suicide was an act not to be repented
of, I concluded to wait a few days longer
before I consummated my intentions.</p>

<p>In the evening, the sailors grew very boisterous,
and to escape from the noise and confusion,
I went up to Miss Mary Ann's parlour, where I
found a gentleman seated alongside of her, whom
she introduced to me as Mr. Davis, mate of one
of the liners. He was a stout young man, with
light hair, and a florid complexion; dressed in a
blue coat, with bright buttons, and a white vest,
and a very high shirt collar. He was balancing
himself on the hind legs of his chair, when I entered,
but on being introduced to me, he rose and
shook me by the hand, and said he should be
much pleased to see me on board the Columby.
He then took his seat and balanced himself as
before, and after a few minutes silence, he asked
me if I had heard any news.</p>

<p>I answered that I had not.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Ann said she had heard, but she
couldn't positively say it was true, that the Dutch
had taken Holland.</p>

<p>Of course, we all laughed at this bright sally,
and Mr. Davis sat looking for full five minutes at
Miss Mary Ann, with the liveliest satisfaction depicted
in his countenance. He then asked me
if I had noticed which way the wind was.</p>

<p>I told him I had not.</p>

<p>But Miss Mary Ann, with a saucy toss of the
head, said she guessed it was "nor-west and by
west, half west, Captain West." Mr. Davis and
I laughed again, but the young lady pouted out
her lips, and looked very surly.</p>

<p>Thinking that I was probably the cause of her
pouting, I rose to go, when she jumped up, and
giving me a wink, told me she was all ready, and
begun to put on her shawl and bonnet.</p>

<p>I was quite taken by surprise, and was just going
to ask her what she meant, when a glance
from her roguish black eye gave me to understand
that I must remain mute.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis looked a north wester at me, but he
said nothing. When the young lady had adjusted
her hat to her satisfaction, she requested Mr.
Davis to excuse her, as she had engaged herself
to go to the museum with me.</p>

<p>I followed her out, feeling very foolish, as I
had not a copper in my pocket, and I was ashamed
to acknowledge my poverty. But she soon
relieved me from my embarrassment by slipping
a dollar into my hand, and telling me not to think
any thing amiss of it, as she only wanted to make
her beau feel jealous.</p>

<p>I was glad to find that Miss Mary Ann had no
other motive for making so free with me. We
went to the museum, and afterwards to a confectioner's,
and then returned home, and discovered
Mr. Davis walking to and fro on the opposite
side walk, under the shadow of the awning.
Probably he was meditating some stupendous
plan of revenge, such as drowning himself, or
murdering me and his sweetheart. But whatever
his thoughts or feelings were, they did not
prevent him from visiting the young lady every
night for the next week; and she omitted no opportunity
of tormenting him, by bestowing the
sweetest smiles upon me whenever I was present.</p>

<p>I had been at the "Foul Anchor" a week, when
I found Jerry one morning sitting on his chest,
and looking very much cast down and dejected;
I sat down by his side, and commenced talking
to him, but it was some time before he would make
me a reply; he, however, at last, told me the
cause of his down heartedness.</p>

<p>"The long and the short of it is, Harry," he
said, "I have been very misfortunate; I never
was caught in a white squall before, and now I
have lost every rag of canvass; blown clean out
of the bolt ropes; not a thread left. You see the
facts of the case is simply this: I got into a hack
as was standing before the door here yesterday,
for a bit of a ride. Where shall I drive, says
the hackman; any where, says I. Well, that is
nowhere, says the driver, so I'll stop here until
you conclude on something a little more particular.
Just then, I recollected there was a
young woman of my acquaintance as lived up
town, and which I wanted to see. so I gave
the hackman her number, and told him to drive
me there. When we got there, I squared the
yards with the driver, and in I went, and found the
young woman all alone, and down we sat together,
and had something to drink quite sociable.
Very soon I begins to feel drowsy, and the
young woman, says she, lay down on the settee,
Jerry, and rest yourself; so down I lay, and when
I got up again, I found I had been asleep, and I
wish I may be blown into a gin shop if I warn't
skinned clean O! The young woman had not
only picked my pockets of every cent there was
in them, but she had even taken the shoes off my
feet, and shoved them up the spout along with my
new hat. So I had to toddle back again, bare
footed and bare headed, and without a sixpence
in my pocket to pay for a tort of grog."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mr. Murphy, who had listened
to Jerry's recital, "you didn't leave the
young woman's house without smashing every
thing into it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I didn't," said Jerry. "All I cared
about it for, was, because I had just a hundred
dollars in my pocket, and was going to give half
of it to you, and the other half to my mother;
but now I shall not go to see the old woman,
for I don't like to go home to her without a dollar
in my pocket after being gone from her so long."</p>

<p>Jerry's eyes filled with tears as he spoke of his
mother, but he brushed them away, and soon resumed
his usually cheerful tone.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>Contains a Ballad.</p>

</div>

<p>I BEGAN to grow very restless and dissatisfied
at the Foul Anchor. Miss Mary Ann favored me
with more attentions than I coveted, and I began
to fear that what she intended as a jest, would end
in earnest. Indeed, she had already asked me to
take the place of bar-keeper to her father, but I
declined her kind offer.</p>

<p>My mind having nothing to feed upon, began
to busy itself again with my cousin's prediction,
and with the all beauteous Georgiana De Lancey;
and the thought of destroying myself would occasionally
intrude itself into my mind.</p>

<p>I was sitting, the morning after Jerry's disaster,
in Miss Mary Ann's parlor, with my face covered
with my hands, and my busy fancy raising up the
ghosts of a thousand withered follies, when that
young lady bounded in, and reached me a little
dirty looking misshapen letter. She said it was from
Jerry Bowhorn. I opened it and read as follows:</p>

<p>"FRIEND HARRY.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;This is to inform you as I
have entered in Uncle Sam's service, and have
took three month's advance. I have kept money
enough to have a good drunk, and the rest I send
to you. Keep it and spend it for my sake. I wanted
to of given you more, but that young woman,
blast her&mdash;but never say die. So no more at present
till death, and don't forget your old shipmate,</p>

<p>"JEREMIAH BOWHORN."</p>

<p>Enclosed in the letter, were three ten dollar bills.
I read the letter to Miss Mary Ann, and she agreed
with me, that Jerry was the best and fr&euml;est hearted
fellow in the world. I said that I loved him like
a brother.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she, looking at me, while a blush
stole over her pale face, "do you indeed love
him?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, and in truth I do; see what he has
done for me."</p>

<p>She tripped out of the room, and in a few minutes
returned, and with her face averted, she put
a little package into my hand, and then ran out
again, without speaking a word.</p>

<p>I opened the little package, and found it contained
a roll of bank bills, wrapped up in a piece
of greasy brown paper; there were about sixty
dollars in almost as many bills, and of as many
different banks. I could not misunderstand this
manifestation of the young lady's kind feelings, and
to prevent any further indiscretion on her part, I
determined to quit her father's house immediately.
Accordingly, I went down to the bar-room, having
first put the roll of bills into the young lady's
work box, to pay Mr. Murphy for my board, and
to my surprise, I found that Jerry had paid a
month in advance for me. This new proof of his
attachment and kindly feelings, made so keen an
impression upon my mind, that in the warmth of
my feelings, I resolved to unite my fortune with his,
and not set lightly by a friend who had acted so
generously towards me.</p>

<p>So I went off to the rendezvous for shipping seamen,
in search of my friend Jerry, with a firm determination
of entering on board the same ship
with him; but when I got there, I found that he had
been carried off to the receiving ship, about an
hour before, as drunk as a lord.</p>

<p>Having had time to make a few wholesome reflections,
I got the better of my enthusiastic determination,
and once more I began to think of proving
my cousin a lying prophet. Having my bag
under my arm, and being in the neighborhood of
Mr. Stewpy's eating house, I stepped in there to
rest and refresh myself. I redeemed my green satin
vest from Mr.Stewpy, and put it on again, together
with my frock coat and satin stock, and with them
all my former pride, and anxiety for distinction and
riches, seemed to return.</p>

<p>While I was adjusting my dress, the poet came
in; he was overjoyed at seeing me; he inquired
after my health, and said he had been very anxious
to meet with me, as he wanted to get my opinion
of a ballad that he was going to insert in his
poem, which was in the press. He said he should
place a very high estimate upon my opinion, as he
knew from my phrenological developments, that
I had considerable soul.</p>

<p>The poet looked very hungry, and as Mr. Stewpy
had just brought in a famous piece of roast
beef, I invited him to dine with me. I ordered
two shilling plates, and at the poet's suggestion,
two cups of coffee, and a small plate of pickles.
Our dinner was soon despatched, and then he took
a roll of manuscript out of his hat, and read the
ballad. The thrilling extract, he said, he would
read to me at some other time.</p>

<p>I begged a copy of the ballad, and as the reader
may not have met with the poem to which it belonged,
and in which it should have appeared, I
will transcribe it for his benefit.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>THE COUNT COMMUNE DE PAS.</P

<p>A BALLAD.</p>

<p>I.</p>

</div>

<p>There was once a tall, fine gentleman, came all the way from
France,<br/>

To teach the beaux and ladies all, the genteel way to dance.<br/>

His hair was black as Lehigh's mines, it hung in glossy curls;<br/>

His mouth was wide; his eyes were black; his teeth, two rows
of pearls.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>II.</p>

</div>

<p>Mustachoes, frowning fiercely black, upon his lips he bore,<br/>

And rings, both large and numerous, upon his hands he wore;<br/>

He was praised by all the ladies fair, and puffed by all the
press;<br/>

They set him forth perfection's self, the Prince of <i>politesse</i>.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>III.</p>

</div>

<p>Now this very <i>fine</i>, tall gentleman, kept thinking all the while.<br/>

"What a fool am I to teach dese brutes to dance in true French
style;<br/>

Tree tousand dollar, more or less, is all dat I shall gain,<br/>

But a handsome fortune I might make by Hymen's <i>Coup de
main</i>."</p>

<div id="center">

<p>IV.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>Nons verrons</i>," said this gentleman, "we will see what I shall
do,"<br/>

And he put his fiddle in its bag, and close the strings he drew.<br/>

"<i>Va laissez moi</i>. One fiddle bow, I never more shall draw,<br/>

I'll be one Count, to-morrow night, <i>le Comte Commune de Pas</i>."</p>

<div id="center">

<p>V.</p>

</div>

<p>"To-morrow night," was ushered in, it was a night most rare,<br/>

A grand <i>soiree</i> was held up town; the Count, of course, was
there.<br/>

He danced such steps! the gentlemen beheld him in a rage,<br/>

For the ladies all declared <i>such</i> steps would ornament the stage.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>VI.</p>

</div>

<p>"But stop," said one, "he is no Count; he cannot sing a song."<br/>

The Count was asked to volunteer, "<i>oui Madam, certainment</i>!"<br/>

And <i>such</i> a song! not one false note, in foreign accents too!<br/>

The envious gentlemen confessed, he was a Count most true.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>VII.</p>

</div>

<p>A lovely girl shone there that night, her father's pet and pride,<br/>

She heard the men, with slanderous tongues, the foreigner deride.<br/>

She knew he <i>was</i> a real Count, by a never failing sign,<br/>

His hands were small and delicate, Lord Byron's test, and mine.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>Now to show to all the town her taste, and prove she was no
dunce,<br/>

She saw him dance, she heard him sing, and fell in love, at once.<br/>

"<i>Ah ha! sans doute</i>, my fortune's made," cried Count Commune
de Pas,<br/>

"One rich bank president shall be my father in the law."</p>

<div id="center">

<p>IX.</p>

</div>

<p>This lovely girl, in one week's time, was languishing a bride,<br/>

And this very tall, fine gentleman, was lounging at her side,<br/>

Whilst her pa and ma were rummaging their son in law's
'scrutoire,<br/>

To seek the Count's credentials, and find out if all was fair.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>X.</p>

</div>

<p>Now suddenly they pounced upon a bag of faded green,<br/>

"Why wife," cries pa, "hang me if here is not a violeen!"<br/>

"A violeen! why bless my soul! and here's a bundle stout<br/>

Of bills for teaching boys to dance, all regular mode out."</p>

<div id="center">

XI.

</div>

<p><i>Sans ceremonie</i>, out of doors, the Count Commune de Pas<br/>

Was straightway kicked into the street, by his father in the
law,<br/>

And the lovely bride began to pine, and would have been a
corse,<br/>

But the legislature, when it met, awarded a divorce.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>XII.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>Par bleu! ma foi! mon Dieu! Sacre!</i>" the gentleman did
say,<br/>

As he took a monstrous pinch of snuff, and quickly walked
away.<br/>

"One <i>mes alliance</i> I did make. I shall go back to France.<br/>

I'll see these yankees all be dem, they shall never learn to
dance."</p>

<p>"How do you like it?" asked the poet, looking
round with a triumphant air, when he had
done reading it.</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed," I replied, "only I think
if I had been in the count's place, I would have
claimed my bride."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have done no such a thing," said
Mr. Stewpy, "I would have gone right off and
commenced a suit for 'salt and battery 'gin the old
'ristocrat, her father, the old villain! that's just
the way with them bank-men. If I had been on
the jury, I'd guv the count as much damages as
he had a mind to ask for." So saying, Mr.
Stewpy puffed out his cheeks, and whetted his
carving knife very fiercely.</p>

<p>The poet smiled scornfully, and said, "You
are both wrong. In the first place, I do not believe
that either of you would have practised such
a high handed piece of deception as the count
did; and if you had, you would have sneaked off
as he did."</p>

<p>"That is very true," said Mr. Stewpy; "nobody
but a Frenchman would have had the impudence
to did that thing."</p>

<p>"'Cepting 'twas an Irishman," said Mr. Stewpy's
assistant.</p>

<p>Hereupon arose a little discussion between
these two gentlemen, which ended very differently
from discussions in general; for both the disputants
came to the same conclusion, namely:
that it was quite possible for any body to have
been guilty of as great a piece of roguery as the
count was, except an American; and that it was
entirely out of the range of possibility for one of
their own countrymen to err in any thing.</p>

<p>"Well," said the poet, addressing himself to
me and Mr. Stewpy, for he appeared to look upon
Mr. Stewpy's assistant as altogether unworthy
of his attention, "you are both of you a fair sample
of the critics of the present day, who, instead
of considering a character philosophically,
and tracing out his true springs of action, condemn
him for not acting as they think they would
act themselves, if they were placed in his situation,
with entirely different motives to influence
them. No man is qualified to judge of the naturalness
of a fictitious character, unless he be either
possessed of sufficient discernment to enable him
to comprehend the whole scope and design of the
author who created it; or of sufficient enthusiasm
to identify himself so completely with it, as to
lose sight of his own individuality, and feel his
soul swayed to and fro by the same influences
which prompt it to action.</p>

<p>"You see now that when Mr. Stewpy said if
he had been in the count's place, he would have
gone to law with the old bank president, he forgot
that, if he had been in the count's place, he would
not have had his present high minded and democratic
feelings."</p>

<p>"You are right there, for once," said Mr.
Stewpy.</p>

<p>"And you," said the poet, turning to me, "if
you had been in the count's place, and had married
the young lady for the sake of her father's
money, it would have been the last thing you
would have thought of doing, to lay claim to
your bride, after being kicked out of doors."</p>

<p>I was compelled to acknowledge, on re-considering
the matter, that the count was quite right
in pocketing the affront put upon him, and going
back to France.</p>

<p>"However," resumed the poet, "it is not my
intention to defend the character of the count very
warmly, for I have bestowed but little care
upon his composition. The fact is, between you
and I and Mr. Stewpy, I have been accused by
the critics of ignorance of the languages, and so
I wrote this ballad to convince them that I knew
French. But in the main, I disapprove of sprinkling
original compositions with quotations and
foreign words. An author's productions should
show the culture of his mind, as a fine melon shows
the richness of the soil on which it was raised, by
its size and flavor, and not by a daub of manure
sticking upon its rind."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Mr. Stewpy; "as if I
was to send you a plate of this fat mutton, with a
turnip top on to it, to show you what the critter
was fatted on."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the poet. "Now," he exclaimed,
"were I to read you an extract from my
serious poem, the Deserted Daughter, you would
hardly believe that I could write a ballad like
this."</p>

<p>"Quite impossible, I dare say," said Mr. Stewpy,
who appeared highly delighted with the poet's
conversation.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Sir," continued the poet, throwing
back his coat collar, and brushing up his hair
with his fingers, "some people think an author is
like a shopkeeper, who always knows the exact
amount of his stock in trade, and who can, at any
moment, display any article in his shop, but can
do no more. But far different is it with the poet;
he knows not himself; of the pearls and sparkling
gems which lie hid in the depths of his own
genius, like jewels in the sea, until the workings
of his mind, like the billows of the ocean, wash
them from their secret caves, and they are exposed
to his view like gems upon the sea-shore, all
bright and sparkling. And when the poet has
glutted his eyes upon them, he may, if it suit his
humor, give them to the world. For the offerings
which genius bestows upon the world are gifts;
they endure forever, and there is nothing given
in return. But the bequests of conquerors and
statesmen are mere lendings; they avail but little,
and their cost is infinite. A battle gained has
more than once cost a nation its liberty. Thousands
of years have flown over the world since the
great temple of the wise king crumbled into ruins,
but the sweet notes of his golden harp still vibrate
on the ear. Think you that half the bright and
glorious things which meet the poet's gaze are ever
looked upon by other eyes? O! no, he revels in a
world you know not of. Shakspeare knew Juliets
more than one I trow, and fairy queens were
Spenser's constant guests; and cherubim and
angels lovelier far than those which on the perishable
canvass live of Raffaello, were his sitters oft;
and forms of deities and patriarchs towering high,
in simple majesty, more numerous far than those
which Michael chiselled from the stone, were seen
by him, but never by the world; the high basilica,
if placed beside the mighty model to his eye revealed,
would dwindle to the cottage of a cit."</p>

As the poet concluded, a butcher's boy, who
was eating his beefsteak at one of the tables, exclaimed,
"I couldn't have did it better myself."
A compliment which the poet did not appear to
estimate very highly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Stewpy, who had more soul than the
poet gave him credit for, exclaimed, "Good!
that's what I call just the thing, neither underdone
nor overdone. It's worth a treat anyhow, and if
nobody else won't stand it, I will."

<p>As no one made an offer to stand a treat, Mr.
Stewpy redeemed his promise by giving each of
the company a glass of small beer.</p>

<p>The poet drank his down at a swallow, and
having pulled his cap as much over his eyes as his
nose would permit, he wrapped his old camblet
cloak about his person, and stalked out very
grandly.</p>

<p>When I was left alone to my thoughts, I could
not but accuse myself of being a poet, although
I had never dreamed of such a thing before, for I
had been living in a world of hopes and fears,
which none but myself knew of; and I had viewed
myself in situations which the world had never
yet seen me in.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>Gain employment.</p>

</div>

<p>THE generosity of my old shipmate had rescued
me from absolute want, and given me a
short respite from death. The means which I
now possessed I was resolved to use with the
greatest prudence, and make one more exertion
to prove my proud cousin a liar, and render myself
worthy of Georgiana De Lancey. I tried
hard to forget her, but without success; I could
sooner have forgotten myself; she was a part
of my existence. She hovered over me in my
dreams at night, and walked by my side through
the day; I heard her voice in every gentle sound,
and I saw her sweet smile in every thing that was
bright and beautiful. The folly and absurdity of
such feelings towards one who knew nothing of
me, and of whom I knew nothing, were apparent
to me, but I could not overcome them. I could
only hope that time and exertion might eradicate
them; I dared not to hope that they would ever
be gratified.</p>

<p>In accordance with my prudent resolutions, I
obtained a cheap boarding house, and in a few
days, I chanced to see an advertisement in one of
the morning papers, for a clerk in an office in
South street. I determined to let no opportunity
pass of gaining employment, though it were in
ever so humble a capacity. I had waited upon
Fortune long enough to find that I was not one of
her favorites, and now I meant to depend solely
upon my own exertions.</p>

<p>The advertisement directed applicants for the
situation to apply at the counting room of Marisett
&amp; Co. in South street, between nine and ten
in the morning. So I dressed myself as neatly as
I could, and made my appearance at the appointed
place, as the clock struck nine, determined to be
the first on the list of applicants.</p>

<p>I felt a little nervous, as I went in, and inquired,
with some trepidation, for Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>One of the clerks who was writing at the nearest
desk, spoke to another clerk, whom he called Mr.
Hopper, and asked if Mr. Marisett had come
down?</p>

<p>"Mr. Marrisett is not in the office," said Mr.
Hopper, addressing himself to me, "but our Mr.
Bargin is in. Have you any business with the
firm?"

<p>"Nothing <i>very</i> particular," I replied, "I wanted
to make application for the clerkship which is
vacant."</p>

<p>The announcement of my business gained me a
glance from all the other clerks, who looked at
me over their desks.</p>

<p>"O, ah!" said Mr. Hopper, "you will find
our Mr. Bargin in the private office. Perhaps he
can arrange matters with you."</p>

<p>Mr. Hopper pointed with his pen towards the
door of the private office, and I entered, with my
hat in my hand. It was a neatly carpeted room,
and the walls were hung round with the portraits
of ships. There were three writing desks, with a
broad bottomed mahogany arm chair to each, one
of which was partly filled by a long sided cadaverous
looking gentleman, with his neck confined in
a stiff white cravat; he was very neat in his
dress, and looked as though he had just been taken
out of a bandbox. A pair of green colored
kid gloves, as spotless as a snow drop, lay aside
of a pile of unopened letters, on his desk before
him. As there was no other person in the office,
I supposed, rightly enough, that this was Mr.
Bargin. He looked an me inquiringly, as entered,
and I told him the object of my visit.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," he said, "have the goodness
to take a seat for a few moments."</p>

<p>I sat down, and soon after another gentleman
came in. He addressed Mr. Bargin, as "William,"
and Mr. Bargin called him "Mr. Garvey."</p>

<p>Mr. Garvey took up the letters which Mr. Bargin
had opened, and glanced over them very
rapidly, apparently imbibing their contents with
as much ease as a mirror reflects an object when
held before it.</p>

<p>Mr. Garvey was a very spare gentleman, and
his hair was very red; his dress was of the very
straitest cut of the straitest of all possible sects,
Hicksite quakers; his coat had neither a superfluous
button, nor a superfluous seam; and no luxurious
linen showed itself above his narrow confined
neck-cloth, to hide the sharp points of his projecting
jaws.</p>

<p>"The cotton market looks well," said Mr. Garvey.</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Mr. Bargin.</p>

<p>"Them sea islands will leave a handsome margin,"
said Mr. G.</p>

<p>"Very much so," replied Mr. B.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Mr. Garvey, putting his
mouth close to Mr. Bargin's ear, but speaking
loud enough to be heard in the next office.</p>

<p>"Thee wants to apply for the situation, does
thee?" said Mr. Garvey, addressing himself to
me.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, rising.</p>

<p>"What house was thee in last?"</p>

<p>"I have never been employed in any counting
house," I replied.</p>

<p>"What is thy name?"</p>

<p>"Harry Franco."</p>

<p>"Well, Henry, how old is thee?"</p>

<p>"I am about twenty. But my name is Harry."</p>

<p>"Thee is particular, Harry, about thy name;
thee shouldst also be particular about thy age. Is
thee just twenty, or more than twenty, or not quite
twenty?"</p>

<p>"A little more than twenty."</p>

<p>"I should think so. I don't think thee will answer,
but thee can sit down and wait until our John
Marisett comes in; he will arrange with thee."</p>

<p>Very fortunately Mr. Garvey put no more questions
to me, or if he had, it is probable I should
have given him a reply that would have ruined my
prospects with the house of Marisett &amp; Co.</p>

<p>After Mr. Garvey had left, Mr. Bargin remarked,
that it was the senior partner of the firm who
wanted a clerk, and consequently he preferred
making the engagement himself, otherwise there
would be no necessity for me to wait for him.</p>

<p>But I was not kept waiting a great while longer,
for Mr. Marisett came in very soon after Mr. Garvey
went out. He spoke to me before he read one
of his letters, and having asked me one or two unimportant
questions, he said that, although he had
named the hour in his advertisement, he should not
be able to attend to me, and requested me to call
on him again at five o'clock, when he would be at
leisure.</p>

<p>The words and kind manner of Mr. Marisett,
were drops of honey to me, and I left the counting
room with the most agreeable anticipations of success.</p>

<p>Time went wearily with me until five, and just
as the clock struck the appointed hour, entered
Mr. Marisett's private office, and found him at his
desk alone.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, looking at his watch, "there is
nothing like punctuality. Sit down."</p>

<p>After writing a few minutes, he laid down his
pen, and wheeled round his chair, folded his hands
quietly together, and having paused a moment,
asked me my name, what my former occupation
had been, how long I had been in the city, and
what my age was; but in a manner so kind and
encouraging, that I felt assured there could be
nothing gained by practising the least deception,
and so I related to him, as plainly and as shortly
as I could, the particulars of my adventures since I
left my home; the manner in which I got my money
on board the man of war, and the manner in
which I had lost it. I said nothing, however,
about the predictions of my cousin, nor of the
beauty of Georgiana De Lancey.</p>

<p>He listened very patiently to my relation, sometimes
smiling slightly, and sometimes looking very
grave. When I had made an end, he said that
my education and habits had not been exactly of
the right kind, to fit me for the duties which he
should put upon me, if he were to engage me as
his clerk. But as they were very simple, and required
nothing so much as industry and punctuality,
he thought I might discharge them to his satisfaction,
if I chose to devote my whole time to
them.</p>

<p>I assured him that I would not only devote all
my time to his service, but that I would make use of
all the energy of which I was master, to qualify
myself for the duties which he might require of me.</p>

<p>He said that his two partners, and each of the
clerks in his employ, had their respective duties to
perform, and he wanted a clerk to attend to his
own private affairs, and when necessary to assist
in the counting room. Such an employment, he
remarked, would afford me an opportunity of acquiring
a knowledge of mercantile affairs, and fit
me for some more important station. He concluded
by saying he would take me on trial for a
month, and at the end of that time, if he was satisfied
with me, and I should be willing to remain with
him, he would make a permanent engagement with
me.</p>

<p>I left the office of Mr. Marisett in an ecstacy of
pleasurable anticipations. The first time I saw him,
I felt my affections drawn out towards him. His
manners were winning and unaffected, and while
his gentleness and apparent good nature inspired
you with confidence, and led you to act without
restraint in his presence, there was a calm dignity
about him which inspired you with respect; indeed,
with me, it amounted to a feeling of awe.</p>

<p>In person, Mr. Marisett was a little under the
ordinary height; but he was very muscular, and
somewhat inclined to corpulency, although there
was not the slightest approach to grossness; his
complexion was clear and ruddy; his forehead was
high and broad, and as smooth as marble; his
hair was a rich chestnut color; he were it long and
parted on his forehead; perhaps he was vain of it;
if so, it was a most excusable vanity, for it was
truly a glory even to a head like his. But his
most remarkable feature was his mouth; you might
read his whole character in its expression, it was so
sweetly stern, so firm, so gentle. He had a peculiar
manner of compressing his lips, and casting
down his eyes, which, having once seen, you could
never forget.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>Contains the particulars of a commercial operation.</p>

</div>

<p>I ENTERED upon the duties of my new employment
the next morning, with a light heart, but, I
must acknowledge, I found them wearisome
enough at first. Copying mercantile letters is a
dull business, and I was put to nothing more
stirring the first fortnight. Mr. Marisett did not
appear to overlook my writing, but he contrived
to point out to me all the mistakes I made. As
may be supposed, I was very anxious to please
him, and so I applied myself very closely to my
duties. I sat up half the night, and wrote in my
chamber, that I might handle a pen with ease; I
read the price current every morning that I might
become familiar with the names and prices of merchandize;
I studied McCulloch's Dictionary, and
read all the old letter books in the counting-room,
through. When Mr. Garvey or Mr. Bargin
gave me any thing to do, I strove hard to do
it well, and to do it quick, and although I sometimes
made strange blunders, yet I found I grew
in favor every day. It was not long before the
routine of counting-room transactions became
perfectly familiar to me, and I wondered at my
ignorance in not having known how to do what
appeared so perfectly simple and easy.</p>

<p>Mr. Morisett's desk was under my particular
charge, and one part of my duty was to file away
all his private letters in it. One day he requested
me to look for a particular letter among some of
the old files, and while I was searching for it, I
came across one, headed in his own hand, "From
Georgiana;" the sight of the name startled we, and
the blood rushed into my face. Why should it?&mdash;There
were many Georgianas in the world.
But it was a name most dear to me, and I could
neither see it written nor hear it spoken without
emotion.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett had not only left his letters for
me to read, but he had even told me to look
over his old files, that I might become familiar
with the names of his correspondents, and
their places of residence. Why then should I
not read this letter "from Georgiana," and
satisfy myself as to who Georgiana was? I
had a burning desire to know, and I longed for
an opportunity to do so. One day when Mr.
Marisett was on change, and Mr. Garvey and Mr.
Bargin were out on some business, being alone
in the office, I took down the file which contained
the letter "from Georgiana," and having searched
it out, I was just in the act of taking it from the
bundle, when a slight noise in the outer office
caused me to turn my head, and in so doing I
caught sight of my face in a little glass which
hung opposite to me; I was startled at the guilty
expression it bore, and hurriedly replaced the file
in its pigeon-hole without looking at the letter.
"No," I said, "I will not betray the confidence
that has been placed in me." The act itself was
innocent, but the motive was evil. My face
burned with shame at the thought that I had been
guilty of the meanness of wanting to pry into the
private concerns of my benefactor. Even though
the letter had been written by Georgiana De
Lancey herself; what right had I to read it?
Clearly, none. I knew it was not a business letter
from the manner in which it was headed.</p>

<p>Some may think I was over nice, and perhaps
I was; but I felt the guilt, and by a strong effort
overcame the temptation: it was the first, and I
cannot but fear that had I yielded then, I should
at some other time have erred more seriously.</p>

<p>As it was, the letter "from Georgiana" was
sacred in my eyes, and I felt a reverence for the
bundle in which it was filed. But it caused me
many heart-burnings, and sometimes I even regarded
my employer as my rival.</p>

<p>At the expiration of my month's probation, Mr.
Marisett offered me a small salary, but told me
he would increase it at the end of the year. I
was too happy to be retained in his service upon
any conditions, to make objections to the smallness
of the salary. The kindness with which
he treated me bound my heart to him. Perhaps
it was a delusion, but I fancied he spoke to me in
a kindlier tone than he did to the other clerks, or
even to his partners. Whether he did or not, I
thought he did, and that caused me to redouble
my exertions to please him, and render myself
useful to him.</p>

<p>Had I known the character of Mr. Marisett,
the reputation which he had gained as a merchant,
and the importance of the situation which I filled,
I should never have had the boldness to apply
for it. Doubtless many were withheld from
making applications for it, out of sheer modesty;
while I, the unfittest person in the world almost,
boldly applied, and was accepted.</p>

<p>The house of Marisett &amp; Co. had been established
more than thirty years, and during that period,
it had stood unmoved through all the revolutions
which had taken place in the mercantile
world. Mr. Marisett was supposed to be immensely
rich, and such was his reputation for
shrewdness and honorable dealing, his credit,
both at home and abroad, was without limits. He
had had many partners, all of whom had retired
from the concern with fortunes. His present partners,
Mr. Garvey and Mr. Bargin, had both been
clerks in his employ, and although their characters
were as unlike as their persons, their services were
alike valuable. Mr. Garvey was the senior of
the two; his <i>forte</i> was making a bargain. If he
sold an article, he got more for it than any
one else could, and in his purchases, he always
bought a little under the market. He was noted
as being the best buyer on 'Change. Perhaps
the secret of his success was the peculiar sanctity
of his coat, and his mild and oily thees and thous,
which completely barred all suspicion of sinister
designs out of the minds of those with whom he
bargained. What man could suspect another of
mercenary or knavish feelings, who wore horn
buttons on his drab coat, and called every body
by their first names. Mr. Garvey was a Philadelphian
by birth, and he had a becoming contempt
for the vain things of this world; there was
no affectation in his plain coat, nor hypocrisy in
his sentiments. The achievements of art, the revolutions
of fashion, and even the gay trappings of
nature herself, had no allurements for him. Mr.
Garvey cared nothing for worldly trifles; his
sole aim was to make money. Mr. Bargin came
from 'down-east,' for it somehow or other happens
that you rarely meet with a New Yorker
born; what becomes of all those who are born
here, I know not. He had served a year or two
with a ship broker, when he first came to the
city, and afterwards entered the employ of Mr.
Marisett in about the same capacity, and under
similar circumstances, that I had. In course of
time he was sent to Cuba to attend to some business
for the house, and while there, he gained a
knowledge of Spanish, and on his return to New
York, Mr. Marisett took him into the firm to
supply the place of a partner who had just withdrawn.</p>

<p>His particular duty was to attend to the correspondence,
and to attend to correspondents who
might visit the city in person.</p>

<p>What the exact extent of Mr. Bargin's acquirements
in Spanish were, I had no means of
knowing; but if his conversation in that language
was as limited as it was in his own, his
studies ought not to have engrossed much of his
time; unless a question or an observation called
for a very special answer, he rarely ventured upon
any other reply than, "quite so," or "very
much so," but then he had a manner of delivering
these words, it must be confessed, which impressed
you with an idea that he had said something.
There was one other expression which he
made use of on all occasions, in season and out
of season, whenever he spoke of any person or
thing; it was always, <i>au fait</i>.</p>

<p>The cup of Mr. Bargin's ambition was filled
to the brim; he lived in Broadway, and visited
in Lafayette Place; he wore the genteelest clothes,
and read the most fashionable books; he would
as soon have gone into Chatham street for a coat,
as to have read a book which was not in the fashion;
he had a pew in a fashionable church, and
he eat no longer soup, but <i>potage</i>. Notwithstanding,
Mr. Bargin was a kind hearted gentleman,
and the more I saw of him the better I liked
him.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Garvey had never shown any
decided marks of strong affection for me, yet he
had always treated me with kindly civility; but a
circumstance occurred after I had been in the office
a few months, which drew down upon my head all
the spite which that exemplary <i>friend</i> was blessed
with; and it was no fault of his, that Mr. Marisett
did not kick me out of doors.</p>

<p>A letter was received from a correspondent in
a neighboring city, ordering a thousand barrels of
flour to be purchased, at a certain price, and Mr.
Garvey took the letter, and went on change,
where he succeeded in making the purchase, within
the limits.</p>

<p>Punctuality, promptness, and decision, were as
much a part of Mr. Garvey's existence, as were
his love of money, or his red hair; and were
merchants only machines, and men not accountable
creatures, he had been the best merchant in the
world. But as merchants are men, and as men
have consciences, he was perhaps the worst.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Garvey, as soon as he had purchased
the flour, came immediately back to the counting
room, and not finding Mr. Bargin at his desk, he
sat down at it and wrote a letter to the correspondent,
advising him that the flour had been purchased
according to his directions, and then went
out again to make some other purchases, leaving
the letter lying on Mr. Bargin's desk; and I seeing
it there, and thinking it was intended for the
mail, as it was, took a copy of it, sealed it, and
took it to the post office, together with some private
letters of Mr. Marisett's.</p>

<p>But it so happened, that when Mr. Garvey
went out, he found a packet had just arrived from
Liverpool, bringing some important news respecting
the grain market in England, which had
caused flour to advance in price a dollar a barrel.
Here was an opportunity to make an operation,
which would leave a fair margin, too good to be
lost; and Mr. Garvey did not hesitate long, but
immediately determined to keep the thousand barrels
of flour, and write word to the correspondent
that it could not be bought at his limits. When
he returned to the counting room, he found Mr.
Bargin sitting at his desk, writing letters. So he
reached him the letter which contained the order
for the flour, and told him to reply to it, that the
flour could not be purchased at the price named.</p>

<p>Mr. Garvey's thoughts were so much occupied
with the probable profits of the operation he had
just made, that he entirely forgot the letter he had
written. It was the first time his memory had
ever played him false; but the devil loves a laugh
sometimes at the expense of his own, before the
final winding up of their affairs, like an old woman,
who cannot wait for her chickens to be
hatched, before she begins to count them.</p>

<p>A very few days elapsed before the receipt of
these contradictory letters was acknowledged.
The confusion which was caused thereby, may be
imagined by those who are familiar with mercantile
usages. Mr. Garvey made the best apology
he could, but Mr. Marisett was deeply mortified;
it was the first transaction that had ever taken
place in connexion with his name, to which the
charge of double dealing, or unfairness, could be
attached.</p>

Mr. Garvey knew who it was that had put the
unfortunate letters into the post office, and henceforward,
I had to contend against the active exercise
of his ingenuity to get me out of the office;
but Mr. Marisett understood perfectly well the
cause of his partner's animosity to me, and all his
efforts against me were unavailing.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p>The mystery of the auspicious letter cleared up. Meet Georgiana
De Lancey at a tea-table.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD studiously avoided prying into the private
relations of Mr. Marisett, and I knew nothing
more about him than that he was a bachelor. I
was afraid to ask, or even to listen to, any thing
concerning his family affairs, lest it should turn
out that the letter "from Georgiana" had some
reference to her, whom I fondly, but foolishly,
called <i>my</i> Georgiana. It was true, there was a
great disparity in the ages of Mr. Marisett and
Miss De Lancey, but I knew that the cupidity of
parents and guardians, had often caused youth
and loveliness to be bound to old age. But I was
not long left in doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett had remained at the office unusually
late one afternoon, and when his carriage
came for him, he told me he wanted me to ride
home with him, as he had some papers which he
wanted me to copy at his house.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett's coachman wore no gold lace;
nor yellow gauntlets, like Mr. Dooitt's, but on the
contrary he was dressed very plain, although his
clothes fitted him. The carriage also was very
plain, and it bore no coat of arms, neither upon
the panels, nor embroidered upon the hammercloth.
Mr. Marisett made no pretensions to high
descent, but rested all his claims to distinction
upon his own merits. But it would have been
better for him to have followed the way of the
world, for his simple habits only gained him the
title of an aristocrat.</p>

<p>It was dark when we reached Mr. Marisett's
house, and when we alighted, he asked me to take
a cup of tea with him before I commenced writing.
Of course, I did not refuse, and very shortly after
I had entered the parlor, tea was announced, and
I followed him out into the tea-room, and took at
seat at the table.</p>

<p>There was no one at the table but Mr. Marisett,
and Mrs. Butler, the housekeeper, but I observed
there was a cup and a plate for another. I heard
alight step in the hall, the door of the tea-room
opened, and a young lady glided gently in; she
turned her face towards me. It was Georgiana
De Lancey.</p>

<p>"My niece, Miss De Lancey, Mr. Franco," said
Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>Miss De Lancey made a very slight curtesy,
scarce perceptible, and sat down at the table, opposite
to me. I had just taken a cup of tea in my
hand, and was in the act of raising it to my lips,
when she came in, but her sudden appearance
operated on my nerves like an electric shock,
and my cup and saucer slipped from my fingers,
but fortunately without scalding me.</p>

<p>I did not dare either to lift up my eyes or my
saucer again, but employed myself the remainder
of the time that I sat at the table, in picking a
piece of dry toast to pieces. Knowing that Miss
De Lancey could not but take notice of my confusion,
and feeling certain that I made a very
ridiculous appearance in her eyes, by no means
tended to allay my trepidation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Franco," said Mr. Marisett, "be so good
as to reach the cake to Miss De Lancey."</p>

<p>I made an attempt to take hold of the cake
basket, but my hand trembled so violently, I was
obliged to withdraw it.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, uncle," said Miss De Lancey,
"you know I can always take care of myself."
She smiled gently as she spoke, and
blushed deeply.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett smiled also, and the old housekeeper
pursed up her lips, and fumbled about her
keys, as if she had suddenly thought of something
of great importance, and then jumped up from
the table and whisked out of the room, and returned
again in a few minutes, the end of her nose
looking very red; she sat down, and poured out
a cup of tea for Mr. Marisett, and then bustled
out of the room again. I had the satisfaction of
thinking that she was indulging in a good hearty
laugh at my expense.</p>

<p>I was relieved from my uncomfortable situation
by Mr. Marisett, who told his niece she must
excuse us, as we had some writing to attend to.
I followed him into his private office, and when
he had given me directions about the writing, he
left me alone.</p>

<p>But I tried in vain to write; I could neither
hold a pen in my hand, nor fix my mind upon my
work. I could think of nothing but Georgiana
De Lancey, and as I recalled to mind the ludicrous
situation in which she beheld me, I felt sick
at heart. Whether to be rejoiced or cast down
at finding her the niece of my benefactor, I could
not determine; but there was one healing reflection,
I had no longer any suspicions of finding a
rival in my employer.</p>

<p>"But why should I waste a thought upon one
to whom I had never spoken but once, and then
by accident? Why should I be guilty of the
monstrous folly of indulging in the thought that I
loved one, who, I had no reason to believe, had
ever bestowed a thought upon me at all, either
for love or hate. It was probable that she had no
recollection of ever having seen me before she
met me at the tea table, and if she had, what had
I ever said or done to give her a favorable impression
of me? clearly nothing; but, on the
contrary, much to give her an unfavorable impression.
What had we in common? she was
beautiful, oh, how beautiful! and I, I could not
flatter myself with the thought that I was possessed
of even ordinary comeliness; would she
then bestow her loveliness upon my deformity?
She was the niece of the wealthy Mr. Marisett,
and I was his humble clerk; would she bestow
her wealth upon my poverty? But above all,
she was good, pious, holy; and what had I of
holiness, or even akin to goodness? Could I
hope that she would link her purity with my corruption?
What madness, what wickedness, what
worse than wickedness, what foolishness, then, to
think, for one moment, of Georgiana De Lancey,
with any other feelings than such with which we
gaze upon night's white robed queen. As well
might I pine for the lost Pleiad. As well might I
look for popular favor as the reward of virtuous
actions, or hope for any other impossible thing."</p>

<p>I thus reasoned with myself, and although I
made out a very strong case against myself, and
set forth a dozen good reasons, the least of which
was all-sufficient, why I should not love Miss De
Lancey&mdash;I still felt that I did love her, and that
most clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett came in, and finding me with my
face buried in my hands, he asked me if I felt
unwell.</p>

<p>I replied, that I felt badly, which was true
enough.</p>

<p>Whatever his thoughts might have been about
my ill feelings, he asked me no more questions,
but told me to lay aside my paper, and wait
until the next evening before I finished my writing.
I was glad enough to be relieved, and made
the best of my way back to my boarding house,
where I shut myself up in my chamber, and tormented
myself the remainder of the night, in trying
to dismiss Georgiana De Lancey from my
mind.</p>

<p>In the morning, I dressed myself with unusual
care, and thought, when my toilet was made, that
I never looked half as bad before. At night, I
rode home with Mr. Marisett again, and on entering
the parlor, I found Miss De Lancey sitting
by the fireside. I succeeded in saying, 'good evening,'
and in taking a seat without any accident;
but I felt so dreadfully embarrassed, I was at a
loss what disposition to make of my legs or my
hands. As I was not a visiter, I supposed it was
not expected of me to join in the conversation;
so I remained at a respectful distance, silently enjoying
the music of Miss De Lancey's voice, as
she replied to the playful sallies of her uncle.
She was dressed very plain, as if jealous of an
ornament, lest it should divide the attention which
her loveliness had a right wholly to claim. As I
gazed upon her, and my ear drank in the soft
tones of her voice, I wondered at my stupidity in
not having discovered before, how beautiful she
really was.</p>

<p>At the tea table I had command over myself,
and drank two cups of tea without giving Mrs.
Butler occasion to leave the table once. I even
ventured to leave the table before Mr. Marisett,
and made a bow to Miss De Lancey as I went
out of the room. I went directly into the private
office, and commenced upon the writing which
Mr. Marisett had given me to do the night before,
and I wrote so steadily, that before he came in, I
had finished it.</p>

<p>He appeared well pleased with my performance,
and said he had no farther use for me
then. I took my hat, and was about to withdraw,
when he called me to him.</p>

<p>"Harry," he said, "have you got a good
boarding house?"</p>

<p>"It is a cheap one," I replied.</p>

<p>"Are you much attached to the people?"</p>

<p>"Not much," I replied; "Mrs. Mixen and her
daughters have been very kind to me."</p>

<p>"Ah, widows and their daughters are sometimes
very pleasant; it would not be at all surprising,
if you were attached to them. I was going to
propose to you to take a room in my house, as I
shall have frequent occasion for you during these
long evenings; if you choose to do so, it will save
you the price of your board, and add to your usefulness
to me. Mrs. Butler will see that you are
well taken care of, and it will be your own fault if
you do not feel yourself at home. There is my
library which you will find always open, and you
may amuse yourself there when you are at liberty."</p>

<p>If I had been asked to name the thing which
I should esteem above all others, it would have
been that I might be allowed to live under the
same roof, and eat at the same table, with Georgiana
De Lancey.</p>

<p>But I restrained my joy as well as I could, and
thanked Mr. Marisett with dissembled moderation,
for his kind offer. I told him I would consider of
the matter, and give him an answer in the morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he replied, "You are at liberty
to act as you please, and I would not have
you to make any sacrifices on my account."</p>

<p>I thanked him again for his kindness, and bade
him good night.</p>

<p>When I got into the street, I ran with all my
might, until I reached my boarding house, when
as soon as I recovered my breath, I gave my landlady
notice that I should leave her house the next
day, and proceeded immediately to pack up my
clothes, an operation which required but a short
space of time.</p>

<p>In the morning, I told Mr. Marisett, as soon as
he came down, that I had concluded to accept his
offer, and would remove my trunk to his house
immediately. I was afraid to delay a day, lest
some accident might interfere, to prevent what I
wished for so anxiously.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p>Is short, and of no great importance.</p>

</div>

<p>THE room which Mrs. Butler assigned me was
in the third story; it was better furnished, and
more commodious, than any I had ever occupied;
and the first night I lay in it, I could hardly sleep
for thinking of the great change which had taken
place in my condition. What a variety of lodging
places I had slept in during the past few
months. The forecastle of a ship; the unsheltered
pampas of South America; the berth deck
of a man of war; the topmost pigeon hole of a
genteel boarding house; a bench on the Battery;
the marble stairs of the University; and now I
was sleeping, or rather should be sleeping, beneath
the same roof with Georgiana De Lancey!
I dared not trust myself to anticipate what the next
few months might bring forth.</p>

<p>As Mr. Marisett's house was a long way up
town, I was obliged to take my dinner at an eating
house, and there being a young gentleman in
the counting room, to whom all the clerks appealed
for information, in all matters relating to high life
and the fashions, I got him to recommend me to a
fashionable restaurateur, for I was anxious to
avoid all the places where I should be likely to
meet any of my former associates and acquaintances,
for I had taken at great dislike to drummers,
and speculators, and even to poets. I meant, if
possible, henceforth to associate with none but
respectable people.</p>

<p>Mr. Wycks, that was the name of the fashionable
clerk, said he would introduce me, with a
great deal of pleasure, to a first-rate establishment,
kept on the Parisian plan, which he patronised
himself. This was an eating-house in the neighborhood
of Wall street, kept by two yellow gentlemen,
who chose to call themselves "Smith, Brothers."
Their gentility was beyond dispute, for
one had been at servant in the family of a French
importer, and the other had been second steward
on board of a Havre packet. The red and yellow
window curtains, the dirty gliding about the
eating-room, the greasy wall, the marble top tables,
and the bill of fare, constituted its claim to
the title of Parisian; but if these were insufficient,
the fare and the prices fully established its claim
to this distinction. After I had eaten my dinner,
I put the bill of fare in my pocket. I will give a
copy of it for the benefit of those who may be
ambitious to live genteely, and who may have the
means, but lack the art. Here it is:</p>

resemblance to beef and potatoes.</p>

<p>I was convinced from the observations which
I made in this genteel eating-house, and in some
other places of equal pretensions, that to be genteel
was to be thoroughly vulgar. So I very
shortly withdrew my patronage from the "Brothers
Smith," and having found out a quiet little nook,
kept by a widow, whose only daughter waited
upon the customers, I got my dinner there, and
had the satisfaction of eating my food well-cooked,
and of hearing it called by its right name.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>Georgiana's Conversion.</p>

</div>

<p>A FORTNIGHT had passed away since I had
been an inmate of Mr. Marisetts house, and although
I had sat opposite to Miss De Lancey at
table, twice a day, I had not exchanged a word
with her. Indeed, I hardly dared to look towards
her, and yet I felt that my admiration of her increased
every day; and every time I saw her, she
appeared lovelier than when I saw her before.
If I heard her foot upon the stairs, or in the hall,
as she tripped lightly by the door, it made the
blood rush impetuously through my veins, and
when she spoke, the sound of her voice thrilled
through my whole frame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler, the housekeeper, had an only son
at sea, and for his sake she paid me a thousand
little attentions, which I had been a stranger to
since I left my own home. Whenever she found
me alone, she would sit and talk about her "dear
boy," her "poor child," while the tears ran down
her cheeks, and she would tell me how much I
resembled him, and how happy she would be if
she could see him but for one minute, only one
minute, just long enough to kiss him, and bless
him.</p>

<p>One evening I was writing in Mr. Marisett's
private office alone, the door opened softly, and
Mrs. Butler walked in.</p>

<p>"Do you hear the wind, Mr. Franco?" she
asked, "hark! how the rain beats against the
windows. O my poor boy!"</p>

<p>"My dear madam," I said, "have you any
reason to believe that your son is on the coast?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where he is," she replied,
sobbing, "but he is at sea, and I never hear the
wind, but I think he is exposed to it, and every
blast goes right to my heart."</p>

<p>"But my good Mrs. Butler," I replied, "perhaps
at this moment your son is sailing over a sea
scarcely rippled by the wind, and beneath a sky
as blue and as bright as, as, Miss De Lancey's
eyes."</p>

<p>I spoke before I was aware, and blushed as the
words escaped my lips. But Mrs. Butler's
thoughts were suddenly diverted from her son
by my answer.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "her eyes <i>are</i> blue and bright."</p>

<p>I sighed involuntarily.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and exclaimed. "Take
care."</p>

<p>"However," I said, "her eyes may be black, or
gray, for aught that I know; she never looks at
me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she don't?" said Mrs. Butler, in a
tone meant to imply, perhaps she does. "Poor
girl!" continued Mrs. Butler, "she never hears
the wind blow, I dare say, without a beating
heart."</p>

<p>"What, has she a friend at sea?" I asked,
while a jealous pang shot through my heart.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," replied Mrs. Butler; "her father
was lost at sea, and her mother died in consequence,
of a broken heart. But Miss Georgy is
well enough off. She has got enough to make
herself independent, and anybody who may be
lucky enough to get her, besides."</p>

<p>"Miss De Lancey is a very serious young lady,
is she not?"</p>

<p>"O, very. But she was not always so. Once
she was quite gay, but soon after she came from
boarding school, she got religion, and since then,
she has been very serious. I don't know how it
happens, but young people didn't have a concern
of mind when I was a young lady, as often as
they do now. And yet I do know how it happened
with Miss Georgy, too; and I must say, it
was the strangest way of being converted, I ever
heard of in my born days."</p>

<p>"Indeed! and how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"It happened thus. Her uncle is very fond of
pictures, so much so, that he paid enough for one
old painting, to make me comfortable for life.
Well, there is young artist in the city, whose
pictures pleased Mr. Marisett so much, that he
gave him an order to paint a picture of a certain
size, to be hung up in a particular spot in the parlor,
which was left vacant, for you have observed
that there is not now a vacant spot left."</p>

<p>"Yes, I had observed that the walls are well
covered, or rather that they are all covered."</p>

<p>"You needn't have corrected yourself, for you
must acknowledge they are well covered. But to
proceed, Mr. Marisett not only gave the painter
the choice of a subject, but he allowed him to name
his own price for the picture when it was finished.
When it was brought home and hung up, the
dear, good man, was so well pleased with it, he
made the painter a present of a beautiful gold
watch, besides paying him the price agreed upon."</p>

<p>"Which picture is it?" I asked; for I had
been particularly struck with a holy family, which
hung in a conspicuous place in the parlor.</p>

<p>"It is the large picture facing the hall door as
you enter the parlor," replied Mrs. Butler.</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"Did you? Isn't it lovely! It represents the
infant Savior lying on a bed, while the mother lifts
up the covering to show him to the young baptist,
who is kneeling at his feet. What a wonderful
expression there is in the full black eye of the little
John. Such tenderness, such grief, such intelligence!
And yet you only catch a glimpse of it
too; it is not turned full upon you. What a
wonderful art, that can give a little daub of blueish
paint the power to break up the frozen fountain of
tears in a living creatures breast. And the little
sufferer's feet have been wounded by the hard
sand in the desert; and his tender back has been
scorched by the hot sun; the hairy girdle about
his loins, too, did you ever see any thing like it
before; the hairs stick out from the canvass, the
light glistens among them, and I always fancy I
see them move when a draught of wind sweeps
over the pictures. The poor little dear has fed
upon locust and wild honey; you can see it in his
looks. I never look upon it but I think of my
poor Charles, who is at sea, poor soul. Ah!
did you hear that gust of wind?"</p>

<p>"It was only a slight pull. But what connexion
was there between this beautiful picture, and
Miss De Lancey's conversion?"</p>

<p>"O, I quite forgot what I commenced talking
about," said Mrs. Butler. "Why, Miss Georgia
was affected by the picture, more sensibly than
any one else. She was fond of reading, and having
no companion of her own age, she was a
good deal alone, and much of her time she spent
in the parlor. One day, I went in suddenly, and
there I found her on her knees before the picture,
with the tears streaming from her eyes, and the
Bible open at her side. Why, Miss Georgiana, I
said, what in the world is the matter with you?
'O! Mrs. Butler,' she said, 'I am so wicked,
I cannot help it.' My dear child, I replied, how
can you talk so. Your uncle would be highly offended,
if he were to hear you say such dreadful
things of yourself. Do, my love, hush up, it is awful.
'My uncle is not my judge,' she said, still
sobbing, and raising her eyes to the picture.
Soon after this, she commenced going to the chapel,
and in course of time, she was admitted to
the communion; she has continued very constant
in her attendance at her meeting, and there is no
end to what she does for the poor. I do think, if
ever there was a real christian, Miss Georgy is
one."</p>

<p>"Did her uncle oppose her joining the chapel?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Marisett, you know, is the loveliest
man in the world; isn't he a perfect gentleman?
Of course he approves of every thing that is just
and proper; but he was very proud of Georgiana,
she was his only sister's only child, and she
was highly accomplished; he did say to me, in
confidence, that he thought it was a great pity for
her to join any society that would in a measure
prevent her accomplishments from being seen;
however, he says, Mrs. Butler, there is nothing becomes
a woman, after all, half so well as piety."</p>

<p>"And I think so too;" I said, for I could not
but remember how surpassingly beautiful Georgiana
had appeared to me, when kneeling in
prayer, by the side of the sick woman's bed in the
Five Points.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Mrs. Butler, slowly, "it is
quite interesting. But young ladies were not so
presuming in such matters when I was a young
lady, as they are now."</p>

<p>Just at this moment, a carriage stopped in front
of the house, and Mrs. Butler bustled out of the
office, and left me alone to my thoughts.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>Love and Religion.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next Sabbath, after the conversation with
Mrs. Butler, related in the last chapter, I went in
the morning to the chapel where Miss De Lancey
worshipped. It may be supposed, very justly,
that my only object in going, was to see her. I
had not been in a church of any kind, excepting
the Cathedral at Buenos Ayres, since I left my
native village. And old Doctor Slospoken, our
domine at home, who had regularly put his congregation
to sleep every morning, for almost half
a century, was the sole idea of a preacher in my
mind.</p>

<p>The officiating minister at this place, gave me
a new idea of a preacher, if he did nothing more.
He allowed no one to close an eye, who sat under
the droppings of his voice. He was a tall spare
man, with high cheek bones, gray eyes, large and
protuberant, a high broad forehead, a mouth remarkably
expressive of firmness, and peculiar
from the upper teeth projecting very much over the
lower ones. His manner was very startling, at
least it was to me, and yet there was neither rant nor
affectation about him; but his voice was soft and
clear, although his words were harsh; his statements
were so plain, and there was such a positiveness
in his assertions, that it was impossible to
hear him without becoming somewhat interested in
what he was saying. However, I did not go to
be preached to; I had another object in view, and
having sought her out, the preacher's words
fell on a deaf ear.</p>

<p>Georgiana appeared to listen with great attention
to the preacher, and during the prayer she
meekly bowed her head. It was enough for me
that she was there; the preacher, the place, and
the people, were all sanctified by her presence, and
made holy. When the plate was handed round,
I put into it all the money I had in my pocket,
and would very freely have given more if I could.</p>

<p>When the sermon was closed, and the benediction
pronounced, the minister requested all the
church, and such of the congregation as were disposed,
to assemble in the lecture room adjoining
the chapel. As Georgiana went in, I waited until
all had gone in who seemed disposed, and then I
entered myself, and took a seat near the door.</p>

<p>It was a dull cold day, and a mixture of snow
and hail was falling; the wind was high, and it
beat against the windows of the room in which we
were assembled, and howled in the open court in
front. The ceiling of the room was low, and the
walls were dusky with smoke; the windows were
few and small, and the glass being covered with
frost, they admitted but little light; a large black
stove in the centre of the lecture room sent forth
more smoke than heat, and added by its cheerless
aspect to the uncomfortable and dreary appearance
of the room, and every thing in it.</p>

<p>The assemblage was large, and for a short
time there was a dead silence, broken only by an
occasional groan, or at long drawn sigh.</p>

<p>Presently, the minister stood up behind a plain,
unpainted desk, and looked upon the people with
a severe frown. It was not an easy matter for a
stranger to decide whether it was pity or contempt,
which caused him to knit his eyebrows together,
and compress his lips as though some
mighty truth was struggling for an outlet.</p>

"I have called you together," he said, after a
long pause, "for the express purpose of keeping
you from your dinners, and I trust I shall succeed
in thawing out some of your icy hearts."</p>

<p>Having explained to his church the benevolent
feelings which had caused him to call them together,
he turned to a middle aged man, who sat
near, and told him to pray. The man did as he
was told, and knelt down, and prayed very loud,
and very long; but he did not appear to give entire
satisfaction to the pastor, who kept nudging
and whispering in the ear of the suppliant, "pray;
why don't you pray, brother Jones, <i>pray</i>! PRAY!"
Brother Jones increased the loudness of his voice
at each nudge of his pastor, but to little purpose;
for he had no sooner pronounced amen, than his
spiritual leader jumped up, and reproved him for
not praying with more spirit; "such a prayer as
that," he said, "is no prayer at all, but a mere
mockery." He also made some other remarks
which I do not feel disposed to repeat.</p>

<p>When he sat down, a pale young man stood up
in a dark corner of the lecture room, and after
hemming two or three times, said, in a faint, tremulous
voice, that he thought no man had a right
to criticize another's prayer; that, to his mind, it
appeared right for a man to pray to his Maker,
and not to his minister; and that if there was a
holy spot upon earth, it was that on which the
christian knelt in prayer, within the holy precints
of which no mortal should intrude. He was about
to make another remark, when the preacher interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"O, brother Smith! brother Smith! Is it possible
that <i>you</i> can throw yourself down right at
the threshold of the church, for sinners to stumble
over your body down into hell! O!"</p>

<p>The pale faced young man made no reply to
this reproof of his pastor, but knelt down and buried
his face in his pocket handkerchief. The
preacher then proceeded to call out the names of
his people, who rose as they were called; and
having received a reproof for some alleged
transgression, they sat down again, and followed
the example of brother Smith. When he called
the name of Georgiana De Lancey, the blood
tingled in my veins to hear the name of her,
whom I regarded as but little less than a divinity,
spoken with so little reverence.</p>

<p>Georgiana stood up in her place, and answered
softly, "here."</p>

<p>"Is it true, Georgiana," said the preacher,
"can it be true, that <i>you</i> said you did not want to
attend the morning prayer meeting, because it
was held at four o'clock?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Georgiana.</p>

<p>"O! O! Oh! And did you say that you
could pray in your chamber at that hour as well
as you could in the lecture room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What levity! what obduracy! what blindness
of heart!" he exclaimed, rolling up his eyes
devoutly; "your heart is harder than the nether
millstone. I shall never be able to bring about a
revival as long as there is such worldly mindedness
among us. Sit down, Georgiana. Now let
all who intend, from this hour, to renounce all the
follies and vanities of the world, kneel down,
while I pray for their souls." Nearly every one
present kneeled down, but I was rejoiced to perceive
that Georgiana kept her seat. For my own
part, I did not care to be singled out as an obdurate
sinner; so I sat down, and looked as penitent
as I could. The prayer was accompanied by
a perfect whirlwind of sighs and groans, and
when it was completed, a man with light gray
eyes, a long nose, and a brown wig, came and
sat down by my side, and whispering in my ear,
asked me if I was a christian.</p>

<p>I was at a loss for an answer to so pointed a
question, but I replied, "I hope so."</p>

<p>"What makes you hope so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, exactly."</p>

<p>"Don't know? are you an American?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I was born in America."</p>

<p>"Then if you are a christian, you have been
born into Christ's kingdom; is it so?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Come forward, then, and sit upon the anxious
seat, and have your soul prayed for."</p>

<p>I thanked him, but refused.</p>

<p>"Do come, do, only to please me, do; I am
sure you will get a hope."</p>

<p>But I persisted in my refusal, and he left me,
and commenced operations upon a little boy who
was soon prevailed upon to make a seat upon the
anxious bench.</p>

<p>After another prayer and another exhortation,
the pastor very considerately let his people go home,
probably highly satisfied with the reflection, that
their dinner would be either spoiled or cold, if
they got any at all.</p>

<p>The sleet which had fallen was frozen hard,
and the steps of the chapel and the side-walk in
the street, was slippery as glass. I stood at the
door of the lecture-room, and when Georgiana
came out I offered her my arm. She could not
refuse it, for it would have been impossible for her
to have walked alone without falling, and she would
not allow the carriage to be sent for her on a Sunday.
It was the happiest moment of my life when
I felt her hand resting on my arm, and I blessed
the hard-hearted pastor for gaining me this happiness
by keeping his people from their dinners.</p>

<p>As the distance from home was long, and the
walking slippery, Georgiana had frequent occasion
to cling with both hands to my arm for support;
and notwithstanding her seriousness when
we left the chapel, she laughed outright two or
three times before we reached home. But whenever
either of us made a misstep, she would take
occasion to remark, that we all stood upon slippery
places, and unless we leaned upon the outstretched
arm of one who was mighty to save, we
should be sure to fall and perish.</p>

<p>The wind was piercing cold, but I felt it not;
a warm and thrilling delight pervaded my whole
frame. When we reached home, we found Mr.
Marisett dozing in the parlor, and Mrs. Butler in
the dining room with some dinner kept nice and
warm for us by the grate.</p>

<p>Georgiana retired, for a few minutes, to her
chamber, and when she returned, we sat down to
the dinner table together, Mrs. Butler sitting by
the fire. But I could scarce swallow a mouthful,
and Miss De Lancey eat very sparingly.</p>

<p>I have remarked before that every time I saw
Miss De Lancey, she appeared lovelier than before;
and at this time she did appear more exceedingly
beautiful than ever; whether it was
owing to the peculiar dress which she wore, to
the exercise she had taken in the keen air, or to
my own excited feelings, I know not; but her eyes
beamed with a deeper blue, her cheeks appeared
more ruddy, and her hair of a more golden hue;
even her voice sounded more musical, and her
movements were more graceful than ever. As
soon as she had finished her dinner, she retired
into the parlor, and left me sitting at the table.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Franco," said Mrs. Butler, "why
didn't you wait on Miss Georgy into the parlor?"</p>

<p>"Would it have been proper, Mrs. Butler?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Proper! I am surprised at you; to be sure it
would."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, I hope she will not think me
very unmannerly."</p>

<p>"She will forgive you, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" I said sighing.</p>

<p>"I guess you would think so too, if you knew
all that I know. But a still tongue is a wise one."
And so saying Mrs. Butler sailed out of the dining
room, leaving me to conjecture as many delightful
things as I chose, and to magnify to the extent
of its capability the share of bliss which had already
fallen to me lot.<p>

<p>The next day I dined at home; it was an unusual
occurrence, and I deemed it a good omen.
I sat opposite to Georgiana, and felt unspeakably
happy.</p>

<p>"How does it happen, Mrs. Butler," said Mr.
Marisett, "that you never give us any apple
dumplings? It is a long time since I have seen
any on the table."</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler made no reply, but I observed she
colored slightly, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Eh, Mrs. Butler," continued Mr. Marisett;
"are apple dumplings out of Fashion, or how
is it."</p>

<p>"My poor Charles," said Mrs. Butler, wiping
the tears from her eyes, "was always so fond of
dumplings, I can never endure to see them while
he is away, poor boy! I could not sit at table
where they were, without thinking of him. It is
very silly of me, but I hope you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"Well, well, say no more about it," replied Mr.
Marisett, "but when your Charles comes home,
which I hope may be soon, we will then be treated
to some dumplings."</p>

<p>That evening, the kind old lady came into the
office where I was writing alone, and as usual, began
to talk about her son, her dear boy. She knew
I had been a sailor, and she wanted in ask me if
there was any probability of her darling child
ever getting any of his favorite dumplings at sea.
I told her I had never seen them served up on ship
board myself, but that plumb puddings were very
common, and I had no doubt her son Charles got
his fill of that luxury, at least once a week. This
piece of information seemed to give the good old
lady great satisfaction.</p>

<p>As usual, when she spoke of her absent boy,
she was very communicative, and I thought she
would never cease. And from speaking of him,
she very naturally branched off into the subject of
his father, her first husband. "Ah!" she exclaimed,
"there never was such a man as poor,
dear Captain Bowhorn."</p>

<p>"Captain Bowhorn, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my husband, my first husband. I dare
say you have heard of him, for he was beloved
by every body."</p>

<p>"I once had a shipmate named Bowhorn, but
he was quite young. I thought he might have
been a relation of yours. His name was Jeremiah."</p>

<p>"Why, that is my child's name," almost
shrieked out the old lady, "His name is Charles
Jeremiah."</p>

<p>Sure enough, a few more questions and answers,
established the fact very clearly, that Mrs.
Butler's darling Charles, and my old shipmate
Jerry, were one and the same person.</p>

<p>The joy of the old housekeeper, when she
found I had actually sailed in the same ship with
her boy, was unbounded. She hung upon my
neck, and wept aloud; she kissed me again and
again, and laughed and wept by turns. And I
was scarcely less affected, for Jerry had been my
best friend, and the last act of kindness he had
shown me, had enabled me to obtain the situation
which I now held. I was rejoiced to have an opportunity
of repaying his kindness to me, by attentions
to his mother.</p>

<p>From this time forth, my prospects brightened.
Every indication in my favor which the old housekeeper
perceived, either in Mr. Marisett or his
niece, was faithfully reported to me, and I have
every reason to believe, that she was not backward
in speaking well of me to them. Many
months did not elapse, before Georgiana knew that
I loved her, and I knew that she loved me; although
we had neither spoken a word of love to
the other. The sympathies which attract souls,
made in the beginning for each other, are secret;
they do not shew themselves by corresponding actions
in those they affect, and often they only
know of their existence, who are affected by them.
It was so with us.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>Encounter my Cousin at a party.</p>

</div>

<p>TIME flew past me now on purple wings, or
rather he bore me with him through a sunny sky.
Each day, and each hour, brought with it some
peculiar pleasure. I was constantly receiving
some now proof of confidence from Mr. Marisett,
and some new evidence of kindly regard from
Georgiana De Lancey. My duties in the counting
room had become so familiar, that their performances
ceased to be either irksome or laborious.
At home, so I called Mr. Marisett's house,
Mrs. Butler was untiring in her endeavors to add
to my comforts by innumerable little attentions,
which women only can bestow.</p>

<p>I had studiously avoided all public places, and
even shunned Broadway, from fear of encountering
my cousin. It is true, my condition was immensely
bettered since I saw him last, but still I
was only a humble clerk, and while I felt conscious
of being in a station inferior to him, I
could not exult in his presence. The thought of
bursting upon his envious sight with the all-lovely
Georgiana leaning upon my arm, was intoxicating
to my senses; the bare idea made me reel and
stagger with excessive delight; it was a happiness
too great even for reflection. I could not dwell
upon it.</p>

<p>It happened about this time that a distant relation
of Mr. Marisett's, Mrs. Brown, the wife of one
of the firm of Brown &amp; Smith, cotton brokers,
gave a large party, and very much to my surprise
I received a card, for I had never seen the lady. It
was the first invitation I had ever received in my
life to a party, and I was quite beside myself with
joy, for Georgiana was to be there. I was wholly
unprepared for the event, and the first thing I did
was to purchase a bottle of Cologne water, and a
box of bear's grease; the next was to consult
with Jack Gauntlet, the fashionable young gentleman
in the counting-room of Marisett &amp; Co.,
about the particular costume proper for such an
occasion, and according to his directions, I furnished
myself with a pair of morocco pumps, and
black silk stockings, a white cravat, and a linen
cambric pocket handkerchief; my wardrobe was
already supplied with the other requisites. Jack
said there would be no dancing, because Mr.
Brown was pious, but that there would be any
quantity of thrumming on the piano, and scandal
by the wholesale, besides sugar kisses, and phillippinas.</p>

<p>The cards were sent round almost a week before
the party took place; it was for Thursday
night, and I thought it would never come; but
one after the other, Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday, hobbled away, and the sun of&mdash;of
Thursday&mdash;set at last. I dressed myself early, and
that I might be sure of being neither too soon nor
too late, I stationed myself on the opposite side
of the street, a few doors from Mr. Brown's house,
and when I thought that about one half the guests
had arrived, I crossed over, and hustled up the
steps, as though I had come in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Georgiana went early in the afternoon, by particular
request from Mrs. Brown. I forgot to
mention that Mrs. Butler, observing the uncommon
pains I was at in dressing myself, offered to
loan me her broach; it was ornamented with her
first husband's initials in front, and a lock of his
hair on the back, very curiously worked to represent
a weeping willow, but I declined wearing a
gem of such value, as it could not be replaced if
I lost it, and she, I dare any, was glad that I refused
it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown's house was brilliantly illuminated
with a sperm candle in each side light, and two
in the fan light over the door. I pulled the bell,
and the door was instantly opened by a tall black
man, in a white apron, who took my cloak and
hat, and left me to make what disposition of myself
I chose. There were two or three young
men standing in the hall, apparently waiting for
some one possessed of more courage than themselves
to lead the way into the parlor; the door
stood a-jar, and I boldly pushed it open and walked
in, leaving it to chance to direct my footsteps.
But my heart beat terribly, notwithstanding, although
I had an idea that the secret of good
manners was to appear perfectly unconcerned,
and to speak civilly to any one near me. I knew
Mr. Brown, and I cast my eyes round upon the
company assembled, with the hope of seeing him,
but he caught sight of me before I saw him, and
very kindly took me by the arm, and walked me
through the folding doors, and introduced me to
Mrs. Brown, who, after a moment's conversation,
took my arm, and introduced me to Miss Green,
a very tall young lady, dressed in white satin, and
with a large bunch of cammelias in her hand. As
there was a vacant chair by her side, I sat down,
anticipating a taste of the scandal which Jack
Gauntlet had prepared me for. I looked over to
the opposite side of the room, and there sat Georgiana
De Lancey and my cousin by her side, in
close conversation with her. I immediately
turned my head as if I had not observed them,
and made an attempt to speak to Miss Green, but
for the life of me, I could not open my lips. She
appeared very anxious for me to say something,
and smiled in anticipation of what I might utter.
But in spite of my having previously arranged in
my mind a very smart speech, in case I should be
introduced to a young lady, I could not command
a word. So I offered my arm to Miss Green, and
asked her to promenade round the room; she
caught it with eagerness, as though she considered
me a windfall; and well she might, for she was
tall, and yellow, and thin, and she had contrived,
with a strange perversity of taste, to dress herself
in such a manner as to magnify all her blemishes.
But had she been beautiful as the Paphian queen,
or any other beauty who never had an existence,
it would have been all the same to me. I was so
overcome at seeing my cousin seated by the side
of Georgiana, that I had no eyes for any thing
beside. I felt sick and dizzy; I could see nothing
distinctly, and a strange sound was buzzing in my
ears. Fortune seemed to make use of me expressly
as a set-off to my cousin; whenever I met
him I was sure to suffer by comparison with him.
As I passed through the folding doors with the
tall Miss Green clinging to my arm, I could not
help turning my head to look at him, when my
eye met his, and I quickly averted it. I fancied
there was a sneer upon his lip, and that Georgiana
was smiling at something he had said. Perhaps
it was some contemptuous remark about me. I
grew faint at the thought. The simperings of
Miss Green sounded in my ear like dismal howlings.
By some man&oelig;uvre, I know not how, I got
away from my long companion, and succeeded in
reaching the piazza at the back of the house; the
night air was cold, and I soon revived; but my
feelings were too much excited, to allow of my
reappearing in the parlor. So I took my hat and
cloak, and hurried back to my chamber.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>Letters from Home.</p>

</div>

<p>LET not the reader think. because I have so
long omitted to make mention of my parents, that
I had forgotten them. Not so; my affection for
them and my sister was undiminished.</p>

<p>As soon as I made an engagement with Mr.
Marisett, I wrote to my father, informing him of
the change in my prospects, and by return of
mail, I received the three following letters:</p>

<div id="center">

(<i>From my father.</i>)

</div>

<p>"MY DEAR BOY,</p>

<p>"I was happy to hear from you again, and
to learn that you had obtained a situation to your
mind. I hope you will so conduct yourself in it
as to merit the approbation of your employer. I
know the house of Marisett well; I had dealings
with them before the embargo.</p>

<p>"From the great length of time which had elapsed
since you left home, without our having heard
a word about you, your mother began to grow
very uneasy on your account, although I told
her it was extremely indecorous in her, and assured
her that I had no doubt you were doing
well, and that we should see you some time or
other.</p>

<p>"Your cousin, I hear, has been fortunate in his
speculations; he is a great credit to his parents;
he is a fine gentlemanly fellow, and as you will
probably meet him in New York, I hope you will
try to model yourself after him. Your mother
and sister, I suppose, will urge you to come
home, but you know that business must be attended
to. Don't make any sacrifices for the
sake of coming home. Many of your young acquaintances
have been married, some have died,
and all are doing well.</p>

<p>"Enclosed I send you a small draft, which you
are at liberty to use according to your discretion.
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"H. FRANCO."</p>

<p>My yearning affections shrunk within me as I
read my father's letter. His allusions to my
cousin made the blood boil within me, and I vowed
to myself never to return home until my prospects
were at least equal to his. I could not
think that my father intended to taunt me with
my cousin's superiority; but in effect he did so,
and I could hardly refrain from tearing his letter
to pieces. The draft enclosed was the most incomprehensible
part of the letter; it was for five
hundred dollars. By what means he had procured
this amount of money, I could not imagine.</p>

<p>The letter from my mother was as follows:</p>

<p>"DEAR, DEAR HARRY,</p>

<p>"Is it true that my dear boy is alive and
well! O, Harry, I have read your letter over and
over; and your poor sister has read it, and cried
over it, and prayed over it. I put it under my
pillow when I lay down at night, that I may be
able to press it to my lips when I wake in the
morning. Your father tells me it is weak in me
to do so, but it is a weakness caused by the
strength of my love for you. O, Harry, my dear
boy, I have had such dreams about you! but
they were only dreams, and I will not distress you
by relating them. Let us give thanks to our
heavenly Father for all his mercies. When we
received your letter, it was my wish to return
thanks publicly through Doctor Slospoken; but
your father would not give his consent. What
the neighbors all thought, I cannot say. But my
dear Harry, why did you not come home? to
your own home? Do not think, my dear child,
that you will be more welcome to your home and
your mother's heart, if you bring the wealth of
the Indies with you. If you be covered with
jewels your mother will not see them, and if you
be clothed in rags, she will only see her child.</p>

<p>"From your affectionate mother,</p>

<p>"S. FRANCO.</p>

<p>"P. S. Enclosed is a ten dollar bill; it is all
the money I have now; your father tells me he
has sent you more.</p>

<p>"Once more good bye; and that our heavenly
Father may bless you, is the heartfelt prayer of
my dear son's affectionate mother,</p>

<p>"S. F.</p>

<p>"N. B. Come home immediately."</p>

<p>The other letter was from my sister; it read
thus:</p>

<p>"MY DEAR BROTHER,</p>

<p>"Your letter has made us all happy; how
happy I cannot express; for we had mourned for
you as one that was dead. I cannot, in a letter,
relate to you all that has been said and done since
we heard from you; but you may be assured we
have been almost beside ourselves with joy, and
all our talk has been, Harry, Harry, Harry.</p>

<p>"There have been great changes in our village
since you left. There have been great speculations
going on, and father has been offered a great
price for our garden, which has been laid out into
building lots, with a street running right
through my flower beds, which is to be called
Franco avenue. There are no houses built upon
the street yet, but the ground plan has been most
beautifully lithographed, and hung up in our parlor,
in a gilt frame. Our house is newly painted,
and is to be called the mansion house; a company
have agreed to purchase it, and convert in into a
hotel. They have already paid fifty dollars to
make the bargain binding. Father can get as
much money as he wants from a new bank which
has been set up here. Every body has grown
rich, and our cousin, they say, has made a splendid
fortune in New York, by selling his father's
orchard for building lots. He cuts a great dash
when he comes home, but I am certain that you,
dear brother, will outshine him, when you come
home, which I hope will be soon. Don't disappoint
us, and do let us know when we may expect
you.</p>

<p>"From your affectionate sister,

<p>"MARY FRANCO.</p>

<p>"P. S. I have promised you to a young lady
whose father has just made a large fortune."</p>

<p>How cold, cheerless, and benumbing is the affection
of a man, even though he be your father,
when contrasted with the warm, pure, and overflowing
affections of a woman. The letters of
my mother and sister were balmy to my soul;
they contained expressions which I could treasure
up in my heart. But my sister's letter was
full of pleasant news which excited my hopes to
the highest degree. The mansion house and
Franco street sounded very well, and I repeated
them over a dozen times. The allusions to my
cousin gave additional strength to my ambition
to excel him. He had received his property from
his father, but I had thus far received no assistance
from mine, and it would be a proud boast
if I could succeed in raising myself to a level
with him, by my own exertions. I resolved to
try; and if I should ever succeed in gaining the
hand of Georgiana De Lancey, on what an exalted
eminence would the possession of her alone
place me; how proudly I could then look down
on my cousin, and with what feelings of envy
would he regard one whom he had pretended to
despise.</p>

<p>Thoughts like these haunted me continually;
they nerved me to persevere in my duties, and
solaced me when I was weary or dejected.</p>

<p>The first interruption to my bright dreams, was
that which occurred at Mrs. Brown's party.
When I went home, I met Mrs. Butler in the hall;
she was surprised at seeing me return so soon. I
told her I felt unwell.</p>

<p>"Dear soul," said the good woman, "let me
warm your bed, and give you some boneset tea."</p>

<p>I thanked her for her kindness, but refused it.
My malady was not one that could be affected by
a warming pan, nor by that best of all herbs,
boneset. I went up to my chamber and spent the
remainder of the night in tossing upon the bed,
striving in vain to dispel the apparition of Georgiana
De Lancey, with my cousin seated by her
side.</p>

<p>In the morning Mrs. Butler told me that when
Georgiana came home, she asked particularly
about me, and that she appeared alarmed when
she heard I was unwell. This intelligence revived
me; to know that Georgiana had expressed
any anxiety on my account, made my heart leap
with pleasure. I went down to the counting-room,
feeling happier than I ever felt before.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>A Crisis. Making love.</p>

</div>

<p>GEORGIANA was punctual in the observance of
all her religious duties, and constant in her attendance
at the chapel, and I never failed to accompany
her there whenever I was at liberty. But
the oftener I went there, the more I disliked the
place. At first, it was hallowed, in my estimation,
by her presence, but as the religious meetings
which she attended engrossed so much of her time,
I began to fear that they would estrange her from
me altogether. I hated them heartily, and my
aversion increased, because I was obliged to keep
it within my own bosom; I was afraid to discover
it either by words or actions, for fear of offending
her.</p>

<p>One evening I was startled by seeing my cousin
at a prayer meeting; he sat directly in front of
Georgiana, where she could not but observe him,
and he joined in all the exercises with seeming devotion.
I could not but regard him with feelings
of disgust, for I knew his sole purpose was to attract
the attention of Georgiana. Ever after, he
was sure to make his appearance whenever she was
present at a meeting.</p>

<p>My cousin was handsome in his person, and
pleasing in his manners, when he wished to please,
at least so people said, but to me he appeared the
impersonation of all that was vile and hideous.
The object of his pretended sanctity could not be
mistaken, and I was dreadfully alarmed, lest he
should succeed in gaining the affections of Georgiana
by his hypocrisy. It is true, I had good
cause for believing she loved me, but she had
never told me so, nor plighted her faith to me; if
she had, I could never have felt a jealous pang.
But it was one of the peculiarities of the faith she
professed, that it was sinful for christians to be
yoked together with unbelievers, and her pastor
had publicly announced that he would in no case
unite such together in the everlasting bonds. And
knowing the purity of her mind, her devotedness
to the faith she professed, and her strong sense of
duty, I could not hope that, for my sake, she
would do violence to her conscience. I would
gladly, for her sake, have joined myself to any
society, or made a profession of any religious belief,
but I could not for a moment entertain the
thought of practising deceit towards her; and as
to any actual change taking place in my feelings,
I did not regard it within the reach of possibility.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening she was prevented by the
rain from going to meeting. I found her sitting
in the parlor with the bible open before her. Her
uncle was in his private office, where he usually
spent his Sabbath evenings; and the state of the
weather precluded the possibility of visiters; I
exulted in the hope of spending an evening uninterruptedly
with her.</p>

<p>The weather was cold&mdash;it was March&mdash;and
the fire burned bright and cheerful in the grate,
and the mellow light from a Sevres shade imparted
a rich and softened hue to every thing around.
The walls were hung with the loveliest creations
of the art of all arts, and angelic faces and limbs
of matchless beauty seemed gazing and reaching
from frames of burnished gold, like cherubim
peering through a halo of glory. Georgiana
herself was a picture of living beauty, showing
forth more of grace and loveliness than any of
the fair faces which seemed to look down upon
her as if enamored of her charms.</p>

<p>I sat down by the little table on which her bible
was placed, and was greeted by her with a
smile and a blush.</p>

<p>"O! Mr. Franco," she said, after a short
pause, "do you know what high and holy
pleasure we are capable of receiving from this
blessed book?"</p>

<p>"I know," I replied, "that it is capable of
giving high and holy pleasure, or Miss De Lancey
would not choose it so often for a companion;
and I am willing to believe that the fault is in me,
and not in the book, that I do not receive pleasure
from reading it."</p>

<p>"And do you not, indeed?" said she earnestly,
and looking up into my face with her full blue
eyes. "And yet why should I wonder that you
do not; once it gave no pleasure to me."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder," I said, "that those who
profess to make the bible the rule of their conduct
should, from a sense of duty, diligently
search in it for the principles by which they think
their lives should be governed; but I am compelled,
in honest candor, to acknowledge, I cannot
understand how the bible can impart the delight
of which you and others speak."</p>

<p>"Now, it is strange," said Georgiana, "very
strange; but when you came in, I was striving
to look into my own heart, to examine if it were
not for some cause other than love for the truth
itself, which led me to consult this precious book
so often. Indeed, I have often wished that the
truths which it contains were embodied in a homelier
and sterner form, that the sincerity of my
love might be more surely tried."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I said, "Miss De Lancey, if you
were to read to me some of those enticing passages,
I too might be affected by them; for I am
not willing to acknowledge myself incapable of
receiving pleasure from that which pleases you."</p>

<p>"Then I should read to you every page in the
bible," she said, at the same time letting the
leaves slip through her delicate fingers.</p>

<p>"But are there not some portions which have
left a deeper impression on your heart than
others?"</p>

<p>"There are; but I cannot read them aloud. I
love to pause over them, and close my eyes, and,
sustained by faith, follow whither they may lead me.
To kneel beside the sufferer in Gethsemane; to
go with Mary, before the day dawns, and look
down into his tomb; or to hover with those bright
and honored spirits on the verge of the sky, who
sang peace and good will to man at His first appearing.
But, there are beauties which must
strike the dullest apprehension; I will not do you
wrong by believing you to be a stranger to them.
Here is one, or rather a constellation of them, so
bright and dazzling, that they can never appear
familiar to me, although I have read them a thousand
times. Shall I read it?"</p>

<p>I nodded my wish, and she read the eighteenth
Psalm. She commenced in a low and tender,
but distinct tone; but as she proceeded, she elevated
her voice, her eyes beamed with emotion,
her nostrils seemed to dilate, and her cheek and
lips assumed a deadly paleness. I was awe
struck, and when she paused, I cast down my
eyes and was silent; feeling as one may be supposed
to feel who has heard the blast from the
trumpet of an angel.</p>

<p>After a short pause, she turned over the leaves
of the bible, and read from the story of Esther;
her soft and tender voice, apparently adding
richness and beauty to the passages which she
read.</p>

<p>"Is there not an account somewhere in the bible,"
I asked, "of the sons of God having taken
wives from among the children of men?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "and the consequence was,
these children were giants in sin, monsters in iniquity,
whose misdeeds brought ruin upon the
world."</p>

<p>"And is there no account of the sons of men
taking wives from among the daughters of
God?"</p>

<p>"I have never read of it," she replied.</p>

<p>"I wish there was," I replied.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That I might hope"&mdash;I could say no more.</p>

<p>"Hope what?" said Georgiana, in a trembling
voice, and with her eyes cast down.</p>

<p>"But I cannot hope&mdash;no, there is no hope for
me." My face burned as I spoke, and my heart
beat violently. I fell upon my knees, and hiding
my face in my hands, I said, or at least tried to
say, for I am not sure I did say these words,
"My dear Miss De Lancey; forgive me; I cannot
help it; I love you better than my own
life. I cannot tell you how long and how well I
have loved. But with my whole soul I love you,
and must forever, while my soul endures."</p>

<p>Georgiana sobbed aloud, and while with one
hand she wiped the tears from her eyes, I took
the other and pressed it to my lips. She withdrew
it gently, and, emboldened by her silence, I
sat down by her side. I had unburdened my
heart of a heavy load, and I felt more at my ease.
Georgiana at length broke silence; her eyes
were swollen, and she looked very serious.</p>

<p>"It is many weary long years," she said, "or
at least they have seemed many to me, since I
wept for the loss of my parents; and since then,
I have never known what it was to lean upon
one who loved me, or to feel that there was one
in the world whose happiness depended upon mine.</p>

<p>My uncle has been very kind to me, too kind; he
has gratified me in all my wishes. But I felt it
was not love which caused his kindness. He
never restrained my inclinations; and I have an
indistinct recollection that my father used to chide
me. My uncle has kissed me often, but he never
shed a tear over me; but I remember, as distinctly
as though it were but yesterday, of feeling my
mother's warm tears drop upon my cheek, when
she has bent over me to kiss me. O! it is a desolate
world where there is none to love you."</p>

<p>Georgiana did not speak these few words without
frequent sobbings, which so touched my heart,
that when I attempted to speak, my utterance
was choked with tears. I could not articulate a
word.</p>

<p>"It is I," said Georgiana, "who must ask forgiveness
of you, Mr. Franco. I have done wrong
in allowing so close an intimacy to spring up between
us; I should have taken up my cross, and
denied myself the pleasure I have received in
your society. Were my feelings different in one
respect; or, were yours different from what I
fear they are, perhaps I might not turn away
my ear when you tell me you love me; but now
I must."</p>

<p>"My dear, dear love," I said, "my whole existence
is yours; there is no division in my affections.
I love you with all the strength and fulness
of my soul; and but to hear you say you
love me in return, I would do or endure more
than I may seem capable of; but I could not,
even for your sake, profess a feeling to which I
am a stranger, or put on the sanctity of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>"I did not wrong you by believing you could;
and for <i>my</i> sake, I would not have you strive after
that grace which can only be obtained for the sake
of Him, through whose intercession it can be
given. How often have I prayed that you might
receive it for His sake who died for you."</p>

<p>The heavy footsteps of Mr. Marisett in the
hall, warned us of his approach. Georgiana
wiped the tears from her eyes, and I seated myself
opposite to her, and looked as indifferent as
I could. She opened her bible, and commenced
reading again, as her uncle opened the parlor
door.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Georgy," he said, "you are
entertaining Mr. Franco in sober earnestness. I
hope he is satisfied with your manner of amusing
him."</p>

<p>"He has made no complaint," replied Georgiana.</p>

<p>"I dare say not," said her uncle; "you have
given him no opportunity, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"She has given me no cause," I said.</p>

<p>"Well done," said Mr. Marisett, pleasantly.
Georgiana looked steadily on the page of her
bible, while I looked earnestly at the fire. The
color of our thoughts was undoubtedly of the
same hue.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett would at times apply himself, with
a wonderful degree of intensity, to any subject
which required his attention, until he gained the
result after which he sought; and then, like a
spring which had been stretched to its utmost
tension, and suddenly let go, his thoughts seemed
to bound up and vacillate from side to side, for
half an hour or more, before his mind would settle
to its usual calmness. He had probably just risen
from some laborious mental effort, when he entered
the parlor, for he was unusually lively and
playful; and that prevented him from observing
the unusually grave demeanor of his niece. He
kissed her affectionately; and after listening to
two or three of his playful sallies, I retired to my
chamber.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p>Almost a murder.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD frequent opportunities of walking to
church, and to prayer meetings, with Georgiana;
and sometimes I accompanied her in her charitable
visits, although she usually preferred going
alone on such errands. But we were rarely together
in her uncles house. Mrs. Butler was no
stranger to our feelings, and she never interfered
when there was a prospect of our being left alone;
but my duties, or company, or some other cause,
rarely allowed me this happiness.</p>

<p>It was the settled conviction of Georgiana, that
it would be sinful in her to plight her faith to one,
whose heart had not been touched by the same
divine influences which she believed had wrought
a change in her. She quoted to me the proofs
from holy writ, on which her faith was founded;
and although I could not refute her arguments,
yet they failed to carry conviction to my mind. I
had the double mortification of feeling my inferiority
to her, and of knowing she loved me, without
the hope of ever possessing her. Truly, with
me, religion was the "one thing needful." Never,
since the cross was erected, did a man strive harder
to convert himself. I read the most powerful
and argumentative essays; I listened attentively
to the most stirring sermons, and even tried to
look pious, with the hope that a habit of body
might beget a corresponding habit of mind. Many
and earnest were the prayers which Georgiana
breathed in my behalf. But all to no purpose.
My dislike to religious things and duties increased
in proportion to the efforts that were made to overcome
it. At last, I began to look upon all religious
men, and books, and even upon the bible
itself, as united in a conspiracy to rob me of my
life's pleasure.</p>

<p>My sole hope was, that Georgiana herself
would change; that her delusion would wear
away, or be overcome by her love for me. I began
to fear that no change would be effected in me.</p>

<p>But it was no small consolation to know, that
Georgiana actually loved me, and that she refused
me, not for personal, but for spiritual reasons.
And it added not a little to this consolation, to
know, that in gaining her affections, I had achieved
a mighty triumph over my cousin. He was introduced
to her for the first time, at Mrs. Brown's
party, and fell in love with her on the spot. He
had called on her repeatedly since, but had always
been coolly received. He pretended to be engaged
in some religious enterprise, and became a
regular attendant at the chapel which Georgiana
frequented; and once, when he attempted to address
her, as she came out of the door, when the
service was over, she merely made a slight inclination
of the head, and taking my arm, we walked
quietly away, and left him to chew the cud of his
disappointment at his leisure. I took a wicked
pleasure in mortifying his pride, and I longed to
whisper in his ear the odious words which he
had planted in my memory. I cared nothing now
for his real estate, nor his money; and I knew he
envied me the situation I held, as it allowed me
free intercourse with Georgiana. I frequently
passed him in the street, but I never gave him a
look of recognition. The cause of his showing
such a wanton malice towards me, I never knew;
I was some years his junior, and I had never, until
he unprovokedly wounded my feelings, entertained
a hard thought of him; although from a
child he had sought every occasion to excite my
anger.</p>

<p>It was very seldom that my services were required
at the counting room of an evening; but
the night after that on which Georgiana had taken
my arm, as my cousin spoke to her when she came
out of the chapel, Mr. Bargin requested me to
remain, and assist in preparing the invoices and
bills of lading, for a ship belonging to Marisett
& Co., which was to sail the next morning. I
was always glad when an opportunity offered to
render myself serviceable; and on this occasion,
I remained in the counting room as long as there
was any thing to be done. It was midnight when
I left, and I had almost three miles to walk. Mr.
Marisett's house was on the north side of the city,
at the foot of one of the new streets which led down
to the Hudson. The night was cold and dark, and
I wrapped my cloak about me, and walked briskly
through the silent streets, till I got within a
block or two of the house, where the side walk
was shaded with young sycamore trees, when
a man suddenly jumped from behind one of the
casings of a tree, and caught me in his arms, and
before I could clear myself from my cloak, he
tripped up my heels, and I fell upon my back; in
my fall, my hat got jambed over my eyes, which
prevented me from seeing my assailant, and before
I had time to make an attempt at defence, I felt a
sharp instrument graze my left side. But it was
directed with such force, that, as it struck the pavement,
it slipped out of the murderer's hand, and I
caught his arm before he could regain it. I held
hard, and shouted murder with all my might. The
sound of the watchman's staff was soon heard,
and I struggled hard with the assassin, but he had
an advantage of me by being on top, and before
the watch came, he had escaped. The blood had
flown freely from my wound, and I had no sooner
told the number of the house where I lived, than I
fainted.</p>

<p>When I revived again, I found myself undressed
and in bed, and in my own chamber; Mrs. Butler
and Mr. Marisett were both at my bed-side,
and they spoke soothingly and kindly to me. It
was some time before I could call together my
scattered senses, or be made to understand what
had happened to me. It appeared that I had
received a deep cut in my left side, and in my
arm; but the doctor had pronounced the wounds
not dangerous; but I had bled profusely, and felt
extremely weak and feverish.</p>

<p>An ivory-handled bowie-knife was found by my
side by the watchman who picked me up; it was
a murderous-looking weapon, but of beautiful
workmanship; on each side of the blade was a
motto, or rather an inscription: "Short and sweet,"
on one side; "A heart-seeker," on the other. Mr.
Marisett delivered it to the officers of the police,
next morning, and offered a reward of a thousand
dollars for the apprehension of the assassin who
attacked me, and the mayor of the city offered a
reward of five hundred dollars in addition. But
he was never detected. It was evident, that the
object of the murderer was not plunder, for it was
at a time when all those gentlemen who live by
plundering their neighbors, were making money
fast enough to satisfy their desires, by speculating
in lots. Owing to the suddenness of the attack,
and the darkness of the night, I did not even catch
a glimpse of his person, and consequently I could
not furnish the slightest clue to lead to his detection.
A horrible suspicion crossed my mind, but
I would not trust it to my own thoughts. I was
conscious of having injured no one, and consoled
myself with the reflection, that I had been mistaken
for another person.</p>

<p>I was confined to my bed a fortnight, and during
that time I received many additional proofs
of regard from Mr. Marisett, and Georgiana, and
from good Mrs. Butler, who hardly left me ten
minutes at a time. Georgiana read the bible to
me every day, and prayed by my side; she improved
the peculiar circumstances in which I was
placed, by admonishing me of the uncertainty of
life, and the necessity of being always prepared
for a summons to the next world. But it was in
vain she talked, I could think of no other heaven
than that which her presence made. Had I been
called upon to worship her, I could have knelt
devoutly at her feet; but I could not dismiss her
from my mind long enough to dwell on a higher
or a purer being.</p>

<p>A few days after I had sufficiently recovered to
go down stairs, Mr. Marisett gave a small dinner
party, and as mishap had in some sort made a
little lion of me, he invited me to the table. The
guests were principally merchants, gentlemen
with whom the house of Marisett &amp; Co. had transacted
business; Mr. Bargin was present, of course,
for, as he said himself, he was <i>au fait</i> at a dinner
party: he knew exactly what to do on such an
occasion; he had not studied the fashionable novels
for nothing. The only ladies present were
Georgiana and Miss Rippletrump, a cousin of
Mr. Marisett's; she was a fine, stately-looking
woman, as matronly in her appearance as though
she had been the mother of a baker's dozen. She
made a boast, that she had passed her fortieth
year, and was not married yet. She made her
appearance on this occasion in a blue satin turban
and maraboo feathers. I have always observed,
that your bold, dashing women, are fond of a turban,
and I do not remember that I ever met with
a modest, retiring woman, with one on her head.
Georgiana was dressed with great simplicity and
neatness, and she appeared to great advantage by
the side of her dressed-up relation.</p>

<p>The finest gentleman of the party, excepting
Mr. Bargin, was Mr. De Challies, an importer of
French millinery articles. He spoke of the prices
of goods, and the prospects of trade, with
an air bordering upon grandeur. Mr. Looman, a
stockbroker, took rank next to the importer. He
was a tall, pale man, with a broken nose and a
broken voice; but those were trifles; his slender
form was ornamented with a filligree chain,
which dangled from his neck. Mr. Looman spoke
about 'dollars,' and 'operations,' and  'loans,' and
'exchanges,' and 'bills,' with such an air of superiority,
that I felt myself the meanest creature
in existence, when I remembered my own
poverty.</p>

<p>"Aw, Looman, what has become of Smith?"
said Mr. De Challies.</p>

<p>"What, the grocer, or the broker?" said Mr.
Looman.</p>

<p>"The grocer," replied Mr. De Challies.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead! Now that is very strange. Bless my
soul and body, I thought. I saw him yesterday
with a decidedly shabby vest on. Poor Smith;
he was the best judge of French brandy in Front
street."</p>

<p>"Oh! then if you saw him yesterday he can't
be dead. But he's a poor wretch."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. De Challies,
suspending his spoon midway between his plate
and his mouth.</p>

<p>"True fact, sir," replied Mr. Looman; "he
isn't worth a dollar."</p>

<p>"What, failed, and didn't save nothing for
himself?" asked a gentleman whose name I have
forgotten.</p>

<p>"The fool!" said another.</p>

<p>"Very indefatigable man, Smith," said another.</p>

<p>"Quite an ingenious man," said another.</p>

<p>"Poor stick," ejaculated another gentleman.</p>

<p>"Quite so," added Mr. Bargin, and with him
the remarks on Smith terminated. Mr. Marisett
said nothing on the subject. Mr. De Challies
took wine with Miss Rippletrump, who sat opposite
to him.</p>

<p>"That's a rich wine, madam," remarked Mr.
De Challies.</p>

<p>"Cousin usually keeps good wine, I believe,"
replied the lady.</p>

<p>"He is an importer of the article, I presume,"
said Mr. De Challies, in whose estimation an importer
outranked a mere jobber.</p>

<p>"Very probable," replied Miss Rippletrump,
with a stately toss of her turban, which made her
maraboo feathers shake again.</p>

<p>"In his own ships," said Mr. De Challies,
smacking his lips, and repeating again, "very
rich wine."</p>

<p>"Every thing is rich now-a-days," said the lady;
"for my part, I long for the good old days
when people were poor. If I only knew where
there was a poor man, woman, or child, I should
be glad. I wish, cousin Marisett, you would take
a fashionable young wife to help you spend your
money, and then I could hope some day to find a
poor relation in you."</p>

<p>"I am extremely obliged to you for your kind
wishes," replied Mr. M.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you take my advice," replied
the lady.</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated Mr. Marisett; "if women
were always women, perhaps I might. But
some have usurped the offices of men, and made
me half suspect the gentleness of the others.
Some have taken swords in their hands, and
others pens; some have gone into the pulpit,
and others have mounted the rostrum. Such women
are not for me; no, no, cousin; when I lay
my head by the side of a woman, she must be
every thing that a man is not. But come, come,
why do you not get married yourself, cousin?"</p>

<p>"If men were all men," said Miss Rippletrump,
parodying the words of Mr. Marisett,
"perhaps I might. But some have usurped the
offices of women, and made me more than suspect
the manliness of the others; some sit cross legged,
with needles in their huge fingers, and others
stand all day behind a counter, using their lusty
arms to measure out millinery; and the best do
but devote their days to no more noble objects
than hoarding money; no, no, cousin; such men
are not for me; if ever I do sacrifice myself to
a man, he must be every thing that a woman is
not."</p>

<p>Mr. De Challies and Mr. Looman and Mr. Bargin,
looked at each other with the liveliest consternation
depicted in their countenances, which
seemed to say, "did you ever?" Men could not
have manifested greater amazement by their
looks.</p>

<p>But good humor was soon restored, and the
dinner passed off very pleasantly. However,
neither Mr. De Challies nor Mr. Looman uttered
another syllable about their business. As soon as
the dessert was brought on, Miss Rippletrump
and Georgiana retired to the parlor, where I
joined them very soon. The first named lady was
still in a high excitement.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have joined us, Mr. Franco,"
she said, "for I cannot find out from Miss
De Lancey, whether you are rich or not; if you
be, I hope you will not take offence at what I
have said."</p>

<p>I assured Miss Rippletrump, that the meekest
man in the world would not desire to be poorer.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to hear it," she said, "although
money is well enough in its way; indeed,
I have got a little myself, which I should be very
sorry to lose. But money, without refinement,
makes brutes of its possessors."</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>Political.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next evening, I was engaged with Mr.
Marisett in his private office, for, although my
left arm was still in a sling, I could write very
easily with my other hand. I had been writing
a duplicate letter, and was waiting for him to put
his signature to it.</p>

<p>"It is a poor business, after all," said Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"I think it will leave a margin, sir," I replied,
thinking he referred to the matter contained in
the letter I had been copying.</p>

<p>"Not that," he said, smiling, "not that; but I
was thinking of my cousin Rippletrump's remarks
about making money; they have run in my mind
all day. This money-getting, certainly, does not
fill up the full measure of a man's dignity. She
was right. Once it was something to be rich, but
now I meet with men daily who are richer than
myself; even the milkman who brought milk to
my door but a few months ago, now rides through
Broadway with a liveried footman behind his carriage.
Getting money is not, to be sure, a feminine
employment, but it is neither manly nor ennobling."</p>

<p>I could not guess at the thoughts which were
running in Mr. Marisett's mind, so I made no
reply to his remarks, but only bit the top of my
pen, and waited to hear the remainder of what he
was going to say.</p>

<p>"It has been hinted to me, Mr. Franco, that
if I would consent, I could receive the nomination
of representative in Congress at the coming election."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I replied; "of course, you have determined
to accept."</p>

<p>"I am at a loss what to do; I could not endure
the mortification of a defeat."</p>

<p>"Surely," I said, and with sincerity too, "there
can be no probability of that."</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett shook his head, and smiled.
"There is another objection," he added; "if I
should be elected, it must be by the votes of a
party, and the very sound of party is odious to
me.  'My country,' has a noble sound; but 'my
party,' savors of meanness and littleness of purpose.
It would never satisfy the cravings of my
ambition to be the representative of but a moiety
of my fellow-citizens, and to see it registered in
the public papers, that there were so many thousands,
who refused to give me their votes; and to
know the exact number who considered me unworthy
of their confidence."</p>

<p>"Why not then," I said, "offer yourself as a
candidate for the suffrages of all parties. Of
course, the highest talents and greatest virtues
will command the most votes; as the best merchandize
always commands the highest prices."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you know nothing of politics," replied
Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"I must confess I do not; but this party system
is a strange business."</p>

<p>"It is a system of the arch fiend," said Mr.
Marisett.</p>

<p>And so the subject dropped. But the next
evening Mr. Marisett told me he had been persuaded
to allow his name to be used by the nominating
committee of the party to which he
belonged; and while we sat in the little office, a
gentleman called to speak with him an the subject.
It was Mr. Bloodbutton, a patriotic lawyer, very
celebrated as an orator at ward meetings.</p>

<p>"I have called on you, sir," said Mr. Bloodbutton,
addressing himself to Mr. Marisett, with a
solemn air, "having been deputised for that purpose,
to make some inquiries, and ascertain some
facts in relation to your private history, that I may
be enabled to make some effective points in my
speech to-morrow night at the Hall."</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett smiled, and replied, "upon my
word, Mr. Bloodbutton, I think the wisest way
will be to say nothing at all about me, for I know
of nothing that can be said to any advantage;
except, indeed, that I have always paid my
debts."</p>

<p>"That," replied Mr. Bloodbutton, "wouldn't
be a circumstance. We must have something to
hurrah about, or we shall lose the election. Were
you ever a fireman?"</p>

<p>"Never in my life," replied Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"Did you never save the life of some poor emigrant's
child, by jumping into the river, or in
other words, the briny deep?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Did you never save any body's life in any
manner?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure I never did. Indeed, I am
positive."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were engaged in the late glorious
struggle, our second war of Independence?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say that I was."</p>

<p>"But, you were not a member of the Hartford
Convention?" exclaimed Mr. Bloodbutton, evidently
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Never was in the Bluelaw State in my life,
sir."</p>

<p>"That's fortunate," said Mr. Bloodbutton; "I
trust you were not born down east."</p>

<p>"My Father was a New England man, sir," replied
Mr. Marisett, "and I claim to be a descendant
of the Pilgrims."</p>

<p>"That is bad, very bad," said Mr. Bloodbutton,
shaking his head. "All the down-easters
are Hartford Conventionists."</p>

<p>"My poor father, sir," said Mr. Marisett, "died
before the Convention was thought of."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference in the world, sir,"
said Mr. Bloodbutton, "the public would never
be satisfied with such an apology as that. He
was a federalist, of course?"</p>

<p>"Then the public is unreasonable in the extreme,"
said Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"They generally decide right, sir; we are
bound to respect the will of the majority, in such
cases," replied Mr. Bloodbutton.</p>

<p>I thought it was a very hard case, but I kept my
thoughts to myself.</p>

<p>"But, surely you were drafted during the war,"
said Mr. Bloodbutton.</p>

<p>"I was," said Mr. Marisett, "but I hired a
substitute."</p>

<p>"All the same as though you went yourself,"
said Mr. Bloodbutton, making a memorandum
in his pocket-book. "Was your substitute in any
engagement?"</p>

<p>"I had the curiosity to make some inquiries
about him, and I found that he deserted the first
time be heard the report of a musket."</p>

<p>"Never mind about telling any farther. He
was in actual service; it will make a beautiful
point. I wish he had taken a standard; it would
produce a most thrilling effect to wave it over the
heads of the people at the Hall."</p>

<p>"I wish he had," said Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"Were you born at the time of the revolution?"</p>

<p>"I was not."</p>

<p>"That is dreadfully unlucky, I should like to
make a revolutionary hero of you."</p>

<p>"Would not that be dishonest," said Mr. Marisett.</p>

<p>"Dishonest, sir," replied Mr. Bloodbutton, evidently
astonished at the remark; "nothing is dishonest
in politics that is available. But next to a
revolutionary hero, there is nothing like being born
in the gem of the sea; I presume you can lay no
claim to that distinction?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>"Were not some of your relatives revolutionary
soldiers?"</p>

<p>"My grandfather, I have been told, was a sergeant
in the Continental Army."</p>

<p>"Was he wounded?" inquired Mr. B. eagerly.</p>

<p>"I have heard my grandmother tell that he had
his right heel knocked off, by putting out his foot
to stop a cannon ball which he supposed was
nearly spent."</p>

<p>"Good, good," cried the orator, in an ecstacy
of delight. "Of course there is but one way of
speaking of that circumstance; it has all the dignity
of a historical fact; your ancestors poured
out their blood like water upon the ensanguined
field of&mdash;of&mdash;what battle was it?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind; upon <i>the</i> ensanguined battle
field, will do.</p>

<p>"There are two or three more questions, of
rather a delicate nature, which I wish to ask. I
mean no disrespect, but there are certain things,
of which it is necessary to be informed. You
never stole away the gentle partner of a man's
bosom, nor any thing of that sort?" inquired Mr.
Bloodbutton, timidly, as if afraid an answer in the
affirmative might be given.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Never run one of your particular friends
through the body with a sword cane?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor shot a high-minded and talented genteman
in a duel."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of course, you never hung a militiaman?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mr. Bloodbutton made another entry in his
pocket-book, and then shook Mr. Marisett's hand,
and then extended his hand to me, which I grasped
cheerfully, for I had conceived a high regard for
him, seeing he took such a lively interest in the
affairs of my kind employer.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bloodbutton was gone, Mr. Marisett
leaned back in his chair, and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"What nonsense," he said, "to talk about
broad-farce in the theatre; after all, there is nothing
really serious in this world, but the act of
going out of it."</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p>The effects of speaking in public.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was well known in the counting room of
Marisett &amp; Co. the next morning, that the senior
partner was to be put in nomination for a member
of Congress, and all the clerks took a very lively
interest in the matter, much livelier, indeed, than
Mr. Marisett himself did. A meeting was to be
held that evening, when the nominating committee
were to make their report; and we all agreed
to go from the counting room together. Invoices
were left unfinished, and letters were sent off without
being copied; the excitement was very great.
Even Mr. Bargin seemed to have the starch taken
out of him, as one of the clerks observed; but
Mr. Garvey's religious scruples would not allow
him to mingle in such worldly pursuits as politics;
so he attended to his duties, as usual.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark, we all started off for
Masonic Hall in a body, and got there before the
doors were open. We waited with patience, until
the doors were open, and then made a rush up
the stairs, and we had the satisfaction of having
the Hall all to ourselves for nearly half an hour,
during which time, we examined all the architectural
beauties and elaborate ornaments of that
celebrated place; and we came to the unanimous
conclusion, the reverse of a celebrated piece of
criticism, that if the architect had not taken quite
so much pains, the Hall would have been a good
deal handsomer. After the expiration of half an
hour, the people began to pour in, and very soon
the Hall was crowded to suffocation, and when no
more could get up stairs, the crowd below organized,
and appointed their own Chairman and Secretaries,
and had their own speeches. Although
I was almost dead with the heat, and choked with
dust, I was rejoiced to see the crowd; for I looked
upon it as an undoubted evidence of the popularity
of Mr. Marisett. I got jammed between two
very fat men, and I thought they would have
squeezed the breath out of my body. But I was
most annoyed by a tall man, who stood directly
in from of me, and prevented me from seeing any
of the persons on the platform. Somebody was
addressing the meeting, but the only words I
could hear were, "fellow cit-i-zens." I had never
been at a political meeting before, and I had a
great curiosity to see and hear every thing.
There were fifty Vice Presidents, and thirty-five
Secretaries; and as they were all, as a matter of
course, personal friends of Mr. Marisett, I was
anxious to see them; but the only portion of their
persons that I could catch a glimpse of, was the
tops of their heads, which either exhibited a tuft
of gray hair, or a smooth, glossy surface.</p>

<p>There was a great many speakers, and among
them Mr. Bloodbutton, who, as he promised,
made a decided hit, by introducing the revolutionary
event, with suitable embellishments.
When Mr. Marisett's name was mentioned, there
was a tremendous clapping and cheering. When
the meeting broke up, our little party from the
counting room adjourned to the bar-room below,
where we spent more than half the night in drinking
slings and cocktails, and in exchanging congratulations.
The newspapers the next morning contained
the most exciting accounts of the meeting,
and all the editors seemed to vie with each other
in praising Mr. Marisett. All the great men of
ancient and modern times had to suffer in their
reputations, for he was declared to be infinitely
superior to the best of them, and the descendant
of a revolutionary hero besides. As for his opponent,
the candidate of the opposite party, he
was a Foreigner by birth, an infidel in religion, a
turncoat in politics, a bankrupt in fortune, low in
his pursuits, mean in his origin, intemperate in
his habits, ugly in person, of inferior capacity,
and limited in his acquirements. Of course, there
could be no doubt of the issue in a contest between
two such men; and on strictly party
grounds, without any reference to the qualifications
of the candidates, it was asserted there could
be no doubt of victory; the reaction in the public
feeling was astounding.</p>

<p>We were all in the highest spirits at the flattering
prospects of our employers' success, for we all
loved him, and we knew that the fine things that
were said of him were all true. It was proposed
by Mr. Cornstock, the assistant book-keeper, that
we should all go to Tammany Hall the next
evening, just by way of a joke, to enjoy the desponding
looks of our opponents. The proposition
was agreed to, and when the evening came,
we all went in a body. But the opposition were
not quite so cast down as we expected to find
them. The front of the hall was brilliantly illuminated
with great flaring transparencies, and the
interior was very finely ornamented with flags;
and a live owl, to represent an eagle, was tied to
the speaker's chair. There was a great gathering;
and not withstanding the severe articles in
the papers, the crowd appeared in fine spirits,
and were noisy as victors. They had the same
number of vice presidents and secretaries that we
had at our meeting, and I must acknowledge I
did not see any very great difference in their appearance,
although I expected to have seen the
meanest and most contemptible looking set of fellows
in the world.</p>

<p>A short, thick set gentleman, with a pair of
twinkling black eyes, a smiling countenance, and
a smooth tongue, got up and addressed the meeting
in favor of their candidate, to whom he attributed
all the virtues, and asserted, with unblushing
effrontery, that he was the son of a colonel
in the continental army. Such impudence filled
me with astonishment. But, when the orator,
after exhausting all the eulogistic epithets in praising
his own candidate, fell upon Mr. Marisett,
and began to heap the foulest abuse upon him,
the blood fairly boiled in my veins. I could
scarce contain myself until he had finished speaking.
This was too bad to be endured, and I felt
myself called upon, by every principle of honor
and gratitude, to defend the character of my benefactor.</p>

<p>So while the people were shouting and clapping
their hands, after the speaker had sat down,
I elbowed my way up to the platform, and mounted
the steps. I took off my hat, and the mob
greeted me with three rounds of cheers; and
then followed a deadly silence. My heart fluttered,
and I wished myself any where in the world
but where I was, when I looked round upon the
multitude of human eyes which were levelled at
me. It is nothing to make one of a crowd, but
to stand above one, and to see its thousand eyes
gazing at you, is something. But there was no
retreating. I drew a long breath, and then took
a swallow of Manhattan water, and tried to
speak; but I could say nothing more than, "fellow
cit&mdash;i&mdash;zens."</p>

<p>The mob commiserating my confusion, encouraged
me to proceed by giving me three more
rounds of applause. I began to gain confidence,
and pronounced once more, "fellow cit-i-zens,"
took another glass of Manhattan water, and proceeded.
"I am bold in rising to address you, although
for the first time." "Speak louder, speak
louder," cried the mob&mdash;"because,"&mdash;"speak
louder, Bub," said one of the vice presidents, encouragingly&mdash;"because,"
I continued, "freedom
of debate and liberty of conscience are, I am
told, among the glorious privileges for which you
do battle; and having gained them for yourselves,
you are willing to accord them to others." Three
more rounds of applause, and cries of, "bravo!"
"go it!" "spit it out!" &amp;c. "Therefore I say,
I can, with confidence, stand here, and claim the
privilege of vindicating the character of a great
and good man, whose character has this night,
and on this platform, been slanderously assailed.
I need not say that I allude to that excellent gentleman,
Jonathan Marisett."</p>

<p>As I concluded these words, a shout of yells,
shrieks, and hisses, broke from the mob, and made
the Hall tremble to its foundation. "Hustle him
out," "bustle him out," *kill the 'ristocrat." "off
with his ruffle shirt," "out with him," were sounds
that rose up above the confused din. A dozen
ruffianly fellows caught hold of me at once, and I
was tossed, and kicked, and cuffed, and thrown
from one to another, over the heads of that patriotic
assemblage. Canes were levelled at me from
every side, and quids of tobacco showered above
my head like hail, and now and then a torrent of
warm tobacco juice came gushing into my eyes.
By and bye I felt myself descending the stairs,
and at last, the cool night air blew upon my face,
and suddenly I found myself lying in the gutter.</p>

<p>I was completely stunned, and frightened almost
to death; my coat was torn off, my shirt was
in tatters, and my hat and watch were gone; the
wound in my arm had started to bleeding, and I
was covered with gore. My companions picked
me up, and put me into a hackney coach, and
drove me home.</p>

<p>Georgiana, hearing the noise as they took me
into the hall, came out oflhe parlor, and as soon
as she saw me, fainted. Mrs. Butler had me
washed and put to bed, and a physician sent for,
when it was discovered that, although I was badly
bruised, I was not dangerously hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett said, he was extremely mortified
at what I had done, and for the first time, since I
had been in his employ, he censured me. But as
soon as I was well enough to go out again, he
gave me a gold watch, and told me to go to his
tailor's and get measured for a suit of clothes.
Although my hurt was not dangerous, yet the
doctor said it was necessary for me to keep my
bed for a fortnight. Once more I had the happiness
of having Georgiana to sit by my bed side,
and read to me from the book she loved so well.
But still my heart was untouched, except by her
charms. How could aught beside find a lodgment
there. She completely filled up, and engrossed
all my affections; all my thoughts, hopes,
wishes, and desires, centered upon her. Even my
ambition to excel my cousin daily grew less; the
whole strength of my soul was exhausted by love
for Georgiana.</p>

<p>The day of the election came round, and found
me still in bed; I was very anxious to be out, but
the doctor would not allow me to go. It was a
special election, and the interest which is usually
shared by a dozen candidates, was engrossed by
two. I was in a state of continued and feverish
excitement, until the result was known, which had
the effect of retarding my recovery. At last the
astounding news was brought to me. Mr. Marisett
was defeated by an immense majority!</p>

<p>The next day, the papers were full of dark
hints about bribery and corruption, and mysterious
inuendoes about contesting the election; but
the next day after, they contained not a word on
the subject, and Mr. Marisett and his virtues were
as suddenly and as completely forgotten, as
though he had never had an existence.</p>

<p>But Mr. Marisett did not forget his defeat, although
the public did; he was mortified and disappointed;
and the exciting passion for distinction
having taken possession of him, he could not
break away from it, and resume his quiet business
habits.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p>Tears and smiles.</p>

</div>

<p>A FEW weeks after the election, I sat in the private
office, arranging some papers, when Mr.
Marisett came in, and seated himself at his desk.
He remained almost an hour, with his eyes cast
down, and his lips compressed in his peculiar manner,
conveying to the mind an impression of firmness,
which I have sometimes felt, when gazing on
a granite pillar.</p>

<p>"I have been defeated," he spoke at length,
"in the only attempt l ever made to gain popular
favor. I was a fool to make an adventure
where I had no experience, and where I could
have no controlling influence, and where success
could be insured neither by calculation nor merit.
Henceforth, Mr. Franco, we will act with more
discretion."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall try to," I said, holding up
my arm, which I was still obliged to wear in a
sling; "but I was not aware that any one beside
myself had shown any want of discretion in the
contest."</p>

<p>"I mean in choosing the object, and not in
pursuing it," he said. "However, it may prove
fortunate for me that I lost the election. I have
almost matured in my mind a plan, which will, if
I carry it into operation, gain me more renown,
and greater means of usefulness, than if I had
been fifty times a member of Congress. I have
not named the subject to my partners yet, but I
shall to-morrow, and if we determine to carry it
into execution, we shall have occasion to send you
off on an agency."</p>

<p>I replied that nothing would give me greater
happiness than to be instrumental in advancing
his interests, but that I should greatly prefer doing
it at home, if I could as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett looked me full in the face, and I
blushed; for I thought he suspected the cause of
my unwillingness to go abroad. I may have
been mistaken, but the thought made me feel uneasy
and confused, and when I had finished my
writing, I bade him good night, and retired to my
chamber.</p>

<p>I felt unhappy at the prospect of leaving Georgiana,
for I considered it as certain that I should
be compelled to do so. Mr. Marisett was one of
those men who never allow any one to share in
their thoughts, but wait until their plans are matured
in their own minds before they expose them
to others. His manner with his partners was
this:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, I have thought of entering
into such and such an arrangement; what do you
think of it?"</p>

<p>Perhaps one of them would venture to make
an objection.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," he would reply, "my
mind is made up; we will do as I propose."</p>

<p>But it was only in affairs of importance that he
was thus positive; in matters of minor concern
he would always yield his own opinion with the
best grace imaginable.</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Marisett told me he had
consulted with his partners, and that he had determined
on carrying his plans into execution.
It was nothing less that an attempt to get the control
of the cotton market into his hands. It was
a stupendous undertaking; but Mr. Marisett was
a conqueror in business, and nothing with him
appeared difficult of accomplishment, where industry,
foresight, or calculation, could be of avail.
The entire plan of operations by which he expected
to effect his object, I never knew; for it
was his practice never to give one man any further
insight into his views than what was actually
necessary to enable him to perform the particular
duly assigned to him. But with me, Mr. Marisett
had generally been less reserved; on this occasion,
however, he merely told me that I must
get myself in readiness to leave for New Orleans
at the end of the week; that I must make
all possible haste in getting to my place of destination;
and that my instructions were not to be
opened until I got there.</p>

<p>Although this proof of confidence was gratifying
to my pride, I would gladly have remained in
his office at home, if I could; for I had still a
hope of being able to overcome the scruples of
Georgiana, and I was afraid that, in my absence,
my cousin would succeed, by his hypocrisy, in
gaining her affections.</p>

<p>The bare thought of such an event almost distracted
me, and once I determined to tell Mr.
Marisett that I could not go. But a second
thought reminded me of the honor and profit
which I should gain by going; and that I should
thereby triumph over my cousin, and heap coals
of fire on his head; so pride, and revenge, and
avarice, at last overpowered love. But it was a
hard struggle. And yet I would not have resigned
Georgiana De Lancey for the whole world;
but I was willing, seemingly, to give her up for a
season, that I might thereby gratify the darling
passion of my soul.</p>

<p>The few days which were left me for preparation,
flew away more rapidly than time had ever
flown by me before; and the last night in which I
was to sleep under the same roof with Georgiana,
had arrived. It was late in the evening
when I closed a letter to my parents, informing
them of my intended journey. It could make but
little difference, whether a thousand or a hundred
miles separated us; and yet I could not refrain a
tear, at the thought of being farther removed from
them. I sealed my letter, and hastened out of the
office, where I had been writing alone. As I
passed through the hall, with the intention of going
up to my chamber, I saw Georgiana sitting by
herself in the parlor. She appeared sad. I
stopped a moment at the door; she raised her
eyes; I fancied there was an invitation in their
glance, and I entered and sat down. But it we
a long time before I could speak; my utterance
was choked, and I made many attempts before I
could articulate a syllable. Georgiana was very
pale, and but for the tremulous motion of her lips,
she would have looked like a corpse. I had never
seen her look so sad and dejected before. At last
I spoke.</p>

<p>"I shall leave you to-morrow, Miss De Lancey,"
I said, "and as this may be the last time I
shall ever be allowed the privilege of speaking to
you alone, I cannot leave you, without telling you
once more that I love you. I know it is unreasonable
in me, so worthless, to hope that you, who
are so worthy, should return love for love, or even
cold esteem for warm and glowing passion. I
know it is even wicked to indulge in the unholy
dream of being united to one so much above me.
But our affections are not always under our own
control; and madness though it be in me to love,
still I must love, because it is madness. I do love
you, dear Georgiana; how well, I cannot speak.
And my love is not lessened, because I feel how
unworthy I am of you. The heart yearns for
something higher and holier than itself; as you,
when you first felt guilt in your soul, looked up
and sought communion with the Holy Spirit.
You found the purity for which you sought. O!
that my heart might find the purity after which it
yearns."</p>

<p>Georgiana made no reply, but she covered her
face with her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"O that I could leave you," I continued, "knowing
that you feel an interest in my welfare! I
could then go with a free and buoyant spirit; but
if otherwise, it will be a weary road that I shall
travel."</p>

<p>Georgiana continued to sob, and I felt it would
he ungenerous to press her to make a confession,
which her religious scruples forbade, let her inclinations
be what they might. I took her hand,
which hung by her side, and pressing it to my lips,
bade her good bye, and left her. I felt assured
that she loved me. It was enough.</p>

<p>The next morning I did not see her; but the
kindhearted housekeeper met me at the door as I
was leaving, and I whispered in her ear to remember
me to Miss Georgy.</p>

<p>Mr. Marisett accompanied me to the steam-boat,
and as he put the package into my hands which
contained my instructions, he told me that it depended
upon the prudence of my conduct in New
Orleans, whether I was admitted as a partner in
the firm of Marisett &amp; Co. on my return. He
shook me cordially by the hand, and bade me
farewell. I stepped on board the boat; the last
bell was ringing, and as I was elbowing my way
along the deck, a small package was suddenly
thrust into my hands. I turned to see from whom
it came. "Cast off," exclaimed the pilot; a slight
boyish figure sprang ashore; the fasts were cut
loose, and away we darted through the water. I
looked long and anxiously, but the slight form
was lost in the crowd, and I saw it no more.</p>

<p>The letter which had been put into my hand so
mysteriously, was directed to me in a pretty woman's
hand, which I recognised immediately as
Georgiana's. I sought out a retired spot, and
tearing open the envelope with a beating heart
and trembling hands, read as follows:</p>

<p>"DEAR HARRY,</p>

<p>"My conscience upbraids me with having
broken the golden rule, in my intercourse with
you, and I cannot allow you to leave me, under a
false impression of my feelings. I am afraid I
have not been sufficiently plain, when you have
spoken to me on <i>the</i> subject, in giving you to understand
that my mind is unalterably fixed, never
to unite myself to one, whose heart has not been
bowed under the conscious burden of his sins;
for my promise has been passed, mentally only,
I own, but I cannot break it. It is registered
above. Had I known you before the vow was
made, perhaps it never would have been; but it
is, and I am bound by it. Our hands, dear Harry,
may never be united, but our hearts may be.
I cannot dissimulate, I do love you; how well I
love you, let this confession witness. If it be sinful
in me, I trust that He, in whom is all my trust,
will pardon me, and deliver me from my bondage.
And my constant prayer to Him is, that he will
bring you to the foot of that Cross, where alone I
can meet you.</p>

<p>"I know that I am overstepping the worldly
line of propriety in making this confession to you,
but what has the world to do with you and me?
I know the integrity of my own heart, and I have
no fears of yours. Dear Harry, you will not
love me less because I do not deceive you. If I
were indifferent to you, I could not deceive you;
how then can I, regarding you as I do, fulfil the
law, by allowing you to leave me, with painful
suspicions in your mind, and ignorant of the true
state of my affections? Would I that others
should do so to me? Life is too short for deceit;
the time is too near at hand when all things shall
be revealed.</p>

<p>"Once more let me entreat you to put on the
armor of faith. Repeat; confess your sins;
pray; read your bible. Forgive me, that I, who
am so ignorant, should thus dictate to you.
Attribute this too great zeal&mdash;to love for your
soul.</p>

<p>"May the God of all grace defend you, support
you, and convert you.</p>

<p>"GEORGIANA DE L."</p>

<p>I read this precious letter a thousand times; I
studied it, and weighed every word; I dissected
every sentence, but the flattering hope of my
breast found no spot whereon to alight. True, to
be assured by Georgiana herself that she loved
me, was a bliss to which I had never even dared
to aspire; but to be told by her that she loved
me, and that she could never be mine, was a
depth lower in wretchedness than I had ever
even feared.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p>Arrive at New Orleans, and meet with an old acquaintance.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was just at dark when I landed on the lev&eacute;e,
in New Orleans, and after seeing my baggage
deposited at Bishop's hotel, I took a stroll through
the town. Some of the streets reminded me
strongly of the dark <i>Calle</i> which I first entered in
Buenos Ayres, and some of the houses were facsimiles
of those in that city. As I sauntered
along through the Rue St. Louis, my attention
was arrested by a bright light, and the jingling
of silver, issuing through a partly closed
door. My curiosity was excited, and I pushed
open the door and entered. I perceived at a
glance that I was in a gambling house. It was a
large room, brilliantly illuminated with argand
lamps, and well filled with a motley assemblage
of men. There were three roulette tables, and
two faro tables, and in one corner of the apartment
was a capacious mahogany sideboard, on
which was placed an abundance of what is called
refreshments, viz.: claret and whiskey, Bologna
sausages, and segars.</p>

<p>There was an excited crowd round each of the
tables; and oaths, and curses, and sometimes
long drawn sighs, were mingled with the continual
jingle of dollars, and the gruff voices of the
croupiers, calling out the numbers which decided
the issue of the games. These croupiers were
sturdy looking men, dressed in snowy white jackets,
and very much ornamented with jewelry.
One of them, a long nosed man, I thought I had
seen before; he was dressed very fine, and
his manner appeared familiar to me. I stood
looking at him earnestly, as he exercised his
long mahogany stick, and hauled in the little heap
of half dollars and quarters which were lost on the
roulette table at which he was sitting, when suddenly
he caught sight of me, and exclaimed,
"Franco, my pippin, how are you?" He gave
up his stick to a man who was sitting at his elbow,
and came from behind the table and shook me
heartily by the hand.</p>

<p>It was my old acquaintance, Jack Lummucks,
the drummer. He said he was most infernal happy
to see me; although the last time I met him, he
turned his head away from me.</p>

<p>Mr. Lummucks took me by the arm, and walked
me into a coffee-house close by, and insisted on
my drinking a julep; there was no escape, so I
submitted. I should have been very glad to get
rid of him, but he would cling to me. He had
acquired the habit of hanging on to one when he
was a drummer, and he couldn't leave it off now
that there was nothing to be gained by it; it was
also as natural for him to treat, as it was for him
to breathe. He invited me to go to his boarding
house to supper, but I refused. However, I
might as well have gone willingly, for he at last
compelled me to go; I could not shake him off.
As his boarding house was in the lower part of
the city, before we reached it, he related to me,
without shame or reserve, how his old employers,
J. Smith Davis &amp; Co. had sent him down South,
on a collecting and drumming tour, and that having
collected some thousands of dollars, he came
down the Mississippi with the intention of embarking
in one of the packets for New York; but he
dropped into the gambling house one night, where
I met him, and lost all the money which he had
collected for his employer, and afterwards the
proprietor of the house had engaged him for a
<i>croupier</i>. It was the most natural change in the
world; his habits as a jobber's drummer, exactly
qualified him for a gambler's <i>croupier</i>. But I
could not help expressing my opinion of Mr.
Lummucks very plainly; he took it very coolly,
however, and justified his misconduct by laying
all the blame to the door of his old employer, Mr.
J. Smith Davis, who, he said, had brought him
up to it.</p>

<p>When we got to the door of Mr. Lummuck's
boarding house, I hesitated about going in; but
calling to mind that holy and good men had sat
down to meat with evil ones, I thought it would not
be becoming in one so imperfect as myself, to be
over scrupulous in the choice of my company.</p>

<p>The house was a little shingle cottage, with a
projecting roof, and a door which opened from the
street into the parlor. We found the table spread,
and the family just sitting down to supper. Mr.
Lummucks introduced me as his particular friend,
from the North, and I took a seat at table by the
side of the landlady, Madame Grandemaison, a
jovial French woman, with a treble chin; her two
daughters, pretty, black eyed girls, sat opposite to
me. There were two gentlemen besides Mr. Lummucks
and myself, a tall, red nosed, blue eyed,
sandy haired Scotchman; and a little sleek looking
Frenchman, whose body bore no small resemblance
to an apple pudding, with an apple dumpling
placed on top of it.</p>

<p>Madame talked incessantly; and the two Mademoiselles
talked incessantly. Monsieur talked
without ceasing, and so did the Scotchman. I
could not repeat their conversation if I were disposed,
for it was in French, and I could not understand
a syllable. But spite of the talking,
there was no interruption to the eating and drinking,
and a large dish of rice and gumbo, and
half a dozen bottles of sour claret, with a due proportion
of bread and artichokes, disappeared very
rapidly.</p>

<p>After the supper. and while the table was still
standing on the floor, the young ladies expressed
a strong desire to waltz; and as the proposition
found favor with all present, Marie, the black
cook, was called in to sing.</p>

<p>Now I had never waltzed in my lite, but I had
seen others waltz, and I thought nothing could be
easier. So I yielded to the entreaties of Mr. Lummocks,
and offered my arm to Madame Grandemaison
herself; a huge mountain of flesh though
she was, she whirled around with the velocity of a
top. Mr. Lummucks put his arm around the
waist of one of the Mademoiselles, the Scotchman
paired off with the other, and the sleek little
Frenchman being left without a partner, caught
up a chair, and with great good nature exclaimed,
<i>toujours gai</i>, clasped it to his breast, and joined
in. The black cook struck up in a loud and
clear voice, the waltz from Der Freyschutz, and
away we went. It was with difficulty that I kept
hold of my partner, for the circumference of her
waist was entirely beyond the capacity of my arms.</p>

<p>The supper table was in the centre of the room,
and the circuits we made around it would have
been it very pretty illustration of the solar system.
Black Marie was giving us her music in double
quick time, and consequently our revolutions were
very rapid; how many we had made, I could not
tell; they appeared to me a million at least; I
began to grow very giddy; the sweat started from
all the pores in my body; my head grew lighter
and lighter; the candles appeared to be flying
about the room, and the floor seemed to be rising
and falling; objects began to grow dim and indistinct;
the shrill tones of Marie's voice sounded,
in my ears like the hum of a monstrous moscheto,
and her sable visage, as I caught short glimpses
of it, with her white teeth and scarlet gums,
looked like the face of the evil one. I tried to
stop, but in vain; Madame grasped me tightly by
the shoulders; round and round we continued to
spin. I grew sicker and sicker, till at last my
knees could no longer support me, and down I
tumbled, bringing Madame Grandemaison with
me in my fall. She made the cottage shake to its
foundations, if it had any. Over went the supper
table, scattering the gumbo, and claret, and china,
and glasses, in every direction. The others were
whirling around with such an impetus, they could
not stop themselves, and down they came on top
of us. Mr. Lummucks and his partner first, then
the Scotchman and his partner, and lastly, the
little Frenchman, who, in his fall, forced the leg
of his chair down the throat of the Scotchman,
who lay on his back with his mouth open, and demolished
two thirds of his front teeth. Such
screaming, such swearing, such spoiled dresses,
and such broken crockery, I will venture to assert,
were never heard nor seen before, on a similar
occasion. I contrived to extricate myself from
the ruins, with the loss only of my coat tail, and
the supper I had eaten; part of which I bestowed
on each of my companions, in my struggles to get
clear of them. What damage they received individually,
I do not know, for I found my hat, and
rushed out of the door, and never returned to
Madame Grandemaison's again.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p>The beginning and the end of my operations.</p>

</div>

<p>ON opening my instructions, I found that Mr.
Marisett had given me positive directions for the
purchase and disposition of cotton, and had left almost
nothing for the exercise of my judgment. I
was not displeased that it was so; for he had given
me abundant proof of his confidence, by placing
at my disposal an almost unlimited amount of
available funds, with which I was to pay for the
purchases I might make. He had also given me
letters to some of the principal houses in New
Orleans, but had enjoined me not to deliver them
unless I should have particular occasion to call on
the merchants to whom they were addressed.</p>

<p>When I left New York, many prudent merchants,
far-seeing or fearful, had already began to throw
out dark and ominous hints of an approaching
catastrophe in the mercantile world; croakers
there always are, who, in the brightest sunshine
can see a black cloud rising in the horizon; but
there was good cause at that time to anticipate a
fearful winding up in the affairs of the trading and
speculating world. Mr. Marisett, however, had
no fears for himself; he had stood the shocks of a
great many revulsions in the commercial world,
and it was not a matter of especial wonder that he
deemed himself invincible. But an extraordinary
course of action in a quarter which hitherto had
produced only healthful influences, was surely
working to overwhelm thousands in inevitable ruin,
because they could not guard against evils which
precedent had given them no cause to anticipate.</p>

<p>Already had the anticipated crisis began to give
signs of its nearness, which could not be misunderstood
when I arrived at New Orleans. There
seemed to be a dread of some overhanging calamity
in the minds of all with whom I conversed.
Men would meet together in the Exchange or on
the Lev&eacute;e, and shake their heads, or regard each
other with looks of suspicion or concern, and after
making some vague surmise, they would part to
encounter the same looks of distrust, and the same
surmises, in the next with whom they conversed.
But there was a strange, daring recklessness, mixed
up with all this despondency and apprehension.
They rushed into the wildest speculations, while
they were even looking for an unfavorable termination
of those in which they had already engaged.</p>

<p>It was impossible that I should mix long with
men whose looks, and acts, and talk, were all
tinged with the dingy hue of despair, without becoming
in some measure similarly affected myself.</p>

<p>I continued to make purchases and new contracts
for cotton; but I wished that my orders had
not been so peremptory, for I was afraid that I
was bringing ruin upon my employer, and upon
myself; by acting up to the letter of his instructions.
But I knew that in matters of business,
success must depend upon implicit obedience of
orders; and I had no alternative. I was anxiously
expecting letters from New York, but none
came. Affairs, however, soon assumed such an
aspect, that I was compelled, of necessity, to
suspend all business operations. My funds consisted
of blank acceptances of Marisett &amp; Co.,
which I had negociated without difficulty, as I had
occasion. One morning it was announced that
two or three of the most prominent houses had
suspended, and suddenly a panic seized upon the
minds of the whole people, such as had never
been known before, except when sudden fear has
struck upon the hearts of a city, from a convulsion
of nature, or the approach to its gates of a
hostile army.</p>

<p>The banks closed their doors with one accord,
and a simultaneous suspension followed among
all the merchants. Feeling the want of an adviser
in this emergency, I called at the house of an
old merchant, a particular friend of Mr. Marisett's,
to whom he had given me a letter; but I encountered
there nothing but wailing and wo; he had,
but a few minutes before, nearly severed his
head from his body with a razor, and his gory
corpse lay stretched upon the floor, with his
distracted children weeping over him. This was
not a solitary case; many similar occurred almost daily.</p>

<p>At last, the anxiously expected advices arrived
from New York, bringing with them accounts of
overturnings, failures, and distresses immeasurable.
The letter which I received was in Mr.
Marisett's own hand; it ran thus:</p>

<p>"New York, &mdash; &mdash;.</p>

<p>"Mr. H. Franco, New Orleans.</p>

<p>"SIR,</p>

<p>"Immediately on the receipt of this, you
will destroy all the blank acceptances of Marisett
and Co., which may remain in your hands.
Make no farther contracts of any description,
for account of our house, but hold yourself in
readiness to return to New York.</p>

<p>"Yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p>"MARISETT &amp; Co."</p>

<p>This letter relieved my anxiety, in some degree,
but I looked anxiously for further advices;
I was in a hurry to leave New Orleans. I was
not left many days in suspense, for I soon after
received the following letter from Mr. Bargin:</p>

<p>"Mr. H. Franco, New Orleans.</p>

<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>"Since our last, of the 28th ult., we have
come to the determination of stopping payment.
It may be necessary for us to make an assignment;
if so, we will advise you farther, and remain,</p>

<p>"Your obedient servants,</p>

<p>"MARISETT &amp; CO."</p>

<p>I had never dreamed of the possibility of the
house of Marisett &amp; Co. stopping payment; the
intelligence, therefore, of the fact, came upon me
with the suddenness and severity of a thunder
stroke; it stunned my faculties, and it was a long
while before I could fully comprehend that it was
real. My affection for Mr. Marisett alone, would
have roused all my sympathies; but in the fall of
the firm, my own towering hopes were all brought
to the ground. Love, ambition, and revenge,
were all laid low.</p>

<p>To be on the ground is nothing; but to fall
there from a great height, is sometimes fatal.</p>

<p>The next letter that I received was as follows:</p>

<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>"We are without any of your valued favors
since we acknowledged yours of the 14th.
You have already been informed of the stoppage
of our house; and I have now to inform you, that
in consequence of our Mr. Garvey having used
the name of the firm to a very great extent, in
his private land operations, our liabilities are
found greatly to exceed our assets. Our senior
partner, I am concerned to add, is completely
prostrated by this event, and unable to afford me
the aid which I require in adjusting the affairs of
the concern. All the circumstances considered, I
think it will be advisable for you to return to
New York as soon as you can bring matters to a
close at New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Cotton, I think, is now down to the lowest point
of depression, and a beautiful thing might be made
out of it if we had the means to go into an operation.</p>

<p>"Referring to copy of our last respects, enclosed,</p>

<p>"I remain, yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p>"WM. BARGIN."</p>

<p>My worst fears were all realized; I could hope
for nothing by returning to New York, but to encounter
the haughty scorn of my cousin in my altered
circumstances, and to be tortured by the
sight of Georgiana De Lancey; to know that she
loved me, and that an incurable fanaticism prevented
her from ever becoming mine.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the change which had taken
place in my prospects unsettled the fixed purpose
of my soul. The time had passed when I could
find relief in tears; the bitterness of my disappointments
was too great for grief. I began to
think of death. The recklessness of life, and the
daring of dissipation, which surrounded me on
every side, were infections. It was an easy thing
to die; but to sustain the burden of life was a weary
task.</p>

<p>I had a considerable sum of money still in my
possession, the proceeds of a draft which I had
discounted before receiving the advices from Mr.
Marisett, and I determined to take it with me to
the gambling house where I had seen Mr. Lummucks,
and try my fortune at the pharo table; if
I should be successful, then I would return to New
York, fearless of my cousin, and with at least one
of my desires gratified; and if I should lose, why
then I would rid myself at once of all my troubles.
I furnished myself with a pistol and ball, and putting
them in my pocket, took my money in my
hand, and left my hotel in search of the gambling
house in the Rue St. Louis.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p>The great change.</p>

</div>

<p>ALTHOUGH it was early in the evening when I
left the hotel, the streets were very dark, and there
being a thick fog, I very soon lost myself, and my
mind not being in a very quiet state, I got quite
bewildered. I was afraid to ask any one to show
me to St. Louis street, lest they might suspect my
motive in going there; so I groped along till I
came to a half-opened door, with the light streaming
out of it. I thought it was the place for which I
was searching, and hastily pushed open the door
and walked in. But I perceived at a glance that
I had stumbled upon at house of quite a different
character. It was a large room dimly lighted
with tallow candles, and about half filled with men
and women, and not a small portion of them were
black; I stepped back, and was about to leave the
place, when an old negro woman, bent almost
double, and shrivelled with age, put her hand upon
the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Massa, what for you don't sit down; take a
seat, do young massa."</p>

<p>"What should I stay here for," I said, trying to
push the woman aside.</p>

<p>"Stop and hear good sarment, do your soul
good, massa," replied the negro.</p>

<p>I made an attempt to pass out again, but she
kept hold of the door.</p>

<p>"Now do stop, massa, do; I love your precious
soul, and the Lord Jesus love you too. Do stop,
young massa, and hear what the Lord do for
you; he is good for your soul, sartain true; I
am only poor old nigger slave, massa, but I will
pray for your soul all I can."</p>

<p>The old slave was very earnest in her manner,
and perceiving that the eyes of the congregation
were turned upon me, I sat down upon one of the
benches, with the intention of slipping out as soon
as I could do so unperceived. Strange as it may
appear, I actually thought the old negro suspected
the errand on which I was bound, and I felt
ashamed to encounter the glance of her eye.</p>

<p>At one end of the room was a little temporary
pulpit, which was occupied by a very young looking
man, apparently still in his teens; he immediately
stood up and commenced the services by
making a short prayer, and then he gave out the
hymn. He was a fair haired and light complexioned
youth, with a delicate blush on his cheeks,
and withal so modest and unassuming in his manner,
that my curiosity was excited to hear what
kind of a sermon could proceed from such a source,
and I made up my mind to remain a few minutes
and hear him. He named his text; it was the last
words of the Bible, "and the spirit and the bride
say, come," &amp;c. The words were familiar to my
ear, for they had been read to me by Georgiana,
and her soft and tender voice had imparted a
sweetness and beauty to them which had impressed
them upon my mind. But now they seemed not
to fall upon my ear alone, but upon my heart; I
did not hear them only, I felt them.</p>

<p>The young preacher spoke with great boldness
and strength, as if roused by the majesty and holiness
of the words he had uttered. My attention
was arrested, and I soon forgot my determination
of leaving the room. Every word he uttered seemed
like the effect of inspiration, and he appeared to
me an impersonation of the spirit whose message
he uttered. I knew not why it was, but I felt
strangely. I had listened to many sermons before,
and from men too who had convulsed whole communities
by their preaching, but never until now
had I experienced the slightest emotion. The very
words which the preacher spoke, passed from me
as they fell upon my ear, but they left an impression
upon my heart, which I believe will exist in
eternity. I listened with eager attention to the
whole of the sermon, and at the close, wished that
he had continued to preach longer. I felt anxious
to stay and speak to him, but I was ashamed to be
seen by those present; but most of all by the old
slave who had detained me. I looked upon them
with envious feelings, as I observed their quiet,
placid faces, if those feelings can be called envious,
in which there is neither malice nor ill-will.</p>

<p>When the meeting was dismissed, I left the
house without speaking to any one, and hastened
back to my hotel; and on my way I passed the
gambling house which I had been in search of, but
I shuddered as I passed it; the door was partly
open, and the click of silver, and loud oaths and
curses, struck upon my ear. I drew the pistol from
my pocket, and threw it into the street. O! that
I could as easily have torn from my breast the load
of conscious guilt which oppressed me.</p>

<p>I reached my chamber, and locked myself in, in
an unquiet state of mind. I wanted relief, but I
knew not how to obtain it; my first impulse was
to seek for it in the Bible, but alas! alas! I had
none. It was late in the evening; the stores were
all closed, and I knew not where to find one. O!
how I longed to look into its precious pages, and
how cutting to my soul was the reflection that I
had often turned over its sacred leaves with an idle
curiosity, and then thrown it heedlessly aside. I
tried to recall to my mind some of those passages,
which Georgiana had so often repeated to me, but
in vain. All I could remember was, "Search the
Scriptures;" but whether these words were the injunction
of some kind friend, or of the Holy Book
itself, I could not remember; they were continually
before me.</p>

<p>But why should I obtrude upon the world the
wrestlings of my spirit with its maker? While I
glory in acknowledging that I found peace in believing,
that peace which they alone find who hang
their sins upon the cross, I draw the veil of time
over the tears and struggles which will be revealed
in eternity.</p>

<p>Within a very few days my feelings were all
changed, and although I no longer looked upon
the world with the same eyes with which I regarded
it before, I could not be insensible to the events
passing around me. Scarce a day passed in which
some poor wretch, whose worldly prospects were
suddenly blasted, did not, with his own hands, deprive
himself of the life which had become a burden
to him. But the disasters of this period are
still fresh in the minds of men; and their effects
are still felt. I am conscious it is not a proper subject
to dilate upon, except as it concerns myself.
My operations for account of Marisett &amp; Co. were
not very extensive, and as I was not personally
liable for any of the contracts I had made, I concluded
to return immediately to New York. I went
down to the lev&eacute;e to engage a passage in one of
the packets, and going on board, I inquired for the
captain.</p>

<p>"I am the captain of this barkey," said a big
bearded man, in a voice that sounded familiar to
me, as he stepped out of the hurricane house on
deck.</p>

<p>"Are you, indeed," I replied; "I am very
happy to hear it, for although I have forgotten
your name, I remember you are an old acquaintance."</p>

<p>"His name is Capting Davis," said the mate,
stepping up.</p>

<p>"So it is; I am happy to see you, Captain Davis,"
I said.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir," said Captain Davis,
raising his hat with one hand, and extending his
other for a shake. "You are welcome on board
the Ocean; but you have got the advantage of me,
I do not remember your name."</p>

<p>"My name is Franco," I replied; "perhaps
you will remember me when I remind you that
I met you at the 'Foul Anchor,' in Water
street."</p>

<p>Captain Davis looked a little confused, and
said be recollected having met me there very
well.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you don't remember me no
how?" said the mate.</p>

<p>"What, Mr. Ruffin!" I exclaimed, as I looked
at him; "is it possible; I do indeed remember
you very well." And thereupon, Mr. Ruffin and
I shook hands very cordially, and talked over the
particulars of our adventures together; and I
learned from him that Captain Gunnell had got
tired of the sea, and gone west, and purchased a
farm.</p>

<p>"And pray, when did you see Miss Mary Ann
last?" I inquired of Captain Davis.</p>

<p>"Not five minutes since," replied the captain;
"she is my lady; if you will walk down into
the cabin, I will introduce you to her."</p>

<p>I found Mrs. Davis, the late Miss Mary Ann,
in full possession of the ladies' cabin of the
Ocean, looking quite as pretty as when I saw her
last, and a good deal happier. She looked somewhat
confused when she saw me, but I pretended
to take no notice of it, and after drinking a glass
of wine, and eating a piece of her wedding cake,
and chatting with her a few minutes, I went on
deck again, and engaged my passage; luckily,
I was just in time to secure the last berth. The
next day after, we left, and after a pleasant
passage of twenty-one days, arrived at New
York.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p>Arrival at New York, and departure therefrom; with many
other matters.</p>

</div>

<p>AS soon as I landed, I hastened immediately
to the office of Marisett &amp; Co., in South street.
I found Mr. Bargin dressed as neatly, and looking
as stately as ever. He expressed a great
deal of pleasure at seeing me, and inquired
very coolly about the cotton market in New Orleans.</p>

<p>I cast my eyes towards Mr. Garvey's desk; it
was covered with dust, and appeared to have been
some time without an occupant. Mr. Marisett's
mahogany arm chair was wheeled up into one corner,
and his desk was closed. I shook my head,
and remarked, that "a very few months had effected
very great changes."</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Mr. Bargin.</p>

<p>I inquired after all the clerks in the office, and
then, last of all, I inquired after those who were
first in my affections.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Marisett? Is he well?" I said.
"Very much so, or at least he was when he
left," said Mr. Bargin.</p>

<p>"Left!" I said; "pray has he gone?"</p>

<p>"It is more than a month since he left," replied
Mr. Bargin.</p>

<p>"Of course he will soon return?" said I, inquiringly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bargin shrugged his shoulders ominously.
"I am afraid," he said, "I shall never
see him again. His reverses have completely upset
him; he will never be fit to do business again,
at all events."</p>

<p>"And where has he gone?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Bargin shrugged his shoulders again, and
said, "no one knows here where he has gone; he
would tell nobody; he assigned all his property
for the benefit of his creditors, and they discharged
him from his liabilities. I never saw a man
so completely broke down; he couldn't survive
the loss of his credit, and he went of in search
of an unfrequented spot, where he could end his
days in quiet; where there would be nothing to
remind him of his misfortunes."</p>

<p>"Of course, Miss De Lancey remains in New
York," I said.</p>

<p>"No; she would go with him, contrary to the
advice of her friends," said Mr. Bargin, coolly.</p>

<p>How my heart sunk at this intelligence! "Melancholy!
melancholy fate!" I exclaimed, unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Very much so, indeed," said Mr. Bargin,
"but it was as well for her to go. She had lost
all her property; her uncle had employed it in
a speculation, in which every copper was used up;
and she, woman-like, would stick by him in his
reverses."</p>

<p>"Happy, happy man," I said, "to have a gentle
spirit like hers to console him."</p>

<p>I inquired after Mrs. Butler, and having obtained
her address, I bade Mr. Bargin good day,
and went in search of the old housekeeper. I
found her in the upper part of the city; she was
delighted at seeing me, and although she could tell
me many things about Georgiana and Mr. Marisett,
yet she could give me no information respecting
their present place of abode. Neither could I discover
from any other source the least clue to their
retreat.</p>

<p>I was occupied almost a week in settling my
affairs with Mr. Bargin; and after I had arranged
my business with him, I renewed my endeavors to
discover the retreat of those who were most dear
to me, but without success. The obstacle which
had previously existed, to prevent my union with
Miss De Lancey, was now, I hoped, removed; the
scales had fallen from my eyes, my tongue was
loosed, and my ears were unsealed. But I did
not repine that an obstacle still existed to prevent
that which I wished for so fervently; if we could
not be united here, I had a blissful hope that we
should be united hereafter. It was some consolation
to me to frequent those places which had been
hallowed by the presence of Georgiana; but most
of all, the abodes of poverty and wretchedness,
where I accompanied her when she went to dispense
her charities. I went in search, one day,
of the wretched hovel where I had seen her, from
my place of concealment, kneel down at the bed;
side of the dying woman, and pour out her soul
in prayer. The former occupants of the place
were gone, and its present tenants were hardly
less wretched. I gave them my mite, and left
them. As I came out of the narrow passage
which led into the hovel, I met a shabbily dressed
man, whose aspect had in it something of gentility,
notwithstanding his rags and dirt. As soon as
he perceived me, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Where in the world did you come from?
How are you; how do you do? I have called at
Mr. Stewpy's fifty times, but without ever seeing
you. Let Rome in Tiber melt."</p>

<p>It was the poet, the author of the ballad; he
opened his arms as if he would embrace me, but I
contented myself with a shake of the hand. He
did not look quite as respectable as he did when
I saw him last. His coal was more than thread
bare, and it was buttoned close up to his throat,
or rather pinned up, for the top buttons were all
gone; his gloves were ragged, and his boots were
heel-less; his cap, as usual, was drawn very much
over his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have been very anxious to see you," said
the poet; "I want to read you a serious composition
of mine. My ballad was criticized most awfully.
The fact is, sir, the age is not yet prepared
for those things; it is a sad thing to be in advance
of the age; it is much better for one's own comfort,
to be behind it. To be in advance of the
age, is to be an advanced guard; you are sure of
getting the first compliments of the enemy, while
those who are in the rear, or in the baggage
wagons, generally meet with a safe deliverance.
But I flatter myself I have this time got into the
main body of the army. I have taken to serious
writing; the world, I believe, is getting pious.
But this is an unpleasant place to talk in; we shall
get upset by a litter of pigs; let us walk in here
and sit down."</p>

<p>So saying, the poet led the way into a door,
over which was suspended an enormously large red
ball, on which was emblazoned the word
O&nbsp;Y&nbsp;S&nbsp;T&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;S.</p>

<p>This place was one of those licensed nurseries,
which are under the particular protection of the
Mayor and Aldermen of the city, and without
which the office of a police magistrate would soon
become a sinecure; black eyes and red noses
would soon go out of fashion, and perhaps fewer
heart-broken wives would be beaten by their husbands,
and fewer children starve, from the neglect
of their parents. But these are not matters of
much importance; a few thousands of men and
women cheated of their rightful happiness in this
world, and endangered in their prospects of happiness
hereafter, cannot materially affect the public
at large. The corporation derives a revenue
from licensing places of this kind, and the vote of
a brothel keeper is as good as a banker's.</p>

<p>Miserable, filthy abodes they are, where every
thing that is mean, and vicious, and brutalizing,
may be seen. Vice can hardly be said to spring
up in such places, for it must have attained to its
full growth before it could seek such a spot. The
whole aspect of the place which we entered, was
blear eyed; the atmosphere was impregnated with
the fumes of tobacco, mingled with a thousand
congenial odors; the inmates of the hole were
pale and sickly, and a young man, dressed in filthy
finery, was standing behind the bar to wait upon
customers. Mirth, cheerfulness, and good-fellowship,
were strangers here; and contentment, with
his honest face, and charity, with her open hands,
had never crossed the threshold of the door. A
placard, stuck upon the walls, conveyed the intelligence
that this was the democratic head quarters
of the ward.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Mister," said the poet, addressing
himself to the bar-keeper, "I am not going
to preach; I am not one of those pious individuals,
who having repented of his own sins, has
nothing to do but to rebuke the evil doings of
others;" and then turning to me, he said, "button
up your pockets, and keep your hand upon
your watch; these are none of your Bulwerian
scoundrels, who talk sentiment and pick your
pockets, but regular honest rascals, who pretend
to be no better than they really are."</p>

<p>The poet sat down, and taking off his cap,
drew therefrom a small roll of paper, and recited
the following lines, premising first, that he cared
nothing at all about newspaper critics.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" said the poet; "did not
all the great luminaries in the literary world attain
to their perihelion before the press itself had an
existence? and now the press sets up for a dispenser
of fame; but presumption is the sin of a
parvenu!"</p>

God's best bestowal, worthless all beside,<br/>

Earth's fairest flower, man's heart-enthroned queen,<br/>

Helpmeet and bride."</p>

<p>"Aught of this goodly earth,"<br/>

Thus spake the Eld; "to me was ne'er revealed,<br/>

By sense of sight, mine eyes were, at my birth,<br/>

In darkness sealed.</p>

<p>"Nought have I ever seen,<br/>

Not e'en the lineaments of my own race,<br/>

Never a look of love, nor, thought most keen!<br/>

A mother's face.</p>

<p>"But let not pity's sigh<br/>

For me be breathed, not pity's tear be shed,<br/>

Although I cannot see the bright blue sky<br/>

Above me spread.</p>

<p>"For God hath goodness shown,<br/>

In giving darkness for my portion here;<br/>

And distant glories to my faith made known<br/>

In visions clear.</p>

<p>"My soul awaits that day,<br/>

When the first object that my eyes shall see,&mdash;<br/>

My spirit freed from this all blinding clay,&mdash;<br/>

My God shall be."</p>

<p>As he repeated the concluding stanzas, to give
impressiveness to them, he struck his fist fiercely
on the table, which was in the centre of the room,
and with such force that he disturbed the dreamy
fancies of a man who had been snoring with his
head resting on a pile of newspapers; he started
up, and looking round, muttered a curse on the
intruder who had roused him from his sleep. The
voice startled me; I looked at the man&mdash;it was
my scornful cousin! But he was strangely altered
in his appearance; his dress was shabby, and
his face pale and haggard; his eyes were red, and
his long black hair gave him a singularly wild and
desperate look.</p>

<p>I could not help exclaiming, "can it be possible
that you have come to this!"</p>

<p>"Who is that," he cried, starting upon his feet;
"ha! is it you? What in the name of h&mdash;
brought you here?"</p>

<p>What a luxury it would have been to my evil
heart once, to have encountered him thus; but now
my pride of heart was gone; I no longer envied
him, and how could I exult over him in his degradation?
I could not, and my heart smote me
for having nursed a passion of hatred against him.
He was my cousin, and I could freely forgive him
the wrong he had done me. I advanced towards
him with my hand extended, but he caught hold
of a chair, and raising it above his head, said,
"don't come near me; don't lay the weight of
your finger upon me, or I will kill you this time."
And so saying, he would, perhaps, have put his
threat into execution; but the poet jumped in between
us, and the bar-keeper leaped over the bar
and caught hold of my arm, although I had not
made the slightest attempt at defence. A slight
scuffle ensued, which caused a mob of negroes
and noisy women to collect about the door, but
I contrived to extricate myself, and make my
escape, without any serious damage to my person,
although I suffered some in my clothes.</p>

<p>On my return to my lodgings, I found letters
from home; they were full of pleasant news, and
one of them, from my father, contained a considerable
remittance in bank bills. It appeared that,
notwithstanding the hard times, the improvements
in our village had been carried on; the track of a
railroad had been carried through my father's
garden, which had enhanced the value of his property
almost a hundred fold; a joint stock company
had purchased the family mansion, and altered
it into a classic temple, by adding a row of wooden
pillars and a pediment, and giving it a coat of
white paint; it had been christened Franco Hall,
and lithographed views of it were hung up in all
the taverns in the county, and my sister wrote that
it was to be in one of the annuals. My father had
suddenly become a man of consequence, and there
were rumors of his being nominated for Congress.
It is wonderful how soon a man's abilities are discovered,
when it is known that he has made a
fortunate speculation.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that I was not altogether
indifferent to this accession of wealth in the family,
for although the estimate which I once put upon
worldly prosperity was greatly reduced, I was
by no means insensible to the advantages which
a moderate competence confers; and more especially
at this time, I could not but reflect on the
happiness it would give me, if it should ever be
in my power to render any aid to my benefactor
and my friend. I hardly dared to trust myself to
think of Georgiana, for my heart bled at the bare
idea of her ever being in want.</p>

<p>The news I had received from home, made me
more anxious than ever to see my parents and my
sister, but I could not prevail upon myself to leave
New York until I had gained some intelligence of
Mr. Marisett and his niece; but week after week
wore away, and all my exertions proved fruitless.
At last I was on the point of abandoning the hope
of ever hearing from them again, when I discovered,
by a lucky accident, that Georgiana had inherited,
from a relation of her father's, a small estate
in North Carolina; thither I doubted not she had
gone with her uncle; in what part of the state her
property was located, I knew not, but I determined
on setting out immediately to discover. It was
enough for me to know that there was a probability
of her being in the state; it appeared an easy
matter to visit every town in it, and indeed every
house, until I discovered her. I told Mr. Bargin
of my intentions, and he endeavored to dissuade
me from attempting to carry my plan into execution.
He advised me to write to every post master
in the slate, and make inquiries concerning
them; but my heart yearned after them, and I
could not wait for so tedious a messenger as the
mail. A steamboat was to leave for Charleston in
the morning, and without heeding his advice, I
engaged a passage in her, intending to commence
at the southern extremity of the state, and so travel
northwards on horseback, until I should meet with
the object of my search. Assuredly it was a wild
undertaking; but any thing would have seemed
reasonable and easy of performance, if Georgiana
had been the object to be obtained by its accomplishment.</p>

<div id="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>A Storm and a Wreck.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was late in the fall, and the steamboat was
crowded with Southerners, returning to their rice
fields and cotton plantations, after having spent
the warm months at the north; there were also
many adventurers going in search of wealth, and
many invalids going in search of health at the
south. But they were all lively, and we left the
Hook behind us with colors flying and music playing,
as though we were bound on a holiday excursion.
When the sun went down, however, the
hilarity of some of the observing among the passengers
was in a measure checked, by the almost
certain indication which the sky presented of a
coming storm. For myself, I watched a barometer*
which hung in the companion way, and
although I perceived it fell suddenly, I had no
fears, for the boat was new; it had been pronounced
staunch and sea-worthy by those who pretended
to be knowing in such matters; and I knew it
would be an easy matter to make a port if it should
be necessary. And so having commended my soul
to God, and invoked his protection, I lay down to
rest. But the wind continued to increase, and before
morning the boat had worked so hard as to
cause her to leak; but still there was no serious
cause for alarm. Some of the passengers, who had
never been at sea before, began to grow fearful,
and they begged the captain to put back, or to
make a port, until the storm should be over; but
I could not endure the thought of being retarded
in my progress, and I begged him to proceed, for
I could see no danger; he was an old sailor, and
having encountered many harder storms than this
threatened to be, he listened to my persuasions,
and laughed at the fears of the others, and avowed
his determination to proceed on his voyage at all
hazards. So we continued on our course that day;
but the next day the storm increased, the leak, or
leaks, grew worse and worse, and fear and consternation
were visible in every countenance. The
boat was slightly constructed, and we began to be
convinced that green and white paint are very indifferent
substitutes for strong oak ribs and stout
hanging knees. Owing to her very great length,
and the weight of her machinery, she worked very
heavily; every sea that struck her apparently
opened another seam, and at every revolution of
the wheels, some part of the machinery gave way.
It was with great difficulty that the fires were kept
up, and almost every man on board was engaged
in helping to bale the water out of the hold. It was
a dismal day. But the distracted passengers heeded
neither the storm, the cold, nor the wet, but
weary and exhausted though they were, they gave
all their strength to assist in freeing themselves
from the dangers which threatened them; the fear
of death took possession of their hearts, and urged
them to deeds which they never knew before they
were capable of performing.</p>

<p><i>[*Transcriber's Note:  here the edition reads
"thermometer"&mdash;given that the author was himself
once a sailor, and would certainly know better, this
may well have been an unconscious error, which the
editor failed to catch.]</i></p>

<p>Night began to approach, and with its dark shadows
came darker fears, that we should never more
look upon the light of another day. The wind
continued to increase, and even the captain began
to show signs of fear, storm-nurtured though
he was, and familiar as he had been all his life
with the ways of the winds and the waves; the
shrieks and groans of the afflicted wretches
around him, and the dismal creaking and cracking
and snapping of beams and stanchions, made
his heart quake.</p>

<p>Soon after dark, one of the wheel ropes parted;
and before it could be spliced, or a tiller shipped,
the boat broached to, and shipped an overwhelming
sea, which carried away the wheelhouse,
filled the hold half full of water, and completely
extinguished the fires. We were now
completely at the mercy of the winds and waves;
the pitchy darkness of the night was only relieved
by the white foam of the sea, as it broke
around us and over us, which enabled me to
catch a glimpse of the haggard faces of the poor
creatures who crowded the decks, as the dim
phosphorescent light shone on them; the wind
had continued to increase in violence until it blew
so hard, it was difficult to hear those speak who
stood close by my side. For my own part, I gave
up all hope; but others, those who were the first
to fear, now that destruction appeared inevitable,
would not believe that <i>they</i> could be lost; they
still looked up to the captain, and trusted in his
experience; but their hold on him was soon let
go, for he was too good a sailor not to know that
our situation was hopeless, and he took up his
speaking trumpet, and announced the dread tidings
through its brazen throat. "In another
hour," he said, "the boat will either be at the
bottom or on the beach." Aloud and bitter wail,
rising above the howling wind and the roaring
waters, followed this announcement; and many
leaped overboard in the agony of their fears, and
some put heavy weights in their pockets, that
when they should be in the water, their struggles
might soon be at an end.</p>

<p>"If there is a parson on board," roared the
captain, through his speaking trumpet, "he
might about as well pray for us, and be quick
about it too, for he will soon have his mouth full
of salt water." But no one answered this invitation
of the captain; and as I was composed and
calm, having a glorious hope of peace beyond
this life, I felt called upon to say something to
those about me. I therefore secured myself by
clinging to the railing round the main mast, and
raising my voice as loud as I could, I succeeded
in arresting the attention of a few. The precise
words that I made use of, I do not now remember,
but they were something like the following: "In
a few short moments, my dear fellow sufferers, we
shall all be enshrouded in the white foam of these
heaving waves, which are now roaring and dashing
around us, as if impatient of the merciful delay
which keeps us from them. I know the
thoughts which fill your minds now; they are
of eternity, and of Him who inhabits eternity; for
what other thoughts can enter the mind at a time
like this. Our bodies are sure to be lost; our
souls may be saved. There is one hope on which
we may rest, and but one. We cannot he saved
by our own good deeds now, for there is no time
left for their performance. Charity will avail
nothing now, for there are none here in want of
the little we have to bestow; we cannot do good
to those who have injured us; they are not here
to be witnesses of our obedience. If, then, we
are to be saved, it must be by the righteousness
of another, and not of ourselves. God has promised
that all who believe shall be saved; have
faith, then, in Christ, his son, by whose righteousness
we may secure our salvation. Believe
and repent; there is no time to demur; if you
have objections to urge to this plan of redemption,
they must remain unanswered until the
dread reality itself shall silence all doubts. Do
not despair; although the time is short, it is long
enough for repentance; remember the thief on
the cross, who, as his life's blood gushed from
his heart, with his heart believed, and was saved."</p>

<p>I could say no more; the water beat in my face
with such violence, I could not utter another
word; but the captain again took up his speaking
trumpet, and called out, "you hear the news
there, men; so bear a hand, and take the gentleman's
advice."</p>

<p>A loud, long, continued roar, different from
that caused by the wind and the sea, now broke
upon the ear, and an appearance to leeward like a
high white bank, seen dimly through the darkness,
revealed the cause; it was the breakers. Our
small boats had been stove in at the commencement
of the storm, and we were possessed of no
possible means of escape. Feeling certain that
my time was come, and that I must very soon enter
on that state of existence for which I had an
undimmed hope of being prepared by the atonement
of one who is mighty to save, I strove to
give myself up to solemn reflections and prayer,
but my voice was drowned in the roar of the elements,
and my attention was continually excited
by the sufferings and appeals of those about me.
A woman who was going, with two infant children,
to meet her husband at the south, had been seated
all the night upon deck, with her two little ones
clasped to her breast, seemingly unconscious of the
storm which beat upon her head. It was wonderful
to see one so slight and delicate in her frame,
capable of such great endurance. But now when
the cry went round that we were approaching the
breakers, fear or despair roused her, and leaving
her children upon the deck, she caught hold of
my arms as I passed her, and shrieked wildly. I
tried to sooth her, but in vain; I spoke to her of
her children, but still she clung to me, and raved
fearfully. Suddenly the shrill voices of her little
ones caught her ear, and she released her hold of
my arm, and I never saw her again. A young
man rushed out of the cabin with a life-preserver
in his hand, and throwing it towards me, he ran
to the after part of the boat, and him I never saw
again.</p>

<p>The boat soon struck and heeled over towards
the beach, and every sea that broke over her bore
away part of our number. I looked about for the
man who had thrown me his life-preserver, but I
could not find him, and so I fastened it under my
arms, and climbed up to the top of the belfry, where
the waves broke with less force. Many of the
passengers, the captain among the number, lashed
themselves to the taffrail, but the third or fourth
breach that the sea made over us carried away the
stern part of the boat, and they were seen no more.
Knowing that certain destruction would be the
consequence of lashing myself to the wreck, I determined
to make an attempt to reach the shore,
before my strength should be exhausted by exposure.
I leaped overboard, and as I struck out my
arms, I felt confident of reaching the shore. Every
wave carried me nearer and nearer; I barely kept
myself afloat, reserving my strength for an effort
when I should reach the shore, knowing the difficulty
of keeping a footing on the beach when the water
receded. At length I was thrown upon the
strand, but as I was not expecting it, before I
could recover myself, I was drawn back into the
breakers, my eyes and mouth filled with sand.
Again I was thrown upon the beach, and succeeded
in keeping a hold, but before I could crawl away
another wave broke over me, the treacherous sand
sunk from beneath me, and I was again drawn
back, exhausted and almost spent. But the next
wave took me upon its breast, and threw me high
upon the beach; as it receded, I made a desperate
effort, and succeeded in clinging to the bank of
sand; the next wave broke short over me, and before
another came, I had time to crawl away to a
place of safety. I looked back upon the sea, but
I could perceive nothing but the white foam.
There was no one near me. I listened, but I could
hear nothing but the roar of the waves. Daylight
was just beginning to break, and I was anxious to
look for help for my companions, but cold and
over-exertion had exhausted my powers; I tried to
stand, but my head reeled, and I tell senseless to
the earth.</p>

<p>I slept sound and long, but was at length
roused by the sound of familiar voices; they
seemed to come from along way off, as though
they were speaking to me from the past, or calling
me into the future; but, partly opening my eyes,
I perceived there were well known forms bending
over me. I was in bed. My head burned dreadfully,
and I felt sore and feverish. I thought I
had just awoke, after the attack which was made
upon me by the assassin, when I was on my way
to Mr. Marisett's house. What horrible dreams
had in a brief space rushed through my mind!
Could it he possible that such a lapse of time had
been compressed into a moment. How vivid my
dreams had been. I still thought I could hear the
shriek of my seeming dream-companions struggling
with the fierce waves. Surely I had not
been dreaming. I opened my eyes again&mdash;Georgiana
and her uncle were both near me. Yes, it
was a dream that had frightened me. But where
was good Mrs. Butler; it was not like her to be
absent when I was sick. I called for her, and
Georgiana uttered a piercing shriek; I was frightened,
and said, or tried to say: "don't be alarmed,
Miss De Lancey, it is only a flesh wound, I am not
dangerously hurt." But the exertion was too
great, and I sunk into forgetfulness again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p>The last.</p>

</div>

<p>WRITERS of fiction possess an immense advantage
over the mere narrator of actual occurrences,
in being able to preserve an artist-like unity
in the occurrence of events, and also of confining
their narrative within the circumference of the
probabilities. And to this, mainly, I conceive,
fiction is indebted for its general success. Nature,
it must be confessed, is sometimes <i>outr&eacute;</i> in
the extreme; but art generally contrives to render
herself extremely natural. The honest historian,
and particularly the historian of one's own adventures,
frequently has the mortification of knowing
that, while he makes record of that which he
knows to be true, he incurs the risk of being set
down, by the public, as an outrageous romancer.
I have more than once repented, since I wrote the
first chapter of this history, the straitness of my
resolution, which does not allow me to introduce
enough of fiction in these pages to give a naturalness
to the whole.</p>

<p>It was many days after I was cast ashore, before
I was sufficiently recovered to be able fully
to comprehend the situation in which I was placed.
And even now, I can, at times, hardly
realize, that the adventures which I have related,
were not all a troubled dream; but there are
too many evidences of their truth around me, to allow
of my remaining long a skeptic.</p>

<p>The reverses of fortune had come upon Mr.
Marisett so heavily, and in such rapid succession,
that he was unable to withstand their repeated
shocks. His spirit broke, although his mind remained
entire. Being without wife or children,
he wanted those powerful incentives to action
which have sustained weaker men under difficulties
more trying. He was tired of the world, at
least that portion of it which had witnessed his former
condition; but being restrained by dim religious
perceptions, from rushing uncalled into
the presence of his Judge, he resolved to seek a
secluded resting place, and there await his summons
to depart; and nowhere could he do that
so well as in the place which necessity pointed out
to him, even though inclination had not.</p>

<p>Georgiana inherited from her mother a considerable
estate on the sea coast, in North Carolina;
and when she heard of her uncle's determination
to retire from the world, she offered him
this place for an asylum, upon the condition of
his allowing her to accompany and reside there
with him. He at first refused; but finding her
resolute, he at last consented, and thither she accompanied
him. When they arrived on the estate,
they found no other habitation on it than a
very small hut, built in the slightest manner, of
no more durable materials than cypress shingles.
But with the assistance of a slave whom they hired
of a neighbor, they soon put it in habitable
order. They found themselves surrounded by a
rude, but kind and hospitable, people. Mr. Marisett
found what he sought, solitude; and Georgiana
seeing him satisfied, was herself contented.</p>

<p>They had been living quietly, and all unknown,
if not happily, for some months, in this
secluded spot, when I was cast ashore, as already
described in the last chapter, within two miles of
their dwelling; a spot so little frequented, that it
is probable I should have passed it by, had I been
permitted to follow up my intentions of visiting
every town in the State, until I should gain some
intelligence of Georgiana and her uncle. It appeared
that the violence of the storm during the
night, had caused Mr. Marisett to go down to the
sea shore as soon as it was light, to see if any
vessels had been cast ashore during the night, and
there he found me stretched out upon the beach,
and perceiving signs of life, he procured assistance,
and had me taken to his hut; and he and
Georgiana had been all the morning endeavoring
to revive me, without any suspicion of who I was.
When I opened my eyes, and called for Mrs. Butler,
Georgiana recognised my voice, and uttering
a piercing scream, she fell into a swoon, from
which she was with difficulty restored.</p>

<p>Georgiana and myself being thus thrown, once
more, miraculously together, and the obstacle
which had formerly prevented our union being
removed, it would have been tempting the Providence
which had preserved us for each other, had
we longer delayed our marriage. As soon as my
health was sufficiently restored, this happy event
was consummated; and then, by our joint entreaties,
we succeeded in prevailing on Mr. Marisett
to accompany us back to New York, and from
thence to Franco Ville, where we still live in the
enjoyment of blessings innumerable.</p>

<p>I have now reached the point, beyond which,
gentle reader, you cannot accompany me; and
although I hope you do not willingly part from
me, I must deny myself from ever meeting you
again. But as your curiosity may have been excited
towards some of those whom I have incidentally
mentioned, I will here state all that I know
concerning them.</p>

<p>My cousin was reduced to extreme poverty, by
his speculations in real estate; he became very intemperate
in his habits, and wanting the means to
sustain life, he put an end to his own existence,
thus making the end himself, that he had predicted
for me.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Wellington Worhoss also failed in his
real estate operations, but being above suicide, he
became a member of the board of Brokers, and he
may be seen any sun shiny day, between the hours
of ten and two, with a long marble colored book
under his arm, elbowing his way through the
crowd of well dressed gentlemen who monopolize
the side walks of Wall street.</p>

<p>Mr. Dooitt had the misfortune to make oath to
a statement before the Vice Chancellor, concerning
the conveyance of some property, which, on
investigation, did not prove to be strictly true;
and for that trifling mistake, he is now quarrying
marble at an unmentionable place, on the banks
of the Hudson.</p>

<p>My good friend, Jerry Bowhorn, has joined the
temperance society, and got to be mate of a Liverpool
packet, with a fair prospect of being made
captain; and if that event should ever take place,
I will venture to predict, he will have many complimentary
pieces of plate, and innumerable votes
of thanks, and silver snuff boxes, presented to him,
by his passengers. It is needless to add, that he
is a great comfort to his mother.</p>
