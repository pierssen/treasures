<h1>THE SECOND SON.</h1>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p class="small">THE FAMILY AT MELCOMBE.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. MITFORD of Melcombe had three sons. His
estates lay in one of the richest of the midland
counties, and they were not entailed. His house
was not very imposing nor beautiful in itself, being
of comparatively recent erection, and built at a period
when comfort within was more considered than beauty
without. It was low, no more than two stories in
height, but spreading over a wide area, with a long
garden front which permitted a very handsome suite
of rooms; delightful to live in, though without architectural
pretensions of any kind. Though the house
was so recent, the Mitfords had been at Melcombe
for as many centuries as were necessary to establish
their claims as county gentry of high position, and
had met with those misfortunes which are almost as
indispensable as success and prosperity to the thorough
establishment of an old race. They had suffered
more or less in the Jacobite rebellions, their house had
been burnt down more than once, they had given
their family valuables to the king when he was at Oxford.
These circumstances made the fact that their
house was new and ugly, their plate a little scanty,

<!-- page 2 -->

their jewels defective, rather a point of pride than
of humiliation for the family. It was also rather a
feather in their cap that the entail embraced only a
very small portion of their possessions; for had it not
been broken in haste during the eighteenth century,
in order to leave the heir free to follow Prince Charlie
without ruining the family in case the Hanoverians
should hold, as happened, the winning side?</p>

<p>This step, however, is a very important one, when
the family, and not the individual possessor, is taken
into view. It is generally supposed that the law of
natural justice requires the abrogation of all such
restrictions as those involved in laws of primogeniture
and entail. But there are, as usual with most
human questions, two ways of looking at this matter.
If you have made a great deal of money, it is only
right that you should have the power of dividing it
among your descendants, or (which is still another
view) giving it to whom you choose. But when an
inheritance has been handed down to you by your
fathers and grandfathers in succession, the natural
justice runs all the other way. Then it becomes a
breach of right to contradict the purpose with which
it was constituted, the limitations under which you received
it, since it is not your property at all save in
trust. But this is neither the moment nor the place
for a treatise upon the English laws of succession.
Mr. Mitford was a man who had a great idea of his
rights as an individual, and he was the third in succession
who had held the estates of Melcombe entirely in
his own hands.</p>

<p>His three sons were Roger, Edmund, and Stephen.
The eldest son, notwithstanding the power of disinheritance
which was in his father's hands, had been

<!-- page 3 -->

brought up as eldest sons usually are, without any
alarm as to his future, or idea that under any possibility
he could be displaced from his natural position.
He had been in the Guards in his youth, and had
passed that blossoming portion of his existence without
any discredit, if also without any special use. He
had withdrawn, however, from a life somewhat too
expensive for his allowance and circumstances some
years before the beginning of this history, and, with
occasional absences for pleasure or adventure, lived at
home, managing as much of the business of the estate
as his father permitted to pass out of his own hands,
looking after the stables, hunting a little, and finding
enough to occupy him in that busy idleness of country
life which is so seductive and looks so much like important
work when the doer of it has nothing else to
do. Roger was not, however, ignorant of what men
have to do in regions where existence is less easy. He
had been, as people say, a great deal about the world.
He had taken that round which to young men of the
present day stands in the place of the grand tour
which their forefathers took with more or less advantage
in the way of culture and art. He had been all
over America, he was still part owner of a Californian
ranche, he had touched at Japan, and he knew
familiarly many a place which, a generation ago, only
sailors by profession or merchants' clerks knew anything
about. How much good all these varied experiences
had done him it would be hard to say, but they
had at least contributed with many other influences to
form the man.</p>

<p>Edmund, the second son, was of a very different
mould. He was one of those who are untraveled, and
have not knocked about or roughed it, as it is the

<!-- page 4 -->

fashion to do; that is to say, he knew Europe and the
great countries which have marched with his own
through the comparatively modern levels of history,
and he knew books and rather more art than was good
for him. He had a mild little fortune of his own, derived
from his mother; the just enough which is supposed
to be very bad for a young man by inducing him
to believe that it is unnecessary to do anything for
himself, but which the present writer takes the liberty
of believing is sometimes very good for a young man,
keeping him out of the ranks of the struggling without
that sense of guilt and helplessness which must
always characterize the ineffectiveness of the poor.
Edmund cared little for game, great or small; he was
not interested in savage life, whether that of the
hunter, or the cattle owner, or the aboriginal, though
more in the last than in the first. He was a man
somewhat without motive in the world, reading a great
deal, wandering more or less, writing a little, musing
much. His musings did not come to anything to
speak of; indeed, there was supposed to be little use
in him of any kind. He could not even lay claim to
that high reputation in the way of bricabrac which,
for a dilettante such as he allowed himself to be, is
a kind of salvation. Whether it was indolence, or
whether it was that he had no conviction of the importance
of Japanese fans and China plates in decoration,
he had not made much even of the rooms which
had been given up to him at home. They were hung
only with pictures and water-color sketches, some of
which were done by his own hand, without a fan
among them, or any other barbaric "bit of color." He
did not come up to his possibilities even in that respect.
His presence or absence did not tell very much

<!-- page 5 -->

upon the house. It is true that most of the inhabitants
at Melcombe were glad to have him there; but
those very qualities which made everybody pleased to
see him diminished the importance of his going away.
He gave so little trouble that no one missed him,
though when he was at home the fact that he gave
little trouble was his highest praise.</p>

<p>Stephen was the one who turned the house upside
down, when he appeared. He was a soldier, with his
regiment, spending only his intervals of leave (and
not always those) at Melcombe. But no one could be
under any doubt on the subject when Stephen was at
home. He had everything altered to suit his pleasure;
even Mr. Mitford, who never departed from his rules,
was unconsciously thrust out of them on Stephen's return,
and thought nothing of it. This not because
he was the favorite. He could not be said to be the
favorite. He was too noisy, too imperious, for that
part. He had not the sweetness, the persuasiveness,
which procures one of a family his own way. He got
the upper hand because he insisted upon it. None of
the others felt themselves able to oppose Stephen. As
for Edmund, he shrunk at once from any controversy,
feeling that he must go to the wall; and Roger would
give in with a growl, saying in his mustache that the
fellow was not here for long, or else&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Mitford
yielded with a still worse grace, but he did yield also,&mdash;chiefly
because he felt it undignified to engage in
any strife unless he was certain to be victorious, and
that could never be certain when it was Stephen who
was the antagonist. Stephen did not mind in the least
what weapons he used. He would speak of his father's
age in a way which made Mr. Mitford furious. "I
don't want to disturb you, sir, at your time of life.

<!-- page 6 -->

One knows, of course, that habit is more than second
nature with old people." "Who the deuce do you
mean by your old people?" Mr. Mitford would shout
in a passion, conscious of being only sixty-seven, and
well out of sight yet of the threescore and ten years.
The servants invariably flew to execute Mr. Stephen's
orders. Anything for a quiet life, they said. And
thus it was that without going out of his course to
conciliate anybody, or troubling himself about making
it up to them, Stephen got most things his own way.
He was, perhaps, the handsomest of his family, as
features and merely physical attributes go. He was
taller than his brothers, he was better at all out-door
pursuits; or perhaps it was because he always said he
was the best that everybody thought so. Then he had
reputation of being open-handed and liberal, because
people who are so noisy and impulsive generally
are as careless of money as they are of other people's
comfort&mdash;or at least it is usual to think so. Stephen
is so thoughtless, everybody said; you don't expect
Stephen to remember little precautions, or to curry
favor: but at bottom he's the most good-natured fellow!
He doesn't pretend to be clever, but he sticks
to his friends like a good one, the gentlemen said.
He's a little rough, but then he's so very good-natured,
said the ladies. So Stephen went on steadily
thinking of nothing but how to please himself. There
is no branch of human industry in which perseverance
is more sure of its reward.</p>

<p>There were daughters in the Mitford family, but
they had never been taken much into account. The
mother had died young, and no feminine head of the
house had ever succeeded her. There was an excellent
housekeeper, Mrs. Simmons, who devoted herself

<!-- page 7 -->

to the boys, but thought young ladies were best in the
school-room, and kept the governesses at a haughty
distance. The young ladies were timid girls, who
were frightened of their brothers, and thought Mrs.
Simmons quite right. Somehow or other, nobody
quite knew how, two of them married out of that
school-room, and escaped into what we must hope was
a better life. One little girl was still left at home.
Her name was Katherine, but she had not the vigor
which that name implies. To have called her Kate
would have been impossible, or even Katie. The universal
sense of those who knew her averted this false
nomenclature by calling her Nina, supposed to be a
contraction of the last syllable of her name, as it is of
so many names. She was nearly eighteen at the period
to which I am referring; a pretty enough little girl,
looking much younger than her age, and with a constantly
apologetic tone about her, as if she had no
business to be in the way, or show herself in superior
male society,&mdash;which, to tell the truth, she did very
little. The last governess had departed some time
before: governesses had not been welcome in the Mitford
family, nor had they been happy; and in what
way Nina had been educated, or her sisters before her,
nobody knew. It was supposed that they could read
and write, and it was known (by the nuisance it was)
that they could play badly upon a well-thumped school-room
piano, out of which more noise than music was
got. After the governess departed, Nina was more
often visible than she had been before. The humblest
of little apologetic girls cannot live in a school-room
all alone. If there had been no other reason against
it, there was this reason, that it was now nobody's
business to carry up tea to that secluded place. The

<!-- page 8 -->

school-room maid had gone along with the governess,
and when this dilemma was reported to Mrs. Simmons
her deliverance was very decisive. "It is high time
Miss Nina came down to dinner," she said, although
on a former occasion she had protested that the
school-room was the proper place for young ladies.
This proves that even the housekeeper was not always
consistent; but then, in the present case, tea in the
school-room instead of dinner down-stairs had the air
of being a privilege for Nina, a thing that evidently
could not be. When it was thus settled that she
should make her appearance at dinner, Nina learned
to show herself much more down-stairs during the day.
She was all alone, poor little thing; there was nobody
to talk with up-stairs, or with whom to exchange those
innocent little secrets which belong to girlhood. She
was very heart-sick with longing for her sisters, and
for Miss Beaumont, who had been kind, and even for
Mattie, the little school-room maid. Had she been
left, the deserted girl would in all likelihood have
formed a very unsuitable but devoted friendship with
Mattie; or she might have fallen in love with the
gardener, or done something of a desperate kind.
Mrs. Simmons saved her by issuing that recommendation,
which was as good as an order. Nina did not
like it at first, but afterwards she got to like it. She
was a pretty little creature. She was very anxious to
please. And when any one walked into the drawing-room,
which had hitherto been empty, save on great
occasions, and became aware of a little startled movement,
and the raising of a pair of half-frightened eyes,
and the flutter of a frock which seemed ready to flutter
out of sight on the faintest indication that it was in
the way, the spectacle soon came to be quite an agreeable
thing.</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>The sitting-rooms of the house were <i>en suite</i>. There
was first a library occupying the corner, with windows
on two sides, then a large drawing-room, then a small
one, and at the other corner the dining-room. The
whole line of rooms was lighted at night. The drawing-rooms
served only the purpose of a passage from
the library at one end to the banquet at the other.
But the flutter of Nina's frock changed this arrangement,
and made the silent passage room into a little
centre of domestic life, more pleasant than the heavy
library, which was lined with books and hung with
heavy curtains, as became the abode of knowledge and
masculine mental occupation. It may be doubted,
perhaps, whether Mr. Mitford ever discussed a question
more profound than how to gain a little upon his
new leases, or keep back a little from the new buildings
and repairs which his farmers demanded. But
these are questions very serious in their way, and the
library was grave enough in appearance to be tenanted
by a bishop. The young men and their father, not
always on the best of terms with each other, formed a
sufficiently gloomy procession when they came from
under the shade of the dark velvet portiere, marching
along to dinner, four tall men, and not a smiling face.
When first Nina's white frock had been seen to rise
timidly from one of the sofas it made a sensation in
the group. "What are you doing here at this hour?"
Mr. Mitford said to his daughter, somewhat gruffly.
"Please, papa, Miss Beaumont has gone," said Nina,
trembling a little. "To be sure," he said, mollified
by her wistful look, and offered his daughter his arm.
How Nina had trembled as she took that formidable
arm! She was ready to sink into the earth one minute,
and the next could not help saying to herself,

<!-- page 10 -->

"Oh, that Mrs. Simmons could see me!" For though
it was the housekeeper who had been the cause of this
bold step, she had not intended it to be to Nina's advantage;
nor had it ever occurred to her that her
master, who was so little careful of the girls, should,
on seeing this little one, with her downcast eyes, trembling
before him, have remembered that little Nina was
a lady, and offered her his majestic arm.</p>

<p>By and by, dating from this time, a change came
about in the domestic arrangements at Melcombe.
Edmund was the first who forsook the gloomy assembly
in the library, and went to Nina in the drawing-room
when the gong sounded for dinner; and at last
it came to this, that Mr. Mitford issued alone out of
the library door, and found his three sons, in their
black coats, all gathered round Nina, as if she somehow,
who was nobody, only the youngest and a girl,
had become a sort of head in the house. She did not,
however, rise to the occasion. Nor did Roger, to
whom his father left it to give the little lady his arm,
give over to her the head of the table, which had been
his place since she was a baby. She sat at her brother's
right hand, as if she had been a little guest. It
would have appeared absurd to all of them to put this
little thing, though they all liked her well enough, in
the place of the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Such were the Mitfords and their house and family
at the time when this episode of their story begins.</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<div class="center" id="II">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p class="small">THEIR NEIGHBORS.</p>

</div>

<p>NEIGHBORS, as everybody knows, are vastly more
important in the country than they can be in town.
The Mitfords were not people who kept much company;
indeed, the female element being so entirely
suppressed as it was, they can scarcely be said to have
kept any company at all. They had parties of men
in the house in September, and sometimes at other
periods, when an election or some great public event
occurred in the country; or in the race week at Beaulieu,
when everybody is expected, more or less, to entertain.
It might perhaps have been on these occasions
that the elder girls met their respective husbands;
but the matches were all made in neighboring
houses, never at home. And speaking of society,
there was none at Melcombe, for who would call a
shooting party, or a collection of men gathered together
for any one distinct male object, society? But
the neighborhood was, as everybody said, distinctly
sociable and friendly. The nearest house, of course,
was the Rectory, and the nearest neighbors were clerical.
How it is that the English gentry should for
so many centuries have suffered the existence at their
very door of households fraught with peril to their
younger members is a question which has not passed
without previous discussion, that we should introduce
it head and shoulders here without warning. It is

<!-- page 12 -->

one of the highest proofs of the sincerity of religious
principle and faith in the national church which a
body of excellent but perhaps not remarkably spiritual-minded
persons could give. The Rectory is almost
always at the Squire's park gates; it is nearer
than any other house. In, say, six cases out of ten,
it is full of sons and daughters about the same ages
as the Squire's sons and daughters; young people
evidently quite as good in every way, but probably
not at all rich, or likely to increase by connection or
otherwise the greatness of his house. The sons, young
fellows getting afloat in the professions, or scuffling
through the long vacation as best they can between
the Hall, which is the chief house in the parish, and
the clerical house, which is the second,&mdash;what a danger
for the Squire's daughters, probably just at the
impressionable age, and not yet competent to judge
of the advantages of a good match! And the girls,
still more dangerous, innocent man-traps laid in the
very sight of an indignant father! Sometimes the
familiarity in which the two sets of young people
have grown up, calling each other by their Christian
names, and assuming almost brotherly and sisterly relationships,
is a safeguard; but not always&mdash;for this
sort of fraternal relation often expands into something
nearer and dearer.</p>

<p>The Mitfords were exceptionally fortunate, however,
in their clerical family. The Rector of Melcombe
had but two children: the daughter (providentially)
older than any of the Mitford boys; the
son younger even than Nina, which was more than
could have been hoped for. The Rector was of a
Jersey family, and his name was spelt Le Mesurier,
as no doubt it ought to have been pronounced; but

<!-- page 13 -->

as a matter of fact he was called Lemeasurer, as if it
were one word, and he never objected to the mispronunciation.
Miss Lemesurier was the housekeeper,
nay, the head of the house, at the Rectory. Her
mother had died long before. Miss Lemesurier was
approaching forty, and she was by far the best curate
her father had ever had. Not only did all the external
affairs of the parish pass through her hands, but
most of the spiritual too. She was a large woman,
larger than her father, and overshadowing him both
mentally and bodily. She had a great deal of fair
hair, somewhat sandy, but which in its day had been
celebrated as gold, and this was her chief external
distinction. She wore it in an old-fashioned way, in
large massive braids, so that it could never be ignored,
and was a conspicuous part of her somewhat imposing
personality. Her name, it was believed, was Patience,
but she had never been known as anything but Pax,
though the origin of that cognomen was lost in the
mists of antiquity. The Rectory, withdrawn among
its trees, had a dignified and impressive appearance,
with the spire of Melcombe old church rising beyond
it into peaceful blue skies flecked with English
cloud, and scarcely stained by the village smoke. But
through an opening in these trees, Pax Lemesurier,
from where she sat at her favorite window, commanded
the gate of the great house, and saw everybody
who went and came. Nature had at first afforded
this facility, but it was kept up by art. She had the
opening carefully preserved and trimmed, so that no
intrusive bough should ever shut that prospect out.</p>

<p>This was the nearest female neighbor our Squire's
family had. Naturally, as she was several years older
than the Mitfords, two of them in succession had

<!-- page 14 -->

fallen in love with Pax. It had been a short affair
with Roger, who had learned better after his first
period of service with his regiment. But Edmund
had held by it a long time, and would have brought it
to the crisis of marriage if Pax would have listened to
him; but she was not that kind of woman. Marrying,
she declared at once, was not in her way. She
had a house of her own, as much as any married
woman had, and a great deal more independence, and
to change this free and full life for that of a younger
son's wife, watching her husband's countenance to
keep him in good humor, and conciliating his father
that he might increase their allowance, was a sort of
thing to which nothing would make her submit,&mdash;"nothing,
at least, with which I am at present acquainted,"
Pax said. "Of course such a thing might
happen as that I should fall in love." She said this
with such gravity that everybody laughed, putting
aside, as it were, a margin for future possibilities.
At the moment, Edmund was very angry and offended
by this speech, which showed how entirely that
specific was out of the question in his own case; but
in the end he learned to laugh, too.</p>

<p>Another notable member of the neighboring society
may best be introduced to the reader as she appeared
in Pax's drawing-room, one spring morning,
having ridden over to see her friend from her own
house, which was quite near as country calculations
go, being about five miles off. This young lady was
a person of great importance in the circle round Melcombe.
She was an heiress, not only of money, but
of a delightful and highly prosperous estate; and
though her name was not of much account, and her
connection with the district recent, no one could have

<!-- page 15 -->

a finer position than Elizabeth Travers, to whom all
the greatest families in the neighborhood, possessing
sons, showed the utmost attention. She was not in
her teens, like the usual heroines of romance, but in
her twenties, which is very different, and had seen a
good deal of the world. It would be impossible to
pretend that she was unaware of the position she
held, and the great advantages, as people say, which
she possessed. As these advantages were evidently
not hers, but those of her wealth, she was not proud
of them, but occasionally, indeed, a little bitter, like
a woman who felt herself wronged, although she got
nothing but compliments and worship. Her position
was so far peculiar that she had inherited all this from
an uncle, recently dead, who out of some abstract impression
of justice, believing that Elizabeth's father
had laid the foundations of the fortune which he did
not live to enjoy, had left everything to his niece,
with but a slender provision for the insipid, delicate
invalid wife whom he left behind. Mrs. Travers had
been kept in ignorance of this arrangement, which
had taken even her own house from her. It was the
one thing upon which Elizabeth insisted. The poor
lady was told that Elizabeth was the final heir, and
that it was not in her power to leave anything away
from her husband's niece, who had always lived with
her, and of whom in reality she was both fond and
proud. Mrs. Travers, all unsuspicious of the truth,
had shed a few tears over even this disability. "If
there had been only ten thousand, my dear," she said,
"which I could have called my own! Of course I
should have left the most of it to you. He need not,
I'm sure, have ever supposed that I would leave it
away from you; but to think I could do what I liked

<!-- page 16 -->

with it, and leave a few legacies when I passed away,
would have been a pleasure. I don't know why your
uncle should have had so little faith in me, my dear."</p>

<p>"It was not that he had little faith in you, dear
aunt. Besides, you have more than ten thousand
pounds, I am sure. And whatever legacies you wish
to leave, you may be certain that they will be paid,"
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Travers shook her head, declaring that
what she wished was not any such assurance, but only
that, to show his trust in her, he had left her something
which she could have considered as her very own.
This was quite as great a grievance to the poor lady
as if she had known the real state of the case, which
Elizabeth, with so much trouble, and even at the cost
of a fib or two (but it was the lawyers who told them,
and that did not matter), so carefully concealed from
her. Thus they lived together; Mrs. Travers ordering
everything as if it were her own, and believing it
so to be, with Elizabeth, her dependent, in the house.
She treated her niece as if she had been her daughter,
it must be allowed, but now and then would exhibit
little caprices of proprietorship, and debar her
from the use of a horse or a carriage. "It may be
yours to do what you like with after I die, but it's
mine as long as I live," she would say pettishly, notwithstanding
that the house and everything in it,
the carriages and horses, were Elizabeth's, and not
hers at all. This assertion of rights had been of
little importance while the two ladies led a secluded
life of mourning, after the death of the head of the
house; but that period was about ending, and Elizabeth's
embarrassments and difficulties were likely to
increase. It was upon this subject, with perhaps some

<!-- page 17 -->

others underneath, that she had now come to unburden
her heart.</p>

<p>Miss Lemesurier sat in her usual chair near the
window, which commanded the Melcombe park gates.
She was in a light gown, as was also her wont, though
it was not becoming. Her flood of light hair, in two
great heavy braids, framed her face, and was twisted
in a great knot behind. Her complexion, which had
grown a little dull, was not capable of overcoming
the mingled effects of the light hair and dress, and
her eyes, though they were large and animated, were
gray, too, of a yellowish tone, concentrating rather
than giving forth light. She lent her full attention
to Elizabeth, and yet she kept her eyes on the park
gates of Melcombe, and not a beggar or tramp could
pass out or in without being seen by Pax.</p>

<p>"It is vexing, that's all," said Elizabeth, drying her
brown eyes, which in their wet condition sent sparks
of light all round her, and illuminated the scene.
"It isn't as if I wished poor auntie to lose the least
of the pleasure she takes in her things."</p>

<p>"Only they are not her things; they're your things."</p>

<p>"Oh, what does that matter? What do I care
whose things they are? But she cares, poor dear!"</p>

<p>"I'm not fond of self-deception," said Pax, folding
her large hands in her lap. "If you didn't care, my
dear, you would never come and tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pax!"</p>

<p>"I'm not fond of deception of any kind," continued
Miss Lemesurier. "The subject of it is always
angry when it is found out, and has a right to
be angry. You know I was always for letting Mrs.
Travers, poor thing, know; there would have been a
few more tears, and then all would have been right."</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>"I don't think so. As a matter of fact, my uncle's
will was very unjust. Fancy his wife, who had been
his faithful companion all these years! Everything
had been hers, just as much hers as his; and in a moment
they all pass away from her without any reason,
and come to me. Nothing could be more unjust."</p>

<p>"That's a large statement," said Pax. "I don't
know if it's unjust or not, but there can't be a doubt
that it's hard. Widows have almost always to bear
it. Perhaps they don't mind. When it's their own
son who turns them out of house and home everybody
seems to think it's all right. But of course you would
never have turned her out. You would have made
yourself her slave,&mdash;as, indeed, you are doing now."</p>

<p>"Not a slave at all," said Elizabeth. "Sometimes
she is a little aggravating, and then I come and
grumble to you,&mdash;but only to you, Pax; and then it
all comes right again."</p>

<p>"What's wrong can never be right," said Pax, with
a certain placid dogmatism. She paused a little, and
then she said, "There is a wonderful sight! the
three Mitford boys all walking together out of the
gates."</p>

<p>Elizabeth got up quickly to peep over her friend's
shoulder. A little additional color had come to her
face. "The three Mitford boys!" she said, with a
little strained laugh. "One would think you were
talking of three curled darlings in velvet frocks, or
knickerbockers at the most."</p>

<p>"I've seen them in both," said Pax, calmly. "But
it's very seldom of late that I've seen them together.
Lizzy, when you make up your mind, and poor Mrs.
Travers is no longer in the way"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How could she ever be in the way?"</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>"Oh, my dear! How much simpler this world
would be," said Pax, "if people would be sincere and
speak the truth! I think the whole business wrong,
you know. Still, having done it, you may at least be
frank about the consequences, and not pretend to me
that it makes no difference. Of course she is in the
way. You know very well you can never marry while
she is there, thinking herself the mistress of all. I
should not wonder if you were to keep it up to the
end, and humbly accept an allowance from her out of
your own money."</p>

<p>"It would do&mdash;us no harm if I did," said Elizabeth,
coloring high, and speaking in a very low voice.</p>

<p>"Very likely it would do you no harm. To be
poor in reality would not do you much harm. You're
a good, honest, healthy young woman, and quite capable
of looking after your family, and bringing up your
children"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pax!" Elizabeth stopped her, laughing and blushing.
"You go a great deal too fast!" she cried.</p>

<p>"That's true. Of course it would take a few
years. But that's not the question, my dear. You
couldn't be married like an ordinary girl. There
would be all the fuss in the world about settlements,
and everything must be turned over among the lawyers
and talked about, and your position made known.
You couldn't deceive her any longer; it wouldn't be
possible. Everybody would know."</p>

<p>"Everybody knows now, except my poor auntie. I
don't see what difference it need make."</p>

<p>"And you think you could get a man to aid and
abet you in all that! You think your husband would
carry on the farce, and make believe to be Mrs.
Travers's pensioner, and have your money doled out
through her hands!"</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>"Pax," cried Miss Travers, "I tell you, you go a
great deal too fast. There's no such person; time
enough to consider what he would do, when he exists."</p>

<p>"My poor child," said Pax, with a mixture of pity
and contempt, "he exists; or at least I hope so, for
your sake. I hope you are not going to marry thirty
years hence some boy who is not born yet,&mdash;that
would be a dismal look-out indeed. He exists, and
not far off, or I'm mistaken. Indeed, I should not
wonder if he were to pass at any moment under those
trees."</p>

<p>"All this is quite beyond the question," said Elizabeth,
with a look of pain. It was not the fluttering,
pretty blush of happy anticipation, but a hot color
of embarrassment, of perplexity, almost of irritation,
that made a line under her eyes. Something like a
flame of trouble not unmixed with shame passed over
her face. "We have talked of this a great deal too
much," she said, "or at least I have let you talk.
To speculate may be no harm. I suppose I thought
it amusing at one time, but it is not amusing now.
Pax, please, if you care for me at all, don't say any
more."</p>

<p>"I care for you a great deal, my dear, and for him
also,&mdash;I have a right to," Pax said. Then there was
silence between them. For as a matter of fact the
three young men were passing under the trees; and it
remained uncertain whether they were coming to the
Rectory, or whether any one of them was coming to
the Rectory, or where this unlikely group were bound.
To see them all three together was so unusual that
the women who took so great an interest in them
watched and waited for the two or three decisive minutes,

<!-- page 21 -->

almost holding their breath. The footsteps became
audible after a minute, and even a distant sound
of voices; and then these indications became distant,
and it was evident that the Rectory was not the end
to which either all or any were bound. Both the
ladies drew a long breath when this was ascertained
beyond doubt, but it is uncertain whether it was in
relief or disappointment. The color still flamed, red
and hot, under Elizabeth's eyes. The passing sounds
seemed to have disturbed and excited her. She had
forgotten the original subject of her complaints and
trouble, and her mind went far away out of the Rectory
drawing-room to other speculations of her own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the three Mitfords passed the Rectory
gate, and recognized Elizabeth's horse which the
groom was walking up and down outside. "Oh ho!"
cried Stephen. "There's Lizzy Travers's mare.
She's having a consultation with old Pax, Roger,
about the best way of hooking you."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd try to be less vulgar, Steve."</p>

<p>"Oh, vulgar! As soon as a fellow speaks the truth
about a woman, you call him vulgar. Old Pax ought
to know how to set about it, if all tales are true."</p>

<p>"There are some things which are worse than vulgar,"
said Edmund, "and that is one of them. Keep
your mess-room talk for that fine locality. You will
soon be there."</p>

<p>"I hope so," cried Stephen,&mdash;"free from the lackadaisical,
which is worse than vulgar any day. Look
here, you fellows, I wish you would make up your
minds who is going in for Liz,&mdash;a fine girl and a fine
fortune, and capital preserves, though they're over-stocked.
If it's not good enough for you, it's quite
good enough for me, and I shouldn't mind settling

<!-- page 22 -->

down. Not at home, though. The Governor is too
much for any fellow. I can't think how you stand it,
you two."</p>

<p>To this speech there was no reply, and presently all
three paused to greet a couple of men, quite unlike
themselves, who were crossing the common, coming
from the little railway station to which the Mitfords
were bound. One of these was a very trim and fresh
country gentleman of fifty or so, with a gray mustache
and that indescribably clean, well-brushed air, the
perfection of physical purity and soundness which we
in England are apt to consider characteristic of an
Englishman,&mdash;a man who was not above a cigar, but
never smelt of smoke; who was no ascetic, yet showed
no symptom of any indulgence; who looked his years,
yet bore them like a flower, and was as active as any
of the younger men beside him. There was no mistaking
the handsome, slim young fellow by his side
for anything but his son. But though he was tall and
straight and delightful in the first bloom of his youth,
Raymond Tredgold was not such a perfect type as
his father. The man was as self-possessed and easy
in speech and mind as in appearance; the youth was
a little shy, a little eager, half a step in advance, but
not half so sure where he was going or what he meant
to do.</p>

<p>"Hallo, what's up?" Raymond cried, which indeed
was but a version less refined of the sentiments of the
ladies at the Rectory window as to the errand of the
brothers, all walking together, as if they had something
(for once) in common to do.</p>

<p>"You're going to see Stephen off?" said Mr. Tredgold,
solving this problem summarily. "I'm sorry
you are going, Steve. My girls think it will soon be

<!-- page 23 -->

weather for tennis, and I don't know what else&mdash;and
every man that goes is a loss, they say."</p>

<p>"If it's only in the light of any man that goes&mdash;I
hope they think a little more of me than that. Tell
them I'll see them in town, where perhaps they won't
take any notice of me."</p>

<p>"Or you of them. We know what you think of
country folks in town," said Mr. Tredgold, with a
laugh that was not without meaning. Then he added,
"We are going to see if the Rector can do anything
for Ray in the matter of this exam."</p>

<p>Ray gave a little shrug to his shoulders when he
thus became the subject of the conversation. He was
two and twenty, and it was recognized as fully necessary
that he should lose no time.</p>

<p>"I am afraid the Rector has rather forgotten his
classics," said Edmund.</p>

<p>"What can I do? To send him to a crammer is
too expensive; besides, I don't approve of the system.
I wish I knew of any one else. But the Rector, even
if he has forgotten something, must still know a great
deal more than Ray."</p>

<p>"Ray," said Stephen, "I'll tell you what to do, a
deal better than going in for exams. A hundred yards
off, round the corner, you'll see a certain mare walked
about, waiting for her mistress, and the mistress is
in the Rectory drawing-room with old Pax. Go in
strong for that, and you never need trouble your head
any more about exams."</p>

<p>He laughed an insolent laugh, sweeping over his
brothers, both of whom were very grave, a malicious
glance of defiance. Young Raymond flashed an angry
look at his adviser; but the color rose in his young
cheek, and he made half a step forward, like a dog
pulling at the leash in spite of himself.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p class="small">BROTHERS.</p>

</div>

<p>"I WONDER," said Edmund, as they returned towards
the house, "whether I may speak to you quite
frankly, Roger?"</p>

<p>"That means make yourself disagreeable about
something. Well, fire away. I don't mind anything,
now that fellow's gone."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't speak of him so."</p>

<p>"Come, that's a little too much, Ned. I mean
Steve no harm: but you don't think it adds to the
comfort of the household, do you, when he's here?"</p>

<p>To this the younger brother made no reply, especially
as at the moment he had obeyed involuntarily
an impulse given by Roger, in which more was meant
than met the eye. They had been walking along the
road which, with a sweep round the village common,
led to Melcombe from the railway. Roger had not
said that he intended to take a less direct way, but he
silently turned along a cross-road traversing the common
in the opposite direction, and his brother had
followed without a word. Indeed, there could not be
said to be either leading or following in the matter,
for they moved as by one impulse, keeping side by
side. Imperceptible as the influence was, however, it
was so marked that when the turn was taken, Edmund
looked up quickly with a questioning glance. After a
moment he spoke:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>"I have wanted for some time to speak to you,
Roger. Don't you think you should come to some decision
now, and think of doing what my father wishes
so much, what all your friends desire?"</p>

<p>"Speak plainly. I am bad at riddles."</p>

<p>"It is no riddle; you know what I mean," said Edmund,
with a faint rising color. "You should marry;
you know that's the question."</p>

<p>Roger was silent for a moment, and they went on
quickly, their footsteps ringing clear upon the road, as
if that had been the prevailing sound to which speech
was but a broken accompaniment. He said at last,
"It's a question for myself, surely, rather than any
one else. Marry&mdash;whom, I wonder? If I'm directed
in such a matter, the direction should be complete."</p>

<p>Edmund half paused, and threw out his arm with
a quick gesture towards the point which they were
leaving behind. "To speak of direction is folly,
Roger. But don't you know? If you don't, you are
the only ignorant person."</p>

<p>Again the steps went on and the voices stayed,&mdash;on
quickly, in measured cadence, sure and steady towards
an aim, whatever that aim might be. It was very
different, at least, from the object of the other interrupted
strain,&mdash;the conversation which was begun
and broken off so often, and by which only a portion
of the intended meaning could be conveyed.</p>

<p>When Roger broke silence again, it was in the
veiled voice with which a man speaks who turns his
head away, not to encounter the scrutiny of his companion's
eye. "I thought it was the first tenet of the
romantic school," he said, "that marriage cannot be
without love. Should I marry one woman while&mdash;should
I insult one woman by asking her while&mdash;?

<!-- page 26 -->

that's out of the question, at least." With angry force
he kicked away a stone which was in his path as if
that had been the thing which was out of the question,
and, hurting his foot upon it, gave vent to a short,
sharp exclamation of pain, all of which seemed to
come into the discussion and form part of it, as they
went on.</p>

<p>"Marriage is a very complex matter," said the
younger brother; "it's not so simple as one thought.
Love is not the only necessity, as one used to suppose."</p>

<p>"You speak like an oracle, Ned," said Roger, seizing
the opportunity to laugh off an argument which
was becoming serious. "And that's much from you,
the faithful Edmund. No, I'm not going to laugh
about Pax, dear old Pax,&mdash;there never was a better
or a dearer,&mdash;but you see the justice of it now."</p>

<p>"I see," said Edmund, adopting his brother's plan,
that natural expedient of embarrassed feeling, and
turning his head aside, "that there are many things
which make it impossible, and best that it is impossible.
She saw that well enough from the first, and
always told me so. It's rather a dreary thing to be
convinced, but I am convinced, if that will do you any
good."</p>

<p>"How should it do me any good?" said Roger, in
a quick, startled tone.</p>

<p>"Only because you know how much in earnest I
was, and yet I see it all well enough now. There are
other things wanted. There's suitability,&mdash;that commonplace
qualification; there's all one's life to be
taken into account."</p>

<p>"You speak like Pax herself, Ned."</p>

<p>"I dare say, it's all her at second hand; but the

<!-- page 27 -->

thing is, I now see it myself, which I didn't and
wouldn't in the old days. I don't undervalue love.
God forbid. It's the foundation of all things&mdash;but"&mdash;&mdash;

<p>"It must consider suitability first of all," said Roger,
with a forced laugh, "and reckon up all the qualifications,
so much money, so much family, so much beauty
even,&mdash;oh, I know that comes in; and then, everything
fully considered, it may let itself go! Yes, I
understand all that. But," the young man continued,
drawing a long breath, "that's not how it sets to
work, alas. There's no consideration at all to begin
with,&mdash;no dwelling on this, or dwelling on that, none
of your reasons for doing a thing. Love," he went
on, warming to his subject, "is not doing anything.
It rises in you when you are thinking nothing of it;
it catches you unawares; all at once there comes into
you something that was not there a moment before.
It's not your doing, nor <i>her</i> doing. It is not because
she's lovely, even; it's because of&mdash;nothing that I
know. It comes, and there it is, and the question is&mdash;the
question is, what are you to do with it, what is
to follow it, how is it to end?" He clenched the hand
that hung by his side and dashed it into the vacant
air with a kind of fury. "Talk about questions!"
he cried, with a strange laugh. "There's a question
which I don't know how to solve, for one."</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?" asked his brother in a subdued
and troubled tone.</p>

<p>"As bad as&mdash;what?" cried Roger, turning upon
him. "There is no bad in it. I don't believe you
know what I am talking about. I am talking of love,
love in the abstract, love with a capital letter,&mdash;which
you despise, and think should give place to suitability,

<!-- page 28 -->

Ned. Suitability! I think I see myself poking about
looking for what is suitable! Yes, when I want a
pair of shoes&mdash;No, when what I want is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The companion of your life, Roger, the mistress
of the house, the lady of Melcombe, the representative
of the family in our generation&mdash;besides other things
more important still."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you spare me the children!" observed
Roger, with a hard laugh.</p>

<p>Then the conversation stopped, and the quick, steady
strain of the footsteps, hurrying in their excitement
like a march in music, resumed; always going on,&mdash;going
on like the composed strain of life through all
that can happen, quickened now and then by the hurry
or commotion of some event, but never brought to a
stand-still. The young men's minds were not open to
such a comparison, nor, indeed, to any comparison at
all. For a long time they moved on in silence, keeping
step, with complete harmony in their movement,
but in their thoughts an immeasurable distance apart.
The month was March; the roads were dry and dusty,
the woods all covered with an indescribable softened
tint, and here and there shrubs with a high tone of
budding green, which denoted the new life swelling to
the tip of every bough, half bursting in the brown
buds. The footsteps of the brothers rang upon the
road in perfect measure, and for several minutes
neither spoke. At length, as the road rounded off
towards the west, Roger turned suddenly upon his
companion.</p>

<p>"Are you going anywhere in particular," he said,
"that you come this long round? I thought you had
something to do at home."</p>

<p>"Only to keep you company," said Edmund. "I
had not thought of any other motive."</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"Are you sure it was merely for company? It is
your turn to be questioned now. Didn't you think that
perhaps, if you stuck to my side, you might&mdash;influence
me, for my good, as you fellows are always bent
on doing; keep me from going where I have a mind
to go; make me ashamed possibly of where I was
going?" Roger spoke hastily and angrily, but at the
same time with embarrassment and a hot flush upon
his face. And now for the first time the rhythm of
their footsteps ceased, and they stood and looked at
each other with much meaning between them, more
than was put into words.</p>

<p>Edmund replied in a somewhat startled tone: "No,
I don't think I intended all that. I came with you
without any particular intention, out of mere habit,
idleness. If you think I meant to spy upon you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no." cried the other, "nothing of the sort.
If you meant anything, Ned, I know it was for my
good; but don't you know, you fellows who are so
fond of influence, that the man who is to be influenced
never likes it when he finds it out?"</p>

<p>"I had no such thought," said Edmund, seriously.
"I didn't even know&mdash;but since you think so, Roger&mdash;It's
true I have no particular object in coming
this way; on the contrary, the opposite direction&mdash;might
suit me best."</p>

<p>"I think so, Ned, if you will not be offended."</p>

<p>"Why should I be offended?" said Edmund, but
he had the dubious, startled look of a man suddenly
pulled up and arrested in his course, whatever that
might be. "It is true I have something to do," he
said, waving his hand to his brother as he abruptly
turned back. He was not offended, but he was
abashed and startled by this sudden dismissal. No,

<!-- page 30 -->

there was no cause of offense. A brother may say
to a brother what it would not be civil to say to a
stranger; he may give that natural ally to understand
that he wants to be alone, that he has things to occupy
which do not brook companionship. The frankness of
the nursery may still linger about their intercourse
and no harm done. But Edmund felt, as was equally
natural, as if he had been meddling and his efforts
were rejected as intrusive. He walked very quickly
in the opposite direction, driven by annoyance and
something like shame, while Roger went on with equal
speed upon his way, a little disturbed and uneasy, but
full of a fervor of feeling which drove all those lesser
sentiments before it like a strong wind. It hurt him
to hurt Ned, and at the same time the heat of his
momentary anger against Ned, and feeling that his
presence was extremely uncalled for, impelled him to
do so; but in a few minutes he had forgotten all
about his brother and everything else save the errand
upon which he was bound.</p>

<p>Edmund had no such burning motive in his heart.
When the little flash of irritation was over, evaporating
in the speed of movement and the prick of the
fresh breeze which blew in his face,&mdash;which, indeed,
was an east wind, and nothing less, though, far inland
as Melcombe was and sheltered by many woods, it was
robbed of much of its severity,&mdash;his hasty steps
gradually modified into that slower and reflective pace
which comes natural to a thoughtful person in the
depths of the country, where no pressure or hurry is.
He went along quietly thinking of many things.
There had been little activity in Edmund's life; he
had been somewhat apt to follow the impulse given
him, as he had done in the present case, accompanying

<!-- page 31 -->

Roger, with no intention of interfering with Roger,
but instinctively, because the turn had been taken
which led that way. And it was upon this peculiarity
of his own that he reflected, as he turned away. He
thought of his brother, for whom he not only felt
much tenderness, but in whom he took a pride which
was not, perhaps, justified by any superiority in Roger,
but was the younger boy's traditional admiration for
his elder brother, a sentiment which often lingers after
the elder brother has been far surpassed by the younger
one and left behind. In some respects this had been
done in Edmund's case. He had a better head than
Roger, and of this he could not but be aware. He had
done better in education than Roger; indeed, he had
accomplished much which Roger had not even tried to
do. He was in reality more independent, more individual,
than his brother, who was of the order of the
country squire, without any higher aspirations. But
yet Edmund had always been proud of him, and so
continued. He had been proud, at Oxford, of the gay
young guardsman who brought a whiff of London (not
always too wholesome) among the "men," and dispersed
the mist of thin talk about schools and books.
He was proud of him now in his robustness, his knowledge
of out door things, his profound learning in
horses, his great rides and feats of all kinds. Roger
could far out-ride him, out-walk him, even out-talk him
in his own way. Edmund admired his energy, his
quick impulses, his certainty of being right, whether
about the course taken by the fox or the course taken
by the government. As a true man of his time,
knowing how very much is to be said on both sides,
Edmund secretly laughed at this certainty, but he admired
it, all the same.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>Something, however, had come over Roger, in these
later days, which had a strange effect upon this open-air
and robust young man,&mdash;something which had
cast him down from the supreme height of those certainties,
and at the same time opened out new possibilities
in him. To think of Roger, of all people in
the world, discussing love,&mdash;love, as he said, with a
capital letter, giving a nervous laugh,&mdash;a thing surrounded
by all the tremors and hesitations and uncertainties
of feeling, complicated by horrible doubts and
an issue which he could not control: a power sweet
but terrible, which had carried him out of himself, as
he described it, and out of all his habitual ways. This
new phase of Roger made him more and more interesting
to his brother, justified the instinctive pride in
him which Edmund had always felt, and awoke a hundred
questions in the quiescent breast of the young
man, who, his own romance having died out to the
very ashes, felt himself put aside from life, and for
the moment in the position of a spectator. Where
was a greater instance of the perversity of circumstances,
or, rather, of human hearts and wishes? It
had seemed to many people, not only to the family
most concerned, that Roger Mitford and Elizabeth
Travers were specially indicated by Providence as a
pair "fitly formed to meet by nature." Their estates
lay side by side; their characters were similar, or so
the country thought. What Elizabeth wanted in
point of family was fully made up by Roger; and
though there was no want at Melcombe of a wife's
money, still it is well known that more money never
comes amiss even to the wealthiest. Thus everything
indicated a match, which had the "suitability" which

<!-- page 33 -->

Edmund had appealed to in its favor in an overwhelming
way.</p>

<p>Alas, suitability is a delusion and snare. It severs
more heaven-destined partners than it unites; it lights
fires of resistance in the youthful soul. Roger had
never been supposed to be romantic, but even upon
his seemingly unfantastic mind this rebellion against
the suitable had told. At least, so he asserted now
with vehement emphasis, as has been seen. There
had, however, been a moment when it was not supposed
that he had felt this drawback; when he and
the heiress had ridden together, danced together,
walked and talked together, and all had been supposed
to be in good train. Edmund's mind went back
to this period as he walked along. From Roger's it
had disappeared altogether; had it also disappeared
from that of Elizabeth? The neighborhood had unhesitatingly
concluded that she had not been slow to
make up her mind, and that when Roger's proposal
was made it would be accepted without delay or doubt.
Edmund had himself been of that opinion. When
he had seen her horse and groom outside the Rectory
gates, a keen sympathetic pang had gone through his
mind. He was fond of entering into other people's
feelings, and he had thought instinctively of the proud,
yet tender, woman watching from the window the man
whom she perhaps loved, whom, at least, she had begun
to think of as a man who meant to seek her love,&mdash;watching
him pass by on the other side, without a
look or thought. The woman could make no sign;
the woman was bound to stand like an Indian at the
stake, whatever happened, and never show what she
felt. Edmund's mind hung between these two with a

<!-- page 34 -->

poignant sense of pain, of which, possibly, he did not
render a full and frank account to himself. Was it
for Roger gone astray, or for Elizabeth slighted and
disappointed, or was there still some subtler sentiment
underneath?</p>

</div>

<p>ROGER MITFORD quickened his steps as his brother
left him. He had been like a dog in a leash, compelled
to curb his impatient impulse; now he darted
forward, the fervor in his heart carrying all before it.
It was no walk upon which he was bound. There is
no mistaking the expression on the face of a man who
is going somewhere, who knows exactly where he is
going and is eager to get there. He walked on as if
for a wager along the winding country road.</p>

<p>Presently this impulse came to an end, or at all
events he paused, relapsed into a saunter, but a saunter
in which the same nervous impatience was disguised.
In many things, but most especially in that
kind of pursuit which absorbed Roger, the hurry of
the eager pursuer fails as he reaches the point at
which he has aimed. As he draws near he grows
cautious, he grows timid. A terror of what he may
find when he gets to the end seizes him. "If Lucy
should be dead!" cries the poet. But that is an extreme
case. It may be that Lucy will be cruel, that
she will be indifferent; it may be&mdash;oh misery worse
than either alternative&mdash;that she is not there. Finally
Roger swung open the gate known as the west gate
of Melcombe park, and stole in with almost noiseless
steps, holding his breath. No sign of hurry then was
in his mild aspect. He had only come round to ask

<!-- page 36 -->

Ford the keeper something about the dogs,&mdash;a most
innocent question which was really of no consequence.
"I'll wait a bit, and perhaps he'll turn up," Roger
said, slightly breathless. "If he doesn't, it's really
of no consequence&mdash;only something about the puppies.
I'll wait a bit, and see if he comes in. How
is your garden looking this fine day?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," returned Mrs. Ford, "when the sun
come out this morning it was just a-blaze. All the
crocuses a-shining like gold. Them crocuses is the
nicest things as ever was. You couldn't have done a
kinder action to Lily and me."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad you like them. They're simple
things enough,&mdash;the very simplest you could get anywhere;
why, gardeners, you know, make no account
at all of them."</p>

<p>"Gardeners is very queer," said Mrs. Ford. "I
don't think they care for nothing as hasn't a name
that's three miles long, as Lily says. She does take
her fun out of the Scotch gardener about that, Mr.
Roger. You should just hear her at him. My Lily
has a deal of fun in her, when she don't stand in
awe of a person."</p>

<p>"Of whom does she stand in awe?" asked Roger,
with a smile which lit up his face into tenderness;
then it suddenly clouded over. "The Scotch gardener
is not society for your daughter, Mrs. Ford."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger! bless you, he thinks himself much
too grand for the like of us."</p>

<p>"Then he's a puppy and a fool, and doesn't know
what he's talking of!" cried Roger hotly. He paused,
and, restraining himself, continued with a smile, "I
hope I'm not the person of whom Lily stands in
awe."</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p>"Oh, sir! you're a deal too good and kind," cried
the keeper's wife, taking up her apron to remove an
invisible particle of dust, and avoiding the young
master's eye. Then there was a momentary pause.</p>

<p>"Ford doesn't seem to be coming," remarked Roger
at last.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't expect him till tea-time at soonest.
He said as he was going to make a long round
out by Bilbury Hollow, and then down by"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," said Roger cheerfully, interrupting her,
"I'll take a look at the puppies before I go, and I
should like to see your crocuses, Mrs. Ford, now I'm
here."</p>

<p>"They're not half as fine as in the morning, sir,"
said the keeper's wife. "The sun's gone in, and they're
just like children at school; they've gone in, too.
If you were a-passing this way, sir, some time in the
morning"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's no time like the present," answered Roger;
"but you needn't disturb yourself, if you're busy. I
think I ought to know the way."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, no doubt you knows it," said the
woman, hesitating. But whatever her feelings might
be on the subject, it was clear that she could not oppose
the entrance of the master's son, the young Squire,
through whose favor her husband had got the place,
and on whose favor they all depended. But the keeper's
wife, with an uneasy soul, saw him pass through
her house to the greenness of the garden which was
visible behind. No one knew or shared her anxieties.
She stood looking after him helplessly for a moment,
and then, shaking her head, returned to her work,
with the sort of unsatisfactory consolation there is in
utter helplessness: for what could she do?</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>Roger stepped along through the passage which traversed
the little house with a step which in itself was
full of revelations. It rung upon the floor with a sort
of triumph, yet timidity. He was on the eve of attaining
a pleasure which had still more or less to be schemed
for, which he could not seek openly. He had before
him the prospect of such an occupation for the afternoon's
idleness as it made his heart beat to think of;
and yet whether he should have this pleasure at all,
whether these hours should be enchantment or a blank
of disillusion and misery, was not in his own power,
but in that of another,&mdash;of one whose very charm was
the caprice which wounded yet delighted, which sometimes
made him miserable and sometimes intoxicated
him with pleasure. It is not all men who are liable to
this kind of subjugation, but Roger had all the qualities
which give it supreme power. He was little used
to women, still less to the kind of woman to whom the
pursuit and subjugation of man are natural, and who
puts a hunter's passion, his wiles and cunning, his
patience and his vehemence alike, and disregard of all
other things, into her sport. He was simple-minded,
seeking no recondite motives, believing in what appeared
before his eyes. And he was in need of an
object, his mind vacant and unoccupied except by those
matters of physical activity which cannot be always
pursued, and which leave a perilous blank when they
are withdrawn. Perhaps if he could have hunted all
the year through, if the shooting could have lasted, if
the village football and cricket had been continuous
and exciting enough, he might never have thought of
the more seductive play which occupies the imagination
and the heart. But there are perforce periods in
country life in which there is, as <i>ces messieurs</i> lament,

<!-- page 39 -->

nothing to do. M. Ohnet's latest hero, at such a pause
in existence, elegantly devotes himself to the seduction
of the nearest lady as the right and natural alternative.
A vicious young Englishman of earlier date, in such
circumstances, might perhaps have found in the keeper's
pretty daughter a natural victim. But Roger was
neither a <i>beau gar&ccedil;on</i> of the French type, nor a Squire
Thornhill of the last century. And when he fell under
this unaccustomed spell, it was himself who became, or
was likely to become, the victim. There was no idea,
however, of any victim in the sensations with which
he went through the keeper's cottage into the garden
behind. It was Armida's garden, the Bower of Bliss,
the fool's paradise, to Roger. Away from it he was
not without serious thought of what it might come to,
and a just perception of all the difficulties and impossibilities
in his way. But at this moment he thought
of nothing of the kind. All the restraints of judgment,
of good sense and practical possibility, were withdrawn.
He was hurrying to an intoxication more
delightful than any which vulgarer methods could
afford. The delicate fumes had mounted to his head
already, though he had not yet tasted the dangerous
draught.</p>

<p>The keeper's cottage, known as the West Lodge,
was very much like many other lodges at the park
gates of country houses. It was built of red brick,
with gables intended to be picturesque, but without
any pretense at antiquity, being indeed a quite recent
erection and in conformity with the taste of the moment.
It was, however, already half covered with
creepers, and on the warm south wall the roses and
honeysuckles which made it sweet in summer were
bursting into full leaf. The garden behind was separated

<!-- page 40 -->

from the park only by a railing, and in the season
of flowers it was a sight to see. The keeper's wife
was one of those women with an instinct for flowers,
under whose hand everything thrives, and her simple
gardening by the light of nature and homely experience
succeeded better than art. Mrs. Ford had married
somewhat late in life, and had been a florist in her
untutored way before she was a mother. She took
her baby, when it came unexpectedly, past the time
for such vanities, very much as she would have taken
some new and rare plant. It was no rough boy, to
fall into the father's way, and grow up in velveteens,
a miniature keeper, but a girl, a delicate little creature,
a sort of animated flower, transporting the elderly
mother into a heaven of tender worship such as she
had never dreamed of. The great white lilies were
standing in angelic groups about the garden, with their
stately heads bent in the reverence of that Ave which
the flower of the Annunciation has brought out of the
old pictures, out of tender tradition, to make it doubly
sweet. The keeper's wife could see them from where
she lay, with the little woman-child who was her flower
and late blossom in her arms; and what could she
name it but Lily, in the still transport of her soul?
The flowers and the child were as one in her eyes, the
most exquisite things in the earth, good enough for a
queen, yet hers, which was a wonder she never could
get over. Lily the child grew up in such delicacy and
daintiness as the endless care and worship of a mother
often brings. Mrs. Ford's own perceptions grew finer
through the medium of the child. Perhaps her flowers,
too, gave her a delicacy not to be expected among
her kind. Lily had been dressed like a little lady
when she caught Mrs. Mitford's eye, and was carried

<!-- page 41 -->

to the Hall to be admired and caressed and to amuse
the invalid lady on her death-bed. The Squire's wife
was not a judicious adviser for a woman lost in such
an adoration. She took a violent fancy to the child,
and left her a little legacy to be spent in her education.
"She must not grow up to be a mere house-maid. She
must have a good education; and then who knows
what may happen?" Mrs. Mitford said, with a smile
that made Lily's mother dissolve in weeping. Lily
was far more pretty, far more dainty, at that period
than poor little Nina, who was in the nursery, a weakly
baby, left to the nurse's care. From that moment the
girl's fate was settled. Mrs. Ford had a battle to
fight with her husband, who comprehended none of
these delicacies, and did not understand why his little
girl should not stir about the house, and open the
lodge gates, and help her mother. But even Ford was
penetrated by and by with the pride of having a child
who was like nobody else's, and whom strangers took
for a little lady from the Hall. He was mollified by
the fact that the radiant little creature was very fond
of him, and would sit in his lap and coax him to tell
her stories, and applaud her daddy's crooning of rustic
songs, notwithstanding her white frocks and her lessons
from the Melcombe governess. There is nothing
more contagious than child worship in any circumstances;
and Lily was, to belong to a keeper and his
homely wife, a miraculous child. Her beauty was not
of the dairy-maid kind. She was even a little deficient
in color, pale as suited her name. And as she grew
older, the father came to look upon her with a little
awe. "Are you sure she wasn't changed at nurse?" he
would say as the dainty creature stood between them,
he in his gaiters at one side of the hearth, and his

<!-- page 42 -->

elderly wife in her black cap on the other, with her
hard hands all rough with work, and wrinkles abounding
in the homely face which bore the brunt of all
weather.</p>

<p>"I know as she's never left my lap till she could
run by herself," said the mother, well pleased. But
she might have been a little princess, they were
both agreed on that.</p>

<p>Naturally, the bringing up of Lily was a point upon
which the whole neighborhood had its opinion, which
did not agree with that of Mrs. Ford. "What is to
come of it?" the village people said; and indeed the
West Lodge could give no answer to that question.
"Is she going for a governess, or do they mean her
for the new girls' school?" her more favorable critics
asked, when Lily came home with her education completed.
Miss Lemesurier even sent for the mother,
to ask this question. "I don't approve of that style
of education even for such a purpose," said Pax, "but
I will speak to my father, Mrs. Ford, if you want her
to try for the girls' school."</p>

<p>"No, thank you kindly, miss. Her father and me,
we don't want nothing of that sort," Mrs. Ford replied.</p>

<p>"What do you want, then? You haven't given
your girl an expensive education, and brought her up
so different from her class, without some meaning, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, miss," said the keeper's wife, drawing patterns
on the carpet with the point of her umbrella,
"we've brought up Lily as we thought was best for
her. She's different in her nature, without any doing
of ours."</p>

<p>"I wonder how you can talk such nonsense," cried
Pax,&mdash;"a sensible woman like you!"</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"If it's nonsense, the dear lady at the Hall, she
spoke the same. She saw as the child wasn't like one
in a hundred. Give her a good eddication, she said,
and then"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;what then? That's just the question."</p>

<p>"Well, miss, then there's no telling what may happen,"
Mrs. Ford said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you foolish woman!" cried Pax, holding up
her hands; "oh, you"&mdash;But words failed to express
the force of her feelings. "Mrs. Mitford, poor thing,
is dead, and we'll say no harm of her," she went on,
"but don't you see what that means? There is only
one thing it can mean. It was like her sentimental,
silly ways to put it in your head. It means that you
expect some fine gentleman to come and fall in love
with her and carry the girl away."</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking anything of the sort," cried the
mother, springing up and growing red; for English
mothers, both high and low, whatever may be their
prudential outlook, unlike all parents of other races,
vehemently deny that such a thing as marrying a
daughter ever enters into their heads. But Mrs.
Ford was too simple and too self-conscious to add anything
to this first denial. Aware of the guilty hopes
in her heart, she broke forth with, "Oh, Miss Pax, I
never thought as you'd say such things to me!" and
burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there would be anything wrong
in it," said Pax impatiently. "If I saw any way to
a good marriage for Lily or any one, I'd certainly
help it on. But suppose she caught some one far
above her, which is what you're thinking of, you
know, what would happen? If the very best came

<!-- page 44 -->

that you could hope for, which is very, very unlikely,
he'd take her away from you, and separate her from
you, and perhaps never let her come near you more."</p>

<p>The mother dried her eyes indignantly. "It's
clear to me you don't know my Lily; and how should
you?" Mrs. Ford cried, with mingled resentment and
pity. "They might tear her with wild horses, but
they would never get her to consent to that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but you wouldn't like her to be torn
with wild horses, would you?" Pax said.</p>

<p>These words gave Mrs. Ford a tremor for the moment;
they gave her "a turn," she said to herself.
But as there was no immediate possibility of verifying
them, and it is much pleasanter to think of events
taking a favorable course than a bad one, she was
able to dismiss them out of her mind for the time.
Still it was not a pleasant thing to have had said to
her. Lily would never abandon her mother, never
turn her back upon her, not if she were drawn with
wild horses. But how about the wild horses? The
mother's heart stood still for a moment. Better she
should be abandoned, cast off, dropped forever, than
that Lily should be exposed to that rending. It gave
Mrs. Ford a "dreadful turn." But then she hastily
thrust it out of her mind.</p>

<p>It was enough to make any mother's heart dance to
see the radiant creature Lily came home. Her hair
was light brown and silky, and shone in the sun like
gold. Her mother thought she had seen nothing like
it save the knot of spun glass which she had brought
home from the exhibition once held at Beaulieu, and
kept under a little glass shade on the mantelpiece.
Her face was like a flower, though more like a rose
now than a lily; her complexion more tender, delicate,

<!-- page 45 -->

and perfect in its first bloom than anything but a
girl's complexion can be. Her eyes were as blue as
the sky. To be sure, the features were not perfect, if
Mrs. Ford had been disposed to take them to pieces.
The girl's slim figure was also like a flower, tall and
light, and swaying a little, as a lily does with its
graceful, drooping head. To think of such a creature
doing housework, or looking after the dog's meat, was
a thing that made the parents shiver; whatever happened
to them, that was impossible; they had not
brought her home from the genteel seminary and all
her nice companions for that. It was, indeed, after
the first rapture of her return, an embarrassing question
what Lily was to do. The parents did not know
what to make of it; they did not know what to say
to her on the subject, or whether to suggest that it
was necessary to do something. Lily did not at first
appear to see any necessity. She went out with her
pencils and colors and made little sketches; and she
played "pieces" upon the jingling piano, which had
come out of the school-room at Melcombe, and sounded
like an old tin kettle; and for some time seemed to
suppose that this was all that was required of her;
but this blissful state of ignorance was dispelled by
communications made to the girl in the village at a
little tea party, where she was eagerly questioned as
to whether she were going into service, or what she
was going to do. Lily was awakened rudely under
the fire of these demands, but she was not without
spirit, and she had accepted the position. The housekeeper
at Melcombe had some sewing to be done
which was finer than the village was equal to; and
Lily installed herself in the vacant little room that
was called the parlor, which had never been used till

<!-- page 46 -->

her return. And here the parents, growing less and
less wise as they came more and more under the influence
of this dazzling child of theirs, made Lily a
bower. It looked into the garden, and Ford, with the
aid of some of the workmen on the estate, made the
window into a glass door opening into that flowery inclosure.
There Lily took up her abode, with her
pretty accomplishments and her pretty dresses, to see
what would happen. Those words which her early
patroness had said had not indeed been reported to
her. But she felt as Mrs. Mitford had done, as her
mother did, as Pax had instantly divined, that there
was no telling what might happen. The preparation
was over; the results might be anticipated any day.</p>

<p>What was it the girl expected when she sat down
to her little pretense of work in her little room, all
fenced and guarded from intrusion, looking out upon
her flowers? She did not know; neither did the
mother know who had prepared it all for her, as if
with a settled plan and purpose. There was no telling
what might happen; there was no telling what
fine fortune or beautiful hero might suddenly come
out of the unknown. Lily sat down in her bower all
hidden among the leaves, and put out her webs unconsciously,
as perhaps the spiders do when they begin.
It is not a lovely comparison, and she meant to devour
no one; but the girl, in all her prettiness, was like
nothing in the realms of nature so much as the swift
and skillful creature which spreads out those fairy
webs, the <i>toile &agrave; la bonne vierge</i>, to shiver upon every
bush in the autumn sun.</p>

<p>It was not long before an event occurred which
made the heart of this little enchantress leap into her
mouth in fright and triumph. One can imagine that

<!-- page 47 -->

to a little spider, new to her work, the sudden bounce
of a great fat fly into those gossamers which she has
extended by instinct in the sun, without any clear idea
what is to come of them, must be an alarming as well
as an exciting sight. Will those airy meshes be
strong enough to bear that weight? Will they tear
asunder under it? And what is to be done with this
altogether unlooked-for victim, so much bigger than
his captor? Something like this thrill of strange
sensation darted through Lily Ford, when all at once
it became apparent to her that the vague event
which there was no divining, the wonder for which
she had been looking, had come. She had not selected
that particular prey any more than the spider does.
And it would be impossible to imagine anything further
from the thoughts of Roger Mitford, when he
strolled into Ford's cottage as he passed, with some
question about the young birds and the prospects of
the shooting, than that he should then and there be
brought face to face with his fate. It was with no
purpose, even, that he was led into Lily's parlor for
greater honor, the fire in the kitchen being overpowering
on the hot August evening. He went in unsuspecting,
and asked his questions all unaware of
Armida in her corner, who, for her part, intended the
young Squire no harm. But when he made some remark
which Ford did not understand at once, and the
girl's quick, clear voice rose in the dusk, explaining it,
and Roger, amused and interested, stepped to the open
window opening into the garden, and in the mystic
twilight, just touched by the glimmer of the small
new moon, saw the unthought-of, unlooked-for apparition,
and asked, surprised, if this were Lily, the deed
was done. He was not himself aware of it, but she

<!-- page 48 -->

was aware of it, feeling the tug, let us suppose, in all
the delicate, invisible threads of her nets, as this big
captive caught in them. Roger lingered talking to
her for ten minutes, pleased to find his mother's baby
favorite developed into so charming a creature, and
went away thinking no more of it. But after that he
returned again and again. And this was why he had
discoursed to his brother, he a man who knew nothing
about poetry or the fictions of the romancers, upon
the mystery of love; and why the keeper's wife endeavored
with affright to keep him out of the garden,
where the cobwebs entangled everything, though it
was now no longer autumn, but spring. But Lily
sat within and peeped out, hearing his voice, and expected
him, drawing the young man with her mysterious
thread. For the enchantress had forgotten her
alarm in the pleasure of conquest, and for her victim
she was without ruth or pity.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p class="small">AFTER DINNER.</p>

</div>

<p>"I HEARD," said Mr. Mitford, when the servants
had left the room, "that Elizabeth Travers was over
here to-day. Who saw her when she came?&mdash;or
was it true"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A look was exchanged very quickly, almost imperceptibly,
by the others round the table, and Nina,
who had not yet had time to go away, answered in
her little voice, which had still something in it of the
shrillness of childhood, "She was not here, papa."</p>

<p>"But I heard that she was here," said Mr. Mitford,
in his peremptory tones. He was one of the
men who are always ready to suppose that they are
being deceived, and that every contradiction must be
a lie,&mdash;possibly intentional, perhaps only uttered on
the spur of the moment, but at all events untrue.</p>

<p>Roger, who knew what was coming, stirred in his
chair with a consciousness that could not quite be
concealed; but it was Edmund who replied:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She was at the Rectory, sir. We saw her mare
in front of the gates, as we were going to the railway
with Steve."</p>

<p>"Which of you went in to make her welcome?"
the Squire asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think any of us thought of it. Steve had
only just time to catch his train."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of Steve. What has Steve to

<!-- page 50 -->

do with it? But you two, I suppose, had no train
to catch. It was most fraternal, truly beautiful, to
walk down with your brother, but it did not, I imagine,
occupy all your souls."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend it occupied much of my soul,"
said Roger. He had turned half round on his chair,
perhaps out of mere caprice, perhaps that the light
might not fall so distinctly on his face.</p>

<p>"And when you saw her there,&mdash;a fine creature,
handsome enough to turn any young fellow's head,
and as nice as she's handsome,&mdash;you forgot all
about Stephen, and did your best to make yourself
agreeable? Much as I value family affection," said
the Squire, in the voice of satire which his children
dreaded, "I could forgive that."</p>

<p>Nina was not clever enough to see what it was
about, but she perceived that the situation was strained,
and she made a little diversion for the brothers by
leaving the table. Mr. Mitford never entered the
drawing-room after dinner, so that Nina's departure
was accompanied by a little ceremonial which sometimes
had the effect of changing a disagreeable subject.
She went up to her father, and put her soft
little lips to the weather-beaten cheek which he turned
carelessly towards her. "Good-night, papa," she
said.</p>

<p>"Good-night, good-night," he replied, almost with
impatience. This time the diversion was without effect.
That Roger should get up to open the door
for her seemed to Mr. Mitford a quite unnecessary
ceremony; and it must be owned that Roger himself
but seldom remembered this homage to womanhood
in the person of so familiar and unimportant an object
as his little sister. He had to come back from the

<!-- page 51 -->

door, by which he was so much tempted to escape, and
take his chair again, which he did most unwillingly,
foreseeing trouble to come.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the Squire. "How far did you go
with her? Or rather, how long did she stay?"</p>

<p>"I told you, sir," said Edmund, "that we went
with Steve to the railway."</p>

<p>"Again! what has Steve to do with it?" the father
cried.</p>

<p>"So that we saw nothing but the groom with the
mare. Her visit was at the Rectory, not here."</p>

<p>"At the Rectory, and not here!" repeated the
Squire, with a contemptuous (and very unsuccessful)
mimicry of his son's tone. "Did I ever say it was
here? How could she come here, to a house where
there's no woman, to throw herself at your heads?
That's what you expect a girl to do, you young fellows
nowadays. She went as far as she could in
coming to the Rectory. By Jove, when I was your
age I should soon have let her see I knew what she
meant."</p>

<p>"You forget, sir," said Roger, evidently restraining
himself with an effort, "that there is not the
slightest reason to suppose&mdash;indeed, that we have not
the least right to imagine&mdash;Miss Travers's visit to
her friend at the Rectory to have anything to do with
us."</p>

<p>"I don't forget, sir," cried the angry father, "that
you're a puppy and a coxcomb, and that Lizzy Travers
is twenty thousand times too good for you."</p>

<p>This perfectly irrelevant sentiment was delivered
with so much heat that Edmund gave his brother an
anxious, deprecatory look, to which Roger replied
with an indignant frown before he spoke. "I am
convinced of that," he said.</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>"Convinced that you mean to let her be carried off
before your very eyes! There's that long-shanked
simpleton Ray Tredgold: though he's a boy and a
fool, he has more sense than you. I saw him at her
bridle, assiduous enough, I can tell you, and Tredgold
himself settling her stirrup for her. Why weren't
you there? What the deuce do you mean by always
being out of the way when there's a really good
chance for you? And she must have seen you pass
under her very nose, taking no notice. A pretty way
to treat a lady, and the handsomest woman in the
country, and all the Biglow estate at her apron
strings!"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir, if you thought us negligent,"
said Edmund. "For my part, I think it would have
been very bad taste to interrupt her at that moment.
She had just arrived, she was with her particular
friend."</p>

<p>"What," said Mr. Mitford, with a laugh, "are you
still so soft in that quarter, Ned? To think any
woman in the world would prefer Pax Lemesurier to
an admirer of the other sex! We all know your
sentiments in that quarter, my boy: but women are
not such fools as to care for each other's company except
when there's nothing better to be got."</p>

<p>To this neither of the young men made any reply.
It is possible that they were themselves of the same
opinion, regarding it with blind faith as a sort of
mathematical axiom, recognized by everybody and beyond
the necessity of proof. But to a man who is
angry, and who is relieving his mind on a legitimate
subject, there is nothing so exasperating as silence.
It is worse than contradiction, for it implies disrespect.
It implies that he is not worth arguing with,

<!-- page 53 -->

that there is nothing for it but to bear with him and
let the tempest die away.</p>

<p>"You seem to have nothing to say for yourself," he
said, turning to Roger, "and I don't wonder. But at
least you know my opinion. You are acting like a
fool, in the first place, and how far it is strictly honorable"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Honorable!" exclaimed Roger, turning round suddenly
from where he had placed himself with his face
in shadow.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of you," said his father, with a
laugh. "Honorable,&mdash;that's what I said. According
to my old-fashioned code, it's distinctly not honorable
to persecute a girl with your attentions at one
time, and at another to carelessly fling her off."</p>

<p>"I have done neither one thing nor the other,"
cried Roger, roused to an outburst of indignation,
"nor has any one a right to say so. I have the greatest
respect for Miss Travers, and always have had.
And if any one but you, sir, ventured to speak so of
a lady whom&mdash;of a&mdash;of a girl who"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you want me to finish your sentence for you?&mdash;of
a lady whom you once admired very much, and
who is the best match in the country; of a girl who
would make a capital mistress to Melcombe, and complete
the estate in the most satisfactory way, so that
the family would be the better of it for generations.
I tell you what, Roger," said Mr. Mitford, relaxing,&mdash;"for
a quarrel between you and me can lead to
nothing agreeable,&mdash;the thing for you to do is to get
the Black Knight out to-morrow, and ride over to see
her. She will be quite willing to believe that you
prefer getting her all by herself, for the aunt, of
course, doesn't count; you can easily elude the aunt.
Do this, like a good fellow, and I'll be content."</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>Edmund's eyes conveyed a dozen messages while
this was being said, but how could his brother receive
them, having turned again his shoulder to the light?
No answer came for some time out of the shadow.
Perhaps the young man was struggling with himself;
perhaps it was only reluctance to reply, to meet the
softened tone with another contradiction. At last he
said abruptly, "I am sorry I can't go to-morrow. I
am otherwise engaged."</p>

<p>"Engaged! I should like to know what that means,"
said the father sharply.</p>

<p>"I've got something else to do," said Roger. "I've
various things to do. I've a number of letters
to write. I can't possibly spare to-morrow. It would
throw everything into arrears."</p>

<p>"Well," said the father, persistently amiable, "if
not to-morrow, let us say next day, or Thursday, at
all events, a day this week."</p>

<p>"I shall be busy all this week," Roger said, in a
sullen tone recognizable by both father and brother.
They knew his under lip had set firm, and the somewhat
too long upper one had closed down upon it like
a vise. Edmund, looking at him fixedly, in the hope
that he might glance up and take counsel from his
warning eyes, afforded a means to the Squire of giving
vent to his renewed wrath.</p>

<p>"What is all that telegraphing about?" he said.
"Ned, you had better mind your own business. You
want to advise your brother to be prudent, not to try
my patience too far. Let him alone; he had better
be honest and let me know exactly what he means,
since we're on the question. If he means to defeat
me in my first wish, let him say so, and then we can
fight fair."</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>"Roger means nothing of the kind, sir," said Edmund,
"though he may be driven to say so, if you
press him so hard. Good heavens, what is the use of
talking of what a man means! You know very well
that in most cases we mean nothing but just what happens
to hit our fancy for the moment. To defeat
you, no! I'll be bound for him that is not what he
means."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Ned," said Mr. Mitford.
"That's all very well for boys and women. I expect
I'm talking to a man when I talk to my eldest son.
How old is he? Three and thirty, if he's a day. Do
you mean to tell me that's an age at which a fellow
can go on philandering as if he were still a boy?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather, if it is the same to you," said Roger,
again suddenly shifting his position, and revealing a
face very white and obstinate, with a fiery glow under
the lowered eyelids, "that we discussed this matter,
father, you and I, instead of having it talked over like
this. Ned means very well, and would be kind if he
could, but he doesn't always understand." After receiving
this redding stroke, which is inevitably the
recompense of the third party, Edmund drew back a
little, involuntarily, from the table, pushing his chair
out of the circle of the lamplight. The two faces
which were within that round of light stood out like
those of actors upon the intimate stage of private life,
which is so much more exciting than any play.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Squire, "that's what I say.
Let us have it all honest and above board. You know
well enough what I want. I want the Biglow estate
added on to Melcombe, which is all for your own
advantage, not mine. It would not do me any good
if it were done to-morrow. And I want a woman that

<!-- page 56 -->

will be a credit to us, that can take the head of the
table, as your mother did, and make a fit mistress of
a family like ours. The first pretty girl that turns up
is not what I want, Roger. You're old enough to
know what's what, and not to be run away with by
any childish fancy. All these things I find in Lizzy
Travers. She's a fine, handsome creature, she's a
woman of sense, and she has got plenty of money and
just the land that is wanted to round off our own.
You looked as if you thought so, too, a little while ago.
Why, in the name of all that's idiotic, do you call off
now, and disappoint her (as I've no doubt you're
doing), and defy me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford warmed as he went on; the enumeration
of all Elizabeth's advantages fired his blood, and
the thought that for some whim, some caprice unworthy
of a man, some change of liking, all these advantages
might be thrown away, was intolerable to
him. He could not but feel that his son must be actuated
by something more than mere perversity, by
an undutiful impulse to go against him and thwart his
designs, which were so clearly for the benefit of the
family. That sons did so out of mere rebellion, and
injured themselves to spite their father, without any
other motive, Mr. Mitford thought he knew well. It
was one of their leading impulses, he was convinced.</p>

<p>The contrast between this superficial wrath and flow
of opposition on one side and the passion in Roger's
face was wonderful. He was quite pale; his eyelids
half drawn over his eyes, his nostrils drawn in, his
lips set tight. No petulance of contradiction such as
his father believed in, but a force of emotion which
was full of tragic elements, was in his face. He
cleared his throat two or three times before he could

<!-- page 57 -->

get possession of his voice. "In the first place," he
said, "Miss Travers's name must be put out of the
discussion once for all. We were never more than
good friends, she and I. Stop a little" (for Mr. Mitford
had given vent to a snort of contempt and the
scornful exclamation "Friends!"). "You have no
right, and I have no right, to speculate upon what she
thinks. A woman's mind is her own, I hope, as well
as a man's. That's only a small part of the question,
sir, I allow; the question is between you and me. If
I proposed to a lady and she rejected me, I suppose
you would not say that was my fault."</p>

<p>"But I should, sir," retorted his father; "certainly
I should, in this case. I should say it was your shameful
shilly-shally, your would and your wouldn't, your
reluctance to come to the point, that had disgusted the
girl, and with good reason; only somehow I have faith
in her, and I don't think it has."</p>

<p>Roger glared at his father with what he thought
was indignation on Elizabeth's account. "I refuse to
bring in her name. She has nothing to do with the
question," he cried. "The question is between you
and me, sir, and nobody else has anything to do with
it. I never had any such intention as you give me
credit for; but even if I once had, as you think, I
haven't now. I don't want to bind myself. I've
no desire to marry," Roger said. He made a slight
pause before he said these words, and plunged a
sudden glance into the shade where Edmund sat, as
if challenging him to interfere; and a sudden flush
of color rose on his own face. He added, hastily, "I
hope you don't think I'm capable of changing my
mind to annoy you. I cannot deny such an accusation,
because it's incredible. You can't think so

<!-- page 58 -->

badly of me, even if in the heat of the moment you
say it. But if my mind ever inclined towards that,
which it didn't, at least it does not now."</p>

<p>"And you think that's a reason," cried Mr. Mitford.
"By Jove! You ought to think a little,
Roger, what's your <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>. You've no profession,
you never do anything, you're the eldest son.
Just because it is unnecessary for you to work for
your living, being the eldest son, it's your business to
attend to this. You may call me brutal, if you like;
perhaps it's brutal, but it's true. This is your share
of the duty. If you don't do it"&mdash;Mr. Mitford
got up from his chair almost violently, pushing it
away from the table. Then he paused, and looked at
his son from the vantage ground of his height and
attitude. "Whether it's from mere caprice, whether
it's for other reasons,"&mdash;and here, to Roger's troubled
ear, his voice sounded full of meaning,&mdash;"whatever
is the cause, you had better look to it, my boy.
Though you're the eldest son"&mdash;said the Squire,
turning away, "please to remember that in our family
there's no eldest son, so to speak, further than a
parent may please."</p>

<p>He went away as he spoke, bursting through the
door which opened into the drawing-room. Though
he had avoided that way of reaching his own special
retirement since little Nina had taken up her abode in
it, his excitement was so great that he forgot his usual
habit to-night, and a scream from Nina, faintly heard
in the noisy shutting of the door, testified to her wonder
rather than pleasure at the sight of the unexpected
figure pushing through her usually silent rooms. His
two sons sat immovable in their astonishment, watching
this stormy exit. It was but recently that Mr.

<!-- page 59 -->

Mitford had permitted himself to lose his temper, and
they stared at each other with looks which were far
from comfortable. The Squire in their younger days
had been very decorous; if he had never sought the
confidence and friendship of his boys, at least he had
seldom repulsed them, and never threatened. But
lately his temper had become worse, and on this occasion
excitement (or was it policy?) had carried him
quite out of himself. They heard Nina's frightened
little outcry, then a quick and rather angry dialogue,
and then the shutting of the distant library door,
which indicated that he had entered his own room
for the evening. Roger had become very calm, very
silent, in the midst of this sensation. "What do
you suppose <i>that</i> means?" he said at last, when the
echoes of the alarmed house had died away. "I did
not think my father would have adopted such vulgar
methods," he said.</p>

<p>"He meant nothing," said Edmund, in his usual
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of peace-maker. "And you might have temporized
a little. You could not have been forced into
matrimony at a moment's notice. Why not yield a
little, and keep the peace?"</p>

<p>"There has been too much sacrificed to keeping the
peace." Roger got up and began to walk about the
room, his figure moving up and down like a shadow
outside the circle of the light. "I can't keep it up,"
he cried. "I cannot go on like this. The best thing
for me, if I could but do it, would be to go away."</p>

<p>"And why not? Why not go to town for a month
or two? There's nothing tragical about that, no
grand decision involved. Go up for the season, and
cut this knot, whatever it is."</p>

<!-- page 60 -->

<p>"You speak at your ease," said the elder brother,
looking out of the shadow at Edmund's thoughtful
face, in which there was no struggle, only a shade of
sympathy and anxiety. Roger was torn by sensations
very different,&mdash;by passion contending with all
the restraints of life, and thought, and better judgment.
"It is an easy matter for you," he repeated,
with a certain bitterness; "to settle other people's
affairs is always the simplest thing in the world."</p>

<p>"I don't even know what your affairs are," said the
other. "I suggest no settling; take a moment's
pause, as you may so well do. No one can have a
word to say, if you start off for town now. It is the
moment when everybody is going. And whatever
there may be to decide, get it at arm's length, get it
in perspective," Edmund said.</p>

<p>Roger stared at him almost fiercely for an instant,
then came back and flung himself down again in his
chair. "Don't insult a man with your artist's jargon,"
he said; then changing his tone in a moment, "That's
just what I do, Ned,&mdash;that's just what I do&mdash;too
much. I can't get any natural action out of myself
for that. My father thinks I mean to cross him. I
don't. I see the sense of all he or you can say, though
you drove me mad with your talk about what was
suitable. I know it well enough. He's right, and
you are right, and nobody knows so well as I do all
the trouble that's in it, or how good it would be to
take the other way. But"&mdash;said Roger, staring into
the white heat of the lamp, with eyes that were full
of glowing fire&mdash;"but"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Edmund stretched across the table, and laid his
hand on his brother's arm. There are moments when

<!-- page 61 -->

the most sympathetic can do nothing, can say nothing,
that may not turn to exasperation instead of solace.
The touch was all he could venture on. Already
both had forgotten the father's threat, if threat it
were.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p class="small">NINA.</p>

</div>

<p>THE drawing-room at Melcombe had a succession
of window recesses, or rather projections built out
from the level of the room, like little porticoes inclosed
with walls, where all the brightness of the sunshine
concentrated, and where a silent little reader or
thinker might rest unseen, whoever went or came. It
was in one of these that Edmund found his sister the
next morning. She had appropriated the little nook,
which was oblong, with an opening opposite the great
window like a doorway into the drawing-room. On
the cushioned seat which ran all around Nina had
accumulated her treasures. She had a work-basket
full of bright-colored wools and silks, always in disorder,
and pieces of work at which she sometimes
labored for half an hour at a time. She had a few
books scattered upon the seat: a novel always in
course of reading; a book of poetry, about which she
was not very particular so long as it was verse; and a
volume of that vague morality and philosophy beaten
down into a sugared pulp, which has at all times been
thought the right thing for young ladies. It need
scarcely be said that the little girl never opened it,
but it represented the higher literature to her unsophisticated
soul. She had what she called her "drawing
things" upon the table beside her, so that in case
an inspiration moved she might fly to her pencil, like

<!-- page 63 -->

a heroine in an old-fashioned novel, without loss of
time. She never did so, but what did that matter?
An old guitar, which Nina had found in a lumber-room,
hung by a faded ribbon from the wall, so that
she might equally soothe her mind with that, if any
sudden pressure of affairs suggested music as the natural
relief to an overburdened soul. To be sure, Nina
did not know how to play, but that made no difference.
Had the necessity existed, no doubt the knowledge
would have come. On the whole, the little thing
pleased herself much with these simple preparations
for every emergency, and as no emergency occurred
read her novel in peace, or when there was any bazaar
in prospect, for which her married sisters claimed her
aid, would seize her crewels and work for a whole
twenty minutes. She led a very useless life, much
unlike the present habits of high-minded girls. She
had nothing to do, and did nothing. She learned
nothing. She did not improve her mind. She had
no part in the operations of the household. In short,
she existed only like one of the flowers in the garden.
She loved the guitar, which she called a lute, and the
drawing things, and the poetry book, and the crewels,
which she called embroidery. These were all accessories
to the little part she had to play: but her novels
were old-fashioned, and so was her ideal, and she did
not know that any more was intended in the constitution
of a little girl belonging to a county family.
Geraldine and the rest had married, that was true,
and entered upon another kind of existence, which
Nina supposed, some time or other, she too would
have to do. But she did not speculate on that change,
it was not within the range of any near possibilities,
and the little mind did not require the stimulus of

<!-- page 64 -->

any such subject for dreams. Lily Ford, in her room
which opened on the garden, dreamed all day long,&mdash;dreamed
with passion, inventing for her future endless
pleasures, splendors, and delights; but Nina, in
her window-seat, was quite quiescent, pleased with the
days as they came. To be sure, Lily was the elder
by three years, and her position was not the assured
and simple one held by the little lady at the Hall.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are here, Nina," said Edmund, coming
in. He placed himself in the basket-chair, which,
though it was well cushioned, always creaked, and
disturbed Nina's quiet. "I thought you might be
out, as it is such a fine morning. You don't go out
half enough."</p>

<p>"I have no one to go with, Edmund. It is rather
dull always going out alone."</p>

<p>"So it is. If you would only be a little bolder,
Nina, and get upon a horse, you could ride with
Roger or me. One of us would always be glad to
go."</p>

<p>This was one of the little habitual things which
Nina knew were said without much meaning. Oh,
yes, no doubt Edmund meant them when he said
them. But his sister was too shy to keep him to his
word. She was not so timid as was supposed, and
had got, if not upon a horse, yet upon a pony, many
times with impunity, and ridden soberly about the
park. But the idea that Nina was not bold enough
to ride had always been kept up. Though she was
so simple, she quite understood this little fiction, and
that it was not at all in her <i>r&ocirc;le</i> to call upon her
brothers to go out with her; for little persons like
Nina, with all their innocence, often know things
which they are not supposed to know.</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>"Thank you very much, Edmund," she said. "I
am quite happy here. I am at a very interesting bit
in my book. I am not quite sure, but I almost think
that Ethelbert is going to turn out Lord Wilfrid's
son, which would quite explain the sympathy that
Emily felt for him the first time she saw him. It is
the most interesting book"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would rather I went away, and let
you unravel the mystery," Edmund said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; oh, dear, no!" exclaimed Nina, putting
down the volume upon its face. "I would a thousand
times rather talk to you. And there's something
I want to ask you, Edmund. What was papa
so angry about last night?"</p>

<p>"Last night? Oh, it was nothing, my dear. One
of us displeased him. Either Roger or I said something
that brought on a discussion; nothing you need
trouble your little head about."</p>

<p>"But I do trouble my head. How can I help it?
I know it was Roger, and not you. I heard loud
voices, sounding quite angry, and then I went and sat
close to the door."</p>

<p>"Do you think that was quite right, Nina? It is
not the thing for a lady to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was not <i>listening!</i>" cried Nina. "I did
not look through the key-hole, or anything like that.
I only sat near the door. And then I heard papa
scolding,&mdash;oh, scolding! worse than he ever did,
even at Geraldine. I couldn't help hearing. Then
he bounced in when I was sitting there, never expecting
it. What made him come through the drawing-room
last night? I started up as if I had been shot,
and then he said something disagreeable to me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you deserved it this time," said

<!-- page 66 -->

Edmund, shaking his head. "You should not sit
near the door; you might hear something that you
were not intended to hear."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is exactly why"&mdash;&mdash; Then she stopped
short, in confusion. "I mean," she said, looking as
if about to cry, while Edmund continued to shake his
head, "that I never know anything&mdash;about anything!
And why shouldn't I find out, if I can? It
is so dull at night, sitting all by one's self here."</p>

<p>"I ought to have thought of that," said Edmund;
"of course it is dull. I'll make a point of coming
in and sitting with you in the future, Nina, if you
will promise not to sit near the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you very much, Edmund," said Nina.
She was aware that this promise was about as much
to be depended upon as that of riding with her, if she
could but ride; but repression had taught this little
creature wisdom, and she accepted the offer as a
benevolent form. "It was about Roger getting married,"
she said, nodding her head in her turn.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that? You must not
say a word of anything of the kind. Roger is not
going to be married."</p>

<p>"I know," said Nina. "I think I know more than
you do, or papa either, but I am sure I would never
tell."</p>

<p>"You know about Roger? Nonsense, my dear
little girl, you must not even think on such a subject.
There is nothing for you to know."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is," said Nina, once more nodding
her head. "I knew first from what Simmons said.
And then I rode round by the West Lodge, and there
I saw."</p>

<p>"I thought that you said a minute ago you would
never tell."</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>"Not to any one else," replied the girl, "but you
and I are just the same as himself, Edmund. I
would not tell papa for the world. Did you ever see
Lily Ford? I think she is beautiful. There are not
very many beautiful people like women in books.
Perhaps she is not quite up to that, but she is the
beautifulest I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said Edmund, endeavoring to laugh
the revelations off. "Prettier than Geraldine? You
couldn't mean that: and 'beautifulest' is not a
word."</p>

<p>"It is what I mean," said Nina. "Geraldine? Oh,
Geraldine!&mdash;she was just Geraldine, nicer than anybody.
It did not matter in the least whether she was
beautiful or not. But Lily Ford is like somebody in
a book. I once read a poem about a beautiful maiden
in a garden, don't you know? She is like that. She
walks out among the flowers, and she never goes anywhere
else except to church, and Mrs. Simmons says
she doesn't know what her parents are thinking of;
and then they always say something about Roger, but
they don't let me hear what they say."</p>

<p>"You hear a great deal too much, I think," cried
Edmund. "Nina, you ought to know it is not fit for
a young lady to listen to what the servants say."</p>

<p>"Who am I to speak to, then?" asked Nina, the
tears rising to her eyes. "Am I never to hear anything
that anybody says?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Edmund, "I see how wrong
we have all been. It is a shame that you should be
driven to that, you poor little girl among all us men.
But there is always the Rectory, Nina, when you're
dull," he hastily said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not at all dull. I like home the best:

<!-- page 68 -->

but I can't help thinking about what is going on. I
like to ride past the West Lodge, the garden is always
so pretty. And when it is warm you can look in at
the window and see Lily sitting at work. I believe
she's making some things for me," the girl added,
with a certain sense of pride and proprietorship in
Lily. "Roger is there almost every day."</p>

<p>"Nina! for Heaven's sake, don't go on with these
revelations. All this information is quite out of your
way. If Roger knew, he would be very angry; he
would think you were watching him."</p>

<p>"So I was," admitted Nina quietly, "more or less;
for I wanted to know. When you hear all sorts of
things said of your brother, and especially when you
see that they don't want you to hear what they
say"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must be removed out of the hands of those
servants," said Edmund. "It is not at all good for
you. Don't you know the difference between educated
and uneducated people, Nina? You have no
right to listen to them. You don't hear people of our
own class"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Edmund! why, everybody does it; not about
Roger before us, but about others. The Tredgolds,
and even Pax. Pax was saying the other day that
Amy Tredgold went out a great deal too much when
she was in London, and that our Stephen"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't say any more, please. I dare say we all
talk about our neighbors more than is necessary. But
you must not listen to the servants. As for Roger,
he would be very angry. You must know, if you
heard anything at the door, oh, Nina! that this
was not what my father was speaking to Roger
about."</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>"No," said Nina, after a pause, fixing her eyes
upon her brother as if there might be a great deal
more to say; but though her eyes were eloquent she
spoke no further word. For the next half hour or
more Edmund kept his place, and made conversation
for his little sister. He did his duty manfully, using
every endeavor to make her forget the subject on
which she had herself been the speaker. He told her
about the books he had been reading, giving her at
considerable length the plot of a new novel, with a
description of the leading characters and their actions.
He told her about some discoveries in which the fairy
tales of science, the beautiful part of research, came
in as they do not always come in, even in its most
beneficent spheres. He told her about the last great
traveler who had made a track across the black continent.
To all of which Nina responded with a little
swift interrogative Yes? with a No! of wonder, with
the milder Indeeds, and Oh, Edmunds, of attention.
She gave him her ear devoutly for one thing as much
as the other, and laughed, and clasped her hands, and
looked astonished and dismayed, just when it was right
for her to show these sentiments. But when at last
he got up and left her, Edmund was by no means sure
that Nina had not seen through him all the time, that
she had not been quite aware of his purpose, and
laughing in her little sleeve at his attempts to beguile
her. He thought to himself, as he went away, considerably
exhausted with his exertions and with the uncertainty
of having at all succeeded in them, that he
would never undervalue little Nina's intelligence again.
What she had told him was not new to him. He had
known very well where Roger was going when he
turned along; the west road from the station. He had

<!-- page 70 -->

understood what his brother meant when he betrayed
the uneasiness of his troublous passion in talk which
pretended to be abstract. But Nina's little matter-of-fact
story, her glimpses into the conclusions of the
servants, added a pang of reality to the visionary picture
which Edmund had made to himself. As it was
in Edmund's fancy, it might have gone on for months
or years before coming to any crisis; but in a moment,
by the illumination of all these sharp little commonplace
lights, he saw how immediate and how urgent
the danger was. There had been in Edmund's mind
a lingering incredulity, the conviction of a man in his
sound senses that love, in the gravest sense of the
word, for the keeper's daughter was after all an impossibility;
that it was a freak of fancy rather than a
serious passion which had occupied his brother. How
in Ford's cottage, within the ken of the father and
mother, amid all the homely circumstances of their
life, Roger should have been so fatally enthralled it
seemed impossible to conceive; and by Lily Ford, the
little half-educated, conventional enchantress, with all
the sentimentalities of her boarding-school about her,
her artificial superiority, her little romantic graces!
If she had been an unconscious, dutiful, rustic maiden,
helpful and sweet, Edmund thought he could have
understood it better. But for a man who had known
and liked, if not loved, Elizabeth Travers, who had
owed something of his development to Pax, that
he should throw his life away for Lily Ford! The
wonder of it took away Edmund's breath; yet he had
no resource but to believe it now.</p>

<p>And what was worst of all was that he could think
of no way of helping Roger. His father's threats, his
insistence in respect to that other matter so plainly

<!-- page 71 -->

impossible, the mere suggestion of which was an insult
and injury to the lady,&mdash;so much too good, Edmund
said to himself indignantly, for any one of them at
their best,&mdash;would of course throw Roger more and
more into his fatal entanglement, and make all deliverance
hopeless. And there seemed nothing that any
one could do. Remonstrance was futile; the time for
it was past; and what advantage could there be in
pointing out the frightful drawbacks, the miseries involved
in such a connection to the unfortunate who
saw them all, and yet could not resist the infatuation
which was stronger than reason? It was not thus,
perhaps, that Edmund would have regarded a love
which was superior to all obstacles, had it not approached
himself so nearly. He realized in the present
case with a heavy force of fact, more telling than
imagination, what it would be to have Lily Ford the
mistress of his father's house.</p>

<p>In the perplexity of his mind he found himself following
instinctively a path which he had perhaps trod
oftener than any other during the whole course of his
life, the path that led to the Rectory. He knew that
Pax at her window would see him coming, and would
divine that he was in trouble, and that his errand to
her was the selfish one of unburdening his soul. How
often had he unburdened his soul to Pax, in every
kind of embarrassment and distress!&mdash;even when the
disturbing element was herself, when he had so loved
her in her full maturity, so hotly wanted to marry
her, so insisted that the obstacles were of no importance!
He still loved Pax; but the thought of his
boyish projects in respect to her sometimes brought
the hot color to his face, sometimes overwhelmed him
with a desire to laugh. It had become ludicrous, impossible,

<!-- page 72 -->

as no doubt it had been always, had he had
eyes to see. The recollection of his folly came strongly
back to him as he ran up the familiar stairs, and went
in unannounced, with a little tap at the door. Perhaps
she thought of it, too, as she turned half round
to greet him, holding out her hand with a "Well, Edmund!"
looking at him in the tall, narrow mirror
which stood between the two side windows, and which
was always the medium through which she contemplated
her intimate visitors. Pax was of opinion that
she understood people better when she first saw their
faces and unconscious expression in this old-fashioned
greenish glass.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said, throwing himself down upon a
chair opposite to her. "I'm out of heart and out of
humor, and as usual I've come to you to be consoled."</p>

<p>"That's quite natural," said Pax. "What is it
about?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you&mdash;everything," cried the young
man. And then he took up a piece of work which lay
on the table, and began to examine it gravely, as if
he knew all about it. And so, indeed, he did; for
Pax kept a piece of work by her, for state occasions,
for the afternoon when people called, which made
slow progress, and had no connection with the big
work-basket, always overflowing, which stood on the
other side of her chair. "You were at this leaf, or
thereabouts, last time I was on the verge of suicide,"
he said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"And I shall be at another leaf next time," Pax
answered calmly. "There is just enough of the pattern
to keep me going till I deliver you over into the
hands of your wife."</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>"My wife! I shall never have one, Pax."</p>

<p>"Not till you are married," said Miss Lemesurier.
"But I don't suppose that is what troubles you now."</p>

<p>He made no answer for some time, and then he
burst forth suddenly, "I don't think it's good for
Nina to be all alone as she is. That little thing is
far sharper than any of us think."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Pax, "that you have found that
out."</p>

<p>"She ought not to be left to the servants, to pick
up the gossip of the house."</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said Pax, "that you have found
that out. I hope your father sees it, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father!" Edmund said impatiently: with
an angry sense that however Roger might err, the
Squire surely ought to have known better, if anybody
should.</p>

<p>"And I don't see how it is to be remedied unless
one of you were to marry."</p>

<p>"To marry!" Edmund exclaimed again: and there
suddenly gleamed upon him another vision of Lily
Ford in the chief place at home, training, restraining,
his little sister. A flush of angry color came over his
face. "You are very keen upon marriages," he cried,
with an instinctive endeavor to give a prick in return.
"You used not to be so, if I remember right."</p>

<p>Pax looked into the mirror, and saw herself seated
there, mature and motherly, while the young man,
flung into his chair in languor and discontent, sat
gloomy before her. She uttered an involuntary
thanksgiving within herself. If I had been such a
fool! she thought, and thanked Heaven: then spoke
sedately. "For right marriages always,&mdash;for wrong
never," she said, with emphasis. "Come, I know
that's what you are upset about."</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"I have no right to be upset," he said. "I suppose
I've nothing to do with it. Am I my brother's
keeper? Probably he is better able to judge than I
am and I'm a meddling fool to think I could interfere."</p>

<p>Pax raised her eyes and looked at him seriously,
but she did not help him out: and he sat pulling her
work about, snipping at stray threads as if that had
been the most important occupation in the world;
then he suddenly tossed it from him, nearly overturning
the light table.</p>

<p>"I should have thought," he cried angrily, "that
you would have known all about it. Here is one of
the storms that are periodical in our house,&mdash;my
father raging, and Roger going to&mdash;the devil."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Pax, "not so bad as that."</p>

<p>"What do you call not so bad? He might be
more bad and do less harm. Imagine Lily Ford at
Melcombe, the lady of the house!"</p>

<p>"Has it gone so far?" said Pax, in a tone of alarm.
"You ought not to speak so to me, Edmund, about
less harm: but still I know what you mean. I can't
think it's so bad as that."</p>

<p>"Can you think of my brother, then, as a scoundrel?"
cried the young man, changing his view in a
moment, as the caprice of his troubled mind suggested.
Then he came to his senses in the relief of
having thus disburdened himself. "I fear," he said,
"it has gone as far as that. I don't see what else
can come. Roger is not a fellow to&mdash;he is not a
man that could&mdash;&mdash; You know what I mean, Pax.
He is too good, and too tender-hearted, and too honorable.
He could neither deceive a woman nor desert
her, even if he wanted to."</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p>"Does he want to?" Pax paused a moment, not
expecting any answer to her question; then she said
slowly, "There is still one way out of it: there is the
girl herself."</p>

<p>"The girl herself!" Edmund cried, with unmeasured
astonishment and almost contempt.</p>

<p>"She is in a very artificial position; but she is a
natural, silly little thing, with a will of her own;
when that is the case there is never any telling," Pax
in her wisdom said.</p>

<p>ON the same morning a consultation of a very different
kind was going on at the West Lodge. The
scene was the little parlor which to poor Roger had
been a place of fatal enchantment. It bore, perhaps,
a different aspect in the morning, but it is doubtful
if any circumstances, even the chill daylight with all
its revelations, even Mrs. Ford in the midst of her
morning's work, with all the common accessories of
household labor about her, could now have affected
the mind of the lover. Perhaps if at the first he had
seen the mother on her knees "doing" the grate,
while Lily in her pretty dress, not fit even to be
touched by those grimy fingers, stood by and looked
on, the contrast might have affected his imagination;
but who could tell? He might have found it only an
accentuation of the wonder how out of so homely a
soil such a flower could have grown. To the chief
actors themselves there was nothing in the least remarkable
in the situation. Mrs. Ford on her knees
before the hearth, with a brush in her hands and the
glow of exertion on her face, had paused, looking up
from her work to speak, while Lily stood by in the
brown velveteen which had been her winter dress, and
which, to do her justice, she had made herself, with
pretty white frills round the hands which were free

<!-- page 77 -->

from any trace of labor, a few early primroses pinned
upon her breast, and her silky hair shining in the sun.
The glass door was open, the sunshine streaming in,
the garden ablaze with those crocuses of which the
keeper's wife had boasted, the little room all glorified
by the light, which, however, at the same time remorselessly
showed those poverties of over-decoration
and vulgarity of ornament of which its inmates were
unconscious. Mrs. Ford was making an appeal which
was almost impassioned, and which suited very well
with her attitude, if not with her occupation&mdash;while
Lily listened somewhat impatient, very decided in her
adverse opinion, pulling the threads unconsciously out
of a scrap of linen which she held in her hands.</p>

<p>"My pet," said Mrs. Ford, "it's time to think
serious, if ever you thought serious in your life. I'm
dead frightened, and that's the truth. I've always
looked, I don't deny it, for a 'usband for you as could
give you a different 'ome from this. We've done our
best, your father and me, to make it a nice 'ouse.
We've done a deal for you, Lily, though may be you
don't see it. But it's not a place now for the likes
of you, brought up a lady, and naturally looking for
things as was never wanted by him or me. Still we've
done a deal more than most folks approved of our
doing; we've done the most we could."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Lily impatiently, "what is the use
of going over all this again, mother? I never said
you hadn't been awfully good."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mean to say <i>that</i>," resumed Mrs.
Ford, drying her eyes with her apron. She was apt
to be tearful when she insisted on Lily's excellences,
or humbly put forth her own attempts to do justice to
them. "But we've done what we could, and I've

<!-- page 78 -->

always hoped for a 'usband as could do more, and that
I won't deny."</p>

<p>"Well, mother!" said Lily again.</p>

<p>"But, dear," cried the keeper's wife, "you mustn't
look too high! Oh, Lily, you mustn't look too high!
When Mr. Roger first came here I was a bit flattered;
that I don't deny. I felt as if it was a great compliment.
Him to come in quite friendly like, and take a
chair, and talk to you and me. It was not as if it had
been talking to your father about them things as men
can go on about for hours. Senseless things, <i>I</i> think,
but then, that's their way. And that he should be
taken up with you was natural, and asking questions,
for you were his mother's pet, there's not a doubt of
that. I was flattered like, I won't deny it. But since
Christmas I've took fright, Lily. I've got more and
more frightened every day. I've tried my best to say
as you were busy, as you were out,&mdash;any excuse I
could think of."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother."</p>

<p>"You would thank me, if you thought a bit. Lily,
you don't know the world; if you were as old as me,
you would know that nothing good ever comes of a
gentleman visiting in a poor 'ouse. He may mean no
harm, and she may mean no harm, but it comes to
harm in spite of 'em both."</p>

<p>"Mother!" exclaimed Lily, with great indignation,
"how dare you speak like that to me! Harm! Do
you think I'm one of the poor creatures that forget
themselves, that get into danger and trouble,&mdash;me!
If you think that of me, I wonder you don't turn me
out of your house."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lily!" cried the anxious mother. She gazed
at the girl for a moment with hands uplifted, then

<!-- page 79 -->

turned round hastily and addressed herself to the grate
with great fervor of exertion, making her brush ring
into all the corners. After a minute or two of this
active work Mrs. Ford turned round again. "You
put me to silence and you put me to shame," she said,
rising from her knees. "You've got learning enough
and sense enough to get the better of a dozen like me,
but you didn't ought to, Lily, however things are&mdash;for
I'm your mother: and that's more than learning,
or foreign languages, or playing the pianny,&mdash;ay, or
even taking views."</p>

<p>"Mother, of course it is," assented the girl. "I
never would have been nasty to you if you hadn't
been nasty to me, supposing for a moment that I was
like one of the victims in a story-book, and that harm
of that description could ever happen to me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford accepted Lily's kiss with a tearful smile.
"Hold off the brush," she said, "or it'll make a mark
on you. Oh, Lily, my pet, you're never nasty to me,&mdash;only
I'm silly about you, and I take everything to
heart. And as for Mr. Roger&mdash;no, I ain't easy in
my mind about Mr. Roger. I can't say I am, for it
wouldn't be true."</p>

<p>"Why, what could Roger do?" said the girl, with
a triumphant smile. "Nothing but what I like, you
may be sure."</p>

<p>"That may be, or that mayn't be," replied Mrs.
Ford, shaking her head; "but what I'm thinking of
is his father, Lily. His father, he can do just what
he pleases. He can turn us out of this house, which
is the nicest I ever was in for its size, and where I'd
like to end my days. He could turn your father out
of his place. He can hunt us all out of the parish,
away from everybody we know. Oh, you think nobody

<!-- page 80 -->

could do that? But you're mistaken, Lily. The
Squire can do whatever he wants to do. It's awful
power for one man, but he can. I have heard say he
can leave all his money away from his sons, if they
don't please him, and that's what frightens me. Oh,
Lily, Mr. Roger, he's too grand; he's not the 'usband
I'd choose for you."</p>

<p>"Too grand,&mdash;nobody's too grand," said the girl;
and then she laughed. "For that matter, your favorite
Mr. Witherspoon thinks a deal more of the difference
between himself and the keeper than Mr. Roger
does. A fine scientific gardener,&mdash;oh, that's a great
deal more grand than the young Squire."</p>

<p>"Lily, Lily! there you are, always laughing at the
steady young man that could give you a nice home,
and furnish it nicely, and keep a servant, and everything.
That's what would please me. Better than
us, but not so much better that he would throw your
father and mother in your face, with a good trade that
he could carry anywhere. Oh, that is the kind of man
for me! All the masters in the world couldn't frighten
that one, they couldn't do him no harm. He's sure
of a place somewhere else, if he has to leave here.
Squire may fret as he likes, he can't do no harm to
him. Oh, Lily, if it was me"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And how are ye the day, Miss Lily? and did ye
like the sparrygrass?" cried the girl, with an imitation
of the gardener's Scotch. "Oh, mother, how you
can like that man! He may be nice enough, and
respectable enough, and all that, but he is not a gentleman,"
Lily said, with great dignity, drawing herself
up.</p>

<p>"And that's what I like him for," replied her
mother.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p>Lily gave Mrs. Ford a look of mingled indignation
and superiority. "I shall never have anything to say
to a man who is not a gentleman," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness gracious me!" the mother cried.</p>

<p>Neither to Mrs. Ford's exclamation nor to her attitude
of despair did Lily pay any attention. She seated
herself at the table, opened a little fancy box in which
were her thimble and scissors, and drew towards her
the needlework she was doing for Nina at Melcombe.
It was a work which went on slowly, subject to many
interruptions, but still it was the occupation to which
she sat down morning after morning, when the grate
was done and the fire lit. The fire was now blazing
up brightly, and everything was cheerful within and
without: the crocuses all expanding under the sunshine,
the same brightness flooding in at the open door,
the brisk little fire modifying what sharpness there
still might linger in the March air. The only shadow
in this brilliant little spot was Mrs. Ford, standing on
the other side of the table, with her black brush in
one hand and her broom in the other, disconsolately
leaning upon that latter implement, and looking at her
daughter with troubled eyes. Lily had taken her seat
opposite the window. She had laid out a pretty mass
of white muslin and lace upon the table; her graceful
person, her shining head, the flowers on her bosom, all
harmonious and delightful, made the picture perfect.
If her features wanted regularity, who could pause
upon that point, in the general radiance of beauty and
health and satisfaction that shone about her? In
short, who could take that beauty to pieces, or question
which part of it was more or less near perfection, who
had ever fallen under the spell of her presence? Six
months ago Lily had been conscious of that spell.

<!-- page 82 -->

She had been very willing to exercise it if it existed,
and fully and fervently believed that the something
which would certainly come would be something to
her advancement and glory. But still it had all been
vague. She had not known what kind of fly would
stumble into her shining web. When Mr. Witherspoon,
the gardener, appeared, her heart had fluttered;
she had for a little while supposed that he might be,
if not the hero, at least the master, of her fate. But
Lily's ideas had much enlarged since those days. She
had learned what triumph was. Visions very different
from that of the gardener's two-storied, blue-slated
house had passed before her eyes. That man of science
who condescended to love her, and wished to improve
her mind, was very different from the young Squire,
who found all her little ignorances half divine. Roger,
with his straight, well-dressed figure, standing up as
she had seen him first, asking, was this Lily? stroking
his mustache as he looked at her, had been, in comparison
with the solid gardener, romance and beauty
embodied to the ambitious girl, who, suddenly enlightened
by this revelation, awoke to the certainty that no
man who was not a gentleman could ever satisfy her.
And since then&mdash;well, since then&mdash;&mdash; As she mused a
conscious smile lighted up her face; since then perhaps
other and still more splendid revelations had
come.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing to yourself at?" said Mrs.
Ford, who sometimes felt a prick of exasperation even
with her darling. "You're thinking of Mr. Roger,
and that he'll make a lady of you; but suppose his
father leaves everything away from him? Oh, Lily,
you don't know what it is, trying to be a lady, and
nothing to do it with. It's worse, a deal worse,

<!-- page 83 -->

than living poor and thinking nothing different, like
we do."</p>

<p>"Mr. Roger!" cried Lily, with a toss of her head.
"One would think there wasn't a gentleman in the
world but Mr. Roger, to hear you speak."</p>

<p>"There's none as comes here, at least," Mrs. Ford
said.</p>

<p>The conscious smile grew upon Lily's face. It
seemed on the eve of bursting into a laugh of happy
derision. But she made no reply in words; indeed,
she bent down her face to hide the smile which she
could not conceal, and did not intend to explain.</p>

<p>"Leastways, not as I know," her mother continued,
with a vague suspicion passing like a cloud over her
mind. She gave a moment to a hurried, frightened
reflection on this subject, and then said to herself that
it was impossible. Why, Lily was never out of her
sight, never away from her, never wished to be away,
or take her freedom, like other girls. Lily was quite
satisfied to be always within her mother's shadow.
Mrs. Ford felt a glow of happy pride as she remembered
this, and it drove all her doubts and painful
anticipations out of her mind. "My pet," she said,
"there's a many things to be thought of afore you
marry, and in particular if you marry out of your
own kind. I don't call Mr. Witherspoon that, or even
young Mr. Barnes, or Harry Gill, though he's as well
off as can be."</p>

<p>"A gardener, a farmer, and a horse-dealer!" exclaimed
Lily, letting out her suppressed laugh, but
with an <i>&eacute;clat</i> of derision in it. "What fine gentlemen,
to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lily!" cried the troubled mother. "There's
not one of them but would be a grand match for Ford

<!-- page 84 -->

the keeper's daughter. Now listen a bit to me. As
far as that you can go, and none of them could say
you nay when you had your father and your mother
up of an evening, or to sit with you when you were
lonely, or have a bit of dinner at Christmas, or that.
They mightn't be fond to see us too often, but they'd
never say a word so far as that goes."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," said Lily, growing red. "<i>My</i>
father and mother! If they were not proud to see you,
I should know the reason why."</p>

<p>"Oh, my sweet! I always knew as you'd be like
that. But, Lily," continued Mrs. Ford, with bated
breath, "what if it was the Hall! I've been through
the rooms once with Mrs. Simmons, when she was in
a good humor because of the game. Oh, Lily! I
felt as if I ought to take off my shoes. I'd no more
have sat down in one of them golden chairs, or touched
the sofas, except, may be, with a soft clean duster,
than I'd have flown. I couldn't have done it. Velvet
beneath your feet, and velvet on the very footstools,
and you couldn't turn round but you'd see yourself
on every side. I declare, I was nigh saying to Mrs.
Simmons, 'Who's that vulgar, common person as
you're showing round, and what's the likes of her got
to do there?' and it was just me."</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Lily, coldly. She held her
head very high, and there was a crimson flush on her
face. The view was, no doubt, new to her, and
wounded her pride, perhaps also her heart, deeply.
She spoke with a little difficulty, her throat dry with
sudden passion.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling child, supposing as you was to lead
Mr. Roger on, and let him come and come, till he
hadn't no control of himself no more; and that's

<!-- page 85 -->

what it's coming to. And supposing as it come to
that as you was married. And supposing the Squire
didn't make no objection, but gave in to him because
you was so pretty,&mdash;as has happened before now. Lily,
what would you do with your father and your mother
then?" asked the good woman, solemnly. "Would
you have us up to one o' your grand dinners, and set
us down at your grand table, with Mr. Larkins, as has
always been such a friend to your father, to wait?
It makes me hot and cold all over just to think of
it. Your father always says Mr. Larkins, he's such a
good friend; and suppose he was standing up behind
my chair to help me to the potatoes, or pour Ford out
a glass of beer. Lord, I'd sink through the floor
with shame, and so would your father."</p>

<p>Poor Lily had been foolish in many of her little
ways, but she was miserable enough while she listened
to this speech to make up for much. She saw the
scene in her quick imagination, and she too shivered:
the terrible Squire at the end of the table, and delicate
little Miss Nina, and all the ladies and gentlemen; and
in the midst of them her father and mother, and Larkins
grinning over their shoulders! Lily's own heart
sank at the thought of how she would herself come
through if exposed to that ordeal; but father and
mother! She sat bolt upright in the keen pang of her
wounded pride: for it was all true; it was true, and
more. She felt as her mother said, as if she too, in
shame and mortification, would sink through the floor.</p>

<p>"If it should ever come to that," she said, with a
gasp, "I should like to see&mdash;any one that would dare
to look down upon father and you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my pet, I knew you would feel like that; but
how could you stop it, Lily? You couldn't stop it,

<!-- page 86 -->

my dear. You would have to get all new servants, for
one thing, and they would turn out just as bad as the
old ones. There's no way as you could work it, my
pretty,&mdash;no way!"</p>

<p>"If it was like that, I should give up all company
altogether, and you should come and see me in my
own room, where nobody could interfere," declared
Lily. But then the strain of her tone relaxed, the
hot color faded, and she laughed with a tremulous
mirth in which there was an evident sense of escape.
"It might have come to that once, mother," she said,
"but not now. No, not now,&mdash;I know better now.
If it was Windsor Castle he had to offer, instead of
Melcombe Hall, I wouldn't have him. Don't you
worry yourself about that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford gave a gasp of amazement. She had
meant to make the drawback very clear, but she had
not intended to be thus taken at her word. That
Lily would weep and protest that no such indignities
should ever be possible in <i>her</i> house, be it ever so
splendid, was what she meant, but no more.</p>

<p>"Lily," she said, "Lord bless you, I didn't mean
you were to give up what was for your happiness on
account of me."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd let people look down upon and
slight my mother?" asked Lily. "Besides," she added
quickly, "he's dull; he is not the least entertaining;
he is no fun, mother. There are some that are far
better fun, and just as good gentlemen, and never
would behave like that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford was deeply disappointed, in spite of her
evil prognostications. "Well, Lily," she said, "I'm
glad you're so reasonable. I can't help feeling for
Mr. Roger, poor dear, but if it's to be Witherspoon,
after all"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 87 -->

<p>"Witherspoon!" ejaculated Lily, with an accent of
scorn: but who it was, or where she had seen any gentleman
who was not Roger, not all her mother's importunities
could make her say.</p>

<p class="small">PRIMOGENITURE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE atmosphere of a house in which there is a family
quarrel is always affected, however limited may be
the extent of the quarrel. In the present case there
were but two of the family involved: but they were
the principal persons in the house. Not a word was
said about it at the breakfast table, from which, indeed,
the Squire had disappeared before Roger was
visible, to the relief of everybody concerned, nor at
lunch, where they met with more civility than usual,
saying "Good-morning" to each other with averted
eyes. But at both these meals the situation was very
obvious, the air stifling the other members of the party,
embarrassing them to a degree which was absurd.
Why could not they talk in their usual tone, or keep
at least an appearance of ease? Why was it that a
subject could not be kept up, but was dropped instantaneously
as soon as, with two feeble remarks, it had
been brought into spasmodic being? How was it that
all the ordinary events which furnish table-talk seemed
for this moment to have ceased to be? Edmund did
his best, laboring against the passive resistance of the
two silent figures who sat at the head and foot of the
table, and made no contribution to the conversation.
Every subject, however, that he could think of appeared
to have some connection with forbidden matters.
As Nina's support was of a very ineffectual

<!-- page 89 -->

kind, and she was too much in awe of her father to
hazard many observations of her own, the result was
very unsuccessful. It was so feeble, indeed, that the
servants gave each other looks of intelligence, and
Larkins stationed himself in a pose of defense behind
his master's chair. If there was to be any split in the
house, which was a thing the servants' hall had foreboded
for some time past, Mr. Larkins felt very sure
on which side policy and safety lay.</p>

<p>The air was thus affected throughout the house. It
diffused a kind of general irritation for which nobody
could account. Even little Nina spoke very sharply
to her maid, and Edmund kicked away the unoffending
dog who got between his feet as he left the dining-room.
They were angry, they did not know why.
And Mrs. Simmons had all the maids in the kitchen
in tears before she had done with them that day.
The belligerents themselves were the only persons unaffected
by this general tendency. They were cool to
an exasperating degree, polite, making remarks full
of solemnity and high composure. These remarks
were addressed to Edmund, who figured as the general
public. "What do you think of the weather, Edmund?
It was sharp frost last night, Larkins tells
me, but I hope you'll be able to get a good run to-morrow."
"Did you notice if the wind was veering
to the west, Ned? I rather think we are going to
have a deluge." These were the sorts of observations
they made. Had the mind of Edmund been free to
remark what was going on, he would no doubt have
been struck by the comic aspect of the situation; but
unfortunately in such circumstances, though there is
always a great deal that is very funny, the persons
about are too deeply concerned to get the good of the
ludicrous side.</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>Edmund was much startled to find himself called
into the library after that uncomfortable meal. His
father made a sign to him to close the door, and
pointed to a chair near his writing-table. "I don't
often make such demands on your time," he said.
"I suppose you can give me ten minutes, Ned?"</p>

<p>"As long as you like, sir," he said promptly, but
with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, as long as I like! It's not exactly for pleasure.
Edmund, perhaps I was a little peremptory
with your brother last night."</p>

<p>"I think so," said Edmund, "if you will let me say
so. You've always been so good to us. That makes
us feel it the more when you are a little"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ill-tempered, unjust. I know that's what you
meant to say."</p>

<p>"I meant only what you yourself said, father,&mdash;peremptory.
Roger is not in a happy state of mind,
to begin with."</p>

<p>"He has no great reason to be in a happy state of
mind. I know he's after some villainy. I've heard
it from several people."</p>

<p>"No villainy," said Edmund quickly. "Whoever
says so doesn't know Roger."</p>

<p>"That's the most lenient interpretation," his father
remarked; "otherwise folly, madness, something too
wild to name." The Squire paused, and looked his
second son almost imploringly in the face. "Can't
you do anything, Ned? You two are very good
friends, and you've a great deal of sense. There are
times when I've thought you rather a milksop, not
much like the rest of us, but I never denied you had
a great deal of sense."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I'm afraid I am rather&mdash;a

<!-- page 91 -->

milksop, as you say. My kind of sense doesn't seem
to make much impression."</p>

<p>"It would, upon your brother, if you would speak
plainly to him. A young fellow can do that better
than an old one. They think we're preaching, they
think we don't understand. That's a good joke,"
said Mr. Mitford, with a short laugh, turning his
eyes as it were inwardly upon his own experience.
"But the fact is you all of you think so. Persuade
him that he's a fool, and get him to understand,"
continued the father, looking into Edmund's eyes with
a steady stare, "that what I said was no vain threat.
I mean it, every word."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;it, sir?" said Edmund, with a look
of surprised inquiry. So little impression had the
threats of last night made upon him that he did not
even remember what they were.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford's face flushed into an angry redness.
"I mean it, and I hope you don't intend to be insolent,
too. I mean, sir, that there's no eldest son in
our family. I can make whomsoever I please the
eldest son: and by Jove, if Roger makes an infernal
fool of himself, as he seems to intend to do"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose it's quite legitimate as an argument,"
Edmund said reflectively.</p>

<p>"Legitimate! What do you mean by legitimate?
It is no argument; it's a plain statement of what I
mean to do."</p>

<p>"If there was any hope that it would be effectual,"
Edmund went on, "but my opinion is it would have
exactly the contrary effect; and to threaten what one
doesn't mean to carry out"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you want to drive me out of my senses?"
cried the Squire. "I never threaten what I don't

<!-- page 92 -->

mean to perform. Take care you don't spoil your
own prospects, too. As certainly as I sit here, if
Roger takes his own way in this, I shall take mine&mdash;and
wipe him out of the succession as I wipe off this
fly&mdash;without hesitation or&mdash;compunction," he continued,
drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>"No," said Edmund, with a deprecatory smile.
His heart quaked, but he would not even appear to
believe. "No, no,&mdash;you are angry, you take perhaps
too grave a view; but wipe him out&mdash;Roger?
No, father, no, no."</p>

<p>"None of your no, no's to me, sir," cried the
Squire. He had a way of imitating his antagonist's
tone mockingly when he was angry, but he had not
the talent of a mimic. "I say what I mean, and not
a word more than I mean. If you cannot do any
more for your brother, make him understand that I
am in earnest, and you may do some good."</p>

<p>"I should only do a great deal of harm. I should
put him beside himself."</p>

<p>"Then there will be two of us," said the Squire,
with a grim smile. "If that's all you're good for,
I'm sorry I asked you, and you may as well go. But
take care, my boy," he added, rising as Edmund rose.
"Take care that you don't spoil your own prospects,
too."</p>

<p>Edmund left his father's room with something of
the feeling of a man who has been listening to some
statement of important possibilities delivered in an
imperfectly understood language. He made a great
many efforts to elucidate these unfamiliar words, and
make out what they meant. They were as strange to
him as if they had been in Hungarian or Russian.
"Wipe Roger out of the succession;" "No eldest

<!-- page 93 -->

sons in our family;" "Take care you don't spoil your
own prospects, too,"&mdash;the most recondite of Slav
dialects could not have been more difficult to understand.
The constitution of the family was a matter
entirely beyond argument to this young Englishman.
In the abstract, he was ready enough to argue out any
question. The law, as interpreted in different countries
under different theories, bore no especial sacredness
for him, that it might not be fully criticised,
questioned, or condemned. He was quite willing to
discuss the hereditary principle in general, both its
drawbacks and its advantages. But to think of Roger
disinherited, of himself, perhaps, preferred, gave him
an intolerable sensation which it was impossible to
endure. Roger wiped out of the succession!&mdash;his
brother, whom nothing could keep from being the
head of the house, no change in respect to the estates,
no arbitrary settlement&mdash;his elder brother, <i>Roger!</i>
There was an incredibility about it which brought an
angry laugh to Edmund's lips, yet struck him like a
sharp blow, like a sudden warning stroke, awakening
him to dangers unthought of, to the unreality of everything
about him. It was as if, walking along a solid,
well-known road, he had suddenly come to an unexpected
yawning precipice, as if he had all at once seen
some volcanic crater open at his feet. Nothing less
than such metaphors could explain the sudden shock,
the tremendous danger. Roger wiped out of the succession,
his own prospects&mdash;his <i>prospects</i>, good
heavens!&mdash;of disinheriting his brother, of being preferred
in Roger's place! This made the blood rush
to his brain, singing and ringing in his ears. He
to disinherit Roger! Put in that way the warmest
champion of equal inheritances would probably pause.

<!-- page 94 -->

Abstract justice is one thing; it may be that children
have a right to an equal division of their father's possessions;
it may be that they have no right at all to
another man's property, even though he may be their
father; but for one to displace the other, to take advantage
of the father's weakness and grasp his inheritance,&mdash;this,
to a generous spirit, looks like the worst
kind of robbery. Edmund felt himself degraded, injured,
by the very thought. He recalled his father's
words. They could not mean this or that; there must
be a different signification to them. If there were
only a dictionary of human perversities by which he
could find it out! He took a long walk upon it, which
is so good a way of clearing the head: but light did
not come to him. His father was an honorable man.
He was a good father; he had never done anything
unkind or cruel. What did he mean now by this
insane suggestion, by speaking in a new language
which the unassisted intelligence could not understand?</p>

<p>The sun had set by the time Edmund returned
home. The little paraphernalia of the tea-table,
which it had pleased Nina to set up in the hall, was
there in its corner, deserted, and nobody was visible
but Roger, who stood with his back to the entrance
as Edmund came in, apparently examining the whips
upon the rack, displacing and rearranging them. He
turned half round when his brother entered, but for a
minute or two took no notice, carrying on his half-occupation,
one of the expedients of idleness to get
through a little time. Edmund, for his part, took no
notice, either, for his heart was still sick with bewilderment,
and he was reluctant to say anything,
afraid to begin a conversation, though he had so

<!-- page 95 -->

much to say. He went up to the wood fire, which
blazed in the great open chimney, and stood leaning
upon the carved stone mantelpiece, which bore the
Mitford arms, and was one of the curiosities of the
place. The hall was the only part of the house which
had any pretensions to antiquity. It was full of
dark corners, with two deep-recessed windows throwing
broad lines of light from one side to the other.
One of these was partially filled with painted glass,
coats-of-arms blazoned in the brilliancy of that radiance;
the other was white and pale, full of a silvery
spring-evening sky.</p>

<p>"How is the wind?" said Roger, at last. "I hope
that old croaker is not going to be justified in his forebodings.
The sky looks uncomfortably clear."</p>

<p>"There is frost in the air," said Edmund. Then
he turned round, with his back to the fire, in the favorite
attitude of an Englishman. "But I thought,"
he said, "it couldn't matter much to you. Are you
not going away?"</p>

<p>"Going away! Not that I know of," Roger replied,
curtly.</p>

<p>"I thought you said&mdash;it's just the time for town;
a number of people, but none of the whirl of the
season. Why don't you go? The hunting is not
worth staying for at the fag end of the year."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go yourself, if you like it so
much?" Roger asked.</p>

<p>"I will, if you'll come with me, like a shot. To-night,
if you please, by the last train."</p>

<p>"Why should I go with you? I am not a man for
town," said Roger, with a gloomy face, as he approached
the fire. "And just at this time of the
year, when the country gets sweeter day by day!

<!-- page 96 -->

Hang the hunting! Is that all I care for, do you
suppose?"</p>

<p>"A man should not shut himself up from the company
of his kind," remarked Edmund, sententiously.</p>

<p>"His kind! And who are they, I wonder? Fellows
at the club, who don't care a brass farthing if
they ever see you again&mdash;or&mdash;or"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the question," said the younger brother.
"Our friends like us well enough here, but they would
not break their hearts if we absented ourselves for
three months, or even for six. Come, Roger, let's
go."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly welcome to go, whenever you
please. You don't want your elder brother to take
care of you, I hope?"</p>

<p>"My elder"&mdash;Edmund murmured under his breath.
The word gave him new energy. "Roger, I wish
you'd listen to me," he said. "Look here: here is a
sort of a quarrel got up in the house. It's nothing,&mdash;a
fit of temper, a fit of obstinacy; for you are a bit
obstinate, you know. It's nothing, but it puts everybody
out of sorts; even Nina, poor little thing, who
has nothing to do with it. The best way by far to
cut it short would be to run off for a little. Don't
you see, that clears you from all embarrassment. After
all, perhaps you ought to have gone in and said a word
to Elizabeth, now that she is just beginning to show
again. No harm done, old fellow, but she might have
taken it kind."</p>

<p>"What's Elizabeth to me," cried Roger, "or I to
her? She is just as indifferent&mdash;&mdash; If you had gone,
it might have been more to the purpose; or Steve,"
he said, with a harsh laugh,&mdash;"the all-conquering
Steve. Ned, if we are not to quarrel, leave that alone,
for on that subject I will not hear a word."</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<p>"On what subject, then, will you hear?" said Edmund,
"for one way or another there is a good deal to
say."</p>

<p>Roger began to pace up and down the hall, from
one end to another. He had his hands thrust into his
pockets, his shoulders up to his ears. The least sympathetic
spectator might have observed the conflict
which was going on within him. At last he burst
forth, "Don't say anything at all, Ned. For goodness'
sake, hold your tongue, and let me think for
myself." He had another long march up and down,
then resumed: "If I could think for myself! I can't
think at all, I believe. I just bob up and down as the
current catches me. I think I shall go to town, after
all. You're right, Ned; you are a cool, clear-headed
fellow, with plenty of sense. I dare say I couldn't do
better than take your advice."</p>

<p>Edmund could not but smile within himself at this
double ascription of sense to him as his special quality.
He did not feel as though sense had much to do
with it. "Do," he urged. "I don't think you'll ever
regret it, Roger. I'll tell Wright to put your things
together, for a month, say. Shall I say for a month?"</p>

<p>"I wonder, now," said Roger, fixing his gaze upon
his brother, "why you should be so anxious about it.
It might be pleasant or it might be convenient, but
why the deuce <i>you</i> should make such a point of it I
don't see."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't make any point," replied Edmund. "It
seems to me that it would be a nice thing to do. I
should be glad of your company. We might do a few
things together. We have not been out together like
this since we were boys, Roger."</p>

<p>"On the spree," said the elder brother, with a laugh;

<!-- page 98 -->

"that's the word. I wonder how Mr. Gravity will
look when he's on the&mdash;what do you call it?" He
paused a moment, and then he said, "That's not your
reason, Ned."</p>

<p>"Not altogether, Roger. A family quarrel is a
hideous thing; it upsets me more than I can tell you.
My father and you are too like each other; you will
not give in, one or the other; and a little absence
would set it all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, a little absence would set it all right! But
still, that's not what you mean, Ned," Roger said.
He walked across the hall, across the gleams of prismatic
heraldic tints from the nearest window, to where
the other revealed far away the distant horizon, a whole
pale hemisphere of sky. There he stood, his dark
figure outlined against that almost shrill clearness,
while Edmund stood anxious behind. What the conflict
was which was going on within, Edmund painfully
guessed, but could not know, as he watched him, in
that wonderful isolation of humanity that prevents the
closest sympathizer, the most zealous helper, from
understanding all. Dared he interfere more distinctly?
Must he keep silence? Was he losing a
precious opportunity? Edmund could not tell. He
stood helpless, clearing his throat to speak, but in the
terrible doubt saying not a word.</p>

<p>"A little absence would set it all right," Roger repeated,
muttering between his teeth. "Would it so?
Is one's will of no more consequence than that? A little
absence&mdash;a little&mdash;&mdash; Ned," he said, turning round,
"you needn't speak to Wright. Perhaps I'll go, perhaps
I sha'n't; no man can tell at six o'clock what
he'll do at ten. We'll see how the chance goes," he
added, with a laugh, "if there's time after dinner&mdash;or

<!-- page 99 -->

if there's not"&mdash;&mdash; He paused as he passed, and
laid his hand on his brother's shoulder. "This I will
say, whatever happens,&mdash;you mean well, Ned."</p>

<p>"That's poor praise," said Edmund, "my sense
and my good intentions. If you'd do it, Roger, for
my sake&mdash;we've always been good friends, old fellow.
Never mind the good meaning; do it for love."</p>

<p>"For love!" the other said. He went away, with
a hasty wave of his hand. Was it possible that his
brother, "that dearest heart and next his own," in the
very melting of his fraternal anxiety, had touched the
wrong chord at the last?</p>

<p>IX.</p>

<p class="small">MOUNT TRAVERS.</p>

</div>

<p>MOUNT TRAVERS, which was the name of the place
which Elizabeth's uncle had built when he became a
rich man, was of a very different description from the
older houses of the district. It stood out barely on
the top of a hill, surmounting everything within range
of half a dozen miles, with a few half-grown plantations
round it. It was constructed in the style of
what was supposed to be in those dark days an English
manor-house; that is, in red brick, to which dignity,
it had been fondly hoped, was given by the introduction
of large bays and great windows in hewn
stone. No redder or whiter house ever existed outside
of a nursery book. At the foot of the height on
which it stood the natural foliage of the leafy country
rose in waves of varying green, but near the house
itself, to give it shelter or shade, were nothing but
shrubs and neatly planted trees, which were not tall
enough to hide a single corner of the brilliant walls.
Mr. Travers had thought all this very fine, and a
proof of the superiority of the nineteenth century; for
there was no other plate-glass in all the parish, and
the conveniences in every way were innumerable. His
horses and even his cows were better lodged by far
than the servants at Melcombe, who were all huddled
together in old attics at the top of the house, whereas
Mr. Travers' butler had a large and airy room, lighted

<!-- page 101 -->

with plate-glass, like his masters. It had been the
great pleasure of the last year of old Travers' life to
make a striking thing of that new and resplendent
dwelling. You stepped into the hall upon tiles of
the most elaborate and costly description, and found
yourself surrounded with inlaid panels and carvings
in oak, which did not pretend to look old, as most
things of the kind do, but boldly showed in every leaf
and twig an art manufacture fresh from the workshop.
The staircases were all ornamented in the same way;
the rooms were gorgeous from the hands of the upholsterer;
everything was the newest, brightest, and
most highly improved of its kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers sat in the great window of the drawing-room,
a huge, broad, and lofty bay, where the
plate-glass extended from the roof to the floor, and
all was as light and naked as the noonday, indeed
much more so; for Nature at her most unadorned
never takes that air of nakedness which a great, open,
unabashed window, making everything more distinct
with its vast film of clear glass, throws upon the landscape.
Mrs. Travers in her black gown, a speck in
that broad stream of light, appeared like a small
black image in the intense but doleful whiteness of
the prospect beyond. It was a rainy day, the clouds
all careering about the skies, throwing occasionally a
spiteful dash of rain straight at the window, and the
country looking dull yet shrewish, like one who would
fain scold, but dared not under the circumstances.
The successive waves of the trees, here old, there more
recent, the faint tinge of green upon some, the half-opened
leaves of others; the undulating country, here
a common, there a park, here a piece of rich upland,
there a ridge of trees, with villages here and there,

<!-- page 102 -->

and the roof or turrets of a rural mansion appearing
out of a thick cluster of wood,&mdash;everything was visible
from that big window. It was like an inquisitive
watcher spying all that occurred: and in the midst of
its staring whiteness sat Mrs. Travers, all black save
for the widow's cap and cuffs and collar, which were
everything that is suggested by the dictates of unmitigated
woe.</p>

<p>She was a little, spare woman, with a small, worn
face, very gentle to outward semblance, yet with certain
lines in it that denoted a querulous soul. She
had her work in her hand, a large piece of white knitting,
upon which she generally kept her eyes fixed,
talking softly on with her face thus rendered opaque,
save when she would suddenly and quietly drop her
hands in her lap and lift the said eyes, which were of
a somewhat muddy blue. This happened at periodical
intervals, and was apt to rouse in the interlocutor,
if at all sensitive, a certain nervous expectation which
was not comfortable. Elizabeth had been used to her
aunt's "ways" all her life, and she did not so much
mind.</p>

<p>"I hear you were at Melcombe yesterday, Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt. I went to see Pax."</p>

<p>"You have grown very fond of Pax, as you call
her. It was not much of an object for such a long
ride."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the ride itself was the chief object," said
Elizabeth, with a smile. "I have always been fond
of Pax, but I did want a ride, a good long ride, after
being shut up so long."</p>

<p>"You call it long? Your poor uncle would have
been surprised if he had known that, after making

<!-- page 103 -->

you his heiress and everything, you should think six
months' mourning too long."</p>

<p>"Dear aunt!" said Elizabeth, with a little sigh of
impatience; then she added, "My uncle would understand;
he would know that one might long for a
little fresh air, and yet mourn him as truly&mdash;as truly
as"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused. She was a very honest young woman,
above all treachery. She began to feel with self-reproach
that there was little mourning in her thoughts.
Some natural tears she had dropped; nay, she had
dropped many. But it cannot be denied that she had
begun to wipe them soon. It is the course of nature;
because an old man dies, it is impossible that a young
woman should shut herself forever out of the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers put down her knitting, and looked at
her niece with those little pale blue eyes. Elizabeth
thought they looked through her, but this was not the
case. Mrs. Travers had not yielded to any violence
of grief, and Elizabeth's mourning was quite respectfully
"deep," which was almost all that she felt to be
required.</p>

<p>"Many people would have thought it necessary, for
an uncle who had done so much for them, not to be
seen at all for the first year," remarked Mrs. Travers.</p>

<p>"If that were all&mdash;I am not in the least anxious
to be seen."</p>

<p>"Then, what were you doing at Melcombe? You
know as well as I do that now you are known to be
your uncle's heiress all the young men from far and
near will be after you, like flies round a pot of
honey."</p>

<p>"Indeed, aunt"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me you don't know. That is one

<!-- page 104 -->

of the reasons that ought to have made your poor dear
uncle leave things more in my hands; for if it had
been understood that you were to have the money
only at my pleasure, it would have been a refuge for
you from fortune-hunters. What he has done, though
he meant it well, is really a very bad thing for you,"
Mrs. Travers said, ending off a row abruptly, with a
little tug to bring it straight. "<i>I</i> know what fortune-hunters
are."</p>

<p>To this Elizabeth made no reply, and after a while
her aunt continued. "You saw some of the Mitfords,
of course; and of course the old man, whom I never
liked, has marked you down for one of his sons. Oh,
don't tell me; I know it well enough. The eldest,
perhaps, because Mount Travers would be such a nice
addition to the property; or the second, because he
has not very much of his own, and it would be nice to
have him so near home; or the youngest. Now, if it
had to be one of them," said Mrs. Travers, suddenly
lifting her dull but very observant eyes, "the youngest
would be my choice."</p>

<p>"I wish you would understand," replied Elizabeth,
with some vexation, "that there is no question of anything
of the kind. I saw the Mitfords pass, all three
together, on their way to the station. That was the
nearest communication I had with them. I saw young
Raymond Tredgold and his father, if you feel interested
about them."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, fortune-hunting too. Of course I am interested
about them all: but I will tell you this, Lizzy,
if you make any ridiculous marriage like that, taking
up with a boy ever so many years younger than yourself&mdash;I
can't take anything from you in the end, but
you sha'n't bring a baby-husband to live in my house."</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p>Elizabeth had gone to the window, and stood close
to that great expanse of light, leaning her head
against one of the divisions. Had she been, as Mrs.
Travers supposed, dependent, no doubt all this would
have wounded her deeply. But as there was not the
slightest vestige of right in the matter, and the poor
lady was as powerless, though she did not know it, as
the chair on which she was seated, the poor little ineffectual
injury was easier to bear. Elizabeth stood
looking out, a little vexed but more sorry, with nothing
but compassion slightly tinctured with shame in
her face. She was a little mortified that her aunt, her
nearest relative, who had known her for so long,
should speak to her so.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will be tried," she remarked,
with a faint sigh of impatience. And then she added,
"Mr. Gavelkind is coming to luncheon to-day. I
hope you won't mind. I heard from him this morning
that there was something he wanted to speak to&mdash;about."</p>

<p>She stopped short at the pronoun, in spite of herself.
She could not say "to you," and would not say
"to me." Her path was very thorny. The lawyer
had to be received somehow, and must have the way
prepared for him. Poor Elizabeth, in her impulse of
generosity, had found a thousand reasons to answer
all arguments, when she was told that her uncle's
widow ought to be informed exactly what was the
state of affairs. But she had not foreseen such a very
ordinary little practical dilemma as this.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gavelkind!" cried Mrs. Travers. "I must
say I think it is very strange that he should write to
you about coming, and not to me, Elizabeth. I don't
like to say so, but I can't hide it from myself. You

<!-- page 106 -->

take a great deal too much upon you, my dear.
Though my husband did leave you his heiress, I don't
suppose he ever intended to make you mistress of my
house."</p>

<p>"Dear aunt!" cried Elizabeth in despair. "You
know you never did take any interest in business.
He wrote to me, thinking&mdash;that he ought not to
trouble you about such matters; thinking it would
worry you, and that you would not like it, and that
I&mdash;&mdash; In short," added Elizabeth, with a sudden inspiration,
"it is something about my own little bit of
money, after all, and nothing of yours."</p>

<p>"Why did not you say so at once?" asked her
aunt. "I shall not wish ever to interfere with your
own money. I have always regretted that I was not
allowed to manage mine from the beginning. I am
sure there would have been more of it now; and as
that is all I have to dispose of, to give any little keepsakes
to my own relations&mdash;&mdash; Well, we needn't talk
of that any more. If you want any advice I shall be
pleased to give you my opinion, Lizzy, but you young
people think you know everything better than we do."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, aunt: but I shall not exercise any
judgment of my own; I shall do just what Mr. Gavelkind
advises. What do I know about stocks and investments?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know about them, if you don't.
You ought to look at the city article every morning,
and improve your mind. My father was a stock-broker,
and that is what <i>he</i> said. 'Read the city
article, and then you'll know as much as any of us
do,' that is what he said. Of course it does not
matter just now with your own thousand or two. But
when you have all the Travers money to manage"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>"I hope," said Elizabeth, faltering, turning her
head still more away, oppressed by the weight of the
untruth which she had meant to be only a tacit one,
"that it may be very long before"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Travers, in a subdued
and softened tone, "I believe you do. I am sure that
you don't want to get rid of me for the sake of the
money. I may be a little nasty about the will sometimes.
It isn't that I ever would have alienated his
money,&mdash;you should have had it all the same, Lizzy,
every penny,&mdash;only it would have seemed more trustful-like.
But any way, my dear, I am certain you
never would grudge me a day's enjoyment of it,&mdash;of
that I am quite sure."</p>

<p>Elizabeth stole like a culprit behind her aunt's chair
and gave her a kiss, at the risk of receiving a stab in
return from the knitting-pins. She felt guilty but
glad this time, her own heart melting too. "We don't
need to say these things between you and me, do we?"
she whispered, feeling very tenderly towards the guardian
of her youth.</p>

<p>"But, my dear," remarked Mrs. Travers, going on
with her knitting after a little emphatic nod of assent,
"by that time you will have a husband, who will rule
the money and you too."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that. At all events, there is
no appearance of him as yet upon the horizon," replied
Elizabeth returning to her seat, this little episode
being over. The worst of it was that such little
episodes occurred almost every day.</p>

<p>"And you nearly five and twenty!" said Mrs.
Travers. "To a woman who was married at nineteen,
as I was, that seems quite old for a girl."</p>

<p>"I don't consider myself a girl," returned Elizabeth,

<!-- page 108 -->

with a smile. "I am like Pax. I have outgrown
those vanities."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear. Pax is five and forty if she
is a day, and a clergyman's daughter without a penny.
Oh, yes, I know all the Melcombe young men were
in love with her&mdash;once&mdash;except the youngest. The
youngest is the one I should choose. He is a fine-looking
young man; he is not one of the calculating
sort. Roger is as proud as Lucifer, and would snuff
and sniff at good honest money, and think a great
deal more of his mouldy old lands: and Edmund is
a sentimental dawdle; but the third one, Lizzy, he
would be the man for me. He has always something
to say to a woman. He'd run off with you, whether
you would or not; he'd give you no peace; he wouldn't
take no for an answer. That is the sort of young
fellow I like to see."</p>

<p>"Why, you are like Lydia Languish, aunt! I did
not know you were so romantic."</p>

<p>"I never was for myself," said the little woman,
who had sparkled up out of her widow's weeds for a
moment with a flash of spirit and fire which tempted
the listener to laugh, "married at nineteen to a stock-broker
in the city! I never had any time to be
romantic. But I confess I have always been so for
you, Lizzy. You are a handsome woman, and you
were a very pretty girl. I used always to expect some
one to come riding up out of the distance for you.
When we first came here I always thought some carriage
would break down at the gates, or a gentleman
be thrown off his horse, or something. But it never
happened. I was dreadfully disappointed when you
got to twenty-one, and nobody had ever come for you.
Some girls have these things happen by the dozen. I

<!-- page 109 -->

never could understand why they didn't happen to
you."</p>

<p>"Poor auntie, how I must have disappointed you!"
cried Elizabeth, laughing. "I feel quite sorry that
Prince Charming has never appeared, for your sake."</p>

<p>"But you have him under your hand now, or I am
much mistaken. Next time he comes home on leave,
you will just see if he isn't over here on some pretext
or other before he has been two days at home,
Lizzy"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because he has heard that&mdash;I am my uncle's
heiress, aunt?"</p>

<p>"Well," observed Mrs. Travers, "you can never
leave money out of account in affairs of this sort. A
man like that wouldn't dare to propose to you unless
you had money, for he has none: and how could the
pair of you live? I don't call that fortune-hunting.
He has a very good position, he belongs to an old
family, he's a soldier, which always counts for something,
and I am quite sure that he admires you very
much. The money's not his object; it only makes
his object possible."</p>

<p>"What a clever woman you are, auntie! You are
a casuist as well as a romancer. I never should have
seen it in that light."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you, now?" said Mrs. Travers, with
gratification. "Oh, I am not such a fool as I look.
My father always said so. And, my dear, in such a
case as that, I need scarcely say&mdash;a man whom I
liked, and who would cheer us all up, and throw a
little <i>&eacute;clat</i> upon the place&mdash;there would be no need of
thinking of another establishment, Elizabeth. You
would be welcome, and more than welcome, like my
son and daughter in my house."</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>The tears trembled in Elizabeth's eyes, a hot color
came over her face. She felt guilty and ashamed, and
yet she could hardly restrain the laugh in which alone
sometimes a perplexed soul can express itself. "You
are always the kindest of the kind, dear aunt," she
said.</p>

<p>"You should have your own set of rooms," the old
lady went on, quite pleased with her plan,&mdash;"sitting-rooms
and everything. You should choose them yourselves,
and have them furnished to your own taste. I
should do everything I could to make you feel&mdash;I
mean to make <i>him</i> feel quite at his ease: and of course
you would succeed to everything at my death. Now,
Lizzy, if this does happen, as I hope it will, and I am
almost sure it will&mdash;don't you take any notion into
your head that he should have spoken before; for
how could he speak before having no money of his own,
and not knowing whether there might be anything
more than that thousand or two of your mother's, on
your side?"</p>

<p>"My dear aunt, Stephen Mitford has never spoken
a dozen words to me in my life," cried Elizabeth, a
little vexed. "He has not the remotest idea of anything
of the kind, nor of me, at all, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mrs. Travers, "we shall see, we
shall see; and certainly he is the one that would be
my choice."</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<div class="center" id="X">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>X.</p>

<p class="small">THE LAWYER.</p>

</div>

<p>ELIZABETH received the lawyer, when he arrived, in
the room which had been her uncle's business-room,
a plain, dark-complexioned little place, with a large
writing-table and a few comfortable chairs, but no
paraphernalia in the way of books to distract the attention.
The charms of business by itself were sufficiently
great to make other pleasantnesses unnecessary,
Mr. Travers had thought; and accordingly, though the
window was quite large and of plate-glass, it looked
out upon no panorama of varied landscape, but upon
a close little corner of shrubbery which rose to a
climax in a large larch, very feathery and fine in its
way, but which certainly did not add to the light or
even cheerfulness of the small, square, brown, uncompromising
room. The spring sunshine did not get
near this place, nor even the blue of the sky. It was
all larch and laurel, and a very modified dull light.
And it cannot be said that Elizabeth's companion was
an entertaining one. He was a spare man, with a lock
of hair growing upon his forehead as if it had somehow
strayed there, leaving the crown of his head ungarnished,
of a sallow gray color, not unlike parchment,
and features that seemed too small for his face;
his nose appeared to have remained the size it was in
childhood, and the mouth to have grown into a little
round aperture by some spell or freak of nature, but

<!-- page 112 -->

the extraordinarily bright little twinkling eyes which
completed the countenance seemed to promise that
Mr. Gavelkind's intellect had not been arrested in its
growth. They dwelt upon Elizabeth with a very kind,
paternal look as he shoveled away into a bag the
papers he had been placing before her. She had not
much more knowledge than she had professed to have,
and did in reality prove her confidence very completely
in the adviser who had managed all her uncle's affairs;
but Elizabeth's ignorance was very intelligent, and he
had been explaining a great many things to her, which
gave her a certain interest in the large transactions
which were now carried on in her name.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, shutting his bag with a snap,
"tell me, Miss Elizabeth, what face am I to put on
before the poor lady, whom you are deceiving for her
good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say deceiving, Mr. Gavelkind."</p>

<p>"What shall I call it, then? Give me your name
for the business, and I shall use it. I know no other,
according to my own lights."</p>

<p>"Then you must not use your own lights. Fancy
allowing her to believe that she is not mistress in her
own house! I would rather lose it altogether, and be
dependent upon her bounty, as she thinks would have
been more just."</p>

<p>"You would not have liked that."</p>

<p>"No, perhaps I shouldn't, but that is not the question.
I have told her&mdash;I hope it is not too dreadful
a fib, but what can I do?&mdash;that it is my own little bit
of money you have come to me about."</p>

<p>"Well, it is your own money, so far as that is concerned:
but you will have to tell a greater fib before
you are done, which is what I warned you of; and if

<!-- page 113 -->

she should once get a clue, and begin to suspect, you
will be very easily found out."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't say so, Mr. Gavelkind. I admit
it isn't so easy as I thought. Little things occur
which I had not foreseen, and I am quite frightened
when I see how clever I get in explaining. Do you
think it will give me the habit of telling fibs?"</p>

<p>"Very likely indeed. But I hope you can trust
your memory, for that is the worst of it: when we
step beyond the truth we are so apt to forget what the
last little l&mdash; fib, I mean, was."</p>

<p>"You are dreadfully severe," said Elizabeth, half
laughing, not without a little inclination to cry. "That
<i>is</i> exactly what I feel; and sometimes I contradict
myself, and can't remember what I said last."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we
practice to deceive," quoted the lawyer. "The thing
I fear is that you will not be able to keep it up."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I shall be able to keep it up," she cried
hurriedly, and led the way out of the room. At times
this deception, at which everybody who knew of it
shook their heads, got too much for poor Elizabeth.
She took Mr. Gavelkind to the cold lightness of the
drawing-room, and ran up to her own room, to bathe
her forehead and refresh herself. The situation occasionally
got upon her nerves, as people say. She felt
disposed to laugh and cry, with a sobbing mixture of
sounds, and could not stop herself for a minute; but
Elizabeth was not at all a hysterical subject, and good
sense and cold water soon got the better of this.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Gavelkind," said Mrs. Travers, "I hear
you have come to see my niece about her investments.
Have you got some new chance for that little money
of hers? I expect to hear it has quite doubled its
value, since you take so much interest in it."</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>"I take an interest in the money of all my clients,"
said the lawyer, "and I am glad to see that Miss
Travers begins to understand business, which is what
a great many ladies can never be taught to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," assented the old lady. "I was of
that kind myself, so long as I had my husband to
think for me. But now if you were to give me the
benefit of your instructions, as you do Elizabeth,&mdash;you
know I am a stock-broker's daughter, I ought to
have a little aptitude,&mdash;I think I might begin to understand
too."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion, my dear lady, no occasion,"
said the lawyer hastily; "everything is as comfortable
as possible. If there is any need, then it will be time
enough. Your niece is getting back her color, Mrs.
Travers, I am glad to see. For some time after your
great loss, whether it was altogether distress or had
something to do with the deep mourning, I quite feared
that Miss Elizabeth"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is always very well, thank you," interrupted
the widow rather sharply. "Elizabeth's health need
give nobody any trouble. What should be the matter
with her, at her age? At mine these great shocks are
a very different matter." It was indeed a little hard
upon Mrs. Travers to have her attention called to the
depth of her niece's sorrow, when no notice was taken
of any paleness or changed looks of her own.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came in at this moment with something
of a flush upon her face, owing to the large application
of fresh cold water with which she had been driving
away the momentary hysterical sensation produced by
all the contrarieties of feeling in which she was involved.</p>

<p>"She is red enough just now, certainly," her aunt

<!-- page 115 -->

remarked, choosing, as elderly relatives not unfrequently
do, the least complimentary expressions possible.
"Is luncheon ready, Elizabeth? Mr. Gavelkind
has begun to think already about catching his
train."</p>

<p>This anxiety, though, perhaps, it really existed in
the lawyer's mind, had not been expressed, but he
only smiled, and owned that he was anxious to get
back to town as soon as possible; and Mrs. Travers,
taking his arm, led him into the dining-room, which
was on the opposite side of the hall, and commanded
the same extended prospect through the clear sheets
of plate-glass.</p>

<p>"What a view, to be sure!" Mr. Gavelkind exclaimed.
"I suppose you are higher up than anybody
in the county. Why, some of the trees are quite
green already; and I like that sort of purply down
over them that shows spring's coming. Why, you
have the air quite fresh from the sea."</p>

<p>"Nine hundred feet above the sea level," observed
Mrs. Travers, with a touch of pride; "and nothing so
high between us and the Channel. You can smell the
air quite salt sometimes, and even see it, they say, on
fine days; but I can't say that I put very much faith
in that."</p>

<p>"And there's Whitelocks common just underneath.
Such a sweep of land as that is quite good enough
without any sea. And that's Whitelocks itself among
the trees. I used to know it very well in the late
lord's time. I know all the country about pretty well.
What's that brown house to the west, with the little
square tower? Oh, it's Melcombe, I remember. Are
the Mitfords still there? I suppose you know everybody
as far as you can see."</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p>"We know the Mitfords, at all events," replied
Mrs. Travers, significantly, with a glance at Elizabeth.
"There are three young men in the house; and that
is a fact which can't be without interest where there
is a girl and an heiress."</p>

<p>"It amuses you, at any rate, to think so, auntie."</p>

<p>"Amuses me! Oh, no; on the contrary, it makes
me very anxious. Three young men, all marriageable,
planted at my very door! And I think a young
woman in Elizabeth's position, or, rather, in what her
position will be, ought to have a husband. It is all
very well for her to understand her investments under
your instructions, Mr. Gavelkind; but a woman never
is very bright on such matters, you may say what
you like, and her husband would understand them
much better."</p>

<p>"That is sometimes the case, I must allow," said
Mr. Gavelkind, "but Miss Elizabeth"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you don't want to turn Elizabeth's head
with your compliments. She is just a girl like other
girls. She will take up that sort of thing if she has
nothing else in her head, and she will make you think
she understands it. You will imagine that she takes
quite an interest, and cares more for it than anything
else. But the moment other things come in which
are more congenial, you will find it is like the seed
sown on thin soil, where there is, as the Bible says,
no deepness of earth, and that it has all withered
away."</p>

<p>"That's very natural, I believe," returned the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"You talk me over very much at your ease," remarked
Elizabeth, with a laugh; but she was a little
nervous, and slightly excited still. "I am quite

<!-- page 117 -->

capable of taking care of myself and of everything
I may have, without asking other assistance than Mr.
Gavelkind's, I assure you, aunt."</p>

<p>"You need not assure me anything of the kind, for
I will not believe it," Mrs. Travers answered: and
then turning to the lawyer she said, "What I am
afraid of is that Elizabeth will choose the least suitable,
if she is left to herself, which is what girls generally
do. But, fortunately, she has not very much
to think of in the way of money as yet."</p>

<p>"Fortunately!" assented the lawyer. He had shot
one glance out of his keen eyes at Elizabeth, who had
not replied with any sign or look from hers. Then
he directed the conversation into another channel by
commending the dish from which Mrs. Travers had
helped him. She was very ambitious on the point of
cookery, and delighted to hear that Mr. Gavelkind's
cook had never been able to reach the perfection of
these chicken cutlets. "And she came to me from
Lord Youngham's," the lawyer said, "where a great
deal of attention was paid to the kitchen. There was
a French man cook, and this woman of mine was the
first kitchen-maid: but we never have anything on
our table that can come up to this."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. Gavelkind does not take a great interest
in it herself," said Mrs. Travers, well pleased.
"They all know I do; not for the sake of eating,&mdash;though
I think that even in the way of eating we
should all know what we are about,&mdash;but I love to
see a nice dish, looking well and tasting well. I take
a great deal of trouble about it altogether. I'm fond
of seeing a nice luncheon and a nice dinner on the
table. And my cook knows that. Has Mrs. Gavelkind
ever tried"&mdash;&mdash; And here the old lady entered

<!-- page 118 -->

into domestic particulars such as her listener did not
disdain. Elizabeth sat and listened vaguely, hearing
the voices run on, though without any very clear perception
of what they said. She was not interested in
all the ingredients of the sauce, and the elaboration
of the process by which that perfection was reached,
but she knew it interested her aunt, and that there
was no such good way of withdrawing her attention
from much more important matters. Elizabeth sat at
the foot of the square table, drawn near the window
now that the weather was milder, and commanding
the whole wide landscape, miles upon miles, in all
the softness of the spring tints, stretching away into
the horizon. In the midst of this wide scene her eyes
instinctively caught the low square tower of Melcombe
amid its trees. When the foliage was out the
house was almost hid, but at the present moment the
range of those windows along the south front, which
made every one a little chamber of its own, projecting
from the long line of the sitting-rooms, showed all
the way, and reminded Elizabeth, in spite of herself,
of various little scenes. She had sat there on summer
evenings, last year, with Nina and her chatter,
with "the boys," as Pax called them, one after another.
Her aunt's remarks brought those recollections
back. Last summer had been the only one in
which the Travers household had been fully received
into the life of the county. There had been a certain
amount of curiosity about them and their reported
wealth, and their great new blazing house, and then
there had been a certain hesitation before the neighbors
"took them up;" but that period of doubt had
ended in a general advance, and during the last summer
before her uncle died they had "gone everywhere,"

<!-- page 119 -->

as people say. It was a good thing he had
tasted such sweetness as there was in that, Elizabeth
thought to herself, as her aunt discoursed and enlightened
her appreciative listener. Poor old uncle!
he had got as much good as the circumstances allowed
out of the situation. It had been a great pleasure to
him to build that wonderful house, with all the latest
improvements in it, and to overtop everybody, looking
down upon the lower-lying houses of the gentry,
and upon the villages that peeped at various corners.
And at the last he had been very well received in the
county; he had been asked to all the best houses, he
had felt himself to be acknowledged by all the constituted
authorities: no doubt that had given him
pleasure. But now that he was dead, and had left
so many complications and perplexities behind him,
Elizabeth could not but ask herself whether it was an
unmingled good to be thus uplifted, like a city on a
hill, to be stared at, perhaps laughed at. The situation
of the house and her own situation seemed to run
into each other, so that she could scarcely keep them
apart. She was the heiress, known far and wide, held
out to public competition, as it were, just as her house
was held out in a blaze of color and reflection, so that
all the county could see it. If they had stayed in
town, Elizabeth would have been but one of many,
and she would have lived in the unobtrusive level of
a street, in the midst of other houses like her own.
What a pity that it had ever occurred to him to
plunge into this new way of living, to begin afresh
for so short a time in this new world!</p>

<p>Presently, however, the conversation in which she
took no part came to an end, and Mr. Gavelkind began
to fidget and to talk of his train. He had time

<!-- page 120 -->

to walk, but no more than time, and the walk would
be more pleasant, he declared, than the dog-cart which
was at his service. "Perhaps Miss Elizabeth will
walk down the hill with me," he said. And Elizabeth
took him through the new plantations, still so straggling
and unfinished in their youthfulness, by the
short cut to the railway, which was another thing Mr.
Travers had prided himself upon. "Poor uncle liked
to think he had so short a way to the station. He
used to say that though we were so much higher up
than anybody, we had still the nearest access to the
world."</p>

<p>"Poor old gentleman," remarked Mr. Gavelkind.
"What a pity, what a pity! Just when he had got
everything ready for his own enjoyment, to go and
leave it all! He must have regretted it so; and who
can tell whether there will be all the modern improvements
where he has gone?"</p>

<p>"You must not laugh," said Elizabeth. "He was
very good to me. I can't bear laughing on such a
subject."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady! Laugh! No, you need not
fear, there was no laughing in my mind. It is a
curious question, though, and one I often think of:
What will happen to us, with all our artificial wants,
in what I may call Another Place? Don't you know
what I mean? It should be primitive there, if it's
anything; like Eden, don't you know?&mdash;quite pastoral
or agricultural at the most; and an old gentleman
accustomed to a town life and all sorts of conveniences&mdash;&mdash;
If you think I am laughing you are very
much mistaken. I often think of it, and how much at
a loss we shall probably be," Mr. Gavelkind said, with
a sigh.</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>Elizabeth felt, with a humorous suggestion at which
she was shocked, the ruefulness in her companion's
tone,&mdash;an old city man, full of his little habits, in
the garden of Eden! It was not possible to exclude
a sense of the ludicrous from that image.</p>

<p>"I should think," she said, with a little trembling
of her lip, which, to tell the truth, was caused more
by a struggle to preserve her gravity than to repress
her feelings, "that all good people would be at home
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, oh, yes!" cried Mr. Gavelkind; and then
he changed the subject abruptly, pausing upon a knoll
to take breath, and pointing with a wave of his hand
toward Melcombe. "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I've
known you all your life, and I am one of your trustees:
tell me, is there any truth in what Mrs. Travers
said?"</p>

</div>

<p>ELIZABETH came quickly up the slope, having parted
with the lawyer at the gate. Perhaps the color on her
face was partly from the climb, but it was no doubt
a little from the cross-examination to which she had
been subjected. Something in it! She had answered
quickly, "Nothing whatever!" with a little start almost
of offense. Then she had laughed, and said it
was silly of her to feel annoyed. "My aunt is not a
match-maker," she said, "but she likes to speculate
on possibilities, which are possibilities only in her own
mind."</p>

<p>"Many ladies do," assented Mr. Gavelkind. "It
is like making up a novel. It seems to give them a
great deal of amusement."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Elizabeth. "It is too silly to
object to what amuses her: only she ought not to
speak of it as if it were, or might be, true."</p>

<p>The lawyer gave a sidelong glance at the young
lady by his side, whose color had risen though she
laughed. "No, that's imprudent," he said. "It sometimes
spoils sport."</p>

<p>They had reached the gate as he said this, and
Elizabeth had not time to object or protest. But she
was red with indignation as well as other sentiments,
as she hastened up the ascending path. The air was
very fresh in her face, coming from the west, the rainy

<!-- page 123 -->

quarter, and charged with moisture. The gravel glistened,
and so did the polished leaves of the evergreens,
with the occasional showers. It was not a cheerful
day, on the whole, for the ordinary pedestrian, but
Elizabeth, in the revulsion of feeling after six months
of partial seclusion, and with the consciousness of the
spring in her veins, found a certain excitement, if not
exhilaration, even in the hostile weather, the dash of
rain in her face, and the capricious puffs of the changeable
wind. After that quiet period her mind had
sprung up afresh. She felt a tumult of life in it,
pushing forward to new efforts. She walked briskly
up and down the broad walk in front of the house.
Mrs. Travers had left her usual place in the great window
of the drawing-room, and retired to her bedroom
for her equally usual doze, so that there was no one to
disturb or to be disturbed by Elizabeth as she paced
up and down, keeping the confusion of her thoughts in
restraint rather than actively producing them. There
was too much rain in the sky to justify a long walk,
even in the close-fitting dark-gray ulster and cloth hat,
which were things which could take no harm: and
nowhere could she have got more air or a more extended
prospect. There is little doubt that Mr. Gavelkind
had given a fresh start and impetus to her
thoughts with his questions. They hurried on far more
quickly than her steps, which scattered the gravel;
they went as quick as the clouds careering over the
sky. Now and then when she came to the end of her
promenade, as she turned quickly, the immense landscape
below suddenly attracted her, and made her
stand still for a moment. What a breadth of undulating
country, what ridges of trees, what soft down of
the new corn upon the fields. Everything was full of

<!-- page 124 -->

promise and new life; the very sap showing as it
coursed in the veins of every tree.</p>

<p>But there was one spot which above all others attracted
Elizabeth's look. Her eyes turned there instinctively,
she did not know why. Seriously she did
not know why, unless because the recent talk had
directed her that way in spite of herself. For, she
said to herself, she had no connection with Melcombe
to turn her face that way,&mdash;none whatever! There
was nothing in it; neither in her aunt's foolish talk,
nor in the questions which Mr. Gavelkind had put,
and to which Elizabeth believed she had been very
decisive and even peremptory in her reply.</p>

<p>Nothing in it? After all, was that quite seriously
and sincerely true? Or, if so, why, in all that landscape,
did her eyes light continually upon the little
square tower of Melcombe among the trees?</p>

<p>Elizabeth was disturbed by the interposition of the
question put against her will by herself to herself.
One can answer a lawyer, though he may put his question
very cleverly, much better than one can answer
one's self. When one's self chooses to be inquisitive,
there is nothing for it but sophistry and a wrapping
up of the question in evasions, which, however, do
not conceal the truth from that all-scrutinizing judge.
Was there nothing in it? There was this in it: that
there were two young men at Melcombe (Elizabeth
characteristically replied to her aunt's imaginations on
the subject by forgetting that there was a third), about
her own age, in her own position, likely enough either
of them. She turned abruptly round and gave her
head a shake, to throw off any irrelevant thoughts.
Well, what about those two young men? They were
nothing to Elizabeth. They were well looking enough,

<!-- page 125 -->

well mannered, well educated, on the whole nice
enough. You could not better them in a summer's
day. A woman could not complain if either of them
fell to her lot. At Whitelocks the eldest son was a
shambling boy, but the Mitfords were excellent representatives
of manhood. That was all that there was
to say, and the reader will perceive that it was nothing.
There was nothing in it; and Elizabeth Travers, so
far as these young men were concerned, was fancy-free.</p>

<p>She laughed softly to herself, after she had got
over the little shock with which she had been conscious
that herself to herself was putting that question.
There is safety in numbers, she thought; one does
not fall in love with two. But both were interesting
to her, she could not venture to deny. Nay, she would
admit it, proclaim it, holding her head high. In all
the county she had not become acquainted with any
other two human creatures so interesting. They had
both been in love with Pax, in their day,&mdash;dear Pax,
who called them "the boys," and was so fond of them,
and their most faithful friend. There was something
in all this which pleased Elizabeth's imagination. It
was quite a beautiful point in the moral landscape, as
in the scene before her it was pretty to see the tower
of Melcombe rising homely and brown among the trees.
If there were anything in it, that was all, and what
was that? Nothing whatever, as she had said.</p>

<p>At this point Elizabeth became aware of a figure on
the road below, walking briskly in the direction of the
lodge, which lay almost at her feet. There was something
in his air which made it apparent to her that he
was coming to call. How it is that this is always so
unmistakable it would be hard to say, and yet it is so.
You can tell even by the pace of the horses when a

<!-- page 126 -->

carriage is aiming for your own door; how much more
by the attitude of a man! He was coming to call.
Who was he? A large, imposing presence of a man;
holding his head high, walking as if the place belonged
to him. That was how the lodge-keeper's wife
described him afterwards. "Mr. Mitford's a fine
man," she said; "he's like a nobleman. He walks
as if the ground wasn't good enough to set his whole
foot upon, kind of starting off from it, like he scorned
it."</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him for some time, with his
springy step, not making out who he was. When it
suddenly dawned upon her that it was Mr. Mitford of
Melcombe, not the son but the father, the blood flashed
again with double power to her face, and she hurried
in-doors, feeling as though she were escaping; and yet
she had no wish to avoid the visitor. She ran upstairs
to her aunt's room, and tapped at the door.
"Dear aunt, I don't want to disturb you, but here is
Mr. Mitford coming to call," she said. Then she
went to her own room, and threw off her ulster and
her cloth hat, in which she looked very pretty, though
she was horrified at the idea of being found in them,
and smoothed her ruffled locks. Her hair, thus blown
about by the wind, and sprinkled with diamond drops
by the rain, was extremely becoming in its untidy
condition. Perhaps Elizabeth, as she glanced into the
glass, was not unconscious of this, but she brushed it
all flat and smooth with a remorseless hand.</p>

<p>Then slowly, decorously, she went down-stairs and
took up her place in the drawing-room, in front of the
great window, to prepare for the visit,&mdash;which after
all was no more than any other visit, if there were
nothing whatever in what her aunt had said to the

<!-- page 127 -->

lawyer. Elizabeth's heart beat a little, all the same,
she could not have told why, and she had more color
than usual and a brighter reflection in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I understood that Mrs. Travers was seeing her
friends at last," Mr. Mitford said. "I am glad of it,
heartily glad of it. It is not good to shut one's self
up with one's grief, if you will let me say so."</p>

<p>"It was scarcely that. My aunt has not been
well. She is always delicate, and it was a great
shock."</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not like to take the sacred name of
grief in vain. She felt with a movement of shame
that even in the case of Mrs. Travers the sorrow which
had followed her uncle's death had not been of that
sublime and majestic kind, devoid of consolation, in
which youth hopes and believes.</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," assented the Squire, "but we
must not let our emotions swallow us up. Something
is due, my dear Miss Travers, to our friends and to
society. Because one is absent, however dear, we
must not shut out all the world."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was silent, not knowing how to reply to
such a broad statement, and Mr. Mitford went on to
make various inquiries about her own tastes and habits.
He had heard that she had been at the Rectory,
with that noble mare of hers. It would have been
very pleasant to him if she had come as far as Melcombe;
but he was aware that his little Nina was too
much of a child to be any attraction, and that he and
a parcel of sons could scarcely expect such a visitor,
"though we should all have felt it a great honor," he
added. He had always been civil to Elizabeth, being
the kind of man who is never unaffected by the presence
of a woman with any pretensions to good looks;

<!-- page 128 -->

but he had never before paid his court in this deferential
way. The effect was somewhat bewildering,
slightly amusing, half oppressive; and Elizabeth was
glad when Mrs. Travers appeared, to whom he made
some of these pretty speeches over again.</p>

<p>"I have no one to pay visits for me," he said; "my
little daughter's too young. You must accept me as
the representative of my family, Mrs. Travers, and
let me express my pleasure in the thought that we
shall have you in the midst of us again."</p>

<p>"You are very obliging, Mr. Mitford," returned
Mrs. Travers. The little lady was much surprised
and slightly excited by this unexpected cordiality. It
looked as if he must mean something, but what to a
six months' widow of her respectable standing could
the man mean?</p>

<p>"My sons have just left me," said the Squire.
"One can't easily keep young men out of London at
this time of the year. Roger, indeed, is not at all a
man for town; but it takes some time to get out of
the engagements which a young fellow plunges into
without thought. He'll make a good family man one
of these days."</p>

<p>"He ought to marry," declared Mrs. Travers.
"That is the best thing to steady a young man."</p>

<p>"The very best, my dear lady,&mdash;the foundation of
all real happiness, as you and I, alas, have good reason
to know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers eyed her visitor with some curiosity.
"I don't see why you should say 'alas.' It has been
the very best thing for me that ever happened in my
life, and I am sure my poor dear would have said so
too. He has left me only a life interest in the property,"
she added abruptly, fixing her eyes coldly upon

<!-- page 129 -->

the visitor, in whom, with all directness and a good
deal of the pleasure of being acute enough to see
through and through him, she saw a possible candidate
for the reversion of Mr. Travers' possessions.
The widow felt that there should be no deception practiced
upon him in that respect.</p>

<p>"A life interest!" Mr. Mitford said. He knew all
about the will, much better than she herself did. "I
thought that Miss Travers&mdash;I thought that"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked quickly up at him with a keen
glance of meaning, which he did not understand,
though it startled him. "I am sure, aunt, that Mr.
Mitford does not care to examine into our private affairs,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I have no secrets, Elizabeth; everything has always
been quite clear and above-board with me. So
near a neighbor might easily be interested. Yes, the
property is all locked up hard and fast. It was his
own, to do what he liked with it, and I never should
have gone against him. The only thing that I feel a
little is that he might have known me better, and had
more confidence; but no doubt everything is for the
best."</p>

<p>"That is always a satisfaction," remarked the
Squire piously, "whatever our circumstances may
be."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Mrs. Travers, "but no doubt you
have noticed that people seldom say so when they are
pleased with their circumstances. I care nothing
about the property, for in any case of course Elizabeth
should have had it after me, all the same. It is only
the want of confidence that is a little vexing. But you
great proprietors, I have always heard say, have just
as little freedom with your entails."</p>

<!-- page 130 -->

<p>"Not I," replied Mr. Mitford briskly. "There is
no entail to speak of in my property. I can leave it
to whom I like, the youngest as easily as the eldest,&mdash;or
away from them altogether, if I please."</p>

<p>"Dear me," exclaimed Mrs. Travers; then, after a
pause, "It must give you a great deal of hold on them
to have that in your power."</p>

<p>"It does," he said, with a satisfied expression, shutting
his mouth after the words were said, as if he had
closed and locked the door of his treasures. Elizabeth
sat and looked on with a curious terror and repugnance
growing upon her. These two old people (as
she thought them, though neither was very old), comparing
notes with a certain eagerness of fellow-feeling
over their power to influence the generations after
them, sent a chill into her blood. One of them, at
least, might be impotent to do anything, but there was
a gleam in Mrs. Travers' eyes which told how much
she also would like to have the power of posthumous
revenge or injury in her hands.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a great thing to be able to do what
one pleases," Mrs. Travers observed, with a long-drawn
breath. "It must make you feel that what
you have is really your own. But that can never be
a woman's case unless she is an heiress in her own
right, as Elizabeth will be when I am gone. She will
be like you, quite free to leave it to whom she likes."</p>

<p>"We must tie her down in her marriage settlements,"
said the Squire, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"If I were she, I should not let myself be tied
down. I should keep it in my own hands. Money is
power, don't you know? I never was in that position.
My husband's money was almost all of his own making,
and I never questioned his right to dispose of it.

<!-- page 131 -->

Lizzy is his natural heir, as we never had any children
of our own, his natural-born heir, being his brother's
daughter&mdash;while I," she continued with an irony
which gave her a certain enjoyment, "was only his
wife."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford was completely puzzled. He could not
but ask himself whether there was not some codicil,
some rider to the will which he had seen, which made
her a more important person than he had thought.
If it were only after her death that Elizabeth inherited!&mdash;and
she was not an old woman from his
point of view. He continued the conversation with
unabated cordiality, and took his leave with many
pretty speeches, but he carried with him subject for
thought. If after all there should be nothing to be
got by it till after the aunt's death!</p>

<p>"Dear aunt," Elizabeth said when he was gone,
"since you care so much for it, I wish the money had
been yours, and yours only; but may we not keep
that grievance to ourselves?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why I shouldn't speak of it, Lizzy.
It is no grievance. I should have done the same
whatever had happened; but there are circumstances
in which everybody, and a gentleman particularly,
ought to know the exact truth"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A gentleman particularly!" Elizabeth repeated in
consternation; but the meaning of the phrase entirely
escaped her, though it seemed to mean more than
reached the ear.</p>

<p>XII.</p>

<p class="small">MR. MITFORD'S INVESTIGATIONS.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. MITFORD, it is needless to say, had no such
ideas in his mind as those which had been suggested
by his remarks to his widowed neighbor. As a general
rule he disliked women, having found them in
his way all his life. His daughters had happily gone
off, and had not troubled him,&mdash;all but Nina, who
was not a disagreeable plaything in her way, and for
whom one of her married sisters would probably provide
before long. He did not contemplate with any
pleasure the introduction into his house of even a
Mrs. Roger, though he was aware that a certain additional
respectability, a greater claim upon the regard
of your neighbors, follows the presence of a mistress
in the house. He scorned, indeed, the notion that a
house could be better ordered, or its expenses regulated
better, under feminine supervision than under
his own. Nay, he knew that he was a better housekeeper
than any woman, as a man when he gives his
mind to it is sure to be, the Squire believed. But he
was a little disturbed in his mind by Mrs. Travers'
statements. He had looked up the will in Doctors'
Commons without making any fuss about it, and he
was aware exactly how things stood. The idea of a
codicil was impossible, since that must have been registered
and in evidence also. But nobody could say
what a romantic young woman might do. Elizabeth

<!-- page 133 -->

might personally have executed some deed to put herself
in subjection. She might have signed some instrument
which she could not annul, to please her
aunt, or in accordance with some whim of her own.
Women are full of whims. There is nothing they
are so fond of doing as rushing into all sorts of muddles
with lawyers; it gives them importance, it gives
them occupation, and an adroit man, probably an old
ally of Mrs. Travers, could persuade the girl into anything.
These were the troublesome thoughts with
which Mr. Mitford went down the hill, not any idea
of proposing himself to the widow to fill the old stock-broker's
place.</p>

<p>He had a great many things to disturb him, it
must be allowed. Roger had gone away, refusing or
postponing the execution of his father's wishes, and
Mr. Mitford, who was not without sense, began to see
that it was a mistaken policy to urge upon a young
man a marriage which there was any hope of bringing
about in a more natural way. He felt that he
had taken a wrong step, and that the probable effect
would be to drive his son further off from Elizabeth,
not to make her seem more desirable. This consciousness
of wrong on his own side neither made his reflections
more pleasant, nor softened his anger. When,
indeed, should a man be angry, if it is not when he
has made a mistake? Roger's abrupt departure,
though he was aware that in itself it was no bad
thing, had left him in that impotence of displeasure
which is one of the greatest burdens of the choleric
man. For there was nobody to find fault with, nobody
to express his wrath to or pour out its vials upon.
The servants had all felt it,&mdash;but there is comparatively
little satisfaction in wasting your rage upon servants,&mdash;and

<!-- page 134 -->

Nina had fled in tears from the breakfast-table,
which, instead of affording relief, had only
made the Squire ashamed of himself. The two brothers
had gone away together, mutually siding with
and abetting each other, forming a sort of conspiracy
against their father's lawful power. Words could
not express the indignation of the father thus driven
to silence. He had taken a walk to Mount Travers,
partly to get the better of his wrath, partly to make
up for the shortcomings of those "cubs," as he called
them to himself, and keep the way open in case of
after-ameliorations of the situation. But he came
away much sobered, wondering if, after all, it was so
much worth the while. Perhaps he had been a little
hasty; perhaps it might be just as well to wait and
see how things would turn out. After slowly revolving
this in his mind, Mr. Mitford returned to his
original way of thinking. If any silly thing had been
done by Elizabeth, she must be made to alter it; or
if she had been so much more silly as to commit herself
by a deed-poll, or any of those confounded legal
instruments which are popularly considered irrevocable,
why then&mdash;at the worst the old woman could not
live forever. Mr. Mitford thought remarks upon his
own age were in the very worst taste, and Mrs. Travers
was not by several years so old as he was; but he
did not hesitate to characterize her as the "old woman,"
and to conclude that she could not live very
long, even had her niece been silly enough to make
any effort to put back the "life interest," as she called
it, into her hands. No, there could not surely be any
great harm done, there; if that confounded boy had
not run away just at the least desirable moment. Mr.
Mitford had a consciousness that it was he who had

<!-- page 135 -->

driven Roger away, which made him more angry still
at the "confounded boy."</p>

<p>The nearest way from Mount Travers was by the
West Lodge, which, as it was out of the way for
most ordinary purposes, seldom attracted the Squire's
attention. When he perceived it in the distance,
however, there came back to his mind something that
he had heard of Roger's visits there. Mr. Mitford
was not strait-laced; he thought the presence of a
pretty daughter in the keeper's lodge was a likely
enough explanation of a young man's visits; and
though he considered it right to put a stop to such
things, which always eventually do a man harm, yet
he was at the same time of the opinion that among
such people, as in other classes, it was their own business
to take care of their girls. He might have
launched a thunderbolt at his son for mixing himself
up in any discreditable story, but at the same time he
would have felt that if Blowsabella thrust herself into
the way she must take the consequences. It occurred
to him at the moment that he would look in, as he
passed, and see what Blowsabella was like, and perhaps
give her mother a word; for the last thing that
was to be desired was any scandal, so long as there
was even a chance of Elizabeth Travers and her
wealth.</p>

<p>He marched into the little house with the ease of
a man to whom it belonged, and took Mrs. Ford's
frightened welcome without paying much attention to
it. "Ford out?" he inquired. "I dare say you'll
do as well. All right about the house, eh? No leakages?
drains in order? I like these things to be
seen to in the spring, if anything's wrong. It used
to be thought rather marshy about here."</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>"Oh, no, sir," replied Mrs. Ford, with another
curtsy, "it's as dry as a bone, sir. We've had no
floods here."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a good thing," said the Squire, glancing
round. He was looking for the girl, but he could
not say so. "You have made the place look very
comfortable," he added, approvingly, "and I hear
you've got a nice little garden. What, another sitting-room,
too! I never knew these lodges were so
large."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford's mind was sadly divided between pride
and alarm. When a poor woman has a daughter like
Lily, it is hard not to want to show her, especially
when there is a parlor like Lily's parlor in addition to
be shown off. But she had an instinctive feeling that
the Squire meant no good by his visit, and that it
might be wise to keep these glories of her life to herself.
She had no time, however, to think; for while
Mr. Mitford directed his keen eyes to the little dark
passage evidently leading to that best room which is
the ideal of such homely housekeepers, there suddenly
appeared in the doorway before him, floating in
with all the ease of one at home, such a radiant apparition
as took away the Squire's breath. Her
mother said afterward, in awe-stricken tones, that
never before had Lily looked so beautiful. The western
sun came in at the cottage window, and just
reached her, touching her hair till it glittered as if
it were all mixed with threads of gold. In color, in
bloom, in everything that goes toward that first dazzle
of physical perfection which the French call the
<i>beaut&eacute; de diable</i>, Lily was at her best. She did not
know there was any one there, therefore she was free
of any of the little affectations of self-consciousness;

<!-- page 137 -->

and when she did perceive that there was some one,
and who it was, Lily's first thoughts were not of her
own appearance, nor of the impression she would like
to make. She had a sense of fright, a sort of suspended
animation till she should know what the object
of this visit was. The Squire stood before her, astounded,
not knowing what to think. He plucked
off his hat, which he had (naturally, according to his
ideas) kept on his head when he went into the keeper's
cottage, a remarkable evidence not only of the
effect produced upon him, but of the bewilderment of
his mind under this sudden impression. He thought
for the first moment that it was some young lady of
the district, who had come to give Mrs. Ford orders
about needle-work, or to visit her in a benign and angelic
way, as ladies are in the habit of visiting poor
women; but when he had taken a rapid note of the
circumstances, of the young lady's uncovered head
and in-door dress, and her evident air of being at
home, Mr. Mitford could not but gasp with astonishment
and consternation. "I&mdash;don't think I have
met this&mdash;young lady before," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it's no young lady," cried Mrs. Ford,
tremulously enveloping her arms in her apron, and
making an unnecessary curtsy, which brought shame
to Lily's face; "it's my little girl, as madam was so
kind to. You've not seen her, sir, for years and years,
and she's grown up, and had a fine eddication; but
bless you, sir, it's only Lily, it's my little girl."</p>

<p>"Lily!" exclaimed the Squire, with a sort of roar.
He did not put his hat on again, as might have been
expected, but held it behind him, ashamed of the
politeness to which he had been driven.</p>

<p>"Make your curtsy to the Squire, child," said her

<!-- page 138 -->

mother, in a loud whisper; and then she added, once
more trembling, and smiling with deprecating civility,
"Will you step into the parlor, sir? This ain't a
place for the likes of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a parlor, too!" muttered the Squire,
stupefied. He felt that he must at least follow the
adventure, to the end, though some confused association
with the words "walk into my parlor" came
across him, bewildering and confusing his mind still
more. The bright vision melted away, leaving the
entrance free, and the Squire stamped through it,
making a great noise with his heavy boots and
blundering tread; for the little angle of a passage
was dark, and he not adroit enough to find his way,
as young eyes can do. Mrs. Ford followed humbly,
scarcely knowing, between fright and pride, what she
was doing. She felt that the sight of Lily's bower
would complete the evident effect made upon the
master by the sudden appearance of that unexpected
figure; but whether he might look with favor upon
these strange adjuncts to a keeper's cottage, or
whether he might roar out an order to somebody to
cast all such unsuitable accessories away, she could
not tell. He might condemn the furniture, but he
could not pronounce any decree of separation from
Lily, the mother in her panic thought.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" Mr. Mitford cried. He was not much
impressed by the room. He considered it rather a
poor thing in the way of a flytrap. "Will you walk
into my parlor?" By the time he got there the
Squire had recovered himself, and felt like pulling all
the delicate cobwebs to pieces, and tearing to the
ground the machinery of conquest. Lily had gone
before him; she had made no curtsy. She turned

<!-- page 139 -->

round with a little gesture of welcome, putting a chair
for the visitor as a young lady might have done, not like
the keeper's little girl. Mr. Mitford drew the offered
chair out into the middle of the room, and sat down
upon it facing the two women, without the least suggestion
that they also should seat themselves. Had
Mrs. Ford the keeper's wife sat down in his presence
without a special invitation, he would have thought
the world was coming to an end.</p>

<p>"So this is your little girl," he said. He cast a
careless glance at Lily, scanning her over from her
beautiful head to the neat little shoes which she was
so careful about, noting all her little ladylike pretensions,
and the faint astonishment at himself which
began to show in her eyes. "She is a well-grown
girl," he said calmly, "and I see you keep her very
nicely. What do you mean to do with her, Mrs.
Ford?"</p>

<p>"To do with her, sir?" The keeper's wife was
choking with mortification and humbled pride. A
well-grown girl!&mdash;was that all the praise that was to
be awarded to her Lily? In her outraged devotion
she could have struck the man before whom she trembled,
the master upon whom everything depended,
whom she dared not offend. Her voice died away in
her throat.</p>

<p>"What kind of a place do you want for her,&mdash;a
lady's maid, or in the nursery? I suppose of course
at that age she's been out. You can't afford to keep
great girls like that idle at home, Mrs. Ford."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" the mother began. It was difficult to
form any words. And Lily, who had stood silent first
in consternation, then in wrath, hearing herself so
discussed, here felt that she could bear no more.</p>

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>"Mother," said the girl, "if you want me, you will
find me in my room. I am going up-stairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lily!" exclaimed Mrs. Ford. It was a double
trouble. She did not know which was the more
difficult to deal with, the terrible master sitting there
in the middle of her beautiful room, discussing her
beautiful daughter as if she had been a mere village
girl, or Lily, who could not bear to be so looked at,
who dared the Squire and all that he could do. The
mother's heart was torn in two; she did not know to
which she should make her appeal.</p>

<p>"Doesn't like to be interfered with, I suppose;
prefers to set up for a lady at home. Mrs. Ford, I
fear that you are preparing trouble for yourself, and
that you have given her a great deal too much of her
own way."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," protested the keeper's wife, almost
sobbing. "You are in a mistake, sir,&mdash;indeed, you
are in a mistake."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's possible enough," said the merciless
Squire. "I am sure I hope it is a mistake. I have
been taking some dressed-up milliner's girl for your
daughter? I am quite glad to hear it. I could not
think how anything like that should belong to my
honest Ford and you."</p>

<p>"Sir," cried Mrs. Ford, in a tone which indignation
and horror made steady, but which came out with a
rush like the sound of a trumpet, "Ford and me we
have served you honest for many a year&mdash;but our
Lily, sir, as madam was so good to, she's more to us
nor master and service and all. It's not her fault if
she's more like the quality than she is like her father
and me."</p>

<p>"Do you call that being like the quality, you silly

<!-- page 141 -->

woman?" asked the Squire with a laugh. "Take my
advice, Mrs. Ford, send her to service. I dare say
Mrs. Simmons will help you to hear of something;
but don't spoil your girl, if that is your girl, by keeping
her at home. She will only get into mischief.
There's a number of young fellows about, and this
parlor of yours is deucedly like the spider's parlor,
where she invited the fly, don't you remember? 'Will
you walk into my parlor? said the spider to the fly.'
By Jove! I'd send her off before the week was out,
if I were you."</p>

<p>With this he rose abruptly, shook himself, put on
his hat, and with a slight wave of his hand by way of
good-by strode again through the narrow passage, and
emerged into the open air with a "Pouff!" of restrained
breath. He had made himself as disagreeable
and offensive as it was in his power to be, and he
had a certain satisfaction in the certainty of having
done so. But even this did not neutralize the shock
which he had himself received. This was the house
which Roger had been in the habit of visiting, and
this the keeper's daughter who was said to be the
attraction. Mr. Mitford was not brutal by nature,
though he had done his best to appear so. He knew
his son well enough to know that Roger was no libertine,
but yet he had felt that if Blowsabella put herself
in the young man's way the consequences must be
on her own silly head. He had no exaggerated sympathy
for the rustic flirt, however tragical might be
the circumstances into which her folly might betray
her. But all his ideas about Blowsabella had died
out when that radiant young figure suddenly walked
into the doorway of Mrs. Ford's kitchen. He had
plucked off his hat in his surprise, and all the courage

<!-- page 142 -->

had gone out of him. This was no Blowsabella, this
was no buxom, forward, romping girl, to meet with a
reward for her folly. The consequences, if any followed,
so far as Roger was concerned, would be disastrous
for the young man and the family, not for the
young woman. This was what had given a sting to
his tongue and brutality to his look. If it had only
been Blowsabella, he would have been kind and sorry
for her. But this was something that must be crushed
in the bud.</p>

<p>Curious to think that from Elizabeth he should
have walked direct into this adverse camp, into the
heart of the other influence which made Roger insensible
to Elizabeth! These two images withdrew
themselves from the rest, and came and walked with
him as he hurried across his own park, striking with
his cane at any taller growth, angry and anxious,
turning over in his mind the strange combinations of
which he had been unconscious before. The Squire
knew, the conviction flashing across his mind like an
arrow, that in Roger's place it would not have been
the high-toned and serious Elizabeth, in the maturity
of twenty-five, that he would have chosen, but the
other, in that dazzling early bloom of hers, that apparition
of light in the dimness of the cottage. Good
heavens! Ford the keeper's daughter! To see her
seated at the head of the table at Melcombe would be
a revolution indeed.</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<div class="center" id="XIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XIII.</p>

<p class="small">NINA'S VIEWS.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was very surprising to the Squire to find himself
at table with no other companion save Nina, the only
member of the family left at home. When he had
been alone in the house before, this little person had
been still in the school-room, and her father had not
been incommoded by her company; and to see her
rise from her seat, as he passed through, forgetting all
about her, and timidly precede him to the dining-room,
took him entirely aback. He felt, somehow,
that she must disappear with her brothers, and that
his dinner would be the easy and solitary "square
meal" which it had been many times before, without
the least idea on his part that it was dreary to be
alone. She was not seated even at the other end of
the table, where he could have ignored her, but, by
the considerateness of the butler, who thought Miss
Nina would feel lonely, her place had been laid quite
near her father's, so that they might entertain each
other mutually. The situation was one for which Mr.
Mitford was not prepared. He had nothing to say to
his own little girl. Politeness might have suggested a
few nothings to answer the uses of conversation with
other juvenile members of Nina's class, but a man has
no need to be polite to his own child, and he had not
a notion what Nina was capable of talking about, or
if there was anything, indeed, that was likely to interest

<!-- page 144 -->

her among the subjects with which he was acquainted.
Asking her rather gruffly if she would take
soup, if she would like some fish, served the purpose
for a little; but when it came to the beef and mutton
stage, which was with the Squire, an old-fashioned
Englishman, priding himself on an excellent appetite,
a prolonged period, the sight of her, saying nothing,
eating nothing, sitting with little hands clasped before
her, ready with a timid smile whenever he looked at
her, became more and more an embarrassment to him.
He broke forth at last with a question in which his
own <i>ennui</i> found vent, though it appeared to be intended
to gauge hers: "Isn't it a great bore to you,
Nina, to sit at table with me alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, papa," cried Nina, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Not a bore? Well, you are a better creature than
I am, which is very likely at your age. Aren't you
sorry, then, that your brothers are away?"</p>

<p>"Very sorry, papa," Nina answered; and then
there was a pause again.</p>

<p>"It's your turn now to fire away," he said, after a
moment. "I've asked you two questions, now you
can ask me two."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I?" said Nina, faster than seemed possible,
clapping her hands softly with apparent pleasure.
"That is exactly what I should like: for I want above
all things to ask you why it was that Roger and Edmund
went away so very suddenly? They said nothing
of it at dinner, and yet they were off by the early
train."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the Squire, with his mouth full,
"they had got tired of the country."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure it wasn't that; they are both fond
of the country. Either they heard some news, or

<!-- page 145 -->

something happened, or perhaps you scolded them.
You talked very loud after dinner, and you were angry
with me when you dashed in and found me sitting
near the door."</p>

<p>"That was because I don't want you to get into that
mean sort of womanish way. You looked as if you
had been listening at the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, papa, never; but I always sit at that end
of the room for company. To hear voices is something;
it makes you feel as if you were not quite alone,
though you may not hear a word they say."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Mitford. He resolved from that
moment to put a guard upon his tongue; for if it is
only saying "deuce," and other words that begin with
a <i>d</i>, a man would rather not say these things in a
girl's ear.</p>

<p>"And when I saw them go away, I thought that
perhaps you had been scolding them, papa."</p>

<p>"Scolding does not make so much difference at your
brothers' age as at yours," he said, softening in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it? Roger had an angry look, as if he
were going against his will, and Edmund was very
anxious to get him to go. The servants say"&mdash;But
here Nina pursed up her mouth suddenly, perceiving
Mr. Larkins, the butler, in the background. It was
difficult to see the attendants, except the footman in
his white stockings, which were visible low down,
going round the table; for the lamp which hung over
it was shaded, and left everything beyond in an uncertain
aspect. But she saw Larkins like a shadow
standing by the great sideboard, and her mouth was
closed.</p>

<p>"What do the servants say?"</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>"I will tell you afterwards, papa," the little girl
said.</p>

<p>"Prudent, by Jove, that little thing," the Squire
said to himself, as if this had been a crowning wonder.
He did not speak again till the beef had gone, and
something of a savory character, replacing the exhausted
game, smoked upon his plate, while Nina ate
her rice pudding. Then he resumed, quite unconscious
that such keen observers as his child and his servant
could easily trace the line of connection between his
present utterance and what had been last said.</p>

<p>"Do you ever pass by the West Lodge in your
little walks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the Fords', papa? Yes, to be sure," cried
Nina. "Lily is just a little older than me. I have
always known her. Oh, isn't she pretty? We all
think so in this house."</p>

<p>"Who thinks so? I don't understand what you
mean by 'all,' " exclaimed the Squire, with lowering
looks.</p>

<p>"They are a little jealous of her," said Nina,
"which is not wonderful, for she does not look like
them at all. She is quite a lady, Mrs. Simmons says.
You may think how lovely she must be when Simmons
allows it. They say she has a great many admirers,
and that"&mdash;&mdash; Here Nina gave a little cough of intelligence,
and made a slight gesture with her hand towards
the flowers on the table. "<i>Him</i>, you know,"
she said, nodding her head.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried the Squire, confounded,
Nina's confidential communication being
more than any man's patience could bear.</p>

<p>Nina drew closer to him, and put her hand to her
mouth. "The gardener, you know," she said, "but

<!-- page 147 -->

I don't like to mention his name aloud, because of the
men."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Mr. Mitford. He had been
very careless of his little girl: he had paid no more
attention to her, as she grew up, than if she had been
one of the hounds. But in that moment he got his
reward. "Do you know," he said, angrily, "that you
talk like a little village gossip, Nina? What have
you to do with such stories? If I hear you discoursing
again upon the servants and their love affairs, or any
other affairs, I shall send you back to the school-room,
and you shall not appear here again."</p>

<p>Poor Nina gave a little frightened cry. She did
not know what she had done. The color went out of
her cheeks. She sat quaking, thrown back upon herself,
her eyes filling with tears that she dared not let
fall. "Oh, papa!" she said, faintly. This threat
penetrated to her very heart, for no one could know so
well what the school-room was as the last of the little
victims who had languished there, to be delivered only
by marriage. Nina saw with very clear prevision that
it was very unlikely she ever could be emancipated by
marriage, seeing that she never met any one, and that
nobody ever came to Melcombe who was not, she said
to herself, half a hundred. The poor child's heart
sank within her. She had been bolder than usual, encouraged
by her father's attention to her little chatter,
and she did not know into what pitfall it was that she
had dropped. She sat quite still, sometimes lifting a
pair of wistful eyes towards him, while the wearisome
dinner concluded. The servants, stealing about in the
shade, with their subdued steps silently offering all
the fruits of the dessert, which she would have liked
very much, but had not the courage to touch, were like

<!-- page 148 -->

ghosts to Nina; and her father's severe face, in the
light of the lamp, shone upon her like that of an
awful judge who should presently pronounce sentence
upon her. Larkins and his satellites were a kind
of protection; they saved her temporarily, at least,
from receiving her sentence, and when she saw them
preparing to go away, her heart sank. The Squire
did not say a word during the conclusion of the dinner.
He did not hurry over it; he took everything as leisurely
as usual, showing no burning desire to proceed
to the execution of Nina. But in this she could not
take any comfort, not seeing in reality how it was.</p>

<p>When the servants had left the room, Mr. Mitford,
after a brief interval, spoke, and his voice seemed to
fill all the room with echoes. Nina was so paralyzed
with fear that she did not perceive its softened tone.</p>

<p>"You have no business with the affairs of the servants.
Keeper and gardener, or whatever they are,
you have nothing to do with them. It is not becoming
in the young lady of the house to discuss their
concerns or intentions; remember that, Nina."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," assented the girl, scarcely venturing
to breathe.</p>

<p>"However," said the Squire, "now those fellows are
gone who have ears for everything, you may tell me
what you know about this business. That daughter
of Ford's is going to marry the gardener, is she? And
a very good thing, too; it will keep her out of the
way of mischief: and when is <i>that</i> to be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, papa," said Nina, without raising
her eyes.</p>

<p>"You seemed to know all about it a few minutes
ago. I didn't mean to frighten you, child. Speak
up, and tell me what you do know."</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>Nina began to pluck up a little courage. "It is
only what they say. They all think a great deal of
Mr. Witherspoon, the gardener. They say he is quite
the gentleman, and so clever. They think he is too
good for Lily. Mr. Witherspoon was once after Miss
Brown, the steward's sister. You know, papa, she is
Scotch, too."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mr. Mitford, with a nod of his head;
"go on. So little Ford has cut out the red-haired
one? I shouldn't have thought by Miss Lily's looks
she would be content with such small game."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is not in love with him at all," cried Nina,
forgetting her caution. "It is all her father and
mother, just like a story-book. But some take Miss
Brown's side. Old Simmons is all for Lily; she is
always having private talks with Mr. Witherspoon.
They say she wants to get her married and out of the
way; for, papa," said the girl, dropping her voice, and
putting out her hand with the instinct of a true gossip
for the dramatic climax, "papa, they say that all the
gentlemen are always going to the West Lodge.
They all think so much of her, for to be pretty is all
the gentlemen think of; and they say that Roger"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"All the gentlemen!" cried the Squire, with a sudden
quiver of rage which appalled Nina. "What do
you mean by all the gentlemen, you little gossip, you
confounded little&mdash;&mdash; How dare you say anything
about Roger! How dare you discuss your brother
with the servants! Do you mean to tell me that
Roger&mdash;that Roger"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," cried Nina, beginning to weep, "<i>I</i> don't
talk about Roger. I only hear what they say."</p>

<p>"What <i>they</i> say! The people in the servants' hall?
By Jove," said the Squire, "you ought to go out to

<!-- page 150 -->

service yourself; you seem just of their kind." He
got up in his impatience, and began to pace about the
room, as he had done on the previous night. "I have
a nice family," he went on. "A son who is after Lily
Ford, the keeper's daughter; and you, you little soubrette,
you waiting-maid, you Cinderella! I believe,
by Jove, you have been changed at nurse, and it is
Lily Ford who is the lady, and you that should be
sent to the servants' hall."</p>

<p>Nina sank altogether under this storm. She began
to cry and sob. Instead of getting better, as things
had promised to do, here was everything worse and
worse! The school-room, with which she had been
threatened first, was bad enough; but the servants'
hall! As the Squire went on enumerating his own
misfortunes, piling darker and darker shades of reprobation
upon the children who were bringing him shame,
fear and dismay overwhelmed the poor little girl. She
was at last unable to keep down her misery, and ran
and flung herself, half on the ground before him, half
clinging to his elbow. "Oh, papa! send me to Geraldine
or Amy,&mdash;they will take me in; send me to
aunt Dacres; send me to school, even, if you are so
very, very angry; but don't send me to service; don't
put me in a place like one of the maids. Oh, papa,
papa! I am your own daughter, whatever you may
think. I am Nina,&mdash;indeed I am, I am!" cried the
girl in a paroxysm that shook her little frame, and
even shook his great bulk. He was moved in spite
of himself by the passion of the girl's panic and the
matter-of-fact acceptance of his unmeaning threats,
which to Nina, with her childlike apprehension,
seemed so horribly real and imminent. He took hold
of her shoulder, which was thrown against him, the

<!-- page 151 -->

slight, round, soft form, in its white muslin, all quivering
with measureless fear.</p>

<p>"Get up, child," he said; "sit down, dry your eyes,
don't be a little fool. Of course I know you are Nina.
Do you think I can stop to weigh every word, when
you drive me out of my senses? Of course I don't
mean that. But you oughtn't to listen to the servants
and their gossip, or put yourself on a level with the
maids; you ought to have been taught better, you
ought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I know it's wrong," cried Nina, rubbing
her head against his arm and clasping it with both her
hands, "but I have never had any one to care for me,
and I have no one to talk to, and it's so lonely."</p>

<p>He took a little trouble to soothe her, partly moved
by her words, and partly by the childlike clinging;
and presently dismissed her up-stairs, bidding her go
to bed and take care of herself, an injunction which
Nina obeyed by holding a long chatter with her maid,
in which she disclosed the fact that papa had given
her a dreadful scolding for something she had said
about Lily Ford. Mr. Mitford returned to his wine
with thoughts that were not at all agreeable. His son
publicly reported to be "after" that roadside beauty,
his daughter talking like a little waiting-woman, full
of the gossip of the servants' hall,&mdash;these were not
pleasant reflections. He had taken a certain pride in
the young men who were his representatives in the
world, which stood more or less in the place of paternal
love; and even Nina, of whom he knew little
more than the outside, had gratified occasionally,
when he thought of her at all, that rudimentary sentiment.
They had all done him credit, more or less.
But there was not much credit to be got out of a little

<!-- page 152 -->

thing who talked like a village gossip, nor out of
probably a degrading marriage on the part of the
young man who considered himself his heir. "My
heir, by Jove!" the Squire said to himself. The
veins stood out on his forehead and on his hand as he
clenched it and struck it against the table. He was
not a man to bear with the follies of his children, and
this was not the first occasion upon which he had reminded
himself that they were all entirely at his
mercy. Let the boy take but one step towards the accomplishment
of that act of madness, and he should
see, he should see! No gamekeeper's daughter should
ever be received at Melcombe, much less placed at the
head of that table where he himself had so long sat.
A hot flush of fury came over him at the thought.
If that was what the fool was thinking of, if that was
what had made him turn away from Elizabeth Travers,
a fine woman with a fine fortune in her hands,
then by Jove&mdash;&mdash; It is not necessary in such circumstance
to put a conclusion into words. The threat
was well enough expressed in that angry exclamation.
A man must submit to many things when he is bound
down and cannot help himself. It is a very different
matter when he has all the power in his own hands.</p>

<p>XIV.</p>

<p class="small">A NEW ACTOR.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was some time after these events, after a period
of great quiet, during which Mr. Mitford had been
living alone with his daughter, seeing her at every
meal, and with a curious compound of compunction
and fatigue endeavoring to talk to her, and to encourage
her to talk to him, an exercise which bored him
infinitely, when he received one day a letter from
Stephen, in itself a somewhat unusual event. Stephen
had heard, he said, that his brothers were away,
though he did not inform his father how he had
found it out, and he thought, if the Squire did not
disapprove, of taking his leave and coming home in
their absence. "You know, sir," he wrote, "though
it is no doubt my fault as much as theirs, that we
don't pull together as well as might be desired; and
as it happens that a lot of our fellows are in barracks,&mdash;for
town is very handy from this place, and they
can run up almost every day,&mdash;it would be a good
moment for getting leave, as I'm not going in for
town much this year. Perhaps you wouldn't mind
my company when there's nobody else about." Impossible
to be more surprised than was the Squire by
this letter. Stephen himself to propose to come home
in April, exactly the time when there was nothing
doing! Stephen to give up town and its delights and
the possibility of running up every day, in order to

<!-- page 154 -->

come home and make himself agreeable to his father,
when everybody of his kind turned, like the sunflower
to the sun, towards the opening joys of the season!
Mr. Mitford was so much astonished that he instinctively
cast about in his mind to make out what motives
the young man might have, presumably not so good
as those which he put forward; but he could not discover
anything that Stephen could do, nor any reason
why he should wish to bury himself in the country in
spring, that least attractive of all seasons to the child
of fashion, the young man of the period. It was not
with much pleasure that the Squire contemplated the
offered visit. Stephen interfered with his own habits
and ways more than any other of the family; he
turned the household in the direction he himself
wished more than either of his brothers ever attempted
to do; he was less amiable, more self-assertive, than
either, and showed much more of that contempt for
the judgment of the elder generation which exists so
generally, whether displayed or not, among the young,
than either Roger or Edmund had ever done. On
the whole, Mr. Mitford would rather have been left to
his own devices; he did not yearn for sympathy or
companionship. If there was one thing that consoled
him, it was, perhaps, the thought of being delivered
from that <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Nina, which began
to be a very heavy necessity. But whether he liked
it or not, he could not refuse to receive his youngest
son.</p>

<p>It was almost the end of April when Stephen arrived.
He came home in the spring twilight some
time after his baggage, having chosen to walk, as the
evening was fine. It was not a long distance from
the station, but he explained that he had made a little

<!-- page 155 -->

round to see how everything was looking. The explanation
was quite unnecessary, for Mr. Mitford was
not like an anxious mother who counts the moments
in such circumstances. He was quite willing to wait
till his son made his appearance in the natural course
of events. Stephen was the biggest of the family, a
large, strongly built, well-developed young man, with
a soldier's straight back and square shoulders, and he
had altogether more color about him than was usual
to the Mitfords. His hair was reddish-brown, crisp
and curling, every ring and twist of it looking like a
demonstration of vigor and life. Edmund was pale,
and Roger had no more than the average Englishman's
health and vitality (which is, however, saying
a great deal), but Stephen had something exuberant,
almost riotous, in his strength and life. He began at
once to interfere, to suggest and meddle. He paused
even before he took his place at table. "Nina, you
should come up here; come along, young 'un," he
said. "It's your place, now you've grown up, to
take the t'other end."</p>

<p>"Let Nina alone," interposed Mr. Mitford. "If
you don't like taking your brother's place, take your
own, and let's begin dinner. 'For what we are about
to receive' "&mdash;&mdash; The Squire's murmur of thanksgiving
seemed to lose itself in the fumes of the soup
from which Larkins lifted the cover as he sat down.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind taking my brother's place,"
cried Stephen, with a laugh, "not a bit! I'll cut
him out whenever I can, I promise you. There's no
reason why a fellow like that should have all the good
things. But now Nina's out, as I suppose she calls
it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let Nina alone," said the Squire again briskly.

<!-- page 156 -->

"She doesn't understand your chaff,&mdash;and neither do
I, for that matter. Did you see either of them as
you came through town?"</p>

<p>"Roger or Ned? No, we don't belong to the same
sets. I never see them in town, and I was there only
an hour or two. I was impatient, as you see, sir, to
get home."</p>

<p>He said this with a slight laugh, and the Squire replied
with a Humph! through his nostrils. Stephen
did not even pretend to be serious in this profession
of regard for his home. What did the fellow want?
What was his object? His father could give no
answer to this question, which was asked mutely by
Nina's wondering blue eyes. She had not sufficiently
advanced in knowledge of life, indeed, to question her
brother's motives, but her look was full of an incredulous
surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you so fond of home, Steve?" Nina inquired
timidly, in the pause that ensued.</p>

<p>Stephen burst out laughing over his soup. "Are
you, little 'un?" he said. "Tell the truth and shame
the&mdash;&mdash; I don't believe you are, a bit. Yes, I'm devoted
to home: but I wish the Squire had a better
cook. Do you call this <i>bisque</i>, Larkins? I call it
mud."</p>

<p>"You will see the name in the <i>menu</i>, sir," said the
butler, with grave severity.</p>

<p>"Sure enough. That's what comes of having a
woman. You should give yourself the luxury of a
<i>chef</i>, sir. The women are less expensive, but they
always make a mess. You appreciate good living,
and you can afford it. Hallo, what's this? Sole <i>au
gratin</i>; why, it's black! I say, Larkins, you must
really tell Mrs. Simmons, with my compliments"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p>"That's enough, Stephen," exclaimed Mr. Mitford.
"What's good enough for me must be good enough
for my company, even if that company happens to be
my youngest son, fresh from a mess-table."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's bitter," said Stephen, with a laugh.
"Your youngest son happens to care for what he's
eating. Now my elders don't know the delicate bisque
from the common gravy, or what your cook no doubt
calls clear. Clear soup, that's the word. As for the
mess-table, just you come and dine with us one day,
Squire, and if you don't forgive me all my impudence&mdash;&mdash;
Larkins, some chablis. Why, man alive!
you don't serve sherry, I hope, with the fish?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there's no news, except what's in the
papers," said Mr. Mitford, to stop these remarks.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't imagine that you expect to see
any real news <i>in</i> the papers," said Stephen. "I hear
there's all sorts of things going on,&mdash;a pretty to-do
in the war office, and the devil to pay among the ordnance.
They tell the public there's no evidence
against those big-wigs, don't you know, which means
that the witnesses have been squared, of course. Government
don't dare to stir up that dirty pond."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, sir," cried Mr. Mitford, "that
British officers, gentlemen, men of honor"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" cried Stephen. "Softly, sir, softly.
The British public ain't here, unless it's for Larkins
you do it. Officers and gentlemen are just about like
other people; a little percentage is neither here nor
there. The country doesn't really mind, and a little
more money to spend is good for everybody. Why,
that's political economy, isn't it?&mdash;or so I've
heard."</p>

<p>"I don't see how money spent in bribes can be

<!-- page 158 -->

good for anybody," said the Squire. "I hope we're
not going to take a lesson from Russia at this time of
day."</p>

<p>"The Yankees do it," said Stephen calmly, "and
they're the most go-ahead people on the face of the
earth. As for the Russians, we shall probably have
to fight them, but I don't mind them in a general
way. They're up to a lot of things. In the way of
life there's not much to teach those fellows. I'd like
you to meet Salgoroufsky, sir. He's the last new
thing in accomplished foreigners: lives better, and
plays higher, and&mdash;in short, goes the whole"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't put any faith in Russians," asserted the
Squire. "Oh, I suppose they're fast enough, if
that's what you like. You know the old proverb,
'Scratch a Russian and you'll come to the Tartar.' "</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Stephen. "Don't you think we've
got a little beyond the range of proverbs nowadays?
A real Russ wasn't known to our seniors, sir, in the
proverb-making age. By the way, I hear Salgoroufsky
is coming before the public in a more piquant
way. They say he's one of a half dozen Co"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stephen!" said Mr. Mitford, "none of that here;
you're not at the mess-table now."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, sir?" asked Stephen, arching
his eyebrows with surprise. "Oh, Nina. Good gracious,
what does it matter? I dare say she wouldn't
understand; and if she did, why, a girl can't go anywhere
nowadays without hearing such things talked
about. If you think the women don't discuss them
as much as we do"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then I can tell you they sha'n't be discussed here,"
cried Mr. Mitford, who had the traditions of his generation.
"What do you fellows think about the

<!-- page 159 -->

chances of war? That's more to the purpose, and a
subject upon which a soldier may have an opinion."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you like shop!" said Stephen, with an indulgent
smile. "I make a point of avoiding it myself.
We're always game, you know, and that sort
of thing&mdash;by jingo, if we do&mdash;&mdash; And so long as it
happens at the dull time of the year, when there's
nothing much going on&mdash;&mdash; Modern warfare's capital
for that; a man can arrange his engagements so as to
lose next to nothing."</p>

<p>"Unless he chances to lose his life by the way!"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, sir," assented Stephen coolly. "Of
course that's on the cards, but fellows don't calculate
upon it. Our only general's a good 'un for that. He
knows pretty well how long it will take to do a business,&mdash;or
to come to smash," he added philosophically.
"The one or the other is sure to happen, don't
you know, within a certain time."</p>

<p>"And I suppose nowadays," said the indignant father,
"with all your new enlightened views on the
subject, you don't mind much which it is, so long as
you get back in time for your engagements."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it fits in somehow," returned the young
warrior calmly. "I don't know whether, in a social
point of view, the smash, on the whole, isn't the best:
for you are always the victim of circumstances and all
the women are quite sure that if it had depended on
you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And as for the country, or the cause, or anything
of that old-fashioned sort"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, well, sir!" said Stephen, shrugging his
shoulders, elevating his eyebrows, and putting out his
hands.</p>

<p>Nina sat listening to all this with very wide-open

<!-- page 160 -->

eyes, turning from one to the other with a rapt attention
which was not wholly accompanied by understanding.
Her mind did not travel quick enough to follow
all these changes of subject, and she was quite unaware
how much of the unknown element of chaff lay
within the utterances of her brother. Chaff is not
a thing which is easily understood (without careful
training) by the very young. She took it all seriously,
wondering at Stephen's wisdom, who by this
time felt that he had done enough in the way of enlightening
his father, and that a little time might be
given to dazzling the sister, whose eyes regarded him
with so much admiration. Stephen liked to be admired
by ladies; even, when no one else was about,
was capable of appreciating the worship of Nina, and
open to the gratification of getting a little fun out of
her, as he would himself have said.</p>

<p>"I say, little 'un! you should see Gerry in all her
glory," he said. "Statham's joined the Four-in-Hand,
don't you know? and there she is on the top
of the coach with all her fast friends; little Algy
Banks in close attendance, of course, and Petersham
and Beckerbaum and all that lot. Why doesn't she
ask you to stay with her, little Nines? You should
tell her you're coming,&mdash;don't stop to be asked.
You'd have such fun you can't think."</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve!" cried Nina, her blue eyes growing
rounder and bigger.</p>

<p>"Once they have their heads loose, how these girls
do go it, to be sure!" remarked Stephen, with benign
admiration. "Amy's to be met with all over the
place, wherever there's anything going on. And to
think they were just such little mice as you, a year or
two since; never a word above their breath! They're

<!-- page 161 -->

ungrateful little cats, too," said this philosopher, indifferent
to the change of metaphor; "they never
throw anything in a fellow's way. Let's hope they'll
give you a hand, Nina, though they take no notice of
a brother: and then you'll remember me, my dear,
and say to yourself it was Steve who put it first into
your head."</p>

<p>"Let Nina alone," said the Squire once more. "I
tell you she doesn't understand your chaff. And I
hope this is chaff as well as the rest, Stephen. I hope
you don't mean that Geraldine, a child of mine"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, for that matter, sir!" returned Stephen, with
cool contempt; then he added quickly, perhaps thinking
better of it, for his father's eyes shone across the
pyramid of flowers in the middle of the table, "Statham's
quite able to look after his wife. He is one of
the coolest hands going. If they go too fast, he knows
exactly when to pull up. As for that, they are in
a very good set, and have lots of fun. I'd let them
introduce the little 'un, sir, if I were in your place.
Gerry ought to do something for her family. Great
exertions were used, as we all recollect, to get her off,"
and Stephen laughed, aware that under the protection
of Larkins he was safe, for a moment at least, Mr.
Mitford being much too great a personage to compromise
himself, so long as the servants were in the
room, by any outbreak of temper. And looks do not
hurt. He was rather pleased than otherwise, amused
and tickled by the barbed darts that flew across the
table at him from Mr. Mitford's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," cried Nina, "I wish you would! I am
nearly eighteen, and I have never been at a dance, certainly
not at a ball, a real ball, all my life. Geraldine
and Amy were asked out on visits, but I think

<!-- page 162 -->

people have forgotten there is a third one of us. And
I am the last. Oh, papa, let me go."</p>

<p>"You had better wait till you are asked," said the
Squire, morosely; and the rest of the dinner went
over in comparative silence, broken chiefly by Stephen's
remarks and comments. He thought the <i>souffl&eacute;</i>
was like lead; he suggested that his father was using
up <i>that</i> cheap claret "that you thought you had got
at such a bargain, sir," he added cheerfully, and with
a laugh.</p>

<p>When Larkins left the room the Squire broke out,
almost before he had shut the door; and indeed he
need not have waited, for Larkins was perfectly aware
of what was about to take place, and as he passed immediately
into the drawing-room, to see that the lamps
were burning properly, got the advantage of it in a
great degree, as Nina had done, when she sat near the
door "for company," on a previous occasion. But
Stephen was not discomposed by his father's temper.
Having spent all his time in "poking up the bear," according
to his own refined description, he would have
been disappointed had the excited animal refused to
dance. Mr. Mitford delivered his mind in very forcible
language, driving Nina off to her retirement in
the drawing-room, and following her in a gust of wrath
a few minutes afterwards. Stephen's arrival at Melcombe
was generally signalized in this way. Papa, as
Stephen now chose to call him, shut himself up in his
library, slamming the doors like an enraged waiting-maid,
while Nina sat and trembled, and listened not
without a certain demure satisfaction in the mischief.
She admired her brother for the brilliancy of his appearance
in general, and for the effect he had produced,
and hoped that he would come in and tell her
more of Geraldine's fast and furious proceedings and

<!-- page 163 -->

the splendor of Amy. Ah, if she could but go, if she
had but an invitation! She saw herself on the top of
the coach, with all the ecstasy of happiness foreseen;
and, as Stephen said, why should she wait to be
asked? Why not say she was coming? A sister
could surely take that liberty. Nina drew forth her
little cabinet of ornamental stationery, hesitated, took
out a sheet of note paper and put it back again.
Could she venture upon it, in spite of what papa had
said? Oh, if Stephen would but come in and advise
her!</p>

<p>But Stephen apparently found something more attractive
to do. He sat a while at the table his father
had left, and smoked a cigarette, which was a thing no
one else dared to do, considering the close vicinity of
the door which led into the drawing-room, and smiled
to himself at something, perhaps at his success in routing
the Squire; and he held up his glass of claret to
the light with an admiration of its color, which was in
strong contrast to his scoff at his father about the
cheap wine. He had the air of enjoying himself very
much, as he balanced himself on the hind legs of his
chair, and finished his claret and his cigarette. Nina,
who had gone to her favorite corner in one of those
deep window-recesses, heard him laugh to himself, and
smelt his cigarette with all the pleasure which attaches
to the forbidden. She admired him for smoking and
doing what no one else was allowed to do, but she did
not venture to steal in and join him, which was what
she would have liked. Presently, however, this heavenly
odor died away. Stephen got up, still smiling,
and went out into the hall, where he put on a light
overcoat and lit another cigarette; then, with that
smile of triumph still upon his face, he stepped forth
into the soft darkness of the April night.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XV.</p>

<p class="small">LOVE.</p>

</div>

<p>INTO the April night! It was very light, for there
was a new moon, which, without giving the effect of
white light and profound shadow which moonlight
generally gives, produced a sort of mystic twilight, the
sky still showing all its soft color, the park lying half
seen, with dim trees in groups and soft undulations, all
harmonious in the faint and dreamy landscape. The
weather was warm, for the season, and all the scents
and sensations of the evening were indescribable, so
full of balm and movement, everything still tingling
with life. The impression of peace and soft conclusion
which belongs to the hour was contradicted, yet enhanced,
by the deeper sentiment of the sweet spring,
with all its renewals. The dew fell like a benediction,
and it was answered by the noiseless but almost audible
(for is not paradox the very law of this soft, self-contradictory
nature?) rising of the sap in all these
trees, and of life refreshed throughout all the old
framework of the earth. It scarcely needed Fine-Ear,
with his fairy sense, to hear the grass growing. The
air was full of it, and of the breath of the primroses,
which were almost over, and of the bluebells, which
had but newly come. There was a rustle, and a tingle,
and a sigh, a something which was at once silence and
sound, inarticulate, uncertain as that faint darkness
which yet was light. It was an hour of dreams and

<!-- page 165 -->

delicate visions,&mdash;an hour in which the young man's
fancy, as the poet says, turns lightly to thoughts of love.</p>

<p>Alas! there are so many ways of that. The young
man whose thoughts we are about to trace stepped
forth in the splendor of his evening clothes, the broad
white bosom of his shirt showing under his open overcoat
at a quarter of a mile's distance; his quick step
ringing over the gravel when he crossed it, coming
down rapid but noiseless on every daisy bud and new
blade of grass; his red-brown hair curling all the
more crisply for the humidity of the evening air; his
whole vigorous, relentless being moving on through
those soft influences unaffected, bent upon one aim,
moved by one purpose, in which there was nothing
akin to the charities of the blowing season, although
what was in his mind was love, after his kind: love,&mdash;with
no anxieties, humilities, doubts of itself or its
own charm, with a smile of conquest half disdainful,
and superiority assured; love triumphant, elated with
a sense of power, patronizing, and yet humorous too,
amused by the delusions which it meant to encourage
and develop. The smiling lips sometimes widened
into a laugh, the elated imagination blew off a little
steam in a snatch of song. He was going to conquest,
going to success, and he knew his own power.</p>

<p>About the same time there stole out of a low garden
gate, opening directly into the park, a figure, very
different, more ideal, yet perhaps not quite ideal
either; a slim, lightly moving form in a neutral-tinted
dress, which made her like another shadow in the
ethereal twilight, scarcely more marked, except by the
gliding, noiseless movement, than the bushes among
which she threaded her way into the silent glades.
Lily Ford had stolen out, as it had long been her romantic

<!-- page 166 -->

habit to do, sometimes on pretense of meeting
her father; oftener still, and especially on moonlight
nights, for her own pleasure. It was a habit which
had seemed in keeping with the poetic creature whom
her parents worshiped. She was as safe as in their
own garden, and it was like a poem, Mrs. Ford
thought, to think of Lily's moonlight walks, not like
the strolls of the village girls with their sweethearts.
The mother, with a little pang made up of mingled
pride and exultation, saw her go out. It was scarcely
warm enough yet for these rambles. But it was so
sweet a night! She wound a shawl about the child's
throat, and begged her not to be long, to come back
at once if she felt cold. "It's a little bit chilly," she
said. But Lily would hear of no objection. A new
moon, and the wind in the south, not a bit of east in
it. "And I'll be back in half an hour, mother," she
said.</p>

<p>Her heart beat as she glided away over the grassy
slopes and hollows; her steps made no sound upon
the old mossy turf. She was all athrill with excitement,
and expectation, and awakened fancy, lightly
turned to thoughts of love. She thought so, at least,
as she skimmed along, a noiseless shadow, lifting her
face now and then to the tender moon, which was new,
and young like herself, and full of soft suggestion.
She was going to meet&mdash;him. How she knew that
he had come and that she was to meet him was never
revealed. It was not the first by many times, and
there was no reason why she should not have told any
inquirer that by accident, as first happened, she had
met Mr. Stephen in the park. She had meant to say
so at the time. She held it in reserve to say now, if
there should ever come a moment in which it would

<!-- page 167 -->

be expedient to make known the accidental nature of
that meeting. Lily's entire being thrilled with the
expectation, with the delightful excitement, with
something which, if it were not love, answered all the
purposes of love, making her heart beat and the blood
dance in her veins. Roger's visits had never caused
her such palpitations&mdash;by which she knew that this
was not ambition, nor the delight of having a lover so
much above her and out of her sphere. It was not
that. She stood half in awe of Roger, though there
was a pleasure in seeing him come night after night
(in the cold weather, and while the other was away);
but Stephen filled her with a dazzled admiration and
delight. She had been bewildered at first by the
careless splendor of him in his evening dress. That
was one glory of the gentleman lover which was doubly
seductive to Lily's aspiring heart. The gardener, in
his respectable Sunday clothes, was "quite a gentleman"
to the servants' hall; but even Mr. Witherspoon
did not attempt an evening suit; and nothing
had ever so flattered the girl's longing to belong to
the patrician class, to get a footing in that paradise
above her, as the splendor of Stephen's fine linen, the
whiteness of his tie and his cuffs, the perfection of the
costume, which nobody wore who did not dine late
and belong to that world for which Lily's soul sighed,
which was, she felt, the only world in which she could
be content to live. All this was in her mind to-night,
as she stole out to keep her tryst: the lover, with all
his ardor and warmth, not respectful like Roger&mdash;and
the love which drew her to him, which was like
wine in her own veins&mdash;and the sense of being elevated
upward into the heaven she wished for, and the
intoxicating consciousness of all that he could give

<!-- page 168 -->

her&mdash;of the life in which she should be like him, in
which those evening clothes of his should be balanced
by her own gleaming white shoulders and the flowers
in her hair. Let it not appear that this was mere
vulgar vanity of dress with Lily. This was not at all
how it moved her. It was the last refinement of the
change for which her heart was longing, her transfer
from the gamekeeper's lodge and all its incongruities
into what she felt was the only life for her, the real
world.</p>

<p>Was it, then, not love on either side? In Stephen's
experience it was at least something more than ordinary,
a sentiment much deeper than the usual easy
entanglements, which had brought him down from all
the attractions of town to the country at the end of
April; and though he laughed a little at Lily's conviction
that in both herself and him, this was a <i>grande
passion</i>, yet there was no small excitement in the
pursuit which he was carrying on at so much trouble
to himself. In her inexperienced soul there was the
sweep of a great current of emotion, swiftly, irresistibly,
drawing her toward him with an impulse which
sometimes seemed altogether beyond her own control.
There had been times, indeed, when she had tried to
stem it, to stop herself, to ask whether what she was
doing was right; and Lily had learned, with an intoxication
of mingled pleasure and terror, that her
power to do so was small, and that this high tide was
carrying her away. With terror, but yet with pleasure
too; for the girl was eager for all the high sensations
of life, and wanted to be heroically in love almost
as much as she wanted to be a lady; so that the
thought of being unable to stop herself, of being swept
away by that great flood of feeling, was delightful and

<!-- page 169 -->

ecstatic, elevating her in her own opinion. As for
any moral danger, or the possibility of ever finding
herself in the position of the village heroines who
abound in fiction, the victims of passion, it never at
any time entered into Lily's imagination that anything
of the kind was possible to herself. There are evils
which can be, and there are some which cannot. We
do not, on the top of a hill, consider how to save ourselves
from being carried off by a flood, for instance.
That she should ever be a poor creature, betrayed and
abandoned, was as impossible a contingency. Indeed,
it did not even touch the sphere of Lily's thoughts.</p>

<p>They met in a little dell, where the trees opened on
each side, leaving a long, soft line of light, descending
from the pale, clear blue of the sky, with the young
moon in it, to the scarcely visible undulations of the
turf. It was scarcely light so much as lightness, a
relief of the evening atmosphere from the shadows of
the trees, and the vista slanting upwards towards that
pure, far radiance of the heavens. It was a spot in
which the tenderest lovers in the world, the gentlest
hearts, most full of visionary passion, might have
met, and where all things, both visible and concealed,
the soft light and softer dark, the silent watch and
hush of nature, the guardian groups of the trees, protectors,
yet sentinels, enhanced the ideal of that meeting.
But perhaps even Lily, discovering before anything
else her lover, by that spotless expanse of shirt
front which Stephen exposed without hesitation to the
night, was scarcely quite on a level with the scene,
notwithstanding the thrill in her nerves and the sound
of her heart in her ears, which was, according to the
last requirements of <i>banal</i> romance, the only sound
she heard. She glided along towards him, admiring

<!-- page 170 -->

him, with a sense that he was, if not a god, nor even
a king, in the phraseology so largely adopted by lovelorn
ladies nowadays, yet in all the entrancing reality
of that fact a gentleman, able to confer upon the girl
he loved the corresponding position of a lady and all
that was desirable in this world. But perhaps we do
injustice to Lily. In the enthusiasm of the moment
she did not think of what he could bestow, but of
himself in that climax of perfection, exquisite in those
circumstances and surroundings which nowhere else
had she ever touched so closely,&mdash;not only a gentleman,
but one in full dress, in the attire only vaguely
dreamed of by admiring visionaries in villages, in his
evening clothes.</p>

<p>It is very probable that Stephen would have been,
though not of very delicate sensibilities, extremely
mortified and shocked had he been aware of the part
which his shirt front, his white tie, and that one very
tiny diamond stud bore in the fascination which he
was conscious of exercising over Lily. Fortunately,
no such idea ever entered his mind, any more than the
possibility of harm occurred to Lily. The thoughts
of the one were so far entirely incomprehensible to
the other. But at the moment of their meeting, perhaps,
on both sides the reserve fell away, and they
were what they seemed for one big heart-beat&mdash;lovers;
forgetting everything in a sudden flash of
emotion, such as banishes every other feeling.</p>

<p>"Well, little 'un," Stephen said. "So you've
come at last."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen!" Lily cried.</p>

<p>After a minute, this transport being over, they entered
upon details.</p>

<p>"Have you been waiting long? I couldn't get
away."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"Never mind, now you're here. You are a darling
to come on such short notice. I was awfully afraid
you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Do you think there are so many things to occupy
me that I haven't always time to think"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of what, my little Lily? Say of me. I know
it's of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen!"</p>

<p>"You are the most enchanting little&mdash;&mdash; Would
you like to know exactly how it was? As soon as I
heard Roger was out of the way&mdash;&mdash; You are sure you
didn't cry your little eyes out for Roger?"</p>

<p>"Stephen!" with indignation.</p>

<p>"Well, little 'un. He ain't half bad&mdash;for"&mdash;"you,"
he was about to say, but paused, with a sense
that Lily's meekness was not sufficiently proved.
"As for looks&mdash;but looks are not everything; he has
his backers, as I have mine. What side would you
be on, Lily"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Stephen!</i>" She rung the changes upon his
name in every tone from enthusiasm to indignation.</p>

<p>"Well!" he cried, triumphantly. "As soon as I
heard they were out of the way I got my leave like a
shot. The Squire can't make it out, Lily. A fellow
like me, fond of being in the middle of everything, to
turn his back on the fun just as the fiddles are tuning
up,&mdash;he can't make it out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen! and you are giving that up, and
the balls, and all the grand ladies, and everything,
for me!"</p>

<p>"Well, ain't you pleased? I should have thought
that was just what you would like best, Lil. To know
you're more attractive than the whole lot, eh? that
I'd rather come here for this&mdash;for a look of you&mdash;even
when I can't see you," he cried, laughing.</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"Oh, Stephen! it is too much."</p>

<p>Her cheek touched the polished surface of that shirt
front, but for the moment she was not sensible of it,
being swept away by the feeling that there was no
one like him, no one so noble, so disinterested, so
true.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good deal, my pet; it's about all a
fellow can do, to show&mdash;&mdash; I shall get the good of it
all the more another time, when we're no longer
parted like this, having to meet in the dark; when
we're"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Together!" she said softly, under her breath,
with a sense of ecstatic expectation, as if it had been
heaven.</p>

<p>He laughed and held her close; he did not echo the
word, but what did that pressure mean save a more
eloquent repetition? Together! Before Lily's eyes
the darkness of the dell lighted up with a light that
never was on ball-room or theatre, a vision of entertainments
indescribable, happiness ineffable, splendors,
raptures, visions of delight. She saw herself
walking into marble halls, leaning upon his arm, dancing
with him, riding with him, always together, and
in the first circles, among the best people in England.
Her heart melted in the softening of enthusiasm and
gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me one thing," she said.</p>

<p>"A hundred, my pet, whatever you please."</p>

<p>"Are you sure&mdash;oh, tell me the truth! don't flatter
me, for I want to know&mdash;are you sure that when you
take me among all those grand people you will never
be ashamed of your poor Lily? Think where you are
taking me from, a poor little cottage. Won't you
ever feel ashamed? Oh, Stephen! I think it would
kill me: but I want to know."</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>"You little goose!" he said, with various caresses;
"if I were ashamed of you, do you think I'd ever
take you among the grand people, as you say?" He
laughed, and the echoes seemed to catch his laugh
and send it back in a fashion which frightened Lily.
"We'll settle it in that way," he cried; "you may
trust me for that."</p>

<p>"If you are sure, if you are quite sure."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," he returned, "and I'll tell you why;
for whether it would put you out or not, it would put
me out horribly, and I never expose myself to an unpleasantness,&mdash;don't
you understand that, Lily? So
you needn't be afraid."</p>

<p>The form of this protest did not quite satisfy Lily.
It was not exactly the reply she expected; but after
all, was it not the best pledge she could have? Did
it not show how certain he was that never through
her could he be shamed? But she went on with him
a little in silence, daunted, she could scarcely tell
why.</p>

<p>"We've something to talk of, of much more importance,
Lily. There are to be no silly fancies,
mind! We'll not often have such a good time as
this, with nobody spying. When are you coming to
me for good and all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my pet, I know all that. I've thought it
over and settled everything. Lily, you <i>are</i> a little
goose, though you're a very sweet one. I believe
you're hankering all the time after the white satin
and the veil, and church-bells ringing, and village
brats scattering flowers."</p>

<p>What a leap her heart gave at the suggestion! Ah,
that she did,&mdash;hankered, as he said, longed, would

<!-- page 174 -->

have given her finger for the possibility, not, to do
her justice, of the white satin, but of the orderly, lawful,
peaceful rite which everybody should know.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with a falter in her voice, "not
if that&mdash;would be against&mdash;your interest."</p>

<p>"Against my interest! I should think it would be,"
he said, "and a nice quiet registrar's office is as good
in every way."</p>

<p>"Ah, not that; a little old church in the city.
Don't you remember what we agreed?"</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment, then broke into a laugh
again. "To be sure," he cried, "a little old church
in the city; St. Botolph's or St. Aldgate's, or something
of that sort, with an old sexton and pew-opener,
and everything mouldy and quiet. I know
where you have taken that from, you little novel-reader;
they're all alike in the romances. Well, it
shall have its little old church, if it won't be content
without."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen, you are not to think me fanciful:
but unless it was in a church I should never believe it
was any good."</p>

<p>"What, not with a special license, and a ring, and
everything orthodox? Do you think," he said with a
laugh, "that I should want to deceive you, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she cried, with a vehemence which
seemed to push him from her, so earnest was she.
"Oh, no, no!" She was wounded even by the suggestion,
which never could have come from her own
mind. "I would as soon think of the sky falling,&mdash;sooner,
sooner!"</p>

<p>He laughed again, but in a less assured and triumphant
tone. He added nothing to the strength of
her denial; why should he? She was sure enough

<!-- page 175 -->

to make all other asseveration unnecessary. And
then they went on, slowly wandering in the soft darkness
of the night, getting under the shadow of the
trees as they turned in the direction of the West
Lodge, for it was time for Lily to go home. Their
figures disappeared amid the groups of trees, where
the clear sky-light and the faint radiance of the moon
reached them but by moments. Not the keenest-eyed
spectator could have followed them through the wood,
which they both knew so well, every step of the way,
round the boles of the great beeches and the gnarled
roots of the oaks. They spoke of all the details of that
event, which had been already arranged and agreed
upon; to which Lily had long ago worn out all her
objections, and now regarded almost as a matter settled;
which had come, by much reasoning over it, to
look like an ordinary event. She had ceased to think
of the misery of her father and mother, which at first
had weighed very heavily upon her; for what would
that be?&mdash;the distress of a morning, the anxiety of
a single night, ending in delight and triumph. All
these points were disposed of long ago; the sole thing
that remained was to carry out this project,&mdash;to carry
it out so effectively, so speedily, so quietly, that until
it was done and over nobody should suspect its possibility.
For no one was aware of these silent and
darkling meetings. No spy had ever encountered
them, no prying eye seen them together. Roger, indeed,
was well enough known to be a constant visitor
at the cottage, but of Stephen, who was so seldom at
Melcombe, and so little known in the neighborhood&mdash;Stephen
the officer, the one who had always been
away,&mdash;nobody was at all aware of his wooing; nor
had he ever seen Lily Ford, so far as the country
neighbors knew, in his life.</p>

<p class="small">THOUGHTS AND TALKS.</p>

</div>

<p>ROGER and Edmund Mitford had gone away together,
much against the will of the elder brother.
He had not consented to it even at the moment when,
obeying a hundred half-resisted impulses, he had
finally, without any intention of doing so, refusing at
the very moment when he yielded, followed Edmund's
impulse, to his brother's surprise and his own. So
unlikely up to the last had it been that they went off
finally by the early train, without any provision for
going, making a step which commends itself, somehow,
in all cases to the imagination of the miserable,&mdash;a
sudden rush into the night, an escape from all
the known and usual conditions of ordinary existence.
Edmund so understood and humored the capricious,
fantastic misery of Roger's mind as to go on without
pause or inquiry, not to London only, as everybody
thought, but as fast as the railway could carry them
across France, till they reached those soft shores of
the Mediterranean, where so many people go when
life ceases to be practicable, as if there were something
healing in the mere contact with those mild
breezes and in the sight of that tideless sea. Even the
journey, occupying so many long hours, in which he
was at once tired out and shut up in a moving prison
from which he could not escape, did Roger good, and
restored, or seemed to restore, his mental balance.

<!-- page 177 -->

He broke out into wild ridicule of himself when he
got to the Riviera. What did he want there, a fellow
in such health, who did not know whereabouts his
lungs were, or had anything that wanted setting right
in his constitution? He stalked through the rooms
at Monte Carlo, observing the play with the scornful
calm of a man whom this kind of superficial excitement
did not touch, and who could scarcely suppress
his contempt for the human beings whose souls were
absorbed in the attractions of a color or the number
of a card. The greater part of them, no doubt, however
conscious of their own folly, would have considered
the plight of a young man in his position, disturbed
in all the duties and responsibilities of life
by the pretty face of a gamekeeper's daughter, as an
idiocy far more unaccountable. Thus we criticise but
do not better each other.</p>

<p>After a few days, in which he composed himself
thus by the observation of other people's imbecilities,
Roger turned back, always humored by his anxious
companion, by whose motion it was that they paused
in Paris, then brilliant in all the beauty and gayety of
spring; and it was only after Stephen had been for
some days at Melcombe that the brothers came back
to London. It was by this time the beginning of
May. Easter was over, and with it all country claims
upon the attention of society. The season had begun
its hot career, and there were a thousand things to
do for all those who were affected by that influx,
and by many who were not. Roger had got back, as
his brother thought, much of his self-command and
healthy balance of faculty. He allowed himself to
float into the usual current, and do what other men
did. If he said something bitter now and then about

<!-- page 178 -->

the men, or particularly the women, whom he encountered,
or betrayed a scornful consciousness of
those little attempts to attract so excellent a <i>parti</i>,
to which the intended victims of such attempts are
nowadays so very wide awake, these, though very
unlike Roger, were not at all unlike the utterances of
his kind, and roused no astonishment among those
who heard them. A fine and generous mind, bent out
of nature by some personal experience, is rarely bitter
enough to equal the common sentiments of the vulgar
and coarse-minded in society or out of it. The cynical
outbursts which grieved Edmund, and jarred upon
Roger's own ear like false notes, were not so false as
the common jargon which men were accustomed to
listen to and give vent to, without thought of any
particular meaning at all. So that the state of mind
of which the brothers were so painfully conscious
scarcely betrayed itself outside.</p>

<p>And they ceased to be each other's constant companions
in the familiar circles of town. Edmund had
his own "set," which was not that of his brother. It
was at once a humbler and more exclusive world than
that into which Roger allowed himself to be drawn,
without any special inclination one way or the other,
drifting upon the customary tide. Edmund avoided
the ordinary and inevitable, to which Roger resigned
himself. He had friends here and there of quite
different claims and pretensions. Sometimes he would
be at an artist's gorgeous house in St. John's Wood,
sometimes at the big plain dwelling of a lawyer or
<i>savant</i> in Russell Square. He did not at all mind
where it was, so long as he found people who were
congenial, and whose notions of existence were more
or less in keeping with his own. These notions of

<!-- page 179 -->

existence, it is scarcely necessary to say, were not confined
to the habits of Belgravia or even Mayfair.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Edmund, when thus freed
of all responsibility for his brother, and the position
which had been little less than that of Roger's keeper,
or his nurse, felt much more at his ease, and began to
enjoy himself. He liked the beginning of the season.
The stir of renewal in the veins of the great city, a
stir which runs through everything, and in which all
her various developments have a share, was pleasant
to him. He went to all the exhibitions, and to the
scientific gatherings, and&mdash;what we fear will greatly
impair any favorable impression he may have made
for himself upon the mind of the reader&mdash;even to
some which are far from being scientific, those which
flourish in the neighborhood of Exeter Hall. He did
this without a blush, and realized with a smile how
wonderfully alike they all were, both in their good
qualities and in their bad. In all there was a certain
ground of honest enthusiasm, and in all a superstructure
of humbug and make-believe, and not one of the
actors in these scenes was aware where the reality
ended and the sham began. In some of these places
he encountered Mr. Gavelkind, the lawyer who had
charge of the affairs of the Travers family, whom Edmund
had met at Mount Travers in the late proprietor's
lifetime. Mr. Gavelkind was something of an
amateur in life, like Edmund himself, notwithstanding
that he was a sober married man, with a family. He
was so sober, so respectable, so out of place in some
of the haunts where the young man found him, that
the lawyer felt it necessary to explain. "You will
wonder to see me so much about," he said. "You
will think I ought to be at my own fireside, a man of
my age."</p>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>"I was not thinking specially of firesides," returned
Edmund; and indeed there was but little occasion,
for a lecture was then going on at the Royal Institution
which was of a nature altogether to discountenance
such old-fashioned ideas. There was a large
audience, and the occasion was supposed to be highly
interesting. But Edmund and Mr. Gavelkind were
both among that restless and disturbing element, the
men who hang like a sort of moving, rustling fringe
round the outskirts of every such assemblage,&mdash;men
who could evidently have found comfortable seats, and
listened at their ease to all the lecturer's demonstrations,
had they chosen, but who preferred to stand, or
swing on one foot, looking on, with their heads close
together, and making remarks, which were not always
in the subdued tone which recognizes the sanctity of
teaching, whatever the character of that teaching may
be.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lawyer, "I ought to be at home;
but my family are all grown up and settled, Mr. Mitford.
My youngest girl was married a year ago: and
the consequence is that their mother is after one or
the other of them forever, and nobody takes any trouble
about me. There is always a baby come, or coming,
or something. It's all very well for half a dozen
other houses, but it doesn't add to the charm of mine.
We don't think it worth while to change our house,
my wife and I, but it's a great deal too large for us,
that's the truth, and a little bit dreary,&mdash;just a little
bit. Mrs. Gavelkind has always one of her brood to
look after, and I come here, or there," he added, with
a gesture of his thumb over his shoulder; where that
was, whether Exeter Hall, or the theatres in the
Strand, or the House of Commons, or Mr. Spurgeon's

<!-- page 181 -->

Tabernacle, it would have been difficult to tell, for
Mr. Gavelkind frequented them all.</p>

<p>"It's not particularly lively here," Edmund remarked.</p>

<p>"You mean the lecturer? Well, I imagine I know
all his arguments by heart. But then, why should he
take trouble about me? I don't want to be convinced.
I don't care much for what he believes, one
way or another. It's <i>that</i> lot he's thinking of, and
quite right, too. It is not you or I, Mr. Mitford, who
will ever do him any credit."</p>

<p>"Softly," said Edmund. "I may be an enthusiastic
student seeking enlightenment on this particular point,
for anything you know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the other, with some curiosity and surprise.
He paused a little, and then resumed: "Are
you really interested in this evolution business, now?
Well, we're a strange lot; that's what I always say.
I see strange things in my way of business every day.
Bless us all, what's a thumb or half a dozen of 'em to
what you can see, going about with eyes in your head,
every day?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, that is my opinion, too," assented Edmund,
thinking rather sadly of his brother and his
arrested life.</p>

<p>"I knew it. I've a little experience with my fellow-creatures,
and I generally know from a man's
looks. We are a droll lot, Mr. Mitford. Last time
I met you, it was at that Fiji business. Odd, wasn't
it? What you call unconventional those fellows ought
to have been, if anybody. Dear me! they were just
as cut and dry as the best of us," said Mr. Gavelkind,
with a sort of admiring pity, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"That is true, too," returned Edmund, with a

<!-- page 182 -->

laugh. "You are a desperate critic, Mr. Gavelkind.
From Exeter Hall to this sort of thing, do you never
get any satisfaction?&mdash;for we have met now at a
number of places."</p>

<p>"Not the sort of places people generally mean when
they say that," said the lawyer, with a chuckle. "I'll
tell you now, Mr. Mitford, that actor man,&mdash;that's
the fellow, of all I've seen, that has got the most confidence
in himself. It isn't a cause, or anything of
that sort, but for going at it helter-skelter, whether he
can do it or not, and carrying the whole hurly-burly
along with him. This man here's got no convictions,"
the lawyer added. "It puts him out to look at you
and me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not very respectful to stand and talk
while he is doing his best."</p>

<p>"That's well said, too. I fear I don't think enough
of that. If you're going my way, Mr. Mitford, I
don't mind breaking off in the middle of the argument.
A stroll in the streets is just as instructive as
anything else, when you've got a rational being along
with you. I know how to get out without disturbing
anybody." When they had emerged into the streets,
however, instead of pursuing the course of his reflections,
Mr. Gavelkind said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been down in your part of the country since
I saw you last."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Edmund. He was taken entirely
unawares, and it brought a color to his cheek, which
was not lost on his companion. "I suppose with
Miss Travers," he continued. "I hope that all is well
there."</p>

<p>"Well enough, and very ill, too," affirmed the lawyer,
shaking his head. "You know the deception
she's got in hand?"</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"Deception!" said Edmund, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know. By her uncle's will she
has everything, but to save the feelings of that little,
useless, uninteresting person"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember," said Edmund; "but surely it's a
sacred sort of deception."</p>

<p>"A sacred falsehood," said the other, shaking his
head; "all that doesn't make it easier to manage
now. She has wound herself up in coil on coil, and
unless the poor old lady dies, which would be the only
safe ending, I don't know how she's to come out.
It's better to let things take their course. You can't
play providence with any success that I have ever
seen."</p>

<p>"But surely, it was most natural, and, indeed, the
only thing which Miss Travers, being the woman she
is, could have done."</p>

<p>"Being the woman she is," the lawyer repeated,
shaking his head. "She's a very fine woman, Elizabeth
Travers. I don't mean in the usual sense of the
words, though she's a handsome girl, too. There are
not many like her, Mr. Mitford: though I don't know
whether she's properly appreciated among all the old
fogyisms of a country neighborhood."</p>

<p>"I think Miss Travers is valued as she ought to
be," said Edmund, again with a slight embarrassment.
"At least, as near that as common understanding
goes," he added, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you're right," cried Mr. Gavelkind;
"that's never within a long way of the reality. A
country neighborhood&mdash;begging your pardon, if
you're fond of it&mdash;is the devil for that. They're all
so precious set up on their own merits. And the new
people, as you call 'em, the new people get no chance."</p>

<!-- page 184 -->

<p>"All that has been got over in this case," Edmund
said. "Her relations&mdash;had very little in common
with"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was going to say "Elizabeth," the lawyer felt
sure. The puppy! And yet what a natural and, on
the whole, pleasant thing to do!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Travers is not a badly bred woman. She
has some sense, in her way. But now they've both
got wound round and round in the coils of this huge
mistake, and the worst is that everybody knows. You
might as well have tried," said Mr. Gavelkind, "to
smother the scent of that ointment, you know, in the
Bible, as to keep a will from being known. Who
tells it you never can find out, but before the seals are
broken it's always known. That's one of the things
that can't be hid. And some time or other it will all
come out, unless the old lady dies, which would be the
best."</p>

<p>"It seems a pity to doom her on that account."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Travers should marry, sir, as great a
fool as herself, who would accept the position and
keep it up. And I don't suppose a saint like that is
easily to be met with in this commonplace sort of a
world."</p>

<p>"Should he be a saint?" Edmund asked, with a
faint laugh. They were crossing a stream of bright
light from an open door, and Mr. Gavelkind, looking
sharply up, saw the wave of color which went once
more over his companion's face.</p>

<p>"If you know anybody so disinterested, put the
circumstances before him, and tell him that the man
that marries Elizabeth Travers will get"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Edmund, putting up his hand
quickly, "but don't you think we're going rather

<!-- page 185 -->

far? I have no right, on my side, to discuss such a
question, whatever you may have."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've right enough," cried Mr. Gavelkind.
"Good-night, Mr. Edmund Mitford. We are a queer
lot in this world. Lord, to think of a man troubling
his head about evolution that can see the contradictions
of human nature every day!"</p>

<p>With this curious bombshell or Parthian arrow,
the lawyer gave Edmund's hand a hasty shake, and
before he could draw his breath had turned round and
darted away.</p>

<p>The man that marries Elizabeth Travers will get&mdash;&mdash;
Edmund went along Piccadilly, where he was thus
left, with these words ringing through his mind.
They formed into a kind of chorus, and sung themselves
to the accompaniment of all the rhythm of life
around, as he passed along quickly, silently, absorbed
in the thought. It was not a new thought, though it
was one which he had never allowed himself to entertain.
Nobody could understand like himself the chill
resistance of the country neighborhood first, the flutter
of discussion after, and all those levities about the
heiress which had flown about like thistle-down. The
man who marries Elizabeth Travers will get&mdash;&mdash; What
should he get, that happy man? Was it so many
hundreds of thousands that old Gavelkind had been
about to say? Half the people in the country could
have told that with a glib certainty, and had repeated
it till an honest heart grew sick. Was that all the
husband of Elizabeth Travers would get? Edmund
unconsciously flung his head high, with a half sob of
generous feeling in his throat. That was not what
the old lawyer had been about to say. Even that
old fellow knew better. The man that marries Elizabeth

<!-- page 186 -->

Travers&mdash;&mdash; The man that&mdash;&mdash; Fortunate man,
favored of Heaven! The tumult of the streets clanged
around Edmund in a ring of mingled echoes, all
chiming with these words. They pressed upon him
so, and rang in his ears, that presently, when he
reached that corner where all the lights were flashing,
and the streams of the great thoroughfares meeting,
and the carriage lamps darting past each other like
fireflies, he took refuge in the quiet and comparative
seclusion of the park, like a man pursued. But when
he got there, and caught sight of the soft May sky
over the wide spaces of the Park, and felt upon him
the shining of that same moon, only a little older,
which shone upon Stephen and his coming at Melcombe,
instead of escaping, he found himself caught
again by softer echoes, like the sound of marriage-bells.
The man who marries Elizabeth Travers&mdash;&mdash;
Who, in the name of all happy inspirations, who&mdash;was
that to be.</p>

<p class="small">SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY.</p>

</div>

<p>THE two brothers lived in the same chambers,
though they did not see very much of each other; for
Roger generally was not out of bed when Edmund
went out, and Edmund had retired to his room before
Roger came in at night. They were in different
"sets," as has been said. Roger, whom society held
as the more desirable of the two elder Mitfords,
though inferior in many ways to the third, had been
sucked into a very usual, very commonplace round of
engagements, which, without any pleasure to speak of,
to himself or any one else, kept him perpetually occupied,
and in the condition of which it is said of a man
that he cannot call his soul his own. But it so happened
that on this night, of all nights, Roger had an
engagement which he disliked particularly, or else he
had a headache, or something else had happened which
made him break off abruptly for once in a way from
that absorbing round; and to the astonishment and
temporary embarrassment of both brothers, the elder
came in while the younger was still lingering, smoking
a cigarette, over the dying fire, which was not out
of place even in the beginning of May.</p>

<p>"Hallo! is that you, Roger?" said Edmund; and
"Hallo! are you still there, Ned?" said Roger.
These were their only salutations, though they had
not met all day.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"Yes, I'm still here," said Edmund, poking the
fire to give himself a countenance; "naturally&mdash;it's
not quite twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that it was so early," Roger replied
with some embarrassment, bringing forward his
favorite easy-chair.</p>

<p>"Some of your engagements fallen through? By
the way, I thought you were to be at the Stathams'
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Ned," returned the elder brother, with a seriousness
which perhaps was partly put on to veil other
feelings, "when girls do run amuck in society, it's
appalling the pace they go. I've laughed at it, perhaps,
in other families, but by Jove, when it's a little
thing you've seen in long clothes, or short petticoats"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gerry?" said Edmund, looking up, with the poker
still in his hand.</p>

<p>Roger only nodded as he threw himself down in his
chair. "It's enough to make a fellow forswear society
altogether," he remarked.</p>

<p>"She means no harm. It's because she was kept
in so much in her youth. We are partly to blame,
for we never attempted to do anything for the girls.
There's poor little Nina. I don't wonder if they are
wild for pleasure when they get free: but Gerry
means no harm."</p>

<p>"Harm!" cried Roger, "that little thing that never
spoke above her breath! She is as bold as a fishwife,
and as noisy as&mdash;as noisy as&mdash;I can't find any comparison&mdash;as
her kind. They are noisier than anything
else out."</p>

<p>"It is all ignorance&mdash;and partly innocence," said
the apologetic brother. "They tell her it's fun to

<!-- page 189 -->

startle the old fogies&mdash;and she knows no better.
I believe most of them are like that. They fear
nothing, because they don't know what there is to
fear "&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Roger kept on shaking his head during this speech.
"That's all very well," he said, "that's all very well;
but when it happens to be your own sister, it takes
away your breath." To show, however, how little his
breath was taken away, Roger here breathed a mighty
sigh, which disturbed the calm flame of the candles on
the table, and made a slight movement in the room.
The fastness of Geraldine had given him occasion to
let forth some of the prevailing dissatisfaction in his
mind; but the trouble in him did not arise from that
alone. "And what's the good of it all," he went on,
"even where there's no harm, as you say? Good
Lord! was life given one to be spent in a round of
stupid parties night after night, and stupid nothings
all the day? What do I care for their Hurlingham,
and Lord's, and all the rest of it? I'm not a boy;
I'm a man. I tell you that I'm sick of all those fellows
that say the same things, and wear the same
clothes, and make the same silly jokes forever and
ever. Jove! if a war would break out or something,
a good, savage, man-to-man business, like the French
Revolution; but the beggars would fight, I can tell
you. We'd neither stand to have our heads cut off,
nor run away."</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose we should&mdash;but why such a
grim suggestion? We'll have no French Revolution
here."</p>

<p>"More's the pity," declared Roger, with a sigh.
"It might clear the air all over the world, and dispose
of a lot that could do that, but are not much
good for anything else."</p>

<!-- page 190 -->

<p>Edmund feared above all this fierce mood, which
was half made up of longing for those scenes and objects
of living from which he had been instrumental
in drawing his brother away.</p>

<p>"You should try my haunts for a bit," he said, with
a laugh. "My friends are bent&mdash;the most of them&mdash;on
mending the world. And now and then one
meets an original who is fun. To-night there was
old Gavelkind"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He regretted it the moment he had mentioned the
name.</p>

<p>"Gavelkind! who's that? It's an odd name, I
remember the name. Something to do with law:
now I recollect. It is the old fellow one used to see
about with Mr. Travers. An original, is he? And
so was the other old man."</p>

<p>"Old men seem to have the better of us in that
way," remarked Edmund. "They have had a longer
time in which to form their opinions, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not the old fellows about town," said Roger
fiercely. "Old beasts! holding on like grim death to
what they call life."</p>

<p>"You are severe to-night. If you knew them better,
no doubt you would find there was some good in
them too."</p>

<p>"Let us have no more of your moralities, Ned. I
can't stand them to-night. Look here, did he tell
you anything about&mdash;about <i>them</i>, you know&mdash;about&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;and
the rest? He's always coming
and going. What did he say about them?"</p>

<p>"Roger," said Edmund, turning from his brother,
and playing with the poker upon the dying fire, "I
am not much of a fellow to ask questions&mdash;but I
should like to know&mdash;&mdash; If you will let me&mdash;I should&mdash;like
to understand"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>"What, in the name of Heaven? Am I to be
brought to book by you too?"</p>

<p>"Bringing to book is folly, and you know it. There
is one thing I should like to be sure of. It may be
among the things that a man has no right to ask."</p>

<p>"Not from a brother?" asked Roger, with something
like a sneer.</p>

<p>"A brother, I suppose, least of all&mdash;and yet&mdash;I
may as well say out what I mean. There is one name
which you have singled out to inquire after. I don't
want to bring that name under discussion: we have
had enough of that. Roger, as one fellow to another,
without any right to ask or pry into your business&mdash;&mdash;
After all that has come and gone, have you any&mdash;feeling
about her, or intentions, or&mdash;&mdash; Right?&mdash;no,
I have no right to ask. I said so to begin with: only
the right," Edmund added, with a little harsh laugh,
"of wanting to know."</p>

<p>He had put down the poker and risen from his
chair, but not to aid his interrogatory by his eyes.
He stood with his back to his brother, staring into
the glass, all garlanded with cards of invitation, which
was over the mantelpiece, and in which the only
thing he saw was his own overcast and clouded face.
There was a momentary silence in the room, into
which the creaking of the chair upon which Roger
was leaning heavily, the fall of ashes from the grate,
and even the sound of footsteps outside came in as
with a curious diversion of interest, which, however,
was no diversion at all. Roger replied at length, with
his chin set down, and the words coming with difficulty
from between his teeth, in the tone which all the
Mitfords knew:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can't see why you should want to know, or why

<!-- page 192 -->

I should submit to be questioned&mdash;or what my affairs
are to you." These phrases were uttered with a little
interval between each, and then there was a longer
pause; after which Roger exclaimed, suddenly striking
his hand upon the table, "I feel like the very
devil to-night. Why do you provoke me with questions?
There is no woman in the world that is worth
a quarrel between you and me."</p>

<p>Edmund made no reply. He sat down again in
his chair without turning round. On his side, he
thought, no doubt, that the question he had asked was
one that ought to have been answered should the
whole earth fall to pieces; and as for no woman in
the world being worth&mdash;&mdash; He could not but say to
himself with some bitterness that the women Roger
knew were indeed worth but little, which, at the same
time, he was aware was not true. An uncomfortable
moment passed thus. Edmund could keep himself
under, and restrain all words of impatience, but words
of kindness were beyond him. Presently, in ten
long minutes or so, in the course of nature, he would
say something on some profoundly indifferent subject,
and the incident would be over, without sequence or
meaning of any kind.</p>

<p>This, however, was not to be. The silence was
broken by Roger, though only by the sound of his
chair drawing a little nearer to the half-extinguished
fire; then he lightly touched his brother on the
shoulder. "Ned, I say, no woman's worth a quarrel
between you and me."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of making any quarrel"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, but I know what you think. I asked about
Miss Travers because&mdash;because that old fellow was
connected with her; because hers was the first name

<!-- page 193 -->

that came uppermost; because&mdash;&mdash; Ned, her name is
nothing to me more than any other; and it's a pity.
My father was quite right, notwithstanding. No,
more's the pity,&mdash;her name means nothing to me."</p>

<p>"But it may, if you regret it already."</p>

<p>Edmund turned round for the first time, and looked
his brother in the face. Roger's eyes seemed full of
a moisture which was not tears; a strange, softening
liquid medium which made them glow and shine. The
look of them went to Edmund's heart. He put out
his hand and grasped his brother's, which was hot and
not very steady. "Old fellow," he said, and said no
more. Emotion in England does not know how to express
itself between two men. Pity, tenderness, an
awful sense of the impotence of humanity, came into
Edmund's heart and overwhelmed it. No man can
save his brother. The tragic folly, the passion which
would not loose its hold, the infatuation which appeared
to have laid its hand upon one, and which the
other understood with an intolerable conviction of the
madness of it, the unworthiness, were beyond the
reach of help. Anger, indignation, wonder, all mingled
together, and all obliterated in pity could do
nothing. Edmund understood, yet could not understand.
He would have given up all thought of happiness
for himself, if that would have sufficed to pluck
Roger from the edge of the precipice. But what could
he do? Words were of no avail, remonstrances, arguments;
nor even the pointing out of a better way.
No man can save his brother. He sank back in his
chair with a groan.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to make yourself unhappy about.
Ned," said Roger, with sudden cheerfulness. "I am
safe enough, and out of the way of mischief here.

<!-- page 194 -->

Out of the way of mischief!" he repeated, mockingly.
"I should think so. There is nothing in poor little
Gerry's set, is there, to tempt a man to folly?"</p>

<p>"I wish there were!"</p>

<p>"You wish there were? You would like to see
Melcombe turned into Vanity Fair, or into a sort of
anteroom to the stables,&mdash;which? You would like
to see dogs and horses, and horsey men crowding up
the place; or a rabble rout, acting, dancing, rushing
about; something going on forever and ever. Which
is better, I wonder," said Roger, "a stable-boy disguised
as a fine lady, with the best of blood and all
the rest of it, education and so forth, or a woman descended
from nobody in particular,&mdash;just a woman,
no more?"</p>

<p>"Is that a question we need to ask?" said Edmund.
But Roger had left his chair, and gone to the other
end of the room to supply himself with some of those
drinks which seem indispensable when men sit and
talk together, and he did not hear; or if he did hear,
did not think it necessary to pay any attention. He
came back to his chair with his glass in his hand, and
began to talk upon ordinary subjects, to the great relief,
yet disappointment, of his brother; and they sat
thus through the small hours, discussing matters not
of the least importance; or, indeed, not discussing
anything; sitting together, while the fire went out at
their feet, making a remark once in five minutes or
so; now and then fortunately hitting upon some subject
which called forth a little rapid interchange of
words for a few seconds; then dropping off again
into that silence occasionally broken with an indifferent
phrase. They had both many things to think of,
but carefully abstained from approaching again the

<!-- page 195 -->

edge of any subject that was of the slightest interest.
They would both have been a great deal better in bed,
and they had nothing in the world to keep them out
of it; no particular pleasure in this companionship,
nothing but habit, which kept them with their feet on
the fender, though the fire was out; and, especially
with a window open, it is not always balmy in London
in the middle of the night in May.</p>

<p>At last Edmund got up, stretching his limbs like a
man fatigued. "I think I'll go to bed," he said.
Then after an interval, "I've half an idea of running
down home to-morrow. There is nothing much for me
to do here."</p>

<p>"Home!" cried Roger, rising, too. "To-morrow!
That's sudden, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't think it's sudden. I'm not one of
your fashionable men. I never meant to stay"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" Roger said, and that was all. The remark,
however, had a great deal in it. It meant a little
surprise, a slight shock, indeed, as of a thing not at
all expected or foreseen; and then a half doubt, an
uncertainty, a dawn of purpose. All this Edmund
divined and feared; but he made as though he saw
nothing in it except that universal English exclamation
which means anything or nothing, as the case may be.
He lighted his candle with sudden expedition, so as to
leave the room before the dull air should tingle with
any more words; before Roger should say, "I don't
see&mdash;why I should not go too." Edmund escaped to
the shelter of his own room before these words could
be said, if ever there had been any intention that they
should be said. The elder brother left behind did
not say them to himself. All that he did was what
Edmund had done before, to lean upon the mantelpiece

<!-- page 196 -->

and gaze into the glass, about which were stuck
so many cards, large and small. Gazing into a mirror
is not an unusual trick with people with troubled
minds. Sometimes one does but look blankly into
that unreal world, with its mystery and suggestions.
There is a kind of fantastic charm in it. Roger did
this blankly, not caring for his own face, in which he
could read nothing he did not know, but gazing into
the void, which was something different from the well-known
room reflected in it,&mdash;something with depths
of the unseen, and darkling shadows as profound as
fate. What did he see there? No prevision of what
was coming; only a blank such as there was in his
heart, without power to anticipate, much less to decide,
what was to be.</p>

<p>Going home to-morrow! Presently he began to
take down and turn over in his hands the invitation
cards. At first mechanically, without any thought;
afterwards with flashes of imagination, of realization.
So many crushes through which he would make his
way, hat in hand, shake hands with a few people, say
half a dozen indifferent words here and there to individuals
whom he had probably met half a dozen
times before the same day, and whom he did not care
if he never saw again; dinners where he would eat
the same delicacies out of season, and maintain the
same talk evening after evening. "The Row was very
full to-day. I did not see you at Lady Grandmaison's.
It was rather a pretty party, considering that so many
people stayed away. We shall meet, I suppose, to-night
at old Bullion's,&mdash;oh, everybody is going."
These were the jewels of conversation which he would
gather, unless horses were in question, or the prospects
at Ascot, or the opinions of the grooms and trainers;

<!-- page 197 -->

or perhaps, which was worst of all, there would be a
young lady in the house, gently urged upon him, carefully
thrown in his way, sometimes to the girl's own
indignation, sometimes with her consent. As he went
over them all, Roger, being somewhat jaundiced in his
view of society, and glad to think the worst of it, felt
a sickness and faintness steal over him. Why should
he stay for that? Was this enjoyment? Town was
supposed to be exciting and delightful, and the country
dull and flat. Well, perhaps the country was dull
and flat. There was nothing in it, save one forbidden
thing, which tempted him very much. But town!&mdash;the
vulgar routine of it, the commonplace, the vacancy,
the same thing over and over again. Why, a laborer
on the road, a gamekeeper in the woods, had something
to say that varied at least with the weather or
the season. He did not ask, Are you going here?
Have you been there? Yet it was for that, that a man
was supposed to stay in London. To give up, to
sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What? Roger did what Edmund had done. He
lighted his candle hastily and went off to his room, to
escape&mdash;from himself, which is a thing not so easily
done as to escape from a brother. "I don't see why&mdash;I
shouldn't go too." Edmund had got away before
these words were said, though he had seen them
coming. But Roger was not so quick, and could not
get away.</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<div class="center" id="XVIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE RETURN.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is not very excellent policy, perhaps, when you
see the words upon a man's lips, and know they must
be uttered one time or another, to run away before
they can be said. As likely as not they will be worse
instead of better when you do hear them, taking harm
by the delay. When the two Mitfords met, next day,
which was not till Edmund was ready for his journey,
it was to him as if some explosive which he had
thought dead and harmless had suddenly developed
and exploded under his feet, when Roger said abruptly,
"I think I shall go home too."</p>

<p>"What!" his brother cried, with mingled astonishment
and dismay.</p>

<p>"What? Is there any harm in it? I'm sick of
town."</p>

<p>Edmund said nothing, but waved his hand towards
all the cards on the chimney-piece, remarking, however,
as he did so, with a chill of alarm, that they had
been taken down from the glass, and lay together like
a pack of cards among the ornaments of the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>"Oh, these! What do they matter? Half the
people will never remember that they asked me; the
other half will never find out that I have not been
there. I might not have thought of it but for our talk
last night: but why should I make a martyr of myself
for a pack of people who care nothing for me?"</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>"Not that, Roger; but a man like you has&mdash;duties.
No one leaves London at this time of the
year."</p>

<p>"You are leaving London. Ned, don't talk any
nonsense. Duties! I'm not a young duke, if that's
the sort of thing you mean."</p>

<p>"You are the eldest son, which comes to much the
same thing," said Edmund.</p>

<p>"With a father who is always threatening to disinherit
me, and can if he pleases; and after all, no such
mighty position, were it as safe as the Tower. Come,
Ned, no folly; London will never put on mourning
for me. Should it shake society to its foundations, I
am still going home."</p>

<p>"If that is so, you will do what you please, no
doubt," said Edmund, with much gravity; and the
consequence was that they traveled down to Melcombe
together, as they had left it, but with no such eagerness
on Edmund's part to amuse and keep his brother
from thinking, which had transformed him into an
exuberant, not to say loquacious, conversationalist on
the way from home. The brothers now sat each in
his own corner, moody and silent: Roger, not unconscious
that he was taking a step which might be fatal
to him: Edmund, vexed and disappointed, saying to
himself that he might have spared all this trouble,
that after all he was but an officious busybody, and
that after one tantalizing moment of hope everything
was as before.</p>

<p>They reached home while Stephen's traces were
still warm. He had returned to his regiment only the
day before. "I wonder you did not knock against
each other somewhere on the road," said the Squire.
"He's always a queer fellow; he told me you were
coming home."</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>"I did not know it myself till this morning," said
Roger; "he must have the second sight."</p>

<p>"He has very keen eyes of his own, at all events;
he gave me a number of tips," said Mr. Mitford, who
was apt to exalt the absent at the expense of the
present. This was the welcome the young men received.
It left an uncomfortable impression on their
minds that their shortcomings had been talked over
between Stephen and their father, which was not at
all the case. To Edmund this gave scarcely any uneasiness,
but it lit up a dark glow of anger under
Roger's eyes. They had been talking him over, no
doubt, in that which was his most intimate and sacred
secret, putting vulgar interpretations to it, hideous
developments. Roger thought he could hear the
mocking of Stephen's laugh, and it raised in him a
responsive fury. What did Stephen know about
anything that was sacred? He had his own vulgar
amours, and judged others by that standard. Roger
quivered with indignation as the image of these possible
conversations, which had never taken place, came
before him.</p>

<p>The weather seemed to change all in a moment as
they left town, as it sometimes does in the capricious
English spring. It had been ungenial and cold there;
here it was May, as that month should be, but so seldom
is, in all the softness of the early year, the air
sweet with growth and blossom, the skies shedding
balm. Something in this delicious sudden transformation
went to the young men's hearts, softening and
charming them. The first dinner, the domestic gathering
for which Edmund had trembled, passed over
quite harmoniously. Mr. Mitford appeared for the
moment to perceive that to irritate his son was bad

<!-- page 201 -->

policy, and Nina's soft storm of questions as to
Geraldine and Amy filled up the silence at table.
Here unexpectedly Roger and his father were in accord.</p>

<p>"Don't you think Gerry might ask me to come and
see her? Don't you think I might write and say I
should like to come?" Nina no doubt was bolder
since Stephen's judicious drawing out had put so many
new ideas in her head.</p>

<p>"No," said Roger, "certainly not, if you take my
advice."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's not what Steve said: he said they
had such fun!"</p>

<p>"I don't think, sir," said Roger to his father, "it's
the kind of fun you would approve of for a girl."</p>

<p>"I have told her so," returned the Squire. "There,
Nina, you hear what your brother says; your brother's
a good authority; not like Steve, who is a rover himself.
Run away now, and let me hear of Geraldine
no more."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" Nina exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I tell you I'll have no more of it," said Mr.
Mitford. "I never liked that sort of thing. Your
mother was a quiet woman, and I've always been
used to quiet women. These girls ought to be spoken
to,&mdash;they ought to be spoken to. But Stephen tells
me Statham is a fellow that can take care of his
wife."</p>

<p>"There is no need for alarm, sir," remarked Edmund:
"the girls mean no harm."</p>

<p>"I hate fast women," said the Squire. "I never
could bear them. Your mother was a pattern; out of
her own house nobody ever heard a word of Mrs. Mitford.
That's the greatest praise a woman can have."</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p>"That is no longer the opinion of society," said
Roger. "They think the more a woman is talked of,
the more noise she makes, the more absurdities she
does, the better. If she has a moment's quiet, she
thinks she's out of the swim. If she stays a night at
home, she's half dead with the bore of it. Women
are not what they used to be."</p>

<p>"The more's the pity. It's all the fault of this
ridiculous education, which, thank Heaven, I never
went in for," said the Squire. "They think themselves
emancipated, the little fools, and they don't care
how far they go."</p>

<p>Edmund had an observation trembling on his lips,
to the effect that education, which the Squire thanked
Heaven he had never given in to, could scarcely be
the cause of his sister's failings, but he was stopped
by a certain nervous air of seriousness in Roger's
face.</p>

<p>"My own opinion is," said Roger, whose eyes had
an abstracted look, as if he were ruminating a general
principle, "that to find a woman of the old type,
like my mother, sir,&mdash;sweet and womanly, you know,
and fond of home, and satisfied to be happy there,&mdash;whoever
she was, would be better than anything you
could get, family, money, rank, whatever you please,
and a fast girl along with it. That's my opinion;
and as I've just come from the midst of them, I
think I ought to know."</p>

<p>"All right, my boy," assented the Squire, "I'm
with you as far as you go. Carry out your views, my
fine fellow, and you may be sure you'll please me."</p>

<p>This pregnant conversation was interrupted by a
question on Nina's part, in which that little person
took a very practical view of the matter. "Should

<!-- page 203 -->

one always stay at home?" she asked. "If Geraldine
and Amy had always stayed at home, they would
never have been married, and then you would not
have got rid of them, papa. I have heard you say
you were glad to have got rid of them. If I am
never to go on any visit, nor see any one, you will
never, never get rid of me."</p>

<p>"Run away, Nina. We've had enough of this.
The first thing a woman ought to learn," said Mr.
Mitford, "is when to go, after dinner. Five minutes
after the servants,&mdash;that's long enough. Run
away."</p>

<p>But the conversation languished after Nina's little
white figure stole reluctantly out of the room. The
twilight was sweet, the windows were open, the air
was balmy with the breath of early summer. The
Squire talked on, but his sons paid slight heed. He
continued the discussion of women which Roger had
begun. But it is rare that such a discussion can be
carried on without a jar, especially when the company
is a mingled one, and youth, still accessible to romance,
not to say actually touched by the glamour of
love, has to listen to the prelections of an elder man
upon this delicate subject. The Squire did not transgress
decorum, he was not disposed that way; but he
was full of that contempt for women which men of
his age, especially when freed from all domestic intercourse
with the inferior sex, often entertain. And it
may be supposed that his talk about what constituted
a good mother and continuer of the race, and all the
domestic qualifications which he thought necessary,
was of a kind little congenial with the perturbed yet
absorbing passion which Roger had held at arm's-length
so long, only to fall back into with redoubled

<!-- page 204 -->

force and <i>entrainement</i> now; or with the more visionary,
yet at the same time more highly pitched sentiment
of Edmund, whose feet were being drawn away
by the sweet, rising tide, but who had not yet ventured
to launch fairly upon it. Roger was the more
impatient of the two, for his mind had gone much
further than that of his brother. He was indeed
moment by moment passing out of his own control,
feeling his feet and his heart and his thoughts swept
along by that resistless flood, and all the will he ever
had against it gone like a useless barrier across a
river. He bore his father's matter-of-fact discourse
as long as human nature, in so very different a vein
of sentiment, could do; and it was at last quite suddenly,
with a start, as if he had been touched by
something intolerable, that he rose from his chair.
"Excuse me," he murmured, "I've got a headache,
I must try the open air;" and he slid out into the
gathering grayness of twilight like a shadow, leaving
Mr. Mitford open-mouthed, with the half of his sentence
unsaid.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Roger is not very well," cried Edmund,
getting up; "if you'll excuse me too, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," said the Squire. "Excuse
you? No, I won't excuse you; sit down, I tell you,
Ned. What! your first night at home, and neither
one nor the other of you can spend half an hour with
your father after dinner? Let Roger alone: you're
not a couple of girls to make yourselves interesting,
fussing over each other's headaches. I suppose the
truth of the matter is, he wants his cigar. I'm glad
he's gone, for one thing. You can tell me what he's
been about, and in what mind he's come home."</p>

<p>"I can tell you neither the one nor the other," said

<!-- page 205 -->

Edmund, not sufficiently under his own command to
overcome his annoyance at being detained, and his
fear as to what his brother might do. Then he
added, "I must follow him, father; for Heaven's
sake, don't detain me! He may be going"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir," exclaimed the Squire, with a powerful
hand on his son's arm, forcing him back into his
chair. "Let him go&mdash;to the devil, if he likes: if
he means to, do you think you can keep him back?"</p>

<p>"That is true," said Edmund, yielding, with once
more that sense of impotence which makes the heart
sick. What could he do, indeed? Certainly not
keep back Roger's fated feet from the path which any
opposition would make him only the more determined
to tread. No man can save his brother. To have to
submit to his father's interrogations was hard, too.</p>

<p>"Where may he be going? What does he want?"
asked Mr. Mitford. "Do you mean to tell me he's
come home as great a fool as ever? Do you mean to
tell me&mdash;&mdash; Why, what was that about women? What
did you understand by that? The fellow's a liar
as well as a fool, if it wasn't Elizabeth Travers he
meant. Right sort of woman, whoever she was;
better than rank, and so forth,&mdash;well! <i>she's</i> nobody;
but she's worth a score of the fast ones. Isn't that
true? What do you mean, confusing my mind again,
when what he has said is as clear as daylight? I tell
you, Ned, if he's deceiving me again"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never said he was deceiving you. I am not my
brother's keeper. I can't give you any account of
Roger."</p>

<p>"You mean you won't. I know, honor among
thieves. You'd rather see your father's heart broken,
and all his plans put out, than split upon your brother.

<!-- page 206 -->

That's your code, never mind what becomes of me.
Your father's nobody, and his interests are nothing:
but stand together like a band of conspirators, and
keep him in the dark. Keep him in the dark!&mdash;that's
what you think honor. It's not the first time
I've found it out."</p>

<p>"Father, I don't think you have any right to question
me so. I should not betray my brother if I
could; but as it happens, I can't, even if I wished,
for I know nothing. We have not been very much
together even in an outside way, and if you think he
opens his heart to me"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To whom does he open his heart, then?" cried
the Squire. "Has he got a heart to open? It doesn't
seem so, so far as his family is concerned. Now
look here, Ned, this sort of thing can't go on. He
must make up his mind one way or the other. If he
will not take my way, he shall not take my property;
that's as clear as daylight. If he's meditating
any disgrace to his family, it shall never be done in
this house, I can answer for that. You'd better warn
him; you shall have it, not he."</p>

<p>"I, sir!" cried Edmund, springing from his chair.</p>

<p>"No heroics, for I sha'n't believe them. Melcombe
is mine, to dispose of it as I please. Unless Roger
does as I wish, he sha'n't have it, not a square foot of
it. You shall have it; I've said so before. You
think I'm joking, perhaps? I never joke on such
subjects; you shall have it. There! my mind is
made up, and there's not another word to say."</p>

<p>"Stop a moment, father," exclaimed Edmund.
"Nothing in this world, neither your will, nor the
law, nor any motive in existence, would make me take
my brother's place. I don't joke any more than you
do, once for all."</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"Bah!" said the Squire; "wait till you're tried.
Your brother's place! It is nobody's place; it's my
place to the last moment I can hold it, and then it
goes to whoever I choose. Hold your tongue, Ned.
And now you can go and look after your brother.
Take care of him, pretty innocent: don't let him fall
into bad hands. You'll take greater care of him than
ever, now you know what'll happen if you don't succeed."</p>

<p>He went off, with a laugh that rang through the
room, tramping along the corridor with his quick footstep,
which was not heavy for so large a man, yet
vibrated through the house, finding out somehow
every plank that sounded and every joint that creaked,
as no other step did. When that hasty progress had
concluded with the swing of the library door, another
door opened softly, and Nina stole in.</p>

<p>"Oh, is papa angry? Oh, Edmund, is it about
me?"</p>

<p>"Nina, you have been listening again?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; oh, no: besides, I could not hear a
single word; everything was quiet, as if you had been
the best of friends. It is only his step like that, and
then he slammed the library door."</p>

<p>"The library door always makes a noise; no one
was angry; there was not a word said about you. Be
satisfied, Nina; I'll come and talk to you afterwards.
I'm going out a little now."</p>

<p>"Are you going after Roger, Edmund? for I'm
sure he's gone to the West Lodge."</p>

<p>"What do you know about the West Lodge?
What nonsense you talk, Nina! What should Roger
do there? He has gone to smoke his cigar."</p>

<p>"I know very well," said the girl, "he had no cigar.

<!-- page 208 -->

He came round to the hall to get a hat, and then he
went off. Oh! I know quite well what it means when
people walk in that way."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"I am not very good at explaining: going straight
on, with their heads bent, as if they did not want to
look where they were going, because they knew so
well. Do you mean to say you don't know?"</p>

<p>Edmund, alas, knew very well what she meant.
He flung himself back into a chair with that sense of
despairing which had seized him so strongly on various
occasions already. What could he do to stop
those steps of fate?</p>

<!-- page 209 -->

<div class="center" id="XIX">

<p>XIX.</p>

<p class="small">ANOTHER TWILIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p>ROGER went out into the twilight without seeing anything,
with his head bent, taking long steps straight
forward, as his sister had said. While he had been
musing the fire had burned. All the way down in the
silence of the noisy train, all through the dinner hour
with its needful ceremonials, the thoughts so long
repressed had been flowing on and on in full stream,
until his heart was full and could no longer contain
itself. He had relieved himself a little by these enigmatical
speeches about women. "A woman of the
old type, like my mother, sweet and womanly and
fond of home, and satisfied to be happy there&mdash;whoever
she might be&mdash;would be better"&mdash;&mdash; It was a
relief to say this: it was the last development of the
thought which had given him so much comfort, perhaps
the first thought which had given him any comfort
at all in the whole matter. Instead of a fast
woman, or a horsey woman, or a woman given up to
"fun" and sport, to find one who was all a woman,
the flower of life, the sweet, the gentle, and the true.
No one could deny that; it was clear as daylight. It
might be a good thing, if you so chanced it, to find
such a woman in your own class,&mdash;one that knew all
the little punctilios, how to receive your guests, and
sit at the head of your table, and all that. Yes, it
might be a good thing: one who had connections

<!-- page 210 -->

something like your own, though everybody says your
wife's relations are a bore. That might be an advantage,
if it so happened. But otherwise, instead of
one of the society women, those creatures who cared
for nothing but amusement, how much better to have
a fresh and uncontaminated being, vigorous and pure
as nature could make her, knowing no harm nor
thinking any! A wife like that brought new blood
and new possibilities to a house. It was a thing that
ought to be done, for mere policy, from time to time.
True, there might be drawbacks,&mdash;drawbacks that
were very evident on the face of them: the father
and mother, for example, who would turn everything
upside down. That could never be a pleasant thought:
but it was better than a band of fast girls and doubtful
men who would convert one's house into a beargarden.
People put up with these last because the
offenders had good names, because they were in "society,"
though Heaven knows their manners were
often bad enough,&mdash;worse than the Fords. The
Fords&mdash;well, no doubt that would be a bitter pill!
But at least it was a thing which nobody would have
any business with,&mdash;a skeleton which could be comfortably
disposed of in the cupboard at home. Better
that a thousand times than the other. He repeated
this to himself again and again, or rather it turned
over and over in his mind, giving him the most curious
justification in everything he was doing. He had
struggled before as against a thing that had no excuse,
but now he had found one; now it seemed to
him of two possibilities the better one,&mdash;far better
for himself, for the race, and the name.</p>

<p>The spring night was very sweet. There were
great bushes of hawthorn here and there, gleaming

<!-- page 211 -->

whitely through the faint half light, filling the air
with their fragrance. He wandered from point to
point, half guided by those trees, taking much the
same course that Stephen had done. It was a fortnight
later, and the moon, which had been then
young, was now on the wane and rose late. That was
one element of enchantment withdrawn; and Roger,
though much more apt to regard things poetically
than his brother, was not doing so to-night. He did
not think of the sweetness of the evening, scarcely
even of her sweetness who was drawing him towards
the place where she was. It was, he would have said,
the serious, the practical part of the question that occupied
him now. He had not any love meeting to
look forward to, as Stephen had; no feeling of triumph,
no excitement of the senses, was in him. He
was going over the matter, as he thought, coolly, balancing
the advantages and disadvantages, and for the
first time seeing all that was to be said on the favorable
side. He was hardly aware, even, that all this
time he was coming nearer and nearer to Lily. He
had not had any thought, when he set out, of seeing
her that night.</p>

<p>When he saw something moving among the trees,
not far from the West Lodge, Roger was startled, almost
alarmed. He went towards the thing by instinct,
saying to himself, however, that it must be one
of the servants, or perhaps some passing villager, not
aware that this was not the permitted way. He was
in the clothes he had worn at dinner, and, like Stephen,
the whiteness of his linen was like a moving
speck in the dark. He went on, quickening his pace,
he hardly knew why; going up to the spot where
somebody must be, partly with the instinct of proprietorship

<!-- page 212 -->

to warn off an intruder, partly with a less
defined feeling. Something indistinct separated itself
from the trees, as he went on, and turned towards
him. There was a little cry, a tremulous Oh! and a
sound like the flutter of a bird&mdash;and was it Lily,
with a quick movement, who came to meet him, as if
she had expected him, as if she would have run to
him? He asked, with a sudden leap of his heart,
"Who is it? who is it?&mdash;Lily?"&mdash;making a rapid
step forward, so rapid that she was almost in his
arms. Then there was a quick recoil, a cry almost
wild, with a sharp note of wonder in it,&mdash;"Mr.
Roger!"&mdash;and he saw that it <i>was</i> Lily, but Lily
drawing back, startled and frightened; not ready, as
he had thought, for one moment of surprise, to fling
herself into his arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Roger," he said. "You thought it was&mdash;some
one else?"</p>

<p>"I was looking for&mdash;my father&mdash;he is late, and I
came out to look for him. Mother was a little
anxious." Lily was breathless with alarm or some
other feeling, and panted between the words&mdash;"and
we did not know, sir, that you had come home."</p>

<p>"You could not. I came on the impulse of the
moment, I scarcely know why."</p>

<p>"They say," said Lily, still panting a little, "that
it is very gay in London at this time of the year."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very gay. I am not fond of gayety.
The park here, and a young gentle creature, like you,
walking in it in the sweet evening, that is more delightful
to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger."</p>

<p>"You think I don't mean it, perhaps, but I do," said
Roger, feeling his own breath come a little quickly.

<!-- page 213 -->

"You suit the soft darkness of the evening, Lily.
It is like poetry, and so are you."</p>

<p>"I am only a poor girl, Mr. Roger," said Lily. It
was not a speech such as she was usually disposed to
make. She could not tell, indeed, by what impulse it
came from her. There was a little vexation in it, for
she could not help thinking, with a faint pang, that
Stephen had never said anything to her so pretty as
this. But then Stephen laughed at poetry: he was
superior to it.</p>

<p>"Poor or rich makes little difference that I know
of," said Roger, who also had struck a quite unusual
vein. "A true woman is always in her fit place."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to say so, Mr. Roger," exclaimed
Lily, rousing up to the occasion, "for there
are some people who don't think so well of us as
that: they scold poor mother for me, as if I were not
fit for my own home."</p>

<p>"I hope you will not be offended, Lily: but no one
can help seeing that the keeper's lodge is not the sort
of place from which one would expect you to come."</p>

<p>"It is my home, though," said the girl; and she
added tremulously, "Do you think, if I were in the
position of a lady, I wouldn't, I shouldn't&mdash;shame
those that put me there"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shame!" Roger cried, with indignation. It all
seemed to him very strange, as if he had walked into
some fairy place where there were no disguises, and
carried his breast uncovered, so that the throbbings
might be seen. "I cannot imagine any place," he
added gravely, "so beautiful or so refined that you
would not be in your place there."</p>

<p>Even in the uncertainty of twilight Roger saw the
blush of delight that covered the girl's face; but he
did not know that it was not for him.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>"Thank you," she said, "perhaps I'll never be anything
but what I am: but if I should ever be different,
I am glad to know that you don't think I'd bring
my&mdash;friends to shame."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" he said, "that can never have
anything to do with you."</p>

<p>Lily had gone on towards the lodge, and Roger
walked by her in a curious fascination, like that of a
dream. He had never expected nor planned to have
this interview. He was not even prepared for anything
it might lead to. He had never talked to her
before in the freedom of complete solitude, with no
one near them to interrupt. If he had ever seen
her alone, it had been but for a few minutes, with
Mrs. Ford always ready to come in. But the effect
of finding himself thus with her bewildered rather
than encouraged him. He had let the first overflowings
of his heart have vent, which might be mere
vague compliment, and no more. But her presence
in the midst of this stillness, the sensation as if they
two were all alone in the world, no one near them,
was for the present as much as his mind could take
in. He was prepared for nothing more. The silence
was so long that at last Lily herself spoke.</p>

<p>"It's very sweet," she said, "to have the park to
walk in. It's beautiful in the evenings. There has
been a moon, but now it is on the wane, and does
not rise till late."</p>

<p>"Is this where you walk always,&mdash;not down to
the village?"</p>

<p>"The village!&mdash;oh, no! What should I do in
the village? I have no friends there. It is hard
upon a girl when she has got a better education, and
cannot move in the class she belongs to, Mr. Roger.

<!-- page 215 -->

They don't like me for that; and they're so different,
I don't care for them."</p>

<p>"You can have nothing in common with them,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No," assented Lily. "I should like to be with
the ladies and gentlemen: but they would have nothing
to say to me."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Lily. That is not the case,
at least so far as&mdash;some are concerned. Women,
people say, are jealous. But on the other hand"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Roger," said Lily, "I know there
are gentlemen who are pleased to come and talk.
They think it amusing to see me in my father's cottage.
But I hope you don't suppose that's what I
care for. I think more of myself than that."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he cried, "with all my
heart. I hope you don't imagine I could ever mean&mdash;Lily,
you don't know with what reverence I think
of you. I have been among women who are not fit
to tie your shoes; and to think of you has kept me
from despising my fellow-creatures and growing bitter
and hard. You don't know what it does for a man
to remember a girl so spotless and sweet as you."</p>

<p>Lily was frightened by the meaning of his voice,
the earnestness with which he spoke, and the fine
words, finer than anything that had ever been said
to her before. And she reflected that to have two
brothers making love to her would be very strange,
that it would scarcely be right. She hastened her
steps a little over the soft undulations of the turf.</p>

<p>"You are too kind, Mr. Roger," she said. "If
you knew me better, you would not perhaps think so
well of me. I am well enough, but I am not so
good as that."</p>

<!-- page 216 -->

<p>"It is not a question of thinking well or ill," exclaimed
Roger, with the strange sensation going
through all his being that fate had got hold of him;
that the current against which he had been struggling,
sometimes so feebly, had at last got the better
of him, had swept him off his feet, and was carrying
him away. "I have long ceased to think so far
as you are concerned. I can only feel that you have
been a new life to me since ever I first saw you. I
have fought against it&mdash;I will not conceal that from
you&mdash;and tried hard. Lily, I wonder if you ever
thought of me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Roger," she said tremulously, walking
on faster; though in her agitation she kept
stumbling as she went. "We all thought you very
kind. It has been very good of you, coming to the
lodge. It is getting late, and I must hurry home.
Perhaps father has got in the other way."</p>

<p>"Lily, stop a moment: kind was not what I
meant. Kind!&mdash;it is you who must be kind to me,
Lily. Don't you really know what I mean?" he
asked, touching her arm with his hand. "I want
you to be my wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger!" cried Lily, moving suddenly
away from him with a voice and gesture of horror.
She said to herself in her fright, her heart almost
standing still for a moment, then leaping up again
in a very frenzy of excitement, that it was like being
courted by a brother. Should she tell him? How
could she answer him? And she engaged to Stephen!
She had never felt so terrified&mdash;so overwhelmed, in
her life.</p>

<p>"You are frightened," Roger said. "Why are
you frightened? Don't think of anything but ourselves,

<!-- page 217 -->

Lily. Be selfish for a moment, if you can
be selfish. Everything will come right afterwards
for the others, if it is right between you and me."</p>

<p>"For the others?" she repeated, faltering, gazing
at him with large and tearful eyes through the
dimness of the night.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he cried impatiently. "You are
thinking of your father and of my father. All that
will come right. Lily, you must have known: I have
not taken you by surprise. Will you? will you?
My Lily! Words cannot say what is in my heart
for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger," she exclaimed, again putting up
her hands between them, "don't, please don't talk so!
I mustn't listen to you. It makes me feel as if I
were&mdash;not a proper girl. Mr. Roger, oh, for everybody's
sake, go away, go away."</p>

<p>"For everybody's sake?" he said, the moisture
coming to his eyes. "Is that what they have put into
your dear mind, that you must not listen to me, for
everybody's sake? But, my dearest, if I answer for
it that nobody shall come to harm, if I tell you that
all shall be well? Surely you may trust me that
nobody shall come to harm."</p>

<p>She made no reply, but hurried along, stumbling
over the inequalities in her path, with her head
averted a little and horror in her heart. "Stephen!
Stephen!" she said to herself; but she dared not
utter his name. What would Stephen think if he
heard his brother thus offering her himself and all
he had? In the shock of fancied guilt, Lily could
not realize what was the offer that was being made.
The heir of Melcombe and all that he had! Her
brain was not even touched by the magnificence of

<!-- page 218 -->

the conquest. Perhaps she had not yet time to realize
it. She was eager for the shelter of the cottage,
eager to get away from him, terrified to betray herself,
still more terrified lest she should do or say something
that would make Stephen angry: his brother,
which was the same as her own brother,&mdash;something
too horrible to think of! He went on speaking, she
scarcely heard what, as he hurried on beside her;
begging her to pause, to think; telling her he would
wait for his answer, that he saw she was beside herself
with fear. "But why? why?" Roger cried.
"My sweet Lily, do you think I would risk your
father's living? Do you think I would do him harm?
If my father even should stand in our way, do you
think I wouldn't keep <i>him</i> from suffering? Hear
reason, dearest, hear reason!" He was out of
breath, and so was Lily. She only cried, "Oh, Mr.
Roger!" as she hastened on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford stood at her garden gate looking out for
Lily, and saw with wonder and a shock at her heart
the figure which accompanied her child, clearly a gentleman,
with his white shirt front, otherwise indistinguishable
in the night. Her first thought was that
some one was insulting Lily.</p>

<p>"I'm here, dear, I'm here; you're all right,
you're close at home!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, it's Mr. Roger!" cried Lily in reply;
but she did not pause as if her mother's presence
reassured her. "Good-night, sir," she said, and
ran in. And in the stillness of the place the lover
and the mother, facing each other in the dark, could
hear her footsteps climbing hurriedly up the narrow,
steep staircase till she reached her room, in which
sanctuary both sight and sound of her disappeared.</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>Mrs. Ford and Roger were left standing, confronting
one another, and the position was not without
its disagreeable side. Mrs. Ford looked at
Roger, and her fingers began to fumble with her
apron. Fear for her daughter, uneasiness in the
presence of her master's son, whom she was so unwilling
to offend, took all assurance from her tone.
And yet, if any wrong had been done to her child&mdash;"Mr.
Roger," she said, trembling, "you have
given my Lily a fright."</p>

<p>"It appears so. Mrs. Ford, I hope you will stand
my friend and bring her to hear reason. It must be
Ford and my father she is thinking of. No harm
shall come to Ford. I have asked her to be my
wife."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford gave a shriek which echoed out into
the stillness among the trees. "Oh! good Lord!&mdash;Mr.
Roger!" she cried.</p>

<p>THERE is at once something very exciting and
strangely calming in having at last carried out an
intention long brooding in the mind. The thrill of
the real and actual through all the veins is suddenly
met and hushed in the awe of the accomplished.
And all the hundred questions which had
been distracting the spirit,&mdash;shall I? shall I not?
shall it be now? soon? a lifetime hence? will it be
for good? will it be for evil?&mdash;all these doubts, uncertainties,
peradventures, cease and disappear, leaving
a curious vacancy and awe of silence in the soul.
No need for them any longer; no room for further
debate. Whether it ought to have been now or never,
whether it was for good or evil, it is done, done, and
never can be undone. Perhaps to the most happy
such a crisis is something of a shock, and in the midst
of rapture even a regret may breathe, for the time
when everything was still wrapped in the mists of uncertainty,
everything possible, nothing accomplished.
Probably, even in such a matter as a declaration of
love, the fact is always less delightful than the anticipation.
Fancy alone is high fantastical; the imagination
which gives us so many of our highest pleasures
is exigent. A look, a touch, the inflection of a tone,
may offend its overwrought expectations, and reality
can never be so wholly sweet as the pictures it has
drawn.</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>Far more than in ordinary cases was this the case
with Roger. The melting of modest half-reluctance
of which he had dreamed; the shy, sweet wonder of
the girl to whom he was opening (how could he help
knowing that?) gates as of heaven; the pause of
delicate hesitation, doubt, alarm, all of which his
love would have so amply cleared away,&mdash;these were
not what he had encountered. His suit had been
received with an appearance of terror very different
from that veiled and tremulous happiness which he
had imagined to himself. She had been not shy, not
trembling only, but afraid, in a panic of real terror,
anxious to escape from him; too much terrified to
hear what he had to say. To be sure, he felt himself
able to account for this, in a way which exalted
and ennobled Lily, since it was her utter unselfishness,
her preference of her father's interests and of
his, Roger's interests, to her own, her determination
to allow no quarrel on her account, no family break-up,
no endangerment of others, which had made her
receive him so strangely. But yet it had been a disappointment.
He had not, indeed, allowed his imagination
to dwell on that scene; other questions, far
more dark and tragic, had kept him from such lover's
dreams; but yet by turns, in the pauses of his anxious
thoughts, there had gleamed upon him a sudden
picture of how that gentle heart would understand
his, of the struggle in Lily's transparent countenance,
the spring of delight, the pause of soft alarm. He
had seen these things by a side glance. But the
picture had not been realized.</p>

<p>This was the first sensation. Then followed others
more personal. He had done this thing over which
he had hesitated for months, which he had recognized

<!-- page 222 -->

as a revolution in his life, full of terrible, perhaps
tragical, consequences. He had foreseen all these,
both great and little, from his own banishment from
his father's house (which did not seem a very real
danger) to the more horrible certainty of the close
ties which would be established between him and the
Fords, the place they would have a right to in his
household, the gamekeeper father, the homely drudge
of a woman, who would be brought so near him. All
this he put behind his back now with disdain. What
he had done he had done, and nothing could undo it.
He raised his hand unconsciously as he hurried across
the park, waving all these spectres away. He had accepted
them, and their power was gone. He thought
of them no more.</p>

<p>A kind of exaltation came into his mind as he went
home. To have done it after all was much, to have
got out of the region of conflict and doubt. Strange
to think that he had been wasting his strength in
futile conflicts only this morning; that yesterday he
had been struggling in those nets of society which
he loathed, and had almost believed of himself that he
never would have done this thing, which now it was
as certain he must have done as if it had been planned
amid all the counsels of the spheres. And who should
say it had not been so planned? When the great
crises of our life arrive, we are seldom unwilling to
recognize that there is something providential in the
way they come about; or at least, if we are very advanced
and superior, to smile upon the weaker sweet
imagination which seems to have some fanciful justification
for thinking that Heaven itself might have
taken that trouble. For how can there be a greater
thing than the bringing together of two human creatures,

<!-- page 223 -->

from whom a greater and a greater life may
spring, until the race touches again the spheres?
Marriages, the simple say, are made in heaven. They
are fit things to be made in heaven: not the marriages
"arranged" in society, with so much blood and beauty
on the one side, and so much money on the other, or
between two great estates which would naturally come
together, or for any other horrible devil's reason, not
Heaven's; but between two genuine human creatures,
man and maid, between the primeval Two, the pair
on whom all life is founded and all society. Roger
was not, perhaps, a man of poetical thought in general,
but the mind which usually thinks in prose will
sometimes strike a higher note of poetry in exceptional
elevation and excitement than the more poetically
disposed. Then he thought of the fast women,
the girls like Geraldine and Amy, and of the contrast
between the noisy racket of that unlovely life and the
beautiful tranquil existence of the true woman, working
all day under a humble, quiet roof, walking in her
sweetness among all other sweet and tender influences
in the soft May evening, amid the dews and balmy
odors of the park. How different, he thought with a
certain glorying in his own apparent unsuccess (which
he did not believe, would not believe, was real), how
still more different would have been the reception of
his suit in that other world, the great world, where he
was known as an excellent <i>parti</i>, the heir to a good
estate! There would have been no hesitation about
the girl he had chosen; the parents would have accepted
him with open arms. Lily's panic was sweet
in comparison,&mdash;how sweet! To her it was the obstacle
that he should be the heir of Melcombe. How
different! This thought carried his soul away, floating
upon waves of immeasurable content.</p>

<!-- page 224 -->

<p>He had reached the house before he was aware, going
quickly in the abstraction of his mind. It stood solid
in the summer dark, a big shadow softly rounded off
by the surrounding trees; the great cedar on the lawn
like a tower, more substantial even in its blackness of
shadow than the human house with its flickers of
light at the windows. He came to it upon the garden
side, where were the long row of projecting windows.
In Nina's, which formed one of the drawing-room
bays, there was a light, and he saw her little face appear,
suddenly pressed against the glass, peering out
at the sound of his footstep on the gravel. A more
subdued light, that of his father's shaded lamp, shone
from the corresponding window of the library. Did
his father rise too at the sound of his step, or was
it only his imagination that suggested a stir within?
He had passed these lights, and was making his way
round to the door which he could see was open, showing
the colored lamp in the hall and a glow of variegated
light upon the black oak carvings, when he
heard himself sharply called from a little distance beyond.
It was the Squire's voice. Roger felt in a moment
that all that had gone before was as child's play,
and that now the great crisis of his life had come.
He went forward slowly, and I will not say that his
heart did not beat louder. He was a man fully matured,
not one to tremble before a father; and yet
there went through him a thrill of something like
alarm,&mdash;a thrill which did not mean fear, nor any
disposition to yield to his father the arbitration of his
fate, yet which was a summoning of all his energies
to meet a danger which he had foreseen without ever
expecting it, and which far sooner than he had supposed
was to settle and decide the future tenor of his
life.</p>

<!-- page 225 -->

<p>"Roger, is it you? I might have known. What
do you mean, bursting in at the windows and scaring
poor little Nina? Nobody shall do that in my
house."</p>

<p>"Has Nina said so?" asked Roger sharply. "I
came in at no window, sir. When you called me I
was making my way to the door."</p>

<p>The Squire paused, and looked at his son as a bull
might look, with his head down before charging. "It
doesn't matter," he said, "door or window. Where
have you been, sir?&mdash;that's the question. Only a
few hours at home, and here's somebody who must
receive a visit, who can't be put off,&mdash;the first night!
Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Where have I been? Surely I am not a child,
sir, to be questioned in that way"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, you're not a child, more's the pity. A child
can do no harm but to himself. You&mdash;can disgrace
your family and everybody belonging to you. Where
have you been, sir, to-night?"</p>

<p>"I have been," said Roger, with a strong effort at
self-control, "in the park. When you think of it,
you will see that a man of my age cannot be asked
such questions. Let the night pass, father. If you
have anything to ask that I can answer, let it be to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It shall be to-night!" cried the Squire, with foam
flying from his lips. "And you shall answer what
questions I choose to ask, or else I will know the
reason why. In the park? I know where you have
been, you poor fool. You have been at the West
Lodge!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir: and what then?" said Roger, the
blood coursing back upon his heart, all his forces

<!-- page 226 -->

rallying to meet the attack. It subdued his excitement
and made him calm. He stood firmly looking
in his father's face, which he could scarcely see, except
that it was infuriated and red. And there was a
moment of silence,&mdash;dead silence,&mdash;into which the
stirrings of the night outside and the movements of
the house came strangely.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Mitford was speechless with
rage and consternation. Then he turned and walked
quickly into the house, waving to his son to follow
him. "We can't talk here. Come into my room."</p>

<p>The library was a large room lined with books, a
miscellaneous collection, abundant but not valuable,
in dingy old bindings, which made the walls dark.
One lamp, and that a shaded one, stood in a corner
on the table where Mr. Mitford read his newspapers.
This was the only light visible. The Squire went up
to it, and threw himself into his arm-chair. Roger
did not sit down. He stood with his hand upon the
table, which was in the light, but his face was in
shadow. This gave him a slight advantage over his
father, who was full in the light.</p>

<p>"You say 'What then?' " said Mr. Mitford, "and
you say it mighty coolly, as if it didn't matter. Let's
understand each other once for all. It's some time
now since you have set yourself to thwart my plans.
I was ready to settle everything for you, to make it
easy,&mdash;and you had the best of everything waiting
for you to pick up. By Jove, you were too well off,&mdash;that's
all about it. Well, what's come between you
and all this? Your mind's changed, and your ways.
Once you were all straight, doing very well, though
you were always a stubborn one. Now"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am still a stubborn one, I fear," Roger assented,
with an attempt at a smile.</p>

<!-- page 227 -->

<p>"None of your smiling!" cried the Squire. "It's
no smiling matter, I can tell you. What's the reason?
Confound you, sir," exclaimed the angry father,
the foam flying from his lips again, "do you think I
don't know what it is? A dressed-up, mincing milliner's
girl&mdash;a doll with a pretty face&mdash;a&mdash;a creature!
I've seen her, sir,&mdash;I've seen her. Ford's
daughter,&mdash;the keeper! That's what takes you
every night from home. And you come back from
low company like that to your sister's&mdash;and look me
in the face"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope," said Roger, pale and trembling with
passion, "I can look any man in the face. And as
for my sisters, any one of them, if they were half as
good as she of whom you speak"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Squire was purple: it was not much wonder,
perhaps. And he knew that was a bad thing for a
man of a full habit, like himself, and with one big
word to relieve his mind he forced himself into a sort
of calmness, resuming his seat from which he had
started. Losing one's temper does nobody any good.
He puffed forth a hot blast of angry breath, which relieved
him, and then he assumed what was intended
for a polished air of composure.</p>

<p>"Good! I see you have made up your mind.
May I ask what course you intend to adopt in respect
to this paragon? I suppose you've settled that
too?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Roger, "when a man loves a woman,
and she is free to marry him, there can be but one
course to adopt, so far as I am aware."</p>

<p>"Oh! so that is it: 'there can be but one course'!"
repeated the Squire, with that highly offensive attempt
to mimic his son's tone which was habitual to him.

<!-- page 228 -->

Then thundering, "You mean to <i>marry</i> the baggage,
sir, and bring her to this house, to your mother's
place!"</p>

<p>"She was my mother's favorite; she has been
trained upon my mother's plan," said Roger, with
white lips.</p>

<p>"Your mother's favorite&mdash;for a waiting-maid!
Trained upon your mother's plan&mdash;to cut out aprons
and sew them! Is that what you want her for? But
let me tell you, sir, that girl shall never sit in your
mother's place,&mdash;never, if there was not a woman
but herself in the world; never, if&mdash;&mdash; What is the
use of wasting words? If you mean to make such a
disgraceful match, you had better count the cost first,
which is&mdash;Melcombe in the first place, and your supposed
position here. The land shall go to your
brother; I withdraw your allowance. Love is a fine
thing, isn't it? Go and live upon it, and see how
you like it then."</p>

<p>"Father," gasped Roger; he felt it necessary to control
his own passion, and caught at the word to remind
himself of a bond that could not be ignored.</p>

<p>"It is of no use appealing to me. You think I have
been uttering vain threats and have meant nothing;
but by Jove, you shall find out the difference. I've
not been a pedant," cried the Squire, "nor a prude,"&mdash;they
were the first words that occurred to him.
"I've paid your debts, and put up with&mdash;many
things no father approves of."</p>

<p>"You must think, sir, that you are speaking to
Stephen, and not to me."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir!" thundered the Squire.
"I know what I am saying and who I am speaking to.
Stephen may be a fool, but not so great a fool as you

<!-- page 229 -->

are. He would not throw away his living and his
place in the world for any woman. Look here! either
you give up this business at once, this very night (I'll
pack the whole brood away to-morrow, out of your
road), and settle down and marry as you ought, and
do your duty by your family, or&mdash;good-by!" cried
the Squire, angrily, kissing the tips of his fingers,&mdash;"good-by!
Take your own way; it's to be hoped
you'll find it a wise one. As for me, I've nothing
more to say."</p>

<p>"Father," exclaimed Roger again. The shock, for
it was a shock, calmed him once more. There had
been no very cordial relations in the family, perhaps,
but never a breach. And his home exercised that
charm over him which an ancestral home does over
most Englishmen. The disinheritance did not strike
him as anything real, but the severance had a horrible
sound; it daunted him in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"I will listen to no appeal," said the Squire.
"You think you can touch my heart by that 'father'
of yours. Pshaw! you're not a baby; you know
what you're about as well as I do. We're both men,
no such wonderful difference. I'll have no false sentiment.
Do what I require, or if you take your own
way, understand that Melcombe will never be yours.
I may settle some trifle on you for charity, but Melcombe"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"In that case, sir," said Roger, slowly and stiffly,
"words are useless, as you say. I can't take your
way in what's life or death to me. Melcombe&mdash;can&mdash;have
nothing to do with it so far as I am concerned.
It is yours not mine, to dispose of. And as
for charity"&mdash;&mdash; His hand clenched upon the table,
showing all the veins; but his face, which was white

<!-- page 230 -->

to the lips, was in the shadow, out of which his voice
came tuneless and hard, with pauses to moisten his
throat. It stopped at last from that cause, his mouth
being parched with agitation and passion, on the word
"charity," which, had he retained the power of expression,
would have been full of scorn: but he had
lost the power.</p>

<p>The door opened behind them at this crisis, and
Edmund came into the room. Edmund had been uneasy
all the evening, but his mind went no further
than uneasiness. He feared vaguely a quarrel between
his father and brother. He feared that Roger,
in his excited and uncertain state, would bear no interference,
but this was all. He came into the room
anxious, but scarcely alarmed, and took no fright
from the words he heard. "Charity,"&mdash;it had ended
thus, he thought, amicably, on some mild matter of
benevolence on which father and son were agreeing.
But this delusion lasted a moment, and no longer.</p>

<p>"Here, Ned," cried the Squire, "you're just in
time. Your brother thinks more of your interest than
his own. Your name goes down in the will to-morrow
in the place of his. Shake hands, old fellow; it's
you that are to have Melcombe. You are a bit of a
milksop, Ned, but never mind. Shake hands on it,
my boy."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" cried Edmund, hurrying
forward into the light. But Roger did not wait for
the explanation. He caught his brother's hand as he
passed him, and wrung it in his own; then hurried out
of the room, leaving the two others, the one at the
height of excitement, the other disturbed and wondering,
looking strangely into each other's eyes.</p>

</div>

<p>EDMUND and his father stood looking at each other,
as Roger's steps died away. They listened with a
curious unanimity, though the one was at the height
of unreasoning anger, and the other anxious and
alarmed,&mdash;as people listen to steps that are going
away forever. There seemed some spell in the sound.
Mr. Mitford was the first to break free from it. He
threw himself down in his chair, making it creak and
swing. "Well!" he cried, "there's heroics! And
now to business. You were surprised, I don't doubt,
at what I said just now, Ned. You thought I didn't
mean it. You thought, perhaps, I had said it before.
There you're wrong. If I said it before, it was but
a threat, a crack of the whip, don't you know, over
his head. I am in serious earnest now."</p>

<p>"About what, sir?" asked Edmund. "Pardon me
if I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You mean you won't understand," retorted the
Squire, who spoke with a puff of angry breath between
each phrase, panting with anger. "It is too
late for that sort of thing now. You had better give
me your attention seriously, without any quixotical
nonsense. I don't say it is wrong to consider your
brother. You've done so as much&mdash;more than he
or any one had a right to expect; but you're doing
no good, and that is a sort of thing that can't go on

<!-- page 232 -->

forever. You had better accept the position, and
think a little of yourself now."</p>

<p>"What is it, father? You would not, I am sure,
do anything hasty. Roger's not a prudent fellow, and
he has a hot temper. If he has done or said anything
that offends you, it was inadvertence, or carelessness,
or"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know very well what it was, without any of
your glosses. If you mean to say that it was not
with any intention of being cut out of my will in consequence,
I grant you that. Most likely he does not
believe I shall ever be aggravated to the point of cutting
him out of my will. What he wants is his own
way and my property too. Yes," said Mr. Mitford,
with a snort of hot breath, "that is what he intends,&mdash;it's
simple. But there's a limit to that as to everything
else, and I've reached that limit. I've been
coming to it for some time, and he's clenched it to-night.
I want to speak of yourself, not Roger. So
far as he's concerned, there's not another word to
say."</p>

<p>"He can't have <i>done</i> anything since he came home&mdash;if
it's only something foolish he has said"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Ned! There's not to be another
word on that subject, please!" with fierce politeness.
Then the Squire added with a snarl, "He's
asked Lily Ford to marry him,&mdash;or means to do so,&mdash;and
tells me she was his mother's favorite, and
therefore is fit to be put in his mother's place. By
Jove!" cried Mr. Mitford, puffing out once more
from his nostrils a hot blast, "and the fellow thinks
I'm to stand that! It's all quite settled; we may
take it quietly; there's nothing more to say. Now
comes your turn, Ned. You won't disgrace me in that

<!-- page 233 -->

sort of way, I know. You may sink into a corner and
do nothing at all,&mdash;that's likely enough,&mdash;but you
won't disgrace your family. Try and be something
more than negative, now you're at the head of it.
You're not the man your brother is, though, thank
Heaven, you're not the fool he is, either. Why, if
you put your best foot foremost&mdash;there is no telling&mdash;Lizzie
Travers might like you as well as Roger.
You could but try."</p>

<p>The Squire exhaled a part of his excitement in a
harsh laugh. It sounded coarse and unfeeling, but in
reality it was neither. It was anger, pain, emotion,
the lower elements heightened by something of that
irritation of natural affection which makes wrath itself
more wrathful. Edmund did not do justice to
his father. He was horrified and revolted by the supposed
jest, and had he given vent to his feelings he
would have made an indignant and angry reply; but
the thought that he was Roger's sole helper restrained
him. He must neither quarrel with his father, nor
even refuse these propositions, however horrible they
were to him, for Roger's sake.</p>

<p>"It would be very painful to me," he said gravely,
"to be put in my brother's place."</p>

<p>"What, with Lizzie Travers?" cried the Squire,
with another laugh. "Take heart, man. Women,
as often as not, prefer domestic fellows like you."</p>

<p>Edmund had a hard struggle with himself. He had
the sensitiveness of a man whose mind was touched
with the preliminaries of love, and in a semi-reverential
state to all women; and to hear one name thus
tossed about was almost more than he could bear.
But there was a great deal at stake, and he mastered
himself.</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>"You might leave me your heir, sir," he said, "but
you could not make me the head of the family. After
you, Roger is that, though he had not a penny. I am
very strong on primogeniture so far as that goes."</p>

<p>"Primogeniture is all humbug," said the Squire.
"If it were not that those Radical fellows are so hot
against it,&mdash;as if it could do anything to them!&mdash;I
should say myself it was a mistake. Let the father
choose the son that suits him to come after him. That's
what I say, and that's my case. As for the head of
the family, don't you trouble your mind, Ned. The
head of the family is the one who has the money.
You may take my word for that."</p>

<p>"And yet, sir," said Edmund quietly, "if I were
owner of Melcombe to-morrow, and had everything
you could give me, I should still be obliged to bear
the Mitford arms with a difference, to show I was not
the first in descent."</p>

<p>This statement made the Squire turn pale. It will
probably not impress the reader very profoundly, unless,
indeed, he belongs to an old county family, and
knows what such a misfortune is. For a moment it
took away Mr. Mitford's breath. He had not thought
of that. Roger landless, with full right to the ancient
coat; and Edmund rich and the proprietor of everything,
yet bearing a mark of cadency, his younger
son's difference! That was a bitter pill. He had not
thought of it, and therefore received the blow full on
his breast. The first effect it had was to make him
more and more angry with his eldest son.</p>

<p>"Confound the fellow!" he cried, with an earnestness
of objurgation which was more than wrath. Roger
was not only making his father angry, but giving him
occasion for serious thought. A mark of cadency!

<!-- page 235 -->

It was an idea for which the Squire was not prepared.</p>

<p>"And if what you foresee should happen," said Edmund,
with grave persistency, following out his line
of argument without raising his eyes, "if we should
marry and leave children behind us, there would be
the Mitfords who are the elder branch poor, and the
Mitfords who are"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop that!" cried the Squire; "if it is so, it
can't be helped. Do you think I'm going to let myself
be balked and all my plans frustrated by a trifle
like that? Let them be the elder branch, and
much good may it do them!&mdash;the children of Lily
Ford, my gamekeeper's grandsons! By Jove!" Mr.
Mitford felt himself grow purple again, and saw
sparks flying before his eyes: and he stopped, for he
knew it was not good for him to let excitement go so
far. To decide which of his sons should succeed him
was one thing; to open the way for him to receive his
inheritance at once was very different. He had not
the least intention of doing that. "It's quite
enough," he said, "for this time that you understand
and accept my settlement. I have had enough of it
for one night. To-morrow we'll have Pouncefort over
and settle everything. You can leave me now. Why
the deuce did you let the fellow come here?" he exclaimed,
with a sudden outburst, as Edmund turned
to leave the room.</p>

<p>"You may ask that, sir. It is my fault. I told
him I was coming, which I had no need to do."</p>

<p>"Need! I would as soon have told him to hang
himself. And what did <i>you</i> want here? Couldn't
you have stayed in town and kept him straight?
What is the good of you, if you can't do a thing like

<!-- page 236 -->

that?" The foam began to fly from the Squire's
mouth as the gust of irritation rose. "A younger
brother, sir, should have some feeling for the family.
He ought to be able to sacrifice a little to keep his
brother straight. Good Lord, what is the use of him
if it isn't that? And here you come vaporing to the
country for no reason, and tell him you are coming!
Tell him! For goodness' sake, why?"</p>

<p>"It was the act of a fool," said Edmund, with
bowed head.</p>

<p>"It was worse," cried the Squire. "It was the act
of Jacob, he that was the supplanter, don't you know,
that took his brother by the heel&mdash;it's all in the
Bible. It's your fault, and it will be to your advantage:
that's the way of the world. Oh, I don't suppose
you thought of that,&mdash;you're not clever enough;
but I should, in your position. I should have seen
what people would say. You'll get the land and the
lady, while Roger, my poor Roger"&mdash;&mdash; And here the
Squire broke down. Who could doubt that to cast
off his eldest son was a misery even to this high-tempered
and imperious man? Roger was lost to
him,&mdash;there was no going back upon the decision;
but still a man might rage at the things and chances
which had turned his son aside from the right way.</p>

<p>"Father, for God's sake, let things be as they
are!" cried Edmund. "Do you suppose I would take
Roger's inheritance from him? When you think of
it you will relent; and I, for my part, could only
accept as his trustee, as his representative, to frighten
him, since you think proper to do so, but to restore"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Squire looked up, suddenly brought to himself
by this unguarded speech. His momentary emotion

<!-- page 237 -->

had blown off, and the watchfulness of the man determined
to have his own way, and to permit no one
to interfere, started up in full force. "Oh!" he said,
"so that's it. Your compliance seemed a little too
gracious. You're not so ready to humor me in a
usual way. So that's it! I might have known there
was something underhand."</p>

<p>Anger flamed up on Edmund's cheek; but he restrained
himself once more. If he let himself go
and joined Roger in his banishment, who would there
be to make any stand for the disinherited? Stephen?
He did not trust Stephen. He said gravely, "I do
not suppose you mean, in this respect at least, what
you say. I have never, that I know of, done anything
underhand."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps that was strong," said the Squire.
"I don't know that you have, Ned; but I'll have
nothing of the kind here. I hope Pouncefort knows
his business. If you're to be my heir, you shall be
so, not merely a screen for Roger. Go away now.
I'm excited, which, if I had any sense, I shouldn't
be. One lets one's self get excited over one's children,
who don't care two straws what happens to one.
That is the truth. You are interested about your
brother: but as for me, who have brought you up and
cared for you all your life"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Squire's voice took a pathetic tone. He really
felt a little emotion, and he was not in the way of using
histrionic methods: but yet everybody does this at
one time or another, and he was not unwilling to make
his son believe that he felt it a great deal.</p>

<p>And Edmund was aware of both phases. He knew
that his father was not without heart. He was even
sorry for him in the present complication of affairs:

<!-- page 238 -->

but it went against him to fall into the pathos which
was suggested, and make any pretty speech about Mr.
Mitford's devotion to his children and the manner in
which they repaid it. He stood still for a moment,
silent, making no response, feeling to himself like an
impersonation of the undutiful and ungrateful. What
could he say? Nothing that would not be at least
partially fictitious, as had been the appeal.</p>

<p>"I think I will take myself off, sir," he said, "as
you tell me. To-morrow we shall all know better,
perhaps, what we are about. I am very much taken
by surprise. I never for a moment supposed that, in
earnest, you meant to disinherit your eldest son."</p>

<p>"You thought I meant it in jest, then?" said the
Squire. "It's a nice thing to joke about, isn't it, a
man's eldest son? Well, go. I have had about enough
of this confounded business for one night."</p>

<p>He felt that his effort had failed, and he was
vexed to think that his voice had trembled, and that
he had really been touched by his own fatherly devotion,
and in vain; but that soon went out of his head
when his son had left him, and he sat alone surveying
all the circumstances at his leisure in the quiet
which solitude gives. He leaned his head upon his
hands, and stared at the light, which came with
so much additional force from under the shade of
the lamp. He was not a happy father, it was true.
His children had gone against him,&mdash;Roger violently,
Edmund with a silent disapproval which was
very trying to bear, Stephen with the careless insolence
of a young man who knows the world much
better than his father does. Even the girls paid no
attention to his wishes. The elder ones were fast
young women about town, which was a thing he detested;

<!-- page 239 -->

and Nina was a little gossip, no better than a
waiting-maid at home. These things all came to the
Squire's mind in this moment which he passed alone.
He had done a great deal for them all, especially for
the boys, and this was how they repaid him. He protested
in his own mind against it all,&mdash;against their
indifference, their carelessness, their superiority to his
opinion. That was what a man got for taking a little
trouble, for trying to make a home for his family, for
giving up all pleasure outside of his own house. It
was rather a fine, disinterested, noble-minded picture
he made of himself. It looked very well, he thought
unconsciously. He might have married again; he
might have spent his time at race meetings, or gone
into society, or amused himself in a great many ways;
but instead he had lived at home, and brought up his
children, and devoted himself to them. It was a fine
thing to have done. He had been comparatively
young when their mother died, and she, poor thing,
had gone early. But he had never given her a successor,
as he might have done; he had never abandoned
her children: and this was how they rewarded
him,&mdash;to propose to put Lily Ford in their mother's
place; to pretend to accept his favor in order to give
it back to Roger, whom it was his intention to disinherit;
to go against him, cross him, show how little
they cared for him in every way!</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford was not softened by his reflections;
after that touch of pathos and admiring self-pity, he
worked himself up into anger again. They might
think to get the better of him, but they should not.
They were all in his power, whatever they might
think. He was not bound to give them a farthing,
any one of them. He might marry again, for that

<!-- page 240 -->

matter, and have heirs who would be perfectly docile,
who would never set up their will against his. By
Jove! and that was what he would do, if they did
not mind. Who could say that even Lizzie Travers
herself might not think a man of sixty-five, hale and
hearty, a man who knew the world, as good as any
one of the young fellows that did not know a fine
woman when they saw her? She was not in her
first youth, after all,&mdash;not what you could call a girl.
She was twenty-five. The Squire said to himself that
he might do a great deal worse, and that she might do
a great deal worse. This gleamed across his mind for
a moment with a triumphant sense of the universal
discomfiture which he might thus create all around.
But, to do him justice, it was not such a suggestion
as found natural root in his mind; and presently he
returned to the practical question. To disinherit
Roger, yet leave the next heir free to reinstate him,
was, of course, out of the question. The Squire drew
his blotting-book towards him, and began to write
out his instructions to Pouncefort. He was not at
any time a bad man of business, and the excitement
in his mind seemed to clear every faculty. He who
had prided himself so on his freedom from all bonds
of entail or other restrictions upon his testamentary
rights began, with a grim smile upon his face, to invent
restrictions for his successor. He tore up several
copies of the document before he satisfied himself at
last; and as he went on, getting more and more determined
that his son should have no will in the
matter, the Squire finally decided upon conditions by
which Edmund was to be tied up harder than any
tenant for life had ever been before him, with the
most minute stipulations as to who was to succeed

<!-- page 241 -->

him,&mdash;his own children first, then Stephen and
his children, then the girls,&mdash;not a loophole left
for Roger, nor for any arrangement with Roger. The
Squire perhaps saw the humor of this, when he read
the paper over and shut it into his drawer before
going to bed; for there was a smile upon his face. Nevertheless,
he breathed out a long breath as he lighted
his candle, and said to himself, "He'll never be such
a confounded fool," as he went up-stairs to his own
room through the silence of the sleeping house.</p>

<p>XXII.</p>

<p class="small">A MIDNIGHT TALK.</p>

</div>

<p>THE house, however, was not so still as Mr. Mitford
supposed. It contained at least one room in which an
exciting act of the same family drama was being carried
on. The brothers had not met immediately after
Edmund had left his father: for a few hours they had
been alone, following each the thread of his own excited
and troublous thoughts. Roger had gone out to
calm the fever of his mind in the coolness and darkness
of the night. Edmund, hastening out of his
father's presence after his dismissal, had sunk into a
chair in the hall, where all was vacant, the night air
breathing in through the open door, the shadows of
the trees waving faintly, the leaves rustling. He had
thrown himself down there in the dark, where no one
could see him, to escape from the necessity of doing
or saying anything. As he sat there Nina's little
white figure came out from the drawing-room, peered
about with anxious curiosity, then vanished up-stairs;
and Larkins appeared, with a footman after him, to
shut up for the night. Edmund did not move while
they passed from one room to another, closing the
windows, letting down the bolts and bars. The jar
of these noises gave a kind of unwilling accompaniment
to his troubled mind. Then a quick step,
unsteady with passion and excitement, approached
rapidly and rang upon the pavement. "Is it you,

<!-- page 243 -->

Roger?" his brother said, rising out of the shadows.
Roger was in no mood to talk; he waved his hand as
if to put all interruption away, and hastened to his
room with an evident disinclination for any further
intercourse. But an hour or two later, when all was
still, Edmund, who had taken refuge in the mean time
in the billiard-room, which was the one room of the
house left alone by Larkins, always a refuge for the
young men,&mdash;their sulking-room when they were
indisposed for family society,&mdash;heard the door suddenly
open and his brother come in. The only light
in the room was from the lamp suspended over the
billiard-table, and throwing a vivid glow upon the
green cloth. The large bow-window at the end let
in a prospect of pale sky and waving branches. The
room was in an angle separated from the rest of the
house. Roger came in like a ghost, scarcely seen, and
threw himself upon a chair near the one which Edmund
had himself taken; and there they sat for
some time, stretching out their long limbs, extending,
as it were, their minds, racked with distracting
thoughts, with nothing to say to each other, and yet
so much; communicating a mutual <i>malaise</i>, misery,
difficulty, without a word said. They had a degree
of family likeness which made this mute meeting all
the more pathetic. They were antagonists in interests,
according to any vulgar estimate of the case.
The younger brother disapproved profoundly, miserably,
of what the elder had done. He felt the inappropriateness
of it, the folly of it, to the bottom of
his heart; and yet in this troubled chaos, where all
landmarks were disappearing and every established
law being abrogated, he was one with Roger, smarting
with him under the wounds given by his father's

<!-- page 244 -->

rage, and even moved (though he was so much against
it) by a sort of instinctive sympathy with that fatal
infatuation of foolish love.</p>

<p>They began to talk at last in monosyllables, which
dropped now and then into the silence with a question
and answer half expressed. "All settled, then?"&mdash;"Nothing
to be done?"&mdash;"All"&mdash;"Nothing."
Then another long pause. By degrees a few more
words came to Edmund's lips and a longer reply from
Roger's; then, the ice once fully broken, the brothers
settled into talk.</p>

<p>"Don't spoil your own life for me, Ned," said
Roger; "the die is cast for me. And in every way
it is better, when you come to think of it. I don't
say there is not reason in it, from his point of view.
I've never been blind to that side of the question.
I know that it might not be easy to reconcile everything&mdash;the
father and mother"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see that," exclaimed Edmund, "and yet it
makes no difference."</p>

<p>"I have always seen it," said Roger, almost fiercely:
"you know I have. I see everything. No! it makes
no difference,&mdash;rather the reverse."</p>

<p>"It pushes you on?"</p>

<p>"It pushes me on. Ned," he added, leaning forward,
"you don't know what it is to be caught in the
tide like this. Every disadvantage pushes me on: because
it is not what I may have dreamed&mdash;because,
God help us! there may be, even afterwards, things
to overcome"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Roger, for God's sake"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me," he said, holding up his hand.
"I'll quarrel with you, if you do,&mdash;though, Ned, old
fellow, Heaven knows I trust you and hold you closer

<!-- page 245 -->

than any other man in the world. Only don't touch
that subject. Yes," he went on dreamily, leaning
back in his chair again, "I don't disguise it from myself:
there may be things to overcome. We have
lived in very different spheres, we have different ways
of thinking, and all the associations and habits&mdash;I
scorn myself for thinking of them at all, but I overlook
nothing, I am as cool and cold as any calculating
machine"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And yet you sacrifice everything, you throw away
everything."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Roger again, "not a word. What
do I sacrifice,&mdash;the chance of marrying a woman like
my sisters? And suppose that there are differences
between her and me,&mdash;what are they? Conventionalities
on my side, things that mean nothing, mannerisms
to which we choose to attribute an importance;
to sit down in a certain way, to speak in a
certain tone, to observe certain ceremonies. What is
all that? Who would put these nothings in comparison
with a pure nature, a pure, sweet nature and a
good heart?"</p>

<p>To this Edmund made no reply. A self-pleading
so pitiful wanted none. The depths out of which
Roger spoke, a happy lover, feeling the world well
lost for the sake of the woman he loved, were too
dark and tragic to be fathomed by any sympathizer,
even a brother. And perhaps when Edmund did
speak it was still more dangerous ground upon which
he trod. "Are you sure"&mdash;he said, then paused,
feeling the insecurity of the soil.</p>

<p>"Am I sure&mdash;of what? That there is no further
question as to what I have done and mean to do?
Yes, quite sure."</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>"That was not what I meant to ask&mdash;and you
may be offended by my question; but it is serious
enough to risk your anger for. Are you sure that
she&mdash;loves you, Roger,&mdash;you who are giving up so
much for her?"</p>

<p>Roger did not reply at once, but when he did so
did it in haste, turning quickly upon his brother, as if
he had not allowed a minute to elapse before giving
him his answer. "Would you like her to have
thrown herself at my head, clutched at me as a good
<i>parti</i>, not to be let slip? That's what she would
have done if she had been a girl in society; but, fortunately
for me, she is not that."</p>

<p>"Forget the girls in society," said Edmund; "they
are not what you choose to think them, or at least I
don't believe it. But, Roger, there's no question so
important to you as this. Think how many inducements
there are for her besides love. I will say nothing
else,&mdash;I will allow that everything has gone too
far to be altered,&mdash;but only this: are you sure that
she shares your feelings? I don't want to bother you;
you know that."</p>

<p>"Am I so disagreeable?" demanded Roger, with a
laugh; "beside all the people she is likely to see, am
I so little worth considering? You pay me a poor
compliment, Ned. But of this I'm sure: if it is so,
she'll have nothing to say to me. You can comfort
yourself with that thought."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Edmund, hesitating; "but if
so, she will have great strength of mind. Roger, for
Heaven's sake, make sure. She has everything to
gain, and you have everything to lose"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's enough!" Roger rose impatiently, and
held out his hand to his brother. "You're a Job's

<!-- page 247 -->

comforter, Ned! I don't doubt you mean very well,
but this is not the way to encourage a man when he's&mdash;when
he's at a difficult point in life. Good-night,
old fellow! I know you wish me well. Don't spoil
your own chances for me, that's all."</p>

<p>"Good-night!" Edmund said; and he sat still in
the silent room after his brother had left him, thinking
over this new danger,&mdash;that Roger might give
up everything he had in the world for the sake of a
girl to whom he was merely the means of rising, a
fine match, a gentleman elevating her out of her own
small sphere. Love! how could it be love? What
did she know of him to make love possible? It might
even be that it was a hard thing to expect from such
a girl indifference to the advantages which Roger
could offer her: she would be flattered, she would be
dazzled, she would see herself in a moment placed
high above all her equals. Neither she nor her parents
would believe in Roger's disinheritance; and he,
with this fatal passion in him, this fate which he had
not been able to resist, would barter away his heart
and his life&mdash;for what?&mdash;for the privilege of making
Lily Ford a lady; not to win love and all its compensations,
but to serve as a stepping-stone to the
ambition of an artificially trained girl. The tragedy
deepened as he thought it all over, sitting alone, feeling
the chill of the night steal upon him in the silent
house. Oh, what a mystery is life, with all its mistakes
and tragic blunderings! What fatal darkness
all about us, until all illumination is too late! It is
the spectator, people say, who sees the game, not those
whose whole fortune is staked upon it. But in this
case it was not even so; the gamester, who had put
his all upon the touch to win or to lose, saw too,&mdash;was

<!-- page 248 -->

aware of the ruin that might be before him, the
wasted sacrifice, the spoiled life,&mdash;and yet would
neither pause nor think. Perhaps it is the tender-hearted
looker-on, in such circumstances, who has the
worst of it. He has none of the compensations.
Even the excitement which is sometimes so tragic is
sometimes also rapturous for the chief actor: but the
sympathizer can never get its realities out of his eyes;
they overshadow everything, even the hope, which
might be a just one, that, after all was said, the soul
of goodness would vindicate itself even amid things
evil. For Roger there was still the chance that joy
might be the outcome; at all events, there was no
happiness for him except in this way. But Edmund
saw the evil and not the good, nor any good, however
things might turn.</p>

<p>XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">GOING AWAY.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Roger woke next morning, and opened his
eyes in the familiar room, and saw the peaceful sunshine
streaming in through that familiar window, as
he had done for the greater part of his life, it was not
for some minutes that he realized to himself all that
had happened,&mdash;all the difference there was between
this awakening and that of any other day. It flashed
upon him suddenly after a moment of wonder and
trouble,&mdash;a moment in which care confronted him,
awake before him, but with the mists of morning over
its face. What was it that had happened? Then
recollection came like a flood. He had declared himself
to Lily, his love-tale was told, he was hers whatever
might happen. All doubt or question was over
so far as that was concerned. A gleam of troubled
sunshine passed over his memory, a vision of her,
timid, shrinking, with that frightened cry, "Oh, Mr.
Roger!"&mdash;nothing more responsive; but what could
that be but her modest way, her shy panic at the passion
in him, her unselfish fears for her father? It
could be nothing more.</p>

<p>Then out of this sunshine, out of this transporting
certainty, his mind plunged into the darkness again.
He saw the dim library, the shaded lamp, his father,
furious, opposite to him, calling for the renunciation
of all his hopes. He raised himself slowly from his

<!-- page 250 -->

bed, and looked round him. All was so familiar and
so dear; it was home. There cannot be two homes
in this world: he had grown up here, he knew every
corner of it, and there was not a nook, out of doors or
in, that had not some association for Roger. As in a
vision he suddenly saw his mother standing just within
the door, shading the candle with her hand so that
the light should not fall on his eyes. He seemed to
see her, though it was so long since she had stood
there: fifteen years or more: and all this time he had
lived here, with short absences; coming back always
to the same place, always the chief person in the house
next to his father, knowing that all was his whatever
should happen. And now it was his no longer. To-day
was to be the last he should spend under the paternal
roof; to-day was the last day on which he could
call Melcombe his home: and up to this time there
had never been any doubt that he would be master of
all. It was not a thing that had ever been taken into
discussion or questioned. He was his father's eldest
son, the head of the family after him. What could
happen but that Roger should succeed his father?
He had no more wished for this as an advantage over
his brothers than he had wished for his father's death
in order that he might succeed. There was no reasoning
in it, no personal thought. It was the course of
nature, taken for granted as much as we take it for
granted that to-morrow's sun will shine.</p>

<p>Now the course of nature was stopped, and everything
that had been sure to be was turned aside and
would be no more. Bewilderment was the chief feeling
in Roger's mind; not pain so much as wonder, and
the difficulty of accepting what was incredible,&mdash;a
state not of excitement, still less of struggle, but of a

<!-- page 251 -->

certain dim consternation, incapacity to understand
or realize what nevertheless he knew to be true. He
knew it so well to be true and irresistible that, as he
dressed, he arranged in his mind how his few private
possessions were to be disposed of. Some of them he
would no longer have any use for,&mdash;his hunters, his
dog-cart, the many things which somehow had come
to be his, without either purchase or gift, the natural
property of the heir of the house. Were they his at
all? What was his? Almost nothing; a legacy his
godfather had left him, a little money he had at the
bank, the remains of the allowance he had from his
father; that, of course, would stop. He must find
work of some kind,&mdash;something which he could do,
enough to maintain himself&mdash;and his wife. His
wife! Good heavens! was it to poverty he was to
bring her? Instead of transporting her to the higher
sphere in which he had (O fool!) foreseen so many
difficulties, was he to give her only the dullness of
genteel poverty,&mdash;a poverty harder and less simple
than that to which she had been used? Was this
what it had come to? He thought for the first time
seriously of Edmund's question,&mdash;"Does she love
you?" She was not mercenary; no, not like the society
women. She would not count what he had or
weigh the advantages of marrying him, but&mdash;&mdash; The
question had become more serious even in the very
moment of being put. It might have been enough for
the future master of Melcombe to love his bride, whom
he could surround with everything her heart could desire.
But if Lily were to wed a man disinherited,
she must love him. The chill of that thought came
over him like a sudden storm-cloud. He had not
asked if she loved him. She was a timid, modest girl,

<!-- page 252 -->

who perhaps had never even thought of love. She
would love him <i>after</i>; she would come to love him:
he who could make her life like a fairy-tale, who could
change everything for her, realize her every dream,&mdash;what
could she do but love him? He had expected to
be the fairy prince to Lily, the giver of everything
that was delightful and sweet. He had never been exacting,
he had not expected from her a return which
he believed she was too innocent, too inexperienced, to
have thought of. It would almost have wounded the
delicacy of Roger's passion had she thrown herself into
his arms, and acknowledged that her heart had already
awakened and responded to the fervor of his. But
now the question was altogether changed. Now that
he had nothing to offer, nothing to give her, it was
necessary before she accepted the only remainder,
which was himself, that Lily's heart should have
spoken, that she should love him. He had not thought
of it in this light even when Edmund put the question
to him, nor had Edmund thought of it in that light:
but he saw it now.</p>

<p>The effect upon Roger of this thought was extraordinary.
Certainly he had not intended to carry
away from Ford's cottage an unwilling bride. He had
looked for a sweet consent, a gentle yielding to his
love, a growing wonder and enchantment and delight;
but now&mdash;&mdash; In spite of himself, a chill got into
Roger's veins. What had he to offer her? Poverty,
obscurity; an existence differing from that in which
she had been brought up in nothing except that it
would be far harder in its necessities than those of the
gamekeeper's cottage ever could have been. Acquiescence
would not do any longer. Lily must choose,
she must know what her own heart said. This change

<!-- page 253 -->

altered all possible relations between them at once.
She must take a woman's part, which, he said to himself
with a groan, she was not old enough nor experienced
enough to take, and judge for herself. It was
for her sake that he would be poor, but perhaps she
would be in the right if she refused his poverty. It
would have to be put to her, at least, and she must
decide for herself. The shifting scenes which surrounded
this resolution in Roger's imagination were
many and various. He imagined what he would say
to her, and half a dozen different ways in which she
might reply. She might put her hand in his and say,
"You need me more if you are to be poor;" or she
might whisper that it was he, and not his fortune, that
had ever moved her; or she might tell by nothing but
a smile, by nothing but tears, what her meaning was.
There were a hundred ways. Ah! if that were so, it
would be easy to say it; but if it were not so?</p>

<p>He set out with a very grave face, after the pretense
at breakfast which he had made alone, having waited
until the family had dispersed from that meal,&mdash;all
but Nina, who sat faithful by the urn, with large eyes
expanded by curiosity, watching all her brother's movements,
waiting till she had poured out his tea for
him. Roger did not even notice her watchful looks.
He had not an idea that she perused all the faces
at that table, one after another, and made them out.
But something more was going on than was within
Nina's ken: it was not enough, she knew, to conclude
that papa had been scolding the boys,&mdash;that was the
only way of putting it which she was accustomed to;
but by this time she was aware that it was more serious
than that. Roger's face, however, was all shut
and closed to her scrutiny; the upper lip firmly set
against the lower, the chin square, the eyes overcast.</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>"Will you have another cup of tea, Roger?" she
said.</p>

<p>"No, Nina, thanks."</p>

<p>"Won't you have something to eat, Roger? You
have had nothing. A gentleman can't breakfast on a
cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear; I have had all I want."</p>

<p>"Oh, Roger, I'm afraid you are not well. Oh,
Roger, do eat something before you go out."</p>

<p>Her voice was so much disturbed that he paused to
pat her upon the shoulder, as he passed her.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble about me, Nina. I have more to
think of than breakfast," Roger said. His tone was
more gentle than usual, his hand lingered tenderly
upon her shoulder. Nina got very quickly to her
window, when he had left the room; there was no
more occasion for keeping her place by the urn. She
watched till he came out from the other side of the
house and took his way across the park. To the West
Lodge again, and so early! It became clear to Nina
that something more must be involved than a scolding
from papa.</p>

<p>Roger had not the air of a happy lover; his face
was grave and pale and full of care. He went straight
across the park as the bird flies, not even perceiving
the obstacles in his way. It was a mode of progress
as different from the manner in which he used to approach
that centre of his thoughts, circling and circling
until, as if by accident, he found himself close to
the little humble place in which was his shrine,&mdash;as
different as the evening leisure, the soft nightfall,
when beasts and men were alike drawing homeward,
was to this morning hour of life and labor. Ford's
cottage was different, too; it was astir with morning

<!-- page 255 -->

sounds of work and the rude employments of every
day. One of the helpers about the Melcombe stables
was busy outside with something for the pheasants,
with half a dozen dogs following him wherever he
moved; and the sound of his heavy footsteps coming
and going, the rattle of the grain in the baskets, the
scuffling and occasional barking of the young dogs,
jarred upon Roger, whose first impulse was to order
the man away. But he remembered, with a half smile
which threw a strange light upon his face, that he
had no longer any authority here, and passed on to
the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford was busy with her domestic work within,&mdash;very
busy cleaning bright copper kettles and brass
candlesticks, which stood in a row upon the table and
made a great show; but though she seemed so hard at
work, it was probable that Mrs. Ford was not working
at all. Her honest face was disturbed with care.
She was red with trouble and anxiety. When she
curtsied to the young master, as he came in, the salutation
concealed a start which was not of surprise, but
rather acknowledged the coming of a crisis for which
she was on the outlook and prepared.</p>

<p>"I have come," said Roger, quickly, "to see Lily,
as you will understand; but I have also come, Mrs.
Ford, to see you. Where is Ford? I suppose you
told him what I said to you last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger!" cried Mrs. Ford, wiping her
hands in her apron, with another curtsy. "Oh, sir,
yes, I told him."</p>

<p>"Is he here? You must have known I should want
to come to an understanding at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! It's early, Mr. Roger&mdash;we never
thought&mdash;Ford's away in the woods; he wouldn't
bide from his work."</p>

<!-- page 256 -->

<p>"I suppose he told you his mind; of course you
know it well enough. Mrs. Ford, I've got something
more to tell you to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger," said Mrs. Ford, "don't, sir, don't
tell me no more! I've not got the strength for it.
Oh, don't tell me no more! We are that upset, Ford
and me, that we don't know what to think or what to
say."</p>

<p>"Am I not to be trusted, then?" asked Roger, with
a smile of conscious power, grave as he was. "Have
you higher views? No, I oughtn't to say that. Why
should you be so upset, Ford and you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger," she said again, "oh, when we
thinks how it would be&mdash;&mdash; What will the master say,
as has been a good master, taking one year with another,
ever since him and me was married,&mdash;what
would he say? He has a rough tongue when he's put
out of his way. He'd say as we'd inveigled you, and
set snares for you, and I don't know what. He'd
think this is what we've been aiming at first and last,
giving her her eddication for, and all that."</p>

<p>"You need not trouble yourself to think what he'll
say; he'll take no notice. We have had some words,
he and I, and I don't think he will interfere any
more. Where is Lily? I have much to say to her.
And as for you, my father will not be unjust to you."</p>

<p>He was turning along the narrow passage which led
to Lily's parlor, when Mrs. Ford caught him by the
arm. "Mr. Roger! Lily's not there."</p>

<p>"Not there? Where is she? I hope you don't
mean to interfere between her and me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, not <i>I</i> wouldn't," cried the keeper's
wife. "She's out somewhere; I don't know where.
She is just distracted, Mr. Roger. Speak of being

<!-- page 257 -->

upset, she's more upset than any one. Oh, wait a bit,
sir; don't go after her. She's distracted, Lily is.
All this morning she's been wringing her poor hands,
saying, 'What shall I do,&mdash;what shall I do?' She's
very feeling, too feeling for her own good. She takes
thought for us, and for you, and for every one afore
herself. I shouldn't wonder if she were to go and
hide herself somewhere. I don't know at this moment
where she is."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ford," said Roger, almost sternly, "I must
know the truth; is this because Lily does not&mdash;care
for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" exclaimed the woman, trembling, watching
him with furtive eyes: and then a small hysterical
sound, half cough, half sob, escaped her. "Mr.
Roger, is it possible she shouldn't be proud? A gentleman
like you&mdash;and stooping to our little place to
seek her out! Not but what my Lily is one as any
gentleman might"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he cried,&mdash;"yes, yes! There is no
question of that. The question is, Has she any answer
to give me? It is not because I am a gentleman, but
because I am a man, that I want my answer from
Lily. Does she want to avoid me? Am I not her
choice,&mdash;am I not"&mdash;&mdash; Roger paused and turned
to the door. "I must find her, wherever she is," he
added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford caught his arm again. "Oh, Mr. Roger,
she do find such places among the trees as nobody 'ud
ever think of. Oh, don't go after her, Mr. Roger!
Is it natural, sir, as she shouldn't give her 'eart to
you? Who has she ever seen but you? You're
the only gentleman&mdash;&mdash; Oh, sir, don't stop me like
that. My girl, she's a lady in her heart. Do you

<!-- page 258 -->

think she would ever look at the likes of them common
men? And she has never seen nobody but
you. It's not that. I understand what it is, Mr.
Roger, if you, that are young, don't understand. It's
turning everything wrong, everything upside down,
everybody out of their way, all for one young little
bit of a girl. She can't abear it. Her father and
me as will be turned out of house and home, and you
as will be put all wrong with the Squire, and everything
at sixes and sevens! Oh! I understand her&mdash;though
it mayn't be so easy for a young man like
you."</p>

<p>"As for Ford and you, I'll see to"&mdash;&mdash; Roger had
said so much before he recollected how powerless he
now was. He stopped short, then added hastily, "I
don't think you have any cause for fear, Mrs. Ford;
my father has done all he can. He will not trouble
himself with other matters. He has disinherited me.
It does not matter to him now what I do. Of course,
you have a right to know it; and I must see Lily;
I must speak to Lily; there must be no doubt upon
the subject now. She must look at it, and think of
it, and make up her own mind."</p>

<p>"Disinher&mdash;&mdash;" It was too big a word for Mrs.
Ford's mouth, but not for her understanding. She
gazed at Roger with round, wide-open eyes. "Oh,
sir, has he put you out,&mdash;has he put you out? and
all for our Lily!" She wrung her hands. "Oh,
but Mr. Roger, it's not too late. You mustn't let
that be. A girl may be both pretty and good, and
that's what my Lily is; but to be turned out of house
and home for her! Oh, no, no,&mdash;it's not too late,&mdash;it
mustn't be."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to be said on that subject,"

<!-- page 259 -->

said Roger, with a certain peremptory tone. "But
tell me where she is. Where is she? Why am I
kept from her? You understand that I am leaving
to-day, and that I must see her. To keep her
back is no kindness; it is rather cruelty. Let me
see her at once, Mrs. Ford."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roger!" she cried again, wringing her
hands, "you can go into the parlor and see for yourself.
She has been distracted-like in her mind since
last night. She's gone out, and I can't tell where
she is. Oh, sir, for all our sakes, make it up with the
Squire. Don't make a quarrel in the family; go back
to your father, Mr. Roger, and don't mind us no
more!"</p>

<p>A smile passed over his face at the strange futility
of the idea. As well suggest that the pillars of the
earth might be shaken, to make his seat more comfortable.
He waved it aside with a movement of his
hand.</p>

<p>"You will perceive that I must see her to-day. I
will come back before the time for the afternoon train.
Tell her&mdash;tell her to think it all over; and don't attempt
to come between us, for that is what cannot be
done now."</p>

<p>Was he almost glad in his heart to put off this
interview, although he was so anxious for it? There
are times when, with our hearts beating for the turn of
an event, Nature, sick with suspense yet terrified for
certainty, will with both her hands push it away.</p>

<p>XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">MR. MITFORD'S WILL.</p>

</div>

<p>ROGER left Melcombe by the afternoon train, to
which his brother accompanied him with feelings indescribable,
but no faith in anything that was happening.
It seemed to Edmund like a feverish dream,
which by and by must pass, leaving the world as it
was before. Roger was not very communicative as
to what he was going to do. Indeed, it would have
been difficult, for he had not any distinct plans. He
meant to get something he could work at, with a great
vagueness in his mind as to what that would be.
Something would be found, he had no doubt, though
what he was fit for, what he could do, it was still
more difficult, nay, almost impossible, to say; but
that was the least of his preoccupations. He was
sombre and downcast about matters which he did
not confide to his brother; saying, indeed, nothing
about the Fords, or Lily, or anything that went below
the surface of affairs. His father and he had
met at luncheon, but nothing had been said between
them. He left the house of his birth without a word
of farewell, without any sign on his own part or that
of others that he was doing more than going out for a
walk. Nina, who had gained an interest in his eyes,
he could not himself tell how, by dint of the anxious
curiosity in hers, which Roger, forlorn, took for affectionate
interest, received from him a kiss upon her

<!-- page 261 -->

cheek, a most unusual caress, which astonished her
greatly. "You are not going away, Roger?" she
said, scanning him all over with those keen eyes, seeing
no indication of a journey, no change in his dress,
yet suspecting something, she did not know what.
"Good-by, little Nina; be good, and take care of
yourself," said he. And these were all the adieux he
made.</p>

<p>When they reached the station, Edmund observed
that his brother glanced round him anxiously as if
looking for some one; but he did not say for whom
he looked. His last glance out of the carriage window
was still one of scrutiny; but it was evident that
he did not find what he was expecting, and it was with
an air of dissatisfaction and disappointment that he
threw himself back into his corner, not making any
response to Edmund, nor, indeed, seeing him as he
stood to watch the train go away. The station was
as little frequented as usual; one or two passengers,
who had been dropped by the train, dispersing; one
or two vacant bystanders turning their backs as the
momentary excitement died away; Edmund watching
the line of carriages disappear with a sensation of
sickness and confusion of faculties far more serious,
he said to himself, than could be called for. There
was nothing tragic in the matter, after all. Even if
Roger were disinherited, as his father threatened,
some provision must be made for him, and no doubt
there would be time for many changes of sentiment
before any disinheritance could be operative, the
Squire being a man full of strength and health,
more vigorous than any of his sons. What if
Roger did make an unsatisfactory marriage? Hundreds
of men had done that, and yet been little the

<!-- page 262 -->

worse. If a woman were pretty and pleasant, who
cared to inquire who her father was? Lily would no
doubt put on very readily the outside polish of society.
After all, there was nothing tragic about it; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Edmund, as was natural, strayed into the Rectory
on his way home, and, what was equally natural, unbosomed
himself to Pax, who had seen the brothers
pass, and who knew somehow, neither she herself nor
any one else knew how, that something was wrong at
Melcombe. "My father speaks very big, but of
course he will never do it," Edmund said.</p>

<p>"I would not be too sure of that. He may sometimes
say more than he means to carry out, but when
he is set at defiance like this"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pax, you go in too much for the authorities. A
man over thirty may surely choose a wife for himself."</p>

<p>"He should choose for his father too, when he is
the eldest son," said Pax. "Don't talk to me. It's
all an unnatural system, if you like. I don't mind
what you say on that subject; but granting the system,
it's clear to me what must follow. If you're to
carry on a family, you must carry it on. It's quite
a different thing when you live an independent life.
The predestined heir can never be an independent
man."</p>

<p>"That is not the opinion of the world," returned
Edmund, with a smile.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion, and I don't think I'm a fool.
Now you are free to please yourself. You might
marry Lily Ford and welcome. No one has any right
to interfere with you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Edmund; "my tastes don't lie
that way."</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>"No," answered Pax; "you might, and won't;
and Roger ought not, but does. That is the way always.
I blame him very much, though I'm sorry for
him. She is not worth it. There are some women
who are, though. If Lizzie Travers had not a shilling,
she would be worth it. She's a fortune in herself."</p>

<p>"Why bring in her name?" said Edmund; "though
I don't doubt you are right enough."</p>

<p>"I bring in her name for this, Edmund: that your
father is quite right about her, and that if you let her
slip through your fingers it will be wicked as well as
foolish. There, that's my opinion. Roger's out of
the question. Now, Edmund, <i>&agrave; vous</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You speak as if it didn't much matter which, so
long as it was one of us; that is highly disrespectful,
I think, to one of whom&mdash;to one who"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pax, "that's right; resent it on her
account. That's exactly what I knew you would do.
Why bring in her name, as you say? Poor Roger,
poor boy! So he thinks the world well lost for Lily
Ford. I could hope he would never live to change
his mind; but I fear that is not likely to be. Lily
Ford! Well, she is neither a bad girl nor a silly one,
any more than she can help being. I don't think ill
of her at all. She wants to be a lady, naturally, after
her ridiculous bringing up, but she has not a bad
heart. There's nothing bad about her. If she is
fond of him, if she has any sort of love for him, all
may come well."</p>

<p>Though Edmund had himself expressed a doubt on
this point, he could not hear it suggested by another.
"If she does not, she must be perverse indeed," he
said. "Whom can she have seen equal to Roger?

<!-- page 264 -->

I suppose he is the only gentleman who has ever come
in her way."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" observed Pax, oracularly. She
had not the slightest intention in what she said, nor
did she know anything about the people whom Lily
might have met. But she had a rooted objection to
assumptions generally. "Who knows? A girl like
that finds men to admire her in the depths of a wood,
where other people would see nothing but twisted
trees."</p>

<p>Altogether she did not give much comfort to her
visitor; and Edmund did not find any pleasure in
that day. He had to meet his father at dinner, who
did worse than inquire about Roger; he took no
notice of his absence, not even of the empty chair at
the other end of the table, which Edmund would not
take, and which marked painfully the absence of the
eldest son. Mr. Mitford talked a great deal at dinner;
he told stories which made Nina laugh, and even
produced from the young footman a faint explosion,
for which Larkins made him suffer afterwards. Edmund,
however, would not laugh; he sat silent, and
let his father's pleasantries pass, the presence of his
pale, grave face making a painful contrast with the
gayety of the others. Larkins was as deeply conscious
of the strained state of affairs as Edmund was,
and went about the shaded background of the room
with more solemnity than ever, while the Squire went
on with his story-telling, and Nina laughed. Nina,
indeed, did not want to laugh; she wanted to know
why Roger had gone away, and what was the meaning
of it all. But papa was "so funny," she could not
but yield to the irresistible. The dinner is always a
dreadful ordeal at such periods of family history, and

<!-- page 265 -->

most likely it was to hide his own perception of this,
and do away with the effect upon himself of that
significant vacancy at the other end of the table, that
the Squire took refuge in being funny, which was not
at all his usual way.</p>

<p>Next day Edmund was called to his father in the
library. He found him in close consultation with Mr.
Pouncefort, the solicitor who had been charged with
the family business almost all his life, having inherited
that, with other lifelong occupations of the same kind,
from his father. Mr. Pouncefort sat at Mr. Mitford's
own writing-table, with a bag full of papers at
his feet, and turned a very rueful countenance upon
Edmund as he entered. He accompanied this look
with a slight shake of the head, when Edmund came
up and shook hands with him. "Pretty well, pretty
well," he said, mournfully; "as well as can be expected,
considering"&mdash;in answer to the young man's
question. He was a neat little old man, with silver-gray
hair carefully brushed, and a way of puckering
up his brows which made his face look like a flexible
mask.</p>

<p>"Look here, Edmund," said his father, "I have
been settling my affairs, as I told you."</p>

<p>"He means destroying his will, a very reasonable
will, and making one that oughtn't to stand for a
moment," broke in Mr. Pouncefort, shaking his head
and pushing up into his hair the folds of his forehead.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort, you old croaker! Pouncefort
knows every man's business better than he does himself."</p>

<p>"It's my business to do so, and I do. I know your
affairs all off by heart, which is a great deal more

<!-- page 266 -->

than you do. And I can see to-day from to-morrow,
which you can't in your present state of mind. I
don't know my own affairs a hundredth part so well
as I know yours. Look here, a bargain: take my advice
about <i>your</i> business, and you shall say what I'm
to do with mine."</p>

<p>The county gentleman looked at his solicitor with
eyes in which familiar friendliness scarcely concealed
the underlying contempt. They had known each
other all their lives,&mdash;had been boys together, and
called each other, in those days, by their Christian
names. Mr. Pouncefort was as independent and
nearly as rich as the Squire, but he was only a solicitor
when all was said. "What!" Mr. Mitford cried,
"if I advise you to let your son marry the housemaid?
Come, Pouncefort, no folly. Read the stipulations to
Edmund, and if he likes to abide by them it's all
right. If not, I think I know another who will."</p>

<p>"I declare to goodness," asserted Mr. Pouncefort,
"I'd rather see my son marry anybody than put my
hand to this!"</p>

<p>"I didn't send for the pope nor the bishop to tell
me what was right," said the other old man. "I sent
for my solicitor&mdash;I dare say Edmund has a hundred
things to do, and you're wasting his valuable time."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do, and I wish you would listen,
sir, to what"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed the Squire, jumping up
from his chair, "is this my business, or whose business
is it? Let him hear it, and let us be done with
it. I can't stay here all day."</p>

<p>Upon which Mr. Pouncefort, occasionally pausing
to launch a comment, read the new settlement of the
Mitford property, which after all was not so cruel as

<!-- page 267 -->

appeared. Roger was not cut off with a shilling; he
was to have ten thousand pounds: but his successor
as Mr. Mitford's heir was strictly barred from conveying
back to him or his heirs, under any pretense, any
portion of the property. Roger was excluded formally
and forever from all share in Melcombe. Any
attempt at the transgression of this stipulation was to
entail at once a forfeiture of the estate, which should
then pass to the persons to be hereafter named. The
spaces for the names were all blank. Mr. Pouncefort,
shaking his head, interjecting now and then an exclamation,
read to the end: and then he opened out
the crackling papers on the table, and turned round
first to the Squire, who had resumed his seat and
listened with a sort of triumphant complacency, then
to Edmund, who had stood all the time leaning on the
back of a high carved chair. "There!" cried the
lawyer, "there's your confounded instructions carried
out, and I'm ashamed of myself for doing it; and
now, Edmund, it's for you to speak."</p>

<p>"My answer is very simple," said Edmund. "It
can be no disappointment to you, sir, for you must
have foreseen it. I refuse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You refuse! You are a great fool for your pains.
You had better take time to think it over. A day or
two can't make much difference, Pouncefort."</p>

<p>"A day or two might make all the difference," replied
Mr. Pouncefort. "Why, you might die&mdash;any
of us might die before dinner."</p>

<p>Once more the Squire jumped out of his chair. "I
think you want to drive me to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suicide?" said little Mr. Pouncefort. "Oh, no;
but I'll tell you one thing, Mitford. If you thought
you were going to die before dinner,&mdash;ay, or after it,
either,&mdash;you would not make this will."</p>

<!-- page 268 -->

<p>"You think yourself privileged," cried the Squire,
with a puff of hot breath. "So far as I'm aware my
death is nothing to you, or when it takes place. Edmund"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned the lawyer, "it's a great deal
to me, for we're the same age; and when you go, I'll
have to be looking to my preparations for the voyage.
I don't want it to happen a day sooner than can be
helped."</p>

<p>"Edmund," said Mr. Mitford, "all this is utterly
beyond the question. Take a day or two to think.
I don't want to hurry you. I like to deal justly with
everybody. You're the next, and I don't want to
pass you over; but don't think you can bully me by
refusing: for I'll stick to my intention whether you
go in with it or not."</p>

<p>"I want no time to think, sir; there can't be a
question about my decision. I am as grieved about
Roger as you can be, but I will never step into his
place."</p>

<p>" 'Never' is a long word. He might die, as
Pouncefort's so fond of suggesting, and then, of
course, you would take his place."</p>

<p>"I never will while he lives; I never will to his
detriment. Father, don't do anything about it now.
You are as young as the best of us. What does it
matter whether it's decided now or in six months'
time? For the moment let it alone. We are all excited"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not I," declared the Squire, "though Pouncefort
thinks I may die before dinner."</p>

<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. "Edmund's a
very sensible fellow," he said; "suppose we put it off
for six months."</p>

<!-- page 269 -->

<p>"What! to leave me time to die, as you say, and
balk myself? No, I tell you. I know where to find
a man to do what I want, if you refuse. Let it be
yes or no, then, on the spot, if that's what you
choose."</p>

<p>"It must be no, then, sir,&mdash;no, without a shadow
of hesitation," Edmund replied. His face was very
grave and pale,&mdash;as different as could be imagined
from his father's red and angry physiognomy. Mr.
Mitford knew it was bad for him to be thus excited.
Dying before dinner is not such an impossible thing,
when a man is stout, of a full habit, and allows himself
to get into states of excitement. He had a roar
of rage in his throat to deliver upon his son, but was
stopped by this thought, which had more effect upon
him than a high moral reason. He pulled himself up
with another puff of heated breathing, which was half
a snort; and then assumed the air of mockery which
was, he was aware, his most effectual weapon.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, sir," he said, with that very detestable
mimicry of his son's tone. "It shall be no,
then, sir, and there's an end of it. And I know
some one who will not have a shadow of hesitation,
not a&mdash;&mdash; Stephen knows very well on what side his
bread's buttered. I'll telegraph for Steve, Pouncefort."</p>

<p>"Writing will do quite well; I'm in no hurry.
One would think it was I that was pushing this matter
on."</p>

<p>"Why, I might die&mdash;before dinner," the Squire
retorted. To be mimicked is never pleasant, but to
be mimicked badly is a thing beyond the power of
mortal man to support. Mr. Mitford had no imitative
powers. Mr. Pouncefort grew an angry red
under his gray hair.</p>

<!-- page 270 -->

<p>It was at this moment that Larkins opened the
door, and came in in his dignified way,&mdash;a way that
put an end to everything in the shape of a scene
wherever he appeared. He was in the habit of making
a wide circuit round the furniture, with a calm
and decorum which made excited persons ashamed of
themselves, and which transferred all their attention,
in spite of themselves, to this perfectly <i>digne</i> and
respectable messenger from a world outside which
made no account of their excitements.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edmund, sir," Larkins said, "there is a person
outside who wishes to see you."</p>

<p>Larkins was far above making telegraphic communications
to any man, especially to one of the
family; but there was something in his look which
startled Edmund.</p>

<p>"A person," he repeated involuntarily, "to see
me?"</p>

<p>"A very respectable person, sir," Larkins said.
Then he walked round the furniture again, making
the circuit of the room, and stood at the door, holding
it open to let his young master pass.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford had seated himself in his chair at the
appearance of Larkins, with the aspect of a judge
upon the bench, severe but amiable; and Mr. Pouncefort
had smoothed down all the billows of his forehead,
as if nothing had ever disturbed him. Calm
and self-respect came back with that apparition. Edmund
was too glad to take advantage of the interruption.
He hurried out, with little thought of the object
of the call,&mdash;glad to be delivered anyhow.</p>

<p>"I have taken her up to your room, sir. I thought
you'd be quieter there," Larkins said.</p>

<p>"<i>Her!</i> Whom? Who is it? Has anything happened?"

<!-- page 271 -->

cried Edmund, scarcely knowing what he
said.</p>

<p>"It is a female, Mr. Edmund; very respectable,
and in a deal of trouble."</p>

<p>Edmund rushed up-stairs, three steps at a time.
He did not know what he feared. His rooms were at
the end of a long corridor, and the mere fact that his
visitor should have been taken there was startling.
What woman could want him in this way? But imagination
could not have helped him to call up that
homely figure in the garb of a perfect rustic respectability,
such as Larkins knew how to value, which
came rushing forward as he opened the door, turning
upon him an honest face, red with crying and misery.
"Oh, sir, where's my Lily? Oh, what's been done
with my Lily? Oh, for the love of God&mdash;if you
care for that! Mr. Edmund, Mr. Edmund, where is
my girl? Tell me, and I'll go on my knees and bless
you. Oh, tell me, tell me, if you don't want to see
me die before your eyes!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ford!" Edmund cried, with an astonishment
beyond words.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake, Mr. Edmund! Yes, I'm her
mother, her poor mother, that has trained her, may be,
for her ruin. Oh, where is my girl? Where's my
Lily? Tell me, sir, tell me wherever it is, and I'll
thank you on my knees."</p>

<p>And the poor woman flung herself, in her big shawl
and respectable bonnet, her eyes streaming, her face
working with wild supplication, heavily at his feet
upon the carpet; a figure half ridiculous, wholly
tragic, in all the abandonment of despair.</p>

<!-- page 272 -->

<div class="center" id="XXV">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXV.</p>

<p class="small">LILY'S RESOLUTION.</p>

</div>

<p>LILY FORD had been extraordinarily moved by
Roger's declaration. It had an effect upon her imagination
which was beyond all reason, and quite out of
proportion with the event. She had not been without
stirrings of heart as to Roger's visits in the days when
her mind was still free, and Stephen was to her only
a vague shadow of that hero of romance for whose arrival
she was looking daily. Roger's appearance had
been, indeed, the first that had roused the expectation
in her, and made that general and shadowy sense of
something about to happen, which is always dominant
in a girl's mind, into a still shadowy but more possible
reality. Her heart had beat its first, not for him,
but for the excitement of his coming, the prince, the
knight, the lover of all the romances. Afterwards
Lily had grown a little afraid of Roger. His visits,
his looks, his tones, all flattered her, but frightened
her at the same time. Perhaps she never could have
been at her ease with him as with Stephen. He reverenced
her too much, and Lily knew very well that
this was not the appropriate sentiment with which to
regard her. Admiration she understood perfectly,
and love more or less; but that ideal respect bewildered
her, and impaired her self-possession in his presence.
That she should look up to him as an elder
brother and head of the family was a much more possible

<!-- page 273 -->

relation than anything more familiar, and in this
light she had begun to regard Roger vaguely before
his sudden disappearance. But now that all was
changed, now that she was Stephen's betrothed, almost
his bride, his brother's sudden return, his sudden appeal
to her, the almost certainty there seemed in his
mind that he must be the first who had so addressed
her, and that only her anxiety for her father prevented
her full response, was an overwhelming surprise, and
indeed a horror, to Lily. It shocked and paralyzed
her. Her "Oh, Mr. Roger!" was a cry of terror.
No other words would come, nor did she know what
to do except to fly, to hurry away, to hide her face and
stop her ears, that she might not hear nor see those
avowals, which not only were almost criminal, but
would raise, she felt vaguely, such a wall of separation
between herself and the brother of her future husband
as nothing hereafter could overcome.</p>

<p>Lily was altogether more painfully affected by this
incident than could have been supposed possible. It
made her wretched, it filled her with visionary terror.
It was wrong, wicked, unnatural. His sister-in law!
and she dared not tell him,&mdash;dared not betray the
position in which she stood towards Stephen, who by
this time had no doubt got the license and prepared
everything for their marriage. The situation overwhelmed
the girl; no better expedient occurred to her
than to shut herself up in her room, from which,
scarcely venturing to breathe lest she should be discovered,
with feelings of alarm and agitation indescribable,
she had listened to the voice of Roger speaking
to her mother down-stairs. Mrs. Ford, for her part,
did not understand Lily's panic, nor why she should
hide herself. It was, no doubt, a very agitating and

<!-- page 274 -->

splendid event; but except for the natural tremor of
so enormous a success, and some qualms of alarm as
to its immediate effect upon Ford's position as gamekeeper,&mdash;qualms
calmed by the thought that everything
must come right in the end, for Mrs. Ford had
no faith in disinheritance,&mdash;the mother would have
easily made up her mind to boundless joy and triumph.
But Lily's condition was not to be accounted for by
mere nervousness or excitement. She was so determined
that Roger's suit could not be listened to for a
moment, so anxious to hide herself and keep out of
his way, that Mrs. Ford was compelled to yield with a
troubled heart to these tremors. She had long ago
discovered that she did not always understand Lily.
How should she? The girl was far above her mother
in so many things. It was a pride the more to think
that so humble a woman as she was could not always
tell what her child meant,&mdash;her child, who was so
much superior to any other woman's child.</p>

<p>But while Lily thus lurked terror-stricken in her
room, her mind was full of many troubled thoughts.
The time had come, she felt, when her fate could no
longer hang in the balance; when that decision, which
she could not but feel to be an awful one, must be
made. For nothing in the world would she run the
risk of meeting Roger again, or being once more addressed
by him in those words which she trembled to
think of. Rather anything than that; rather the final
step, the plunge which she longed, yet feared to make.
She had parted from Stephen with a promise that her
decision should not be long delayed, but whether without
this new excitement Lily would ever have been
able to wind herself up to so bold a step it is impossible
to tell. She sat upon the floor in her little

<!-- page 275 -->

chamber, all crouched together, sick with alarm and
nervous excitement, while the sound of Roger's masculine
voice came up from below. She had consented
that Stephen should remain in town awaiting her, and
that he should take all the steps about the license;
she had even promised to let him know, by a telegram,
the time of her arrival, in order that he might meet
and take her to the house he had selected,&mdash;the
house, of course, of a good woman, an old servant,
who would care for her until the hour of the marriage,
for which, in the mean time, all should be prepared.
Everything had been arranged between them, even to
that old church in the city which Lily, aided by her
experience of novels, had thought the safest, and which
he had yielded to, though avowing his preference for
a registrar's office. A registrar's office! Oh, no, that
would have been no marriage at all! And at last he
had consented, and even had discovered that he knew
the very place,&mdash;an old, old church, quite out of the
way. All these things began to swim through Lily's
head as she sat on the floor, in the panic and humiliation
of her thoughts, listening to the far-off sound of
Roger's voice; anticipating the horror of perhaps seeing
him again, of having to make him some answer,
of her mother's wondering questions, and of all the
commotion which she did not know how to face.</p>

<p>And on the other side, how much there was! Her
lover waiting, longing, hoping that every day would
bring her to his arms; a new life, the life she had always
known must one day be hers, and happiness, and
splendor, and her right position, and the society of
ladies and gentlemen. All this lay before her, separated
from her only by the decision, by the one step
out of her present world into the other, which would

<!-- page 276 -->

indeed be something like dying and coming to life
again, and yet would be so quick, accompanied by so
little pain; a thing, too, that must be done sooner or
later. Lily scarcely thought of the pangs she would
leave behind her, of the tortures her father and mother
would have to suffer. It would be only for a moment,
she reflected, for a single night, or perhaps a couple
of days; and then what comfort and delight to follow!
The pain was scarcely worth thinking of. Mrs.
Ford herself would not complain: she would say it
was nothing; it was a cheap price to pay for knowing
her child to be so happy. Her mother's very humbleness
reassured Lily. The parents would care nothing
for the anxiety after it was over; they would be so
glad, so glad, when the next day a telegram told them
that all was well.</p>

<p>But was she herself strong enough to do it,&mdash;that
was the question,&mdash;strong enough to forget herself,
to step out of all that was ordinary, to free herself
from every prejudice? They were only prejudices,
she said to herself,&mdash;how often had Stephen
told her so! To meet him at the railway, to drive
with him to that good woman's house, was that worse
than meeting him in the park? Was it possible for
her, was it honorable, was it modest even, to have
any doubts of Stephen? No, no, she had none. She
would be as safe with him as with her father, she
knew. It was nothing but a prejudice, a breach of
the ordinary, that was all. She wanted orange-blossoms,
and the children to strew flowers, and the
church-bells to ring. Oh, yes, she allowed it all in
her heart. That was what she would have liked best.
Oh, how she would have liked it! If she had married
Witherspoon, even, that was what would have

<!-- page 277 -->

happened at home. Witherspoon! She trembled,
and grew red for shame of herself, who, engaged to
a gentleman, an officer, should allow herself to think
it had ever been possible that she might have married
Witherspoon. The gardener! while his master was
there, pleading, persuading, with that tone of entreaty
which she could distinguish, with a shiver, down-stairs,
begging that he might see her; and he was
her brother-in-law, if he had only known it! Oh,
good heavens, her bridegroom's brother! And how
could she face him, or reply to him, or let him speak
to her, in that dreadful mistake he was making? No,
no, no! it was impossible! There was only one thing
to be done, and that was to go away. It must be
done one time or another; to-morrow or the day
after to-morrow, if not to-day. It must be done.
Was not Stephen waiting for her, waiting for her
telegram, with everything ready at that good woman's
house, and the license in his pocket? It must be
done! it must be done! It was the only way of
escaping, of seeing Roger no more,&mdash;poor Roger,
who loved her, yet must not love her, poor fellow!</p>

<p>She did not venture to get up, to run the risk of
betraying her presence in the upper room even by the
creaking of a board, until she heard his voice die out
underneath, and then his lingering step upon the
gravel. She felt sure&mdash;and her heart beat louder at
the thought&mdash;that he turned, after he had left the
door, to look back wistfully, if perhaps he might still
see her at a window. Poor Mr. Roger! But she
dared not meet him; it was kinder, far kinder to
him that she should go away.</p>

<p>Presently Lily heard her mother toiling up the narrow
stairs. Mrs. Ford came in panting for breath,

<!-- page 278 -->

but not only with the fatigue of the climbing. She
had her apron thrown over her arm, handy for wiping
her eyes or forehead, which was moist with exhaustion
and trouble. She threw herself into a chair with a
half groan. "I'd rather do the hardest day's work as
I ever had in my life than do what I have been
a-doing now," she said. "Oh, Lily, Lily!"</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?" asked Lily, though with a
tremor which showed how well aware she was of her
mother's meaning.</p>

<p>"What is it, child? It's this, that I never seen
a man in more trouble than the young master. To
think it should be <i>us</i>, as has always been so well
treated, that has brought him to this! And he
can't believe as you won't have nothing to say to
him, Lily; and no more can I, no more can I!"</p>

<p>"Do you think a girl is obliged to&mdash;to accept
anybody who asks her?" cried Lily, trying to give
her excitement a color of indignation. Her eyes shone
feverishly through quick-springing tears, and her color
changed every minute. Her agitation and trouble
were indeed very plain to see.</p>

<p>"Do you call Mr. Roger 'anybody'?" retorted the
mother angrily. "Who have you ever seen like him?
You told me you would never marry if it wasn't
a gentleman, and where will you find a gentleman like
Mr. Roger? And one that respects you, like you
were a queen. And says the Squire will never meddle
with us, seeing as he's put it all out on him. Oh,
Lily, the Squire's cut him off with a shilling, all because
of you. And now you won't have him! Oh,
poor young gentleman! and to think this is all come
to him through coming in so kind to say a pleasant
word to your father and me!"</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>"Cut him off with a&mdash;&mdash; Mother, do you mean
to say the Squire knows?" Lily's voice sank into a
half-frightened whisper. Her eyes grew large with
terror. If this were the consequence to Roger, what
would happen to Stephen? But then she reflected,
quick as a lightning flash, that Roger was the eldest
son; that no such penalty would be likely to attach to
the youngest; that Stephen was an officer, and, as
she thought in her foolishness, independent. This
quick train of thought reassured her almost before
the words were said.</p>

<p>"Knows!" echoed Mrs. Ford, with a tone almost
of contempt. "What is there as the Squire don't
know?" She did not set herself up as equal to her
daughter in any other kind of information; but for
this potentate, of whom her experience was so much
greater than Lily's, she could take upon herself to
answer. Of course he knew! Had he not discovered
for himself what Lily was, and must he not have
divined from that moment all that was happening?
"I knew," she added, "as it wasn't for naught that
he came here,&mdash;I saw it in his eyes. He was struck
when you came in; he lost his senses like. Oh, Lily,
Lily!" cried Mrs. Ford. "You I've been that proud
of! May be, after all, it would ha' been better for
all of us if you'd been more like other poor folks'
children. Oh, my pretty, that I should live to wish
you different,&mdash;me that have always been that
proud!"</p>

<p>"You don't wish me different, mother, whatever
happens," said the girl, with a sudden melting of
the heart, throwing her arms for a moment round
the homely woman, and kissing fervently her bowed
head. But Lily had disengaged herself from this

<!-- page 280 -->

rapid embrace before her mother, surprised by the
sudden warmth, could return it; and when Mrs.
Ford turned round to give back the kiss, Lily had
already begun to arrange some small articles, collars
and cuffs, which were laid out on her drawers, and
was saying over her shoulder, in a voice which had
a strained tone of levity, "It's far better for Mr.
Roger that I should have nothing to say to him, in
that case, mother,&mdash;better for both him and me.
For the Squire will have him back when he hears
it has all come to nothing. And what could we do
with a shilling? We couldn't live upon that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lily, you have always the best of sense," replied
Mrs. Ford. "I never took that view. But,
dear, you'll have to see him when he comes again.
I've done my best for you, but I can't take it upon
me no more."</p>

<p>"When he comes again! Is he coming again?
Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"How could I help it, Lily? He wouldn't take
his answer, was it likely, from me."</p>

<p>"Then, mother," cried Lily,&mdash;she spoke with her
head bent over her little collars, counting them, Mrs.
Ford thought, to see that they were all right after the
wash,&mdash;"then, mother"&mdash;&mdash; Her breath came quick,
but that was very natural, disturbed as she had been;
and she made a pause before saying any more. "I
think I must go out and stay&mdash;about the park&mdash;till
night. I cannot, oh, I cannot see Mr. Roger! It
would make me ill to see him; and what would be
the use? I will take a piece of cake for my dinner,
and go up into the wood, and come home with father.
And then you can tell him you don't know where I
am,&mdash;and it will be quite true."</p>

<!-- page 281 -->

<p>"Oh, Lily, I have said that already,&mdash;that I didn't
know where you were. It was true enough, for I
didn't know if you were here, or in my room, or in
the loft, or where you were. But if I say it again&mdash;and
him looking that anxious in my face"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It will be truer than ever, mother," said Lily.
She turned again to Mrs. Ford, and put her arms,
which trembled, round her, and leaned her head upon
her mother's breast. "Oh, mother," she cried, "I
know it's hard upon you, I know it is; but only have
patience just a very little, and everything will come
right. I know it will all come right. Only have patience
a little, and don't be vexed with me, mother dear."</p>

<p>"Vexed with you, my pretty!" cried Mrs. Ford,
hugging her child. "Since ever you were born, Lily,
you've been the pride of my heart; and I wouldn't
have you different, not a bit different, whatever was to
happen to me. There, bless you, child, don't cry:
and I'll go and cut you a nice bit of cake, and put
some apples in the basket, and you'll come home with
your father; and I'll never say another word about
Mr. Roger, poor young gentleman, though it do go to
my heart."</p>

<p>She went quickly away down-stairs, not trusting
herself to say another word, lest she should enter again
upon the forbidden subject. Lily, with hands that
trembled, lifted her hat from its box. She selected
her best hat, and a pretty little cloth jacket which
had been purchased for Sundays; but such extravagance
was not unusual with Lily, who took very good
care of her clothes, though she did not always keep
them for best. Perhaps this was one reason why she
ran out so quickly, taking the little basket hurriedly
from Mrs. Ford's hand, that her mother might not

<!-- page 282 -->

remark upon her dress. And she left her collars lying
about, not put neatly into the drawer, as was her wont.
Mrs. Ford put them away very carefully afterwards,
wondering a little at Lily's carelessness; but indeed
it was no wonder, poor child, in the circumstances,
that she should be put out of her usual tidy way.</p>

<p>XXVI.</p>

<p class="small">AT THE RAILWAY STATION.</p>

</div>

<p>ROGER arrived in London in the evening, before it
was dark. He had not had a cheerful journey. The
fact that he had not been able to see Lily, and that
her mother had a second time defended her doors
against him, and with flushed cheeks and troubled
eyes had repeated once more that Lily was out, that
she could not tell where she was, had disturbed him
in his convictions. It had seemed so certain, so self-evident,
that his suit must be acceptable to the gamekeeper's
daughter; was it possible that Lily was not
of that opinion, that she loved some one else, that
after all somebody in her own class had secured her
affections? The idea made Roger's blood boil; but
when he thought again he said to himself, No, no.
She could never give herself to a man of her father's
class; it was impossible, it could not be; and who
could she have seen whom it was possible to reckon
with as rivaling himself? Roger was not vain, especially
now when his heart was so profoundly touched.
At the best, he had scarcely expected her to love him
as he loved her. But that she should shrink and fly
from him was incredible. It could be only what her
mother said: that to find herself the cause of so
much disturbance had overwhelmed her delicate spirit.
Sweet Lily, pure flower of nature, moved by all the
most generous emotions! A girl who had been brought

<!-- page 284 -->

up in the world would have liked the commotion. She
would have thought of nobody but herself in the matter.
But Lily held her own happiness at arm's-length,
trembling for it lest it should hurt some one else.
This conception of her sweetened his thoughts, which
were not bright, as he went away. He told her mother
that he would write, explaining everything, and
that Lily must reply to him sincerely, truly, without
thought of any secondary matter. "You shall not be
disturbed; I will take care of you," he repeated,
though he did not know how he was to do so. And
thus unsatisfied, unhappy, he had gone away.</p>

<p>It seemed to Roger that at the junction, where there
was a change of carriages for some of the humbler
travelers, he saw for a moment among the changing
groups a figure which reminded him of Lily; and he
started from his corner to follow it with his eyes.
But he knew the idea was absurd even as it flashed
through his mind. It was only that he had Lily on
his heart, on his brain, in his every thought, and discovered
resemblances to her, visions of her, wherever
he turned; he knew that nothing could be more ridiculous
than the thought that Lily was traveling to
London or anywhere else, alone. It was only a delusion
of his preoccupied heart.</p>

<p>The yellow flame of the lamps, newly lighted, was
shining against the dim blue of the evening, when he
reached the big railway station, crowded and echoing
with voices and commotion. He had just got his bags
and coats out of the carriage he had occupied, and
flung them into the arms of the waiting porter, when
he was suddenly startled by the appearance of another
very familiar image, almost as unlikely in such a place
as that of Lily. The sight of his brother Stephen

<!-- page 285 -->

was not habitually a pleasure to Roger; but there was
something in his own forlornness, in his sense of severance
from all his former life, which disposed him
towards his own flesh and blood; and a wild idea that
Stephen might have heard what had happened, and
might have come to meet him, to show him a little
sympathy, though they were not usually great friends,
suggested itself in the heat of the moment. He
turned round abruptly, straight in his brother's way,
and held out his hand. "You've come to meet me,
Steve? How kind of you!" he cried.</p>

<p>Stephen had been going slowly along looking into
the carriages, as if searching for some one. He
stopped and stared, not with the air of a man who
had found the person he was seeking, but astonished
at the sudden grasp of his hand and claim upon him.
"You here!" he cried, with a look of wonder and
discomfiture; and then he laughed, getting free of
Roger's hand. "No, indeed," he said, "I didn't
come to meet you. How should I? I didn't know
you were coming. I thought you were at home."</p>

<p>"I have left home. Steve, I have a great deal to
tell you. There are things you ought to know. It
may affect you, too," added Roger, pausing, with a
new thought. "Jump into the cab with me; don't
leave me now we've met. I have a great deal to
say."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," answered Stephen, "I'm very
sorry; but I've got half a dozen engagements. I've
come here to meet&mdash;one of our fellows, don't you
know. I can't possibly spare you a moment to-night.
You're at the old place, I suppose? Well, good-by.
I'll soon look you up."</p>

<p>"Stay a moment; none of your fellows can be so

<!-- page 286 -->

important as this," said Roger, with his hand upon
his brother's arm.</p>

<p>A smile of conscious triumph came over Stephen's
face; he shook off Roger's hand and turned away,
kissing the tips of his fingers. "Ta-ta. I'll look
you up very soon," he cried, disappearing in the
crowd. Roger divined the meaning of that triumphant
smile. He looked after his brother for a moment,
with a sense that Stephen's rendezvous, whatever it
was, was an offense to his own trouble and to the
cause of that trouble,&mdash;a sin against love. The
train was long and the platform crowded. Stephen
and the person, whoever it was whom Stephen had
come to meet, were lost in the groups of moving
figures, indistinguishable, a continually shifting and
re-forming crowd, under the mingled light of the
yellow lamps and the waning day. Roger saw the
pale sky at the end of a long vista, the lights, more
perplexing than illuminating, in a row above, the dim,
long, crowded line of moving figures below. And
then, with a sigh, half of disappointment, half of a
vague and troubled foreboding, he turned to get into
the cab, which was already laden with his traveling-gear.
A curious fancy to wait and see who it was
whom Stephen had come to meet crossed his mind,
one of those sudden, vague fancies which blow about
through a man's consciousness without any will of
his own. He pulled himself up with an indignant
return upon himself. What, wait and spy upon his
brother! Of all things, that was the last. The little
self argument passed in a second, scarcely so long as
it took to transfer to the porter, who stood waiting to
know what address he was to give the cabman, the
sixpence in Roger's hand,&mdash;and it never really was

<!-- page 287 -->

a question at all. That he should watch Stephen and
find out who it was he met was as impossible as to
catch the first passer-by by the throat and rob him.
And yet, if that impossible thought had been carried
out,&mdash;if he had but done it, this impossible thing!</p>

<p>Roger went off to his chambers, the rooms which
had scarcely yet begun to show the emptiness of rooms
uninhabited. The invitation cards which he had
taken down from the glass still lay together in a little
bundle on the mantel-shelf. How few hours it was
since he had left them, still all uncertain, not knowing
what turn his fate was to take! Now it was all settled,
beyond the reach of further change. The state
of mind in which he was when he left this place,
not much more than twenty-four hours before, was
now almost incredible to him. He scarcely understood
how it could have been. From the beginning
of time it must have been clear that only in one way,
only in this way, could he have acted. Doubt on the
subject was an offense to him as he now saw it, and
all the efforts that had been made to turn him from
his purpose were as wrong as they were vain. He
thought of Edmund's action, his persuasions, the journey
they had made together, in which his brother had
been his slave,&mdash;a slave to all his caprices, while believing
that he was the guide, weaning Roger from
those plans which never could have been doubtful for
a moment, which now were fixed beyond all recall.
Poor Edmund, always so well intentioned, so well
meaning!</p>

<p>Roger sat gazing at the light of his solitary lamp,
and wondered within himself what Edmund would
do. Would he accept, after all, the reversion of the
heirship, and become in time the proprietor of Melcombe?

<!-- page 288 -->

Why should he not accept it? Since it was
no longer Roger's, how much better it should be Edmund's,
so good a fellow as he was,&mdash;the best of
them, much the best! He paused here for a moment
to wonder over again, or rather to be conscious of an
impulse of wonder floating across his mind, as to who
it was Stephen was going to meet&mdash;but dismissed
this absurd, insignificant question, and returned to
Edmund. It would be by far the best thing that
Edmund should accept, and marry Elizabeth Travers,
and bring her home to Melcombe. A smile came over
Roger's face as he sat thinking,&mdash;a smile altogether
sweet and tender, with perhaps a touch of melancholy,
as there always is in such tender thoughts. Where
could there be a better pair? They would make the
house delightful; not like anything Roger had ever
known in it, but far better, purer, more elevated, a
home of love and kindness. Yes, that was how it
must be: Edmund and Elizabeth must marry, and
live happily ever after, like the lovers in a fairy tale;
"While I and Lily," he said to himself, "Lily and I"&mdash;with
his smile softening more and more into a
melancholy, profounder, sweeter, than any sentiment
he had ever been conscious of in his life. Lily and
he would not make a home like that at Melcombe.
He did not anticipate any centre of life, any new
world beginning, in that fated union, which was like
one of the old tragic expedients of destiny in the
Greek plays, he thought,&mdash;a thing that had to be,
that no human effort could disturb. He smiled over
it with a pathetic consciousness that it might not be
what people call happy,&mdash;not like that other marriage,
like Edmund and Elizabeth; not happy in that
way,&mdash;no, nor of that kind.</p>

<!-- page 289 -->

<p>He returned with pleasure from the too penetrating
thought of his own fate to think of these two, largely
administering an ample household, a shelter from the
storms outside, an ever noble, tranquil centre of life.
His smile grew with his consciousness into a half
laugh, in which amusement mingled. Ned would fight
against it, he would not see his way, he would think it
was robbing his brother,&mdash;old Ned! the best fellow
that ever was; in love with Lizzy Travers all this
time, but never owning it, never letting himself think
of it, in case he might come in Roger's way. But in
the end Edmund must hear reason, he must see
that this was the most desirable thing that could happen.
Roger drew his writing things towards him,
and began at once to write to his brother, setting all
these arguments before him. There must be no mistake
upon the subject; Ned must do it, if it were but
for Roger's sake.</p>

After writing this letter he sat motionless for some
time, staring vacantly at the flame of his lamp. Then
he took up the pen again, and began another letter,
his great letter, his explanation to Lily. He wrote to
her as to one whom he regarded with a kind of worship,
reverent of all her ignorances and innocences,
yet as one who belonged to him, between whom and
himself there could be no obstacles that were not imaginary,
to be surmounted at their pleasure. She had
to understand this at the outset,&mdash;that she was his,
that he would hear of no objections. He had encountered
for her everything a man can encounter for
the woman he loves. It was done, and there could be
no further question. Family and fortune he had put
away for her; it only remained that she should put
away her hesitations, her anxieties for her father (who

<!-- page 290 -->

should not suffer, he promised her), her fears and
diffidences for him,&mdash;a matter so easy, and yet all
that was wanted to make everything clear.</p>

<p>It was very late when he concluded the letter, or
rather early in the May morning, the solemn hour
which is at once the dead of night and the approach
of day. As he sealed the envelope there came over
him again that insistent yet altogether irrelevant question,&mdash;Who
was it whom Stephen was hurrying to
meet, with that smile of triumph on his face? He
shook it from him indignantly, not knowing by what
mechanical freak of fancy it should come back thus,
again and again. What did it matter who it was?
Some of Stephen's banal loves, a vulgar adventure,
perhaps some one of whom it was a shame to think,
while the air was still softly echoing with Lily's name.
If he had but known!</p>

<p class="small">IN THE TOILS.</p>

</div>

<p>LILY'S heart was in her mouth, as people say,&mdash;it
was fluttering like a bird. She stepped out, stumbled
out, of the railway carriage, among the crowd, looking
wildly about her, feeling herself for the moment lost.
She had never encountered such a crowd before. She
felt herself disappear in it, among the people who were
running about after their luggage, and those who were
calling cabs, and the porters pushing through the
throng with big boxes on their shoulders. Lily felt
herself lost, as if, whoever might be looking for her,
she should never be found any more. It had not occurred
to her to prepare for the risk of not meeting
her lover. She was quite unaware where to go, what
to do. She had never been in London before, nor in
a crowd, nor left to herself to push her way. She
was as much disconcerted at finding herself alone as
if she had been a duke's daughter instead of a gamekeeper's;
and the noise and the bustle frightened her.
She looked round helplessly, wistfully, putting up the
veil which she had kept over her face during the whole
journey. No one was likely to recognize her here,&mdash;no
one except him for whom she was looking, who
had not come. Had he not come? Was it possible
that some accident could have happened, and that he
was not here?</p>

<p>Lily had some ten minutes of this panic and misery.

<!-- page 292 -->

It was the first thing that had gone wrong with her;
all the previous part of the journey had seemed so
easy. She had walked to the junction, from whence,
as had been arranged between them, the telegram was
to be sent, and thus avoided all curious eyes at the
little Melcombe station; and she had been lucky
enough to find a second-class carriage empty, where
she was left undisturbed all the way. She had not
the least idea that Roger was in the same train: nobody
had come near her except the guard, and she had
seen no familiar face; all had gone perfectly well till
now. Her heart beat, indeed, with a wildly quickened
movement whenever she allowed herself to think.
But Lily had enough perception of the necessity of
self-command to avoid thinking as much as was possible,
and to concentrate her mind upon the happy
meeting at the end of this exciting journey. She figured
to herself Stephen appearing at the carriage window
almost before the train stopped, and how in a
moment all anxiety of hers, all need to act or decide
for herself, would be over. She had nothing in the
shape of luggage except the little basket in which her
mother had put the luncheon, the slice of cake and
apples, which she had been glad enough to have before
the long afternoon was over. Lily had slipped into
this basket a very small bundle of necessaries, which
were all she had brought with her. She held it tightly
in her hand as she got out, bewildered by the arrival,
by the jar of the stopping, by the dreadful sensation
of finding herself there alone among the crowd. She
did not know how long she stood, pushed about by the
other travelers, who knew where they were going, who
had nothing to wait for; but it was long enough to
feel herself forsaken, lost, and to realize what it would

<!-- page 293 -->

be to have nowhere to go to, to be thrown upon her
own resources in this horrible great, strange, noisy
place. Then in a moment Lily's heart gave a wild
leap, and she knew it was not to be so.</p>

<p>But the first sensation of the meeting was not altogether
sweet. Instead of Stephen's face at the window,
ready, waiting to receive her according to her
dream, what really did happen was that Lily felt herself
suddenly surrounded by an arm which drew her
close, and felt a hot breath upon her cheek, and a "Here
you are at last, little one!" which jarred upon her almost
as much as it relieved her. In the railway station,
among all these crowds! She started out of his
embrace, freed herself, and threw a hurried glance
upon the bystanders with instinctive terror almost before
she looked at him. "Oh, Stephen!" she exclaimed,
with a little cry of reproach.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," he replied; "nobody knows
us here, you little goose. I might take you up in my
arms and carry you off,&mdash;nobody would mind. And
so here you are, Lil, my pet; really here at last."</p>

<p>She put her arm timidly through his. "Oh, Stephen,
I thought I should never find you! And what
should I have done!"</p>

<p>"It was not my fault," he declared. "Where is
your luggage? Oh, to be sure, you haven't got any
luggage!" He stopped to laugh at this, as if it
amused him very much, but pressed her arm close to
his side all the time with a sort of hug, which consoled
though it half frightened Lily. "Why, how are you
to get on for to-night?" he went on, still with that
laugh. "Must we stop at a shop somewhere and buy
you things for to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen, don't!" said Lily, with a pang of
wounded pride.</p>

<!-- page 294 -->

<p>"Don't? What? Talk of your things, or about
what you'll want? Well, well, we'll leave all that
till to-morrow." His laugh, why should it have offended
Lily? It had never done so before. "Here's
our cab," he said, leading her out of the noise of the
station. Lily's heart beat so that it made her faint,
as he put her into the hansom, and took his place beside
her, so close, with again that sweep of his arm
round her, which seemed to offend her too, though she
could not tell why,&mdash;she had no right to be offended
by that clasp. He had held her in his arms in the
park, when they met there, with not a creature near,
and she had not been offended: why should she be so
now, or find fault with the man who was to be her
husband to-morrow, for his fondness? She drew herself
away a little, as much as was possible; but she restrained
the protest that rose to her lips, though her
heart fluttered and beat, and all her pulses seemed to
clang in her ears, with an excitement which had pain
in it and trouble, not the sensation of safety and protection
and shelter for which she had hoped.</p>

<p>"Fancy what made me late," Stephen said; "it was
not my fault. As I came hurrying along, looking out
for my little Lil, whom do you suppose I saw jumping
out of a carriage?&mdash;and he saw me too, worse luck,
and thought, the fool, I had come to meet him. You
couldn't guess if you were to try till Christmas.
Why, Lily, my pet, my brother Roger! Think what
a fright I was in for a moment: for though you never
would own to it, <i>I</i> know he was always hanging about
the place; and if you could have had the eldest son,
my little Lil, I dare say you'd never have thought
twice of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Stephen!" she cried, with a choking sensation

<!-- page 295 -->

in her throat. "Oh, don't, don't." He held her
close as in a vise, and laughed, and delivered these remarks
with his lips close to her cheek. He was excited,
too, but the banter which had appeared to her
so sprightly and delightful at Melcombe seemed at this
tremendous moment so out of place, so dreadful to
listen to. And then Roger!&mdash;if he but knew!</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;you didn't know he was in the same train,
did you? Had he turned up a little sooner, you'd
have thrown me off at the last moment, wouldn't you,
Lil? But Roger is one of the prudent ones, my dear.
No chance for you there. Catch him offending the
Pater and losing his chances for all the girls in the
world! He is not that sort. He is not a fool in love,
like me!"</p>

<p>"Please, Stephen! Oh, please, Stephen!" Oh,
to hear all that of Mr. Roger, who had said such
beautiful things to her, who had suffered she knew not
what for her, who had come boldly and told her
mother that he wanted Lily for his wife! All at once
there sprang up in Lily's frightened soul a consciousness
that she dared not say this to Stephen, as things
now were. She had been very bold with him, and said
what she pleased, while she had her home within reach
and had still full power over herself. But now everything
seemed changed: now that she was at the height
of all her dreams had pointed to, on the eve of her
wedding-day, about to marry a gentleman,&mdash;and not
a gentleman only, but a splendid officer, the flower of
the world; now that she was about to step into another
sphere, to leave her own humbleness and obscurity
behind forever&mdash;&mdash; Confusedly Lily was conscious
of all this grandeur shining before her,&mdash;only one
other step to be taken, only a few hours to pass: but

<!-- page 296 -->

still more certainly she became aware that her lover
terrified her beyond description, and that in a moment
there had rolled up between them a crowd of things
which she dared not speak of, nor allude to, and those
the very things which she most wished to say.</p>

<p>It was a relief to her when the cab stopped, in a
quiet street, with not many lamps and scarcely any
one about,&mdash;a street of houses with little gardens in
front of them, narrow London inclosures, with a tiny
tree or bush in the centre of a space no bigger than a
table. But it was very quiet, and Lily felt a throb of
satisfaction, hoping to see the good woman, the faithful
creature who was to protect her and be a mother
to her until to-morrow. She longed for the sight of
this woman as she had never longed for anything in
her life. But no woman appeared; the door was
opened by a man, and Stephen led the way up to a
room on the first floor, where there were lights and a
table was laid. The room looked fine to Lily's inexperienced
eyes: there were flowers about, plants in
pots, and huge bouquets in vases; and the table was
pretty, with its dazzling white cover, and the glass
and silver that shone under the candles with their
pink shades. All these details caught her eye even
in this moment of troubled emotion, and gave her
a thrill of pleasure, as signs and tokens of the new
world into which she was taking her first step. The
man, whether servant or master of the house, who had
followed them up-stairs, opened a door into a room
beyond, which Lily saw was a bedroom. She took
refuge hastily in this room, half because she seemed
to be expected to do so, half that she might be alone
for the moment and able to think.</p>

<p>There were candles lighted upon the toilet table,

<!-- page 297 -->

and an air of preparation, something of the ordinary
and natural in the midst of all the horrible strangeness
of her circumstances, which consoled her a little.
She sank down upon a chair, to recover her breath
and her composure, saying to herself that it was very
foolish, even wicked, to be so full of nervousness and
doubts and fears; that having come so far, and having
done it deliberately of her own free will, she could
not, must not, give way to any imaginary terrors.
She might have known it would be terrible, this interval,&mdash;she
might have known! and where was the
good woman, the kind woman, whom Stephen had assured
her she should find waiting? Then she recalled
herself with a pang at her heart. How could she
even ask for this woman, as if she had no confidence
in the man who would be her husband to-morrow?
To-morrow,&mdash;only to-morrow,&mdash;it was not very long
to wait. This panic was due, no doubt, to the excitement
of her nerves, a weakness such as women were
so apt to have in novels. Lily had never known before
what unreasonable nerves were. She took off her
hat, which relieved her throbbing head for a moment.
But when she caught sight of herself in the glass, her
pale, scared face frightened her as if it had been a
head of Medusa. She turned away from that revelation
of her own instinctive alarms with a fresh access
of terror; her hands trembled as she put them up to
smooth her hair. The table was arranged with pretty
brushes, ivory-backed, and every kind of pretty thing,
such as Lily had heard of, but never seen before.
They had all been put there for her, she tried to say
to herself, all arranged for her gratification, and she
so ungrateful! But she could not use them. She
smoothed her hair tremulously with her hands. Oh,

<!-- page 298 -->

where was the woman, the kind woman, whose presence
would give her a little courage? Where was
she?</p>

<p>"I say, Lil, look here," cried Stephen, rattling
loudly at the door. "Don't be long about your toilet;
dinner's just coming." Then he opened the door
and half came in. "You want a lady's-maid,&mdash;that's
what you want. Not used, eh, to managing for yourself,
my dear?" His laugh seemed to fill the house
with horrible echoes. "Can't I fasten something or
undo something? Here, Lil, you'll find me very
handy," he said, advancing to her, his large masculine
presence filling the room, exhausting the atmosphere,
affecting the frightened girl with a passion of terror
which was almost more than she could contain.</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" she said, her breath coming quick,
"I shall be ready&mdash;in a moment&mdash;in&mdash;in five minutes:
oh, go away, please. If you would send the
woman, the woman"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What woman?" he asked, with a stare; then
laughing, "Oh, yes, I remember! The woman, eh?
A faithful old servant, wasn't she? Yes; well, she's
looking after the dinner, I suppose; but no doubt
there's a drudge of some kind, if you must have her.
You mustn't be silly, my pretty Lil. You must
make the best of your bargain, you know. Come,
can't I do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if I may have the woman&mdash;only for a moment&mdash;only
for five minutes!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't work yourself into a fever," he said.
"And mind you don't keep the dinner waiting, for
I'm as hungry as a hunter," he added, looking back
from the door.</p>

<p>Lily stood trembling in the middle of the room,

<!-- page 299 -->

with her hat in her hand, and that wild pain gradually
rising, swelling, in her heart. It was all she
could do to keep still, not to fly she knew not where.
But yet she made an effort to control herself. He
ought to have been more delicate, more respectful
than ever, now that she was so entirely at his mercy.
He ought to have treated her like something sacred.
Ah! but then, she said to herself, he had never been
respectful, reverent of her, like Mr. Roger. She had
preferred it so,&mdash;it was Stephen's way; he was only
a little rough, thinking there was no need for so many
ceremonies, when to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow! She stood
with one foot advanced, ready in her panic to fly,
though she did not know where she could fly to. And
then she heard his voice shouting down-stairs for some
one to come up,&mdash;for the maid, for Mary. "Here,
you Stimpson, send up the girl, send Mary&mdash;whatever
her name is." Lily hastily locked the door which
was between the rooms, while his voice was audible;
feeling that even the girl, even Mary, or whatever
her name was, would be some protection. Wild
thoughts traversed her mind as she stood there panting
for breath, like clouds driven over the sky by a
stormy wind,&mdash;thoughts over which she had no control.
For the first time the other conclusion burst
upon her, the end of the story which was in all the
books: the unhappy girl betrayed, wandering home,
a shameful thing, to die. O God! O God! would
that ever happen to Lily? Not to return in pride, a
gentleman's wife on her husband's arm, to make her
parents glad, but perhaps in shame, flinging herself
down before the door, dying there, never raising her
head! Oh, what folly! what folly! Oh, how horrible&mdash;horrible!
But it could not be,&mdash;how could it

<!-- page 300 -->

be? It was only Stephen's way,&mdash;a little rough, not
respectful; he had never been respectful. She would
have laughed at the idea before to-night,&mdash;Stephen
respectful, delicate, thinking of her silly feelings!
Oh, was it likely, when they were to be married to-morrow,
and ceremony would be needed no more?</p>

<p>Presently there came a heavy, dragging step mounting
the stairs, a hard breathing as of a fatigued creature;
the other door of the room was pushed open,
and some one came in with a steaming jug of hot
water, a London maid-of-all-work, of a kind quite
unknown to Lily, with a scrap of something white
pinned upon her rough hair, and an apron hurriedly
tied on. "I'm sorry as I forgot the 'ot water,
ma'am," she said, and put it down with much noise
and commotion, shaking the room with her tread, and
making everything in it ring.</p>

<p>She was not pretty, nor neat, nor anything that
was pleasant to see, but when she turned to go
away, after putting down her jug, Lily caught her
arm with both hands. "Oh," she cried, "don't go
away! don't go away!" holding her fast. The
young woman, half frightened, looked up in the face
of this lady who must certainly be mad to seize upon
her so.</p>

<p>"Laws!" she cried; and then, "If it's for lady's-maidin',
ma'am, I ain't no good; and Missis wants
me down-stairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a moment! wait a moment!" cried Lily
under her breath. A hundred questions rushed to her
lips, but she did not know how to put them into
words. "Didn't your mistress&mdash;expect me?" she
managed to say.</p>

<p>"Missis? Expect you? Oh yes, ma'am; the
Captain said as you were coming."</p>

<!-- page 301 -->

<p>A little relief came to Lily's mind. "She did
expect me! But why does she not come then?
Why doesn't she come?"</p>

<p>"Missis!" said the drudge, astonished. "Why,
she's a-cookin' of the dinner. She ain't a lady's-maid,
ma'am, no more than me."</p>

<p>"But you said she expected me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you! It was the Captain as expected
you. He said, 'Mrs. Stimpson, I'm expecting of my
good lady. She's been a-visiting of her friends, and
I expects her back Tuesday or Wednesday,' he says.
We was all ready for you yesterday, ma'am, and the
dinner ordered; but the Captain, he says, 'It'll be
to-morrow, Mrs. Stimpson.' He said as how you was
very fond of your own folks, and it was always uncertain
to a day when you'd come back."</p>

<p>"When I'd come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am: I hear him sayin' of it. 'Mrs.
Stevens,' he says, 'is very fond of her own folks.' "</p>

<p>"Is that&mdash;is that&mdash;what he said? And where
does he&mdash;live, then?" said Lily, in a whisper which
she could scarcely make audible.</p>

<p>"Captain Stevens&mdash;when he's at home? Laws!
how can I tell you? But for the last week he has
been living here, a-waitin' for his good lady,&mdash;just as
Missis is waiting for me to help dish up the dinner
down-stairs."</p>

<p>Lily did not say another word. She fixed her wild
eyes upon the maid's face, and signed to her to go,
impatiently. The drudge was surprised at this rapid
dismissal, but she was too much occupied with her
own dreary life to trouble herself what happened,
and her mistress, she knew, would scold her for her
delay. She went down-stairs, not looking behind,

<!-- page 302 -->

not hearing the steps that followed her. Lily followed
like a ghost; her foot was light, not like the
heavy steps of the maid. She went behind her step
by step, not thinking of anything but of how to get
away, incapable of thought. She had her little basket
still in one hand, her gloves in the other, which
she held mechanically. When the woman turned the
corner of the stairs to pursue her way to the kitchen,
Lily found herself in the narrow hall, lit with one
dull flame of gas, alone. She flew noiseless as a bird
to the door which was before her, the only way of
salvation. In another moment she was outside in the
fresh cool air of the spring night.</p>

<p>Outside,&mdash;outside of everything; alone in London,
without a soul to turn to,&mdash;alone in the unknown
streets, on the verge of the awful night!</p>

<!-- page 303 -->

<div class="center" id="XXVIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">A NIGHT IN THE STEEETS.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a long time before Lily could think at all
of what had happened, of what might have happened,
of what might be going to become of her now, all forlorn
and alone in the London streets. She had no
time for thought; the first necessity was to go away,
to go as far as her trembling yet nervously strong and
energetic limbs could carry her,&mdash;away, away from
that dreadful place. She flew rather than ran close by
the garden walls and railings, scarcely feeling her feet
touch the ground, to the end of the street, and out of
that into a little square, which she crossed obliquely,
following the street that led out of it at the other corner
in a contrary direction. Until her breath was exhausted,
and the first impulse of horror and panic had
to some degree worn out, she never paused, going always
straight before her, out of one street into another;
sometimes crossing one which was full of bustle
and lights, plunging into the darkness again on the
other side. The district to which she had been taken
was one of those which flank great London on every
side, like a series of dull towns with interminable endless
little streets, leading out of each other; all alike,
monotonous, featureless, overpowering in their blank
nonentity. Lily had no leisure of mind to understand
this, or think how it was that she found nothing
but solitude round her, though it helped to oppress

<!-- page 304 -->

her soul; but now and then a chilly anguish ran
through her, a feeling that she had got into some terrible
circle which might bring her back to the spot
she had fled from, and throw her once more into the
power of him from whom she had escaped; for the
streets were all so like, so horribly like, with the same
dull lamps at the corners, the same line of little gardens,
the same rows of windows. The light had altogether
faded out of the evening sky, but it was still
faintly blue overhead, showing a glittering and twinkling
of innumerable stars; not bright, but mildly present
in the sky, making a sort of twilight in the
heavens. The sight of this pale, ineffable clearness
appearing where there was a larger opening gave Lily
heart to go on; it was something known in the midst
of this strange wilderness through which she was wandering,
something familiar where all was so dark and
strange.</p>

<p>When the first impulse of flight and panic began to
wane, and she felt her breath fail her and her limbs
trembling under her, Lily slackened her pace unconsciously;
and then she began to think. This was
more dreadful than the other state, the wild instinct
which had obliterated everything except the necessity
of getting away. She began to remember, to realize
what it was that had happened to her. Heaven help
her, a forlorn and solitary creature, not knowing
where to go nor what to do in this awful desert of
houses, where there was no door open to her, but only
one which led to&mdash;hell. That was where it led to.
She caught her breath with an effort to repress the
long, broken, convulsive sob that shook her from
head to foot, and came back and back, like the sob of
a child which has wept all its tears away. Yet it was

<!-- page 305 -->

not of the immediate danger she had escaped that she
thought most. She did not, in fact, realize that, having
an imagination free from all visions of corruption.
What Lily realized with vivid horror was the picture
so common in books, so continually repeated, which
forms the burden of so many a rustic tale,&mdash;the betrayed
girl going home in shame and misery to die,
creeping to her father's door, not daring to knock, not
venturing even to look, hiding her ruined head upon
the threshold. That it should have come within the
most distant possibility that this could happen to her!
This was the first conscious thought that took possession
of her when she became able to think at all. It
had flashed across her mind as she stood in the dimly
lighted room, hearing from the dingy little maid what
fate was preparing for her. It returned now, and
filled her whole being with such a pervading force as
is possible only to the simple soul. It did not seem
to be a thought only, but a vision. She, Lily, the
first of all belonging to her, the one exceptional creature,
unlike all others; knowing and feeling to the
very tips of her fingers that she was not like any one
else, that she belonged to another sphere,&mdash;she whose
intention and dream it had been to go in at that
humble door, leaning upon the arm of the finest gentleman
she knew, and justify her mother's pride and
fulfill all prognostications of splendor and happiness!
That to her, to Lily, that other fate might have come,
the common fate of the rustic fool, the village girl betrayed!
Perhaps it was a proof that no stronger passion,
no self-abandonment, had ever been in Lily's
thoughts. This terrible picture took possession of
her; she could almost feel herself sinking before the
door, covering her face, and in her heart the humiliation,

<!-- page 306 -->

the shame beyond words, the collapse of every
hope. If it had not been that silence was the first
necessity in her present terrible circumstances, nothing
could have restrained the keen cry of imagined
anguish that was on her lips,&mdash;that this might have
happened to <i>her!</i></p>

<p>Then she calmed, or tried to calm, herself with the
thought that it never could have happened. Even if
she had not ascertained her danger in time and escaped
as she had done, Lily felt, grasping herself
tight, as it were, holding herself together, that shame
could never have come to her, never, never, never!
It was a thing which she could not acknowledge possible,
which never could have been. She clenched
her hands, which were cold and trembling, until she
hurt them with the pressure, and repeated Never,
never, never! In all the world there was no power
which could have brought that humiliation upon her.
Oh, no, no, no! There are things which can be, and
there are things which cannot be. She hurried on in
her passion, flying from that thought which of itself
was a degradation; for to be obliged to acknowledge
even the possibility of shame approaching, shame almost
within touch, was a shameful thing. She went
on quicker and quicker to escape from it. It takes a
long time to exhaust a thought, especially in such circumstances
as those in which the girl now found herself.
Was any girl ever in such a plight before? In
the streets of London, without a place to go to, without
a friend, not knowing where to turn, lost, altogether
lost to everybody who knew her, to everything
she knew! Her thoughts swept on like an accompaniment
to that soft sound of her light footsteps,
sometimes interrupted by a start of rising terror

<!-- page 307 -->

when she heard steps following her, or saw some
figure coming into sight under the lamplight, but resuming
again, going on and on. It was a long time
before she came to the question what she was to do.
The night had darkened, deepened, all around; the
few little shops at the street corners which she passed
from time to time had put up their shutters; the
lights were few in the windows. It was no longer
evening, but night. What was she to do?</p>

<p>Lily had never in her life gone anywhere or taken
any important step by herself. She had gone to
school, indeed, without the escort given to girls of a
higher class, but even this under limitations: put into
the railway carriage at one end, and met at the other,
as was thought necessary by her schoolmistress, at
least. She knew that what people did, when benighted
in a strange place, was to go to a hotel; but
this was an idea which made the blood course through
her veins more wildly than before. To go to a hotel,
a girl, alone, on foot, without any luggage except the
basket, which she clung to as if there might possibly
be help in it! The beating of her heart seemed to
choke Lily, as she thought of that expedient. How
could she explain that she was in London without any
place to go to? No, no, that was impossible! She
could not do it; she had not the courage. Oh, if she
could but see some good woman, some one with a kind
face, going into one of the little houses, standing at
one of the doors! In books it was so certain that a
poor girl would meet her at the end, when she was
perhaps in despair. But no good woman stood at any
door which Lily passed, or looked at her suddenly
with compassion, going along the pavement. By this
time, indeed, there were no women about, nobody was

<!-- page 308 -->

in those quiet streets. The doors were all closed;
from time to time some one went by, not distinguishable
in the lamplight, who took no notice of Lily,&mdash;sometimes
a policeman, with his heavy tread sounding
all down the street in the quiet of the night. As it
grew later and later, these policemen began to look at
her, she observed, as if she were a strange sight; and
it occurred to her that perhaps, in her ignorance, not
knowing where she was going, she might be passing
and repassing through the same street, meeting the
same man, who would naturally wonder to see a young
woman going along so late. And she began to get so
tired,&mdash;oh, so tired; feeling as if she could not go
further than the next corner, yet walking on mechanically
without any volition of her own; her limbs moving,
moving, her feet sometimes stumbling, always
going on as if they had some separate impulse of their
own. If she only dared to sit down on the steps of a
door, rest a little, perhaps go to sleep for a time, leaning
her head upon her hand! But Lily felt hazily,
in the confusion of her weariness, that if she did this
the policeman or some one might speak to her, might
take her perhaps to prison, or to the workhouse, or
somewhere which would be a disgrace. Everything
unknown seemed as if it might be a disgrace, something
that would be a shame to think of, to have encountered.
To be out all night was shameful, too,&mdash;in
the streets all night! What would any one think
to whom that was said? In London streets all night!
Anybody who heard of that would think of noise and
tumult, and crowds of people and blazing lights, and
dreadful gayety and merry-making. But what a mistake
that was! Lily said to herself. The streets of
London,&mdash;what could be more quiet? Quieter than

<!-- page 309 -->

the road through the village or the country highways,
where the dogs would bark, at least, at a passing footstep,
and the people in the houses get up to look out
and wonder who it could be. But in these streets no
dog barked, no window opened, no one looked out.
She remembered to have heard that no woman need
fear going anywhere in London, so long as she walked
steadily along, minding her own business, giving no
occasion to any one to interfere. How true that was,
how safe it was, nobody paying any attention! It
sounded a terrible thing to be out walking about the
streets all night; but it was not so dreadful, after all.
There was nobody to meddle; the policeman might
perhaps look surprised to see a girl alone so late; but
no one said a word. It was quite, quite safe; it was
the best way, so that nobody should ever know. For
who could believe it possible that Lily, <i>Lily!</i> had
spent a night like that, roaming restlessly about the
silent, dark streets. If she were not so tired, and so
faint, and so ready to cry, and so like to drop down
with utter fatigue and blinding, chilling weariness!
But here was the policeman coming again, and he
might think he had a right to speak to her if she
faltered, or made any sound of crying, or showed that
she was tired while he was passing. So she went on
and on.</p>

<p>What she would have done had she not happened
upon this quiet district, these innumerable little silent
streets, who can tell? Had she drifted into a
great thoroughfare, or the places where people live
who go home late, poor Lily's adventures might have
been very different. It was fortunate for her that
Stephen Mitford had chosen a quarter far removed
from those which he knew best, a place out of reach

<!-- page 310 -->

of any prying eyes, in the midst of the respectability
of the Westbourne Park district, in the endless labyrinths
of Roads and Gardens and Places, where midnight
commotion never enters. More than once she
passed the very corner of the street to which he had
taken her, in the ignorance of her aimless wandering in
the dark hours of the night; sometimes, indeed, was
within the length of a street from him searching for
her. But it would not have mattered had they met
face to face. Lily was forever emancipated from that
dream. He could as soon have moved the church
in the deep shadows of which the poor girl ventured
to pause a little, leaning against the railings, as have
persuaded or forced her back to the false shelter he
had provided. However, he never came within sight
of that shadowy little figure, which passed like a
ghost, going close to the houses, brushing past the
garden walls.</p>

<p>She was still going on in her circuit, her head more
and more confused, her thoughts more broken, all
lucidity gone from her mind, nothing left but the mechanical
power of movement and sense that she must
go on, when suddenly a miracle was worked about and
around the poor little wanderer. The day broke.
She was so dazed with fatigue that she had not observed
the preliminary phenomena of dawn. Things
had got clearer round her, but she had taken no
notice. She had been vaguely aware of the houses,
with their windows all veiled with white blinds, like
closed eyes, which somehow became more visible, as
if looking coldly at her, wondering what she was doing
there, when abruptly there came upon her through
an opening, like a hand reaching out of heaven, the
warmth and glory of a ray of sunshine. Lily, who

<!-- page 311 -->

all that awful night through had not uttered a sound,
started as if some one had touched her, and gave a
faint cry. The sun, the day! It was over, then, this
horrible darkness and silence. She put her hand to
her heart to which the ray, the dart, had gone. All at
once the danger seemed over. It seemed to her that
she now could sit down anywhere, which was the one
sole, overpowering wish that remained in her&mdash;rest
anywhere without being remarked. The policeman was
no longer a thing to fear, nor any one, any one! Not
that she had been afraid, but now that it was over she
felt with reawakening faculties all the horror that had
been in it,&mdash;now that it was day. She did not sit
down, however, though the friendly steps at all those
closed doors appeared to spread out like delightful
places of refuge to receive her. One on which that
ray of sunshine slanted was almost too tempting to
be resisted. But courage came back to her with the
light, and freedom and deliverance. It might be possible
to ask for shelter somewhere, to look out wistfully
again for that good woman, now the day had
come. But though she felt this sudden relief in her
soul, utter exhaustion made Lily like a creature in
a dream, moving she could not tell how, drifting onward
with little conscious impulse of her own. She
remarked things round her, and felt the sensation of
freedom, but always as in a dream. Presently she
came to the edge of a large thoroughfare, and stood
and gazed at it with a wonder that was half reverence
and half fear. Lily knew enough to understand that
this was not like the streets in which she had been wandering.
The great shops all barricaded and barred,
the wide pavements, the many lamps, some of them
still burning ineffectually, with curious unnecessary

<!-- page 312 -->

light, in the full eye of day, showed her that this was
one of the centres of life of which she had heard. She
thought it was perhaps Regent Street or Piccadilly.
To see it bereft of all life, silent, filled with light and
the freshness of the morning, produced in her mind
some faint shadow of that emotion with which the
poet saw the "mighty heart" of the great city lying
still, and the river flowing at its will. But that impression
was faint, and the aspect of the deserted
street chilled once more the innocent vagrant, half
restored to life by the awakening touch of day.
There was no one to help her, no one looking out
to see what unhappy lost creature was in want of
succor, no good woman. Oh, where was she, that
good woman, who would take her by the hand, who
would stand between her distracted youth and the terrible
world?</p>

<p>She was too much worn out, however, to feel even
this with any warmth. Standing still had rested her a
little: she went on again, automatically, scarcely knowing
why, because there was nothing else for her to do,
along the whole vacant length of the empty street.
An early workman or two, pipe in mouth, went past
her, taking no notice. No one took any notice. The
earliest houses began to wake, as she passed, a few
blinds were drawn up, a housemaid appeared here and
there at a door,&mdash;a girl who had slept all night, and
risen to her work cheerful and rosy, whereas she! One
or two of these looked curiously at her, she thought, as
she went along. Was her walk unsteady? Was her
hair untidy? she wondered vaguely. What would they
think? And what was she to do? What was she to
do? Though she could neither feel nor think save by
moments, something would rise in the morning air, and

<!-- page 313 -->

breathe across her with this question. What, what was
she to do? As she went on, she suddenly became aware
that the people whom she had begun mechanically to
observe, appearing one by one from various sides, were
all tending in one direction; and then a carriage or two
came noisily along, disturbing the quiet, turning the
same way. She looked up, and her heart gave a wild
spring, then fell down again, down, down, into her
bosom. It was the railway to which the people were
all tending, and she with them,&mdash;the way home.
How could she go home? Oh, home, home, to which
she had meant to return triumphant on her husband's
arm! Her husband&mdash;but who was he? She had no
husband; and how could she go home? She must
think, she must think; the time had come at last
when she must think, and find out what she was to
do. She went on with the little stream, following instinctively,
as if the current had caught her. One
lady went into the waiting-room, where Lily followed,
still mechanically. She did not know why she should
choose to follow that individual more than another:
they were all blind leaders of the blind to the confused
intelligence, now sinking into a sort of waking
sleep. But when she found herself sheltered by four
walls and with a roof over her head, the long wretchedness
of the night overwhelmed Lily. It seemed to
have waited for her there to close around her, to stupefy
all her faculties. She sank down upon a sofa,
unconscious of the public place it was, knowing nothing
except that here at last was shelter, and a place
where she could lay her weary head.</p>

</div>

<p>"YOUR Lily?" exclaimed Edmund, with an
amazement so evident that the poor woman, who
stood subduing herself, in a state of passionate excitement,
yet keeping down her voice and her tears,
half in eagerness to hear his reply, half in terror lest
she should betray her distress to other ears than his,
clasped her hands together in dismay, and burst into
one momentary strangled cry. She had not doubted
that he would know,&mdash;and he knew nothing. Her
feverish hope, the hope which had seemed almost a
certainty, fell in a moment and perished.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," she said, "oh, Mr. Edmund, don't say
that you don't know, for it's been all my hope!"</p>

<p>He took her by the hand gently, and led her to a
chair. The interruption had made him angry at first;
but the real and terrible suffering in her homely face,
which was blanched out of all its usual ruddiness, the
mouth trembling, the brows all puckered with trouble,
touched Edmund's heart. "Sit down," he said, "and
compose yourself, and tell me what has happened. I
know nothing about your daughter: what is it? If I
can do anything to help you, I will."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Edmund!" cried the poor woman again;
then she clasped her hands in her lap, and, leaning
forward, her eyelids swollen and large with tears, said
with impressive tragical simplicity, "I have not seen
my Lily since yesterday middle day,&mdash;not since yesterday
middle day."</p>

<!-- page 315 -->

<p>"You have not seen her? I don't understand,"
said Edmund. "Do you mean that you have had
a quarrel&mdash;that she has&mdash;&mdash; No, no, I know that
can't be. She must have gone&mdash;to see some of your
friends."</p>

<p>"We have no friends, Mr. Edmund, as she'd wish
to go and see. Oh, if I've been a foolish woman
bringing her up as I have done, out of her own kind,
oh, God forgive me, and that it may all lie upon me!
Mr. Edmund she's got no friends for that reason,
because she's a lady, is my Lily, and the rest are
all just girls in the village. It never was no amusement
to her, nor no pleasure, to go with them. No,
no, she's not gone to no friends. There's only one
thing I can think of to keep me from despair. Oh,
Mr. Edmund, have pity upon me! Tell me as she
has gone off with your brother, and I'll never say
a word. I'll not suspect nor think no harm. Mr.
Edmund, I have confidence in my Lily, and Mr.
Roger, he's always acted proper and like a gentleman.
Oh, Mr. Edmund, say as he's taken her away!"</p>

<p>"Why should he take her away? He has asked
her to marry him, and he has told you of it, and
my father knows; everybody is now prepared for
the marriage. You may be sure it would never occur
to my brother to do anything clandestine, anything
secret. Why should he? He has suffered
enough for her; there can be no need for any secret
now."</p>

<p>Edmund could scarcely restrain the indignation
which rose in his mind as he spoke. Yes, Roger had
suffered enough for her. To run away, after all,
with this cottage girl was a supposition impossible,
unworthy of him, ridiculous. Why had he borne all

<!-- page 316 -->

that he had done, if the matter was to come to such a
solution at the end?</p>

<p>"I've said that to myself," said poor Mrs. Ford.
"I've said it over and over: all as ever Mr. Roger
has done or said, he's been the perfect gentleman all
through. But," she added, crushing her hands together,
and raising to him her tearful face, "if my
Lily is not with him, where is she? for I have not
seen her&mdash;I have not seen her"&mdash;her voice broke,
choked with tears and unquenchable sobs&mdash;"me, that
never let her out of my sight,&mdash;not since yesterday
middle day. And there's her bed that no one's
slept in, and her things all lying, and supper and
breakfast never touched. And oh, where is she, <i>where</i>
is she, Mr. Edmund, where's my Lily?" cried the
poor mother, her painful self-control breaking down.
She held up her hands to him in an agony of appeal.
Her poor homely face was transfigured with love and
anguish, with that aching and awful void in which
every wretchedness is concentrated.</p>

<p>It was scarcely to be wondered at if in Edmund's
mind there had sprung up at first a sort of impatient
hope that here was a possibility of being rid of Lily,
that troubler of everybody's peace. But he could not
resist the misery in the poor woman's face. He sat
down by her and soothed her as best he could, inquiring
when and how the girl had disappeared and
what the circumstances were, if perhaps they might
throw any light upon it. It was a curious and bewildering
coincidence that she should have disappeared
on the afternoon on which Roger had gone to town.
Was it possible, his brother asked himself, that, weary
of all that had taken place, scarcely happy even in
the prospect of what was to come, Roger had snatched

<!-- page 317 -->

at the possibility of concluding the whole business
without further fuss or fret, and persuaded her to
trust herself to him? He thought it strange, very
strange, that his brother should have dreamed of such
an expedient; stranger still that Lily, no doubt elated
by such a change in her fortunes, should have consented
to it, and foregone her triumph. But still it
was extraordinary that both these events should happen
in one day, both in one afternoon, Roger's departure
and Lily's disappearance. He could not
refuse to see the probability of some connection between
them. While he listened to Mrs. Ford's story,
his mind went off into endeavors to reason it out, to
convince himself that the possibility of such a rapid
conclusion might have struck Roger as desirable.
He interrupted her to ask if she had inquired at the
station, if any one had seen Lily there. "It must
be known, some one must have seen her, if she went
by that train. But of course you have inquired
there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford replied with a little scream of alarm.</p>

<p>"Ask, ask at the station!&mdash;as if I didn't know
about my own child, as if she had gone away unbeknownst
to me! I'd rather die! Oh, Mr. Edmund,
don't go and do that; don't, for God's sake! Ask&mdash;about
Lily!&mdash;as if she was lost, as if we didn't
know where she was"&mdash;&mdash; She seized him by the
arm, in her terror, as if she feared he would begin
his inquiries at once. "Oh, Mr. Edmund, don't,
don't, for the love of God!"</p>

<p>"If you do not inquire, how are you ever to
know?" he asked, with impatience.</p>

<p>"I'd rather never know," she replied. "I'd
rather spend my life in misery than expose my Lily.

<!-- page 318 -->

Whatever she's done, she's done it with a right
heart: whatever happens, I know that. And rather
than ask strangers about her, or let on as I don't
know, I'd rather die. Don't you go and expose us,
and make my girl the talk of the parish that doesn't
know her&mdash;oh, that doesn't know what she is! Ford
would have done it, never thinking; but he saw when
I told him. Mr. Edmund," she said, rising, with
a kind of dignity in her despair, "I came to you
putting faith in you because of your brother. You
haven't got no right to betray me, nor my Lily. If
you go and expose my Lily"&mdash;&mdash; She stopped with a
gasp,&mdash;words would do no more,&mdash;but confronted
the young master, the gentleman to whom she had
looked up as a superior being, with all the indignant
grandeur of an angry queen.</p>

<p>"You need not fear for me,&mdash;I will betray no one,"
said Edmund. "And I think I understand you," he
added, more quietly, "but it is very unreasonable,&mdash;you
must see it is unreasonable. How are we to find
out if we make no inquiries? However, I understand
you, and I will say no more. I don't know what to
think about my brother. It was to avoid him that
she left the house, and that she told you she was
going to spend the day in the park; and she said
you could tell him truly that she was far, far away?
And yet you think&mdash;&mdash; I don't know what to think."</p>

<p>"It's all true,&mdash;it's all true! Nor I don't know
what to think&mdash;&mdash; But oh, my Lily, my Lily, where
is she?" the mother cried, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>After a time Edmund succeeded in calming the
poor woman, and persuaded her to go home, promising
to follow her there, to meet her husband, and
discuss with them both what was to be done. Appearances

<!-- page 319 -->

were so strongly against Roger that it was
impossible for Edmund to stand aside and let the
poor little rural tragedy go on to its appropriate, its
conventional end. If Roger had anything to do with
it, it would not have that conventional end. But it
became harder and harder, as he thought all the circumstances
over, to persuade himself that Roger
could have taken such a strange step. He conducted
Mrs. Ford down-stairs through the billiard-room,
which was the way in which she was least likely to be
seen by the servants, and flattered himself that nobody
save Larkins was any the wiser. Larkins was a
person of discretion,&mdash;of too much discretion, indeed,
for he had looked every inch the possessor of a family
secret when he called Edmund out of his father's
room to see Mrs. Ford, and there was a suspicious
vacancy about the hall and corridors, as if the prudent
butler had thought it necessary to clear every
possible spectator away. The consciousness of something
to conceal makes the apprehension unusually
lively. In ordinary circumstances Edmund would
have remarked neither Larkins's looks nor the vacancy
of the house and passages. He was not, however,
to be allowed long to congratulate himself upon
this quiet. When he came out of the billiard-room,
after Mrs. Ford's departure, he met Nina, her eyes
dancing with curiosity and the keen delight of an inquirer
who has got upon the scent of a new mystery.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edmund!" she said, breathless, too eager
even to dissimulate the heat of her pursuit.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, Edmund, only looking. Was that
Mrs. Ford, that woman going out this way?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter to you who it was, Nina?

<!-- page 320 -->

You had better go back to your own part of the
house."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edmund, I do so want to know. I want to
ask you something. What is the matter? You and
papa were shut up so long in the library, and then
you and Mrs. Ford. Are you fond of Lily, <i>too?</i>
Are you like all the rest?"</p>

<p>Edmund put his hand upon her arm, and led her to
the drawing-room. It was only there, in the shelter
of that wide and quiet space, that he trusted himself
to turn round upon her. "Nina," he said, severely,
"will you never be cured of this prying and listening?"
And then, drawing his breath hard, "Why
do you put such a question to me? Do you know it
is a great piece of impertinence? And what do you
mean by 'all the rest'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edmund, don't look so angry. I haven't
done anything wrong; indeed, indeed, I wasn't listening!
How could I," said Nina, with indignation,
"when you know there are those horrid porti&egrave;res at
the library door?"</p>

<p>Edmund, with a groan, threw himself into a chair;
this little creature, with her odious insight and information,
had him in her power.</p>

<p>"And, Edmund," she went on, "do you think it is
possible not to want to know, when the whole house is
turned upside down? Roger coming home on Monday,
going away on Tuesday again, you in a great
worry all the time, papa so angry and shut up in the
library with Mr. Pouncefort,&mdash;there is always something
wrong when Mr. Pouncefort is sent for, Simmons
says,&mdash;and then Mrs. Ford taken to your
sitting-room up-stairs. If you think all that can happen,
and only me not want to know!"</p>

<!-- page 321 -->

<p>There was a certain reason in what she said which
her brother could not dispute; and her words were
full of mysterious suggestions. "What do you mean,"
he said again, "by 'all the rest'?"</p>

<p>"I would tell you if you would not be angry; but
how can I tell you, Edmund, when you find fault with
everything I say?"</p>

<p>He waved his hand in mingled impatience and apology.
All the rest!&mdash;was it only the instinct of a
gossip, or was there any light to come upon this dark
problem from what Nina, with her servants'-hall information,
really knew.</p>

<p>"Well, Roger is in love with her," said Nina,
calmly; "every one, both up-stairs and down-stairs,
knows that. I did," the little girl added, with a certain
triumph, "long ago."</p>

<p>"Nina, you don't know how you vex me. You
ought to be sent away, my poor little girl; you ought
not to be left here"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Geraldine's or Amy's! Oh, yes, do ask papa
to send me," cried Nina, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"But allowing that about Roger, which is no business
of yours, Roger is only one, after all; what do
you mean by 'all the rest'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I only said that when I thought that you, <i>too</i>&mdash;because
of Mrs. Ford going up to your room, Edmund."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to do with Mrs. Ford, nor with
me either. What did you mean by 'all the rest'?"</p>

<p>Nina hung her head a little. "It isn't grammatical
to say <i>all</i> when there are only two, is it?" she
said; "but supposing there <i>were</i> only two, Edmund,
why, then they would be 'all the rest'!"</p>

<p>"Who are the two? Who was the second, Nina?"</p>

<!-- page 322 -->

<p>"Oh, Edmund, don't tell upon me! I don't mind
for Roger. He might be angry, but he wouldn't
scold me. And then they say he has told papa and
everybody that he is going to marry Lily, so it would
be no secret. But, Edmund, if you were to tell
Steve"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Steve!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course," said Nina, "he is 'all the rest;'
who could it be else? I said you <i>too</i>, and there are
only the three of you. I found out Steve all by myself.
He used to go out every evening after dinner.
I wondered very much, how could I help it? and
then I found out what it meant."</p>

<p>"Nina, this is too dreadful; you are no better than
a little spy. You found it out, you went after him,
you followed him&mdash;where? To the lodge?"</p>

<p>Nina had been nodding vigorously during the course
of these interrogations; but when he came to the last
she changed the movement, and shook her head with
all its innocent curls, instead of nodding it. "Oh, no,
no!" she said, "he never went near the lodge; she
met him in the park. They had a post-office, a place
where they put their letters, in a hollow tree; I could
show it to you, Edmund. And I will tell you another
thing," cried the girl, forgetting all possibility of reproof
in the delight of having such a wonderful tale
to tell. "Some one saw Lily Ford at Molton Junction
yesterday. She went to the office and sent off a
telegraph,&mdash;oh, I know that's not the right word,
but you know what I mean,&mdash;she sent off a telegraph
from Molton Junction. It is a long walk to Molton
Junction. If it had been right to do it, she would
have sent it from our own station. I don't know
what it was," said Nina, regretfully, "but I am sure
she must have intended that nobody should know."</p>

<!-- page 323 -->

<p>"At Molton Junction!" Edmund forgot to chide
the little collector of news, whose eyes were dancing
with satisfaction and triumph, as she brought out one
detail after another. She enjoyed her own narrative
thoroughly, without observing its effect upon him.
He had grown very grave, his face was overcast, his
brows were knitted over his eyes, which looked away
into vacancy as if seeing something there that appalled
him. "And what then? What did she do
then?" he asked, sharply, turning round. Nina was
taken by surprise at this sudden change of tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I did not hear any more. I suppose
she must have walked home again. And fancy
going all that way only to send a telegraph, when you
have a station so near your own door!"</p>

<p>"Then she went only to send the telegram; and
came back again?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Nina, with a sudden sense that
her evidence, though so full of interest that at last it
had silenced Edmund, was on this point defective.
She had all the instincts of a detective, and perceived
her failure, and saw in a moment that her brother had
expected more. But Edmund asked no further questions.
His mind was indeed so distracted by this new
light as for the moment to be almost paralyzed. And
yet there was nothing impossible nor even unlikely in
it. But if the solution of the problem was to be
found in Nina's story, what was he to say to the miserable
father and mother? The new character thus
introduced was very different from him whom they
suspected; and Stephen's actions could not be calculated
on, like Roger's. If Lily had fallen into his
hands, Heaven help her! for she was very little likely
to escape. It was not, however, of Lily that he

<!-- page 324 -->

thought; if he considered her at all, it was with an
impatient feeling that, whatever happened, she would
have but herself to thank for it, which was not just.
Even Ford and his wife, though Edmund's heart
ached to think of them, held a secondary place in his
thoughts. But Roger! This was what struck him
dumb with dismay. How was he to tell Roger that
the girl he had loved had fled from her father's house,
and in all probability with his brother? And the
Squire, who for this unhappy girl's sake had disinherited
Roger, and was putting Stephen's name in the
place of that of his eldest son! What could be more
terrible than that irony of fate?</p>

<p>EDMUND found Ford the gamekeeper, with red
eyes, strained by watching and misery, waiting for
him as he approached the lodge; and Mrs. Ford came
out from her door to meet them as they neared the
house. The sight of these two unhappy people gazing
at him with a wistful hope, as if he could do something,
went to Edmund's heart. Their house loomed
vacant and miserable, with all the doors open, an
empty place behind them, while they stood on either
side of their visitor, and with appealing faces mutely
implored him to help them. For neither of them
could say much. "Oh, Mr. Edmund!" Mrs. Ford
cried from time to time, while her husband stood
crushing his hat in his hands, starting at every little
sound, with his bloodshot eyes fixed upon the young
master. Ford's misery was more pitiful to see than
his wife's was. He had less command of words, and
could not calm himself either by renewed statements
of the case or tears, as she could: and perhaps the
grosser dangers were more present to his mind, and
he had less confidence in Lily's power of controlling
circumstances. All that he could do to relieve the
anguish of his soul was to turn and twist his hat out
of all shape in those strong moist hands, with which
he would have wrung the neck, if he could, of the
man who had beguiled away his Lily: but Ford was
not capable of uttering her name.</p>

<!-- page 326 -->

<p>Edmund's attempt to question the anxious pair as
to whether Lily had known any one who could have
tempted her away, whether there was any lover, even
any acquaintance whom she could have made without
their knowledge, produced nothing but eager contradictions
from Mrs. Ford, and a look of fury in her
husband's face which warned Edmund that the man
was nearly beyond his own control, and might almost
be tempted to spring upon him, Edmund, in lieu of
any other victim. "Who could she ever see? Who
entered our doors but Mr. Roger? And not him with
my will," said Mrs. Ford,&mdash;"oh, not with my will!
I would have shut the door upon him, if I could.
But never another came near the place,&mdash;never another!
And she wasn't one to talk or to bandy
words: oh, never anything of that sort! She was as
retired, as quiet, never putting herself forward, never
letting any man think as she was to be spoken to different
from a lady"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ford made a wild movement, as if he would have
struck his wife. "Will you stop that?" he said
hoarsely, the blood mounting into his brown, weather-beaten
countenance; and then she began to cry, poor
soul, while he kneaded his hat with restless hands, and
looked straight before him into the vacancy of the
park, his eyes red and lowering with excess of wretchedness
and sleeplessness and misery. He could not
speak nor hear her speak; he was impatient of any
touch upon his wounds; and yet, in the helplessness
of his ignorance, incapable of doing anything in his
own person, he turned his piteous gaze again, with
dumb expectation, on Edmund, who assuredly could
do something, he knew not what, to help to clear up
this misery, to find Lily if found she could be.</p>

<!-- page 327 -->

<p>"Mrs. Ford," said Edmund, "if you are right, she
is as safe as if she were here in your own care. My
brother Roger asked her from you as his wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Edmund!" cried Mrs. Ford, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>"She is as safe as in your own house," said Edmund,
stopping with a gesture the story on her lips.
"If she is with him, all is well. Ford, you know him;
you know that what I say is true."</p>

<p>The man looked at him wildly, crushing his hat
into a pulp in his fierce grasp. "I don't know nothing,"
he suddenly burst forth, with a kind of roar of
anguish,&mdash;"nothing but that I'll wring his damned
neck with these hands!"</p>

<p>"Ford, oh, Ford!"</p>

<p>"I'll wring his damned neck, master or no master,
if he's harmed my girl!" said the man, with his
hoarse roar, pushing his wife away with his elbow.
Then he turned to Edmund with the pathetic eyes
of a dog, a helpless dumb creature asking for help.
"Do something for us, Mr. Edmund," he said.</p>

<p>"I will, I will, if I can," Edmund cried. They
stood on each side of him, their eyes, appealing, going
to his very heart. What was he to do? He
knew, though they did not, how vain it was. If she
were with Roger, then no harm could come to her.
But Stephen!&mdash;how could he suggest to them that
horrible danger, that misery in which there was no
hope?</p>

<p>Edmund went to London by the night train. He
arrived very early in the gray of the morning, before
it was possible to see any one, even his brother. He
went to the hotel near the station, and loitered
through those slow, still morning hours, when nothing

<!-- page 328 -->

can be done, which are perhaps more dreadful in
their monotony than any others. He was too much
excited to sleep, and the brightness of the morning
was appalling and merciless; softening nothing, showing
everything terribly distinct and clear. To go to
Roger and seek Lily there appeared to him more futile
than even he had felt it to be at first. Lily there!
Could anything be more impossible? That Roger
should expose his wife that was to be to the faintest
remark, that he should subject her to any misconstruction,
that he could even have supposed it within
the bounds of possibility that Lily would consent to
go with him, Edmund now knew was preposterous.
He had known it all along, but from pure pity of the
misery of the family he had allowed himself to think
that perhaps for once the impossible might have happened.
He now felt that it could not be so. But on
the other side, if Nina was right! The Mitfords had
no delusions in respect to each other; at least there
was none so far as regarded Stephen. Stephen was
the member of the household whose course of action
had always been most certain to the others. He
would do what was for his own pleasure and his own
interest. He professed no other creed. What he
liked, what suited him, was what he did: and if he
chose to gather that humble flower, what was it to any
one? He would do it without any after-thought.
Was it not only too possible that he had corrupted
Lily even before she left her father's house? Edmund
set his teeth, with something of the feeling,
though the culprit was his brother, which had made
poor Ford in his passion crush the hat which was in
his hands. "I would wring his damned neck!" Edmund,
with a passion of indignation and righteous

<!-- page 329 -->

wrath in his heart, felt that he too could do the same.
And how could he hold back the miserable father,
whatever he did in his anguish? If Stephen had not
corrupted her, then he had betrayed her. Poor Lily!
Poor flower of folly, trained to her destruction! He
thought with a kind of rage of all concerned, from his
own mother, who had begun that fatal career, to the
fond, deluded parents, who had put their pride in
their daughter and brought her up a lady. A lady,
and the gamekeeper's daughter,&mdash;too good for her
own people, not good enough for the others, destined
to trouble from her cradle, devoted to misery and
shame! Poor Lily, it was no fault of hers. It was
not by her will that she had been separated from the
honest rustic lover who would have made her father's
daughter a good husband, had it been left to nature.
The gardener, with his little learning, his superior
pretensions, his pleasant house and work,&mdash;how
happy Ford's daughter might have been in such a
simple possible promotion! Whereas now, the ruin
of one brother or the prey of another,&mdash;was this all
her harmless vanity, her foolish training, her fatal
beauty, had brought her? To bloom like a flower,
and to be thrown away like one, and perish, trodden
underfoot. Edmund's heart was sore with these
thoughts. He had come to help, but how could he
help? Could he take her back to these poor people,
stained and shamed, her glory and her sweetness
gone? Would she go with him, even, abandoning
the delight of a life of gayety and noise and so-called
pleasure, to return to the wretchedness of the home
she had left and the name she had covered with
shame? Poor Lily, poor Lily! His heart bled for
her, the victim of the folly of so many others more
than of her own.</p>

<!-- page 330 -->

<p>As soon as it was possible to do so, he went to
Roger's chambers, which he had always shared, and
in which, now that the day was fully astir and awake,
he had his own room to retire to, to prepare himself
for an interview which he dreaded more and more
as it approached. Though half a day seemed
to have passed since Edmund's arrival, it was still
early, and Roger was not yet visible. His letters
were on the breakfast-table ready for him, one in Mr.
Mitford's well-known hand, which Edmund perceived
with a sensation of impatience almost insupportable;
thinking of Stephen promoted to Roger's place, of
Stephen guilty and cruel in the place of his honorable
and innocent brother, and of the unhappy girl who
stood between them, for whom Roger was suffering
without blame, and upon whose ruin Stephen would
stand triumphant. Could such things be? It was
all he could do to restrain himself, not to seize upon
his father's letter and tear it into a thousand pieces;
but what would it matter? His father, Edmund
knew in his heart, would forgive Stephen's fault,
but not Roger's. It made no difference. Lily destroyed
would not stand in the younger brother's way,
while Lily honored and beloved would ruin Roger.
It was horrible, but it was true.</p>

<p>When Roger appeared, he came up to Edmund
almost with enthusiasm, with a sparkle of pleasure
in his eyes. "I thought, somehow, I should see
you soon," he said; "it seemed natural you should
come after the one who was down on his luck," and
he grasped his brother's hand with an unusual effusion.
Though this was all that was said, they were
both a little moved,&mdash;Edmund, as he felt, with better
reason, for how he was to make known his trouble

<!-- page 331 -->

now he could not tell. The moment he saw Roger,
all doubt of him disappeared from his mind. To
have asked him where Lily was, or if he knew anything
of her, would have been an insult. He had felt
this with waverings from the first, but he had no wavering
on the subject now. Roger, too, had a great deal
of excitement about him, which took the form of elation,
and even gayety: smiles danced in his eyes; he
laughed, as he spoke, for nothing, for mere pleasure.
"I hope you got my letter," he said; "but you could
not, I fear, since you must have started last night."</p>

<p>"I got no letter. I was&mdash;anxious to see you&mdash;to
know&mdash;&mdash; I suppose you have been arranging things."</p>

<p>"So well that I don't understand how I can have
been so successful the first try. I had made up my
mind to everything that was discouraging. You
know, people say that when you want anything very
much, that is precisely the time when you don't get it.
But I've had a different experience. I went to see
Hampton yesterday. I thought he was the man, if
there was anything to be had: but you'll never believe
what he's going to do. They're coming into
office, you know. The excellent fellow offered me the
post of his private secretary. What do you think,
Ned,&mdash;private secretary to a cabinet minister, the
very first try one makes!"</p>

<p>"I am very glad, Roger; but it will be hard work,
and you're not used to that."</p>

<p>"Work! what does that matter? I shall delight
in it, and there is no telling what it may lead to. I
never thought I should fall into public life in this
way; but I have always had a fancy for it, one time
or other, don't you know?"</p>

<p>Edmund did not know; indeed, he thought he

<!-- page 332 -->

knew the reverse, and that his brother had aimed at
a life untrammeled by any such confinement. But he
did not say so. "It is a capital beginning," he said.</p>

<p>"I should think it was! I never hoped for anything
of the kind: but I have a feeling," said Roger,
with again a little joyous laugh, "that my luck is going
to turn, Ned. I've had a good long spell of bad;
I have some good owing me, and I feel that it's coming.
Why don't you say something, you sulky fellow?
I believe you're not half pleased."</p>

<p>"I am pleased, as long as it pleases you. It is not
the life I should have planned for you, but if you
think you will like it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think! I don't think, I know: it will give me
occupation and something serious to think of. A
man wants that when he settles down. I wrote to
Lily, too," he said, his voice softening, "putting
everything before her."</p>

<p>And then there was a blank silence for a moment,
one of those pauses full of meaning, upon which the
most unsuspecting can scarcely deceive themselves.
Edmund did not so much as look at his brother, whom
he was about to strike with so cruel a blow.</p>

<p>"Well," Roger said, after a moment, "speak out;
what have you got to say? I know there is something.
Let me have it without more ado."</p>

<p>"It is not so easy to speak out," returned Edmund.</p>

<p>"Why, Ned! You forget that I know it already.
My father has done what he threatened. He has put
me out of the succession. Do you think I did not know
he would keep his word? And you have got it, old
fellow," said Roger, putting out his hand, "and I am
quite satisfied. I wish you had got my letter. What
England expects of you now is that you should marry

<!-- page 333 -->

Elizabeth, and live happy ever after. Did you think
I should grudge it to you, Ned?"</p>

<p>Edmund listened to all this with a perfectly blank
face. It sounded in his ears like something flat and
fictitious, without interest, without meaning. He
grasped the hand which his brother held out to him
across the corner of the table, and held it fast. It
seemed as if that little speech which Roger made him
would never be done. Edmund held the hand after
Roger's voice ceased, and again there was another
pause. Then Edmund heard his own voice say, as if
it were some one else speaking, "When did you last
see Lily Ford?"</p>

<p>"See Lily?" Roger looked at him with wondering
eyes. Then he said, with a little impatience, "I have
not seen her since the night before I left home. You
know that. She would not see me, for some reason
or other, a panic about her father; but I have written,
I have set everything before her&mdash;&mdash; Ned, what is it?
What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She did not&mdash;come with you to London?"</p>

<p>"Ned! What do you mean? Have you taken
leave of your senses? Come with me to London, the
girl who is to be my wife?"</p>

<p>"I told them so," said Edmund. He could not
lift his eyes and look Roger in the face.</p>

<p>"You told them so? Edmund," said Roger, laying
his hand upon his brother's arm, "you have something
to tell me, something you are afraid to say. For
Heaven's sake, out with it! What is it? Something
that I do not expect?"</p>

<p>"Roger," said his brother faltering, "Roger, Lily
Ford disappeared from her home the day you left.
They do not know where she is, nor what has become

<!-- page 334 -->

of her. They thought she might have come to London
with you. I told them that was impossible.
They are heart-broken; they don't know where she is.</p>

<p>Roger received this blow full in his breast. He
had not feared anything, he had no preparation for it.
It came upon him like the fire of a shooting party,
when a man is condemned to die. The solid earth
swam round him. He heard the hesitating words
come one by one, singing through the air like bullets;
and yet he did not know even now what it meant.</p>

<!-- page 335 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXI">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXI.</p>

<p class="small">THREE BROTHERS.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the end, however, this dreadful news, which Edmund
had thought would kill his brother, had little or
no effect upon him. The idea that Lily had in any
way compromised herself, that anything disgraceful
could be involved, or that there was wrong in it, was
one which Roger was incapable of receiving. He was
stunned for the moment by the mere wonder, but recovered
himself almost immediately. "And she left
no letter, gave them no clue?" he said, gravely
enough, yet with a smile breaking through beneath
the seriousness of his lips.</p>

<p>"None, whatever," replied Edmund, watching his
brother keenly, with the strangest new suspicions and
doubts springing up in his mind.</p>

<p>Roger said nothing for a minute or two; and then,
shaking his head, "What unreasoning creatures women
are, the best of them! Do you think she could
suppose it possible that I would be shaken off like
that?"</p>

<p>"Shaken off&mdash;like what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what is the matter with you, Ned:
you look as if you were in great trouble about something.
Not about this, I hope. Don't you see it is as
clear as daylight? She is frightened of me, poor darling.
She thinks her father will lose his place, and his
home, and all his comforts. It is just like a girl's

<!-- page 336 -->

inconsequent way. If she removes herself out of the
question, she thinks all will be well. No doubt she is
hiding somewhere, with her poor little heart beating,
wondering if we will really let her get lost and sacrifice
herself. My poor, little, silly, sweet Lily! She
has read too many novels, no doubt: she thinks that's
the best way,&mdash;to make a sacrifice of herself."</p>

<p>Edmund looked with a certain awe at his brother's
face, lit up with the tenderest smile. Roger was not
thinking of any danger to her, nor of how other
people were affected, nor of anything but the romantic,
generous girl, following, perhaps, some example
in a novel, as little reasonable as any heroine of romance.
And was not she a heroine of romance, the
true romance which never fails or is out of fashion,&mdash;and
was not this unreason the most exquisite thing
in the world? He did not observe that his brother
made no answer; that Edmund gave him one wondering
glance only, and then averted his eyes. Roger
required no answer; his mind was altogether absorbed
in this intelligence, which he received in so
different a way from that which his brother feared.</p>

<p>"We mustn't leave her too long in that thought,"
said Roger, cheerfully. "It's curious how sweet that
want of reason is,&mdash;don't you think so? No, you're
too matter of fact, Ned; and besides, you have not
fallen under the spell. What do they think? Or
rather, where do they think she can have taken refuge,&mdash;with
some old aunt, or old friend, or something?
They must have made some guess."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. They thought, and they almost
persuaded me to think, that you had brought her here
with you."</p>

<p>"I bring her here with me!"</p>

<!-- page 337 -->

<p>"I knew, of course, it was absurd," said Edmund,
averting his eyes.</p>

<p>"There is a kind of unreason that is not sweet,"
said Roger quickly. "What did they suppose I could
have done that for? And it was so likely she would
have come with me, her only half-accepted&mdash;when it
is evident it's to escape me, to sacrifice herself, that
she's gone away." He got up, and began to pace about
the room. "This becomes a little disagreeable," he
said. "With me! What a strange idea! The most
sensitive, delicate&mdash;why, you might almost say prudish&mdash;&mdash;
And why, in the name of all that's ridiculous,
could I have wished her to come with me?"</p>

<p>"That is what I felt," Edmund said, but still with
averted eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, Ned," said Roger, "that's the worst of it.
These good, honest people! things that would horrify
us seem natural to them. They would see nothing out
of the question in such an impossible proceeding,
to show her London, perhaps, or consult her about
our future arrangements?" He laughed, with a faint
awakening of uneasiness. "And all the time she is
in some nook in the country, some old woman's cottage,
thinking how clever she has been to hide herself
from everybody, but yet perhaps wondering&mdash;&mdash; I
wonder if she is wondering whether I am no more
good than that, whether I will let her go"&mdash;&mdash; He
paused a little, his voice melting into the softness of
a mother with her child; then he said quickly, "We
must get at once the directions of all the old aunts."</p>

<p>"They have no directions to give," observed Edmund,
in a low tone; "there seems to be no one they
can think of. And the strange thing is that she appears
to have come to London the day before yesterday,

<!-- page 338 -->

in the same train with you, Roger,&mdash;from Molton
Junction, so far as I can make out, where it
seems she sent off a telegram, having walked there."</p>

<p>"This is more mysterious than ever," said Roger,
growing red under his eyes, "but also more natural
than ever. Of course she must have telegraphed to
the house she was going to. Of course London is the
way to everywhere; or she might even have a friend
in town. Of course they must know of some one.
You don't mean to say that they have no relations, no
friends, out of Melcombe? Come, Edmund," he said,
giving his brother a sudden sharp pat on the shoulder,
"wake yourself up! We must find our way out of
this; we are not going to be outgeneraled by a simple
girl. How strange," he continued, after a moment,
"that I didn't see her! Now I think of it, I did see
some one in the crowd at Molton who reminded me&mdash;&mdash;
To be sure&mdash;&mdash; I said to myself, If I did not know
she was safe at home&mdash;&mdash; And, after all, I never
thought of looking when we got to Paddington. By
the way"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What, Roger?"</p>

<p>"It has just occurred to me. I saw Stephen at the
station; he was going to meet one of the men of his
regiment. He may have seen her. I suppose he
knows her,&mdash;by sight, at least?"</p>

<p>"Most probably," answered Edmund, scarcely
knowing how to command his voice.</p>

<p>"And no one could see her without remarking her.
Steve may have noticed, Ned; he may have seen
whether any one met her, or what way she went.
The moment I have swallowed my coffee," (which
had in the mean time grown cold on the table, and
which was the only part of an ample breakfast which

<!-- page 339 -->

Roger seemed inclined to touch), "I'll go and look
him up."</p>

<p>"Let me go," Edmund suggested. "I am ready
now; and it will be easier for me, who have no special
interest, to make inquiries than for you."</p>

<p>"No special interest," said Roger, with an unsteady
laugh. "If it didn't happen to be my brother Ned's
way to think of everybody's interests before his
own"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because I have none in particular, you see," returned
Edmund, waving his hand as he hurried away.
He was too glad to find himself outside Roger's door,
and under no further necessity to veil the changes of
his countenance. It had gone to his heart like a sudden
arrow to hear that Stephen had been seen at the
station going to meet some one. Whom was he going
to meet, and what would he say, and how reply to the
questions that must be forced upon him? Edmund
had no faith in Stephen's reply. He had no faith in
him in any way, nor any hope of satisfaction from
him. If only he could keep Roger from suspecting,
and prevent any meeting from which enlightenment
could come!</p>

<p>Stephen was not to be found at his club, though it
was known there that he was in town. He was not to
be found at the rooms where he generally lived when
in London. The people there knew nothing of Captain
Mitford's whereabouts; they did not believe he was in
town; they had seen nothing of him: from which Edmund
drew the conclusion, which was far from reassuring,
that Stephen had established himself somewhere
else. He went back to the club a second time,
after seeking his brother in every other quarter he
could think of, and was again disappointed. But as

<!-- page 340 -->

he turned away from the door, sadly cast down, and
feeling himself baffled at every turn, he met Stephen
coming along Piccadilly, in all the splendor of his
town clothes, with that additional exquisite neatness
of detail which the military element gives. Stephen
was very triumphant to behold, in his strength and
fullness of life: his hair exuberant in a hundred curls,
his step spurning the pavement, his whole appearance
the perfection of health and cleanness and superlative
polish and care. Another man, equally splendid,
brushed, and shaven, and smoothed into perfection,
walked with him, and Edmund, in his country habiliments
and with his anxious mind, felt himself a
shabby shadow beside those dazzling specimens of
their kind. His brother was passing him, with two
fingers extended to be shaken, and a "Hallo, Ned!"
when Edmund came to a stand before him, and compelled
him to pause. Stephen's companion paused,
too, with momentary suspicion, then passed along,
saying something under his mustache of seeing him
again at the club. They were quite near the club,
and Edmund read in Stephen's face the contrariety
of being so near shelter and yet caught. For he saw
in a moment that the splendor of his brother's appearance
was but outside, and that his face was not as
radiant as his clothes.</p>

<p>"Well," cried Stephen, "I thought you had gone
home, Ned. It seems to me you are getting as bad as
the worst of us, always about town."</p>

<p>"I have come up on special business," said Edmund,
and he thought the splendid Stephen winced a
little, as if he might have a suspicion what that business
was.</p>

<p>"Really! So have I,&mdash;with that fellow that left

<!-- page 341 -->

us just now; he's gone to wait for me at the club. I
owe him a trifle. I'll see you another time."</p>

<p>"My business is very much with you," replied Edmund,
"but I'll walk with you. I need not detain
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, about the will," said his brother, with a laugh.
"I heard from the governor to-day. It's all right,
old fellow. I'll take it like a shot; I've no delicacy.
If Roger and you choose to be a couple of fools, what
does that matter to me?"</p>

<p>"There is something else which matters, though,"
answered Edmund, sternly. "You know why Roger
is out of it. So far as I can hear, the same reason
stands against you."</p>

<p>"What!" said Stephen, "that I am going to
marry? Not a bit of it. Not such a fool, thank you.
I've no more thought of marrying than you have, and
little inclination that way." His color heightened,
however, and his breath quickened, and he did not
meet Edmund's eye.</p>

<p>"It is not marriage; it is&mdash;Lily Ford."</p>

<p>"Well," cried his brother, turning upon him sharply,
"what of her? The little damned jilt; the"&mdash;&mdash; He
paused, with an evident sense of having committed
himself, and added angrily, "What the devil has she
got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Much; for she belongs to our immediate surroundings,
and my father will never put up with an
injury to a person who is really one of his household.
She must be restored to her family at once."</p>

<p>"Restored!" exclaimed Stephen, with a harsh laugh.
"You speak at your ease, my friend Ned. You must
have a thing before you can restore it. I've had
nothing to say to the lady, and therefore I can't give
her back."</p>

<!-- page 342 -->

<p>"We had better go somewhere where we can talk
with more safety. These are not subjects for the club
or Piccadilly."</p>

<p>"Piccadilly has heard as much as most places, and
so has the club; and I don't know what there is to
talk about."</p>

<p>"Stephen, where is Lily Ford?"</p>

<p>Stephen swore a big oath under his breath.
"What have I to do with Lily Ford? If you are
trying to put blame upon me, mind what you are
about, Ned; I'm not a safe man to meddle with.
If you mean to spoil my luck with got-up stories"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She came to London on Tuesday night," interrupted
Edmund, abstractly, as if he were summing
up evidence, "and you met her at the station. Where
is she now? If you will tell me that, I will ask you
no further questions."</p>

<p>"Who told you I met her at the station? You are
making up fables against me."</p>

<p>"Stephen, where is Lily Ford?"</p>

<p>It was in Piccadilly, with all the people passing;
impossible to make any scene there, had life and
death been in it. Edmund's voice was low, but Stephen
had no habit of subduing his tones or controlling
himself, and he was already excited. The fury
of a man baffled, disappointed, tricked,&mdash;for so he
thought it,&mdash;whose victim had turned the tables
on him, and placed him in the position of a fool
instead of that of a scoundrel, raged within him,
and it was a relief to vent it upon some one. He
griped his brother's arm with a sudden force which
took Edmund by surprise and made him stagger, and
he swore again by the highest name. "By &mdash;&mdash;! I

<!-- page 343 -->

don't know. And if I did I shouldn't tell you. I'll
break the head of any man who asks me such a question
again. Stand out of the way!"</p>

<p>Edmund's arm was raised instinctively to resist the
push aside which his brother gave him, as Stephen released
him from his grasp. But already the altercation
had caught the eyes of two or three passers-by,
and Edmund had an Englishman's dread of exposure
and horror of making an exhibition of himself. He
stepped back, answering only with a look the insolent
gaze which Stephen fixed upon him, and in which
there was an uneasy inquiry, an alarm which neutralized
the defiance. It was not a light matter to submit
to such rough treatment, but a quarrel in the open
street, and above all in Piccadilly, was the last thing
in the world to be thought of, as Stephen, cowardly in
his audacious selfishness, well knew. Edmund let his
brother brush past, and after a moment turned back
in the other direction, silent while his heart burned.
Stephen was fully aware that Edmund would make
no public quarrel, and took advantage of it, as bullies
do.</p>

<p>Edmund had said more than he was sure of, without
premeditation, in the haste and heat of his first
address to his brother. "You met her at the station."
He had not been aware that he meant to say
this until he heard himself saying it. But he had
no doubt now that Stephen was guilty; the very absence
of all hesitation in his response, his instant comprehension
of the question, made it apparent that Stephen
had nothing to learn in respect to Lily's flight.
And God help the unfortunate girl if she were in
his ruthless hands! God help the miserable parents,
to whom Edmund could not have a word of comfort
to say!</p>

<!-- page 344 -->

<p>His heart was very heavy as he went along amid
the stream of people flowing towards the park. It
was afternoon by this time, and the carriages had begun
to follow each other in a long line. Everything
looked bright and gay, with that impression of endless
prosperity, wealth, ease, and luxury which few other
scenes convey to a similar degree. No doubt, among
that luxurious crowd there was no lack of sad histories,
aching hearts, unhappy parents, and ruined
children; but the glitter and splendor seemed to
carry the misery of his thoughts deeper into his heart.</p>

<p>Until all at once he woke to a terror near to himself,
a danger which touched him more than anything
that had happened, or could happen, to Lily Ford.</p>

<!-- page 345 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXII.</p>

<p class="small">STEPHEN'S ANSWER.</p>

</div>

<p>THIS terror which seized Edmund did not come
upon him for the first time: he had already perceived
the supreme danger of making known his suspicions
of Stephen to Roger; but there had been enough in
the inquisition which was forced into his hands, and
the question whether or not Stephen were really guilty,
to distract his thoughts. Now, however, that he must
carry back to Roger Stephen's disavowal, a disavowal
which could, he said to himself, convince nobody, and
which was of something quite different from the simple
question which Roger had intended to put, a real
panic seized upon him. Lily's disappearance was not
an event which could be forgotten. It was not a thing
of the moment, which could pass out of recollection,
with all its attendant circumstances, when its novelty
was exhausted. Had it been the father and mother
alone, poor, helpless, miserable people, they might
have been silenced somehow, and the cause of this
misfortune concealed. But Roger would leave no
stone unturned; he would resolutely clear up the mystery,
and seek the girl whom he had loved, so bitterly
to his own cost, until at least he had found that the
Lily of his dreams was lost forever. Edmund shuddered
to think what would befall his brother when he
made this discovery: but more terrible still was the
thought of what would happen when, in that search,

<!-- page 346 -->

Roger was brought face to face with the man who
bore his own name, his father's son, his own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>In a state of distraction, the third of the sons of
Melcombe, he who must stand between the two thus
made deadly enemies, divided by a wrong which could
never be forgotten or forgiven, dwelt upon this inevitable
discovery, and hurrying through the streets,
unconscious of the crowd, turned over and over in his
confused mind every expedient by which it could be
averted. A thousand schemes passed wildly before
him, only to be rejected. He laughed within himself
at the futile suggestion that Roger might be persuaded
to go away, to withdraw from the scene of his loss,
that first thought which occurs to every Englishman
in trouble. It was not so long since he had himself
hurried his brother over the <i>banal</i> road into the commonplace
resorts of weariness and wretchedness. That
was not to be done again; and on what pretense, till
Lily was proved unworthy, could Roger be driven from
the new life he had planned? And how was Lily to
be accounted for without the unveiling of that most
horrible complication of all, and the revelation of the
destroyer of Roger's hopes and dreams in his brother?</p>

<p>Edmund felt himself paralyzed by this terror, which
he saw no way of escaping. He was as helpless as he
was panic-stricken, and wandered about for the rest of
the day, with no aim but to keep out of Roger's way,
and no power to originate any expedient by which he
might stave off the danger.</p>

<p>At last the moment came which could not have
been long avoided. He met Roger at the end of the
street in which their rooms were, about the hour of
dinner, and for a moment hoped that he was going

<!-- page 347 -->

out to fill some engagement, and that there might still
be a breathing time.</p>

<p>Roger had just come out, dressed for dinner, with a
light overcoat over his evening clothes; and it seemed
to Edmund, who was still in his country suit, not fit
for London, and sadly worn out and wretched, that
the mere fact of his careful dress showed that his
brother had shaken off the impression of the bad
news. But when he saw more distinctly, by the uncertain
evening light, Roger's face, white and rigid,
with the upper lip closed down upon the lower, as if
made of iron, he was quickly undeceived. As soon
as they met, Roger put his arm within Edmund's, and
turned him round in the direction in which he was
himself going, with that ignoring of his brother's inclinations,
even of his weariness and bodily needs,
which is in some cases the highest compliment one
man can pay to another.</p>

<p>"Ned," he began, without any preface, "the more
I think of it, the more wretched it makes me. Was
she a girl to disappear like that, leaving her people in
anxiety? Besides, what motive was there for any
such mystery? She might have let them know somehow,&mdash;she
must have done so. Ned, my Lily has
been spirited away!"</p>

<p>Edmund was taken by surprise. "No, no&mdash;who
would do that?" he asked, bewildered by the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Who? Any one. Some madman who had seen
her. We think we have outlived such things, but we
haven't, Ned. Passion is as mad as ever it was. Or
even to get her out of my way, my father"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Impossible! Such a thing would never enter his
mind!"</p>

<!-- page 348 -->

<p>"There is nothing impossible!" returned Roger,
with nervous heat, "except that my Lily should go&mdash;should
consent"&mdash;&mdash; The deep murmur of his voice
ceased in something inarticulate, a note of such immeasurable
pain, of horrible doubt hidden under words
of certainty, that Edmund felt all his fears realized.
Then Roger gave himself a shake, as if to get rid of
some nightmare, and asked, with an air of sudden
awakening, "Did Stephen see her? Did he notice
anything&mdash;which way she went?"</p>

<p>"No, he noticed nothing."</p>

<p>Something in Edmund's tone made Roger look at
him keenly. "He must have seen her. I could bring
it to his recollection,&mdash;the night we met and the circumstances,
which of course you did not know."</p>

<p>"Don't, Roger, for Heaven's sake! Why should
you ask him again? Don't you believe me? He
knows nothing. Don't let us bring in any one more."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," said Roger, with momentary
acquiescence; then, after a pause, he asked,
"Did he know her&mdash;at all?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," replied Edmund hastily, feeling
that the intolerableness of the situation began to affect
his nerves and temper. "I suppose he must
have known her by sight: I don't know. What is
the use of bringing him into it? He can tell us nothing."</p>

<p>Roger looked at his brother with a dawning suspicion
in his eyes. "I don't think you are just to
Stephen," he remarked. "I am going to see for myself."</p>

<p>"Roger," said Edmund, making use, like a woman,
of the weariness and exhaustion which he felt,&mdash;though,
like a woman, he could have disguised and

<!-- page 349 -->

suppressed them, had not the other way afforded a
possibility of deliverance,&mdash;"I wish you could come
with me first, and get me some dinner. I am fairly
worn out. It has not been a good time for me, these
last few days, and I have been wandering about from
one place to another"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How selfish I am," interrupted Roger, "forgetting
all you have been doing, and even to ask you&mdash;&mdash;
Come along, Ned; we'll get something at the club."</p>

<p>The penalty of this expedient was, that Edmund
had to eat a prolonged dinner, which he needed, indeed,
but for which he had no appetite, and which he
allowed to linger on, through course after course while
Roger sat opposite to him, eating nervously a piece of
bread, drinking the wine that was poured out for him
without even observing what it was, sending away
dish after dish with a half shudder of disgust, and
with the wonder of a preoccupied mind that his
brother should be capable of dining in so prolonged a
way at such a moment. Edmund had to pay this
penalty, and accepted it with what fortitude he could.
He calculated, while he sat having everything handed
to him, that by this time, probably, Stephen was disposed
of for the evening; dining out, perhaps; or,
which was more likely,&mdash;the horrible thought obtruded
itself, even though it was so essential that he
should give Roger no clue to the nature of his thoughts,&mdash;that
Stephen might be at this moment by the side
of the deceived and lost creature to whom Roger, with
his white face of anxiety, was still holding loyally as
his bride.</p>

<p>"Now," said Roger, with a faint smile, "if you are
satisfied, Ned, don't you think we might go?"</p>

<p>If he were satisfied! He tried to laugh, too, and

<!-- page 350 -->

answered, "I had eaten nothing all day. Don't you
think it is a little too late now?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;&mdash; You shall go home and go to bed,
Ned. You're worn out: and it cannot have the same
overwhelming interest for you as for me,&mdash;though
you're very good," said Roger. It was Edmund's
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> to have good intentions attributed to him. He
took care not even to smile, not to groan, as he got
up from the table at which he had been working so
hard to make the meeting he dreaded impossible.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "I'm not going to bed. I'm
going with you, Roger, wherever you go,&mdash;provided
it is not among any of your fine friends, in this
garb."</p>

<p>"My fine friends!" exclaimed Roger, with indignant
astonishment. "Can you suppose me capable
of going anywhere&mdash;anywhere! I thought you knew
better what this is to me. Do you know what it is?
It is life or death! If anything has happened to
<i>her</i>&mdash;&mdash; My God!"</p>

<p>The most tragic scenes, the most tragic words, are
often mixed up in our strange life with the most petty
and common, and desperate appeals to the last Arbiter
of all things rise out of the depths of wretched hearts
over the broken meats of a disordered table. There
is something more heart-rending in them, under such
circumstances, than when there is no jar of the ignoble
matters of every day in the despair and passion.
Roger standing over the table at which his brother
had dined, in his correct evening dress, with his miserable
face; the brown bread which he had been
crumbling to pieces before him; his overcoat, which
he had not cared to take off, hanging open; the background
of cheerful parties dining; the murmur of

<!-- page 351 -->

cheerful talk around, made such a combination as
would have smitten the hardest heart. He had come
to that, that he had begun to acknowledge the possibility
of something having happened to Lily: something
which could not but be disastrous, horrible; something
which might make an end of that which no
other power on earth could have ended, for which he
had been prepared to sacrifice everything that could
be called life. There was a tremor in him which was
visible, even though he was nervously erect and steady,
in the outline of his figure,&mdash;a faint, nervous trick of
movement which he could not restrain, and of which,
indeed, he was unconscious. He put his hand hastily
upon Edmund's arm, as they went out together. It
was dry and burning, and he did not see the step at
the door, and stumbled as they went out into the noise
and bustle of the street.</p>

<p>Provided only that Stephen might not be found
when they sought him at his club!&mdash;for happily they
could not seek him elsewhere. Edmund estimated
the chances hurriedly, as they went along, and felt
them to be all in his favor. If Lily were somewhere
in London awaiting her lover, it was not possible that
Stephen should spend the evening at his club. But
Edmund was too anxious and too unhappy to take the
comfort out of this which he felt to be justified; for
every one knows how perverse circumstances are, and
how a chance which would have no importance on another
occasion will often detain a man, when his detention
for that uncalculated moment means a catastrophe.
So inscrutable, so little to be reckoned upon,
is this strange life, which seems the sport of accidents,
which is at least so little in our hands to arrange or
settle! These thoughts went through Edmund's mind

<!-- page 352 -->

in a confused torrent, as he walked with Roger to
Stephen's club, once more along that crowded pavement
of Piccadilly, where so many men like themselves
were hurrying on to all manner of engagements,
and close to which so many carriages, coming and
going, conveyed the fairest and the brightest and the
most distinguished from one scene of pleasure to another,&mdash;of
pleasure woven with so many threads of
suffering, of festivity, and of tragedy. When the
mind is full of distress and anxiety, such ideas come
naturally. It is perhaps a little aid in bearing our
own burdens to think how others are weighed down,
and how little any one can know from the exterior.</p>

<p>It would have been, however, but a poor observer
who could not have perceived that the two brothers
walking along from one club to another were bound
on no common errand. The faint yet almost palsied
thrill of nervous movement about Roger, and Edmund's
fever of anxiety, were not sufficiently veiled
to be imperceptible to any keen eye. Neither of them
seemed to breathe, as they approached the place. Edmund,
who knew how well his own excitement was justified,
could not quite understand how it should have so
communicated itself to Roger, who so far as he knew
was unaware of any foundation for it. He pressed
his brother's arm, as they went up to the open door.
"Roger, you'll take care not to let him pick a quarrel!
He was very impatient of my question; he may
be still more so to have it repeated. A row in the
family, between brothers"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should we quarrel? What reason is there
for any row?" Roger said sternly, and Edmund had
no answer to give.</p>

<p>Stephen was there,&mdash;up-stairs. They went in together,

<!-- page 353 -->

Roger first, Edmund scarcely able to breathe.
A group of men were descending as they went up,
and on the landing the two brothers perceived Stephen,
the last of the band. His companions were
talking and laughing, but he was coming down silently,
with an angry cloud on his face. The two
young men waited for him on the landing, which gave
them full time to note his aspect and the unusual
gravity of his looks; but he did not observe them, so
occupied was he with his own thoughts, till he was
close upon them. Then Roger put out his hand and
touched him on the arm. Stephen started, and raised
his eyes with a sudden gleam of impatience: evidently
he was not in a temper to be disturbed. But when he
saw who it was, a look of fury came into his eyes,&mdash;they
were very light eyes, which looked sinister in excitement.
"Hallo!" he cried, "you there again!"
He passed over Roger with intention, and fixed his
look upon Edmund, who stood behind.</p>

<p>"Stephen," said Roger, "I have a question to ask
you." He was drawing his breath quickly and with
difficulty.</p>

<p>"I presume," said Stephen slowly, scowling, drawing
back a little, "it's the same question as that fellow
put to me to-day. What the &mdash;&mdash; is it your business
whether I know or whether I don't know? I
told him I'd break any man's head that asked me
that again!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you must give me an answer," returned
Roger, making a step forward. The question
had not been put into words; there seemed no need
between them for any such details. Neither of his
brothers was in the least aware what it was which
brought such fury into Stephen's eyes and tone.

<!-- page 354 -->

Roger, who accused him of nothing, whose question
was in reality of the most simple character, was irritated
by an opposition which appeared so uncalled for.
He advanced a little as Stephen drew back. "If you
have any light to throw upon the matter, for Heaven's
sake answer me," he said, putting up his hand, as
Stephen thought, to seize him by the coat.</p>

<p>There was in the younger brother a fury which had
no means of utterance, which caught at the first possibility
of getting vent. He pushed Roger back with a
violence of which he was himself totally unaware. "I
warned him&mdash;the first man that asked me that question
again!" he cried savagely, thrusting his brother
from him with all his force. They were all three on
the edge of the heavy stone stairs, none of them conscious
or thinking of any danger. Perhaps there would
have been no danger if Roger had been in his ordinary
condition of health. As it was, before a word could
be said or a breath drawn, before Stephen was aware
of the violence of the thrust backward which he had
given, Roger went down like a stone. There was a
breathless, horrible moment, while the two who were
left looked involuntarily into each other's faces: then
Edmund, with a spring, reached the bottom of the
stairs, where all huddled upon himself, like a fallen
house, his brother lay. In a moment&mdash;it was no more:
as if a flash of lightning had come out of the sky and
struck him down there.</p>

<!-- page 355 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE SHADOW OF DEATH.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE is something in the atmosphere of a sick-room
in which a man lies under the shadow of death, especially
when that awful shadow has come upon the
sky in a moment, which changes the entire aspect of
the world to those who stand at the bedside. There
had been a moment of horror and dismay, in which
Stephen's bewilderment and terror-stricken compunction
had obliterated all feeling of guilt on his part
from his brother's mind. Indeed, the catastrophe was
so unlooked for, and seemed so entirely beyond any
cause that could have brought it about, that the two
brothers bent over Roger with equal anxiety, equal
alarm and astonishment, forgetting everything but the
sudden shock as of a thunderbolt falling, striking him
down at their feet. Edmund had no time or power to
think, during the turmoil and horrible pause which
ensued, which might have lasted, so far as he knew, a
day or ten minutes, in which Roger was examined by
a grave doctor, who said little, and was then painfully
transported to his own rooms and laid on his own bed.
He had not recovered consciousness for a moment, nor
did he during the long, terrible night which followed,
in the course of which Edmund sat like a man paralyzed,
within sight of the motionless figure, for which
there was nothing to be done, none of those cares
which keep the watcher from despair. The doctor had

<!-- page 356 -->

sent in a nurse, who, after vainly endeavoring to induce
Edmund to withdraw ("For he doesn't know
you, or any one, nor won't, perhaps, ever again, poor
gentleman! And what's the good of wearing yourself
out, when you can do nothing for him?" she had said,
with that appalling reasonableness which kills), had
herself retired to the next room, provident, as her class
always are, of the rest which would be so needful to
her, in face of whatever might occur to demand her
watchfulness afterwards. Her words, her look, made
Edmund's heart sick, and the realization of the fact
that there was nothing to be done, and that, whether
for always or only for a time, Roger was beyond all
possibility of succor, came over him with a sudden
blankness of desolation. He knew nothing of illness,
especially of illness so extraordinary and terrible. He
felt that he could not tell from moment to moment
what might be accomplishing itself on the curtainless
bed, where Roger's profile, stern in the silence, showed
itself against the faintly colored wall. He sat there
himself in a sort of trance of despair and anguish and
deadly fear. His brother might die at any instant, for
anything Edmund knew; the life which was already
hidden and veiled might depart altogether, without a
hand being held out to save. The horror of doing
nothing, of sitting still, and perhaps seeing the precious
life ebb away without putting out a finger, without an
effort, as Edmund felt, was almost beyond bearing.
He himself could do nothing,&mdash;he knew nothing that
could be done. If the doctor had but remained, who
knew! but the doctor had said that to watch the patient
was all that was possible. And Edmund was
watching, Heaven knew how anxiously! yet in his ignorance
feeling that some change might occur which he

<!-- page 357 -->

would not observe, would not understand, and on which
might hang the issues of life and death. Half a dozen
times he had risen to call the nurse, that there might
be some one who would know; then had restrained
himself and noiselessly sat down again, remembering
what she had said, and half afraid of crossing or irritating
the attendant on whose services, for aught he
knew, Roger's life might depend. He felt like a fool,
or a child, so ignorant, so helpless, so ready to be seized
with unreasonable panic,&mdash;surely unreasonable, since
both doctor and nurse had felt themselves at liberty to
go away. It was about nine o'clock when the catastrophe
had occurred, and by midnight it seemed to
Edmund as if years had passed over him in that awful
stillness, and as if everything in life had receded far
away. By the bed where Roger lay unconscious there
was no longer anything worth thinking of, except
whether he would open his eyes, whether the hardness
of his breathing would soften, whether any sign of life
would break through that blank. Lily Ford?&mdash;who
was she, what was she? If her name swept, in the
current of his thoughts, over Edmund's mind at all, he
was impatient of it, and flung it from him, like something
intrusive and impertinent. All the associations
that had occupied his thoughts for days past went from
him like vanities. He remembered them no more, or,
if they recurred, brushed them from his mind, with indignant
astonishment that such nothings could ever
have occupied it. What was there to think of in all
the world but that Roger lay there, an image of death
in life, wrapped in darkness, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;a
horror that made his heart stand still&mdash;might
never come out of it again?</p>

<p>At midnight Stephen came in, trying, no doubt, to

<!-- page 358 -->

walk softly and speak softly; opening the door with a
creak, and stepping upon some loose plank in the flooring,
which shivered and jarred under his foot. "How
is he now?" he asked in a rough whisper, which seemed
to Edmund's strained faculties more penetrating, more
disagreeable, than any ordinary noise. Stephen made
a step forward elaborately, and looked at the face
upon the pillow. "Don't look much better, does he?"
he said. In reality Stephen was very uncomfortable,&mdash;more
than uncomfortable. He had not meant to
do his brother any harm,&mdash;he had repeated that assurance
to himself a hundred times within the last
hour. He never meant to harm him,&mdash;why should
he? He had no motive for injuring his brother: they
had always been good friends. What had happened
about their father's will was nothing. There was no
possible reason in that for quarreling with Roger, for
he was quite out it, and had nothing to say in the matter.
Nobody would do Stephen the wrong to say that
he had any bad meaning. How could he know that a
man, a man as big as himself, would go down like that
at a touch? It was no fault of his: there must have
been something the matter with the poor old fellow, or
he must have been standing unsteadily, or&mdash;but certainly
it was not Stephen who was to blame. He had
repeated this to himself all the way, as he went along
the streets. How could he be to blame?</p>

<p>"For God's sake, be quiet,&mdash;don't disturb him!"
said Edmund, with an impatience that was uncontrollable.
Disturb him! He would have given everything
he had in the world to be able to disturb Roger,&mdash;to
draw him out of that fatal lethargy; but the
sound of Stephen's jarring step, and the whisper
which whistled through this sacred place, roused Edmund
to a fever of suppressed passion.</p>

<!-- page 359 -->

<p>"Oh, nothing disturbs a man in that state. I've
seen 'em," Stephen said, taking less precautions as he
became familiar with the darkened room, the aspect
of everything, "when you might have fired a cannon-ball
close to their ears, and they would have taken no
notice. When is the doctor to come back? Are you
going to sit up all night? I thought he had sent in a
nurse. Then what's the use of you sitting up? You
can't do him any good."</p>

<p>"I can't talk," Edmund answered; "don't ask me
any questions. We can only wait and see what the
morning brings."</p>

<p>Stephen nodded in assent. He stooped over the
bed, looked at the motionless figure, and shook his
head. "Poor chap!" he said, "he looks very bad."
Stephen was very uncomfortable, but he did not know
how to express it. He stood swaying from one foot
to the other, looking blankly about him. "I don't
suppose I can be of any use," he said.</p>

<p>"None, none!" replied Edmund. "Nobody can be
of any use."</p>

<p>"You'd rather I should go?" asked Stephen, glad
to escape, yet reluctant to show it. "I shouldn't if
I could be of any use; but if I can't&mdash;&mdash; Look here,
Ned, call the woman, and go to bed yourself; you
can't do him any good, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, go, go!" Edmund said.</p>

<p>"And, Ned&mdash;as for what he asked me, poor chap!
You may think it isn't true, but it is true. I declare
to you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake," cried Edmund, under his
breath, "go away, go home, go to bed! What does
it matter? What does anything matter? Do I care
whether it is true or not? Go, go!"</p>

<!-- page 360 -->

<p>"You speak as if I hadn't as good a right&mdash;as if
you thought I meant to&mdash;to do him harm. I never
meant to do him harm, so help me"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go now, Stephen, go home and go to bed. He
may be better in the morning."</p>

<p>"Poor chap!" Stephen said once more, shaking
his head; and then creaking more than ever, like his
father, making the boards jar and the room shake, he
went away.</p>

<p>And again that awful silence came over the place,&mdash;a
silence which thrilled and vibrated with dreadful
meaning, till even the interruption of Stephen's
presence seemed to have been a gain. Edmund sat
still and motionless, his heart within him in a fever
of suspense, and fear and agitation indescribable rioting
his bosom with an independent, mad life of unendurable
pain. How he kept still, how he did not
cry out, spring up from his watch, drag back by any
violent means the dead, dumb, marble image which
was his brother, to life, to life, to any kind of conscious
being, even if it were agony, he could not tell.
But something, whether it was reason, whether it was
the mere solidity of flesh and blood, which bound the
raging anxiety of the soul, kept him almost as still as
Roger; watching, wondering what was to come, and
how he was to live through this awful night.</p>

<p>The morning brought little hope; and then ensued
days upon days, of which Edmund knew nothing except
that they came and passed and brought no
change. Stephen appeared from time to time, stealing
in with elaborate precautions, making every board
creak,&mdash;as if it mattered! And presently the Squire
arrived, like a larger Stephen, looking at the patient
in the same helpless way, shaking his head. The

<!-- page 361 -->

father's sanction was necessary before the dangerous
operation, which was the only thing in which there
was a glimmer of hope, could be attempted. Mr.
Mitford was far from being without feeling. To see
his son, his first-born, of whom he had been proud,
lying on that bed, which was too evidently a bed of
death, affected him deeply. He had asked a great
many questions at first, and had been inclined to
blame everybody. "Why did you let him question
Steve? Steve never would stand questioning, from a
child. Why didn't you warn Steve that he was ill?
He must have been ill, or a mere push could not have
harmed him. Was it only a push? It must have
been more than a push. They had a scuffle, I suppose,
on the stairs! By &mdash;&mdash;! how could you be such
a fool as to let two men in the heat of a quarrel meet on
the stairs?" Thus he talked, in his large voice, with
an angry cloud upon his face, as he came up-stairs.
But when he entered Roger's room the Squire was
silenced. He stood and looked at his son with angry,
helpless wretchedness, making a little sound of half-remonstrant
trouble with his tongue against his palate.
What could he do? What could be done?
To know that it was all over would have been nothing
compared to the misery of seeing him there, and not
knowing what might happen at any moment. Mr.
Mitford was glad to go away, making his progress
audible by that faint sound of inarticulate perplexity
and remonstrance, and by the unsubduable tread
which shook the house. He had no objection to try
the desperate expedient of the operation, though he
did not in the least believe in it. "He's a dead
man! he's a dead man! I don't believe they can
do anything," he said, in the hurried family council

<!-- page 362 -->

which was held in an adjoining room. And Stephen
also shook his head. He was very like his father.
He had the same expression of perplexed and irritated
seriousness. He had taken up almost eagerly
the same note of remonstrance. If Ned had only
kept him quiet, kept him in-doors that night, when
anybody might have seen he was out of sorts, and not
fit to give and take, like other men. His discomfort
as to his own share in the matter was wearing off, and
he began to feel that he was an injured person, and
had a right to complain.</p>

<p>Ah! if Edmund had but been able to keep his
brother in-doors that night! He said it to himself
with a far more tragic sense of the impossibility than
the others were capable of. If only&mdash;if!&mdash;how
lightly, it now seemed, all the miseries that existed
before could have been borne. It gave him a pang
indescribable to think, as he immediately did, of how
simple it might have been,&mdash;how life might have
flowed on quite smoothly: Roger miserable, perhaps,
himself weighed down by the pressure of a secret
never to be revealed; but what of that, what trifles,
what nothings, in comparison with this!</p>

<p>He was the only one who had any hope in the operation,
though he was the last to consent to it. The
others, no doubt, would have been glad if Roger had
recovered, but they were almost as anxious to be
freed from the dreadful pressure of the situation as to
save his life: his life, if possible; but if not, that these
paralyzing circumstances might come to an end. It
was with the hope that one way or other this release
might be accomplished that Mr. Mitford and Stephen
awaited the result. They would not remain in the
room,&mdash;it was too much for them: they remained

<!-- page 363 -->

close by, in Roger's sitting-room, with all its scattered
traces of his presence. Geraldine and Amy were
there, too, with a little feminine rustle, crying from
time to time, yet not unconscious of a curiosity about
the photographs on the tables, which were not all
family photographs, and about such other revelations
as might be gleaned of the young man's independent
life; but ready to cry again, to give back all their attention
to the one absorbing subject, whenever a door
opened or a sound was heard. The Squire walked
about the room with his heavy tread, taking up and
throwing down again such articles as caught his eye,
a whip, a cane, a cigar-case, little luxuries such as in
some cases he despised. Stephen stood with his back
to the others, looking out, with a curious mingling of
compunction and resentment and self-defense in his
mind. Nobody could say he was to blame,&mdash;how
could he be to blame? Was he to know that a man
might be as weak as a cat, not fit to stand against a
push? Nobody could be expected to think of that.</p>

<p>Edmund alone stood by his unconscious brother,
while the doctors were doing their work. He alone
received the dazed, bewildered look which Roger cast
round him in the first moment of relief, like a man
awakening, yet with something awful in it, as if the
awakening were from the dead. When that vague
gaze fell upon Edmund, the sufferer recognized him for
a moment, smiled, made a motion as if to put out his
hand, and said something which was audible only as a
murmur in his throat. He was not allowed to do any
more. The doctors interfered to ordain perfect quiet,
perfect rest, the closest watch, and no excitement or
movement. The operation was successful, quite successful.
Twenty-four hours, perfect quiet, and then&mdash;&mdash;

<!-- page 364 -->

The great operator, whose every minute was worth
gold, looked into the adjoining room himself, to relieve
the anxiety of the family. "As an operation, entirely
satisfactory; everything now depends on the strength
of the patient," he said. The relief of the strain
which had been upon their nerves was great. The
girls got up from their corner with that pleasant rustle
of their skirts, and uttered little cries of pleasure and
thankfulness. Geraldine stood up before the glass
over Roger's chimney-piece to put her bonnet straight,
which had been a little disarranged, she thought, by
her crying. Amy made a little dart to a table where
there was a photograph of a woman which she had
never seen before, and turned it over to see if there
were any name or inscription. The Squire threw
down a cane with a curious silver handle which he
had been examining, and breathed forth a great sigh
of relief. "That's all right!" he said. It seemed
to all of them that the incident was over, and that
perhaps they had been unduly excited, and it had not
been so important, after all.</p>

<p>But Edmund did not move from his brother's room.
His heart was sick with that deferred hope which it is
so hard to bear. He too, for the first minute had
thought the incident was over. He took his brother's
hand and pressed it in his own, and thought he felt
a faint response. But when he was dismissed again
to his watch, and forbidden to speak or touch the
patient still hanging between life and death, his heart
sank. The room relapsed once more, after all the
silent strain and excitement, into absolute quiet.
Presently the nurse came to Edmund's side and
whispered, "He's going to sleep, sir,&mdash;the very
best thing; and you should go and take a bit of rest

<!-- page 365 -->

Nobody in this world can do without a bit of natural
rest."</p>

<p>Edmund scarcely understood what the woman said.
He did not move; he could not have risen had his life
depended upon it, nor withdrawn his eyes from the
sleeper. Was it sleep? Was it death? How could
he tell? No more than if he had been dying himself
could he have moved from his brother's side.</p>

<p>And in that sleep Roger died.</p>

<!-- page 366 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXIV">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXIV.</p>

<p class="small">A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is needless to say that this event, so unlooked
for, coming with such a shock upon them all (though
the two brothers-in-law, the husbands of Geraldine
and Amy, declared that they had never for a moment
looked for any other termination), produced
a great effect upon the family. A death in a family
always does so. There was a jar and startling
stop of all the machinery of life. The two gay young
houses in London, and the great house at Melcombe,
were shut up. Geraldine and Amy, retired from
all their pleasures, and with a good deal of sorrow for
themselves, thus withdrawn from existence, as it were,
so early in the season, crossed by a real transitory
pang, more perhaps for the horror of the catastrophe
than for the brother lost, made an occupation and distraction
for themselves in the ordering of their mourning,
which gave them a great deal to do, and a little
much-desired novelty. They had never been in mourning
before; it was a new sensation; they did not
know whether it would be becoming or the reverse.
Roger had not been much to them at any time, and if
they cried a little now and then, when they remembered,
and felt a sharp little sting of that almost remorseful
pain with which simple minds contemplate the
sweeping away of another life, while they still continue
to enjoy the sunshine, it was all that could have

<!-- page 367 -->

been expected from these two untrained and uncherished
girls. It is to be doubted even whether Roger
would have felt so much for them. Women are more
capable of having the feelings they ought to have, and
responding to the exigencies of their position, than
men.</p>

<p>At Melcombe the household lived, for the days
which elapsed between the death and burial, in a
pause of suspended excitement, with a great deal to
talk about and think about, and a solemnity which
was not unpleasant. Some of the old servants were
truly grieved for Mr. Roger, but the subdued bustle
in the funereal house, the continual succession of
events, the comparison of facts and reports, the making
out so far as they could of an extremely exciting
story, and even the new mourning into which they
were all put, men and women, with a fullness of provision
which they felt showed the most real respect for
the dead, occupied their minds and aroused their interest,&mdash;quickened,
in short, their entire mental being.
They all knew&mdash;though how, nobody could have
told&mdash;that Stephen was somehow connected with his
brother's death; they all speculated as to what Lily
Ford had to do with it. Was it jealousy? What
was it? It was known by this time that Lily Ford
was no longer in her father's house. Indeed, Mrs.
Ford proclaimed the fact to everybody, saying that
her daughter was staying with some of her grand
friends, and that she was glad of it, for Lily was
very tender-hearted, and would have felt Mr. Roger's
death dreadful. The Fords, indeed, entirely confounded
the ingenuity of the servants' hall. Larkins,
who was aware of that distracted visit to Edmund,
had put on his most sympathetic face the next

<!-- page 368 -->

time he had met the gamekeeper's wife. "I hope,
ma'am, that you've better news," he had said in a
most mournful and confidential tone. "Oh, thank
you, sir, I've had the best of news, and am just as
happy as can be," she had responded cheerfully, taking
him much by surprise. There was a mystery, but
no one had even a guess what the mystery was.</p>

<p>The family, as was natural, assembled at Melcombe
for the funeral, filling the house with guests and a
kind of gloomy entertainment for three or four days.
Poor Roger was laid, with "every respect," with all
honor, in the family vault, a black-robed group of
mourners, with respectfully bowed heads, standing
round the coffin, which was concealed from sight, it
need not be said, by wreaths of the most beautiful
flowers, sent, according to the fashion of the time,
from far and near. Father, brothers, brothers-in-law,
cousins, old neighbors of all degrees, followed the
melancholy train. More respect could not have been
shown to a prince; and some went away saddened by
thoughts of the promising life cut short, and some with
relief to think that at last all was over, which was
scarcely a less human sentiment. In Melcombe perhaps
the feeling of relief predominated. To be able
to have the blinds drawn up, to look at the papers, to
enter without self-reproach into ordinary subjects,
after such a long and distressing break in all usual
habits, was a welcome change. Poor Roger! it could
not do him any good, poor fellow, that anybody should
be ill at ease. All the crying in the world would not
bring him back. Everything had been done that could
be done,&mdash;more, far more than people in general were
able to do; and now that it was all over, it was a relief
to return to ordinary themes and ordinary habits once
more.</p>

<!-- page 369 -->

<p>The Squire was a man who did not feel very much
except when he was put out and his habits were interfered
with; but yet, as much as was possible he had
felt this. A man does not lose his eldest son by a sudden
and almost violent death without feeling it; especially
when he has just made a family revolution in
consequence of that son's proceedings, and altered the
succession in a way that becomes ridiculous the moment
the culprit disappears. He had put Roger out
of his natural place, and he had put Stephen in it.
And now that he had time to think, the arrangement
struck him not only as very ridiculous, a thing that
naturally everybody would think they had a right to
demand explanations of, but also as unjust and unjustifiable.
The wrong to Edmund had not troubled
him, so long as Edmund's refusal to carry out his
wishes had stood between them. But now that these
wishes had dropped, now that fate had ended all
Roger's chances, there was no doubt that to cut off
Edmund for no reason at all was an injustice. He
was now the eldest son,&mdash;there was no doubt on that
point,&mdash;the natural heir, the head of the family after
his father; whereas Stephen must bear the mark of
cadency, however completely endowed he might be
with the family honors. This troubled the Squire
greatly, and prolonged the existence of the cloud which
had arisen with Roger's death. That event put everything
out. It stultified him; it made him do what he
had never intended to do. There was nothing, indeed,
nothing in the world against Edmund. He had given
his father no offense. He would, all things considered,
probably make a better Squire of Melcombe than
a man who had got a great deal too much of the mess-room
in him. The Squire was certainly uncomfortable,

<!-- page 370 -->

and yet he did not like to make again an exhibition
of himself by another change. Pouncefort would
say, "I told you that you would regret it;" he would
say with his eyebrows, if not in words, that the Mitfords
were hot-headed fools. He would perhaps talk
of the risk, of which he had warned the Squire, of
dying before dinner. Mr. Mitford was afraid of
Stephen, too, who would not willingly part with the
inheritance which he had accepted so readily. It
requires a strong inducement to make a man expose
himself to all these disagreeables, and in face of this
paraphernalia of death and burial the Squire felt with
a recoil the force of his own life and strength. Why
should he hurry himself, expose himself to the remonstrances
of Stephen and the jeers of Pouncefort?
But he was very uncomfortable, and troubled with an
angry sense that his eldest son, whom he had so remorselessly
cut out, had repaid him very summarily,
almost shabbily, for this ill turn, and that Roger might
have helped it if he would.</p>

<p>Stephen too was very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable
that in one respect it did him good. It put Lily,
and the rage and the humiliation which her escape
from his hands had caused him, out of his mind. He
forgot that he had been made a fool of, cheated, deceived,
<i>plant&eacute;-l&agrave;</i>, which was how he represented it to
himself. There are different standards of pride and
honor. Stephen had felt himself wronged, insulted,
put to shame, by Lily. He would have thrown up his
commission, abandoned all his occupations and pleasures,
left England, disappeared he did not care where,
had the story ever reached the ears of his set. It
would have covered him with ridicule and shame; it
made him ridiculous to himself, even, while he brooded

<!-- page 371 -->

furiously over it during the first day. He had spent
half the night in the streets, like Lily, but not in the
same streets, as it happened, and had not given up the
search for twenty-four hours after; not, indeed, until
the morning on which Edmund found him, coming
back, suspicious and on the watch for any look or hint
that might show a consciousness of his secret. It was
this rage of shame and terror of ridicule which had
made him repulse his brothers, one after the other, in
the latter case with such fatal effects. But the catastrophe
delivered Stephen: he thought of Lily no
more; he forgot that disgusting episode, as he called
it in his thoughts; the shock of this new and dreadful
event drove her and the fury with which he had been
regarding her out of his mind altogether. He was not
very sensitive nor tender-hearted, but the sight of
Roger's fall would not go out of his eyes or his mind.
When he was by himself it came back to him,&mdash;the
sudden disappearance, the sound, so heavy, so horrible,
so unlike any other sound. He could not forget
it. Presently something of the same feeling with
which he had regarded Lily when she escaped came
into his thoughts of Roger, a sense of anger, as if he
had been taken at a disadvantage, put into a position
in which he could not but show badly, although he
was not really to blame. Certainly he was not to
blame. He had done nothing that the gentlest-tempered
man might not have done. He did not strike
nor knock down his assailant, as a hot-headed fellow
would have done. He only pushed him back a bit;
anybody would have done that. He meant no harm.
How could he tell that Roger was weak, or unsteady,
or excited? He had done nothing wrong, but somehow
he was put in the wrong, and he knew people

<!-- page 372 -->

would look at him askance. Edmund did, for one.
They had walked together after the coffin, but Edmund
had not said a word to him, had greeted him
only with a hurried nod, had turned his eyes away, as
if he could not bear the sight of him, which was unjust,&mdash;by
Jove! abominably unjust. For he had done
nothing&mdash;nothing that any man would not have done
in the circumstances. He was not to blame. He had
not meant to hurt Roger. Why should he? Roger
was not in his way. Still, it is a disagreeable thing to
have anything to do with the killing of your brother:
no one likes to be mixed up in such a catastrophe,&mdash;and
again Stephen would seem to see the face of
Roger disappear from before him, and the mass all
huddled up at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>And this funeral party was very disagreeable to
him. To act company with Statham and Markham,
whose spirits were only temporarily subdued, and
who seemed to think they should be taken over the
stables (a duty which Edmund, retiring to his own
rooms as soon as the funeral was over, would take no
part in), and to show the civility of a son of the
house, almost of a host, to the departing guests, who,
he felt sure, must be commenting upon everything
that had happened,&mdash;all that was wearisome. A
man who has been so unfortunate as to shoot his father
or his brother, as they push through the covert
together, is pitied, though probably it is all due to his
carelessness; but a man who pushes his brother down-stairs,
his brother whose rightful place he has just
usurped! Stephen felt that circumstances were very
hard upon him; for it was no fault of his,&mdash;he was
not to blame.</p>

<p>He would have liked above all things to leave Melcombe

<!-- page 373 -->

with the Stathams and the Markhams, next
day; they were unfeignedly glad to go, and so was
Nina, who had persuaded Geraldine to take her "for
a change." "Everybody goes for a change, when
there has been a death," Nina said, and the sisters
acknowledged the justice of the statement. They all
went away with serious looks, giving little pinches and
pats to each other's crape, which, being so stiff and
new, would not "sit;" but by the time they got to
the station they had all cheered up wonderfully, and
begun to talk about what they had better do. The
season was lost to them, but still the world was not
without delights. "It would be just the time to go
for a little run abroad," Geraldine had said, laying to
heart that suggestion of Nina's about a change after
a death. Lady Statham had so far recovered her
spirits as to suggest this, as they reached Molton
Junction, whither they had driven to catch the express
train.</p>

<p>Stephen turned back, with a sigh of angry pain.
He could not go away, nor go abroad, nor even return
to his regiment. His father had angrily insisted that
he should remain. "If you're going to be the head
of this house, you'd better give up the regiment," he
said. <i>If</i>, again!&mdash;that <i>if</i> did Stephen a little good.
It showed him that he might have to fight for his
rights, which was exhilarating, and gave him something
to think of. <i>If!</i> It was the governor's own doing to
put him in that place, but he was not going to give it
up,&mdash;it would be the greatest folly to give it up. He
was not one of those who could chop and change with
every wind, he said to himself; and if the governor
meant to go back from his word he should not find it
so easy as he had done with Roger. When a thing

<!-- page 374 -->

was settled, it was settled. The chance of a fight
again did Stephen good. It kept him up after all the
others had gone away. To be left alone in the house
with his father and Edmund was not a cheerful prospect;
but if there were going to be a fight!</p>

<p>He had need of this little spark of pugnacity to sustain
him, for it would be difficult to imagine anything
more miserable than the dinner-table at Melcombe,
on the first evening after the Stathams and Markhams
had gone. Roger's empty chair stood at the
foot of the table, but no one took it; neither Edmund,
who had the natural right as the eldest surviving
son, nor Stephen, who had the acquired right as the
heir. They took their places on either side of their
father, with a sense of desolation. Presently Edmund
started up, and pushing against the astonished Larkins,
put away the chair against the wall. No one
said a word; the father and Stephen looked on, with
a feeling that something of reproach to them was in
this rapid movement, but they were too much cowed to
protest or remonstrate. Larkins, following Edmund,
cleared away very solemnly the knives and forks and
glasses from the table, which had been laid as usual
for that fourth who would never take his place there
again. Larkins felt the reproach also, though in a
different way; but he had the support of feeling that
he had done it for the best, not knowing which Mr.
Edmund would prefer: to assume the place which
was now his; or, for convenience, as there was so
small a party, to keep his former position at the side.
The butler put all the silver and crystal upon the tray
which John Thomas held behind him, very slowly,
and with great solemnity and just but suppressed indignation;
and they all looked on in silence, not saying

<!-- page 375 -->

a word. And so the last traces of Roger's presence
were swept away.</p>

<p>They were all glad when the meal was over, and
they were at liberty to separate. Even Nina's presence
would have been a little relief. The three, each
other's nearest relations in the world, felt among
them a <i>sourd</i> antagonism. To Stephen and his father
Edmund's silence was as a disapproval of both;
Mr. Mitford was angry with his youngest son for having
gained a promotion to which he had no right, and
Stephen was all in arms against any possible repentance
of his father. How glad they were to rise, a
few moments after Larkins, who was a sort of protection
to them, left the room! Each was afraid of
what the other might say. Another night of repose,
of postponement, before any explanation could be
made, was the greatest gain which was possible. Mr.
Mitford and Edmund retired quickly, taking different
directions, the moment they rose from the table, to
their own apartments. Stephen strolled out into the
park with his cigar. He had no den within doors, no
occupation to which he could withdraw. He did not
read; he could not play billiards or anything else
without a companion; and the billiard-room, to which
he would have gone on an ordinary occasion, was full
of the memory of Roger, so that Stephen felt with a
shudder that he might see his dead brother, or imagine
he saw him (for he was well aware that ghosts
were but optical illusions), in the present disturbed
state of his nerves, if he went there. But he had forgotten,
when he stepped outside into the soft air of
the summer night, that here were other associations
not much more salutary for his nerves than a fancied
apparition. How often had he gone forth, complacent,

<!-- page 376 -->

expanding his broad chest, pulling down his
cuffs, with all the pleasure of a conqueror, to meet the
little beauty, the admiring girl, who was ready to
burn incense to him as much as he would, ready to
drop into his arms as soon as he should hold up a
finger! (Stephen took no pains to keep his metaphors
clear.) But now the very thought of Lily filled him
with rage. He could not put her out of his mind,
now that he had come back. He seemed to see her
advancing towards him under the trees, hurrying to
meet him. By George! she wished she could now,
he did not doubt. She would give her ears that she
had not been such a fool. She ran to be chased, to
be sure; the last thing in her mind was to be lost, to
be allowed to get away. He caught eagerly at this
idea, which occurred to him for the first time. Women
always run away that men may run after them,
but she had succeeded better than she wanted, this
time. By Jove! if she had ever supposed he would
not have caught her up, she would not have been in
such a hurry to run away: and then he began to compliment
himself on his skill in missing Lily. What
a life she would be leading him now, if he had found
her, if he had seized her round some corner and
brought her back, as no doubt she intended!</p>

<p>This was the way in which Stephen tried to subdue
the furious recollections of that failure, when he
brought the whole business back to his mind by strolling
out into the park; but the attempt was not very
successful. He did not finish his cigar, but whirled
it away into the twilight, as if it were a missile thrown
at Lily, and went in again, discontented, sulky, miserable,
to fall into his father's hands.</p>

<p class="small">PATERNAL ADVICE.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. MITFORD, also, was sulky, miserable, and discontented.
Perhaps in him it was grief taking another
aspect, different from that of common grief.
He was out of heart with himself and everything
round. Roger was in his grave,&mdash;all his own fault,
his obstinacy and folly, setting himself against his father
and everything that was sensible! But, however
it came about,&mdash;and it was a faint satisfaction to
think that it was Roger's own fault, the boy was in
his grave. There was nothing more to discuss about
him or to find fault with,&mdash;he was in his grave.
The Squire had a dull sort of consciousness in his
mind that Roger might meet his mother thereabouts,
and that it would be a little triumph to her to find
out that he had not succeeded with the boy,&mdash;for
he had never agreed with his wife about education,
and never would let her have her own way. She
would say, "This would not have happened if he had
taken my advice." Mr. Mitford had not thought of
his wife for a long time, and he wondered how it was
that this recollection should seize him now. It was
not cheerful in the library, where he suddenly remembered
that all the boys had been in the habit of meeting,
the drawing-room being so little used after their
mother's death. All the boys!&mdash;and now one of
them was in his grave; and another keeping apart,

<!-- page 378 -->

tacitly blaming his father (though how any man in
his senses could think him to blame!); and the third,
whom he had himself set above the others, made the
master! Stephen had never been very kind, always
a selfish fellow, taking his own way. Well, well!
The Squire said to himself, with a sigh, that this was
how children treated one, after all the trouble they
were to bring up: went against you; contradicted
you; died if they could not have their own way otherwise,
and thought that was the thing that would annoy
you most; or sulked, making you believe that you
were to blame. He found the silence of his room intolerable,
that lingering, slow evening: the house was
so quiet. He could remember when it had made him
very angry to hear steps and voices about, and he had
said that the servants were altogether forgetting themselves,
and that Larkins and Mrs. Simmons must have
lost their heads; but he would have been glad to hear
something moving to-night.</p>

<p>By and by he saw a red speck in the distance, in
the evening gray, coming towards the house, and
made out that it was Stephen chiefly by that hasty
motion of flinging his cigar from him, which Stephen,
on his side, had been driven to do by the hurry and
stinging of his thoughts. Mr. Mitford was glad to
see some one to whom he could talk, some one who
had no right to be sulky; who, if there were any
blame, was worse than he was, far more deeply involved,
and to whom he could furnish matter for
thought such as perhaps Stephen would not like.</p>

<p>Short of getting rid of our own discomfort, there
are few things so soothing as making other people
uncomfortable, and the Squire felt that to plant Stephen's
pillow with thorns would restore a certain zest

<!-- page 379 -->

to life. He opened his door accordingly, as his son
came in, and said, "If you've nothing better to do,
you may as well come in here for half an hour. I
want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I have nothing whatever to do," returned Stephen
resentfully, "except to write some letters," he added
as an afterthought, perceiving the snare into which he
had fallen.</p>

<p>"You can write your letters any time; but me you
mayn't have&mdash;you mayn't have&mdash;so very long"&mdash;&mdash;
Mr. Mitford had not at all intended to say anything
of this lugubrious description, but it came to his lips
unawares.</p>

<p>"Why, you are as hale and hearty as any man
could wish to be!" said Stephen, surprised.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so,&mdash;perhaps not," remarked the Squire
oracularly. "Don't vapor about, but sit down, for
Heaven's sake! Don't stand and swing about. It's
a thing I cannot bear, as I always told"&mdash;&mdash; He would
have said "Roger," with one of those curious returns
upon a dead name which so constantly occurs when
the void is fresh; and though his feelings were not
deep, he was touched by it in spite of himself. "I'll
never say that or anything else to him again, poor fellow!
Sit down. I have a great many things to say."
But though Stephen sat down with more than usual
docility, perhaps moved in a similar way, it was some
time before his father spoke. When he did, it was in
the tone of a man who has been awaiting a tardy response.
"Well! you know what I said about sending
in your papers?"</p>

<p>"There can't be any such dreadful hurry about it,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"There is a hurry. You've stepped into the place,

<!-- page 380 -->

and you must fill it. I am not going to have a fellow
here who is at home only when he pleases, or never at
home at all. There's no objection to that on the part
of a younger son, who is of no particular account. But
when you come to be the eldest, or at least to stand in
the place of the eldest"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's many an eldest son who is as much away
from home as I am. When the man of the house is
as well and lively as you are"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lively,&mdash;with my poor boy in his grave!" said
the Squire; and then he abandoned this subject
curtly. "There's a great deal more for you to do,"
he added. "I'll take nothing off your hands. You'll
have to give your attention to Pouncefort and the rest.
I've come to a time of life when I don't choose to be
troubled. I say when I don't <i>choose</i>,&mdash;I don't mean
that I'm not able enough to do whatever's wanted:
but I don't choose to bind myself. You'll have to
stay at home and look after things."</p>

<p>"You know very well that you wouldn't let me
look after things, if I were to try."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the sort," returned Mr. Mitford,
angrily. "And more than that, you must marry
and settle. It's not decent to go on as we've been
doing, without a woman in the house."</p>

<p>"Marry!" said Stephen, with a low whistle of ridicule
and surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, marry. You may laugh,&mdash;that's part of
your libertine mess-room ways; but in my day, as soon
as a young man knew how he was going to live he
married,&mdash;it was the first thing that was thought of.
If you are to have Melcombe, you must arrange your
life accordingly."

<p>"If I laughed,&mdash;and I did not laugh,&mdash;it was to

<!-- page 381 -->

think of such a piece of advice from you, when we're
all in the deepest of mourning."</p>

<p>"Well! getting married isn't fun, is it?" said the
Squire. "It's not a frolic; and besides, it's not a
thing that can be done in a moment. You can't be
introduced to a girl now, and propose to her in a
week, and marry her,&mdash;in your mourning, as you
say. Mourning doesn't last long nowadays. If you
wear a hat-band for six mouths, I suppose it's about
as much as you'll do. Dead people are soon shoveled
out of the way." Mr. Mitford was not thinking now
of Roger, but the summary way in which he himself
would be disposed of, supposing such an unlikely
thing to happen as that he should die. The thought
recurred to him against his will.</p>

<p>"You talk," remarked Stephen, taking his cigar-case
from his pocket, choosing a cigar, looking at it all
round, and then returning the case to his pocket, in
order to show by this expressive pantomime how hard
a thing it was to sit and talk or be talked to without
the help of smoke,&mdash;"you speak," he said, poising
the cigar in his fingers, "as if you had settled it all;
not only the marrying, but whom I'm to marry. Oh,
I'm not going to smoke. It's absurd in a man's
room, but I know there's no smoking allowed here."</p>

<p>"In my day a man could listen to what his father
had to say to him with a little respect, without tobacco;
or else he ran the risk of being turned out of
the house."</p>

<p>"Ah! there's been about enough of that, you must
think," Stephen said, with cool impatience. He began
to examine his nails as he spoke, and took out a
penknife to scrape off a sharp corner, with the air of
finding this much more interesting than anything his

<!-- page 382 -->

father could have to say. And his words rendered
Mr. Mitford speechless, partly with rage, which was
an effect Stephen frequently produced upon him, and
also because what he said was true. Turning out-of-doors
was not an experiment to try again. The Squire
had not found it a successful method. He could make
no reply, though the taunt was hard to bear. There
was a moment of silence, which Stephen was the first
to break. "Well, sir," he said, after he had finished
the little operation on his nail, holding it up to the
lamp to see that it was even, "and who may the damsel
be?"</p>

<p>The Squire sat up in his chair, red, with the pulses
throbbing in his temples. It was very bad for him.
The doctors had told him so a dozen times,&mdash;that to
let himself get angry and excited was the worst thing
he could do, and put his life in danger. So easy it is
for doctors to speak, who probably have no sons, or
only little ones, not old enough to drive them frantic
with constant contradictions. He sat still, getting the
better of himself; and this not only on the consideration
of health, but because he knew that his anger
would have no effect upon Stephen.</p>

<p>A man who has an unrestrainable temper can find
the means to restrain his temper when his motive is
strong enough; and though it was always on the cards
that the indulgence of it might bring on a fit of apoplexy,
yet Mr. Mitford could hold himself in check
when it was his only policy to do so. Besides, there
was always that recollection of Roger coming in to
stop him. Things might have succeeded better if he
had fallen on some other way with Roger. When you
have tried <i>les grands moyens</i> and failed, needs must
that you should return to influences of a more practicable

<!-- page 383 -->

kind. But it was not for a considerable time
that Mr. Mitford could prevail upon himself to reply.</p>

<p>"The damsel!" he said. "You'll have to mend
your manners, if you're to do anything there. Ladies
in the country are not hail-fellow-well-met, like some,
I fear, of your fast young women in London."</p>

<p>"No?" queried Stephen. "I've always found them
very much alike. If it's a duchess in her own
right"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The lady I mean is a great deal too good for you,
my fine fellow, whatever she is."</p>

<p>"I was going to say that in that case there was no
difficulty at all, for they like it when a fellow shows
that he forgets what swells they are."</p>

<p>"She's no duchess," said the father. He was a
little nervous about the announcement he was going
to make. "She's a very fine woman, as handsome a
creature as ever I saw, and she has money enough to
buy us all out twice over, though we're not so badly
off at Melcombe; and, by George! I've set my heart
on one of you having her, Steve! You're a man of
the world; you know sentiment isn't everything,&mdash;though
I give you my word she's a fine woman apart
from her money, and would be a credit to the house."</p>

<p>"You're very warm, governor," observed Stephen,
with a laugh. "Why don't you go in for her&mdash;who
ever she is&mdash;yourself?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the Squire; but the suggestion mollified
him. He began to give his son a sketch of the
circumstances; the great fortune all in her own hands;
the old woman dependent upon her, who considered
herself the mistress of the house; all the little imbroglio
of facts which a husband would have to clear
up. He told the story as if he were talking of a

<!-- page 384 -->

stranger, and it was not till he had gone on with
rising enthusiasm to set forth the advantages of old
Travers's London property and all his profitable investments
that Stephen suddenly interrupted him with
a little shout&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, you're talking of Lizzy Travers, the only
woman I ever loved!"</p>

<p>"None of your slang, sir. I'm talking, it's true,
of Miss Travers. What do you know of Miss Travers?
I didn't know you had ever met."</p>

<p>"Governor," said Stephen, "all this has been too
much for you; you want rest; you'll be forgetting
your own name, next. Why, I've danced with her,
ridden with her, flirted with her. Don't you recollect
the last Christmas I spent at home? By the way,
though," said Stephen, pausing, "that's three years
ago, and the fair Lizzy wasn't a baby then."</p>

<p>"She is five-and-twenty,&mdash;I know her age, and an
admirable age, too: old enough to know a thing or
two; to be aware what her money's worth, for instance,
and to like to see something solid in exchange.
Now, Melcombe is all she could look for in that way,
and if you see your true interest, and can show her
what we might call a manly devotion"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stephen laughed. "Oh, I'll show her a manly devotion,"
he answered, "or any other sort she likes.
I'll be a troubadour or anything. I'm not such a fool
as not to see the use of a match like that. I'll ride
over and see her to-morrow, if you like, sir. I'll tell
her I've come for sympathy, and that will make a
very good opening. Women are fond of giving consolation.
I'll tell her"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't go quite so fast!" interrupted the Squire.
He was greatly relieved to find that Stephen made no

<!-- page 385 -->

objection,&mdash;that he received the idea "in a right
spirit," which was what neither Roger nor Edmund
had done; but at the same time he was disgusted with
his son's readiness, and with the laugh which accompanied
his idea of going to seek consolation. Mr.
Mitford felt at once that it was a very good idea, and
that to kick Stephen for having it was the duty of
every man. He could not do this himself, having
found out, as already said, that <i>les grands moyens</i>
were not always successful, but he felt that it ought to
be done. And yet he was much satisfied with the easy
conversion of Stephen, and he saw that his idea was a
good one,&mdash;women <i>are</i> fond of consoling. It might
be that Elizabeth (for the Squire believed women to
be wholly unaccountable creatures) would at once answer
to this rule; but not to-morrow, not so fast. In
his mingled satisfaction and indignation he could not
say any more.</p>

<p>"If that's all," said Stephen presently, rising and
yawning broadly on the other side of the lamp, "I
think I'll go off to bed. It can't be said, sir, that
Melcombe is particularly amusing at this time of the
year."</p>

<p>"Few houses are very amusing," remarked the
Squire with dignity, "two days after the funeral of
the eldest son."</p>

<p>"To be sure there's something in that. Good-night,
then," said Stephen, again yawning, "if that's
all you've got to say."</p>

<p>All he had got to say! It meant only two lives,
with the background of another life sacrificed; the
one scarcely cold in his grave, the others with long
years before them in which very possibly to be miserable.
Mr. Mitford sat and thought it all over after

<!-- page 386 -->

Stephen was gone. He thought it highly desirable
that Elizabeth should listen to this dashing soldier,
this tall, well-set-up, well-looking Mitford, the
handsomest of all the sons. Why shouldn't she?
The fellow was a very good-looking fellow, well born,
with a good estate behind him and a good position.
There was nothing so likely as that she would be
charmed with him. But whether it would be quite
a good thing for her, whether she would live happy
ever after, was a thing the Squire would not have
taken upon him to prophesy. Quite probably the
pair would not be what is commonly called happy, as
Stephen did not even pretend to care anything for
her, nor to contemplate happiness at all in the matter:
and yet he said, if that were all! His father listened
to his progress up-stairs to bed with various sensations,&mdash;glad
of his acceptation of the part which had been
in vain pressed, upon Roger, yet with an angry scorn
of Stephen, in comparison with Roger, which words
could not express. She would have him,&mdash;no doubt
she would have him; and the Mitfords of Melcombe
would increase and flourish. And yet how much
better for poor Lizzy had it been Roger who had been
persuaded to go a-wooing,&mdash;Roger newly laid in his
grave!</p>

<p>Stephen paused on his way up-stairs to look out
of the long staircase window. He was tickled by the
turn which affairs had taken, and that he was to be
the man to marry Lizzy Travers and get all that
wealth. It would be a prodigious bore, but such a
lot of money made almost anything supportable. He
stopped to look out upon the long stretch of the park,
all indistinct and blurred in the dim summer night.
There lay the glade where he had gone to meet Lily,&mdash;damn

<!-- page 387 -->

her! the little jilt, the little fool who had
escaped him, who had run away to make him follow,
whom he had lost in the London streets. If he could
but have found her and killed her, he felt as if he
would have liked to do it. He would never have
killed her; but to crush her, to humble her, to cover
her with scorn and shame, would have been sweet.
In the middle of his laugh about Lizzy Travers, thus
offered to him, whom apparently he had only to put
forth his hand and take, came in this image of the
other, the country girl who had outwitted him, balked
him, jilted him,&mdash;curse her! the little cheat, the
little designing, mercenary flirt. He clenched his
hand and set his teeth when he thought of it, still.
He might have got over his fancy for her,&mdash;indeed,
he had got over that; but the mortification, that was
not so easy to forget. As he looked out over the dim
trees in the direction of Lily's home, Stephen suddenly
remembered that the pleasure of revenge was
now easy to be had. If he could not reach her, he
could reach the father; he could crush the family,
he could turn them adrift upon the world. When
she found herself without a crust, without a rag, then
she would repent bitterly enough, if she had not done
it already. Revenge is sweet, everybody says,&mdash;at
least the anticipation is sweet. It is to be hoped
that Stephen would not in any case have carried out
all that he intended, but it gave him a fierce satisfaction
to think he could bundle Ford out of the lodge
to-morrow, take his bread from him and his character,
and ruin the bad lot of them! He went up to
bed solaced by these thoughts, and presently laughed
again when he thought of Lizzy Travers, the heiress,
with all her money. She was not bad-looking, either;

<!-- page 388 -->

not mind taking a little trouble. But first he would
have that Lily&mdash;lily, indeed! common weed that she
was&mdash;cast out upon a dunghill, to perish there. Let
us hope that he could not have been in any circumstances
so bad as his thoughts.</p>

<p class="small">AT THE RECTORY.</p>

</div>

<p>EDMUND had little heart for the company of his
father and brother; his own life seemed to have
stopped with Roger's. It was not only natural affection
and sorrow, but a sudden dropping of all the
usual companionship. He seemed suddenly to have
been left quite alone. As a matter of fact, Roger and
he had been thrown more together in the last month
or two than they had been since they were boys; and
though they had both gone their own way, and were
not what might be called of similar tastes, Edmund
was himself surprised to find how much he had been
in the habit of talking to Roger about the things that
interested him. Already, in the short interval since
his death, an incredible number of things had accumulated
of which Edmund's first thought had been to
tell them to Roger. And when he remembered that
Roger was no longer there, and that there was nobody
in the wide world whom he could tell them to, whom
he would have cared to tell them to, a sense of great
solitude came upon him. He felt himself as if in a
desert. He seemed no longer to know anybody, to be
able to exchange a word with any one. He was as
lonely as if he had been upon a desolate island. Even
little Nina, the poor little badly brought-up sister, who
troubled his mind with her gossip,&mdash;even she was
gone. With his father and Stephen he was on good

<!-- page 390 -->

enough terms, with no suspicion of hostility among
them, but only a faint aversion in his own mind, a disinclination
to have anything to do with them. He
could be civil; he could be no more. He did not accuse
them of anything,&mdash;even Stephen. He did not
in his heart allow that Stephen had killed his brother;
but he felt a little revulsion, a sort of mental sickening,
at the sight of him. He had nothing to say to
him; he did not like to be nearer him than he could
help: that was the form his feeling took.</p>

<p>He felt a dreary vacancy around him: of the many
things which had once interested him, nothing seemed
to remain. He cared for nothing, he had nobody to
whom he could talk. When he thought of it, he felt
that there was exaggeration in the feeling, and that
Roger in life had not really been everything to him,
as he now seemed to have been. It was perhaps only
the form his sorrow took,&mdash;a sentiment which was its
own reason, and for which no explanation could be
made. He scarcely went out at all for some days,
feeling a reluctance to look at the face of the world
and resume intercourse with ordinary men. When he
did go beyond the limits of the park, his feet carried
him, almost without any will of his, to the Rectory.
And yet it was the place to which he would have gone
had he been in full possession of his will, for there was
no one, he felt, who could understand him like Pax,
who knew them both through and through. To her he
could talk. He had scarcely even remembered her
existence, in that first dull vacancy; it was a sign of
the beginning of restoration when it occurred to him
that with Pax he could talk over everything, without
having to explain.</p>

<p>Thus it was almost a disappointment when he found

<!-- page 391 -->

the drawing-room at the Rectory tenanted, not by Pax,
but by Elizabeth Travers. He stopped short, in the
very act of coming in, when he perceived her. But
after that first pause a shock of something like pleasure
went through him. Unwittingly to himself, she
did him more good by the mere sight of her than Pax
could have done. The blood seemed to come back to
his heart with a thrill, and personal feelings, wishes,
consciousness, seemed to awaken suddenly, with a
stinging pain, in his heart. But for the first moment
he thought he was disappointed, and that, Pax not
being there, his better plan was to go away.</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose up, coloring a little. She colored
still more when she saw his instinctive stop, and said
hurriedly, "Mr. Mitford! Oh, I'll go and find Pax,&mdash;she
has only gone up-stairs for something. I shall
find her in a moment!"</p>

<p>He put out his hand to stop her movement. "Don't
go," he pleaded, "don't go." There was a feeling in
him as of the bursting out of wells in the desert. The
heavy vacancy quivered into life. Ah, all this still
remained, and he had thought that life was emptied
out and deprived of all things! He became astonished
at himself.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;you must want Pax&mdash;and not a
stranger," Elizabeth said, with a quiver, too, of sympathetic
feeling.</p>

<p>"You are not a stranger," he replied, and then for
a moment there was nothing more. He sat down near
her, and wondered vaguely whether Roger could know
that she was the first person he had seen, the first to
whom he would talk, after what they had said together
that night.</p>

<p>It was she who broke the silence, after an interval
which seemed long to her, but not to him.</p>

<!-- page 392 -->

<p>"We were very sorry," she said, faltering, "very
sorry," and paused again, looking at him, telling him
more clearly than in words how sorry she was, how
changed she found him, and how she would fain have
had something to say to comfort him. Then she repeated,
as if nothing else would come, "Very sorry,
both my aunt and I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew you would be. I think I've been dead,
too, these last days."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have heard&mdash;you have had everything to
bear&mdash;and you look ill. You must care a little for
yourself now."</p>

<p>"That's poor comfort," he returned, "to care for
one's self, when there's nobody else to care for."</p>

<p>"But it has to be done, Mr. Mitford. Oh, Pax will
know what to say to you much better than I do!"</p>

<p>"Don't go," he begged again, "don't go," putting
out his hand with an appeal to her, as she half rose.
Elizabeth was more embarrassed than became her character.
She wanted to escape, and neither knew how
to do so nor what to say.</p>

<p>"In any case," she said, "though I am so little
qualified to say so, we must not throw away our lives
because we are unhappy. We have all our own place
to fill&mdash;perhaps more&mdash;perhaps better than"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here she stopped, reddening with some emotion
which she could not repress, the tears coming into her
eyes.</p>

<p>Edmund apprehended faintly what she meant.
"You do not know," he said hastily,&mdash;"no one
knows&mdash;all that he was. He had not time to show
what was in him."</p>

<p>Miss Travers bowed her head, but there was a stiffness
as of unconscious opposition in this assent. "I
saw&mdash;very little of him," she said, faltering.</p>

<!-- page 393 -->

<p>"We talked of you, the last time we ever talked together."</p>

<p>A sudden blush covered Elizabeth's face, a hot color
that looked like anger. She made another little constrained
bow. "I don't know what there could have
been to say of me."</p>

<p>He did not make any reply, for his mind had gone
back to Roger's rooms in town,&mdash;to his brother, all
unconscious of what was coming, conscious only of the
dawn of a new life in himself; full of anticipations
which were so different, so different from what had
come. It was not till all this had passed before him
that he remembered what Roger had said of Elizabeth
and these prognostications, which were as little likely
to come to pass as those which he had imagined of his
own career. And Edmund felt his tongue tied; he
made her no answer, partly because he could not, seeing
what it was that had been said, and partly that he
would not lift the veil from his dead brother's plans
and hopes.</p>

<p>At this moment Pax hurried in, with her arms held
out to him and her eyes full of tears. "Oh, Edmund!"
she exclaimed, grasping him, giving him a
motherly kiss. "Oh, Edmund!" Not the worst comforters
are those who have nothing to say in the way
of consolation. When she loosed her arms, Pax sat
down and cried, tears not only of sympathy, but of
grief. "Tell me," she said, sobbing,&mdash;"tell me
everything! I want to hear everything. Oh, who
would have thought it, that my old father should get
better at eighty, and Roger die! Oh, my dear Roger!
my poor Roger! Tell me everything, Edmund!"</p>

<p>He did what she told him, and it was a relief to
him. There had been no occasion to speak of what

<!-- page 394 -->

had passed with those who knew as much as himself,
no family comparison of what each individual had
seen and heard. It was a change from the dreadful
monotony of the home atmosphere, in which Roger's
name was no more mentioned, to live over all the incidents
of his concluding days again. He sat beside
Pax, and told her everything, as a brother might have
done to a sister; she ever throwing in a new question,
requiring every detail, her sobs now and then interrupting
the narrative.</p>

<p>Elizabeth moved uneasily in her chair, then rose to
go away, but was stopped again and again by a word
from Pax. "He doesn't mind you being there, and
I want you," she said, in the midst of her tears. Miss
Travers had no resource but to stay. She listened
to the story of the death-bed, herself now and then
greatly moved, yet contending with her feelings, something
like indignation mingling with her involuntary
sympathy, a look of reluctance and resistance on her
face. She was angry with herself for being so much
affected, yet unwilling to shed a tear for Roger. Edmund
did not perceive this, in the preoccupation of
his own sorrow,&mdash;not, at least, till he had nearly
reached the end.</p>

<p>"And what part did Lily Ford take in all this?"
inquired Pax at last.</p>

<p>At this utterance Elizabeth got up hurriedly and
went to the window, where she stood, turning her
back upon them, as if she could bear no more.</p>

<p>"Lily Ford!" exclaimed Edmund. "What part
should she have taken? She did not even know that
anything had happened, so far as I am aware."</p>

<p>"And yet the poor boy was going to marry her!
She might have gone and nursed him, at the least.

<!-- page 395 -->

Not that I hold with such nursing, but she might have
offered&mdash;she might"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have no reason to suppose she knew anything
about it," replied Edmund. "Don't blame her, poor
girl!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned quickly from the window. "Blame
her?" she cried, involuntarily.</p>

<p>Edmund turned half round to look at her, but he
had no clue whatever to her meaning. He turned
again to Pax. "He had made out a draft of a kind
of settlement," he said,&mdash;"I found it among his papers,&mdash;to
secure to her what money he had to leave.
It was not very much."</p>

<p>"That was like him," said Pax, "that was like him!
My dear, I can't help being glad it never happened;
but to take care of her future, as if she had been
his own equal, as if she had had people to look after
her interests,&mdash;that was like my Roger! Ah! you
may say what you please, all of you, but I knew him
best of all. He was in love with me once, bless him!&mdash;a
woman who might have been his mother! It was
nonsense, of course, but it gives me all the more right
to him now. You none of you know him as I do!
And what will you do about it, Edmund,&mdash;a thing
that was never binding, of course, and never could
be?"</p>

<p>"It shall be binding," answered Edmund. "I
shall see that his intentions are carried out,&mdash;though
she did not deserve that he should care for her so."</p>

<p>"Not deserve!" cried Elizabeth, turning round
again, the words bursting from her in spite of herself.
Both of them, Pax drying her eyes, Edmund raising
his head, looked up at her, wondering what she could
mean. Elizabeth was very much moved; her color

<!-- page 396 -->

came and went. "Mr. Mitford," she said, "if you
mean this to be a sort of compensation,&mdash;which I
suppose was its intention at first,&mdash;I may say to you
that Lily would never accept it, never! Oh, how
could you think of such a thing! I know that nothing
but good should be said of the dead, and I don't
want to say a word&mdash;not a word. I am sorry, sorry
to the bottom of my heart, for you. I know you will
wish to think the best, naturally; and so should I.
But Lily will never accept it! I&mdash;I happen to
know"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was with difficulty she could restrain her tears. To
see Elizabeth, so composed and dignified as she was,
in this strange state of excitement bewildered them
both. What did she mean? The thought shot through
Edmund's mind painfully, as if some one had thrown
an arrow or a missile at him, that she had cared for
Roger more than she was aware, that she had resented
his love for Lily, that Elizabeth was another victim.
If it were so, Roger had never suspected it, and in
that case all was waste, Elizabeth's love as well as the
rest,&mdash;though had it but come to him! He looked
at her with a pang that seemed to cut his heart in
two. Elizabeth's love all wasted, when it might have
made the world bloom again, and brought Eden out
of the wilderness! The thought was very bitter, and
the thought that she herself resented it, angry, excited,
covering a pang which no doubt mortified as
well as wounded her with this fierceness about Lily;
taking Lily's part, as if Roger had meant her any
wrong.</p>

<p>"She knows something we don't know," observed
Pax. "You would not speak like that, Elizabeth,
without thinking you had some reason."</p>

<!-- page 397 -->

<p>"I <i>have</i> reason; there is no thinking! Oh," said
Elizabeth, wringing her hands, "it's not a moment
to say anything! I am very wrong to have said anything.
I am going home. I can't help it if I don't
feel as you do. I am very, very sorry, all the same,
Mr. Mitford, for you."</p>

<p>"Let me go away, not you," said Edmund, rising:
"it is time I did. It has done me a great deal of
good to tell Pax. Thank you for your sympathy,
Miss Travers. One day I wanted to tell you what
Roger said, and perhaps that day may come still, but
I see it cannot be now. Perhaps there were things
he did not understand. He may have been absorbed
in a foolish thought, and not have perceived what was
a great deal more worth thinking of." Edmund
stopped when he had made this strange apology, remembering
that if his discovery were a real one, this
was not what Elizabeth would wish to have said; but
it was too late to draw back.</p>

<p>Whatever she meant, however, it was clear enough
that she did not understand what he meant. She
looked him in the eyes in a strange way, with a
fixed look, as if trying to convict him of something,
he had not the least idea what. They looked earnestly
at each other: he sorrowfully, grieving for her,
for himself, for Roger, for everything thus lost and
wasted; she severely, scarce able to contain herself,
moved in a more intolerable way by the contradiction
of some indignant resentment which contended
with all the softer feelings in her heart. To both
there came a vague sense that there was something
more on either side than either comprehended, which
neither could divine. Pax looked at them both with
lips apart, with a gaze of wonder. It was seldom

<!-- page 398 -->

that she had a difficulty before her which quite transcended
her power of divination.</p>

<p>"Yes, Edmund, my dear," she said, "go; we have
had our cry together, and it has done us both good.
And Lizzy and you will never understand each other
in this way. Leave her with me. Whatever her
reason is it can't be a true one against our boy. We
know better than that. Good-by, Edmund, my dear!"
Pax took him in her large embrace again, and put her
wet cheek against his. "It's miserable now," she
said, "but it will not be so forever. God bless you,
my dear!"</p>

<p>He went away almost without looking round.
Elizabeth held out her hand to him suddenly, as he
passed her, and her hand trembled; but he did not
know why, unless it was for the dear sake of Roger,
against whom she was angry, he could not tell why.
Because he had not loved her,&mdash;because he had loved
Lily Ford? Would a woman be angry still, when the
man was dead, at such a wrong? It seemed more fit
that Edmund should be angry against Fate, who had
thus let everything run to waste, and taken from him
all hope of a new spring of life. But he had not the
heart for any such feeling.</p>

<p>He went to the churchyard, on his way home,
and lingered long, looking at the outside of the
vault in which Roger had been placed. There was
not so much comfort in it as there would have been
in the sod of a visible grave. It seemed to wrap the
dead in a deeper darkness, to misrepresent all life and
the meaning of life; as if everything were to fall into
subterranean gloom, and all possibilities were to be
piled together like so much rubbish in the bowels of
the earth.</p>

<p>XXXVII.</p>

<p class="small">EDMUND OUT OF HEART.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE were some subjects which were altogether
ignored at Melcombe during the somewhat sombre
period which the three gentlemen spent together there.
They met scarcely at all, except at meals, and when
they talked, which was never much, it was on public
and impersonal subjects. Political questions had
never been so thoroughly discussed in the house:
they were more or less safe subjects. Mr. Mitford
and Stephen were naturally Tories of the old school,
who followed their party steadily, without any idea
of independent judgment. It would have been against
Mr. Mitford's principles to think on these matters:
his ideas had been defined from before the beginning
of time. He thought as his father did, and as he
fully expected his son should do. Roger, had he
lived, would have carried out the tradition faithfully
enough, though with a more reasonable devotion to
the tenets in which he had been trained. And Stephen,
whose only virtuous point was a capacity for
understanding discipline and the power of authority,
followed his father closely, and was stanch as
steel to the tradition of that old stubborn, all-resisting
conservatism which is a most respectable sentiment,
and has perhaps done England more good than
all the new theories in the world. Edmund, also in
strict conformity to nature, was of a totally different

<!-- page 400 -->

frame of mind. He was the second son. He was
in her Majesty's opposition. But as he had no special
political fervor or impassioned creed, his politics were
much more theoretical than practical; he had none of
the martyr impulse in him, and he was strong in that
slightly contemptuous toleration which the only intellectual
member of a family often feels for those who
are not in the least given to independent thought.
He knew he could not convince them, nor even make
his point of view comprehensible to them, so he refrained
from controversy. And in the present state
of affairs it was a relief to let them talk upon subjects
of public moment on which they were entirely
agreed, and on which he could occasionally say his say
without too much offense. But on subjects more
familiar there was little said. Roger was not named
among them, nor did any one speak of the future or of
what he intended to do. There were no confidences
of any description in the strange little male group,
which was a family party, yet had so little of the
character of a family in it. Even little Nina, as Edmund
felt more and more, would have been a relief.
It would have been possible to say to her, "What are
you going to do this morning? Do you intend to
walk, or to ride, or to drive?" Such questions were
not put to each other by the three men, who only remarked
that it was a fine day; that Lord So-and-So
made a very good speech last night; that Tredgold,
as chairman of quarter sessions, was ridiculously
out of place; and that what with competitive examinations
and all that the country was going to wreck
and ruin. Edmund, for one, longed, amid all this
talk, to be able to say to Nina, "What are you going
to do to-day?" but to Stephen he did not put that

<!-- page 401 -->

question, even when he had a distinct interest in
knowing what Stephen meant to do.</p>

<p>His special interest in this question arose from
the fact that Stephen and his father had spoken, in
his hearing, of the household at Mount Travers in a
manner which vaguely but powerfully excited Edmund.
He had himself found his way there soon after
his meeting with Miss Travers at the Rectory, and
had been puzzled, yet not discouraged, by his reception.
Elizabeth had received him with something
which looked almost like agitation,&mdash;agitation suppressed
and only to be divined, yet which betrayed
itself to an observer so sympathetic in little changes
of color and momentary tremors, in sudden impulses
and self-restraints, which were scarcely comprehensible
and very perplexing. When any allusion was
made to Roger, she stiffened at once into a marble-like
impassiveness, more significant in the studied
absence of all expression than the utmost show of
feeling, keeping all his questions back. Was it an
injured sense of love rejected? Was it the indignation
and wounded delicacy of a woman who felt herself
slighted for an object much less worthy? Edmund
was unable to solve this mystery.</p>

<p>What made it still more difficult to understand was
that Pax also put on to some degree the same manner,
checking him in those talks which were almost the
only relief his mind had by a hurried "Poor Roger!"
accompanied by a shake of the head and a change of
subject, such as Edmund found it still more difficult to
understand. "God forgive him, poor boy, for all his
imperfections! Let's say no more,&mdash;let's say no
more about it. By and by it won't be so hard," Pax
said once. Why should it be hard to speak of him,

<!-- page 402 -->

now or at any time? To protest against the prayer
that God might forgive him would have been vain
indeed, for the best of men must have need to be forgiven;
but when that is said between people who loved
him, of one who is dead, it means something more
than the imperfections which all men have before
God. Edmund was greatly perplexed and unhappy,
notwithstanding that there were in Elizabeth's manner
to himself many signs which a vainer man might
have built much upon: an air of almost tenderness in
her look, a softness in her voice, as if sympathy for
Edmund were somehow involved in her singular repugnance
to any mention of his dead brother. Edmund
frequented the roads between Melcombe and Mount
Travers with a fascination for which he could scarcely
account to himself. He wanted to see her, to speak
to her of that last conversation with Roger, to tell
her a tale which was all woven in with his brother's
memory; and the more Elizabeth stiffened at all reference
to him, the more indispensable it seemed to
Edmund that she should know the complications of
his story. He had been silent before for Roger's
sake, and now she would give him no chance to show
her what was in his heart.</p>

<p>He was so intent upon the explanation that he forgot
how impossible it ought to be for him, the disinherited,
to approach the heiress. Of that secondary
subject he never thought at all. Perhaps it showed a
dulness of perception in him. His mind was so full
of what he had to say to her, of the story he would so
fain have poured into her ear, of his long doubt and
uncertainty, and final liberation from all hindrances,
that he had no time to be tormented by the thought of
her great fortune and his small one. That consideration

<!-- page 403 -->

no more entered into his mind than it would have
entered into hers. A woman, in such a case, is better
off than a man; but Edmund was as free from painful
calculations of this sort as Elizabeth herself could
have been. He forgot that what might have seemed
to some supersensitive minds a new barrier between
them had come into existence. He was so much occupied
by other matters, by perplexity about her feelings
and desire to disclose his own, that he had no leisure
to think of anything else. And yet, though he was so
eager to tell her his story, which was in reality the
story of several past years, Edmund could not find opportunity
nor courage to do so. Day after day he
walked to the very gate, and then turned back, his
heart having failed him. Once or twice he had gone
farther, as far as the drawing-room, with its great
plate-glass windows, when the sight of that sudden
shutting up of her countenance silenced him in a moment,
and took all strength from him. In this way
Elizabeth occupied his mind almost more than had she
been his affianced bride. He could not make out the
meaning of that look, almost stern in its sudden repression,
or of the melting kindness with which she
would turn to him after she had thus silenced him.
Something stood between them,&mdash;he could not tell
what; a shadow of Roger, a ghost which came chill
between the two whom Roger had wished to see one.
There could not be any doubt that it was Roger who
was that shadow, but how or why Edmund could not
divine. Had she loved him who had not loved her?
Did she find herself unable to forgive him who had
never divined that love, who had given his less worthily?
But why then that softened look, that melting
tone, to Edmund? He was bewildered by this question;

<!-- page 404 -->

it paralyzed him; the words died from his lips,
though he knew that until he said them he could have
no rest.</p>

<p>But when he became aware that the same subject
was being discussed between Stephen and his father, a
singular excitement took possession of Edmund. He
remembered the discussions between the Squire and
Roger, the recommendations which were commands on
one side, and insults on the other,&mdash;commands to his
son to secure the heiress, insulting enumerations of the
advantages to follow. Had this process begun over
again? Had Stephen lent an ear more attentive than
that of his elder brother to these inducements and
recommendations, and was Edmund's brother again,
and this time in earnest, to be his rival? The suggestion
made his blood boil. Stephen to pretend to Elizabeth
Travers! Stephen, who made no secret of his
own estimate of women, and whose associates among
them were sufficiently well known! He, with his garrison-town
associations, his intrigues, his cynical incapacity
for deeper emotion,&mdash;could it be in the possibilities
of the future that Elizabeth had been reserved
for him? Edmund's blood boiled at the
thought. He said to himself that it was impossible,&mdash;that
it could not be; but then he remembered how
many things that are seemingly impossible come to
pass, especially in such concerns. The shadow of
Roger stood between himself and the woman he loved,
but no such shadow was upon Stephen. Stephen would
never perceive, even if it did exist for him, that indefinable
something which closed Edmund's lips and
made his heart fail him. Stephen would go forward
boldly, whatever were the circumstances. No scare of
the imagination would prevent him from pressing his

<!-- page 405 -->

suit. And who would say that amid all these complications
Elizabeth herself might not find a certain relief
in the addresses of a man who had nothing to do
with the past, whose image was not involved with
Roger's, and who, though his brother, had so little in
common with him, and was so entirely a new departure,
a fresh competitor? In the hurrying excitement
of his thoughts at sight of this new possibility, Edmund
could not but see all that was in its favor. He
was well aware of Stephen's advantages,&mdash;his good
looks, his self-assurance, his boldness, even his position
as virtually a stranger, an individuality little
known. All this struck him with a horror which was
not to be expressed. That which Roger in his folly
had not sought, but might perhaps have obtained, that
which Edmund himself would give his life for,&mdash;to
think that it might come to Stephen at last! He said
to himself that it was not possible; that Elizabeth's
perceptions were too fine, her taste too delicate,&mdash;for
such a catastrophe,&mdash;but who could tell? How many
tender women had fallen victims before to men as unworthy
of them! How often had all prognostications
been defied and all finer divination suspended!&mdash;for
what could a woman really know of a man, in such
circumstances, but the outward impression which he
made, and how often was that outward impression a
false one!</p>

<p>This was the thought which eventually roused Edmund
out of the lethargy into which he had fallen.
All the circumstances of his present position had combined
to hold him in that suspense of being. Grief
and that sense of injury with which such a grief is so
often accompanied, the feeling of unworthiness triumphant,
and the nobler and more true swept away

<!-- page 406 -->

before the tide of successful wrong,&mdash;Roger fallen,
and Stephen raised in his place,&mdash;produced of themselves
a partial arrest of all Edmund's faculties. The
feeling was not a selfish one. He had never anticipated,
never contemplated, the position of heir and
future head of the family; but the extraordinary
overturn of all justice or any moral balance in the
world, when the good and true were thus thrown
down to make way for the false and evil, produced in
him that pause of hopelessness, that sense of incapacity
to understand or contend with the apparently
blind and inexorable fate that seems so often to shape
human affairs, which makes action impossible, and
sickens the heart. And then the curious attitude of
Elizabeth, as incomprehensible as fate, repelling and
attracting him at once, added so much more to the
paralyzing effect. But when he thought of Stephen's
possible suit, the suit that he divined with an angry
alarm which was more than jealousy, Edmund's dormant
energy awoke. The man who had taken his inheritance,
who had killed his brother, who had ruined
Lily Ford, should not, must not, soil the pure name
and break the heart of Elizabeth Travers. No! She
might not be for Edmund,&mdash;he believed she would
never be for him,&mdash;but she must not be thrown away
upon one unworthy.</p>

<p>Lily Ford! Edmund came to himself after the
long suspension of his energies: he had not done his
duty by his dead brother in this respect, at least, which
Roger would have thought the most important of all.
He had not sought out Lily, nor tried to save her,
nor carried out Roger's wishes in regard to her. Edmund
did not believe that it was possible to save
Lily; but wherever the poor girl now was, she could

<!-- page 407 -->

not but be in trouble and misery, and to find her
might be to save Elizabeth. The notion was, if not
selfish, yet not single. It aimed at two objects, and
the less direct was the more important in his eyes.
But yet, apart from Elizabeth and all her concerns,
he had a duty to Lily, too. He was the executor of
Roger's wishes, and it ought to have been his first
business to find her. What matter that the thought
of her was odious to him; that she embodied in her
slightness and trifling unimportance all the misfortunes
that had crushed Roger,&mdash;the loss of his tranquillity,
his fortune, his career, finally his very life?
A creature of so little account, with nothing but her
prettiness, her foolish education; a girl whom Stephen's
careless wooing could lead to her destruction,&mdash;and
she had cost Roger everything, his happiness
and his life! The thought roused in Edmund a silent
rage against human fate and the helplessness of man,
and towards her, the trifling instrument of so much
harm, a sick contempt and indignation, a horror of
the sight of her and of her ill-omened name. But
yet he had a duty to fulfill, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;her
story might yet be of some service; it might
save Elizabeth. It was this hope, more than any juster
sentiment, which turned his steps toward the West
Lodge. Mrs. Ford had appealed to him to find her
daughter; and though he had not succeeded in doing
that, the appeal justified his inquiries. Time had
flown heavily but quickly during this interval of inaction;
yet, after all, a month had not passed since
Roger's death.</p>

<!-- page 408 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXVIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE WEST LODGE.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was about noon when Edmund approached the
lodge, and everything recalled to him the last time
he had been there, which was so short a while ago,
and yet seemed to belong to another life. He remembered
every incident, even all the appearances, of that
day: the anxious mother hurrying out at the sound
of his step; the father, all blanched in his rough out-of-door
redness and brownness with the horror of a
catastrophe which was worse than death; his passion
and threats against the man who had betrayed his
child, and the woman's pitiful attempts to restrain, to
comfort him, while herself in the grip of despair.
Poor people! tragic as their unintended influence had
been, they themselves were not less to be pitied on
that account; and he conjured up before him the miserable
little house with all its happiness blighted, the
shame that had taken the place of their foolish, innocent
pride, the weight of suspense, or still more
terrible knowledge, that must have crushed the unhappy
father and mother, so that his heart had become
very tender towards the unfortunate couple before
he reached their door. After all, they were not
to blame; and they had suffered even more bitterly
than the family of the other victim.</p>

<p>It seemed to Edmund that he must see tokens of
their wretchedness in the very air, as he drew near

<!-- page 409 -->

the little flowery place which had once been their
pride; and to see the garden as bright as ever, the
tall lilies, from which their child had got her name,
standing with all their buds ready to open along the
sunny borders, and everything in summer order, full
of sweetness and bloom, filled him with involuntary
surprise. The morning sun shone upon the red roof
and waving trees; the door stood open; a tranquil
cat lay sunning herself upon the window ledge; a
brood of little yellow chickens flitted about under the
charge of an anxious mother hen. Nothing more
peaceful, more full of humble ease and comfort, could
be. The whole seemed to breathe a silent contradiction
to Edmund's troubled thoughts. Yet the sun
will shine, the flowers will bloom, the unconscious
creatures thrive and enjoy their little life, whatever
misery may reign within the house, he said to himself,
with a curious sense of incongruity, almost of disappointment.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, he heard voices in raised and
angry tones within the house, and, unconsciously listening,
distinguished with consternation indescribable
the voice of Stephen addressing some one with loud
authority. "You must clear out of here!" he was
saying, in a tone so little subdued that any passer-by
must have heard. "I know nothing about notice. I
tell you you must clear out of here. I want the place.
Get out at once: do you hear? You'll be paid in
place of your notice, if you've any right to it, which
I don't believe you have. You think I'm to be put
off with tricks and excuses, to gain time, but you're
mistaken. You must get out to-morrow at latest: do
you hear? I want the place for a servant of my
own."</p>

<!-- page 410 -->

<p>"Sir," replied the voice of Mrs. Ford, "my 'usband's
not here, and I can't make you no answer;
but turn a servant away there's no master can, without
warning. I've been in service all my life, and if
I didn't know that, who should? It's all the protection
poor servants has. I'm not saying nothing
again going"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had better not," said Stephen, "or I'll have
you turned out, which perhaps would be the quickest
way."</p>

<p>"I said as I'm not saying nothing again going,"
said Mrs. Ford, raising her voice. "We've allays
meant to go. It's not as if we were badly off or had
no friends; and Ford isn't one as can stand new
masters and new laws. He's ready to go, but he
won't go without his warning, as if he was turned off
for something bad. I don't want to say nothing disrespectful,
but we has our pride the same as other
folks, and Ford, he won't stir without his legal warning.
I mightn't stand out myself," the woman continued,
with a sound as of coming tears, "for the sake
of peace, but Ford, he's not that sort of a man; he'll
not be turned out like a thief,&mdash;him as has served
the Squire man and boy."</p>

<p>"Don't give me any of your impudence," said Stephen;
"that is just how he shall be turned out. I
give you your choice,&mdash;clear out at once, or I'll have
the police to-morrow to throw your things out of the
window. Hallo! what do <i>you</i> want here?"</p>

<p>This was addressed to Edmund, who had come in
unnoticed, behind him, to the little trim kitchen, where
Mrs. Ford stood on her own hearth as in a citadel,
flushed, with a look of resistance on her homely face,
but her apron in her hand, ready to wipe off the

<!-- page 411 -->

angry tears which were very near coming, and a huskiness
growing in her throat.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Edmund. "There
must be some mistake. I could not help hearing
what you were saying. What has Ford done? My
father would never bundle them out in this way unless
there's a very serious reason; he will listen to what
they've got to say."</p>

<p>Stephen turned round upon his brother with a
flushed and furious face. "You had better mind
your own business, Ned! I've got this to do, and
I'll allow no one to interfere."</p>

<p>"And as for what we've got to say," cried Mrs.
Ford shrilly, turning upon the new-comer,&mdash;"we've
got nothing to say, sir. I wouldn't stay, not if I
was paid to do it. We've got better friends than
ever the Mitfords was, that won't see us put upon.
And there's no man livin' as can have a better character
than my man. But we'll have our warning.
Police! Them that dares name such a name to me
know well as my man's out o' the way, and I've nobody
to stand up for me. Police!" Her voice ran
off into a shriek. "For shame of yourselves as call
yourselves gentlefolks, and can come and insult a woman
like that!"</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake," repeated Edmund.
"No one shall insult you while I am here. Stephen,"&mdash;he
turned and faced his brother, laying his hand
on his arm,&mdash;"whatever you have against these people,
let it be referred to my father. You know he will
never turn them out; and it's not for you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stephen threw up the arm which his brother had
touched with a fierce gesture, which brought back to
both their minds another scene. He was about to reply

<!-- page 412 -->

furiously, but the angry exclamation was stopped
on his lips by that recollection. He gave Edmund a
look of baffled rage. "I'll refer it to no man," he
cried, "and I'll be questioned by no man, and I'll
not argue with <i>you</i>, either. You know what I've got
to say. Clear out of this at once, or by Jove! I'll"&mdash;&mdash;
Stephen, however, was made of flesh and blood, like
other people. He could not stand against the
thoughts thus evoked. He turned round upon his heel
and quitted the house, leaving his threat unsaid. The
ghost of Roger came up again, and protected the humble
place. He could not stand before that shadow,
though he saw nothing, and though he was not in any
way turned from his purpose; but for the moment his
soul was disturbed, and he could say no more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford did not know why he had abandoned the
field. She thought it was perhaps Edmund, always
her friend, who had driven forth the enemy; but when
the angry visitor had withdrawn, those tears which
were so near falling came at once. "Oh, that any
gentleman should have named the police to me!" she
cried. "Oh, that I should have lived to be threatened
with that, and my things thrown out o' window! Mr.
Edmund, don't say nothing, for I'll never forget it,
I'll never forget it; not if the Squire was to come on
his bended knees, and ask me himself to stay!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," observed Edmund. "I don't
understand it. I came to"&mdash;&mdash; He paused here, and
looked round the comfortable room, where there was
no sign of neglect or downfall. It was quite true that
Mrs. Ford was the sort of woman to keep her house
tidy, whatever happened, but he could not associate
the trim room with any misfortune. "I have not seen
you," he said, "since before&mdash;the great trouble we

<!-- page 413 -->

have had." He felt that it would be easier to inquire
into her circumstances after he had made some allusion
to his own.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Ford stopped her angry sobs.
"Oh, sir," she cried, "we was very sorry! Nobody
would ever have spoken to me like that if Mr. Roger
had a' been to the fore! Oh, I don't hold with new
masters that can speak like that to a woman, and her
husband's back turned. And us that didn't mean to
stay,&mdash;us as was going to give warning from one day
to another! But without he has his just warning,
Ford'll never go. He's a man as stands upon his
rights!"</p>

<p>"When I was last here," said Edmund, "you were
in great trouble."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford took scarcely a moment to recover herself.
She put down her apron from her eyes, which
were still wet, but immediately became watchful and
full of strange defiance and light. "Was we, sir?"
she asked, with an appearance of surprise and a sudden
smile, as if the affair had been so trifling as to
escape her memory.</p>

<p>"You were in great trouble," repeated Edmund,
with some impatience. "You were almost in despair.
Lily had left home, and you didn't know where she
was. You thought it might have been my brother
Roger"&mdash;Edmund spoke the words with an effort&mdash;"who
had taken her away."</p>

<p>"Lord bless us!" said the woman, "what things do
get into folks' heads! I remember now. I was just
like a mad woman. Ford, he never gave in to it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Ford was as bad, or worse,
than you. He said he would kill the man who"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"So he did,&mdash;so he did! Them things go out of

<!-- page 414 -->

your mind when you find out as it was all silly fancies
and not true. Dear, bless us all! so we did; ravin'
like mad folks, as if our Lily&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Edmund, I
don't blame you: you think as poor folks has no feelings;
but I wouldn't have put you in mind of the like
of that, if I had been you!"</p>

<p>She gave him a look of injured feeling, yet of magnanimous
forgiveness, and laughed a little, with her
apron still held in her hand.</p>

<p>"It was thoughtless of the child," she continued,
looking down upon the apron, which she twisted in her
fingers. "I don't say nothing else. But one as never
thought a wrong thought, nor knew what wickedness
was, how was she to suppose as we'd take such fancies
into our heads? I was that ashamed I couldn't look
her in the face,&mdash;to think as I had ever mistrusted
my Lily! But, thank God! she don't know, not to
this day; and them as would tell her would be cruel,&mdash;oh,
it would be cruel! I would sooner die nor do
it, though I'm nothing but a poor woman, and no
scholard nor a gentleman, like you!"</p>

<p>"You may be sure," replied Edmund, "that Lily
shall never hear anything of the sort from me. I am
very glad your fears have turned out to be vain. Is
she here now?"</p>

<p>"She's far better off," answered Mrs. Ford.
"She's with friends that think a deal of her,&mdash;oh, a
great deal of her! She's kept like a lady, and never
puts her hand to a thing but what she pleases, and
books to read and a pianny to play upon, and everything
she can set her face to. Oh, she's better off
than she could be with Ford and me."</p>

<p>"Is this the account she gives you? Are you quite
sure it is true? Don't you know where she is?" Edmund

<!-- page 415 -->

asked, with again a sickening thrill of horror.
"Do you take all this merely upon her word?"</p>

<p>"I'd take the Bank of England upon her word!"
cried the mother, with a confusion of ideas not difficult
to understand. "Me and the lady&mdash;the lady
that makes Lily so happy&mdash;more happy,&mdash;and I do
grudge a bit to know it, I'll not deny my mean ways&mdash;more
happy than she was with me."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ford," said Edmund, "are you sure you are
not being once more deceived?" He was very much
in earnest and very serious; confused more than it is
possible to say by the mother's evident ignorance, by
Stephen's strange appearance here, which was scarcely
credible if Lily was still in his power, and by all the
bewildering circumstances which seemed to contradict
each other. Mrs. Ford, on her side, flung her apron
from her, and confronted him with a glowing countenance
and eyes aflame.</p>

<p>"I was never deceived!" she cried. "Me, deceived!
Oh, if I was weak for a moment, and came
and cried out to you in my trouble, it was because I
was a silly woman and didn't know no better. Deceived!
I could tell you a name as would bring you
down on your knees, Mr. Edmund, to ask her pardon,&mdash;yes,
on your knees, that's the word! Lily's
where she has a right to be, and that's among ladies,
like what she is herself; ladies as is her friends and
our friends too," cried Mrs. Ford, "mine and my
'usband's, all for the sake of Lily, and has offered us
a home, and a better home nor here. And Ford, he
was to have given the master warning this very day,
if it hadn't been as my heart just clung a bit to the
flowers. But without his warning he'll not budge a
step,&mdash;no, not for all the police in the world, neither

<!-- page 416 -->

him nor me; and you may tell the master that, Mr.
Edmund! We've served him honest and true for
more than twenty year: is that a reason to turn us
out like thieves at a day's notice? But we'll not go
without our just warning,&mdash;no, not a step, neither
Ford nor me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford made this long speech with a fervor and
passion which had its natural result, and plunged her
at the end into a fit of indignant tears.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," returned Edmund. "I
am sure my father never meant this. There must be
some mistake. And Stephen&mdash;what Stephen could
mean&mdash;&mdash; I am bewildered altogether. I don't understand
your story, and I don't understand his action;
but I promise you you shall not be turned out if I
can help it; certainly you shall not be turned out."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I can tell you what he means: he's got
somebody of his own as he wants to put in, and it's
well known that there's little mercy for them as comes
in Mr. Stephen's way. I wouldn't be in Mr. Stephen's
power, not for anything that could be given
me; and that's why I could bite my tongue out that
I wouldn't let Ford give warning. Oh, it's easy to
understand Mr. Stephen; he don't let no one stand in
his way."</p>

<p>"You are doing my brother injustice," Edmund
said; but he had little spirit in Stephen's cause, and
he was too much bewildered to be able to see light one
way or another. That Stephen should thus venture
to insult the people he had so deeply injured seemed
beyond belief, and so was the whole confused mystery
of Lily,&mdash;the ladies with whom she was supposed to
be, the friends, though the unhappy mother had declared
at the first stroke of the calamity that she had

<!-- page 417 -->

no friends. Edmund did not know what to think or
say. He went back across the park completely perplexed,
feeling that he had lost every landmark, and
all was chaos and confusion around him. Was it,
after all, the common tale of betrayal and ruin?
Was it something entirely different? Was Stephen
the cold-blooded destroyer, who, after he had ruined
the daughter, could attempt to conceal his crime by
driving away the helpless poor people from their
home? He could not tell what to think. Was there
perhaps some unsuspected third party, who was the
criminal or who was the saviour? Edmund felt that
he could make nothing of it, one way or another. As
for the hope which he had entertained of injuring
Stephen in the eyes of Elizabeth by means of Lily's
wretched story,&mdash;for that was how his project now
appeared to him,&mdash;he felt ashamed to the bottom
of his heart of this unworthy purpose. Stephen was
without mercy, without kindness, bent on his own
ends, and tolerating no interference; but in this matter,
perhaps, after all, he was innocent. He could not
have tried to crush Lily's parents if Lily had owed
her destruction to him: a man may be bad, but not
so bad as that! Compunction came into Edmund's
soul: to do injustice to any man was terrible to him.</p>

<p>A brief conversation which he had with Stephen
before dinner did not, however, mend matters. Stephen
took the first word. He asked what the devil
Edmund meant by interfering with what was no business
of his.</p>

<p>"As much of mine as yours," retorted Edmund;
"more, perhaps, since I know the people better. You
could not really think of taking it upon yourself to
turn one of my father's old servants away?"</p>

<!-- page 418 -->

<p>"Old servants be &mdash;&mdash;!" exclaimed Stephen. "A
pair of detestable old hypocrites! What use is an
old fellow like that in the covers? I'll have all those
vermin of old servants cleared away."</p>

<p>"Fortunately you are not the master, Steve. No,
neither am I; I pretend to no authority."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," rejoined Stephen, with an
insolent laugh; "you're out of it, at least. And I
can tell you I'll stand no nonsense, Ned,&mdash;no protecting
of a set of rogues and toadies. They think they
can defy me, and that Mr. Edmund will see them
righted, as they call it. I'll have none of that. The
estate is to be mine, and I mean to manage it my own
way."</p>

<p>"The estate is not yours while it is my father's,
Stephen; and I shall certainly appeal to him not to
suffer the Fords to be turned out in this summary
way. They are old retainers,&mdash;they were favorites
of my mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure; and the pretty daughter!
There was perhaps more than one of us hit in that
quarter," cried Stephen, with a rude laugh. "That
explains everything. It is a crime to meddle with <i>her</i>
father, eh?"</p>

<p>He stood with insolent eyes fixed upon Edmund's,
a flush on his face, defiance in his look. Edmund did
not know the keen pang of mortification in Stephen's
mind which made him seize this opportunity of mischief,
and there was something exasperating in the
look which tried his patience almost beyond endurance.
It was the second time in which all his self-control
had been necessary not to strike his brother to
the ground. They stood straight up in front of each
other for a moment, looking into each other's faces

<!-- page 419 -->

like deadly foes, not like brothers. Then Edmund
turned slowly away.</p>

<p>"We cannot fight," he said, "because we are both
Mitfords, and I will not dishonor my father's house by
a scuffle; but you know what I think better than if I
said it, either by words or blows."</p>

<p>"That for your blows!" cried Stephen, snapping
his fingers; but he turned away more quickly than his
brother. Even he could not but feel that there had
already been enough of that.</p>

<!-- page 420 -->

<div class="center" id="XXXIX">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XXXIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE SQUIRE IN THE WRONG.</p>

</div>

<p>THEY both watched their father during the hour of
dinner, which passed as usual, in a suppressed antagonism
and careful avoidance of dangerous subjects.
But neither Edmund nor Stephen had the advantage
for that night. Mr. Mitford fretfully declined to listen
to what either had to say. He had no mind for a discussion
with the son who was now his eldest son, and
to whom he was doing wrong. His conscience was
not very tender, but it was vulnerable in this respect.
There could be no doubt that he was wronging Edmund.
Edmund, perhaps, had not been too complaisant.
He had stood by Roger, and deserted his father;
but Roger was dead, poor fellow, and except in that
point the Squire was aware that Edmund had given
him no just cause of offense; and yet he was cast out
of his natural place and disinherited for no reason.
Mr. Mitford could not bear to think of it; and to allow
himself to be let in, as he said, for a discussion with
that fellow at night, when there could be no chance of
deliverance, when he probably would bring up everything
and go over the whole ground&mdash;No, no; the
Squire took refuge in the first excuse which occurred
to him, and that was a headache. "I don't feel at all
the thing," he remarked. "I've got a very queer
feeling here," tapping his forehead as he spoke. "It's
worry and the hot weather, and things in general.

<!-- page 421 -->

Robson is very decided on the subject. I am never to
bother about business, he tells me, when I feel like
this. I suppose it will do to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"It will do to-morrow, certainly," assented Edmund,
looking at Stephen, "so long as I am assured
that no further steps will be taken."</p>

<p>"Steps taken! I should like to see any man taking
steps on my property without my knowledge," the
Squire said, still more fretfully. The secret trouble
in his conscience was telling upon him more than the
hot weather. The power to do as he liked with his own
was very dear to him, but he could not obliterate the
sense of justice which was in his imperious and selfish,
yet not altogether undisciplined nature. There were
things which he could not do with any ease of mind,
and Edmund's disinheritance hurt him, even though
he was not brave enough to undo it. The safest
thing for him, with that queer feeling in his head
against which the doctor had warned him, was to cast
that thought behind him, though it was not very easy
to do, and above all to avoid agitating conferences
with his son whom he had wronged, at the dead of
night, so to speak.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to bed early," said the Squire.
"I'm not up to any more worry to-night. To-morrow
you can say what you like, Ned: it's fresher and
cooler in the morning. I'll hear then all you've got
to say."</p>

<p>"It is not very much I have got to say: a few minutes
would do it."</p>

<p>"I tell you," cried the Squire angrily, "I can't
bear any worry to-night!"</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself, sir. I'll see to everything&mdash;you
may leave it to me," said Stephen.

<!-- page 422 -->

"You ought to be saved all worry, at your time of
life."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford turned furiously upon his younger son,
though his head, with that leap of the angry blood to
his temples, felt more queer than ever. "What do
you know about my time of life?" he asked. "I'll
trouble you to let me and my affairs alone. I'll have
no man meddle in my affairs. You think I am in my
dotage, I suppose; but you shall find out the difference."
He could not refrain from a threat, though it
was vague; not like the threats which had failed to
subdue Roger, for the shame of changing his mind a
second time was strong upon the Squire. He could
not, he felt, do that sort of thing a second time.</p>

<p>But when he had retired to his library, and closed
the door, though he could shut out both the son he
had wronged and the son he had promoted, he could
not shut out the troublesome thoughts that tormented
him, nor return to the easy mind which used to be
his. That shadow of Roger, dead, stood by him as it
stood by Stephen, as it stood between Edmund and
Elizabeth. The birthright with which, in his passion
and self-will, he had interfered would not allow itself
to be forgotten. His head continued to throb, the
pulse kept on beating in his temples. Finally that
commotion in his head, which he could not get the
better of, drove him to bed, which was the best place
for him, and where he slept heavily but soundly, far
beyond the reach of the interrupting and disturbing
elements round him. Nothing as yet had occurred
in his life which had proved capable of keeping the
Squire from his sleep.</p>

<p>Edmund was admitted to an audience next day,
when Mr. Mitford was quite himself again. To see

<!-- page 423 -->

him seated there, clean-shaved, faultlessly arrayed in
his light shooting suit, with a rosebud in his button-hole,
and his complexion almost as clear as the flower,
no one could have believed in the head that felt
queer, the temples that beat, the blood which ran in
so strong a tide. He looked perfectly cool and calm,
as he sat behind his writing-table, in all that fresh
array of good health and good manners,&mdash;but not,
perhaps, perfectly good manners; for he was angry
with Edmund still, because he felt that he had
wronged him.</p>

<p>"Well," he observed, half roughly, "what is it you
have got to say?"</p>

<p>"I feel as if we were boys again, and I was the
sneak who was coming to tell. Have you heard anything
about it, sir, from Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Stephen takes too much upon him," answered the
Squire. "Whatever may happen in the end, by
George! I'm master of my own concerns in the mean
time, and neither Stephen nor any one else shall interfere."</p>

<p>"I will make no complaint of Stephen. What I
want is that you should protect some poor people, who
perhaps don't deserve very much at our hands, but it
is not any fault of theirs. It seems strange I should
come to you about them. I want to speak about the
Fords."</p>

<p>"The Fords!" The Squire muttered something
under his breath, which might be forgiven him, though
it was not a blessing. "What, that girl again!" he
said, with something hoarse and husky in his voice.
"Don't tell me that it's you this time, Ned. Is she
a witch, or what is she, that her name should come up
between us again?"</p>

<!-- page 424 -->

<p>"It is nothing about her," Edmund cried, with a
sense of profounder sympathy with his father than he
had yet felt.</p>

<p>But before he could enter into further explanations
he was interrupted by Larkins, who came in solemnly
with a card. "The gentleman would like to see you,
sir, on business," he said.</p>

<p>"Gavelkind! Who's Gavelkind? I've heard the
name before. What's his business,&mdash;did he tell you
what was his business? I can't let every stranger in
that comes to me on business. It might be an old-clothes
man, for anything one can tell, though I think
I know the name; it's a queer name."</p>

<p>"I know both the name and the man, sir; you have
met him at Mount Travers. He is the man who manages
all their business affairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, at Mount Travers! Show him in, Larkins."
The Squire looked up with a half-humorous, puzzled
look. He was not humorous by nature, but the occasion
moved him. "It can't be her&mdash;herself&mdash;sending
to propose&mdash;for Stephen?" Mr. Mitford
said.</p>

<p>"For Stephen!" Edmund did not see any humor
in the suggestion. He did not laugh, as his father
did; a deep red mounted to his face. "Why for Stephen?"
He forgot the absurdity of the idea altogether
in the keen pang of thus being left out of all
calculation. His mind had not dwelt upon the loss of
what was now his birthright, but to be thus put out
of the question was a cutting and insulting injury.
He awaited the entrance of Mr. Gavelkind with mingled
anxiety and offense; of course what the Squire
said was altogether ridiculous in every way, but yet&mdash;&mdash;
He recovered his common sense, happily, and his

<!-- page 425 -->

usual color before Mr. Gavelkind came in, with his
absent look, yet keen, penetrating eyes, his head projecting
in a forward stoop from his thin shoulders, a
very large hat in his hands.</p>

<p>"I have come from Miss Travers," he said, when
he had seated himself. He had given one of his quick
looks, as he came in, at Mitford and his son, but he
did not look at the Squire as he spoke. He raised
one leg across the knee of the other and caressed it,
slowly smoothing the cloth of his trousers as if it had
been a child. "I've come to make some inquiries."</p>

<p>Whether he paused to tantalize their curiosity, or
to make a little mystery, or to get his breath, or for
nothing at all, it would be hard to say; probably the
last was the true explanation. He attached no importance
to what he had to say, and did not imagine
that it would excite any special interest; but half because
of the Squire's jest, half from the general excitement
which was in the air, both father and son
listened as if some special intimation were about to
be made.</p>

<p>"Yes?" remarked Mr. Mitford. "I'll be happy
to answer any of Miss Travers's inquiries. I only
wish she had come to put them herself."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's impossible, in the circumstances,"
returned the lawyer. "I'm sure I don't know why.
Ladies go to many places a great deal less suitable
than the house of a man that might be their father;
but that's neither here nor there."</p>

<p>"And of one who would have no objection to be her
father," said the Squire, with a laugh. "You can tell
her I said so; she has always been a great favorite of
mine."</p>

<p>"There are many people with whom she is a favorite,

<!-- page 426 -->

especially now when she has all her uncle's
money. Perhaps you, like me, Mr. Mitford, liked her
before; but, as I was saying, that's not the question.
It appears there's a man in your service whom she
wishes to take into hers."</p>

<p>"Several, I shouldn't wonder," said the Squire,
"and there is one I can recommend. To tell the
truth, we were planning to go over to Mount Travers
for the purpose." And at this intended witticism he
laughed loudly, which was not, to do him justice, Mr.
Mitford's way. But perhaps to have been seized with
a humorous idea had demoralized him. He was proud
of the unusual good thing, and wanted to keep up the
joke.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Gavelkind, looking vaguely round
with eyes that made a slight pause upon Edmund.
The Squire felt that he had made a mistake, and
naturally hastened to make it worse.</p>

<p>"No, not that fellow," he cried; "he hasn't spirit
enough to teach a pretty girl to know her own mind."</p>

<p>It was all so entirely out of character, so unbecoming,
almost indecent, such a wild and causeless betrayal
of his plans to a man who as likely as not might
be his adversary, that the Squire lost his head altogether;
and the fact that he was more than half conscious
of his folly only made it the greater. "I've
got a soldier boy," he added.</p>

<p>Edmund got up, and walked hastily away. It is
difficult to sit still and hear one's own people commit
themselves, even when one is not much in sympathy
with them. But after the momentary impulse of vexation,
he came as hastily back, conscious, as it followed
him, though he could not see it, of the sober
lawyer's wondering, inquiring glance. "Mr. Gavelkind

<!-- page 427 -->

can scarcely have come to make inquiries concerning
your sons, sir," he remarked.</p>

<p>"No," said the lawyer, still smoothing assiduously
the cloth of his trousers, "it was not that. Ladies
don't make the inquiries they ought in that sort of
way. It's about a man of quite a different sort,&mdash;far
less important, no doubt. He's been gamekeeper
at Melcombe, I hear, for a number of years,
and now I'm told he's going to be turned off summarily.
Miss Travers would take him into her service,
knowing something of his family; but she would like
to know first if there is anything really against him.
Dismissal at a moment's notice, after a service of
years, looks bad. It seemed to me that, before allowing
her to decide, I had better inquire."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford looked from Edmund to the speaker,
and back again. He had been checked, and almost
snubbed, and was aware that he deserved it. The
consciousness made him somewhat angry and more
than ever severe. "Who is it?" he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"It's a man of the name of Ford. I suppose I
must allow that there's been some kind of negotiation
going on before this. For some reason or other,&mdash;I
suppose because she thought him a trustworthy man,&mdash;Miss
Travers had offered him"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ford!" said the Squire, interrupting almost
rudely. "Why, that's the second time I've heard of
Ford this morning, and it was you, Ned"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I came to tell you, sir, just what Mr. Gavelkind
has told you: that by some mistake, which I don't understand,
Ford had been told that he must leave at
once. There could be no reason for it,&mdash;it could be
nothing but a mistake."</p>

<p>"Ford!" the Squire repeated. "Why, he's the&mdash;hum&mdash;ha&mdash;&mdash;

<!-- page 428 -->

I don't understand what you mean.
Ford! I've not said anything about Ford. I had forgotten
the fellow's very existence, with all I've had to
think of."</p>

<p>"I knew that must be the case," said Edmund,
eagerly. "You see my father had no such intention.
It was a mistake."</p>

<p>"The mistake must have gone pretty far," said Mr.
Gavelkind, "for it appears the man came over this
morning to say that he was threatened with the police
if he did not turn out to-day."</p>

<p>"I should like to know by whom!" cried the
Squire. "Ford! Well, yes, I wasn't over-pleased
with him once. I meant to get rid of them, Ned, you
know. I don't take it kindly of Miss Travers that she
should parley with my servants, Mr. Gavelkind, and
the fellow had better go; but I never said a word
about him, and I should like to know who's taken
upon himself to interfere. It's a confounded piece of
impertinence, whoever has done it."</p>

<p>"I may conclude, then, that there's nothing against
the man," said Mr. Gavelkind, with his mild voice.
"There's some private reason which makes Miss
Travers take an interest in him. Ladies are governed
greatly by private reasons, which they don't always
confide to their man of business. Nothing against
him, Mr. Mitford? Trustworthy, and all the rest of
it; so that if he does leave your service after all"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's free to leave my service as soon as he
likes!" cried the Squire. "I had very nearly sent
him off,&mdash;how long is it since, Ned? I'd rather
never hear the fellow's name again. But I don't think
Miss Travers should meddle with another man's servants,"
he said, calming himself down, with his usual

<!-- page 429 -->

prudential afterthought. "I've the highest opinion
of the lady,&mdash;the very highest opinion; but between
gentlemen, Mr. Gavelkind&mdash;&mdash; Ah, I forgot: it's not
between gentlemen; it's"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Between a lady and a man it's not such plain sailing,"
remarked the lawyer. "Some stand out, all the
same, and for my part I think none the worse of
them: but a great many give in; and when you're
not married to them, nor bound to them," Mr. Gavelkind
added, reflectively, "perhaps it is the best way."</p>

<p>"She's got no preserves that I know of, and not
much forest land nor wood of any kind to speak of:
what does she want with Ford? On second thoughts,"
said the Squire, with a vague notion that Ford had
something to tell which might be supposed to be to the
discredit of the family, "I think I'd rather keep the
man. He knows every inch of my covers, and he's
useful in his way."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But since he's ordered off, on the risk of being
turned out by the police if he doesn't go to-day"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This brought the purple flush again to Mr. Mitford's
brow. "I've got to find out who's done that!"
he cried. "Who's done it, Ned? It's confounded
impertinence, whoever it is. By George! if I find the
man who has taken it upon himself to interfere"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I've accomplished my business," said Mr.
Gavelkind. "I mustn't stop you from proceeding
with yours. The man's honest, I may say, if it should
come to anything with Miss Travers? Present employer
wishing to retain him always the best testimonial.
No, she doesn't do anything in the way of
game, and what she wants with a keeper is more than
I can say. But ladies go upon private reasons, and
nothing more was confided to me. I wish you good-morning,

<!-- page 430 -->

Mr. Mitford." The old lawyer gave Edmund
a look which indicated his desire for further
talk. "I wish you'd come and see them," he said, in
a low tone, as Edmund accompanied him to the door.
"There's something going on I don't understand.
There's some mystery among the ladies, I don't know
what it is. I wish you'd come and see."</p>

<p>"I fear I have no eye for mysteries; and I am not
sure that they care to see me; why should they? I
am not a very cheerful guest."</p>

<p>"Of course they care to see you," said the old lawyer.
"Don't lose your chance for nonsense, if you'll
allow me to say so. And you know a little about human
nature, so you must have an eye for mysteries.
Come and see them; and come while I'm still there."</p>

<p>"EDMUND!"</p>

<p>Before Edmund could get his hand free from the
lingering clasp of Mr. Gavelkind, his father's voice was
loudly audible, calling him, which was a very unusual
thing to hear in Melcombe. The call was repeated with
some vehemence before he could obey. He was absent
scarcely five minutes, but the Squire regarded even
that little interval with suspicion; and in the mean
time the scene had changed. Stephen had come in
when the visitor withdrew, and had, it was evident, been
hotly received; for though he had thrown himself into
a chair with an appearance of indifference, his attempt
at ease was belied by the heated color on his cheeks.
Mr. Mitford was fulminating across his writing-table.
He turned his wrath upon the new-comer without a
pause.</p>

<p>"What did you want of that old rogue, Ned?
They're all rogues, the lot of them, and up to something
or other now,&mdash;that's clear,&mdash;trying to embroil
me with Lizzy Travers. And you go over to the other
side of course, and desert mine! Come in, and shut
the door. Now you're both here, perhaps I may get
to understand. Who is it that takes upon himself to
interfere in the management of my affairs? No one
has ever done it till now, and by George! I'll not have
it! I'll not have it! Not if you were twice the men
you are, both Stephen and you!"</p>

<!-- page 432 -->

<p>"I don't know what you are in such a rage about,"
remarked Stephen. "It is not much more than a week
since you ordered me to send in my papers, that I
might be free to take the trouble off your hands."</p>

<p>"I said nothing of the sort, sir. I never said anything
of the sort. I could not have said it, for I certainly
never meant it!" cried the Squire.</p>

<p>"If you please to say so," returned Stephen, with
cool impertinence; "there was no witness present, to
be sure. It must go either by your word or mine. It's
a conflict of testimony that's all."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say I am telling a lie, sir?" the
Squire demanded, furiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all; it is not I who make such accusations.
I only say that it is clear one of us has made a
great mistake."</p>

<p>"And that's I, of course, you mean to imply?"</p>

<p>"I never said so, sir," replied Stephen, with a shrug
of his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford was very angry. He got up and walked
about the room, with his hands deeply dug into his
pockets, saying to himself from time to time, "By
George!" with other exclamations perhaps less innocent.
It was as good a way as another of blowing off
his wrath. Meanwhile, the culprit sat with an air of
coolness and contemptuous indifference which exasperated
his father more and more, stretching out his long
legs in such a way as to bar the passage and confine
the Squire to his own side.</p>

<p>"If I ever said a word that could be twisted into
such a meaning, it must have been when I thought you
a little serious, impressed by what had happened,&mdash;as
you might have been, if you had any feeling: but
there's no feeling of that sort left in the world, so far

<!-- page 433 -->

as I can see. Here's one of you trying to get the reins
out of my hands, and the other holding secret confabs
with a pettifogging lawyer, a fellow that wants to
bring me to book,&mdash;me!" the Squire cried, with an
indignant, almost incredulous sense of undeserved insult
and injury. "Heaven knows I have had trouble
enough, one way or another, on account of my sons,"
he went on, changing into a tone which was almost
tearful; for to think of all he had suffered overcame
him with self-pity. "All the trouble I have known
has been connected with one or other of you. The man
who has no children has the best of it. But there is one
thing you may be quite sure of, and you had better both
of you mark what I have to say. I will not have you
meddling in my affairs. Thank Heaven, I'm very
well capable of minding my own business. Whatever
I may be supposed to have said, this is my last word.
I'll have none of your meddling,&mdash;neither yours, Stephen,
nor yours, Ned; neither the one nor the other!
The first man who interferes shall go. I'll have none
of it&mdash;I'll have"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stephen got up from his chair with a laugh, shaking
himself out of all creases in his well-fitting clothes.
"That's just what I should like, for one," he remarked.
"Don't restrain your feelings, sir. I am delighted to
go."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford turned like a bull who is confronted by
a new assailant; but a man and a father cannot take a
ribald upon his horns, like that well-provided animal.
He stared for a moment, with fiery eyes that seemed to
be leaping from their sockets, and then he recognized,
as the angriest man must, that barrier of the immovable
which an altogether unimpressionable human
being, however insignificant, can place before the most

<!-- page 434 -->

mighty. Stephen was not to be influenced by any of
those causes which make it possible for a domestic despot
to have his way. He was not afraid of the penalty
involved. He had no reluctance to see his father compromise
his own dignity by unbecoming threats or
violence. Edmund, moved by that sentiment, had
turned away, willing rather to submit or to retire than
to be thus compelled to witness a scene which made him
ashamed for his father. But Stephen knew none of
these delicacies; he was entirely free from all such restraints.
The Squire was like any other old fellow,
who threatened a great deal more than he could ever
perform. And Mr. Mitford recognized this, as he
stared at the heir of his choice, this young man to whom
he had given the chief place in the family,&mdash;that being,
quite invulnerable, untouched by sympathy, natural respect,
or human feeling, who is the fit and only opponent
of the family tyrant. He stared and gasped with
exasperation unspeakable, and the feeling that Jove's
thunderbolt would be the only effectual instrument to
level the rebel to the ground instantaneously. Perhaps,
vulgarly considered, Prometheus was something of this
intolerable sort to the father of gods and men. The
cool cynicism of Stephen's eyes struck his father like
a blow. They said, "You have done that once too
often already. Do it,&mdash;I'd like it. Make an old
fool of yourself!" But after that astonished, incredulous
stare of the Jupiter <i>manqu&eacute;</i>, Mr. Mitford came to
himself. Passion itself could not stand before those
cynic eyes. Virtue and heroic suffering are alone supposed
to possess this restraining power; but perhaps it
will be found that the less elevated defiance has the
greater influence, the sneering devil being more potent
with the common mind than the serious hero. Mr.

<!-- page 435 -->

Mitford made the discovery that in whatsoever way he
might be able to establish his authority, this way would
not do. He solaced his personal discomfiture by an
attack upon the one remaining, who would not flout
nor defy him, and turned upon Edmund with a snort
of wrath.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think you'll curry favor with Lizzy
Travers," he cried, "by playing into her hands, and
defying me. You'll find that's not so: she's not the
girl to encourage a man to desert his own side."</p>

<p>Edmund was much surprised by this unexpected
attack. "Mr. Gavelkind is a friend of mine," he said,
"which was the reason I went out with him. I had
no thought of deserting my own side; but since you
blame me, I will venture to return to the original subject,
sir. Is Ford dismissed with your consent? And
if not, may not I go and reassure them, and let them
know that they are not to be hurried away?"</p>

<p>The Squire looked at Edmund severely. It gave
him great satisfaction to come upon some one who
would not rebel. He took a high tone. "One would
think," he remarked, "that the welfare of these people
was of more importance to you than the credit of your
family. They have not deserved much at my hands."</p>

<p>It struck Edmund with a sort of dreary amusement
that he should be the one to be accused of partiality
for the Fords,&mdash;he, who was the only one entirely uninfluenced
by them. He said with a faint smile, "I
am no partisan of the Fords,&mdash;it would be strange if I
were; but they have done nothing to deserve this, and
it would be cruel to punish them for a fault&mdash;for a
fault&mdash;which was not theirs."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that the girl was brought
up for any other end? Why, she was trained to inveigle

<!-- page 436 -->

one of my sons, or somebody else,&mdash;Ray Tredgold,
perhaps, who is not quite such a fool,&mdash;into making
a lady of her. A child could see that," said the
Squire, with indignation. "I cannot understand how
any man, considering all the circumstances, can speak
of the Fords to me."</p>

<p>"That was my idea," returned Stephen boldly.
"I felt that they ought to go, but I didn't think
that you ought to be bothered with the name of them.
If I went a little further than I ought to have done,
that was my idea. Their name can't be very agreeable
to any of us," he added, with a deep-drawn
breath. "If I went too far, that's my only excuse."</p>

<p>"Well, Steve," said the father, "I am glad you
see it as I do, and that, if you were wrong, it was
an error of judgment only. After what you've said,
I'll allow that. But Ned is one of the fellows that
like to turn the sword round in a wound. He thinks
that's the way to make a man forget."</p>

<p>"I thought solely of the injustice to them," urged
Edmund, "not of ourselves at all. It cannot be
worth your while, sir, on whatever provocation, to wage
civil war upon your gamekeeper. Send him away, by
all means,&mdash;I should be glad, I confess, to get rid
of the sound of their name; but let it be fairly, with
such warning as is natural, or at least with time
enough to provide themselves with another home.
Suppose they have been scheming, artful, whatever
you may call it: you can't punish them for that as for
a crime."</p>

<p>"It's a deal worse than many a crime," asserted
Stephen, with a black look which transformed his
face. "It's the sort of thing you smother vermin

<!-- page 437 -->

for. Even poaching I'd look over sooner. I don't
pretend to be one of your forgiving people. There
are some things I'll never forgive, nor forget."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford gave him a grateful look. He was
much relieved by the disappearance of Stephen's
sneer, and felt as if he had recovered his proper position
when his son condescended to explain. "I am
glad to see that you feel as I do, Steve," he repeated.
"Ned has his own ways of thinking, though I should
have supposed he had more feeling for his brother
than to stand up for the Fords. I don't want them
to make out a case for Lizzy Travers's charity, though.
I'll speak to Brown, and he shall buy them off and
get them out of the country; and you and I will go
over to Mount Travers and explain. You may do
some business for yourself at the same time," he said,
with a laugh, to which Stephen responded. The two
were once more in full intelligence, understanding each
other's thoughts and wishes.</p>

<p>To Edmund's sensitive ears the laugh was intolerable.
It was full of that rude and primitive meaning
which lurks so often in the private sympathetic chuckle
with which two men discuss a woman. He went out
of the room quickly, with a nervous impatience, over
which he had no control. In the experience of all
sensitive persons, there arises now and then a moment
when contrariety seems in the very air, and everything
turns against them. Edmund felt that on every side
his wishes, his feelings, his ideas of all that was just
and fit, were contradicted, and that the entire world
was out of harmony with him. Not only his father
and brother, and the atmosphere of the house which
was full of them, opposed him and jarred his nerves
and temper at every turn, but the most trifling things

<!-- page 438 -->

appeared to rise in antagonism, and cut every possibility
of relief. The <i>sourd</i>, mysterious something which
stood between him and Elizabeth, which made even
old Pax, his most familiar confidant, repellent and unharmonious,
scarcely affected him more than those
lesser jars of contradiction which met him at every
turn. That Mrs. Ford should have refused information
about Lily, that he should be supposed the champion
of the family, that it should be possible, however
falsely, to gibe at his forgetfulness of their disastrous
influence over Roger,&mdash;he whose heart was the only
one faithful to Roger,&mdash;exasperated him almost beyond
bearing. He went out with that sensation of
being unable to bear anything more, or endure another
moment of this contrariety and horrible antagonism
of everything, which is at once so natural, so
inevitable, so foolish. Women find relief in tears at
such moments, but Edmund could get no such relief;
everything was against him; he was despondent yet
exasperated, angry as well as sad. Why should he
go to Mount Travers, where everything was already
decided against him? Why stay here, where he was
put out of all influence, misrepresented, misunderstood;
where his attempt to do justice was taken for partiality
towards the offender, and his anxious endeavor
to carry out his dead brother's wishes repulsed as a
curiosity of his own? It was time, surely, for him to
shake the dust off his feet, and leave the place where
he was disinherited, contemned, and set aside. He
felt the jar of the vexation, of the contradiction, go
to his very soul. How much better to go away from
the house where he was displaced, from the love that
would have none of him, from the country where
his charities, his faithfulness, his desire to help and

<!-- page 439 -->

succor, were all misconceived! Roger had done it in
the most conclusive fashion, shaking off so many embarrassments
and troubles along with the mortal coil.
Edmund thought wistfully, with a certain envy, of his
brother's complete escape. He had no temptation to
put an end to his life, yet a great weariness took possession
of him. If he could but turn his back on
everything, flee far from them! Oh, for the wings of a
dove! But where? Not to some foreign land, which
was the ordinary commonplace expedient,&mdash;to change
the sky, but not the mind. What Edmund really
wanted was to escape from himself; and that, alas, is
what none can do.</p>

<p>At the same time, amid all this contrariety, there
was something, a spirit in his feet, driving him to that
high house on the hill, to which he had been invited
that morning. To see Mr. Gavelkind! He laughed,
with a bitter sense of humor, at that idea. The old
lawyer was his friend,&mdash;there was no scorn of him in
Edmund's mind; but with a heart full of Elizabeth,
to go to her man of business! It would have been
too ludicrous, if it had not been the greatest contradiction,
the most irritating contrariety of all.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XLI.</p>

<p class="small">AT MOUNT TRAVERS.</p>

</div>

<p>"YES, I am just going. I wish you could have
come a little earlier. I've been here three days,&mdash;to
be sure, one of them was a Sunday. There are a
great many things I should have liked to talk to you
about."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Edmund said; but he had not the
same sense that to talk things over with Mr. Gavelkind
was a matter of importance which the lawyer
seemed to feel on his side.</p>

<p>"I see; you don't feel that it's of very much consequence
what I think. Well, perhaps not. Few
things are of much importance taken separately; it's
when they come together that they tell. No, don't
apologize; I am in no danger of misunderstanding.
I'll tell you what, though: you shouldn't leave things
too long hanging in the wind."</p>

<p>"Hanging in the wind?"</p>

<p>"Come," said Mr. Gavelkind, "I don't intend to
summer it and winter it, as the country people say.
You and I have been able to understand each other
before now without putting a dot on every <i>i</i>. There's
something going on up there which I don't understand."</p>

<p>He pointed, with a wave of his hand, to the house
on the hill. The sun was blazing in all the plate-glass,
and made it flare over the whole country, as if

<!-- page 441 -->

it were some great heliographic apparatus. Edmund
had met the lawyer going down to the station by the
steep and short path which old Travers had made
through the grounds. He had a little bag in his hand,
and his coat over his arm.</p>

<p>"To have to do with ladies in business is a trial,"
he resumed. "In your own family it's a different
matter, and I'm fond of women for friends, notwithstanding
all that's said to the contrary; but to have
their business to do, and to hold them to it, and to
keep reason always uppermost, is almost too much for
me."</p>

<p>"I have heard you commend Miss Travers's capacity
for business, all the same."</p>

<p>"That I have, and meant it, too! She has a good
head, and a clear head; but there's always some
point in which reason is not the sole guide with women.
It may take a long time to find it out, but it
always appears at the end. There's this business
about these Fords&mdash;&mdash; Ah, Mrs. Travers!" exclaimed
Mr. Gavelkind, hastily transferring his coat to his
left arm that he might take off his hat. "I knew
you were out-of-doors, but I didn't think you would
venture down a steep road like this."</p>

<p>"I didn't. I came the other way, to say good-by
to you; I couldn't let you go without saying good-by.
And my compliments to Mrs. Gavelkind. I hope she
will really arrange some time to come with you and
stay a little while. Saturday to Monday I don't consider
a visit at all."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, I'm sure," said the lawyer.
"It's been Friday to Monday, this time, and a great
deal of business got through. I'll give my wife your
kind message. Miss Travers had already asked"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 442 -->

<p>"I dare say," said the old lady quickly, "that your
wife, being an older person, would not think much
of an invitation from Lizzy, while the mistress of the
house said nothing; but you can tell her from me that
it's all the same. We'll be highly pleased to see her
any time before the end of the summer. Good-by,
Mr. Gavelkind."</p>

<p>The lawyer shot a glance at Edmund underneath
his brows, but he took his leave very ceremoniously
of the old lady, who had been accompanied by a
female figure, a few steps behind her. She turned
round to take this companion's arm, to mount the
slope.</p>

<p>"Why, the girl is gone!" she cried. "Mr. Mitford,
I beg your pardon! I was so occupied in saying
good-by to Mr. Gavelkind that I've never said 'How
d' ye do' to you. I wonder if you'll give me your
arm to help me up the bank. Thank you. I've always
noticed you were nice to old people. And so
was your poor brother. Is it true what I hear, that
it's the youngest that is to succeed to the property?
Somebody told me so this very day."</p>

<p>"There is no question of succeeding to the property
at present, Mrs. Travers. My father is well and
strong, and I hope may keep it himself for many
years."</p>

<p>"That's a very proper feeling; I approve of it
greatly. When Lizzy marries, I hope it will not be
any one who will grudge me every day I live; for of
course I will leave her everything,&mdash;everything that
is in my power."</p>

<p>Edmund made a little bow of assent, but he did
not feel it necessary to enter into the possible sentiments
of the man whom Lizzy might marry. The

<!-- page 443 -->

old lady looked at him closely, her keen eyes undimmed
by the little gasps and pantings with which
she had dragged herself up the steep ascent.</p>

<p>"I have not so much in my power as you would
think," said Mrs. Travers, "for all the property belongs
to Lizzy after my death. Her uncle thought
that was only just, seeing that her father began the
business, though it was my husband who made the
money. Everybody has his own way of thinking,
Mr. Mitford, but I must say I felt it a little not to
have anything in my own power. Of course I should
have left it to Lizzy,&mdash;who else should I leave it to?&mdash;but
everybody likes to be trusted, and to have
something in their own power."</p>

<p>"No doubt," returned Edmund, gravely. The
little old lady clung to his arm, and kept looking up
from time to time suddenly, as if to take him at a
disadvantage, and read whatever unintentional meaning
might pass over his face.</p>

<p>"If she married a man whom I approved of, they
might go on living with me, perhaps. I would not
make it a promise; but if he were a person I liked,
and one who would behave properly to an elderly lady.
They don't generally, Mr. Mitford; when a woman
has ceased to be young, they have a way of looking at
her as if she had no right to live at all. Oh, I know
what I am saying. I am not Lizzy's mother, it is
true, but I should be more or less in the position of
a mother-in-law, and that is what I never could put up
with. Give a dog an ill-name and hang him, they
say; call a woman a mother-in-law, and it's the same
thing; though why a respectable woman should be
turned into a fiend by the marriage of her daughter I
have never been able to find out. Happily, Lizzy is

<!-- page 444 -->

not my daughter, but it comes to very much the same
thing."</p>

<p>As she paused for a reply, Edmund felt himself
obliged to say that the general hatred of mothers-in-law
was "only a joke."</p>

<p>"A joke! It's a joke in very bad taste, Mr.
Mitford. But you may rely upon it, I know what
I am talking about. You were very civil, giving me
your arm when that girl ran away. (It was very silly
of her to run away, but she can't bear to be seen
about, poor thing!) And your father was very polite
the last time he was here. He looked to me as if he
were bent on finding out something; but he was very
polite, all the same, and made himself quite agreeable.
Tell me about your brother,&mdash;the brother
that is to be the successor, according to what people
say. Oh! I forgot; you don't wish to talk of
that."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to talk of it. I believe you
are quite right, and that Stephen is to be my father's
heir."</p>

<p>"I have always heard it was a very nice property,"
she remarked. "My dear Mr. Mitford, I am sure
you must have played your cards very badly, when
your kind father cuts you off like that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," replied Edmund, with a half smile;
"or perhaps he thinks my brother better fitted to
keep up the character of a country gentleman, and he
may be quite right."</p>

<p>"You take it very coolly, anyhow," said Mrs.
Travers; "and you really think that Mr. Stephen&mdash;isn't
that his name? Oh, Captain, to be sure; I had
forgot&mdash;will keep it up best? Well, I never was
brought up with any superstition about an eldest son,

<!-- page 445 -->

myself. I know your younger brother least of any of
you. I hope he'll come and see us. I am devoted to
the army, and I like people of decided character.
Tell him I shall be glad to see him at Mount Travers.
Mr. Mitford, I am very much obliged to you. I don't
require to trouble you any more, now we have got up
to the level of the house." And she drew her arm
briskly out of his, and stood still for a moment, turning
round upon him as if to give him his dismissal.</p>

<p>Edmund felt with a sense of pleasure that, notwithstanding
all that had happened, his mind was as capable
of being amused as ever. He had been vague
enough up to this moment, not decided whether he
should go or not. But Mrs. Travers made up his
mind for him. "I hope," he said, "I may call,
though I am no longer of any use; for I have a message
for Miss Travers from the Rectory."</p>

<p>"Oh, from Pax, as Lizzy calls her; an absurd
name, and I think she's rather an absurd person. I
can't see what Lizzy finds in her,&mdash;very limited and
prejudiced, like all the clergy people, and very fond
of her own way. Oh, surely, Mr. Mitford, come in,
come in: you'll find Lizzy in the drawing-room
Good-by, in case I should not see you again."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was seated at the further end of the room,
at a writing-table, with her back turned towards the
door. She got up with a little stumble of excitement,
when she became aware of Edmund's presence. "You
must pardon me," he said, "for coming in unannounced.
I met Mrs. Travers at the foot of the bank, and came
back with her. She told me I should find you here."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elizabeth, holding out her hand. She
added, in a voice which was slightly tremulous, "I am
always at home at this hour."</p>

<!-- page 446 -->

<p>Did she wish him to be aware of that? Or was it a
mere impulse of shyness, and because she did not know
what to say?</p>

<p>They sat down near each other, in the great room
with the vast plate-glass window, which took away all
sense of being within doors, and made that wide landscape
part of the scene, and for perhaps a whole long
minute neither spoke. There was a screen arranged
round Mrs. Travers's little table and easy-chair, to
preserve her from some imaginary draught, or perhaps
to give a sense of shelter where all was so blank and
wide. Elizabeth looked at her visitor with something
like a sentiment of alarm in her wide-open eyes. The
two seemed at last to have met alone, in a vast centre of
naked space, where there could no longer be any veil
of mystery between them. Edmund was not so ready
as she was expectant. He had not come with any
definite idea in his mind as to what he was to do or say,
but only to see her, to speak to her, to follow any leading
that good or evil fortune might put in his way.</p>

<p>"I met Mr. Gavelkind, on his way to town."</p>

<p>"He has been here since Friday. He is a very warm
friend"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You could, I am sure, have nobody more devoted
to your interests."</p>

<p>"I meant of yours, Mr. Mitford. He has always a
great deal to say of you."</p>

<p>"Of me?" responded Edmund, with a smile.
"That's strange! I have got so wiped out of everything
that it is odd to hear of any one who thinks of
me."</p>

<p>"You are too kind," said Miss Travers; "you let
the thought of duty carry you too far. Duty must have
a limit. There is something that perhaps I ought to

<!-- page 447 -->

tell you; but when I see that you are deceived, or that
you think yourself bound to regard as sacred, to uphold
and to justify"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, bending forward towards her,
too much astonished to say more.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mitford, I don't know how to speak. It is not
a thing to be discussed between you and me. But when
I see how you are making an idol of one who&mdash;when
I perceive how you are devoting yourself to carry out
plans which&mdash;and letting your life and everything in
it go by"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Elizabeth's voice had begun to tremble, her eyes were
filling with tears, her color changed from red to white.
She kept clasping and unclasping her hands, in the
strain of some excitement, the cause of which he could
not discover. What was its cause, and how was he involved
in it? And what was this purpose which she
attributed to him, which made him let his own life go
by?</p>

<p>"My own life?" he said. "I seem to have none.
I am pushed aside from everything, but I wish I could
think you cared what became of my life. I should
like to tell you how it has been arrested for months
in the only great wish I have ever formed for myself.
Miss Travers, my brother Roger"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, clasping her hands with something
which looked like a wild and feverish impatience.
"Don't speak to me of Roger,&mdash;I don't want to know
any more of him! I would rather never hear his name
again!"</p>

<p>She got up as she spoke, starting from the chair as
though she could no longer tolerate the situation, and
stood for a moment in front of the great window, her
tall figure showing against the background of the vast

<!-- page 448 -->

landscape outside. She turned her back upon it, and
stood facing him, twisting her fingers together, in her
agitation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mitford," she said, clearing her throat, "I
know I ought to have told you&mdash;I ought to tell you"&mdash;&mdash;
The door opened while the words were on her lips.
Elizabeth made a movement of almost angry impatience.
"I had made up my mind to it, and now I
can't do it!" she cried, turning away hastily. Edmund
had risen, too, he could scarcely tell why. She had
turned round, and stood gazing out of the window, in
a tremor of suspense and agitation, disappointed and
excited. Mrs. Travers appeared at the door, relieved
of her out-door garments, with her little pale face surrounded
by the dead white of her widow's cap, and
everything about her breathing the tranquillity of the
common day. The extraordinary difference and contrast
startled Edmund. He did not know why Elizabeth
should be so excited; but he perceived the seriousness
of her agitation, and how much it must mean, when
he saw her spring up and go to the window, as Mrs.
Travers came softly in and took her usual place. A
third person, whom he did not remark, except that there
was a movement of some one following, came in with
the old lady; half visible for a moment then disappearing
behind the screen. He had an impression, of
which he took no heed amid the other images, more
urgent, that filled up all the foreground, that this third
person, the attendant, whoever she was, remained in the
room, though unseen.</p>

<p>"So you found Lizzy, Mr. Mitford?" said Mrs.
Travers. "I thought you would find her here. I did
intend to let you have her all to yourself, while I rested
a little. But to tell you the truth, we saw your father

<!-- page 449 -->

and your brother coming this way, and I put on my
cap and came down. I couldn't leave Lizzy to entertain
three gentlemen, all of the same family: that
would have been too much."</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned quickly from the window. "I see
them: they are just here," she said.</p>

<p>"And I wanted particularly to see the captain,&mdash;I
have always told you I liked military men," returned
her aunt; "but don't let Mr. Edmund Mitford go
away for that. He is not ashamed, I suppose, of being
found here."</p>

<p>Elizabeth came and sat down near him, not concealing
the tremulous condition in which she was; she gave
him a look of disappointment, mingled with an almost
feverish irritation and annoyance, and faintly shook
her head. She had something to tell him, and she had
been made to stop with the very words in her mouth.
Her eyes had a certain pleading in them that he should
not go away, and Edmund had no wish to go away.
He was glad to be here, to watch what his father and
brother intended, to find out their purpose. Whatever
aim they might have, it was well that there should
be some one to keep a watch on that.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XLII.</p>

<p class="small">A REVELATION.</p>

</div>

<p>"OH, you've got here before us, Ned," Stephen remarked
in an aside, in his amiable way. He drew a
chair near to that from which Elizabeth had risen on
the entry of the new-comers, and which she had resumed
nervously, still with that thrill of agitation.
She was thus seated between the brothers, Stephen
bending towards her, half turning his back upon the
window. "It is dazzling to come in here," he observed.
"The country doesn't look half so sunny and brilliant
outside. It must be something in this room."</p>

<p>He looked at her, as he spoke, with a laugh and
an admiring gaze which indicated his meaning almost
too distinctly. The time of broad compliment has
passed away, and Elizabeth was unacquainted with
that form of address. She gave him an astonished
look.</p>

<p>"Of course it is something in this room," said the
Squire. "Young fellows are not so ready as they were
in our day, Mrs. Travers. I think I could have put
it more neatly, in my time"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the plate-glass," suggested the old lady.
"As for the other sort of thing, my time's over, and
Lizzy's too serious. I don't know why the plate-glass
should have that effect. I always told Mr.
Travers that we wanted shade; but trees won't grow
in a day, and the plate-glass is like a mirror, that's
what it is."

<!-- page 451 -->

<p>"It's the light within," said Mr. Mitford, with an
old-fashioned bow that took in both the ladies. "My
son Stephen has scarcely been at home, to stay, since
he was a boy. But he turns up when I want him.
We need to hold together now."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," Mrs. Travers replied, with the gravity
that befitted the situation, "the fewer you get, the
more you ought to cling close; but it isn't all families
that do that."</p>

<p>"It wants a pretty strong inducement," said Stephen,
"to make a man bury himself in the country in
June. Don't you think so? Oh, I know it's the
height of summer, and all that; but on the other
hand, there's nothing for a man to do. Tennis, yes;
but tennis soon palls, don't you think so, Miss Travers?&mdash;with
the Miss Tredgolds and a curate or
two."</p>

<p>His own laugh was the only one that Stephen drew
out, which was uncomfortable. Elizabeth was too
completely preoccupied to be able to give him more
than the faintest smile. "I am no authority," she
said. "I never play."</p>

<p>"We must find something for him to do till September,
Miss Travers," remarked the Squire. "I
shall trust to you ladies to help me in that. In September
we all come to life, you know. And that
reminds me of our particular errand, Stephen. It
appears there is one of our keepers, Ford, whom you
ladies have taken a fancy to."</p>

<p>"Ford?" Elizabeth said, with a sudden interest.
"Yes, I know something of him." She gave a quick
look round, and seemed to hesitate for a moment
whether she should not get up and call some one, but
reconsidered the matter, and sat still.</p>

<!-- page 452 -->

<p>"My dear young lady," said the Squire, playfully
holding up and shaking a finger at her, "don't you
know&mdash;&mdash; But I am sure you don't, or you would
never have done it. Among us men, it's not quite
the thing&mdash;it's not considered quite the thing to interfere
with another man's servants. We are but savages,
more or less. I know our ways are not ladies'
ways."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," returned Elizabeth. "I
have never intended to interfere. I take an interest
in the man,&mdash;that is true. He came to tell me he
was turned out at a moment's notice,&mdash;threatened
with the police."</p>

<p>"That was all a bit of nonsense," observed the
Squire, bland and smiling. "There's the culprit,
looking ashamed of himself, as he ought, come to beg
your pardon, my dear young lady. Speak up, Steve.
You're on your trial, my boy, and before such a judge
it's worth while clearing yourself."</p>

<p>"I hope I'll meet with mercy," said Stephen. "It's
my ill-fate that though I know Miss Travers so well,
she knows me little, I fear, and possibly doesn't&mdash;trust
me." He was used to good fortune with women,
and he knew that among the class to which he
was accustomed a bold front was half the battle. He
looked at Elizabeth with an air which was half ingratiating,
half insolent. "I'm not, perhaps, good
for very much; but if I had known you took an interest
in the people, why, that would have made all
the difference. But I hadn't a notion&mdash;&mdash; You'd
better speak for me, sir. I haven't the ear of the
court."</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, we take a very strong interest
in the Fords," said Mrs. Travers, looking up from

<!-- page 453 -->

her work. "We think they've had a great deal to
bear from your family. I don't know all the details
myself, but Elizabeth does. Probably Mr. Mitford
himself doesn't know, Lizzy; and Captain Mitford,
who has been away for so long, and is really almost a
stranger in Melcombe"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is true," interrupted Elizabeth. "I ought to
have thought. I know only one side, and perhaps
you know only another. I have no right to be the
judge."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Travers, we are delighted, delighted
to have you for the judge. Where could we find one
so gentle, one so fair, in both senses of the word?
Speak up, can't you, Steve, and tell all your bad meaning.
Of course he had a bad meaning; not abstract
justice,&mdash;oh, no, that's seldom what we think of.
Speak up! A fellow like you should get the ladies to
take his part."</p>

<p>"I'm quite ready, for one," responded little Mrs.
Travers, laying her work down upon her lap. "I'm
always a friend to military men. Where should we
be without them? There would be no security for
anything, I always say."</p>

<p>"There's encouragement for you, Steve," remarked
his father, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"If there's to be a trial, the court had better be
cleared," said Edmund, getting up,&mdash;a movement
which made Stephen's face lighten with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That's true," he assented. "I had better have
as few listeners as possible, to take notes of my enormities."</p>

<p>Elizabeth put up an eager hand. "Don't go away,&mdash;don't
go away," she pleaded, almost in a whisper,

<!-- page 454 -->

with an anxious look and a return of that agitation
which was so inexplicable to Edmund, and with which
he alone seemed connected. The only answer he could
make was a bow of submission, but he withdrew from
the group, and going to the window, that universal resource
for persons who find themselves <i>de trop</i>, stood
looking out, seeing nothing, as such persons generally
do.</p>

<p>"I say, sir," exclaimed Stephen, "this isn't fair.
Here is Ned, a sort of counsel for the defendant. No,
not exactly that, for I am the defendant; but at all
events for the other side. Don't you know, Miss Travers,
that brothers are usually on different sides?"</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Mrs. Travers, "begin! This
is getting more and more interesting." She was delighted
with Stephen's air of assurance, with his banter,
though it was not very refined, and that look of a
conquering hero, which he rarely laid aside.</p>

<p>"Well, then, here goes. Miss Travers, you must
know our view of these Fords. They are people,
though I don't know details any more than Mrs.
Travers, who have been mixed up in&mdash;in most painful
events. I know that much, though I mayn't know
all. The governor, there, has heard a great deal too
much about them; that's the truth. I knew he'd be
glad to be rid of them. I knew also that he'd rather
never hear their name again. Don't you see? I
therefore thought I'd make bold to take it into my
own hands."</p>

<p>"I think you were very right. Mr. Mitford might
indeed have painful associations, and <i>he</i> could not be
to blame."</p>

<p>Edmund turned round in amazement to hear these
words from Elizabeth. To hear the question discussed

<!-- page 455 -->

here at all was in itself strange enough, but to
hear it with Stephen's gloss of pretended solicitude
for his father, approved by Elizabeth! The story
was dim, and full of mystery to himself. The chance
of hearing it cleared up or explained away, from Stephen's
side, was one which startled him out of all
pretense of calm spectatorship. He turned, with involuntary
excitement, to watch the speakers. As he
did so, Edmund's eye was attracted by a flicker of
movement behind the screen. There was a very narrow
interval between its edge and the wall,&mdash;so narrow
that a person standing behind might see without
being himself seen. There seemed to be preparations
for some one sitting there: a table with something
white on it, a chair pushed against the wall. These
details caught Edmund's eye instantaneously, as he
turned his head. But a second glance showed him
more. Some one stood, a slight dark figure, at this
coigne of vantage, leaning against the screen. Her
head was bowed, her face invisible. She had the air
of clinging so close as to obliterate herself in the
shadow and dark line of the piece of furniture. Perhaps
he would not have been sure at all but for the
lighter color of her hair; her very face was pressed
against the dark velvet of the screen. He was so
much startled that for the moment he scarcely heard
what Stephen was saying, though that had an interest
to him beyond anything which could be roused by a
visitor or servant at Mount Travers, thus clandestinely
listening to something which she had no business
to hear.</p>

<p>"Yes," Stephen said, "I own that I thought that
a kind of duty; but there it is that my bad meaning,
as my father calls it, comes in. To get rid of Ford

<!-- page 456 -->

was all right, a relief to the Squire without bothering
him; but the fact was, I had a man of my own."</p>

<p>"A man of your own! Go on, Mr. Stephen, go
on. It is always more and more exciting," cried Mrs.
Travers, sitting up erect in her chair, and clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>mea culpa</i>,&mdash;that is the height of my offense:
I wanted to put in my own man. It is a nice
little cottage, with a charming garden; and instead of
that troublesome fellow, Ford, with his bad antecedents,
I had planned to put in a nice young couple,
my own&mdash;&mdash; Hallo! What's this? Who's this?
What&mdash;what do you mean by it?" Stephen cried.</p>

<p>Something had flitted across his line of vision,&mdash;a
figure which Edmund alone had previously seen.
But even Edmund did not observe, so quick was her
motion, how it was that she detached herself from the
shadow, and suddenly became visible to the whole
group, standing in the full light of the great window.
Stephen acknowledged the wonder, the strangeness,
and the power of this apparition by springing suddenly
to his feet; his face, slightly flushed by his
story-telling, grew crimson in a moment; his eyes
seemed to project from his head.</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed the Squire, turning towards the
new actor on the scene. "Who is it? What's happened?
Why, it's Lily Ford!"</p>

<p>"She has heard her father reflected upon," said
Mrs. Travers. "Dear, dear, I forgot she was about!
Go away, my poor girl, go away; it was not meant
for you to hear."</p>

<p>"Miss Travers," said Lily, in a tremulous, hurried
voice, "I told you all my story, every word, the very
first day. I told it all, except who it was. I meant

<!-- page 457 -->

to hide that from you, for his very name was a shame
to say. Perhaps I've done harm by it; I'm afraid
I have. I'm mended of my folly now. To hear him
speak of Ford, that was troublesome, that had bad
antecedents, that Mr. Mitford could not bear the
name of&mdash;&mdash; Look at him, Miss Travers; do you want
me to say more? That's the man that beguiled me
up to London; that was to take me to a woman's
house, where I should be taken care of, and marry me
in the morning. I told you every word. He was to
have the license in his pocket, and it was to be at a
church in the city. There he is, there he stands!
That's Stephen Mitford, that was to be my husband,
but never meant it: that's the man that is turning
out my father and mother, and threatening the police
to them, because I escaped away from him out into
the streets! Rather the streets than him! Rather
anything in all the world than him!"</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" retorted Stephen, forgetting all his
precautions. "Hold your tongue! How dare you
speak? It's a lie!"</p>

<p>"Lily!" cried Elizabeth. "Oh, Lily! What are
you saying?" She had uttered a cry and started up
at the first words of this strange revelation; and without
looking at Edmund she put out her hand to him,
saying, "Edmund, forgive&mdash;forgive me!" as Lily
went on.</p>

<p>"He knows it's all true!" the girl cried, pointing
to Stephen. "He used to meet me in the park, and
he offered to marry me. He said Not church, church
was of no consequence,&mdash;a registrar's office; but I
said No, the church or nothing; and he was to get
the license for a church in the city, and all straightforward,
and to take me to a good woman's. But

<!-- page 458 -->

there was no woman, and he had said I was his wife.
Then I opened the door and ran out into the streets;
and I walked, and walked, and walked, till I was like
to drop, till the morning; and then I got to the railway,
where there was a woman, and slept all day; and
there you found me. I told you all the story, every
word, except his name. And there he stands,&mdash;Stephen
Mitford. Oh, I have good cause to know his
name!"</p>

<p>"The girl is mad!" Stephen cried. "It's a lie!
She means my brother. My brother would have married
her. He was a fool. It was Roger; it was
not I."</p>

<p>"What's all this about?" blustered the Squire.
He had sprung up, too, from his seat. "He's right,
Miss Travers. This girl, confound her!&mdash;my poor
boy wanted to marry her. She had&mdash;she had&mdash;got
over him, somehow. It's true, Roger wanted to
marry her. Stephen was never in it. Stephen is not
that sort!" Mr. Mitford laughed in a wild way, with
an indignant braggadocio, ready to boast of his son's
want of virtue. "He's not a&mdash;he's not one of the
innocent ones. He is up to most things!"</p>

<p>"Lily, my child,&mdash;Lily, come here," cried Mrs.
Travers. "Oh, dear, dear! To hear that about her
father has quite upset her. Lily, come here,&mdash;come
here."</p>

<p>Lily obeyed the call. She was very docile, though
trembling with passion; and in that stirring up of all
her being, she was glad of some one to cling to, some
one to lean upon. She obeyed the movement of the
old lady's hand, and went and stood behind her chair.
The others were all standing up, gazing at each
other. Elizabeth, in her compunction and astonishment,

<!-- page 459 -->

had put her hand suddenly into Edmund's, not
knowing what she did, calling him by his name; and
notwithstanding the wonderful commotion which this
involuntary act roused in him, he had said or done
nothing save hold that hand firmly in his, not attempting
to interrupt the strain of a stronger interest,
the question now raised between his father and
brother, between whom a whole tragedy lay. As if a
magnet had drawn them, they both followed Lily's
movements with their eyes; as if her change of position
could impart something new to the startling
tale.</p>

<p>"Speak up, man!" cried the Squire, growing gradually
excited. "Don't leave me to answer for you,&mdash;you've
a big enough voice when you please. Take
your oath to it! Are you going to let them believe
that&mdash;that lie?"</p>

<p>"That's what it is," answered Stephen. His voice
was big enough, but there was something hollow in
it. "It is a lie. I've said so. You see she can't
face me and say it again!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Lily, leaning over her friend's chair,
over the head of the little old lady, who looked like
some curious white-and-black bird with eager little
sparkling eyes, "I have but one word. I can't vary
it. Mr. Roger,&mdash;oh! he was too good; he spoke to
me as if I had been the highest lady in the land. But
Stephen made me leave my home; he said we were to
be married, and he would get a license; it was to be
in a church in the city." Lily went over those details
again with a monotony of repetition, as she had
gone over and over them in her mind in circles of
confused and miserable thinkings. "I trusted him,
and I went to him, but he never meant it. When I

<!-- page 460 -->

saw how it was&mdash;&mdash; Oh, ask him; he will tell you!"
she cried, suddenly turning upon her former lover.
"Ask him, look at him! Can't you see it in his
face?"</p>

<p>"You liar!" he cried, hoarse with passion; "you
jilt, you little devil! The streets,&mdash;that was where
she came from, where she belonged! Yes, I'll take
my oath! I tell you it's an infernal lie!"</p>

<p>"I walked about the streets all night. God protected
me," said Lily. "It was like the dead walking,
but I was safe there from him. I told Miss
Travers every word, but not who he was. I would
have spared him, if he had spared my father and
mother. For he did me no harm, only a night in the
streets; an awful night, on my feet, walking all the
time, but that's all. He did me no harm!"</p>

<p>Stephen looked as a bully looks when he is beaten
down and can brag no more. "I took her from the
streets,&mdash;that's what she means. I wouldn't go
after her there,&mdash;that's what has made her mad.
She's a liar,&mdash;she's a d&mdash;d"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford raised his stick, and made as if he
would have struck his son on the mouth. His own
forehead and cheeks were purple. He tried to speak,
and the foam flew from his mouth like spray. "You
hound!" he cried. "Do you know there are ladies
here? D&mdash; you, you make me forget it!" He struck
his stick upon the ground in his passion, and snapped
it as if it had been glass. "Enticed the girl like a
villain and lost her like a fool! I'm glad my stick's
broken, or I'd have struck him. Don't speak to me,&mdash;don't
speak to me. Get out of my way, sir. I'm
going home."</p>

<!-- page 461 -->

<p>They all stood staring, accused and accuser together,
while the father, stammering, maddened, pushing everything,
furniture and persons, wildly from him, turned
round, clearing the way with the broken end of his
stick, and rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>XLIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE CULPRIT'S REVENGE.</p>

</div>

<p>THEY were left,&mdash;as the exit of an important actor
in a stirring scene leaves the rest of the parties to
it, in an enforced pause before the movement can be
resumed, at watch upon each other, distracted for the
moment, each antagonist a little astray, not knowing
how the debate is to be resumed, and against which
of the adversaries he is to find himself engaged. To
Stephen it was a moment of relief. Among the others,
there seemed no one whom he could not cow by
his louder voice and stronger denial. It appeared to
him that he could crush that slight creature standing
opposite by the mere lifting of his hand. But for the
moment he did not know whether it were she or some
other against whom he would have to stand.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said Mrs. Travers, leaning back a
little upon Lily, who stood behind her. The old lady
was frightened, flurried, horror-stricken. "Oh dear,
dear!" she cried, wringing her little transparent
hands. "I knew there was something, but I never
knew how bad it was. Oh dear, dear!&mdash;oh dear,
dear!"</p>

<p>"Stephen," said Edmund, "I think we had better
follow my father. After what has passed, it can do
you no good to stay here."</p>

<p>"After what has passed! What has passed? The
story of a&mdash;of a&mdash;the sort of creature no man is safe

<!-- page 463 -->

from. It might have been you instead of me. Would
you slink off, and let her have it all her own way?
I'll appeal to Mrs. Travers. <i>You</i> know what the
world is: will you trust that woman against me,&mdash;a
girl that has nothing to lose against"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" interposed Elizabeth; "for Heaven's
sake, don't go any further,&mdash;there has been enough.
Oh, get your brother to go away! We do trust her,&mdash;we
know her better than we know him. Oh, get
him to go away!"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Travers, "oh dear,
dear! I can't bear this sort of thing, Elizabeth. He's
a gentleman, a military man. And don't you hear
him? He appeals to me. Lily may have been mistaken;
he may be able to explain. Oh dear, dear!
Mr. Mitford will have a fit, and it will kill me. To
have such a disturbance and such things talked of in
a lady's house,&mdash;oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>"Let me alone, Ned," cried Stephen; "it's my
character, not yours, that is at stake." He straightened
himself, and looked round him with rising courage.
"You say true," he continued; "Mrs. Travers,
<i>you</i> understand. How am I to explain before ladies?
Things look dreadful to ladies that are no harm
among men. If you will get Miss Travers to go
away, and that girl, I will tell you all I can. I'll explain
as well as I can&mdash;to you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To me!" interrupted the old lady, with a subdued
shriek,&mdash;"explain improprieties to me! Lizzy, he
oughtn't to be allowed to talk to me like this. Unless
she has made a mistake&mdash;&mdash; Oh, don't be too hasty,
my dear! Are you sure, are you quite sure, it's the
same gentleman? Oh, Lily, look again; you might
be mistaking him for some one else. Are you sure it

<!-- page 464 -->

is the same gentleman, Lily? If it was the right one,
do you think he'd appeal to me?"</p>

<p>"It is the man whom I was going to marry," returned
Lily, drooping her head. "How could I make
a mistake as to him?"</p>

<p>"That was my brother Roger," said Stephen, "as
is well known. Why she should wish to ruin me in
your opinion, I can't tell. She came up to London to
Roger. What happened to her there, who knows?"
he added, with an insulting laugh. "Perhaps it's
natural she should seek out some one to answer for
that adventure,&mdash;I shouldn't blame her. It's fair
enough to do what you can in self-defense."</p>

<p>"Let my brother Roger's name be left out of this,"
said Edmund, sternly. "Say what you will for yourself.
She never went to London to Roger. He was
as delicate and tender of her and her good name as if
she had been the Queen's daughter. Keep his name
out of it. I cannot allow any reference to him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers sat up erect in her chair, and looked
at Stephen with her small, keen eyes. "They are not
like each other," she said; "and how could she mistake
the man she was going to marry, as she says?
Captain Mitford, I think you had better go away? I
am very sorry, for I have a partiality for military
men, but I don't really see how there could be any
mistake. And you mustn't speak about the girl and
that sort of thing. We know her, as Elizabeth has
told you, a great deal better than we know you."</p>

<p>Stephen looked round upon the audience, which he
began to perceive was hostile to him, with lessening
self-command and growing wrath. His father's departure
had sobered him out of the first burst of passion,
but he was not a man to fight a losing battle.

<!-- page 465 -->

He went on, however, repeating his plea. "I can't
go into it now, before ladies. Name a man, and I'll
explain everything. I can't speak before ladies. A
man would soon see it was all a made-up story. Send
for old Gavelkind or somebody. I'll explain to a
man."</p>

<p>"You are not on your trial here, Captain Mitford,"
remarked Elizabeth. "We have nothing to do with
it. It has been all very unexpected and very painful."
She turned to Edmund with an appealing gesture,
"It would be much better if it could end here. There
is nothing more for us to do; it is no business of
ours."</p>

<p>"That is to say," cried Stephen quickly, "I am to
consent to a slur upon my character because there isn't
a man in the house to whom I can speak, nor any one
who can see through a made-up story. I shan't do
that! Send that little devil away, and not me. You
can't know her half so well as I know her. How
should you? She puts on one face to her backers-up,
but quite a different one to me. She's"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Mitford," Mrs. Travel's said, "you seem
to think, after all, that you know Lily very well."</p>

<p>He stopped short, confounded, and looked at the old
lady with a dangerous glitter in his eyes&mdash;like a bull
putting down its head before it charges.</p>

<p>"You think you know Lily very well," she repeated;
"and how should you know her, unless what
she says is true? I'm very sorry, for you are a near
neighbor, and I always thought I should like you best
of the family. If you please, Captain Mitford, will
you go away? I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but there's no man in the house, as you say. We
are only ladies; we have ourselves to take care of.

<!-- page 466 -->

Please go. And I don't think," added the old lady,
upon whose face there had come a little color, a flush
of roused temper and feeling, "that so long as this
is my house I shall want to see you here again."</p>

<p>He burst out suddenly into a loud laugh. He was
exasperated by her little air of authority, her precise
words, the majestic aspect she put on, and he was half
mad with the efforts he had made to restrain himself,
and the sense that he had failed, and the fury and
shame of the exposure. No one had listened to what
he said in his own defense; but he had it in his power
to startle them into listening to him at last. "Your
house?" he cried, hurling the words at her as if they
had been a stone picked up in haste. "You've no
house, any more than you have the right to judge
me!"</p>

<p>"No house! The man must be going mad!" Mrs.
Travers exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Captain Mitford," cried Elizabeth, "if you have
any sense of honor, go,&mdash;go away!"</p>

<p>"I'll not allow myself to be insulted," he returned,
"not even by an old woman. Her house! It's no
more hers than it's mine. She's got no house,&mdash;she
has not a penny but what you give her. Do you think
I don't know? Do you think that everybody doesn't
know? Let go, Ned. I'll not be put out, either by
her or you. By Jove! to order me out of her house,
when she's a pauper, a pensioner, a&mdash;&mdash; Good-evening,
Mrs. Travers. I hope I've given you a piece of information
which is as good as yours to me!"</p>

<p>The little old lady had risen to her feet. It was
not possible for the small, worn face in the white circle
of her widow's cap to be paler than it habitually
was; but her eyes were opened more widely than

<!-- page 467 -->

usual, and her lips were apart. "Lizzy!" she said,
with a gasp, putting out her hands. She paused
until Stephen had gone out of the room before she
said any more. Then she resumed: "Lizzy! Is that
true?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Travers," replied Edmund, "my brother is
entirely in the wrong. He has received a dreadful
blow. I am dazed and confused by it, though I have
nothing to do with it. He did not know what he was
saying. He wanted to revenge himself on some one.
It was a dastardly thing to do; but that is all. Don't
think of it more."</p>

<p>"I am asking Lizzy. Lizzy," said the old lady, "is
that true?"</p>

<p>"Aunt, listen to him, he knows everything, and
we've done him injustice!" cried Elizabeth, with an
effort, scarcely conscious, to turn the discussion into
another channel. "Ask him to forgive me. I thought
he was involved in all this dreadful story. I thought
it was all different."</p>

<p>"Lizzy," said Mrs. Travers, "is that true?"</p>

<p>"Aunt, how can you ask me? It is nothing; it is
revenge, as he tells you."</p>

<p>"What does it matter what he tells me, or the
other? The other meant what he said. Lizzy, is it
true?"</p>

<p>"Aunt, dear aunt!"</p>

<p>"You call me by my name, but that's no answer;
nor is it an answer," cried the old lady, holding Elizabeth
at arm's length, thrusting her away, "to come
and coax me and kiss me. Is it true&mdash;<i>true?</i>" She
grasped Elizabeth's shoulder after a moment, as a
child might grip a woman in vain passion, and shook
her. "I want an answer,&mdash;I want an answer. My

<!-- page 468 -->

husband thought it right to leave you everything&mdash;after
me: that's what I've been told, and I thought
it was hard. Was there more than that? I'll not be
deceived any longer!" she cried, stamping her foot.
"If I'm a pauper, a pensioner, as he said, tell me.
I'll not be deceived any more!"</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt! Never, never that! Oh, never that!"</p>

<p>"Never what? There may be degrees of lies, but
there can be but one truth. What? I will know!"</p>

<p>"Aunt," said Elizabeth, who had grown very pale,
"there is but one truth, but I might tell that truth so
that it would be almost a lie. If you will sit down,
and have patience, and let me explain"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Explain, when it's a simple matter of yes or no?
Mr. Edmund Mitford, this is between my niece and
me; but she seems to wish you to remain," Mrs. Travers
added, querulously. "And I suppose you know,
as he said everybody knows. Oh, that Mr. Gavelkind
should have gone, just when he was wanted!"
Mrs. Travers began to moan. She clasped her little
attenuated hands together; tears began to gather in
her eyes. "Lily Ford," she said, "I've been kind to
you, I've asked you no questions, you've been living
in my house&mdash;&mdash; In my house? I don't know if I have
a house. Oh, what am I to do&mdash;what am I to do?"
She sank back into her chair, and began to whimper
and cry. "I was his faithful wife for forty years. I
brought him a bit of money that was of great use to
him at the time. I was never extravagant,&mdash;never
wanted anything that he wasn't the first to get! The
plate-glass and all that,&mdash;was it my doing? I never
had any interest but his. And now he's left me without
a home, without a home, after being his wife for
forty years!"</p>

<!-- page 469 -->

<p>"Oh, dear aunt," cried Elizabeth, flinging herself
on her knees beside Mrs. Travers's chair, "he never
thought of that. You were like himself to him. It
was a mistake, it was some delirium, he never
thought."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "there's mistakes,&mdash;yes, there's
mistakes. You asked me, Lily Ford, if you could mistake
the man you were going to marry; and it seemed
both to me and you as if you couldn't. But I was
married to mine for forty years, and I was mistaken
in him all the time, it appears. I never thought he
would leave his wife a&mdash;a pauper, a pensioner, as
that villain said. Oh, that villain! Get up, Elizabeth,
get up; don't hang on me. I'll be your pensioner
no more."</p>

<p>Elizabeth, repulsed, still knelt at her aunt's feet,
her hands clasped, the tears streaming from her eyes.
Lily Ford, behind the old lady's chair, put her arms
timidly round her, caressing her, crying too. Beside
all these weeping women, what could Edmund do?
He stood irresolute in sheer masculine disability to
bear the sight of their tears: and yet he could not go
away, nor desert Elizabeth at this crisis. Not a word
had been said between them, and yet she had called
him, bound him to her side. He turned from them,
and walked about the room in the confusion of despair.</p>

<p>"That's what marriage is," Mrs. Travers resumed
after an interval of sobs. "I'll go out of my husband's
house with the little bit of money I brought
into it, and glad to have that. It was all mine for
forty years; but what was I all the time? What's a
wife but a pensioner, as that man said. She has no
right to anything; it's all in the man's hands, though

<!-- page 470 -->

she's helped him to make it, though she's taken care
of it and saved it, and done her work as honest as he.
But when he dies, he does what he likes; he takes her
home from her, and gives it to some one else. She's
got no right to anything. Oh, talk of mistakes, Lily
Ford! You might well mistake the man you were
going to marry, when I've mistaken mine, after I've
been his wife for forty years."</p>

<p>"Aunt," Elizabeth cried, "have some pity upon
me! You cannot have the heart to leave me! I
would have died rather than let you find out&mdash;anything
to wound you. Every word you say goes to my
heart. It's all true; but he never meant it so. He
never, never meant it. It's true, and yet it's not
true. And why should you punish me? What have
I done? Will you leave me alone in the world, in a
house that's no longer a home, because I have been
put in a wrong position, and because his mind got confused
at the end?"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," said Mrs. Travers angrily,
turning sharply upon her. "Don't say a word against
my husband to me. I know what I think; but it's
not for you to say it,&mdash;you that he was always so
good to. Respect your uncle, if you please. You
shall not say a word against him to me. And as for
leaving you, why, what's this young man here for,
Lizzy? He wants to go away, he has feeling enough
to see he has no business here; but you won't let him;
you keep him with your eye. I suppose you'll marry
him, and then you'll want nobody,&mdash;there will be no
further need for an old woman; though perhaps she is
wanted, enough to earn her living, enough not to be a
pauper," Mrs. Travers said, drying her eyes indignantly.</p>

<!-- page 471 -->

<p>"I must speak, if I am to be here at all," said Edmund,
coming forward; "let me be of some use now,
at least. You are all excited,&mdash;too much excited to
decide anything. If Elizabeth will have me, I have
been long at her disposal, Mrs. Travers; and in that
case I can speak for her as well as for myself. This
house will never, by my consent, be anybody's but
yours. She will never live in it, with my approval,
except as your daughter should live. It is better this
should be cleared up, perhaps, and that we should all
understand each other. You shall never leave here
with my consent. I can't but be of some importance,
if what you think is true. All the rest is little, and
means nothing. These are the facts of the case: you
are here at home, and Elizabeth lives with you.
What is to happen after shall be arranged between
us,&mdash;you, as the head of the house, having the first
voice. I know nothing about wills and law; in nature
you are the head of the house and the mistress of
the house, and so you shall always be for me."</p>

<p>When a man speaks words of wisdom, it is very
seldom that they are not received by the women about
him as oracles from Heaven. Elizabeth rose from her
knees, and came and stood by his side, putting her
arm into his with a timidity unusual to her. Mrs.
Travers sat up in her chair, with her face raised to
him, in attention, half bewildered but wholly respectful.
Even Lily Ford, behind the old lady's chair,
looked up as if her Salvation depended upon this
supreme and serious statement. When he stopped,
there was a breathless pause.</p>

<p>"Well, if it's any satisfaction to you, Lizzy, I
think he speaks up like a man," Mrs. Travers said.</p>

<!-- page 472 -->

<div class="center" id="XLIV">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XLIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE SQUIRE GOES HOME.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Squire went out of the house like a man distracted,
his brain on fire, a surging as of a flood in his
head. He passed out into the hot sun, with his hat
in his hand, feeling the rush in his ears too hot and
terrible to permit of any covering upon the temples,
which throbbed as if they would burst. Very few
times in his life had it happened to him that the fiery
commotion within dazed and confused him as to what
was going on without, but so it was to-day.</p>

<p>He had been without any premonition of trouble,
when he climbed that slope with Stephen. He was
going to smooth over all offense on Elizabeth's part.
Stephen was to tell his tale, to explain, as he seemed
convinced he could. "Let me alone. I hope I know
how to talk over a woman," he had said. Mr. Mitford
had been such a fool as to trust to him. Such a
fool! he said to himself now. As if Elizabeth had
been an ordinary woman, as if the circumstances had
been so simple! The Squire could not imagine how
he had been such a fool, forgetting that he had known
none of the circumstances. Now it seemed as if his
own folly were the thing most apparent. How could
he think that it would be so easily disposed of! How
could he imagine that all would be well!</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford was not a severe judge. He had, perhaps,
in his heart more sympathy with Stephen's errors

<!-- page 473 -->

than with the virtue of his other sons. He was
not a man to make any fuss about a little irregularity,
about what had been called youthful folly in the days
when he was himself subject to such temptations; so
long as there was nothing disgraceful in it, he had
said. But a girl upon his property, the daughter of
an old servant, his wife's favorite,&mdash;nay, good heavens!
the girl whom Roger had meant to marry!
Was there ever such a hideous combination? To entice
that girl away on the old pretense of marriage,
what a scoundrel! and to let her slip through his fingers,
what a fool! Everything that was most unbearable
was involved in it. It would be over the whole
county to-morrow, flying on the wings of the wind,&mdash;a
scandal such as had not happened for a generation,
and ridicule worse still than the scandal. It was like
a Surrey melodrama, the Squire said to himself,
crossed with a screaming farce. To have meant to
outwit the girl, and to have found her too sharp for
him! A Lovelace <i>plant&eacute;-la!</i> a brilliant and conquering
hero, made a fool of, like the old nincompoop in
the plays. Jove! and this was his son! And the
scandal and the derision, the county talk, the shaking
of the wise heads, the roar of ridicule, would peal
round the house, like a storm. The laughter, that was
the worst. Had Lily been altogether lost, Mr. Mitford
would have been perhaps not much less disturbed:
he would have felt keenly the shame of such a scandal,
the noisy echoes awakened, the shock of that overthrow
of all the decorums and betrayal of all those trusts
which an old servant puts in his master, and which
public feeling protects and authorizes. But that the
laugh should be added to the shame; that when people
heard what villainy Stephen had been about, they

<!-- page 474 -->

should also hear how the tables had been turned upon
him, how the biter had been bit and the deceiver deceived,&mdash;that
was more unbearable still! The echoes
seemed all to catch it up, to breathe it about him, to
come back laden with derision and scorn. Stephen,
who had been admired in the county, who had a reputation
as a dashing fellow, of whom his father had been
proud! Proud! Jove! there was not much to be
proud of: a base, abominable seduction, and not even
a successful one, the laugh turned against him, the
victim holding him up to shame. If everything had
been put together that could most humiliate and expose
the family,&mdash;just on the edge of a family affliction,
too, when decorum ought to have the strongest
hold,&mdash;it could not have been more thoroughly done!</p>

<p>It was a very hot day, the very height and crown
of summer, and the road between Mount Travers and
Melcombe was for a great part of the way quite unshaded,
exposed to the full beating of the afternoon
sun. It was afternoon, but the sun was still high in
the heavens, and the air was penetrated by the fierceness
of its shining. Three o'clock is almost more than
the climax of day; it has the meridian heat, with an
accumulation of all the fiery elements stored up in
every corner and in the motionless air, which has not
yet been freed from the spell of noon. After a while,
Mr. Mitford put on his hat mechanically, to interpose
something between him and that glow of heat and
brightness. The waves of the flood of passion, of
coursing blood and heat, rose one after another, ringing
and surging in his ears. He knew what his doctor
had told him about that overwhelming sensation,&mdash;that
he ought to get into the cool, into a darkened
room, and lie down and keep quiet, when he felt it.

<!-- page 475 -->

None of these things could he do now. This rushing
along in the full sun, with his head uncovered for part
of the way, no shade, no possibility of rest, and some
miles of blazing road before him, was enough to have
given Dr. Robson a fit, not to speak of the patient,
whom he had warned so seriously. The Squire felt
this dully in his confused brain, but also felt that he
could not help it; that everything was intolerable;
that he must get home, and do something at once.
He must do it at once; there was no time to lose. A
fellow who had exposed himself to the county, to the
whole world, like that, could not be permitted to be
the representative of the Mitfords. He had always
felt uncomfortable about it, always since poor Roger
was taken away. Poor Roger! It seemed to the
Squire that only death had taken his eldest son away,
and that it was somehow a grievance to himself that
Stephen had been put in that eldest son's place; he
could not make out, in his confusion, how it had come
about. It was a wrong to Edmund,&mdash;he had always
said so,&mdash;a great injustice, an injury, a&mdash;&mdash; And now
the fellow had proved how impossible it was to keep
up such an arrangement. It was all his own doing,
as somehow the other, the injury to Edmund, appeared
to be Stephen's doing. But the Squire felt that if he
could only get home in time, only reach his writing-table
and his quiet library and the cool and the shade,
and get his pulses to stop beating, and that rushing
surge out of his ears, things might still be put right.</p>

<p>But the road stretched out white before him, like
something elastic, drawing out and out in endless
lengths, such as he had never been conscious of before;
and the sun blazed, without a tree to subdue that
pitiless glare. He had a vague notion that there was

<!-- page 476 -->

some way with a handkerchief to stop the beating of
the light upon his head, but his thoughts were not free
enough to arrange it, or think how it could be done.
And still, the further the Squire walked, the further
and further before him seemed to stretch on these
lengths of expanding road. If he could but get home!
Presently the name of Pouncefort surged up into his
head on these rising waves. Pouncefort!&mdash;he must
send for Pouncefort: by an express, a man on horseback,
in the old way, or by the telegraph,&mdash;there was
the telegraph. Vaguely it came into his mind that he
might stop at the station which he had to pass, and
send a message; but that would keep him longer,
would prevent his getting home. To get home was
his first necessity,&mdash;into the cool, into the dark with
the shutters shut. The idea of shutting the shutters
came with a sense of relief to his brain. Somebody
could go to the office and send the message; or a man
could go, on horseback, the old way.</p>

<p>The laughing-stock of the county! It seemed to
him now, somehow, as if it were he who would be
laughed at, he who had been outwitted, though without
any fault of his. The laugh would be turned
against him all over the place, who had meant to play
the gay Lothario, and had been made a fool of by a
little chit of a girl! Something of the mortification
and rage with which Stephen himself thought of that
failure entered strangely into his father's brain, but
with a confused sense that he had been got into that
position without any fault of his; that it was the trick
of an enemy; that he had been made to appear ridiculous
in the eyes of all men, by something with which
his own action had nothing to do. He seemed to hear
the ring of that derision all about him. Ha, ha, ha!

<!-- page 477 -->

did you hear that story about Mitford? about the Mitfords?
about old Mitford? That was what it came to
at the last. Old Mitford! though he was a man that
had never made a laughing-stock of himself, always
kept clear of that; had been respected, feared, if you
like; an ugly sort of fellow to be affronted or put
upon, but laughed at, never! And now this was his
fate, for the first time in his life, and by no fault of
his.</p>

<p>How good it would be to have the shutters closed,
all along the side of the house! What a change it
would make all at once!&mdash;out of that beating and
blazing, the pitiless heat, the sound of the laughter;
for somehow the laughter appeared to come in, too.
Meanwhile, the road did nothing but grow longer and
longer, stretching out like a long white line, endless
as far as one could see, not diminishing, extending as
one rushed on; until at last, when the heat was at its
highest, the sunshine almost blinding, the surging in
his ears worse than ever, Mr. Mitford suddenly found
a coolness and shelter about him, and saw that he was
stumbling in at his own door.</p>

<p>"Shut all the shutters," he said to the first servant
he saw.</p>

<p>"The shutters, sir?"</p>

<p>"Every shutter in the house. Don't you see how
the sun is blazing? And I want something to drink,
and a horse saddled at once."</p>

<p>"A horse, sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't I speak plain enough? Send Larkins,&mdash;he'll
understand; but shut the shutters, every shutter;
keep out the sun, or we'll go on fire," Mr. Mitford
said.</p>

<p>Larkins was sought out in the housekeeper's room,

<!-- page 478 -->

with a message that master had come in, off his head,
as mad as mad, calling for the shutters to be shut,
and for a horse. The butler had been dozing pleasantly,
and was just waking up to enjoy his afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>"Rubbish," he said. "I dare say as he's hot with
his walk, and wants a drink; they allays does, when a
man's comfortable."</p>

<p>But Mr. Larkins was not an ill-natured man, and
he had a sympathy for people who wanted a drink.
He sent for ice and various bottles, and there was a
popping of corks which occupied some time; and
finally he took in himself to the library a tray, which
the footman carried to the door. He found, what
alarmed even his composure, his master tugging at
the shutters to close them, though the sun had passed
away from that side of the house.</p>

<p>"Bless me, sir, let me do that! But the sun's
gone," he said, hurrying to set down his tray.</p>

<p>The Squire was purple. He fumbled about the
shutters as if he did not see, his eyes seemed starting
out of his head, and he was panting, with loud, noisy
breath. "Every shutter," he said, "or we'll go on
fire; and, Larkins, have a horse saddled, and send a
groom"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but please leave all that to me, and take
a seat, sir; you're rather knocked up with the heat,
and I've brought some of that Cup."</p>

<p>Larkins, alarmed, had to guide his master to his big
chair, and while he brought him a large glass of that
skillful decoction, with the ice jumbling delightfully
and making a pleasant noise, he resolved within himself
that the groom should go for Dr. Robson, and that
without a moment's delay.</p>

<!-- page 479 -->

<p>"For Pouncefort, for Pouncefort," said the Squire;
"a man on horse, the quickest way."</p>

<p>"If I were to send a telegram?" said Larkins,
more and more decided that the doctor should be the
groom's errand.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Mr. Mitford. and he took a deep
and long draught; then repeated, "The shutters, the
shutters,&mdash;shut the shutters!" Larkins moved away
to humor his master. But his back was scarcely
turned when there was a great noise, amid which the
sharp sound of the glass breaking caught the butler's
ear, a rumbling as when a tower falls, all the courses
of the masonry coming down upon each other; and
there lay the squire, all huddled on the floor, with his
purple face fallen back, and his breathing like the
sound of a swollen stream.</p>

<p>Stephen left Mount Travers as hastily, and not
much more pleasantly, than his father. The thing
had come upon him which, with horrible premonitions
of shame and discomfiture, he had feared, ever since
that night when his victim, at the moment of his
triumph, had slipped out of his hands. The sensation
had been almost worse than he had imagined it would
be. The sight of Lily had filled him with a rage
which he felt to be cowardly, and which he would have
resisted had he known how to do so; a desire to strangle
her, to crush her, to stop that explanation by any
means, however brutal. And Elizabeth's look of horror,
and even the little white face of Mrs. Travers,
avowing with a sigh her partiality for military men,
had been terrible to him. But after the shock and
sting of that crisis, there came to Stephen a sense of
relief. The story would have flown to all the winds,

<!-- page 480 -->

if but one of the fellows in the regiment had been
there, or any man who could communicate to them
this too delightful tale. But the ladies would not
spread it abroad,&mdash;they were too much horrified; and
the Squire and Edmund would be silent. They would
know, and would not forget the story of his disgrace,
and that was bad enough; but they would not tell it,
for their own sake, if not for his. Nor would <i>she</i> repeat
it, for her own sake. It was more safe than he
could have hoped; the horrible moment of the disclosure
had come, but it was over, and nothing was so bad
as he had feared. True, Elizabeth's money was not
for him; the tramp to whom he threw a sixpence was
as likely now to be received as a wooer as he was; but
what then? There were as good fish in the sea as
had ever been drawn out of it. For his part, he had
no taste for such women; he could very easily make
up his mind to the loss of Elizabeth: a prim woman,
with that sanctimonious horror in her eyes, she was no
loss at all. They were as safe an audience as he could
have chosen, had he had the choosing of them. Not
one of them would repeat it; and that, not for Stephen's
sake, but for their own. And to console him
further, he had the comfort of having revenged himself,
which was sweet. He had thrown a firebrand
among them, for them to extinguish as best they
could. On the whole, he said to himself, with fierce
exultation, it was he who had come out of it best.</p>

<p>Therefore his excitement calmed down more easily
than his father's. There remained the question as to
what the Squire would do, which was a serious one.
He had been furious; he had taken it as Stephen himself
did, with rage and a sense of the mortification,
the failure, the horrible ridicule to which he would be

<!-- page 481 -->

exposed. But Stephen hoped that he might make his
father see what he so clearly saw himself; this shameful
secret had been revealed to the most harmless audience
that could have been chosen; that from Mount
Travers it was very unlikely to spread or be repeated,
or even whispered about; that the ladies would not
do it, nor Edmund; and that the little devil herself,&mdash;the
little&mdash;&mdash; He set his teeth when he thought of
her. He would like to meet her once more, only once
more, in the park, and see what she would say then.</p>

<p>He went home more quickly than his father had
done, thinking nothing of the length of the way, nor
of the heat, nor of the want of shade. He must see
what temper his father was in; and if it were very
bad, he would pack up and be off. Happily, he had
not sent in his papers; and if the worst came to the
worst, there would be this compensation in losing his
heirship,&mdash;that he should no longer be compelled to
remain at home. There was always that to be said
on the other side. He met a groom on horseback,
tearing down the avenue, but paid no particular attention;
nor was he roused by the scared face of Larkins,
who met him at the door. He thought, indeed,
that Larkins had been sent to warn him that the
Squire would not see him; but this alarm lasted
only for a moment. The butler looked very pale and
frightened. He came forward anxiously as soon as
Stephen appeared.</p>

<p>"I'm very thankful as you've come, sir. I didn't
know how to act on my own responsibility. Master's
not at all well."</p>

<p>"Not well? What is the matter?" Stephen said.</p>

<p>"He came in what I might make bold to call very
queer, sir, calling out to shut the shutters, to keep the

<!-- page 482 -->

sun out. Now the sun's gone from the library, captain,
an hour ago, as you know. John Thomas was
clean scared, and came and told me as master was off
his head. I says, 'Rubbish!' and I carries him in
some of his own particular Cup as he's fond of. He
was an awful color, sir,&mdash;purple-like, and breathing
hard. He told me to shut the shutters and then
to send a man on horseback for Mr. Pouncefort. I
turned my back for a moment, and there he was,
smash down upon the floor."</p>

<p>"A fit! Did you send for the doctor? Have you
got the doctor?"</p>

<p>"I didn't lose a moment, captain. I sent off the
groom at once. We laid him on the sofa, and Mrs.
Simmons is with him. He looks awful bad. That's
his breathing, sir, as you can hear."</p>

<p>Stephen held fast by a chair to steady himself.
"This is what Robson feared," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, doctor always said as his was a risky
life; and master's feared it, too. Getting in a passion's
bad for him, sir, and so is the great heat and
being out in the sun. Mrs. Simmons has got ice to
his head, and we're doing all we know till the doctor
comes. Had master been badly put out, sir, by anything
as happened? You will perhaps know?"</p>

<p>Stephen made no reply. He stood and listened to
the loud breathing, with which the very house seemed
to vibrate. "Did you send for Mr. Pouncefort, as my
father directed?"</p>

<p>"We've had no time to think of that. I thought
the doctor was the first thing."</p>

<p>"You were quite right, Larkins; it was better not
to worry him, in that state."</p>

<p>"Shall I telegraph now, sir, to Mr. Pouncefort? I

<!-- page 483 -->

thought I'd wait till one of you gentlemen came
home."</p><p>

Stephen again stood silent for a long minute, paying
no attention. At length, "I don't think you need
trouble yourself further," he said.</p>

<p class="small">AFTER THE STORM.</p>

</div>

<p>TUMULT and trouble seemed to have died out of
the house on the hill; the vacant room alone showed
a few traces of the passion and conflict that had been
there. The screen had been pushed aside, showing
the little table and chair behind it, which Lily had
used all the time she had been at Mount Travers,
in her nervous dread of being seen by any visitors;
and Mrs. Travers's chair with its cushions, her footstool,
and the pretty stand with her little requirements,
stood all astray, as they had been thrust to one side
and another, in the sudden commotion which Stephen,
before his exit, had flung into the enemy's country.
There Elizabeth had knelt, distracted, imploring her
aunt not to believe what was nevertheless true; and
there the little lady had stood, thrusting them all away,
repulsing her footstool, as though that, too, had been
an enemy, in the heat of her indignation. The inanimate
things showed these traces of human emotion in
a way which was curiously telling, with a suggestiveness
partly comic, partly pathetic. The footstool had
been turned over with the vehemence of the foot which
on ordinary occasions rested on it so peacefully. The
chair in which Stephen had first seated himself kept
its place,&mdash;turned with an ingratiating expression towards
that of Elizabeth, which had been pushed back
a little,&mdash;with its chintz cover all dragged out of

<!-- page 485 -->

place by the man's impetuous movements. But all
was perfectly silent here, as on other fields of battle;
and in a few minutes the butler, coming in with his
tea-tray, had it all put straight again. Nothing could
exceed the surprise of that respectable functionary:
no bell had been rung, no one had been called to open
the door; and yet the gentlemen whom he had admitted
had all melted away, leaving no trace, and even
the ladies had forgotten that it was time for tea.</p>

<p>Lily Ford came into the room while he was in the
act of calling upon some of his subordinates to rearrange
this place of conflict. Lily had become Miss
Ford,&mdash;she was a visitor, and had no dealings, except
in that capacity, with the servants; but they all knew
who she was, and had a certain reluctance in serving
her. It is all very well to talk of rising in the world,
and bettering yourself; but to wait upon one of his
own class who has succeeded in doing this is more
than any free-born servant can be expected to do.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly take up tea to Mrs. Travers's
room? She is not coming down," Lily said.</p>

<p>She had been crying; her lips had still a faint
quiver in them, and something like the echo of a sob
came into her voice as she spoke. Though it had been
her mother's delight to think that she was quite a lady,
Lily, in fact, had rather the air of a very pretty, very
refined lady's-maid. That is not saying much, for it
is sometimes difficult enough to tell which is which,
especially when the inferior in position is the prettier
by nature, as sometimes happens. It is only, perhaps,
a certain want of freedom, a greater self-restraint,&mdash;such
as is not unlikely to add to the air of refinement,&mdash;which
marks the difference. Lily was very quiet,
very reticent and subdued, and those signs of emotion

<!-- page 486 -->

seemed to betray to the man's eyes tokens of "a smash-up."
That his two mistresses should have quarreled
did not, with his knowledge of them, appear very
probable; but that Miss Ford&mdash;Miss, indeed!&mdash;should
have found her level and got the "sack," according
to the phraseology of the servants' hall, was
the most natural, not to say pleasing, thing in the
world.</p>

<p>"Tea for one, miss?" the butler said, with a look
that gave meaning to the words.</p>

<p>Lily replied only with a wondering glance, but she
said in a low voice, "You may put away the screen, if
you please."</p>

<p>It was very evident then to the household, through
which the news flashed in a moment, that there was
an end of Miss Ford; that she had got the sack, and
would trouble them with her obnoxious superiority no
more.</p>

<p>What went on, however, in Mrs. Travers's room
during the remainder of the afternoon was little like
this. There the old lady sat, propped up with more
cushions than usual, in a state of tearful dignity and
exaltation. She had felt the blow profoundly,&mdash;as
much as nature would allow her to feel. But there is
this advantage in a very small body, possessed by a
not very great mind: that its physical capabilities are
limited, and that the greatest anguish wears itself out
proportionately soon. Mrs. Travers had been deeply
wounded; she had been very indignant, very angry,
and then had recurred to the first pang, and felt the
slight and the cruelty of her husband's injustice to the
bottom of her little but affectionate heart. But when
she had gone through that round of feeling twice or
thrice she was exhausted, and for the time could feel

<!-- page 487 -->

no more. Everything that Elizabeth, in a compunction
which was very deep though quite uncalled for, since
she had no part in the offense, and in her anxiety to
sooth, and in her real gratitude and affection, could do
had been lavished upon her aunt; while Lily, all overwhelmed
still by the event in which she had taken so
great a share, and unable to restrain her sobbing, had
lingered round the other sufferer with that fellowship
which trouble has with trouble and pain with pain.
Mrs. Travers comforted by every outward appliance,&mdash;by
cushions applied skillfully at the very angles of
her back which wanted support, and tender bathings
of her hot eyes and forehead, and gentle ministrations
with a fan, and arrangements of blinds and curtains to
temper the light,&mdash;sank at last into a condition of not
disagreeable weakness, with all the superiority in it of
undeserved affliction.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a little better now. I believe that you
mean well, Lizzy. I am sure you would never be unkind
to me, my dear. Perhaps, as you say, it was all
a muddle, just a muddle at the end. And Edmund
Mitford spoke up very fair. Oh, I don't say it's your
fault, or his fault. But I shouldn't wonder if I'd be
better with Lily, for a bit; leave me with Lily, for a
bit. We've both been badly used; and she's very
feeling; and you can't be expected to feel just the
same when it's all to your advantage. Oh, I didn't
mean to say anything unkind. Leave me for a bit
with Lily, till I come to myself."</p>

<p>This was what she had said, sending Elizabeth
away; and then Mrs. Travers lay back in her chair,
with that sense of being a martyr which is never without
a faint touch of pleasure in it. She had been overwhelmed
by sudden trouble, which nobody could say

<!-- page 488 -->

she had deserved,&mdash;she had deserved nothing but
good, and evil was what had come upon her. But now
the sensation of quiet after a storm, of rest after suffering,
was softly diffused through the atmosphere:
the storm had passed over the gentle victim,&mdash;that
storm which she had done nothing to bring down; her
wrongs had subsided into that quiescent condition in
which, while ceasing to hurt, they continued to give
her a claim upon the respect and sympathy of all near.
She said in a half-audible voice, "Let them bring the
tea here, Lily;" and after her docile companion had
accomplished that commission, she called her close to
her chair. "Sit down by me, my poor dear, and tell
me everything," she said.</p>

<p>When Saunders, the butler, brought in the tea
(which after all he had not ventured to bring in for
only one), it is to be hoped it was a lesson to him to
see Miss Ford seated on a stool close to Mrs. Travers's
side, while the old lady held her hand, and patted it
from time to time, saying, "My poor dear, my poor
dear!" Saunders said, in the servants' hall, that they
were crying together, and as thick as they could be;
and that he shook in his shoes for fear Mrs. Travers
should say something about the tea for one; but she
might be keeping it up for him, for another time.
They stopped talking while he was there, so he
couldn't tell what the fuss was about; but they were
as thick as thick,&mdash;that he could swear. He withdrew
very quietly, treading as lightly as a man of fourteen
stone could do, not to call Miss Ford's attention
to him, and never was more thankful than when he
found himself safe outside the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers heard all Lily's story, every word,
with the keenest interest. To have a romance in real

<!-- page 489 -->

life thus unfolded to her from the heroine's own lips,
more exciting than any novel, would have been an enchantment
to her at any time; and now afforded such
a diversion from her own trouble as nothing else could
have supplied, especially as her curiosity had been
roused by partial revelations before. She would not
miss a detail of the terrible night in the street, nor
of how the poor girl felt when she found herself lying
on a sofa in the railway waiting-room, with Miss Travers
bending over her, and the kind woman who was
the attendant there standing by her side with a cup of
tea. Miss Travers had been her salvation, Lily said
with tears; she had telegraphed at once to the mother,
making it all appear quite natural, so that even her
own people knew nothing, except that Miss Travers
had taken her to town and was making a companion of
her. They were not to say where she was, at first, on
account of poor Mr. Roger, for whose sake the Fords
had supposed their daughter had run away. All this
had seemed most plausible to her father and mother:
and thus Lily's terrible adventure had turned out the
most fortunate incident in her life. Mrs. Travers asked
and was told much more than this, especially about
the state of Lily's heart, and how she now believed
that she had never loved Stephen at all, but had only
been flattered and excited by his attentions; for the
sight of him, Lily declared, had not called her heart
back to him at all, but made her feel that she wished
never to see him again, and that if there was not
another man in the world! This she protested with
many tears.</p>

<p>"And all the time Lizzy thought it was poor
Roger, and begged me to say nothing, for he was
dead; and yet couldn't quite forgive poor Edmund,

<!-- page 490 -->

thinking he knew; and was angry, something about
money that Roger had left, thinking they wanted to
make it up to you with money. It has been hard for
you, my poor dear," Mrs. Travers said; "but it is a
good thing for Lizzy that all this has come out. It
shows what a man he is, that in his revenge he should
have taken it out on me. Lily, my child, give me a
cup of tea. I want it very much, and so must you,
my dear; there is nothing that revives one so, when
one is exhausted with crying and trouble, and when
one's nerves are shattered. Lily, there is one thing
this discovery has done,&mdash;it has set me quite free.
I always thought, whatever happened, I was bound to
Lizzy, and to my own house, and all that. But now
that I find out I have got no house, and Lizzy will be
getting married, how should you like to go away traveling,
to Switzerland, and all kinds of beautiful places,
Lily Ford?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Travers!" cried Lily, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>"You needn't say any more, my dear; it has
brought back the light into your face in a moment.
We'll go away and travel, you and I. I have thought
of it a long time, but I have never said anything about
it. In the first place, Lizzy never cared for going
abroad; and then, though I'm very fond of Lizzy,
she is a kind of tall character, you know, that does
not always do to go about with a small body like me.
I have always been on the lookout for a nice quiet
girl that I could be fond of, that wouldn't be too serious
or distracted, with other things to think of.
Lily, since the first day you came here, I have always
felt I could get on with you." Mrs. Travers raised
herself a little upon her cushions, as she sipped her
tea, and a faint animation came into her face. "I

<!-- page 491 -->

never could have done with a companion that had
been got by an advertisement, or recommended by
a clergyman, or anything of that sort. But getting
fond of you before one ever thought of anything of
the sort,&mdash;it is just a Providence, Lily! And your
father and mother,&mdash;Lizzy has quite settled about
them, so they can have no objections. We'll go
abroad, you and I: we'll be quite comfortable, and
take Martha, and perhaps a man too, if you think
that would be a comfort,&mdash;for I have a little money
of my own, enough for all we shall want. We'll
make no plans, but just go wherever it will be nicest,
wherever we like best: we'll be quite free and independent,
for we'll be company for each other, which
is what I have always wanted. Don't you think it
will be very nice, Lily? It's what I've always
wanted, but never have seen my way to, till now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Travers, it is like a dream,&mdash;it is like
nothing but a dream!" Lily cried.</p>

<p>And these two innocent creatures dried their tears,
and began to talk of traveling-dresses and the most
beautiful places they had ever heard or read about.
All the world was "abroad," to them; it meant everything,
from Boulogne to Bombay, the first seeming
about as far off as the last; and in the novelty and
delight of this thought, their troubles floated away.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had left her aunt's room with a beating
heart. To reckon up all that had passed in this
eventful afternoon was impossible; the one thing important
was the question whether she should find Edmund
waiting for her down-stairs. The current of
these hasty events had swept the two together in a
way she had never intended, nor thought of. She
had put out her hand to him in her first astonishment

<!-- page 492 -->

in the shock of Lily's revelation, and in the force and
impetuosity of her feelings had called him by his
name. Up to that moment, Elizabeth had sorrowfully
believed that it was Roger who was the pitiful
hero of Lily's adventure. The girl had not said it;
had not, as Miss Travers now perceived, given any
indication that it was he; but Elizabeth had convinced
herself of it by reasonings which it is unnecessary to
follow, by one piece of circumstantial evidence after
another. In all that Roger had done Edmund had
involved himself. In her own hearing, he had spoken
of money which Roger had destined for Lily, and
which Elizabeth took for granted was given as compensation
for the wrong he had intended to do. Her
heart had been hot and sore with the secret which
nobody knew. She could not bear to stand by and
witness the love and the grief and the honor with
which Roger's name was surrounded,&mdash;Roger, who
she believed had stained that name with such schemes
and artifices at the very end of his life! It had been
intolerable to her to hear the universal praises that
followed him, to feel herself compelled to acquiesce in
what was said. She had stood silent, in painful repression,
unwilling to consent, still more unwilling to
condemn him who had gone before a higher tribunal.
She had determined at last, that very day, to tell Edmund
her secret,&mdash;that it was she who had recovered
Lily and brought her home, and that she knew
everything. When the discovery came, and she was
made aware that she had been wronging Roger all the
time, Elizabeth's generous heart had turned, with a
bound of repentance and acknowledgment, to Roger's
faithful brother, whom she had been holding at arm's
length, knowing well&mdash;as how could she help knowing?&mdash;what

<!-- page 493 -->

was on his lips. Her subdued scream of
horror and compunction, her call to Edmund to forgive
her, her hand put into his, had all been signs
which she had no power to restrain. She had done
this involuntarily, throwing herself at Edmund's head,
as the vulgar say. And afterwards it had all seemed
to be taken for granted by him and every one, she
could not tell how. He had spoken for her, and she
had accepted his guidance with proud humility, standing
up by him, putting her hand on his arm. It all
appeared to have been settled for them without a word
said between them, without anything which usually
constitutes such a bond. He had not said that he
loved her, nor that he wanted her; there had been no
asking, no consent. If there had been any advance
made, it had come from her, with that unconscious
cry of "Edmund!" with the giving of her hand.
When she left her aunt's room, Elizabeth, for the first
time able to think of herself, went down the stairs
very slowly, in great agitation, not knowing what she
was to find. Would he still be there? Would he
have seized the opportunity to escape from a position
which was not, after all, of his seeking? Or if he remained,
would it be with an embarrassed acquiescence
in what had happened, which had been none of his
doing? She could not tell. Her heart was beating
very fast, though her foot was slow. She was not a
humble girl, ready to acknowledge her lord, but a
woman full of natural pride and independence, very
sensitive, deeply wondering what on his side the man
had thought and now had to say.</p>

<p>She was not left long in doubt. Edmund was waiting
in the hall, at the foot of the stairs. The first
thought of her alarmed soul was that he was on his

<!-- page 494 -->

way out, that he had been about to leave the house;
and her heart stopped beating for a moment. But
Edmund was not going away; he put out his hands
to take hers, drawing one through his arm.</p>

<p>"Come out," he said: "now that you have come, I
don't feel that the house can contain me. I have a
thousand and a thousand more things to say."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "what must you think of me?
What can I say to you? Everything seems to have
been taken out of our hands."</p>

<p>"Think of you? It will take a long time to tell
you all that. Say to me? Everything,&mdash;whatever
comes into your mind: for now you are I, and I am
you. Come out into the free air; there is too much
of me to be contained in any house. Dear Elizabeth,
ever dear, there is no ghost to stand between us
now?"</p>

<p>"Did you feel it," she said, "that spectre? Oh,
how could I ever have entertained such an unworthy
thought!"</p>

<p>"I knew it was not Roger," he said. "Some time
you shall hear what he said of you and me, that last
night. But in the mean while we have everything to
say between ourselves and about ourselves. I cannot
hold back a word, because events seem to have settled
it for us. Elizabeth, I am going to begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>They took refuge from the wide landscape in a summer-house
which, but that nature had laden it with a
wild and tangled growth of honeysuckle and jessamine,
would have been an entirely cockney erection,
in the taste of the late Mr. Travers, and there reviewed
the complete rise and progress of a love which
was now by mere force of development clear to both

<!-- page 495 -->

from the beginning, and conscious as it had scarcely
been, until a recent period, but of this both were now
completely unaware. The sunny afternoon sped over
them, the shadows lengthened, a cool breeze tempered
the heat, blowing straight over the treetops
from the sea. Everything was sweet to them,&mdash;the
light and the shadows, the heat and the coolness, the
sun and the breeze. The honeysuckle breathed out
its sweetness into the air: and so did the birds, singing
all manner of love songs and bridal ditties, selecting
the best out of their stores, such as they had used
on their own account in spring. These two, sitting
wrapt in airs of heaven, neither heard the birds nor
smelt the flowers; they had all music and fragrance
and sweetness in themselves. They were as little concerned
in, as little conscious, as little prescient of the
scene going on at Melcombe as if they had lived in
another world.</p>

<p>Thus the conflict and the misery which for an hour
or so had seemed to concentrate in this innocent house,
and which had overshadowed it with gloom, and given
a tragic color to every ray of light, passed away, being
in no manner native to the place. Within doors, the
two injured persons who had been the chief sufferers
forgot everything, and planned their little consolatory
travels with the freshness of delighted children;
while here every cloud flitted away from the two most
blest, united after long tantalizing drifts asunder, in
the enjoyment of that most perfect hour of human fellowship,
the lovers' first mutual understanding. It
does not always happen; but here for once life and
the hour brought no injustice. The clouds passed
away from the innocent household, and did no harm.</p>

<!-- page 496 -->

<p>The other house on the plain below was not so
easily delivered. It was not innocent, but guilty; and
on it the clouds descended, full of lightning and
thunder and storm.</p>

<p class="small">THE LAST OF THE SQUIRE.</p>

</div>

<p>EDMUND did not return to Melcombe till late. He
stayed all the delightful evening through at Mount
Travers, dining there, as in his present position it was
the right and natural thing to do. That afternoon
and evening fled like a dream. Sometimes it happens
that to two people thus suddenly brought together,
after long tending towards each other, and when the
first flush of youthful security has passed, the moment
of union brings a completion as well as a beginning of
life, which is unique in its perfection. It combines
the rapture of early bliss with that deep-seated satisfaction
of maturity, which is rarer, and if not so exquisite,
yet the most real version of happiness. Up
to this moment, they had not lived for themselves.
The life of Elizabeth had been spent in that most perfect
of filial duty which is exercised towards relations
who have the claims of love and kindness without
those of warm sympathy and congeniality. She was
not like the kind old couple who had been so good to
her. Both in what they had done for her and in what
they had withheld, they had often wounded a nature
which was not like theirs. Her uncle had been generous
beyond measure to her in his will, but had put her
into the most false position, and made her the apparent
instrument of a wrong which was abhorrent to
her. Edmund, on the other side, had lived a neutral-colored

<!-- page 498 -->

life, because, no doubt, of a certain spectatorship
of nature, which often betrays a man who is
without any prick of necessity or strong impulse of
passion into indifference and mediocrity. He was one
of those, not, perhaps, the least happy nor the least
useful, who stand aside out of the conflicts of life and
look on, and who seem to attain to little by persistence
of wanting little,&mdash;by an interest which they have
rather in life in the general than in any special objects
to be appropriated to themselves. Such men can be
emancipated and brought into a warmer existence only
by love, which gives them a warmer and stronger
identity by adding another life to theirs. Love that
"smites the chord of self," till it, "trembling, passed
in music out of sight," is one thing; but there is
another, in which the selfsame love, not less noble,
takes up "the harp of life, and smites on all its chords
with might;" so that the musing spectator, the observer
of other men, becomes himself a man by dint of
the woman poured into him, filling his veins and his
soul with an added vitality. This pair found themselves
increased so, with a wonder and a delight beyond
the reach of the simpler boy and girl, who only
know themselves happy. They had each expanded,
risen into a stronger individuality, become more in
themselves by throwing everything into each other.
To both the exquisite novelty of having another self
was not only a blessedness indescribable, but a marvel,
an exhilaration, an elevation of individual being, such
as no prophecy or description had led them to anticipate.
They both seemed to begin to live from that
moment, to understand what it was to have that possession
of human capability and power. At once out
of a world mysteriously indifferent, uncomprehending,

<!-- page 499 -->

uninterested, never able to divine what they would be
at, to possess each an ear into which to pour everything
that came into the heart, each an eye always
awake to what each was doing, each another who was
themselves,&mdash;what a wonder, what a miracle, what an
expansion of living; nay, what life and personal identity!
This day was a revelation, a kind of gospel,
a new communication direct out of heaven for both.
They spent those sunny hours together, which seemed
like so many moments, and yet were of more account
in their life than a dozen previous years. They dined
together at a table which derived a curious dignity
from the thought that henceforth it was to be the centre
of life dispensed to others; of meeting and communion;
of breaking of bread, half sacramental with
the sacred seal of domestic unity, of possession in common.
All common life became splendid and noble in
this illumination; they looked at each other, and read,
radiant, the exposition of what existence actually was
in each other's eyes.</p>

<p>Edmund walked home in the delicious darkness of
the summer night. The road was white under his
feet, the dark hedges standing up on either hand, the
immense vault of sky over him sparkling with innumerable
stars. In his present mood, moonlight would
have been too much; it would have introduced a more
dramatic element, strong shadows along with the intensity
of its white light. He loved better that soft shining
which filled the heavens with delightful company
and silent fellowship. He walked along lightly, as if
he trod upon air, that same road which his father had
traversed in a passion of physical and mental excitement,
which made of it an awful, half-delirious path-way
from life to death; and which Stephen had trod

<!-- page 500 -->

heavily, with anxious thoughts, subsiding rage, and
rising care. He thought of neither of them, nor of
what he should find when he reached home, nor of how
he should communicate the great event which had
happened to himself. None of these things disturbed
Edmund's mind. The fact that he was shut out from
his inheritance had made him perfectly independent.
In comparison with Elizabeth he was poor; but that
did not trouble him. It did not occur to him that any
mean or mercenary motive could ever be associated
with his name; nor did he think of Elizabeth's superior
wealth any more than he thought of the dress she
had worn, or any other matter of insignificant detail.
Every trifle comes to be important in its time, and no
doubt the day would come when he would be critical
about his wife's dress, and like her to wear this or that.
But in the mean time he had no leisure in his mind for
anything but herself, and the wonderful possession
that had come to him in her, Elizabeth. He said
the name over to himself, looking up at the stars with
a low laugh of pleasure, and moisture in his eyes.
Elizabeth,&mdash;that was enough. Not Lizzy: Lizzy
was not characteristic of her, as some pet names
are. Elizabeth,&mdash;a name to be said slowly, savored
in all its syllables, which embodied not softness
only, but strength; a queen's name, a common name,
liquid in the beginning, coming up strong on the
rock of that concluding sound. His laugh sounded
into the silence, a low, congenial note, subdued, yet
the uttermost expression of human pleasure, and satisfaction,
and content. He was not laughing at himself
in his lover's folly, as perhaps a wiser man might
have done, but only for happiness, for pure pleasure,
for delight.</p>

<!-- page 501 -->

<p>The door was still standing wide open when Edmund
reached Melcombe, and a dog-cart stood before
the steps, with lamps, which made a contradictory
yellow glimmer in the paleness of the night. As he
approached, Larkins came out upon the threshold.
"You needn't wait," he said to the driver. "Doctor's
going to stop all night."</p>

<p>"How's master?" said the man.</p>

<p>"Don't say nothing in the house, but it's my opinion
he's a dead man; and if Robson don't think so,
too, I'm a&mdash;&mdash; But mind you, not a word; the family
mightn't like"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that you are saying, Larkins?" Edmund
laid a sudden hand upon the butler's shoulder, which
made him jump.<p>

<p>"Mr. Edmund! I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir.
I didn't see you. I was telling James to put up&mdash;&mdash;
Dr. Robson, sir, he's here, and will not be going&mdash;not
for a bit."</p>

<p>"Who is ill? My father? What is it? You said
he was a dead man."</p>

<p>"He's had a fit, sir. There was nobody there but
me, and it's had that effect upon me that I don't know
what I'm saying. I hope it ain't so bad as that, Mr.
Edmund. Don't go to master's room, sir; Dr. Robson
says no one's to go in. The captain, he's in the
library."</p>

<p>Edmund had gone half-way up the stairs, but he
stopped at this, and came slowly down again. The
shock of this intimation dispersed all that bright atmosphere
about him, as if it had been a bubble, and
brought him back with a sudden jar into so different
a sphere. He was well aware of the significance of the
words "a fit," and remembered, with a throb of painful

<!-- page 502 -->

sensation, his father's continual preoccupation on this
subject, his occasional attempts at self-restraint, because
of what had been said to him of the risks he
ran. Poor father! overwhelmed at last by that tempest
of rage and shame. His exclamation about the
harm that had come to him from his sons recurred to
Edmund's mind. The Squire had passed safely enough
through the contrarieties brought upon him by Roger:
he had seen his first-born die, and buried him, without
any danger from emotion. But now&mdash;&mdash; Edmund approached
the library very unwillingly, with hesitating
steps. The very sight of Stephen would, he felt, be
intolerable; nor did he know how his brother could
look him in the face. The door was ajar, and he
pushed it open with a reluctant hand. The apartment
was dimly lighted by candles on the mantel-piece,
which was at the opposite end of the room from the
Squire's writing-table, usually the central point, with
its one brilliant lamp. The fact that the lamp had
not been lighted was already a sign of approaching
change. Edmund saw with relief that the doctor stood
with Stephen before the fireplace,&mdash;two dark figures
in the ineffectual light.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked. "Doctor, I am
most thankful at least to find you here."

<p>"Not for much good, I'm afraid," returned the doctor,
shaking his head. "He has had a fit, and a bad
one. I must not conceal from you that he is very ill.
I've been afraid of it for some time back. Nothing
we have done has been of any avail as yet."</p>

<p>Edmund asked anxiously how it had happened, and
received from the doctor Larkins's story, cut short of
various details. "He seems to have walked a considerable
distance in the heat of the sun. Your brother

<!-- page 503 -->

does not appear to be aware of any other circumstances."</p>

<p>"He had been very much excited,&mdash;he had made a
painful discovery."</p>

<p>Stephen turned half round, with a dark glance from
under his brows.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed the doctor. Then he added quickly,
"These things, of course, would be but secondary
causes. I have warned him repeatedly that he must
take the utmost care, in respect of diet and&mdash;many
other things. But with all precautions, disease cannot
be staved off. It was bound to come, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"And you take a despondent view?"</p>

<p>"One can never tell," replied Dr. Robson. "He
has had only threatenings, no attack before, and his
strength is intact. I shall stay all night&mdash;or until&mdash;&mdash;
In the mean time, I have been saying to your brother,
if you would like to get a physician from London.
The telegraph is closed by this time; but a message
could be sent by the midnight train."</p>

<p>"I think it would be well to send one, doctor, notwithstanding
our perfect confidence in you."</p>

<p>"I didn't see the use," objected Stephen, with
averted head.</p>

<p>"It is no question of confidence in me. I should
prefer it," the doctor said.</p>

<p>"Then I'll send at once."</p>

<p>Stephen again gave his brother a darkling look.
There was in it a curious defiance, yet timidity. Edmund
was the eldest; he had the first right to act. He
asked no advice from his junior, who was tacitly put
aside altogether, while Edmund consulted with the
doctor, after sending off his message, which was dispatched
by a servant, with authority to engage a special

<!-- page 504 -->

train to bring down the great physician with as
little delay as possible. Stephen walked up and down
the room, while everything was thus taken out of his
hands. He might have attended to these matters on
his own responsibility, and saved himself from being
thus superseded in what he felt, with a <i>sourd</i> mixture
of anger and alarm and satisfaction, to be his own
house. He did not wish to deprive his father of any
care. He did not wish him to die, though that would
be a solution of all the difficulties of the moment, which
it was scarcely possible not to desire. Nothing so bad
as this, however, was in his mind. He could not have
told why he had not acted upon the doctor's suggestion
and telegraphed, so long as there was time. Perhaps
it had been with a vague idea of conciliating Dr. Robson,
of having the doctor on his side; perhaps merely
from a reluctance to act, a hesitation, a resistance, of
which he was now ashamed and wroth with himself.
He might have done it, and asserted his authority, instead
of letting that fellow cut in, as if he had any
right. Meanwhile, Edmund acted as if he had the
sole right. He went up with Dr. Robson to the patient's
room, when the doctor thought it time for another
visit, leaving Stephen still pacing about, agitated
by feelings which he did not dare to show. His
position was one to try the strongest spirit. The probabilities
were that if Mr. Mitford got better everything
would be changed; and though when he heard
from Larkins his father's order that Pouncefort should
be sent for, he had stopped that communication, he
had at the same time sent for his man, and ordered
that everything should be packed up, that he might
be ready to go off at once, if <i>that</i> was what was going
to happen. He was determined he would not endure

<!-- page 505 -->

abuse and loss both. So that if the Squire got well, if
he saw his lawyer and carried out his new intentions,
Stephen had decided to leave the house in an hour's
time, perhaps never to return; while if Mr. Mitford
died, in a moment all would be his, without question
or remark. The balance of possibilities was thus a
very exciting and uncertain one: to be reduced to the
position of a son banished from the paternal home, as
Roger had been, or to be the master and owner of all;
to feel himself set aside from all share in the matter
by Edmund, who took the command naturally, by a
right which everybody acknowledged, or to be the
master, and turn Edmund out. And all this hanging
upon a thread, upon the living or dying of the old
man up-stairs! Stephen did not wish his father to
die. It was something, it was much, that he could resist
that temptation. But he waited with sullen excitement,
low-flaming, self-controlled. He was angry
that the London physician had been sent for, and that
he himself had not sent for him,&mdash;he scarcely knew
which was most annoying,&mdash;and went on pacing in
an angry mood, till Edmund and the doctor should
come down-stairs again, perhaps bringing news.</p>

<p>Edmund saw his brother's boxes packed, as he
passed Stephen's room on his way down-stairs, with
some surprise. He would have preferred, had it been
practicable, to have had no intercourse with him: but
that, it was evident, could not be. He went, once
more slowly and with reluctance, to the library, where
he knew that Stephen was awaiting him. Captain
Mitford stopped in his pacing up and down, and
turned round, when Edmund came in. They stood
and looked at each other for a moment silently; then,
"My father is no better," Edmund said.</p>

<!-- page 506 -->

<p>"I was afraid he would not be," responded Stephen.
"Robson," he added, "seems to have very little
hope."</p>

<p>"Very little hope. Did you see him before the
seizure?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then things are the same between you as when he
left Mount Travers?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>After this brief colloquy, they stood for another
moment looking at each other. To think that this
fellow should confront him, as if he were the master,
and that at any moment it might be he, Stephen, who
was the master, and able to turn Edmund out! This
was the thought that burned in Stephen's mind. On
the chance of a moment! But as yet, no one knew
how that chance might turn.</p>

<div class="center" id="XLVII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>XLVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE BREAK-UP.</p>

</div>

<p>THE long night passed in discomfort and gloom, in
broken dozes and broken conversations, with long
pauses. The two young men sat opposite to each other,
obliged to keep each other company, yet with nothing
to say. A jealous alarm prevented Stephen from
retiring to his room. He felt that something might
happen, if he were not always on the watch. The
Squire might recover his senses. Pouncefort might arrive,
and find some means, which neither doctor nor
nurse was capable of, to get him round. Who could
tell what might happen? Edmund remained up to
receive the report of the doctor, to watch for the possible
arrival of the physician from town, and also partly
because he could not sleep. Dr. Robson came and
went from the sick-room to the library below, throwing
himself on the sofa in the intervals, to take that
rest which doctors as well as nurses know to be so indispensable
in face of eventualities. The doctor
thought, in the breaks of his sleep, that he had never
seen anything more strange than the aspect of the two
brothers, seated each in his corner, exchanging few
words, taking little notice of each other, while their
father lay between life and death, up-stairs. Was it
feeling? he asked himself, or what was it? He, too,
had seen the packed and strapped portmanteaus within
the open door of Stephen's room, and wondered

<!-- page 508 -->

who was going away, and why, and what had been the
"painful discovery" the patient had made, which one
brother had not mentioned, and the other had at once
identified as one of the causes of the seizure. This
wonder did not prevent Dr. Robson, who was a young
man in robust health, from sleeping, any more than
anxiety for his patient did; but it passed through his
mind, with some half guess at the cause, before he
went to sleep, with these two dark figures before him,&mdash;one
bolt upright in his chair, in a fictitious watchfulness,
the other with his face hid in the shadow of
the hand which supported his head. There was no
reason why they should both sit up. They seemed to
be keeping a watch on each other, like sentinels of
two contending parties. Their aspect was so strange,
and the consciousness of their presence so strong, that
they made the doctor dream. He could not shake
from his mind the certainty that they were there.</p>

<p>The London doctor came in the morning, not having
hurried himself unduly, and regretting, as he said,
the great additional expense that would have been
entailed upon the survivors had a special train been
necessary. He arrived, fresh and neat, upon the exhausted
and excited household, and with a mind quite
free from any tortures of suspense. But his examination
of the patient did not come to much. He said,
when he came down-stairs, that it was impossible to
tell&mdash;the patient might linger a day or two; he might
even rally, by extreme good fortune; or another attack
might come on, and terminate the matter at once.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that it is to his advantage
that he has survived so long," said this great authority,
with a meaning which was comprehensible enough.
"To be sure," cried Dr. Robson, who was an imprudent

<!-- page 509 -->

young man, "it is to his advantage that he has
survived, or he would be dead by this time."</p>

<p>But the fact was that no more light was to be
thrown upon the question by science, and the London
physician came and went, as such great authorities
often do, in a case which is beyond the reach of mortal
power.</p>

<p>The only incident in the miserable lingering day
was the arrival of Mr. Pouncefort, who had, by some
mysterious bird of the air carrying the matter, or other
occult agency, found out that his client was dying,
and had expressed a wish that he should be sent for.
He arrived when Stephen had permitted himself to
believe that danger was over, and was about to lie
down for needful rest. But the sight of the lawyer
roused the heir at once.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't advise you to stay," Captain Mitford
observed. "He'll never be able for business again."</p>

<p>"It's hard to tell," said Mr. Pouncefort. "I've
seen a man turn everything upside down in his succession,
after that had been said of him."</p>

<p>Stephen stared at the new-comer with glazed and
weary eyes, in which a sullen fire burned behind the
film of exhaustion; but restrained the impulse to reply.
He sat down again, however, in the chair which
he had occupied all night, determined to keep this
dangerous visitor in sight. Mr. Pouncefort had no
compassion for the supplanter who had been put into
his brother's place, in spite of all he had himself been
able to do against it. He asked a hundred questions:
how the attack came on; what was the cause; whether
there had been any "worry" at the bottom of so sudden
a seizure. "People say something occurred to put
him out, but of course you must know."</p>

<!-- page 510 -->

<p>"I don't know; he was out in the sun, on one of
those hot days,&mdash;that's what the doctor thinks."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's what the doctor thinks? Robson, is
it? He ought to know your father's constitution. I
should have thought the Squire was pretty well used
to being out in the sun."</p>

<p>"You had better ask Robson," said Stephen; "he'll
be here presently;" and then there was a silence between
them.</p>

<p>The lawyer had a bag with papers, which he opened
and looked over, perhaps ostentatiously; he had no
desire to spare the young man. Stephen was overcome
with fatigue. He kept dropping into momentary
dozes, from which he started, opening wide in defiance
his red and heavy eyes. But he would not now
go to bed or do anything to refresh himself; he was
like a jailer in attendance upon some troublesome
prisoner; he would not let this new enemy out of his
sight.</p>

<p>This suspense lasted till far on in the second night,
when there was a sudden stir and commotion in the
sick-room, and the doctor was hurriedly called upstairs.
In a very short time the others were summoned.
They stood about the bed, Mr. Pouncefort
placing himself at the foot, with an anxious intention
of catching what last glimpse of intelligence might
come into the eyes of the dying man. But it was
too late for anything of the kind. The Squire had
been stricken down by another and more violent seizure.
He was so strong in vitality, and his physical
forces were so little impaired, that even now he made a
struggle for his life; but in vain. Presently the loud
breathing stopped. Silence replaced that awful, involuntary
throbbing of the human mechanism, from

<!-- page 511 -->

which the inspiring force had gone. Love and grief
had little place in that death-scene; but there is something
overawing and impressive in every transit from
life to death. The two sons stood side by side, without
a word. Simmons, the housekeeper, half with a
feminine sense of what was becoming, half perhaps with
a real human regret for the master of so many years,
sniffed a little behind the curtain. The others all
stood in dead silence, while the doctor closed those
staring, troubled eyes.</p>

<p>Stephen was the first to leave the room. He went
straight to his own, where his servant was hanging
about, in the agitation which fills a household at such
a moment. He kicked the portmanteaus with his foot,
and said loudly, "Undo all that," before he closed
the door. He wanted rest and sleep above all things,
but he could not refrain from that one token of an
anxiety now laid at rest. Only Mr. Pouncefort, however,
took any notice of this symbolical action. Stephen
had been of no account in the house during these two
days, and when he disappeared without even a good-night,
without a sign of civility, the others were too
much preoccupied to notice. Dr. Robson was eager to
get home,&mdash;he had spent the greater part of two nights
out of his house; and Edmund went down-stairs with
him, to settle and arrange everything. The lawyer
stole away to the room which had been prepared for
him, and after a few hours' rest left the house in the
morning, before any one was astir. His mission had
been a failure. Sometimes there is a moment of possibility,
a place of repentance, afforded to a man at the
very end of his life. But in this case there was nothing
of the kind. The wrong done was done permanently,
and all was now over. That strange injustice

<!-- page 512 -->

which lies underneath the surface of life, which gives
the lie to all the optimisms of philanthropy, which is
restrained by no law, and is so often permitted to
establish itself in absolute impunity, had again gained
the upper hand. There was no appeal to be made, no
redress possible. The dead man might have repented,
had time been left him. But all the stars in their
courses had fought for the unworthy. Mr. Pouncefort
felt this angrily, almost shaking his fist at the serene
heavens which overlooked everything, and, so far as
appeared, took no heed. To Edmund the same
thought came, but in a different form, as he stood at
his window, looking out upon a firmament all living
with innumerable lights. The real sufferer was not
angry. He looked out with a profound sadness, yet
with that half smile of spectatorship which had been
habitual to him all his life. Perhaps at no period
would he have felt his disinheritance so sharply as
another man might; at this moment he did not feel it
at all. Poor father! was what he thought,&mdash;who
had taken that step of injustice in vain; who had rewarded
the evil-doer, and punished him to whom he intended
no wrong. It was hard to think of the Squire
as changed into some heavenly semblance, a spiritual
being moved by spiritual motives alone. Edmund's
imagination could not reach so far. He thought of his
father as perhaps suddenly enlightened as to this irony
of fate, cognizant of the evil he had done, impotent to
amend it, obliged to bow to the inexorable fact which
his own arbitrary will had created, and carrying about
the consciousness of this tremendous mistake and failure
in a quickened being, to which, perhaps, there
would no longer belong the happy human faculty of
forgetfulness. Would not that be hell enough,&mdash;or
purgatory, at least?</p>

<!-- page 513 -->

<p>Things went on at Melcombe without further change
for some days. Stephen took no charge in respect to
the funeral, or any of the immediate arrangements
which had to be made. He stood by, passive, while
Edmund gave all the orders and attended to everything.
Not a word was said while the father lay dead
in the house. They even dined together in silence,
broken only by a few conventional phrases from time
to time. The brothers-in-law were abroad, out of
reach; and though the entire county came to the funeral,
there were no relations except a distant cousin
or two, and no one in the house to break the brothers'
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. When all was over, they returned alone
together to the house. Mr. Pouncefort was the principal
executor, and there was no question between them
about any of the details. Once more the family table
was spread for the two brothers, who had walked side
by side after their father's coffin. It would be impossible
to describe the scarcely contained excitement of
Larkins and his assistants as to how this dinner would
go off. Stephen solved the question for them without
delay. He came in first, with his hands plunged
deeply into his pockets and his eyebrows lowered over
his eyes, and took his father's place. Instead of the
restrained and formal conversation of the intervening
days, he now began to talk. He spoke of what he
was going to do.</p>

<p>"I'll very likely go out and join the Stathams, for
a bit. I'm not fond of the Continent, but one doesn't
know what to do with one's self, just at first. It's
too early for Monte Carlo and that sort of thing. I
don't know what sort of beastly place they may have
got to, but Statham's sure to look out for himself, and
get something or other to do. And one can't have

<!-- page 514 -->

a lot of fellows down all at once to fill up the old
place."</p>

<p>"No, that would hardly do," Edmund answered.</p>

<p>His brother gave him a surly look from underneath
his lowering brows. "I don't see why it shouldn't do,
if one made up one's mind to it. I don't mind gossip,
for my part. But there would be nothing for them to
do. I mean to have a lot of men down for September."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Edmund, for Stephen had hesitated.</p>

<p>"And I think," he went on, after a moment, "of
shutting up the house till then. There's an idle lot
of servants about." He had paused to say this until all
but Larkins were out of the room. "I rather think of
making a clean sweep. What does very well for an
old lot, don't you know, doesn't do when a man's
young. So I thought may be it wouldn't be a bad
plan to&mdash;let it, perhaps, for a month or two, or else
shut up the house."</p>

<p>"To let it&mdash;for a month or two!" exclaimed Edmund,
in consternation.</p>

<p>"Well, quantities of people do; but I don't say
I've made up my mind to that. Only, I'll either
take that course, or else shut up. It's dull enough
here, Heaven knows. I was thinking, perhaps if you
could make it convenient&mdash;when it suits, don't you
know&mdash;that is, as soon as you can manage it&mdash;to
clear out."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I had meant to tell you. I
think of going to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right," rejoined Stephen. "I didn't mean to
put on the screw, but it's always best that fellows
should understand each other, don't you know, from
the first."</p>

<p>"Much the best," Edmund said.</p>

<p>THESE were almost the last words which passed at
this period between Captain Mitford of Melcombe and
his brother. Stephen left within a few days, having
succeeded so well in clearing the house that the servants
forestalled him by giving their demission <i>en
masse</i>, headed by Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Simmons,
whom Stephen's speech about the idle lot, duly reported
by the equally offended Larkins, had wounded
to the quick. He was obliged to leave the place in the
hands of some of the lower drudges of the kitchen, who
had no feelings, and were delighted to succeed to the
positions vacated by their betters; and to have the
house set up anew, with expensive menials, supplied
by a London agent, when he returned. He failed in
ousting the Fords, for the excellent reason that they
had finally decided to take advantage of his first hasty
dismissal; so that his emissaries found nothing but
an empty house, when they went to carry his decision
into effect. Stephen was not aware that he escaped
an action for wages and board wages, which Ford was
bent on bringing against him, only by means of Edmund's
entreaties and the compensation he offered,
in order that the family name should not be dragged
through the mire, in public at least. But notwithstanding
these efforts, the facts of the case got
breathed about in the county, creating not only a

<!-- page 516 -->

strong feeling against the new lord of Melcombe, but,
what he dreaded still more, a wave of riotous ridicule,
such as went far, sweeping through half the mess-rooms
in the country in echoes of inextinguishable
laughter: "Heard of Mitford of the Red Roans,&mdash;how
he was sold? Thought he had got a simpleton
in hand, that knew no better; but, by Jove! out she
marched, colors flying, and left him <i>plant&eacute;-l&agrave;!</i>" The
other tales about him, which roused a graver indignation,&mdash;how
he had been the means of his brother
Roger's death, and, by a sudden discovery of his ridiculous
adventures and shameful conduct, of his father's,&mdash;though
these rumors were bad enough, were not,
either in the estimation of his special public or in his
own, so overwhelming as the story of Lily's escape and
the ridicule of his failure. Even Statham and Markham,
his brothers-in-law, "roared" as they described
it, at Steve's absurd position.</p>

<p>"But I'd cut the whole concern, if I were you, for
a year or two, old fellow," Statham said. "Don't go
back there this year. Have a go at the big game, or
something."</p>

<p>"Try Africa," said Markham.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I'll do neither the one nor the other!
What are you talking of? I'll see you all at&mdash;Jericho,
first! And if you don't care to come to Melcombe for
September,&mdash;why, you can try Africa yourselves,"
Stephen said.</p>

<p>This somewhat changed the ideas of the brothers-in-law,
who were not averse to coming to Melcombe for
the partridges. They endeavored to make their wives
laugh, too, at the story of Lily, with but partial success;
for women are certainly destitute of a fine sense
of humor.</p>

<!-- page 517 -->

<p>"It was odious of Stephen, beyond anything!"
Lady Statham said; "but still, that little set-up thing!&mdash;what
did she expect, I wonder?" And, "It must
have been her own fault," Amy said. Nina told her
little tale with the same gravity, without seeing the fun.
"<i>I</i> knew Stephen was after Lily, when he used to go
out in the park after dinner. What should he go out
in the park for, if he was not after somebody? To
smoke his cigar! Oh! as if a man went out like that
only to smoke his cigar! Simmons always shook her
head. She used to say a gentleman was up to no good,
when he went out in the evenings. Would you let
Statham go out like that, if you knew there was somebody
at the West Lodge, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Bertie's got his smoking-room," said Lady Statham,
indignant, "if there were twenty West Lodges.
But I do think poor papa was to blame about the boys,
never letting them smoke at home."</p>

<p>"Boys are so ready to go wrong," sighed Amy, who
was ten years younger than her brothers. Then the
party melted away, dispersing in different directions,
and leaving only Nina, who knew better than any one
how much neglected the boys had been, and how natural
it was that they should stray to the West Lodge,
while they smoked their cigars.</p>

<p>Stephen came back in September, and found his
house perfectly established with fine footmen from
London, and not an old face to remind him of the
past. His friends arrived soon after, filling the house.
But though the covers were in very good order, and
the birds abundant, it was not a successful performance,
on the whole. Even the Tredgolds had other
engagements, when he asked them to dinner. When
the Stathams and the Markhams came, there was one

<!-- page 518 -->

entertainment which did well, and that was a garden-party,
at which nobody was compelled to pay any particular
attention to the master of the house. Otherwise
the county cut him, to his intense astonishment
and rage. And after that he took Statham's advice,
and went abroad,&mdash;not to Africa, in search of big
game, which would have been the best thing, but to
Monte Carlo and other resorts of the same kind.
Meantime, the London servants and the new establishment
had cost him for three months more money
than the old Squire had spent in a couple of years.
Altogether, Stephen's affairs were not prosperous, nor
his prospects bright. But, no doubt, if he stays away
for a time, and keeps his estate at nurse, and especially
if he marries well, and brings home a wife acceptable
to the county, the weight of permanence and continuation
will tell in his favor, and Captain Mitford will be
received, if not with open arms, at least back again
into a tolerable place.</p>

<p>Edmund left Melcombe the morning after his father's
funeral. He did not see Stephen again. He
made arrangements for the removal of all his special
belongings, and went away without much regret from
the house that should have been his home. There are
some who feel more than others the loss of houses and
lands; and there are some who tear themselves with
difficulty from the walls that have been their shelter all
their life. In both points Edmund was a little at fault.
He felt no despair at the loss of his inheritance; he
had never thought of it as his. All the emotion he
had on the subject he had spent when Roger was sent
away, and perhaps the only pang that had moved him
concerning his own share of the loss was when Roger,
unaware of what had passed, had anticipated for Edmund

<!-- page 519 -->

the heirship he had himself lost. Edmund had
experienced a constriction of his heart when his brother
had indulged in that half-melancholy, half-smiling picture
of what he believed was to be: himself with Lily,
not happy perhaps, after the ordinary meaning of the
word, yet feeling his only possibility of life to be by
her side; and Edmund and his Elizabeth in Melcombe,
the centres of a wider existence. Tears, which had not
been drawn from Edmund's eyes by his own deposition,
rose at the thought of that talk of things that
were not to be.</p>

<p>He went, after he had left the house, to the corner
of the parish church in which was the Melcombe
vault. He was not unmindful of his father, either.
What disappointments, what self-deception, what vain
anticipations, never to be realized, were shut up there
in the darkness, in that gloomy place where the ashes
of the Mitfords were kept from mingling with common
dust! Edmund could not think of any failure
of his own, in the presence of the failure of all their
plans and wishes. He stood leaning upon the old
brick wall, with his feet among the rank herbage;
then, with an ache in his heart to leave there all that
had been Roger, all the human hopes and wishes that
were never to be fulfilled, and with that ache of wonder
which is in all our hearts as to what they know of
us who have left us, in the mystery of their new existence,
Edmund turned away, and set out upon his own.
Happy Edmund in his mourning, in his deprivation,
with his home shut against him, and all natural expectation
cut off! He passed through these troubles
lightly enough, having his own happiness to fall back
upon, which waited serenely for him after all was
over; holding open the gates of another paradise, the

<!-- page 520 -->

individual inheritance, which is for every man who has
a centre of love to turn to, and a meet companion awaiting
him there.</p>

<p>Stephen, as it turned out, had been of the greatest
use to the household at Mount Travers, by the firebrand
he had thrown into the midst of it. Mrs. Travers
did not, indeed, recover from the shock all at once;
at least, she did not relinquish the pleasure of taking
up that exhausted firebrand, and thrusting it at Elizabeth,
as a sort of offensive weapon, inflicting a wound
which, when she saw how it hurt, the old lady wept
over and kissed to make it well, with an alternation of
reproach and conciliation which was not without its
enjoyment. Elizabeth, delivered from the incessant
strain of keeping this secret from her aunt, was now
free to use what means she could to set the wrong
right,&mdash;a thing which in her ignorance she had supposed
to be attended by endless difficulties, but which,
with Edmund's help and backing up, became the easiest
matter in the world. Before they were married
Elizabeth settled upon Mrs. Travers the great house
on the hill, with its plate-glass windows and all its luxuries,
with an income sufficient to make the keeping up
of the establishment possible to the widow. This was a
serious diminution of her wealth, but Edmund liked it
all the better. They were still rich enough for all their
desires. They had the luck to get possession of an old
house which had been the Melcombe dower-house, a
picturesque, old-fashioned place, which had passed out
of the hands of the Mitfords several generations before,
and now came suddenly into the market, to the great
satisfaction of the disinherited son. We will not deny
that it gave Elizabeth a pang to think of her husband
settling down in the same county, on a little bit of

<!-- page 521 -->

property so much inferior to Melcombe, and in a house
which was nothing but a dependency of the family
home possessed by his younger brother. But Edmund
only laughed at this feminine grudge.</p>

<p>"Whatever he does, he must always carry that
mark of cadency," he said. "It frightened my poor
father almost out of changing his will, but it does not
seem to impress you, Lizzy." By this time, our young
man had got so familiar with his own good fortune,
and so possessed by the ease of his happiness, and felt
it so difficult to realize that she had not always belonged
to him, that he had forgotten that superlative
sentiment of his about the name of Elizabeth, and
called her Lizzy, like other people, with the best grace
in the world.</p>

<p>"If that were the only sign of cadency, as you call
it, I should not care much about it," said his wife, indignantly;
"but when I think what you are, Edmund,
and what he is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am no such great things, if I had not you to
back me up. But whatever poor Steve has, he can't
get rid of that little mark. I must be the head of the
family, though I have nothing, and he has all."</p>

<p>"And you say 'poor Steve'!" cried Elizabeth,
with a flash of disdain in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dearest," Edmund said, "poor Steve.
And when he thinks, as he must do now and then, you
may be sure he feels it, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mitford shook her head indignantly (it was
very certain that she was Mrs. Mitford, and that the
lady of Melcombe, when there might come to be one,
could be nothing but Mrs. Stephen), and perhaps hers,
though the less generous, was the truer estimate.
Stephen had sundry pricks to put up with, but in the

<!-- page 522 -->

end, no doubt, people would forget, and he would remain
the most important personage in the consciousness
of many persons who forgot that old story. It is
much to be doubted whether Edmund himself, though
he produced it laughing, to smooth down his wife's indignation,
thought very much of the mark of cadency,
or of the fact that he himself bore the family coat
without a difference. What pleased him most was
that he had possession of certain simpler things; that
is to say, that he had got the wife he wanted, and the
happiness which he had long despaired of, and a home
such as he had dreamed of, but up to his marriage
had never known. He thought these things were
enough for a man, with or without the position which
befits the head of the family; and a number of persons,
we hope, will think that Edmund was right.</p>

<p>Lily Ford remained Mrs. Travers's companion, and
a most congenial one,&mdash;more congenial than Elizabeth,
though it was not necessary to say so. When
the old lady received the deed of gift which reinstated
her in full possession of what her husband ought to
have left her, she accepted it with difficulty and much
resistance, and would really have preferred to keep
her grievance instead, which was a thing that involved
no responsibilities. She managed to retain a
little of that, however, by making her will instantly,
and leaving her property again to Elizabeth. "What
could I do?" she said. "Of course, whatever I
wished, she left me no alternative, after the step she
took." The plate-glass windows were all shut up for
a long time, and the house stood blindly staring out
upon the landscape, with no eyes to see it, while Mrs.
Travers and her companion went abroad. It would be
difficult to say which of the two more completely enjoyed

<!-- page 523 -->

these travels. Lily, with the honest, peasant
foundation of her character, found it indispensable to
give an equivalent for what she received, by bestowing
double care and attention upon the old lady, who was
not her mistress, but yet depended upon her for a
great part of the comfort of her life. As she was
quick and intelligent, and soon able to make her smattering
of boarding-school French useful, and pretty,
and well dressed, and pleasant to behold, and incapable
of conceiving anything happier or more elevated than
the little course of commonplace tours, which were to
both the most exciting of travels, she satisfied Mrs.
Travers's every requirement as a companion. No
mother and daughter could have been more happy together.
To travel about in first-class carriages, to live
in grand hotels, to be looked up to as one of the
simple tourist ladies, to whom every innkeeper was obsequious,
filled Lily with an elation which had, after
all, something more in it than personal aggrandizement;
it was the ideal after which she had sighed, the
plan that pleased her childish thought. Perhaps the
aspiration to be a lady, in the acceptation of the word
which occurs to a gamekeeper's daughter,&mdash;to live
among beautiful things, according to what her imagination
holds for beautiful; to have the leisure, the
grace, the softness, the brightness of ladyhood about
her, instead of inhabiting a cottage and working at
needlework for a living,&mdash;is not, after all, an aspiration
to be despised. It was the best thing she knew,
just as traveling on the Continent was the finest occupation
she knew, the thing which the finest people did.
She would not have bought that elevation, as she had
proved, in anything but an honest way. Meantime,
her father and mother had charge of Mount Travers,

<!-- page 524 -->

Mrs. Ford occupying the fine position of housekeeper,
while the "ladies"&mdash;oh! the delight of that word,
which the mother, with profound self-abnegation,
turned over in her mouth like a sweet morsel, as she
said it&mdash;were absent on their tour. Lily had now a
little fortune of her own,&mdash;the money which Roger
had meant to settle upon her when she should be his
wife. She was not sure that she could have chosen
anything more desirable for herself, had she been permitted
to choose her own fate.</p>

<p>Poor Roger! This was all his foolish love had
come to,&mdash;the love which he knew to be foolish;
which had cost him his inheritance, and, in a manner,
his life. Was not his fate, perhaps, the best after all,&mdash;to
escape from all the net-work of misery which
would have caught his feet, the unsuitable companionship
which never could have satisfied his mind, and to
begin over again in a world where at least the same
mistakes cannot be possible? But it is hard for men
to think so, to whom it must always seem a better
thing to fulfill the mortal course set before them,
through whatever pains and troubles, and live out their
life.</p>
