<h3>THE USURER'S GIFT.</h3>

</div>

<!-- page 232 col 1 -->

<p>A FEW months ago in London an old man
sat in a large paneled room in one of the
streets near Soho-square. Every thing in the
apartment was brown with age and neglect.
Nothing more superlatively dingy could well be
imagined. The leathern covers of the chairs
were white and glossy at the edges; the carpet
was almost of a uniform tint, notwithstanding
its original gaudy contrasts; there were absurd
old engravings upon the walls&mdash;relics of the infancy
of the art; and curtains to the windows,
which the smoke of years had darkened from a
delicate fawn to a rusty chocolate color. In the
centre of the room, and, as it were, the sun of
this dusty system, stood an office-table of more
modern manufacture, at which was seated the
old man alluded to, sole lord and master of the
dismal domicile. He was by profession a money-lender.
His age might be from sixty to sixty-five
years; his face was long, and his features
seemed carved out of box-wood or yellow sandstone,
so destitute were they of mobility; his
eyes were of a cold, pale, steel color, but his
brows were black and tufted like a grim old

<!-- page 232 col 2 -->

owl's; a long aquiline nose, a thin and compressed
mouth, and a vast double chin, buried
in a voluminous white neckcloth of more than
one day's wear, completed the portrait. Nor
did the expression of his countenance undergo
any perceptible change as, after a timid knock,
the door opened, and a young man entered of
singularly interesting appearance.</p>

<p>The new-comer was well-dressed, though his
clothes were none of the newest, and had the
air of a man accustomed to society. His pale
brow was marked with those long horizontal
lines of which time is rarely the artist. His
dark, deep-set gray eyes flashed with a painful
brightness; his long chestnut hair, damp with
perspiration, clung in narrow strips to his forehead;
his whole manner implied the man who
had made up his mind to some extraordinary
course, from which no wavering or weakness on
his part was likely to turn him aside, whatever
the opposition of others might compel him to
abandon or determine. Bending his tall figure
slightly, he addressed the money-lender in a tone
of constrained calmness.</p>

<p>"You lend money, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;on good security," replied the
usurer, indifferently, forming a critical summary
of his visitor's costume at a glance.</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated: there was a discouraging
sort of coldness in the mode of delivering
this answer that seemed to prejudge
his proposition. Nevertheless, he resumed with
an effort&mdash;"I saw your advertisement in the
paper." The usurer did not even nod in answer
to this prelude. He sat bolt upright
in his chair, awaiting further information. "I am,
as you will see by these papers, entitled to some
property in reversion."</p>

<p>The usurer stretched out his hand for the
papers, which he looked over carefully with the
same implacable tranquillity, while his visitor
entered into explanations as to their substance.</p>

<p>Once only the money-lender peered over the
top of a document he was scanning, and said,
gruffly: "Your name, sir, is Bernard West?"</p>

<p>"It is," replied the stranger, mechanically
taking up a newspaper, in which the first thing
which caught his eye was the advertisement
alluded to, which ran thus:&mdash;"<i>Money</i> to any
amount advanced immediately on every description
of security, real or personal. Apply between
the hours of ten and five to Mr. John Brace, &mdash;&mdash;
street, Soho-square."</p>

<p>After a brief interval of silence, the usurer
methodically rearranged the papers, and returned
them to the stranger. "They are of no use," he
said, "no use whatever: the reversion is merely
contingent. You have no available security to
offer?"</p>

<p>"Could you not advance something upon these
expectations&mdash;not even a small sum?"</p>

<p>"Not a farthing," said the money-lender.</p>

<p>"Is there no way of raising fifty&mdash;thirty&mdash;even
twenty pounds?" said the stranger, anxiously,
and with the tenacity of a drowning man
grasping at a straw.</p>

<!-- page 233 col 1 -->

<p>"There is a way," said the usurer, carelessly.
West in his turn was silent, awaiting the explanation
of his companion. "On personal
security," continued the latter with a sinister
impatience, beginning to arrange his writing
materials for a letter.</p>

<p>"I will give any discount," said the young
man, eagerly. "My prospects are good: I
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get a friend to be security for the payment
of the interest?"</p>

<p>"Of the interest and principal, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Of the interest only&mdash;and the life insurance,"
added the usurer, with a slight peculiarity of intonation
that might have escaped the notice of
one whose nerves were less exalted in their sensitive
power than those of his visitor's.</p>

<p>"And what sum can I borrow on these terms?"
said West, gloomily.</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds: more if you require it.
In fact, any amount, if your security be good."</p>

<p>"The interest will doubtless be high?"</p>

<p>"Not at all: four or five per cent. As much
is often given for money on mortgage of land."</p>

<p>"And the life insurance?"</p>

"You will insure your life for five hundred
pounds, and you will pay the premiums with
the interest."</p>

<p>"For <i>five</i> hundred?" said West, hesitating.
"That is, if I borrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>One</i> hundred," replied the usurer, sharply.
"Men who lend money do not run risks. You
may die, and four out of five insurance offices
may fail; but the chances are that the fifth
would pay."</p>

<p>"But it is not likely&mdash;" began Bernard West,
amazed at this outrageous display of caution.</p>

<p>"I do not say it is likely," snarled the usurer
with a contemptuous sort of pity for his visitor's
dullness of apprehension; "I say it is possible;
and I like to be on the safe side."</p>

<p>"Well, and how is the affair to be arranged?"</p>

<p>"Your security, who of course must be a person
known to have property, will give a bond
guaranteeing the regular payment of interest and
premiums&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>West reflected for some minutes in silence.
The faint expression of hope that had for an instant
lighted up his countenance vanished. He
understood the money-lender and his proposition.
A sufficiently clear remembrance of the tables of
life assurance which he had seen, enabled him
to perceive that the interest and premiums together
would amount to nearly twenty per cent.,
and that the bond engaged his security to pay
an annuity for his (West's) life of that amount.
It is true that, full of energy and hope, he felt
no doubt of his capacity to meet the payments
regularly: it is true that, monstrous as were the
terms, he would have accepted eagerly still
harder ones, had it simply depended on his own
decision. But where find, or how ask, a friend
to become his bondsman? He ran over in
despair the scanty list of acquaintances whom
his poverty had not already caused to forget
him. He felt that the thing was impossible.

<!-- page 233 col 2 -->

There was not one he could think of who would
have even dreamed of entering into such a
compact. He turned desperately to the money-lender.</p>

<p>"I have no friend," he said, "of whom I could
or would ask such a service. If I had, I should
not be here. Are there <i>no</i> terms, however high,
on which you can lend me even the most trifling
sum, for which I myself alone need be responsible?"</p>

<p>"None," replied the usurer, already commencing
his letter.</p>

<p>"I will give thirty per cent.?"</p>

<p>"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Fifty?"</p>

<p>The usurer shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>"A hundred&mdash;cent. per cent.?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The strange seeker of loans at length rose to
depart. He reached the door. Suddenly he
turned back, his eyes blazing with the sombre
radiance of despair. He strode up to the table,
and planted himself, with folded arms, immediately
in front of the usurer.</p>

<p>"Mark me!" said West, in a tone of deep
suppressed passion, like the hollow murmur of
the sea before a storm: "It is a question of life
or death with me to get money before sunset.
Lend me only twenty pounds, and within twelve
months I will repay you one hundred. I will
give you every power which the law can give
one man over another; and I will pledge my
honor, which never yet was questioned, to the
bargain!"</p>

<p>The usurer almost smiled, so strangely sarcastic
was the contraction of his features, as he
listened to these words.</p>

<p>"I do not question your honor," he said, icily,
"but honor has nothing to do with business.
As for the law, there is an old axiom which
says, Out of nothing, nothing comes."</p>

<p>Bernard West regarded the cold rocky face
and the passionless mouth from which these
words proceeded with that stinging wrath a
man feels who has humiliated himself in vain.
Nevertheless he clung to the old flinty usurer as
to the last rock in a deluge, and a sense of savage
recklessness came over him when he advanced
yet closer to the living cash-box before him,
while the latter shrank half-terrified before the
burning gaze of his visitor's dilated pupils.</p>

<p>Laying his hand upon the money-lender's
shoulder, by a gesture of terrible familiarity that
insisted upon and commanded attention to his
words, West spoke with a sudden clearness and
even musical distinctness of utterance that made
his words yet more appalling in their solemn
despair&mdash;"Old man, I am desperate; I am
ruined. It is but a few months since my father
died, leaving me not only penniless, but encircled
by petty obligations which have cramped every
movement I would have made. I have had no
time, no quiet, to make an effort such as my
position requires. This day I have spent my
last shilling. I am too proud to beg, and to
borrow is to beg when a man is known to be in

<!-- page 234 col 1 -->

<i>real</i> distress. Within one hour from this time
I shall be beyond all the tortures of a life which
for my own sake I care little to preserve. And
yet I have spent my youth in accumulating
treasures, which but a brief space might have
rendered productive of benefit to man, and of
profit to myself. My father's little means and
my own have vanished in the pursuit of science,
and in the gulf of suffering more immediate than
our own. If I die also, with me perish the results
of his experiments, his studies, and his
sacrifices. There are moments when all ordinary
calculations and prudence are empty baubles.
Life is the only real possession we have, and
death the only certainty. Listen! I will make
one last proposal to you. Lend me but <i>ten</i>
pounds&mdash;that is but <i>ten</i> weeks of life&mdash;and I
swear to you that if I live, I will repay you for
each pound lent not ten or twenty, but one
hundred&mdash;in all, one thousand pounds! Grant
that it be but a chance upon the one hand, yet,
upon the other, how small is the risk; and then,
to save a human life&mdash;is not that something in
the scale?" And the stranger laughed at these
last words with a bitter gayety, which caused a
strange thrill to creep along the nerves of the
usurer.</p>

<p>However, the lender of gold shrugged his
shoulders without relaxing his habitual impassibility
of manner. He did not speak. Possibly
the idea occurred to him that his strange
client meditated some act of violence upon himself 
or his strong box. But this idea speedily
vanished, as the stranger, relapsing suddenly
into silence and conventional behavior, removed
his hand from the usurer's shoulder, and strode
rapidly but calmly from the apartment.</p>

<p>The door closed behind the ruined man, and
the usurer drew a long breath, while his bushy
brows were contracted in a sort of agony of
doubt and irresolute purpose.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bernard West paused for an instant
on the threshold of the outer-door, as if
undecided which road to take. In truth all
roads were much alike to him at that moment.
Some cause, too subtle to be seized by the mental
analyst, determined his course. He turned to
the right, and strode rapidly onward.</p>

<p>He felt already like one of the dead, to join
whom he was hurrying headlong. He looked
neither to the right nor to the left; and before
him was a mist, in which the phantoms of his
imagination disported themselves, to the exclusion
of all other visible objects. Nothing earthly
had any further interest for him. He did not
even hear the steps of some one running behind
him, nor hear the voice which called after him
to stop; but his course was soon more effectually
arrested by the firm grasp of a man's hand, which
seized him by the arm with the force and the
tenacity of a vice.</p>

<p>He turned fiercely round. He was in no
humor for the converse of casual acquaintances.
Nor was it any gay convivialist of happier days
whose face now greeted him: it was the old
money-lender, who in a voice husky with loss

<!-- page 234 col 2 -->

of breath, or possibly emotion, said, thrusting a
couple of twenty-pound bank-notes into West's
hand&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here! take these notes. Take them, I
say!" he repeated, as the young man, dizzy
with amazement, stammered out&mdash;</p>

<p>"You accept, then, my terms?"</p>

<p>"No!" growled the usurer, "I <i>give</i> them to
you. Do you understand me? I say I <i>give</i>
them to you. I am an old man; I never gave
away a shilling before in my life! Repay me
if you will, when and how it please you. I
have no security&mdash;I ask no acknowledgment; I
want none. I do not count upon it. <i>It is gone!</i>"
and the usurer pronounced the last words with
an effort which was heroic, from the evident
self-mastery it cost him. "There! go&mdash;go!"
he resumed, "and take an old man's advice&mdash;Make
money at all hazards, and never lend except
on good security. Remember that!" The
old man gently pushed West away, and all hatless
and slippered as he was, ran back muttering
to his den, leaving the object of his mysterious
generosity fixed like a statue of amazement in
the centre of the pavement.</p>

<p>About three months had elapsed, when Bernard
West once more knocked at the door of the
money-lender.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Brace at home?" he inquired, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you please, sir, they buried him
yesterday," replied the servant, with a look of
curiously-affected solemnity.</p>

<p>"Buried him!" cried the visitor, with sincere
disappointment and grief in his tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; perhaps you would like to see
Miss Brace, if it's any thing very particular?"</p>

<p>"I should, indeed," said West; "and when
she knows the cause of my visit, I think she
will excuse the intrusion."</p>

<p>The servant gave an odd look, whose significance
West was unable to divine, as she led
the way to her young mistress's drawing-room.</p>

<p>West entered timidly, for he doubted the
delicacy of such a proceeding, though his heart
was almost bursting with desire of expansion
under the shock just received. A beautiful and
proud-looking girl of nineteen or twenty years
rose to meet him. Her large blue eyes, which
bore traces of many and recent tears, worked
strangely upon his feelings, already sufficiently
excited.</p>

<p>"I came," he said, in his deep musical voice,
"to repay a noble service. Will you permit me
to share a grief for the loss of one to whom I
owe my life&mdash;yes, more than my life!" West
paused, and strove vainly to master the emotion
which checked his utterance.</p>

<p>"My father rendered you a service?" said the
young lady, eagerly, regarding with involuntary
interest the noble countenance of Bernard, which,
though it still bore traces of great suffering, was
no longer wild and haggard, as at his interview
with the money-lender.</p>

<p>"A most unexpected and generous service,"
replied West, who, softening down the first portion

<!-- page 235 col 1 -->

of the scene we have described, proceeded
to recount to the fair orphan the narrative of the
great crisis in his destiny.</p>

<p>"I knew it was so!" cried the young lady,
almost hysterically affected; "I knew he was
not so grasping&mdash;so hard-hearted, as they said&mdash;as
he himself pretended. I knew he had a
generous heart beneath all his seeming avarice!
Oh, you are not the only one doubtless whom he
has thus served!"</p>

<p>West did not discourage the illusion. Nay,
the enthusiasm of the charming woman before
him was contagious. "Thanks to your father's
disinterested liberality," he resumed, "I am now
in comparatively prosperous circumstances. I
came not merely to discharge a debt; believe
me, it is no common gratitude I feel! Doubtless
you inherit all your father's wealth&mdash;doubtless
it is but little service I can ever hope to
render you. Yet I venture to entreat you never
to forget that you possess one friend of absolute
devotion, ready at all times to sacrifice himself
in every way to your wishes and to your happiness."</p>

<p>West paused abruptly, for the singular expression
of the young lady's features filled him
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You do not know, then&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"That I&mdash;am a&mdash;a natural child!" she completed,
with a crimson blush, turning away her
head as she spoke, and covering her face with
her hands&mdash;"that I am without fortune or relations;
that my father died intestate; that the
heir-at-law, who lives abroad, and without
whose permission nothing can be done&mdash;moreover,
who is said to be a heartless spendthrift&mdash;will
take all my father leaves; that I have but
one more week given me to vacate this house by
the landlord; in short, that I must work if I
would not starve: that, in a word, I am a beggar!"
And the poor girl sobbed convulsively;
while Bernard West, on whom this speech acted
as some terrible hurricane upon the trees of a
tropical forest, tearing up, as it were, by the
roots, all the terrible stoicism of his nature, and
rousing hopes and dreams which he had long
banished to the deepest and most hopeless
abysses of his soul; while Bernard, we repeat,
ventured to take her hand in his own, and calm
her painful agitation by such suggestions as immediately
occurred to his mind.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he said, "my dear Miss
Brace, I come to repay to you your father's
generous gift."</p>

<p>"It belongs to his legal heirs. I can not
receive it with honor," said the money-lender's
daughter, firmly.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied West, gravely: "it was a
free gift to me. I repay it by a natural, not a
legal obligation;" and he laid the two twenty-pound 
notes upon the table. "Next," he resumed,
"I have to pay a debt of gratitude. I
owe my life to your father. Thus in a manner
I have become his adopted son. Thus," he
continued impetuously, "I have a right to say

<!-- page 235 col 2 -->

to you, regard me as a brother; share the produce
of my labor; render me happy in the
thought that I am serving the child of my benefactor!
To disdain my gratitude would be a
cruel insult."</p>

<p>"I can not disdain it!" exclaimed the daughter
of the usurer with a sudden impulse of that
sublime confidence which a noble and generous
soul can alone inspire. "Yes&mdash;I accept your
assistance!"</p>

<p>The face of Bernard brightened up, as if by
an electric agent. But how were the two children
of sorrow confounded by the discovery that
they were no longer alone, and that their conversation
had been overheard by an utter stranger,
who, leaning against the wall at the further end
of the room, near the door, appeared to survey
them with an utter indifference to the propriety
of such behavior!</p>

<p>He was a man of between forty and fifty
years; a great beard and mustache concealed
the lower part of a swarthy but handsome
countenance of rare dignity and severity of outline.
His dress was utterly un-English. A vast
mantle, with a hood, fell nearly to the ground,
and he wore huge courier's boots, which were
still splashed, as if from a journey. His great
dark eyes rested with an expression of royal
benevolence upon the two young people, toward
whom he had advanced with a courteous inclination,
that, as if magnetically, repressed Bernard's
first indignant impulse.</p>

<p>"I am the heir-at-law," he said, in a mild
voice, as if he had been announcing a most
agreeable piece of intelligence.</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said Bernard, "I trust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trust absolutely!" interrupted quickly the
foreign-looking heir. "My children, do you
know who I am? No? I will tell you. I am
a monster, who in his youth preferred beauty to
ambition, and glory to gold. For ten years after
attaining manhood I struggled on, an outcast
from my family, in poverty and humiliation,
without friends, and often without bread. At
the end of five more years I was a great man,
and those who had neglected, and starved, and
scorned me, came to bow down and worship.
But the beauty I had adored was dust, and the
fire of youthful hope quenched in the bitter
waters of science. For ten years since I have
wandered over the earth. I am rich; I may
say my wealth is boundless; for I have but to
shake a few fancies from this brain, to trace a
few ciphers with this hand, and they become
gold at my command. Yet, mark my words,
my children! One look of love is, in my esteem,
worth more than all the applause of an age, or
all the wealth of an empire!" The dark stranger
paused for an instant, as if in meditation, then
abruptly continued: "<i>I</i> take your inheritance,
fair child!&mdash;<i>I</i> rob the orphan and the fatherless!"&mdash;and
the smile of disdainful pride which
followed these words said more than whole piles
of parchment renunciations as to his intention.</p>

<p>Involuntarily the orphan and Bernard seized
each a hand of the mysterious man beside them,

<!-- page 236 col 1 -->

who, silently drawing the two hands together,
and uniting them in his own, said, gently,
"Love one another as you will, my young
friends, yet spare at times a kind thought for
the old wandering poet! Not a word! I understand
you, though you do not understand yourselves.
It is as easy to tell a fortune as to
give it."</p>

<p>And was the prophecy realized? asks a curious

<h3>THE OLD BOY.</h3>

</div>

<!-- page 149 col 1 -->

<p>EVERY man is double. He is what he
knows himself to be, and what others think
him. The two men&mdash;the outward and visible,
and the inward and invisible man&mdash;are
often very different sort of people.</p>

<p>Perhaps this thesis was never more forcibly
illustrated than in my own case. I had
the misfortune, when scarcely fifteen years of
age, to dream a most rare and ominous
dream. So distinct was the vision in all its
details, that it rather resembled a visit to
another world, or a <i>clairvoyant</i> projection
of the soul into the future, than an ordinary
dream. Its most astounding peculiarity
was its apparent duration. Every body almost
is familiar with the fact, that in a
dream a few moments are often so prodigiously
crowded with images and sensations
that they appear as many hours. But I
doubt whether there are many dreamers
living who can boast of having condensed
ten years of life into a single night. Such,
however, was precisely my case. I awoke
ten years older in mind than when I fell
asleep the night before. I awoke with a
distinct remembrance of ten years of active
experience. I had the clearest recollection
of thoughts and events during the whole
period. During these ten years of dream-life,
I had left school, studied at a university,
travelled, loved, fought, and written works
which had obtained for me a great literary
reputation. In a word, I had become a
great and distinguished man, accustomed to
receive the consideration due to my position.
I had possessed fortune, power, a host of
admirers, and, above all, the consciousness of
power and manhood. I awoke a mere child
in the eyes of the world; a delusive phenomenon,
an anachronism, a living paradox;
a schoolboy ten years older than himself;
an experienced man ten years younger than
his ideas.</p>

<p>At first I could scarcely realize the absurd
fact of my youth. I was inclined to take
truth for vision, and vision for truth. But
finding myself soon driven to fall back on
metaphysics, and on such notions as that
life is itself a dream, and that ideas and

<!-- page 149 col 2 -->

events differ only in a trifling degree, I
thought it wisest to avoid becoming insane
by taking a more practical view of my position.
I certainly had dreamed myself into
a most unboyish state of intellect and feelings.
I as certainly had awakened to a
most un-manlike appearance of juvenility,
and a most inconsistent state of boyish
thraldom. I was at an English boarding-school&mdash;the
Rev. Doctor Whopham's classical
academy! What a ridiculous misfortune
for the author of books, the politician,
the man of the world, of my dream-memory!</p>

<p>I was just revolving these contradictions in
my mind when the school-bell rang for the
boys to get up. It was six o'clock in the
morning. For the last five or six years of
my life (in the infernal dream) I had been
accustomed to lie in bed in the morning
and muse on the composition of my works.
On the present occasion I continued to ponder
lazily over my mysterious vision, when
I was suddenly roused from my reverie by
one of the boys in the room calling out in
a shrill tone:</p>

<p>"Hollo! Darkman, do you mean to get
up to-day, or wait till to-morrow?"</p>

<p>At the same moment another of the boys
thought it a capital joke to throw a bolster
at me, which, descending precisely on my
face, for the moment half smothered me,
and so irritated my temper in the anomalous
condition of my mind, that forgetting
my boyhood for the nonce, I sprang out of
bed, seized the offender roughly by the
shoulder, and administered a couple of boxes
on the ear, with such lusty good-will, that the
whole room rung with their vibration.</p>

<p>"Take that, you insolent young monkey!"
I cried in a stern, contemptuous tone, which
amazed the offender, who was as nearly of
my own size and age as might be.</p>

<p>"I say," retorted the boy angrily, "none
of that girl's play with me; if you please,
come on and fight like a man, if you can!"
and the boy doubled his fists and threw
himself into a very orthodox pugilistic attitude.</p>

<!-- page 150 col 1 -->

<p>This brought me to my senses, and recalled
me to a consciousness of my absurd
position. However, there was, of course, no
retreat, and I prepared for the inevitable
contest. He had told me to fight like a
man. Little did he imagine how much of
a man I was. Ten years of adventures had
given me a self-possession and courage very
different from the mere effervescence of boyish
audacity. Confidence is strength. I
looked upon my antagonist as a child. My
manly pride almost disdained such an enemy.
He had scarcely returned my blow
when I assailed him with such decisive resolution,
that in a few moments he was grovelling
on the floor at my feet, bleeding and
vanquished.</p>

<p>The other boys applauded me admiringly,
as I strode scornfully back to my bed-side
and began to dress in silence.</p>

<p>It was the first time they had witnessed
any thing of the kind on my part. Though
not by any means weak or small for my
age, I was of an extremely effeminate appearance.
My complexion was singularly
fair and delicate; my hair soft, light, and
wavy; whilst previous to the change wrought
in my character by the dream, I had been
remarkable for the gentleness of my manners,
and though not timid, had always a
voided quarrelling and fighting as much as
possible. But now I had acquired all the stern
combativeness which ten years of arduous
struggles rarely fail to impart to the human
disposition. Accordingly, when on descending
to the school-room Dr. Whopham severely
reprimanded me for my violence, I
showed no manner of contrition for the offense,
but looked coldly and indifferently at
the Doctor, who in my eyes was now no
more than a vulgar pedagogue, very much
my inferior in acquirements and talents.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, sir?" said the Doctor; "I
say that I will make an example of you."</p>

<p>"You had better not," said I sarcastically,
thinking of a repartee I had made to Washington
Irving a year or two before, (in the
dream;) "I should make a bad example to
a certainty."</p>

<p>"You shall be flogged, sir," said the Doctor,
losing all patience. "By G&mdash;&mdash;, I'll
not be bearded by any boy in my school.
I will flog you this very day."</p>

<p>"I think you will not, sir," said I with
affected politeness.</p>

<p>"Why not," thundered Whopham, growing

<!-- page 150 col 2 -->

purple in the face with rage, "you poisonous
young viper?"</p>

<p>"Because if you attempted such a thing,
or effected it by force, I would infallibly kill
you."</p>

<p>"Kill me!" cried the Doctor; "the young
wretch, the unprincipled, immoral young
monster&mdash;he threatens to murder me!"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you lay hands upon me, I do,"
was my deliberate answer.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with the boy?"
said the head usher, coming up; "is he mad?
He used to be the most peaceable and
gentle boy in the whole school, and look at
him now; his face is like a Satan's."</p>

<p>"Wicked, but angelic," said I, laughing.
"Mr. Polyglot, I thank you for the compliment."</p>

<p>"Does the devil possess the boy?" exclaimed
Dr. Whopham, looking at my erect
attitude of defiance with a mysterious feeling
of dismay, and perhaps imagining that
I relied upon the rank of my relatives, who
were of wealth and distinction, to bear me
out in my rebellious conduct.</p>

<p>"Hark you, you couple of old fools!" said
I, with an indescribable pleasure in their
utter confusion, "we have had enough of
this. I meant to run away, but perhaps
you may as well expel me. At all hazards,
here we part; so good bye for ever. Boys,
good bye!"</p>

<p>As I spoke, I made a dash at the nearest
school-room window, which was open to admit
the fresh air, vaulted over the window-sill,
and manfully took to my heels. In a
few hours I had distanced all my pursuers,
for I was the best runner at the school, and
I did not spare my legs. For several days
after I could scarcely walk. Meanwhile I
had taken the rail to London. I was safe.
I was free. I was to all intents and purposes
the man of my dream, without his
position, his fortune, or his fame; at least,
so I fondly fancied. And now what was to
be my course? At all hazards, I was resolved
not to return to my relations. How
could I explain to them the change that
had taken place in my being? They would
have confined me as a lunatic, or sent me
back to school as a culprit. My first resolution,
then, was to preserve my personal
liberty at all costs. Any thing was better
than the slavery of a school-life&mdash;even starvation;
but that I did not apprehend. I
had a gold watch of which I could nearly

<!-- page 151 col 1 -->

guess the value. I raised ten pounds (fifty
dollars) upon it the next day. Half that
sum, judiciously invested, supplied me with
clothes suitable to the appearance of a man
several years older than myself, which I had
resolved to assume. A pair of spectacles
fitted with green glasses, a stiff cravat and
shirt collar, and a rather clerical suit of black,
were my whole means of disguise. Being
nearly as tall as the average run of men,
I was thus enabled to conceal my extreme
youth, and to enter upon the career which I
had proposed to myself as the source of my
future income. This career was literature.
Nor need it be wondered at that I adopted
the pursuit which, in my dream-life, I had
already carried to such a successful issue.</p>

<p>In a few days, by assiduous labor, I had
dashed off one of those strange, wild, improbable,
plausible, and supernaturally interesting
stories of which the literature of all
nations scarcely furnishes a dozen examples.
I knew, however, by my old dream experience,
what a new aspirant for literary fame
had to expect from publishers. I also knew
how to deal with this despicable race of
moral Jews, who discount thought and devour
the mental wealth of genius precisely
as their prototypes eat up the fortunes of
the members of rich and noble families.
Accordingly, I took excellent precautions
against their ignorance on the one hand,
and their impertinence on the other. I introduced
myself to the firm of Grey, Brown,
Yellowboy &amp; Co. as the private secretary of
a young gentleman of fortune, who indulged
in literary ambition. I spoke with sincere
admiration of my own genius, that is, of my
imaginary master's; finally, I presented the
MS. of my story as a work which had been
produced under the most singular auspices.
It was, in fact, I said, a translation and completion
of a fragment never printed, which
the illustrious <i>Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann</i>
had left behind him, and which, by incredible
labor, my young employer had succeeded
in deciphering and translating.</p>

<p>The publisher was extremely anxious to
see the author, whom I did not forget to
make the cousin of a Duke, and a man of
noble name and family. But I told him
that, until after the publication of the work,
such an interview would be impossible, as
Mr. Percy Egremont (my supposed master)
had even then started for Rome on a secret
mission from the home government. The

<!-- page 151 col 2 -->

publisher, who could not penetrate my grave
demeanor and green spectacles, treated me
with distinguished politeness&mdash;not the less
that I alluded to my own prospects of a
diplomatic career under the patronage of
Mr. Egremont. He purchased the copyright
of the work; and had good cause to
rejoice in his speculation, for it ran through
five editions in the space of as many months,
and I found myself both famous and, comparatively
speaking, rich. The publisher
happened to be one of the most honest of
his tribe, and I had received for each edition
of my little book&mdash;which, by the way, was
expensively printed and illustrated&mdash;the sum
of thirty guineas, in all one hundred and
fifty, or about eight hundred dollars. Thus
I had achieved at a bound what, in my
dream, and too often in the real lives of
authors of the highest merit, was the result
only of years of toil and drudgery&mdash;a position.
I had a name, and the command of
a publisher. I could draw money in advance,
if I required it, on my mere promise
of an unwritten book. At fifteen years of
age I was one of the happy few whom success
stamps with the mark of the most exclusive
of all nobilities, acknowledged superiority.
But I had the memory of ten years
of battle in my heart. In secret I felt all
the sadness which poets are prone to who
weep the miseries of humanity&mdash;all the
weariness of life which a varied experience
of its pleasures and its cares produces in the
mind of the earnest thinker. Meanwhile
other sensations natural to my age, and stimulated
by my unnatural extension of experience,
began to exercise an empire over my
soul which neither reason nor prudence
could contend against. The beauty of fair
and gentle women haunted my dreams.
The melody of angel voices, heard in poetic
reveries, resolved themselves into the musical
accents of silken-haired and blue-eyed
girls. I had slid imperceptibly into society
through the agency of my publisher and the
literary men to whom he had introduced
me, since, on the undeniable success of my
book, I had laughingly thrown off my mask
and declared myself to be Percy Egremont
in person.</p>

<p>And, as Percy Egremont, I was every
where welcome. My extreme youth&mdash;for,
though none suspected my real age, I could
not be supposed to be more than nineteen
or twenty at the very farthest&mdash;my fame

<!-- page 152 col 1 -->

echoed by every newspaper and review
throughout the kingdom, my girlish face
and gentle manners, all contributed to
make me a sort of general pet lion. Even
my brother authors loved and spoke well of
me. How could they suspect, beneath my
effeminate aspect, the iron will and hardened
heart of a man practised in all the wiles and
stratagems, inured to all the tempests and
convulsions of a worldly and insatiable ambition!</p>

<p>If, with all this, I felt at times that my
life was after all a sort of protracted imposture,
a kind of sublimely methodical madness,
what mattered? I was the last person
in the world to underrate the value of a
dream. So I dreamed on, and took no
thought for the morrow.</p>

<p>I had made the acquaintance, amongst
other young men of literary tastes, of Lord
Arthur Carisbrook, and by him had been
introduced to his mother, the dowager Lady
Carisbrook, and his sister, Lady Rosina, a
girl of eighteen, who had just been presented
at Court, and was in all probability destined
to be the recognized beauty of the season.</p>

<p>The moment her dark-blue, languishing
eyes fell upon me, a flood of new-born vitality
streamed through my frame. My chest
seemed to expand, every fibre of my body
to dilate with an ecstatic sensation of power.
I felt myself a man indeed, and capable of
contending with men. But, alas! I was
still at least ten years older than I looked!</p>

<p>"What a pretty boy!" I overheard the
Countess say to her son as I turned to speak
to Rosina.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," replied the young Lord,
"you would hardly imagine that he was the
author of 'Nairad.' "</p>

<p>"Why, dress him in Rosina's clothes,"
said the Countess, "and he would look
more girlish than your sister."</p>

<p>I bit my lips with vexation. But the
expression of Rosina's eyes, which, as she
was tall, were precisely on a level with my
own, soon distracted my thoughts from this
mortifying remark. Rosina was, in truth, a
girl worthy of a poet's love. She was full
of animation, yet free from coquetry; she appreciated
art, she enjoyed nature, she adored
beauty. She had only one fault&mdash;an intense
fear of ridicule. She had a soul brave
and lofty enough to have defied menace,
and dared persecution; but her courage faded
before a sarcasm; a sneer descended

<!-- page 152 col 2 -->

on her resolutions like a blight upon the
nectarines. This peculiarity of her character
I discovered at our first interview, thanks to
my supernatural knowledge of the intricacies
of human fancies and motives.</p>

<p>At the same time, I conceived for her one
of those insane, unspeakable, delicious passions
which can only come into existence
under rare and extraordinary circumstances.
Such passions know no middle path; they
bring with them either supreme happiness
or intolerable misery. In my case, it required
the most careful policy and perfect
self-restraint, to give even the hope of a
happy result. I do not allude to social
difficulties. The love of Rosina secured, an
elopement was a cardinal remedy for all
such obstacles. But to be loved, and loved
as madly as I myself loved, by Rosina, it
was absolutely necessary that I should avoid
ridicule. My weak point was my youth.
Feeling that any affectation of disguising it
would only render me absurd, I resolved,
with the policy of a true politician, to annihilate
its weakness by making it a tower of
strength. Accordingly I assumed the part
of a gay, careless boy-poet. I made no pretense
to the dignity of maturity. I took
liberties with every body, and allowed every
body to treat me as a precocious youth, who
had no idea of appearing otherwise than he
was. Lady Carisbrook took a great liking
to me&mdash;she little thought what exquisite
art I had employed to ingratiate myself&mdash;and
I was invited to join a large party of
fashionable people at her country mansion.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion, that I hoped to
bring my schemings to a happy climax.
By my boyish vivacity and unassuming
manners, I acquired the affections of nearly
all the guests assembled. My subtle jests
passed for random flashes of humor. Sayings,
which Talleyrand might have been
proud of, were repeated as happy blunders of a
prattling youth. My authorship of "Nairad,"
which might have opened the eyes of any
one of ordinary perspicacity, was for the
time forgotten. It was only when alone
with Rosina, that my tone and manner underwent
a total transformation. To her, I
discoursed naturally and freely, with all the
gravity of a philosopher, and enthusiasm of
an ambitious genius. For her ear I reserved
the stores of my mysteriously acquired
knowledge, all the wonders of my
daring projects and aspirations. I made her

<!-- page 153 col 1 -->

my confidant and friend. I never said a
word of love. I even forced myself to look
at her without betraying my passion. I
had but one object&mdash;to teach her to respect
me. In the presence of third parties I
avoided showing even the most shadowy
indication of the love that consumed my
soul. Thus I escaped the ridicule of rival
suitors, the odious comparison with their
robust forms and whiskered faces; thus, in
short, I convinced Rosina of my superiority,
before she had even dreamed of comparing
me with others.</p>

<p>All went well. My policy was triumphant,
and at length the crisis was brought
on, which was either to establish my complete
success, or utter failure.</p>

"How is it," said Rosina, as we stood
talking, before dinner, in a conservatory of
exotic plants, to which we had retreated
from an instinctive wish to enjoy one another's
society undisturbed&mdash;"How is it,
Percy, that you are so different when alone
with me, from what you are in company?"</p>

<p>"It is because, my dear Lady Rosina, the
mass of mankind are not worth talking
sense to, as they are barely capable of understanding
nonsense. Besides, I am a
mere boy, comparatively speaking, and it
would be bad taste to show myself wiser or
cleverer than older people. I have also the
misfortune to look much younger even than
I am; my face is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More like a pretty girl's than a man's,"
said Rosina, laughing, with a wickedly
puzzling expression.</p>

I did not blush, as I should probably
have done, had any one else said the same
thing. It was not the wounded vanity of a
child, it was the baffled passion of a man,
that caused me to turn pale, to feel my
knees almost sink beneath me, and to contract
my brows with an expression of pain
that no self-command could conceal.</p>

<p>But my agony was of brief duration.
Rosina took my hand in hers, and pressing
it in a way that caused me the most delicious
thrill of enjoyment, said, in a very
different tone, and with a look that penetrated
through all my artificial panoply:
"Percy, I think Alcibiades, at your age,
must have been what you are now, a combination
of the beauty of a woman and the
soul of a hero!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had Rosina uttered these perilously
flattering words, than I had clasped

<!-- page 153 col 2 -->

her lovely form to my heart in an embrace
of frantic delight, and pressed upon her
lips a kiss that caused me to turn faint with
rapture. In another instant I was at her feet.
I looked up. She was trembling from head
to foot. Her eyes were swimming in tears.
She said nothing, she raised me gently; one
more passionate embrace, and at the sound
of the dinner bell, we hastened to put on an
indifferent aspect, and join the assembled
guests in the drawing-room.
Henceforward our eyes might have served us as telegraphs.</p>

<p>And now, laugh who will at what follows.
Years of peril, vicissitude, and wild
adventure lie between me and that hour.
I yet shudder to recall its eventful moments.
On entering the drawing-room I met face
to face a newly arrived guest. Almost
petrified with horror, I recognized&mdash;Doctor
Whopham. I saw, too, with the same
glance, that he, too, had recognized me.
Exposure was inevitable. Nevertheless I
did not lose my presence of mind. I tried
the only chance I had.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said I, shaking him by the
hand, and speaking in an under tone,
"silence!&mdash;silence at any price&mdash;at <i>any</i>
price!"</p>

<p>But the schoolmaster either would not
or could not understand me; probably the
latter, as he was a man of heavy and obtuse
intellect. He stared at me for a moment
in stupid amazement; then burst out in a
tone that was audible from one end of the
room to the other:</p>

<p>"What! you here? So I've caught you
at last, Master Darkman, have I? Your
relations have been half crazy about you.
Don't frown at me, you young villain!
Ha, ha! gentlemen and ladies, would you
believe it? this is one of my boys who ran
away, some six or seven months ago, from
my school. Well! this is a <i>dies fortunata!</i>
His relations have offered all sorts of rewards
for his recovery. Excuse me, your 
lordship, but how, in the name of Scylla
and Charybdis, did this boy come here?"</p>

<p>I did not regard the supercilious smiles
and broad grins of the faces that surrounded
me, all radiant with infernal curiosity and
enjoyment of the ridiculous scene. I turned,
crushed as I was in soul, with a proud and
calm air, towards Rosina. She was laughing&mdash;yes, laughing aloud at my hideous
discomfiture! As her eyes encountered my

<!-- page 154 col 1 -->

look of eternal reproach, she burst into a
yet more extravagant fit of laughter.</p>

<p>We were always a fierce and violent race,
we of the Darkman family. A man darkened
by a fearful crime was its legendary
founder. And now all the blackness of
Hell seemed concentrated in my heart.</p>

<p>"Dog!&mdash;idiot!" I cried savagely, "what
is the meaning of this farce&mdash;this incomprehensible
insolence? Apologize at once,
and choose other subjects for your jests in
future."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the schoolmaster.
"Oh, indeed! you call me dog and idiot,
do you? Wait till I see your father, or
till I get you back to school, and have you
flogged as you deserve. Only let me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, the coarse speaker was
interrupted in his diatribe by a blow on the
head from the pedestal of a massive bronze
lamp, which in my fury I had seized and
wielded as if it had been a mere bamboo
cane. Amid a general cry of horror, the
Doctor fell senseless to the ground, and a
stream of blood from his fractured skull began
to form an ominous pool upon the
carpet. I was only restrained from repeating
the blow by the united efforts of the
bystanders.</p>

<p>The next day I awoke in the county
gaol.</p>

<p>Some weeks elapsed. The schoolmaster
did not die. He only became a lunatic,
which, to a man who was born a fool, was
perhaps no great misfortune. I myself was
liberated, on the ground of temporary insanity,
which my incoherent ravings in the
delirium of a fever that had supervened on
the last-named events not a little encouraged.
Pale, wasted, and broken-spirited, I, some
months later, being on a visit to an aunt in
London, ventured to knock at Lord Carisbrook's
door. My former friend received
me, to my amazement, with more than his
usual cordiality.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared," said I, "to hear a

<!-- page 154 col 2 -->

story which vulgar minds would call incredible?"</p>

<p>"I assure you that I am burning with curiosity
to hear the explanation of your mystery."</p>

<p>I told him all&mdash;even to my interview
with his sister, and her terrible laughter.</p>

<p>"And now," said he, "I will tell you
something, since it appears after all that you
are a man of an honorable family. Rosina
did not join in the brutal laugh at your
misfortune. She loved you too well, to take
a pleasure in your ridicule."</p>

<p>"How, you would persuade me to disbelieve
my senses?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but if you would save Rosina
another <i>fit of hysterics</i>, you will leave me
and join her in the next room."</p>

<p>In another instant my future bride was in
my arms. To real love its object can never
be ridiculous. Two years later the marriage
of the only son of Sir Lionel Darkman
to Lady Rosina Carisbrook was announced
in the papers.</p>

<p>And strange to say, the memory of that
dream never faded, but remained, as it were,
an integral part of my life. When other
subjects failed us, it was a constant resource
for conversation; and Rosina, smoothing my
hair with her white hand, would say, gently
smiling, "Now tell me some of your adventures
in dream-land."</p>

<p>And when ten years were elapsed, the
two memories, of the visioned and the real
life, remained strangely distinct; and I perceived
that the latter was, indeed, but a
continuation of the former. Indeed, Rosina
often whispered&mdash;what my own vanity
would have scarcely ventured to suggest&mdash;that
I had become at last a greater man
even than the man of my vision. Perhaps
this flattering fancy was but a dream, like
the other. At any rate, I doubt whether I
shall ever dream again half so pleasantly!</p>

<p>Thus I owe my fame, my bride, and my
happiness to a dream.</p>

<div class="center" id="ss03">

<h3>NATIONAL HUMOR.</h3>

<p>A FRAGMENT.</p>

</div>

<!-- page 300 col 1 -->

<p>LET us commence, like a respectable
Sphinx as we are, by a riddle. What is
humor? Do you give it up? It is the
meeting of two opposite ideas from which a
third is evolved, as in the concussion of the
two flints which blew up Baron Munchausen's
bear. Humor is the music of discords,
just as poetry is the echo of harmony. The
difference between them is, between being
tickled, and being caressed or sympathized
with. Humor is the point in which pain
and pleasure meeting produce a third
element, which strangely partakes of the
nature of both. It is a sort of voluptuous
torture, like being pinched in the arm by a
pretty girl. Hence, some humor makes us
cry, and some makes us laugh, according to
the quantities in which the radical elements
are mixed. Less prettiness and harder
pinching, or less pinch and more prettiness,
is the question. Humor is the identity of
contraries, like every thing in Hegel's metaphysics.
In fact, humor is so essentially
subtle and mysterious a matter that it would
seem to be extremely difficult to describe,
or, in the language of modest authors who
are apt to confound their own stupidity
with the universe, <i>indescribable</i>. It is precisely
for that reason that we have so minutely
described it.</p>

<p>But, in case one description be considered
unsatisfactory, we will give the opinions of
the seven wisest men we know&mdash;<i>the</i> seven
wise men of America&mdash;on the subject.</p>

<p>It being proposed over a bottle of champagne
to define the nature of humor&mdash;</p>

<p>"Humor," said Twanky, "is a knife, of
which the handle is smooth and the point
sharp."</p>

<p>"Humor," said Cranky, "is a sort of red
pepper, which burns while it pleases the
palate."</p>

<p>"Humor," said Spanky, "is the smile of
a coquette, which has a double meaning, like
the esoteric and exoteric philosophies."</p>

<p>"Humor," said Lanky, "is candied ill-temper."</p>

<!-- page 300 col 2 -->

<p>"Humor," said Panky, "is good-nature
in pickle."</p>

<p>"Humor," said Yanky, "is impossibility
made easy."</p>

<p>"Humor," said Zanky, "is a mint julep
in which bitter and sweet are so exquisitely
blended, that it is impossible to distinguish
where one leaves off, or the other begins."</p>

<p>Hobbes, as is well known, attributed
laughter, which is the outward development
of a humorous idea, to a sense of exulting
superiority, and even pleasure in the pain of
another. But this crude theory needs no
examination. It is evident that in the
majority of cases which provoke our laughter,
there is no room whatever for such a
feeling. Our own line of explanation is far
more consistent with facts. The enjoyment
of humor is indeed akin to eating a cucumber
with vinegar and pepper, or an acidulous
fruit-pie with sugar. Contrast, and contrast
only, is the radical element of humor.</p>

<p>The poet delights in resemblances, the
humorist in discrepancies. Humor is poetry
topsy turvy.</p>

<p>Not long since, some droll fellow, to whom
pen and ink were unluckily accessible, deliberately
asserted that poetry was a disease&mdash;like
scrofula.</p>

<p>Now, so far from this being the case,
poetry is the acme of health. It is the
overflow of moral and corporeal redundancy
of strength. All great poets have been men
remarkable for their physical beauty and
perfection. For example, Shakspeare, Goethe,
Dante, Petrarch, Milton, Byron, (who swam
the Hellespont, notwithstanding his defect in
the foot,) Lamartine, Tennyson, etc. Where
will you find such a collection of faces and
forms as these? Each of them have, in
their own time and country, been celebrated
for their majestic stature, or personal beauty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have our doubts
about humor. We suspect that, uncombined
with poetry, of which it is the engine
reversed, whence all poets are humorists,
though all humorists are certainly not poets,

<!-- page 301 col 1 -->

it is at least a mental malady. We fear that
your regular humorists are mostly queer-looking
fellows, apt to be dwarfish and
wrinkled, with sharp noses, and a diabolical
sort of grin, with small piercing eyes, and
thin wicked mouths. We know many of
this stamp, and, notwithstanding our own
sacred character as philosopher and poet,
cannot help feeling an odd creeping of the
flesh in their presence. We draw our prophet's
mantle uncomfortably tight about us,
and catch ourselves calculating the chances
of their hitting the well-known holes in our
garment with the arrows of their unscrupulous
sarcasm. An unreversible, that is, an
unpoetical humorist is an imperfect creature,
a sort of madman or devil-possessed demoniac.</p>

<p>We never felt ourselves a match for one
of these human goblins. Their incessant
sharp-shooting, their shower of insignificant
hits, and adroit turns and paradoxes, is quite
dazzling and confusing. A man, whose
mind is cast in the mould of reason and love
of truth, will ever be "bothered" in a contest
with such antagonists. The true healthful
man is afraid of his own strength; he
cannot return the little rattle of taps and
flips, from fear of striking one blow that
may be mortal&mdash;at least to the temper of
his opponent. Habitual banterers are terribly
sensitive in their own persons.</p>

<p>Humor, then, is, in the abstract, to poetry
and art, what fungi, weeds and wild berries
are to the oaks of the forest, and the fruits
of the orchard, and the flowers of the pleasure
garden. Every land has its own weeds,
fungi, and wild berries, and every nation
its own peculiar humor. It is our wish to describe
the special character of humor belonging
to a few of the more important nationalities.
For the present, lest our task should
prove endless, like the Indian serpent which
encircles the universe, we will confine ourselves
to England, France, Germany, and
America, the living representatives of progress.
They will furnish us with ample
stuff for analytical comparison. So, as when
in Southey's "Devil's Walk," the Czar of
all the hells exclaims:</p>

<p class="small">"Here's heads for England, tails for France;<br/>

He tost, and heads it came;"</p>

<p>we, not being desirous of imitating
the devil's example, will take care in tossing that
tails shall turn up, and, accordingly, as the

<!-- page 301 col 2 -->

spectral army of Napoleon cried in the song,
"France is our watchword."</p>

<p>We will begin with the humor of France,
of beautiful France, the land of Rabelais
and Moli&egrave;re, of Rochefoucauld and Talleyrand,
of Paul de Kock and the Charivari.
How the old jests and repartees rise up
before us, at the thought, like the grinning
skulls of departed boon companions&mdash;the
Yoricks of our youthful days of frolic! We
are in Paris; we jostle brother dandies on
the gay, crowded, dusty Boulevards; we
lounge in caf&eacute;s whose walls are mirrors of
interminable reflection, on sofas of everlasting
red velvet; we sip eternal coffee from white
cups, on infinite marble tables; and newspapers
without end, affixed to inevitable
mahogany sticks, are spread before us by
gar&ccedil;ons in white jackets, numerous as the
poet's</p>

<p class="small">"Horsemen, like the sand<br/>

On ocean's shores, uncounted,"</p>

<p>whose devotion to our individual happiness,
so far as the resources of Parisian caf&eacute;s go,
appears to be of a most perennial and inexhaustible
nature.</p>

<p>Once more we walk the arcades of the
lively, glittering <i>Palais Royal</i>&mdash;Palais <i>National</i>,
we mean, if any thing be now
<i>national</i> in France, save humor; we pause
and stare into the curiosity shop, where
there is the dear old fan, made of hummingbirds'
feathers, as some think, others say floss
silk; and the candelabra man, who stands
on his brazen head, like the Colossus of
Rhodes upside down, with a socket for a
candle in each of his brazen legs, thus illustrating
the fable of the hungry man, <i>hollow
to his heels</i>, of our youthful reminiscences.
There, too, is the marble bust of nobody in
particular, standing on the Chinese cabinet
that never came from China, and a small
army of little bronze men and women, who
may think themselves lucky that they are
not flesh and blood instead of bronze, so
uncomfortable is their general style of attitude.
And there, also, is the set of Indian
chessmen, with real elephants and castles,
and small warriors for pawns, looking altogether
much too expensive for anybody but
an emperor to play with. We pass over the
old china, with brick-dust colored roses, and
the sticks with the heads of griffins, and
other terrible and fabulous animals, ready to
bite your hand the moment you attempt to

<!-- page 302 col 1 -->

lay hold of them. Yes, we pass over those
and many other remarkable things, and we
make our way across the Place du Carrousel,
where there is a bude light, and an arch,
stuck up out of sheer extravagance, and
precisely because it is not wanted, a most
useless and fine-gentlemanly structure!
We cross the bridge of the "Arts," or of
the "sacred fathers," it matters not to us,
and we find ourselves in the <i>Quai Voltaire</i>,
opposite the old H&ocirc;tel Voltaire, which faces
the Tuileries, and devours the substance of
foreigners with carpet-bags, who, mayhap,
deluded by its chipped and unpainted aspect,
have walked into it in search of economy,
like a mouse seeking luxurious living in a
mouse-trap. We cannot help it&mdash;we know
it is a weakness, but we cannot help looking
up at those windows on the first floor, erst
the dwelling of that lovely and most gracious
young baroness, whose only fault was
that she had run away from a monster of a
husband, and somehow, for want of papers
of some kind, could not make it quite all
right with the police, notwithstanding the
devotion of the ugly <i>femme de chambre</i> who
perjured herself black in the face&mdash;she was
very brown to begin with&mdash;as her mistress
pathetically assured us.</p>

<p>We painted the portrait of that lovely
young baroness, at least we engaged to paint
it; but it all ended in three-cornered notes,
which a friend of ours, the leader of a new
socialist school, assured us was a proof of her
liberality in politics, as the triangle is the
symbol of equality in what may be called
modern political heraldry.</p>

<p>The fact was, that when the charming
young baroness discovered that we were not
professionally portrait painters, she set us
down as rich milords in mufti, and rather
astonished our strong minds by a broad
hint at ten thousand francs a year, and a
carriage. Such are the surprises young
philosophers of adventurous temperaments
are apt to encounter at Paris!</p>

<p>We turn from the old hotel and its romantic
reminiscences to the long line of book-stalls,
or rather book-boxes, arranged for
nearly half a mile in unbroken line along
the parapet of the terrace overhanging the
Seine. An old man in a pale-blue frock,
with dark-blue patches, and a queer cap,
watches us intently. Perhaps he merely
regards us as a possible customer; perhaps
he sees something wild or Eugene Aramish in

<!-- page 302 col 2 -->

our looks. We take up a volume of Gavarni's
caricatures&mdash;a startling reminder that
we are not writing reminiscences of Paris, but
a treatise on National Humor. We return
to our muttons, or rather our muttons return
to us. Dreams! vanish!</p>

<p>Let us try, Gavarni-like, to put a few bold
touches into our cartoon. Let us say that
French humor is pre&euml;minently the humor of
the passions and feelings; that English humor
is that of the interests and of social relations,
the German of the abstract philosophical
and political idea, the Italian of the artistic
sentiment, the Spanish of the grotesque
and the fanciful, Arabian of the moral, and
American of the purely and essentially comical
intention. Having said all this, let us
admit that the distinctions are but rude,
reckless generalizations, implying a predominating,
but by no means an absorbing element.</p>

<p>And now for a few examples of French
humor. If many of our illustrations be old
or familiar, let us at least care that they be
good of their kind. It is a poor joke that
will not bear repetition, and the newspapers
of all nations take care that the axiom shall
not fall into disuse. We have known even
originations of this poor brain of ours go the
rounds of the English and American papers
in a way that amazed us. Assuredly the
man who invents a droll story or says a smart
thing, needs be in no fear of wanting readers
in this journalizing world, where even a novel
platitude is pounced on with such vulture-like
alacrity. The consumption of fun
is greater than the production. The people
demand it as a necessity of their natures,
and the will of the people should be
respected.</p>

<p>"Make way for the representatives of the
people," said somebody at the commencement
of the late French Revolution, as Lamartine
and his colleagues were proceeding
to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.</p>

<p>"Make way for the people themselves!"
retorted a body of the insurgents they encountered.</p>

<p>This reminds us of Lamartine's famous
reply to the demand for his head, raised by
some of the most violent during one of his
harangues.</p>

<p>"I wish you <i>had</i> the head of Lamartine,"
replied the poet smiling; "you would be
more patient and less bloodthirsty."</p>

<p>Talking of the poet-statesman reminds us,

<!-- page 303 col 1 -->

by antithesis, of Prince Talleyrand, who certainly
was any thing but a poet, though he
would make a very good hero of a poem for
any one witty enough to treat such a subject.
Talleyrand is one of those men whose
fame as a wit and a humorist is not to be
disputed. Such names have this remarkable
peculiarity, they become in a manner bonded
warehouses or pounds for stray witticisms and
anecdotes of unknown origin, to which they
lend a certain aureole or halo. Just as the
fifth book of Moses is popularly attributed
to that author, whose death takes place in
the course of the narrative, so are countless
jokes, good, bad, and indifferent, remorselessly
fathered upon Talleyrand, Theodore
Hook, Lord Byron, Beau Brummel, and a
few other piquant celebrities, perhaps as a
sort of reparation for the numberless examples
of their really genuine "good things"
which have passed away unrecorded with
the occasions that gave rise to them.</p>

<p>Talleyrand's <i>bons mots</i> were infinite. We
wish our memory were not the sinking fund
it is, or we would give a few of them. One
story, however, we <i>do</i> recollect, and that <i>one</i>
is eminently characteristic of the habitually
cunning and sarcastic diplomatist.</p>

<p>A lady was extremely desirous of possessing
Talleyrand's autograph. As if to prevent
the possibility of an improper use being
made of his signature, the astute minister
wrote his name <i>at the top and close to the
edge</i> of the blank sheet of paper which was
presented to him.</p>

<p>Washington Irving attributes to Goldsmith
the saying commonly given to Talleyrand,
that the use of language is to disguise
thought. The real fact is that it is one of
Rochefoucauld's maxims; and talking of
Rochefoucauld we cannot, however well
known may be the <i>mot</i>, pass over his name
without mention of his most bitter and perhaps
most brilliant stroke of humor. It is a
jest which only a ducal cynic, a fine gentleman
of the old school, or a professed satirist,
could possibly have uttered.</p>

<p>"A man must live," said somebody in extenuation
of somebody's conduct.</p>

<p>"I do not see the necessity," replied the
Duc de Rochefoucauld.</p>

<p>The French <i>Seigneur</i> has not lacked disciples.
His opinion has been adopted by
a large school of eminent suicides. Laman
Blanchard the wit, Haydon the artist, and
many others who did not see the necessity of

<!-- page 303 col 2 -->

living&mdash;in other words, who made up their
accounts summarily&mdash;found, as Byron has it,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"A deuced balance with the Devil,"</p>

</div>

and preferred death to misery.</p>

<p>It may be said that Rochefoucauld's philosophical
sarcasm had nothing to do with
these events; that the suicides in question
would have occurred had the repartee never
been uttered. Possibly; yet it is well said
that the last hair breaks down the camel.
To a hesitating resolution the last hair is
often a jest. Who knows how often Rochefoucauld
may have broken the back of a suicide's
lingering love of life by his pitiless
maxim?</p>

<p>We remember ourselves a solemn incident
which occurred some years ago, and which
tends to confirm the above position. It is
not humorous, nevertheless we will take the
liberty to interpolate it. It cannot be quite
uninteresting, for it is a fact.</p>

<p>One evening we were introduced, at the
studio of Thomas Woolner, the English sculptor
and poet, the friend of Tennyson and Carlyle,
the plastic chief of the Pre-Raphaelite
school, the delicate poet and generous friend&mdash;now
one of a party of literary and artistic
adventurers in the gold diggings of Australia&mdash;we
were, we repeat, introduced at Woolner's
studio to a tall, thin, pale, deep-eyed
man, named Ashford. He was the sculptor's
inseparable companion, and had been
named the "philosopher" on account of the
peculiar bent of his studies, which chiefly
turned on chemistry and natural science.
We observed that the "philosopher" regarded
us with peculiar interest, and that he
appeared particularly eager to lead the conversation
to the topics which were supposed
to be the special object of our labors. Soon
we were involved in a deep and still deepening
discussion of the mysteries of life and of
the destinies of the soul. Our arguments in
favor of the indestructible and eternal nature
of the individual spiritual essence were listened
to by Ashford with marked attention.
His objections were feeble, and as it were
spasmodic. He seemed to feel a strange
pleasure in allowing himself to be carried
away by our enthusiasm for "progressive
immortality." Yet, after all, he parted from
us without any apparent care for improving
the acquaintance.</p>

<p>When next we visited our friend the
sculptor, he welcomed us with a grave and

<!-- page 304 col 1 -->

sad expression. "Have you heard," said he,
"that Ashford has poisoned himself?"</p>

<p>"Poisoned himself!" we exclaimed; and
the tenor of our conversation, with our own
remarks on the nothingness of death, flashed
strongly across our memory.</p>

<p>"Yes; with prussic acid. He had, it appeared,
long contemplated the act. What
decided him I know not. He had a small
independence, just enough to keep him from
want, and yet deny him the enjoyments of
life. His finely sensual and intellectual nature
could not endure this barrenness of existence.
Life was too bleak a prospect, and he
despaired. So he thought it wisest to die."</p>

<p>We may be mistaken, but we have often
fancied that but for our meeting Ashford
might yet have lived.</p>

<p>Death is a serious thing when before our
eyes; but it is strange how distance alters
our appreciation of even the most horrible
incidents. Let us take from Balzac, the prince
of French novelists, an example of this
anomaly:</p>

<p>In the <i>P&egrave;re Goriot</i> (the King Lear of
modern life) two students are arguing the
question of <i>conscience</i>. One of them maintains,
in opposition to his friend, that interest
is the only real motive, and that the dread
of the reaction of crime upon ourselves is
the only source of moral scruples. "For
example," he says, "suppose that you possessed
at this moment the power to destroy
by a mere act of will a mandarin dwelling
in the centre of China, and that no connection
between the two events could ever possibly
be traced, and that by this operation
you could become suddenly a millionaire;
would the mandarin's life be fairly insurable?"</p>

<p>"Egad! I am at my five-and-thirtieth
mandarin already!" replies the second student
ingenuously.</p>

<p>But <i>Rabelais</i>, even when dying, would
seem to have kept death at a distance from
his fancy, for he is related to have said,
"Bring me my domino&mdash;<i>Beati sunt qui in
Domino moriuntur!</i>"</p>

<p>Our theory of contrasts is here fully carried
out. At the great exhibition of paintings
at Paris in 1851 we recall another fine instance
of this quality in humor.</p>

<p>There was a large picture exhibited, in
which some god, angel, or genius of something
or other, was driving with outspread
wings a chariot and eight fiery horses.</p>

<!-- page 304 col 2 -->

<p>"Superfluous outlay!" exclaimed Cham,
the great French caricaturist; "why keep a
carriage when you have wings?"</p>

<p>Cham is the most popular artist of the
Charivari, the best and most popular comic
journal in the world. It is written by three
men only, though it appears daily. Their
names are Taxile Delord, Louis Huart, and
Cl&eacute;ment Caraguel. They all write very
much in the same style, though perhaps
Delord is the most brilliant writer. But
their humor is inexhaustible, and on the
whole vastly superior to the coarse and
heavy buffoonery of Punch, rather impudently
called the London Charivari.</p>

<p>But the true Charivari is free from the cant
of its English imitator. Keen as is its satire,
it is not the less severe that it is clothed
in playful language and fanciful images.
Punch is a mere snob (one of themselves)
or a henpecked old Mr. Caudle, by the side
of the Charivari. It is in their illustrations
alone that any comparison is possible.</p>

<p>The way in which week after week, a year
or two ago, Louis Napoleon was ridiculed
under the disguise of reports concerning the
Emperor Soulouque, whilst the republican
party was symbolized by the character of
Cacambo, from Voltaire's Candide, was indeed
a splendid example of triumphant satire.
Yet perhaps, after all, the Charivari
is greatest in its adversity. At this present
moment, when the press of France is gagged
in every way, when the bayonet is at its
editors' throats, the Charivari still manages,
under the most ingenious disguises, and
with ever-changing metaphors, to pour forth
daily a stream of contempt and ridicule of
every act of an all-powerful government, and
is at the hour we now write the only surviving
republican journal in France! Why
M. Napoleon has not had the witty triumvirate
shot, we cannot understand. Perhaps
he affects to despise their satire. But
what politician, that can read the future, does
not see that ere long his overthrow and ruin
must furnish matter for an article and a
caricature in the two next mornings' Charivari!</p>

<p>If we turn now to the humor displayed
in French literature of a more permanent
order, we find in Moli&egrave;re, in Voltaire, and in
Le Sage the same epigrammatic style of description
and analysis. We compare their
neat, pungent hits, that go straight to the
mark as the ball of a practised rifleman,

<!-- page 305 col 1 -->

with the elaborate facetiousness of the English,
or the complicate and many-idea-made-up-of
drollery of German writers, and we
unhesitatingly give France the <i>pas</i>. The
French are the best <i>stylists</i> in the world.
And why? Because it was in France that
language first became a science, and authorship
an art, since Greece and Rome had
fallen, and with them the results of their
civilization. Possibly the best writers of
English prose have formed themselves on a
French model. And what was the model
of the French writers? Strange to say, infidels
as they were, it was the <i>Bible</i>. It is in
the works of Orientals who flourished thousands
of years ago, who wrote perchance
whilst Rome was yet a wilderness, and
Athens a petty sea-port, that the simple
and concise forms of speech are to be
found which in "Candide," or in "The Devil
on Two Sticks," delight us by their terse
clearness and delightful simplicity. Extremes
meet; the rudest and the most polished
speech is found to be the same. Voltaire's
<i>Zadig</i>, Le Sage's <i>Gil Blas</i> will be read
after many Monte Christos and Mysteries of
Paris have gone to the tombs of oblivion.</p>

<p>If the mantles of these great humorists
have fallen on any modern Frenchman, it
was on the late lamented <i>Henri de Balzac</i>,
whose collected tales, under the title of the
<i>Comedy of Human Life</i>, form a panorama of
French manners and ideas and of human
character such as but one other writer has
yet presented, and that one is Shakspeare.</p>

<p>The works of Balzac are a series of curious
studies, of a marvellous fidelity in the
artistic execution, and an exquisite distinctness
in the creative conception. His humor
is free, abundant, and varied. Yet he
throws around every subject a peculiarly
poetical charm. In one of his works (The
Great Man of the Province at Paris) he
describes the struggles of a young poet in
adversity. One chapter of this work opens
with a most enthusiastic invocation of a great
philanthropist, a friend of the unfortunate,
and a patron of letters&mdash;in a word, <i>Fricoteau!</i>
And who do you think Fricoteau
was? He was the proprietor of a cheap
<i>restaurant</i>. There did many students and
eke poets and rising Balzacs, (destroyers of
countless mandarins, not to mention tailors,)
with slender purses and large appetites, dine
royally for a franc. "But in truth," pursues
our author, (we only quote from memory,)

<!-- page 305 col 2 -->

"taking the abundance of horses and the
vast yet surviving amount of cats into consideration,
it was possible to conceive that
this great philanthropist might not only
have escaped loss, but even realized some
small profit on his viands, but for one
recklessly adopted principle of his establishment,
which sooner or later must have
insured the ruin and downfall of Fricoteau
and all his noble philanthropy. In large
letters in his window was announced, and
the announcement was no trick of trade,
but a solemn truth, <i>Pain &agrave; discr&eacute;tion</i>&mdash;bread
at discretion! That is to say, without
discretion, beyond all discretion. What
discretion, in the name of youth and hunger
and poverty, could any human being expect
from the people who dined at Fricoteau's!"</p>

<p>On this last flash of Balzackian humor,
feeling that we cannot stop all our lives in
France, or fill all our space with French matter,
we take one bound into Germany. We
are at Berlin&mdash;though we might almost
fancy ourselves still at Fricoteau's.</p>

<p>Close to the Linden, the Broadway of
Berlin, (or rather <i>three</i> Broadways abreast,)
stands or stood the Catholic church, and
behind the Catholic church, which occupies
the centre of a square, is, or was ten years
ago, when we were students of eighteen, with
less beard and more good humor, the <i>Caf&eacute;
de Prusse</i>, popularly spoken of as "Ostermann's."</p>

<p>Nobody ever insulted Ostermann by calling
<i>him</i> a philanthropist. He would have
scorned the idea. He was a big, bald-headed,
vulture-eyed old miser. He had grown rich,
and while we were at Berlin had his locale
fresh painted, an infallible sign of prosperity
in an eating-house. It betokens superfluous
capital.</p>

<p>Ostermann's customers were nearly all
students. The University building was
within a few minutes' walk, just across the
Linden, and they came straight to Ostermann's
from the lecture-rooms. It was very
convenient. The more aristocratic Caf&eacute; de
Belvidere was still nearer, and many went
there, especially the fast men, and young
"somebodies." But Ostermann's was cheaper
and more popular. Most of its patrons subscribed
by the month. For three dollars
American they received thirty tickets, each
of which represented a somewhat larger sum
on the bill of fare than its actual cost, as a
premium to subscribers. The tickets were

<!-- page 306 col 1 -->

like bank notes, payable in dinners, and
might be used at any time, transferred, sold,
or lent to any body with an appetite. We
ourselves accidentally carried away a few of
these tickets from Berlin in our pocket-book,
and having, nearly a year afterwards, forwarded
them by post to a friend, had the
satisfaction of hearing that they were duly
honored. Such was the system of dining
at Ostermann's.</p>

<p>What made us think of all this in connection
with Fricoteau's was a circumstance
that occurred to us at this very establishment.
We have said that Ostermann was
not a philanthropist. Nevertheless, like
Fricoteau, he gave "bread at discretion."
It was the custom of the country, and the
bread was only rye bread after all. One or
two cents' worth of bread was decidedly the
very utmost any man could possibly eat at
a sitting. We remember making this calculation
at the time. Thereupon, however,
turned the incident we have to relate.</p>

<p>It appeared that a poor student was in
the habit of dining at Ostermann's on the
very economical plan of ordering a basin of
soup, the charge for which was some three
cents, and consuming a most disproportionate
amount of the great "staff of life."</p>

<p>This, the miserly old restaurateur was not
slow in observing, and it so chanced that we
were dining in the Caf&eacute; de Prusse precisely
at the hour when his indignation, at what
he considered a downright swindle and imposture,
had fairly boiled over. We overheard
him say to the waiter: "I tell you, Hans,
it is a rascally fraud! Day after day he
comes here as cool as an iceberg, and eats an
<i>Erbsen-Suppe</i>, or a <i>Kartoffeln Salad</i>, or a&mdash;&mdash;yes,
there he is now, eating a <i>Pflaumen-Suppe</i>.
<i>Donner Wetter!</i> <i>Potz tausand
mal!</i>"</p>

<p>And there indeed he was, a tall, somewhat
thin young man, with a very long,
light moustache, pointed beard, and fine
curling hair. His dress was good, his linen
irreproachable, his countenance grave and
intelligent. Even as I looked at him, he
calmly broke off about a quarter of a yard
of the literally staff-like loaf which lay along
the centre of the table, and proceeded to
sop some portions of it in the plum soup
(simply plums stewed with sugar) to which
old Ostermann had so savagely alluded.</p>

<p>This was too much for the latter. He
bustled up to the table, and said in a bullying

<!-- page 306 col 2 -->

tone, "You had better dine somewhere
else in future. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We know not what else the old fellow
might have said, for the student, who, like
ourselves, had overheard the colloquy with
the waiter, arose, and with the most sublime
self-possession, dashed the whole mess of
stewed plums in the face of his assailant, and
exclaimed aloud in a tone of comic indignation:</p>

<p>"Here is an old scoundrel! he says that
I eat too much bread with my soup!"</p>

<p>At that moment we regarded the student
as a sort of hero. His courage, in boldly
facing the shameful exposure of his poverty,
appeared to us most admirable. We shouted
an enthusiastic "Bravo!" whilst, amid a
general and threatening murmur of disapproval,
the restaurateur shrunk away, wiping
his face with a napkin.</p>

<p>At this moment a friend of ours entered,
and after saluting us, shook hands warmly
with the hero of the soup adventure, who
turned out to be a very curious character.
He was a sort of German Mark Tapley in a
higher walk of life, and certainly deserved
some credit for being "jolly" under circumstances
of a remarkably discouraging nature.
Not only had he to maintain himself whilst
studying at the University, but his mother
and sister were also dependent on his exertions.
However, he was a man of decided
energy, and what with lessons and a few
odd literary jobs, including an occasional inaugural
treatise in Latin for some wealthier,
lazier, and stupider student, he managed to
make both ends&mdash;not <i>meet</i>&mdash;that was hopeless,
but come near enough, at any rate, to
be bridged over by debts, privations, and
endurance. We became very intimate, and
his inexhaustible humor was a source of continual
amusement.</p>

<p>One evening, another student, named
L&mdash;&mdash; was complaining that he had been
cheated at play by some Polish swindlers,
and that one of them had had the impudence
to dun him for a sum of twenty dollars
which he pretended to have won.</p>

<p>"Well," said the humorist G&mdash;&mdash;, "as
you are rich, L&mdash;&mdash;, you may as well pay
him; but there can be no harm in getting
the money <i>changed into farthings;</i> or stay,
as he might change them again, suppose
you put the notes between two brick-bats,
and pack them loosely; or still better, send
them by post, wrapped up in a few sheets

<!-- page 307 col 1 -->

of <i>pappendeckel</i>, (pasteboard,) so that the
postage may not be much over the amount
inclosed."</p>

<p>The last suggestion was adopted.</p>

<p>Another time G&mdash;&mdash;, after a long conversation
on animal magnetism, and its kindred
sciences, galvanism, electricity, &amp;c., gravely
informed us that he had solved the great
problem, and would immediately share with
us the secret, of <i>how to raise the dead</i>.</p>

<p>We listened in breathless expectancy.</p>

<p>"The secret is simple," said G&mdash;&mdash;, without 
moving a muscle: "<i>Carry them up
stairs</i>."</p>

<p>G&mdash;&mdash; went with us to hear Liszt, the
great pianist, who was creating at that time
an immense sensation at Berlin. In the
course of the concert G&mdash;&mdash; suddenly whispered
to us, "Did you observe?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That he struck <i>eleven</i> notes at one time
just now?"</p>

<p>"Impossible! but even if he did, what of
it?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You do not draw any inference?"</p>

<p>"No: what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That he must have struck the eleventh
note <i>with his nose!</i>"</p>

<p>It required all our power of self-restraint
to avoid an explosion, which might have
caused us, in the then state of enthusiasm
for the great musician, to have been summarily
ejected from the concert-room, if not
thrown out of window incontinently.</p>

<p>G&mdash;&mdash; had a peculiar faculty for hoaxing.
He had a dexterous way of exciting expectation
without a suspicion of the coming
absurdity. We remember once at a supper
table, his suddenly starting, slapping his forehead,
and exclaiming that he had hit upon
a plan by which any one could make a large
income without labor or capital.</p>

<p>We all awaited the revelation.</p>

<p>"In the first place, <i>steal fifty thousand
dollars</i>," began the solemn humorist.</p>

<p>He never got any further.</p>

<p>The last time we saw G&mdash;&mdash; was in London.
A number of <i>Punch</i> was on the
table, praising the Prince de Joinville for his
exertions in saving the passengers from the
wreck of the <i>Amazon</i>, and concluding by
saying that he was worthy of being a true
son of John Bull for his heroism.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said G&mdash;&mdash;, "that Joinville

<!-- page 307 col 2 -->

will change his name to <i>John Veal</i> in consequence."</p>

<p>The Germans are very fond of serenading,
and this passion was at one time carried to
such an excess in G&ouml;ttingen, that all singing
at night, except in parties of four, was forbidden
by the municipal and university
authorities. One night an unlucky student
was caught bellowing out a most uproarious
stave, and was accordingly arrested by the
watchman.</p>

<p>"Off, fellow!" said the unmelodious
Bacchanal; "can you not hear that I have <i>a
quartetto voice?</i>"</p>

<p>Goethe, in his tragedy <i>Goetz of Verlichingen</i>,
resolved to attack the pseudo-refinement
of the day, introduced in the scene
where <i>Goetz</i> is summoned to surrender his
castle a very coarse popular expression of
contempt, which was, however, expunged
from later editions.</p>

<p>The Duke of Weimar, walking with the
poet, who was also his minister, in the
streets of Frankfort, heard a carman make
use of the identical expression.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that man quoting you?"
said the Duke; "what a thing it is to be
a great poet!"</p>

<p>But Goethe, <i>the writer</i>, as Emerson calls
him, was, indeed, a humorist of the first
order. The scene between Mephistopheles
and Martha is without a rival out of Shakspeare.
We shall never forget Seidelmann's
acting as Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>Next to Goethe's Faust, Chamisso's Peter
Schlemihl, the man without a shadow, appears
to us the most strikingly humorous
work in the German language.</p>

<p>"I was travelling in the arctic regions,
and my shadow froze to an iceberg," is one
of the extraordinary excuses which Peter
Schlemihl makes for his unfortunate peculiarity.
"A rich man arrived, a bankrupt with
a very pale shadow," again says Chamisso.
This single passage proves that by the
shadow he typified a man's reputation.
The German critics, however, wrote and
disputed much on the subject, and Chamisso
was beset by entreaties to explain his allegory.
In reply, the poet was in the habit
of sending an exact scientific definition of a
shadow from the Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Heine, the German, Jew, poet, and satirist,
much resembles D'Israeli in the character of
his mind. He is the prince of exaggerators.
In one of his poems he speaks most enthusiastically

<!-- page 308 col 1 -->

of a great patron who had fed
and clothed and assisted him in every way
most munificently and generously. "It is a
pity," adds Heine, "that I cannot embrace
him, for <i>I myself am this excellent man</i>."</p>

<p>We will quote one of his shorter poems,
as we happen to have a translation "all
ready cut and dried," as the saying goes:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">AGNES.</p>

<p>"I took a reed and wrote upon the sand,<br/>

'Agnes, I love thee;'<br/>

But the wicked waves came rolling<br/>

Over the sweet confession,<br/>

And blotted it out!</p>

<p>"Fragile reed! changeable sand!<br/>

Rolling waves! I trust ye no more,<br/>

But, with mighty hand, from Norway's forests,<br/>

I tear the loftiest pine,<br/>

And dip it in the boiling crater of Mount Etna,<br/>

And, with this flame-dripping giant pen,<br/>

I write upon the azure vault of heaven,<br/>

'Agnes, I love thee!' "</p>

</div>

<p>There is nothing more extravagant than this,
even in Hoffmann or Jean Paul Friedrich
Richter, the two subtlest humorists and
most fantastic writers in the world. These
are the men on whose writings we should
love to dilate. But it would be impossible
to give the slightest idea of their style in an
article like the present. Ludwig Tieck is
also very felicitous as a humorist, and Wilhelm
Hauff much resembles Dickens in
style, being quite an exception to the general
love of his countrymen for complicated
phraseology and fantastic abstruseness.</p>

<p>If brevity be the soul of wit, the Germans
are certainly the least witty nation of
the earth. Even the French are apt to be
somewhat wordy in their humor. Your
Englishman is the true joker, the real man
for fun. But here let us pause for a while
in our illustrations.</p>

<p>We have used several words in a vague
manner, viz. wit, humor, joke, fun.</p>

<p>It here becomes necessary to fix our meaning
accurately, and to draw certain distinctions.</p>

<p>Now, despite the opinions of divers
learned pundits and punsters, we hold the
opinion that wit and humor are at bottom
the same thing, and that to say where the
one leaves off and the other begins is a vain
and useless distinction.</p>

<p>If any thing, wit may be said to be the
acme of humor, the point of the sword of
which humor is the edge. Humor is more

<!-- page 308 col 2 -->

pleasant to the mind than wit, because it is
more in harmony with the ordinary level of
the thought, whilst wit requires a certain
amount of exertion in order to appreciate
its points.</p>

<p>Strolling or lounging in the shade of trees
upon the green grass, we are disposed to be
humorous. After a champagne supper, in
the excitement of a select party of good
fellows, the inclination to wit is apt to develop
itself. Humor is a steady flame, wit an
explosive fire-work. Humor is a convenient
garment, wit a useful weapon. That which
is but humor as long as we keep it to ourselves,
may become wit if thrown at the
head of another person. Humor is the reed
as it naturally grows; wit the arrow into
which it is manufactured. Humorists are
loveable, wits formidable. It is quite possible
to be a tolerable wit with very little
humor, because it is the application, not the
raw material, that differs in the two commodities.
On the other hand, a very fine humorist
may indulge very rarely in wit, from
a natural benevolence and evenness of disposition.</p>

<p>It is not every body who could so far conquer
the natural respect for another man's
feelings as to say with Wilkes, when Lord
Thurlow exclaimed: "If I desert my king,
may God desert me!" "No, he'll see you
d&mdash;&mdash;d first."</p>

<p>We need scarcely allude to a well-known
replique of Douglas Jerrold, on meeting a
great bore, who asked him which way he
was going. "Going on," replied Jerrold,
suiting the action to the word.</p>

<p>A London writer named Reach, it seems,
pronounces his name as two syllables, thus:
Re-ack. Dining at Thackeray's one day,
the author of Vanity Fair addressed him
innocently as Reach.</p>

<p>"Re-ack, if you please," said the young
author, ("it made him <i>sick</i>," he said, "to
be called <i>Reach</i>.")</p>

<p>After a little time, Thackeray again addressed
his guest: "May I assist you to a
<i>pe-ack</i>, Mr. <i>Re-ack?</i>"</p>

<p>Some people would have hesitated at such
a personality, and might nevertheless have
been greater humorists than Mr. Thackery,
great though he be.</p>

<p>And here we are in England, our native
joke-land.</p>

<p>All hail, dark London! smoky Babylon!
vast and mysterious city, in which a traveller

<!-- page 309 col 1 -->

may wander for years and yet find new
regions to explore, new phases of human
misery or folly to study. It was in London
we made our first professional joke, first
learned that the faculty of striking a balance
between two contrasts was a marketable
property.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the publisher of the "Illustrated
Mercury," "we can only offer you
three shillings sterling (six American) per
dozen for jokes, and five shillings per dozen
for illustrated comicalities."</p>

<p>Truly, since the store-rooms of our mind
have been so tightly packed with metaphysics,
political economy, (the <i>dismal science</i>
of Carlyle,) cranks, levers, geological
coal systems, ichthyosauri, rules of perspective,
electrical, galvanic, and magnetic
phenomena, moral regenerations of mankind,
canons of art, historical reveries, and
we know not what other chaotic minglings
of heterogeneous "ideation," we (poor devils
of students that we are!) should laugh
somewhat loudly at so practical a proposition.</p>

<p>Jokes and sketches by the dozen!</p>

<p>Ideas by the gross!</p>

<p>O editor of a defunct Illustrated Mercury,
long buried in the intramural graveyard of
Anglo-metropolitan oblivion! Couldst thou
and thy paper&mdash;for the two go together in
our fancies, for ever inseparable&mdash;rise from
the dead, and offer not three English shillings,
but three Athenian talents of gold&mdash;not
far from three thousand dollars as times
go&mdash;for the same quantity of jokes, (attic,
at least, if written in the traditional garret,)
as thou didst so tersely phrase it, <i>we</i>, poor
as we are in dollars, greedy as we are of
gold, the talisman of power, should nevertheless
be reduced to a most humiliating
confession. Ichabod, Ichabod! the glory is
departed! It seems to us almost incredible
that we ever could have possessed the faculty
of making jokes by the dozen!</p>

<p>Yet, but ten years ago, to the elasticity of
brain of eighteen years, this mercurial proposition
was a sort of compact pocket Eldorado.
We had no fear of exhausting the
"diggins." To knock words about like
nine-pins or billiard balls was a mere relaxation
from heavier toils. Somehow the ideas
went with the words, or got jammed between
them by accident. It was quite a relief to
make a dozen conundrums and say, "There!
there's three shillings at any rate!" in the

<!-- page 309 col 2 -->

intervals between composing two chapters
of the "engrossing romance of supernatural
and appalling interest," which the advertisements 
announced, and of which we were, of
course, the pitiless manufacturers.</p>

<p>What a place is England for comic periodicals!
After the Illustrated Mercury had,
as the penny-a-liners say, "relapsed into that
obscurity from which it ought never to have
emerged," we ourselves started half a dozen
at moderate intervals, and were connected
as contributors with nearly half a dozen
more.</p>

<p>Oh, the humor of those humorous journals!
We do not mean the published or
exoteric, but the private or esoteric humor.
The writings were indeed mere jokes compared
to the lives of the young literary
adventurers who edited them! And where
are they now? Scattered abroad to the
four winds of heaven. Some dig gold in
Australian mines, some in Paris sustain a
wild existence by irregular contributions to
more regular periodicals, some ply pen and
pencil in the great republic, (sole land of
earth to whom poet and ploughman, patriot
and pauper, are alike welcome,) whilst
others are at length reluctantly admitted
into that older clique, of which Punch is at
once the organ and the support&mdash;Punch,
the survivor!</p>

<p>Yes, Punch has survived all its rivals.
Its publishers, strong in their wealth, have
succeeded in scattering at length the army
of the opposition. Punch stands alone&mdash;the
representative of modern British humor.
Its writers have grown rich and dull. Its
tone has become respectable and tame. It
repeats itself over and over again. It harps
upon single strings, till the string is worn
out by mere friction. As each new number
comes out, people say, "How stupid Punch
is this week!" The writers have worn themselves
out.</p>

<p><i>The writers have worn themselves out?</i>
How so? Why, then, have not the writers
of the Charivari worn themselves out? Why
did not the writers of the Spectator wear
themselves out?</p>

<p>Because the latter were and are superior
men&mdash;men of imagination. There is no
poetry in Punch. They cannot reverse their
engine&mdash;the stokers of the Punch Locomotive. 
The writers, with scarcely a partial
exception, are men of critical, not of creative,
minds. Hence they are superficial by necessity.

<!-- page 310 col 1 -->

They make the most of what they see
and hear, but they never penetrate into the
future. They are not really progressive.
<i>They evidently take up the newspapers, and
make jokes (and very bad ones of late) over
their paragraphs</i>.</p>

<p>Why, then, does Punch continue to exist?
Because there is one man of genius connected
with it, and that man is JOHN LEECH the
artist. He is a real humorist, not a dry
caricaturist, like his colleagues the writers.
There is as much exquisite beauty in some
of his female faces, as there is drollery in his
exaggerated social absurdities. He is the
man of Punch. Were he to die, Punch
would gradually sink into obscurity and
non-existence.</p>

<p>The reader will perhaps be surprised when
we assert that the writing in several of the
rivals to Punch that were started, was vastly
superior in every way to that of Punch.
The cause of their failure was not want of talent,
but <i>want of purpose</i>. They took no
hold on the sympathies of their readers, they
appealed to no class of minds or men. They
were taken up like toys, and thrown down
again. They were toys, and the prettiest
toys tire. There was only one English
writer who knew <i>what</i> was the real element
of success, and his best attempt was crushed
by the exertions of the Punch publishers
with the book-trade. His engravers were
bribed to be behind time, his posting bills
were destroyed instead of being distributed,
and deliberately false statements as to the
non-appearance of his paper were made by
wholesale houses in the pay of Messrs. Bradbury
&amp; Evans.</p>

<p>Punch, to a certain extent, is consistent.
It represents the London shop-keeper, and at
the same time the moderate aristocrat. Its
satire of classes is feeble, its attacks on individuals
unscrupulous. Twice Punch was beaten
in the open field. Once by Silk Buckingham,
the great traveller, who demonstrated
in a pamphlet that the cause of the malignant
attacks made upon the <i>British and
Foreign Institute</i>, was the fact that Mr.
Douglas Jerrold, one of the chief writers in
Punch, had been struck off the list of members
as a defaulter. Once by Alfred Bunn,
the theatrical lessee, who brought out an
exact parody on Punch, in which he literally
lashed them into silence. They had
attacked him with pitiless personality, and
done their best to ruin him, by continual

<!-- page 310 col 2 -->

repetitions of the attack. He turned round
upon them at last, and exposed their obscure
origin, the degrading pursuits in which they
had been engaged, and the bankruptcies,
&amp;c., through which they had gone. He
might have said to them, in the words of
Julia's maid to Don Alphonso, in Byron's
great humorous poem:</p>

<p>"Pray, don't you think you cut a pretty
figure?"</p>

<p>They knocked under, and Bunn's name
disappeared from their columns.</p>

<p>The defeat was as utter as that of the
young Life-Guardsman, who at a London
party satirically asked a poet who wore a
moustache, "to what service he belonged."*

<p class="small">[*It is a part of the English bible of prejudices,
that none but a military man in a horse regiment
has a right to wear hair on his upper lip.]</p>

<p>"To the great army of martyrs," replied
the poet with a yawn, languidly removing
himself from the bore's vicinity.</p>

<p>The same humorist being asked whether
he was for a monarchy or a republic, replied,
"That depends on whether I am to be king
in the monarchy; otherwise I would rather
take my chance of being chosen president of
the republic."</p>

This political repartee reminds us of a very
curious jest, which was the cause of an unhappy
leader of the Chartists, named Vernon,
(who had formerly edited a scientific journal,)
being imprisoned several years as a
common felon. Addressing the mob with
his usual fiery impetuosity, he exclaimed:
"I say, boys, that quill-driving is no use; we
must use <i>steel pens, and dip them in red ink</i>,
if we wish to produce any real effect!"</p>

<p>It is related that Macaulay once, entering
the House of Commons, pointed to Benjamin
D'Israeli, and said to a friend, "There
sits Young England, represented by a
middle-aged Jew."</p>

<p>What D'Israeli would have retorted had
he heard the sarcasm is hard to conjecture,
but we are impressed with the idea that
Macaulay would scarcely have had the best
of it. D'Israeli is a very caustic and penetrating
satirist, and in his "Vivian Grey"
and "Contarini Fleming," the humor is of
a very high order. England boasts, at the
present day, a very respectable array of
humorists. There is Sir Edward Bulwer
Lytton, who succeeds, to our taste, better
in the comic than in any other line. There

<!-- page 311 col 1 -->

is Charles Dickens, there is Thackeray, there
is George Borrow, the author of "Lavengro;"
there is Kinglake, the author of "E&ouml;then;"
there is Bon Gaultier, otherwise Martin, the
poet, and inimitable translator of Goethe's
poems; there is William North, author of
"Anti-Coningsby," and the "City of the
Jugglers;" there is James Hannay, the
author of "Fontenoy," and of "Biscuits and
Grog," the naval satirist of Punch. There
are many more, whose books are, in the
English phrase, more or less "at all the
libraries." Nor must we forget the brilliant
author of the "Revelations of Russia,"
"Sixty Years Hence," and "The White Slave."</p>

<p>Let us see what America can array against
these, or rather what she can add to them;
for the republic of letters, at any rate, includes
both nations.</p>

<p>Washington Irving still lives, a host in
himself. There is Lowell, the author of the
Biglow Papers, and the "Fable for Critics,"
the best poetical satire since "English Bards."
There is Herman Melville, there is Harry
Franco, otherwise Tom Pepper&mdash;the C. F.
Briggs of private life. There is Whittier,
there is Nathaniel Hawthorne, there is
Shelton, there is Ik Marvel, or Donald Mitchell.
There are many more whose names we
need not recall to the reader; though not to
mention "<i>Sam Slick</i>" would be truly a sad
omission, so, Canadian though he be, Judge
Halliburton shall have his place in our catalogue,
as his fun has its place in our memory.</p>

<p>The Americans are a great nation, and
the first sign of their greatness is, that they
have originated a new style of humor. We
shall not quote examples, because those we
should select would probably be familiar to
most of our readers. We will merely
observe, that as America is a nation of nations,
a grand composite order of human
architecture, a sort of Yorkshire pie, which,
from the combination of every thing, produces
the one thing desirable, so American
humor is the combination of the humor of
all other nations, with a new element of its
own; and that element is vastness. It is a
great, an extravagant, a towering humor.
It goes up in a balloon to tie its own cravat,
it is so tall; so deep is it, that many men die
in looking to its bottom, one looking till he
drops down dead, and the next goes on

<!-- page 311 col 2 -->

where the last leaves off. It is a humor that
will some day make fun of all the rest of the
world. It is already a terrifically long boy.
Before long it will be a formidable Titan.</p>

<p>And now we look back upon our labor,
and we perceive that, after all we have by
no means realized the idea with which we
started. Let us hope that the reader's
acuteness has drawn the conclusions which
we have failed to point out, and his imagination
bridged over the chasms which we
have failed to fill up. But we feel ourselves
so incompetent honestly to excuse the fragmentary
nature of our work, that we can
only fall back upon a parable.</p>

<p>"It was a vast, flat, cylindrical, amber-tinted,
sharp-flavored cheese. The countryman,
a true clod-hopper, who had brought
the parcel to the hall, gazed despairingly on
the comparatively small effect his efforts had
produced on its vastness, as the master of
the house entered.</p>

<p>" 'Why, Roger, what a long time you take
to make a meal!' said the master impatiently.</p>

<p>" 'Ah, zur,' said the rustic, 'it's an
a'mighty lot of cheese to get through with
only one pot of beer and a half quartern
loaf!' "</p>

<p>Evidently the man labored under a singular
hallucination with regard to the necessity
of finishing the monster cheese before
him "right away," as a point of sacred obligation.
Nature, however, was stronger
than principle. Chucks the boatswain
said, when he tumbled up on deck
without breeches, "Duty before decency."
But though the world seems constantly to
be expecting it, we really cannot, as earnest
anecdotosophers, having a "mission to fulfil,"
seriously regard it as any man's duty to perform
an impossibility.</p>

<p>Now, our own case is precisely analogous
to the rustic's. Our subject is the cheese,
and we sit before its mountainous mass with
an awful sense of responsibility. We feel
that in the abstract we are bound to eat it
up, as it were, and digest it totally, whilst in
a practical point of view, we can only manage
a scarcely perceptible nibble on its margin.</p>

<p>We are not the devouring element, nor is
the reader; and were we to write all that
might, should, could, or ought to be written
on the vast theme of national humor, both

<!-- page 312 col 1 -->

we and the reader should inevitably perish
of old age in the process. Fifty years of
American Whig Reviews would not suffice to
contain the enormous work, and our sons
would have to continue the task for the benefit

<!-- page 312 col 2 -->


of the reader's descendants, <i>s&aelig;cula
s&aelig;culorum</i>, till the day of judgment itself
arriving, should bring forth a final and
decisive critique on the hereditary composition.</p>

<h3>MY GHOST.</h3>

</div>

<!-- Volume 40, Page 504 -->

<p>THIS is not a tale of spiritual rappings. I never heard any. Possibly
I am not worth a rap, being only an artist. My table does not
hop, or rear up, or fly. Between you and me, it is lucky it does not. If
it did, the claw would come off, to a dead certainty. I think it right to
mention this, and to warn any playful young ghosts or ghostesses of the
fact. Now to my tale.</p>

<p>Aurelia Garford and I loved one another passionately, so passionately
that at the age of seventeen we resolved to marry. Both our parents
opposed the scheme. We had neither of us any money, and though I
thought myself a Titian, the portraits I daubed were poor things
even for sign-painting. But we could not wait. We grew desperate. We
determined to run away into the wide world.</p>

<p>The wide world! How narrow it is, after all! A gimlet eight
thousand miles long would bore a hole right through it. And what is
eight thousand miles? Less than most people walk in a couple of years.
'What is any thing compared to every thing?' as the editor down east
observed.</p>

<p>Aurelia's parents lived in Two-hundred-and-twenty-second street. Their
house is near the corner of Fourth Avenue. It is a long way 'up town.'
Some say there is no such street. But that of course is nonsense, because
I know Aurelia lived in it. Many people, no doubt, have started off in
the cars to look for the street, and never found it. It is not easy to
find; though, as it is the next street to Two-hundred-and-twenty-first
street, it is not so difficult, after all. But I knew the street like a book.
There was only one house in it, and that was only half built, owing to
the owner's want of funds. I need not add that that house was the
house of Aurelia's parents.</p>

<p>There was a large garden to the house. People can afford space
for gardens up in Two-hundred-and-twenty-second street. It was a very nice
garden. Only one thing grew in it, and that was grass. But, give me
grass to walk on. Trees are all very well for climbing, and timber is
useful for building. Fruit is a capital thing if you want to eat, and flowers
are very pretty if you care to look at them. But Aurelia and I only
wanted to walk about with our arms round one another's waists; and
we preferred grass to trees, as we did not want to climb like squirrels,
or build like carpenters. We valued grass even more highly than flowers,
because we preferred sitting down upon it, and looking into one
another's eyes, to gazing at all the roses and magnolias in creation. And
as for fruit, we scorned to think of earthly peaches or apricots, when our
lips could be so much more sweetly occupied in exchanging celestial
kisses, of which no amount could possibly give us a surfeit.</p>

<p>It is my deliberate conviction that the garden of Eden was a grass-grown
bit of land, with good high fence round it to cast a shade in hot
weather. The rest was love, which makes a paradise of any place.</p>

<p>We resolved to run away. And we did. We met one afternoon
behind the wall of the grass-grown garden, and made for the cars. As

<!-- Volume 40, Page 505 -->

we went along, I summed up the items of my happiness, drew a line,
and calculated the total. The items were:</p>

<ol>

<li>An angelic disposition.</li>

<li>The softest black eyes in the world; silken tresses to match.</li>

<li>A complexion pure as the whiteness of a pearl.</li>

<li> A mouth which beat all the Greek statues to fits.</li>

<li>A neck and shoulders of human though quite equal to vegetable
ivory.</li>

<li>A slender, graceful figure, that would have destroyed St. Anthony's
saintship to a dead certainty, and so much the better for him if it had
tempted him.</li>

<li>Love for a certain individual, (who, like Mr. Ferocious in 'Tom Pepper,'
shall be nameless,) carried to the confines of hero-worship.</li>

</ol>

<p>Total: Aurelia Garford.</p>

<p>I was in a state of tremendous exhilaration. My soul cut capers and
threw up its hat inside my breast; at least so I conjectured from the
thumps I felt against the walls of that portion of my body. Aurelia
and I took one long-drawn, champagnish sort of kiss, just before we
turned the corner of that, to many, apocryphal Two-hundred-and-twenty-second
street, and in another minute we were at the rail-way station.</p>

<p>So was old Garford!</p>

<p>He had come home two hours before his time from his office down
town, where he was supposed to make money somehow. Not that
he ever made any. His wife had a small income of her own, and that supported
the family. Mr. Garford, at least so it appeared to me, was allowed
to play at business just to keep himself out of mischief.</p>

<p>'Hollo, young people!' he cried, jovially, 'taking a walk, hey!
Where are you off to? and what does my pretty Aurelia carry in that
confoundedly bulgy basket there?'</p>

<p>'Oh, papa!' cried Aurelia, whose self-possession was upset by the sudden
rencontre, and the dear girl burst into a passionate flood of tears;
tears of disappointment and vexation, I conscientiously believe.</p>

<p>'Hollo! what's this, what's this, young gentleman?' said old Garford
sternly, smelling a rat for the first time.</p>

<p>'Why, Sir,' said I, perhaps stupidly, impelled by an irresistible impulse,
'if you had not met us so unluckily, we should have run away and got
married.'</p>

<p>'Hum!' said old Garford, looking at me fixedly; 'is there any particular
reason for your getting married in such a hurry?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sir,' said I.</p>

<p>'And pray what is it?' said old Garford, severely.</p>

<p>'We love one another!' said I, looking him boldly in the face.</p>

<p>'Oh, is that all? Very well. You need not run away; I have not the
least objection to your being married.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stop a moment. I <i>have</i> a great objection to your marrying without
any thing to live on. Much as I was attached to Mrs. Garford, Sir, I
should never have dreamed of marrying her unless we had had between
us sufficient to support a respectable establishment, Sir.'</p>

<p>'But, Sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<!-- Volume 40, Page 506 -->

<p>'But, Sir,' resumed Mr. Garford, who evidently took a pleasure in
playing his part of heavy father in the drama; 'but, Sir, you perhaps
imagine that I can give my daughter a fortune. You anticipate&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not at all, Sir,' I interrupted, eager to disclaim all interested motives
'I know very well that you cannot give your daughter any thing.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Sir, <i>indeed?</i> And pray <i>how</i> do you know that I cannot give
my daughter a fortune? Are you aware, Sir, that the business I am
engaged in is one by which some of the largest fortunes in this city have
been realized, Sir?'</p>

<p>To use a somewhat worn but expressive phrase, I had hit my intended
father-in-law 'in the raw,' and all attempts to conciliate proved fruitless.
Nor did a hint from Aurelia, that 'papa knew very well he had not
made the rent of his office for the last two years,' at all mend matters.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Garford positively forbade my farther visits or correspondence
with his daughter, until I could show him that I was worth five
thousand dollars clear, and making an income of at least two thousand
a year.</p>

<p>Thus we parted. I made several attempts to see Aurelia, but failed.
In the end I resolved to set to work to make the required sum and
income with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>Luckily I made friends with a very clever painter, who undertook to
put me in the right way. I had to begin again. The fact was, I had a
tolerable dexterity in the blending of colors, but I drew like a Chinese,
or a Yankee as I was. My master was a Frenchman; he had studied
at Paris under Delaroche. He opened my eyes. I was quick. In a
few months, with considerable labor, I could produce a portrait at any
rate tolerably correct in outline and perspective. This at once raised me
above the majority of my rivals, and I soon procured considerable custom.</p>

<p>I had just laid the first stone of my fortune in the shape of a hundred
dollars deposited in a bank, when an overwhelming blow destroyed the
whole edifice of my hopes.</p>

<p>I received a letter announcing the death of Aurelia from her father.
She had been dead three weeks when the news reached me. My friend
the painter was present. He saw me turn pale and cover my face with
my hands.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he asked, kindly.</p>

<p>'She is dead!' I replied, in a shaken voice.</p>

<p>He knew my history, and needed no farther explanation.</p>

<p>I threw myself on a sofa and wept convulsively. When I had exhausted
the first violence of my grief, my friend approached me, and in
a tone of grave sympathy asked me of what I was thinking.</p>

<p>'Of death!' I replied.</p>

<p>'Of suicide?' said he.</p>

<p>I made no answer.</p>

<p>'Do you not possess her portrait?' said he.</p>

<p>'Yes, a daub of my own, but which reminds <i>me</i> at least vividly of the
original. I have also a daguerreotype, but daguerreotypes have always
a cold, ghastly look.'</p>

<p>'You should paint her.'</p>

<!-- Volume 40, Page 507 -->

<p>'Paint her?'</p>

<p>'Yes, paint her as an angel of heaven; realize your memory of her
beauty on the canvas. Leave a monument of your love and talent
behind you. Then die, if you please.'</p>

<p>The artist's suggestion pleased me. No youth of eighteen is in a
violent hurry to die, even for love. I resolved to adopt my friend's idea,
and a gloomy sort of ambition seized me to make this work a work of
art worthy of its model. Nay, I even dreamed of posthumous fame; of
going down the stream of American art-history, as the man who painted
a real angel, and then pursued its prototype into the world of angels.</p>

<p>I commenced my task that very day, and labored as long as the light
allowed, without cessation. My master aided me by his counsels; and
when the work was complete, he laid his hand affectionately on my
shoulder and said, 'Truly you are a pupil worthy of a greater master!'</p>

<p>We had the picture framed and sent to the exhibition of the Academy.
On the very first day my triumph was unquestionable. 'An Angel' was
decidedly <i>the</i> attraction of the exhibition. The same afternoon an offer
to purchase it for a large sum arrived from one of the richest merchants
of New-York. I sat with this letter in my hand trying to read it by
the already waning light in my studio, when I heard the door open and
some body enter. Supposing it to be the painter, I did not look round.</p>

<p>Presently I raised my eyes, and beheld to my horror a shadowy figure
in white, with a face of unearthly pallor.</p>

<p>The face was Aurelia's!</p>

<p>I confess that fear seized me. My shattered nerves, my recent over-exertion,
my fasts and vigils, had increased my nervous sensibility to an
alarming degree. I tried to reason with myself, and account for the
vision on grounds of mental delusion, when I was startled out of all reasoning
by the figure saying in a low but distinct tone:</p>

<p>'Frederick! do you not know me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know you,' was my solemn answer.</p>

<p>'And you still love me?'</p>

<p>'Now and for ever!'</p>

<p>'Then why do you not embrace me!' said the figure, gliding nearer.</p>

<p>'Can ghosts embrace?' I cried, rising dubiously, and gazing more
assuredly at the pale phantom.</p>

<p>'Try!' said the ghost.</p>

<p>And I did try; but it was no spectre; it was a living, breathing angel
I folded in my arms.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this? I thought you dead!'</p>

<p>'And I believed you buried. They told me so at home. I have
had a fever in consequence; see how pale and thin I am!'</p>

<p>'But I am alive; so are you!'</p>

<p>'That is evident.'</p>

<p>'What could have been your father's motive for such conduct and
such falsehood?'</p>

<p>'An insane wish to marry me to his partner, Mr. Smithson.'</p>

<p>'His partner?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he has caught a partner with money, as mamma says, and she

<!-- Volume 40, Page 508 -->

thanks GOD she will not have to pay the rent of the office out
of her own income any longer.'</p>

<p>'But how did you know I was alive?'</p>

<p>'Dead men do not paint pictures.'</p>

<p>'Then you know?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have <i>seen</i>&mdash;oh! you flatterer!'</p>

<p>'Flatterer? not at all. But look at <i>this</i>&mdash;an offer of seven hundred
dollars for the picture. An hour ago I would not have sold it for seventy
thousand. But now&mdash;suppose we take the seven hundred dollars
and run away at once?'</p>

<p>'It is not necessary; my father gives his consent&mdash;and here he is.'</p>

<p>Old Garford entered.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' said he, 'I congratulate you on your success. We shall
be happy to see you at Two-hundred-and-twenty-second street this evening,
if you are not otherwise engaged.'</p>

<p>Shortly afterward I was married. As soon as Aurelia and I were
alone in the carriage that bore us from the church, I said to her, smiling,
'My dear little ghost, I sincerely trust you will haunt me to my dying
day!'</p>

<p>'I will try,' said Aurelia, looking full at me with beautiful and fathomless
eyes, 'to be your ghostly comforter as long as I live.'</p>

<p>It is my opinion that a ghost is very much improved
by having a body attached to it.</p>

<h3>THE LIVING CORPSE.</h3>

</div>

<!-- page 32 col 1 -->

<p>WHY the fancy has seized me to write
the strange history which follows, is
to me inexplicable. My utter indifference
to human sympathy, human praise, or
human opinion, which will soon be seen
to be no vain affectation, would seem
to render such an act superfluous. Perhaps
the necessity for some species of action,
which even the inert granite is supposed
to be imbued with by the progressive
spirit of Nature, may account for the
proceeding. Since, however, I intend to
write, I propose to write intelligibly. It
is difficult to describe sensations where
memory alone must furnish their corresponding
ideas. Were I a human being,
in the strict sense of the word, I should,
if I may judge by what I see others do,
apologize for the imperfection of my narrative.
As it is, I shall reproduce the
images of the past with the fidelity as
also with the indifference of an echo. It
is perhaps the first time that a DEAD
MAN has spoken in the language of the
living, though approximations to the phenomenon
are to be found in many writers
of the day, whose works, I being absolutely
destitute of passions, can alone
dispassionately criticise. Weak minds
will either fail to comprehend, or recoil
with horror from my revelations. To
the thinking few, they will be a curiosity,
which I affirm gravely to be unparalleled
in the annals of literature, or the
records of history.</p>

<p>I was not always a living corpse. I
am not a natural monster. I was born
alive, in the full sense of the word. Nay,
I was the result of an unbridled passion,
and gifted with all the fiery vitality
which such lawless indulgences not unfrequently
produce. My mother was an
Italian Princess, my father a private soldier
in the Prussian cavalry. My birth
took place in secrecy, and with all the
precautions of pride and shameful terror.
I was brought up in an atmosphere of
mystery, and though invisibly protected,
was, from my earliest recollection, an utterly
isolated being. At the age of one-and-twenty,
after completing, as they say,
my studies at the University of &mdash;&mdash;, I
was placed in possession of a fortune of
one hundred thousand dollars invested in
the English funds, and informed that
henceforth I was my own master; whilst
I was supplied with a plain and probable
legend to serve as a convenient substitute
for a more authentic pedigree. It was
under these circumstances that I set out
on my travels, in the prime of youth and
love of enjoyment. My form was tall

<!-- page 32 col 2 -->

and powerful, my face of a rare and
marked beauty, and my talents of that
order which make the great heroes, poets,
and criminals of this imperfect world.
My destiny was in my own hands, and I
became, if not the greatest, at least the
most extraordinary of earth's children.
I state these facts in their naked simplicity,
because what is termed vanity, is so
utterly impossible to a being of my unique
nature, that I can waive all common
forms, and introduce myself at once in
my true colors to the reader.</p>

<p>I shall commence by a brief account of
my youth and education, or rather of the
early movements of my mind, which led
me to adopt a course so singular in its
audacity, both of conception and execution.</p>

<p>My two dominant passions, before the
extraordinary events which it is the main
purpose of this tale to record, were an
intense longing for exalted sensations of
pleasure, and as a means to this end, a
burning thirst for knowledge. Having
renounced all religious creeds, and set at
defiance all social prejudices, I resolved
to make the aim of my existence the attainment
by study and experiment, of the
most certain methods of scientific enjoyment.</p>

<p>I was naturally what the world calls
pre-eminently selfish; as if one man
could be more or less selfish than another;
as if, in obeying the laws of his organization,
any one could act otherwise
than yield invariably to the strongest
motive, as if any motive could be aught
else than a certain amount of <i>force</i> acting
upon an individual being!</p>

<p>But I will not philosophize. My human
and living readers would not understand
me if I did. Their perceptions are
clogged by passions and prejudices.
Hence truth is strange to them, and even
terrible. There are some few, eagle-eyed
who can gaze upon the sun, undazzled.
To these my philosophy would be impertinent;
to the mass it is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>I will tell my story without obscurity.
I will use the plainest language, and speak
to popular acceptations.</p>

<p>I was then, a voluptuary, but not a
common voluptuary. I saw that the ordinary
mines of enjoyment were soon exhausted,
or only to be worked more deeply
by labor that defeated its object. I
perceived that the most crowded paths of
pleasure turned back, by circuitous courses,
in never-ending circles.</p>

</p>I resolved to abandon these pastures of
gregarious man. But before abandoning

<!-- page 33 col 1 -->

them, I tested them by experience. I
plunged into all the dissipations of
my age. I sought all the distractions that
youth, a strong well-nerved body, and an
active mind could hope to obtain. I
bought all the diversion that gold could
buy. I lived with my generation; I surpassed
them; I led them. I practised
systematized moderation. I essayed unbridled
excesses. And&mdash;I was disappointed.</p>

<p>I did not, as the cant phrase goes,
awake from my illusions. I had read,
seen, and thought too much. I was too
clear-headed to have any illusions.
Where others saw misty prospects, I saw
naked facts. I summed up, and found
the balance on the wrong side. My experiment
was a failure.</p>

<p>I had travelled, I had seen the wonders
of art, and the beauties of nature. I had
had access to the best, and to the worst
of society. I had labored, and been rewarded
by fame. The book which I
wrote, won the applause of a nation. I
foresaw that it would obtain new triumphs
in foreign lands; and my foresight
has been confirmed by fact. Lastly,
I was united to the woman I loved;
who brought me thrice the fortune I expected,
and a mind cultivated beyond my
hopes. And with all this&mdash;I was dissatisfied.
I craved for intenser pleasure;
more exalted excitement, and I could not
disguise from myself that it was so. I
reflected deeply.</p>

<p>"What," said I, "is happiness? Is it
a monotony of sensations, which are taken
to be pleasurable on the faith of popular
opinion, whilst the inward voice still
whispers languor and tedium, whilst half
the day is passed in a dreary vacuity of
mind, which is, at best, merely the bare
negative of pain? Is it a feverish working
and striving for objects which on attainment
invariably become insipid and indifferent?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Reasonably regarded,
it is surely a positive, appreciable state of
consciousness, in which we can say without
hesitation to the moment, in the
words of Goethe, 'O linger yet, thou art
so fair!' It is a certain condition of the
nervous system, and without that condition&mdash;misery."</p>

<p>I fell to watching myself studiously at
different times, and under various circumstances.</p>

<p>I observed that, at a certain stage, wine
produced sensations of extreme delight.
But I also observed that these sensations
soon gave way to other and more sombre
feelings; that, in fact, there was a happy
crisis in alcoholic stimulus, which, when
once past, could not be recalled on one

<!-- page 33 col 2 -->

and the same occasion. Indulgence, too,
in wine was, I perceived, followed by a
vague, dreary despondency, that lasted incomparably
longer than the brief passing
moments of delicious exhilaration it produced.</p>

<p>On the whole, it was better to leave the
mind to nature and mere mental excitements,
than to attempt to light the sacred
fire at the now neglected altars of Bacchus.</p>

<p>I need not say, that to become vulgarly
intoxicated, was, with me, out of the question.
There are some strong brains that
defy the utmost possibilities of wine. I
could have poisoned myself, but I could
not render myself an unreasoning animal,
by any amount of spirituous liquors.
Often I persevered to the last, and when
all my wild companions had sunk, I may
say in many cases fallen beneath their
potent draughts, I alone sat erect, and at
worst discovered that my stomach was a
weaker organ than my head. In such
cases a feeling of awful and gloomy sadness
would possess me, and after sitting
long in silent and strangely lucid meditations,
I would walk home calmly in the
gray of the morning with little outward
indication of the debauch from which I
had emerged.</p>

<p>It was evident that no cascades of wine&mdash;even
though they beggared Niagara in
their ruby or topaz-like curves&mdash;could
overarch for me that enchanted palace,
in which I desired to spend my days, and
defy the adversary&mdash;Pain, Evil, Devil,
Typhon, Ariman or Sathanas, in a word,
the dread foe, named or nameless, described
or indescribable, of human happiness
and its continuance.</p>

<p>Apart from all more palpable causes of
suffering, man sits between Memory and
Desire, between the Past and the Future,
as between two rival mistresses, each
dragging him towards her by turns with
uneasy passion; whilst before him, and as
it were balanced on an eternal and invisible
tight-rope, sways the only nymph that
can bless him with her love, the only
goddess he can really and truly possess,
if indeed he can possess anything, the divine
Present&mdash;and he&mdash;dares not clasp the
radiant virgin to his heart, dares not drive
to the East nor to the West, along the interminable
roads of space, the furies that torment him, madden him, and devour
him, now, then, and evermore!</p>

<p>For my part, I said to the sad and pale
brunette, the angel Pr&aelig;terita, and to the
blonde seductive blue-eyed spirit Futura,
a like farewell. The genii of Past and
Future ruled the race of man-the Earth-God.
But one was a rebel and an outlaw;
and that one was I.</p>

<!-- page 34 col 1 -->

<p>I said to the Universe, "Let me <i>feel</i>
happiness, not merely dream it." And
everlasting echoes from all the depths of
Kosmos, even from the farthest bounds
where creation, ever encroaching, borders
upon awful chaos, everlasting echoes answered 
"DREAM!"</p>

<p>And I replied to the spirits of the Infinite,
and demanded proudly, "Ye blind
legions of monitors! where in nature is
your unclouded happiness? where is your
<i>perfection?</i>"</p>

<p>And the echoes laughed back in mockery,
"<i>perfection!</i>"</p>

<p>Then I ceased to ask counsel of any
men or spirits. For I was determined to
be my own guide, and my own teacher,
since all the wisdom of the world had
not yet led to happiness. Therefore I
scorned its pretensions, and derided its
impotence with justice.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I became a great smoker. I purchased
the rarest tobaccos and the costliest pipes.
I had a perfect museum of meerschaums,
nargul&eacute;s, chibouques, and tubes and
bowls of all sorts of shape, size, and contrivance
for the inhalation of the fragrant
weed. I purchased, at extravagant prices,
the choicest boxes of cigars. I smoked
grandly, incessantly, infernally. The atmosphere
grew dark with my smoking;
at least to my imagination. I wrapped
my soul in the incense of tobacco. I
created worlds of fancies out of its wreathing
vapors. I began to think I had found
the resource I wanted, and I often exclaimed
in dreamy ecstasy&mdash;"Divine Nicotiana!"*
I doubted whether the vapors
which inspired the Pythoness did not
arise from the hookahs of the priests
smoking in solemn divan in the subterranean
halls of Delphi. And I gave them
high credit for having so well preserved
the secret they had discovered.</p>

<p class="small">[*Nicotiana is the scientific name for tobacco. It is derived from a Frenchman of the name of Jean <i>Nicot</i>
who first imported it to France.</p>

<p>At the same time, like a true Turk,
I took care to have the finest coffee
of Mocha prepared by the most perfect
machinery. I found that, after fasting,
the effect of coffee upon the nerves was
almost supernatural; but combined with
tobacco, it was Elysian. It produced an
intense state of enjoyment, during which,
I would discourse with a marvellous eloquence
to my adoring Mira, who was
never weary of following the train of my
prolific and far-stretching fantasies. How
easily in this period of my madness (as I
have since learned to deem it) did I unravel
knots in science and philosophy,
that had puzzled the wise men of ages.
How intuitively did I seize on combinations,

<!-- page 34 col 2 -->

whose results, in the hands of practical
men, might have rendered them the
acknowledged benefactors of the world, and
enriched whole nations of workers! But
with me, all was a reverie of selfish recreation.
I created glorious plans, I foreshadowed
mighty inventions, as a voluptuous
exercise of the mind; I played as
it were grand symphonies on the most intellectual
themes, and the compositions
perished with the dying sounds, like the
fantasias of musicians, which are never to
be repeated.</p>

<p>But this could not last. My powerful
organization resisted for a time the exaggerated
abuse of drugs, which, common
though they be, are in excess, like all
other substances, the deadliest poisons.
Smoking destroys the appetite, and ruins
the digestive powers. Its effect upon the
nerves then becomes tremendous. I soon
made this discovery. A neuralgic irritation
attacked me, which, as I still pursued
my diabolical fumigations, went on with
a fearfully <i>crescendo</i> movement. Deadly
sickness of a peculiar inactive character,
fits of the horrors, in which all things
became repugnant, wearisome, and nauseating;
ideas of suicide, and awful despondencies,
descended upon me like a
flight of vultures on a dying antelope. I
abandoned the poisons. My prostration
was complete and unbearable. I partially
resumed them, and tried change of air and
scene. I just recovered sufficiently to be
able to suffer more acutely. I had evidently,
at least temporarily, undermined
my constitution. It was at this period,
that, like a demon watching his occasion,
<i>opium</i> became my comforter.</p>

<p>For the first time a book fell into my
hands, a dangerous book, which has made
many wretched: I mean "The confessions
of an English opium-eater." This work,
as all the world knows, was written by
Thomas de Quincy, an Englishman of letters,
who is still living. And with regard
to this de Quincy, I will mention one thing
that is curious. He is intimately persuaded
that he is a great philosopher. In
reality he is a fragmentary poet, imbued
with considerable transcendentalism. His
book is extremely amusing, but the reverse
of philosophical, for it arrives at no
conclusion. It is an opium book in more
senses than the writer would have you
believe. Such as it is, however, this book
was the immediate cause of my taking to
opium.</p>

<p>Its first effects were delightful. It
tranquillized my irritated nerves, and I
entered, as it were, a new world of dreamy

<!-- page 35 col 1 -->

speculation. An invisible barrier seemed
raised between me and the external world.
Nothing troubled me, nothing annoyed
me. I was on the verge of being utterly
impoverished by a dispute as to the title
of my wife's property. But it gave me
no uneasiness. The danger passed away
as it came&mdash;like a fleeting fancy. The
only thing that slightly interfered with
my peaceful ecstasy of indolent reverie,
was the apprehensions of my wife. She
had heard that opium-eating was a shocking
thing, and she could not at once get
reconciled to the idea. Nor would any
thing induce her personally to taste the
talismanic liquid&mdash;the <i>happiness in bottles</i>,
as de Quincy has aptly termed it.</p>

<p>The effect of opium in producing dreams,
so forcibly dwelt upon and splendidly illustrated
by that writer, I need not enlarge
upon. Enough to state that the
number and variety of my visions were infinite.
Ages were crowded into nights.
The most monstrous and gigantic images
were familiar things. Time and space
were extended beyond all conception, except
that of an opium-eater. Nevertheless,
opium palled upon me, and the opium-dream-world
became almost tedious.
I had, too, an excessive dislike to the taste
of laudanum, which, strange to say, increased
rather than diminished. One day
I returned home with a small vial of bright
green liquid in my pocket. It's very color
had a mystic poisonous fascination. How
much more potent and cabalistic was
its spell than the dark, thick, brown,
drowsy-looking laudanum! It was Haschisch.
Haschisch is a sort of Indian
hemp (Canabis Indicus). The liquid in
the vial was an extract from its stalks.
This Indian poison is mentioned in Lamartine's
Vision of the Future, and in Alexander
Dumas's Monte-Cristo. Their exaggerated,
or rather apparently exaggerated
descriptions of its effects have no
doubt caused the majority of their readers
to consider this marvellous drug as a
mere figment of the poet and novelist's
brains. It has, however, a real existence,
and is in extensive demand amongst the
initiated. In effect it resembles opium,
but is more exhilarating, and less narcotic.
I continued for a whole year to increase
my doses of this new elixir of happiness,
and did not find myself assaulted by any
of the horrible fancies which de Quincy
complains of, as the after results of opium.
Like King Mithridates, I was becoming
familiar with poisons, and they began to
respect their master. But, though I lived
as much in another world from that of ordinary
mortals, as if my habitation had
been in the planet Uranus, I could not
escape a more terrible poison than even

<!-- page 35 col 2 -->

the Hydrocianic, commonly called Prussic
acid, in which, as an antidote to certain
effects of the <i>Canabis Indicus</i>, I freely
indulged. <i>Ennui</i>, the spleen, that mysterious
and tyrannical malady, pursued
me, even into my poison-guarded dream-world.
I grew accustomed to the life, the
old dreams and fancies recurred, and became
tiresome. Already I meditated a
deeper plunge <i>in Venemum</i>. I fell in, accidentally,
in some review, with an account
of the <i>Arsenic-eaters</i> of Styria, and of the
results of that mania, in heightening the
personal beauty of its devotees. Certainly
the pure delicacy of Mira's clear fair complexion
left no room for improvement, except
in the fancy of a madman. Nevertheless,
I longed to try the effect of an
arsenic varnish&mdash;if I may so express myself&mdash;upon
both her and my own countenance.
Who could tell whether seeming
more beautiful to one another, our love
might not acquire new strength, and develope
new sources of delight. I was in
the midst of a profound reverie or rather
Haschisch dream on this subject, when I
received a letter from a scientific friend,
announcing the discovery of the effects of
inhaling <i>ether</i>, in destroying sensation and
rendering surgical operations painless.</p>

<p>I thought that new light burst upon my
soul. In one instant, I became a convert
to an entirely new system of nervous influence.
I rushed out to buy some <i>rectified
sulphuric ether</i>, and a machine for
inhalation. The latter consisted of a bottle
to which was attached a flexible tube,
about two feet long, and two inches in diameter.
I eagerly poured in some ether
and applied the funnel-like mouth-piece
to my lips. After a few inspirations of
the vaporized ether, I felt a most marvellous
and delicious effect. I felt a stream
of joyous expansion steal rapidly through
my veins, even to the tips of my toes,
which tingled with delight. I at once felt
the vast superiority of inhaling the stimulant
over swallowing it. Instead of going
through the tedious process of digestion,
whose functions it disturbed and impeded,
as in the case of wine, the purified and
refined spirit (for ether is but rectified alcohol)
entered at once into the lungs,
thence into the aerated blood, and thus
through every part of the body with the
crimson flood of impatient arteries, and so
back with the blue current of the veins,
to evaporate harmlessly, leaving nothing
but its memory behind it!</p>

<p>"Hence!" I exclaimed, "wine, coffee,
tobacco, opium, haschisch! away henbane,
arsenic, hydrociana! Coarse and noxious
stimulants, narcotics, and nerve-swindlers,
who wrap the soul in cumbrous veils, that,
like the robe of Dejanira, invades the life

of your votaries. I am no de Quincy, I,
to mock myself with vain half realized
fantasies, to stand up to the middle in
Styx, and murmur vaguely&mdash;<i>Suspiria
de profundis!</i>"</p>

<p>And now a new field opened to my researches.
The world of <i>gas</i> spread temptingly
before me. Little do the vain mob
understand the import of that word&mdash;to
them the emblem of emptiness. "It is all
gas!" they cry. Yes, truly every thing is
gas, is, was, and ever shall be gas. The
most solid and material things resolve
themselves into mere gaseous combinations.
A little more of one gas, a little
less of another, and lo! all the varieties
in nature are produced. All was originally
gas. Chaos was the confusion of
gases. All must resolve itself ultimately
into gas. You and I are gas, and gas is
every thing.</p>

<p>I became a man of gas, a maker and an
experimentalist of gaseous mixtures. I remembered
the exhibitions which in my
youth I had witnessed of the effects of
<i>laughing gas</i>, the inhalation of which
causes the wildest intoxication, or rather,
exaltation of the brain, and causes those
who breathe it to exhibit the most fantastic
feats, illustrative of their predominant
passions. If there is truth in wine,
in gas there is revelation. Yet the man
in whom reason is the ruling faculty, will
subdue all outward indications of the
mighty <i>afflatus</i>. There is a supreme gas,
a gas of gases, and its particles are souls.
All other gases exist by numerical arrangement,
as Pythagoras well conjectured,
when he prefigured the atomic
theories of modern days. But there is an
ultimate atom, a gas which is the basis of
all others, and without which all is vacuum.</p>

<p>I knew that in an atmosphere of pure
oxygen, the gas essential to life, and at
the same time the agent of all decay, the
sour stuff (<i>sauer stoff</i>) as the Germans
call it, an animal could live, and live with
a wondrous acceleration of all the physical
processes. In man this rapid consumption
of matter was accompanied by
an equal intensifying exaltation of the
mental faculties. On this fact I founded
my experiments, and the result was at
length, the combination of oxygen with
other gases, in an artificial atmosphere
of the most astounding and admirable
qualities.</p>

<p>To breathe this air, was to breathe positive
 enjoyment. It was vaporized nectar
and ambrosia. Its respiration was the
life of a God. But it was also the embodied
<i>Sansar</i>&mdash;"the icy wind of death."
No mortal could live more than a few
months even in its partially diluted perfection.

<!-- page 36 col 2 -->

It was the short life and merry of
the reckless popular adage, reduced to palpable
embodiment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this rapidity of life
was only apparent. For we measure time
by sensations; and the exalted powers of
sensation, confirmed by breathing the
wondrous gas, gave time a supernatural
extension similar to the life of dreams,
but free from all their shadowy indistinctness.</p>

<p>My resolution at once was taken. I
would live and die in this glorified atmosphere.
I would bid farewell to all that
was earthly, without hesitation. I bought
a magnificent chateau in the South of
France. I furnished it by the expenditure
of one-third of my fortune, in a few days,
with all the luxury that imagination could
suggest. I fitted up my apparatus for the
production of the gas, and engaged, at the
rate of some thousands of francs, monthly,
a young chemist of first-rate education,
and superior energy and abilities. To him,
I confided all the management and regulation
of the apparatus, and also the absolute
control of the servants, and of the
whole establishment. One suite of rooms,
the most splendid, and with the finest
prospect in the chateau, were to be my
own enchanted habitation. Into these
apartments, except at certain times and
with due precautions, no servants were to
enter. Every thing that I required was to
be sent up through the floor, by means of
tables that screwed up and down, by
noiseless machinery. No one was to disturb
me on any pretext; no letters were to be
given me, and, as the chemist was poor,
almost starving when I first patronized
him, I knew that so long as every month
brought him a little fortune in itself, I
might count on his absolute devotion.
Besides, I deceived him as to my intentions.
There was only one room&mdash;the
largest and most splendidly furnished in
the house&mdash;which was to be actually filled
with the life-accelerating gas. It communicated
with the other apartments by
carefully constructed double doors, and of
course it never entered the mind of the
chemist that I intended to live and die in
the deadly atmosphere which he was to
create, or that, after so carefully ordering
these hermetically closing double doors,
I should purpose fixing them wide open,
the moment I was shut up within my
mysterious domicile, and thus causing the
whole suite of apartments to fill with the
same ethereal poison.</p>

<p>In other respects, the chemist was just
the person I wanted; he was patient,
faithful, and industrious. At the same
time, he was a cold stern man, well fitted
to repress any insubordination or curiosity

<!-- page 37 col 1 -->

on the part of the household. And now
all was prepared for the experiment. It
only remained to persuade Mira to be my
companion. For I confess that without
her, ever the potence of the marvellous
gas must have failed in its action on my
nerves. Her love had become a habit, a
part of my being, I could not live or die
without her.</p>

<p>And here let me for the first time say a
few words about Mira.</p>

<p>She was an entirely exceptional woman.
When I married her, some three years before
the date of my final experiment, she
was only sixteen years of age. Her
beauty (I can find no newer or more intelligible
image) was of the order which
the finest painters strive to impart to their
embodiments of angels, and beings superior
to man. Its supreme loveliness was
not in its delicate regularity of feature,
dazzling whiteness and purity of skin,
and majestic symmetry of form. All these
seemed merely indispensable conditions of
such an individuality. What made her
irresistibly pleasing to the perceptions of
an imaginative and thoughtful man, was
a certain calm, unalterable dignity and
noble gentleness, that placed her above
even the possibility of any of the meannesses
and pettinesses of the sex. She
had the strong mind of a man, with all
the purity and softness of an exquisitely delicate
female organization. In temperament,
she was my opposite, although intellectually,
there existed between us a
perfect sympathy. She was as calm
and serenely contented, as I was feverishly
dissatisfied and eager for excitement.
Yet she understood and entered into all
my wild speculations, as into an interesting
drama, of which she was the sympathizing
spectator. She was my only confidant,
my only friend, my only real companion.
With all my restless cravings
for greater intensity of enjoyment, her
love was my world, my treasure, and my
hope&mdash;the more so that I might almost be
said to mistrust its possession.</p>

<p>That Mira loved me, was indeed indubitable,
yet there was a calmness, a purity,
and passive even tenor in her love, that
could not be called coldness, and which
yet in a manner disappointed the fiery
adoration with which I loved her. I would
not have lost one of her kisses for all the
embraces of all the beauties of the earth;
and yet, to my fierce and impassioned nature,
there seemed more snow upon her
bosom, than a poet's simile implies, more
than perchance would ever melt beneath
my lip's ecstatic pressure.</p>

<p>In the delusion of my wild tempest-tost
soul, which, after all, was but that of a
mad poet's, astray in the deserts and primeval

<!-- page 37 col 2 -->

forests of thought, I knew not that
the crown of her glorious beauty and of
my delicious, because never satiated, passion,
lay in the very qualities which I regretted,
and which I insanely hoped to
conquer by my infernal and pitiless inventions.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I had no difficulty in
persuading Mira to enter the enchanted
atmosphere. A first trial of its virtues
was of course decisive. We gave ourselves
up to the intense joy of a life, to
which pain, care, and sorrow, regret for
the past or apprehension for the future,
were necessarily strange. The outer world
became nothing to us. Love, exalted to a
degree of power which to the breathers of
common air is inconceivable, appreciation
of beauty and delights which are alike
inexplicable and incomprehensible, made
up the sum of our existence. I pass over,
therefore, the seven times seven days of
our ethereal life, a period which in ideas
and sensations was equivalent to the ordinary
lapse of ages, and hasten onward to
the extraordinary catastrophe which left
me what I am&mdash;a monster, more rare and
wonderful than the sphinxes and chimeras
of old, my fabulous prototypes.</p>

<p>Nor let the reader foolishly imagine that,
because memory or science give me the
power of describing passion, and thereby
exciting <i>his</i> sympathies, that <i>I</i> personally
do or can feel any echoing vibration of the
wild chords which I cause to resound.
Unearthly is the music&mdash;unearthly the
musician.</p>

<p>Opening from the grand saloon of the
chateau, was a superb conservatory of
more than ordinary dimensions, commanding
a view of one of the most splendid
landscapes in the world. In the foreground,
yet not sufficiently near to intercept
the view, rose from the side of the
hill, on which stood the chateau, the mingled
foliage of an old and primitive forest,
while beyond was visible the shining
stream of the Rhone, lying, like the crooked
sabre of some gigantic Paladin, upon the
greensward; and far, far beyond rose the
bluish shadowy outlines of mountains behind
which the sun would set in golden
glory, that made each snow-crowned peak
a throne worthy of Sathanas&mdash;"the Emperor
of the furnace."</p>

<p>Round this conservatory were arranged
a collection of strange exotic and tropical
plants, so as to leave the centre unoccupied,
save by a few couches, chairs and
tables, on which lay volumes of poetry
and philosophy, and portfolios of exquisite
engravings and drawings. This was our
favorite sitting-room. It was only necessary
to open the glass doors between it
and the saloon, to fill it with the same

<!-- page 38 col 1 -->

enchanted air; and I may mention as a
curious example of the effects of this atmosphere
on vegetation, that the grapes
which were quite green and hard on its
first introduction, ripened perfectly in a
few days, and were the largest and most
luscious fruit I had ever tasted or seen. It
was one of Mira's greatest enjoyments to
call me to watch the camelias budding and
flowering actually before our eyes! Were I
in the humor I could write a hundred pages
on the wonders of vegetation with which
my residence in this gas-world made me acquainted.
But I refrain without difficulty.
To me no science is worth a thought.</p>

<p>In the centre of this hall of crystal
stood a white marble statue of Minerva,
the only statue in which that goddess has
ever been represented entirely without
drapery. The figure was Mira's. I myself
modelled it during the first year of
our marriage, and it was carved by one
of the most eminent French sculptors, who
afterwards died mad from a hopeless passion
for the original. The fountain sprang
from and formed the foliage of a glass
tree stem, against which she leant, whilst
the point of her spear drooped earthward
from her arm, as if languid with the warfare
against folly. Her head alone was
covered with a helmet, which imparted a
singular charm to the divine beauty of
Mira's countenance.</p>

<p>At length, one day, towards evening,
after seven weeks of solitude and happiness,
which no Paradise could more than
realize, a fatal accident destroyed at once
our enjoyment, our experiment in science,
and our lives. Yes&mdash;I learned it afterwards&mdash;we
were killed by the merest accident.
My chemist who managed the gas-generating
apparatus, forgot to examine
the metre at the proper time. The gas
continued to enter in unprecedented volumes,
and its effects were speedily perceptible.</p>

<p>We were seated in our favorite place in
the conservatory, our eyes turned towards
the setting sun, listening to the swelling
and harmonious cadences of Weber, produced
by a self-playing instrument of the
rarest workmanship, which I had purchased
at Paris for an enormous sum, of
its inventor, when a more than usual ecstasy
seemed to possess us. Our arms,
entwined round one another's forms, seemed
to contract almost convulsively, our
eyes, our lips met with delirious love, and&mdash;I
remember no more. When I recovered
possession, not of my senses, but of
my consciousness, I was still seated upon
the sofa, on which the angel of death had
surprised us, whilst on the marble pavement.
at full length, her face turned upwards
with an expression of supernatural

<!-- page 38 col 2 -->

felicity, lay Mira&mdash;Mira, my wife, friend,
and goddess&mdash;the fairest and noblest of
women. She was dead.</p>

<p>Mira was dead. That was evident.
But what was I? I rose, and regarded
curiously the culpable chemist, who, having
discovered his oversight, had hurried
too late to our rescue. He had thrown
wide open the windows of the conservatory.
I inhaled the common air of the
sky. But, though I breathed and moved,
however incredible may appear the statement
of a fact, hitherto unknown to
science, I was to all intents and purposes
as much a dead person as Mira herself.
That is to say, I was dead to all sensation,
emotion, passion, or by whatever other
phrase may be described the action of the
external world upon the sensitive being.
It is true, I could hear, see, feel, taste,
and smell, but such sensations had no
longer any influence upon me either in
causing dissatisfaction or satisfaction. My
sensations were mere facts to my consciousness
and no more. Mira was dead,
that was a fact. She lay there, pale and
beautiful, before me&mdash;a fact. I myself
had lost the half of my life&mdash;a fact. The
chemist, who was the author of these
hideous calamities, as men would say,
stood trembling before me&mdash;another fact.
In a word, I was a <i>living corpse</i>. One
class of nerves, the nerves of sympathetic
sensation, appeared either paralyzed or exhausted
of their circulating fluid. Love
and anger were no longer my attributes.
I had reached, truly, and at one stride,
the <i>centre</i> of <i>indifference</i> told of by
some philosophers. But it was a centre
of indifference which they talk of without
understanding. I did not understand it&mdash;<i>I
was in it</i>.</p>

<p>The chemist stood pallid and trembling
before me. He was a cold, unimpassioned,
little impressionable man. But in
the presence of my dead eye and marble
rigidity of feature, he trembled involuntarily.
No doubt he mistook my absence
of emotion for some tremendous effect of
internal passion. He evidently dreaded
an explosion of a terrible nature. But I
merely said&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is dead&mdash;you are no longer wanted&mdash;go."</p>

<p>For one moment, he looked at me with
a most extraordinary expression, then,
overwhelmed by the icy look with which
I covered him, he departed in silence.</p>

<p>I remembered that his salary from the
beginning was unpaid. Nor had he ever
the courage to ask for it. Of course I could
have no motive in sending it to him. The
happiness of others was to me no longer
a possible subject of interest. A man
takes no interest in others, who can take

<!-- page 39 col 1 -->

none in himself. The chemist, driven to
despair by poverty, committed suicide in
the course of the same year.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, the body of Mira
was buried. In the mean time, from physical
habit, as it appeared, I one day took
up a book&mdash;a volume of poetry. It was
no longer poetry to me, but a collection
of signs representing certain phenomena.
A book of arithmetic was to me of precisely
equal interest.</p>

<p>I had eaten and drunk nothing since
the great catastrophe, though I had been
urged to do so by people to whose entreaties
and pity I was alike indifferent.
But, remarking that my body was wasting
away, I ate a measured quantity,
which I continued to do regularly afterwards,
though without any appetite or
enjoyment.</p>

<p>But I had reason and power of command
over my body as much as ever.
those operations which formerly were the
result of impulse, I had now to perform
as pure acts of will. The only reason
why I did not quietly await death, was a
clear intellectual consciousness of the fact
that I was in an abnormal state, and that
it was also possible that I should return
to the natural conditions of humanity.</p>

<p>Without being a desire, the discovery
of the means of effecting this change became
my only object; and in order to attain
what, in reality, I cared nothing
about (the contradiction is only apparent),

<!-- page 39 col 2 -->

I spent years in trying the most extraordinary
experiments in natural science ever
imagined. Perfectly indifferent to the
success or non-success of my experiments,
I yet worked on. If I might be said to
have any thing left resembling a desire, it
was a passionless inclination towards abstract
truth, which seemed to be a sort of
mechanico-spiritual law of my being. But
to compare this mere gravitation towards
an abstract centre to the ardent enthusiasm
of ordinary men of science, would
be absurd. And here, I recognize the impossibility
of conveying to a living man
the impressions of a corpse. Therefore
I abandon further attempt at illustration.</p>

<p>Perhaps one fact may explain more
than much analysis. After some years,
during which time I made numerous scientific
discoveries of the most remarkable
character, I lighted upon the secret. I
had it in my power at any moment to return
to life, to rise again from the dead,
and once more to share the passions and
cares of men. But I had no motive to
change my condition. I remained a
corpse. The discovery was to me&mdash;a fact.</p>

<p>Why should I again inhale the gas of
happiness and destruction, why revive to
an existence that would be a type of the
fabled hells of legendary lore? Mira is
dead. I am a living corpse; and I am the
only being bearing the shape of man who
could ever honestly declare himself to be
<i>perfectly contented with his lot</i>.</p>

<h3>THE MASTER OF THE WORLD.</h3>

<!-- page 48 -->

<p>IT is a strange thing to reflect upon, that mankind only exists
by my permission. It is a thrilling thought, a terrible consolation,
that I have but to <i>will</i> the deed, and in a brief space
the surface of this globe would be my empire, and its inhabitants
my slaves; nay, that were I to go a step further, the race
itself must disappear from the scene, and I&mdash;I alone remain,
the solitary tenant of our planet!</p>

<p>Fortunately for thee, O reader&mdash;probably incredulous&mdash;of
this incredible, yet true history, and for all thy brother mortals,
I am not the demon which I have been represented.
The sufferings I have endured, the wrongs which I have experienced,
the savage cruelty, the bitter neglect which I have
encountered, have not destroyed in my soul that germ of good
which I inherited from ancestral eternity, which grand and
noble studies have fostered and developed, but which pain and
injustice have vainly combined to demonize.</p>

<p>So long as I am sane, the existence of the world is secured.
No one but a madman would surely dream of so immeasurable

<!-- page 49 -->

a crime, so stupendous a caprice as the wholesale murder of
a world of animate beings!</p>

<p>But lest it should be deemed that I claim more credit than
I deserve, for this forbearance, that I exaggerate the causes
which might, in a mind of a different order, have destroyed
the fair flower of mercy, and induce a fiendlike exultation in
misanthropic vengeance, I will narrate the principal events of
a life which have resulted in so marvellous a denouement, as the
potential conquest of the world. Henceforth, let. pedagogues
and schoolboys moderate their laudations of a Sesostris, an
Alexander, a C&aelig;sar, or a Napoleon, whose power was, compared
to mine, as nothing, whose conquests were insignificant
indeed, if contrasted with my sublime abnegation of conquest.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, after a violent quarrel with my
father, who was a rustic, at once proud, narrow-minded, irascible,
and vindictive, I was mercilessly bidden to go seek my
own living, fairly turned out of doors and driven from the home
of my youth, a sad and penniless vagabond.</p>

<p>I made a small packet of a few necessaries, and with a savage
recklessness, engendered by long years of hard treatment
and ill-usage, turned my back forever upon the ties of blood
and domestic affection. The whole idea of my life was metamorphosed
like the colored stars of a kaleidoscope. But my
star was not in the ascendant.</p>

<p>After walking about a mile, I seated myself upon the gate
of a field by the roadside, and gave way to serious reflections.
I felt less depressed than astonished by this sudden change in
my life, and the difficulties which threatened me. Being of a
determined character, the idea of return and reconciliation did
not for an instant occur to me. But the prospect of the wide
world before me and my own energies as my sole fortune, was
a dazzling and embarrassing thing to contemplate. Whilst I
thus meditated, I saw the figure of a woman coming towards
me. It was my mother returning home. I flew to meet her,
and in a few words disclosed to her what had happened, and
my unalterable resolution. She turned very pale; wept on my
shoulder for a long time; then, thrusting her slender purse into
my hand, said firmly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless you, my dear, dear boy! May success attend
you! Write to me often, and tell me where to address you.
Forgive your father his unkindness. It is his temper, not his
heart, that is at fault."</p>

<p>"Dearest mother," I replied, embracing her, "tell my father
that, if possible, I will deserve his respect, by my conduct."</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>And so we parted. Then, and not till then, I wept bitterly
in the desolation of my solitude. But even as I wept, I strode
onwards in the direction of the great city, which I had never
seen, and which my imagination painted in such attractive yet
awful coloring. For the first time the fear of the world was
on me, and I felt a dim presentiment that for the poor man life
is a battle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this journey was to me a period of happiness.
The wild sensation of liberty was in itself a glorious stimulus.
Hope of success was unclouded by knowledge of the world.
For the last time I enjoyed fairly the freshness of physical
nature, and took, as it were, a sad farewell of my old friends,
the green trees and the shining rivers. Thenceforward I was
to tread the dry, dusty streets of the cities, and to inhale the
atmosphere of human care, competition, and misery; I was to
exchange communion with the invisible spirits of the universe,
for association and contention with the embodied spirits of men,
when I had yet to learn first to fear, then to hate, and lastly
to despise. To love mankind is denied me. How can the victim
love the executioner, or the tyrant the slave?</p>

<p>When I entered the city, a few dollars were all that remained
to me. I hired a cheap and obscure lodging, and resolved to
take the first employment that offered itself. For several
weeks I sought unsuccessfully for a taskmaster. At length,
after being reduced to the verge of destitution, and even making
some unpleasant experiments as to man's capacity for the
endurance of hunger, I found a small clerkship in a hardware
store, where for a miserable pittance of a few dollars
weekly, I exchanged some twelve hours daily of my life and
energies. The man who employed me was a man of iron, like
the goods he dealt in. He was shrewd, calculating, and mean,
yet at the same time not without a certain ingenuity and enterprise
which induced him to listen to my suggestions as to
some improvements in the tools he dealt in. The speculation,
which involved little outlay, and no risk, was successful, and
a small increase of salary was my reward. But the passion
for invention once indulged, I became involuntarily a clerk of
the most objectionable kind. I committed frequently oversights
and mistakes in ordinary matters of business, and was,
in consequence, after several disagreeable scenes, in which I
was sufficiently abused by my master, dismissed summarily,
and driven to seek for a more satisfactory occupation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had obtained admission to a public library, and
finding myself now at leisure, gave myself up to a devouring

<!-- page 51 -->

passion for study, which in a few weeks got me considerably
in arrear with my landlord, and gave me an intense distaste
for the slavery of clerkdom. At this crisis, I formed the
acquaintance of some young men connected with the press,
and having written a few articles which were published in a
weekly paper, resolved rather to trust to the hazardous chances
of the pen, than to pursue a more certain but uncongenial
career.</p>

<p>From that epoch my life was indeed a battle, a battle with
necessity in its grossest and most revolting shape. Not possessing
the slightest talent for rapid and superficial composition,
I produced, at the expense of vast thought and labor,
articles of a really useful, but to ordinary editors and readers,
of a most unattractive stamp. It was with the greatest difficulty
that from time to time I could earn the little absolutely
necessary to support existence. Having no ambition or genius
to become a successful author, I toiled on in a state of the most
melancholy despondency, only forgetting my misery in the
visions of scientific discovery and combination which the books
I perused continually suggested. Such was the eagerness with
which I read every work I could procure on natural philosophy,
that at the end of little more than two years I had a command
of the leading facts in most sciences sufficiently to enable me
to launch out into the boldest and most original speculations.
A peculiar clearness of arrangement and power of analysis
had always been the characteristic of my mind. By degrees
I began to relax in my passion for reading, and to find myself
absorbed in a course of the strangest and most audacious reflections.</p>

<p>The knowledge of my masters in science ceasing, by familiarity,
to dazzle, I began to criticise their reasoning with a
stern sense of equality. I felt myself one of their republic,
and began to aspire to the high places, which too often appeared
to me but usurped by their occupiers, for want of a bold
disputant of their authority.</p>

<p>One night, having no other place to sleep in, owing to my
inability to meet my rent that morning, I betook myself, on
the strength of a solitary cent, my only wealth, to the cabin of
a ferry-boat, where at least I was sure of shelter from the
cold, and a seat to rest on. In the course of the night a gentleman
of remarkably pleasing and gentle manners seated
himself at my side, and, probably reading in my worn features
and shabby garments the secret of my position, commenced a
conversation with me, by a remark as to the coldness of the

<!-- page 52 -->

weather, which he followed up by observing the change which
had taken place in the climate of late years; thence, with
easy gradations, he led me to discuss with him the theories of
cosmogony, and, apparently struck by the novelty of my remarks,
took the liberty of inquiring whether my profession
was literature?</p>

<p>"I have no profession," was my answer; and its subdued
despair did not escape the stranger.</p>

<p>"You have at least a bias?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would advance science."</p>

<p>"Are you versed in mechanics?"</p>

<p>"They are embodied mathematics. I have studied them
deeply; but they are the A B C of science."</p>

<p>"What then do you study?"</p>

<p>"Forces; their conditions and relations."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the stranger, "embodied metaphysics?" At
this moment the steamer touched the quay.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed the stranger, suddenly, as if vexed
by something he had forgotten, "I have not left that note in
Wall-street. Perhaps you pass that way. Would it be offending
you to ask you to leave it as you pass? It is of vital moment;
and I shall be happy to pay a dollar for the service."</p>

<p>"That is quite unnecessary," said I, with the unconquerable
pride of poverty; "but I will leave the note to oblige you, with
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well," said the stranger, and hastily scribbling
something in pencil on the leaf of his pocket-book, he folded
it into a small note, turned for an instant to the light to write
the address, placed it in my hand, wished me a friendly good-night,
and strode away like a man in a great hurry, leaving
me to relapse into my despondent misery.</p>

<p>I was disappointed. I had expected that he would at least
express a wish to see me again after so interesting a conversation.
There was, too, something selfish in exacting a gratuitous
service from a man so palpably poor as myself. I
looked at the note. To my amazement the address was "To
the bearer." I opened the paper and read these words:&mdash;"Young
student, I should have been glad to improve your
acquaintance and serve you if possible; but, weary of life, having
seen, felt, and experienced much, resolved no longer to
bear upon my heart the misery of all mankind, I die by my
own will&mdash;my life a failure. But for you&mdash;<i>courage!</i> You
can <i>endure</i>, I could only <i>act</i>. Adieu."</p>

<p>This extraordinary note enclosed a bill for fifty dollars. I pursued

<!-- page 53 -->

the stranger&mdash;but in vain; I knew not what direction he
had taken. Two days after, I read in a paper an account of a
suicide committed at a hotel, by a gentleman answering in
every respect to the description of the stranger. A great sensation
was produced by the event. It appeared that he was
an Englishman of distinction, and some celebrity as a poet,
that he had expended his whole fortune in acts of extravagant
benevolence; and that, being too proud to endure existence
on the ordinary terms of humanity, he had given me
his last fifty dollars, and departed for another life with the
coolness of a traveller who sets out for another continent.</p>

<p>But, to return to the night of our meeting. After my unsuccessful
pursuit of the stranger, I returned to the ferry-boat
with a heart divided by the most opposite emotions. I had found
and lost a generous and noble friend. It seemed almost as though
my life had been saved at the expense of another's. On that night
I shed the last tears which earth has been able to extort from
my hard nature. Bitterly I wept, till with the dawn of
morning I once more found myself treading the hard pavement
of the dismal and deserted streets Oh! those streets,&mdash;those
sad, cruel, rocky streets! how often in great cities have the
weary steps of neglected and despairing genius made mournful
music for the sorrowing angels of heaven, longing to snatch
them up to their white bosoms midway upon the martyrdom of
glory! But he who would ascend the mountain, must scale the
precipice. He who would rise to heaven must first descend to
hell, unless, like me, he stray madly into that country of which
no traveller has written, no poet fabled; icy and desolate region
where the sun's rays are pale and cold, and the heart ceases to
vibrate in harmony with nature, whilst yet continuing to pulsate
in mockery of life.</p>

<p>I satisfied the cravings of my famished body, and for two
days continued without cessation to make fruitless inquiries
for the stranger. On the third morning, the news of his death
reached me. Then, and not till then, I began to form projects
for my own future. But I was a changed man; the solemn
incident which had interrupted the monotonous misery of my
life, had stirred all the hidden depths of a soul fathomless as
the abysses of space, of which indeed every soul is the microcosm.
I seemed to have inherited the terrible burden of which
the stranger had spoken in his note. It was no longer my own
petty miseries that occupied me, but the idea of the universal
misery extending over the habitable earth.</p>

<p>"O! great and noble spirit," I murmured, "never, never

<!-- page 54 -->

will I forget that thy latest act was one of strange and penetrating
kindness to an unknown outcast. As thou hast lived,
so will I live; our roads may be diverse, our aims shall be the
same; and, if ever I feel tempted to degrade my soul by a
mean or cowardly action, I will pray to thy disembodied self
to inspire me by thy invisible presence with strength to resist
temptation."</p>

<p>I now resolved to quit New York. I had written a work on
"Imponderable Fluids," for which I had been unable to find a
publisher; and I had made several practical inventions, which
no capitalist would entertain, on account of their startling novelty,
the great expense of carrying them out in practice, and
my incapacity from sheer poverty to produce working models
of my inventions.</p>

<p>I determined to go to London. Surely, thought I, in the
market of the world, I shall find men ready to appreciate my
discoveries&mdash;publishers eager to purchase my works. I will go
to London; I will accumulate wealth; I will pursue my
investigations of the profoundest arcana of science; I will
study; I will experimentalize; I will invent; I will create
machine giants, with limbs of iron, compared to which all
engines of the past shall be as feeble pigmies; I will annihilate
poverty, by illimitable increase and facility of production; I
will overthrow the fallacies of political economy, by the revolution
of all existing relations between labor and capital; in
a word, I will become the God of the earth, by the power of
unrivalled knowledge, and I will make a paradise of my kingdom,
by the grandeur of the ideas which shall guide the use
of my power.</p>

<p>Such were the reveries of a madman, who, with fifty dollars
for capital, and a new idea for an introduction, set sail for England,
to commence a sleepless war against that concrete mass
of ignorance, selfishness, and stupidity, which is called society;
that chaos of vile materials, which seems to exist only
for intellect to mould, to revolutionize, and contend with, until
finding a grave of rest, amid the heterogeneous confusion of
discordant elements and monstrosities of repulsive vitalism.</p>

<p>On the dial of Time are mighty numerals; millions, and
quintillions, and decillions of years, fabulous periods over which
thought passes as over seconds of human measure. Ichthyosauri
no longer drag their hideous length over the slimy surface
of an infant globe. Dodos, in ranky vegetating isles, the
wingless birds of an age, when quadrupeds were not, have
passed away into the ghost-world of science, from which cunning

<!-- page 55 -->

philosophers upraise them for our amazement. Nature improves
with practice. There are many respectable classes of
men who shall, ere long, be the ichthyosauri and dodos of future
science. Wondering students then shall read how human
ichthyosauri were in those days, who ever grovelled in the slime
of selfishness and ignorance; human dodos, without wings to
their souls, to whom the free air of thought was inaccessible,
and how these imperfect, grovelling, and wingless men passed
away and became traditions, fossil statesmen, generals, traders,
and journalists, to be seen in Barnum's museums of those
days, with actual fossil Barnums, as the drollest curiosities
amongst them.</p>

<p>During the voyage, I meditated on the vast field of creative
activity which my idea had opened. I revelled in the complicated
construction of a thousand varied applications of the boundless
sources of power and motion my discovery had given me.
Often I half fancied that the idea itself might be an illusion,
a dream; that I should wake up and find myself cured of the
stupendous hallucination. But it was not so. I was the last
man in the world to mistake chaos for order, or dreaming for
science. I have lived to curse the painful clearness of vision
which enables me alike to penetrate, at a glance, the souls of
men and the foundations of a system. The idea was a truth;
the greatest practical truth with which science had ever
dealt.</p>

<p>This truth is, and ever shall remain, a secret. But, lest its
existence should be deemed an imposture, and my possession
of it a pretence, I will sufficiently indicate its nature to convince,
and, at the same time, mislead the studious, who will
vainly ponder over the meaning of the enigma, of which the
key is in the hands of the master alone. The secret may be
torn from nature by others, as I myself did wrench it. From
me it shall never part, even as a death-bed legacy.</p>

<p><i>Force</i>, or primitive motion, is of a nature entirely different
from that which all past philosophers have imagined. What
is called inertia, is the active converse of motion. All force
radiates and converges. The part <i>is</i> equal to the whole. Division
and multiplication are convertible terms. Every particle
of matter is instinct with perpetual motion. Every motive
force is infinite, and moves the universe. But vague,
mystical, and meaningless as these phrases may sound to the
majority of readers, I dare not proceed. Already I have said
too much, perhaps, for the safety of my secret&mdash;that marvellous
discovery which a thousand times have I explained and

<!-- page 56 -->

descanted upon to fools who could not recognize the talisman
when before their eyes, who refused to clutch the philosopher's
stone when offered to their grasp. To them the revelation was
profoundest silence.</p>

<p>There is one discovery I have not yet made. It is the depth
of human stupidity. I hope yet to fathom it. Would there
were equal hope of discovering its antidote!</p>

<p>During the voyage, I meditated on all these things, and devised
my scheme of action. I possessed the secret so long
coveted by men, if not in the precise sense in which they understood
it, the secret of perpetual and inexhaustible motion.
I possessed, moreover, the knowledge and the power to direct
the application of this force to every detail of manufacturing
operations, locomotion, and agriculture. I possessed everything
but the pecuniary means of demonstrating my ideas by
a model which might cost, at the utmost, five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Reader, for twenty long and hateful years of suffering, I
never possessed fifty dollars beyond what I required for my
most immediate necessity, and in no one case did I, during
that whole period, possess a single dollar beyond the amount
which I was indebted to needy and pressing creditors.</p>

<p>With all my science, I lacked the science of living.</p>

<p>The voyage was over. The nights on deck, when, alone of
all the passengers, I, wrapped in my rough pilot coat, revelled
in the storm, bounded with the waves, laughed at the
dashing spray, and held communion with the wild spirits of
the sea and air, these were at an end. Whilst on the sea, I
felt as if I had a friend in old Oceanus, with his million traditions
and unfathomable mysteries. Often 'mid the howlings
of the storm I recited poems of my departed benefactor, whose
works I had procured at New York&mdash;my sole preparation for
the voyage; wild, deep-diving invocations of mighty and intoxicating
phantasms! Often I sang them to mad tunes, to
the roaring sea's accompaniment!</p>

<p>But these were vanished pleasures. Again my feet were on
the hard stones of a mighty city, of all earth's cities the
mightiest. My feet were on the hard stones&mdash;emblem of the
hearts I was to encounter, of the fate that was preparing for
me.</p>

<p>I had now a task before me: to find a capitalist. In that
phrase is summed up for the poverty-stricken inventor all the
hell of which priests fable, and at which fools tremble.</p>

<p>Brief shall be my description of this Inferno. I have seen
in one week, one hundred capitalists who came in answer to an

<!-- page 57 -->

advertisement, all burning with an insatiable thirst of gold,
yet all too mean so cowardly to risk a single hundred pounds
for the prospect of unbounded wealth!</p>

<p>In vain I have remonstrated with their unreasonable cupidity.
In vain, in other cases, I have frankly told my secret, which
they could not understand, and illustrated it by simple experiments,
from which they were incapable of drawing conclusions.
In vain have I exhausted analogy in striving to persuade
a brainless merchant of the feasibility of my schemes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said one, "I see very well that there is something
in it. I have no doubt you are a very clever man; but suppose
it fails, what becomes of my hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>Another would say, "Ah! yes, on a small scale an experiment
may succeed; but on a large scale, it is very different."</p>

<p>"Why so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have always found it so."</p>

<p>"Idiot," I replied, contemptuously, "you never tried an experiment
in your life, and if you saw one tried, you were
unable to comprehend it!"</p>

<p>"You are a beggarly scoundrel and adventurer, trying to
extort money on false pretences, you&mdash;" here I stopped the respectable
Englishman, by opening the door, and fairly throwing
him down stairs, for which offence I&mdash;I, the king of science,
the discoverer of the greatest of earth's secrets&mdash;was imprisoned
for seven days in a common jail.</p>

<p>This gave me a lesson. I threw no more capitalists down
stairs, but, on the other hand, I succeeded in convincing none
of the truth or practicability of my projects. Yet it was not
for want of hunting. I hunted capitalists as a sportsman
hunts his game. I grew quite a connoisseur in these sort of
beasts. I could measure capacities with a look, a man's degree
of understanding by a glance at his phrenological development.
More than once, I said to a fat, self-complacent old millionaire&mdash;"Sir,
it is unnecessary to enter into the affair with
you. Good morning! Excuse the liberty."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, why so? what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Minus," I would answer, touching my head with my finger,
and leaving him under the impression that I was a madman,
and not he&mdash;a fool.</p>

<p>The half-enlightened, self-sufficient ignoramuses gave me the
most trouble. These miserable creatures would dispute with
me, till I told them frankly that they had yet to go to school.
The actual men of science were utterly impracticable. They
immediately strained every nerve to show themselves superior

<!-- page 58 -->

to me, by demonstrating the fallacy of my views. One only
partially caught the profound meaning of my enigmatical
hints, for by this time I had grown savagely tenacious of my
secret. It was my only possession, my only consolation, and
I cherished it proportionately. The consciousness of the power
which this secret gave me, raised me above the herd of men,
in every other way my worldly masters.</p>

<p>I had become a sad vagabond; I had tried the press, and
occasionally got a paragraph into a paper, as what is called
a penny-a-liner, but I was ragged, starving, and hunted
from lodging to lodging, for the most part. Sometimes I
slept in the open air, in the parks on benches, or under archways.
My beard was unshorn, my linen unwashed. I became
a cynic. I began to despise men too deeply to value their
opinion. My sufferings made me ferocious in manner. I was
generally considered mad. One day, in a starving state, I
took a large book from a bookstall, and walking into the shop,
sold it to the bookseller, who, as it was a common edition,
readily gave me one-fourth of the price it had been marked in
his window. This I thought an excellent joke at the time, and
laughed secretly over for many days. The man was a Jew,
and I had learned that Jews were cunning people. But I think
English traders are quite as cunning, and fully as ignoble.</p>

<p>I grew to hate traders, from the petty shopkeeper who sold
me an ounce of chiccory instead of coffee, to the great capitalist,
who repulsed my inventions without examination in his
selfish ignorance. So much did I hate them, that I often
used to mock them for pastime, and ask them, as I passed
along, how many people they had cheated that day, and how
much one of their pound weights might truly weigh? They
scowled upon me in reply, and some answered abusively;
but I never stayed to hear them. This race of men in England
are all cowards. I considered that if it were possible to
rob them, they were to be regarded as no better than the bees
from which the honey is taken without mercy.</p>

<p>As I grew poorer and poorer, I consorted only with mechanics,
and from time to time a few strange vagabonds like myself,
who had seen better days, and we had a sort of miserable
sociability; and when we had earned or borrowed a shilling,
we would go together and make a meal at a coffee shop, or
drink ale at a public house, as they call drinking saloons in
England, and be quite happy for the moment in a wretched,
obscure way.</p>

<p>Once, however, I wrote an article on galvanism, and forwarded

<!-- page 59 -->

it to the editor of a scientific periodical. To my surprise
I received, in a few days, a polite note requesting me to
call. When I entered his room, the editor, a little dark man,
with small eyes and a very large nose, on which rested a pair of
green spectacles, observed my strange appearance with the
greatest astonishment. With pretended sympathy, he inquired
into my position, and told me that as he was in want of a private
secretary, he would engage me at a salary of a pound
a week, if it suited me. I eagerly closed with the offer, and
wrote for this man, besides numbers of papers for his journal,
a most important work on dynamics, which had a large sale
afterwards, but on the completion of which he discharged me,
and thus once more threw me on the world. But when I
learned, as I did from the papers, of the success of my work,
published in the little editor's name, I was seized with a fierce
anger, and going straight to him, I spoke thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Man! I am willing that you shall establish a reputation on
the basis of my labor, but for the money which you receive for
the work, it shall be mine. Deduct, therefore, the four months'
salary you paid me, and hand me over the money!"</p>

<p>Now the editor had received three hundred pounds for the
work, and my salary for four months was sixteen pounds.
Therefore he put on an air of intense astonishment and indignation,
and told me that I had agreed to work at a certain
rate, that he had honestly paid for that work, and similar hypocrisies,
which he concluded by offering me ten pounds as a
compromise.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" I replied, "know that the sum of which you have
robbed me would have enabled me to produce the grandest invention
the world has ever witnessed. Take your choice between
exposure and restitution!"</p>

<p>"You know I dictated the work to you," said the little man
with marvellous effrontery.</p>

<p>I strode away in silence. I wrote a letter to a newspaper
revealing his imposture, that very night.</p>

<p>Two months later I was arrested for the costs of an action
for defamation of character, brought against me by the editor,
and which I could get no lawyer to defend. I was held up in
all the papers to public contempt as a liar, and I only escaped
from prison by being transferred to a mad-house on account of
my persistence in raving of my invention, and my eloquent
letters written to people of distinction, requesting their
assistance in producing it.</p>

<p>It was after fifteen years passed in a public pauper mad-house

<!-- page 60 -->

that I succeeded by stratagems, which it is unnecessary to
dwell upon, in escaping from its walls, and once more regaining
my liberty. I had been carried to the asylum a young man
of five and twenty; I escaped at the age of forty, prematurely
gray, with a heart hardened into granite by the stern
sense of irreparable wrong, and with a power which made me
what I am&mdash;your master.</p>

<p>I had wasted the brightness of youth in intolerable misery,
the prime of manhood in a loathsome prison. The world had
been my foe, and vengeance was in my hands.</p>

<p>I possessed the power to bless mankind by infinite material
creation. I also possessed the power to sweep them from
the bosom of the earth. In the solitude of my mad-house
cell, amid the clanking of maniac chains and the howling of
demoniacs, a fiendlike thought crossed my brain as the glare
of an incendiary's torch flashes across the wall of the doomed
mansion. Hitherto my soul had been exclusively occupied
with one thought&mdash;the happiness of men, the annihilation of
their woes; now a new idea forced itself upon me, the idea
of destruction, of unlimited havoc, of death made easy by a
science to which the arts of Archimedes were mere trifling.</p>

<p>Deeply versed in chemistry, I pondered on the powers and
application of explosives, until step by step I ascended the
baleful eminence of infernal dominion. That I could carry
about my person the means of destroying an army or a citadel
was nothing. I lit upon a mode of projection so distant in
its range that its operation must appear miraculous, whilst
its certainty surpassed the most accurate calculations of ordinary
gunnery, at common distances. All this, which in my
cell I could but meditate, I have since realized by experiment.
On one occasion I destroyed from the summit of a mountain a
vast herd of buffaloes grazing at ten miles distance; and it
was I, and not the lightning, who at the distance of nearly
seven leagues destroyed the Hapsburg tower at Ratisbon, as I
could, if I willed, destroy the Hapsburg dynasty itself, did I
not cherish it as one of the most splendid curses with which
the coward tribe of men were ever afflicted and degraded.</p>

<p>On leaving the mad-house, my first visit was to the post-office,
where I found letters announcing the death of my
parents, and containing drafts for money from the executors.
My father had, after all, died a millionaire. A town had been
built upon his land, owing to a new railway communication,
and I&mdash;I the despised, starved, hunted wretch, was rich enough
to have carried out a thousand inventions had I willed it. But

<!-- page 61 -->

I willed it not&mdash;my models were made and destroyed for my
own satisfaction. My secrets shall die with their discoverer.
In contempt of mankind and its meanness, I rove the earth
consorting with vagabonds and outcasts. It is for them
alone I am rich. No trader's store can ever boast of my presence.
I would as soon ask an ape, as a banker or merchant
to share my hospitality. I know them, I loathe them, I despise
them, calm in the terrible consciousness of unbounded and irresistible
power.</p>

<p>The secret of happiness I refuse to men for vengeance. I
spare their lives, not so much from pity as from contempt.</p>

</div>

<p>When a child I was essentially a phantasmist.</p>

<p>My nights were crowded with a series of ever
recurring dreams, which too often degenerated into
hideous nightmares. My days were filled with fancies&mdash;to
which an all-dominating imagination gave
almost the substance of reality. Common life had
scarcely a hold upon me: I had none of the sharpness
of other precocious children. I was easily
duped in the simplest matters, because I did not
understand that there was any utility in deception.
Being absolutely pure in soul and innocent in heart,
I was set down as mysteriously vicious because my
teachers could not understand me.</p>

<p>But, in one respect, I was far in advance of ordinary
children. My ideas of love and beauty were
developed to a degree, even at four years old, which
to many would appear incredible. I had indeed but
one master passion; and it was only at a later period
that the constant thwarting of my imperious cravings
for spiritual and physical sympathy aroused to
violent activity a fierce combativeness, which has
often since led me to the commission of acts of sudden
violence and startling retribution, not originally
natural to my character.</p>

<p>One fancy, one dominant vision, haunted me incessantly&mdash;almost
from my cradle. At first it was a
beautiful child; then an exquisite young girl; then,
as I myself became a man, a superb and glorious
specimen of ideal woman. In reality, I thought of
nothing else. My school-tasks were performed in
order to get rid of an extraneous annoyance, and return
to my fanciful world. My games were mere
reactions of the bodily functions of the brain, essential
to health and sanity. I was always pondering
over the attributes&mdash;trying to picture the shape and
features of my fantastic princess, and holding everlasting
imaginary conversations with that inessential
being.</p>

<p>If these details appear tedious, or strike the reader
as common to many others than myself, I can only
regret that they are indispensable to the proper understanding
of my after life. Moreover I wish it to be

<!-- page 175 col 2 -->

believed that these dreams of mine were strictly absorbing,
and by no means exceptional states&mdash;that I
took no interest whatever in any of the ordinary objects
of children, boys, and youths, approaching
adolescence.</p>

<p>On attaining puberty a vast change came over me,
and for some years I was swept along by a current
of passion and adventure, which, at the age of two-and-twenty,
left me a sort of moral shipwreck, alone
in the world&mdash;limited in means, though for the time
independent in position.</p>

<p>My early intercourse with the world had brought
me nothing but mortification, bitterness, and disappointment.
My appearance was singularly delicate
and effeminate. My complexion was fair as a
young girl's&mdash;my soft blue eyes and silky hair
would have been admired in a woman. My figure, though
accurately proportioned, had neither the imposing
height nor the robust development required to carry
off the girlishness of my countenance. At eighteen
the young ladies called me a "pretty boy," asked
me if I used pearl-powder, and playfully kissed me.
But they had <i>other</i> looks for their whiskered, <i>manly</i>
admirers. In such presence I was forgotten, or
treated as a mere innocent youth. Unlike my accursed
preceptors, the cruel fair ones would not even
give me credit for viciousness. They simply held
me to be a milksop. To illustrate this fully, I will
describe a scene which took place on my twentieth
birthday.</p>

<p>I had then been residing for nearly two years in
the house of a distant female relative, whose niece,
Aurelia, was a lovely girl about my own age, magnificently
developed; with large, dark-brown eyes,
splendid shoulders and arms, and a form which the
fairest of the graces might have borrowed without
blushing.</p>

<p>Aurelia was a fine girl, and had a noble nature;
but she could not see in me that chivalrous and gallant
cavalier I was so desirous of impersonating.
She knew I adored her&mdash;had adored her from the
first; but she could not look upon me as a serious
lover. She played with me gracefully&mdash;enchantingly;
but, still&mdash;it was but play.</p>

<p>One day I resolved upon an explanation&mdash;I could
bear the trifling no longer.</p>

"Aurelia," said I, "my dearest cousin! <i>I love
you!</i>" and I took her hand passionately.</p>

<p>Aurelia laughed gayly.</p>

<p>I became suddenly sad-almost severe. I stood
erect, and said&mdash;"Why do you laugh?"</p>

<p>"It is so absurd, you foolish boy: pray do not talk
such nonsense.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said I, bitterly.</p>

<p>Aurelia looked. This time she did not smile; for
there was a wildness in my gaze that alarmed her.</p>

<p>"You prefer John Riversham to me?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Riversham is a <i>man</i>," said Aurelia.</p>

<!-- page 176 col 1 -->

<p>"Nearly a year my senior," I added, stung to the
quick by this unpardonable insult.</p>

<p>"Mr. Riversham is capable of protecting a wife,"
said Aurelia, proudly.</p>

<p>I saw she loved the man&mdash;as it chanced, a despicable
puppy, but with the face of a dragoon.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that he can protect himself?" said
I, savagely.</p>

<p>"Against impertinent boys?" said my cousin, insultingly.</p>

<p>"Against a <i>man!</i>" said I, still more vindictively.
"Why, girl&mdash;this fellow was caned by my hand but
<i>yesterday!</i> and the provocation was one in which
<i>your</i> name figured&mdash;I beat him like a dog! He does
not <i>pretend</i> to fight. Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you wicked boy! enough of boasting and
falsehood for one day. Leave this room, sir!"</p>

<p>I burst into tears.</p>

"Aurelia," I cried, "have pity on me! what I
have said is the truth, though passion alone drove
me to utter it so brutally. Do not judge me by appearance:
give me <i>hope</i>&mdash;render my character justice.
How often have you hinted that I was timid, effeminate,
incapable&mdash;and how patiently have I borne all!"</p>

<p>"I do not believe you; and even if there be any
truth in what you say, no doubt Mr. Riversham
spared you out of pity!" cried Aurelia, crimson with
passion.</p>

<p>"<i>Perhaps!</i>" said I, with sarcastic emphasis; and
without another word I left the room and the house.
How I wished that Riversham had been a fighting
man; but he was a "spotted" coward, and my affair
with him was at an end.</p>

<p>As for my cousin she hated me ever afterward&mdash;and
I pitied her. We always affect to pity those
whom we despise in fact.</p>

<p>She married Riversham.</p>

<p>One or two similar repulses, though not carried to
the same length, completed my disgust for society
and the women it produced. As for women of a
different class, they inspired me with positive aversion,
save as a passing distraction.</p>

<p>With every day I shrank more and more from the
discords of actual life, and gave myself up more to
poetry, study, and day-dreaming. My old childish
fancies came back upon me with renewed force, and
my dreams by night became an object of envy to my
waking consciousness. Still, notwithstanding Bulwer's
story* (which, like all Bulwer's metaphysical
attempts, is a blundering failure,) no man can make
the ordinary kind of dreams, or dreams proper, a real
source of happiness.</p>

<p class="small">[*In the Pilgrims of the Rhine.]</p>

<p>It occurred to me, therefore, to try a novel experiment.
Having minutely studied the phenomena of
sleep and dreaming, I summed up the objections to
dreaming, as a chosen condition of existence, under
four heads.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Uncontrollability.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Indistinctness, confusion, and tendency to
metamorphosis, or crisis inducing awakening.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Consciousness of unreality, even whilst dreaming.</p>

<!-- page 176 col 2 -->

<p>4.&mdash;Impossibility of perpetual sleep.</p>

<p>How far these objections might be overcome by
others I did not pretend to say; but to me they appeared
radically insurmountable, and still do so at
this moment.</p>

<p>I then contrasted dreams with waking imaginations,
or castles in the air; and perceived that the
latter were comparatively free from all the above
objections, excepting the third&mdash;that of unreality to
the consciousness. <i>There</i> dreaming had an obvious
advantage&mdash;for it produced positive illusion, however
transitory; whilst mere waking imagination
could scarcely be said to approach that point of marvelous
coincidence between the material and the
spiritual existence.</p>

<p>Given then the problem to produce an intermediate
state, in which the vividness of the most real
dreams should be superadded to the voluntary creation
of the clearest and most consecutive fancies.</p>

<p>This problem I hoped to solve.</p>

<p>I knew that hallucinations were common, in
which men perfectly awake, and in broad daylight,
saw things which had no positive existence with
perfect distinctness. It is true, these visions were
involuntary. But what was volition. Did not every
combination made by the mind spring necessarily
from one centre of action? Was <i>will</i> indeed any
thing but modified <i>impulse?</i> Was not the soul, the
real being, in fact a vital source of power, a spiritual
sun, emitting rays in every direction, these rays
being broken, reflected, and refracted entirely according
to the media they encountered? Could I
not so modify my spiritual radiation as to surround
my focus of perception and sensation with images
and feelings of my own selection? Was not, in fact,
the conceiving so tremendous an idea in itself a step
toward its realization?</p>

<p>I further reflected that as every faculty of mind
and body was strengthened by practice&mdash;witness the
effect of gymnastics, and of the exercise of the memory
or of the study of mathematics&mdash;so might I,
by continually making powerful efforts of imagination,
so far exalt the power as to obtain over it a
tangible and positive control.</p>

<p>Had I imparted my intentions to any one, my experiment
would certainly have been regarded as a
deliberate attempt to drive myself mad. I therefore
made all my arrangements quietly, shut myself up in
a suite of rooms, which were only to be entered for
purposes of order and necessary supplies, during my
brief daily absence for the purpose of exercise, and
devoted myself to the absorbed contemplation of the
ideal world.</p>

<p>My purpose was to concentrate the whole force of
my imagination upon one image of incomparable female
beauty, until from being a mere shadowy
fantasy, the creation of my soul should become a
plain and indestructible vision; nay, I even indulged
the hope of endowing my phantom-mistress with
qualities palpable to the other senses, and of thus
living the remainder of my life in a delicious trance
or enchanted lunacy, which should to me supply all
the enjoyment which the common world denied.

<!-- page 177 col 1 -->

Little did I think that for a brief space I should invade
the very empire of the gods and enjoy an existence&mdash;which
I will not describe by anticipation.</p>

<p>But before I could commence my daring experiment
in earnest, a certain physical preparation was
indispensable. Active imagination and a hearty or
even healthy appetite for food are irreconcilable.
A severe course of diet and study was necessary to
drive sensuality from its strongholds. Just as a
prize-fighter or a pedestrian goes into training for <i>his</i>
business; did I, the sportsman of <i>thought</i>, prepare
myself for my undertaking.</p>

<p>At the end of three weeks I had gradually reduced
my system to that state, when the appetites are comparatively
dormant, whilst the nerves are exquisitely
sensitive. I had become disinclined to sleep, clear-headed,
and enthusiastically enamored of my scheme.</p>

<p>My food was a slice of dry toast and tea for
breakfast, and often little more for dinner. Although
I went out into the open air in my garden, and lounged
upon the grass, I now took no exercise worthy of
the name, and far from drinking wine or spirits,
quenched my thirst with effervescing drinks of a
tendency opposed to stimulant.</p>

<p>Thus, after reading Shelley's poems, Hoffmann's
tales, several of Balzac's most spiritual romances, a
little of Alfieri, some Lamartine, Tennyson, Goethe,
Shakspeare's Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and indeed
all his plays but the comedies and earlier tragedies,
with an occasional dive into Herodotus, Homer and
&AElig;schylus, Dante and Gibbon, the Hindu Vedas, the
Zendavesta, the Koran, and the Bible&mdash;I found my
brain in a state of perfect activity, full of images, free
from all lymphatic languor, and thirsting with wild
emulation for the indulgence of its own <i>creative potence</i>.
Such was the effect of my training bodily
and mental. During all this time I neither visited
nor received visitors. I conversed with no one, and
the silence in which I lived was only broken by the
strange songs which I composed and sung&mdash;echoes
perhaps of Mozart, Cimarosa, Weber, Meyerbeer or
other of my old musical idols&mdash;echoes strangely
varied and confounded with new and marvelous conceptions
of my own, which I shall soon have further
occasion to allude to.</p>

<p>It was now, sublimated and subtilized to the height
of the most transcendental state of thought, and the
most ethereal condition of body, that from a chaos of
shadowy heroines freshly presented to my mind I
commenced, like a spiritual Frankenstein, the elaborate
construction or rather evocation of my phantom
goddess.</p>

<p>Like Minerva, from the brain of Jupiter she sprang
armed with&mdash;not spear and shield&mdash;but ineffable
beauty and majesty from the <i>adytum</i> of my soul.
Like Venus rising from the sea, she arose from the
ocean of my thoughts, no vague conception, no fleeting
fancy, but from the very first a personal, distinctive,
individualized creation. Vague and phantasmal,
it is true, in outline, certain and immutable in essence.</p>

<p>I said "Come thou, and thou only, my embodied
dream of beauty, my perfect spirit-bride!"&mdash;and she
came, veiled, but immutable, of unearthly, but of

<!-- page 177 col 2 -->

permanent texture. By day and night I contemplated
her, till the pictured shape became more and
more substantial; till the blue eyes deepened, and
the white shoulders brightened, and the gold-tinged
hair glittered into visible actuality&mdash;until she stood
before me, or hovered round me, a thing to gaze on
without fear of vanishment or fading disillusion, till
in one word, I <i>saw</i> my dream-girl even as I saw my
own image in the mirror!</p>

<p>Scarcely had the phantom become thus incarnate,
than I became aware of the astounding phenomenon
that, having once acquired the power over matter,
and achieved the masterpiece of my ambition, all
minor details and accessories, locality and scenery,
required but an effort of my imagination, and straightway
they became apparent to the senses.</p>

<p>And what may appear more surprising&mdash;if indeed
there be any thing surprising in so simple a matter
as intensified imagination&mdash;is, that at the same time I
found myself possessed of a power over <i>sound</i> which
imparted to my whole experiment a new and dazzling
grandeur of voluptuous enjoyment. All who
have had patience to read thus far, must have felt
that a grand opera, of all descriptions of dramatic
representation, approaches nearest to perfect illusion,
and is at the same time the very highest form of artistic
recreation yet known to man. The spirit of
the <i>master</i>, living in every tone, cadence and harmony
of sounds, wraps the whole in a unity of effect,
which in tragedy, where all depends upon the actors,
is impossible. Besides, music intoxicates the soul,
throws it into an abnormal state of exaltation, and
annihilates the absurdity of details in the embracing
atmosphere of its enchantment.</p>

<p>And I&mdash;I had but to <i>think</i> harmony, to hear it.
An orchestra of infinite magnificence and extent had
become the organ of my will. All limits to tone
were for me annihilated. The awful depth of my
immeasurable score was lost in the abyss, the
piercing ascent played like lightnings amid the
clouds, whilst distant echoes sent back everlasting
accompaniments from the farthest eternities, world
without end!</p>

I did not believe that mortal could have listened
to such music, and lived. Involuntarily&mdash;at least
so it seemed&mdash;I composed now a perpetual series of
tremendous symphonies, full of the sublimest variations
and transitions. The trumpets of ten thousand
angels, the mighty harps of countless Titan
hosts, the drums of legioned thunder-gods&mdash;what
words, what images can I find to convey any impression
of these supernal vibrations of the universe
which emanated from my silent brain, giving a
hundred-fold vividness and truth to the visions by
which I was begirt, and amid which I lived, and
had my being!</p>

<p>I now began to hold conversations with Amata,
the name I had given to my phantom beauty&mdash;conversations,
which it is impossible to record, since
no earthly language could convey the meaning of
those mysterious dialogues, or more correctly speaking,
<i>duos</i>. Our language was melody, and we
never wearied of its interchange.</p>

<!-- page 178 col 1 -->

<p>Nevertheless, I had not hitherto dared thoroughly
to <i>trust</i> my subjugated senses. A hideous dread of
a more hideous awakening, occasionally stole over
me, and I at length resolved to possess all or nothing,
to stretch my acquired supernatural power to the
utmost, and decide my fate forever. Hitherto, I had
not dared to stretch forth my arms toward Amata.
I had been content to dream of burning kisses and
passionate embraces, for my dreams were but reflections
of my waking hallucinations. But now,
with a desperate resolution, like ancient wizard
evoking the god of evil, and risking salvation upon
the chance, I threw all my life into one supreme
volition, and exclaimed to the angelic shape that,
with loosened floating robes of diaphanous texture
stood glowing in beauty before me, "Come to my
heart, Amata! let me live in thee, or die in my despair!"</p>

<p>And lo! immediately, like a white bird settling on
a bough, did the supposed phantom Amata glide smiling
into my arms, fixed upon mine her dewy
lips, upon mine her deep blue eyes of eternal love,
and press to mine her snowy breast, from which no
mortal sculptor might dare to model! Her radiant
hair fell down in silky profusion over both our
shoulders; with unutterable triumph and joy I passed
my hand over her hair, and skin smoother than satin
or ivory, and I exclaimed wildly,</p>

<p>"Amata, Amata! whence comest thou? Art thou,
indeed, but a delusive phantom? Shall I lose thee
as I found thee? Art thou mine or mystery?"</p>

<p>"Fear not, beloved one!" murmured Amata, in
tones more sweet than sounds a crystal struck by
rod of silver. "What can man conceive, that Nature
yields not?"</p>

<!-- page 178 col 2 -->

<p>And even as she spoke, vast chords began to swell,
and the lightning tones to dart, and the deep drums
of the abyss to thunder, and all the universe to
vibrate in sonorous harmony, as, with my lips glued
to Amata's, her bosom pressed to mine&mdash;I slept in
matchless ecstasy!</p>

<p>Thus did I cross the rainbow-bridge, Bifrost, from
earth to heaven, from Mid-gard to Valhalla. And
which of Odin's Valkyrs could rival <i>my</i> Amata?</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Facile is the descent of Avernus! Rapid is the
voyage from the radiant revels of Valhalla to the
infernal shadows of the mist-world Nifelhem, cold
and sombre Hell of the deep-souled, solemn Northmen!</p>

<p>Where am I?&mdash;what hideous world is this, in
which fiends beset my path, that glare upon me with
cold, hungry eyes, then vanish before the flash of
my ever sheathless sword? What phrenzied ghost
stalks grimly through the night's black kingdoms,
outlawed of gods and men&mdash;spirit of despair and
vengeance?</p>

<p>Where is Amata&mdash;my Amata? Answer me, ye
fiends of darkness, on whose heads glitter diadems
of ice, on whose bosoms shine stars and crosses beset
with hailstone pearls!</p>

<p>Where is Amata?&mdash;where is the dead minstrel's
child&mdash;the echo of my dream, the true, the glorious
Amata? Broad, broad is the gulf, broad as the wild
Atlantic! and there comes a whisper in the wind&mdash;a
whisper from Amata,</p>

<p>"I come, I come, beloved one!"</p>

<p>"Daughter of my soul, mine&mdash;<i>mine</i> forever!"</p>

<p>No phantom is AMATA.</p>

<h3>THE GRAND STYLE.</h3>

</div>

<!-- page 418 col 1 -->

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>MAY it please your imperial readership, intelligent
and discriminating unit of this great nation
of emperors and empresses, in which every citizen
is a sovereign in his own right, besides, being
(with few exceptions) a general officer and
editor of a newspaper&mdash;I hereby solemnly propose
that we understand one another distinctly.</p>

<p>I do not wish to steal your patience on false
pretences.</p>

<p>Nor do I wish to frighten you off the ground at
once, by a phantom, which I shall straightway
proceed to exorcise with befitting ceremony.</p>

<p>You have possibly, as one of the great army of
martyrs, read, or tried to read "Burke on the
Sublime and Beautiful." If not; it is of little
consequence. There are occupations which pay
better than reading Burke.</p>

<p>My intention is by no means to compete with
that turgid orator. Whether a man, who could
not comprehend the French Revolution, was equal
to the task of philosophically investigating the
principles of the Sublime and Beautiful, is a
question for retrospective critics, and not for a
go-ahead speculator more than half-way through
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>I do not, therefore, criticise Burke&mdash;I repudiate
him. It is not the same concern. No connection
with the house of Sublime, Beautiful &amp;
Co. Mine is a ready-money business, and conducted
on cash principles. Those who run may
read, or those who read may run&mdash;if they find it
tedious.</p>

<p>The grand <i>style</i> is not the grand <i>thing</i>, nor is a
treatise on "the grand style" an essay on the
<i>grand</i>, but rather on that <i>style</i>, air, manner, form,
or aspect, which the desire for the semblance of
grandeur causes ambition to assume. As in
<i>Peter Schlemihl's</i> story, the shadow is the substance
to be dealt with.</p>

<p>Be not disappointed, my grave friend in spectacles,
with the long hair and the turn-down collar;
nor thou, O azure queen! familiar, doubtless,
with Winkelman, Lessing, and Schlegel, in the

<!-- page 418 col 2 -->

original German; with Phosphor, in his native
Polish, (that sweet Sclavonic Italian;) with Radowitzer,
the light of Upsala's University; and
Lurckensen, the sage of Jutland, not to mention
Glaucopis, the Greek, and Dodonius, the Roman,
(whose treatise, <i>De rebus ignotis pro magnificis</i>,
was translated by Nostradamus, and printed by
Dr. Faustus)&mdash;frown not too harshly on my apparent
frivolity.</p>

<p>Does not all science deal with <i>phenomena</i>,
whilst the essence escapes our analyses?</p>

<p>Did not the late Duke of Wellington, that iron
warrior, himself admit, that he preferred <i>mock
turtle</i> soup to that of genuine amphibious origin,
when taking a "hasty plate of soup" after the
manner of great conquerors?</p>

<p>Was not Tamerlane, the subduer of Asia and
general ravager of empires, passionately addicted
to the mimic battles of the chess-board?</p>

<p>Do not real modern living mesmerised prophet-cobblers
dictate books in magnetic trances about
things they never understood, and find disciples
who put faith in such revelations, notwithstanding
the utter impossibility of ever understanding
them?</p>

<p>Let us then discourse of the Grand Style, leaving
the truly grand to speak for itself when we
encounter it.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>II.</p>

</div>

<p>"What to do, and how to do it&mdash;that, sir, is
the title of the book I should like to publish!"
said the publisher to the author, in a tone as
near enthusiasm as was possible to a publisher.</p>

<p>The author dimly comprehended the supposed
advantages of the speculation, but he understood
the hint and answered accordingly; for, in matters
of business, (cash payments excepted,) authors
are particularly straightforward. They
go straight to the mark; or, as marks and rose
nobles are now out of date, we may say, more
graphically, that they go straight to the dollar,
which is the grand moral centre of all things.</p>

<!-- page 419 col 1 -->

<p>"So you want me to write the book, Mr. Inkum?"
said the author.</p>

<p>"Hum! well, what do you think of the idea,
Mr. Scribble?"</p>

<p>Of course the publisher answered evasively, as
became a man who had money to risk, and meditated
risking it.</p>

<p>"Think?" said Mr. Scribble&mdash;Mr. Heraclitus
Scribble, Author of "Life up a Tree," "The
Philosophy of Nothingness," and "The Last of
the Anthropophagi," a pre&euml;minently damned
tragedy&mdash;"Think, Mr. Inkum, why I think nothing."</p>

<p>"Come, none of your everlasting metaphysics,
Mr. Scribble," groaned Inkum, who had published
the "Philosophy of Nothingness," and
thereby clearly realized the grand dogma, that
"<i>out of nothing, nothing came</i>," which vulgar
error the work was intended to disprove.</p>

<p>"Metaphysics!" exclaimed the author, "<i>nothing</i>"&mdash;the
publisher shuddered, but became reassured
as the philosopher continued&mdash;"nothing
<i>could</i> be farther from my mind, at the present
moment, than to discuss metaphysics in any
shape. I merely was about to observe, that
words are one thing, and ideas another. You
have mentioned the name of a proposed work,
but you have not given even the remotest hint as
to the idea.</p>

<p>"I have <i>not</i>, eh? why, don't you see? <i>What
to do, and how to do it;</i> that's what everybody
wants to know; and a book that will convey the
information will reach a sale large enough to
wear out three sets of stereos!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but what <i>are</i> people to do, and how <i>are</i>
they to do it?" exclaimed the perplexed composer
of a tragedy, to be acted, as Poe's raven
would say, "nevermore."</p>

<p>"How should I know?" said the publisher,
impatiently. "I suggest a book; it is for you,
as a literary man, to find out what to put in it.
I don't sell ideas&mdash;I sell octavos and duodecimos,
thirteen to the dozen, with a discount of ten
to twenty per cent. for cash. <i>You</i> go, and write
two hundred pages, octavo, small pica leaded,
explaining <i>what to do</i>, if you can find out <i>how to
do it;</i> and <i>I</i>'ll give you a hundred dollars down,
and a per-centage on the sale after the first edition.
Now that's what I consider a fair offer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Scribble, who was not a millionaire
like you and I, and wanted a hundred dollars
very particularly. "Yes, certainly, I know
what to do, and that is, write the book, though
Heaven only knows how I am to do it! But I
trust in Providence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you explained in your other book

<!-- page 419 col 2 -->

that there was no Providence?" said Inkum,
with a sardonic grin.</p>

<p>"Very true; I had forgotten," said Scribble,
confusedly; "no matter, you shall see the introductory
chapter to-morrow."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>III.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Washington Scribble walked rapidly along,
and having stimulated his ideas by a
glass of brandy and a cigar, began to think by
the time he was half-way up Chestnut street that,
after all, Inkum's suggestion admitted of a very
extended application.</p>

<p>"What, in fact, is the idea," mused Scribble,
"but an attempt to realize the practical 'philosophy
of everything'&mdash;by the bye, that would
do for a second title, <i>What to do, and how to do
it; or the philosophy of everything</i>. I have it!
Two hundred pages, small pica&mdash;is that allowed
for such an amazingly tall subject? however,
cost what it may I will begin with a solid foundation;
and, of course, a solid foundation can
only be laid in true philosophy&mdash;the real transcendental
business. I flatter myself I've dived
a fathom or two deeper than Emerson, who
shakes out his ideas like pepper out of a caster."
So when he reached home, and took refuge in
his study, in the fifth story, our enthusiastic
philosopher immediately sat down and wrote as
follows:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>WHAT TO DO, AND HOW TO DO IT;</p>

<p class="small">OR</p>

<p>THE PHILOSOPHY OF EVERYTHING.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Book I. Chapter I. Section I.</p>

<p>THE FOUNDATION OF ALL THINGS.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>"In the first place, there is <i>Nothing</i>. Nothing
alone exists&mdash;that is, does <i>not</i> exist; for it is a
contradiction in terms to affirm that Nothing has
any existence. To say that Nothing exists, is to
affirm that <i>that</i> exists of which the sole attribute
is non-existence; which is absurd.</p>

<p>"Nothing is the unconditioned, the unqualified,
the abstract in the abstract, the absolute,
eternal, infinite Inconceivable, that is, Uncreated
Indescribable. (Good!)</p>

<p>"Nothing is, at the same time, Everything;
for <i>Everything</i> is alike unconditioned, unqualified,
Inconceivable, and Uncreated.</p>

<p>"It is only when nothing or everything (for
the terms are convertible) becomes realized as
<i>Something</i>, that, by attaining a phenomenal being,
as a finite and imperfect idea, it can be recognized
in consciousness, while consciousness is
the finite action of the Infinite Nothingness, or

<!-- page 420 col 1 -->

Universal unconditioned Being or <i>Ego</i>, which,
by the experience of the Non Ego exchanges its
negative for a positive state of existence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>"Well, may I be &mdash;&mdash;! may I be made into
double medium and printed off as a handbook, if
I ever read such infernal rubbish!" muttered
Inkum, when he had read thus far in the MS.
confided to him that morning by Scribble, with a
childlike confidence. There were references to
Karl, Schelling, Hegel, Mar-heinecke, and other
later Hegelians in the margin, which completed
Inkum's disgust; for he remembered having ordered
a large package of their works from Germany
for the use of Scribble, and at a very considerable
expense, some year or two before, and
also recollected that the account was as yet
undiminished. When Scribble called to learn the
fate of his MS., Inkum returned it with a brief
intimation that it was "not the sort of thing
he wanted;" and Scribble departed in wrath,
and severely criticised the three next books
Inkum published in a paper he (Scribble) wrote
for. Eventually the rejected MS. was furbished
up as a lecture, and much applauded in Boston,
where the people are more up in transcendentalism
than at New York or Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>IV</p>

</div>

<p>Thus you perceive, reader, the grand and important
work&mdash;"<i>What to do, and how to do it</i>"&mdash;still
remains to be written, because Mr. Scribble
could not help beginning his book at the foundation
of all things, and Mr. Inkum did not understand
transcendentalism.</p>

<p>Much I lament the accident; and for this reason.
The universal character of the work would
doubtless have embraced a difficulty, that would
have saved me the trouble of composing the present
treatise. Doubtless, if he had only had
"rope enough," the profound Scribble would
have shown how easy a matter to accomplish is
that operation, so impossible to all who have
hitherto made the attempt, known in familiar
parlance as&mdash;"doing the grand."</p>

<p>Now I blame nobody for attempting the grand
style, whilst I deplore the fatal possibility, that
the mere fact of one's vainly attempting the
grand, must ensure the inevitable consequence
of succeeding in the little.</p>

<p>Makepeace Thackeray, who does the grand in
his peculiar way, as I shall presently show, has
attacked the question, it seems to me, without
thoroughly comprehending it. Perhaps the deficiency
in that satirist's reasoning faculties, and
the predominance of his perceptive organs,

<!-- page 420 col 2 -->

rendered this mistake inevitable. Thackeray has
evidently never read Scribble's work on the Philosophy
of Nothingness.</p>

<p>Nor would he understand it, if he did.</p>

<p>He lives too much in the concrete, to thoroughly
expand into the abstract. In the boundless
abysses of transcendentalism, his mind
would be like a fish without a tail, or a ship
without a rudder. Thackeray is a materialist
of the most material order, and in the refined
development of his materialism lies the secret of
his strength. He is a very admirable barn-door
cock, and is far too sagacious to attempt to pass
himself off as an eagle.</p>

<p>He never soars; he mostly creeps comfortably
on all fours. He sees a Snob world (in the Carlylian
lingo), himself a Snob, and writes a Snob
book, from a Snob point of view, in a Snob style,
with a Snob moral.</p>

<p>And now the game is fairly started. I feel
that all mock-modesty or mock-mercy would be
out of place, so I shall at once conclude my preface
and dash into the mel&eacute;e.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p class="small">THE GRANDEES OF LITERATURE.</p>

</div>

<p>Literary grandees are of two kinds.</p>

<p>The one would persuade you that they can do
that of which they are naturally incapable.</p>

<p>The other would make you believe that they
are that which they are not.</p>

<p>It may be here observed, that all grandeeism
is virtually an attempt to humbug mortal men.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the grandee must not be confounded
with the humbug proper. They are essentially
different species of the human genus.</p>

<p>The grandee is <i>morally</i> superior to the humbug,
inasmuch as he more or less believes in the
delusion he inculcates.</p>

<p>But the humbug is <i>intellectually</i> superior to the
grandee, because he knows what he is about, and
laughs at the superstition he promulgates.</p>

<p>The grandee is the result of vanity.</p>

<p>The humbug is the product of self-esteem.</p>

<p>Physiologically and psychologically considered,
both are victims of monomania, like the majority
of this mad world. But as <i>Hamlet</i> has
been written, and I have a wholesome horror of
falling into the category of which <i>bore</i> is the cognomen,
I shall not pursue this line of investigation
at present.</p>

<p>It is enough to let the unfortunate reader feel
occasionally that the illustrious Scribble's pupil
is not utterly unworthy of so profound a master
as the Author of the "Philosophy of Nothingness."</p>

<!-- page 421 col 1 -->

<p>Nothing is so easy as to be profound. You let
yourself down by degrees, plunging into a fresh
abyss of mystery at each step, till the bottomless
pit of Infinite "Nobody-knows-what-ism" receives
you and your listeners, and&mdash;you awake
to a consciousness that it is late, look at your
watch, and go home to your wife if you have
one; if not, you go home to your boarding-house
and the desolation of bachelorhood. (<i>Anathema
sit!</i>)</p>

<p>Before going to bed, always, if you will, take
the advice of a modern Democritus, read an
essay or two of Emerson. The next morning
write out a lucid summary of their contents, in a
brief form. I know no better exercise for the
mind. If you have no work of Emerson's at
hand, a chapter of any book of Thomas Carlyle
will equally answer the purpose.</p>

<p>But do not imagine that the task is a mere trifle,
as easy as saying one's prayers, or writing a
newspaper leader.</p>

<p>These pre&euml;minent grandees, I may say, supreme
Magnificos, are genii which no fisherman
(or fisher of men), Arabian, or otherwise, has yet
found means to re-enclose in a portable jar of
earthenware&mdash;were it even their own proper
crania.</p>

<p>The smoke-giants they have developed into,
are not to be tricked into condensation, even for
a moment, in order that the quick hand of synthesis
should clap down the lid of reason, and
make potted philosophers of them for all time.</p>

<P>A summary of Emerson and Carlyle! Put
chaos in a nutshell! Construct an hour-glass for
eternity! Count the stars, number the waves,
enchain the winds! Convert Judge Edmonds &amp;
Co. to reason! but deem not that any mortal
<i>Mantalini</i> can divine the "dem'd total" of Carlyle
and Emerson.</p>

<p>Methinks that startled readers exclaim aghast,
"What sayest thou, audacious stranger? Son
of the night, emergent from obscurity? What
awful profanities are these? What insensate
youth art thou, that thus invadest the majesty
of the Olympian gods?</p>

<p>To this I answer by a parable.</p>

<p><i>Minos</i> the king of Crete (post-mortem judge of
Tartarus) was a wise man in his day-three
thousand years and odd ago. But a stranger
came to Crete, a wiser man than Minos. That
stranger's name was <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>, who, by his surpassing
genius and science, constructed wings to
fly from the prison of Minos. Likewise D&aelig;dalus
constructed a <i>man of brass</i>, who did many wonderful
things.</p>

<p>From this man of brass some of us are perchance

<!-- page 421 col 2 -->

descended. Hence, the impudence of
certain men ceases to be a wonder.</p>

<p>Besides, to stick to the old Greeks, and profit
by their lessons, did not Hercules beard Pluto in
Hades, and steal his dog Cerberus, in scorn of
all codes penal and Acherontian?</p>

<p>Better to be a hero, were it only a grandee-hero,
than a hero-worshiper&mdash;too surely a grandee
hero-worshiper.</p>

<p>Don Quixote for ever!</p>

<p>Leave folly to its fate, but do not dream to stop
it in full charge.</p><p>

Oromasdes and Osiris have fallen, the sacred
Ibis stands stuffed under a glass case in "Upper-ten"
<i>Salons;</i> the mystic crocodile is exhibited in
a wooden tub, admission 12&half; cents. The Arch
Magus, Zoroaster, has followed Orpheus and his
mysteries to oblivion's maelstrom; Odin the
brave is forgotten by his children, who prefer
brandy in a bar-room to beer in Valhalla; Budh
himself, and Fo his other self, even now tremble
in their pagodas, at the shouts of Chinese <i>sans
culottes;</i> Homer is suspected to be a forgery, or an
old number of an ancient Hellenic Magazine; Zeus
has abandoned Olympus to Mahommed and the
Sultan. Old gods and kings, and old god and
king-makers are deposed and exiled to bookland.
Every dog has his day, and new dogs bark in
their turn.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, if a wild scoffer at established
things, men, ideas, institutions, and grandees,
launch his Viking galley, and Northman-like,
makes reckless war upon the throned kings
of letters, the temporary demigods of thought.
Surely truth is great, and <i>will</i> prevail. Why
then fear discussion, free and fearless? <i>Aux
armes citoyens!</i></p>

<p>"Indeed," said the unknown gentleman in the

<p>"It is almost a cavity," resumed the operator.</p>

<p>VII.</p>

</div>

<p>Is Thomas Carlyle a politician?</p>

<p>Is Ralph Waldo Emerson a philosopher?</p>

<p>Conscientiously, I feel myself constrained to
answer in the negative. I might qualify, but
the question supposed is categorical.</p>

<p>To begin with Carlyle.</p>

<p>His style being one of barbaric ornament and
of a composite order, with an undue preponderance
of the <i>Germanic</i> element, is naturally obscure
and perplexing to the ordinary reader.</p>

<p>This style is not original. Those who have
read <i>Hoffmann</i> and <i>Jean Paul</i>, not to mention
<i>Goethe</i>, or the German metaphysicians, (<i>Kant</i>,
<i>Hegel</i>, <i>Schelling</i>, and <i>Fichte</i>,) must, at a glance,
recognize the stolen plumage of this fierce Teutonic
Scotchman.</p>

<p>Such unnatural transportations of the forms of
one language into another, are by no means uncommon
or peculiar to the author of <i>Sartor
Resartus</i>.</p>

<p>We have Anglo-Greek, Anglo-Latin, Anglo-French,
Anglo-Arabian, and Anglo-Hebrew writers.
Then perhaps the German idioms having
more freshly emerged from barbarism, are of all
the most troublesome and objectionable.</p>

<p>Now, I do not say that it is not advisable to
enrich our native English from the spoils of every
other language under the sun, by the adoption
of new words and phrases of which Johnson was
innocent; but I do most confidently assert that
a writer who can be so easily captivated by the
<i>mere forms</i> of an <i>inferior</i> and less highly developed
tongue than his own, displays a weakness of
judgment and an incompetence in art, which at
once decides against him, any claim he may put
forward to a position in the foremost ranks of his
country's literature.</p>

<p>Shakspeare was no purist in style, but he wrote
English English, as did Spenser, Marlowe, and
even Milton, with all his Latin! Hume wrote
English, in the most English order, and Gibbon
showed what splendor and magnificence our language
was capable of, by rivaling Tacitus and
Livy on their own ground. Goldsmith wrote
with a simplicity and ease equally admirable.
Byron, Shelley and Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
and a host of lesser poets, have illustrated gloriously
the powers and resources of the English
tongue; whilst Hope in his <i>Anastasius</i> produced
a model of a prose style rarely equalled. In
later times we have had Washington Irving and
Cooper, De Quincy <i>the opium eater</i>, George Brown
the author of <i>Lavengro</i>, Edgar Poe, Hawthorne,
and other admirable tale writers, not to mention
Bulwer, Marryat, Dickens, Thackeray, and Hermann

<!-- page 422 col 2 -->

Melville, to whose doings we shall hereafter
refer more particularly.</p>

<p>All these men write English. So does Leitch
Richie, Charles Mackay, and Robert Chambers,
author of the "<i>Vestiges of Creation</i>." So do
Tennyson, Browning, Bryant, Longfellow, Read,
Stoddard, and even that most turgid essayist
and versifyer, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and
that most dreary prejudiced and stupid of historians
and political charlatans, Alison.</p>

<p>So does not Carlyle.</p>

<p>As a mere writer, or artistic stylist, he is literally
a <i>Goth</i>. Nay more, he is a Grandee in style,
or, as he himself would phrase it, a great sham
and solemnly constituted impostor.</p>

<p>Such mummery or flummery, such artificial
"Salmoneus-thunder," may impose on English
boys fresh from Oxford or Cambridge, with little
in their heads but tufts, ticks, and trilogies, may
dazzle the weak minds of aspiring and literary
law-students, and young embryo editors; but for
us, who have</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Seen the glory, heard the music,"</p>

</div>

<p>of Time's vast muster-roll of inspired Demigods,
rulers, makers, and teachers of the earth, the
rattle of such clumpsy stage properties, excites
but a mild pity for the bad taste shown in its
employment.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the form.</p>

<p>Now let us consider the substance.</p>

<p>Are we to recognize in this furious denouncer
of imposture, this ardent advocate of hero-worship,
a true high-priest of thought; or again, to
quote his own strange dialect, a "phantasm-captain"
and political Bombastes Furioso?</p>

<p>It would be easy to take the latter ground,
easy to defend it. But we must not condemn the
good nut for its rude shell.</p>

<p>Beneath all the barbaric theatre properties,
and bombastic jargon of Anglocised Germanism,
moves and lives an honest, brave and truth-loving
spirit.</p>

<p>Carlyle is in earnest, evidently. What he is
so desperately earnest in, is by no means equally
evident.</p>

<p>Let us endeavor to seize some of his leading
characteristics.</p>

<p>Like Mephistopheles in Goethe's prologue,
Carlyle "finds everything heartily bad" in this
"best of all possible worlds." As the Irishman
phrased it, "mankind is a great blackguard;" as
the wiser Yankee remarked, "human nature is a
d&mdash;d fool!" In short, Carlyle, like Hamlet, sees
that "the times are out of joint," and appears to
think that he, Carlyle, in default of a modern

<!-- page 423 col 1 -->

Cromwell or other hero "turning up," is about
the man to "set them right," or at least impart
a broad hint as to how that desirable end may be
compassed.</p>

<p>For this purpose, he suggests hero-worship
(possibly as a substitute for heroism itself) and the
general putting down of shams, and setting up of
the real thing in their place. He seems to think
that the best man ought to have the best place,
without any very clear idea as to how the best
man is to be recognized. Finally, in his plans
for <i>world reform</i>, Carlyle falls back upon the
somewhat primitive resource of simple despotism
and "<i>making</i> Quashee (the negro) work," whatever
may be his preference for idleness and
pumpkin; also, this Latterday Luther suggests
that with reference to the lazy Irish, after trying
argument, flogging, and one or two other mild
expedients, shooting and throwing them over the
bridge might prove a sufficient reason, at all
hazards, for their conversion.</p>

<p>"Work, man," says, or quotes Carlyle, "thou
hast all eternity to rest in."</p>

<p>"Rest, man, thou hast all eternity to work
in," might respond a believer in the soul's immortality,
with equal propriety.</p>

<p>"Work," says Carlyle, "work! work! work!
But what is work, sir preacher? Is <i>my</i> work,
<i>your</i> work, anybody's work the same? Who is
to decide <i>what is work</i>, or where idleness leaves
off, and work begins."</p>

<p>Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the wisest and noblest
of the German transcendentalists, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"The end of the life of mankind on earth is,
that in this life they may order all their relations
with freedom according to reason."</p>

<p>Observe, <i>freedom</i> controlled by <i>reason</i> is the
dogma. What amount of freedom controlled by
reason Thomas Carlyle would leave us were he
prime minister of the Universal Commonwealth,
may be gleaned from a few significant details
sparingly scattered through the rabid denunciations,
prophesies of utter destructions, and vague
generalities, with which his works are filled. For
example:</p>

<p>Carlyle suggests giving the <i>crown</i> the right to
appoint members of parliament, thus opening a
prospect of intrigue and corruption yet undreamed
of in England, with all its aristocratic abuses,
and, at the same time, forgetting that such <i>crown
nominees</i> could never be regarded by the people
as on an equality with their elected representatives.
Carlyle denounces universal suffrage, on
the ground, we presume, of the ignorance of the
masses, quite forgetting that a motive to think
inevitably leads to thinking, and that slavery

<!-- page 423 col 2 -->

and ignorance are inevitable concomitants. Carlyle
distinctly advocates <i>brute force</i> for reform
purposes, quite overlooking the necessity of all
movements being carried out by individual and
fallible men, certain (if entrusted with the power)
to become tyrants and slave drivers. Yet Carlyle
ridicules and abuses kings, peers, parliaments,
and all princes, potentates, and powers
whatsoever, as heartily as any one. The great
difficulty is to find out what he really proposes
to do, beyond a general upsetting of the powers
that be. The moment he ventures to quit his
prophet's tripod, and abandon declamation for
legislation, he breaks down utterly. As Schiller
said of Voltaire, "an excellent hammer to break,
but not a trowel to build." Carlyle is not constructive
or inventive. He never originated an
idea in his life. His merit lies in the force of
his enthusiasm for the ideas he has adopted. In
history he fails completely. Notwithstanding
his talent for inventing nicknames, and his calling
Robespierre "the sea-green incorruptible,"
he has little appreciation for character beyond a
dim adoration of spiritual <i>force</i>. In political
discussion, Carlyle is again useless, succeeding
only in invective. It might be considered injurious
to laud D'Israeli as the "lineal descendant
of the impenitent thief;" but it was certainly not
a logical proof of that statesman's incompetency.
Carlyle is no judge of men. He mistook Sir
Robert Peel for the "coming man," and next
week (after a life of old-fogy opposition to reform
and impudent adoption at the last moment
of reform measures,) Sir Robert died, and Carlyle
was left without a hero.</p>

<P>Carlyle is a literary grandee of the first class;
but I believe that no scholar, statesman, or
serious student of human nature, can honestly
speak of him as a great man. There is, I admit,
a fragmentary vastness about him, which
predisposes in his favor, but neither the mathematician
nor the philosopher can recognize totalities
in fragments; for it is an axiom in science
that "the part is not equal to the whole."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;</p>

<p>It was at a London party. A tall man, with
a broad Scotch accent, had pinned a meek-looking
gentleman against the wall, and was indoctrinating
him with the true principles of hero-worship.
Finally&mdash;disgusted with the meek gentleman's
indifference&mdash;the enthusiastic Scotchman was
heard to wind up his harangue by these awful
words:</p>

<p>"And indeed, mon, it's becoming every instant
more clear to me, that ye have not the remotest
idea of what a hero is!"</p>

<!-- page 424 col 1 -->

<p>The Scotchman was Carlyle.</p>

<p>Lest the reader should take me for a counterpart
of the meek gentleman, (which my natural
meekness might well suggest,) I shall here, apropos
of hero-worship, make a few remarks on
heroes, which, being a digression, may be skipped,
if objected to by straightlaced readers, who
deem the road of thought a railroad, and a
straight line the shortest cut between two ideas.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>VIII.</p>

<p class="small">INTERMEZZO.</p>

</div>

<p>Strictly speaking, the world has produced, and
the poets sung, but two heroes&mdash;the fighting hero
and the teaching hero; the warrior, and the poet,
prophet, or discoverer of truth.</p>

<p>The greatest hero, the hero pre&euml;minently, combines,
in one person, the qualities of both.</p>

<p>Indeed the poet (that is the <i>creator</i>) is rarely
deficient in the qualities of the warrior; nor is
the great warrior utterly deficient in the powers
of the creative intellect.</p>

<p>At the dawn of poetry these two types of the
hero were seized upon by intellects so mighty,
that all after ages have done nothing but copy
their creations. I allude to the ACHILLES of
Homer, and the PROMETHEUS of &AElig;schylus.</p>

<p>Achilles is the model of the warrior-hero, and
the living, impassioned man. He is the ideal of
a prince, a noble gentleman, a friend, a lover,
and a soldier!</p>

<p>All the heroes of ordinary poems, novels and
melodramas, are his feeble shadows.</p>

<p>He is the Rinaldo of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered&mdash;he
is the knight-errant of all chivalric
stories&mdash;he is "our hero" par excellence&mdash;the
hero of all young ladies' dreams. He is Alexander
the Great, he is Mark Anthony, he is
Julian the Apostate, he is Belisarius, he is King
Arthur, he is Roland the Brave, he is the hero
of the Crusades, and of the war of the Roses, and
of the wars between France and England, and he
has a statue in Hyde Park London as Duke of
Wellington, most appropriately. He is the aristocratic
hero&mdash;the great fighting man of civilization.</p>

<p>ULYSSES is the transition from the Achilles to
the Prometheus; whose sublime and hitherto
unapproachable grandeur Homer dimly anticipated.
He is the man of letters and the statesman,
as well as the warrior. He is in particular
the <i>great explorer and navigator</i>. This peculiarity
had almost justified us in classing him as a positively
third type of the hero. Ulysses is the
&AElig;neas of Virgil, the Hamlet of Shakspeare, the
Corsair of Byron, the Leatherstocking of Cooper,

<!-- page 424 col 2 -->

the Rob Roy and Dugald Dalgetty of Scott, the
hero of all Bulwer's novels, when not simply
Achillean, and is realized as Columbus in his
highest form, an idea which Tennyson has well
grasped in his little poem "Ulysses," from which
I cite a few lines, not often surpassed by the
poets of this world:</p>

<p class="small">"My purpose holds<br/>

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br/>

Of all the western stars, until I die.<br/>

It may be that the gulf will wash us down,<br/>

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br/>

And see the great Achilles whom we knew."</p>

<p>This forward looking from the dim past into a
dim future, reminds me of a passage, the very
converse, in Marlowe's Faustus, (a speculative
Ulysses, the type of Goethe's Faust,) which has
lingered in my memory, after many long years
of adventurous wanderings, during which my
library has at length reduced itself to&mdash;"memory's
volumes stored within the brain."</p>

<p>Mephistopheles, at the request of Faustus, has
raised for him the phantom of Helen, the most
beautiful of her sex, and Faustus thus apostrophizes
the renowned mistress of Paris:</p>

<p class="small">"Is <i>this</i> the face that launched a thousand ships,<br/>

And burned the topmost towers of Illium?<br/>

O, Helen, <i>make me immortal by a kiss!</i>"</p>

<p>The heart that does not thrill at the exquisite
power and dreamy passion of these lines, is, I
venture to maintain, a hard case for the poet of
<i>any</i> age.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, Oliver Goldsmith and Lord
Byron, are all of the Ulysses order, however
widely they differ in details of character. The
late Louis Philippe was a queer old Ulysses,
most assuredly, and the present Louis Napoleon
is an Ulysses of the ferocious order.</p>

<p>But the Ulyssean type is most interesting and
remarkable for a cause, which, in all the commentaries
on Homer, I never yet remember to
have seen mentioned. <i>Homer evidently is himself
Ulysses</i>. It is his own wonderful life and adventures
that the poet is virtually singing, whilst
allegorizing the events of the wandering and adventurous
experience. This I divined, by the
unerring poetic intuition, at my very first perusal
of the Odyssey. Furthermore, I recognized as
indubitable the following facts, from internal
evidence in the two poems of Homer.</p>

<p>1. That Homer was a man of rank, a king,
perhaps, or military leader of his time, and that
the story of the blind old beggarman was a mere
fable, probably without any foundation, save in
the fact that Homer met with misfortunes, and

<!-- page 425 col 1 -->

wandered from city to city, seeing many reverses
of fortune.</p>

<p>2. That, <i>originally</i>, the Iliad and Odyssey,
certain episodes apart, were <i>written by their
author's own hand</i>; for which belief, I shall one
day give my reasons to the public, on which
occasion I shall show that <i>writing</i> was common
in Greece at a much earlier age than is generally
admitted.</p>

<p>But to revert to the pure heroic type&mdash;the
Achilles&mdash;for a brief space. Let us sum up his
virtues in a few words.</p>

<p>1. He is brave&mdash;the bravest of the brave.</p>

<p>2. He is beautiful. His exterior corresponds
with his interior being.</p>

<p>3. He is a true friend, as exemplified by his
affection for Patroclus.</p>

<p>4. He is an ardent lover; witness his fury and
grief at the loss of Briseis.</p>

<p>5. He is <i>reasonable and self sacrificing;</i> for he
nobly forbears, out of patriotic motives, either
to slay Agamemnon, who has most deeply
wronged him, or to sow dissension in the camp
of the Greeks; whilst asserting his dignity by
withdrawing his all-powerful aid from the men
who had wronged him.</p>

<p>Every one must feel, after this analysis, that
the Achilles of Homer is the type of the moral
and physical hero of all time, and must be so as
long as man is animated by the same passions
and instincts as at present.</p>

<p>The Prometheus of &AElig;schylus is, on the other
hand, the embodied triumph of spirit over
matter.</p>

<p>Prometheus the Titan, warring against Jupiter
the king of gods and men, is Genius warring
against falsehood and brute force in all ages.</p>

<p>Prometheus, chained to the rock of Caucasus,
for "doing good to man," is the representative
of unconquerable intellect, and the supreme
courage of faith in eternal life and truth. The
vulture gnawing at the liver of the great inventor
of the arts, is the persecution, neglect and insult
which men of science and inventors have in all
ages encountered.</p>

<p>Prometheus is the type of the thinker and the
reformer. He fights not for glory, but for the
right. He endures not in wrath, but in consciousness
of his foreknowledge of the future. Prometheus
is the impersonation of Democracy contending
with the Aristocratic oppressors of
Olympus.</p>

<p>Achilles is a man, Prometheus is a god.</p>

<p>He is humanity incarnate: He is indeed
"Earth's noblest son." He is a prophetic vision
of that "Son of Man," whose mighty word and

<!-- page 425 col 2 -->

mightier sacrifice were to destroy the Greek civilization
forever. In real life, as in Poetry, he is
yet without an antitype.</p>

<p>He is Pythagoras, (and &AElig;schylus was a Pythagorean,)
Zoroaster, Luther and Gallileo. The
Satan of Milton is his shadow, pale with
distance. Napoleon the Great is but a dwarfed
Prometheus; yet he, too, was <i>chained to the rock
of torment</i>, by his brutal captors. When a true
Prometheus appears, he revolutionizes the earth.
He is the incarnation of the ideal man, and the
kings of this world tremble at the echo of his
footsteps, for then established things crumble,
and old lies vanish, and a new impetus is given
to the life of mortals by a new truth revealed to
them.</p>

<p>And so, for the present, I will end my discourse
upon Heroes.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>IX.</p>

</div>

<p>If Carlyle sins by rudeness of style, and want
of originality, save in the invention of odd compound
words, Emerson, on the contrary, is perfectly
English in his style, and most abundant in
original ideas.</p>

<p>His obscurity (and I&mdash;having always found
Emerson more or less obscure&mdash;can only speak
from my own impressions) arises not alone from
a certain indistinctness in his sentences, or even
in his ideas, but from an utter want of system in
their arrangement. There is no regular sequence
in Emerson's remarks. The cause of this is his
tendency to repeat the same idea in so many
forms, that a certain confusion is the result.</p>

<p>Emerson comes to be convicted of grandeeism
in so honorable a manner, that we half suspect
his weakness to be his strength, or his vice his
virtue. He is like a rich spendthrift who cannot
restrain himself from throwing away his money.
His overflowing wealth of ideas produces a sort
of Niagara Fall, in which the general stream
is broken into spray, during its prodigious descent.
Emerson's power of analysis is so wonderful that
his power of synthesis can by no means keep
pace with it. He is a sort of Bacon of experimental
thoughts; a Shakspeare of transcendental
ideas. He is great, pure, noble, and brilliant;
he is perhaps the greatest thinker in America.
<i>But</i>&mdash;these terrible buts!&mdash;he cannot be said to
have discovered a principle, or founded a system.
He is perhaps the intermediate stage between the
German transcendentalists and the <i>New Science</i>,
in which physics and metaphysics are to be forever
reconciled.</p>

<p>And this new science? who are its teachers&mdash;what
are its dogmas? Reader, this is not the

<!-- page 426 col 1 -->

time for philosophy. It will depend on the editor
of "Graham" whether, in the pages of that popular
magazine, the question thus supposed is to be answered.</p>

<p>Yet, before leaving Emerson, let me declare
one thing, that he is too great a thinker even to
dream of <i>finality</i> in thought, or for an instant to
imagine himself aught but a pilgrim of intelligence
on the long highroad of eternity. The all-sufficient
vanity and domineering oppression of
Carlyle are strange to Emerson.</p>

<p>But we have too long detained the perhaps impatient
reader in this lofty and perhaps to many
uncongenial region. Let us descend to the plains,
and look out for less formidable game. Let us
redeem a promise, and say a few words about
that very popular grandee, William Makepeace
Thackeray.</p>

<p>This successful writer owes his success, as indeed
do many who attain a sudden popularity, to
a superabundance of vital energy, combined
with a comparatively low order of intelligence.
His perceptives are strongly developed, and with
more constructiveness and ideality would have
made him a good artist. As it is, he is only a
caricaturist, and but a very indifferent poet.</p>

<p>Your most successful men with the masses are
men of detail, because they are more easily understood.</p>

<p>The genius, on the other hand, which is the
concomitant of more equally developed faculties,
rises too far above the level of ordinary intelligence
to obtain a circle of real admirers speedily.
For example, everybody can appreciate Thackeray,
whilst the friends of Goethe or Shelley have
to be found here and there dotted over the vast
surface of humanity.</p>

<p>Thackeray's works are "adapted to the comprehension
of the meanest intelligence." Perhaps
it would not be unjust to say, that the
meaner the intelligence the better he is understood.
He is the great comparative anatomist
of the lower orders, or, to speak more correctly
and zoologically, the inferior <i>species</i> of the human
genius. His "subjects" are all persons of a
most commonplace and insignificant kind; specimens,
in fact, to use his favorite phrase, of the
snob and the flunky. His powers lie only in describing
vice and meanness; his virtuous characters
are mere masks, names, clothes-pegs; in
stage parlance, walking ladies and gentlemen,
pitiful "supers." A fine nature is beyond
Thackeray's capacity to delineate. He either
cannot imagine one, or does not believe in such
an entity. As a portrayer of men and manners
Thackeray is immeasurably behind Balzac, the

<!-- page 426 col 2 -->

late French novelist, (whom all the new French
school follow,) whose collected writings, under
the title of "The Comedy of Human Life," form
the most perfect gallery of French characteristics
conceivable. Bulwer and Dickens are far more
versatile than Thackeray, who seems rather to
vary the social circumstances of his puppets than
their mental idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>The characters which in "Vanity Fair" were
novel, in "Pendennis" became insipid. As for
the "Newcomes," a cultivated man must find a
difficulty in reading it at all. In "Pendennis"
the <i>hero</i> (?) is an absolute failure. He is so
miserable a puppy that we should scarcely notice
the existence of such a being in society, unless
to avoid it. He is tiresome even to read about,
though not so tiresome as Captain Dobbin in
Vanity Fair, or Warrington, the shadow of nobody
in particular, Pendennis's pipe-smoking
Mentor. The wicked little Blanche Amory is,
of course, a repetition, in a new dress, of the
wicked little "Becky" of Vanity Fair, the only
approximation to a <i>type</i> which Thackeray has
succeeded in producing. And all credit to him
for that <i>one</i> creation, since it is the greatest his
art can afford. Bulwer has created but one&mdash;Pelham;
and that a poor one. Cooper has given
us but one, and that a grand one, in his immortal
Leatherstocking. But Dickens&mdash;O Dickens!
what a host of well-known old familiar faces
arise at the bare mention of his name! To name
them would be to write a catalogue&mdash;a directory.
Truly, had not Shakspeare a prior claim to the
title, Dickens might well be called the "King of
the Typists."</p>

<p>From the causes above mentioned, we are not
surprised to find the hideous hallucination of
<i>Grandeeism</i> (which, by the way, in its extreme
forms sends so many great "emperors," "prophets,"
and "Jupiters omnipotent and cloud-compelling,"
to the madhouse) developed to a
degree more astonishing than pleasing.</p>

<p>Those who call Thackeray a "<i>good-natured</i>
humorist" are silly people who never anatomized
a man's brain in their lives, or studied "the
proper study of mankind" to any purpose.</p>

<p>Thackeray, pecuniary considerations apart,
shows to the deeper view of the critical student,
but one aim and end in all he writes, and that
so supremely ridiculous that we have long hesitated
to describe it, lest to American readers it
should appear incomprehensible. This aim is
the ambition <i>to convince us that he (Thackeray) is
a man of social position, and admitted to the best
English society!!!</i> This anxiety, which may be
distinctly traced in almost every page of his

<!-- page 427 col 1 -->

writings, proves conclusively, what to those who
know England and its aristocracy of birth, pride
and wealth, requires no proof, that Thackeray
has been unsuccessful in making his way into
certain circles of more fortunate social grandees.
For be it known to the reader, and I care not if
the same measure be applied to myself which I
mete out to others, that <i>A writer can but write&mdash;himself.</i>
In fact, every man's works are the
shadow of his own mind, and by them is it to be
known and judged.</p>

<p>Thackeray, like many Englishmen of good
education but obscure origin, finding himself in
that Malebolge to personal vanity, the confines
of the upper and middle classes in England, felt
the iron enter his soul and there canker, till
youth and fortune dissipated, he endeavored to
cure the yet lingering disease by the bitter device
of blaspheming and sneering at the idols he
had worshiped, and still <i>malgre lui</i> adored and
envied.</p>

<p>Poor man! It is, to souls which soar above
satire, a tragic sight to see the feeble ferocity
with which Thackeray caricatures a noble lord or
scarifies a real fashionable dandy! The best of
it is he cannot hurt them. It is not the quills of
the "fretful porcupine" but the claws of the
kingly lion, which the giraffe of the desert dreads.
Thackeray is like a boy making faces at eagles
in a cage. His secret awe of their cold scornful
eyes renders his satire purely phosphorescent.
It is far otherwise when he attacks the middle
classes of England. He makes <i>them</i> feel that
they are snobs indeed! As to their utter inferiority
to the aristocracy of birth, he leaves no
room for doubt in their minds! For my part,
did I not pity that class of Englishmen sufficiently
from my profound knowledge of their meanness
and of the political and social causes of their
moral degradation, I should despise them for the
most snobish of all their snobisms, their stupid
admiration of Thackeray, their pitiless and incessant
pasquinader!</p>

<p>I do not blame Thackeray for ridiculing these
people. It would be difficult for me to express
severely enough my loathing for a class, who,
whilst cringing with abject servility to the aristocracy
that openly scorns them, is callously
hostile to the cries of pauperism in its agony, of
honest working men vainly demanding justice,
and indeed to every sentiment, but the love of
gain, or, what in England is the same thing, the
abiding dread of poverty, that spectre, which
haunts every Englishman's dreams, and tightens
every man's purse strings.</p>

<p>Hence, to the poor man, England is a hell

<!-- page 427 col 2 -->

worse than any priests have yet reported! There
is but one resource for the man afflicted by that
moral taint, that stigma of impardonable sin, that
abhorred leprosy in England&mdash;<i>flight</i>&mdash;flight to
some land where there is room for human feelings
and for human beings.</p>

<p>I do not blame Thackeray for satirizing English
traders. What I condemn is the mean character
of his satire. He attacks only the form, the
shell, the manner, the dialect. The deep-seated
moral vice of transatlantic society escapes his
blunted worldly conscience. He has no morals
either good or bad. He is a skeptic and a
materialist to the backbone. Life to him is
purely phenomenal&mdash;a mere volume of careless
caricatures of which he carelessly turns the
pages.</p>

<p>I should not have devoted so much space to the
criticism of this writer, were it not that he has
been the father of a most deplorable school of
slipshod <i>social</i> authors, whose imitations of their
master's style are so close as to occasionally deceive
the judgment of the best critics.</p>

<p>Doubtless more than one mistook the sketches
in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, in which the experiences
of "Don Bobtail Fandango" were revealed, for
genuine Thackerayian effusions; and, if not
published in Putnam, the "Potiphar Papers"
might have almost received a similar compliment.
With the exception of an impertinent and very
vulgar bore, who is constantly introduced in these
papers as the Nubian consul, or something of
the sort, these imitations of Thackeray are very
decently executed. We do not think that their
author, who is, we consider, a young man of
talent, has chosen wisely his model. No matter,
honor to the careful copyist of Egyptian monsters
as of Greek beauty. Each man to his trade.
Some fish inhabit ponds, some the ocean; each
according to his destiny, or as <i>Hawk-eye</i> would
say, his "gifts."</p>

<p>As for the rest of the Thackerayians, since we
do not wish to make personal enemies of every
literary snob in Flunkeydom, we shall leave their
catalogue to the acumen of the reader.</p>

<p>Of all grandeeism, social grandeeism, that is
the impertinent assumption of social superiority,
is at once the most pitiful and the most disagreeable.
In America this wretched disease of
the brain is, I am delighted to acknowledge, uncommon.
It exists only in those of European
origin, and those whom a residence in Europe
has tainted with the aristocratic fever and ague.
That is, feverish craving for acknowledgment of
their position, agueish dread of finding it questioned. 
A word, by the way, with respect to

<!-- page 428 col 1 -->

Europeans. The instant they ostentatiously assert
their grandeur of position in English society
(and in other nations this disease is rare), make
up your mind that insignificance and obscurity
was their portion in the old world, and peremptorily
discountenance their silly pretensions in
the new. The man who makes a point of telling
me that he is a gentleman, invariably raises a
doubt in my mind as to whether he is even a
man. True dignity asserts itself silently and
irresistibly.</p>

<p>A very comic example of burlesque grandeeism
was given by a young English Lord (by courtesy)
named <i>John Manners</i>, who wound up a copy of
verses, which he had the weakness to print, and
dedicate to his friend Smith (<i>which</i> Smith I cannot
remember) with these remarkable words&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Let laws and learning, art and freedom die<br/>

But give us still our old nobility!"</p>

<p>However, we excuse a lordling for imagining that
lords were a necessary institution. We get on
<i>here</i> pretty well without them, it seems to me.</p>

<p>At all hazards, till I find myself a man of
fortune, possessor of at least two new coats and
a leader of fashion, I shall have the brutality to
regard your writers about "High Life," of the
Thackeray school, as anything but intellectual
paragons. In fine, reader, suppose we both
make up our minds to reserve our admiration for
grandeeism till grandeur knocks at our own
doors. We can then afford to be generous. At
present, we will enjoy the rugged satisfaction of
being just.</p>

<h3>THE MAGNETIC PORTRAITS.</h3>

</div>

<!-- [Saturday Press. 30 Oct. 1858: 1] -->

<!-- page 1 col 1 -->

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>It was in Berlin I first saw the Professor Ariovistus
Dunkelheim. I found him seated in his
studio, smoking a pipe, with a spiral glass tube
six feet long, whose glittering convolutions absolutely
dazzled the eye-sight. His head was bald,
saving a kind of scalp-lock that came down to a
point over the centre of his forehead, and two
tufts at the side so stiff and wiry that they resembled
horns, and gave the professor an aspect
which reminded me of the popular portraits of
Satan.</p>

<p>His large, long, bottle-green eyes, with coal-black
lashes, and brows that nearly met, had a
most unpleasant expression of critical penetration.
His nose was thin and beak-like, his mouth
a line, which a great artist might have drawn by
one masterly stroke of the pencil. His visage
was long, and in stature he was very tall. This
became apparent as he rose, on my entering the
apartment.</p>

<p>"I have heard," said I, "Herr Professor,
that you have effected some very curious improvements
in the daguerreotype?"</p>

<p>"Improvements!" replied the Professor, with
suppressed disdain; "I believe Newton <i>improved</i>
on the system of Ptolemy. Improvements, indeed!
So they call a new science&mdash;the most
wonderful science ever invented&mdash;an <i>improvement?</i>
No, sir, my <i>invention</i> has no more to do
with Daguerre's crude experiments, than the man
in the moon with the London Bible Society!
Look here! you see this polished plate of steel&mdash;is
it not a perfect mirror?"</p>

<p>"Perfect&mdash;the reflection is exact!"</p>

<p>"I can <i>fix</i> that reflection."</p>

<p>"As I see it?"</p>

<p>"As you see it. But I can do more&mdash;do
that to which the mere fixing of the reflection
is a trifle. However, my hours are precious.
I was just meditating on an electric telegraph
without wires, as you entered, and had all but
mastered the details. Excuse my asking you at
once, what is your object in calling upon me?"</p>

<p>"To learn whether you are prepared to take
for me, by your newly-invented process, two portraits,
the one of myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"Of a lady."</p>

<p>"An old lady&mdash;a grandmother?"</p>

<p>"A beautiful girl of nineteen&mdash;the loveliest
woman in Berlin."</p>

<p>"Your mistress?"</p>

<p>"My betrothed."</p>

<!-- page 1 col 2 -->

<p>"Good," said the Professor. "Come to-morrow,
at this hour, and your wish shall be gratified."</p>

<p>"And the terms&mdash;I merely ask, in order that
I may bring the requisite sum with me?"</p>

<p>"I am a man of science, not a trader," replied
the Professor. "However, you can allow
me to keep copies of the portraits, as I am desirous
of increasing my collection of specimens,
and as you say the young lady is pretty, her likeness
will be an interesting acquisition."</p>

<p>At these words, the Professor seemed very
much amused by some reflection that passed
through his mind, for his ordinarily inscrutable
countenance relaxed into a faint ironical smile,
whilst something of a sensual softness came over
his dark eyes, as he bowed gravely at the door,
through which I vanished.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was punctual to
my appointment. Elora Von Rabenstock was
on my arm. A modest blush overspread her
fair delicate features (a refinement on Danecker's
Ariadne,) as Dunkelheim greeted her with
a look of unequivocal admiration. His piercing
gaze and singular expression disconcerted Elora,
and I felt angry with the Professor for being a
person of so uncomfortable an aspect. No fault,
however, was to be found with his manners. His
courtesy left nothing to be desired. Perceiving
my intended bride's embarrassment, he strove to
relieve it by drawing her attention, to some galvanized
reptiles, which he caused to writhe and
twist in a very remarkable manner. This would
have alarmed many girls of Elora's age. But
Elora was an angel of light as well as of beauty.</p>

<p>We had laid the foundation of our love deeper
than the passions&mdash;in intellectual sympathy.
Together we had plucked of the tree of knowledge,
as well as of the tree of life, and learned
to make the bitters of the one add a relish to
the often cloying sweetness of the other. Never
was Elora weary of the study of nature, or of
the mysteries of science.</p>

<p>Bidding us take our seats before what appeared
to be merely two plates of highly polished
steel, the Professor next desired us to remain
perfectly motionless with our eyes fixed upon
their mirrored counterparts. Scarcely had he
uttered this direction, when he relieved us from
the task by the surprising assurance that the
portraits were already perfected. Our astonishment
may be imagined, when detaching the
two steel mirrors from the complicated apparatus
that supported them, and which only became
fully visible on their removal, he assured us that
the operation was completed.</p>

<p>Without giving us time to gratify our natural
curiosity, he placed the plates in a flat morocco
case, and informed us that it was absolutely essential
that they should remain in total darkness
for the ensuing twelve hours.</p>

<p>"For the action," said the Professor, "is of
so subtle an electro-galvanic, or, more correctly
speaking, magnetic (that is, to use Reichenbach's
phraseology, <i>odylib</i>) character, that the influence
of the daylight would in a few minutes destroy
the impressions. Artificial light, however, unless
produced by electricity, will not affect them
perceptibly for a long period. It is, therefore,
only at night-time, and by lamp-light, that it is
advisable to regard the portraits. Now, resume
your seats for few seconds longer, in order
that I may take duplicates for thyself,&mdash;thank
you, that will do. Here is your case. It is
now noon, do not open it till midnight. Good
morning, Fraulein; good morning, my young
poet. I know you better than you know me,
and shall know you still better&mdash;adieu."</p>

<p>And so we departed from the presence of a
man in whom I then little dreamed of recognizing
the object of an implacable and eternal hatred.</p>

<p>Yet even in the valedictory smile of the Professor
was a menacing significance, which I afterwards
recalled with horror. It was the grin
of the devil when he defrauds man of his soul,
the exultation of the priest when he cheats woman
of her reason.</p>

<p>"Thank God! we are out of the presence of
that man!" exclaimed Elora.</p>

<p>I made no answer, for I felt that a sympathetic
shudder pervaded both our frames. The
same evening, Elora was slightly indisposed, and
retired early to rest. Thus it happened that&mdash;in
the solitude of my own apartment&mdash;I first
contemplated the results of the Professor's mysterious
science. I opened the case, and took
out one of the steel plates. I regarded it closely.
It reflected my own features like a common mirror.
The Professor was a farceur, his discovery
a hoax! his mysterious smile the vulgar triumph
of a mere practical joker!</p>

<p>"Pshaw! it is but a paltry jest!" I mattered,
indignantly, as I dashed what I now took to be a
worthless plate of metal to the ground. The disappointment
was intense, and I paced rapidly up
and down, to calm the feelings of irritation
that possessed me. In so doing, my eye repeatedly
fell upon the plate of polished metal, as it
lay upon the floor. Its glitter became an eyesore
and a nuisance. I resolved to replace it in
the box, in order that its contemplation might
no longer annoy my nerves. In so doing,
my glance rested accidentally upon the second
plate, the aspect of which at once filled me
with astonishment and wonder. It was no
deception, I indeed beheld Elora, Elora in all
the glow of her matchless complexion and shining
hair&mdash;Elora, as the most faithful mirror alone
could represent her&mdash;Elora living, breathing,
moving&mdash;yes, moving, for even as I gazed the
soft blue eyes which met mine, evidently unconscious
of my presence, closed gently, and were
hidden by their snowy lids, whilst the rose-tinted
lips parted slightly in a smile of angelic innocence,
and a sleeping beauty's reflection replaced
the waking image of my mistress.</p>

<!-- page 1 col 3 -->

<p>The clock struck twelve&mdash;but it might have
struck fifty, and I should scarcely have given the
phenomenon a casual thought. It struck one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;and
still I remained riveted
in contemplation of the changing reflex of my
beautiful Elora, whose features had become the
index of her dreams, and with every minute that
passed expressed some new shade of feeling,
some fresh gradation of internal emotion and
changeful fancy.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a glorious gift the Professor
had given us! He well might claim for his invention
the name of a new and unparalleled science!
There could be no doubt but that an inexplicable
sympathy rendered the metallic reflector
a faithful mirror of the absent Elora's
features, with all their variations of expression
and loveliness. Delicious thought! From the
present moment to the hour of our nuptials, our
parting would be nominal and not real. Spiritually
united, we could hardly be said to be materially
separated; since the magic mirrors
would, by the medium of the most noble of the
senses, render us forever present to one another.
How superior to the cold, ghastly, shadowy, immobility
of the mere daguerreotype, were these
living portraits of Dunkelheim's!</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>Elora and I had no secrets from one another!
but a hideous reminiscence, at this moment,
rose like a phantom of evil to damp my enthusiasm
for the portraits. <i>The Professor possessed
copies</i>. Hateful and revolting idea! It was no
longer Elora, but Dunkelheim, the critical and
penetrating Dunkelheim, who would be enabled
to watch every change in the expression of my
face, to read my every thought, as in an open
book, to amuse his leisure with the mockery of
my inmost emotions, and&mdash;more horrible yet&mdash;Elora's!
A loathsome and accursed fantasy!
to live forever in the presence of such a man as
Dunkelheim, to be forever subject to an excruciating
moral espionage! to be denied for life, the
security and luxury of privacy! to be haunted,
in solitude, by an unseen tormentor!</p>

<p>I absolutely gnashed my teeth with rage, and,
turning toward the pier glass, by accident was
appalled at the deadly ferocity expressed by my
ordinarily calm and serene countenance. The
reflection that, probably, at that moment, the
diabolical Professor was quietly watching my
ghostly prototype, caused me, however, instantly
to control the muscles of my features, and assume
an indifferent expression. It would not do
to let the Professor perceive my agitation, as it
was my purpose to visit him on the following
morning, and, either by fair means or force, obtain
from him the restoration of the portraits he
had retained.</p>

<p>I passed the rest of the night in gazing on
the spectrum of Elora, in which occupation, however,
I discovered a new and unexpected source
of torture. The perpetual contemplation of her
exquisite charm, in their careless and unconscious
abandonment, awoke in me such a fever
of impatient love, that a hundred times I was
upon the point of dashing the tempting mirror
to the ground, as I had dashed its companion
portrait. But an irresistible fascination withheld
me, and I continued to gaze and gaze with
an intense and burning ardor that threatened to
disorder my intelligence.</p>

<p>At length the hour for morning visits arrived.
Before hastening to the Professor, an involuntary
impulse guided my steps to the abode of
Elora. I found her recovered from her indisposition,
and attired in a morning dress of light
blue muslin, that gave increased brilliance to
her dazzling fairness of complexion. She sprang
to meet me with her usual girlish disregard of
ceremony, but paused suddenly in alarm, at the
unusual paleness of my features, and the passionate
intensity of my gaze.</p>

<p>"What is it, you are not well?" she exclaimed,
timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elora!" I exclaimed, suddenly seizing
her hand, and drawing her towards me&mdash;"the
portraits!"&mdash;and I told her all.</p>

<p>She returned my gaze of horror and perplexity,
then, after a time, she said, gravely:</p>

<p>"My dear Ernest, I will never, never marry,
whist that man possesses our portraits&mdash;whilst&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand you, Elora," said I, drawing
her closer to my heart; "whilst a detested
stranger can, at will, become a witness of our
most rapturous moments, our most secret delights,
our&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget!" shrieked Elora, "that even
now&mdash;" and we recoiled from one another in deep
blushes and confusion, whilst Elora, fixing upon
me a look of painful reproach, said, gently:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ernest, why&mdash;why did you subject me
to this fearful experience?"</p>

<p>"Alas! how could I imagine all the consequences
of an invention so unheard of, so portentous?
But my resolution is taken&mdash;I go
this instant to the Professor's. He either restores
our portraits and our peace of mind, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beware of violence! for my sake, Ernest&mdash;
restrain your savage impetuosity."</p>

<p>"Or <i>he dies!</i>" I concluded, with a smile, intended
to deceive the Professor, but which did
not deceive Elora, who would have detained me,
had I not rushed, like a madman, from the house.</p>

<p>On reaching the dwelling of the Professor, I
learned that Ariovistus Dunkelheim had quitted
Berlin that morning in a private travelling chariot,
with all his baggage, and left no directions
as to letters or visitors.</p>

<p>I returned to Elora in a condition of monomania.</p>

<p>"Professor or devil! I will find him upon
earth, if earth harbors him, or descend into hell
in the pursuit!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Elora. "After all, what

<!-- page 1 col 4 -->

difference does it make in reality. Let us forget
that such a man as the Professor exists. But
I have not seen the portraits."</p>

<p>I brought her mine, and left the room, that she
might judge of the effect.</p>

<p>I found her in deep reflection.</p>

<p>"And you can watch me at all times, when I
am alone?" said Elora.</p>

<p>"Certainly, dearest; I was gazing upon you
all last night&mdash;you must have had delightful
dreams!"</p>

<p>Elora became crimson.</p>

<p>"Give me that portrait?" she said, with
downcast eyes, but impatient tone.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;till I possess the original!"</p>

<p>"I insist upon it!"</p>

<p>"Dearest Elora, I cannot!"</p>

<p>"You <i>must!</i>" said Elora, imperiously, with
one of those looks that conquer conquerors.</p>

<p>"No, the sacrifice is too great."</p>

<p>"It is less, I trust, than the sacrifice of your
bride?" said Elora, in a lower but not less imperious
tone.</p>

<p>"My dearest love, why should our marriage
be delayed?</p>

<p>"Because a stranger shall not be present at
our nuptials!" said Elora, hiding her face in her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>I ventured to kiss her forehead.</p>

<p>"Wretch! would you expose me!"</p>

<p>Then returning to her former purpose, she
again pertinaciously demanded my copy of herself.</p>

<p>"Not for all the gold in California!" I answered.
"What! would you deny your lover
a privilege possessed by Ariovistus Dunkelheim?"</p>

<p>Regardless of consequences, Elora sobbed
convulsively on my bosom.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> sees us," said I, gloomily; "but he
cannot see his own sentence of death engraven
on my heart. Farewell, my love; I go to seek
Dunkelheim."</p>

<p>And I tore myself from her presence&mdash;but I
carried the magic portrait in my bosom.</p>

<!-- (To be concluded next week.) -->

<!-- page 1 col 1-->

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>I traversed all Northern Germany, and could
hear no certain tidings of the Professor. I saw
the face of my Elora grew paler and paler in the
mirror, though the reflection was as vivid as
ever, and she wrote me letter after letter, announcing
her unalterable resolution to remain
single, until I laid at her feet the counterparts of
the miraculous portraits.</p>

<p>At length, one night, I arrived at Hamburg.
The city was in flames. In the midst of the blazing
turmoil, a tall man, looking coolly at the conflagration,
arrested my attention. It was Ariovistus
Dunkelheim. In an instant I was at his
side, I laid my hand upon his shoulder, and mentally
regarded him as my prisoner.</p>

<p>"You escape not from me," I murmured inwardly,
"till my demand be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Ah! how are you, my good sir?" said the
Professor, easily, "you have had stormy times
of it since I last saw you, unless I am much mistaken?"</p>

<p>The coolness of the man disconcerted me. I
imitated his conventional tone.</p>

<p>"Was my portrait a successful one?" said I,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Very," replied the Professor, "not a day
passed but that I amused myself by watching its
curious variations, as well as those of the young
lady's features. She is certainly pretty. Had
you not stood in the way, I would have made
her Madame Dunkelheim. I class those two
portraits amongst the best of my specimens. Indeed,
they are great curiosities in their way, for
you must know that it is not every face that can
be fixed by the magnetic process, as the pyroluminous
rays from the great mass of human
bodies are comparatively feeble and scarcely
capable of affecting a metallic surface, however
sensitive. I would not part with those specimens
for ten thousand dollars," concluded the
Professor, as I thought, with vindictive emphasis,

<!-- page 1 col 2 -->

and a look of field-like penetration.</p>

<p>"Yet I hope," said I, with a painfully affected
good humor, "that you will take something less,
when no metaphor but actual business is in question.
The fact is, I wish to purchase those portraits."</p>

<p>"<i>Why?</i>" said the Professor, with a look of
impenetrable audacity.</p>

<p>"I wish to present them to some friends," was
my equivocating answer.</p>

<p>"I can make you copies," said the Professor,
readily.</p>

<p>"I particularly wish to have the originals."</p>

<p>"Very good; I can take copies for myself,"
said Dunkelheim. "There is no perceptible or
intrinsic difference between the two."</p>

<p>"I must request you, as a particular favor,
<i>not</i> to take copies; the truth is, I do not wish
any stranger to possess my portrait."</p>

<p>"Your living spectrum, say, rather," responded
the Professor. "Ah! I understand, the idea
of being made the subject of scientific observation,
makes you and that pretty girl you introduced
to me a little nervous. I wonder a man
of your intellect can be so weak. Why, let me
see, did you not write the philosophic essay on
<i>Spiritual Fortitude</i> and <i>Indifferentism to Phenomena</i>,
in our last number of the <i>Metaphysical
Review?</i> I despise Metaphysics as a science,
but I always read the <i>Review</i>, for the fun of the
thing. Come, come, my dear sir, do not think
of robbing me of the best specimens in my collection
from a mere fanciful fastidiousness. I
really cannot spare them!"</p>

<p>"Devil of a Professor!" said I fiercely. "I
do not ask you a favor; I offer you a choice;
give up those infernal specimens, as you call
them, of your accursed science, or die at once
by my hand!" and I showed the Professor the
barrel of a pistol, concealed beneath the loose
sleeve of my great coat.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I have given away your portraits,"
said Dunkelheim with apparent trepidation.</p>

<p>"To whom? villain!"</p>

<p>"To the Royal Society in London."</p>

<p>Even while I paused for a moment, staggered
by the awful notion of being the subject of a
learned society's criticism, the professor slipped
from my grasp, and disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>I sought him in vain. A moment's recollection
of his discourse showed me that his last
statement must have been a mere <i>ruse</i> to escape.
Nevertheless, I wrote to the Secretary of the
Royal Society on the subject. But no Professor
Ariovistus Dunkelheim had ever been heard of
in London.</p>

<p>I went home, and gazed upon Elora.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>I came to a sudden resolution.</p>

<p>I took writing materials, and wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"ELORA, my adored girl! the pursuit of this
devilish Professor is the occupation of a life. I
am resolved to abandon it and life together,
rather than suffer any longer the torments which
I now hourly endure. There is but one alternative.
Angel of love and beauty, save your<br/>
ERNEST."</p>

<p>Elora's answer was brief, but decisive:&mdash;</p>

<p>"DEAR ERNEST&mdash;Come! ELORA."</p>

<p>I departed for Berlin on the wings of passion
and hope. For the time, I almost forgot the
Professor.</p>

<p>We were married.</p>

<p>Elora was now mine. She realized in every
respect my ideal of a woman. Her soul and her
beauty were divine. Her fascinations were inexhaustible
in their variety. But a spectre
haunted us&mdash;an invisible basilisk withered out
delights&mdash;an unseen hand dropped bitterness
into our cup of ecstacy. The Professor&mdash;the
abhorred Professor&mdash;was ever with us. Night
and day, his terrible green eyes were upon us.
They haunted us even in our dreams.</p>

<p>It was in Elora, however, that this fantastic
horror became most painfully developed. My
sterner manhood had developed a sort of defiant
wrath, which exhaled itself in visions of revenge.
Far otherwise was it with my bride. On our
wedding night, Elora fainted, after exclaiming,
"<i>The Portraits!</i>" in a tone of indescribable
emotion. Frequently, she would start from
my embrace, with the bitter exclamation:</p>

<p>"He sees us!"</p>

<p>"Let him see and envy!" once I exclaimed,
with a wild attempt to turn the object of our
loathing into ridicule.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ernest!" said Elora, sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, my sweet Elora, what now!"</p>

<p>"Were I <i>man!</i>" said Elora, bitterly.</p>

<p>"He shall die!" I exclaimed, starting up from
my seat, and pacing the apartment with insane
rapidity. "D&mdash;n him forever! He dies!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>At length, after twelve months of vain inquiry
and fruitless travel, I one night, quite accidentally,
met the Professor Ariovistus Dunkelheim
on the <i>Pont National</i>, at Paris.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to evade me, but said,
in his usual easy tone:</p>

<p>"Unless I am much mistaken, you are disposed
to murder me?"</p>

<p>"You have rightly divined my intention,
Professor," said I deliberately.</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary," rejoined Dunkelheim,
with a sneer; "I am tired of studying the
physiognomies of a couple of frightened turtle
doves. I am ready to give you up my copies
for the mere cost of the metal."</p>

<p>"I thought you had given them to the Royal
Society?"</p>

<p>The Professor laughed.</p>

<p>I also laughed.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" said Dunkelheim,
with his usual abrupt assurance.</p>

<p>"Because you are a fool!"</p>

<p>The Professor became scarlet, as I could observe
even by the light of a gas lamp. He

<!-- page 1 col 3 -->

gave me a look of intense and unquenchable
hatred.</p>

<p>"I have made some discoveries in science,"
said he, scornfully, as if in answer to my retort:
"I have also gained some thousands of dollars
by my discoveries."</p>

<p>"You have lost your life by one of your discoveries,
yet you have had daily warning for
the last twelve months. You read my design,
it is true, in the expression of my features, but
you did not read its stern immutability. I will
trust you no more; you may give me the portraits
and yet retain copies; you may deceive
or elude me in a thousand ways; you may retaliate
upon me throughout my life, for there
dwells in you a malignant spirit&mdash;the abuser of
power."</p>

<p>"Of supernatural power!" said the Professor,
loftily and threateningly.</p>

<p>"No power is supernatural, for there is nothing
beyond nature," I answered, coldly. "Prepare
yourself for the death-struggle!"</p>

<p>And, before the Professor could utter a cry
for assistance my hand was on his throat. A
terrific contest ensued, for my enemy was a man
of great strength and activity. But my first
gripe had decided the result, and in a few minutes
I had hurled the insensible body of Dunkelheim
over the parapet of the bridge. It fell
with a splash into the water, and I returned unobserved
to my hotel.</p>

<p>Such things often take place in Paris. I went
a few days after to the <i>Morgue</i>, and recognized
the body of my former persecutor. I found out
his residence, and when his effects were sold by
auction, I purchased for a few francs the two
plates of metal which had been the cause of so
much suffering, and of so fearful a catastrophe.
The auctioneer happened to have turned them
with the faces downwards, and was ignorant of
their peculiar properties.</p>

<p>It was only when I presented them to Elora
that I told her how I had killed the Professor.</p>

<p>"I share the crime!" said Elora, proudly.
"Henceforward we are at least our own masters,
and not puppets, acting for the amusement of a
detestable old necromancer!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I exclaimed, "henceforward we are
free!" and I clasped my beautiful Elora to my
heart for the first time without reserve.</p>

<p>But still, at times, the phantom of the murdered
Professor, with his cold, green eyes, will
haunt our fancies. I take some credit to myself
for having the candor to acknowledge myself
a murderer.</p>

<p>It is not my fault that I am not miserable
and full of remorse. Elora is so lovely that,
if she were to insist upon it, I verily believe I
should murder another professor to-morrow!</p>

<h2>PROLOGUE.</h2>

</div>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>I had a dream! start not, 'tis still<br/>

Allowed to dream&mdash;I had a dream!<br/>

Methought, obedient to my will,<br/>

An army, like a swollen stream,<br/>

Poured from a savage mountain gorge,<br/>

With crimson banners floating,<br/>

In choral song,<br/>

As thunder strong,<br/>

Their foes to death devoting.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>I stood upon a jutting crag,<br/>

My long sword glittering and bare,<br/>

And sternly counted, flag by flag,<br/>

While swelled their war-cry on the air,<br/>

And horsemen, num'rous as the sand<br/>

On ocean's shore uncounted,<br/>

Still swept beneath,<br/>

With song of death,<br/>

On fiery chargers mounted.</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>At length they paused, 'mid silence vast,<br/>

As if all earth had ceased to breathe;<br/>

And with dread thought my brain, o'ercast.<br/>

Began to throb, and whirl, and seethe,<br/>

And from the crowded gorge below,<br/>

And from each crag's wild station,<br/>

Upon me gazed<br/>

Fierce eyes, that blazed<br/>

With fevered expectation.</p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p>And then I knew that all this host<br/>

Was mine to govern, mine to lead,<br/>

That earth must now be gained or lost,<br/>

For evermore enslaved or freed;<br/>

And with the thought my heart grew full,<br/>

And strength, the child of danger,<br/>

Inspired a power<br/>

O'er that grand hour,<br/>

To earthly doubt a stranger.</p>

<p class="center">V.</p>

<p>I spoke. With eyes the mountain side<br/>

Was shining, as with sombre gems&mdash;<br/>

"Eternal death to all the pride<br/>

Of coronets and diadems!<br/>

Rise! take thy everlasting throne,<br/>

Spirit of truth undying!<br/>

In vengeance rise,<br/>

To paralyse<br/>

The foes, thy rule defying!"</p>

<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p>Men are not children of a day,<br/>

As grovellers cant, and canters whine,<br/>

They tread an everlasting way,<br/>

Spirits of essence pure, divine.<br/>

From state to state, from world to world,<br/>

They rise o'er pain victorious,<br/>

This life a stage,<br/>

The last turned page<br/>

Of progress boundless, glorious.</p>

<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p>Spirits of everlasting time!<br/>

Men, passing citizens of earth!<br/>

Dare to fulfil each thought sublime,<br/>

Each passion of celestial birth!<br/>

Dare to <i>be</i> all that fancy dreams,<br/>

To <i>do</i> all conscience teaches!<br/>

Go forth to quell<br/>

The brood of Hell,<br/>

And storm their rampart's breaches!</p>

<p class="center">VIII.</p>

<p>There is a plague&mdash;a mad disease&mdash;<br/>

That overspreads the shuddering globe,<br/>

Infects the ships that sail the seas,<br/>

And wraps the earth with leper's robe&mdash;<br/>

A burning, savage lust of gold,<br/>

The craving soul's starvation,<br/>

Self's scheme to rise<br/>

To Paradise<br/>

On brother soul's damnation!</p>

<p class="center">IX.</p>

<p>In vain, with words that pierce like swords,<br/>

With love that penetrates like dew,<br/>

We offer to these blinded lords<br/>

Of visionary wealth, the true,<br/>

The only wealth, the only truth,<br/>

By reason unrejected&mdash;<br/>

"The wealth of each,<br/>

Of all," we teach,<br/>

From man to man reflected.</p>

<p class="center">X.</p>

<p>They sleep the sleep of folly's crew;<br/>

No sentinel holds watch. They sleep&mdash;<br/>

Thus slept the host the Persian slew&mdash;<br/>

They will not hear; we will not weep,<br/>

Though we should wade in blood knee-deep!<br/>

They sleep&mdash;base, abject, sterile&mdash;<br/>

Asleep, they wait<br/>

Their certain fate,<br/>

In torpor's ghastly peril!</p>

<p class="center">XI.</p>

<p>"<i>March on!</i>"&mdash;Ten thousand trumpets then<br/>

Woke every mountain echo round,<br/>

And voices of unnumbered men<br/>

Returned the blast with deafening sound.<br/>

"<i>March on!</i>"&mdash;I madly waved my brand,<br/>

Like heaven's storm-fire gleaming,<br/>

When at my side<br/>

A form I spied,<br/>

A face 'mid gold locks streaming.</p>

<p class="center">XII.</p>

<p>A woman's form, of such bright grace,<br/>

She spoke&mdash;"To me is given.<br/>

With lays to shame<br/>

In robes of dazzling light arrayed,<br/>

Stood living echoes of the sound;<br/>

Great, noble forms of god-like men&mdash;<br/>

Prophets&mdash;no more of Edom,<br/>

Bursts forth. Hark!&mdash;"Love and Freedom!"</p>

<p>BOOK I.</p>

<p class="small">THE OPENING OF THE SOUL EXCHANGE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">A BOLD SPECULATOR.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was about four o'clock on a spring afternoon. The
City was still in full activity. The gold was rattling
on the bank counters, and the clerks were cashing their
notes as coolly as if the whole affair had been anything
but a gigantic juggle. <i>Practical</i> men&mdash;too practical
to think&mdash;were paying in their deposits with a touching
and child-like confidence. No suspicion had <i>they</i> that
they were trusting to a system, which, "like the baseless
fabric of a vision," might at any moment dissolve into
nothingness. <i>Practical</i> men do not understand the
currency&mdash;they despise theorists who do. They swear
by Sir Robert the Devil and&mdash;everybody is in debt to
everybody in consequence.</p>

<!-- page 2 -->

<p>No matter. It was four P.M. in the City. Attornies
were cheating their clients, or assisting them to cheat
other people. Merchants were calculating the chances
of the markets, like gamblers inventing martingales.
Clerks were adding up figures as clocks add up minutes.
Cashiers and secretaries were reflecting on the facilities
of an impromptu voyage to California. Directors of
companies were "cooking" the accounts of their shareholders.
Waiters at Joe's, Sam's, Tom's, Betsy's,
and other chop-houses, whose proprietors are apparently
more proud of their Christian names than usual, ordered
countless chops through patent gutta percha telegraphs.
Cooks basted themselves with half-and-half whilst
roasting before their fires, like Fox's martyrs, bound to
the steaks of their tyrants. Crossing-sweepers were industriously
clearing streets as dry as carpets and begging
of passengers as charitable as cannibals. Usurers were
meeting gentlemen who wanted to borrow money at any
rate of&mdash;nonpayment. Adventurers were keeping appointments
with capitalists they hoped to drag into
speculations. Capitalists were contriving monopolies
by which to crush non-capitalist adventurers. Stock-brokers
were playing monkey tricks on the Stock
Exchange. Hebrew gold kings were manufacturing
intelligence to astonish the stock-brokers. Couriers
were dashing off with the commands of London financiers
to foreign potentates. Messengers were arriving
from the sham, entreating aid from the real sovereigns
of Europe. And the plenipotentiaries of the daily
press were calmly overlooking the whole ant-hill with
sublime indifference to the struggles of its busy insects,
generalising for millions the knowledge which, even to

<!-- page 3 -->

those in the midst of the bustle, was too often but semi-obscurity
and chromatropic confusion.</p>

<p>This being the state of affairs in the stronghold of
the gold-worshippers, the great commercial "diggins"
of the eastern world, two individuals&mdash;Manich&aelig;ans of
the nineteenth century&mdash;descended arm-in-arm the
broad flight of steps from the great gate of the Royal
Exchange, engaged in low but animated conversation.</p>

<p>Their object was to escape from the crowd, and to
avoid being overheard by strangers, as was evident from
the cautious glances they threw about them. They
paused in the shadow of the Duke of Wellington's
statue, which the rays of the western sun grotesquely
caricatured upon the pavement. The sun is like all
light&mdash;a great leveller. As death brings the pretensions,
so sunshine brings the shadows of all men to the dust.</p>

<p>"It is an old truism," said the taller of the two
Manich&aelig;ans, "but it never struck me so forcibly before.
The world is never thoroughly taken in by an old juggle.
Catch a new monster, a child with the legs of an ostrich,
or a Bengal tiger that can learn to play at nine-pins,
and the mob rushes to pay its half-crowns, and vociferate
its admiration; but produce a second pair of
Siamese twins, or a latter-day Tom Thumb that may be
put into a hat-box, and it is as little appreciated as an
old joke of the venerable Miller."</p>

<p>The speaker, whose large black eyes glittered with a
peculiar exultation, cast a searching side-glance at his
companion.</p>

<p>He was a thin man, in the prime of life, slightly above
the middle height, with coal-black hair and whiskers,
very large arched eyebrows, and a cadaverous complexion.

<!-- page 4 -->

His features were aquiline, regular, and even handsome.
But on minute inspection a variety of lines and wrinkles
became perceptible, which united to give his face a
cynical, perhaps malignant, expression. There was
more assurance than dignity in his manner, and though
his frown might have inspired little apprehension, his
smile suggested something dangerous, because undefined.</p>

<p>The personage to whom he had spoken was, on the
other hand, short, stout, and rather rubicund; with
small greenish eyes, that twinkled restlessly beneath
the serpentine fascination of his companion's gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the thin man sententiously, "new
roads provoke new travellers. There are fools enough,
and knaves enough, and gold enough behind us"&mdash;he
pointed significantly towards the Exchange by a slight
motion of his hand&mdash;"to build railways from London to
Calcutta, with an extension to Pekin, if wanted. But
railways have found their level. They may still transport
railway kings, but cannot trust them in any station
on their lines. Railways are degenerating into facts,
from phantasm Golcondas, as that mad old grumbling
dreamer Carlyle would call them, I suppose. There is
a fellow for you! who, having discovered the Irishman's
axiom that 'Mankind is a great rascal,' gets straightway
into a passion, and thinks to turn the river of mind
as a hunter turns a buffalo, by shrieking outlandish
gibberish and compound Anglo-German Billingsgate!
I hate these canting egotistical lecturers, spouters, and
scribblers. If a man has an itch for reforming the world,
let him do something himself, instead of abusing everybody
else. Give me practical men, who take the earth
as they find it, and if they can't build their houses on

<!-- page 5 -->

rocks take the firmest sand that offers. There is but one
moral principle, and that is self-interest. There is but
one maxim worth attending to in life&mdash;'Buy in the
cheapest market and sell in the dearest.' "</p>

<p>"True," said the stout man, "but buy as cheap as
you will, and sell as dear as you will, unless you have
an unlimited market&mdash;which, with present competition,
is scarcely possible&mdash;I can't see the facility of making
those rapid fortunes you hinted at."</p>

<p>"Therefore," replied his saturnine comrade, "I come
back to my old proposition: the newest speculation is
the most profitable. Petty traders gamble, commercial
genius descends upon its prey like the eagle. Who do
you suppose make the most rapid fortunes?"</p>

<p>"Bill-brokers, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! have <i>you</i> made a fortune at that tedious
game?"</p>

<p>"I have not been so lucky as I might have been. I
have had heavy losses lately. But then I was imprudent,
I ran great risks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Without which you would have done nothing.
Guess again."</p>

<p>"I have it&mdash;the Jew slopsellers!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. The poor rogues scrape together a trifle
by grinding the life out of their starved workwomen;
and Noses and Son, backed by Rotmuck&mdash;I beg his
pardon, Baron de Rotmuck&mdash;may have done something
more with bankrupt stock, devil's-dust cloth, and
a perfect Niagara cataract of advertisements. <i>Any</i> man
may make five hundred per cent. per annum if he only
has the capital required to start with."</p>

<p>"Well, I give it up," said the fat man, gasping with
curiosity.</p>

<!-- page 6 -->

<p>"Of course you do. Now answer me an easier
question. Does not all commerce amount at bottom to
selling other men's labour for your own advantage?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;that is&mdash;I suppose so," said the stout
Manich&aelig;an, who did not pretend to understand political
economy, and felt himself already out of his depth.</p>

<p>He was, it must be owned, a rather shallow Plato, and
his instructor a somewhat Mephistophelian Socrates.</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>," rejoined the latter, "I say there is one thing
better."</p>

<p>"Indeed! what is it then?" grunted the stout disciple,
completely mystified by this unexpected announcement.</p>

<p>"<i>Selling the men themselves</i>," replied the taller
speculator, after a pause, with cutting emphasis.</p>

<p>So sharp, bitter, and to the purpose was every sentence
of this man that he might be said, like Hamlet, to "speak
daggers." Each of his words was a brass-headed nail,
driven into his companion's brain with a miner's hammer.</p>

<p>"Do slave-dealers make quick profits?" enquired the
short man, timidly.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"But are they not occasionally shot by the guns of
British cruisers?"</p>

<p>"Occasionally: the sea-serpent is sometimes seen,
Lord John once said a good thing."</p>

<p>"So you think dealing in niggers the best speculation
we could embark in?"</p>

<p>"The best you could <i>embark</i> in, certainly."</p>

<p>"But seriously?"</p>

<p>"Why, on the principle of 'Buy in the cheapest
market and sell in the dearest,' it stands to reason that
a man-catcher who steals his merchandise ready made

<!-- page 7 -->

(begotten, I <i>should</i> say), cannot well lose by the bargain,
unless he meet by a miracle with a cruiser, and lose the
bargain altogether. But I have no notion of transporting
black cattle from Guinea to Brazil. I said something
<i>new</i> was the thing. Well, human bodies, black and white,
fair and foul, alive and dead, are regular articles of commerce.
<i>I</i> propose to enter into a business quite as
common, but scarcely recognised on 'Change. In a
word&mdash;I propose to <i>deal in human souls!</i>"</p>

<p>"The devil you do! What an uncommonly strange
idea!&mdash;But you are jesting?"</p>

<p>"I never jest. What I say, I mean."</p>

<p>"Are you the Prince of Darkness, then, or his envoy?
Is that a pocket handkerchief or a tail hanging out of
your pocket? Why&mdash;excuse my saying it&mdash;you must
be either mad, or drunk, or making a butt of me!
Pray talk of pounds, shillings, and pence, but don't
speak to me of souls. I neither believe in souls nor devil."</p>

<p>"No," said the pale man, with a concentrated sneer,
that made the other almost tremble at his own audacity,
"nor in any God but Plutus. But you do not understand
me. In the first place, never mix up such childish
trash as devils, with or without horns, hoofs, or tails, in
a rational discussion. Next, be assured that there <i>is</i> a
devil, minus the D, pervading the very atmosphere we
breathe. This spirit of evil seems a sort of spice to existence
generally, without which it would be confoundedly
monotonous and insipid. Thirdly, as to a soul,
you have a thinking apparatus in your scull, I presume.
You have feelings, especially if kicked down stairs; and
you have or have not principles, good, bad, or indifferent,
as the case may be. These, or the use of them, men

<!-- page 8 -->

can and do sell every day of their lives. In common
parlance, such queer matters are termed souls. The
word is understood, why split straws about an expression?"</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons! I thought you were quizzing
me by proposing to deal in souls after death?"</p>

<p>"After death! It is you who are quizzing now! What
are you raving about? What do we know of <i>death?</i>
'Post mortem nihil est, ipsaque mors nihil,' said Seneca,
who continues to describe all beyond as 'Rumores
vacui, verbaque inania.' After death! There is nothing
to be said after such an absurdity. You were dreaming
of Doctor Faustus. O sancta simplicitas! It is in
the souls of the living, not the dead, I propose to
speculate."</p>

<p>"Well, there is one thing I wish to know," said the
stout pupil, overawed to some extent by his companion's
air of superiority, caustic fluency, and Latin quotations;
"how on earth can you buy a soul without a body to
keep it in?"</p>

<p>"What! still in the dark, or rather still among the
darkies?" replied the tall philosopher, in a tone which
caused the fat neophyte to apprehend an attack in Greek
or Hebrew on his obtuse intelligence; "do you think I
want to buy men for the sake of putting them in glass
cases? Take care of the souls, and the bodies will take
care of themselves. Why, one would think I had proposed
something really new&mdash;to try an experiment which had
never been tried before."</p>

<p>"Humph! If your scheme is not new after all, why
did you boast of its novelty?"</p>

<p>The dark man looked down upon his comrade, with
the good-humoured pity of superior genius.</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>"All things are old and all things are new according to
combination and circumstances," he replied, with less
sarcasm in his tone. "I have not told you my scheme
yet. I have merely thrown out an idea in order to prepare
you to understand it. Look about you&mdash;look at
Downing-street, look at the Houses of Parliament, look
at the Church, the Bar, the Press&mdash;aye, look at the
leviathan <i>Timeserver</i> and its crew; and say whether
there are not souls bought and sold, aye, and double-sold
in London, wholesale and retail, to an extent beyond all
ordinary powers of calculation? Now observe how
clumsily, how indelicately, how imperfectly the thing is
managed&mdash;and mark how splendidly my scheme will
come in to supply all the wants of the age. You shall
share the speculation. The capital can be raised in
shares. The preliminary expenses are not worth
mentioning. The very letters of allotment will rise
like balloons at Vauxhall&mdash;Railways were a joke to it!&mdash;The
South-Sea Bubble a mere flea-bite! However,
talking is dry work; I feel inclined for a cutlet; so
we will just turn into the European, and discuss the
matter over a bottle of Madeira. By the way, there is
a popular prejudice of late against Madeira. It was
started for a wager by a fashionable physician. I was
dining with him at the time. Where can you show me a
stronger proof of the ease with which the world is made
a fool of?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE SOUL AGENT'S FIRST CUSTOMER.</p>

</div>

<p>A week had elapsed since the conversation of our two
Manich&aelig;ans, recorded in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>A man of striking and majestic aspect walked down
Whitehall, in the direction of Westminster Abbey, which,
gilded by the noon-day sun, towered proudly above the
surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>Even so did he himself tower above the crowd amid
which he moved. Taller by a head than the average
race of men, his breadth of chest and martial carriage
alike indicated a fitness for and experience of the camp.
More than one trim guardsman involuntarily turned to
gaze after the passing stranger. Nor was this military
appearance diminished by a long dark brown moustache,
which completely overshadowed his upper lip, and a closely
buttoned surtout of dark green cloth, from the breast of
which a crumpled roll of papers protruded. His features
were noble in the natural and uncorrupted sense of the
word. His eyes, grey in colour, were of a singular beauty.
Their very softness expressed an intensity of self-possession,
courage, and penetration, rarely found in eyes which
shine more brightly with the borrowed light from without.
Their brightness was the brightness of the spirit
that flashed through them, as the glances of women
through those useful blinds, transparent from the interior

<!-- page 11 -->

of a mansion, but impervious to the gaze of the curious
in the public thoroughfare. His broad open brow was
smooth as a young girl's, yet pregnant with earnest
thought. Take him all in all, he conveyed an idea of the
grandeur of a Mirabeau without his ugliness, or of a
Dante without his sorrows. His profile resembled that
of the living poet Lamartine&mdash;his full face suggested the
features of the dead warrior Napoleon. Strange combination
of imperfect comparisons! Such countenances
must be seen; they are unique, and are not to be met
with amongst common men. Such an attempt at verbal
picturing may seem exaggerated&mdash;perhaps inconsistent.
But this is certain; there are forms of human grace and
dignity, that walk the earth in living incarnation, which
do not yield to sculptured gods, or poet's dreams of the
ideal. Happy the student who has met with such forms,
which the great artist, Nature, at times exhibits, lest the
vanity of imagination should wax too arrogant of an unsubstantial
superiority.</p>

<p>The stranger's rapid progress was arrested by a mob,
which had assembled, regardless of the remonstrances of
established authority in the shape of blue coats and metal
buttons, before a house recently painted and otherwise
externally embellished.</p>

<p>Upon the window blinds of the ground-floor, and upon
a large brass plate by the side of the portal, were to be
read these startling words&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>"GENERAL AGENCY"</p>

<p class="small">"FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF HUMAN SOULS."</p>

</div>

<p>A porter at the door, in a magnificent livery, distributed
to all respectably-dressed people prospectuses printed in

<!-- page 12 -->

letters of gold upon superfine satin note paper. To the
rabble of more unpretending costume he gave no prospectuses,
but occasionally addressed them in the following
scornful terms, varying his discourse with references to
his more wealthy auditors:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, move off, my good people, move off; what
are you staring at? No admission except on business,
sir. Hollo, you in the corduroys, just get away from
those railings, will you? nobody will give anything for
<i>your</i> soul, depend upon it&mdash;A prospectus, madam?
certainly&mdash;Like to walk in and speak to the secretary,
sir? (This was spoken to a gentleman who had the
air of an M.P. at the least.) Now, then, don't stand
in the way, little boys&mdash;where are you pushing to?&mdash;do
you want to be packed off to the station-house, you man
with the basket?"</p>

<p>At this moment the gigantic figure of the stranger
moving through the crowd, as a man-of-war through the
ocean, arrived opposite the speaker. The new comer,
laying his hand upon the shoulder of the porter, twirled
him round like a top without apparent effort, and passed
quietly into the office. A pasteboard clerk, amazingly
well got up, with a very stiff white neckcloth, and a very
wooden face, received the intruder in a most obsequious
manner.</p>

<p>"Can I see the manager?" said the stranger, curtly.</p>

<p>"If you will state your business, sir, certainly,"
replied the stiff clerk, in measured accents.</p>

<p>"Without that preliminary?" said the stranger, quietly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I must know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To know nothing is your department, I should
imagine," rejoined the obstinate stranger.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>"Sir, I really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, I mean no offence. If your masters are
here, announce me." And the stranger held out a card,
on which a duke's coronet was visible, but covered with
his thumb the name, of which the stiff clerk could only
see a small piece of one letter, and even that he could
not distinguish.</p>

<p>"The Duke of&mdash;?" said the clerk, with a smile like
the distortion of a gutta percha mask, "I beg your
grace's pardon, but I could not see the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly, that will do; announce me at once."</p>

<p>"As the Duke of&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;I am in a hurry."</p>

<p>The pasteboard clerk did not dare to push his inquiries
farther, and straightway announced the Duke of
Nowhere, who was instantly admitted to the sanctum
in which the saturnine speculator of our former chapter
was seated. Upon the table before him were rows of
books and papers tied with red tape. The apartment
was luxuriously furnished. He rose politely as the
martial visitor entered.</p>

<p>The stranger removed his hat, and thus more fully
displayed the grandeur of a brow stamped with intellectual
indication. He met the sharp glance of the
speculator's large black eyes with supreme indifference.
There were only one pair of eyes in existence that had
power over the stranger; and they were other eyes than
speculators'.</p>

<p>On the other hand the enterprising Soul Agent felt
a vaguely-uncomfortable sensation at the steady look of
his bright-eyed visitor, which seemed to take him in at a
glance, to measure and judge him at first sight, and to

<!-- page 14 -->

scan him with a quiet consciousness of superiority
against which he secretly rebelled in spirit. He resolved
to resist this sensation to the utmost, and recover his
natural audacity.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the Soul Agent, with easy politeness,
"my clerk announced you as the Duke of&mdash;I really
did not catch the name."</p>

<p>"Nor did he," said the stranger, with perfect suavity.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, if we are to transact business together,
as I presume we may from your honouring us with a call,
it is necessary to know your real name and address&mdash;in
confidence&mdash;in strict confidence, your grace."</p>

<p>"As what the <i>Timeserver</i> calls a guarantee of my
good faith," rejoined the stranger, "while their own is
beyond all guaranteeing."</p>

<p>"A great organ the <i>Timeserver!</i>" said the Soul Agent.</p>

<p>"A great grinding organ, truly," said the visitor, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Magnificent leaders, sometimes," hinted the agent.</p>

<p>"Five-guinea yards of balderdash," replied the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Vast sources of information."</p>

<p>"For distorting and colouring," completed the visitor.</p>

<p>"Immense power!"</p>

<p>"Over old gentlemen of weak minds."</p>

<p>"Still it is a wonderful engine, your grace."</p>

<p>"Wonderfully stupid. <i>I mean to put it down</i>."</p>

<p>The Soul Agent stared aghast in amazement. He had
shares in the <i>Timeserver</i>.</p>

<p>The stranger continued, "Never mind the grace, I
may be anything but what I represent myself. I may
be an impostor. However, that is of no consequence."</p>

<!-- page 15 -->

<p>"Of no consequence? But it seems to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly; I will set your scruples at rest. Look at
this bag."</p>

<p>The Soul Agent did look with all the power of his
large black optics.</p>

<p>"It contains a thousand pounds in gold. Take it in
your hand, look at it, weigh it, feel it. You worship
gold&mdash;respect me, at any rate to the extent of a thousand
pounds. There are others where these came from.
Now to business. I wish to buy the soul of a cabinet
minister&mdash;in fact the F&mdash;&mdash;n Secretary. Can you negotiate
the matter for me at any price, and to what extent?"</p>

<p>The dark speculator regarded the cavalier stranger
with increasing admiration. He felt that cunning with
such a man would be thrown away. But there was
much to hope from his liberality.</p>

<p>"On referring to my register," said the Soul Agent,
in a cool business-like tone, "I find that the soul of the
minister in question is in the market. His exact price
will require some calculation, for I find that there is a
report of his being mortgaged to Russia, and otherwise
diplomatically pledged. I will, however, get our actuary
to make a precise estimate, which in a few days I can
communicate to your grace."</p>

<p>"Good," said the stranger, "there is no particular
hurry as to that matter. Now as to the leader of the
opposition?"</p>

<p>"Sold, your grace, sold long ago, by private contract."</p>

<p>"Beyond redemption?"</p>

<p>"I fear so, at present."</p>

<p>"Could an assignment be effected from the present
holders?"</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>"Not unless, perhaps, at a monstrous figure. They
value him highly, as highly as a Jew's eye. Indeed, I
may remark in confidence that he is very much over-rated
by his friends."</p>

<p>"Good. When he is to be had at a discount I may
treat with you. The chief proprietor of the <i>Timeserver</i>,
is he on sale? I will give a liberal price for the rubbish."</p>

<p>"At present he is mortgaged heavily, but will bear
additional encumbrance," replied the Soul Agent.
"There again the figure is very high, and if I might
venture a suggestion, a cheaper bargain might be made
with the principal editor."</p>

<p>"Who has no soul to sell at all. Thank you&mdash;I have
no wish to purchase slaves. My work cannot be done by
machines. I can pick up mere instruments, as occasion
offers, at clubs, or coffee-houses, or anywhere."</p>

<p>"I perceive that your grace understands business.
It is a pleasure to deal with a nobleman of such evident
talent."</p>

<p>"You flatter me."</p>

<p>"Not in the least, your grace. If you could only give
me some idea of the line in which you speculate, I could
perhaps be of some real service to your grace."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the stranger, with distant
courtesy, "I have only two more enquiries to make&mdash;is
there a soul upon your books belonging (if not sold to
somebody else) to one Bernard Viridor?"</p>

<p>"To what class does he belong, your grace. I really
do not remember the name?"</p>

<p>"He is a young writer, chiefly on abstract questions,
and under an assumed name; a poet of the <i>nascitur non
fit</i> order, and I believe rather a red-hot democrat."</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>The Soul Agent took up one of the volumes upon the
table and turned over its leaves with great rapidity.</p>

<p>"Here is the name," he said, on turning to letter V,
"your description is correct&mdash;man of genius&mdash;young&mdash;poor&mdash;pretends
enthusiasm&mdash;mixed up with treasonable
movements&mdash;associates with suspicious company. May
be had reasonable, I should say, if not too nice on
minute points of opinion."</p>

<p>"Or broad principles?" said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Principles are very elastic," said the agent, drily,
"but this Viridor is ambitious, most likely&mdash;may give
more trouble than more important people. However, I will
undertake the negotiation if fair terms are offered and
full powers to treat given, with time to collect information."</p>

<p>"I authorise you to bid as high as ten thousand pounds,
with a place worth from five to twelve hundred a year, a
seat in Parliament, and an introduction to the first
society in England."</p>

<p>"In that case I think we may consider the matter
settled," said the Soul Agent, with a grim smile; "a democrat
is but an advanced Whig, and every Whig is a Tory
on the Treasury bench. This young dreamer is probably
in debt, and can be easily reached. Very few souls can
stand the test of extreme pecuniary pressure."</p>

<p>"Very few."</p>

<p>"Is he well connected?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his relations are all in independent circumstances
and comparatively rich. He is of good family, as
they call it."</p>

<p>"All the better! A genius, not to say a democrat, is
always cut by his relations. That stings the soul and,

<!-- page 18 -->

makes it bitter. It teaches wisdom and destroys childish
faith in human nature."</p>

<p>"Whence scepticism, selfishness, and worldliness&mdash;that
is, venality. You are a shrewd guesser at psychology,"
said the stranger, regarding the Soul Agent with
a sort of interest akin to the geologist's examination of
a new fossil.</p>

<p>"A logician, your grace, if you please, not a guesser."</p>

<p>The stranger smiled almost disdainfully.</p>

<p>"You are not so shrewd as I thought, or you would
have abandoned logic," resumed the supposed duke.
"But I am not here for abstract discussions. You think
my affair can be managed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it may require great delicacy of man&oelig;uvre
to bring him to treat plainly,"</p>

<p>"You can keep the &pound;1000 as a deposit for preliminary
expenses."</p>

<p>"They will not exceed a couple of hundred," said the
dark calculator, placing the heavy bag of gold in a
drawer, with feigned indifference.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the stranger, with that keen intuition of
a mind at once imaginative and reflective in the highest
degree, detected at a glance by the expression of the Soul
Agent's fingers, that there was, as yet, little capital at
the back of the new speculation. There is no over-refinement
of observation in this statement. For those <i>who
can read</i>, every square inch of nature is scribbled over
with the hieroglyphs of thought.</p>

<p>"We endeavour," continued the Soul Agent, involuntarily
infusing a shade more subservience into his tone,
"we endeavour to act fairly towards our clients, and to
save their money, as far as practicable, in all transactions.

<!-- page 19 -->

In fact, it is our own interest to do so, as
rival agencies will open in imitation of our establishment
within a few days. However, our immense connections
and extended sources of information give advantages
to the genuine concern which other firms will
vainly attempt to compete with."</p>

<p>"It is a pity that a patent could not be secured for
so splendid an idea."</p>

<p>"It is indeed," said the Soul Agent, bowing low to
the compliment. "And now, your grace, although I
have not the honour of knowing your name, I
am prepared, if you desire it, to offer you a few shares
in the company at par, notwithstanding that they are
already at a high premium in the market."</p>

<p>"Your disinterestedness overwhelms me. I will consider
the matter as speedily as possible. Meanwhile, one
last proposition. May I take the extreme liberty of
inquiring at what price your own valuable soul is to be
purchased? I am not a poor man, so you need not
fear to name a round sum, or even a great prize of a
non-pecuniary nature, for which you are doubtless
eligible?"</p>

<p>For the first time during many long years the dark
speculator felt the blood rush up to his cheeks, his
heart&mdash;he had one, anatomically speaking&mdash;beat quickly,
and his whole nervous system intensely agitated.</p>

<p>Destitute of conscientious scruples, and all ordinary
weaknesses of sentiment, he had yet one dominant
quality, which from its exaggeration amounted almost
to a virtue. He was proud&mdash;proud as the type of
pride, the fallen but unconquered Lucifer. His dark
eyes flashed for an instant with suppressed rage. Lived

<!-- page 20 -->

there a man&mdash;was this impassible and incomprehensible
stranger <i>the</i> man&mdash;who ventured to make him the butt of
a whimsical pleasantry? An instant's reflection banished
the idea. The bag of gold in his drawer was proof conclusive
of the stranger's seriousness. Then again, who
<i>was</i> this mysterious nobleman whose speculations took so
bold and extensive a range? What were his means, and
what were his aims? Was he some fabulously wealthy peer,
gifted miraculously with the strong intellect of a plebeian
student, and grasping in his enlightened ambition the
full power which such a position gave him? It was
impossible to guess&mdash;it was useless to ask. Here,
probably, was an opportunity for the Soul Agent of securing
at one blow a comparatively vast fortune. But
then his grand schemes, his brilliant speculations, his independent
balance-holding between all parties and
factions, his prospectively enormous gains, which became
at the best problematical as the tool of another.
He threw his pride into the scale, and independence
triumphed. He resolved to reject the offer, and whilst
he was about it, to do it grandly. But he overshot his
mark. He was not a match for the stranger. Cunning
never is for genius.</p>

<p>"I thank your grace," replied the Soul Agent, vainly
affecting extraordinary coolness, and vainly hoping to
have concealed the inward struggle which the bright-eyed
cavalier read, as a mariner reads the signs of a
storm in the heavens, "my profession is to buy and sell
the souls of other men, but not to barter my own liberty.
Besides, I too am rich, and shall be richer, for the profits
of such a trade are not easily computed."</p>

<p>"True," said the stranger; "you despise my offer,

<!-- page 21 -->

not understanding its value. Every man has his price.
I believe you assume that postulate. But you imagine
that to buy you at your own estimate is not in the power
of so humble an individual as myself. It may be so&mdash;I
am sorry I cannot arrange the matter. You will still
undertake my commissions?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the agent; and secretly stung
at the irresistible domination of his collocutor's nature,
he risked a most adventurous and ill-timed sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said, with difficulty preventing his
voice from quivering, "perhaps your grace might not
object to sell your own soul if a sufficiently high price
were offered?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," said the stranger, frankly, to the consternation
of the Soul Agent, who calculated upon a contemptuous
refusal. "Sign me a cheque for a million, and
the thing is done!"</p>

<p>"A million!" gasped the speculator; "a million for a
soul without a name!"</p>

<p>"It is worth it," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"But without even a name?"</p>

<p>"Produce the money, or prove your immediate power
of raising it, and I will tell you my name."</p>

<p>The Soul Agent, who felt his dignity lowered by this
strange <i>badinage</i>, wished his customer or himself at the
devil his master's, rather than where he sat at that
moment.</p>

<p>"The price is preposterous!" he exclaimed, peevishly.</p>

<p>"You perceive," said the stranger, coldly, "that it is
useless to trifle with me. You are a gentleman of boldness,
fertile resources, and experience, but <i>you</i> are trying
to make a fortune&mdash;<i>I</i> already possess one. Now to <i>me</i>,

<!-- page 22 -->

a million, if there were an object to be gained, would be
a mere bagatelle."</p>

<p>A mere bagatelle! The Soul Agent forgot all personal
pride at this prodigious announcement. Bitterly
he regretted that he had not accepted the stranger's
offer. He saw in the stern though beautiful lineaments
of his client the expression absolute of truth and power.
He felt that he was indeed in the presence of one of the
real kings of men, one too who for a wonder appeared
equally rich in spiritual and material wealth. A million!
he forgot the sarcasm in the fact. Could he, the Soul
Agent, have made sure at one blow of even a tithe of
that sum&mdash;and bolted! Or even supposing this</p>

<p class="small">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Millionaire,<br/>

This creature rich and rare,"</p>

<p>as a certain poet once defined it, <i>had</i> had the cunning
to guard against all evasion of contract? Still, even
as the factotum of such a man! But it was idle to
regret; he had exposed his weak side&mdash;he had allowed
himself to be foiled. The stranger would not repeat
the offer, at least on terms worth taking into consideration.
The chance was lost, but he might yet by zeal
recover the opportunity.</p>

<p>Already, without knowing it, the dark Agent had sold
himself to his mysterious customer&mdash;for a chance.</p>

<p>There is a spiritual as a social scale of infinite gradations.
A spirit of the secondary must bend to a spirit of
the primary order. Men of genius, the real princes of
thought and rulers of the earth, are not so stupid at a
bargain as some commonsense bunglers imagine.</p>

<p>"A second customer like your grace," said the Soul
Agent, with a courtier-like cringe, "and I should lose all

<!-- page 23 -->

faith in my tact as a man of the world. Luckily, you
have <i>no</i> second!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have the more principal," said the stranger,
accepting the agent's homage, and condescending to a
jest, but not to a smile, in order to restore his collocutor's
equanimity.</p>

<p>The Soul Agent laughed, but it must be owned his
laughter was a little ghastly, and smacked of the music
in <i>Robert le Diable</i>.</p>

<p>"Adieu, for the present," said the stranger, feeling his
triumph complete, since philosophy teaches that no man
will laugh at a bad pun unless thoroughly subjugated.</p>

<p>"<i>Good</i> morning! I trust your grace will soon honour
me with a second visit?"</p>

<p>The stranger bowed gracefully, though slightly, took
his hat, and departed in silence.</p>

<p>The pasteboard clerk, seeing his master grinning
the visitor out, with a politeness very far beyond his
usual reserved and dignified demeanour, kow-towed in so
painful a manner, that he could be likened only to a
wooden doll jerked convulsively by an ingenious application
of whip cord.</p>

<p>As he issued from the street door, the stranger gave
the porter, who was still at his post haranguing the
small boys, a second twirl to get him out of the way, and
taking a gold-lettered prospectus from that official's hand,
strode rapidly away in the direction of the Horse Guards,
where the infallible clock informed him that he had
passed full an hour in the society of the Soul Agent.</p>

<p>Within two minutes of his departure, an emissary of
the dark speculator was dogging his footsteps.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">A CURIOUS FAMILY HISTORY.</p>

</div>

<p>TOWARDS sunset on the same day two persons of the
greatest importance to this history were assisting the
world-movement in a retired chamber of the ducal
palace of the St. Georges.</p>

<p>This palace was now the property of Arthur Bolingbroke
Darian, ninth Duke of St. George. The extraordinary
misfortunes of that famous race, which rival
those of the fated House of Pelops in Grecian fable, as
also the terribly rapid mortality of the last three dukes
and others of their blood, are facts well known, doubtless,
to many of my readers. But as some circumstances
in connection with these surprising events have been
grossly misrepresented, which from my peculiar position
I am enabled to correct, I shall not apologise for briefly
recounting the facts in their naked simplicity, as they
occurred, so far as can be ascertained or reasonably conjectured
up to the present time.</p>

<p>Roland Bolingbroke Darian, the fifth duke, married,
some twelve years previous to the date of this narrative,
the second daughter of the reigning Prince of Falkenheim.
He was an only son, and, with the sole exception
of the present duke's grandfather, Sir Arthur Darian,
and his family, every collateral branch of the race was
either extinct or utterly lost to genealogical science.</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>In the third year of his marriage, the duke Roland,
accompanied by his young wife, proceeded to Stamboul,
it was supposed upon a secret mission from the Home
Government. He there became very intimate with a
Russian nobleman of high rank&mdash;then Envoy Extraordinary
to the Porte.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards the body of the Russian
was found, shot through the heart, in the sea, at Pera,
and the greatest excitement was caused by the event in
the diplomatic circles of Constantinople.</p>

<p>At the same time a most hideous catastrophe divided
the public attention. This was no other than the suicide, so
much disputed about in the English and French papers, of
the young and beautiful Duchess of St. George. By degrees
a general murmur of suspicion began to connect the two
events, and the darkest hints were thrown out as to the probable
guilt of the Duke Roland. No rational doubt, whatever
may have been adduced to the contrary, could exist as
to the duchess having perished by her own deed, as the
bottle of poison was found in her hand, and a written declaration
of the fact upon a table in her dressing-room.
But with the death of the Russian it was different. He
was known to have entertained a violent passion for the
deceased princess. The duke had been heard upon more
than one occasion to express, the strongest hatred of his
supposed friend. All else was wrapped in impenetrable
obscurity. Fabulous particulars were circulated, but the
best proof of their utter falsehood is, that when, at the
instance of the Russian court, the grand vizier instituted
the most severe investigation, no clue could be discovered
as to the mode by which the murdered count had
met his fate.</p>

<!-- page 26 -->

<p>The subject had given way to more recent horrors,
when, as will be perhaps remembered, a letter appeared
in a widely circulated English journal, purporting to be
from a gentleman who had long resided at St. Petersburg.
This letter, I have ascertained from private
sources, was written by a person of extraordinary
abilities, formerly employed at the court of the Czar,
in the organisation of certain new institutions, which
the Emperor was desirous of establishing. On account
of his liberal principles, however, and suspected propagandism
of republican ideas, he became a political
fugitive, and, with great difficulty, escaped across the
Polish and German frontiers, arriving, after incredible
hardships, in the British capital.</p>

<p>The letter in question most distinctly declared the
writer's conviction that the death of the Russian Envoy
was solely attributable to the long arm of the Czar himself,
who, secretly enraged at the Count's conduct, and
suspicious intimacy with a man of such anti-Muscovite
opinions as the Duke of St. George, caused him,
like many others, to be assassinated by an imperial
emissary.</p>

<p>The <i>Timeserver</i> most indignantly rejected this theory,
and with their "noted ferocity to the fallen," heaped
additional opprobrium upon the now shunned and execrated
nobleman.</p>

<p>A fine romance was got up on the subject.</p>

<p>The Russian was an old flame of the Duchess. St.
George had married her against her consent by flattering
the avarice of her family, to whom, though reigning
princes, a son-in-law of such standing, with a quarter of
a million rental, was an object of no small moment. In

<!-- page 27 -->

an insane fit of jealousy, the duke had subsequently
murdered his rival, and the wretched princess, if not
more immediately his victim, had hastened to escape
the ill-treatment of a monster through the gloomy portal
of the tomb!</p>

<p>Such was the insinuated conjecture of the day, and
of the <i>Timeserver</i>, its misleader and parasite. Those
who have perused its French, German, Hungarian, and
Italian dispatches and articles may surmise that there
were substantial, not to say golden, reasons for their
persevering policy on the subject.*</p>

<p class="small">[*A very curious circumstance occurred to the author of this work,
in connection with the <i>real</i> architype of the <i>Timeserver</i> order. An
intimate friend, Dr. A&mdash;&mdash;, son of the celebrated German poet and
historian, knowing from the fact of their having been fellow-students
at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, that the author was conversant
with the German language, came one evening to his house and
requested assistance in translating a most important letter addressed
to the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Ambassador, which the latter had placed at the disposition
of the great journal in question. The letter contained the most
interesting account of the then state of Hungary, which was at the
time inaccessible to correspondents of the press. By joint effort the
letter was decyphered and translated. It told in favour of the
Magyar cause. It was consequently <i>entirely suppressed</i>, and no use
whatever made of the valuable information it contained. How long
will hireling printers and scribblers continue to influence the opinions
of a free nation? How long will the more honest portion of the press
endure the overbearing insolence of a joint-stock imposition? And
people praise the <i>talent</i> of its miserable automata! Pshaw! it exhausts
the patience of <i>real</i> men of letters to behold such childish infatuation!]</p>

<p>Be that as it may, neither the revilings of the press,
the coldness of friends, nor indeed any other outward
influence, seemed to affect the duke after the death of
his wife. He retreated to Syria, and in a lonely
Maronite fortress contrived to pass unmolested the few
remaining years of his life in a sort of savage royalty,
guarded by Eastern mercenaries, and utterly destitute of
all European society. If the world were not so mad

<!-- page 28 -->

just now after the sneering school of literature, I would
simply say that he had loved and been deceived, and
that his heart broke. He was a strong man, strong in
mind and body, like all the St. Georges&mdash;an old Saxon
stock crossed with northern fire. Perhaps the climate
killed him. Enough, he died; and after considerable
delay, the news reached Sir Arthur Darian of his kinsman's
death, and of his own accession to the dukedom.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur set out for Syria to raise a tomb to his
predecessor, and to take possession of the vast personal
wealth which had accumulated in the late duke's coffers
during years of indifference to pomp and lonely exile.
Sir Arthur, his eldest son, and two of his daughters&mdash;he
had a third who was too unwell at the time to
accompany him&mdash;arrived before Smyrna. The plague was
raging. It broke out on board the vessel in impertinent
defiance of all quarantine regulations. Of the whole crew,
passengers included, only ten persons escaped the
virulence of the disease. One of these was a servant of
Sir Arthur's. He himself, his son, and daughters, perished
amongst the first victims. His son survived him by a
few hours, just long enough to secure an empty title for
his epitaph. Thus the race of the St. Georges was supposed
to be extinct. Sir Arthur had had a second son,
it is true, but the desperately wayward disposition of
the young Arthur had, on his growing to man's estate,
produced such terrible quarrels between father and son,
that the latter had eventually broken out into open
rebellion, and the former, in a temporary crisis of rage,
had allowed his son to depart for the continent without
hope of aid or resources for the future. From that
time he had been completely lost sight of. No intelligence

<!-- page 29 -->

could be obtained through any of the embassies
abroad, and finally even advertisements in the papers
had been resorted to without success.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after returning to England, and hearing
the horrible news of the sudden destruction of his late
master and family, Thomas Stanley, the young valet of Sir
Arthur, resolved to set out upon a desperate pilgrimage
in search of the lost heir to the dukedom. Not knowing
to whom to apply for means, or where immediately to
find the Lady Genevra Darian, who was at a distant Spa
with some friends, he set off with his own small savings
in his pocket, and commenced wandering over Europe
with an extraordinary fixity of purpose that denoted a
rare heroism of character. Reduced to actual poverty,
he made his way from town to town on foot, picking up
a knowledge of the language, and literally begging
as he went. He had a turn for reading, and had
imbibed the notion, from the generous sentiments met
with in books and publications containing fiction or
poetry, that literary men were more liberal in money
matters than others. Acting upon this idea, he inquired
in every town whether there were any writers living in
its precincts, and straightway seeking them out, told his
tale with such truthful and honest pathos, that <i>in no one
instance</i> did he fail in obtaining assistance. Now, we
hear much cant about the improvidence of men of letters&mdash;scarcely
any one makes mention of their equally conspicuous
generosity. It is thought a great deal to give
two or three poets trifling pensions, and the nobility
<i>patronize</i> a Literary Fund which doles out paltry alms
to distressed talent on conditions of exposure, which
render suicide preferable to the average pride of

<!-- page 30 -->

educated humanity. Why do not literary men unite
in forming an independent association, conducted
on noble principles, without the degradation of noble
patrons? There is but one excuse for their not so doing;
and it is, that strangely disunited as they are in all other
respects, there is no body of men more ready <i>practically</i>
to assist one another in pecuniary difficulty than authors.
I know at this present moment at least a dozen men
with whom I scarcely share an opinion, who would if
requisite divide their last guinea with me as a matter
of course, and without even the notion that they were
exercising more than ordinary liberality. I do not
know one man of any other profession on whom I could
reckon with certainty even in the most extreme case
of emergency. I loathe the crawling toadyism of
certain scribblers ("before the public, and behind
the age," as my friend Bellew has it), who write
about our sacred and supreme order with a view
to bring even its most insignificant members into contempt
for their personal conduct and so-called eccentricities.
Let them beware! there is, perhaps, a Prose
Dunciad yet to be written, in which some of these
would-be satirists may figure strangely, should they
continue to shoot their nauseous rubbish at our doors.</p>

<p>To return to our wanderer.</p>

<p>More than one poor village poet, whose verses no
printer would print and scarcely a friend listen to,
emptied his purse into the hands of the ragged pilgrim
with a regret at the smallness of the offering. Many a
provincial editor, besides giving from his scanty private
means, raised considerable subscriptions for the wanderer
by an appeal in his weekly columns. Nevertheless,

<!-- page 31 -->

poets and literati generally are neither very numerous
nor wealthy, and he fasted not seldom or was indebted to
the rude hospitality of a peasant for a night's shelter
and a meal.</p>

<p>He made, occasionally, applications to the rich proprietors
or traders of the places he passed through.
They treated him mostly as an impudent impostor, or
got rid of him cheaply by the copper <i>cong&eacute;</i> of a common
mendicant.</p>

<p>How are we to account for this marvellous zeal on
the part of a mere paid servant? Very simply&mdash;he was
low in station, but high in soul. <i>He</i> knew that the lost
duke was the friend of the poor, and that all his disagreements
with Sir Arthur had originated in his inveterate
assertion of man's equal rights and duties. He
recollected the night of young Darian's departure, when
in the midst of a drenching storm he quitted his paternal
mansion. Stanley opened the door. Darian seized his
hand, wrung it convulsively, and said in a firm but deeply
affected voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stanley, you are a good fellow! Serve my father
carefully, watch over him. His health is not good. But
if my youngest sister, Genevra, marry, follow her and
devote yourself to her service. I shall never return,
but remember I was your friend."</p>

<p>Darian departed through the tempest. Stanley sobbed
like a child. His young master had once saved his life
at the hazard of his own, when incautiously crossing a
railway on horseback in defiance of an approaching train.
But the last pressure of Darian's hand had electrified his
heart. Thus, he set out to beg his way over Europe to
seek the lost son of a father who had <i>relented too late</i>.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>How he succeeded in his quest will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>For my part, I can hardly help shedding tears when I
think of that honest, resolute man and his desperate
travels, with the fearful and unheard-of recompense of
all his toils.</p>

<p>But there <i>is</i> a new world for spirits, or earth were a
madman's nightmare!</p>

<div class="center" id="cjb1ch04">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">CERTAIN ILLUMINATI ARE INTRODUCED.</p>

</div>

<p>WE now find ourselves, like the gentleman who circumnavigated
the globe, precisely where we were at the
commencement of the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The two personages there vaguely mentioned as not
holding sinecures in this history were by no means
willow-pattern specimens of human clay. Of the dozen
or twenty persons of genius living at the present moment
on the face of the earth, two are about to be
introduced to the reader.</p>

<p>They were both seated at a large table covered with
a chaos of letters, books, and papers, of every description.
The one was a famous Magyar, the other an
English poet.</p>

<p>Basiline Arpath was the most beautiful woman, the
most accomplished scholar, and the most impassioned
poetess of all Hungary. Like many others, the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
European intellect, she found in England a refuge from
the vengeance of the political thieves and murderers
who, in central Europe, for the time, feasted on the
blood of the patriots, and, by the very stupidity of their
crimes, ensured their ultimate downfall. Strange combination,
which caused the same land to become the
refuge of the hoary miscreant M&mdash;t&mdash;ch, and the pure
and heroic Basiline! of the old and decrepit trickster,
and the young and lovely patriot!</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>But not the eye of the most practised theatrical
<i>habitu&eacute;</i> could have detected in the present attire of
Basiline the sex to which she belonged. Her dark hair,
which was still of considerable length, and once might
have served her for a robe, was now parted at the side,
and curled upon her shoulders, after the fashion of a
German student. Beneath her ivory forehead a large
pair of spectacles partly concealed the magnificent blue
eyes, with their long lashes, and finely-pencilled brows,
whilst interfering with the exquisite lines of her straight,
perfect nose, and full, oval visage. Upon her upper lip
was a slight semblance of beard, which, without in
the least injuring its beauty, diverted the eye of acute
spectators from closely criticising a mouth too delicate
in shape for even the gentlest of the harder sex.</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat, and now, with the companion
of her literary labours, paced up and down the
lofty and richly decorated apartment. The Englishman
was a man of square and symmetrical build, and certainly
rather above than below the highest average stature in this
country. Nevertheless, the disguised Magyar was, thanks
to rather high-heeled boots, within little more than an
inch of her companion's height. She wore a loose paletot
of dark blue cloth, which did not betray the graceful
and gently undulating proportions of her slender figure;
full grey pantaloons, beneath which boots, suspiciously
small, were scarcely seen, completed her outward costume.</p>

<p>The poet wore a simple, and, narrowly inspected,
somewhat threadbare frock coat and trousers of the
student's favorite colour. His arms were crossed upon
his chest, which was broad and athletic; his deep-set eyes,
of a fine hazel, with their somewhat heavy brows, of a

<!-- page 35 -->

much darker colour than his hair, were the only feature
that rivetted attention in a countenance of uniform and
delicate paleness, with features regular in form and
serenely guileless in expression. An habitual contraction
of the brow, the result of intense thought, had given,
perhaps, more sternness to their gaze than was desirable;
but they were eyes of strange, magnetic potence, and were
yet unlowered to man. His light brown hair was pushed
back carelessly from his face. An artist would have
called him superb; a dandy would have set him down as
a queer-looking person; no woman would, perhaps,
have admired him at first sight; few would have troubled
themselves about his looks on closer acquaintance.</p>

<p>They paced the room, conversing in those clear musical
tones which are not unfrequently the property of
persons whose words express the purity and grandeur of
their thoughts. The deep contralto of Basiline alternated
harmoniously with the rich barytone of Viridor&mdash;that
was the poet's name&mdash;a name yet known to few, but destined
to become one of the most popular in England ere
many months had elapsed.</p>

<p>Even while they thus paced the room, the door opened,
and the martial stranger entered. His eyes rested upon
Basiline with an inexpressible calmness of delight.</p>

<p>"Arthur!" exclaimed the Hungarian, with undisguised
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am," said the Duke of St. George, "and
rare news I have in my pocket: but how fares it with
my friends?"</p>

<p>The duke took the small white hand of Basiline in his
own, and gazed at her for some instants, as if longing
to clasp her to his heart. But he suddenly restrained

<!-- page 36 -->

the impulse, and turned to Viridor, with whom he cordially
shook hands.</p>

<p>"We have been busy in your absence," said the
poet, pointing to the table, "your grace will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! still that detested nickname!" exclaimed
the duke. "Is it quite impossible to beat into your
philosophic scull the belief that I really am a republican
without limit or reservation? Call me plain Darian, in
the name of all truths, divine and human; or I shall
think you love to taunt me with the duncehood of my
ancestors!"</p>

<p>"You seriously mean it?" said Viridor, eagerly.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> do not know Arthur Darian, or you would not
question his sincerity," said Basiline, mildly, yet proudly,
with a look of adoring confidence at the duke.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Darian it shall be, now and for ever,"
said the poet, gaily, again squeezing the hand of his
friend with energetic warmth.</p>

<p>And Darian it shall be in this chronicle, says a man
who detests nicknames to the full as heartily as his hero.</p>

<p>The real Dux&mdash;duke or leader&mdash;is in no want of the
titular prefix. His actions make his simple name the
noblest of titles. The sham Dux, who neither leads
armies nor minds, is not the less a cypher for the absurd
assumption of a dignity to which he has no rational
claim. There were many C&aelig;sars&mdash;there are idiot
despots in Austria who still glory in the sarcasm&mdash;there
was but one conqueror of Gaul and writer of commentaries,
who died in the Capitol at the base of Pompey's
statue.</p>

<p>Where are the modern Bruti?&mdash;or is their greatness
proportionate to the pigmy C&aelig;sars', their tyrants?</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p>"And now for your rare news," said Basiline; "we
live in an age of thunderclaps. For my part I have
seen things so strange, and so incredible to all but eyewitnesses,
that I fancy I am past surprises."</p>

<p>"Indeed, young gentleman," said Darian; then
lowering his voice to a whisper inaudible to Viridor,
who was standing at the other side of the table at which
Darian had seated himself, near Basiline, he added,
"would it not surprise you if I told you that I had never
loved you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Basiline, aloud, "for I should not believe
you."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> own that were you to believe anything so absurd,
I should be astonished into thinking you a maniac,"
said Darian, in his usual voice; "but no more child's play.
Viridor, excuse my rudeness in reminding my fellow-soldier
of an old camp-adventure. There is no friendship
without confidence, and before we part to-day you shall
have mine and this young scapegrace's to the full. Now
for my news. We live at a curious juncture in moral
history. Of course, men were always selfish, rapacious,
venal. Nevertheless, for many centuries there flourished
a sort of dim substitute for virtue and justice, which has
latterly been gradually fading away, doubtless before the
advent of a loftier and nobler principle. This principle,
soon to be universally diffused by expansion, from the
centres of in dividual greatness, is neither more nor less than
the 'Love one another' of the great prophet, at length
understood, and after ages of study discovered to be the
perfection of wisdom. The fading substitute I alluded to is
called <i>Honour</i>. Look at modern aristocracies, at modern
gentlemen, the class elect of education, of refinement,

<!-- page 38 -->

of moral and religious culture. Listen to their speeches,
their dialogues, their jests. Read their books, their
articles, their reviews, and say whether the chivalric
honour, which alone saved the middle ages from a
relapse into primaeval barbarism, is not a dead letter
in the present age. What do you hear on every side?
Sophistry. What do you see? Expediency. 'The end
justifies the means,' is the secret or avowed doctrine of
the day. How false, how illogical, how contemptible
is this cowardly doctrine in the eyes of a philosopher!
It is indeed time that great thinkers should arise, and set
their lion-like paws upon the mediocrities of routine,
who meet an emergency with a 'dodge,' a crying evil
with a snivelling lamentation, and a refutation or demonstration
with a&mdash;<i>working majority!</i>"</p>

<p>"A working majority!" exclaimed Viridor, almost
savagely, "a playing majority, you mean&mdash;a gambling
majority, who risk the happiness of millions for the miserable
stake of a little patronage, even for a few
paltry bribes from advertisers in the <i>Timeserver</i>, willing
to exchange a douceur of five hundred or a thousand
pounds for a permanent situation!"</p>

<p>"Legally attainable&mdash;you forget they always add
<i>that</i> reservation," said Basiline, smiling disdainfully.</p>

<p>"They also state," said Darian, "that the utmost <i>honour</i>
(!!!) and <i>secrecy</i> may be relied on. Yes! men dare
to advertise, and the <i>Timeserver</i> dares to publish, propositions
which the guarantee of <i>secrecy</i> alone could render
possible in a city less shameless than this modern Babylon&mdash;a
Babylon, by the way, as my sister Genevra remarked,
without the architectural distinction of a tower
worth describing by an Herodotus."</p>

<!-- page 39 -->

<p>"To show the fallacy of ends justifying means,"
resumed Darian, "it is only necessary to reflect, that if
such a system were fairly carried out, the present always
being sacrificed to the future, there would be nothing but
permanent violation of the rights of individuals and the
principles of justice, with permanent prospects of compensation
to a permanent succession of sufferers, sacrificed
to temporary pressure. But the gold-worshippers
in practice, materialists in theory, and thought-loathing,
brute-force blunderers in policy, are now rushing to
extremes."</p>

<p>"I would they were <i>in extremis</i>," said Basiline,
pointedly.</p>

<p>"Extremes meet," said Viridor; "the popular proverb
anticipated what German metaphysicians laboured
to prove. I am no despiser of Hegel. I believe that
our enemies may go so far as to rush of themselves into
the torrent of truth over the precipice of error."</p>

<p>"Profoundly reasoned, my dear Viridor; you are
aware that I have always held that the great struggle
of modern revolution, between democracy and aristocracy,
sympathetic love for man and superstitiously exclusive
selfishness, human <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> and centrifugal force, ignorance
and knowledge, conservation and reform, Whiggery
and honesty, childish finality and infinite progressive
ambition, fear of losing the old and courage in creating
the new, genius and duncehood, and by what other synonymes
the contest may be described, is at bottom neither
more nor less than the grand philosophical question of
Materialism <i>v</i>. Spiritualism&mdash;the system of Death and
the system of Life. A crisis is now at hand&mdash;read this
prospectus!"</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>Viridor took from the hand of Darian the gold-lettered
handbill which the latter had received from the
Soul Agent's porter, and with no small amazement read
aloud as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The object of this company is to facilitate those negotiations
which, in every civilised community, must constantly
occur. It is a long-established axiom that every
man has his price. No sensible man, in the present age,
even affects that absurd and impossible virtue&mdash;disinterestedness.
If any man does good to another, he does

<!-- page 41 -->

it because it pleases his own feelings&mdash;in other words,
from a purely selfish motive. He expects to be paid in
gratitude, if not in money. Visionaries and theorists
may act from fanciful impulses, but honest men pay
their way as they go, and expect to be paid themselves
for the trouble of existing. The soul, or galvanic mainspring
of the human machine, regulates all its movements.
Therefore everything a man does for money,
or other payment, is a sale or mortgage of his soul to
another person. It is the intention of the Company to
undertake every description of Soul Agency, from the
purchase of a young wife for an old <i>rou&eacute;</i>, to that of a
ministerial or opposition majority. All sorts of <i>cabinet</i>
work skilfully arranged. Foreign diplomatists bought
and sold with the utmost dispatch. Authors of books,
and writers for the public press, secured on the most
reasonable terms. In all these commissions the commission
required by the Company will be extremely
moderate.</p>

<p>"Estimates forwarded of the market value of any soul,
in any part of the globe. All prepaid communications
attended to with the greatest punctuality. The
strictest confidence may in all cases be relied on.</p>

<p>"N.B. No letter, unless enclosing a remittance for
preliminary expenses, will receive attention.</p>

ROBERT RUSSEL BROWN."</p>

<p>"A bold, barefaced enterprise, is it not, captain?"
said Darian to Basiline, when Viridor had finished reading
the prospectus.</p>

<p>"Certainly a wonderfully shameless document!" said

<!-- page 42 -->

Basiline, herself inspecting the production of the crafty
Soul Agent, as if to satisfy herself of its reality.</p>

<p>"Still," said Viridor, "there is in its very daring
earthiness a sort of leaning towards the nobler creed."</p>

<p>"They acknowledge, at any rate, the existence of a
soul as the prime central mover of all activity&mdash;that is
something in our favour," rejoined Darian.</p>

<p>"Which is about as great an admission as that the
world turns round," said Basiline, playfully.</p>

<p>"It would not turn round if they could help it," said
Viridor, laughing bitterly.</p>

<p>"I will tell you where our great obstacle lies," said
Darian, gravely, "not in any arguments our enemies
oppose to us, but in their utter and marvellous ignorance
and obtuseness. The most obvious reasoning, the most
noble truths, the most brilliant genius, falls blunted
before their &aelig;gis of icy stupidity. They neither know
nor care, they neither feel nor think. They stand still,
they fancy themselves well off, or at any rate are too
weak to cherish a strong desire, even of personal improvement,
and they say&mdash;<i>Let us alone</i>. We are compelled,
as it were, to kick them before us, since, unlike
the celebrated animal seduced by the bundle of hay
before his nose, they are insensible to the most obvious
prospects of speedy personal advantage. If they only
knew their own interest, I would excuse them for not
heeding anybody else's!"</p>

<p>"Because, in that case, they would have reached
the acme of moral and social policy, which teaches that
the bliss of each is the bliss of all, and that individual
enjoyment, founded on general suffering, is a pitiful and
dreary illusion."</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"You do well to retort upon me with quotations from
my own system," said Darian, "when you see me rushing
into inconsistencies."</p>

<p>The chronicler cannot here refrain from repeating a
sentiment expressed by him in the pages of a satirical
extravaganza, otherwise much richer in nonsense than
wit:&mdash;"It is difficult to speak consistently of inconsistent
people."</p>

<p>"I propose," said Basiline, "that we now resolve ourselves
into a committee on the general state of politics
in Europe."</p>

<p>"A council of war," said Darian, "a council of war.
We are all soldiers of the great army."</p>

<p>"I would we were as skilful, or at least as resolute,
with the pen, as with that meaner weapon, the sword,"
said Viridor, seriously.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Basiline, sighing, "it is so easy to
fight, so hard to think patiently for a great cause. So
simple to die, so troublesome to work, so natural to hate
bad men, so difficult to love Good alone, and in it all
mankind, friends and foes, for its sake!"</p>

<p>"True, true," said Darian, regarding the beautiful
Hungarian's animated countenance, from which she
had removed the disfiguring glasses, with ineffable pride
and tenderness. "True, it is easier to be dazzling than
great. But before we proceed to council, it strikes me
that it would be well to let our noble friend more fully
into our confidence, in order that no mystery may stand
between our free sympathies. Are you not of the same
opinion?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Basiline. "To the friend of your boyhood,
and to the man whose aims, hopes, and principles

<!-- page 44 -->

are in such perfect harmony with our own, nothing should
be concealed."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear Viridor," said Darian, "prepare yourself
for a rather prolix and romantic narrative. I will
be as brief as occasion permits."</p>

<p>"My dear friends," said Viridor, much affected, "for
a lonely student like myself, obscure, unloved, and
neglected, to have found two such friends, is in itself a
greater happiness than I can express. I scarcely dare
to believe it, and often half encourage the notion that
our chance meeting at the opera, which I had visited for
the first time during several years, after so long a separation,
our accidental conversation and recognition, with
my introduction to Captain Arpath; and the last week
spent in your delightful society, and in such ennobling
labours, must be all a dream of pleasure, from which I
shall awake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like Byron, to find yourself famous," said Darian,
with vivacity.</p>

<p>"I never flatter," said Basiline, "but I feel well in
your presence that a greater than Byron is with us."</p>

<p>"For every age a man," said Darian. "Woe to the
age that cannot receive its prophet!"</p>

<p>At this moment, a well-dressed gentleman entered
the apartment, after knocking carefully, and stated
simply that dinner was on the table, and every one
else assembled.</p>

<p>"We will join you instantly, Manton," said Darian.
"I did not think of it before, but my walk has given me
an appetite; the story must be deferred. Proceed, my
dear Viridor, our friend Manton will lead the way."</p>

<p>Darian turned back for an instant&mdash;he was alone with

<!-- page 45 -->

the Hungarian. A strange smile lit up her features.
He pressed her to his heart for an instant, imprinted
one kiss upon her beautiful mouth, and rapidly followed
on the track of the poet, who was exchanging a few
remarks on the news of the day with Manton, a personage
whose position will be explained more fully in
the ensuing chapter.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 46 -->

<div class="center" id="cjb1ch05">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">A FAMILY DINNER PARTY.</p>

</div>

<p>THE dining-hall in Darian's palace was vast in size, and
adorned with regal splendour.</p>

<p>Pictures by renowned artists, of modern and ancient
times, hung from the walls, alternating symmetrically
with statuary in the purest style of art. The ceiling of
the lofty apartment was painted in fresco by a famous
master of the Italian school. The floor was carpeted
with the richest product of the eastern loom. The
furniture was old and massive. A vast table in the
centre of the apartment was covered by an abundant
but simple repast. Covers were laid for about twenty
persons.</p>

<p>Presently the door at one end of the room opened,
and a party, to all appearance of ladies and gentlemen,
entered. In reality they were simply the domestic
officials&mdash;or, as a servile race have made and named
them, servants.</p>

<p>The Roman empire is fallen&mdash;slavery is said to be
extinct in its Christian provinces. But the feeling and
the word survive. The Latin <i>servus</i>, or slave, has
bequeathed his title to the European <i>servant</i>. Polite
mockery countenances the slavish sentiment, and the
proud noble signs himself the obedient <i>servant</i> of the
plebeian he despises and tramples on. Everybody is
the servant of somebody; there are slaves under every
roof.</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>"I remember, some time ago," said Viridor, on a
subsequent occasion, to Darian, "a very near connection
of mine, an old and hardened aristocrat, expressing, as
the extreme of hideous and awful presumption, and, as
he thought, by a sublimely impossible hyperbole, the
fear that, the next thing, he supposed, his servants
would expect, would be to sit down to dinner at the
same table as his family! This was <i>&agrave; propos</i> of a beer-revolution
in the kitchen, the surreptitious visit of a Don
Juan of the police force, or some similar accident. My
reply was, that such would probably be the fashion with
his grandchildren, when advancing education and improved
domestic machinery had rendered the relative
positions of master and attendant simply a question of
division of labour, and contract between man and man.
He retorted by a bitter sarcasm, implying that I was a
<i>Socialist</i>. This he regarded as the severest insult within
the pale of conventional abuse. Though neither a disciple
of Fourier or St. Simon, I confess I bore the imputation
with imperturbable tranquillity."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Darian, "even to that shocking pass must
we come at last. For my part, I never could hear any
vulgar-minded person express contempt for servants
without reflecting that they were like all living creatures&mdash;immortal
spirits soaring upwards towards perfection&mdash;and
pitying the meanness of the sentiments that have
degraded them to their present position. Every feeling,
every act, that tends to reduce to a machine a being
possessing volition, reason, and affection, is a treason
against nature&mdash;the Infinite Republic of spirits!"</p>

<p>"And you practice as you preach," said Viridor.</p>

<p>"How else prove my sincerity? Yes, I encourage

<!-- page 48 -->

my domestics to amuse themselves in their leisure hours
with reading and rational conversation. I give them
free opportunities of air and exercise. I allow them in
the evenings to indulge in dancing or music, if it pleases
them. All I require in return is, that they fulfil their
duties, as per contract, with fairness and regularity."</p>

<p>"And what is the general result?"</p>

<p>"As usual, the complete refutation of all old saws on
the subject, such as 'Give them an inch, and they will
take an ell,' &amp;c. On the contrary, their zeal is positively
troublesome. Their cleanliness, their assiduity,
their anticipation of my wishes, compel me almost daily
to express personal gratitude for services which common
menials would never render. They respect me without
fearing me&mdash;they obey me without cringing. As to
familiarity breeding contempt, it is all nonsense; unless
by familiarity be understood a coarseness of manner, which
ought never to exist between the most intimate friends.
I am, in fact, surrounded, by friends who love me as the
Arabs love the chief of their tribe. It is astounding
what an alteration a few months have made in their
habits, manners, and language&mdash;even in the expression
of their countenances. They <i>were</i> slaves, spies, flunkies,
ready to bear contempt, and to compensate themselves by
roguery. They <i>are</i> free men and women, respecting
and respected by one another. Several of them have
married."</p>

<p>"And the children?"</p>

<p>"There is a nursery at their disposal. They can pay
for deputies during illness out of their wages. I know
my expenses, which, from the simplicity of our living,
the enormous saving of a common table, and the utter

<!-- page 49 -->

absence of waste or pilfering, are not one-third of such
an establishment under the old system. I know my
expenses, and I insist upon their not being increased by
one sixpence without my authority. I give freely&mdash;I
allow no indirect thieving. I have explained to them
my views and principles&mdash;they understand and sympathise
with them. I have told them that I consider property
merely as an office of trust. I have shown them
that I enjoy no greater bodily comforts than themselves.
I have proved to them that I work as hard as any of
them, though in a different manner. And what is the
consequence? So far from leaguing against me, as
most servants do against their masters, I have found by
experience that on one of them endeavouring to impose
on me, the others have instantly resented the attempt
as an offence against their whole body, and at once
requested the dismissal of the offender, lest suspicion
should attach to the community from the fault of a
single member. But as, on reasoning with delinquents
in the only two cases that have occurred, I convinced
them that honesty was indeed their best policy, I have
not found it necessary to give a single domestic his
discharge, since no repetition of the fault has occurred
in the household."</p>

<p>"This borders on Communism," said Viridor, smiling.</p>

<p>"It realises," said Darian, "what the schemes of
Cabet, Louis Blanc, Consid&eacute;rant, and all other followers
of Fourier, St. Simon, or Owen, will utterly fail to effect.
<i>They</i> madly dream of destroying property in all its complicated
forms&mdash;of annihilating competition&mdash;the stimulus
and spice of commerce; in a word, of crushing the
<i>freedom</i> of industry, and reducing society to a machine.

<!-- page 50 -->

<i>We</i> know such chimeras to be antipathetic to human
nature, its love of liberty, activity, emulation, and acquisition.
<i>We</i> take the world as we find it, and develope
existing conditions on a logical system. <i>They</i> ask for
a new chaos, in order to create a new world from its ruins.
The hope of progress is in individual genius and individual
exertion, the principal fountain of all general
improvement. The political revolution we require is
material, the social revolution must be moral in its
nature. The government must counteract selfishness,
the great evil, by taxation and vigour; the press, by
reason, and appeals to the intelligence and the hearts of
the citizens. When all men cease to be selfish, perfect
community of goods may exist without laws to enforce
it. Before that period, not all the legislation of all
conceivable republics can maintain such an institution
for an hour. But, in truth, all perfection, all absolute
ideas, are unattainable goals. Existence is an infinite
progress, and in the infinite there is no consummation
possible."</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the male and female domestics
joined with perfect politeness in a conversation
on the events of the day. They were dressed simply
and plainly; the women rivalling in the neatness, and
even elegance of their attire, the costume of respectable
milliners or shopwomen; the men, I am compelled to
confess, looking very much like clerks, tradesmen, or
other more dignified people.</p>

<p>Darian took the head of the table. The beautiful
Hungarian&mdash;the supposed Captain Arpath&mdash;sat on his
right, Bernard Viridor on the left of their friend. The
<i>major domo</i>, Manton, took the foot of the board, and

<!-- page 51 -->

the rest filled up the other places. A remarkably pretty
housemaid, who, but for her red hands, looked amazingly
like our fair friend Lady Rose D&mdash;&mdash;, actually sat in
the next chair to Viridor, and divided her attention
between that republican poet and her left-hand neighbour
the coachman, who looked rather like Lord
Ch&mdash;&mdash;d, only more honest, and told several sporting
anecdotes with great modesty and humour, even arguing
with Viridor and his master&mdash;both accomplished horsemen&mdash;on
some points connected with the training of the
noblest of all domestic animals.</p>

<p>What a thing it is to be a philosopher! Viridor extended
his sympathies even to the wrongs of horses, and
Darian joined him, maintaining a theory of horse-education
which astounded the coachman, and may some day
astound the world of grooms and ostlers!</p>

<p>It was remarkable, at this patriarchal meal, that
although wine was liberally supplied without distinction
of persons, the greatest moderation prevailed.
The females, in general, abstained altogether from wine,
or contented themselves with a single glass of some light
French or Rhenish vintage. The cook only, an artist
of some talent, indulged pretty freely, which, considering
his recent exertions, was but natural. The repast has
been described as simple. It must not, however, be
imagined that it was rude, or that it was by any means
prepared in the barbarous style of ordinary English
dinners. Good cookery is at once the most salutary
and the most economical, nor is instruction in this
necessary art the least important part of that national
education hereafter to be alluded to. The intrinsic cost
of a most exquisite dish is often trifling; nothing prevents

<!-- page 52 -->

the poor man and his family from enjoying it but
ignorance. Truly a philosopher feels almost ashamed of
preaching the, to him, palpable truisms, that Ignorance
is the source of all pain&mdash;Knowledge of all pleasure.</p>

<p>This truism Prometheus, by the lips of &AElig;schylus,
that poet of awful grandeur, more than two thousand
years ago declared to mankind. Prometheus, the incarnate
wisdom, was, it is true, delivered from the rock
of tyranny by Hercules, the incarnate Force. Since then
he, and, alas! how many of his Titan brethren&mdash;prophets,
poets, philosophers&mdash;have wandered over the
earth, through obscurity, and scorn, and fiery martyrdoms,
teaching in vain the great and eternal lesson.
They teach it yet. But how few are their converts!
Men have comprehended printing, gunpowder, steam,
the most complicated machines, the most marvellous calculations,
the most hidden secrets of nature&mdash;the most
simple moral truths they have not comprehended at all.</p>

<p>One would almost imagine that the simplest things
were the most difficult to understand.</p>

<p>"Prometheus gave fire to man." To what wonderful
uses has not man applied the gift! Clocks, locomotives,
electric telegraphs, a thousand manufactures, a thousand
arts, bear witness to his ingenuity. And not one mortal
in a myriad can cook a dish of soup fit to be eaten!</p>

<p>When dinner was over, and the cloth removed,
Darian rose, and, accompanied by his friends, retired to
the apartment we have already mentioned. But before
they took their departure, he handed to the <i>major domo</i>
the Soul Agent's interesting circular, saying with a
smile&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>"You have now all a fine opportunity of making
money in an easy manner. There will be people enough
who will pay liberally for the soul of a spy over my
actions. The office would be a sinecure, as I have
nothing to conceal, and care not who knows what I do.
Only remember, it is 'First come, first served,' in such a
matter!"</p>

<p>The domestics laughed heartily at this address.</p>

<p>"Who feels inclined to set up as a Judas Iscariot?"
said the senior footman, amid a general fire of jocularity
at the bare notion of betraying such a master as Darian.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">A SOLDIER'S TALE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE evening was chilly, notwithstanding the month was
May. A fire was lighted in the grate, which threw
strange flickering shadows upon the sculptured supporters
of the marble mantlepiece. On a small table
before the fire steamed an urn of fragrant coffee. Two
long Turkish pipes were in the hands of Viridor and his
host&mdash;even the Hungarian trifled with a Spanish
cigaretto.</p>

<p>"George Sand would have felt quite at home as one
of the party," said Darian, with a peculiar tone.</p>

<p>"George Sand!" exclaimed Viridor. "O the wondrous
phantoms which the thought of that name calls up! Spiridion,
Andre, Consuelo, and all the living creations of
her genius, arise before me at its mention! Do you know,
Darian, I once loved that woman, whom I have never
seen? I was a mere boy, I read her works&mdash;I formed
an ideal image of her face&mdash;I obtained her portrait&mdash;found
it realised."</p>

<p>"And why did you not seek her presence?" said the
Hungarian, "you who could have so well accorded with
her in feeling and in intellect?"</p>

<p>"It was pride," said Viridor; "I was a boy&mdash;I had
done nothing&mdash;I could not bear the idea of a woman's
superiority."</p>

<p>"You surely do not imagine that such a woman as
George Sand would have measured you by the breath
of fame?" said Darian.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>"No, but I doubted my own power. Years afterwards,
though in reputation a pigmy compared to a giant,
I should not have hesitated, but it was too late."</p>

<p>"What! the ideal had given way to a real passion?"
said Basiline.</p>

<p>Viridor was silent for a few minutes. A strange panorama
of reminiscences of far lands and fair faces passed
through his mind in that brief period. Suddenly he
aroused himself from his reverie.</p>

<p>"I claim your promised narrative," he said, addressing
Darian, with lively interest.</p>

<p>"Re-light your pipe, and help yourself to coffee," said
Darian, "and I begin at once. You," he added, turning
to Basiline, "can correct me if I blunder."</p>

<p>All three drew their arm-chairs a few inches nearer to
the hearth-rug, and Darian commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was born, as you are aware, the younger son of a
baronet of very moderate fortune. When we were at
school together, you, Viridor, had every prospect of becoming
incomparably the richer of the two. When I
grew up I was destined for the bar, like yourself. Like
you, also, I felt an insuperable hatred to a profession
which I felt ought to be left open to the talents of every
reasoning man. The conceit, arrogance, and toadying
snobbism of my young legal acquaintances increased my
disgust. I conceived only one clear notion of English
jurisprudence. As the American editor defined England
herself to be a capital country to emigrate from, so I
regarded the English law chaos as a capital nuisance to
get rid of. Visions of a grand simple code, prepared
by a college of lawyers and philosophers, which every
man might carry in his pocket, danced before my

<!-- page 56 -->

imagination. Meanwhile, I took to studying politics.
Soon, beneath all the plausible jargon of economists,
parliamentary leaders, party editors, and club oracles, I
discovered, or believed that I discovered, gross and fundamental
errors. In nine cases out of ten, the fallacy of
an argument lies in falsely assumed premises. Like two
diverging lines, the farther the reasoning from cause to
effect is prolonged, the wider becomes the discrepancy.
Ignoble and imperfect principia being once admitted, all
sorts of delusion and absurdity follow as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>"I resolved to drop my plumb-line into the deep
ocean, to adventure amid the vast solitudes of abstract
thought, and to build the foundations of my system in
the everlasting centres of the universe. I reduced the
three great sciences to three simple definitions.</p>

<p>"Philosophy proper (Ontology, Metaphysics, the
Logic of Hegel,) I conceived to be the science of the
<i>Infinite Spirit World</i>, uncreated, eternal, and self-existent,
eternally progressing; to seek enjoyment and
shun pain infinitely, the only rational or possible principle
of any existence.</p>

<p>"Moral or Ethic science I comprised in the two
words&mdash;Universal Sympathy&mdash;or the knowledge that the
interest of the one is the interest of all sensitive beings
linked by the common law of life, above mentioned.</p>

<p>"Political science I considered to be the application
of this truth in the most noble and extended possible
sense.</p>

<p>"From these general principles I deduced all details.
I knew that Perfection was eternally unattainable, but
that it could be approached infinitely. I had no

<!-- page 57 -->

panaceas, warranted to produce milleniums at the first
application, but no amount of difficulty could frighten
me. I set to work to study the most practical questions
of the age. I saw that but one thing was wanted to
their solution&mdash;MEN&mdash;bold men, with clear heads, and
capacity for explaining and simplifying to others the
ideas they themselves possessed. Unfortunately, I
could not resist the temptation of trying to make proselytes.
With a terrible faith in the greatness and prevailing
power of truth, I preached republicanism even
in the bosom of my family. No man is a prophet in
his own country. I was virtually turned out of doors
one stormy night, leaving my youngest sister fainting
on a sofa, and the brave-hearted man who opened the
door for me in a state of emotion I have rarely witnessed.
My father and elder brother tried to look grand when
they gave me my choice between recanting my democratic
opinions or banishment from their society. I
thought they both looked rather silly, as, without
making them any answer, I embraced my sisters and
departed. I felt instinctively that I quitted them not
to reencounter them on earth, but I little dreamed of
the horrible fate that, with one exception, so shortly
awaited them.</p>

<p>"A year afterwards, whilst <i>you</i>, Viridor, were at
Paris, amid the vortex of its Revolution, and at the right
hand of that hero of modern days, Lamartine, <i>I</i> wandered
over awakened Germany, and finally, as an officer
in the Hungarian army, went through that terrible campaign
which has left behind it seeds of vengeance and
glory yet to bloom upon the fertile hotbed of the fallen
Austrian empire.</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>"There is a hideous tale extant of a man, who, being
magnetically entranced at the moment of death by a
disciple of Mesmer, remained for a space of many months
in a state of living death, neither eating, drinking, nor
giving otherwise any sign of vitality. It was, in fact, a
mesmerised corpse, which, on the spell being dissolved,
or, to speak technically, on being <i>de</i>-mesmerised,
instantly fell to pieces in a state of almost liquid putrefaction!*</p>

<p class="small">[*By Edgar Poe, the late lamented American poet and novelist, a
man of surpassing genius, to whom I shall have more than one occasion
to allude. So artistically and naturally was the story alluded
to worked up, that it passed everywhere current as an authentic narrative
at the time of its publication.]</p>

<p>"A more perfect type of Austria's destiny could not
be desired. Preserved and magnetised by the Czar's
Satanic agency&mdash;we are willing, for once in a way, to
couple mesmerism and devilry together&mdash;the actually
defunct empire is only waiting the first awakening
thunder of a new revolution to display its internal rottenness,
and crumble into irreparable decomposition.</p>

<p>"Well, all Hungary rose in arms against a government
of scoundrels, backed by an army of slaves. To
give any detail of my personal adventures, or even of
the war itself, would occupy whole days, and require
references to maps, without which all description would
be unintelligible. Enough that from first to last I was
engaged in eleven battles, and nearly fifty skirmishes;
that I was present at the taking of seven, and the defence
of four, cities and fortresses; that, thanks to my former
military tactics, I obtained, by almost unparalleled
promotion, the nominal rank of lieutenant-general from
the hands of Bem himself; that I was repeatedly in

<!-- page 59 -->

consultation with that man of brilliant and fertile genius,
Kossuth, and with the other leaders of the patriots.
Perhaps&mdash;excuse a soldier's vanity&mdash;perhaps, had my
advice been taken, Hungary might have been saved.
I have studied the <i>black art</i>&mdash;the art of war&mdash;in the
pages of history, and in the conversation of veterans.
I am convinced, with Napoleon, that it may be reduced
to one dogma&mdash;rapidity! rapidity! rapidity! We
had admirable leaders&mdash;Bem, Dembinski, Klapka, and
many others, distinguished themselves in a thousand
ways. Bem was the hero of the war. But even Bem
was no Napoleon. His courage was greater than his
resources. By a peculiar stratagem, I would have
marched on Vienna at all hazards, fought a pitched battle
under its walls, and raised the standard of liberty and
rebellion in the heart of the enemy's country. I urged
my plan on Kossuth&mdash;he approved it. I urged it on the
generals, separately and in council.</p>

<p>" 'It is the most dangerous, the most desperate, of all
the plans proposed,' said Dembinski.</p>

<p>" 'For that very reason the most likely to succeed!' I
explained; 'and if it should succeed?'</p>

<p>" 'We should destroy the empire in less than three
months,' said Dembinski.</p>

"The plan he pursued is well known, as also the persevering,
but unsuccessful, attempts to penetrate into the
hostile territory. Instead of crossing the Theiss as victors,
we were ultimately obliged to retreat before superior
forces. And then came the strangest and most exciting
period of my brief military career. Selected or volunteering
for the most dangerous expeditions, I led a life of
the most stormy and intense excitement, which I can only

<!-- page 60 -->

compare to a sort of intoxication of activity. I rarely
slept, save in my clothes, and never passed a night without
being aroused, either by the news of a hostile detachment's
approach, or by some pressing necessity of
my troops. A strong constitution and frame, combined
with a will and spirit of endurance or resistance that
nothing could disconcert, enabled me to go through
fatigues which none but men inspired with the fierce
enthusiasm of national liberty can comprehend."</p>

<p>"Strength," said Viridor, "is in reality a mental, and
not a physical quality. Nearly all men of powerful
intellect possess great bodily vigour, especially for the
bearing of fatigues, watchings, and hardships."</p>

<p>"Every fact of my experience during the war confirmed
that theory," continued Darian. "My best officers
had been literary men, artists, and members of the
learned professions; like myself, soldiers by inspiration,
rather than education. They were quicker at understanding
the boldness of my tactics than the regular
officers, whose brains were full of petty points of discipline
and conventional man&oelig;uvres. My aide-de-camp
had been editor of a newspaper in Buda&mdash;my most
efficient artilleryman, mathematical professor of a public
school in Prussian Poland. The Poles were the best
soldiers in the armies of Hungary. What a nation of
brave and noble hearts has been sacrificed in Poland!"</p>

<p>"They will yet rise," said Basiline; "<i>Resurgam</i> is
written on their tomb in the very unrelaxed oppression
which is required to keep them in subjection."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," said Viridor, sighing. "If we ever
could cease to be cosmopolites, our swords should be
for Poland and Hungary."</p>

<!-- page 61 -->

<p>"We shall live to fight for both, and not in vain, I
firmly believe," resumed Darian; "but to my story. I
must pass over all subordinate incidents, and come to
the, for me, one great event of a war without a parallel
in modern history.</p>

<p>"There is a small town between &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and Pesth;
it contains about eleven thousand inhabitants. In this
town I was quartered with a detachment of about six
hundred light infantry, and perhaps thirty or forty
mounted volunteers, chiefly German students, who had
fought, during the siege of Vienna, at the barricades.
After the taking of the city, and the cold-blooded murders
of Robert Blum and Messenhauser by Windischgratz,
fearing themselves to be assassinated with the
mockery of a court-martial, they contrived to cross the
lines either with forged passports, disguised as peasants
and old women, or favoured by the darkness of the
night, and enlisted themselves, as a matter of course,
under the Magyar standard. They fought like devils.
They were splendid young fellows. <i>Not one of them
survived the campaign</i>.</p>

<p>"There is noble blood enough upon the idiot emperor's
soul, and that of his wild-beast counsellors, to paint all
Hell with crimson! Pshaw! I rave&mdash;there are <i>no
words for real passion!</i> What I <i>feel</i> no poet, no art,
can describe."</p>

<p>Darian paused for a moment and covered his face
with his hands. The thought of his old companions in
arms, and of their dreadful fate, choked his utterance for
some minutes.</p>

<p>At length he resumed, in a voice terrible from its
depth and menacing calmness of passion.</p>

<!-- page 62 -->

<p>"Not one survived. They yielded themselves prisoners
of war to a detachment of H&mdash;y&mdash;u's army, and
were shot in cold blood to a man, by the orders of that
vilest of assassins.</p>

<p>"What monstrous treachery," exclaimed Viridor.</p>

<p>"Cowards, who flog women," said Darian, fiercely,
"are not particular to a few murders more or less. I
must hasten on with my narrative. It is idle to indulge
in expressions of indignation, disgust, or contempt,
which would end in exciting the brain to madness. It
is enough that we have sworn the destruction of the
Austrian empire; that we have sowed, and are sowing,
the seeds of its utter and irremediable destruction.</p>

<p>"Every day we were expecting reinforcements. A
body of eight thousand Austrians was advancing upon
the town. Our position was one of imminent peril. The
town was quite incapable of being defended by so small
a force as I possessed. I resolved to wait until the
Austrians were almost at our gates, in the hope of the
promised assistance, and then to retreat gradually in the
direction of the expected succours, with which, if sufficiently
strong, I proposed to return and recapture the
town.</p>

<p>"It was late in the afternoon; I was seated in the
study of a certain doctor, at whose house I had established
my head-quarters, awaiting a little refreshment,
when my aide-de-camp, the editor, abruptly introduced
a most extraordinary visitor to my notice.</p>

<p>"He wore a ragged peasant's blouse, trousers which
seemed scarcely to hang together, and a sort of sombrero
hat, which was the only tolerably well-preserved
portion of his squalid attire. His hair hung down, long

<!-- page 63 -->

and matted, on his shoulders; his moustache and beard
mingled in a tangled mass on his chest. His face was
pallid and emaciated; his hands and arms were of
alarming meagreness; his feet were bare and bleeding
from the rough roads. In his eyes was a sort of wild
fire which bordered on insanity,</p>

<p>" 'Who are you?' I demanded in the Magyar tongue,
which, with my peculiar faculty for languages, I had
learned to speak so correctly as not to be distinguished
from a native by any but people of the best education.</p>

<p>"No answer. The man seemed to be studying my
countenance with intense closeness.</p>

<p>"I tried German. No reply.</p>

<p>"I tried French. The same result.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the man clasped his hands, his face broke
out into a smile, and he exclaimed, to my astonishment,
in the purest English&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'What! Mr. Arthur!&mdash;don't you remember me?
Stanley&mdash;Thomas Stanley&mdash;?' He fell back, exhausted,
into a chair.</p>

<p>" 'Stanley!' I exclaimed, 'my father's servant! Can
it be possible! And what brings you here, and in this
beggar's state? What news of my father, of my brother,
and my sisters&mdash;my sister Genevra, is she well?'</p>

<p>" 'She lives,' said Stanley, faintly.</p>

<p>" 'And the rest?'</p>

<p>" 'I'&mdash;Stanley began, but it was evident that he was
too exhausted to continue.</p>

<p>" 'Stay,' I cried, 'pardon my selfishness. Ah, doctor!
some food, in Heaven's name, and some clean clothes for
this man! He is a countryman of mine, I fear he is ill&mdash;he
is dying!'</p>

<!-- page 64 -->

<p>" 'No,' said the doctor, 'he is only exhausted by
fatigue and want of food; is it not so?' he added, in
French, addressing Stanley himself.</p>

<p>"Stanley nodded assent, and murmured faintly, 'Since
yesterday morning&mdash;no food&mdash;I heard you were here&mdash;I
walked,' and he paused from sheer inanition.</p>

<p>"At this moment, one of our officers entered the apartment,
and announced the fact that the head of the
Austrian column was already visible from the walls, at
about two miles' distance.</p>

<p>"Almost simultaneously, a messenger arrived, bearing
the news that the Hungarian succours were within
four hours' march of the town.</p>

<p>" 'What are your views?' said I, to my second in
command, who was present.</p>

<p>" 'That the town is not tenable for an hour. It
offers too many points of attack for our handful of
men.'</p>

<p>" 'Right! there is no use in sacrificing the men. I
have made up my mind. Give the order to march at
once. You will take the command for the moment.
You will march to meet Solaki and his detachment, and
return with them to save, if possible, the town from
being sacked, and the inhabitants from&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Austrian mercy,' completed the doctor, with bitter
irony.</p>

<p>" 'Just so. I must remain here a few minutes&mdash;till
this man, who bears, perhaps, vitally important news,
recover the power of speech. I can easily overtake you
on horseback.' The major departed.</p>

<p>" 'I will stay with you,' said the aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>" 'I order you to accompany the troops.'</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>" 'I disobey your order, general, at all hazards,' said
the editor, coolly.</p>

<p>" 'There is no danger.'</p>

<p>" 'Then I can stay.'</p>

<p>" 'But if I should not escape in time&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Then there is danger,' said the aide-de-camp. 'I
will not desert you living, general.'</p>

<p>" 'Then stay,' said I, 'double rebel as you are, and
console yourself by the reflection, that if you are not
shot by the Austrians you will be sentenced by a
Magyar court-martial.' But as I spoke these words, in
a tone of dismal jocosity, I squeezed the brave fellow's
hand, which was white and soft as a woman's, in a way
that proved my appreciation of his generosity.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, some bread and meat were brought in,
and Stanley, after a few mouthfuls, became sufficiently
recruited in strength to inform me of the death of my
father, my brother, and my sisters, and my own consequently
changed position and prospects in the world.</p>

<p>"I cannot say what effect such news might have had
upon me under other circumstances. At the then present
juncture, it made but a vague and bewildering impression.
I was too much occupied with immediate peril to
give much thought to anything extraneous. Stanley's
own brief description of his wanderings and devotion to
my person affected me much more strongly. I saw
<i>him</i> before me in his famished and pitiable plight. I
could <i>realise</i> that idea. All else of his narrative
seemed remote and dream-like. Indeed, I dared not
dwell upon the thought of my family losses at a time
when the lives of thousands were possibly dependent
upon my activity and decision.</i>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>"Already too much time had been spent in words,
though not twenty minutes had elapsed since the departure
of our soldiers. My horse and the aide-de-camp's
were at the door, but a distant sound of clashing
arms and trampling footsteps announced the fact that
the foremost Austrians were already at hand. At the
same time, an old workman of the town rushed into the
house with the information that a small party of the
enemy had, under cover of a wood, gained a position
whence they commanded the road by which our troop
had so recently retreated.</p>

<p>"This unexpected misadventure cut off our escape by
the plan originally proposed, and left us but one chance
of avoiding immediate capture or death. It was a desperate
chance, but even a chance is enough to sustain
human hopes, and we adopted it without hesitation.
Abandoning our horses to their fate, the aide-de-camp
and myself hastily put on a couple of peasants' frocks,
which were at hand, with suitable continuations, whilst
the doctor thrust our uniforms into an empty cask in his
cellar. We then, by the application of ashes from the
stove, begrimed our faces and hands, and, accompanied
by Stanley, whose costume needed no improvement in
raggedness and dirt, went out at the back of the house,
and, after a considerable circuit, had the audacity to
mingle with a crowd of terrified people in the marketplace,
who cried, 'Long live the Emperor!' and 'God
save the General H&mdash;&mdash;u,' on the principle of a man
who tries to coax a bull-dog of whose bite he stands in
momentary apprehension.</p>

<p>"The Austrians entered the town with fife and drum,
and the general, who established himself at the Hotel-de-Ville,

<!-- page 67 -->

immediately issued a proclamation that a public
execution would take place within the space of two hours,
being no other than the infliction of fifty lashes upon
the famous Basiline, Countess of Arpath, for her high
treason and contumacious rebellion and conspiracy
against his Majesty the Emperor of Austria and King
of Hungary."</p>

<p>Viridor started at the name of Arpath, and looked
with evident suspicion towards Basiline.</p>

<p>"My sister," said the fair patriot, in a tone that left
the poet still undecided as to her sex, which he had begun
to suspect during the last few hours.</p>

"Yes," said Darian, rapidly, as if impatient to conclude
his narrative, "the sister of Captain Arpath, the
noblest soul and most beautiful form&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arthur!" said Basiline.</p>

<p>"Well, I will not enlarge upon her virtues or her
loveliness. Enough, Viridor, that, not contented with
stirring up the Magyars to insurrection by her splendid
ballads and odes, which ran like electricity from one
frontier to the other, this noble girl, scarcely nineteen
years of age, actually adopted the Hungarian uniform,
mounted horse, and on more than one occasion spurred
through the thickest fire, addressed the flagging soldiers,
and carried dispatches of the most vital importance to
the army for Bem himself. It was in one of these expeditions
that she had fallen into the power of the Austrians.
H&mdash;&mdash;u resolved to make her an example. He
is one of those wretches who almost convincingly
confirm the descent of man from the lower animals.
Like Greenacre, Manning, and other criminals of
their class, he may be said to occupy but a 'mid station

<!-- page 68 -->

between the brute and human being, having all the
blind ferocity of the former and all the artificial vices of
the latter. He attained his present position by interest
alone, having committed, in the early part of his career,
several acts of meanness and cowardice, which most
unaccountably failed in securing his ignominious dismissal
from the service. But to flog women requires no
manly qualities.</p>

<p>"I heard the dastardly proclamation. I had never
seen Basiline Arpath, but I knew her by her poems&mdash;I
knew that death would be to her infinitely preferable to
such a fiend-like infliction. I resolved to save her at
all hazards, even at the expense of her life and of my
own."</p>

<p>At this crisis in Darian's narrative, Basiline, who had
gradually drawn her chair closer to the young general's,
could no longer sustain her assumed character before
Viridor. Her head fell upon Darian's shoulder&mdash;he drew
her towards him with his left arm, whilst their right
hands were locked in one another, and their whole attitude
and expression denoted the confidence of a love
without drawback, the sublime adoration of a woman
for her hero, and a lover for his mistress.</p>

<p>Viridor needed not to be further enlightened. For
the first time the marvellous beauty of the Hungarian
struck him with the force of an explosion. Strange to
say, a deep sadness fell upon him at the spectacle. His
thoughts wandered away from the narrative he was
listening to, and a selfish regret divided his attention
with the past danger of his friends. Strange fatality!
This man, whose bold career and high genius the reader
has yet to become familiar with, gifted by nature with

<!-- page 69 -->

rare beauty of person, captivating manners, and a heart
of the most intense passion and delicate sensibility; this
student of almost universal science; this accomplished
man of the world, without a vestige of worldliness, had
attained the age of five-and-twenty, and had yet to
utter, yet to hear, the first protestation of love, in the
only sense of the word worthy of its sacred ecstasy!
In a great soul, not all the heroic expansion, not all
the fiery activity of intellectual ambition, can fill up
the terrible void left by the unsatisfied craving of
the affections. The most brilliant courtesans are vainly
prodigal of their smiles and caresses upon men like
Viridor. No study is so absorbing, no wine so potent,
no fame so enchanting, as to avert the dire reaction of
the thirsting principle of love. Hence the terrible
gloom, the lasting melancholy, of many great and noble
minds. Difficult to please, they are often unsuccessful
in pleasing. Perhaps the respect their lofty character
inspires destroys more tender and familiar sentiments.
Perhaps a certain profundity in their remarks frightens
by its mystery, or wearies by its incomprehensibility,
less gifted intelligences. Perhaps even the very
strength and sincerity of their emotions cause them to
appear easy conquests, and therefore to be underrated
by women of ordinary understandings. Perhaps even
their very excess of delicacy and chivalrous behaviour
towards the sex operates to their disfavour. But this
subject is too curious to be treated summarily. We return
to Darian's narrative.</p>

<p>"Time passed on," continued the Magyar leader,
"Some delay occurred in the preparations for the
execution. A feeble hope began to dawn in my mind

<!-- page 70 -->

that the expected assistance might arrive in time for
the rescue of the prisoner. Nearly three hours had
elapsed since the departure of my troops. Night had
fallen black and threatening. The sky was covered
with dark heavy clouds&mdash;occasional flashes of lightning
illumined the market-place, which we overlooked
from the upper window of a house in which we had
taken refuge. The owner of the house was a staunch
patriot, but had so frankly welcomed the Austrian
officers quartered under his roof, that they respected
the sanctity of his wife and daughter's apartments, in
which we were concealed. As there was no light in the
room we occupied, we could stand without risk at the
window, and watch the proceedings of the soldiers in
the square below, as well as the shadows of the Austrian
officers on the blinds of the Hotel-de-Ville, from the
door of which building they were constantly issuing
with fresh directions from the general. It is probable
that considerable anxiety as to the arrival of their
main body prevailed in the Austrian councils. There
were not in the town above seven or eight thousand
soldiers at the time. But a large reinforcement was
expected every instant. I afterwards learned that
H&mdash;&mdash;u had arrived thus in advance of his army by a
mere accident, having calculated on the previous capture
of the town by a large body of Lombard and Bohemian
troops under the Count Xavier von Strahlenberg, who,
meanwhile, had been utterly routed by Dembinski, and
put to flight in the utmost disorder and confusion.</p>

<p>"At length a funereal roll of the drum announced the
immediate preparation for the commission of the hideous
crime. A square of infantry, drawn up three deep,

<!-- page 71 -->

surrounded the post to which the victim was to be
attached.</p>

<p>"Every other man in the first lines, facing the centre
of the square, bore a flaming torch. The smoke of
these flambeaux formed black, rolling, wave-like clouds,
with lurid edges, above the heads of the assembled executioners
and spectators, and imparted a mysterious and
spectral character to the scene. At the windows of the
houses, and at one end of the square below, were dimly
visible the pale, horror-struck faces of old men, women,
and children, intermixed with visages of stern and gloomy
menace, that seemed like multiplied reflections of the
same countenance, adding, as they did, to their national
resemblance, one uniform expression of deadly and inextinguishable
hatred.</p>

<p>" 'Can human or superhuman daring do anything
to save Basiline of Arpath?' whispered the ex-editor in
my ear, with unnatural calmness.</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' I replied, 'if you will yet obey me as your
general, an attempt may be made&mdash;not altogether
desperate.'</p>

<p>" 'General I will obey you to the letter. It is
useless to economise our lives. Every instant we may
be discovered. The first Austrian ruffian that takes it
into his head to enter these apartments brings our
death-warrant.'</p>

<p>" 'Hear, then, my orders. Within an hour our troops
may arrive. We must create a diversion that will
more than occupy that period. There is but one physical
weapon at our disposition, and that is&mdash;<i>Fire</i>.'</p>

<p>" 'I understand you,' said the aide-de-camp, embracing
me fervently. 'General, you are indeed a born

<!-- page 72 -->

leader of men! If we can but leave this house unnoticed,
trust me within ten minutes the Hotel-de-Ville,
and the house which faces it, shall be in flames.
I take that upon myself. I can mingle with the
crowd unnoticed, whilst your great height would
render you suspected the moment you attempted to
force your way through the people. I shall not want
assistants.'</p>

<p>" 'I depend upon you. Now descend the stairs. If you
are taken, and we in consequence discovered, I shall sell
my life as dearly as I can. I will not trust to Austrian
faith, and courts-martial of hireling cut-throats. If you
escape for the moment, I follow in your track, and in
case you are frustrated in the attempt to fire some building
in the market-place, I station myself in the foremost
rank of yonder ragged populace, and with one or
other of these English rifle-barrelled pistols which I
have under my blouse, I drive a bullet to the heart of
Basiline Arpath before one blow of the Austrian lash can
descend upon her form.'</p>

<p>"The editor started. 'You are resolved?' he said.</p>

<p>" 'What else can I do? I shall be bayonetted instantly,
unless my first pistol do its work so well as to leave the
other for its master.'</p>

<p>" 'Right! right! right!' gasped the editor, and with
another rapid embrace, he commenced on tip-toe his
noiseless journey. For an instant he turned back, and
laid his pistols upon a table.</p>

<p>" 'In my case, arms would only betray me, if examined,'
he said, coolly; 'each man to his duty. Mine is to play
the fire-king. Friends, <i>au revoir!</i>'</p>

"For some minutes after the Magyar's departure, I

<!-- page 73 -->

listened with a dreadful tension of the sense of hearing.
Hearing no disturbance, I gained courage to look cautiously
from the open window upon the gateway below.
Presently, I saw a man in an Austrian officer's cloak and
hat issue boldly from the door; he crossed the square,
and disappeared in the crowd without having attracted
hostile attention.</p>

<p>"I saw no one else leave the house. It was the
Buda editor, who had picked up this disguise from an
ante-room on his road. I did not know it, but there was
a sentinel at the door. To this hat and cloak we all owed
our preservation.</p>

<p>"Almost at the same moment a procession descended
the steps of the Hotel-de-Ville. A figure in the midst,
covered with a long mantle, and bare-headed, was evidently
the illustrious prisoner.</p>

<p>"I now turned to Stanley, who had hitherto clung
to my side, his eyes fixed upon my countenance with
an air of stupefaction, indicative of either an incipient
derangement of intellect, or of intoxication, produced by
the wine and food taken after so long a fast. I conjured
him to remain quietly where he was, as his
ignorance of the language might prove fatal to us
both, whilst his state of weakness and exhaustion
would render him incapable of any necessary exertion.
I explained to him our position and prospects, and
perceiving that the victim of H&mdash;&mdash;u's brutal cruelty
was already within the fatal square of soldiery, I resolved
to dare the descent of the staircase without
further delay. Accordingly, I had commenced my
retreat, with the same caution as the editor, when I

<!-- page 74 -->

found that Stanley, having concealed the pistols of the
former under his tattered frock, was following me with
anything but similar stealthiness. However, it was
no time for remonstrances. Fortunately the Austrians
quartered in the house were all occupied by the
coming spectacle of torture. We reached the door in
safety, and I found myself face to face with the
sentinel. He demanded the password.</p>

<p>" 'Here,' said I, thrusting my purse into his hands,
'or here,' and I shewed the pistol under my blouse,
at the same time walking rapidly on, in order to give
the man no time for reflection.</p>

<p>"Stanley followed at my heels. The sentinel gave
no alarm. He could not have imagined that anything
beyond the escape of a couple of fugitive patriots was
at stake. Whether merely mercenary or more generous
feelings influenced his conduct is impossible to determine.
We mixed with the crowd unnoticed, and
a sense of freedom of action, however limited, raised
my desperate hopes, and fortified me in my perilous resolution.</p>

<p>"Every instant was now of indescribable interest.
The noble lady was stripped of her garments, which
were of masculine fashion, to her waist. H&mdash;u himself
stood in the interior of the square of soldiers, and
superintended the proceedings. He was engaged in a
vivid altercation with one of his officers. It will hardly
be believed, but he was desirous of pushing diabolical
outrage yet further by the removal&mdash;I cannot proceed.
Enough, that by the testimony of one of his own soldiers,
wounded in the subsequent affray, I learned that the

<!-- page 75 -->

danger of a mutiny amongst the surrounding guards
alone prevented him from insisting on his command
being fulfilled."</p>

<p>During this portion of Darian's recital Basiline had
risen and quitted the apartment. Viridor listened with
a brow pale as that of a corpse, on which the cold
perspiration stood like frozen dew-drops; whilst the
fire of his deep eyes reflected the fierce passion that
burned in those of his companion, at the hideous reminiscences
he evoked.</p>

<p>"And now," continued the latter, "ensued a scene of
horror rarely dreamed of. I pass over my feelings on
beholding for the first time, under such frightful conditions,
the face and form to me without a peer, even in
imagination. The glare of the torches plainly shewed
me the unabashed glory of a beauty, rendered divine by
its heroic resolution. There was a sort of triumph even
in its mute agony. I never felt like a wild beast before.
But then I must have torn H&mdash;&mdash;u to pieces with my
teeth and hands to have appeased the savage thirst for
vengeance that shook my whole frame with its strength.
I strove to control my agitation, in fear lest my aim
should falter, and my plan for saving Basiline prove
abortive. I say for saving, because, had she not died
under the lash, I think it highly improbable that her
life would have been spared by the monsters who
then executed the designs of the Austrian cabinet
in Hungary. But I must keep to mere facts and
bare newspaper description, or I shall never end my
history.</p>

<p>"A new cause of delay occurred. There was no
executioner.</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>"Three soldiers were ordered to advance from the
ranks. H&mdash;u himself, handed a huge whip of bull's-hide
to the foremost, a mere lad, and directed him to lay
down his musket and commence the torture.</p>

<p>"The soldier obeyed&mdash;he looked at the victim&mdash;her
eyes encountered his&mdash;he staggered backwards, and
fainted at the very feet of his general.</p>

<p>"H&mdash;&mdash;u ordered the eyes of the prisoner to be
bandaged.</p>

<p>"The insensible body of the first soldier was removed.
The second did not hesitate. He said some words in
a bold tone to H&mdash;&mdash;u. The latter replied by a
rapid gesture of command. The soldier did not lay
down his musket&mdash;he placed the barrel against his forehead
and blew out his brains. A general murmur arose,
but H&mdash;&mdash;u was apparently unmoved. The third
soldier came forward. He prepared himself to execute
the command of his leader. He raised the whip&mdash;I
raised my pistol. He struck the first blow. I pulled
the trigger. The pistol missed fire, and the whip struck
only the post above the head of the prisoner. I put on
a fresh cap, but before I could do so, the third soldier
had adopted a new line of policy&mdash;he affected drunkenness&mdash;he
reeled and balanced himself, and appeared to
be calculating his aim with imbecile accuracy. The
trick was too gross. H&mdash;&mdash;u struck him sharply with
the flat of his sabre. He still persevered in his assumed
part. The exasperated ruffian then wounded him
severely with the point of his weapon. At this atrocious
action, the feelings of the soldiers could be no longer
restrained; many of them gave vent to such exclamations
as&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>" 'We are soldiers, not executioners! We are ready
to fight men, not to flog women!'</p>

<p>"H&mdash;&mdash;u regarded the mutineers in dismay. But
their officers contrived to restore discipline by actively
arresting several of the delinquents.</p>

<p>"In the midst of the confusion a sudden cry was raised.
It was soon re-echoed from mouth to mouth, amid a
scene of general confusion and consternation. 'Fire!
Fire! The Hotel-de-Ville is on fire.'</p>

<p>"My aide-de-camp had been successful. He had seized
the moment of the greatest interest in the execution to
effect his object with a band of desperate patriots,
about twenty in number. They had suddenly entered
the rear of the building, and thrown some combustibles
into a room filled with papers. The whole building was
pannelled with wood, so that to extinguish the flames
was almost hopeless. Nearly all the incendiaries were
bayonetted on the spot. The aide-de-camp only escaped
by falling flat on the ground, and assuming the part of
a dead man, until the increasing flames drove the Austrians
from that part of the building.</p>

<p>"In the midst of the tumult a rocket was seen to
ascend in the distance. I now knew that succour was at
hand, I shouted loudly an Hungarian 'Vivat!' It was
caught up by the populace. In another minute I was
in the centre of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of Austrian soldiers, and
Magyar workmen and citizens, cutting with my knife
the ropes by which Basiline was bound.</p>

<p>"H&mdash;&mdash;u and the greater part of the soldiers had
retreated to the other end of the market-place. Four
pieces of artillery were only awaiting the separation of
the soldiery from the townspeople to be turned against
the latter with fatal certainty.</p>

<!-- page 78 -->

<p>"Bearing Basiline in my arms, I endeavoured to gain
a side street in possession of the crowd. Meanwhile,
retained by the pressure of surrounding bodies, I became
the helpless witness of a most unexpected catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Stanley, who, during the preparations for the execution
of H&mdash;u's inhuman command, had exhibited
almost uncontrollable excitement, now quitted my side,
and without heeding my repeated calls to turn back,
plunged madly forward in the direction of the spot
where the Austrian general's plume was visible, surrounded
by his panic-struck officers. These, by their
extreme eagerness to escape down the street leading to
the northern gate of the town, shewed that a more pressing
danger than the attack of an incendiary mob threatened
their safety. Meanwhile, a gradual separation was
taking place in the market-place between the Austrians
and the townspeople, so that Stanley found himself crossing
a comparatively free space, encumbered only with
dead or dying men, who had been trampled down in the
confusion. The Hotel-de-Ville, now completely in flames,
lit up the square far more brilliantly than the extinguished
torches.</p>

<p>"Stanley continued to plunge forward&mdash;all eyes were
on him. Words occupy time, yet all I am describing
happened in an instant. He arrived within two yards
of the disordered lines of the Austrians. He shouted
in  English the words, 'Damn you for a cowardly
villain!' and fired both his pistols at H&mdash;&mdash;u, one after
the other, killing an old officer at his side, and carrying
away the very plume of the general himself. But
H&mdash;&mdash;u was yet unhurt, and Stanley, pierced by five
bayonets, fell dead in an instant before the first line of
the Austrians, without uttering a groan. As he fell, his

<!-- page 79 -->

eyes turned towards the place where I stood with an
ecstatic glare of triumph. I left Basiline, whom I had
covered with my blouse, and instinctively dashed forward
to Stanley's rescue. In so doing, I stumbled, and
fell over something on the ground. It was the heavy
whip, with loaded handle, intended for the execution.
I picked it up, as being no contemptible weapon, and
rose in an instant&mdash;just in time to catch the last glance
of my devoted friend. He was dead&mdash;dead in the
odour of sanctity&mdash;of exalted heroism. He had lived
a menial, he perished a martyr!</p>

<p>"Let men who are apt to treat those of their brethren
whom circumstances of education and means compel to
minister to the wants and pleasures of more fortunate
mortals, reflect that there may be even in their own
circle hearts like Stanley's, which demand but the opportunity
of action, courage, and self-sacrifice, to acquire
the admiration of mankind. All blood is red&mdash;every
soul is divine. Less is the gulf between the rudest
labourer and the most polished gentleman, than between
the greatest noble and the least of true poets or philosophers.
In the end the strongest must triumph.
Aristocracy has crushed the people, and Genius is
crushing Aristocracy. Will they never hear us, Viridor,
these children of the night, these darkened hosts of
spirits? Have poets divined, thinkers reasoned, prophets prophesied,
so long, and must, after all, the sword
be our C&aelig;sar of appeal? Must we take the scourge of
wrath to drive these money-changers and sellers of
doves, these place-hunters, match-makers, and tax-grinders,
from the great temple of the earth, which
they desecrate with their cruelties and defile with their
selfish vices?"</p>

<!-- page 80 -->

<p>"Darian, Darian! my dear friend&mdash;the only friend
whose thoughts ever echoed my own!" exclaimed
Viridor, leaning forward with clasped hands, and gazing
upon the republican leader, his face radiant with
inspiration. "Did not our great Master, the Master
we honour by our deeds, whilst ignorance worships his
name in worthless formulas, did he not say, 'I
came to bring not peace but a sword?' Have nearly
two thousand years elapsed, and are we, His heirs in spirit,
compelled still to repeat the gloomy creed of discord?
Is there no new, no unheard-of chord to strike, which may
vibrate in the hearts of nations? True, indeed, is the
type of man's exclusion from happiness! The flaming
sword yet guards the Eden of love! Proceed, my dear
Darian, with your narrative, and pardon my wandering
interruption."</p>

<p>"Pardon the eruption of a volcano!" said Darian,
with a serene smile. "I have nearly concluded my story.
We shall have time for other matters afterwards. Basiline
will return, and there is the whole night before us!"</p>

<p>Viridor listened with renewed attention as Darian
once more resumed.</p>

<p>"The cause of the Austrian panic became now evident
in the shape of several Hungarian dragoons, who, amid
the shouts of the people, entered the square from the
street opposed to that by which our enemies were retreating.
So sudden was their arrival, that they were
present at the first volley of musketry fired by the
Austrians, who covered the retreat of their comrades,
upon the insurgent populace.</p>

<p>"A struggle and carnage ensued, which baffle all description
for horror and confusion. The spread of the

<!-- page 81 -->

fire to the houses behind the Hotel-de-Ville, the ringing
of bells, the shrieking of women, the reports, and
echoed reports of thousands of muskets, carbines, and
pistols, the clash of arms and tramp of horses, all
conspired to fill my brain with a sort of vertigo, increased
by neglect of food and the extreme excitement
of the previous events. I conveyed Basiline, who was
insensible, and seized by convulsive shiverings, to the
house I had formerly occupied in the market-place, and
which was, from the direction of the wind, secure at
least from the fire. Then having seized the horse of
a fallen dragoon, I mounted and rode in pursuit of the
flying Austrians, with the Magyar horsemen, who shouted
my name with frenzied delight, as soon as I had communicated
it to those nearest to me. When we issued from
the gate of the town, a singular spectacle presented
itself. The clouds had cleared off without a storm, and
the moon, nearly at its full, rendered every object in the
plain distinctly visible.</p>

<p>"The Austrians were flying before us without even the
pretence of order. Some had left the road and were
making for the cover of a neighbouring forest already
referred to. Others were trying to cross the swollen
river on the right; and immediately in front of us, was
a small party of horse, making the most violent efforts
to penetrate a mass of infantry before them, so dense
and crowded as actually to prevent the cavalry from
outstripping them.</p>

<p>"Amongst these I thought I recognised the General
H&mdash;&mdash;u. The bare thought inspired me with ferocious
exultation. I spurred forward like a madman, followed
by some twenty Magyars who were considerably

<!-- page 82 -->

in advance of the rest. We penetrated to the very
centre of the Austrian horse, and with a savage delight
I could almost feel ashamed of, I seized the terrified
H&mdash;&mdash;u by the arm, and inflicted at least a dozen blows
with the whip upon his back that literally tore his uniform to ribbons, and drew blood at every stroke. I
held him in such a manner that he could make no use
of his sabre, even had his terror permitted the attempt,
whilst his companions were too eager to continue their
flight to turn to his rescue. His yells resembled those
of an infuriate bull, and he would have remained my
prisoner had not a shot from one of our own party
killed my horse under me, and compelled me to relax
the gripe upon his arm, which, if I mistake not, will,
like the blows of my whip, leave a mark on his body
not to be effaced with life. The strength and swiftness
of his horse saved him. He escaped with the remnant
of his vanguard, as his after-cruelties and butcheries
testify. But if you go to Vienna, before the coming
revolution, you will know the reason why Field-Marshal
the Baron von H&mdash;&mdash;u dispenses with a <i>valet-de-chambre</i>.</p>

<p>"I need not add anything further at present to explain
to you how Arthur Darian and Basiline Arpath
became inseparably united."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">VIRIDOR'S WALK HOME.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was long past midnight, as Viridor left Darian and
Basiline, in that state of mental exaltation when the brain is,
as it were, flooded with electricity, a sort of waking
clairvoyance seems to transcend all material obstacles
to the spiritual vision, and the soul, half disembodied by
its intense sympathy with external life, becomes conscious
of a power almost miraculous in its influence.</p>

<p>Some day, when cloudy verbalism has ceased to be
mistaken for philosophy, when the dim-souled sneerer
at transcendental illumination has been taught that all
is not mysticism which is not commonplace and tangible
(<i>plump, haudgreiflich</i>, as my ex-friend Teufelsdroeck
Latterday would express it)&mdash;some day, when the grand
decree "Let there be light," has been extended to the
moral as well as the physical world, this exaltation of
spiritual potence, this <i>faith</i> "that moves mountains,"
will be recognised as the supreme moment of intellect,
and once more the true Poi&ecirc;tes, or Creator, the
real Vates, or Prophet, will be reverenced by a race who
indeed realise the saying of the naturalist that "two-handed
walks erect, and regards the heavens."</p>

<p>Viridor walked, or rather, as it were, floated along;
for in his intellectual rapture, he was scarcely conscious
of any mechanical function. He did not even hear the
objurgations of a cabman, whom his impetus nearly sent

<!-- page 84 -->

spinning down an area; and he shook off the arm of a
fair fallen angel, who strove to arrest his progress, without
even being aware of the attempt.</p>

<p>He thought of Darian and Basiline&mdash;he compared
the strange adventures related by the former, with his
own perilous exertions during the reign of the Provisional
Government at Paris, where, though incapable of ostensible
occupation from his foreign birth, he had, as the
confidant and agent of his idol Lamartine, played so
important and mysterious a part in those days of marvellous
excitement and activity. Again he dwelt upon
the noble character of the love of Darian and his beautiful
Magyar&mdash;a love combined with so heroic a devotion
to the cause of European liberty. He marvelled at
the grandeur of their resolution in deferring all consummation
of their passion by marriage, until the
achievement of some distinguished triumph for the cause
to which they were devoted. He contrasted their
delicious anticipations and prospective felicity, with his
own mournful isolation. He asked himself wildly, to
what signal disadvantage of mind or person he was indebted
for such an eternal winter of the passions? He
recalled his brief dreams of affection, his bitter disappointments,
his dreary satiations, disillusions, and
disgusts. Then he rapidly pictured an ideal adventure,
a romance of rapid encounter, of mutual recognition,
of love at first sight, of sympathy, of delight. And
then he fiercely tore away his thoughts from such
enervating indulgence, and revolved in poetic phrenzy
magnificent sentences, oracles of lucidity, irresistible
thunderbolts of truth, and verses of transcendant harmony,
which swept him along the pavement as a war-charger

<!-- page 85 -->

its rider, until he also, like his friend in the forenoon,
was checked by a crowd, and abruptly roused
from his enthusiast reveries to a sense of the sub-realities
of existence.</p>

<p>He found himself in Whitehall, before an illumined
mansion. It was that containing the offices of the Soul
Agents. Ever since the morning, the dark speculator
and his coadjutor had found it absolutely necessary,
from the rush of visitors eagerly enquiring into, and
offering patronage to the Company, to engage the whole
of the house for their business, in place of the modest
suite of chambers on the ground floor, which they had
originally rented. They bought out the other tenants
regardless of expense, and so energetic was their furnishing
upholsterer (whose soul, by the way, was, already
signed, sealed, and delivered, in the strong-box
of Ignatius) that the whole mansion was in a few
hours fitted up as consultation and waiting-rooms,
for the accommodation and privacy of the soul-dealing
public. The third floor alone was devoted to some
dozen soul-appraisers and clerks. These drew up
their registers, estimates, and reports, from the notes
and informations constantly sent or brought in by a
staff of intelligent out-door soul-commissioners and
reporters, whose omnipresence in society, and relations,
direct or indirect, with every proprietor of a soul worth
sixpence in Europe, became subsequently a source of
no small wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>But in the private audience-chamber of the original
promoter, the dark Ignatius, was the vital mainspring
of the establishment. From his clear head and bold

<!-- page 86 -->

invention issued every idea carried out as fact by the
association.</p>

<p>As for his fat friend, Robert Russel Brown, he partook
equally of the heavy dullness of Sir Robert the Devil
and the flippant superficiality of Lord John Twaddle;
he was as little capable of understanding finance* as
the former, or politics as the latter. But he had a turn
for share-jobbery. He was an embryo George Mudson
of the soul-market. They called him Lucifer Brown
afterwards, just as Mudson was nicknamed the Iron
Czar. He became a truly accomplished swindler, and
was much courted by the nobility. The subtle Grey,
(a <i>very</i> distant relation of the Grey-tribe, who swarm
Downing-street, &amp;c.&mdash;as may be surmised from his talent)
the profound Ignatius, was comparatively little spoken
of at any time. Brown had the glory, and got the
testimonial. Brown also came in for the newspaper
battery, and the sarcasms of the comic writers; he grew
fatter than a bishop, he grew richer than Aladdin, he
bought souls by hundreds, by a scratch of his pen, or a
handful of scrip, but his own soul was no more his own
than Lord Rattlesnake's. The dark comrade of his way
governed him by a look. Brown had found all the
original money capital, it is true, but Ignatius had
found all the capital in ideas. And everything starts
from an idea&mdash;a company, a party, a religion, a book,
an empire, even a world, must have been conceived

<!-- page 87 -->

before it could have been created. Ideas govern matter;
nay, they form it, they consolidate it, they realise it.
This is one best reason why Materialism is preposterous
as a system. The belief in it is itself a chimera. No
man can really believe in the impossible, and the
material reasoner, by that very super-material act of
reason, overthrows the very thesis he would establish.</p>

<p class="small">[*When I say that Sir R. cannot understand finance, I mean that
he is incapable of conceiving the higher and more philosophical
development of that important science. That he understood how to
juggle the public, and fill his own pockets by a law which is virtually
a legalised robbery, I do not for an instant dispute.]</p>

<p>Viridor gazed up at the new Temple of Corruption.
He read the inscription on the illuminated blinds. The
broad doorway was thronged with people going in or
out of the house. It was all brilliance, bustle, and life.
Suddenly there was a great darkness. The gas was
turned off, the windows ceased to be illumined, the
crowd dispersed, the gate was closed, and the pale
moonbeams fell upon the silent building. Viridor still
lingered against a small stone pillar on the edge of the
pavement.</p>

<p>"Even so," he muttered, as the change came over
the Soul Agent's offices, "even so will your system and
your tribe vanish from the earth."</p>

<p>"You remember the shibboleth of Contarini Hening,"
said a voice at his elbow&mdash;"<i>Time</i>."</p>

<p>Viridor turned, and beheld the Soul Agent.</p>

<p>"You quote but a poor authority. I will return the
compliment by quoting Bernard Viridor&mdash;<i>Eternity</i>."</p>

<p>The Soul Agent laughed. "It is too late now," he
said, "to apologise for the liberty of addressing you."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary. I am a philosopher."</p>

<p>"In that ease, I will remark, that had you not
mentioned a man whose soul is at a premium in the
market, I should have said that your quotation was
rather a vague and unsatisfactory reply to my own!"</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>"Perhaps it has not yet struck you that man, as a
creature of time, would be a monster, and that an
eternity is requisite to render his existence a consistent
theory."</p>

<p>"And the application?"</p>

<p>"Very simple. You hint that yonder speculation
may last long enough to satisfy its promoters. I imply
that it will be destroyed soon enough to please me
whenever it happens. The swiftness of thought is inappreciable,
but time itself is but the succession of
thoughts. Somebody said&mdash;'Work, man&mdash;hast thou not
all eternity to rest in?' I say, 'Rest, if it please you,
for you have all eternity to work in.' "</p>

<p>"An easy creed," said the Soul Agent, pleasantly,
"yet the copy-books tell us that Procrastination is the
thief of Time."</p>

<p>"No procrastination can last out eternity," replied
Viridor.</p>

<p>"He is a nice sort of mystic moralist," thought the
Soul Agent, who recognised Viridor from a lithograph
portrait he had procured since Darian's visit.</p>

<p>"An interesting acquaintance, were it only as a
study," thought Viridor, who recognised the Soul Agent
by Darian's description.</p>

<p>"I should like to discuss these matters more at leisure
with you," said Ignatius, in his most agreeable
manner.</p>

<p>"Nothing easier&mdash;visit me at my chambers next
Sunday, if it will suit your engagements, and we will
smoke over the subject."</p>

<p>The somewhat mystified Soul Agent, whose brain

<!-- page 89 -->

was indeed a little obscured by the multiplicity of business
he had transacted during the day, exchanged cards
with the poet, and they separated with mutual salutations.</p>

<p>As they uncovered their heads in the moonlight, a
fanciful spectator might have likened them to one of the
fallen spirits of the abyss, exchanging a few friendly
words with some old comrade of his former home. So
they parted: the Soul Agent to join a mistress, who
loved him in spite of himself; Viridor, to seek his lonely
chambers in the Temple, where his books and pen
were his only companions. The former felicitated himself
upon a chance which might facilitate an affair too important
to be neglected&mdash;the latter revolved a scheme
of no ordinary magnitude and originality.</p>

<p>On reaching his dwelling, on the second floor, No. 23,
Grace Court, Temple, Viridor's ideas were distracted by
a very peculiar fancy.</p>

<p>There was but one key to his chambers, and that was
in his possession. From the first day of his occupation
he had been under the necessity of giving this key daily
to his laundress, for the purpose of arranging the apartments,
making the bed, and other necessary proceedings.</p>

<p>Now, since that afternoon, no person could have entered
the rooms, and, nevertheless, Viridor took it into
his head, that the position of the arm-chair, in which he
usually wrote, was changed, and also that his papers
were not in precisely the same condition in which he had
left them. As, however, the character of the old woman
who attended to the matters above-mentioned was
above suspicion, he gradually threw off this fancy,
engendered, possibly, by over-excitement of the nerves,

<!-- page 90 -->

and after writing for some hours, betook himself to rest
with the dawn, to dream for a few hours of political revolutions,
Soul Agents, and beautiful Magyars, which
latter spectres haunted his imagination with a dangerous
and annoying pertinacity.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE SOUL EXCHANGE IS OPENED.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Soul Agency was established. In the columns of
the <i>Timeserver</i>, the <i>Morning Ghost</i>, the <i>Daily
Nous</i>, the <i>Cobbler</i>, the <i>Humbug</i>, the <i>Scrambler</i>, the
<i>Globule</i>, the <i>Evening Gun</i>, and other daily journals,
of all shades of politics, appeared the startling advertisements
of the new-born Company.</p>

<p>The world at large, and even the world <i>not</i> at large,
in Whitecross Street and the Bench, applauded the invention
to the skies. The former saw a new field for
speculation, and the latter imagined themselves suddenly
possessed of property, the existence of which they had
hitherto scarcely suspected.</p>

<p>Money-dealers rubbed their hands at the notion of a
new relish for their dinners. They had fed on human
flesh so long that they rather took to the prospect of a
change of diet. They saw the road clear for new juggles
and new victims, and they sang <i>Jubilate</i>, and rattled
the devil's counters in their breeches' pockets.</p>

<p>Ministers, or to speak more correctly, the clique of
insignificants who let things take their chance, and
confine their notions of government to pocketing salaries,
providing for relatives, selling patronage, and
keeping down talent&mdash;ministers highly approved of the
new speculation. They foresaw the possibility of securing
a majority so beautifully compact and conveniently

<!-- page 92 -->

abject as to save them an immense deal of
anxiety in future divisions. If they could once bring
their political "niggers" to the perfection of training
enjoyed of old by Sir Robert the Devil's Sugar-Question
rescinders, who could say how long they might suck the
blood of sleepy old John Bull? They might stick in
office till literature had educated the people! They
might dine in Downing Street till virtue had as many
friends as religion! Till the arrival of the Millenium!
Or in case that event turned out a mistake, until Doomsday
itself! Oh! there was a great deal to be done by
ministers on the new system. Lord John Twaddle was
quite in high spirits. Sir George Grub and Sir Charles
Woodenhead were more confident in their mediocre
feebleness than ever.</p>

<p>As for the great Earl Grub, whose plans for getting
rid of our colonies by disgusting them with the mother
country, and goading them to justifiable rebellion, are
so little appreciated by less eccentric politicians, he
thought immediately of a few more constitutions for
Australia, and a few more governorships for his cousins.</p>

<p>But Lord Pumicestone, the only man possessing an
idea in the Cabinet, immediately resolved to bombard
somebody's capital, and formed a vague design, on the
spur of the moment, of invading Italy and Spain, with
a remote view to conquering the world, and governing
it afterwards upon rigidly Pumicestonian principles.</p>

<p>Such were the vague aspirations awakened in official
breasts by the opportunities which the Soul Agent's
speculation abundantly offered.</p>

<p>Precisely similar were the thoughts of those politicians
in opposition who had any thoughts at all.</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p>In short, both parties appreciated the advantages of
a definite system of warfare, and prepared to measure
their purses and talent for driving bargains with the
utmost alacrity.</p>

<p>Byron was quite right in calling England a nation of
shopkeepers. Life in England is essentially a system of
traffic. The power of capital is absolute in the hands
of those who know how to use it.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there is scarcely a man in the
country who has the slightest notion of what <i>can</i> be
done with capital. Nor did I ever yet meet, personally
or in print, with a man who even clearly understood the
nature of capital itself. As I am not myself a capitalist,
and for a secret and peculiar reason do not intend to
become one, I can throw out a few hints upon this subject,
more dispassionately, perhaps, than persons whose
own passion for acquisition blinds them to the rational
explanation of this exciting mystery.</p>

<p>I shall take as my text the words of Meyerbeer's
celebrated opera&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Gold is but a chimera."</p>

</div>

<p>Now, so far from this thesis being a mere poetical
figure, as some may think, or a piece of cant morality,
as others may imagine&mdash;it is a downright, plain, material
truth.</p>

<p>This appears strange and paradoxical. But if any one
suspect that I say it for the sake of saying anything
smart and startling, he is grossly mistaken. I once <i>did</i>
write a satirical novel* for pure fun. I did not observe

<!-- page 94 -->

that many people found it out, but I myself was perfectly
aware that it was a tissue of extravagant nonsense
from one end to the other. I have often wished to
make this confession, and I do so now, because I wish
to establish very different relations with my readers.
This book is a true expression of my thoughts and
feelings. It is practically and typically founded on the
observation and consideration of nature and man, synthetically
and analytically regarded. There are certain
ideas&mdash;advanced spiritual banners. Their shadow is
upon us. We so-called writers of fiction, in seemingly
throwing the mantle of fancy round the forms of
reality, in fact but strip the actor and the stage of
life of their paint, trappings, and artificial illusions.
We exhibit mind under matter. We are showmen at
a great fair&mdash;I will not say a "Vanity Fair," lest I
should infringe the domain of a rival school. We say,
"Walk up, ladies and gentlemen, and see the live lion
stuffed with straw&mdash;walk up, and see the big names
stuffed with impotence!" Such is our vocation, as
such is my egotism. I would not put it in a regular
preface, for fear everybody should skip it. To return
to our text.</p>

<p class="small">[*"Anti-Coningsby" was written at the age of nineteen years, in
six weeks, <i>currente calamo</i>. Since then, six years of earnest study and
reflection, together with the perusal of some six hundred volumes in
various languages, on every class of subject, have left the writer an
altered, if not a better man.]</p>

<p>"Gold is but a chimera." By gold of course I
mean property&mdash;capital&mdash;in a word, wealth.</p>

<p>Now I think it will be admitted that if a man do
not know <i>what</i> he possesses, and can moreover have
no real certainty that he possesses <i>anything at all</i>, the
thing which he undoubtedly <i>does</i> possess can only
be regarded as a chimera&mdash;in fact, an idea, and an
idea by no means of the clearest.</p>

<p>Before illustrating this position by example, let me,

<!-- page 95 -->

however, admit, once and for all, that the chimeras
are really worth having. There is a satisfaction in
chimeras which is indisputable.</p>

<p>Let us, then, suppose that a man possesses a house
which produces the sum of &pound;l00 a year. Such, at
least, is the description which the chimera-cherisher
would give of his property.</p>

<p>But suppose that within three months that house is
to be burned to the ground, and the tenant with it;
what does our friend virtually possess? A house that
will bring in &pound;100 a year? No&mdash;a piece of land, with
a ruin upon it, which nobody cares to buy, perhaps, or
build on. In a word, <i>nothing</i> in the form of a house,
and a rental which is a chimera. Case the first.</p>

<p>Suppose the house insured. This chimera has another
element. Either it is a building and a rent, or a sum of
ready cash. But if the insurance office fail, or resist
payment successfully? Still a chimera. Case the second.</p>

<p>Suppose the house of eternal durability. What can
secure tenants, or guard against diminution of rent and
value? It is still a chimera. Case the third.</p>

<p>His title may be bad, and he may not know it. An
obstinate chimera. Case the fourth.</p>

<p>I could go on to case the thousandth, but I think it
would be superfluous.</p>

<p>It is evident that the proprietor of the house neither
knows what he possesses, nor whether he possesses anything.
At best he has but an utterly uncertain interest
in the property, for he may die to-morrow.</p>

<p>Still, he knows he has something.</p>

<p>True&mdash;an algebraic X, an unknown quantity, that is,
a chimera.</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>And this rule applies to all property, to all capital, to
all earthly possessions.</p>

<p>Death and taxes alone render it impossible to fix the
value of anything.</p>

<p>Possession is said to be nine-tenths of the law. Yet,
the man is himself possessed who talks of possession as
a reality. We possess, in truth, but one thing&mdash;a soul
and its activity.</p>

<p>Had not M. Proudhon denounced property as an impossibility,
in addition to its being a theft, I should have
set him down as a blockhead, with all his subtlety of
logic. As it is, I by no means rate him as the terrific
monster he is pictured. He is like a child in a dark
room, groping for the door. Some day he may find the
handle, open it, and see the light of day. Till then, I
am sorry a thinker of his ingenuity should occupy such
disagreeable quarters. There are more dangerous chimeras
than his extremely popular just now in the soul-market.</p>

<p>Capital, then, is a chimera&mdash;yes, but a very different
sort of chimera to different minds.</p>

<p>The thousand pounds which gives the poor old lady
thirty pounds a year from the funds is a very different
capital from the thousand which produces its annual
five hundred to the intelligent tradesman, besides giving
employment and subsistence to some twenty or thirty
workmen, shopboys, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Marquis of &mdash;&mdash;'s half million of rental, which
passes not through his hands but through his imagination,
as waste water passes through a sewer, is very
different from the same sum passing through the factory
of the great cotton-lord who supplies half Europe with

<!-- page 97 -->

calico they could not fabricate in small quantities with
ten times the outlay in time, labour, and money. And
again, how different would be the same capital passing
through the multiplying channels which a soul of grand
and enlightened enterprise might contrive. That capital
might represent the regeneration of a country, the
revolution of an empire. In a word, capital is&mdash;what the
intellect makes it. Stamped with a thought, the piece of
representative gold or paper becomes doubled, centupled,
infinitely multiplied, or&mdash;annihilated, and utterly
neutralised.</p>

<p>Sir Robert asks, What is a pound?</p>

<p>I answer, A chimera, a bit of metal dropped down a
drain, or a germ of infinite human activity, pain, and
pleasure&mdash;the trinket of a fool, or the wand of a magician.</p>

<p>What, then, is currency&mdash;what is credit&mdash;what is commerce?
It needs something more than a Sir Robert,
aye, or a blundering Macgrubbins to boot, to answer
these questions.</p>

<p>To be a statesman it is necessary to learn something
beyond statistics (particularly Macgrubbin's statistics*),
There is a philosophy in politics, which these devil-may-care,
happy-go-lucky legislators, know as little of
as the sable citizens who, in the words of the humorist,</p>

<p class="small">"Worship mighty Mumbo Jumbo,<br/>

In the Mountains of the Moon!"</p>

<p class="small">[*For some instances of Macgrubbin's accuracy, see "Analogies
and Contrasts," a most amusing and instructive work, by the author
of "Revelations of Russia," &amp;c. For additional instances of his
carelessness and stupidity, apply to the present writer, or to Macgrubbin's
own Dictionary of Trade.]</p>

<p>And this sort of people are talked of as practical,

<!-- page 98 -->

useful men, lead parties, and govern nations! O my
dear brother literati! do you not think we might do
something more than write articles about our inferiors?
Do you not think that it is high time we should cease
playing the prompters' part to these miserable actors&mdash;cease
teaching these overgrown babes of intelligence
to play at government, and take a little of the governing of the world into our own hands, if not as our born
right, like the aristocracy of blood (of blood in more
senses than one), at least as the defenders of the <i>people</i>,
which we, and we only, represent, in this age of
transitions?</p>

<p>When the first Soul Agency was established in London,
it was high time something should be done to avert
social paralysis. A dismal torpor, not the dreamy
laziness of the luxurious lotus-eater, but the torpor of
a stagnant pool of writhing reptiles, devouring and
leaping over one another, was fast threatening the world
with the realisation of an editor's dream, revealed to the
present writer some months ago in New Bubbleton
Street. This dream was no other than the serene
theory of a <i>dead level</i> in intellect, free from those
thickets of philosophy and mountains of genius which
obstruct the path of the unostentatious pilgrim of life.
This dead-level Utopia of "Buntley's" editor was to be
brought about by universal education, which, apparently,
was to stop short at a certain point, and in no case to be
pursued beyond it. Everybody was to be "up to the
mark" (of "Buntley's" editor), and nobody above it.
There was to be a world of able, but no great men;
lots of talent, but no genius. Such was the tendency of
progress ("Buntley's" editor's) prophecied to me by a

<!-- page 99 -->

very respectable and gentlemanly man in a white neckcloth.
A pleasant theory for a man whose soul was an
irregular polygon, full of ups and downs, ins and outs,
recesses and projections!</p>

<p>I presume that my article must have been below the
ideal dead level of New Bubbleton Street, for it came
back one day, looking very dull and heavy, owing,
doubtless, to the society of other dead-level MSS. at
the New Bubbleton autocrat's. Now, to show how minds
differ in this world, I have not been able for years to
<i>read</i>&mdash;even in the last stage of literary poverty, at a
club, divan, drawing-room, or coffee-house, where everything
else was engaged&mdash;a single article of the dead-level
magazine, without breaking down in the second
page of it. And yet this dead-level theory has no lack
of partisans. I need not cite examples, and make
enemies of half the critics in Europe. So I shall merely
observe that I think it a very flat system.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at bottom it was the old Whiggo-Conservative
notion of Reform; for, after all, every man is
a reformer as soon as he fancies he can gain anything
by reforming.</p>

<p>And the proof that conservatism is as great a chimera
as capital, is, that nobody is ever contented with the
present state of affairs. Every class looks to some remote
Atlantis for their vision of happiness. The only
difference between the tory and the radical (I sink the
hybrid whigs&mdash;as mere chimeras themselves) is, that the
former looks back to the past, whilst the latter looks
forward to the future for the realisation of his ideal.
And the reason the tory is a blockhead, and the radical
a rational being is, that while the past is irrecoverably

<!-- page 100 -->

lost to us, and not to be revisited by any human contrivance
for locomotion, physical or spiritual, the future
is the constantly attainable land of promise into which
we are ever penetrating yet more deeply, and which
offers inexhaustible domains for conquest, and inexhaustible
novelty for our entertainment.</p>

<p>The past eternity is a road that has brought us to an
unsatisfactory present. The future is a railway that
bears us to unlimited anticipation. And to prove that
the future is worth more than the past, if anybody were
insane enough to doubt it, let us take one simple commercial
illustration. We can borrow money to an almost
boundless extent by the mortgage of the future, but
no mortal Rothschild would lend one sixpence upon the
security of the past.</p>

<p>The new plan for speculation in Souls, that is, for
dealing in realities instead of chimeras, came just at
the proper crisis. All new inventions do. The world
of men, and even of spirits (<i>vide</i> Kepler), is, without
knowing it, a great self-governing Republic. The forms
of their Parliament are somewhat grander than the
standing orders of the House of Commons, and their
speeches and acts somewhat vaster in compass. But
the analogy is perfect. A new religious, moral, metaphysical,
or political system, a grand discovery, such as
printing, gunpowder, steam, telegraphs, and magnetism,
a revolution as in France, an emigration as to California,
a grand school of poetry or art, all such gigantic,
change-producing facts, are the propositions of the
M.P.'s of intellect, adopted and carried by the universal
suffrage of opinion and feeling.</p>

<p>It was proposed to the age to bring things to a crisis

<!-- page 101 -->

by straightforward Soul-dealing&mdash;and the age adopted
the idea.</p>

<p>The whole public rushed into the speculation. The
less they understood the nature of the commerce, the
greater was the excitement in its pursuit, and the deliciousness
of the chimera. Money was to be made out
of nothings. They called <i>human souls</i> NOTHINGS!&mdash;these
brain-darkened bipeds of <i>practical experience!</i>
It took them a long time to find out their blunder.
Meanwhile, what victims! what fortunes gained and
lost! what hearts broken! what thrones of love, and
hope, and happiness, abdicated and overthrown!</p>

<p>The new trade had one good effect, at any rate.
Capitalists began to study the nature of a Soul, and to
form more correct estimates of public and private characters
and abilities, than they had hitherto dreamed of.
It was astonishing how stupid people began to find their
level, and comparatively honest men to rise in estimation.
Vanity and self-conceit were awfully tried by the
soul-speculating <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>

<p>Some very audacious spirits, however, actually raised
their market-prices by downright impudence and brag,
not to mention advertisements, which proved a great
card in these, as in all other transactions.</p>

<p>There was a comic writer, who had established and
ruined seventeen satirical periodicals, besides two tailors,
one boot-maker, and a friend (who was obliged to emigrate
to the City and turn light porter, after living so
luxuriously fast, that not even the weakness of trustful
humanity could, in any measure, keep pace with his
downward progress). This comic writer, who could
make jokes as readily as a child makes faces, published

<!-- page 102 -->

an advertisement in the <i>Timeserver</i>, the <i>Morning
Ghost</i>, and the <i>Tumbler</i>, not without a certain "rude
sagacity" in its colouring, which is worthy of insertion
in Mr. D'Israeli <i>junior's</i> "Curiosities of Literature."</p>

<p>I subjoin the document:&mdash;</p>

<p>"TO THE SPECULATIVE.&mdash;Will be sold, a tremendous
bargain, a SOUL of Five-hundred Russell power,
warranted not to turn rusty, even if used for very dirty
work. Will cut up any amount of books or men per
diem, so long as the congenial spirits be supplied for
the body, not forgetting the domestic smoking apparatus.
Taken altogether (and whoever takes it will find it a
taking affair), the Soul in question will be found to
answer, combining, as it does, the cunning of the boa
constrictor, with the innocence of a pigeon (at a billiard
table). The advertiser wishes it to be distinctly understood,
that there is nothing methodistical about <i>him</i>,
and that salary is not so much his object as real stunning
employment. Address, pre-paid, to the Crocodile Coffee
House, Cuba Street."</p>

<p>The papers teemed with advertisements of similar
offers, each possessing its peculiar spiritual advantages.
Meanwhile the <i>Timeserver</i> proclaimed, in its most
inflated bombastic style, that Soul-dealing was a great
fact. The <i>Morning Ghost</i>, and the <i>Humbug</i>, denounced
the importation of foreign ideas as an unjustifiable
attack upon British intellect, and claimed protection
for the Soul merchants of this country against
foreign competition. All agreed in giving share-lists
of the various Companies, which had now arisen on
the model of the Dark Speculator's establishment, and
the money articles in all the papers teemed with hints

<!-- page 103 -->

as to the market value of particular Souls. "Ben
Sidonia was done for the account at ninety thousand,
and a seat in the Privy Council&mdash;Jawes was steady&mdash;There
was a move in favour of Lord Mammysick&mdash;O'Slasher
was at a discount&mdash;A high figure was offered
and taken for Musty&mdash;Shuffleton was offered on any
terms, and refused&mdash;A half share in the Earl of Puddleduck
was rising as the market closed, but bidders
were shy," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Every day increased the rage for this sort of speculation.
Even the ladies, who influence human affairs to
an extent little appreciated by superficial thinkers,
were seized with a passion for slave-holding. The
prices they gave were often extraordinary, but, from
their natural love of intrigue and mystery, were rather
conjectured than known in the Soul-market; just as
certain events in romances are, to use a standard Colburno-Bentleian
phrase, "more easily imagined than
described."</p>

<p>Many of them were less admired even for their personal
charms than for their wonderful financial dexterity.
Capital in their hands seemed to expand like air.
Everything they touched rose to a fabulous extent in
the market.</p>

<p>It began even to be whispered, by bankers and students
of currency, that smiles and kisses seriously affected
the circulation.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the Royal and Stock Exchanges,
Capel Court, and all the other resorts of the Soul-dealers,
no longer sufficed for a raging mania of speculation,
which acted upon all classes like the animalcule

<!-- page 104 -->

clouds of cholera, which of late settled with such deadly
weight upon the metropolis.</p>

A new Soul Exchange was planned, competed for,
contracted for, and built, with inconceivable rapidity.
Barry was laughed at by all England, when the magnificent
structure rose, as by enchantment, in mockery
of his yet unfinished Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>A general report spread through the town, and a
great deal further, thanks to the all-pervading press,
that the new Soul Exchange would be opened by the
Prince of Darkness in person.</p>

<p>The clergy, who had supported the new speculation
from the facility which it offered for buying savage
converts (which the Soul Agents supplied, wholesale
or retail, from India to Otaheite, on the most moderate
terms), though bitten by the mania as badly as any
other class of the community, were rather shocked, to
do them justice, at this marvellous announcement.</p>

<p>However, a Puseyite bishop, who was of a conciliating
turn&mdash;when it suited his interest, clearly demonstrated
that the great precept of forgiveness to our enemies
could not be more nobly carried out than on the
occasion offered. It was therefore resolved to treat
the distinguished personage in question with all the
honour and respect due to his rank and sublunary
importance.</p>

<p>It turned out, eventually, that the Prince was not
in town, and his place was supplied by a committee of
noblemen, amongst whom I observed the countenances
of the Dukes of N&mdash;&mdash;e, S&mdash;&mdash;d, &amp;c, &amp;c, whilst the
procession consisted of one half the people in London,
and the lookers-on of the remaining moiety.</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p>In the evening there was a grand illumination, and
a dinner in Hyde Park, at which some ten thousand
people sat down, for in England nothing can be done,
even in connection with the Soul, without the unavoidable
ceremony of a public dinner.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">PARTIES.</p>

</div>

<p>BEFORE proceeding to record the extraordinary events
to which Free-Trade in Souls gave rise in this famous
City of Jugglers, it is necessary to glance briefly at the
general state of mundane politics in those days.</p>

<p>Political creeds are simply the outward and practical
development of inward moral principles. I have before
explained, and so has Balzac of France (a spirit of
singular acuteness), that for the philosopher, that is, the
observer and reflector, every part of nature is a type, or
rather a sort of anagram, of all existence. This analogy
arises from a metaphysical cause which I do not remember
to have found mentioned in any book. Every
fact, every idea, and every relation of facts and ideas,
has, like every point of the earth's surface, an antipode
or negative. Between the two extremes of un-likeness
extend infinite gradations of likeness. Hence the universal

<!-- page 110 -->

and inevitable analogies which we discover at
every step in the pilgrimage of science, since without
absolute negative there must be resemblance in a precise
ratio to the degree of negation contained by the object
of analogism.</p>

<p>Let those who read the above paragraph, and consider
the necessary connection of all things past, present,
and to come, reflect a little upon its import before they
consign to contempt even such sciences as astrology,
chiromancy, phrenology. Nature writes her revelations
in a thousand forms. Yet under all forms there is but
one Truth, which fills eternal space and time with the
vastness of its elaboration.</p>

<p>The political institutions and opinions of a nation are
plain evidences of the standard of morality it has attained.
In reality, therefore, the great parties in a state are
the professors of various moral systems. Leaving
certain critics and supposed wits who occupy much print
and paper in these days to ask amazedly, "What the&mdash;&mdash;
does the author mean by such sentences as the above?"
and then proceed to shew that as <i>they</i> do not understand
his meaning, <i>he</i> must necessarily be a blockhead,
I shall at once give as plain an account as possible of
the chief parties, varying of course in relative proportion,
but little in character in different countries, which
at that time existed upon the face of our remarkably
imperfect planet.</p>

<p>All mankind, then, were, always have been, and still
are, divided into three great classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The Idol-worshippers, or Aristocrats.<br/>

II. The Gold-worshippers, or Plutocrats.<br/>

III. The Fire-worshippers, or Democrats.</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

and a supplementary class of bipeds, who, being in fact nobodies,
can scarcely be regarded as men at all, who, nevertheless,
are, statistically reckoned, as numerous as all the
other classes put together, which I shall therefore characterise
as the Bosh-worshippers, or Somnocrats, in the allusions
it may be necessary to make, in the course of my
story, to their nonentity.</p>

<p>In accordance with the saying that the first shall be
last and the last shall be first, I shall commence my
description of these classes by the most useful, the
most enlightened, and the most misrepresented of
them all.</p>

<p>The Fire-worshippers, or Democrats, derive the main
articles of their faith, political, moral, and religious,
from the great Persian prophet Zoroaster, whose pure
and lofty system may be conceived from the following
brief quotation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Teach the nations," said Ormuzd, the supreme principle
of Good, "that my light is hidden under all that
shines. Whenever you turn your face towards the
light and follow my command, Ariman (the spirit of evil)
will be seen to fly. In this world there is nothing
superior to light."</p>

<p>Such are the words of the twenty-second chapter of
the <i>Zerdusht-nameh</i>, and such is the sublime belief of
the worshippers of fire, that is, of light, truth, genius,
and virtue. All existence is a perpetual progress, an
endless conquest of Evil by Good, of darkness by light
of falsehood by truth, of mental and bodily serfdom by
human dignity and liberty.</p>

<p>The true Democrat fights under the banner of Oromasdes,
against the fiend Arimanes. His aim is to enlist

<!-- page 112 -->

all mankind, aye, and in a sense yet too grand for mortal
comprehension, all Spirits of the Infinite, in the army
of light&mdash;that is, of boundless liberty, and infinitely
progressive happiness. The true Democrat* well knows
the insanity of a selfish grasp at enjoyment based on
the misery of his immortal brethren. He well knows
the irresistible power of the God he serves, and the
futile opposition of his opponents, who dream of pleasure
in the shadow of sympathetic pain.</p>

<p class="small">[*I have prepared a work remarkable, at least, for one quality&mdash;brevity,
in which I have endeavoured to state plainly the result of
the most advanced eclecticism, in the form of an ontological, moral, and
political system, which will be published at a price accessible to the
humblest student, the instant the reception of the present volume
shall have indicated the advisability of such a proceeding.]</p>

<p>He sees that there is no standing still, no conservation,
no whiggo-finality, in nature. All celestial science
forces upon him the conviction, that in the infinite star-world
there is a perpetual spiral motion within motion,
revolution within revolution, never for two minutes
allowing any heavenly body to occupy the same point
in space, or ever return to the same point which at any
previous period it had occupied.</p>

<p>In the spiritual, moral, and material world he finds
the same eternal principle of progress. It is useless
to talk to him of <i>waiting</i>. He cannot wait, any more
than a comet can pause in its elliptic career. In his
belief the best moment for Reform is the instant anything
existing is known to be capable of improvement;
the best right to power is the intelligence to exercise
it; the best course to follow is to speak the dictates of
his conscience in defiance of all temporary interests, and
to die for the smallest truth, rather than to lie for the
most luxurious living!</p>

<p>He is a Republican, because he himself would deem
it a crime to accept a crown from any source but the
free election of a nation. He is tolerant, because he
abhors the falsehood of belief regarded as an act of
volition, or of religious teaching as a trade and profession.
He is humane, because he knows that all the
wealth of the earth cannot buy one instant of happiness
comparable to the supreme delights of individual
and expanded affection.</p>

<p>And he is a Christian, because Christianity is the
religion of democracy, of faith, hope, and charity;
exalts the humble, makes a servant of the would-be
master, ordains more than justice between man and man,
and points even beyond the tomb to a progressive
felicity, determined by present moral advancement&mdash;a
heaven in which there are many mansions, and because
its Divine Founder baptised, not with water, but with
fire&mdash;not with form, but with spirit.</p>

<p>The Gold-worshippers, or Plutocrats, are creatures of
a very different stamp. They are Materialists in their
way of thinking, and what is called matter of fact in
policy. They do not believe in any principle at bottom
but expediency. They lose sight of the main chance
in trying to look to it too greedily. For the main
chance is happiness, and they waste so much time in
grasping at the means, that they have no leisure left for
the end. In fact, more than two-thirds of them downright
mistake the chimera money, for the reality enjoyment.
I have known Plutocrats, who were so occupied
with gold-digging&mdash;there are mines of that
metal everywhere&mdash;that they never, to their dying day,
knew what it was to thoroughly enjoy a good dinner,

<!-- page 114 -->

and take their time over it. Not only their higher
mental faculties, but even their animal senses, were
miserably uncultivated. Fresh air, trees, grass, and
the glorious blue sky, had no existence for them. They
grubbed away their lives in dusky holes, which a Fire-worshipper,
with the fiftieth part of their means, would
never have lived a day in. They snatched a chop or
steak daily, in a great coat and hat, on a narrow bench
with a straight back, in an uncomfortable attitude, and
having bolted their food, which they washed down hastily,
with curious liquids, of devilish invention, bitter taste,
and bilious results, they returned to their dusty holes&mdash;counting-houses
in the city, or elsewhere&mdash;got satiated
with figures, dreamed of chimeras in the shape of profits,
which profited nobody, and returned home to their
families, weary, dull, and glad to go to bed, too tired
to dream, and very dismal beings altogether, <i>I</i> fancy.</p>

<p>No class of men abuse visionaries and theorists like
Gold-worshippers. On the same principle, the greatest
rascals always rail at dishonesty ten times as loudly as
other people. The fact is, a downright Plutocrat is the
most utter visionary extant. He has an <i>idea</i> that he is
rich, and that is all. He himself is a slave and a slave-driver
at the same moment. His task is to squeeze the
largest profit out of the labour of poorer men than
himself. But with all his squeezing he is a mere money-collecting
machine. Perhaps his wife and daughters
lead a pleasant life on the strength of it; perhaps,
eventually, some spendthrift son or nephew has the
satisfaction of scattering the thousands in a way about
as meritorious as that of its accumulation. It is a piece
of disgusting imbecility to praise any man for the industry

<!-- page 115 -->

shewn in raking together a fortune. In nine
cases out of ten it is a vile instinct, on a par with the
propensities of certain animals who have a passion for
burying all sorts of things in the ground. There are
more misers than is imagined. As for making provisions
for their families, it is mere egotism. If a man's son,
nephew, cousin, or other relative, be well provided for,
what merit is there in giving such an one a superfluous
amount of wealth&mdash;that is, of concentrated power over the
labour of his fellow-creatures? If the said kinsman be
in want of the necessaries and comforts of life, why not
share with him during life, and enjoy the spectacle of
his happiness? Happy will be the hour for society
which, denying to men all power of testamentary disposition,
shall compel them to exercise during their
lifetime the generosity and humanity for the want of
which no post-mortem liberality can compensate. But
of this hereafter&mdash;To revert to the characteristics of
the Plutocrats.</p>

<p>There is a bad perseverance in their dispositions.
Neither priest nor reasoner can turn them from their
desolate purpose. They have no conception of a
higher intellectual life. Whether prime-ministers or
traders, old clothesmen or attornies, they are equally
incredulous of all motives but self-interest&mdash;that is,
self-interest in the strictest sense of personal gain.
They know the strength of this motive, and they appeal
to mankind by its agency alone, for they set down all
people as fools or impostors, who profess to hold such
principles in disregard.</p>

<p>They are all Jews in heart, if not by circumcision.
The Mosaic law is their favourite book of reference.

<!-- page 116 -->

An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, is their
grand dogma. These are the men who support capital
punishment. They have the worst opinion of mankind.
They know how capable they themselves are of every
crime dictated by cupidity, if not defended by the
danger of penal retribution, and they attribute like feelings
to all the human family.</p>

<p>They are so distrustful and cautious where any feeling
is concerned, that they constantly throw away even the
most palpable pecuniary advantage; and so stupidly
reckless where mere lucre is at stake, that they daily
figure in the <i>Gazette</i> as victims of over-selfishness and
miscalculation. Their Christianity is mere Judaism in
disguise. They are false, dishonest, hypocritical, and
mean. They cringe to your face, and rob you when
your back is turned. They are so cowardly in the dread
of selfish loss that they can be frightened into anything&mdash;even
into generosity. And they cordially hate the
poor. They believe that poverty is sufficient motive
for any degree of vice or crime. But they have no pity
for the victim, though they hear every Sunday a divine
prayer for relief from temptation, They have made
poverty itself a crime, and they would have crucified the
Saviour over again, had he lived in their times, not for
publicly urging rich men to share all their possessions
with the poor, but because he was a man without property
himself, and "had not even where to lay his
head." They would have imprisoned him for libelling
such respectable men as the Scribes and Pharisees, and
they would have locked up the Apostles as incorrigible
mendicants. Only the other day they gave the modern
Barabbas of railways a testimonial, and they allowed

<!-- page 117 -->

Waghorn, the enthusiastic originator of the Overland
Route to India, to die of a broken heart, in poverty
and  disappointment. They support the <i>Timeserver</i>
newspaper, and even the <i>Timeserver</i> is unequal to their
representation.</p>

<p>The Idol-worshippers, or Aristocrats, are, strange as it
may sound to unphilosophic ears, the least important,
though the most showy, of the great factions of the
age. They are the disciples of an exploded system,
which they cling to with love, yet have not the ability
to maintain by arms. Slowly and surely they are committing
suicide as a class, alternately yielding one
point after another to the opposing principles of the
democratic and plutocratic parties.</p>

<p>Had they the greatness or courage to throw themselves
into the arms of the Fire-worshippers, to destroy,
as it were, their exclusive life by a glorious act of
self-sacrifice, they would rise from their ashes to-morrow,
like the wondrous bird of fable, and by their new character
of enlightened benefactors of mankind and leaders
of progress, become even greater in their regeneration
than in their old worn-out character.*</p>

<p class="small">[*It was my intention to have proposed a plan of this nature to the
late Lord George Bentinck, which would have brought him into
power almost immediately. My republican freedom, however, was
too far in advance of the "stable mind" to be appreciated. Since
then I have seen the folly of any attempt at coalition between men of
thought and their most troublesome scholars. They know no medium
between tyranny and flunkeydom, though to the full as apt for the
latter as the former vocation. Well, my noble boobies, if you will
not be our friends, you shall be our instruments. We will drive you
before us with the sword of reason and the whip of satire. We are
the stronger. Even whilst I write, the hour is striking, and the
balance turns in our favour. The press is no longer the fourth estate,
but the first! Hear this, and sneer, if you will, my lords and gentlemen.
I do not sneer&mdash;I strike!]</p>

<!-- page 118 -->

<p>But they have neither the devotion nor the intelligence,
as a class, required for such heroism. On the
contrary, deluded by the hollow cat-like caresses of
their deadly foes, the Plutocrats, they have by a thousand
concessions endeavoured to conciliate that implacable
and heartless race. Fools! when by making
one tithe of those concessions to the honest, working,
suffering people, they might have defied for ages the
brood of deadly vermin who, slowly and surely, are
devouring every vestige of their ancient glories, whilst
the wise sons of light look on with stern indifference,
prepared to crush the Plutocrat, so soon as the destruction
of the helpless Aristocrat shall have been satisfactorily
accomplished by his agency.</p>

<p>These Aristocrats, or Idol-worshippers, found their
practical creed upon the Greeko-Egyptian Mythology.
Their education is Greek, or primarily Egyptian, at the
fountain-head. They fill their minds with traditions,
legends, and fabulous pedigrees. Like the Greeks and
Romans, they believe themselves the descendants of the
Gods. They fancy that something of the ancestral
hero or demi-god still mingles in their blood. Though
they admit that the first man was made in the image of
his Creator, they have a secret suspicion that the family
likeness is better preserved in their own case than in
others. They flatter themselves that they are china
and the populace wedgewood; that they have some
mysterious superiority, quite apart from education and
other natural influences. They despise everybody but
themselves, and they despise one another also.</p>

<p>Any man may profess Democracy or Plutocracy, and
be recognized as a real Fire or Gold-worshipper by the

<!-- page 119 -->

followers of Moses and Zoroaster. But to be received
by the Idolaters it is necessary to be something more
than an Idol-worshipper. You must prove your descent
from the Idols themselves (<i>Eidola</i>, or chimeras), not
that there is much reality in these pedigrees&mdash;on the
contrary, they are notoriously easy of fabrication.
Men live by contriving them. It is the Aristocratic
chimera which is found to answer, whether sham or real,
with equal virtue&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"For well we know that serving men and grooms<br/>

Oft give the lie to half an hundred tombs."</p>

<p>I have now briefly described the three leading forms
of opinion in the civilised world. They will be rarely
found in their pure and unadulterated strength. Few
Fire-worshippers are free from a dash of idolatry&mdash;or,
at least, of Hero-worship&mdash;a noble weakness, but still a
weakness in the eyes of a philosophic Gueber, whose
Gods are the eternal abstractions, the never-to-be-attained,
but for ever approached, ideals of beauty, happiness,
and wisdom.</p>

<p>Let who will stay to worship Cromwell. The true
Fire-worshipper has left Cromwell behind him, nay,
perchance, he may be Cromwell himself&mdash;a new incarnation,
revived and strengthened for a grander and more
terrible contest.</p>

<p>In like manner the Aristocrat and Plutocrat, with
feeble dashes of Democracy, are mingled in infinite
variety of proportion, till, in the end, results the Bosh-worshipper,
or Somnocrat, who does not know his own
opinion on any subject but his immediate wants, who is
swayed by every latest speaker, ignorant of every principle
of policy, and, whatever his station may be, from

<!-- page 120 -->

the peer down to the ploughboy, in terrible want of a
rational and initiative education. He is a mental sleep-walker.
He is one of the mob. He is the human ether
in which the real Aristoi of intellect float like the
vessels on the seas. He does not read this book, and
if he did he would not understand it.</p>

<p>Thus the reader, being far from a Bosh-worshipper,
will understand what I mean, in the course of the hundred
volumes I may have occasion to publish before
Fire-worship becomes the established system, by the
terms&mdash;Idol-worshipper, Greek or Aristocrat; Gold-worshipper,
Jew or Plutocrat; and Fire-worshipper,
Gueber or Democrat.</p>

<p>As, however, life is uncertain, and I may possibly die
before completing this work, much less the other ninety-nine
threatened volumes, I entreat the young thinkers
of the age to treasure up in their memory the above association
of ideas (mnemonically arranged for the purpose),
in order that they may escape the infernal confusion
of all real moral distinctions which the brilliant
but contradictory journalism of the day is so apt to
induce. * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The sun is setting. I hear the murmur of the human
ocean, the mighty hum of the vast and potent city&mdash;I
feel as an orator addressing a mighty army. Young
England! it is your cause I am pleading! Your
would-be leader has been thrown down long since, with
his antiquated follies&mdash;but it is no leadership that I would
wish to usurp! A curse on the hateful ambition which
tempts the sacrifice of principle for power. Better to
be loved by one spirit in Nature than to be bowed down
to by all the hosts of heaven. Youth of England!

<!-- page 121 -->

give me a little corner in your hearts; believe in my
sincerity, even should you deride my pretensions.</p>

<p>There is but one real pay for the soldier of thought&mdash;the
affection of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">AN ANGEL VISIT.</p>

</div>

<p>IN this world one thing is as important as another.
Twice two make four. Every atom of the universe
vibrates in accordance with every other atom. Above
all, the lightest breath of passion reacts with intense
potence upon all passionate entities. Hence the loves
or love-dreams of such a man as Bernard Viridor are by
no means unimportant to an episode in modern history
like the present. Just as every body in space must be
<i>somewhere</i>, must occupy some portion of the infinite
extension (<i>vide</i> Baruch Spinoza), so a strong and
reckless Fire-worshipper must be doing some very considerable
amount of good or evil, by commission or
omission, during every active moment of his being.</p>

<p>Therefore, my dear brother Fire-worshippers, let me
entreat you to beware of falling in love just at present.
For my part, I wish I could ensure my heart against
fire (of that description) until the Republic (metaphorically
speaking) were fairly established in the five great
empires of Europe, and sundry smaller nationalities.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks Viridor had been much troubled
in his mind. Almost daily for several hours in
consultation with Darian and Basiline, he had gradually
allowed his interest in the beautiful Magyar to deepen
into an intensely painful sentiment. It is superfluous
to say, that never for one instant did the idea cross

<!-- page 123 -->

Viridor's imagination that she could be more to him
than the wife of his dearest friend. In these grand
natures justice and honour are instincts too powerful
for question or sophistication. Basiline was Darian's.
Viridor knew it. Darian was his friend. The poet-philosopher
would have despised himself had he allowed
one covetous thought or impure desire to rise in his
breast with regard to Basiline. Yet he felt as one</p>

<p class="small">"From Paradise an outcast,<br/>

"Who weeping sits at the forbidden gates."*</p>

<p class="small">[*Lamartine's "Poetic Meditations." I could wish for the sake of the
marvellously beautiful ideas and images contained in these early poems
of Lamartine, that they should become popular in England. My
translation was a true labour of love, for I gained neither money nor
fame by the work. The Press almost universally ignored the book
on account of the cheap form in which it was published. A single
thousand copies only have been sold, although Lamartine said, in
a letter of exquisite delicacy, written to me on the occasion, "Henceforward
my work is as much yours as my own." It would seem that
my poems were destined to as just a fate as his policy in <i>its</i> translation,
according to the <i>Timeserver</i>. I would fain see this neglect remedied,
not from personal interest, but because I should like to share
with others the enjoyment of such writing as France's greatest bard's,
with whom but one living poet, Alfred Tennyson, can be even
compared by a student superior to all bias of national or stylistic
prejudice. The translation has, at least, one chance of publicity.
Though the reviewers scorned it, the publisher stereotyped it.]</p>

<p>Why had not Basiline a sister, the counterpart of
herself, to make his happiness as she made Darian's?</p>

<p>Viridor strove to resist the fever of vague desire
that consumed him. He was not one of those who can
quench the flame of the spirit in the degrading satisfactions
of the flesh. To use the phrase of our ducal
Republican, Viridor was a volcano in eruption. For
years past, from the dawn of manhood, and the first
storm of youthful passion, the sails of whose vessel were
swelled by fancy and boyish sensuality, he had exercised

<!-- page 124 -->

a stern control over his feelings. I do not mean that
he had been a Puritan. Such folly were incompatible
with the nature of one imbued with the profoundest
knowledge of man's mental and physical requirements.
But he had remained cold, calculating, and indifferent
with regard to the fairer sex. He had cherished his
ideal&mdash;he had no longer dreamed of seeking it. Once or
twice he had caught vague glimpses of seraphic forms,
eyes lighted with the true fire, but they came like
shadows, and departed. They eluded his grasp, or dissolved
into commonplace phantoms, in his eager embraces.
They borrowed their enchantment from distance.
He lost the impression before it had placed its stamp
upon his heart. He was still Viridor the lonely, the
sombre inhabitant of the unmeasured Vast, the dweller
amid Titan thoughts&mdash;dim, nameless, abstract rulers of
the Infinite world of spirits.</p>

<p>He had concentrated the rays of his spirit on two
points in existence,&mdash;Humanity, that is, the liberty and
happiness of mankind; and Friendship, that is, the immediate
interchange of sympathetic ideas with men of
noble feelings and lofty intelligence like his own.</p>

<p>But the noblest and most expanded philanthropy,
however it may elevate the mind, partakes often of the
sad dignity of Prometheus on his rock&mdash;the vulture grief
yet lacerates the breast, and Jove (the worldly tyranny
of inferior spirits) yet taunts his victim from the established
throne of power.</p>

<p>And friendship, how rare is its perfection? In boyhood
it shines most brightly&mdash;it is indeed a passion, as
D'Israeli boldly describes it.</p>

<p>I recollect in a critique on "Coningsby," the reviewer

<!-- page 125 -->

denouncing that passage, one of the best and truest in
the work, as an example of preposterous exaggeration.</p>

<p>There is little chance of sympathy in opinion between
the author of "Coningsby" and his satirist. Yet I am
glad to take this opportunity of reparation for an
attack, however well deserved, far too extravagant and
personal to admit of literary justification. In my opinion
the Protectionist leader is a man of brilliant imagination,
keen perception, profound analysis, and at bottom noble
and generous sentiments. Selfish ambition has blasted
him like a lightning-stricken oak. His intellectual life,
his splendid invention, are paralysed by the falsity of
his position. At heart he is a Fire-worshipper. His
aristocratic fury is a mania, a melancholy disease. An
aristocrat of nature's making, what hideous madness
drives him to sell his soul for the homage of an aristocracy
of acres, whose nobility, indeed, perpetually springs
from the dunghill which they throw in the teeth of the
parvenu?</p>

<p>But it is not even yet too late. He stands high
enough for heroism. Let him shake off his own chains,
let him liberate the <i>noble</i> slaves on whose subjection he
weakly prides himself, let him renounce the insane
project of mounting to heaven on a Babel tower of material
grossness, let him be himself once more in defiance
of party and in contempt of office, let him stand forward
as the impartial champion of the truth of the
people and his own nobler nature, and I will not hesitate
to entreat his pardon for all the ridicule I have heaped
upon him. For, by the light of heaven! this man's
genius is deserving of a grander cause than the mere
advocacy of high rents <i>versus</i> Manchester cotton-spinners!</p>

<!-- page 126 -->

<p>To return to Viridor and friendship. It is only in
boyhood that friendship can satisfy the heart. It has
no guarantee of duration. How many devoted friends
does a man, in the course of his life, lose sight of for
ever! How many disappear gradually by unaccountable
coldness! How many are lost by a chance word, an
accidental slight, a difference of opinion, or a coincidence
of admiration! We soon grow accustomed to
these losses. We respect and esteem our acquaintance
whose characters command our appreciation, but we no
longer build our happiness on individual attachment.
We know the evanescence of friendship, we enjoy it
calmly, free from the lover-like jealousy, doubts, quarrels,
and reconciliations of boyhood. Youthful friendships
are too often indiscriminating impulses, the friendships
of manhood are founded upon judgment and reason.
All this the young poet felt, and was lonely even with
his friends.</p>

<p>Viridor could not banish from his thoughts the vision
of the Hungarian's beauty. In the middle of his
political and philosophical analyses he paused, laid down
the pen, and mused on Basiline. The tones of her voice,
her exquisite gentleness, combined with such heroic daring,
her graceful attitudes and motions, all combined to
perplex and unsettle his mind. He could not be said to
love Basiline, for the utter absence of hope prevented
him from contemplating such a possibility. He thought
of her as of a beautiful type, of something he longed
for, yet despaired of finding.</p>

<p>But desire, like faith, is a potent magician, and often
does much to bring about its own fulfilment.</p>

<p>It was evening, and Viridor sat alone in his chambers.

<!-- page 127 -->

His sitting-room was a large dreary-looking apartment.
The walls were of panel, in colour of a dingy brown,
which once had approximated to white, but was now
dirtying fast in the direction of mahogany. The high
mantlepiece was of carved oak. There was but little
furniture in the room. The most important item was
a large square table in the centre, at which Viridor,
seated in an old arm-chair, was then writing, or rather
trying to write; for he drew caricatures on the margin
of his M.S. in an absent manner, and especially made
several attempts to delineate a profile of exquisite
purity and delicacy, which resembled in part the ideas
originally formed of the virgin mother, in part the ideal
type of Faust's Margaret, with a certain indescribable
<i>espieglerie</i> which belonged neither to the saint nor to
the sinner in question.</p>

<p>He was interrupted in the creation of these remarkably
slight works of art, by a gentle knocking
at the door. For full an hour he had been listening
with the keenest attention for the footsteps of his
expected guest upon the stairs; nevertheless, he was
taken by surprise after all, in a moment of abstraction.
He rose hastily, almost sprang to the door, opened it,
and admitted, a female figure of slight, graceful outline.
The lamp upon the table had a non-transparent shade,
consequently the only parts of the room it lighted to
any extent were a large circle on the table and a small
circle on the ceiling. The latter, by the way, was very
deceptive in the notion it conveyed of the colour of
the plaster, which the smoke of more than one tenant
had darkened without the interposition of renovating
whitewash.</p>

<!-- page 128 -->

<p>"How glad I am to see you!" exclaimed Viridor,
taking the hand of his visitor, and raising it to his lips;
"I hardly ventured to hope you would really come."</p>

<p>"I promised, so I kept my word," said a voice of
silvery softness.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated," said Viridor, and he looked round
for a chair. There were several in the room. But on
one was a pile of papers, on another books, on a third
a drawing-box, and he was ultimately obliged to offer
the seat which he had just risen from, and to seat himself
provisionally on the chair covered by the smallest
pile of papers. Indeed, not only did books and papers
encumber the chairs, tables, and mantleshelf, besides
various more orthodox receptacles, but they were even
scattered over the floor, and in one corner of the room,
underneath an easel, formed a chaotic pyramid of books,
MSS., drawing-boards, and old gloves, which filled the
members of the party of order who came there with
downright despair.</p>

<p>From week to week Viridor had contemplated a clearing
up and arrangement of this literary chaos. But his incessant
occupation, and repugnance to all mechanical
exertion, had caused him to postpone the mighty effort,
until the confusion had reached a pitch which would have
daunted the boldest of reformers. As for allowing any
profane hand to touch his sacred medley of Sybiline
leaves, it need scarcely be mentioned that the bare
idea filled him with horror.</p>

<p>"Never touch a scrap of paper in my rooms," was
Viridor's injunction to his laundress, delivered in so
solemn a tone that the old woman would have committed
sacrilege off-hand in the nearest cathedral rather than
have transgressed this injunction of the poet's.</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>It may be imagined that the papers became a rather
dusty chaos in time. Viridor's chambers were a good
place to read Goethe's Faust in.</p>

<p>The lord of this sombre domicile removed the shade
from the lamp, and thus revealed all the disorder of the
scene, which his fair visitor regarded with no small
amazement.</p>

<p>For his part, Viridor drank in the beauty of a face
which it will require all the art of description I possess,
not to mention what I may steal or borrow, to pourtray
but feebly to the eye of the indulgent reader.</p>

<p>Reversing the usual formula of novelists, I may say
that it was a face more easily described than imagined.
That is, every word of my description may be correct,
and yet may fail to convey to another the impression
which I desire to reproduce.</p>

<p>The age of the stranger might be about seventeen
years. The innocence of the child seemed to mingle
with the conscious dignity of the woman in her fair
oval countenance. Her broad longlashed eyelids drooped
with a charming modesty. Her half-opened mouth,
faultless in its classical formation, revealed teeth white
as the cliffs of England seen from a distant vessel,
regular as the pearls of a lady's necklace. She was
pale by the natural complexion of her fair clear skin;
and her silky hair, which was banded on either side of
her forehead, was of a rich yet far from deep brown, a
sort of intermediate tint between blond and auburn,
which, like her finely marked brows, looked dark in contrast
with the forehead it encircled.</p>

<p>When she spoke she fixed her soft calm eyes upon
Viridor's features with an inexpressible gentleness.</p>

<!-- page 130 -->

<p>The rudest libertine would have hesitated to insult
such incarnate purity. The most abject worshippers of
gold or rank could not have ventured on an impertinence,
though she wore but a little black shawl of the humblest
manufacture, and a plain cotton dress faded in colour
by repeated washing. A close straw bonnet, lined with
blue silk, completed her external attire, and formed an
artistic setting for the gem of beauty it contained.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how much beauty gains by a wise
selection in the hues of its adornments. I should like to
see some ladies I meet occasionally, introduced into a
picture with their rainbow glories. And I should like to
see some artists I know take lessons in prismatic harmony
from certain other scientific enchantresses of my
acquaintance! It would be a mutual profit, I assure
them.</p>

<p>"Well," said Viridor, "I hope you have not been
chased by any more mad cows, since I had the pleasure
of seeing you?"</p>

<p>"O no sir," replied the stranger, in a voice which
made even the most trivial words pleasant to the ear,
"I have not dared to walk in the park since. I'm so
frightened."</p>

<p>"They should remove the cows," said Viridor, "it is
too bad to risk their frightening or tossing every little
girl who likes to take a stroll in the sunshine."</p>

<p>"Poor things!" said the stranger, simply, "they do
enjoy the grass so! I should not like to turn them out.
O no! I can walk somewhere else, in the streets, or anywhere.
Though I don't like walking in the streets,
people are so rude."</p>

<p>"Have you often been insulted, then, in the street?"

<!-- page 131 -->

said Viridor, with a slight flush, and a tone of lively
interest.</p>

<p>"Not exactly insulted. But gentlemen speak to me,
very politely sometimes, but still it is hard that because
one is all alone, one should be treated like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Viridor, coming to the rescue of his fair
visitor, who seemed embarrassed for a phrase, "and
what do you say to these impertinent people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never say anything, I look at them very
severely&mdash;so&mdash;" and the stranger frowned in a way that
made Viridor smile.</p>

<p>"You laugh at me?" she said, returning his smile
with unconscious fascination.</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't think such a severe frown as that would
have much effect upon these rude men we were speaking of."</p>

<p>"But you only see the comedy, you know I can't
look as I do when I am really offended. Nobody can
act feeling, can they?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think not, myself. At least I do not think
any one could deceive me by the expression of his
features. Yet they say that hypocrites succeed to a
great extent in the world."</p>

<p>"Very likely. But they must be very stupid. It
must be so much trouble. I don't care what people
think. I do what I like, and I always like to have my
own way."</p>

<p>"Always? but that is rather selfish, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is, but I <i>do</i> like it; so it is no use pretending
I don't. Oh! what a pretty picture, what a
dear face&mdash;the lady's!"</p>

<p>And the stranger rose and went to the easel on which

<!-- page 132 -->

an unfinished sketch was standing, for Viridor was in
the habit of relaxing his mind from severer studies by
the cultivation of the arts.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it," said the poet, "for I
painted it, but it is not yet finished; indeed it is scarcely
begun, it is a mere daub, pray do not criticise it too
closely."</p>

<p>All this was no affectation of the painter's, but strictly
true. Nevertheless his visitor continued to regard the
sketch with evident delight. And here I will venture
on a word to my artist friends. Next to the poet and
philosopher, I rank the artist. I love beauty as another
form of truth, I find art to be subject to the same grand
philosophy as ethics or politics, and as much in want
of radical reform as either.</p>

<p>As in policy the imperfect carrying out of high and
noble principles is infinitely preferable to the best
working system of base and inequitable expediency,
so in art the attempt to pourtray the beautiful and
the sublime, however feeble, is still incomparably greater
than the most successful triumph of mere mechanical
imitation.</p>

<p>There is an absurd mania pervading the artist youth
of the day, in favour of very accurate copyism of individual
nature. In one sense they may be called a
model-school, for we recognise our friends the models
with painful facility. Like babies crying for the moon,
they seem to have grown jealous of the sun, and to
have conceived the idea of competing with the daguerreotype
on its own ground. This is a chimerical project,
both from physical and spiritual causes. Their details
may be correct, but their general effects are discordant

<!-- page 133 -->

and unnatural. Instead of making nature the basis, and
breathing into it the breath of life by art, they destroy
the freedom of their original designs by reducing
them to conformity with nature, that is, model nature&mdash;stiff,
constrained, artificial, and lifeless. Hence the
wooden character of many elaborate paintings, which
painfully remind one of the late Madame Tussaud's
wax-works. No insult is intended to the wax-works,
by the way, which sometimes nod and wink their eyes
so cunningly as to deceive the unpractised spectator.
But the wooden style of painters deceives nobody&mdash;but
themselves. They fancy they are artists, whilst the
philosopher knows them to be mechanics.</p>

<p>There is more genius, more real art, in many a woodcut
of Leech or Gavarni, or etching of Hablot Brown,
not to allude to the outlines of Rotsch or the grotesques
of Doyle and Grenville, than in dozens of paintings of
vast pretentions, which it would be invidious to particularise.
In one thing the most cultivated and least
cultivated tastes agree. And that is in preferring the
roughest sketch, with meaning in it clearly conveyed,
to the most finished piece of light-shade and colour-work
without it.</p>

<p>For my part, I like to watch the effect of paintings
or drawings upon the feelings of persons of delicate
minds, but ignorant of art and artists. <i>They</i> are not
caught by mere copyism. <i>They</i> know which represents
nature best, the mind or the model. <i>They</i> feel the
difference between a work of intellect and one of mere
machinery.</p>

The stranger admired Viridor's daub&mdash;there was <i>nature</i>
in it, <i>real</i> nature, spiritual nature. She subsequently

<!-- page 134 -->

regarded with indifference Parodummy's picture, which
sold for a thousand pounds, and represented a curious
collection of exquisitely constructed lay figures in great
variety of attitudes or contortion.</p>

<p>This is how Viridor became acquainted with the fair
stranger.</p>

<p>He was walking across the Regent's Park, near the
railings of the Zoological Gardens, which there offer a
gratuitous, but very remote view of the lions, when he
saw a young girl running, in the greatest alarm, before
a cow, which, with tail erect, was sadly belying the
gentleness of her sex. Viridor drove off the cow with
his stick, and returning to the fair fugitive, found her
in a state of alarm, palpitation, and breathlessness,
which did not admit of his acting otherwise than he did,
in offering his arm and endeavouring to reassure her by
every means in his power.</p>

<p>When they gained the long walk, and the frightened
girl began to recover from her terror, and to feel herself
in perfect safety, she was profuse in her gratitude for
Viridor's interference, exaggerating very naturally the
danger he had run in her defence.</p>

<p>Viridor, struck by her beauty, and sensibly affected
by the repeated pressure of her small hands, which,
though gloveless, were white and delicate as a princess's,
could not bear the thought of parting from her without
cultivating a further intimacy. As she stood by his
side in the golden sunset, which they regarded in silent
sympathy of admiration, he felt a long chained hope
and desire become wakeful in his breast.</p>

<p>Who should say that chance, or rather the happy
combination of harmonious spirits, whose will, conscious

<!-- page 135 -->

or unconscious, is the synthesis of Destiny, had not
thrown in his way thus unexpectedly the long-sought
jewel of his desire? What, if in the love of this fair
child of poverty and obscurity, he should discover the
noble heart and sweet consolation he had begun to muse
on as a dream?</p>

<p>His whole being was moved even to its foundation.
The ice melted, the stern spirit of endurance gave way,
and passion entered where stoicism had crouched in
desolation. The fire of manhood was lighted up, and
his heart demanded its satisfaction with a voice which
no cold reasoning could silence.</p>

<p>Viridor had no scruples, he had no prejudices. He
cared no more for disgracing his proud relatives by a
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i> than for enraging them by his ultra-republican
opinions. He worshipped the sacred fire of conscience,
the light of truth in thought, in feeling, and in
action. He was not one to sacrifice real happiness to
chimerical ambitions. The ordinary ideas which such
occasions suggest scarcely presented themselves to his
mind. He had but two apprehensions&mdash;</p>

<p>Had this lovely daughter of the people yet learned
that she possessed a heart? If not, was he the man to
teach her that knowledge?</p>

<p>Viridor was not vain. He was proud, even to occasional
arrogance, towards the petty intellects he had to cope
with in his war against folly and baseness; but he was
free from personal vanity. He had either been unsuccessful
with the sex, or unconscious of his successes. He
had associated altogether too much with men, and too
little with their gentler comrades. He was somewhat

<!-- page 136 -->

stern and unbending, little skilled in small talk, utterly
hostile to coquetry, flirtation, and dandyism. He fancied
himself destitute of personal attractions. He had no
confidence in his powers of pleasing women. He attributed
any slight triumph he had gained, rather to
pity or politeness, than to any honest appreciation of
his efforts. In a word, he had a dismal presentiment
that he was about the last man in the world a beautiful
girl of seventeen could fall in love with.</p>

<p>He was wrong. His fair companion had fallen in
love with him already, and with a love far more powerful
and lasting than his own dawning passion. She did
not know it, she did not reason upon it. But for the
first time in her life she clung to the arm of a man in
confidence and joy. She looked up into Viridor's face,
and his dark eyes seemed to shed rays of soothing happiness
upon her soul.</p>

<p>Before they separated, Viridor had, unknown to his
companion, read the inmost secrets of her thoughts. He
found in her feelings of exquisite refinement, and a
pure, loving, and just instinct of thought, combined with
an affectionate, impressive, and rather obstinate character.
What chiefly pleased him was the constant
reference she made to her "dear father," for whom she
seemed to entertain a species of admiration. Above all,
Viridor gained the conviction that love was to her a
mystery yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>When he asked her to visit him, she assented without
hesitation. If not ignorant of the so-called impropriety
of such a proceeding, she was indifferent to worldly
opinions. She came punctual to her engagement.

<!-- page 137 -->

Viridor made tea. He had bought a cake and some
other delicacies, which she partook of, with artless
satisfaction. She laughed heartily at the student's
clumsy contrivances, and the deficiencies of his <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.
She begged him to smoke, if he wished it, as her
father always had his pipe of an evening. He was now
out of town, and she was staying with her sister, who
was married to a newsman. They had a small shop
over the water. They would not mind her being out
for a few hours, and if they did, she did not care, for
she had a will of her own&mdash;not that she would annoy
her sister for the world. Her sister was the dearest
girl, and not at all like her. Quite the reverse&mdash;her
sister was dark, and very pretty, with large black eyes,
and her husband James&mdash;that was Mr. Mullens&mdash;was so
fond of her. They would think she had gone to see
Laura. Laura was her friend&mdash;the only friend she had
in London&mdash;such a nice girl&mdash;only one year older than
herself&mdash;But really she must be going, it was getting
late, it had struck nine long ago. And she rose to take
her departure.</p>

<p>Viridor rose also. He took again her little hand in
his own.</p>

<p>"Grace," he said (he had found out that her name
was Grace Morton at their first interview), "dear Grace,
I am many years older than you are, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" said Grace, smiling, and helping her
host, in his turn, out of an embarrassment; "but you
never saw anybody half so pretty as I am? Now do
say so, you may as well pay me a good compliment
whilst you are about it!&mdash;not that I believe anything

<!-- page 138 -->

men say, they are such deceivers, as the young lady said
in the play the other night."</p>

<p>Viridor stopped the mouth of his pretty banterer with
a kiss, as anybody would, I am sure, have done under
similar circumstances. As she retreated from his embrace,
her form, supple as a reed, rested for an instant almost
supported by his arm.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again?" said Viridor, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Never," said Grace, severely, "if you presume so
quickly on my pleasantry."</p>

<p>"Grace, dear Grace!" said Viridor, "forgive me for
my freedom!" and for the first time in his life the
proud Viridor bent his knee to a mortal. The noble
object of his early passion could not boast of such
homage as he yielded to the dignity of the lowly and
neglected child.</p>

<p>When he rose, the head of Grace rested upon his
shoulder without any effort on his part. They stood
thus for a few moments in the enjoyment of feelings it
is unnecessary to descant upon, when a sudden sharp
knocking at the door aroused them from their dawning
love-dream.</p>

<p>Viridor recollected an engagement which he had
hitherto forgotten.</p>

<p>"Farewell, dearest," he said hastily, with another kiss,
which this time escaped objection&mdash;"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow," whispered Grace, drawing her
little shawl about her.</p>

<p>"The same hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Grace, in a tone almost inaudible
from emotion.</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>Viridor opened the door. The Soul-Agent entered.
His great dark eyes at once took in the shrinking form
of the young girl, who hastened to slip away, whilst
Viridor thought of Faust, Margaret, and Mephistopheles,
and wished Ignatius at the devil his prototype's.</p>

<div class="center" id="cjb2ch03">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">VIRIDOR AND THE SOUL AGENT.</p>

</div>

<p>MOTIONING the dark speculator to a chair, Viridor followed
Grace Morton from the room, and once more
took leave of her upon the staircase. He returned
with the pressure of her small hand yet tingling upon
his own, but with an aspect and manner completely
changed in expression.</p>

<p>A minute ago he had been all tenderness, childlike
playfulness, and pure emotion. In a word, he had been
the Viridor of Grace.</p>

<p>He reappeared the severe and critical thinker, the
man of intuitive penetration and indomitable firmness
of resolve. The Soul Agent beheld again the mysterious
being he had encountered on his former visits, with the
same pale tranquil countenance, and mild inscrutable
eyes, before whose gaze his own was ever lowered. There
was no trace of confusion of consciousness on Viridor's
features. As the waves close over a pebble which
disturbs their glittering surface, so did the thoughts of
the poet close over the departed maiden.</p>

<p>Few men possessed greater self-command when necessary
than Bernard Viridor. He had studied in the
school of suffering. For seven years past, from the
date of his nineteenth birthday, and return to England
from a foreign university, his life had been passed in
battles&mdash;battles more terrible than Darian's, with foes

<!-- page 141 -->

more implacable than the Croats of Jellachich, or the
Cossacks of the Czar.</p>

<p>His father, a man of independent fortune, had destined
him for the bar, but a subtle pettifogger of the
worst class of attornies&mdash;worst, because covering their
rascalities with every external appearance of respectability&mdash;adroitly
lured on the older Viridor into throwing
away five hundred guineas, and his son into the bargain,
upon certain articles of indenture, by which Bernard
became for five years the articled clerk of the said
adroit pettifogger.</p>

<p>The young student, fresh from German club-rooms,
salons, and lectures on psychology, history, demonology,
and other dusky sciences, signed the deed with a dismal
presentiment of impending evils, and the obscurest
notions concerning the nature of the profession he was
entering into.</p>

<p>He soon became enlightened.</p>

<p>Having nothing to do in the office, which he was
supposed to attend daily between the hours of ten and
six, and the working clerks being frequently interrupted
in their conversation, gymnastics, operatic <i>sotto voce</i>
reminiscences, and other unbusiness-like and illegal
amusements, by their necessary labours, he was unable
to get through a very considerable amount of that
valuable work, Sir William Blackstone's "Commentaries
on the Laws of England."</p>

<p>One of the first things he lighted on in that Arabia
Petr&aelig;a of the law-student was an utter denunciation of
the practice of preparing for the bar by the routine of
an attorney's office.</p>

<p>Viridor bitterly regretted the false step taken in the

<!-- page 142 -->

dark by his father and himself. Meanwhile, he was
occupied in solving an insoluble problem. This was
no other than the union of the noble and joyous career
he had marked out for himself, and the dry and detested
vocation which had been chosen for him.</p>

<p>Had been chosen for him? No, that is incorrect. He
had had the choice between Law and Church&mdash;between
Mr. Lumber's office and an English university. An
English university! after three years spent in all the
freedom of German student life! It was like going back
to school. Viridor was full of ambition. The germs
of grand designs already slept on his soul. He would
enter the world at all hazards, he would do something
for himself. He would become independent.</p>

<p>Already he had learned that dependence, even upon
a father, is servitude. True generosity is the rarest of
all virtues. What is ordinarily called by the name is
a mere sham. Nine fathers out of ten expect, for every
hundred pounds of allowance given, their hundred
pounds' worth of free-will sacrificed as return. Viridor
soon felt this; and it preyed upon his mind, like a cancer
on the breast. He over-rated the value of the obligation,
instead of looking upon it as a mere act of duty, like
most young men of his age. Instead of taking casual
reproaches as to neglect of business or extravagance
at their real value, as expressions of anxiety for his
welfare on the one hand, or petulance of temper on the
other, he allowed them to lacerate and excite his
feelings, naturally susceptible, to a painful degree of
intensity. Hence, perpetual jars and disagreements,
attacks and recriminations. Hence the devotion of
Blackstone and Coke upon Littleton to the infernal

<!-- page 143 -->

gods, and the irremediable loss of Mr. Viridor senior's
five hundred guineas in the abyss of Lumber the pettifogger's
pocket!</p>

<p>The elder Viridor was a gentleman of the old school,
though little more than twice the age of his son. A
man may have amazingly old ideas at forty even,
especially if he inherits them with his plate from his
grandfather or great-grandfather before him. Old
Viridor, then, was a Tory, and, I believe, admired George
the Third, and held Pitt in reverence. He took in the
<i>John Bull</i> and "Blackwood's Magazine," reading the
<i>Morning Herald</i> with rigid punctuality. In his library
was much calf and morocco, and a complete edition
of the classics, both Greek and Latin authors. But
had you looked for a poem or romance later than the
time of Sir Walter Scott, you would probably have
been disappointed in your search. In conclusion,
Mr. Viridor was a tall, handsome, imposing-looking man,
courteous and affable in his manners, universally liked
by his acquaintance (except those he had cut or been
cut by owing to a certain fiery temper of his), and
particularly pleasing to ladies, for whom he had a most
chivalrous and honourable respect. Add to this, that he
had a taste for reading, and considerable knowledge
of art, evinced in a fine collection of pictures and
engravings, that he possessed all gentlemanly accomplishments,
and something under a thousand a year
from landed property, and the picture may be considered
tolerably accurately sketched.</p>

<p>He had been left a widower during the childhood of
his son, and had married a young lady of great personal

<!-- page 144 -->

but no pecuniary attractions, which I consider a point
in his favour.</p>

<p>In truth, Mr. Viridor was far from mercenary. His
vice was not so much gold as idol-worship. He worshipped
power, position, worldly and recognised respectability.
And he had a spice of the tyrant in his composition.
He liked to guide, to govern, and to plan. He
liked blind obedience to his commands. He liked the
very branches of his trees to grow the way he ordained.
He was the architect of his own house, which was built
as never house was built before or since. He had his
coats made according to his special system. He was
born to command, but could scarcely obey even the
clearest dictates of reason opposed to his own stern
volition.</p>

<p>He tried to mould his son after his own thought,
instead of allowing free development to the youthful
faculties. He was not content with a legitimate influence,
he would have governed Bernard absolutely, and
for this purpose resorted to means of undue severity.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Years of foreign travel and
study had emancipated young Viridor's mind. He
already lived for himself as an individual incarnation of
an individual spirit, with aims, ideas, and ambitions
peculiarly its own. He was totally unfit for passive
obedience to a father, or the constraint of a lawyer's
office. He rebelled against both, at first secretly, then
openly. Viridor the elder never for an instant imagined
that he was at all in fault. He allowed his son a
hundred and fifty pounds a year; there was an excellent
career open before him, with ample and certain expectations
in the distance&mdash;what more did he want?</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p>A little happiness, a little peace and quiet affection,
a relief from eternal lectures, or, still worse, silent but
severe looks of reproach for trivial and involuntary
faults, and last, not least, a little less acrimony on the
subject of occasional small pecuniary advances, rendered
necessary by Bernard's utter ignorance of the value of
money.</p>

<p>Viridor, indeed, was rarely extravagant, but he had a
horror of appearing mean. This is the real secret of
many a comparatively innocent spendthrift's wastefulness.
Hence he was always in debt, and always anxious
and careworn about things, the importance of which
he over-reckoned, but which he had neither the self-denial
nor resolution to avoid.</p>

<p>In addition to the above requirements Viridor desired
more than all to escape from the profession of the law
in every shape, for which he had gradually conceived an
implacable detestation. Not one particle of his soul
ever entered into his legal studies. Like Darian, he
saw nothing in English law, common and civil, but a
monstrous mass of evil forms mingled with good
principles, crying loudly for reform. He would be a
legislator&mdash;but never a lawyer.</p>

<p>A crisis arrived&mdash;a few hot words from the father
were taken literally by the son, whose passion for absolute
free agency could no longer be restrained. The
office of Lumber was deserted for ever, the allowance
withdrawn, and Bernard Viridor thrown upon his own
resources.</p>

<p>Had Viridor the younger possessed any worldly prudence,
he might easily have conciliated and managed
his father. Had Viridor the elder relied upon paternal

<!-- page 146 -->

affection, and not paternal authority, he would have
certainly succeeded to some extent in swaying his son.
But the latter did not consider his interest, and the
former was too obstinate and proud to take any trouble
to study the mysterious though candid disposition of
the embryo poet.</p>

<p>Thus, with mutual misunderstandings, they parted.
They did not meet again for years.</p>

<p>The ruling passion of Viridor was for literature.
With considerable versatility he had already produced
a variety of tales, poems, and translations. They had
been printed, and what was more, paid for by the proprietors
of sundry not very distinguished periodicals,
now mostly gone to that "ulterior bourne" which Mr.
Carlyle occasionally hints at, as the probable destination
of all earthly entities.</p>

<p>At the moment of his quarrel with his father, he had
fortunately made a most brilliant hit by a political
satire he had ventured on in a style and tone quite
novel and extravagant. It was reviewed in almost
every paper in the kingdom, praised and abused with
equal exaggeration, immensely read, and sold like
wildfire.</p>

<p>(By the way, I wish I knew a wildfire shop, that I
might make an investment in that article. Will any
dealer in that <i>comparatively</i> useful description of fire
do me the favour of enclosing his card?)</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the strength of his satire, and a
limited power of drawing upon his publisher in
advance of his next work, Viridor quitted the Arabia
Petr&aelig;a of law to pitch his tent in the Arabia Felix of
the <i>belles lettres</i>.</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>The change was mightily agreeable. It was the air
of liberty and life, from frowns, inuendos, and lectures.
Oh, if parents, rulers, and legislators, all who have
authority over an individual, a province, or a nation,
would but learn the downright inefficiency of severe
measures, in operating real reform, either in a child or
in a multitude! If they would but throw all brute-force
dogmatists and latter-day prophets over the
bridge&mdash;in spiritual signification&mdash;and strive to govern
by the only two principles that have real power absolute
over thinking spirits&mdash;REASON and LOVE! For I tell
these semi-thinkers, these incomplete entities (<i>&ecirc;tres imparfaits</i>,
as George Sand terms them), these weak
deriders of that transcendant optimism which is neither
more nor less than sublimated Christianity, and more
especially I tell this same latter-day fury,* much read
in German illuminism, with small understanding of its
revelations, that both they and he are objects of great
and serious commiseration to the earnest seekers of
light, and hopeful leaders of crusades without end,

<!-- page 148 -->

against Pain, Ignorance, and Falsehood, that trinity of
everlasting hatred.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*This man pretends to pity Lamartine! That poet and statesman
has his faults, like all men of genius. But when I remember the
days of February, 1848; the hero-orator at the Hotel-de-Ville; when
I compare the works of Lamartine and of Carlyle, the subtle refinements
and lofty elevation of the former's ideas, with the crude indigestions
of Kaut, Fichte, Goethe, Jean Paul, &amp;c, of the latter; when
I ask myself what Carlyle would have been in the place of Lamartine;
when I consider the respective places they will occupy in history;
when I see in the one the poet, hero, and historian of all times, and
in the other the paradox-monger, imitator, and word-gushing pamphleteer
of a passing day&mdash;I do not pity&mdash;I laugh. And this Carlyle
speaks contemptuously of George Sand. Silly Scot!</p>

<p>"Du gleichst dem Geist, deu Du begreifst,<br/>

Nicht mir&mdash;"</p>

<p>Would be no inapt reply from that glorious spirit, whose very <i>blunders</i>
are worth all the "slush element" of Carlyleism I ever waded through.</p>

</div>

<p>(Pen! pen! cease thy digressive mania, or this history
will remain a fragment to the end of time!)</p>

<p>The next two years of Viridor's life were years of
marvellous fortune. In the most unexpected way, by
literary successes of various kinds, including one anonymous
drama's triumph, he obtained and spent more than a
thousand pounds sterling. But he had to make great mental
efforts for his years, and what was worse, to endure an
amount of care and excitement disproportionate to the
untaught fibres of his sensitive organisation. His health
gave way. On coming of age, he found himself in
miserable health, pressed by debts, incapable of energetic
exertion, and deprived, by a sudden turn in a law-suit,
of property the sale whereof was to have produced his
future means of independent income. It was a period
of general reaction and pecuniary scarcity, produced
by the mad speculations of the preceding year. Literature
was, as it were, suddenly becalmed. Viridor's new
book was a comparative failure. He risked his last
hundred pounds in a publishing speculation, which failed,
owing to his illness, inexperience, and the neglect of his
subordinate agents. As if by magic, he found himself
without resources, with exhausted credit, neglected by
his relations, forgotten by his friends (at least, so he
imagined), and, by way of a climax, arrested for debt
and thrown into prison.</p>

<p>Strange to say, his mind, relieved from its tension
by this extreme plunge into misfortune, no longer preyed
upon the frame it had well nigh exhausted. He recovered
partially in health, and when he managed to

<!-- page 149 -->

arrange with his creditors, emerged, as one out of a
dream, from the dismal scene of his incarceration, to find
himself reconciled with his father, broken in spirit, and
obscure in position&mdash;a mere shadow of the once brilliant
Viridor&mdash;vegetating upon a miserable pittance, and so
utterly changed in character, that for some time a
lunatic asylum appeared his probable, if not certain
destination.</p>

<p>For nearly a year he lived in utter solitude, doing
literally <i>nothing</i> but walk about in a state of hopeless
melancholy, and gaze with childish interest at the shops
or passing carriages of the metropolis, or the fields and
trees of the suburban landscapes. Twice he attempted
suicide, and twice by a singular chance escaped alive
from the ordeal. Some inferior percussion caps in the
one case, and the unaccountable non-effect of a large
dose of opium in the other, were the causes of this
escape.</p>

<p>Then came a violent reaction. He arose suddenly
from his lethargy, applied himself to study and literary
labour with restless assiduity, and found, to his own
surprise, that his genius had developed itself in its torpor,
that he had learned not only to understand but to
sympathise with his fellows, that the boy had ripened
into the man, the neophyte into the high-priest, that the
dreams of his young vanity, which he had so bitterly
condemned, might after all become developed into
realities. He saw the nullity of his factitious reputation
and fleeting success. But the broad road was before
him. He no longer trusted to blind inspiration, but
he began to see his way to the real fountain of truth

<!-- page 150 -->

and grandeur. He resolved before all things to educate
his mind. He undertook the severe toil of <i>thought</i>.
By day and night he meditated on the great fundamental
principles of the sciences, the arts, and their
practical application to life. He recognised, at length,
that in all things the most sublime and noble system is
the truest and the best. He kept that grand idea
before his eyes, even in his lightest contributions to the
floating literature of the hour. He was respected, if
not applauded. And thus, during years of poverty
bordering on actual want, and petty sufferings without
limit, he arrived at the triumph of fully developing and
comprehending that living philosophy of the age which
even Darian was yet incapable of pursuing and elaborating
in all its details. And this wondrous systematic
intellect and lofty intuition it was that made him, at
the period of our narrative, a personage of such secret
but vast importance in the great movement of the
European world, at an age when many men are still
struggling through the noviciate of a profession, or
blushing at their youth amid the circles of the Idolators
and the Gold-Thugs.</p>

<p>This was the soul, rudely and imperfectly described,
which the subtle Ignatius had undertaken to bargain for.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that the philosopher who reckoned
his disciples amongst the natives of every civilised
country of the globe, was in small danger of being
won over by the propositions of his adversary.</p>

<p>Nor would the dark speculator, in all probability,
have attempted the negotiation, had he at all comprehended
Viridor's then position. But in the eyes of the

<!-- page 151 -->

agent, Viridor was simply the needy man of letters, the
gentleman of broken fortunes, and the young man of
five-and-twenty, who had his way to make in the world.</p>

<p>He did not know that Viridor had but to ask for
thousands to receive them without a question or a condition,
that myriads were prepared to rise in arms at his
word, that the destiny of millions of men were as surely
dependent on the impulse given by his spirit, as the
descent of the scale is dependent on the additional
pound thrown into the balance by the meter.</p>

<p>The spies of the Soul-Agent could penetrate the
cabinets of ministers, but not the changing council-chambers
of the supreme Illuminati. They could betray
the secrets of freemasons' lodges, but not the formless
mysteries of spiritual brotherhood; they could enter the
club of the conspirators who desired physical-force
revolutions, but not the united souls of philosophers who,
with the invisible lever of thought, moved all humanity
from its inmost centres of action.</p>

<p>It was the third interview of Ignatius the Plutocrat,
with Viridor the Democrat. He had made no progress
as yet towards subduing the scruples of the Fire-Worshipper,
nor could he be said to have lost ground himself,
since every inch backwards in his system was a foot in
advance towards the purer creed.</p>

<p>It was, after all, an unequal contest&mdash;the false glitter
of gold against the true light which it reflects, the
metal that can be consumed against the fire that consumes
it. Granted, that the latter operation requires
some chemical science not possessed by every dabbler
in experiments at the Polytechnic Institution.</p>

<p>"Pray do not stand on any ceremony," said the

<!-- page 152 -->

Soul-Agent, "if I am in the way, say the word, and
I will leave you while it is yet time to recall a more
agreeable visitor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Viridor, "I had no wish to
prolong the interview. Well, what news from the Soul-market?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular to-day, except a rise in the
value of out-door agitators and demagogues. One very
violent fellow was bought for five hundred pounds by
the Duke of Rackrent."</p>

<p>"What do they want with him&mdash;is he to be silenced,
or proclaim his apostacy through a speaking trumpet?"</p>

<p>"Neither&mdash;he is to go on more rabidly than ever."</p>

<p>"What, to excite a riot, and give excuse for strong
repressive measures?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. It is a dangerous plan, and a doubtful.
I told the duke so, but what can one do with these
blockheads? However, I am but a plain Soul-Agent.
I neither care for nor interpose in politics."</p>

<p>"Have you no opinions, then, on the subject?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but no passions."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you are indifferent to the well-being
of the people?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, I wish them all happiness. But I believe
that the man who does something practically useful is
the greatest benefactor of society. Now, I have founded
the Soul Exchange, and put men in the way of saving
more time, that is, money, than they can possibly do by
any other recent improvement in machinery. If they
would only do away with speeches in Parliament, and
vote point blank on every bill proposed, the effects of
the system would be wonderful."</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p>"Wonderful," exclaimed Viridor, "considering that
two bills out of three are blunders! We should be inundated
with laws which would eat one another up in
the execution!"</p>

<p>"You are quite right about the blunders. But let
me ask you one thing&mdash;is there any blunder possible that
could do more harm than procrastination?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. Because, after all," said Viridor,
meditatively, "a positive evil is more easily grappled
with than one arising from mere inactivity and uncertainty.
A bad law could be repealed, and would serve
as a test for the remedy required."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, it is easy to discover improvement when
there is something to improve. Look at the number of
amendment acts, The great vice of government is
laziness. Oh! if we had but a man like yourself at
the head of affairs we should soon see a new life breathed
into the old machinery!"</p>

<p>"Say, rather, that you would soon see the old machinery
replaced by new. You are aware that I care little for
traditions, glorious old constitutions, and other worn-out
lumber, inherited from our ancestors."</p>

<p>"I am aware that you care only for your country,"
said Ignatius, trying to look sincere, which was a great
effort on his part.</p>

<p>"Quite a mistake," said Viridor, "I do not care for
my country at all."</p>

<p>"No?" said the crafty agent, brightening up, and
hoping that, after all, the literary politician was not so
ridiculously virtuous as he pretended. "You do not care
for your country? Why should you?"</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>"Why indeed?" said Viridor, "I was born here, it is
true; but I have travelled. I speak English; but I
can also speak French, German, and Italian. Why
should I confine my desire to benefit mankind to a single
country of the many by which the earth is covered?"</p>

<p>"If you were but Foreign Secretary, such sentiments
would do you honour," said the Soul-Agent. "Now I
have no doubt but that you have formed a plan of European
policy already, in case of accidents," continued Ignatius,
with an almost imperceptible tinge of irony, provoked
by the absurd idea of Viridor entertaining such projects
in his present obscure position.</p>

<p>"I am ready to take office to-morrow," replied the
philosopher coolly.</p>

<p>"Have you devised a settlement of the Eastern
question?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Viridor.</p>

<p>"Should you become First Lord or Home Secretary,
I presume you are ready to propose a remedy for Irish
pauperism?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"And to pacify the discontented farmers?"</p>

<p>"That also."</p>

<p>"And the landlords?"</p>

<p>"I am prepared to redress even their grievances."</p>

<p>"And to preserve the colonies?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably."</p>

<p>"And to reduce the expenditure?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And yet keep up the national credit?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly."</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>"And satisfy the clamorous for an increased franchise?"</p>

<p>"Fully."</p>

<p>"In short, you are armed at all points?" said the
Soul-Agent, with a mixture of respect for the confident
audacity of the young author, and suspicion of his sincerity
in all he professed.</p>

<p>"I have studied and reflected upon most of the important
topics of the age, and as I believe rather in the
application of <i>&agrave; priori</i> principles than of partial experience,
I should not hesitate to undertake any responsibility,
so long as I could satisfy my conscience by
devoting my whole energies to the carrying out of the
ideas I have faith in."</p>

<p>"What! you reject experience&mdash;the source of all
wisdom, knowledge, and even principles?"</p>

<p>"I do not reject it, I profit by it to the utmost. And
the first thing experience teaches me is, to beware of
trusting to experience. A grain of judgment is worth
a pound of precedent. It has been said, that there is
nothing new under the sun. The fact is, there is
nothing old. Beyond the sphere of mathematical truths
there is no repetition in nature or life. No two generals
or statesmen were ever in precisely the same position.
Besides, even the fact that one course of action succeeded
on a previously similar occasion is no proof that
even <i>then</i> another course might not have succeeded
<i>better</i>. I am for obtaining all possible knowledge of the
circumstances in which I am placed, but I reserve to
myself perfect liberty of acting upon the information
obtained."</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>"What a pity it is that you are attached to no
party," said the Soul-Agent, "that talents of the high
order you possess should lie as it were idle, when they
might be turned to such profit for your fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said Viridor, who wished to encourage
the agent to speak out.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. I have before hinted to you that
there is more than one opportunity for you to enter the
political arena with every prospect of attaining the
highest position."</p>

<p>"In plain terms," said Viridor, "you have a bid for
my soul?"</p>

<p>"In still plainer terms," said Ignatius, encouraged
by the easy tone of the poet's remark, "I have three
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> offers for you, of the most brilliant nature."</p>

<p>"Can you mention to me the terms?"</p>

<p>"A seat in Parliament in every instance."</p>

<p>"That is little. I can exert more influence by a
scratch of my pen than I could by a dozen speeches
to men who had made up their minds not to be convinced
beforehand. What more?"</p>

<p>"In one instance, a place worth eight hundred a
year?"</p>

<p>"Very little&mdash;I could make as much by scribbling
nonsense, if I wished to sell my soul to public caprice."</p>

<p>"In the second case, an estate for qualification,
bought out and out, clear of encumbrance, by subscription."</p>

<p>"A pleasant prospect truly. I should encounter my
subscribers at every turn. They would point me out

<!-- page 157 -->

to their friends, and say, 'Look there, that is our speaking
machine; we got it up in fifty shares of so much per
man!' We may dismiss that."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds in hard cash, is the third
proposition, with a place into the bargain, if you desire
it, and social advantages not to be surpassed."</p>

<p>"Who pays the ten thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"A single individual. The transaction may be made
strictly confidential. Between you and me, it comes
from a man of very high station, and, I suspect, ultra-liberal
opinions."</p>

<p>"I know the man," said Viridor, who was well aware
of Darian's <i>ruse</i>, the object of which was solely to
increase his (Viridor's) importance and influence amongst
the soul-dealers.</p>

<p>"You know him?" said the Soul-Agent, who, though
he had easily ascertained the name and rank of his
first customer, was, owing to the incorruptibility of
Darian's attendants, unable to gain particulars of the
latter's personal associates.</p>

<p>"Well," said Viridor, "it is the Duke of St. George."</p>

<p>"And what do you say to his offer?"</p>

<p>"That it is a joke."</p>

<p>"A joke?" said the agent, reddening, "a joke?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more. Arthur Darian holds the opinion
that a soul which can be bought is not worth having."</p>

<p>"And so you are content to be this young duke's
aide-de-camp, free, gratis, and for nothing?" said the
Soul Agent, whose eyes were gradually opening.</p>

<p>"Not so; I serve no man, party, or nation&mdash;I seek
for truth."</p>

<p>"And you are content to renounce even the means of

<!-- page 158 -->

carrying out your principles. You reject the only road
to power. You resolve to continue in comparative
poverty, obscurity, and helplessness, when by accepting
either of the real offers I have to make you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I might become a slave to creatures I despise."</p>

<p>"You are, then, resolved?"</p>

<p>"There needs no resolution. I am true to my faith."</p>

<p>"Confound his faith!" thought Ignatius, "I shall
lose my best customers. I have engaged to find them
a soul to animate their unwieldy bodies of voting clods
and talking sticks, and I find nothing but an obstinate
fanatic. Let me see you to-morrow, and learn your final
decision," said the dark speculator aloud, rising to go, "I
entreat you not to throw away such opportunities for
mere fanciful illusions. The man who belongs to no
party is a cypher ignored by all."</p>

<p>"The man who devotes himself to any party, in the
sense you understand it, is something still worse."</p>

<p>"How so?" said the agent, dismally.</p>

<p>"He is a cypher to himself, as well as to everybody
else."</p>

<p>"I cannot see the force of what you say. Man is a
gregarious animal. You yourself are always speaking
of harmony as the grand principle of happiness and
progress."</p>

<p>"True," said Viridor, "but remember that there is
no harmony without difference in music, and that no
two notes, unless divided by a full tone, can possibly
harmonise, whilst every nearer approach, short of absolute
unisonance, produces the most appalling discord.
For my part, I am my own leader of the opposition,
my own pope, and my own master of transcendental

<!-- page 159 -->

eclecticism. I wish other people would think as freely.
Freedom of opinion, combined with toleration, is the
noblest mental condition I can imagine. The difference
between such independent spirits, and the servile supporters
of Jack This or Bob That's measures, is as great
as that between the straw in a bundle on the pavement
of a stable and the single valuable tube through which
a thirsty Yankee sucks his sherry cobbler in the dog-days!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Ignatius, with a forced hilarity,
"I see you are not in a vein for serious discussion," and
he took a hasty leave, anxious to escape without further
displaying his chagrin at the failure of one of his most
important negotiations.</p>

<p>"Wait till I buy your soul and publish your memoirs,
my poor Mephistopheles of the nineteenth century!"
muttered the poet with a smile, as he also took his hat,
and in a few minutes followed the Soul Agent down the
dusky staircase from his chambers.</p>

<p>Very opposite were their destinations.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE TIMESERVER.</p>

</div>

<p>IGNATIUS LOYOLA GREY quitted Viridor's chambers in a
far more pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>Since he had become a Soul Agent by profession he
had gained some curious experiences. The great fact&mdash;by
the bye, Ignatius was the originator of that much-abused
formula&mdash;the great fact of his experience was
the astounding ignorance which prevailed in the world
as to the relative value of the most valuable of all
commodities.</p>

<p>He was constantly buying and selling, for his clients,
souls, not worth their weight in electricity, at the most
ridiculous prices, and, on the other hand, disposing of
real diamonds of intellect for a few pieces of dross
which would not have purchased the favors of the most
facile Aspasia.</p>

<p>That very morning he had bought three Irish M.P.'s,
an Italian <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>, and a Cabinet Minister's
mistress, for a total of six thousand guineas, after considerable
chaffering; whilst a man of science in difficulties
had been easily bargained for at a solitary hundred.</p>

<p>As for Viridor, the longer he resisted all the Soul
Agent's temptations, the stronger grew that worthy's
passion to effect the purchase; indeed, he only awaited
the first sign of relenting on the part of his temptee to
make, himself, an offer which should throw all the others

<!-- page 161 -->

into the shade, and make Viridor's soul his prey before
anybody else had time to outbid him. Ignatius well
knew that he could then make his own terms with his
clients. Curiously enough, all three parties were anxious
to make Viridor's soul their property.</p>

<p>The Aristocrats wanted him because they required
men of talent to support their falling cause, and could
produce none themselves.</p>

<p>The Plutocrats wanted him, because they fancied
that his writings were of a dangerous character to
their gods, and threatened the pillage of their plunder-caverns.</p>

<p>And Darian, as we have seen, bid for him on the
Fire-Worshippers' behalf, by way of mystifying the
Soul Agent.</p>

<p>Meditating on these things from his special point of
view, Ignatius emerged from the temple without feeing
the porter who opened the useless wicket. He dismissed
the splendid carriage which awaited him, with
an impatient gesture, and the words "<i>Timeserver</i>
Office&mdash;two," and continued his way on foot, towards
the city. At Blackfriars-bridge he paused, and leaning
over the parapet, contemplated the water in profound
meditation.</p>

<p>"This country," murmured Ignatius, "is on the verge
of a great moral and physical convulsion. The men
in power are too feeble to bear up against the storm
which is coming. Before long there will be only two
political parties in the country, Republicans and
Limitarians. I must make friends with the stronger
party. But which is the stronger? The king of
to-day is the vagabond of to-morrow. The convict

<!-- page 162 -->

of yesterday may be the hero of its anniversary. What
folly to be always calculating the future! It is speculating
on female frailty in the arms of beauty&mdash;foreseeing
indigestion in the freshness of appetite. At the
worst, one can but die!"</p>

<p>The Soul Agent turned round gloomily, and for a
few minutes regarded the diorama of varied human
countenances which in spectral gloom flitted across the
bridge, coming, one by one, within the rays of the
nearest gas-lamp, and the vision of Ignatius.</p>

<p>They were a rare collection of wild caricatures, those
faces! What havoc had Nature made of her ideal
types of human beauty and dignity! What fatal
accidents, corroding and destroying influences, had
worked upon those masks since their first infant outline!
To gaze upon them was enough to rouse the
soul from apathy, to drive it to reform, or rebel against
a state of things whose history was written in such
fearful characters.</p>

<p>There was a thin mechanic, with his pinched and
sallow features, careworn brow, mouth painfully contracted,
and sharp anxious eyes vainly peering forward
into a future of unresting toil and privation. He caught
the Soul Agent's glance, and an expression of defiant
hatred darkened all his countenance. Chartist and
Socialist as he was, the well-dressed lounger, the idle
gentleman, was an abomination in his eyes. Hunger
breeds hatred, and the poor man soon imbibes the belief
that his poverty is the rich man's crime.</p>

<p>Then came a young girl whose countenance would
have been beautiful, but for a reckless and insolent
boldness that sat upon it, like a reptile on a marble

<!-- page 163 -->

goddess. There was an unnatural flush upon her cheeks,
the flush of wine&mdash;she was too young for paint&mdash;there
was a smile of forced voluptuousness about her full lips,
a vicious humidity about her large dark eyes. Her
shawl seemed to have slipped from her shoulders, and fell,
not ungracefully, in half studied, half careless folds,
displaying the round and swelling proportions of a figure
which many a queen might have envied. She paused, and
stared familiarly at the Soul Agent. There was a time
when that sharp, sarcastic visage would have repelled
and frozen her heart in an instant. But what cared she
now? she saw only the man, the black coat, white linen,
and kid gloves&mdash;in a word, the possible customer.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," said she, "are you the ghost of Hamlet's
father?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," replied the Soul Agent, a
little disconcerted by this sudden address.</p>

<p>"You look quite a 'grave man,' " continued the girl,
still quoting Shakespeare, that poet of the people, "I
hope you have not dropped your heart into the river."</p>

<p>"I never had a heart, my dear," said the Soul Agent,
in his most biting tone, "and I suspect you would have
been better without one yourself."</p>

<p>The girl passed on with a disdainful toss of her head,
and a twitch of her obstinate shawl, whilst two city
clerks presented themselves to the criticism of Ignatius.</p>

<p>How very pale, thin, threadbare, and cypher-like they
looked! Fourteen hours a day they made entries, and
added up columns of accounts in a dusky warehouse,
Their lives passed away like revolving water-wheels.
Some day they will die, and be replaced by other
machines like themselves.</p>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p>They were walking Number Ones, and added together,
they made&mdash;Two. If ever they caught a snatch of pleasure,
they were too tired to enjoy, or too bewildered with
the change to appreciate it.</p>

<p>Next followed a fat cheesemonger, with a round, unmeaning
face. He had passed so much of his life
amongst cheese and bacon, that he felt almost a cheese
or a pig himself.</p>

<p>Then passed a sweep, and an Irish bricklayer, with
a brick-dust complexion and a short black pipe, and an
old woman who resembled Sycorax, and three more
girls of easy virtue, who stopped to sing the Soul Agent
a verse of a strange song; and many other quaint masks,
with souls behind them, catching a feeble glimpse of
existence through the dim and distorted medium of their
perverse senses.</p>

<p>All these the Soul Agent carelessly scanned, till, hearing
a clock strike the half hour, he strolled leisurely
towards the office of the <i>Timeserver</i> newspaper.</p>

<p>In a dismal court, not far from the Thames, stands
the vast factory from which issues a stream of words
singularly resembling in character the river in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If beneath the turbid waters of the Thames there be
cats and dogs in a state of advanced decomposition,
beneath the flowing paragraphs of the <i>Timeserver</i> there
are ideas and suggestions no less foul and insalubrious.
If the Thames water, unfiltered, be poison to the
stomach, the tone of thought in the <i>Timeserver</i> is, to
minds that cannot sift it of its hackneyed fallacies, to
the full as dangerous. If the Thames, with all its hidden
filth, be still useful to the world, so is the <i>Timeserver</i>,

<!-- page 165 -->

with all its lies in masquerade. Both have their
uses and their abuses. Neither of them have a pure
drop in their veins. Both are daily recruited from
sewers of corruption. As there is more merchandize
embarked and disembarked in the Thames than in any
other river, so there is more news conveyed and misrepresented
by the <i>Timeserver</i> than by any other journal.
Of the two, it were difficult to say which we
swallow with the greatest repugnance, Thames water,
or <i>Timeserver</i> articles.</p>

<p>The Soul-Agent arrived at the door of this literary
Pandemonium. He was a great man there; though
few, even of those employed in the establishment, were
aware of the fact. Scarcely noticing the few persons
he encountered, and who saluted him with suspicious
awe, he made his way along a passage, and up two
flights of stairs, to a mysterious-looking door of red
cloth. On ringing a bell at the side, this door flew
open, as did also a second door covered with iron plates,
which faced him as he entered. Having passed the
second portal, Ignatius found himself in a small snug
chamber, with a large office table in the centre, and a
fire burning in the grate, which, in fact, consisted of
several letters undergoing annihilation at the hands of
a gentleman whose back only was visible.</p>

<p>There was but one other person in the room.</p>

<p>He was an elderly man, with a very bloated face, a
slightly humped back, and disproportionately short legs.
His nose was large and red, his eyes small, and half
buried in his fat cheeks. Eyebrows or lashes he did
not, to appearance, possess. His dress was clerical in cut,
with the exception of a heavy gold chain round his neck.</p>

<!-- page 166 -->

<p>At the noise of the Soul-Agent's entry, the person
occupied in burning the papers looked round, and
nodded in a familiar, though uneasy manner. He was
a large-featured, coarse-looking man, something like the
barristers one sees in courts of law, bullying witnesses.
His head was nearly bald. His dress was that of a
cockney sportsman. There was profound cunning in
his sharp greenish eyes, and a sinister expression about
his large jaw, which could not fail to strike even a
superficial observer.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Grey," said the sportsman, "you are
just in time to give your opinion. The Austrian remittance
falls short this week."</p>

<p>"It is the third time since the close of the war," said
the humpback, in a mild croaking tone.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do?" said Ignatius.</p>

<p>"Do? Confound the rascals, give it them in a thundering
leader, teach them to pay their debts of honour,
d&mdash;n them!" replied the green-eyed gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, spare the rod and spoil the child," said the
hunchback, "but the times are changed."</p>

<p>"So shall the <i>Timeserver</i> be, by jingo!" growled the
sportsman sullenly.</p>

<p>"I mean," insinuated the small gentleman, "that we
have not so strong a hold on them as we had. They can
do without us."</p>

<p>"Yes, for the moment," said Ignatius, "but if there
should be a new outbreak?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, the rascals do not see an inch before their
noses," rejoined the sportsman, "they trust to their
infernal bayonets too much, like everybody else just
now."</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>"I will see the ambassador this very night," said the
Soul-Agent sternly, suddenly assuming a tone of leadership,
which his companions rarely resisted; "we must
remember that though, as a <i>quorum</i>, we represent the
committee of shareholders, we have to account for our
acts. Besides, Twiggins, you are really too hasty altogether;
you made us give ourselves the lie last week
point blank, about the Roman business. Even the
<i>Timeserver</i> is not unassailable, and the cursed <i>Daily
Nous</i> watches us like a cat after a bird. They are a
little timid in Bobbery Street, but they will take their
opportunity, depend upon it, if we indulge in any glaring
inconsistency just now."</p>

<p>"I thought we had thrown consistency overboard
long ago," croaked the dwarf, with a mock humility
which Ignatius fully understood.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the latter, "as a principle, but not as
a blind. It is all very well for a French <i>mouchard</i> to
deny himself the luxury of a shirt, but he cannot dispense
with a dickey."</p>

<p>"Comparisons are odious," said the cockney sportsman.
"However, let Grey see their poor devil of an
Ambassador, and we will hang fire till we get his
answer, eh?" And the speaker, having delivered this
sentiment with great assumption of importance, looked
towards the dwarf for his approval.</p>

<p>"Just so," said the humpback, whose eyes were
riveted upon a piece of paper, on which Ignatius was
scribbling a few words.</p>

<p>"Will that do, Mr. Somers?" said the Soul Agent,
passing the slip of paper carelessly to the dwarf.
Its contents ran thus&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>"Tread on dangerous ground, but very gently, in the
Austrian article."</p>

<p>The dwarf, whom we have heard called Mr. Somers,
appeared to read these few words with acute attention
several times. Once or twice he raised his pen, as if to
alter, but refrained on detecting the eye of Ignatius
fixed upon him with a peculiarly indifferent expression,
that he had learned to interpret differently. He therefore
contented himself with underlining the word <i>very</i>,
and handed the paper to Twiggins.</p>

<p>"All right," said the sportsman, thrusting the piece
of paper into an envelope, and dropping it through a
letter-slip in the floor. "I hope, for the editor's sake,
he has not written his article beforehand."</p>

<p>"Not he," said Ignatius, "that sort of men have but
one spur&mdash;necessity. Not even wine can stimulate the
brain of an old hack scribbler of all work. By the bye,
has the Pope written to explain the deficiency?"</p>

<p>"O yes, there was a letter from the Cardinal Raggolini
yesterday," replied the dwarf; "the Rotmucks are
holding back with their loan, like Jews as they are."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," interrupted Twiggins, "I have
obtained a piece of information which explains the whole
business. Baron de Rotmuck shewed a great deal of
pluck in the matter. He asked the Pope to remove all
objectionable laws respecting his countrymen. The Pope
and the Cardinals refused. Rotmuck obtained a private
interview with Pio. 'I'll tell you what,' said the baron,
'your Holiness may be Pope of Rome to-day, but I am
master of Europe to-day, to-morrow, and the day after.
I am the greater man of the two. But I have my fancies.
I know you and your long-robed knaves to be capable of

<!-- page 169 -->

cheating a Jew, or even a Greek, and that is saying a
great deal. No matter; have the extreme condescension
to kiss my great toe, and the loan shall be taken up at all
hazards to-morrow!' To this the Pope replied, that he
would pray him out of purgatory (and into a worse place)
first. 'Then,' said Rotmuck, coolly, 'if your Holiness
require money, I shall raise my demands, that is all; so
you may guess my terms, you who are fond of having
your toe kissed by the people.' "</p>

<p>"Who told you that story?" said Ignatius, laughing at
the off-hand style of Twiggins's anecdote.</p>

<p>"Why, if you <i>will</i> know, I had it at dinner yesterday,
from Ben Sidonia himself."</p>

<p>"His romances are good," said the Soul Agent, "and so
would be his speeches, if any man could make head
against facts as plain as the sun at noonday. But Hebrew
heroism is a scarce commodity, I fancy."</p>

<p>"We shall be no losers by supporting the Pope," said
the hunchback.</p>

<p>"No," said Ignatius, "the standing orders will do for
<i>him</i>. To turn to a more important matter&mdash;the ministry
is shaky."</p>

<p>"Very," said the dwarf.</p>

<p>"The odds are two to one against its escape on the
A.B.C. question," said the sportsman.</p>

<p>"These poor Whigs," said Ignatius thoughtfully,
"they are so fond of office, they want the salaries so
much. They are so liberal with every thing but
money."</p>

<p>"They have no bottom," said the sportsman; "though
they have an uncommon talent for finding the gap in a
fence if there is one."</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>"And if they go out, how long can the landlord
party keep their ground? Can they take office at
all?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pro tem</i>." quoth the hunchback, significantly.</p>

<p>"Till a grand battue comes off," said Twiggins,
"with Free-trade reformers as sportsmen!"</p>

<p>"After that, the deluge," said Ignatius.</p>

<p>"What deluge?" said the short committee-man,
querulously.</p>

<p>"The deluge that will drown us with them, if we do
not get an ark of safety built in time," replied the Soul
Agent, with marked emphasis.</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you mean?" said Twiggins, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"I mean mischief&mdash;and from the democrats."</p>

<p>"The democrats? pshaw! we settled them on Kennington
Common."</p>

<p>"You frightened a mob."</p>

<p>"The Charter is a humbug."</p>

<p>"I trust it may prove so. Do you know what its
first point means?"</p>

<p>"What, Universal Suffrage? why, a vote for every
man in the country above twenty-one years of age."</p>

<p>"And that means&mdash;REPUBLIC."</p>

<p>"O, hang the Chartists! I am not afraid of them or
their oracles," said Twiggins, laughing; "besides, we
have made the middle classes believe that they are
robbers and pickpockets."</p>

<p>"You will find the real leaders of the movement
party something different from the Chartists you talk
of," said Ignatius; "I tell you they are <i>Republicans</i>&mdash;men
of the Cromwell, Mirabeau, Mazzini, Lamartine,

<!-- page 171 -->

Kossuth order. They have both policy and courage; I
know something of their method."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the dwarf; "a few ragamuffins
to break windows at half-a-crown a head, and we can
command special constables enough to beat the grand
army of Xerxes, in numbers."</p>

<p>"And in courage?" sneered Ignatius. "But you
are mistaken; the middle classes are suffering too bitterly
from restricted currency, over-taxation, and colonial
bungling. They are beginning to see their own
interest, and it pulls with the people. So must we, if
we mean to live out the tempest. As for the ministry&mdash;make
hay while the sun shines. And now a word on
France."</p>

<p>"On chaos you mean," croaked the dwarf.</p>

<p>"Regular wild-duck shooting!" muttered the sporting
shareholder.</p>

<p>"The Mountain will triumph."</p>

<p>"When?" squeaked the dwarf.</p>

<p>"Ay, when, indeed?" exclaimed the sportsman.</p>

<p>"To-day, to-morrow, the day after. I cannot tell.
It gains ground daily, as it has gained ground since '83,
We must moderate our tone. If my advice were followed,
we should abandon the poor ape of the Elys&eacute;e at
once. Louis Napoleon is an impotent phantom, a mere
<i>nominis umbra</i>. In a word, I consider that every commercial
interest of the <i>Timeserver</i> depends upon our
taking a bold course. Our subsidies are failing us from
those we have supported, our name stinks in the nostrils
of the public, we are burned in effigy daily. In my
opinion, we must either take the lead in liberalism, or
perish."</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"Humph!" said the dwarf, with that air of stolid
scepticism which seems to defy conviction, "I think we
had better look before we leap. As far as an extra lift
to the Manchester school goes, I should not object."</p>

<p>"No," said Ignatius, "especially when they come
forward to annihilate our property, by throwing open
the news market to every publishing adventurer. What
are we to expect, if penny morning papers become the
order of the day? When an advertisement we charge
a crown for is to be had for a shilling? when, with no
stamp, no advertisement, no paper duty, we are compelled
to exert all the resources of our capital, machinery,
and organisation, to compete with rivals that undersell
us, even on the certainty of loss? What are we to do,
I say, when it becomes necessary to reduce our price
three-fifths, and quadruple our sale, if we do not manage
to enlist friends amongst the masses of the people? when
the sudden rise of new journals, advocating new principles,
and conducted on new systems, threaten to eclipse
even the <i>prestige</i> of our name? when our enormous
dividends not only are threatened with diminution, but
with utter extinction? What are we to do then?"</p>

<p>"Shut up shop, I suppose," replied the sportsman,
with a grim laugh. "But you are giving way to strange
fancies, you have taken an extra glass of claret&mdash;you
surely do not mean seriously half you say?"</p>

<p>"I mean all, and more than I have thus vaguely
hinted at. I mean that we live in an age, when days
count for years of more torpid history."</p>

<p>"I see nothing of the fiery element you seem to
dread so much," said the hunchback, "everything
seems quiet. The people are put down, abroad and at

<!-- page 173 -->

home. The continental press is gagged, the bayonet is
king everywhere&mdash;even in France."</p>

<p>"Trust me," said Ignatius, solemnly, "we are smoking
cigars on barrels of gunpowder (once more to quote my
friend Contarini). Up to the moment of explosion, we
are safe enough; after that&mdash;advertise for our arms and
legs in any papers you please."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose?" said the dwarf, in the
querulous tone of incapacity, combined with repugnance
to the acknowledgment of superior resources.</p>

<p>"Aye, what?" said Twiggins, carelessly, as if he
would have disguised the involuntary respect he felt for
all the propositions of Ignatius.</p>

<p>"To strike in to-morrow on some great topic, with
twice the boldness, twice the liberality, and twice the
brilliancy of a leader in the <i>National</i> or <i>La Presse</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, as you like," said the sportsman, "<i>vive la
bagatelle</i>. Life is a toss up&mdash;the best shot misses his
bird sometimes."</p>

<p>"I wash my hands of the responsibility," said the
dwarf, shrugging his shoulders&mdash;a very necessary
operation, by the way, in his case.</p>

<p>"<i>A la</i> Pontius Pilate," muttered the sportsman in his
beard.</p>

<p>"I undertake all the responsibility," said Ignatius,
coldly, restraining the curl of contempt which played
about his mouth corners.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, you will write the instructions for
the editor," said Somers.</p>

<p>"No," said Ignatius, "we must have new blood in
the affair. We must have a little of the real stuff about
it, or the articles will look too much like mountebanks

<!-- page 174 -->

in mufti. You may dress any man in Bond Street, even
a crossing-sweeper, but you can't teach him to walk and
look like a gentleman. The old style won't do; and
the new ideas will bother our old stage thunderers. I
have my eye upon a man who will serve our turn, if we
can enlist him for the moment."</p>

<p>"Is his soul in the market?" yawned Twiggins, who
was growing sleepy.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Perhaps we may borrow it for a week or
two."</p>

<p>"At what rate of interest?" said the dwarf.</p>

<p>"At none at all&mdash;but a few words in the proper tone,
and a lie which nobody can tell but myself."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the two committee-men,
"and who is this gullible Ph&oelig;nix of democrats?"</p>

<p>"Bernard Viridor."</p>

<p>"Bernard Viridor! <i>He</i> write in the <i>Timeserver!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Soul Agent, "and now, gentlemen,
good evening. I must defer seeing the Austrian ambassador
until to-morrow, unless I meet him at Lord
Rattlesnake's <i>soir&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the Soul Agent had profited
by the lessons of Viridor. Strange infatuation!
Ignatius yet dreamed of bending to his will the spirit
which already began to regulate the pulsations of his
own strange destiny.</p>

<p>As the three Parc&aelig; of the <i>Timeserver</i> were about
to quit the apartment, there came a sudden ringing
at the bell, which betokened urgency or importance
on the part of the ringer.</p>

<p>Ignatius pulled a string, and the doors flew open, one
after the other.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>A courier rushed into the room, flung down a packet
upon the table, and leaned exhausted against the door.</p>

<p>Ignatius tore open the packet, and glanced rapidly at
its contents.</p>

<p>"It is the Austrian remittance," he whispered, and
scribbled on a fresh slip of paper, almost at one stroke
of his pen, the words&mdash;"<i>Butter for Austria, orders
revoked.</i>"</p>

<p>The two committee-men nodded assent, and the
decree was committed to the letter-box, like the accusations,
of old, to the mouths of the Venetian lions.</p>

<p>"They will take care of you below," said the sportsman
to the courier, who bowed low, and staggered from
the apartment.</p>

<p>"Dead beat," said Twiggins.</p>

<p>"Dead drunk," corrected Ignatius.</p>

<p>"We can divide the notes to-morrow," said the dwarf,
with a hideous leer, turning his key in the lock of the
outer door.</p>

<p>There were two other locks on the door. Ignatius and
the sportsman each followed in turn the example of their
companion, and left the chamber of mystery, like the gold
of the robbers,* accessible "not to one, nor to two, but to
three."</p>

<p class="small">[*The story alluded to will be found in Rogers's "Italy."]</p>

<p>Such are the precautions which rogues are obliged to
take one against the other, in the great City of Jugglers.</p>

<p>There is no honesty amongst thieves&mdash;it is quite an
exploded fallacy.</p>

<p>The three jugglers descended to the street, Ignatius
last of all.</p>

<p>The dark speculator leaped into his carriage.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>"Can you drop me at my club?" said the sportsman.</p>

<p>"Certainly. You will not come with us, Somers?"</p>

<p>"No," said the dwarf, hobbling away, "I have an
appointment to keep."</p>

<p>"With his mistress, I suppose," said Twiggins,
sarcastically,</p>

<p>"I should like to see the Juliet to such a Romeo," said
Ignatius. "But I know all about it; it is the agent of
Lord John Twaddle he has to meet."</p>

<p>"The devil it is! He takes bribes, then, on his own
account? that is against our compact," said the sportsman,
moving his huge frame uneasily in his place.</p>

<p>"His soul is Twaddle's though; what can we do?"
resumed Twiggins.</p>

<p>"Buy Twaddle himself, if you like&mdash;I will go halves in
the speculation."</p>

<p>"We must buy him d&mdash;&mdash;d cheap then," said the
sportsman, "for his whole party may be at a discount
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So may we ourselves," said Ignatius, "if we let either
Somers or Twaddle cast their shadows over our columns.
I have a great mind to sell my shares in the <i>Timeserver</i>,
and start a rival."</p>

<p>"It has been tried too often," rejoined Twiggins,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"A man in battle may escape a great many bullets, and
yet be shot at last," muttered the Soul Agent.</p>

<p>With which pithy sentence, we will conclude this
lengthy chapter.</p>

<div class="center" id="cjb2ch05">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">MODERN ILLUMINATI.</p>

</div>

<p>DAY is the season for action; night is the season for
thought.</p>

<p>In the day-time, the glare of sunshine and the turmoil
of business distract the mind, and force attention
to immediate objects. In the hours of night, forms
become vague, details melt into obscurity, and the spirit
is enabled to concentrate its power upon the essences of
things&mdash;upon the supreme abstractions which embrace
all minor distinctions.</p>

<p>Viridor gazed upon the stars, the calm and beautiful
companions of his long vigils. He strove to collect, as
in a focus of light, the rays which had by turns illuminated
his studies. That night he desired to be all
he had ever felt himself in his most exalted moments.
A sudden dread came over him. A black phantom
stalked at his side. Cold sweat burst from his pores,
the pulsations of his heart seemed to cease, and the
giant Despair for an instant threatened to paralyse his
whole spiritual being.</p>

<p>He had dreamed a dream which that night was to
realise or destroy. He had claimed an empire which
that night was to see acknowledged or denied for ever.
He had preached a religion&mdash;that night was to hail him
prophet, or brand him as fanatic.</p>

<p>A new and extraneous influence had disturbed the

<!-- page 178 -->

balance of his soul. The fire of human had dimmed the
flame of spiritual love. His ambition had lost its unity;
selfish desire had mingled with the passion of the universe.
He remembered the moral of the weird romance.
Glyndon and Zanoni danced before his thoughts till they
vanished, or merged in the pale spectre of their creator,
who, like the phantoms of his art, had also fallen&mdash;fallen
from the Empyrean of the Gods, into the chaos of the
earth-lusts, and the shadows of the threshold.</p>

<p>"O, Bulwer, Bulwer! what fatal timidity could check
thy bold career? what nameless doubt could cause thy
faith to waver? What secret chain debarred thy soul
from liberty? So much&mdash;and yet no more. So near&mdash;and
yet to pause. The ears of the world&mdash;and yet
silent. Speak, speak!&mdash;or for ever slumber. And I&mdash;I
feel the salvation of a world streaming through my
veins, and Doubt freezes the torrent. My spirit sees;
but clouds obscure my vision. My conscience dictates,
but my brain abjures obedience. My science teaches,
but my tongue refuses utterance."</p>

<p>Thus musing in feverish depression Viridor strode
along. He prayed inwardly to all the spirits of the
Infinite for strength in the great crisis of his destiny.
He strove to exalt his intelligence by contemplating the
present condition and possible future of his human
brethren. The Asmodeus, Imagination, removed for him,
not only the roofs, but the very walls and doors of every
house he passed,&mdash;or rather rendered them transparent
as those palaces of crystal described in necromantic
legends. He saw the juggler-citizens, each in the narrow
circle of his own petty lights, intrenching and fortifying
himself against the dishonesty of his fellows, whose

<!-- page 179 -->

delusion he contrived. He saw the thousand evils of a
system of society founded upon man's pettiest instincts.
He saw the endless chain of common cares and
miseries that bound men to one another, without uniting
them in spirit; that made, of every one, an old man of
the sea to some neighbour-Sinbad. He saw the greatness
of existing ignorance, and the smallness of existing
rulers. He saw the people crying for labour, for education,
for food, bodily and mental; and the arbiters of
their destinies playing comedies at Westminster, sacrificing
truth to party interest, conviction to personal
vanity, and the people to everything. All this he saw&mdash;and
more than this; he saw himself, and others like him,
men of thought and action, of power to conceive and
realise the desires that burned within the age, excluded
by a brute-force tyranny, an idle subterfuge, a legalised
conspiracy of orthodox social banditti, from all part and
share in the direction of the community to which he
belonged; that is to say, he found himself a shareholder
in a company, without a voice as to the distribution of
his own property&mdash;an existing fact, whose existence
could not be denied, and yet was not admitted.</p>

<p>The blood of Viridor boiled in its veins. He felt a
rebel in his heart against the dogged crew of dunces and
conspirators who stood between him and his heritage.
His own wrongs alone justified, the wrongs of millions
necessitated, his resolve. It was no common oath that
Viridor registered, as from the depths of his soul he
murmured these ominous words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Justice for the people&mdash;at all hazards, at every
cost. Better were the anarchy of light, than the sombre
despotism of darkness. Away with all temporising, with

<!-- page 180 -->

all half measures. If there be a Truth, let us declare it.
If there be a Right, let us combat for it. If our cause
be just, why should we hesitate to set fame, fortune,
and life on the cast? Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
have done so. They sleep in death, or starve in exile,
beneath the envenomed calumnies of their enemies. The
slaves of privilege and of money, the haters of enlightenment
and liberty, the advocates of bayonets and
bloodshed, of police-spies and passports, have thrown
down the gauntlet, and defied us. They have said, 'We
are strong, and might is right.' Let us prove to them
that we are the stronger&mdash;and that justice is mercy."</p>

<p>Thus did Viridor revolve in his breast a war terrible
and decisive against the whole oligarchy of Europe. Ever
faithful to his grand philosophical dogma that ideas are
the origin of all things, he forged the weapons of his
party in the Etna of his soul. The Vulcan of the terrestrial
gods, he prepared the thunderbolts of truth by
which whole armies of giants are stricken down and consumed
to ashes. He said, "There is no treason but
falsehood, and every honest man is its avenger!"</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, he entered an hotel near
Charing Cross, and straightway directed his steps to a
large room on the first floor of the building, in which
some twenty of his brethren were assembled.</p>

<p>All paused in their conversation at the entrance of
Viridor. Those who had already seen the poet, crowded
around him, eagerly grasping his hand. Those to
whom he was personally a stranger, did not require to
be told his name. His portrait was in all their
hearts.</p>

<p>As soon as the first greetings were over, Viridor, as

<!-- page 181 -->

Grand Master of the Supreme Illuminati, was requested
to preside.</p>

<p>He accordingly seated himself at the head of a table,
amply provided with writing materials, and covered
with a crimson cloth, in the centre of which, a figure
of liberty, with various emblematical devices, was
worked in golden embroidery. The other Illuminati
took their seats round the table. Their physiognomies
would have deeply interested a Lavater. Never since
the birth of history had been assembled twenty such
faces as were there present. Differing from one another
in the most marked manner, in age, in nationality, in
individual character, there was, in all, a varied expression
of intelligence, earnestness, and enthusiasm, unknown
to the vulgar herd. There was not, amongst
them, a single example of the coarse, animal, malignant
countenances to be met with in every public assembly,
even in the Houses of Lords and Commons, where any
one who will take the trouble to observe, may see
creatures on two legs, which it seems almost farcical to
set down as men.</p>

<p>About one half of the assembled council were
Englishmen. Amongst the remaining portion were
representatives of the German, Polish, French, Hungarian,
and Italian nations. Every minute increased
the numbers of the assembly.</p>

<p>At length Viridor rose to open the proceedings.
Before beginning to speak, he cast one more anxious
glance towards the door. At that instant it opened, and
the majestic figure of Darian appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Viridor, a sudden radiance overspreading
his countenance, "I have the most sincere delight

<!-- page 182 -->

in presenting to you a new member of our sacred
and eternal order, in the person of Arthur Bolingbroke
Darian, commonly known as the Duke of St. George,
a true democrat and citizen of the light; late general
of the patriots in the Hungarian Republic."</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed upon Darian, as his friend uttered
these words in that clear, ringing tone so eminently
adapted to command the attention of an assembly.</p>

<p>The impression produced by the new comer was decidedly
favourable. Few eyes could regard without
admiration, the face and figure of the republican chief.
There was something irresistibly prepossessing in the
look of his eye, which was not always the case with
Viridor, who at times unconsciously adopted a sternness
of demeanour, which the ignorant might have mistaken
for <i>hauteur</i>.</p>

<p>Darian seated himself on the first vacant chair he
could find, between a dark and bearded Roman and a
white-haired German philosopher. The silence, which had
been momentarily interrupted, was restored, and Viridor
again prepared to speak. He looked, perhaps, somewhat
paler than usual, and a slight dampness caused his long
silky hair to cling to his temples. Not a single line, not
even the almost habitual contraction of his brows,
disturbed the marble serenity of his broad smooth forehead.
His deep, inscrutable eyes flashed with a singular
brilliance. Tears glittered on their long dark lashes&mdash;tears
forced from the heart by intensity of sympathetic
exaltation. He stood, poised firmly, like a statue of
Destiny, drawn up to his full height, his arms folded on
his chest, his head slightly bent, in order to behold the
faces of his auditors. With a rapid glance, he scanned the

<!-- page 183 -->

visages of all who were present. In every case, he read
courage and resolution, confidence and hope. With a
voice that startled his hearers by its concentrated feeling
and thrilling distinctness, he began his address:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lovers of light, and brothers in the war of liberty!
We have met to-day, for no idle purposes of oratorical display&mdash;for
no contemptible gratification of vanity in verbal
contentions. We are all animated by one great desire&mdash;to
fulfill to the utmost our destinies as men; to limit
our ambition, not by our necessities, but by our powers;
to act upon earth in accordance with our glorious nature
as eternally progressive beings. The same sympathetic
love for all living spirits animates our hearts. The same
unquenchable antipathy to all voluntary infliction of
pain&mdash;that is, tyranny&mdash;in whatever shape, fires our
intelligence. Whatever our individual creeds or systems,
we agree at least in the one great moral necessity of
union to happiness. We see no hope for men without
union of thought, union of sentiment, and union of action.
My friends, do I speak your thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Well spoken!" exclaimed all the Illuminati, as if
with the voice of one man.</p>

<p>Viridor resumed, in accents yet more deep and penetrating&mdash;</p>

<p>"To effect great objects, great means are required.
We behold gigantic evils, and history teaches us their
wondrous ancientness. We are told by the cowardly,
and the weak, and the selfish, that they are incurable&mdash;that
they are necessary. The apathetic tell us not to
hurry, to await the natural course of events, to trust to
time and patience.</p>

<p>"But what <i>is</i> the natural course of events? Every

<!-- page 184 -->

step taken by man towards a better and a nobler life!
What cognate law fixes a limit to the extent or the
rapidity of progress? None. Let us, then, dare to
measure our possibility of success; not by the dull cant
of those rushlight spirits, who boast themselves pre-eminently
practical, because the circle illumined by their
rays is but a few feet in diameter; but by the broad inductions
of our own reason from history, science, and
reflection.</p>

<p>"To make men united and happy&mdash;I speak only of
approximate union and happiness, for all ideal states of
perfection are unattainable as absolutes&mdash;to make men
united and happy, two things are mainly requisite:
Love&mdash;mutual sympathy, benevolence, and abnegation
of selfishness in its worst sense; and Knowledge&mdash;that is,
the power of rendering nature subservient to our wants.</p>

<p>"Love, Christian love (there are no Christians <i>yet</i>),
destroys poverty by its practice of regarding sins of
omission and commission with equal severity. Thus, if
the Marquis of X.Y.Z. allow certain of his fellow-men to
starve to death, he having ample means to relieve them,
<i>he</i>, as a pretender to Christianity, or even humanity,
must conscientiously regard himself as a <i>murderer</i>. He
is indeed a far baser murderer than the highwayman,
who violently robs upon the road; for the latter may
have the pretext of desperation and want; but the former
commits <i>his</i> murder in cold blood, without risk, and from
a far meaner motive. This appears a little harsh at first
sight; but on minute inspection, it will be found that the
conclusion is irresistible. Begin by supposing the case
of a drowning man, whom you could save by extending
your hand, but do not; and pursuing the illustration of

<!-- page 185 -->

the idea by examples gradually more remote, you will
find that though distance lend enchantment to the view
of crime, it cannot diminish its responsibility. The
coward, who rolls a stone from the summit of a mountain
to crush his foe in the ravine, is certainly no less
criminal than the ruffian who boldly drives a stiletto to
the heart of his enemy.</p>

<p>"The conscience of the present age must be awakened,
its morality enlarged, its philanthropic efforts aggrandised
and stimulated. Sects must be annihilated, but
Christianity must be revivified. Bishops must become
extinct; Church pluralists, deans and chapters, cannibal
vicars, and starved curates, be spoken of as melancholy
traditions; but the little children and the poor, <i>which
Jesus loved</i>, must be cared for, and fed, and clothed; even
though tithes be abolished, Church property confiscated,
and the white surplices of the trained professors of a religion
which is too grand, too noble, and too beautiful
for the mechanical exhibitions of priestcraft, be converted
into shirts for the labourer, and robes for the fair
daughters of the people, no longer driven to sell their
souls and bodies, for bread, to the lust of the debauchee,
or the avarice of the speculator!"</p>

<p>A burst of sombre approbation followed this uncompromising
analysis, and the Grand Master continued his
address, in a calm but not less earnest strain&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the doctrine of love, the hearts of men must be
revolutionised. By the teachings of science, their intellects
must be liberated, and exalted.</p>

<p>"Knowledge is the primary source of all wealth and
all material comfort. The most expanded charity, without
expanded education, is utterly unable to defend the

<!-- page 186 -->

cause of the people against their deadly and only real
enemy&mdash;<i>Poverty</i>.</p>

<p>"There is a poverty of the mind, as of the purse, a
poverty which it is as essential, nay, more essential, to
remedy.</p>

<p>"This direr form of poverty pervades all classes. Its
evil effects are most terrible in the highest positions.
To combat the ignorance, therefore, of the so-called
educated classes, is the most important of the duties of
a true democrat and worshipper of light.</p>

<p>"Their greatest ignorance is their greatest crime.
They refuse to recognise that the real interests of the
people and of themselves are inseparable. They reluctantly
admit that justice and policy are two forms
of the same idea. All their power, all their fountains
of enjoyment, spring from the labour of the many,
directed by the science of the few. Yet they dream of
an indolent luxury, a voluptuous routine, without mental
effort or research. They do not feel that property exists
but by sufferance; that to work for the community, is
the condition of every temporary possession of wealth;
that the duties of an office neglected, entail loss of place
and salary; that the resources of a country must either
be developed in proportion to its population, or devoured
by its inhabitants, who eventually devour one another,
for lack of other nutriment. And this is no poetic
exaggeration, but a fearful truth, and every man who
perishes from more or less immediate want, suffering,
and care in a community, is a ghastly illustration of the
principle I have exemplified.</p>

<p>"All progress originates in individual genius. The
world will be governed, reformed, and regenerated for

<!-- page 187 -->

ever, despite all obstacles of time. If the governing
powers of a country prove themselves wanting in the
ability to govern, they will assuredly fall, and other
more potent spirits arise in their room. There is no <i>or</i>
in the case, no danger of the world perishing by the
folly of a single incarnate soul, or of a single generation.
The sons of light rise above the howling objurgations
and monstrous apprehensions of all 'latter day'
explosions. They mount the ladder of eternity with
fearless step; neither dismayed by the chaotic darkness
below, from which they have emerged, nor by the
dazzling clouds of flame above, towards which they are
ascending. The soul is an eternal pilgrim, student, and
reformer. Good and Evil, are spiritual light and
shadow. We have helped to make the past&mdash;we are
making the present, we are planning the future.</p>

<p>"Such, Oh my friends, is a feeble outline of the
principles I would fain hope all here subscribe to!"</p>

<p>"All, all!" responded the Illuminati, in tempestuous
approval, whilst their inspired leader thus concluded his
harangue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I have been prolix, forgive me. I believed that
to express fundamental ideas, in which we could unhesitatingly
unite, was, above all, the primary duty of the
glorious position in which you have placed me&mdash;a position
which it were mockery to add, I should but insult
by comparison with the thrones of worldly rulers. By
your free choice you have elected me your President.
I confess that before entering this hall, my soul trembled
beneath the weight of so sublime a burden. But it
trembles no more. I read in the noble countenances
around me, the purity of a triumph over all petty and

<!-- page 188 -->

hateful ambitions. It has been our unanimous desire
that all fruitless discussions should be avoided. Nevertheless,
as I see before me many men older, wiser, and,
I would fain believe, even more zealous in the cause of
liberty than myself, I entreat you, my brothers in hope,
to correct me if I have erred, to question me if I have
been obscure, and to supply my deficiencies where I have
failed in expression.</p>

<p>"It now only remains for me to point out briefly the
chief positive objects, to the attainment of which, according
to my judgment, all our efforts should be
directed in this country.</p>

<p>"And, firstly, without universal suffrage, without a
parliament elected by the people, it seems to me that
all progress is impossible, unless out-door agitation be
adopted as a permanent system, and intimidation be
substituted for reason, as an element of government.
What have we seen of late years? <i>A reign of terror!</i>
Pale Fear, enthroned as king&mdash;an obtuse and selfish pack
of legislators, frightened, literally <i>frightened</i>, into one
measure after another, by the determined menaces of
external politicians.</p>

<p>"Witness the Reform Bill, and the pitiful Whigs,
ready even to join in a rebellion projected by the
stronger spirits who inspired them. Witness the triumph
of the Anti-Corn-Law League!</p>

<p>"It is useless to reason with the corrupt and loquacious
band, who, under the banners of Whiggery or Protection,
waste the life and resources of the country in
their paltry struggles for place, patronage, and power.
The suffrage we must conquer from their fears, not sue
for from their intelligence. The serfs of Robert the

<!-- page 189 -->

Devil, or Lord John Twaddle, must be swept away, to
'make way for honester men,' The great doctrine of
equal political rights must be philosophically and
morally inculcated by every means in our power, more
especially amid the educated classes, who have been so
accustomed to hear the truth vilified and travestied in
<i>Timeservers</i>, <i>Slaughterly Reviews</i>, and other repositories
of hireling calumny, that they have quite lost sight of
the real bearings of the question.</p>

<p>"I leave it to you, my friends, to point out, in turn,
the arguments most effectual in support of this supreme
and vital object to all legislative reform.</p>

<p>"It is the only road to the realisation of the great
ideas which every philosophic lover of his race must
cherish and contend for.</p>

<p>"<i>National Education</i>, universal, gratuitous, and
liberal, absolutely free from all sectarian influence.</p>

<p>"<i>National Life Assurance</i>, by which the government
guarantees to every honest man, willing to labour, the
opportunity of working, or support without degradation,
with provision for the orphan and the aged, to the
amplest extent of human necessities and comforts.</p>

<p>"<i>National Justice</i>, free of all charge, and therefore
accessible to the poor, as easily as the rich.</p>

<p>"A <i>National Currency</i> adequate to the wants of expanding
commerce, and destructive of all monopoly of
the circulating medium.</p>

<p>"A <i>National System of Taxation</i>, levied solely on
property and income according to just estimates of value,
and not on the present plan of indiscriminate plunder.</p>

<p>"A <i>National Army</i> consisting of every adult in the
commonwealth, open as a profession to all classes, on the

<!-- page 190 -->

Prussian or French system&mdash;by examinations for promotion,
and entirely without purchase of commissions. The
standing army to be employed in public works.</p>

<p>"A <i>National Navy</i>, destined as much for colonisation
as for defence, and</p>

<p>"A <i>National Emigration System</i>, offering every reasonable
encouragement to colonists in the shape of
passages, free, or on credit, grants of land, with every
practicable information and assistance.</p>

<p>"My friends, there is nothing visionary or Utopian in
these great and inevitable demands of the age. It is a
fine thing for men who never yet could devise a plan,
worthy if even capable of execution, to denounce the
poet or philosopher who assumes the statesman, as a
dreamer and an impostor. I see before me the authors
of books and editors of journals, in which the noblest
principles and most subtle difficulties of policy, legislative
and administrative, have been handled with consummate
talent. It makes me smile to hear such minds
compared&mdash;yes, compared disadvantageously as candidates
for the exercise of national trust and power, with
country gentlemen of sporting renown&mdash;dandies of May
Fair, and denizens of 'tape and sealing-wax' offices.
Literary men, unless at the same time landholders or
millionaires (which removes all objections at once), are
sneered at by the toadies of the Aristocrats or Plutocrats.
But what could ordinary statesmen, with their barren
inventions, ignorant confidence in their limited experience,
and cautious timidities, have done during the late
revolutions in Paris, in Rome, in Hungary? We know
what they did&mdash;they ran away like their masters.
Intrigue, brute, force, and gold, have restored them for

<!-- page 191 -->

the moment to power. Yet even in these triumphs
they are forced to cringe to the giant they have chained.
Without the venal slaves and reckless renegades of the
press, they would vainly seek for Mamelukes to carry
out their designs. Let us not be daunted by the hollow
semblance of strength which they present. Within, all is
rottenness. Sooner or later human reason must reject
such miserable abortions as Thiers and Lord John
Twaddle, whose dwarfish, insignificant forms, marvellously
typify the pettiness of their undeveloped intellects.</p>

<p>"My friends, we are the miners of thought&mdash;true ideas
are the diamonds we seek to discover. Let us display
such jewels as we may find, to the eyes of our fellow-men,
that they may recognise their beauty, and have faith in
their reality. Let us speak our convictions boldly, in
the simplest and most intelligible form. Let us proclaim
our designs in the most fearless tones. Let us show the
people that our hearts, our intellects, and our lives, are
devoted to their liberation; and if the tyrants rejoice
over our graves, let us leave our memories and our
words to a posterity that must avenge us by its admiration,
whilst our immortal spirits yet bravely continue to
scale the ladder of everlasting perfectibility!"</p>

<p>The speech of the Grand Master was followed by enthusiastic
acclamations. One after the other, all the Illuminati
present rose to give in their adherence to the
principles and measures which Viridor had advocated.
With regard to the practical suggestions of his address,
the most valuable developments and the most lucid
arrangements were proposed, and demonstrated to be
capable of easy execution, The stale cobweb objections

<!-- page 192 -->

of apathy and ignorance were swept away, till not a
vestige remained to harass the mind of the assembly.</p>

<p>The most philosophical mode of primary education,
and the best system for national universities, open to all
classes and sects; the annihilation of pauperism by a
universal benefit association supplying the place of a
degrading poor-law; the extinction of mendicancy and
professional thievery, by labour guarantees and emigration;
the communion of employers and employed, by
national and corresponding labour-registries in every
town, for gratuitous advertisements and information; a
new plan for model-dwellings; the reduction of the
national debt, by rejection of the gold standard as the
base of currency-laws, and its gradual conversion into
circulating medium; the vast economy in cost, and increase
in utility, of the military organisation; the taxation
of the dead as the most rational of all impositions: the
facilities of buying and selling land without expense;
the suppression of adulteration and overcharges by shopkeepers;
the utter abolition of arrest for debt, except as
fraud; the facilities of credit, and impossibility of money
scarcity, with an adequate currency; the advantages
accruing to literature, education, and commerce, by the
abolishing of all taxes on knowledge; the economy in
collecting the revenue, by the consolidation of assessed
taxation, and dispensing with custom-houses; the effects
of sanitary reform nobly carried out; public libraries and
amusements for the people; and many other vitally-interesting
topics were touched upon and discussed with
clearness, brevity, and enthusiasm. Then followed some
profoundly important statements as to the condition of
the various states of Europe, and the prospects of true

<!-- page 193 -->

democracy; analyses of the various social and communist
theories prevalent in France and Germany, and resolutions
as to their hostility to all real liberty.</p>

<p>Much I regret that neither space nor time permits me
to record speeches, of which single paragraphs were
often more suggestive than whole sheets of Hansard.
But at present I must content myself with relating the
extraordinary proposition which terminated the proceedings
of the night.</p>

<p>All had spoken but Darian. He rose, at length, and
said, with impressive gravity,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are aware, my friends, to what mad lengths
barefaced venality and selfishness have gone in this city,
and thence in every capital in Europe. The human soul
is now bought and sold in the market-place, like cattle
or vegetables. To say your soul is your own, is no
longer regarded as a sign of courage, but of wealth.
Soul-dealing has become a raging speculation. Everybody
dabbles in it who takes any active part in the
world. But we are no participators in the commerce;
the souls we gain for our cause, are not to be gained by
purchase. Yet these priceless spirits are made to suffer
exquisite torments, by the corrupt mob which surrounds
them. The soul-dealers are carried away by chimerical
estimates. They are induced to persevere in their
abominable traffic, by the gross ignorance of the speculative
public.</p>

<p>"Brothers of the light, I have devised a scheme
which may succeed in awakening the deluded multitude
from their hallucinations.</p>

<p>"I propose to establish, with the least possible delay,
a <i>Grand Exposition of the Souls of All Nations!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 194 -->

<p>"It is a grand idea!" exclaimed Viridor, and all the
Illuminati, in admiring wonder.</p>

<p>But how is such an exposition possible? you will perhaps
exclaim, O reader, as, indeed, the Illuminati themselves
did not fail to demand.</p>

<p>All things are possible to genius like Darian's. Read
on, and learn. There is something to be learned in the
next chapter for those whose spirits are awakened.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 195 -->

<div class="center" id="cjb2ch06">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE GRAND EXPOSITION.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was not long before Darian, backed by Viridor and
the secret council of the Illuminati, made public the
adventurous proposition with which our last chapter
concluded.</p>

<p>Darian, availing himself of the opportunities which his
rank and vast wealth afforded, soon found a committee
of distinguished names with which to appeal to the
"flunkeyism" of the public. The committee was ultimately
constituted, in about equal proportions, of all
the three great ethico-political parties.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Darian, as President, with Viridor and
other Illuminati as allies, possessed a decided preponderance
in the committee. This was partly owing to
their perfect union of will, partly to a leaning, more or
less decided, towards liberalism, not to say Fire-worship,
on the part of their aristocratic and Mosaic coadjutors.</p>

<p>The dark Ignatius, who had still a lingering notion of
forming an advantageous political alliance with Darian,
and of availing himself of the literary genius of Viridor,
was a most influential supporter of all their propositions.
By his supreme command (which, as his wealth and
importance increased daily, owing to the prodigious
amount of business transacted at the Soul-Agency

<!-- page 196 -->

offices), a series of articles and reports appeared in the
<i>Timeserver</i>, extolling to the skies the Duke of St.
George's mysterious and original enterprise.</p>

<p>This caused the Daily Nous to "smell a rat"&mdash;which,
indeed, was but natural, as Sir James Rattam, of letter-violating
repute, was one of the committee. So the
<i>Daily Nous</i> shook its head, and suspended its judgment.
A young and lively contributor begged very hard to get
a slashing satirical leader inserted. But the Editor told
him, confidentially, to go and be hanged. So the <i>Daily
Nous</i> suspended its wit, as well as its judgment.</p>

<p>The lively contributor <i>did</i> hang himself&mdash;from a
gymnastic pole&mdash;and went through a course of fencing,
pistol-shooting, and billiard playing, to dissipate by
perspiration the gall of his disappointment.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Ghost</i>, however, took up the proposed
"Exposition" very kindly, and gave divers accounts of
the dinners of the committee, which were worthy of
the Arabian Nights and the poetry of fashion.</p>

<p>I rather like the <i>Ghost</i> for one thing. It is not so ill-natured
as many of its contemporaries. I attacked the
<i>Ghost</i> once with unnecessary ferocity. What was the
result? A review, upon the whole, favourable, in many
respects far more so than I deserved, unjust, it is true,
in estimating the moral of my book,* but more than
just as to its artistic merits.</p>

<p class="small">[*The "Impostor, or, Born Without a Conscience" (phrenologically
illustrated by the Author). This is another of the labours I shall
always remember with a certain regret. In picturing the character
of a subtle and consummate villain, I now see the danger of rendering
vice attractive whilst exposing its mysteries. The work was, after
all, but a wild, reckless sketch, which it were waste of time for any
reasonable being to peruse, unless reduced to desperation by ennui,
and on the verge of a "fashionable novel," from which mournful
affliction, Heaven defend all friends! Curiously enough, at the moment,
I, a mere novice, was dashing off the history of Mesmer de
Biron's unparalleled crimes and follies, a master in the art, to wit, Sir
Edward Bulwer Lytton, was devising the horrors of his "Lucretia,
or, The Children of the Night." "Children of the Night," indeed,
both books! Books founded upon the same idea, as evidenced by a
hundred curious coincidences in their pages. To have written "The
Impostor" at twenty, was a blunder; to have published "Lucretia"
at forty, something worse than an error. He who would paint Hells
should paint also Heaven. Poison for tens and antidotes for units,
are no good elements for works of popular circulation.]</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>The <i>Assin&oelig;um</i>&mdash;edited, if my memory of Paul Clifford
be not deceptive, by the celebrated and versatile Mac
Grawler&mdash;was extremely verbose in its recommendations
as to the conduct of the proposed exposition. Whether
any hope of "surreptitiously accumulating bustle" influenced
their conduct, I cannot tell, any more than
what was paid by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, to exclude the advertisements
of my work from their columns.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Cobbler</i>, the <i>Humbug</i>, and the <i>Globule</i>,
were also favorable to the Grand Exposition of Souls.</p>

<p>But the <i>Evening Gun</i> took the opportunity of attacking,
with great spirit, the whole system of soul-dealing.
The <i>Exponent</i> and <i>Spectator</i> were also beginning to rise
boldly in defence of a more daring liberalism than had
been yet popular with established journals. Neither was
the sharp thunder of the <i>Diapason</i> silent. The gibes of
the <i>Hunchback</i> were full of dubious bitterness, but the
leviathan <i>Timeserver</i> belched defiance of all opposition.
The greater number of the weekly press seemed prepared
to stem the torrent of demoralisation which threatened
the age; and several of the provincial papers especially,
made noble, though for the time ineffectual, exertions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Darian and Viridor bore the wondering
distrust of their friends with secret confidence in their
approaching triumph. Subscriptions were collected, prize

<!-- page 198 -->

masks modelled and cast, and a vast building prepared
for the coming display of the earth's spiritual resources.</p>

<p>At length the day for opening the exhibition was announced,
and the following prospectus issued to the
astonished public:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>"GRAND EXPOSITION</p>

<p class="small">"OF THE</p>

<p>"SOULS OF ALL NATIONS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

"It being a recognised fact in the present age, that
'the use of language is to disguise thought'&mdash;that hypocrisy
is the rule, and sincerity the exception&mdash;that the
expressions of human countenances are as artificial as
pasteboard masks&mdash;and that no man in his senses believes
open candour, in word, look, or deed, to be either rational
or politic, we (the committee) have come to the conclusion
that to exhibit any amount of human souls in their
true character, it is absolutely necessary that the said
souls should be deprived of that reasoning faculty which,
when they possessed it, was mainly employed for the
purpose of abusing the credulity, and misleading the
ideas, of their fellow-citizens and acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Before resorting to this extreme measure (of human
veracity), the committee were recommended to consider
the ancient saying, '<i>in vino veritas</i>&mdash;in wine, truth'&mdash;but
though convinced to a great extent of the truth of the
saying itself (which probably was originated by Bacchus
in the act of rolling under the Olympian mahogany), the
committee were dismayed by the prospect of the difficulty
and expense of maintaining so large a number of

<!-- page 199 -->

persons as their catalogue contains, exhibited in a
permanent state of veracious intoxication. They also
dreaded, in thus throwing open the portals of the souls,
lest the bodies which they inhabited should suffer by the
draught, and the Exposition ultimately become dead
drunk&mdash;in a sense far more shocking than that ordinarily
implied by the phrase.</p>

<p>"The Exposition, therefore, will consist of a choice
collection of souls of every class, order, and species,
which, unable to vibrate steadily between reason and
imagination, have had the misfortune to lose their balance
in favour of the latter function. These spirits out of their
equilibrium, commonly known as lunatics, from a certain
tendency to abandon this miserable earth for its snug
little satellite, the moon (supposed to contain less water
to damp the spirits than its primary); these eccentric individualities,
whose natal stars are comets and other
celestial monsters, will offer to intelligent soul-dealers
the most admirable opportunities for investigating the
value of the invisible merchandise.</p>

<p>"Prizes will be given for the most extraordinary
political, social, and scientific madman, in the shape of
brazen masks, expressly designed and fabricated for the
occasion.</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed) &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>The eve of the exhibition arrived; and Darian, with
Basiline upon his arm, accompanied by Viridor, Ignatius,
all the committee, and an immense number of their personal
friends, commenced a tour of inspection, preparatory
to the admission of the general public on the
following day.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>A temporary building of vast extent had been erected,
in front of the Duke of Supperland's palace, in St.
James's Park. The building was, in form, a huge
rotunda, surrounded by wooden columns, which, together
with the wails, were so adroitly painted as to represent,
even to deception, stone long exposed to the action of
the elements. From the simple capitals of these pillars
arose a vast dome, surmounted by a colossal bust of
Ignatius Loyola Grey, which Darian and Viridor had
insisted upon, despite the modest objections of that
worthy gentleman, who too soon, in the jealous hatred of
his aristocratic and plutocratic allies, reaped the reward
of his weakness.</p>

<p>In the interior, there were, circle within circle, rows
of square cages, some twenty feet in length by twelve in
breadth. Each of these was divided into two compartments&mdash;a
bedroom, lighted only from above, and a
sitting-room open on one side&mdash;which was protected by
ornamental ironwork, as a wild-beast den by its bars.
Each of these cages in the rotunda contained one or
more lunatics, of the most varied descriptions. Above
each cage was affixed a brief account of its inmate or
inmates, and the cages were so arranged, side by side
and back to front, that none of their occupants could see
or communicate with one another&mdash;nor, indeed, had they
any suspicion that they formed part of a Grand Exposition;
having been brought blindfold to their present
abodes, and being quite unconscious of one another's
proximity. The walls facing the cages, which were, in
fact, the backs of other similar dwellings, were splendidly
tapestried, and the passages between covered by magnificent
carpets. The dwellings of the lunatics were

<!-- page 201 -->

variously furnished, from the height of extravagant
luxury to the depth of most abject simplicity. Each
lived in a world of his own, an unconscious transcendentalist
of the extreme party. Another cage, another
world. Let us contemplate a few of these extravagant
microcosms of the age.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 202 -->

<div class="center" id="cjb2ch07">

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE GRAND EXPOSITION, WITH A SUPPLEMENT.</p>

</div>

<p>EACH of the visitors had in his hand a printed catalogue
of the souls exhibited. Brilliant jets of gas illumined
the broad passages and successive cages, which rather
resembled the stages of a long line of diminutive
theatres, than anything else I can think of.</p>

<p>Over the first cage was written, in crimson characters&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AN IRISH LANDLORD.</p>

<p>The interior resembled an apartment of a fashionable
hotel in the utmost disorder and confusion. A tall and
ghastly figure, in a torn shooting coat, with long, wiry,
red whiskers and beard, strode irregularly up and down
the apartment.</p>

<p>He appeared utterly unconscious of the presence of
strangers, and continued to mutter half audible soliloquies,
in a tone that vibrated between the most savage
rage and the most overwhelming sentiment of remorse.</p>

<p>"It must be had&mdash;<i>must!</i>" he murmured, "at all
costs, at all hazards. I must write to my agent. Ha!
what does he mean by this delay? Their rents are in
in arrear! Their crops have failed! The old story.
I know better. It is their infernal laziness! They boil
their potatoes, smoke their pipes, and care for nobody

<!-- page 203 -->

but themselves. What a hell is suspense! What shall
I do? let me see, shall I dine at the club? The Hock
was bad yesterday. It is better at the Reform. I'd give
a thousand pounds to horsewhip Baxter. It was he that
black-balled me, I am sure of it; I recollect his saying
once&mdash;Ha! what is that?"&mdash;and the madman stared in
an insane agony of fear at the faces of the visitors, which
to <i>him</i> were spectres from the abyss. "What! all&mdash;<i>all</i>
dead&mdash;dead by cold, hunger&mdash;starved, murdered! Why
do you fix those stony eyes upon me? It was not <i>I</i> that
ordered your cottages to be levelled with the ground!
<i>I</i> knew nothing of your poverty and blighted fields&mdash;at
least I did not believe it&mdash;I thought it was a trick to
frighten me. I wanted money, money, money! I had
debts, there were writs&mdash;writs out against me, and the
minister, curse him! he promised to make me governor
of Madagascar! O thou villain, heartless, cold-blooded
villain of an agent! to drive them out&mdash;in winter, too&mdash;
the young children&mdash;found frozen to death&mdash;I refused
the means of emigration? O devil of torment, is it not
a debt of honour? does not my very existence depend
upon its arrival&mdash;still no remittance, and I dare not
die? Ha! ha! I am still the O'Dhoon, the great
O'Dhoon, and my ancestors were kings, ha! ha! Let us
once get repeal, and the fiend take the sheriff and his
blackguards."</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>With a shudder of disgust the party passed on to the
next number in the catalogue.</p>

<p class="center">A BRIDE OF MAMMON</p>

<p>Was the superscription which Viridor, to whom that

<!-- page 204 -->

department had been almost exclusively abandoned,
had chosen for its tenant.</p>

<p>A beautiful woman, about seven-and-twenty, with long
black hair that streamed unconfined over her shoulders,
crouched pitiably in the corner of a sofa, surrounded by
the usual paraphernalia of a lady's boudoir.</p>

<p>All present gazed upon her with commiseration.</p>

<p>Catching the eye of Viridor, who, with Darian and
Basiline, was foremost in the crowd, she appealed to him
in a tone of anguish that went home to the hearts of all
hearers. Even the dark Ignatius contracted his brow
slightly with an air of painful interest.</p>

<p>"My dear brother!" she exclaimed, feebly raising her
head, and fixing her unnaturally lustrous eyes upon the
noble countenance of the poet, "you have returned from
India at last&mdash;after so many years! Oh! what I have
suffered in your absence! Oh! what I have suffered by
your loss! O, Henry, Henry, I am so wretched, so very
wretched!"</p>

<p>And the poor lady buried her face in her arms, and
sobbed convulsively for some minutes.</p>

<p>Basiline wept silently on the shoulder of Darian.
There was scarcely a person present not deeply affected
by the scene. Viridor and Darian exchanged one rapid
glance of intelligence, and the former said in a whisper
to the poet, "We are not come out of season, Viridor.
It is not for proletarians alone that emancipation is
needed."</p>

<p>The history of this soul was told in a few words by the
catalogue.</p>

<p>"Married at the age of nineteen, to a man worth
seven thousand a-year, aged sixty-five, of a jealous

<!-- page 205 -->

temperament. Ran away at the end of two years with
Captain of Infantry. Deserted by Captain, who was involved
in debt, and unable to support her. Received
into the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Asylum on the 14th day of March,
18&mdash;."</p>

<p class="small">"Es ist eine alte Geschichte<br/>

Doch bleibt es ewig neu.<br/>

'Tis an oft repeated story,<br/>

And yet for ever new,"</p>

<p>murmured Basiline, as they quitted the distressing spectacle,
to gaze upon another victim.</p>

<p>All, save Darian, Viridor, and Ignatius, started, as
they read the title of the succeeding compartment&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AN EX-KING.</p>

<p>They beheld an old man with his hair white as the
fleecy clouds of summer. His wrinkled visage revealed
a dismal history of craft and toilsome cares. He appeared
to enjoy a lucid interval&mdash;to enjoy, did I say? Alas!
the wildest ravings of distracted oblivion were preferable
to that old man's dread intervals of consciousness. He
regarded the visitors with a sombre gaze of despair,
whilst thus addressing them with a forced and hideous
calmness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look at me, children of earth, whoever you may be,
and learn to profit by my deserved misfortunes! I was
a king! I reigned by the choice of a nation, after years
of exile and suffering, which did not teach me wisdom!
I forgot that every magistrate is the servant of the
people,&mdash;I forgot the crimes and punishments of my
race,&mdash;I forgot my debt to the people, my master. I
committed treason against my sovereigns,&mdash;I became

<!-- page 206 -->

their corrupter and tyrant, who should have been their
benefactor and liberator; and I madly dreamed of opposing
the laws of mental progress, and denying the authors
of my existence as a monarch; until one day I heard
the voice of my creator, like Adam after eating the forbidden
fruit, and I fled in terror before the face of the
master I had robbed and outraged."</p>

<p>Full of solemn reflections on the sins and penalty of
this ancient man, the visitors continued their way to
discover that the fourth cage enclosed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">A MEDIOCRITY.</p>

<p>This room wore an official aspect. There were papers
tied with red tape, and files of reports and newspapers,
and chairs of impenetrable horsehair, strong in the legs,
and suited to bear the writhings of disappointment and
aggrieved mortality.</p>

<p>A small man, with pinched-up, insignificant features,
sat, with one leg crossed over the other, in an arm-chair
before a writing-table. His countenance yet
preserved an idiotic expression of <i>finesse</i>, as he muttered,
with a hollow chuckle, "To delay&mdash;to say nothing,
with an air of profundity&mdash;to sustain hopes, and trust
to what may turn up&mdash;to steal the ideas and purchase
the labour of men of talent, behold the art of statesmanship
summed up in a paragraph. Egad! I must make
some plausible reply to those confounded questions about
Ireland this evening, but as for the measure of Old
Bendigo, it must be suppressed at once. Only let us
push off business to the close of the session, and we shall
have the run of the house, like the younger brother at
his seniors."</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>Next in order came&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">A DEMAGOGUE.</p>

<p>A man with coarse black hair, and a rubicund visage
sprang upon his legs at the appearance of our party,
and burst extempore into a flood of oratory.</p>

<p>In a ferocious exordium he denounced everybody, and
every party, as monsters of iniquity and far-seeing
cruelty. He attributed to the ministry and aristocracy,
designs of the most marvellous complication, which none
but a madman could have conceived. He denounced
the more calm and philosophical democrats, as lukewarm
traitors, or "visionary theorists" (the old hackneyed
phrase of fools of all parties). He preached the
pike, the musket, and the sabre, and immediate insurrection,
in spite of all odds against him and his supporters.
He asked what they meant by giving the
Queen a million a year to spend in sugar-plums? and
the Prince Consort another fifty thousand for cigars?
"As for the national debt, why should the children pay
what the fathers borrowed? why should they be taxed
and ground to the dust, for the villanies of a man called
Pitt, who, luckily for England, was dead and buried long
ago. Take a sponge&mdash;make a clean wipe of it&mdash;and
the thing was done. What they wanted was the Charter&mdash;no,
there were six points&mdash;three cheers for every
point&mdash;Hurrah!"</p>

<p>This man had been imprisoned for sedition, treated as
a common felon, and eventually had been driven mad by
poverty, and a wild consciousness of his own and the
people's wrongs.</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>Little did he think that in the next apartment was the
man to whom he was indebted for all his sufferings.</p>

<p class="center">A GOVERNMENT SPY.</p>

<p>A low-browed, mean-looking creature, was rolling himself
in a heap of straw on the floor of his cage. He
gnashed his teeth with impotent fury, till the blood-stained
foam dropped from the corners of his lips.</p>

<p>"A six months' voyage between me and England&mdash;here
in the bush&mdash;in an Australian desert&mdash;with nothing
stronger than tea to drink, and oxen for companions!
Is this the fine position his pigmy lordship promised?
Is this what I have sold myself to Hell for?&mdash;made myself
a perjured, infamous, scouted wretch, at whose touch
even murderers and burglars recoil! How well I recollect
the day!&mdash;I was an informer before; but at least I
had the law on my side. The peeler in plain clothes&mdash;he
looked more of a gentleman, by G&mdash;, than Twaddle
himself&mdash;took me to a house&mdash;I forget the street&mdash;we
went in a cab. How polite the little Satan was! It was,
'Take a seat, Gruel,'&mdash;'don't be alarmed, Gruel,'&mdash;'a
glass of wine, Gruel?' And how he lured me on, and
twisted my thoughts inside out, and half made me believe
that to be a lying, traitorous, heartless scoundrel, was
next door to serving one's country, and getting statues
on arches, like the Duke of Wellington! Oh, how his
slippery gammon sickens me to think of, and to remember
how I went among the poor, discontented fools, who
waste their time in grumbling, instead of shooting down
their rich, cold-blooded tyrants, and firing their d&mdash;&mdash;d
houses! how I swore brotherhood with them, and encouraged
them to talk treason over their beer, and to

<!-- page 209 -->

trust me with their papers, and&mdash;&mdash;and all to get up in
a box to swear black was white, to get them locked up
and transported, killed off on the sly, for anything <i>I</i> know.
I recollect how my head spun round, and my knees
knocked together, as a prisoner came up, as quiet and
easy as if he had been the judge himself, and looked at
me. O God! shall I ever forget those looks of cold
contempt and wondering pity. <i>They</i> didn't care, they
believed, at any rate, that they were right at bottom,
and their friends called them martyrs. But I&mdash;I am
branded, like Cain, with everlasting infamy. Go where
I will, I dread recognition. And they have not even
kept faith with me. They have sent me here, with a
miserable hundred pounds in my pocket, and left me
to get on as I can. How <i>can</i> I live in this quiet,
country solitude? I, who have the memories of so many
villanous lies, ingratitudes, and cowardly treacheries
upon my conscience? I wish I had that little lordship
by the throat&mdash;thus, thus&mdash;" and the poor wretch
twisted a whisp of straw with furious excitement. "Die,
die, dog of a lord," he yelled, "die, and let your knavish
judges, who have no ears for the poor man, condemn me&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;on my own oath&mdash;ha! ha! I have sworn
to stronger things&mdash;die! die!" and the voice of the
miserable <i>ci-devant</i> informer lapsed into inarticulate
howlings, and threats of diabolical vengeance.</p>

<p>"He strangles the poor minister twenty times a day,"
said Viridor, "it would be an evil hour for the latter,
if his cast-away tool were to break loose and encounter
him alone!"</p>

<p>"It would perhaps be of more consequence to Twaddle,

<!-- page 210 -->

than to the rest of the world," said Darian, with unusual
bitterness. "A slippery, prevaricating, faithless chameleon
of a Whig, is an object of far greater abhorrence to
a Fire-worshipper, than the most obstinate Tory, or
even the most rabid ecclesiastical bigot."</p>

<p>The horrified company passed on. They beheld in
turn</p>

<p class="center">A MAN OF FASHION.</p>

<p>Self love and vanity, excited to a fearful degree of
sensitive suspicion, had turned his brain. He still
amused himself with his toilette, and strutted, peacock-like,
about his cage, despising mankind, as of old, without
suspecting for an instant that two-thirds of them, in all
probability, returned the compliment.</p>

<p class="center">A JOURNALIST AND A BARRISTER,</p>

<p>Both driven mad by the confusion of their ideas, and
their unprincipled mode of using them. The one had
written, and the other had pleaded, half his life-time, in
diametrical opposition to his real convictions, which,
during the other moiety of his career, he had defended
with consummate talent. At length they had both lost
their hold on truth and moral certainty, and from many-headed
monsters, degenerated into chaotic mysteries.</p>

<p class="center">A SPECULATOR,</p>

<p>Who had robbed mankind without scruple&mdash;a sort of
ex-king in miniature, who had become melancholy mad,
from the utter want of social enjoyment, after being
cut by all the world, on the detection of his frauds.</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

<p class="center">A RELIGIOUS FANATIC,</p>

<p>Whose soul was haunted by a phantom, which the poor
idiot mistook for a God, and whose occupation, in the
maniac's belief, was to make the creatures he had created
utterly miserable on earth, and burn them after death
to all eternity, if they did not thank him for their
misery.</p>

<p class="center">AN ARTIST,</p>

<p>The greatness of whose ideas necessitated canvasses
fifteen feet by twelve, and figures eight feet high.
He could not be persuaded that high art could exist
without gigantic paintings. Moreover, he had a passion
for painting very muscular men, and voluptuous-looking
females, in a costume not recognised as presentable, save
in the South Sea Islands. The greatness of his pictures,
if not of his ideas, was the cause of his ruin. English
architecture did not produce rooms large enough for his
productions, and the state did not provide a national
gallery for modern art. Thus he came to be exhibited
in the Grand Exposition of All Nations, and drew charcoal
cartoons upon the walls of his apartment.</p>

<p class="center">A TOADY,</p>

<p>Who had so long flattered the whims of others, and
sacrificed his own opinions to his patrons', that he had
gone out of his mind altogether, and lost all consciousness
of individual identity.</p>

<p class="center">A DOCTOR,</p>

<p>Who had become <i>non compos mentis</i> from the number
of patients he had dismissed to the shades in a long
course of experiments upon the mysteries of man's

<!-- page 212 -->

bodily organisation. The dread of having poisoned an
old lady by an extra dose of hydrocianic acid, and a
coroner's inquest, destroyed what little sanity he had ever
possessed.</p>

<p class="center">A DRUNKARD,</p>

<p>Who had accustomed himself to drown his thoughts in
wine so effectually, that no humane society could now
recover them.</p>

<p class="center">A POET,</p>

<p>Who had begun by adoring Tennyson, and ended
by writing insane poems in an unknown tongue,
formed of all the obsolete words in the dictionary, and
complicated by so sublime a system of involution, that
no mortal intellect but his own could unravel their mysteries.
The world did not understand him. He did not
awake and find himself famous, though he impoverished
a poor and devoted mother to print his dismal lucubrations,
whose utter failure brought him to his present
climax. He amused himself by abusing the world in
verse, for which he had abundant leisure.</p>

<p class="center">A SOCIALIST PHILOSOPHER,</p>

Who had taught despotism under the name of "Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity." Despairing of reducing society
to a machine, and man to a numeral, he fell into a
state of fanatic delirium, which qualified him for the
Grand Exposition of all Nations.</p>

<p>These were a few of the vast gallery of souls, which
had destroyed the fine balance of their nervous organs,

<!-- page 213 -->

by the violence of their passions or conceptions. At what
vast expense and trouble they had been collected, it is
of little import to narrate. Enough, that no phase of
moral or intellectual aberration was without its representative
in that marvellous and unexampled exhibition.</p>

<p>As for the virtuous and lofty intelligences, I must refer
the reader to the <i>catalogue</i>, which may be seen at the
British Museum, as soon as a certain <i>other</i> catalogue be
printed for the information of the public.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>It was long past midnight, as Viridor descended from
a cab at the gate of the Temple, and, thoroughly exhausted
by the fatigues of the day and the excitement of
the evening, hastened, on entering his chambers, to
undress himself and prepare for repose.</p>

<p>Suddenly the appearance of his table struck him as
changed from the condition in which he had left it. A
quarto Viridor had been reading before leaving his
chambers was open at a different page from that he had
consulted. Although this circumstance might have arisen
from his accidentally turning over a few pages, or even
a draught of air in opening the door, it was sufficient to
arouse all his old suspicions as to intrusion, during his
absence, into his apartments.</p>

<p>Now, so far as Viridor knew, there was but one key to
the door of his castle&mdash;for a man's chambers, if not his
house, <i>are</i> his castle in England&mdash;and that key, Viridor
had, as usual, carried with him in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that old woman is a hypocrite after all,"
muttered the poet, "and yet I cannot help having faith
in her round, honest, good-tempered face. Pshaw!
when once a man gets a fixed idea into his head&mdash;now

<!-- page 214 -->

I could have sworn that I left that cupboard closed when
I went out. No matter, I will try an experiment to-morrow,
which will decide the question. I have not
missed anything as yet. There is my purse, which I
forgot to take with me, safe and untouched. No, it
must be a mere fancy that haunts me. Last night, I
thought I heard a noise, as of some animal breathing.
It is very strange, and reminds me of some of the
anecdotes of Burns' Anatomy of Sleep."</p>

<p>Thus meditating, Viridor entered his bed-room,
placed the candle and lucifers, according to his custom,
on a small table at his bed-side, and having completed
his toilette for the night, betook himself to immediate
repose.</p>

<p>Lying upon his right side, with his head supported on
his hand, the young poet for some moments reflected on
the strange Exposition which was to-morrow to be
thrown open to the eagerly expectant metropolis&mdash;crowded,
in consequence, with strangers from every
state of the continent, the American republics, and even
Egypt, Syria, and Persia.</p>

<p>During these reflections he pictured, with that involuntary
play of fancy peculiar to excited nervous organisations,
a variety of grotesque designs on the panels of the
apartment&mdash;which latter was large, bare, and old-fashioned
in its decorations. At length, extinguishing
the candle, he turned round and endeavoured to compose
himself to sleep.</p>

<p>Some considerable time elapsed, and distant clocks
struck quarters, and halves, and three-quarters, and still
Viridor lay awake, and planned, and turned, and combined,
and changed his position, until, in the utter

<!-- page 215 -->

silence of the night, or rather of the morning, which
began to break through the window-blinds faintly, as a
beauty's smile upon a rival's triumph, Viridor distinctly
heard the breathing which he had alluded to in his
soliloquy, and which apparently proceeded from some
place in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Viridor rose, lighted the candle, and drawing part of
the bed-clothes after him in his haste, by way of a robe,
hastily examined every corner of both sitting-room and
bed-room, first looking beneath the bed, which, indeed,
was not a very probable locality, as, however deceptive
sound may be, he could hardly have failed to detect so
near a disturbance.</p>

<p>No place now remained unsearched but a large lumber-closet
in the bed-room, which Viridor had not at first
thought of searching, as, owing to its dilapidated condition,
it had been, and still appeared to be, nailed up outside
in a way that rendered it impossible of entry, without
removing the nails.</p>

<p>But on minute inspection, Viridor discovered that
several of the nails were missing, and that the others did
not necessarily bite the interior woodwork.</p>

<p>The breathing had ceased, but nevertheless Viridor
felt convinced that he was on the verge of some strange
discovery. Such presentiments rarely deceive. He tore
open the door, which offered no resistance, as he had
anticipated, and entering the closet, which was of considerable
size, he held up the flickering light, and cast a
searching glance into the darkness before him.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so, than an object, which at first
sight he mistook for a bundle of old clothes on the floor,
started up, and displayed to his astonished gaze the

<!-- page 216 -->

figure of a man, so ragged, so emaciated, and so wild
in its aspect, that he half mistook it for a spectre of
his own diseased imagination. Of a surety, no lunatic
exhibited in the Grand Exposition he had that evening
visited, could compete in horror with the wretch who
now confronted his gaze.</p>

<p>Viridor started back in horror, as the blood-shot eyes
of his unbidden guest glared upon him with a look which
his then tone of mind naturally interpreted as insanity.</p>

<p>"Who and what are you?" said the poet, sternly
motioning to the man to emerge from his place of concealment.</p>

<p>"The most unfortunate of men," replied the ragged
stranger; "but I swear to you by my soul, that I came
not here to rob or injure you. Let me depart in peace,
my sufferings will soon be over."</p>

<p>For an instant Viridor, fatigued and irritated, was
about to give way to the suspicions natural under such
circumstances, and to rid himself of his unseemly visitor
as speedily as might be, leaving the secret of his entry,
whether by false key or unknown door, for after investigation.</p>

<p>But the sound of the stranger's voice, which was full of
unutterable sadness,&mdash;the study of his features, which
Viridor now observed to be of a singularly intellectual
cast,&mdash;above all, his own gentle heart, almost girlish in
its susceptibility, checked the unworthy impulse, and
caused him to assume a less severe aspect, as he briefly
demanded from the tenant of the closet an explanation
of his unaccountable conduct.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the stranger, "I know you too well to
fear that you would seek to molest me for what I have

<!-- page 217 -->

done, however dishonest or criminal it may appear in
the eyes of vulgar persons. It is not very long since
I tenanted these very chambers, like yourself. Unexpected
misfortunes plunged me into utter poverty.
I had no friends or relations to assist me, for I was
left an orphan in my youth, and have never cultivated
the acquaintance of men or women.</p>

<p>"My furniture was seized for rent, I was absolutely
without resources at fifty years of age, and without
possessing a single talent or science, by which I could
earn a living. I had no choice but between starvation
and beggary, when it suddenly occurred to me, that I
had the key of my old chambers in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Impelled by I know not what design, I hovered
about the house until I discovered that you were the
new tenant. I then watched you out, and having seen
you enter an omnibus for Kensington, I returned, and
once more entered my old habitation.</p>

<p>"At first I merely intended to take a farewell look
at my old apartments, dear to me from the many years
I had occupied them. But happening to see some pages
of manuscript lying on your table, I could not resist
the temptation of trying to learn what sort of a man
had become my substitute. The first words I read were
these&mdash;I have repeated them so often that I cannot be
mistaken in their tenor&mdash;'Life is more sacred than property.
If society deny a man bread, society commands
him to be a robber, for the law forbids suicide, and to
rob a man of his property is a less crime than to
rob him of his life. Therefore let the law deal more
justly with those debtors and robbers, who, by poverty
alone, are driven to such desperate resources.'</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>"It appeared to be a translation from an old Latin
author, and was followed by annotations of your own,
which deeply impressed me with respect for the benevolence
and uprightness of your character.</p>

<p>"Seeing a loaf of bread upon the side-table, I proceeded
to carry out the principles of the manuscript, by
cutting a small piece in such a manner as to leave the
loaf in appearance little changed, and&mdash;pardon my
shameless audacity&mdash;from that time, now many weeks
ago, I have, day after day, repeated my visits; feeding
on the remnants of your breakfast, or robbing you of
small slices of bread, cut in the same cunning manner;
and amusing myself with the study of your books and
manuscript, which I always endeavoured to replace with
the nicest exactness. Often you were absent for whole
days from the chambers, and I was left without food,
or scarcely daring to touch what remained, for fear of
exciting suspicion.</p>

"At night, having no means of obtaining a lodging,
I slept in the open air, under arch-ways, or other miserable
shelter, until I found means to open that cupboard,
which is, as you will observe, ventilated by a small
opening near the ceiling; from that time I have been
in the habit of listening for your footsteps (which I can
distinguish from all others at the first sound of your
tread), and then hastily creeping into my hiding-place,
where I slept or meditated in silence, until I heard you
again descend the staircase, and found myself at liberty
to emerge from my confinement.</p>

<p>"And now farewell! do not regret that the crumbs
from your table have fed a victim of the world's ignorance.
I have lived too long to dream of human

<!-- page 219 -->

actions coinciding with human words. Nevertheless,
go on as you have begun, preach justice, and when you
have the power, practice charity."</p>

<p>So saying, the old man, placing the key&mdash;which was
the key to the whole adventure&mdash;in the hands of his
involuntary host, passed through the door with abrupt
rapidity, leaving Viridor speechless with emotion at the
recital of misery so abject. He was aroused from his
reverie by the noise of a window-sash thrown violently
open. He placed the candle on the ground, rushed into
the adjoining room, and was barely in time to grasp the
arm of the stranger, who strove desperately to throw
himself headlong upon the sharp stones of the court
below.</p>

<p>But though encumbered with the blankets, which left
him one hand only at liberty, Viridor's youthful vigour
was not to be resisted by the enfeebled frame of the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Promise me not to make any new attempt upon your
life, and I promise you, on my part, all the assistance
you require," said the Grand Master of the Illuminati,
with assuring kindness. "Oh, man of little faith! did
you, then, ransack the repositories of my most secret
thoughts, and yet doubt the unity of my doctrine with
my life? Why did you not come to me, and tell me
frankly your wants and sufferings? Each can but
remedy the immediate suffering he encounters. Whatever
my other errors, I have never allowed any motive,
save imperative duty, to interfere with my sense of
justice to the poor. For know, my friend, that to a
philosophic mind, the duties of property, however limited,
or extended, are its noblest rights. Base, indeed, in my

<!-- page 220 -->

eyes, is the man who, possessing a solitary loaf, allows
his brother man to hunger at his side! There will come
a day when churches will be fewer, whilst school-houses
are more abundant; when the cold charity of pseudo-Christians
will be replaced by the living charity of their
Master; when the heart will be thought worth educating
as well as the head; and it will be no more to ask a
passing stranger for a meal than for a direction to a,
street. Meanwhile, consider yourself my welcome guest.
Repose upon that sofa for the night. To-morrow, you
can, if it please you, inform me of the causes that have
led to misfortunes which, until the contrary appear, I
shall continue to believe unmerited."</p>

<p>The stranger pressed Viridor's hand between both his
own, with a half incredulous gaze of delighted gratitude.</p>

<p>"O, my generous friend!" he exclaimed, "why did I
doubt your greatness? Life is indeed to me a burthen,
yet I will live in the hope of proving to you my gratitude
and my devotion."</p>

<p>It was already daylight, and the candle flickered with
a pale and feeble light, as Viridor once more devoted
himself to repose.</p>

<p>All slept in the great City of Jugglers, but it was the
calm that foreboded the tempest.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE GIANT'S SHADOW.</p>

</div>

<p>A THINKING soul, owner of a leasehold property in an
organic tenement of flesh, would as vainly strive to
measure its relations to external entities, as to calculate
the limit of a decimal repetend, or the varieties of combined
forms and colors that may be produced by a
kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>Every living spirit, like a celestial sun-god, emits in
every direction, the radiating influence of its immeasurable
power, and is finite only by comparison with a vaster
Infinite.</p>

<p>This work,&mdash;this volcanic eruption of my soul, speech
in the spiritual parliament of thought, sarcastic <i>repartee</i>
to liars social, liars political, liars dialectic, analytic, and
synthetic,&mdash;this mythical history, magnetic revelation,
dream of poetic vanity, incomprehensible cartoon, or
whatever else it turn out to be in the eyes of men or
angels,&mdash;in a word, this volume, bound and illustrated,
and to be had at circulating libraries, is now drawing to
a rapid and inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>My intercourse with you, my spirit-friends, must be
interrupted. "I must pause for a reply;" and with so much
unsaid, so little said, of the fiery-thought element which
has swept me, as in a whirlwind, into publicity, I must
await the cold judgment of the indifferent, the sharp invective

<!-- page 224 -->

of the hostile, and the rare praise of the sympathising
reader. I must be patient&mdash;patient with the reflection
that time, space, and I know not what other causes, have
stood between me and the perfect realisation of my
object. I have recorded the suggestions for measures
which I was forbidden to develope in detail, though prepared
and eager for the task; I have risked incurring
the stigma of superficiality, for fear of being condemned
as wearisome and pedantic, and in the dread of losing
a season and an opportunity, for which I have so long
sighed, I have written in a few weeks the history of
spiritual combinations, which years of study have prepared,
and at least as many months of artistic effort
should have given form to.</p>

<p>Not that I demand indulgence from my political antagonists.
Let them do their worst; I defy their enmity.
It is from those only whose hearts beat in harmony with
my own,&mdash;whose love for the people, and resolution to
aid their progress from barbarism and misery, to civilisation
and happiness, cause them to dread even an
imperfect advocacy of their principles,&mdash;that I request
consideration for having so rudely fulfilled a task which
no other man has had the audacity to attempt.</p>

<p>Let the Viridors, and Darians, and Basilines of the
age awake from their inactivity. I am but the sentinel
of the night whose trumpet heralds the morning.</p>

<p>Yet, to resume the train of ideas with which this
chapter began, how can the thinker, who once casts
his treasures, real or fancied, into the gulph of print,
that best telegraph of mind, how can he fix the circle of
his readers, or say to what remote climes the commerce
of the world may not bear his ghostly merchandize?</p>

<!-- page 225 -->

<p>Who knows what Indian or Chinese philosopher, ambassador
from Nepaul, or advanced Otaheitan speculator,
may puzzle himself over this eccentric history?</p>

<p>I feel it truly difficult to convey to such remote intelligences,
any adequate notion of the pitch to which
Soul-dealing, and other similar speculations, had arrived
in this metropolis, <i>par excellence</i> of jugglers!</p>

<p>Not only were Soul-agency offices multiplied, and
soul-lists published, as described in the money articles of
the daily press, but the most singular schemes were
started cotemporaneously, with a view to taking advantage
of the public <i>cacoethes</i> of gambling.</p>

<p>One set of ingenious rascals had started an office as
agents to all kings in Europe for the sale of titles.
Patents of nobility were growing as common, and about
as valuable, as protested bills in the market. Pedigrees
were to be had with them, if required; and men sold their
ancestors, and proclaimed themselves bastards, with the
same coolness shewn in saddling their children with
debt, to relieve themselves from taxation.</p>

<p>Even reputations were sold, and realised by advertisement.
Blockheads, who never had an idea in their
life, became known as poets of celebrity. Misers, who
never gave anything but their names to a charity, were
lauded, in all corners of the land, as noble-hearted philanthropists.
Statesmen, whose rental or family connections
had alone given them a chance of power, were
credited with <i>bon mots</i> and sayings, which the seven
wise Greeks might have envied.</p>

<p>But it was all a branch of the great soul-dealing
system, and Ignatius Loyola Grey was unquestionably,
at the moment, <i>the</i> man of his age. Unfortunately for

<!-- page 226 -->

him the age was on its last legs&mdash;and those were uncommonly
black ones.</p>

<p>There was one good effect resulting from the soul-dealing
mania, which has been already hinted at. It led
people to think a little about their own spiritual natures.
Psychology became a fashionable study, and Metaphysics
and Ontology were consequently much more generally
patronised than of old. The sneerers at "philosophic
mysticism, and all that sort of thing," disappeared daily.
Academic retreats were founded. Neo-platonists had
their lectures and meetings at one hall&mdash;Epicureans at
another. The Pythagoreans, the Brahmins, the Confucians,
were well-known philosophical debating clubs.
Strange to say, Scepticism absolute was quite at a discount.
The general rage was for knowledge, and what
could be known by men who denied the existence of
knowledge? In short, the general tendency of the age
was decidedly towards intellectual development, at the
moment that moral principle was at the lowest ebb in
the country.</p>

<p>The cheap literature of the hour was marvellously
changed, since Mysteries of London, and similar ultra-romantic
productions, were the order of the day. An
edition of Berkeley, in penny numbers, Kant's "Critique
of Pure Reason," Hegel's "Logic" for the Million, and
a cheap volume of Spinoza, had a prodigious sale.
Swedenborg's visions were published in the "Parlour
Library of Instruction," and a new system of Anthropology
was continued through infinite numbers of the <i>Familiar
Herald,</i> by the Editor, who was strongly suspected of
some connection with the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Darian, Viridor, and their united band of democrats,

<!-- page 227 -->

watched every movement of the popular mind with
intense interest. They knew that a terrible explosion
was at hand, and prepared to ride upon the wave, which
could not fail to overwhelm their blinded and unteachable
antagonists.</p>

<p>Hollow murmurs of discontent already rolled sullenly
over the surface of the country. With the exception of
the great capitalists and landlords (a small band of huge
harpies, who sit at all England's feasts, and taint, by
their touch, the little remnants of the viands which they
leave us), every class of society was involved in the most
pitiful difficulty. There was no lack of enterprise or
labour, and an actual plethora of capital, and yet everybody
was embarrassed for money to meet his liabilities.
The truth was that a set of ministers, utterly unequal
to their solemn duties, had, from incapacity to understand,
and want of energy to investigate, the nature of
commerce, entirely neglected to make any provision for
an adequate circulating medium; without which, a
trading country cannot advance one step on the road of
improvement.</p>

<p>To understand the currency question, requires a certain
mathematical and philosophical genius. To discuss
it radically, in the present work, is impossible. I shall
therefore merely offer a few remarks, intelligible to a
child, and perhaps, therefore, to a Lord John Twaddle
and his followers.</p>

<p>In the first place, the inconvenience of everybody
being in debt to everybody, and the trouble and complication
introduced into trade by the utter impossibility
of any approximation to a direct system of exchange on
a cash basis, is too obvious to be disputed.</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>Secondly, nobody can for an instant deny the convenience
of an abundant paper currency, representing solid
capital; or that the only objection to its adoption, is the
danger of depreciation in value.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is well known that the example of the
French assignats (of which I have a dozen in my portfolio)
is the great historical argument against paper money.</p>

<p>Fourthly, it is perfectly clear that that objection is
utterly futile, applied to a country possessing institutions
and credit such as those of England, where no anarchical
or violent revolution is at all to be apprehended, unless
the monopolists of political power become much madder
than they are, which is an almost inconceivable prospect.</p>

<p>Fifthly, it is palpable that notes issued on the security
of land, and payable as taxes, government salaries, &amp;c.,
<i>cannot</i> sensibly depreciate, so long as the State itself do
not become bankrupt.</p>

<p>I leave these suggestions to the consideration of political
economists, bankers, merchants, and others, who
ought to understand the matter, and revert to the thread
of my narrative, with an apology for obtruding so dry a
subject on my lady readers.</p>

<p>The discontent of the working classes arose partly
from the difficulty of obtaining employment, owing
greatly to the above embarrassment of their employers;
partly to a strong sense of long-inflicted injustice in
depriving them of all voice in their own government,
oppressing them with a most unequal share of taxes, and
apathetically neglecting in legislation so many means of
ameliorating and elevating their condition. These, they
themselves began to discuss with a clearness, that proved
them well worthy of the franchise, they at length

<!-- page 229 -->

demanded, in a voice, not to be stifled by gagging bills,
suspended habeas corpus acts, or artificial temptations to
riot and treason, constables' staves, soldiers' bayonets, or
any other contemptible trickery of their rulers.</p>

<p>"Universal suffrage!" was their cry. "Mind before
matter! Reason above property! The rights of nature
above the usurped privileges of class! Let the same
justice annihilate the baron and the serf! Let us have
no hereditary sages or idiots&mdash;no more cant about a
stake in the country, when every man, with a soul to
suffer and enjoy, is equally interested in the prosperity of
his Fatherland! We are all peers before God! Let us
abolish all Indo-Egyptian tradition of caste! Let every
man count as a man, and let the best man be the man to
govern us!"</p>

<p>Such was the cry of the people, which caused the
House of Lords to tremble to its basis, and all Downing
Street to turn pale with terror.</p>

<p>But a new impulse was about to be given to the
movement.</p>

<p>The Grand Exposition of the Souls of all Nations
had been opened. Thousands had visited it,&mdash;thousands
had pondered in awe upon the irresistible conclusions
it suggested. A great moral shock was given
to the conscience of the age. Souls fell in the share-market,
and a circumstance which just then occurred
tended yet more strongly to arouse and stimulate the
general popular excitement.</p>

<p>Entering the House of Peers in his ducal robes, with
his coronet upon his head, Arthur Bolingbroke Darian,
called Duke of St. George, deliberately proclaimed his
resolution of renouncing for ever his title, his peerage,

<!-- page 230 -->

and all its privileges. Amid the dismayed looks of his
colleagues, he cast his coronet to the ground, trampled
upon it with contempt, and quitted the hall of legislators,
amid a silence more ominous than the most
stormy disapprobation.</p>

<p>The pale nobles looked at one another, like mariners
expectant of shipwreck; and cold drops of perspiration
oozed from beneath the wig of the chancellor. The
bishops were the first to recover themselves, and their
anathemas were truly episcopal in their ferocity.</p>

<p>The people literally roared with exultation at this
heroic initiation of their triumph; and the book of
Viridor, which appeared on the following day, conspired
to render the agitation yet more formidable to the
aristocratic and plutocratic councils.</p>

<p>Viridor's book? what was it?&mdash;I will tell you. It
was, to this present volume, what the sun is to a common
gas lamp. It said all that I have vainly striven to say;
its sale was measured by tens of thousands, and its
effects by&mdash;The Future.</p>

<p>So far is the ideal of the poet above the reality of the
writer.</p>

<p>At the same time the whole Soul-Exchange was revolutionised
by a placard posted on the base of Lord John
Twaddle's brazen statue in the centre&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">A NON-POLITICAL PARTY.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is rather tantalising, at the close of an entertainment,
to be introduced to a lovely girl one would
wish to see a great deal of. Nevertheless, reader, I
shall stand on no ceremony in introducing you, at this
late chapter of my story, to Genevra Darian, the beautiful
sister of the ex-ducal republican.</p>

<p>The day after Darian's resignation of his peerage,
and Viridor's publication of his book, this charming
lady issued invitations to about five hundred people for
a grand democratic f&ecirc;te, for which preparations of unusual
splendour were hinted at.</p>

<p>The eyes of all England, I might say Europe, were
fixed upon the leaders of the Fire-worshippers, whose
names were in everybody's mouth, and whose intentions
were the subject of almost universal discussion.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that the announcement
of Genevra's f&ecirc;te caused intense excitement
in every circle of the capital.</p>

<p>When the evening arrived the guests arrived also,
with a punctuality which curiosity alone could have
effected. Never before in ducal palace were assembled
so heterogeneous a company. It is true that, at first
glance, black coats, white linen, and shining boots, and
varied dresses of silk, satin, and muslin were visible,
much after the usual fashion. But on arriving at the

<!-- page 232 -->

grand suite of drawing-rooms, a transparency above the
portal caused every guest to pause for an instant in
admiration at the Dantesque inscription which its flaming
characters presented:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"YE WHO ENTER HERE LEAVE PREJUDICE BEHIND."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, necessary to do so; for whether your
next neighbour might be a marquis or a grocer, a man
of letters or a mechanic, it was impossible to guess.
Immense exertions had been made by Viridor, Darian,
and their friends, to collect worthy representatives of
every class, profession, trade, and calling in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Two or three brainless puppies of the "snob" genus,
guardsmen, barristers, and clerical prigs, having posted
themselves in a corner, amused their emptinesses by
quizzically guessing at the position of their neighbours.
Overhearing a venerable-looking old gentleman in
spectacles discoursing on electricity, with a young man
of remarkably graceful bearing, they set him down at
once as the Secretary of the Royal Society, when, in
fact, he was a respectable watchmaker from the city.
The young man they determined to be a "counter-jumper."
He proved to be the son of one of the oldest
baronets in the kingdom.</p>

<p>A young lady whose air they considered as proof conclusive
of high birth and breeding, turned out to be the
daughter of a tailor, and an old woman they condemned
as a vulgar cheesemonger's wife, proved a dowager
marchioness before the evening was over.</p>

<p>A youth, with long hair, who was unmistakeably a
painter, was found to be a medical student, and a prim-looking

<!-- page 233 -->

man, with a rather severe countenance, whom
they stigmatised as an attorney's clerk, was, in reality
an artist of considerable celebrity.</p>

<p>So varied were the elements of which Genevra's party
consisted!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, everywhere reigned politeness and hilarity.
The guests, whatever their station in life, felt bound
to do their best to be agreeable. All conversed freely
without introduction, and on every side were gay and
animated groups. Nor did the daughters of the people,
in their simple white muslin dresses, and flowers or ribbons
tastefully arranged, yield in beauty to the proud ladies
of the exclusive world, in their rustling satins and gaudy
jewellery. With few exceptions, the members of less
refined circles restrain their natural freedom to accord
with the manners of their so-called superiors; whilst the
latter adopted much of the unsophisticated ease which
soon ceased to displease them in their new associates.</p>

<p>If the fashionable girls were amused by the timid
admiration and exaggerated civility of their plebeian
partners, the fair daughters of the trader and the
mechanic were not the less disposed to smile at the <i>nonchalant</i>
affectation of the sublime dandies.</p>

<p>As for the older men, it was wonderful how pleasantly
they entered into conversation, with the most perfect
ignorance of whom they were talking to.</p>

<p>Basiline, who had discarded her masculine attire,
assisted Genevra to receive her motley guests, clad in a
plain white robe of studied simplicity. A single white
rose in her dark lustrous hair was her only ornament.</p>

<p>Genevra bore a great resemblance to Darian; also, in
some degree, to Basiline; but her hair was of a deep

<!-- page 234 -->

chesnut colour, and her eyes much darker than even her
brother's, or the Magyar's. Her form was perhaps a
shade too slender for classic outline, but her look and
smile were such as few could have resisted.</p>

<p>A little before supper, Viridor approached these two
flowers of beauty, who, surrounded by a circle of admirers,
were seated together on an ottoman in the
farthest <i>salon</i>, and presented to them an old gentleman
of deeply-interesting aspect. His brow was one of
singular expanse, and an appearance of severe ill-health
added greatly to the interest of his appearance.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" said Basiline, rising, and taking
Viridor's arm, whilst the old gentleman remained amid
the crowd in conversation with Genevra. "I am sure
that there is something strange in the history of your
friend, by his looks and manner; pray gratify my
woman's curiosity?"</p>

<p>"I am glad you condescend to own yourself a woman,
for the sake of my friend Darian," replied Viridor, gaily.
"As for the old man you have seen, his story is soon
told. Having been left an orphan at an early age, with
a small fortune, he devoted himself to the profoundest
study of the natural sciences, with a view solely to
making discoveries and inventions, calculated to benefit
mankind. He has spent his whole substance in experiments
and models; and has really contrived some
extraordinary machines for lessening human labour, and
performing operations hitherto tedious and expensive, in
the simplest and most economical manner. His great
idea is, that the world is to be regenerated by mechanical
contrivances, and chemical and electric agencies. For
more than twenty years of gross neglect, and too often

<!-- page 235 -->

grosser injustice, on the part of those, whose assistance
he claimed, he has struggled nobly to carry out, and
perfect his inventions. His unpublished treatises are of
a most valuable character, especially one entitled 'The
Philosophy of Motion,' which I have placed already in
the hands of a printer on my own hazard. Some of his
sanitary contrivances are especially suited for practical
adoption. Taken altogether, he is a man of genius,
and a representative spirit of his age. He may yet live
to achieve the most brilliant reputation."</p>

<p>It was the strange guest of Viridor's chambers, whose
history he thus briefly indicated. The misfortunes of
the stranger are not without parallels in the memory
of many of my readers.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a general move towards the
supper-room, which had been constructed temporarily in
the garden, to accommodate the whole company in the
most luxurious manner.</p>

<p>"I shall grow jealous if you have so many <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;tes</i>,"
said Darian, smiling, as he suddenly appeared before
Viridor and Basiline, and drew the arm of the latter
through his own, whilst he pressed her hand with lover-like
intelligence.</p>

<p>"I will soon relieve you of your doubts," rejoined
Viridor, with a mysterious significance, and disappearing
in the crowd, he returned in a few minutes with a young
creature, of such dream-like beauty, on his arm, that
both Darian and Basiline started in amazement. They
had, strangely enough for people of their penetrating
minds, given Viridor credit for utter absorption in his
political aims, and indifference to all the sweets of sexual
sympathy. They little dreamed that love was the only

<!-- page 236 -->

passion to which Viridor was capable of sacrificing&mdash;even&mdash;well,
it must be written, for I scorn to overrate
the virtues of my dearest friends&mdash;even his country.</p>

<p>Luckily, Grace demanded no such sacrifice.</p>

<p>"What an angelic countenance!" whispered Basiline
to Darian.</p>

<p>"How very, very beautiful she is!" said Grace Morton
to Viridor.</p>

<p>And they passed on to the supper-room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>THE STRIKE OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"Vox populi, vox Dei."</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>THE sun rose on the morrow of the Lady Genevra
Darian's party; it pursued its Westerly course,&mdash;it paused
in the zenith, and the whole City of Jugglers appeared
yet to sleep, so great was their amazement.</p>

<p><i>Not one morning paper had appeared</i>.</p>

<p>Had the world reached its final moment? Was the
trumpet of the resurrection about to sound?</p>

<p>The juggler citizens were seized by sudden qualms of
conscience. They deserted their places of business,&mdash;haunts
of pleasure,&mdash;or late breakfast tables, and hovered
anxiously about the offices of the absent journals. All
was dismay and confusion in those centres of intelligence.
To all its inquiries, the public received vague
and unsatisfactory replies, and looks of consternation
equal to their own. The life of the great city appeared
to stagnate,&mdash;its blood to cease flowing&mdash;its heart to
pulsate feebly, as a dying man's. What could this awful
silence mean? Where were the stinging, the indignant,
the thundering leaders?&mdash;where were the last night's
debates?&mdash;where were the "foreign correspondent's
articles," the "state of Europe," the "latest news from
France, by electric telegraph?" where even the account
of the Lady Genevra's party, which everybody was
eager to read?</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>All was silent. The <i>Timeserver</i>, the <i>Morning Ghost</i>,
the <i>Cobbler</i>, the <i>Humbug</i>, the <i>Staggerer</i>, even the <i>Daily
Nous</i> gave no signs of vitality.</p>

<p>The streets near their offices were crowded with
wondering citizens. With a dire presentiment of some
hideous catastrophe, they gazed in one another's pale
faces, and suggested that, after all, a journal, despite its
regal assumption of the <i>we</i>, and sustained semblance of
personal identity, was neither an animal, nor a machine.
They reflected that it must be printed by printers, and
edited by editors; that reporters must report, and translators
translate; and in fine, many real, living, two-legged
mammals, of the order <i>bimana</i>, <i>genus homo</i>, be
employed in its production.</p>

<p>Where, then, were these workmen of the hand and
head, and why was not their work done that day?</p>

<p>The compositors were there, and the pressmen, and
the printers' devils; but the writers, where were they?
Echo answered "where?"</p>

<p>At last the truth became known, and oozed out to
the public. The journalists of all grades, editors, subeditors,
compilers, financiers, reporters, and even penny-a-liners,
had broken out into open rebellion against
their tyrants.</p>

<p>THEY HAD STRUCK FOR FAME.</p>

<p>The capitalists, proprietors of the journals, were in
a state of fury and despair. Literature had asserted
its dignity. No literary man would be the puppet of a
stupider man than himself any longer. Either they
would sign their names to all they wrote, and write
their real convictions in all they signed, or&mdash;no more
"copy" from them for organs soon to become organs

<!-- page 239 -->

of public opinion, as they had hitherto been expressions
of private interests.</p>

<p>In vain the despairing capitalists offered increased
salaries, diminished labour, luxurious accommodations,
alternate relief from night-work, and whatever other
temptations they could devise&mdash;the journalists gave but
one answer;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our names to our articles, the position in society to
which our respective talents entitle us, the political independence
and influence which our reputation must
secure us. Keep your gold, squeeze more from our
brains, if it please you, but leave us our dignity as men.
We will be vague phantoms and blind instruments no
longer. We are sick of the masks we have worn so
long, we are sick of falling into old age and decrepitude
unknown and unhonoured. We are weary of seeing our
inferiors in the lighter walks of literature gain fame
and money by a few trifling efforts; whilst we, who
grapple daily with the toughest questions of the age,
may at any moment be cast aside like worn-out gloves,
by our masters; and in case of distress have not even
a claim upon that last of all resources to literary desperation."*</p>

<p class="small">[*The Literary Fund assists only the authors of books. To avoid
all misconstruction, I here take the liberty of stating, that deeply as
I sympathise with and honour journalism as the great lever of progress,
I never yet had any connection whatever with any newspaper.
Profoundly reflecting for many years on the nature of journalism, I
am now firmly persuaded that the anonymous system is utterly unworthy
of an age of enlightenment and honesty. What weight has
anonymous writing with any sensible person? None. It protects
falsehood, cowardice, and ignoble ideas; as for its protecting the
journalist, as a man, against personal attacks, if he write truth, he
requires no such protection. When, even as a boy, I wrote my burlesque
of the Young England folly, I gave my publisher strict orders
to give my name and address to all enquirers; and at the house of
Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; Gr&mdash;&mdash;n, the member for M&mdash;&mdash;r, I caused myself to be
pointed out to the Young England leader, that he might have every
opportunity of demanding satisfaction of any kind he pleased. I look
upon a blow as a barbarism, and a duel as insanity; but of all vices
cowardice is the meanest and most contemptible I can imagine. Sir
Edward Bulwer Lytton; in his "England and the English," long ago
denounced the anonymous system. I will never cease to denounce it,
whilst I can find a publisher, or pay a printer, to give my thoughts to
the public.]</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>It may readily be imagined that Darian and Viridor
were at the bottom of this glorious conspiracy of talent
against capital. It was at Genevra's party that the plot
had been thoroughly developed. Not a little had the
eloquent look of their hostess, and Basiline, and even
Grace, who had learned to impassion herself for all
Viridor's aims, contributed to decide the future representatives
of the people, in favour of the bold course
they adopted. Viridor proved to them how glorious
would be their position, if once they would assert their
individual dignity as thinkers; and Darian entreated
them to lay aside all pecuniary apprehensions; as he
was prepared to advance any sums, to start journals of
their own upon the new system, which might be
requisite.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the press, seeing suddenly opened before
them, a vista of honourable ambition, which led to
the highest offices in the state, parted in high spirits
from their entertainers, at an early hour, in a large
number of vehicles, expressly provided, for Richmond.
There, giving themselves up to festivity, they awaited,
in passive strength, the submission of their quondam
masters.</p>

<p>The <i>Timeserver</i> alone, by its immensely extended resources,
contrived to replace the whole of its staff, in

<!-- page 241 -->

time to appear on the morning following the catastrophe.</p>

<p>All the other journals were revolutionized, and, what
was most extraordinary, turned out to be all advocates
of the liberal interest, so soon as the writers, by appending
their signatures, became impressed with the
solemn responsibility of their duties to their fellow
men.</p>

<p>But it was not long before Viridor and Darian started,
themselves, a new journal, to which almost every author
of talent and celebrity contributed, and before which
even the sale of the leviathan <i>Timeserver</i> began gradually
to diminish.</p>

<p>It was evident now, that the great political battle was
to be fought between the House of Commons and the
Press; it was also a matter of easy prophecy, that the
Press would soon be the victor in the struggle. For the
Press was the voice and parliament of the whole people,
and the House of Commons was but the complot of a fractional
part of the community, to retain all power in their
own hands.</p>

<p>The Press, too, was becoming daily more united, whilst
the Commons became hourly more divided&mdash;and a house
divided against itself cannot stand; neither can Satan;
and what is the peerage but a satanic delusion, soon to
be dissipated by the breath of liberty and reason?</p>

<p>Lord John Twaddle now shuddered at the very names
of Darian and Viridor; the sight of Cordian, Viziers, or
Might, the free-traders, and the manly tone of their
voices, made his heart turn sick with despair. Robert
the Devil had withdrawn into retirement and inactivity.
Ben Sidonia rose only to give a semblance of existence

<!-- page 242 -->

to his disheartened and expiring party. At length,
Twaddle, overwhelmed by the terror and embarrassment
of an agitation, which he could neither crush by brute
force, nor restrain by any devices of his intellect, fell
suddenly sick, even to political death, and to the astonishment
of the country, resigned office, and accepted the
Chiltern Hundreds, although actually in possession of a
clear majority of seven!!</p>

<p>A Whig resign office with a majority! it was enough
to revive the popular faith in miracles, and sink Hume's
essay to perdition!</p>

<p>King John having abdicated, who was to succeed him?
There was a stormy interregnum of a whole month,
during which time everything went on as usual, and a
fresh election for the City of Jugglers took place.</p>

<p>Viridor was the democratic candidate. He was opposed
by uncounted gold, and some human pretence to senatorial
honors, whose name has escaped me. The struggle
was hot and close. Every voice was raised in favour of
Viridor; but, thanks to our Landocracy's repudiation of
the ballot, for all purposes but their own club elections,
every five-pound note was in favour of the Plutocrat.
Nevertheless, there was a spirit walking the streets of
the great city which whispered to the hearts and consciences
of men as it passed, that the days of soul-dealing
were passing away; and that Truth and Justice were,
after all, the interest of rich as well as poor. Viridor
was elected&mdash;elected by a majority of nine, the number
of the muses.</p>

<p>Not a single bribe had been given by his friends, on any
pretence, or under any disguise. All he had done was to
print an address, which was distributed to every elector.</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>His speech on the hustings concluded with these
pointed words&mdash;</p>

<p>"My countrymen! I thank you for the trust you place
in my charge. I hope few months will elapse before I
shall again appeal to your support, when no limited constituency,
no household extension of suffrage, no pitiful
half measure of justice, in any way, will prevent <i>any</i> one
of the thousands I now see before me from exercising his
natural rights as a man, a thinker, and a citizen! Your
election makes me the representative of a class, my own
principles make me a representative of the whole
people!"</p>

<p>Then burst from the panting crowd, upon whose
hearts the words of Viridor descended like drops of
liquid fire, one mighty, heartspoken shout for equal
rights as men, which swelled and swelled upon the air,
until even at Westminster, its magnetic shock caused
trees to wave, and the souls of oligarchs to tremble.</p>

<p>The people asked for justice. Woe to the foolish
crew that yet delayed their answer! Will history teach
nothing to such men? It taught no wisdom to Louis
Philippe, none to Guizot. Are the Twaddles, and the
Chicory* Woodenheads, and the Grubs, and their
adherents, more obstinate than Louis, more ignorant
than Guizot?</p>

<p class="small">[*A Chancellor of the Exchequer, who advocates the fraudulent
adulteration of coffee with a vile and noxious root called chicory.]</p>

<p>The sequel will teach us.</p>

<div class="center" id="cjb3ch04">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE PANIC&mdash;THE BEGINNING OF THE END.</p>

</div>

<p>LIKE thoughts of vengeance upon the soul of an exiled
patriot, night descended upon the great City of Jugglers.
A sea of men rushed, and surged, and recoiled, in
the principal thoroughfares of the capital. Hoarse cries,
sombre rumblings, and murmurings of the agitated
crowd fell with dreadful distinctness upon the assembled
senators at St. Stephen's. It was known that the military
were all under arms, but the moral sentiment was
wanting to the hearts of the fragmentary, and, as it
were, provisional ministry. Their courage was at zero,
their energies were paralysed, and all their words
and counsels indicated deplorable weakness and indecision.</p>

<p>"The Franchise for ever!" shouted the mob, and the
greater number of the middle classes joined, either
openly or secretly, in the cry. It seemed as if all London
had descended into the streets. Every effort of the
police was utterly ineffectual. It was no Kennington-common
meeting, but a unanimous rising of the working
classes&mdash;a demonstration of their strength, and an
assertion of their rights. All the youth of the metropolis
joined enthusiastically in the cry&mdash;every voteless
lodger, whatever his station in life, involuntarily sympathised
in the movement.</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>It was proposed to order the military to charge the
populace; many members of the House of Commons,
which had become, in the extremity of the supposed
danger, the centre of executive as well as administrative
power, supported the proposition.</p>

<p>Viridor rose from the seat he had just taken amid the
few Fire-worshippers in the assembly. "If you shed
blood&mdash;only one drop of blood&mdash;this night," he said
solemnly, "your lives are not worth three hours' purchase.
The people are in earnest. It is no partial
rising. A single musket fired is the signal of a terrific
conflict, of a civil war from one end of the country to
the other. Rather let us mount horse ourselves, and
sally forth to harangue the people. I will give notice
of a bill for extension of suffrage to all adults tomorrow;
to-night we must give the people hope&mdash;or
await the crisis of their despair."</p>

<p>At such moments the strongest mind invariably takes
the lead. The hated Viridor's advice was immediately
acted upon. That a word from him or Darian would
decide the conduct of the people, no one for an instant
doubted. In reality, the two theoretical Republicans
had as little control over the outbreak and its leaders as
any of their colleagues; but their names were all-powerful
at the moment.</p>

<p>Accordingly Viridor and Darian, who was in the
gallery of the House at the time, mounted two horses,
which they procured with difficulty, and alternately addressing
the crowd, by degrees made their way down
Parliament Street, and along the Strand, until a vivid
brightness, reflected on the eastern sky, announced that
some building had been fired by the rioters.</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>The same prophetic thought struck both Darian and
Viridor at the same moment.</p>

<p>"It is the Timeserver office!" exclaimed the latter.</p>

<p>"I fear so," replied Darian, "But see, what is that?
They are dragging a man along with some ferocious intent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Away with the rascally Soul Agent," cried the surrounding
mob, and Viridor, dashing forwards, beheld, by
the gleam of a lamp, the livid features of Ignatius, who,
with torn garments, and a rope about his neck, was,
doubtless, on the verge of expiating his moral iniquities
by a summary condemnation and execution at the hands
of the people he had despised and degraded.</p>

<p>Viridor seized the Soul Agent by the arm, and, by an
almost superhuman exertion of strength, released him
from the hands of the two men who held him. Then
Darian, having dismounted from his horse, half dragged,
half carried the exhausted and terrified Ignatius through
the crowd, to an adjoining tavern. His gigantic stature
and great bodily vigour enabled him to effect this object
by a prodigious effort, whilst Viridor appealed to all the
better feelings of the people, and entreated them to
communicate to their friends the immediate prospect of
a legal recognition of their rights, and, at length, by
a happy and audacious suggestion, was the means of
restoring, tranquillity, and averting the threatening
tempest.</p>

<p>"Let us form ourselves," he cried, "into a human
telegraph, and immediately transmit the good news to
the whole body of the patriots. My name is Bernard
Viridor, my friend is Arthur Darian; we pledge ourselves
that justice shall be done you if you will refrain

<!-- page 247 -->

from all brutal violence, unworthy of your sacred
cause."</p>

<p>The people hailed the suggestion with acclamations;
and as their immediate objects were indefinite, and their
leaders undecided, soon began to disperse, and seek their
homes and suppers. A shower of rain accelerated this
movement, and thus the danger of an insurrection was,
for the moment, removed.</p>

<p>But Robert Russel Brown, the stout partner of the
dark speculator, who stood in the shadow of the
Duke's statue in our first chapter (like many things
as mean that flourish in the shadow of military power),
had the misfortune to be hanged from a lamp-post on
Blackfriars Bridge, where he was found in the morning
by the police, who cut him down, and carried him to
the nearest station-house.</p>

<p>We must now pass rapidly over the few events yet to
be recorded in these pages. The day arrived for the
third reading of Viridor's bill. It was carried in defiance
of the most violent opposition. It had fifty thousand
supporters outside, whose choral eloquence did much for
its success.</p>

<p>The franchise was extended to every male in the kingdom
having attained the age of twenty-one years. A
dissolution of parliament was expected. The people
were in ecstacies of triumph. Viridor was sent for by
the Queen. He declined office. Malignant rumour said
that he was too stern a republican to serve a monarch&mdash;in
his eyes an extravagant superfluity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the panic in the Soul Market had reached
its climax. The devil himself would not have bought
souls at so grievous a discount. The Soul Exchange was

<!-- page 248 -->

shut up, and the beadle was its only tenant. The Exeter
Arcade was not more desolate.</p>

<p>Ignatius had migrated to America, with a view to
slave-dealing. He could not make up his mind to relinquish
his old trade. The tribe of <i>Nut</i>&mdash;to quote Hindostanee
from the "Wanderings of a Pilgrim," a recent
work on India, by a lady of remarkable talent&mdash;the race
of high-caste jugglers had lost the brightest star of their
benighted firmament. Peace be to his victims!</p>

<p>Darian and Basiline were married.</p>

<p>"We have won the prize!" said Darian; "we have a
right to happiness,&mdash;let us have not one, but twelve
honeymoons, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is an Austrian empire to destroy!" said the
beautiful Hungarian, sudden fire lighting up the languishing
eyes, with which she gazed upon her husband,
as their carriage, drawn by snorting steeds of iron, was
borne swiftly away from the great City of Jugglers.</p>

<p>The same night, Viridor returned home to his chambers,
after sharing the festivities at Darian's palace. He
had no dread of intruders now; for he had had a new
patent lock put upon his door, in case his second self-installed
guest should chance to be of a less eligible
character than the first. And yet, strange and unaccountable
spectacle! the first thing he beheld on entering
his sitting-room was Grace Morton, seated in his arm-chair,
her head thrown back, her fair face pale as a
marble portrait, her lips slightly parted, her arms pendant
at her sides, her bosom heaving occasionally with deep
sighs, as in a dream of passionate sorrow. She slept.
Viridor approached her, and moved the candle which
was burning upon the table, in such a manner as to

relieve her eyelids from its glare. A sense of remorse
came over him. For three days he had not seen Grace;
he had forgotten her existence, or postponed all thoughts
of love, to the overwhelming pressure of political activity.
How many audiences had he given&mdash;how many
visits had he received&mdash;how many letters had he written&mdash;what
stirring articles had he composed, in that brief
interval!</p>

<p>But what cared Grace for politics! Like an exquisite
flower, she had taken root on one spot, and that spot was
Viridor's heart. Not hearing from him, she had called
again and again at his chambers, without finding him at
home. At length, that evening she found the door open.
Viridor had failed to turn the key, going out hastily
that morning.</p>

<p>There she had waited, hour after hour, a prey to the
bitterest anxiety. At length, utterly exhausted by the
tumult of her feelings, she had fallen asleep, as described,
in the great arm-chair, with the candle, which she had
found means to light, burning on the table.</p>

<p>Never had she appeared so beautiful to Viridor, as at
that moment. He felt quite a criminal, for causing her
so much pain, as he now well divined. He took her
hand and pressed it in his own. She woke, and gazed
upon him, at first, as in a dream. Then suddenly becoming
conscious of his presence, she murmured in a
tone of gentle reproach, that brought tears in the eyes
of the repentant poet&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, Bernard, Bernard! had you <i>quite</i> forgotten
me?"</p>

<p>"My own dearest girl! my sweet, beautiful Grace!
Never, by all my eternal hopes I swear it, never did I

truly love woman until I saw you! Oh! let us part no
more in life, my adored, my eternal bride!"</p>

<p>And Viridor, kneeling by the side of Grace, kissed
the taper fingers of her small white hands.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the history I have hoped
would find some few kindred souls to sympathise with
its mysteries. The beginning, did I say? Yes, the
beginning, indeed; however contradictory may seem
the conventional necessity which compels me, at the
same moment, to acknowledge with regret that it is</p>
