<h2>THE PRICE OF SILENCE</h2>

<p>I</p>

<p class="small">PROLOGUE: A DOMICILIARY VISIT</p>

</div>

<p>THE narrow streets of the French Quarter
resembled canals; the rain, descending from
a sky which half an hour earlier had been as innocently
blue as a baby's eyes, rolled in smoky
waves down pointed roofs and spouted from projecting
gutters; the slender arcs on either side
interlaced in mid-air to plunge, a frothing column,
into the rising flood below. Canal Street
was for the moment a wide lagoon; the thoroughfares
beyond sent up a reek of mud and ooze to
meet the deluge. In the Garden District, magnolia
and rose-bush cast upon miniature seas a
vain sacrifice of snow-white and rose-red. The
innumerable Confederate flags, which everywhere
lent a bright touch of color to a background of
brick and stucco, drooped, washed-out and lifeless,
from staff, window-sill, and balcony. The

<!-- page 2 -->

few vehicles abroad stood impotent, or moved
doubtfully, their teams belly-deep in water. There
were no women visible, and but few men, and
there was a strange unearthly hush about, unaccounted
for by the rain,&mdash;for when has one of
their birthright waterspouts kept New Orleans
folk, men or women, indoors, or quenched the
lightsomeness of soul which is theirs, also by
inheritance? But now? Yesterday, the flash
of gray uniforms uptown and down,&mdash;zouave,
<i>chasseur &agrave; pied</i>, home-guard, regular,&mdash;the
dancing jingle of cavalry, the steady tramp of
infantry, clatter of artillery; the hurrying in and
the speeding forth of couriers; the sharp challenge
of sentry and guard; the glitter of sword-hilt
and bayonet; the blare of trumpets; the gay
red-and-white of "Confederate" flowers on bonnet
or parasol of <i>grande dame</i> and <i>bourgeoise;</i>
song, badinage, laughter! Cheers for the forts
down yonder guarding the gateway of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>To-day, empty streets, closed doors, silence,
terror, despair.</p>

<p>In truth a wet day and a dreary, that 25th of
April, eighteen hundred and sixty-two. "Oh,

<!-- page 3 -->

but of a wetness to drown the devil!" cries Madame
de Laussan, telling the ancient tale once
and again, "and of a melancholy, <i>mon Dieu!</i>"
Madame's aristocratic old hands tremble upon the
arms of her high-backed chair; her bright old
eyes cloud and droop.</p>

<p>Across the rain-squall, that long-gone day, inborne
townward from the levee in fitful whiffs,
came odd, intermingled odors,&mdash;pungent, oily,
candied, resinous: the smell of burning sugar,
rice, molasses, cotton, tarred timber,&mdash;an echo,
as it were, of that vast holocaust which for twenty-four
hours had lighted the river front. "They
may eat us if they will, those Yankees,&mdash;may
our bones choke them!&mdash;but not a grain of
sugar, neither rice; not a rind of bacon shall
the monsters find. Not a flake of cotton, not
a gunboat; not even so much as a pirogue for
the spying out of our bayous. Burn! Burn!
Burn!" And even while the bell in old Christ
Church belfry spelled out into the air the preconcerted
warning that the forts at the river mouth
had fallen and Farragut was well on his way toward
the city with his fleet, frenzied hands had
heaped upon the levee the priceless contents of

<!-- page 4 -->

sugar-warehouse and cotton-shed, storehouse and
<i>magasin</i>, and set torch to barrel, hogshead, and
bale. By the light of these leaping flames, gunboats,
cutters, steamboats, flatboats, canoes were
fired. Even now, as the pelting rain trampled
a last spurt of smoke from the ashes, the Confederate
States gunboat, the Mississippi, swept
majestically down the stream, a towering wraith
of flame, to meet the Federal fleet dawning into
view around Slaughterhouse Bend, stately, sinister,
terrible.</p>

<p>The great mob on the levee fell silent. Small
wonder, by the way, that the streets of the city
were deserted! Here were the men,&mdash;for the
most part old men and boys; vigorous manhood
had long ago followed the call of trumpet
and drum to the front. They stared&mdash;motionless,
like men turned to stone&mdash;at the approaching
ships. Suddenly an unearthly, shuddering
groan rent the air. It came from the Confederate
cutter Washington, lying off the wharf.
She turned heavily on her side, quivered as if
racked by some internal convulsion, reared,
dripping, groaned a second time, and plunged
headlong into the yellow flood. The downward-sucking

<!-- page 5 -->

waters closed swirling over her masts.
To many a graybeard there this portent of evil
brought the chill of impending ruin; it broke
for all the spell of numb silence. They surged,
swaying and jostling, with upturned arms and
clenched fists, to the edge of the levee, and
burst into a prolonged howl of rage,&mdash;hoarse,
primitive, like the bellow of some titanic animal.
The grim gunners on Farragut's flagship, the
Hartford, looked over, as she swung to her
moorings, into a sea of livid faces, glaring eyeballs
which spat flames, open mouths which
vomited curses, trembling chins which wagged
impotent imprecations.</p>

<p>The women, huddled behind closed doors in the
French Quarter, in the Garden District, in all the
length and breadth of the town, heard the echo
of that first anguished, helpless roar; then a
fierce, exultant cry which was shouted from quarter
to quarter, from street to street, from door
to door, until the crescent vibrated from horn
to horn with its triumph: "Bless Gawd!
Moses has fetched his people th'oo. Freedom!
Freedom! De Yankees is come!" And the listeners,
pale and tearless, behind closed doors,

<!-- page 6 -->

fell on their knees, and clasped their little
daughters to their breasts, and prayed.</p>

<p>The rain ceased; the sun shone out with
mocking brilliancy.</p>

<br/>

<p>A fortnight later the old Town by the River,
the scene of so many and such romantic episodes
in times past, was once more gay with flags.
Again there were flash of uniform and glitter of
sword-hilt on boulevard and banquette. The terse
challenge of sentry and guard was setting loose
the echoes in ancient courtyards and mysterious
corridors; couriers dashed back and forth; the
steady tread of marching feet resounded. But
the flags which blossomed upon flagstaff and
balcony, and here and there stretched&mdash;for
reasons of state!&mdash;sheer across the streets, were
the stars and stripes; the red-and-white of the
Southern Confederacy was forbidden even to the
bonnet and the parasol of great lady and market-woman.
The uniforms where gray had been were
blue; and in lieu of the happy-go-lucky strains
of "Dixie Land," the more conventional notes of
"The Star Spangled Banner" smote upon ears
which grew red with indignation at the sound.

<!-- page 7 -->

Butler's Reign of Terror had begun; already his
infamous sobriquet was in whispered circulation.
The "Yankees" lounged and clanked, after the
manner of soldiers, about the barracks vacated by
their "rebel" foes. The Provost Marshal had
already begun those domiciliary visits whose memory
lingers unpleasantly still in many a household
in New Orleans. Already the "Yankee"
flag was so hung here and there that the women
might not, by stepping into the street, avoid
passing beneath its hated folds. Already houses
were being confiscated, and their owners, men and
women alike, sent into exile, or, if recalcitrant,
into prison. Already the freed slaves, insolently
lording it, when possible, over their former masters
and mistresses, were adding to the confusion
and disorder which seethed beneath the hard surface
of martial law.</p>

<p>But of these last many remained loyal to their
"white folks," maintaining their loyalty in the
snarling teeth of their own race and amid the jeers
of their liberators. One such, a mulatto woman
about twenty-five years of age, passed swiftly up
Canal Street from the Custom House one morning
early in the May following the arrival of the

<!-- page 8 -->

Federal fleet, and turned into Rue Royale. She
threw furtive looks over her shoulder as she
walked, and paid no heed to the ribald compliments
and unseemly jests of the soldiers idling
along the banquette. She paused at length before
an immense batten door below Toulouse Street,
stood for a moment breathless in its embrasure,
then pulled the bell once and again, allowing a
short interval to elapse between the two rings.
The faint tinkling within had not fully ceased
when, darting a hasty look up and down the
street, she unlocked the gate with a key drawn
from her bosom, opened it, and stepped in, closing
the green valve behind her.</p>

<p>The sharp sound of the gate-bell jarred the
tense silence which pervaded the library of the
de Laussan mansion. Madame de Laussan, standing
by the massive library table supporting herself
with a hand grasping its edge, listened anxiously
for the prearranged second ring, and for
the opening and shutting of the street door;
then turned, with a look of relief on her pale
face, to her son. Pierre de Laussan, a lad of sixteen,
stood facing his mother, his young brow as
pale, his lips as firmly set, as her own.</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>They were strikingly alike, Madame de Laussan
and her son, her only child. She looked, in
the bloom of her beauty, scarce older than the
lad; she was, indeed, a little more than double
his age. There were the same dark eyes beneath
straight black eyebrows, the same proud mouth
and rounded though determined chin, the same
white, even teeth and flashing smile, the same
black uncurling hair&mdash;only Pierre's thick locks
were cut close to his shapely head. The braids
which crowned the mother's brow were marvelously
thick and heavy; the locks fell, when
unbound, to her feet. (At this writing, though
Madame is hard upon eighty, her long and
abundant tresses, silver-white, are the wonder
and admiration of the <i>Vieux Carr&eacute;</i>.)</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan resumed her admonition.
She spoke with an effort; the hand grasping
the edge of the table shook. "My son," she continued,
"I can no longer withhold my consent.
I give you, as I have already given your father,
to the Southern Confederacy. You will, young as
you are, show yourself the true son of that brave
father; you will prove yourself worthy of the
high name you bear and of the gallant men who

<!-- page 10 -->

have borne it before you; you will&mdash;Oh, Pierre,
my boy, my boy!" The mother welling up from
the depths of an agonized heart effaced the patriot.
"How can I send you away from me! How&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother!" What the lad would have said
remained unspoken. The mulattress burst into
the room, hurling herself forward, and dropped,
panting, at the feet of Madame de Laussan.</p>

<p>"Little mistress!" she gasped in a sharp
whisper, "they&mdash;are&mdash;coming&mdash;the Provost
Guard&mdash;to search the house&mdash;for Master&mdash;Pierre!"</p>

<p>She spoke, like the others, in French, though
with a curiously soft, slurring accent.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Sir&egrave;ne&mdash;" stammered her mistress,
throwing a terrified glance toward the door.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Pierre
sternly, stooping to seize the woman's wrist
with an accusing hand.</p>

<p>"Hush, Pierre," interrupted his mother, assisting
the freedwoman gently to her feet. "I
would stake my life on Sir&egrave;ne's fidelity."</p>

<p>Sir&egrave;ne lifted grateful eyes to the speaker.</p>

<p>"Listen, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse," she implored; "there
is not one moment to lose. They are coming&mdash;the

<!-- page 11 -->

guard&mdash;on the instant. It is Hercule who
has sent me to tell you; Hercule, who is himself
a guide to that guard&mdash;the traitor. They will
search the house, Hercule says; they will take
Master Pierre away to&mdash;to prison&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Pierre!</i>" Madame de Laussan sprang forward
to strain her son convulsively to her
bosom; then she thrust him frantically from
her. "Go, go, my son. No, oh, no, stay!
Escape is impossible. Better prison than to be
shot in the attempt to fly these bloodthirsty
monsters. Remain here at my side. I command
you!"</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother!" He soothed her with
a caressing hand. "I shall get away, and safely,
never fear. And when you next hear from me,"
he added with boyish exultation, "I shall be in
the ranks, a Confederate soldier, like my father."
He threw himself a last time into her arms,
touched Sir&egrave;ne's shoulder with an affectionate
palm, and turned toward the door. But he
darted back to snatch from its place above the
mantel a sword whose jeweled hilt sparkled in
the sunlight falling upon it from the open
window.</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>"I am going to hide this," he declared. "I
cannot take it away with me, but whatever else
they may lay their hands upon, they shall not
defile with so much as a touch this sword."</p>

<p>His mother's terrified whisper of warning sent
him flying from the room. The heavy porti&egrave;re
as he lifted it revealed a stately hall beyond, with
thickly carpeted stairway upon which his hurried
feet left no trace, and which gave back no echo.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan bounded back to her
place, and laid her hand for support once more
on the table. She motioned the mulattress to
approach. "You must not be seen here&mdash;with
me, Sir&egrave;ne," she whispered. "You will be suspected
of&mdash;disloyalty to your&mdash;deliverers. Save
yourself, dear Sir&egrave;ne, and may the Holy Virgin
smile upon you for what you have done this day
for my boy. Tried to do." She corrected herself
with pale lips. Sir&egrave;ne stooped to lift the
hem of her mistress's gown to her lips, and
stepped without a word a little to the rear, where
she stood with arms folded across her breast, her
fine face impassive below the brightly colored
<i>tignon</i>, her dark eyes filled with smouldering
flames.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>To the loud, imperative hammering on the
batten gate below had succeeded a crash, as of
a breaking lock, and a rush of heavy feet along
the flagged porte coch&egrave;re. Now a steady tramp
echoed on the winding stair without. A moment
later, Lieutenant Sidney Cortland, U. S. A., entered
the library in a sort of angry haste. He
was followed immediately by a squad of United
States soldiers. Hercule, the guide, a huge muscular
griffe,&mdash;ten days earlier the body-servant of
Pierre de Laussan,&mdash;stepped in after them. He
threw an indifferent glance around, and stood
impassive as Sir&egrave;ne herself.</p>

<p>At sight of the beautiful, pale women confronting
him, Cortland, a fair, florid young man with
pale-blue, unsteady eyes and a handsome, weak
mouth, paused involuntarily and removed his hat.
His men stared boldly and insolently at mistress
and maid.</p>

<p>"Madame de Laussan?" queried the officer,
consulting the slip of paper which he drew from
his belt.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan inclined her head haughtily.</p>

<p>"&mdash;the wife of Nemours de Laussan&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"The wife of Colonel Nemours de Laussan of
the Confederate States Army, in command of
the &mdash;th Louisiana regiment of infantry." She
spoke in a clear, ringing voice, and in English
of unusual purity.</p>

<p>Cortland reddened, but dropped his eyes to
the paper and continued: "You have a son&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pierre Nemours de Laussan, yes, monsieur.
On his way at this moment to enter the Confederate
States Army," interrupted Madame de Laussan.
Her dark, flashing eyes were full upon her
inquisitor; but between him and her there seemed
to float a slim figure, with sword uplifted, bared
head up-thrown, the young face flushed with
enthusiasm. Her ears were strained toward the
hall, the stairway, the upper chambers. She did
not even see, as Sir&egrave;ne, alert behind her bronze
mask, saw, the crafty guide&mdash;late the valet of
Pierre de Laussan&mdash;glide stealthily along the
wall and disappear behind the heavy folds of the
porti&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," growled the sergeant of the
guard half under his breath. "The young spy
is somewhere about this house. Our own spies
have been at his heels for a week. He's in this

<!-- page 15 -->

house!" His fox-like eyes subtly threatened his
superior officer as he spoke. Cortland winced.</p>

<p>"I regret to say, madam," he stammered,
"that we shall have to search the house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell!" muttered the sergeant, grinning
openly. "Are we the Provost Guard, or are we
French dancing-masters?"</p>

<p>"Pierre de Laussan is accused of furnishing
treasonable information to the enemy. Also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may spare yourself&mdash;and me&mdash;the details
of the work of your spies," said Madame
de Laussan disdainfully; "they do not interest
me. As for the search, I am at once a woman
and defenseless, while you, a Yankee officer,
have the assistance of these&mdash;gentlemen."</p>

<p>She swept to the floor in an ironical curtsy,
her contemptuous glance embracing Cortland and
his men.</p>

<p>Stung to the quick, Cortland wheeled about
and gave the necessary orders to his soldiers in
a curt voice whose echoes rang strangely through
the silent house. He himself led the way, lifting
the porti&egrave;re as Pierre had done half an hour
earlier.</p>

<p>Neither mistress nor maid stirred from her

<!-- page 16 -->

place when the squad had filed out, leaving two
of their number on guard. These seated themselves
familiarly in the great armchairs on either
side of the fireplace, and enlivened the tedium
of their waiting with the coarse laughter and the
coarser jests of the guardroom. Madame de
Laussan stood rigid, outwardly calm, absolutely
heedless of allusions which grew more and
more unfit for the ears, happily deaf to all
outer sound, as the great, anguished eyes were
blind to all outer vision. Later, there surged into
her memory, as if from some half-forgotten dream,
the face of the griffe, Hercule. Was there meaning
in the rapid glance he threw her as he slipped
from behind the porti&egrave;re and mounted the stair in
the wake of the intruders?</p>

<p>A burst of strident laughter presently awoke
the little Mathilde, niece and adoptive daughter
of Madame de Laussan. The two-year-old child,
who had slept peacefully thus far through the
unwonted confusion, screamed loudly. Sir&egrave;ne
flew to her nursling, lifted her from the sofa
where she was lying, soothed her into quiet with
tender, inarticulate murmurings, and then resumed
her post beside her mistress.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>The house, after the Provost Guard had
finally departed laden with plunder, presented a
scene of wild confusion: the contents of armoires
and cabinets were flung about; drawers
and closets, rifled of their treasures, remained
open; fragments of crystal and china strewed
the floor of the dining-room; buffets were stripped
of ancestral silver. Madame de Laussan surveyed
the wreck with shining eyes; her hands were
clasped in an ecstasy of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, Sir&egrave;ne," she cried. "My Pierre,
thanks to Hercule, is safe, somewhere, somehow.
You are unharmed. What matters the rest!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless a troubled frown furrowed her
white brow when, order somewhat restored, looking
over the scattered d&eacute;bris from her private
desk, she noted the absence of a certain small
casket. It had been appropriated, doubtless,
for its own odd beauty, since it contained
nothing of great intrinsic value,&mdash;two or three
family rings only, an ornament or two, and a
single letter. Madame de Laussan made, through
Union friends, futile efforts to recover the box;
she employed Hercule, the crafty, to find if possible
its present possessor, and to bargain for its

<!-- page 18 -->

return. But it had disappeared, with other articles
of more value. The de Laussan diamonds,
famed for their splendor and magnificence, safe
in their hiding-place, had fortunately escaped the
greedy eyes of the guard.</p>

<p>Pierre's first letter, smuggled in, came a
month later. It related the story of the writer's
escape&mdash;by the aid of Hercule&mdash;over the
roofs into the house of a non-suspect; afterward
through the lines into the Confederacy; it
told in buoyant strain of his enlistment in his
father's command, and of the stirring scenes
which were enacting about him. The brief postscript
ran: "The Lafayette sword is in a safe
hiding-place there at home. We will hang it
upon the wall again, you and I, mother, when
the war is over, and Johnny comes marching
home."</p>

<p>There came no second letter from the young
volunteer; he fell, shot through the head, in a
nameless skirmish less than a month after
Madame de Laussan pressed to her lips the
faded wayside flower enclosed in the first letter.
Colonel de Laussan died in hospital of wounds
received in battle in the spring of 1863. Father

<!-- page 19 -->

and son, their sacred dust brought back after
the war to their native state, sleep side by side
in the stately tomb of the <i>famille de Laussan</i>,
in the old St. Louis Cemetery at New Orleans.</p>

<hr/>

<p>II</p>

<p class="small">MATIN</p>

</div>

<p>A HUGE spider, bloated, venomous, swung
slowly earthward,&mdash;from nowhere, apparently,
for only the frail tip of a twig on the
cr&ecirc;pe myrtle interposed between him and upper
aerial space. He paid out jerkily the silver rope
by which he descended. His furry body brushed,
in passing, the back of No&eacute;mie's hand; his upcurled
legs instantly shot out; they effected a
foothold a second later on her knee, whence he
began to mount, high-stepping, along her white
skirts. She shook him off with a shriek of girlish
terror, and looked on breathless while the negro
gardener pursued the fleeing monster across the
flags and crushed him with a heavy foot.</p>

<p>"<i>Matin: chagrin</i>," she chanted, picking up
the garden-shears which she had let fall in her
fright, and snipping bud and blossom into the
open basket on her arm. "<i>Matin: chagrin.
Midi: ennui. Le soir: espoir.</i>"</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>"What do dat mean, you is singin', Miss
No-<i>mee?</i>" queried the old negro, leaning on his
spade to listen. "Seem-lak I useter hear dat
song, in de time&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl brightened. "Maybe you heard my
mother sing it, Uncle Mink. <i>Dans le temps</i>,"
she returned. "Sir&egrave;ne taught it to me. Sir&egrave;ne
was also my mother's <i>bonne</i>. It is <i>l'augure de
l'araign&eacute;e</i>,&mdash;the presage of the spider. In English
it would go something like this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"<i>Spider in the morning: Of trouble the warning.<br/>

Spider at noon: Satiety soon.<br/>

Spider at eve: Hope and believe.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Lawd, honey, you certing has got it pintedly
down!" admired Uncle Mink. " 'Tain't edzackly
cunjer&mdash;dat spider-song; but it's sompin' <i>lak</i>
cunjer. Spiders," he added thoughtfully, "is
gener-ally <i>in</i> cunjerin'."</p>

<p>The courtyard of the de Laussan mansion was
filled with the soft glow of a sunny November
morning. The tall bananas shading the fountain-pool
set the rustle of their fringed leaves to
a light breeze which blew up from the river and
whiffled down the porte coch&egrave;re, whose batten
gate stood open to the street. There were cones

<!-- page 22 -->

of white bells here and there among the Spanish
daggers which leaned out at all angles from the
foot of the north wall; a cr&ecirc;pe myrtle, on the
high bricked-up bed against the south wall held
aloft belated tufts of rosy bloom; the slim,
naked trunk slanted silver-gray against a background
of moss-patched stucco.</p>

<p>"It reminds me, somehow, that cr&ecirc;pe myrtle,"
mused No&eacute;mie aloud, brushing from her hand
the spider's filmy broken rope, "of a grey-hound."</p>

<p>"Reckon hit <i>is</i> a greh-houn'," remarked the
old negro. "Tree by day, houn' by night. Yas'm.
Mars Dick useter tell about a houn'-dawg tu'nin'
into a tree. Caze he bark' at a young lady whar
was in swimmin' in Little Otter Creek." The
latter part of this curious jumble of classic myths,
with innovations, was chuckled by the narrator
under his breath.</p>

<p>The roses in the garden-court were all old-fashioned:
Gloire de Dijon, Cloth of Gold, Blush-cluster,
San guinea, Lamasque, and the like; the
prim flower beds were bordered with violets and
Star-of-Bethlehem; there was a lavender-bush in
one corner, and a mint bed behind the tall, tapering

<!-- page 23 -->

green cistern. "Mars Dick planted dem ar
yerbs hisse'f&mdash;fer yo' ma," said Uncle Mink,
straightening his bent back and pointing a rusty
forefinger vaguely about. "He fotch de fust
roots f'um Ole Virginny wher we was bawn."
No&eacute;mie had heard this statement at frequent
intervals ever since she could remember; but it
seemed forever new; it called up each time an
enchanting vision of the dead father, dimly present
to her memory, and of the beautiful young
mother, known to her bodily eyes only by the
portrait above the library mantel. She seemed to
see the two together, stooping&mdash;always in the
morning sunlight&mdash;to set in moist alien earth
the homely slips which were to remind the Virginian
of his birthplace.</p>

<p>"Becaze," continued Uncle Mink, according
to custom, "I come into yo' fambly 'long o' yo'
pa, honey. F'um Virginny."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," cried the young girl, her lips
parted eagerly, her smoke-blue eyes begging for
more.</p>

<p>"You is de spi't'n image of Miss Mah-teel,
chile,&mdash;clar to goodness, you is,&mdash;yaller hair
an' all. An' dem eyes o' yo'n! Lawd, yo' ma's

Yas'm."</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie Carrington had indeed inherited from
Mathilde de Laussan, her mother, the crinkly,
pale-gold tresses which waved and rippled above
her white forehead, her clear, fair, colorless skin,
her red lips, and her gray-blue eyes; Richard Carrington
had given to his only child the buoyant
slenderness of figure, the alert elasticity of motion,
the patrician carriage of the women of his race.
She had almost the look of an alien among her
dark-haired, velvet-eyed, softly-rounded, slow-gliding
Creole kinswomen.</p>

<p>"She is a de Laussan&mdash;and a Destrehan&mdash;all
the same," triumphed Madame de Laussan,
noting with delight from time to time some well-known
or half-forgotten family peculiarity that
showed itself in the child, the sole direct descendant
of that dashing de Laussan who came over
from France to the Province of Louisiana with
the great Bienville, and who, like more than one
of his line,&mdash;like Nemours de Laussan himself,&mdash;had

<!-- page 25 -->

married a Destrehan, a descendant of his
own brother-at-arms.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie rested her basket on the ancient sundial,
and stretched her arms, bared to the elbows,
above her head. "I did not know that roses
could be so heavy!" she laughed.</p>

<p>Uncle Mink dropped his spade with a clatter,
"Wher is dat no-count nigger-gal?" he growled.
"Ole Babe! O-o-le B-a-a-a-be!" He lifted his
mellow voice in a sonorous cry which reechoed
about the court. A negro girl about ten
years old came, in a noiseless sort of jog-trot,
through the wide gateway which opened upon a
smaller inner court. She was surprisingly black,
with egg-shaped eyes whose large, yellow pupils
swam in a sea of bluish-white, a wide mouth
perpetually opened in a perpetual grin, showing
fence-like rows of even, white teeth, a flat nose,
and a bulging forehead. The egg-shaped eyes
twinkled with an intelligence almost uncanny;
when their lids were down and the grin in eclipse,
an air of stupidity not to be described sat upon
her face.</p>

<p>"You triflin' limb o' Satan," growled Uncle
Mink, "why'n't you heah to tote yo' young mistess's

<!-- page 26 -->

rose-basket into the gret-house? Miss No-<i>mee</i>,
dis is Ole Babe, one o' my gals. She ain't
nothin' but a plantation-nigger yit. But she
gwine to be handy, ef she git the strop. I brung
her down f'um Lady's Rule to fetch an' carry
fer Si-reen. Si-reen's gittin' ole. Hmp. 'Bout
a hunderd, I spec."</p>

<p>"Old Babe?" No&eacute;mie looked down at the
queer little figure standing at her knee. "But
what is your name, child? Your real name?"</p>

<p>"Dess Ole Babe, li'l miss," drawled Sir&egrave;ne's
assistant, shaking her head until the string-wrapped
pigtails stood on end; "de twinses, dey

pickaninnies clawing at her guinea-blue skirt,&mdash;"an'
den dey was de baby, an' <i>I</i> hatter git
out'n de way. So dey called me <i>Ole</i> Babe."</p>

<p>She ducked her head, beat off the twins with
a skillful hand, seized the basket, poised it on
her head, and trotted off.</p>

<p>"And these are twins. Yours, Uncle Mink?
Dear me, I didn't know you had twins."</p>

<p>"T'ree pa'r, li'l miss. Yas'm. Dese two is gal

<p>"Oh, <i>Uncle Mink!</i>" cried No&eacute;mie, suppressing
a giggle. "You surely are not going to get
married <i>again</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I is, honey," returned the grizzled
veteran promptly. "De Good Book say it ain't
good fer man to live erlone. I follers de Holy
Scripchers. I ain't nuver live' erlone; I done
had fo' wives. Viny, she's onder groun'; de

to an inarticulate remonstrance from his young
mistress. "Dey bites an' dey scratches mo', but
dey tames mo' easier dan ole ones. Yas'm. Dey
tames mo' easier."</p>

<p>The bell on the street door rang; its clear,
silvery tinkle broke upon the old man's droning
monologue; the light echo rode airily upon
the lower-keyed, indrifting sound-waves from the
street. A quick tread sounded along the paved

<!-- page 28 -->

corridor. Sidney Cortland, advancing, looked
through the vaulted arch which framed a vista of
the courtyard, where the slim, white-clad figure of
Mademoiselle Carrington was outlined against the
round of a mandarin orange tree, glossy-green in
its painted tub. He experienced again the sensation
which had possessed him that April morning
some months earlier, when he had passed for
the first time down the dim-lighted porte coch&egrave;re
of the de Laussan mansion. It had seemed to him
then, as it did now, that he had in some previous
existence traversed the same alley, hearing as he
walked the same ripple of yellow Mississippi
River water in the stone troughway at the foot
of the wall; feeling in his face warm puffs of
wind from the courtyard, with the scent upon
them of blossoms hitherto unknown to him,&mdash;sweet-olive,
<i>jasmin du Cap</i>, opoponax; divining
rather than hearing, in the great rooms above,
the mysterious movements of a life and a people
to whose very tongue he was a stranger.</p>

<p>It was natural enough, this sensation. Even
as a boy, the story of the old, foreign-looking
house in the ancient foreign quarter of the far-away
Southern city had fascinated him, falling

<!-- page 29 -->

from the lips of his father,&mdash;Sidney Cortland,
ex-colonel of the United States Army. The
beautiful, pale chatelaine with the disdainful eyes
and the scornful mouth; the tall slave-woman,
a piece of living bronze, in her sombre skirts and
plaided tignon, with barbaric hoops of gold in
her ears and silver bracelets on her arms, and
voodoo charms about her neck; the blonde-haired
child asleep on her sofa; the high-ceilinged
room with its rich, dark furniture, the
portraits on the walls, the closed cabinets filled
with rare trifles, the costly hangings, the subdued
carpets;&mdash;all this had been woven, as it were,
into the web of his childhood. Later, there had
crept into the glamour another element; this
quickened his pulse as he threw a glance in
passing at the upward-leading stairway, sumptuous
in its breadth and in its delicately wrought
hand-rail and brass newel-post. It brought into
his eyes, between their narrowing lids, a look
utterly at variance with his singularly quiet,
contained countenance. The look, enigmatic,
untranslatable, might, nevertheless, have conveyed
to a practiced physiognomist a suggestion
of greed intermingled with triumph.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>Miss Carrington greeted her visitor with a
pleased smile. Cortland bowed gravely over the
slim, white hand extended to meet his own.</p>

<p>"Exit the convent-pupil!" he said, with a nod
toward the house, through whose wide-open
arched windows could be seen professional decorators
moving methodically about, stringing
electric globes, hanging garlands, laying dancing-cloths,
grouping palms and potted plants.</p>

<p>"Enter Mademoiselle de Laussan Carrington,"
she flashed back, dropping a low curtsy
which brought to his inner vision a swift picture
of Madame de Laussan mocking Captain Cortland, U. S. A.,
with her rebel skirts. A secure
half-smile stirred his lips. "Yes, monsieur, in me
you behold a young lady." She pronounced it
<i>yong</i>, with a little slur over the consonants which
Cortland found delicious. "To-night I make
my debut. A dinner and a ball; and myself at
the very heart of both. Oh, but I tremble. I
should like to run away!"</p>

<p>"Good! I will run away also with you," cried
Cortland in a stage whisper, feigning to interpose
himself between the debutante and the stolid
Uncle Mink. "Let us start at once."</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>"On the instant, monsieur!" He drew her,
laughing, in and out of the maze of sweet-olive
and jessamine, along the formal walks, around
the plant-girdled fountain pool.</p>

<p>He was accounted distinguished-looking rather
than handsome, this son of the officer who some
forty years before had, on one occasion at least,
commanded Butler's Provost Guard at New Orleans.
(The fact of the relationship, it need hardly
be said, remained carefully locked in the breast
of the younger Cortland; his father's name, never
known to Madame de Laussan, had upon his
departure from the captured city dropped into
oblivion there.) His tall, well-proportioned figure,
slightly inclined to heaviness, was apt to attract
instant notice; his full, pale face, in spite of the
mouth, whose short upper lip indicated weakness,
conveyed a subtle suggestion of power; his eyes,
light blue beneath heavy black eyebrows, when
not narrowed between their lids, had a frank
expression which invited confidence.</p>

<p>A fortuitous circumstance had given him, soon
after his arrival a stranger in the old town, the
entrance, ardently desired, into the de Laussan
house. Madame de Laussan one morning, descending

<!-- page 32 -->

from her carriage, crossed the drenched
banquette to her own door; she stepped inadvertently
upon a loose paving-stone, stumbled, and
would have fallen but for Cortland who chanced
to be passing,&mdash;Cortland, indeed, had spent much
time already in passing and repassing the de Laussan
mansion. He caught the slight form of his
father's long-ago adversary in his arms, lifted
her, moaning with pain from a twisted ankle,
and bore her into her own house. Presentation
later by a club acquaintance, who frankly disclaimed
responsibility for the stranger's unknown
antecedents, completed, somewhat irregularly, it
is true, Cortland's mastery of the coveted foothold.
Thenceforward he wrought patiently and
tactfully to win the favor of Madame de Laussan,
who was usually distrustful of all "outsiders."
At this moment he felt warranted in
congratulating himself on his success. Miss Carrington
regarded him with a friendliness which,
he knew, caused some comment among the other
habitu&eacute;s of the house. Old Sir&egrave;ne muttered spitefully
when she saw this Yon-<i>kee</i>&mdash;all unclassified
strangers were Yon-<i>kees</i>&mdash;lounging about
the chair of Madame de Laussan, or installed on

<!-- page 33 -->

a garden bench beside No&eacute;mie. She refused his
proffered gifts; she would have thrown the <i>wanga</i>
on him had she dared. She gave no reason for
her animosity; she had none to give!</p>

<p>"No!" declared No&eacute;mie, breathless, dropping
upon a bench; "on second thoughts, I shall not
run away&mdash;to-day. I stay. I desire to see with
my own eyes how Miss Carrington will conduct
herself at a dinner&mdash;<i>and</i> a ball! Still, I
am horribly afraid."</p>

<p>"You! the daughter of a hundred de Laussans
and Destrehans!" jested Cortland, looking
down upon her flushed, upturned face. "You!
the possessor of uncounted thousands! the heiress
of houses, jewels, sugar plantations&mdash;" His
eyelids were unconsciously narrowing.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" interrupted No&eacute;mie with disdain.</p>

<p>"That!" echoed Cortland, instantly normal
again. "It is true," he added, "that Miss Carrington
needs neither stainless pedigree nor fabulous
riches to make her&mdash;</p>

<p>"A young person unused to flattery," finished
No&eacute;mie, lifting an arch forefinger in warning.
"<i>&Agrave; ce soir</i>, Monsieur Cortland,"&mdash;for the
young man had arisen to take leave.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>"<i>&Agrave; ce soir</i>," he repeated, stumbling a little
over the unaccustomed phrase. "Then, we will
elope to-morrow, mademoiselle," he added lightly.</p>

<p>"Or the day after," she assented, in the
same tone. "Unless in the meantime the real
Prince&mdash;"</p>

<p>If the last playful suggestion jarred Cortland's
vanity, the impression was but momentary. A
satisfied smile was already hovering upon his lip
when he entered the corridor; and when, half-way
along its shadowy arch, he turned, it was
not to survey the girl, outlined as before against
the glossy green of the mandarin, but to take in
with half-closed eyes the carpeted stairway leading
into the halls above, along which one passed
from room to room into the presence of Madame
de Laussan.</p>

<p>"Yas, chile," Uncle Mink was saying, as if
there had been no break in his confidences, "dey
tames mo' easier. Li'l Hannah ain't got no
hired education, but she kin cook. I was a fiel'-han'
myse'f back in Ole Virginny; but when Ole
Mis' seen me settin' out dem yarbs yonder, she
<i>dis</i>-cover dat I has a <i>good han';</i> ever't'ing I

grows. Dat huccom Ole Mis' keep me in town to
gyarden fer her; cep'n when I goes up to Lady's
Rule to git married. I mos'ly keeps my wives
an' my chillen up at Lady's Rule". Hit's mo'
safer."</p>

<p>The garrulous tongue clattered on. No&eacute;mie
thrust a handful of violets into her belt, and
strolled toward the house.</p>

<p>"<i>Matin: chagrin</i>," she murmured lightly;
"what disaster, I wonder, will mar my entrance
into the world&mdash;into real life! Perhaps the soup
will be spoiled at the dinner; or l'oncle Grandchamps
will quarrel with Monsieur Paturin about
Napoleon; or there will be a crush at the ball;
or there will be no one; or&mdash;fearful thought!&mdash;I
will have no partners. <i>Matin: chagrin</i>."</p>

<p>She passed, singing, up the grand stair.</p>

<hr/>

<p>III</p>

<p class="small">DANS LE TEMPS</p>

</div>

<p>THE dinner was drawing to a close; so far,
there had been nothing to justify the descent
from nowhere, a few hours earlier, of a
certain fat, ominous spider. Madame de Laussan
presided, stately in velvet and ancestral laces,
wearing upon her abundant snow-white hair the
famous de Laussan tiara of diamonds. The table,
with its rare appointment of crystal and silver,
its exquisite napery, choice flowers,&mdash;even its
wines,&mdash;met the approval of Major L&eacute;on Grandchamps,
late of the Confederate States Army,
that handsome grizzled connoisseur whose presence
was equally sought after and dreaded by the
dinner-givers of the <i>Vieux Carr&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;Miss Carrington settled back in her
chair. "L'oncle Grandchamps has begun to recall
<i>dans le temps!</i> This means," she breathed into
the ear of her left-hand neighbor, "that as a
dinner-party we are a success. <i>Dieu merci</i>."</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p>The neighbor, Donald Strang, assumed an
attitude of respectful attention, his face turned
toward the rigid disciplinarian of the old school;
but he looked sidewise at No&eacute;mie. "She looks,
somehow, different from the others," he decided
within himself. "What is it which makes
her&mdash;different?"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the fair head set like a flower
on the milk-white neck; the other young heads
were all dark by contrast, even Frances Heron's,
which passed elsewhere for blonde, Don's own
red mane, and the brown, close-cut crop of Sidney
Cortland. The light streaming downward from
the crystal chandeliers was hardly more palely
golden than the soft nimbus crowning her
brow.</p>

<p>"You must not talk," No&eacute;mie admonished the
young man on her right, for Monplaisir had
leaned toward her and opened his lips to speak;
"not to be listened to sours the wine of l'oncle
Grandchamps, and then he and Monsieur Paturin
quarrel about General Bonaparte. Besides," she
added with demure gravity, "the young learn by
listening."</p>

<p>"For myself, <i>ma cousine</i>, I prefer to be old

<!-- page 38 -->

and to learn by looking," returned F&eacute;lix Monplaisir
gallantly, sweeping her with an openly admiring
glance.</p>

<p>"<i>Dans le temps</i>," Major Grandchamps was
saying oracularly, "when those electric bogg had
their abode in the cypri&egrave;re, and the timber for
those electric car-r was in the a-cor-rn,"&mdash;he
shifted easily from English to French, and back
again as he proceeded, according as his eyes
chanced to fall upon American or Creole,&mdash;"when
some of us were young, eh, Paturin?&mdash;and
there were such lips and such eyes in the
<i>corbeille</i> at the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l'Op&eacute;ra</i> as the degenerates
of this day have not the red blood to
imagine! when you felt the beat of your heart
to the tips of your fingers; when you drained
your glass without asking leave of your stomach!
<i>dans le temps</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is as much as to say 'befo' the wah,' "
murmured Tom Masters into the air.</p>

<p>Exactly! the veteran had mounted his hobby,
and was galloping gayly back into a day when
the sun really revolved around the earth. Who
that lived then does not know it, as it were, by
heart,&mdash;that golden time of youth and romance,

<!-- page 39 -->

and large leisure, and easy credit! The time of
mint-julep, and foxhound, and <i>colichemarde!</i> Of
unrivaled women and adventurous men! <i>Dans
le temps!</i> But yes!</p>

<p>"The war, our war&mdash;not that bagatelle of a
Spanish-American," said Monsieur Alcide Paturin,
in the thin, pleasant tones which accorded
with his profession: he was an <i>avocat</i>. Yet,
small, shrunken, and old as he now was, leathery
and musty in the midst of leathery pamphlets
and musty title-deeds, Paturin had been in '61
a <i>chasseur &agrave; pied</i> in baggy trousers and a red
sash; a fighter, too, of the best. "That Civil War
illuminated the death-bed of the Old R&eacute;gime.
The New? Bah! It is of a commercialism to
poison the air we breathe."</p>

<p>The younger guests, seeing that Paturin had
been allowed to enter the arena, felt themselves
released; there was instant resumption of light
chatter about the lower end of the long oval.</p>

<p>"Do you know, No&eacute;mie," called Jeanne Berthet
across the central mound of roses, "who has come
to that United States Barrack&mdash;Jack<i>son</i> Barrack&mdash;down
the river? Maxime Allard. None
other."</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>No&eacute;mie flushed slightly. "Truly?" she cried.
"I thought he was in the Philippines."</p>

<p>"So he has been. But at present, behold him
returned, a captain in the artiller<i>ee</i>. Shoulder-straps
and all. <i>Il est beau comme un ange</i> in
his uniform."</p>

<p>"Sh! Sh!" warned Madame Berthet, her
mother (born Grandchamps), with a glance at the
white heads at the upper end of the oval. "You
forget that the father of Maxime, le Colonel Allard,
was comrade to my papa in that Confederate
war. Papa, therefore, does not pardon him for
allowing Maxime to enter <i>l'&eacute;cole militaire de
West Point</i>. Neither does he pardon Maxime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the same, he has done something wonderful
in the Philippines, Maxime, and he dances
adorably," persisted Jeanne.</p>

<p>"In&mdash;this&mdash;very&mdash;house, Goddam!" The
table shook under a blow, thrice repeated, from
the fist of Major Grandchamps; the crystal pendants
of the candelabra tinkled musically, half a
dozen slender-stemmed wineglasses toppled over,
spilling their amber contents on the cloth.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie turned pale. "I knew it!" she confided

<!-- page 41 -->

desperately to Strang. "Monsieur Paturin
and l'oncle Grandchamps are quarreling. The
great Napoleon has arrived. But no. It is only
the Yankee captain and the Provost Guard."
Again she settled back, relieved, in her chair; and
again there was respectful silence. For Major
Grandchamps was telling the "Story of the
Sword."</p>

<p>"It belonged to the Marquis de Lafayette,"
he continued, "by whom it was worn during the
War of the Revolution, when France so nobly
came to the aid of those American colonies. The
Marquis presented it to his friend and aide-de-camp,
Louis Destrehan, the ancestor of <i>madame
ma cousine</i>." The speaker paused, arose deliberately
from his chair and leaned forward to take
in his own the jeweled hand of Madame de Laussan,
and to set his moustached lips upon the
satin-white finger tips. "Her father, falling at
the Battle of New Orleans, gave it, blood-stained,
to his friend Pierre de Laussan, who, holding it
aloft, led his command to victory. It is a sword of
honor, that sword. The jeweled hilt surmounts
a Toledo blade of the first quality&mdash;long, flexible,
slender. Hilt and scabbard bear the fleur-de-lys

<!-- page 42 -->

of France. A precious souvenir in the
famille Destrehan-de-Laussan. It was presented
by General Pierre de Laussan to his grandson,"&mdash;the
major paused and lowered his head reverently&mdash;"to
Pierre de Laussan, the only son of
Nemours de Laussan and his wife, <i>madame ma
cousine</i>." Again the <i>vieux moustache</i> arose from
his chair to bend over the jeweled hand of his
kinswoman; it trembled in his grasp. "The
great war&mdash;our war&mdash;breaks out," he continued,
standing in military erectness, and speaking
with rapid, dramatic utterance; "Nemours de
Laussan is already at the forefront of his country's
defense. His son, Pierre, though but a
child, has the consent of a patriotic mother to
join that gallant father. He is at the moment of
bidding her farewell. He is in hiding, here in the
h&ocirc;tel de Laussan&mdash;for those despicable Yankees
have possession of our city, and there are spies
everywhere,&mdash;spies hiding in the courtyard of
your house; spies behind the porti&egrave;res of your
salon; spies under the table in your bureau, spies
at the crack of your door, at your heel, at your
elbow&mdash;black spies, white spies&mdash;the white are
the worst, Goddam! They bring their lies to

<!-- page 43 -->

that degraded Provost Marshal; he sends his vile
scum of a guard. It is infamous! The <i>pauvre
enfant</i>, I tell you, is in the act of receiving upon
his brow the holy embrace of his mother. That
guard enters&mdash;this&mdash;very&mdash;house&mdash;" Again
the table dances under the blow, thrice repeated,
of the major's clenched fist; and again wineglasses
topple over; one in front of Cortland
has its slender foot broken, the fragments rolling
to the polished floor. "Those <i>&acirc;mes-de-boue</i>
of Yankee soldiers are commanded by a captain
who has the face of a villain, Goddam!" The
speaker's eyes, which glared in their deep sockets,
were fixed unconsciously upon Cortland, who
listened with an air of detached interest. "A
ferocious villain. But when he reached the library
where <i>madame ma cousine</i> stands, protected
only by her sacred womanhood,&mdash;aha!
the young eaglet has flown. And he has taken
from its place on the wall the sword of Lafayette.
He finds time and place, in the midst of his
hurried flight, to hide that venerated sword,
that the hand of an enemy may not pollute it,
hilt or blade. He raises it aloft in a last salute
to his mother, as he passes&mdash;forever, <i>h&eacute;las!</i>&mdash;from

<!-- page 44 -->

her sight. Enough, my friends." The
deep voice, become husky, ceased a moment; the
old man drew the back of his hand, unashamed,
across his dimmed eyes. "Since forty years," he
resumed, "that sword remains hidden where
Pierre placed it, somewhere in this house; for the
boy&mdash;killed in the defense of his country&mdash;has
never revealed the secret of its hiding-place.
I have myself sought it&mdash;vainly. So have many
others. Sometimes," the old voice trailed on,
slowly now, and dreamily, "I picture to myself
that brave young scion of the famille Destrehan-de-Laussan
coming up at midnight from
the cimeti&egrave;re St. Louis, where he sleeps, to take
the old sword he so honored, from its unknown
refuge, and to pass with it, head aloft, through
the well-remembered house where he was born&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>L&eacute;on, pour l'amour de Dieu!</i>" Madame de
Laussan had arisen from her chair; her hands
were outstretched in trembling entreaty; her
white face a prey to agonized emotions, long
dormant.</p>

<p>"Major Grandchamps," Strang broke upon the
painful silence in a matter-of-fact tone, though
his hand, grasping the back of No&eacute;mie's chair,

<!-- page 45 -->

shook a little, "I lay you a wager, ten to one if
you will, that I find that sword&mdash;provided, of
course, that Madame de Laussan shall grant me
the right of search&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I also claim the grace of a like wager," cried
Monplaisir.</p>

<p>"And I," proffered Masters. The tense moment
was tided over.</p>

<p>Monsieur Paturin had forced Madame de
Laussan very gently back into her seat. Major
Grandchamps, still breathing heavily, was begging
her pardon in undertone.</p>

<p>"And I also," remarked Paturin. "Only, messieurs,
if I, groping about the attics through
those trapdoors known to Hercule, or climbing
to the belvidere up forgotten stairways, shall
unearth the sword of Lafayette, I shall claim as
a reward the hand of Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie de
Laussan Carrington."</p>

<p>A laugh went around the table.</p>

<p>"A good suggestion, Monsieur Paturin," said
Madame de Laussan, making a visible effort to
recover her self-control. "Hear, messieurs! The
hand of Mademoiselle Carrington shall be the
guerdon of him who finds the Lafayette sword."</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>"A dangerous promise, Laure, and a rash,
though it be only in jest," interposed Major
Grandchamps, with the irritability which is apt to
follow great mental excitement.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan was herself suffering the
anti-climax of painful emotion. "I am not jesting,"
she declared haughtily. "I swear it&mdash;by
the Holy Virgin." She raised her voice in obstinate
repetition. "The hand of Mademoiselle de
Laussan Carrington shall be the reward of him
who finds the sword of Lafayette, hidden in
1862 by my son, Pierre de Laussan."</p>

<p>"The quest is open to all?" demanded Cortland,
who had hitherto remained silent.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, to all."</p>

<p>"For a Year and a Day," amended No&eacute;mie
laughing; "like the Quest of the Grail." She
gave her arm, as she spoke, to her grandmother.</p>

<p>"A woman in a million, <i>madame ma cousine</i>,"
remarked Major Grandchamps, when the porti&egrave;re
had dropped behind them; "but of a temper to
intimidate the devil. It will be the death of her."</p>

<p>"It keeps her alive," returned Paturin, filling
his glass, drop by drop, with the practiced hand
of a <i>bon viveur</i>.</p>

<p class="small">PIERRE'S TERRACE</p>

</div>

<p>MISS CARRINGTON led the way, lifting
here a silken curtain, there skirting a palm-shaded
recess, traversing unsuspected passages,
skimming through oddly-set rooms, deserted but
aglow with light. Cortland followed, casting as
he went speculative glances around. The echo
of dance music came after them, with the softened
murmur of many voices, the rhythmic beat
of young feet upon polished floors&mdash;for the ball
was at its height. The girl paused at length, and
turned a dance-flushed face over her shoulder.
"Here, Mr. Cortland, you will find that breath
of fresh air for which you offer your soul."</p>

<p>"It is worth it," Cortland returned, stepping
through the French window after her, and drawing
into his lungs a full inspiration of dewy,
flower-scented night air.</p>

<p>"Since the contract remains unsigned," she
laughed.</p>

<p>A marble balustrade, discolored by time, enclosed

<!-- page 48 -->

the wide terrace, or loggia, upon which
they stood; a short flight of steps, also of marble,
broken and worn, led down into the small inner
court, faced on one side by the stable, coach- and
tool-house. Low benches were set against the
stuccoed wall of the house; one end of the terrace
was closed by a flower-box,&mdash;a sort of brick
and stucco sarcophagus,&mdash;from which a giant
plumbago tossed down the outer slope a cascade of
feathery leafage starred with clusters of blossom,&mdash;pale-blue
by daylight, but under the full moon
ghostly white. A border of sweet alyssum hung,
ragged, over the inner edge of the box; huge
urns, also funereal in suggestion, flanked the
marble steps on either side: these gave out the
heavy scent of the Grand Duke jessamine.</p>

<p>"How picturesque!" exclaimed Cortland.</p>

<p>"The terrace? Isn't it!" No&eacute;mie sank
lightly upon the bench, her white draperies fluffing
around her. "It is called Pierre's Terrace,
because it was here that Hercule&mdash;the negro
who managed the escape&mdash;found my little uncle
Pierre the day the Yankees came to arrest
him. He was sitting right where I am sitting
now, waiting, his pistol in his hand&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"The sword upon his knee," interjected Cortland
flippantly.</p>

<p>She was too absorbed to note his tone. "The
sword? He had already hidden the sword; Hercule
never saw it. Hercule jumped from the balusters
to the wall yonder, and drew my uncle up
after him. I can see it all as if it were under my
eyes! Then they climbed somehow to the little
jutting balcony,&mdash;you may see the corner of it
from where you stand,&mdash;and so into the old turret-schoolroom,
and out upon the roof. That
Yankee officer was in a fine rage," she added
gleefully, "when he found that his prey had
escaped. Hercule described it all to my grandmother.
She gave him the last gold-piece she
possessed. He had a handful of silver, besides,
from the Yankee captain,&mdash;in payment for his
services as a guide to the h&ocirc;tel de Laussan."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel!" ejaculated Cortland involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Hercule? Do you think him a scoundrel?
Hercule!" She looked up in na&iuml;ve surprise.
"We regard him as a saint&mdash;almost. A little&mdash;crooked&mdash;to
the enemy, if you will; but incapable
of betraying his master. I never saw him&mdash;dear

<!-- page 50 -->

old Hercule; it all happened ages before I
was born, of course. There are many of his kind
among us, even yet,&mdash;loyal to the core to the
families who once owned them, or their fathers
and their mothers. However, you of the North
cannot, of course, understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not a Northern man," interrupted Cortland
shortly; "I was born in the South&mdash;in this
state. So was my father before me. My people&mdash;"
he stopped abruptly, biting his lips.
Secretive by nature and habit, the inherited
antagonism of the Southern poor-white to the 'ristocrat,
and his apparently instinctive antagonism
to the negro who despises him, had broken an
overlaid crust and betrayed the young man into
an admission which he was far from intending to
make. His discomfort communicated itself to his
companion.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, confused, without knowing
why, "then yours is a return of the native! Welcome
home, monsieur! But come,"&mdash;she arose,&mdash;"our
five minutes' leave must be long over. We
shall have a phalanx of chaperones upon us! Besides,
my waltzes will be in a hopeless tangle."</p>

<p>Fair as she was, standing before him, white-clad,

<!-- page 51 -->

dream-like in the moonlight, Cortland, for
the moment, was hardly aware of her fairness,&mdash;even
of her presence. By one of those flashes,
set loose by a chance word, a gesture, a glance,
which at times illumine a whole forgotten past,
there unrolled before his inner vision a rapid
panorama of his own life: he saw, vividly projected
against the background of shiftless cabin
and unkempt field, the motherless, barefoot boy,
shunned by his own kind as the son of a "renegade;"
absolutely non-existent for that higher
world gathering itself together with patrician insolence
from the wreck of the Civil War; jeered
at by the negroes, who held themselves, as always,
above his class, and who had, besides, a curious
contempt for the Southern man "turned Yankee"&mdash;even
to break their own yoke of slavery! He
followed in fancy the career of the boy himself:
as a petty clerk in the far-off Western town
whither his father, ex-colonel U. S. A., had removed.
He tracked the unprincipled clerk into
the adventurer, the dead-beat, gambler, spendthrift;
of later years the&mdash; He faced the girl
suddenly in a sort of fury; a demand from her
of payment for all he had endured, all he had

<!-- page 52 -->

had, all he had not had, struggled to his lips
and well-nigh burst forth. She drew back, paling
a little under his violent glance. He recovered
himself. "Pierre's Terrace!" He turned, lingeringly,
to follow her into the house. "So the
Yankee officer looted the h&ocirc;tel de Laussan!"
he laughed. "Did he by chance carry away anything
of importance? Papers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," returned No&eacute;mie carelessly, "the de
Laussan jewels were too safely hidden away for
even his greedy eyes. And, as my grandmother
said, the loss of the de Laussan diamonds would
have been a trifle compared with my little uncle
Pierre's safety."</p>

<p>"Madame de Laussan is doubtless rich enough
to support such a loss."</p>

<p>Again Cortland bit his lip, subtly aware that
in the de Laussan world such a remark would
have been ticketed as vulgar.</p>

<p>But No&eacute;mie had not heard. She had paused on
the threshold of the French window, and stood
listening; a smile parted her red lips.</p>

<p>From the servants' quarters, invisible from the
inner court, came floating the long-drawn, plaintive
notes of a "spiritual" sung by Old Babe.

<!-- page 53 -->

The violins from the other direction, though
they flung into the advancing night the sensuous
strains of a waltz, bore up the weird melody
strangely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Look to yo' foot, ez you trabble on de way,<br/>

Walk wa-ry.<br/>

Fer de Snake is in de Grass at de een o' de day,<br/>

Walk wa-ry</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then, to the drumming of bare feet on the
floor, and in a staccato movement that suggested
the tam-tam and the gourd-rattle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Snake in de Grass, kill um! kill um!<br/>

Stomp on he haid twell he die.<br/>

Stomp, stomp, s-t-o-m-p!</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The song ended abruptly, parting with a shriek
from the ballroom waltz.</p>

<p>"They have a curious effect on me, those
negro melodies," No&eacute;mie said, moving on. "They
seem to transport me into some mysterious region
where are dim, formless shapes and half-remembered
sounds. I suppose it is an inheritance, so
to speak, from my foster-mother, Sir&egrave;ne."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," agreed Cortland. He drew her
ungloved hand through his arm, bending keen
eyes as he did so upon the tapering, ringless
fingers with their shell-like nails.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p class="small">THE BOX</p>

</div>

<p>"A PRETTY enough <i>corbeille!</i>" Major Grandchamps
spoke with kindly condescension. He
surveyed the house through his opera-glasses,
removing them from moment to moment to bow
in the direction of an open box, or a <i>loge grill&eacute;e</i>.
"Not comparable, certainly, to the <i>corbeille</i> of
<i>dans le temps</i>. But, creditable. Creditable."</p>

<p>The great auditorium presented, tier upon tier,
a spectacle of dazzling splendor. That exuberant
fancy which had likened the general effect of the
horseshoe filled with women in radiant toilettes,
resplendent in jewels, to a basket of flowers, did
not seem far-fetched at this <i>ouverture</i> of the
French opera season. The curtain had fallen,
amid an uproar of applause, on the first act of
<i>Les Huguenots;</i> and the small army of men
supporting the boxes&mdash;standing several rows
deep, a black fringe against the curving wall&mdash;had
swarmed forward, sudden as a flight of bees,

<!-- page 55 -->

to hover over "bud" and full-blown flower in
<i>loge d&eacute;couverte</i> or <i>grill&eacute;e</i>, or <i>baignoire</i>.</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps stood in the rear of the
proscenium-box where Madame Berthet, his
daughter&mdash;a suave and smiling, but alert guardian&mdash;presided
over the destinies of the <i>jeunes
filles</i> in her care. He frowned, stroking his
gray moustache with a gloved hand, in the effort
to crystallize the vague memory stirred by the
entrance of a young man in correct evening
dress, who bowed before him, and half extended,
half withdrew his hand with a confused air,
passing on to the circle gathering about Miss
Carrington. "Where the devil have I met him?"
the major muttered. "Fine-looking fellow, <i>parole
d'honneur</i>. Looks like a soldier."</p>

<p>The newcomer was, in fact, a soldier. Maxime
Allard, smiling under Jeanne Berthet's gay raillery,
but bending grave eyes upon his old play-fellow,
No&eacute;mie Carrington, recalled to the major,
had he but known it, his sometime comrade-in-arms
and now bitter enemy, Colonel Fernand Allard,
late of the Confederate States Army!</p>

<p>As the young officer advanced, the others drew
aside, according to the strict code of the entr'acte.

<!-- page 56 -->

He had been wondering for the past half-hour,
watching No&eacute;mie from his chair in the
parquet, what he should say first when he came
into her presence after so many years of absence.
He was, truth to say, not sure whether&mdash;seeing
that the Grandchamps-Allard feud, of which he
was the more or less innocent cause, closed to
him the doors of the Grandchamps connection&mdash;he
ought to enter her box at all! He asked himself
many times afterward what had prompted
him to demand, looking down into her flushed
face: "And the sword of Lafayette? Has it
ever been found? Do you remember, No&eacute;mie&mdash;Miss
Carrington," he had continued, half in embarrassment,
"how you and I and Jeanne used to
follow l'oncle Grandchamps and Monsieur Paturin,
or old Mink, or Sir&egrave;ne, about from ground-floor
to attic in order to be in at the finding of
the sword?"</p>

<p>"And how No&eacute;mie regularly offered her allowance
to St. Anthony of Padua for even the
slightest clue? It is true that No&eacute;mie's allowance
was always spent long in advance&mdash;for
<i>drag&eacute;es</i>. Perhaps the saint suspected that. At
least, he never furnished the clue!"</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>"For shame, Jeanne!" laughed No&eacute;mie. "Yes,
I remember. And even when you were a big
boy&mdash;Captain Allard&mdash;searching on your own
account, once you tumbled into a cobwebbed
<i>oubliette</i> and had to be dragged out by the
heels!"</p>

<p>"All that was before West Point, alas!" murmured
Allard. "Now, I fear&mdash;" He glanced at
the major in the rear of the box, who, having
at length placed him, was scowling at him furiously.</p>

<p>"No, it has never been found," No&eacute;mie said.</p>

<p>"And you must know, Maxime," interrupted
Jeanne, "that the hand of Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie
de Laussan Carrington, with or without her
heart, is the prize offered for the restoration of
that sword. Madame de Laussan, <i>ma tante</i>, has
sworn it by the crown of the Virgin&mdash;no longer
ago than last night. The aspirants are already
in evidence. They choke the halls of the h&ocirc;tel
de Laussan; the stairways resound under their
feet. Even Monsieur Alcide Paturin has entered
the lists."</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Carrington? Are you also
pledged to this compact?"</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>She flashed an enigmatic glance upon him
before replying. "I? I am bound at least for a
Year and a Day."</p>

<p>Monplaisir had joined the group. He laid an
arm familiarly across Allard's shoulder. "You are
barred by your uniform, <i>mon vieux</i>. Our fiery old
dragon of an uncle yonder will guard the door
of the h&ocirc;tel de Laussan with blade and flame."</p>

<p>"All the same," cried Allard gayly, "I enroll
myself in the Legion: I will follow the Quest if
I have to break my way into the house by the
roof&mdash;as Pierre de Laussan broke his way out!"</p>

<p>"Who is the man yonder, just quitting the
de Laussan box?" demanded Cortland of the
heavy-set, florid man who stood beside him in
the slowly regathering fringe opposite,&mdash;for a
traditional knocking behind the scenes had announced
the imminent rise of the curtain.</p>

<p>"Which one? Patterson, I think. Oh, no,
it is Allard, an army officer; a captain, I believe.
He has just come back from the Philippines.
Belongs to one of the old Creole families&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop that, will you!" growled Cortland;
"I am sick of your old Creole families, your
<i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, your befo' the wah aristocracy."

<!-- page 59 -->

He mimicked cleverly certain well-known social
lights. "Here; let's get out. The whole thing
bores me to death."</p>

<p>"Lord, Sid," ejaculated his companion, "I
thought you liked it&mdash;and them!" He indicated
the horseshoe in a comprehensive nod. "D&mdash;d
if I didn't! You've got to be such a swell since
we come to New Orleans! Get out? You bet!
I've been ready to quit ever since that bandy-legged
little tenor began to bawl. But, say, ain't
you going to sachey round to the prosceenyum
box first?"</p>

<p>"I have been," snorted Cortland, beginning
to elbow his way through the fringe. He had
been! And he smarted still with the remembrance
of his own dumb awkwardness as he had stood
in the half-circle of men ranged in front of No&eacute;mie
Carrington, tossing the airy bubble of persiflage
back and forth among themselves, dropping
it from moment to moment to her hand,
catching it deftly in its return flight. The ease
and grace of it all! Cortland glared at Donald
Strang,&mdash;one of 'em, curse him!&mdash;who chanced
to be in his path.</p>

<p>He got on well enough with women, he reflected

<!-- page 60 -->

without conceit. Women liked him; a
certain bravado, easily construed into manliness,
a brusqueness which hinted at restrained power;
a gift for silence at times which indicated depth,&mdash;and
mystery!&mdash;these carried him easily
among women. He felt himself judged more
severely by these suave, keen-eyed men of the
world, who appraised bravado and brusqueness
at their true value. He was ill at ease in their
company, handicapped as he was by the ineradicable
suspicion of the caste, which was his heritage.</p>

<p>"I have been," he repeated savagely, "and I
have had enough."</p>

<p>The two men stood for a moment under the
open arcade of the Opera House; then, walking
to the corner, they plunged into a side street
lighted for several blocks by myriads of carriage
lamps, pair after pair, one behind another, like
eyes starring the darkness. Beyond, the intricacies
of unpaved cross streets and gloom-wrapped
alleys.</p>

<br/>

<p>The de Laussan library, the next morning, was
filled with agreeable warmth from a small wood

<!-- page 61 -->

fire which burned in the open fireplace; the
crackling flames, leaping above the tall fire-dogs,
were reflected in the brass fender and in the
mirror-like polish of cabinets, bookcases, and
tables. A flood of sunshine poured in from the
east windows, illuminating the pictured faces of
hawk-eyed Destrehan and debonair de Laussan
on the walls. Madame de Laussan, erect in her
high-backed chair, her slim hands folded on her
lap, listened with almost wistful eagerness to
Madame Berthet's account of No&eacute;mie's triumphs
at <i>l'ouverture</i>.</p>

<p>The old madame retained to an extraordinary
degree that imperious beauty which, in the early
forties of the nineteenth century, had stirred
New Orleans&mdash;and Paris&mdash;to enthusiasm. The
lines etched by time and suffering around her
mouth and her dark eyes&mdash;the Destrehan eyes&mdash;gave
an added distinction to the high-bred
face.</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me your secret, <i>marraine!</i>"
sighed Madame Berthet, rising to go. "I
have thirty years less than you have; but, <i>ma
foi</i>, I look a hundred. It is true that I have
Jeanne&mdash;who is of a giddiness! and F&eacute;lix, my

<!-- page 62 -->

nephew, always running into debt; and the six
younger children,&mdash;besides papa who keeps no
hours,&mdash;but <i>laissons l&agrave;</i>. Be content, <i>ch&egrave;re
marraine</i>, No&eacute;mie is superb. Like her mother.
When I see No&eacute;mie, I see Mathilde!"</p>

<p>"Mathilde!" breathed Madame de Laussan,
when the door had closed upon her visitor. She
looked long and steadily at the portrait above
the mantel. "There is not a soul alive who
knows, besides ourselves, Sir&egrave;ne," she mused
softly, "unless, the letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir&egrave;ne, crouched on the rug, was stroking the
small, slippered feet resting on her lap. "It was
a lie," she said, in the <i>n&egrave;gre</i> unmodified by years.</p>

<p>Younger than her mistress by a dozen years,
Sir&egrave;ne, like her, had kept the slim, straight figure,
the fine poise of head, the statuesque repose of
youth; the lines of age were even more lightly
drawn on her dark, sphinx-like face. "Me, I
always knew it was a lie."</p>

<p>"God be thanked, it never darkened <i>her</i> life.
She never knew of it. And not even the shadow
of it remains to trouble her child&mdash;my little
No&eacute;mie. Ah, God be praised!" Both women
crossed themselves fervently.</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>Madame de Laussan's long-drawn sigh of relief
had hardly fluttered from her lips, when she
felt a tension in Sir&egrave;ne's body which jerked the
mulattress to her knees; her own hand was
clutched in a convulsive grasp of the brown
fingers. "My God, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse, the Yankee
Captain!&mdash;little Master Pierre!&mdash;General Butler's
Guard"&mdash;stammered Sir&egrave;ne incoherently,
her jaws fallen, her eyes starting from her
head.</p>

<p>Cortland, dropping the porti&egrave;re behind him,
stood in the exact spot where his father had
paused on that unforgotten day. He held his
hat in his hand; the dark blue caped top-coat he
wore added to the momentary illusion.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan, turning in her chair, saw
him. The terror awakened by Sir&egrave;ne's outcry
gave place to an almost hysterical amusement.
"Monsieur Cortland!" she exclaimed, rising and
advancing a step; "you are welcome. It is indeed
charitable of you to remember the existence
of an old woman like myself, after the dissipation
of last night."</p>

<p>"After the dissipation of last night." Cortland
repeated the words mechanically. He walked

<!-- page 64 -->

forward with deliberation, slipping his hand into
the inner pocket of his coat as he advanced.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated, monsieur." Madame de
Laussan waved him to a chair and returned to
her own, tactfully unobservant of his pale face,
disordered locks, and bloodshotten eyes.</p>

<p>"I desire to see you alone, madame," he said,
declining the chair and standing over her, tall
and sombre. Underneath his top-coat, his evening
clothes were visible, crumpled and awry:
his shirt front was stained as if by wine.</p>

<p>"I have no secrets from Sir&egrave;ne," returned Madame
de Laussan haughtily, yet softening a little.
She had never liked him, this intruder without a
background, forced upon her by common decency
of feeling. Yet it was natural, inevitable, indeed!
that he should love No&eacute;mie; and that he should
come, poor devil, to ask for No&eacute;mie's&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave the room!" He addressed Sir&egrave;ne with
harsh abruptness.</p>

<p>"I ris-seive my h'orders from my meestrees."
Sir&egrave;ne's head went up as haughtily as that of
Madame de Laussan herself.</p>

<p>"Go, Sir&egrave;ne. Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie will be
waking, and needing you."</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>Madame de Laussan smiled indulgently at her
visitor. The mulattress left the room instantly,
but not without a glance of veiled insolence
toward Cortland.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated, monsieur," repeated Madame
de Laussan.</p>

<p>Again Cortland ignored the invitation. "I
come," he began slowly, as if choosing his words
or rehearsing a speech previously composed, "to
restore to the famille de Laussan certain objects
which are doubtless of small intrinsic value; but
which, nevertheless&mdash;" he drew his hand from
his breast-pocket, "nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan uttered a cry. The small
box lying in his open palm was of tortoise-shell
inlaid with gold,&mdash;obviously one of those ancient
snuff-boxes designed for royal presentation; it
bore upon the lid a medallion miniature of Louis
XIV set in brilliants.</p>

<p>"How came this in your possession, Monsieur
Cortland?" demanded Madame de Laussan, reaching
out a trembling hand to receive it. He drew
back, tapping the lid with an unsteady finger as
he spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doubtless you may with an effort recall,

<!-- page 66 -->

madame, the visit made you some forty years ago
by a certain Yankee captain,&mdash;a morning call,
I believe; it was before I was born!"</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan had sprung to her feet;
she stood facing him, transfixed with horror.</p>

<p>"That Yankee," he dwelt upon the words,
"chanced to be my father&mdash;Captain Sidney Cortland
of the United States Army; in command,
at the moment which I have the honor to recall
to you, of Butler's Provost Marshal Guard. He
died years ago. I beg you to do him the justice
to believe that he regretted the impulse which
led him to carry away this trifle&mdash;for so it was,
among the many costly objects which went into the
pockets of his men. He&mdash;appropriated&mdash;it for a
souvenir of&mdash;for the girl, afterward my mother,"&mdash;Cortland's
sneering tone faltered a little,&mdash;"to
whom he was at that time engaged. I do not
think he ever gave it to her; she never spoke of
it. He charged me on his deathbed to restore it
to you, if you were in the land of the living. I
should have done so earlier, I admit. But&mdash;" 
He shrugged his shoulders and left the sentence
unfinished. "You will find the contents intact,
I believe: two seal rings, a small ebony cross

<!-- page 67 -->

bearing upon a silver bar the initials L. D., and
an uncut stone&mdash;a sapphire, I think."</p>

<p>He gave the box, with an exaggerated bow,
into the outstretched hand. Madame de Laussan
opened it with eager fingers, and took out one
by one the objects mentioned.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the letter?" she asked, her voice
dropped to an agonized whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was a letter? Since you mention it,
I remember there was a letter." His smile was
somewhat overdone. "Let me see, from&mdash;the
name of the writer has slipped my memory for
the moment. It was addressed to you? Yes, so
it was."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Cortland,"&mdash;Madame de Laussan
had suddenly pulled herself together; she spoke
quietly, and with a coolness which surpassed his
own,&mdash;"you can have but one motive in withholding
a paper in which you have no personal
interest. I hesitate to charge you with that motive,
even now, knowing at last that you are the
son of your father. If I am mistaken, I ask your
forgiveness. Your appearance, your story, have
brought back to me memories which&mdash; But no
matter. Am I right, monsieur, in suggesting

<!-- page 68 -->

that you desire in exchange for the letter which
you have in your hand"&mdash;Cortland had drawn
from his breast pocket a yellowed, oblong slip of
paper with dark seal, and was holding it ostentatiously&mdash;"a
consideration?"</p>

<p>Cortland laughed recklessly; the veneer of
refinement had dropped from him, body and soul,
like a garment. He looked vulgar and commonplace
in his unmeet garb; his eyes leered satyr-like
between thin, half-closed lids.</p>

<p>"You are quite correct, madame," he said,
again bowing low before her; "as I am not, myself,
the member of an old Creole family, I need
not beat about the bush. This letter, which, as
you are aware, affects the happiness, the social
standing, of Miss No&eacute;mie de Laussan Carrington,"&mdash;the
ugly sneer curled his lip,&mdash;"this
important document is&mdash;for&mdash;sale."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan stiffened perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Blackmail? Certainly! You can buy it, or
Major Grandchamps, your fastidious kinsman,
within forty-eight hours. Otherwise a copy of it,
attested, will be mailed to every family in your
aristocratic circle before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is your price?" interrupted Madame

<!-- page 69 -->

de Laussan curtly. Cortland, hardened as he was,
dropped his eyes before the undisguised contempt
in hers. But his effrontery returned immediately.</p>

<p>"My price? The document goes dirt-cheap
to the owner of the de Laussan diamonds, which
the Yankee captain failed to find! My price is
twenty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan's hand on the back of the
chair beside her tightened its grasp; her throat
contracted; she remained silent. Cortland, amazed
at his own audacity, watched her, in a panic lest
he had, after all, overreached himself.</p>

<p>"I will give you fifteen thousand dollars."</p>

<p>The words came in the even, measured voice
which the speaker was wont to use. The man
recognized finality in the business-like tone.
"After all," he reflected, "fifteen thousand is
not bad. Gad, I can splurge on what is left after
my debts of honor&mdash;Besides, there may be another
throw."</p>

<p>"The letter is worth twice that sum, madame,"
he said aloud. "But considering the anguish you
suffered&mdash;forty years ago&mdash;at the hands of my
father, I accept&mdash;as a compromise&mdash;your offer."</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>A movement of the head indicated the assent
of his victim.</p>

<p>"It is now eleven o'clock,"&mdash;he took out his
watch,&mdash;"eleven o'clock, Tuesday. At this hour
on Saturday next,&mdash;giving you, as you see, plenty
of time,&mdash;I will, as the collectors say, call again.
Or stay, I have an engagement at that hour.
Shall we say three in the afternoon? Very well.
Pray present my compliments to Miss No&eacute;mie.
She was quite the belle at the opera last night."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan had seated herself, and,
with her face turned to the fire, was apparently
unconscious of his presence. He stood about
awkwardly. "Cash money, madame, remember!"
He tapped the letter, which gave out a
whispering rustle under his touch, and returned
it to his pocket. He took out his cigarette case.
To his own astonishment, he found himself
ashamed to light the cigarette between his teeth.
He swaggered to the door, but came back and
planted himself, feet wide apart, on the rug beside
the armchair and its occupant. "Say," he
said, looking down at the still figure, "on second
thoughts, I will take that money in two payments.

three o'clock; seven and a half thousand&mdash;let
me see&mdash;this is November seventeenth; December,
January,"&mdash;he checked the months off on
his fingers,&mdash;"the remaining seven and a half
thousand at the end of five months, namely, on
the seventeenth of April, nineteen hundred and
three, at three o'clock in the afternoon. In the
mean time," he added insolently, "my footing
in the house will remain&mdash;undisturbed."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan had reached the limit of
endurance; she touched a bell. "Conduct monsieur,"
she said to the man servant when he appeared.
"Until Saturday, Monsieur Cortland,"
she added, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p class="small">A FRUITLESS STROLL</p>

</div>

<p>MAXIME ALLARD, Captain U. S. A.,
walked with a loitering step, unusual to
him, along Rue Royale. He stopped to gaze into
the show-windows of <i>monts de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</i>, seeming to
the passers-by, doubtless, to be speculating on the
history of necklet, prayer-beads, or pendant earring,&mdash;plainly
once the property of some reduced
gentlewoman of the Quarter. He glanced in the
antique shops which line the way of the ancient
thoroughfare; he lingered on one corner to buy
a boutonni&egrave;re, and upon another to bandy compliments
with the leathery-looking Toto, praline-seller,
whom he remembered from his Jesuit
College days. He made small headway in his
journey, wherever that might tend. The truth
is, the youthful officer was following Hope, the
bright-footed, often, alas, the deceitful. It was
but reasonable to suppose&mdash;given an afternoon
like this, with a hazy, lazy sun overhead, and a

<!-- page 73 -->

Gulf wind just moist enough to freshen her
cheeks&mdash;that Miss Carrington would be abroad.
He walked back, a block or two, toward Canal
Street, rapidly, as if he had forgotten something,
or left his umbrella against a counter, and
returned loitering as before, buying a fresh
boutonni&egrave;re and dropping other nickels into
Toto's basket. Finally, with a glance of discouragement
at the de Laussan mansion across
the way, particularly at those upper windows
(closed) which might be No&eacute;mie's own, he walked
on. It was possible&mdash;he hastened his steps at
the thought&mdash;that No&eacute;mie might be in the
Cathedral St. Louis. He smiled, remembering a
devout little No&eacute;mie, giving thanks before the
altar for the recovery of her doll from the
measles, for the return of Sir&egrave;ne's lost St. Joseph
in his leaden box, for the lesson learned, the scale
accomplished! But No&eacute;mie was not in the dim
old cathedral. The promenade had now become
aimless. "It will not be for to-day," the captain
at last admitted with a sigh. At that moment,
glancing along a side street, he saw the de Laussan
carriage with its dun-colored horses, 'Polyte
on the box, waiting, doubtless, for Miss Carrington

<!-- page 74 -->

at her dressmaker's. He strolled nonchalantly
along the opposite banquette. But, certainly,
No&eacute;mie would be coming out presently!</p>

<p>The thought had hardly leaped exultant into
his mind when the door, which he watched from
the corner of his eye, opened, and Madame de
Laussan appeared, leaning upon the arm of Sir&egrave;ne;
it seemed to Allard that she leaned heavily.
A middle-aged man accompanied her, bareheaded,
to the carriage; he leaned in after her to place
on the seat beside her an oblong packet. Sir&egrave;ne
entered the carriage, the door closed, and the
horses moved away. The man stood on his door-step
until the carriage turned the corner, then
passed up the steps of the house, a tall brick
building whose quaint iron-railed balconies hung
over the street. Allard's eyes came back to the
opposite door; he gave an involuntary start of
surprise. The man entering leisurely was Th&eacute;ophile
Bandrot, the well-known money-lender.
Why, thought Allard, why should Madame de
Laussan, whose affairs were in the hands of so
sound and astute a lawyer as Alcide Paturin, be
visiting the money-lender? and at his own house,
as if upon some business demanding a secrecy

<!-- page 75 -->

his office could not guarantee? Why should
Madame de Laussan, at her advanced age, be
out on such an errand? Bandrot was honest
enough, doubtless, but, like his kind in general,
unquestionably sharp. After all, Madame de
Laussan might reasonably wish to drop some of
her own money into the fire,&mdash;a foolishly expensive
gift to No&eacute;mie, or a loan to that gay spendthrift,
F&eacute;lix Monplaisir,&mdash;without having to
enter into explanations with old Paturin!</p>

<p>On his way back to Canal Street, he was rewarded
for his promenade&mdash;and chagrined&mdash;by
an all too brief glimpse of Hope in visible form.
She was in an open landau with some people
whom he did not know. She gave him a pretty
bow in passing.</p>

<p>A little later, the h&ocirc;tel de Laussan, which for
the time being ceased to interest him, came into
view. A young man, whom he vaguely remembered
as having seen somewhere, was entering the
street door. Allard rather envied the ease with
which the stranger passed over the threshold and
stepped along the corridor.</p>

<p>The stranger was Cortland; and this was Saturday,
three o'clock.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch07">

<p>VII</p>

<p class="small">AT PETITPAIN'S</p>

</div>

<p>PETITPAIN stood somewhat apart, hunched
against one of the enormous heaps of dusty
French prints, sheet music, newspapers bound
and unbound, school atlases, and the like, which
cluttered the floor of his shop. He regarded
with gloomy and jealous eyes the two customers
who had pounced upon a vellum copy of Theocritus,
dragging it with profane hands from its
shelf, and were turning its yellowed pages, their
heads close together. The old bookseller's shoulders
worked convulsively, and from time to time
he extended a bony hand as if to possess himself
by violence of the book.</p>

<p>It is a fact well known to the French Quarter
that Petitpain will sell you a (second-hand) copy
of "Le Ma&icirc;tre des Forges," or of "L'Assommoir,"
or even of the "Legendes des Si&egrave;cles;" he will
exchange with amiable alacrity old schoolbooks
and maps for other old schoolbooks and maps.
Petitpain's second-hand bookshop, at the beginning

<!-- page 77 -->

of the school year, may be said, indeed, to
rival in feverish activity the Cotton Exchange,
or the Sugar Market! Such crowding in and
elbowing about of the blue-clad pupils of the
Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur and the gray-clad students of the
Jesuits; such shrill altercations between the orphans
and half-orphans of the Holy Family and
the small swashbucklers of the Parochial School;
such squabbling between L'&Eacute;cole St. Jean and
L'Acad&eacute;mie Priv&eacute;e of Madame Vve Rivoire; such
battles royal over <i>mappes-de-monde</i>; such sudden
and unaccountable relapses into decorum and
<i>camaraderie</i>, followed by such clamors of appeal
to Monsieur Petitpain, hard-bestead where he
stands under volleys of supplicating voices, and
even battering-rams of curly little heads! It
might well be imagined that the bookseller,
scowling yonder at his two customers, would at
such times breathe enough fire and slaughter to
burn up his own shop and decimate the schools
of the <i>Vieux Carr&eacute;</i>, Not a bit of it! Petitpain,
presiding over the destinies of chattering grade-climbers,
is as nearly benignant as a dried-up bag
of bachelor-bones can be. <i>Mais, c'est un ange,
ce cher Monsieur Petitpain!</i></p>

<!-- page 78 -->

<p>Petitpain confronting the invader who has
had the temerity to offer to buy one of his real
books, ah, <i>c'est autre chose, &ccedil;a</i>. God knows what
he is keeping them for, those myriads of volumes
of all sorts and conditions of paper and parchment,
black-letter and illumination, tumbled promiscuously
about untidy nooks, and piled upon
unreachable shelves. Collectors say that the lot
would fetch a tidy sum,&mdash;enough to "keep"
Petitpain for the rest of his days; or rather it
should be stated that collectors have in times
past said this; nowadays these sharp-nosed individuals
have no chance at Petitpain's treasures;
Petitpain has eyes in the back of his head for a
collector; his shutters have been known to stay
up for three days upon the mere casual "good-morning"
(with a rapier-like dart of the connoisseur-eye
about the shop) of a collector. It is
believed in Frenchtown that Petitpain will rather
starve than sell a fraction of one of those never-opened
books, which he loves as if they were the
children he has never had.</p>

<p>The old man continued to glare offensively at
Miss Carrington and Captain Allard, who remained
utterly oblivious of his presence even; they were

<!-- page 79 -->

perhaps equally unmindful of the discolored leaves
they turned. The day without was lowering;
the wide, low-ceilinged shop was laid in gray
shadows, deepening with the waning afternoon.
The young couple, over against the dark old man,
lean and bent, and surrounded by musty pyramids
of books and mountains of unsorted rubbish,
were like chance visitants from some distant,
radiant world. They looked at each other
across the fat little Theocritus.</p>

<p>"Theocritus," remarked Allard, finally aware of
Petitpain's existence. "I will buy the jolly little
beggar of a book, No&eacute;&mdash;Miss Carrington, because&mdash;"
He left the sentence unfinished, but
his eyes said plainly, "because I found you by
chance in this heavenly shop."</p>

<p>"How much, monsieur?" he asked, turning to
the proprietor.</p>

<p>"That? That is not worth the consideration
of a gentleman like you, Monsieur le Capitaine."</p>

<p>Petitpain strove to hide his anxiety, remembering
the days when le petit Allard never failed to
carry off, under anybody's nose, what he wanted
out of that shop! He took the book out of

<!-- page 80 -->

Allard's hand, and thrust it into his own coat
pocket. "Monsieur Maxime and Mademoiselle
Carr-rreeng-ton will prefer, I am sure,&mdash;" his eyes
roved vaguely about,&mdash;"this. But, certainly,"&mdash;he
darted upon a large, much-soiled copy of
Buffon's "Natural History," and held it out
almost supplicatingly.</p>

<p>"Not at all," remonstrated Allard, "I&mdash;mademoiselle
prefers Theocritus."</p>

<p>"Theocritus is not for sale, monsieur," snorted
Petitpain. He retired to the rear of the shop,
whence he kept a wary eye upon le petit Allard,
who was capable, oh, but of any villainy, <i>mon
Dieu!</i></p>

<p>Allard had already forgotten Theocritus. "I
can hardly believe my own good luck," he was
saying for the third or fourth time; "I have
fairly haunted Royal Street from opera night to
opera night, in the hope of seeing you. Last
night you were not in your box, and I, blockhead
that I was, had stayed away from the Heron
dance, and, behold, you were at the Heron dance.
But now, when I had almost given up ever seeing
you again, I find you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Royal Street," smiled No&eacute;mie.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p>"Blessed Royal Street!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Maxime!" cried No&eacute;mie suddenly, "why
did you go to West Point? Why did you enter
that United States Army?"</p>

<p>"Why?" Allard's head went up proudly.
"Because I wished to serve my country. For,
look you, No&eacute;mie, we are all one country now.
My father fought for the Confederacy; so did
yours. They served their country; why should
I not serve my country and theirs?"</p>

<p>"How brave you are!" cried No&eacute;mie, brightening.
"Also, I think you are right. But why
should I say it! My opinion means nothing to
you. You do not come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie!" Allard's reproachful tone was
tempered by rapture. "Don't you see? You
know that when my father allowed me to enter
West Point, l'oncle Grandchamps was outraged;
he said that my father had disgraced his record
as a Confederate soldier; my father said that Major
Grandchamps was a coward and a <i>polisson</i>,"&mdash;Allard
laughed a little ruefully. "The two old
fellows, who had slept under the same blanket,
and fought side by side all through our Civil
War, were ready to cut one another's throats.

<!-- page 82 -->

They are at it yet, bless 'em! Major Grandchamps
says that the doors of the famille Grandchamps,
far and near, are closed to the famille
Allard, far and near. There we are. I find it
all absurd myself, but I stand by the famille
Allard. Besides," he sighed, "I am sure my
uniform would make me hateful to the eyes of
Madame de Laussan&mdash;dear tante Laure. But,"
he brightened, "the Grandchamps-Allard feud
does not keep me from being friends, and fast
friends, with Jeanne Berthet, and F&eacute;lix Monplaisir,
and the others; it need not keep me from
lov&mdash;from liking you, need it? Anyway, I spend
much of the time which belongs of right to my
Uncle Sam,"&mdash;No&eacute;mie looked mystified,&mdash;"the
United States Government, I mean, hanging
around in the hope of seeing you."</p>

<p>"Tom Masters is going up to his uncle's
plantation next week," No&eacute;mie remarked, with
apparent irrelevancy.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Allard, taken aback and a little
chilled by the abrupt change in the conversation.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie, whose eyes were fixed on a stunted
fig tree in Petitpain's courtyard, continued, "I

<!-- page 83 -->

am having a sugarhouse party at Lady's Rule
next week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Allard.</p>

<p>"Jeanne is going, and Frances Heron, and
F&eacute;lix Monplaisir, and perhaps Mr. Strang. Madame
Berthet, my cousin, will chaperone the
party. Mr. Cortland also goes."</p>

<p>"Cortland!" echoed Allard. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why?" said No&eacute;mie gayly. "Why? Is not
Mr. Cortland handsome? Is he not fascinating?
Is he not&mdash; The truth is, Maxime, though Mr.
Cortland is all this, I should not myself have
thought of including him. But my grandmother,
who has been very feeble, really ill, indeed, this
past fortnight, has asked him. She has requested
me to be 'nice' to him"&mdash;she dropped into
English for the word. "Dear me, I must be
going; or Sir&egrave;ne will be haunting Royal Street&mdash;like
some one else." She smiled bewitchingly.
"You may walk with me as far as the Cathedral.
I am making a novena."</p>

<p>"For&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"For the softening of l'oncle Grandchamps'
heart."</p>

<p>Petitpain came to the door and peered after

<!-- page 84 -->

them as they walked away. He had taken the
fat little book from his pocket, and was caressing
it with a lean palm.</p>

<p>"But, he is a madman, le petit Allard," he
muttered; "Theocritus!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 85 -->

<div class="center" id="ch08">

<p>VIII</p>

<p class="small">AT LADY'S RULE</p>

</div>

<p>"WHO wishes to tour the sugarhouse this
morning?" demanded No&eacute;mie Carrington,
from the doorway of the music room at
Lady's Rule. She stood on the threshold, a-tip-toe,
like a bird poised for flight.</p>

<p>"I do," cried Frances Heron, springing to her
feet, her thimble, scissors, and embroidery frame
dropping with a clatter to the bare floor.</p>

<p>"I do," echoed Jeanne Berthet, swinging
slowly around on the piano stool.</p>

<p>Monplaisir nodded without raising his eyes
from his newspaper.</p>

<p>Donald Strang, touching the strings of his guitar,
finished the bit of song on his lip:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>La vie est br&egrave;ve:<br/>

Un peu d'espoir,<br/>

Un peu de r&ecirc;ve,<br/>

Et puts&mdash;bonsoir</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>His eyes twinkled; "Lead on, mesdemoiselles;
where the roses go, there follows the bee."</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p>Cortland lounged forward; he contrived without
saying a word to convey the impression that
the "tour" had been planned between himself
and the young chatelaine of Lady's Rule; he
placed himself beside her with an air of comradeship
as they all came out upon the wide, white-pillared
gallery of the plantation house.</p>

<p>The smell of boiling sugar floated out, warm
and sweet, from the sugarhouse beyond the intervening
grounds.</p>

<p>"How it is delicious, that smell!" said Jeanne,
her little nose sniffing the air.</p>

<p>The crispness of a mid-December forenoon
was fast yielding to the warmth of the climbing
sun; but dewdrops still glistened, diamond-wise,
upon the unshorn grass-blades on the lawn
which sloped gently down to the reedy edge of
Bayou Noir; they ran in glistening rivulets from
the broad-fringed banana leaves shading the Long
Walk with the lily-pool at the farther end.
From the sugarhouse, and from the canefields
stretching out to the horizon, there came the
subdued echoes of pounding machinery, and the
steady <i>whoof! whoof!</i> of the smoke leaping in
black jets from the huge chimneys; and the mingled

<!-- page 87 -->

clatter of harness and whip-snap, the creak of
high-wheeled cane wagons, the shouts of overseers,
and the far-away rhythmic chorus of the
cane-cutters.</p>

<p>Donald Strang's eyes brooded over the scene;
he made a tentative step toward his easel, set up
on a corner of the gallery with a virgin canvas
upon it; but he thought better of it. "<i>Un pen
de r&ecirc;ve</i>," he chanted under his breath, following
No&eacute;mie.</p>

<p>In the rose-garden toward the rear of the
house Uncle Mink was singing monotonously to
the thump of his spade:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>I met a 'possum in de road;<br/>

He 'umble 'peared to be;<br/>

He scrape' his foot an' bow' his haid,<br/>

An' gin de road to me</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As No&eacute;mie and her guests descended the steps,
Madame Berthet came around the corner of the
gallery, garden shears in hand. "No&eacute;mie, my
child," she drawled, "you really must speak to
Uncle Mink. He has been seeing double in the
Quarters. Zette is so terrified that she has left
her ironing and is hiding under the cabin. The
housekeeper is furious. I am furious myself."</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>"You certainly look it, poor dear," laughed
No&eacute;mie, stooping to drop a kiss on Madame's
bared head as she passed. "Don't worry,
<i>marraine</i>. Run along to your <i>pot pourri</i>. I
will attend to Uncle Mink." She flitted away.</p>

<p>The singing ceased abruptly; it was followed,
judging from echoed tones and an occasional out-drifted
word, by an argument in which the old
man was plainly worsted. His mistress presently
reappeared, gayly caroling the forbidden ditty:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>I met a 'possum in de road;<br/>

He 'umble 'peared to be</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Beg pardon, Miss Carrington," called a voice
from behind the high cherokee rose-hedge, as
they approached the division gate. "Is that sarcastic
allusion meant for me? or, by chance, for
the arrogant Allard, U. S. A.?"</p>

<p>Two horsemen, who had dismounted and tossed
their bridle-reins to a grinning pair of pickaninnies,
appeared in the gateway.</p>

<p>"You arrive apropos!" Miss Carrington nodded
a neighborly greeting to Masters and lifted
surprised eyes at Allard. "When did you come?"
she asked the latter ingenuously, "and how delightful
for us that you should 'happen up' to

<!-- page 89 -->

Godiva Plantation, as old Mr. Masters would say,
while we are at Lady's Rule; or <i>are</i> you at
Godiva?"</p>

<p>Allard explained elaborately that government
service had brought him for twenty-four hours
into the neighborhood. "Tom's uncle was kind
enough to take me in," he concluded, "although
the old gentleman disapproves of my
uniform."</p>

<p>"He, too!" commented Strang. "Really, Maxime,
my friend, it begins to look as if you might
yet be called out by a battalion of Confederate
graybeards."</p>

<p>"The first right belongs, it appears&mdash;according
to the code&mdash;to the colonel, my father, as
head of the house," laughed Allard. "He and
Major Grandchamps have been perilously near
an encounter over the matter <i>Allard fils</i> more
than once these several years. By Jove, I honestly
believe those gray old boys are itching to stick
one another with the <i>colichemardes</i> of <i>dans le
temps</i>." His mirth held the under-thought of a
sigh. The presence of Cortland at Lady's Rule,
on a footing so familiar, disturbed him by its
contrast to his own momentary, half-surreptitious

<!-- page 90 -->

advent there. He was too straightforward to
deny even to himself his awakening jealousy of
Cortland.</p>

<p>"Why is this plantation called Lady's Rule?"
asked Miss Heron, as they all moved on.</p>

<p>"Why? It used to be Rose-Marie Plantation,"
replied Masters, "or was it Blanche? Something,
anyway, which suggested the dove-eyed Lady
who bides at home and makes orange-flower conserve,
while her Lord goes down to that wicked
New Orleans to sell his crop."</p>

<p>"How the <i>id&eacute;e am&eacute;ricaine</i> is different! as
Mademoiselle Berthet would put it," remarked
Strang. "Mr. Richard Carrington&mdash;doubtless
with prophetic eyes&mdash;foresaw that the present
mistress of the plantation would be a&mdash;in short,
a termagant. Therefore he changed its name to
one more in keeping with her character. He called
it Lady's Rule."</p>

<p>The mistress of Lady's Rule made a face at
him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Jeanne," said Allard, "let me see the color
of your eyes. Ah, dove-colored! I thought so.
Masters would like to inquire whether you are&mdash;also&mdash;an
adept at orange conserve."</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>"For myself," cried Donald, "I prefer the
style termagant&mdash;with a plantation, of course."
He touched the guitar strings as he spoke, and
trolled on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Dot 'umble 'possum bow' his haid<br/>

An' made a cunjer-sign.<br/>

"I kin lay low an' wait," he say,<br/>

"Ontwel de yearth is mine."</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Me, I find that 'possum a most intelligent
beast," mused Jeanne aloud; "he has the knowledge
to lie low and wait. That is what you call
a lesson, <i>hein?</i>"</p>

<p>Allard felt suddenly light of heart. He stole
a glance at the speaker. But her eyes were fixed
upon Cortland.</p>

<p>Cortland, on the appearance of the visitors
from Godiva, had withdrawn into the black-browed
silence which he instinctively felt to be
his stronghold, and which, he had long ago
learned, gave him a mysterious charm in the eyes
of women. Nevertheless he raged inwardly at his
inability to add his part to the light chaff floating
airily about him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Masters," said No&eacute;mie, when they had
crossed the threshold of the vast sugarhouse,

<!-- page 92 -->

"you are fresh from centrifugals and 'takes;'
my guests are thirsting for information. Please
see that they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enter with the cane, and come out with
the commodity? I will," smiled Masters. He
led the way in company with the manager of
Lady's Rule, who had come forward to meet
them.</p>

<p>"As a mere woman," observed No&eacute;mie, "I
disapprove of science in sugar-making, and yearn
backward for the open kettle and <i>cuite</i>. As a
planter, I am of course ready, after the fashion of
my fellow planters, to spend everything I make
each year on experimental and expensive machinery
for the next (possible) crop."</p>

<p>The manager, a careworn man of middle age,
smiled understandingly at his employer.</p>

<p>"Here," explained Masters, mainly for the
benefit of Miss Heron and Cortland, who had
never seen the process, "is the beginning." They
had reentered the long, open shed flanked by bulwarks
of high-wheeled cane-wagons. The inclined
platform into which the shining stalks of purple
and yellow cane were flung fresh from the fields
mounted endlessly toward the enormous crushers

<!-- page 93 -->

on the second floor of the sugarhouse. Thence,
past rushing rivers of grass-green cane juice,
along monstrous vats where the boiling juice
foamed and seethed beneath overlying clouds of
white vapor, around towering centrifugals filled
with whirling masses of chemically-changing
ooze, Masters brought the group at length to the
shafts whose mouths were spitting sugar&mdash;warm,
white, moist&mdash;into the barrels on the ground-floor
far below. He turned to put a question to
a grimy workman. Allard leaped past him with
white face and staring eyes.</p>

<p>The plaited skirt of No&eacute;mie Carrington's light
woolen gown, caught, as if by an invisible hand,
had fluttered out, and curled itself about a flying
band which whirled from one gigantic wheel to
another. The girl's slight form, drawn after it,
was jerked violently upward; her long hair, loosed
from its fastenings, whipped like flames about
her face and neck, then shot out as if magnetized.
Quicker than thought, Allard's arms were about
her; he threw himself backward with a force
which tore the skirt from its belt and ripped it
with a snap from top to hem. The pale-gray
folds, among which glistened a few hairs like

<!-- page 94 -->

threads of gold, spun along the belting, and disappeared,
a blackened wad, among the spokes of
the flying wheels.</p>

<p>The slight figure lay inert for a moment on
Allard's breast, the disheveled head drooped to
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Your pretty gown, No&eacute;mie," cried Jeanne,
hysterically, after an awed silence. The trivial
remark restored speech to the others.</p>

<p>"Lady's Rule owes me a new one!" declared
No&eacute;mie, with forced gayety. She shuddered,
averting her eyes from the huge band. "I am
not fit to be a sugar-planter if I cannot keep out
of mischief in my own sugarhouse." She looked
down at the disarray of her attire, and a flush of
embarrassment rose to her pallid cheek. "I am
not even a presentable chatelaine."</p>

<p>At the door of the music room she swayed unexpectedly,
and would have fallen. Allard again
caught her in his strong arms, and carried her to
a couch.</p>

<p>Cortland, who had sprung forward too late, saw
the look in her beautiful eyes lifted to Allard's
face. He felt a curious sensation; a shock had
passed through him, leaving him inwardly

<!-- page 95 -->

stunned. He had discovered, for the first time in
his life, that to greed might be added another
passion, perhaps even more overpowering. He
found himself in love with No&eacute;mie Carrington.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 96 -->

<div class="center" id="ch09">

<p>IX</p>

<p class="small">SEEING DOUBLE</p>

</div>

<p>THE same night the house-party, augmented
by the two bachelors from Godiva Plantation,
was assembled again in the music room at
Lady's Rule. Mademoiselle Berthet was, as usual,
at the piano; Donald Strang, bending over her,
hummed in an undertone an accompaniment to
the chords which grew under her skilled fingers.
Masters, playing at backgammon with Madame
Berthet, gloomed from time to time with open
envy toward the artist; his partner, using her
plump fingers as an adding machine, smiled slyly,
affecting not to notice. The young hostess, still
a little pale from the adventure of the morning,
made the centre of a small group, from which Miss
Heron and Monplaisir presently drifted away.</p>

<p>Allard was unaccountably silent. "It must be
confessed," thought No&eacute;mie, "that silence is not
so becoming to Maxime as it is to Mr. Cortland;
decidedly it is not his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>. Cortland is as

<!-- page 97 -->

impassive and unconscious in his dumbness as an
Oriental. Maxime in his is fidgety and self-conscious;
I wonder what is the matter with him."</p>

<p>She glanced furtively from one to the other
seated on either hand.</p>

<p>Her reflections were disturbed by the entrance
of Big Hannah, a sort of under-housekeeper,
and the martinet of the negro quarters. She was
one of the old Carrington slaves, brought out
from Virginia by Richard Carrington when he
purchased and stocked the war-dismantled plantation
on Bayou Noir, which he rechristened
Lady's Rule. She was also the grandmother of
Little Hannah, Uncle Mink's latest "bride."</p>

<p>Big Hannah's high turban was a-quiver with
indignation; her dark, old face wore a scowl
seldom seen outside of the world over which she
presided in unquestionable authority. "Miss No-<i>mee</i>,
honey!" She addressed her young mistress,
before whom she stood in respectful attitude,
with the affectionate familiarity of the hereditary
family servant. "You better sen' down to de
Quarters for ole Mink. He settin' in a cheer in
Tildy's cabin wi' Li'l Hannah 'longside him,
fair turrifyin' dem fool niggers out'n deir senses."</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p>"You see, No&eacute;mie, <i>mon enfant</i>" said Madame
Berthet, looking up from the backgammon board,
"if you <i>will</i> treat Uncle Mink like a spoiled
child! He really ought to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Torn limb from limb, eh, Madame Berthet?"
concluded Strang.</p>

<p>"Why, Donald!" cried the literal little person;
"I would not countenance anything so cruel!"</p>

<p>"Send Uncle Mink to me, Aunt Hannah. At
once," directed No&eacute;mie. "I really don't know
how to punish Uncle Mink," she sighed, "unless
I take away his fiddle&mdash;which would break his
dear old heart."</p>

<p>"What has the old devil been doing?" asked
Masters.</p>

<p>"He has been 'seeing double,' " laughed No&eacute;mie,
"whatever that is."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" murmured Monplaisir, "if
men are to be punished for seeing double, what
will become of the purveyors of&mdash;champagne!"</p>

<p>"If a man is to be punished for seeing double,"
repeated Masters dreamily, "I fear Donald's
guitar will be hung up with Uncle Mink's fiddle."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> seeing double?" queried Frances
Heron.</p>

<!-- page 99 -->

<p>"To tell the truth, I hardly know," returned
No&eacute;mie, "although I have known of Uncle
Mink's gift ever since I could remember. I fancy
it is something like second sight, or throwing
the wanga. However it may be, the spell, as he
calls it, or the 'sperret,' comes upon him at irregular
intervals. It never fails to throw the Quarters
here, or the kitchen in town, into a panic.
I sometimes suspect that the old fellow is after
this result."</p>

<p>"How exciting!" cried Frances. "I feel myself
shivering on the edge of a voodoo rite. Do
let us see the prophet perform."</p>

<p>Jeanne shrieked. "But no! He will have
snakes in his basket. They call themselves brothers
to snakes. I know! My <i>bonne</i> used to make
<i>gri-gri!</i>"</p>

<p>A shuffling footstep sounded on the rear
gallery; a porti&egrave;re was drawn aside, and Big
Hannah reappeared, ushering in the culprit. He
removed a shapeless hat as he approached, ducked
his head, and scraped a conciliatory foot, rolling
his eyes until only the whites were visible beneath
his shaggy brows. "Evenin', Miss No-<i>mee</i>," he
said unctuously; "ladies an' gentermen, evenin'.

<!-- page 100 -->

Lawd! li'l miss,"&mdash;to his young mistress,&mdash;"you
cert'n'y is fitten to lead de squire o' cherry-bins,
in dat white dress!"</p>

<p>"Uncle Mink," interrupted No&eacute;mie severely,
"what did I tell you this morning in the rose-garden?"</p>

<p>"In de rose-gyarden? I disremember edzackly,
Miss No-<i>mee</i>. But I knows, in gin'r'l, dat I'ze a
po' sinner. Yassum. 'N I was down yander in
Tildy's cabin&mdash;Tildy's my secon' ma-in-law&mdash;er
while ago, rastlin' in pra'r fer strenk to get a
holt of ole black Satan, when Big Hannah&mdash;she's
my gran'ma-in-law,&mdash;she come 'sturbin'
my pra'r&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Mink," threatened No&eacute;mie again,
"what did I tell you this morning in the rose-garden?"</p>

<p>"In de rose-gyarden? Truf is, honey, hit
make a man fergetful to git married&mdash;specially
fer de sixt' time."</p>

<p>Uncle Mi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yassum. Yas'm," stammered the old man
piteously, "you done t-tole me d-d-dat you gwine
ter take erway my f-f-<i>fiddle</i> ef I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Uncle Mink," interposed Allard,

<!-- page 101 -->

"Miss Carrington will let you off this once; <i>this
once</i>, you understand, you black rascal."</p>

<p>"Yas, Marse Max, thanky, Marse Max,"&mdash;he
grinned expansively, and began backing away,
bobbing his old head and casting sidewise triumphant
glances at Big Hannah.</p>

<p>"Hold on, you old sinner!" ordered Masters;
"Miss No&eacute;mie will let you off&mdash;this once&mdash;if
you will show these young ladies how you can
throw wanga."</p>

<p>"Me! Lawd, Marse Don, I ain't never tho'd
wanga sence I jined de chu'ch."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it is you do. See double?
How do you see double?"</p>

<p>"Hit's dess disher way, Marse Don. I dess shets
my eyes, an' a pusson stan's befo' me. Den <i>ef</i> I
sees double, I sees ano'er pusson standin', behine
dat pusson lak a shadder. Seein' double, dat
means trouble," he concluded, with a wag of his
head. "I kin see thripple, too," he added darkly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Frances, springing from her seat,
"shut your eyes this minute, and see if I have a
shadow behind me."</p>

<p>The old man looked doubtfully at his mistress.
She nodded, smiling.</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>The seer folded his arms, the knotted hands
clenched; his sharp, old eyes retired into an ambush
of grizzled brows; his thick lips pushed
outward and fell apart, revealing red, well-nigh
toothless gums.</p>

<p>"No wonder the Quarters were in a commotion,"
whispered Jeanne, drawing closer to the
gathered circle.</p>

<p>Expectant silence, stirred only by the distant
<i>whoof! whoof!</i> from the sugarhouse chimney,
like the heartbeat of some giant-monster, filled
the room. "What you see, Mink?" demanded
Hannah. With the awe and hush of her voice
there mingled a suppressed note of pride, almost
of triumph. It was as if, though disapproving of
the old man's use of his gift, she exulted in his
power. "What you see, Mink?"</p>

<p>"I don't see nuttin'," was the response, received
with a sigh, half of relief, half of disappointment.
One after another stepped in front of the
thrower of the wanga; each time Big Hannah's
question brought the same answer, "I don't see
nuttin'; my mine an' my innard eyes is a vacance."</p>

<p>Came the turn of No&eacute;mie. "What you see,
Mink?"</p>

<!-- page 103 -->

<p>"I sees double! Gawd a'mighty, I sees double!
An' de shadder is <i>vig</i> black!"</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie fell back, startled in spite of herself,
uttering a sharp cry.</p>

<p>Mink opened his eyes, his old frame shook,
his raised hands beat the air. "Gawd! Hit's li'l
miss, hit's li'l miss!" he wailed. "Honey-chile,
don't you b'leeve ole Mink. He ain't nuttin' but
a liar! Gawd!"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Mink," cried No&eacute;mie soothingly;
"I am not afraid of shadows! Haven't I got
you to stand between me and any harm? Now
you just shut your eyes once more."</p>

<p>Strang and Masters presented themselves with
grimaces of pretended fright. "I don't see nuttin'."
The old man's voice had grown sullen.</p>

<p>"I sees double," he announced briefly, when
Allard stood before him. He would say no more.</p>

<p>Lastly, Cortland stepped forward; a contemptuous
smile curled his lip as he faced the seer.</p>

<p>"What you see, Mink?"</p>

<p>"I sees thripple," declared Mink solemnly;
"I sees thripple. Fo' de Lawd, I does."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" demanded Frances
curiously.</p>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>"Thripple (treble), dat mean de debble," returned
the old man, with his eyes still closed. At
the laugh which followed this announcement,
his eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"You see treble, do you?" laughed Cortland;
an angry sneer lurked behind the laugh.</p>

<p>"Yas, sir, I sees thripple," said Mink doggedly.</p>

<p>"You may go, Uncle Mink," interposed his
young mistress hastily. "Sit in your cabin door
while you play to-night," she added, laying an
affectionate hand on his arm, "so that we may
hear you."</p>

<p>"Yas'm, yas'm, li'l miss," he grinned, delighted.
"I gwine to tech up 'Billy in de low
groun' ' er 'Sugar in de gode.' Marse Dick
useter shake his foot to dem chunes. Yas'm."
He backed out, his pockets clinking with the
loose silver which had rained into his rusty
palm. Big Hannah followed, scowling again,
under her turban.</p>

<p>"Me, I prefer serpents, vipers!" shivered
Jeanne. "In your place, No&eacute;mie, I should be
afraid to go to sleep with that <i>vig</i>rous shadow
lurking about!"</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

"Nonsense!" cried No&eacute;mie. "The shadow,
look you, Jeanne, is behind me. That typifies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Light ahead," finished Allard. "Besides, I
back my shadow against yours in mortal combat.
I prophesy that they will cut each other's throats."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" shouted Strang. "And yours, Cortland?
What part will they play in Miss Carrington's
life? For you must have two, you know."</p>

<p>But Cortland had again withdrawn into his
stronghold. His silence, as usual, was somehow
more impressive than the spoken words of the
others.</p>

<br/>

<p>A little later Captain Allard and Miss Carrington
strolled side by side down the banana-shaded
Long Walk to the lily-pool. A full moon rode,
glorious, the sky overhead, through myriads of
stars dimmed by her light. The flickering shadows
of the incessantly quivering banana leaves
darted from fold to fold of No&eacute;mie's white
gown; their over-bending fringes dropped dew
upon her hair. The sugarhouse, with windows
red-litten, like Poe's Haunted Palace, poured
out upon the night air its multitudinous noises,
above which, full-throated, arose from the gang

<!-- page 106 -->

about the cane-carrier a chorus, strange, rhapsodic:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Plant da' tree, Aber-ham!<br/>

Plant da' tree, Joshu-way!<br/>

<i>Zoom-ba-loom-ba!</i><br/>

Nail da' cross, Pilate!<br/>

Nail da' cross, Cai'phus!<br/>

<i>Zoom-ba-loom-ba!</i><br/>

Tone da' bell, Ma-ry!<br/>

Tone da' bell, Mar-thy!<br/>

<i>Zoom-ba-loom-ba!<br/>

Zoom!</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Like a thin, faint undertone, the wailing of
Mink's fiddle trailed up from the Quarters.</p>

<p>"Maxime," the girl's voice trembled, breaking
an inexplicable silence, "I have not said anything
to you about this morning because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't," Allard interrupted, "don't say anything.
I do not wish to remember&mdash;this morning.
I am trying to forget how near you were to&mdash;"
he shuddered involuntarily. "Besides," he continued
before she could speak, "there is so
much that I wish to say. It is my time to talk
now. I am going back to the city to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>She uttered an exclamation; he hurried on:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I have so few opportunities of seeing
you&mdash;like this. Do you know, No&eacute;mie, that it

<!-- page 107 -->

was here, at Lady's Rule&mdash;though it had not
yet become Lady's Rule&mdash;at a ball, that my
father asked my mother to marry him? Perhaps
it was in this very Long Walk that&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was such meaning in his voice, such
significance in his abrupt pause, that No&eacute;mie's
face flamed scarlet.</p>

<p>"Is that true?" she stammered. "How <i>dear!</i>"
she added more naturally. "Come, captain, let
us go in. I am neglecting my duties shamefully."</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie! "He put out a detaining hand.
"No&eacute;mie!" His voice had become very grave.
He faced her, the lily-pool, in its curb of marble
like a silver mirror under the moon, at their feet.
"You know already that I love you. You have
known it since we were boy and girl together
playing at <i>grand cordonnier</i> in the courtyard
yonder in town, or sailing paper ships across this
very pool. I have never told you in so many
words how much I love you. Need I now?
Neither have I before told you in so many words
that I want you to be my wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Max," she prayed, in a low tone and
with averted face.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>"You are forgetting the famous feud, Captain
Allard," she cried, with forced gayety.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;?" he repeated sternly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Max!" she pleaded again; "you must
not. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught her hands in his and compelled her
to look at him. "Is there any one else?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do&mdash;not know," she breathed.</p>

<p>"You knew, or I thought you did, less than a
week ago, when I thought I had found heaven in
a dingy bookshop in Royal Street." His tone
was tinged with bitterness. He had dropped her
hands. "It is Cortland," he said quietly, after a
pause. "I do not believe he is worthy of you,
No&eacute;mie. But then, no man is&mdash;I least of all.
So you are to be married? When?"</p>

<p>She had made a movement as if to speak in
answer to his first sentence. Now she threw up
her head proudly. "You have no right to ask
such a question, Captain Allard. But I tell you,
because it is my pleasure to do so, that Mr. Cortland
has not asked me to marry him."</p>

<p>Allard drew a long breath. "Then I give
you warning," he said, "that I, Maxime Allard,

<!-- page 109 -->

shall ask you again to marry me&mdash;and again&mdash;and
again, until you tell me that you are promised
to Cortland, or another. So long as you
are free, No&eacute;mie."</p>

<p>They stood a moment in silence, a flushed and
angry girl and a cool and determined man. Then
the girl, within whose heart Allard's open declaration
had set into motion a whirl of hitherto
unsuspected emotions,&mdash;affirmations, denials,
questionings, memories, dreams,&mdash;softened suddenly.
She put out her hand. "I cannot quarrel
with my oldest friend and comrade, can I?
You have been most impertinent, Captain Allard.
L'oncle Grandchamps would set that down
to your uniform! But, Max! I seem to <i>see</i> our
little long-ago selves setting our wee-bit ships
afloat in this old pond, and Myself tumbling in
head-foremost, and Yourself jumping in to pull
me out."</p>

<p>"And Yourself getting scolded for spoiling
your frock, and Myself well flogged for leading
your Ladyship into mischief," he chuckled.</p>

<p>"I wasn't worth it!" she challenged gayly,
the danger overpast. In truth, she longed, woman-like,
to recall the danger.</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>"Maybe not," he returned enigmatically. They
went slowly up the Long Walk to the house.</p>

<p>"Remember! again&mdash;and again&mdash;and again,"
he said, as they mounted the steps; "wait one
moment. Do you hear what Uncle Mink is picking
out of his fiddle?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>" '<i>I kin lay low an' wait,' he say,<br/>

'Ontwel de yearth is mine</i>.' "</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He stood looking after her as she flitted
down the hall.</p>

<p>Cortland, on the gallery, leaning against a white,
fluted column, also looked after her. Then his
eyes swept the rich expanse of field and park,
orchards, gardens, sugarhouse, and out-buildings,
and came back to the Great House itself.
The pale-blue orbs, between their narrowed lids,
had taken on the glitter which meant greed; but
the other something was also present, accentuating
the fire-like sparks in the small pupils, and
deepening the sensual lines in the unguarded
face.</p>

<p>Strang touched Allard on the shoulder with a
light forefinger; they stood, themselves unseen,
in the shadow of upreaching rose-vines. "If
Mademoiselle Berthet prefers vipers," whispered

<!-- page 111 -->

Donald, "here might be one to her liking! Look
at him! What in the devil's name is Madame de
Laussan thinking of! The smooth scoundrel
makes me ill!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 112 -->

<div class="center" id="ch10">

<p>X</p>

<p class="small">A POSTPONEMENT</p>

</div>

<p>SIR&Egrave;NE, crouched at the foot of a pedestal
which supported a bronze statue of Zenobia,
followed the agitated movements of her mistress
with great, yellow eyes whose anguish belied the
impassivity of her face beneath the knotted
tignon. The high-backed chair of Madame de
Laussan, with the embroidered tabouret before
it, was set near an open window; the inblown
lace curtains made a soft, swishing sound on the
bare floor. There was an illuminated Book of
Hours upon the small table against the chair-arm;
a filmy lace handkerchief, faintly perfumed with
<i>vite et vert</i>, marked the page where the reader
had left off. A tall crystal vase beside it held a
single full-blown magnolia, whose golden heart,
within the waxen petals, was ceaselessly a-quiver.
Madame de Laussan paced the library with halting
steps&mdash;for she had grown visibly feebler during
these past few months&mdash;from one cabinet to

<!-- page 113 -->

another, peering with unseeing eyes through the
glass doors, touching here and there, with absent
fingers, some well-remembered trifle. Her ears
were strained toward the bell, unaccountably
silent, on the distant street door. She pressed
against her bosom, with one pale hand, a slim
package; this she examined from time to time,
even removing the bank-notes from their envelope
to count them over again with feverish haste.</p>

<p>"You are sure, Sir&egrave;ne, that to-day is the seventeenth?"</p>

<p>"But yes, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse, very sure."</p>

<p>"Of April, Sir&egrave;ne?"</p>

<p>"But certainly, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse. Courage, <i>mon
ange</i>. The letter will be in your hands soon,
soon." The smile that lighted her sombre face
brought an answering smile to the eyes regarding
her from across the room.</p>

<p>"Me," continued Sir&egrave;ne, a savage sharpness
thrusting itself like a dagger-point into her mellow
voice, "me, when we have paid him our clean
money, which will become dirty as soon as he
touches it, I will see to it that the Grand Zombi
pays him too! But, yes! The bones of that
assassin shall melt like wax, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse. The

<!-- page 114 -->

blood of his heart will go thin, thin, thin&mdash;like
moonlight! For the bat will sit in his heart, the
sucking bat! Wanga! Wanga!" She twisted
her long, lithe arms above her head; red flames
burned in her eyes. "Aie! Aie! I would have
killed him long ago, the monster, if I had known
where he keeps that letter."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan still stood with one hand
grasping the back of a chair, the other guarding
the envelope; her eyes were fixed upon the mulattress,
but the wild words fell upon unheeding
ears.</p>

<p>"It is already past the hour, Sir&egrave;ne. He will
not&mdash;" But stay, was not that a familiar step
on the banquette below? Did it not pause at the
street door? Ah! The insistent clang of the
bell echoed along the porte coch&egrave;re, and came
noisily up the stair.</p>

<p>She greeted Cortland, when he entered, from
her accustomed chair, returning his effusive
salutation with grave politeness. At a motion of
her hand, Sir&egrave;ne glided from the room. Cortland
was himself too well versed in dissimulation not
to know that the mulattress, of whose animosity
he was well aware, had stationed herself within

<!-- page 115 -->

earshot, behind some curtain-fold or heavy
porti&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is a little later than the appointed
moment," began Madame de Laussan. "But"&mdash;she
forced a smile&mdash;"a man who has so many
social duties&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With your permission, I will seat myself,"
interrupted Cortland deliberately, suiting the
action to the word.</p>

<p>"Pardon my forgetfulness." The slight irony
in her tone was not lost upon her visitor, who,
however, appeared unconscious of its intention.
"Doubtless," continued Madame de Laussan, "I
have become rusty in manners, as you Americans
would say, since my seclusion of these past
months. While monsieur has had so abundant
opportunity of acquiring&mdash;I should say of keeping
in touch with&mdash;the graces of the <i>beau
monde</i>. Monsieur is to be congratulated on
his success in that world," she added, with a
quick urbanity awakened by a warning sigh
which floated into the room from some screened
recess.</p>

<p>"Madame de Laussan&mdash;" Cortland put aside
brusquely both irony and compliment.</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p>"I understand," Madame de Laussan hastened
tremulously to interpose; "monsieur is here
for business. Thanks for the suggestion. Then
let us proceed. Here, Monsieur Cortland,"&mdash;she
drew the crisp notes one by one from the envelope
and smoothed them out upon her knee. At
sight of them the man's eyelids narrowed until
the greenish eyes glared as through a slit; his
nostrils expanded, his fingers twitched; he moistened
his lips with the point of his tongue. The
insweeping breeze blew across the notes a fold
of Madame de Laussan's silk scarf, hiding them
from view. Cortland braced himself in his chair,
breathing heavily. Madame de Laussan, mistaking
his movement for one of impatience, hurried
on.</p>

<p>"Here, Monsieur Cortland, I have seven thousand
five hundred dollars, the second and last
payment on the debt which I&mdash;owe you." She
also breathed heavily in the effort to keep out
of her voice the least suggestion of eagerness.
"Monsieur will have the goodness to count the
money, and, by way of receipt therefor, to place
in my hands, according to agreement, a certain
letter, which&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>"Not so fast, madame, if you please." He
arose and pushed back his chair; his eyes, wide
enough now, were darting about, here, there, anywhere,
in a supreme effort to keep away from the
notes held out to him. "Put the money back in
the envelope. We want to talk this matter over&mdash;first."
His tone had become so harshly imperious
that she obeyed mechanically, lifting a white
face to his the while. He strode back and forth
the length of the room several times.</p>

<p>"I have, in fact, changed my mind," he said
at last, stopping again before her. "Don't be a
fool, woman!" He thrust his face into hers, his
hot breath scorching her cheek. The shriek died,
strangled, in her throat. "Do you, by chance,
want to bring Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie de Laussan
Carrington into our little <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te?</i> Or your
kinsman, Major Grandchamps? Both, I happen
to know, are no further away than the billiard-room.
Listen to me," he urged in a calmer tone,
though he still stood in a menacing attitude over
her; "I have changed my mind because I have
another proposition to make. I'll not beat about
the bush, either, as your fine aristocrats would do.
I love No&eacute;mie. Don't trouble yourself to speak,

<!-- page 118 -->

madame. I know well enough what you would
say if you&mdash;dared. I love the girl. I have never
in my life loved any woman, though I've had
enough, and more than enough, to do with women."
He laughed fatuously. A shiver passed
through the bowed form before him. "Oh, yes,
I know that in your eyes it is nothing less than
sacrilege for a man like me&mdash;the son of the
Yankee officer who looted your house; a man
who comes out of that <i>poor white trash</i> whom
you and your class despise&mdash;yes, madame, and
by God! the time will come, when&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, frowning and biting his lip; the
reference to his origin had escaped him unaware.
"I know," he went on with increasing boldness,
"that you consider it a crime for me even to
dream of No&eacute;mie"&mdash;a sudden tenderness softened
the syllables of the name. "I know that if
you dared you would call in your servants and
have me beaten&mdash;as you and your sort used to
beat your niggers&mdash;and kicked out into the
street. But I have the whip-hand of you as long
as I have a certain letter in my possession. For
that reason, madame, I decline to receive the
money&mdash;at present&mdash;which you hold in your

<!-- page 119 -->

hand, and I call off the bargain for another six
months. If, at the end of that time, I have not
succeeded in winning No&eacute;mie for my wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your <i>wife!</i> No&eacute;mie, <i>your</i> wife! never!"
gasped Madame de Laussan, scorn and terror
struggling for mastery in the cry.</p>

<p>"And why not!" demanded Cortland sharply.
As once before in the same room, and in the same
presence, his soul had burst its sheath, and stood
revealed in all its native brutality, the very voice
had changed, and was become coarse and vulgar.
"And why not! Is not a poor white, the son of
a Yankee thief, good enough for a&mdash;"</p>

<p>She recoiled from the unuttered word as if
from a blow. "Sir&egrave;ne! a moi!" she called chokingly.
But Sir&egrave;ne, crossing the room with a
bound, was already encircling the half-fainting
form with her arms. "Assassin!" she hissed, her
fiery eyes full upon him.</p>

<p>"You keep out, or&mdash;" he hissed in return;
then, mastering himself, "come now, madame,"
he said in a conciliatory tone, "you know I never
meant that. I love the girl honestly. Honestly,"&mdash;he
repeated the word as if the sound of it on his
own tongue gave him an unwonted sensation,&mdash;"and

<!-- page 120 -->

I believe that No&eacute;mie loves me. Or if she
don't now, she will, by God!" His lower jaw protruded
with a bulldog snap. "Now what I want
of you is just this. You give me your word,
as a Creole gentlewoman"&mdash;to save him, he could
not forego this sneer&mdash;"that you will keep out of
the game, you and your nigger, there." Sir&egrave;ne
spat at him openly. "For six months I will agree
not to show the letter or speak of it to any one.
Oh, I keep the letter, of course," he interpolated,
in answer to an unspoken ejaculation in both
pairs of eyes, fixed, horrified, upon him. "I keep
the letter because I don't trust women, white,
yellow, or black. If, at the end of six months, or
let us say seven, which will make one year from
the date of the first payment,&mdash;one year and a
day, as Mademoiselle Carrington would say,&mdash;since
I had the honor of offering to restore to the
famille de Laussan the priceless document carried
away, by mistake, by my father during the late
unpleasantness,"&mdash;he bowed with exaggerated
politeness,&mdash;"if by that time No&eacute;mie Carrington
is not my wife, or my&mdash;touch me, you yellow
devil, and I'll strangle you!&mdash;I will return you
the said document and receive the money according

<!-- page 121 -->

to our original agreement. It is a good bargain
for you, let me tell you! You will have the
use of your seven thousand five hundred in the
meantime; and you will have an opportunity of
becoming better acquainted with No&eacute;mie's&mdash;husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, call Major Grandchamps, madame, and
give him the satisfaction of running me through,
as he would say. Or send for the whipper-snapper
of a Yankee captain, who is forbidden
the house, but who meets your granddaughter in
all sorts of out-of-the-way places&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, monsieur," said Madame de Laussan,
with suddenly recovered composure; "I am ready,
having no alternative, to submit to your proposition,
namely: to allow you until the day specified
to&mdash;" an uncontrollable trembling shook
her frame.</p>

<p>"To make No&eacute;mie Mrs. Sidney Cortland,"
suggested Cortland.</p>

<p>"And to refrain from showing my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it, madame. Don't mince matters with
one of the family! Bless your heart, I don't
care. Your horror, you would say, of such a
match."</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p>"My horror of such an alliance. Thanks,
monsieur, for the apt word. But not even to
buy your silence will I submit to the shame of
listening to slander, either of Mademoiselle Carrington
or of the son of my old and honored
friend, Colonel Allard."</p>

<p>Cortland shrank in spite of himself, overawed
by the dignity of the speaker. He hastened to
adopt a more politic manner, drawing back
like a spider when, prepared for a spring, it
thinks better of it.</p>

<p>"Demand to see the letter, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse,"
breathed Sir&egrave;ne in the ear of her mistress, bending
over her as if to loosen the lace about the
quivering throat. Low as the words were, in the
n&egrave;gre patois, Cortland heard without fully understanding
them; he scented danger, and when, a
few moments later, Madame de Laussan preferred
the request, giving as her reason the desire to
fix in her memory the date of the letter, he smiled
astutely. "I would be delighted to oblige you,
madame," he said; "but I have not the letter
with me. In fact, I should not dream of carrying
documents of such value upon my person. The
letter, in a sealed envelope, be it understood, is

<!-- page 123 -->

in the hands of my lawyer. In case of my death,
or of any other mischance, it is to be handed,
with instructions to open, to certain persons less
scrupulous, I fear, than your humble servant."
He bent a malicious glance upon Sir&egrave;ne, who
stared stolidly at the wall behind him.</p>

<p>"What guarantee have I, monsieur," asked
Madame de Laussan, after a dejected silence,
"that at the end of the eight months the letter
will be restored to me?"</p>

<p>"The word of a&mdash;" Cortland had begun with
his impressive, acquired manner. He stopped and
laughed outright.&mdash;"Of a poor white," he concluded,
in a tone become all at once sombre, "which
of course you would not accept. However, it
is, then, understood that I am to pay court to
Mademoiselle de Laussan Carrington with your
full approval and consent&mdash;a welcome guest in
this house at all times, eh?"</p>

<p>He turned on his heel as he spoke, and swaggered
out of the room. Sir&egrave;ne, holding aside the
porti&egrave;re, kept her eyes on the floor as he approached;
he did not pause, but at the instant
of passing he tapped her shoulder with a blunt
finger. "One word to No&eacute;mie against me, and I

<!-- page 124 -->

kill&mdash;<i>kill!</i> not you, you d&mdash;d she-cat, but your
mistress yonder&mdash;the old woman. You hear?"</p>

<p>Sir&egrave;ne spat at him again, smiling.</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;what the devil is it?" muttered
Cortland, descending the steps, "something about
that fool of a Madame de Laussan and her yellow
nigger brings to the top everything I have
kept under all these years. By God! what a fool
I am to let myself go off like that. However,
I'm safe enough. If I wanted to, I could strip
from her every shred of property the old woman
possesses, diamonds and No&eacute;mie thrown in, for
that letter. I may do it yet!" His brow cleared.
He stepped briskly along the banquette, reclad
in picked-up gentility.</p>

<p class="small">IN THE COURTYARD</p>

</div>

<p>"I DO not understand," observed Miss Carrington
thoughtfully, "how one can ever be
quite sure."</p>

<p>"My dear girl," cried Strang, "one never <i>is</i>
quite sure&mdash;so long as one can ask the question."</p>

<p>"I suppose there does come a moment?" pursued
No&eacute;mie tentatively.</p>

<p>Donald considered this proposition for a short
while in silence; then, with conviction: "Yes,
there does come a moment. When the Mississippi
River, for example, ceases to coquet first with the
east bank, then with the left, and, surging and
leaping, bursts in a mighty flood over the levees
on both sides, sweeping away all bounds and&mdash;spreading
destruction as it goes, far and wide."</p>

<p>"It is like that?" laughed the girl.</p>

<p>"It is like that, yes," Donald laughed back.
But he regarded a little wistfully the flushed face,
turned suddenly, so that it showed in clear-cut

<!-- page 126 -->

profile against the white-starred greenery. They
were pacing back and forth under a trellised
rose-vine which overarched a foot-walk of the
courtyard. The cream-white rose petals fell in a
perfumed shower upon the cool flags; a handful
caught in her crinkly hair, rested like a coronet
on her bared head. Strang bent toward her
from his superior height; his lips trembled with
the words which had rushed to them so often
before&mdash;to be forced back by the remembrance
of his poverty, her extreme youth, his own unfitness,
her wealth. "It cannot be Allard whom
she&mdash;she loves," he thought; "for then she
would know! It must not be Cortland; what
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot, Don,"&mdash;her tone had recovered
its girlish lightness,&mdash;"I wanted to consult you
about the lace for that rose-colored gown of mine.
Shall I use my grandmother's flounces, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew back as if stung by the lash of a
whip. "Yes," he returned monotonously. He
listened, throwing in a word here and there, getting
hold of himself bit by bit,&mdash;"forcing the
Mississippi back into its bed," he said to himself
whimsically.</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"You are always such a help to me, Don,"
she concluded, the matter settled.</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe to slip a half-opened rosebud
into his buttonhole; it snapped under her
fingers. "A broken dream," he said, with a mock-tragic
air. It would have taken the quick ear of
love itself to detect the undercurrent in his voice
as he chanted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>La vie est vaine:<br/>

Un peu d'espoir,<br/>

Un peu de haine,<br/>

Et puis, bonsoir</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Your accent and your sentiment are alike
detestable," declared No&eacute;mie.</p>

<p>"I retire with my broken dream," he returned,
stooping to pick up the bud snapped from its stem,
and thrusting it into his breast pocket.</p>

<p>Left alone, No&eacute;mie continued to walk back
and forth in the trellised way where Strang, with
a pretext of a sketch under his arm, had found
her. Her thoughts returned to the circle in which
they had been wandering&mdash;helplessly, like people
lost in a forest&mdash;for the past weeks, and particularly
for the past hours. "It is beyond comprehension!"
she argued within herself: "when <i>ma
m&egrave;re</i> urges me to show more consideration to

<!-- page 128 -->

Mr. Cortland, then I hate Mr. Cortland almost as
much as Sir&egrave;ne does&mdash;I wonder, by the way, why
Sir&egrave;ne hates him so!&mdash;and when F&eacute;lix Monplaisir
hints darkly that Cortland is a boor and an impostor,
I find myself angry with F&eacute;lix and almost
ready to&mdash;elope with Cortland, if he should ask
me! When l'oncle Grandchamps falls into a fury
over what he is pleased to call Maxime's perfidy,&mdash;as
if it were a perfidy to serve one's country,&mdash;I
can imagine <i>l'anneau d'alliance</i> on my finger.
But when <i>Marraine</i> contrives that Maxime shall
find me next to him at Mass, I detest&mdash;yes, I
detest Maxime. Truly it is a mystery! When
Maxime flaunts in the face of the world his jealousy
of Cortland, I am irresistibly repelled from
him in the direction of&mdash;Sidney." She blushed
as the name for the first time found itself upon
her murmuring lips. "On the other hand, when
Cortland presumes to criticise Maxime, I am
furious. Oh!"</p>

<p>The sudden thought that leaped to her brain
arrested her feet. She stood stock still, trying to
remember. A word or two dropped by Cortland
an hour earlier seemed suddenly to take on meaning
unnoticed at the time. "You will join a party

<!-- page 129 -->

I am making up to see the Fire Dance at &mdash;&mdash;
Park to-night, will you not?" he had asked.</p>

<p>"My grandmother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madame de Laussan has already given her
consent; I have seen her," he interrupted, with
his accustomed brusque imperiousness. "Madame
Berthet will go, of course, and Mademoiselle
Jeanne. Also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not know," she interrupted in her
turn; "I have half an engagement already."</p>

<p>"With the Herons? Yes, I know; but they
have consented to come with us. Captain Allard
will be there," he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>She had hesitated; an unusual eagerness in his
voice putting her on guard. She had no mind to
make, as yet, the inevitable decision between her
two lovers.</p>

<p>"Captain Allard,"&mdash;was the repetition charged
with significance?&mdash;"will be there&mdash;on business
of his own. He will doubtless be more surprised
than pleased to meet Miss Carrington by the
light of Pepita's flaming aureole."</p>

<p>She had considered this a rather petty fling
at Allard's undisguised dislike of Cortland and
probable irritation at seeing her in company with

<!-- page 130 -->

his rival. But the words, recurring to her, carried
a subtle innuendo. She shook her head impatiently.
"It will not do, Mr. Cortland. Captain
Allard is at present the pole positive. I am moving
away from you, sir, at the rate of&mdash;"</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p class="small">THE FIRE DANCE</p>

</div>

<p>THE stage of the open-air theatre represented
a huge shell; it stood out, when lighted, in
rose-colored relief between the flanking wings,
which seemed to recede into shadow. Now, the
whole mass, outlined against a starless horizon,
was dark and mysteriously silent. The spectators
were almost as hushed under a heavily clouded
sky; the wind blowing in fitfully from Lake
Pontchartrain was charged with the musky perfume
of swamp-flowers. No&eacute;mie, her hands
clasped about her knees, stared into the darkness;
her heart was beating strangely. Cortland, beside
her, kept his eyes fixed upon her face, gleaming
softly-white in the obscurity; he seemed unexpectant,
though a nervous twitching of his under
lip hinted at inner excitement.</p>

<p>"Aie!" sighed Jeanne Berthet, "I find this
ghos'ly. We do not even talk. My tong is voodooed.
For what, then, do we wait? Ah"&mdash;

<!-- page 132 -->

for a whispering sound had announced the lifting
of the curtain. Unseen musicians began to
play softly a sort of disembodied prelude that
barely trembled into the air from stringed instruments
alone. Something vague, undefined&mdash;a
vaporous breath&mdash;passed across the deeper darkness
of the shell; then, as if blown back, it
wavered again into view, taking on a dim shape,
and instantly vanished. The onlookers strained
their eyes until the figure, if figure it was, reappeared,
dawning slowly into the outlines of a
woman, tall and slight, whose diaphanous draperies
were tinged as with the pale opalescence
of moonlight upon snow.</p>

<p>The shell was suddenly flooded with light.</p>

<p>The dancing of Pepita, the Cuban, as judged
by any known standard, was not dancing at all.
There was a series of slow, rhythmic movements,
in which the white garments of the dancer, out-blown
by some unearthly wind, caught from
some invisible sky flashes of exquisite color,
subtle, elusive, evanescent. Her delicate body
gleamed like mother-of-pearl through myriad
folds of thinnest Oriental silk; her outspread arms
opened fluttering wings of rose, amber, and violet.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>The dreamy music quickened stealthily. Pepita
swayed from side to side as if vaguely troubled,
then, folding her pinions, stooped to the
floor, the lights sinking with her, and rose enveloped
in a blaze of sulphurous flame. The spectators
burst into exclamations of awed delight as
the slender figure whirled, a column of fire,
across the velvety darkness. Tongues of dazzling
flame, tipped with scarlet, played around her
head, throwing into relief her thin, beautiful,
foreign face; her dark eyes gleamed like fixed
stars through the shag of black hair which fell
over her forehead.</p>

<p>Wildly, and more wildly still, as if in frantic
effort to escape the consuming terror, the dancer
writhed back and forth, beating her breast with
impotent hands. Suddenly an angry sheet of fire
from beneath her feet, mounting, scorched her
into annihilation. She threw up her meagre arms,
and sank, a bluish, palpitating mass, into nothingness.</p>

<p>There was a cry of horror from the audience;
a man rushed shrieking toward the stage; a
woman fainted. Even the initiated stood up,
uncertain and tremulous. No&eacute;mie clutched Cortland's

<!-- page 134 -->

arm, suffering him unnoted to hold her for
a moment to his breast.</p>

<p>But the devouring flame had released a Soul!
It was flying on wide, snow-white wings across
the hushed void; the backward-floating robes
were lightly touched with a cool, green radiance.
The hands, meekly folded upon the breast, and
the small, bare feet were translucent, like the
inner leaf of a resurrection lily.</p>

<p>The heavenly vision hovered for one moment
before the incredulous, wondering throng, then
faded, dissolving like a wraith of mist, under
their gaze.</p>

<p>The lights flared up; there was a second of
dazed silence, followed by tumultuous clamor,&mdash;clapping
of hands, stamping of feet, shouts, calls
for <i>Pepita! Pepita!</i></p>

<p>The Cuban, still in her gauze robes, which
trailed away from her, showing her bare feet,
came out with halting, uncertain step, and stood
in the heart of the glowing shell. Her small face
was very white, very drawn, and pitifully young!
She seemed scarcely more than a child&mdash;a frightened
child at that! For her parted lips trembled,
her eyes rolled wildly. People were asking each

<!-- page 135 -->

other wonderingly how this spectre could have
contrived, but now, to appear beautiful! Suddenly
the sombre eyes fixed themselves upon some
one just beyond the orchestra; a smile lighted the
young face. "<i>Maxime! Maxime!</i>" The shrill
cry silenced the incipient applause. She stretched
out emaciated arms. "<i>Maxime!</i>" A thin stream
of scarlet spurted from her lips; she sank once
more, but this time gasping, to the floor.</p>

<p>The curtain was hastily dropped, but not before
No&eacute;mie Carrington had seen Maxime Allard
leap upon the stage and stoop to the huddled
heap of silk and lace, which, a short half hour
before, had been a circling, throbbing, ecstatic
rainbow, an intense shining, a rhythmic dream.</p>

<p>"Good!" exulted Cortland within himself,
hurrying No&eacute;mie out by a side gate, ostensibly
to avoid the excited, jostling crowd. "I would
not have thought the Dago hussy so clever an
actress. Pardon, Miss Carrington," he added
aloud, seizing her arm almost roughly and drawing
her aside; "I believe we are in Captain Allard's
way."</p>

<p>For Allard, carrying the slight form of the
dancer in his arms, was striding toward a carriage

<!-- page 136 -->

drawn up against the curb without the gate.
Pepita's eyes were still closed; her waxen face
lay like a wilting flower against Allard's breast.
Unconscious, apparently, or reckless, of the many
pairs of eyes regarding him in undisguised astonishment,&mdash;even
of No&eacute;mie's look of scorn,&mdash;he
stepped into the carriage, gave a curt order to
the coachman, and was driven rapidly away.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;knew?" No&eacute;mie said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cortland readily; the man was too
cunning to pretend reluctance. "I knew. Shall
I tell you how I knew? The girl, who, by the
way, is shamming illness for effect, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing," she interrupted. "It is
enough for me to have seen, with my own eyes,
Captain Allard's public devotion to a common
dancer. He&mdash;he was nothing to me, nothing
whatever, you understand. But I respected him.
I&mdash;I thank you more than I can say, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sidney," he breathed, bending toward her.
"Say it&mdash;No&eacute;mie! Will you not?"</p>

<p>"Sidney," she repeated mechanically. Her
thoughts, it must be confessed, were otherwhere.</p>

<p>He could hardly restrain a savage, exultant
shout; he took the hand she held out to him,

<!-- page 137 -->

and drew it with masterful grasp within his arm,
folding his own over it.</p>

<p>At the same moment Captain Allard bent
above a bed in the Sanitarium, and, holding in
his hand the ice-cold hand of a dying girl, was
listening to the disconnected words which fell
from her pale lips. A white-capped nurse hovered
near, but the doctors, motioning to the officer
that the final moment was approaching, had
retired to the other end of the room. The dancer
had been babbling delightedly, like a child, but
now a glaze dulled the lustrous eyes, which still
sought his face.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Maxime," she had queried,
in the soft Spanish which he had learned,
a soldier, in Cuba. "Do you remember the day
you came to our cabin seeking water, and found
my mother half-dying beside my dead father? and
myself, <i>pobrecita</i> that I was, at their feet, burned
up with fever, and starving? How good you were
to us, Maxime, <i>mi hermano</i>. <i>Madre de Di&oacute;s!</i>
how good you were! After you went away&mdash;"</p>

<p>After he went away, the mother had died, the
thirteen-year-old girl had been picked up by a
wandering impresario; and during the past two

<!-- page 138 -->

years she had been Pepita, the Cuban Fire Dancer.
"I made up that <i>scena</i> myself," she explained,
with childish pride, to her listener.</p>

<p>She had desired to see the <i>amigo Americano</i>,
the <i>hermano</i> Maxime. Truly she had desired to
see him when she had found herself in his city.
But one night&mdash;in the very beginning&mdash;<i>he</i>
had come into her life. Allard followed with
horror and indignation the story of treachery,
betrayal, shame. When it was finished, the girl
lay for a time exhausted among the pillows.
"I do not know what it all means, <i>amigo</i>," she
broke the silence once more, "but I&mdash;I wished
so to please him! He told me to write the note
to you and ask you, for my dead mother's sake, to
come to-night and see me dance. He made me
promise to call you from the stage, loud, loud.
I wanted to please him. Where is he? Oh&mdash;it
is&mdash;you, Maxime, <i>mi hermano</i>. Why&mdash;when
did you&mdash;come?"</p>

<p>"What is his name?" demanded Allard
sharply. "Who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Angel de los Cielos</i>&mdash;Maxime, it is very&mdash;dark!"</p>

<p>"Who is the man?"</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>"It is&mdash;dark. <i>Madre de Di&oacute;s</i>, how it&mdash;is&mdash;dark!
<i>Madre d</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice ceased suddenly. Her secret had
died with her.</p>

<p>THE crumbling oven-tomb of those dead-and-gone
Allards, whose plantation once embraced
the fine sweep of land lakeward from an
elbow of Bayou St. Jean, and the magnificent
live-oaks, moss-festooned, which cast gigantic circles
of shade on the greensward below,&mdash;these
alone remain to witness the chateau of the
<i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, and the famous dueling-ground
of a later day. The open, if ever furrowed by
plow or turned by spade, shows no trace of either;
and not even a ruined chimney marks the site
of the vanished plantation-house. The tangled
underbrush,&mdash;the fanlike latanier, semi-tropical
vines, and flaming swamp-flowers,&mdash;which made
fantastic setting to those scenes enacted here
in gray dawnlight following nights of revelry,
when rapier or dueling-pistol spoke the final
word of the quarrel, has been cleared away.
A trim park with well-shaven lawns, decorous

<!-- page 141 -->

rose trees, and ordered drives and footways, is
rapidly outliving the memory of its doubtful,
romantic past. An artificial rivulet wanders placidly
through soil once streaked with the bluest
blood of the old town by the river. Hardly a
<i>fleur-de-lys</i> remains to make a splotch of wild and
heavenly blue, or of gold-dusted pink, in the gentle
depression where aforetime rippled a river of
color, with clouds of butterflies a-hover above.
But the tradition of the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> stays on, and
in the spring many who go no farther afield in
quest of these lilies of France make a pretense
of seeking them&mdash;in company&mdash;under the oaks.</p>

<p>Hither, then, several mornings after the last
dance of Pepita, the Cuban, came Madame Berthet
and a dozen or more young men and women
for the Spring Lily-Meet, as some one has playfully
named it. Cortland was among the number,
conspicuously attendant upon Miss Carrington,
his ordinary taciturnity pervaded by a half-veiled
air of triumph. No&eacute;mie was pale and distraught;
the gay raillery of her companions hardly brought
a faint responsive smile to her lips. Seated on a
garden bench, her hands closed listlessly over the
single <i>fleur-de-lys</i> which had rewarded the quest,

<!-- page 142 -->

she gazed down the leaf-shaded vistas, where
scattered, Watteau-like groups strayed. Suddenly
Strang, covertly watching her, saw a quick flush
dye her white throat and mount to her cheeks;
her form stiffened, a defiant fire leaped into her
eyes. He followed her glance. A couple of servants
were approaching carrying covered hampers;
behind them Allard, who had just turned
in at the park gate, walked briskly, hat in hand,
the light breeze lifting the dark curls from his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Is this exuberant welcome for me or for the
well-seasoned meats borne before me?" he demanded,
laughing, as the group, with the exception
of No&eacute;mie and Cortland, closed noisily
around him.</p>

<p>"You! You deserve no welcome!" cried
Jeanne Berthet; "neither do you deserve a nibble,
even, of the well-seasoned meats! You, who
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the eleventh hour, while we have borne
the heat and burden of the lily-hunting," interpolated
Masters.</p>

<p>"You, who plainly come only for the breakfast!"
finished Jeanne.</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<p>"I, mademoiselle? But I come, me, to view
the tomb of my ancestors"&mdash;he made a flourish
with his hat, and smiled brightly over at No&eacute;mie,
whose eyes were full upon his. She answered the
smile with a cool stare which swept him from
head to foot; then, turning abruptly, she laid her
hand upon Cortland's arm. They walked away
together, shoulder almost touching shoulder, and
passed across a foot-bridge to a little island lying
like an emerald on the bosom of the still stream.
Here, underneath a feathery cypress, they stood
face to face, apparently oblivious of everything
and everybody save themselves. A second of
gasping silence among the onlookers followed
this astonishing man&oelig;uvre; the blood rushed to
Allard's face and receded, leaving it white and
set. But there seemed hardly a break in his
speech. "As I was saying," he continued, in the
same mock-heroic tone, "I make, to-day, my annual
pilgrimage to the tomb of my fathers,&mdash;the
long-gone Allards of the <i>habitation Allard</i>.
Adieu, <i>mesdames et messieurs</i>, I go to commune
with their dust." He turned away.</p>

<p>"You will come back to breakfast, Maxime?"
urged Madame Berthet, visibly disturbed.</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"A thousand pardons, madame," he smiled
over his shoulder; "after a funeral one desires&mdash;meditation."</p>

<p>"Hard hit, poor boy!" remarked Masters, looking
after the departing soldier; "I do not wonder,
myself! But why the devil should any girl, above
all No&eacute;mie Carrington, prefer a cad,&mdash;a hound,
I should say,"&mdash;he interjected, under his breath,
"like Cortland, to a gentleman like Allard!"</p>

<p>A chorus of feminine voices, for and against,
blocked further criticism on his part. Under
cover of this the pallor of Strang, almost as great
as that of Allard, escaped notice. Mechanically
his hand had sought the withered rosebud in his
breast-pocket; his lips moved.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Un peu d'amour,<br/>

Un peu de r&ecirc;ve,<br/>

Et puis&mdash;bonjour!</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>he repeated to himself. His eyes were fixed, not
upon the two sunlighted figures, standing together
upon their green island, but upon Allard's solitary
figure seated in thick shadow on the crumbling
tomb under the horizon.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie meantime was suffering an agony of
shamed reaction. The sight of Allard, coming

<!-- page 145 -->

with springing step toward her, had moved her
to a frenzy of anger. "His treachery to me is
past forgiveness," she had thought tumultuously;
"his dishonor in stooping to such a <i>liaison</i> is
shameless enough; but that he should dare to
show himself here&mdash;anywhere!&mdash;with that smile
on his lips, when that poor, bedizened creature
who died in his arms is hardly yet cold in her
grave! It is monstrous!"</p>

<p>The one desire uppermost in her mind was to
escape his hated presence; to show him by some
overt act, not only her scorn of him, but the gulf
that henceforth yawned between them.</p>

<p>Anger and scorn still possessed her; but with
these now mingled a sense of maidenly shame at
her own sudden defiance of convention. Yes!
She loved Cortland; this she had told herself
stormily over and over again during the past
three or four days. She meant to marry him.
Only not yet! "Yes, I think I am sure; but&mdash;wait
a little," she said, almost humbly now,&mdash;for
Cortland, out of hearing, but in full sight of the
others, was urging an open engagement.</p>

<p>"So be it!" he said exultantly. He bent to
brush from her laces a gray spider which had

<!-- page 146 -->

crawled from the half-open heart of a rose on her
bosom. To Allard the movement must have had
the appearance, as Cortland instantly divined, of
lover-like familiarity. The thought added further
to the intoxication of his triumph. "Now!" he
murmured half-aloud, "now I am paid. I am
paid!" His mind had once more leaped irresistibly
back into the past, and lighted upon a moment
when he, the barefoot boy, standing like a whipped
cur between the planter whose desk he had robbed
and the grinning black body-servant who had
caught him in the act, had registered a silent vow
to "get even" in some way with both,&mdash;the black
and the white! His thoughts ran like flame down
the years, touching into vivid glare the various
steps by which he had climbed&mdash;or fallen; throwing
into bold and strange relief things, places,
people; illuminating with a broad beam, as if it
were a culminating point, the library of the h&ocirc;tel
de Laussan where an old woman and her sometime
slave quivered under his touch. His! the
poor white! An insolent smile parted his lips;
his time had indeed come. Yonder the wondering
gang of aristocrats; here the whipped cur&mdash;and
the beautiful young&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>No&eacute;mie's voice broke in upon his orgy of vainglory.
"Let us join the others," she said dully.</p>

<p>Allard had already quitted the old brick tomb.
No&eacute;mie felt, rather than saw, his tall figure moving
rapidly toward the upper gate of the park,
as she followed Cortland across the foot-bridge
and up the flower-starred slope. His clear halloo
came floating back. Lifting her eyes in spite of
herself, she caught a final glimpse of him stepping
upon the platform of a passing car.</p>

<p>XIV</p>

<p class="small">SIR&Egrave;NE</p>

</div>

<p>SIR&Egrave;NE came out of the Cathedral St. Louis by
the side door which gives upon the Allee St.
Antoine, and sped homeward. Her eyes under
their thick, black brows resembled the eyes of a
bloodhound; there were red flames in their tawny
depths. "I have broken the oath which I took
with my hands between the hands of my mistress,"
she muttered, edging along the house
fronts with the quick, stealthy grace of a wild-cat.
"My bones will crumble in my body before
I die; the meat will rot into shreds upon them.
But the Little Mistress will have peace. 'Sieur
Maxime will see to it that the Little Mistress
has peace. And the child, No&eacute;mie, will be set
free. Can any one blind the eyes of Sir&egrave;ne?
The child has been voodooed by that dog of a
buckra-man." She spat into the air. "Ohe! son
of the devil, there is a man at your heel now.
He will get the letter; and when the letter is

<!-- page 149 -->

burned, it is the woman at your back, it is Sir&egrave;ne,
who will bring the curse upon you!"</p>

<p>Left behind, in the semi-obscurity of the cathedral,
Allard waited, giving the mulattress time
to reach her home. He slipped out of the high,
wooden pew where he had listened to the revelation
poured in fierce undertones into his strained
ears by the black-robed figure kneeling at his
elbow, and walked back to the vestibule. There,
leaning against the wrought-iron railing which
protects the baptismal font, he went over in his
mind the fragmentary story, trying to fit the
apparently irrelevant parts into something like a
connected whole. Much remained inexplicable,
but he had gathered enough to fill him with
horror and apprehension. The officer who had
led Butler's Provost Guard into the de Laussan
house that long-gone day was&mdash;Cortland's father!
Cortland's father! It required an effort to tear
his thoughts away from this astounding fact.
Cortland's father had stolen&mdash;the word was Sir&egrave;ne's&mdash;a
jeweled box which contained, among
other valuables, a letter of the greatest importance
to Madame de Laussan, and to Mam'selle
No&eacute;mie. Cortland had threatened the Little Mistress

<!-- page 150 -->

with this letter. No, the child did not
know about the letter; she did not know that
Cortland's father was a Yankee thief; the poor
<i>b&eacute;b&eacute;</i> was voodooed by that son of the devil.
The Little Mistress was afraid; the Little Mistress
had already paid many thousands of dollars
to Cortland to give her that letter. But, though
he promised, he keeps the letter, the dog of hell!
He wants the child, No&eacute;mie; he will buy the
poor little angel with the letter&mdash;No, the child
knows nothing; she is voodooed. Can any one
blind the eyes of Sir&egrave;ne, who nursed her and
her mother before her?</p>

<p>Through the velvety shadows of the cathedral
Allard saw the red flames shoot into the woman's
suddenly lifted eyes. No, she could not tell 'Sieur
Maxime what was in the letter (she shivered as if
struck by a north wind), since, after all, he might
not find it&mdash;and then, why should he know?
Besides, she had broken one oath, taken with
her hands between the hands of the Little Mistress;
but when she had sworn not to tell what
was in the letter her heart was against the heart
of the Little Mistress! "Get that letter for the
love of God, 'Sieur Maxime," she had ended,

<!-- page 151 -->

with a piteous break in her voice; "and afterward&mdash;"
She shook her head until the great
hoops in her ears beat her jaws with their dull
gold. "I know not where that letter is. He says&mdash;tongue
of a liar!&mdash;that he has given it to his
lawyer to keep. Therefore, I know he keeps it
himself. It must be that he carries it about his
body, for I have searched his bedchamber in the
boarding-house where he lives. Oh, but his
chest, his portmanteau, his mattress, his pillows,
the clock on his mantel, the matting on his floor.
It is not there."</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" A young priest, attracted by an
unwonted stir of voices, was walking down the
broad aisle. "Go, Sir&egrave;ne," whispered Allard; "I
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had not finished the sentence. The mulattress,
with a nod of complete confidence, had
arisen from her knees and was gliding toward
the door; she dipped her fingers in the vessel of
holy water as she passed it, and crossed herself
devoutly.</p>

<p>Allard concerned himself less about the mysterious
letter than about another point in Sir&egrave;ne's
story. The letter, he argued, could only be some

<!-- page 152 -->

document relating to the de Laussan estate&mdash;perhaps
a will which might involve the passing
of the de Laussan property, on the death of her
great-aunt and adopted grandmother, to some
other than No&eacute;mie; at all events, some bugbear
which Monsieur Paturin could long ago have put
to rout if Madame de Laussan had not so unaccountably
fallen into terror of a villain, working
for ends of his own upon her fears. Allard
burned with indignation, remembering Madame
de Laussan's visit to the money-lender,&mdash;so inexplicable
to him at the time,&mdash;the face, white and
drawn, in the shadows of the carriage, the trembling
fingers clasped about an oblong package!
He recalled the sudden withdrawal of the <i>grande
dame</i> from the world in which she had so long
moved, a power and a delight; and No&eacute;mie's
wistful anxiety about her. <i>No&eacute;mie!</i> the name
pushed itself like a thorn into his sore heart.
Here was the vital point of Sir&egrave;ne's disclosures.
He smiled scornfully over the old bonne's notion
of a voodoo spell; that No&eacute;mie Carrington really
loved this base creature he had come to understand
but too well. But oh, the shame of it! the
pity of it! An exquisite, white flower dropped

<!-- page 153 -->

into filth and slime; a dainty, winged spirit
caught in the maw of an unclean monster! "She
is not for me," he murmured, threading his way
through the dusky stillness of the cathedral, and
stepping out into the mellow afternoon sunshine.
"She has shown me, publicly, the scorn with
which she regards me; yet for the life of me I
cannot understand&mdash;unless it be that Cortland
has poisoned her mind&mdash;why she is so changed
toward me! No, she is not for me. But she
shall be saved from that scoundrel&mdash;in spite of
herself if need be!"</p>

<p>He crossed Jackson Square, the ancient Place
d'Armes, which smelled of violets and roses.
Beyond, the electric car, whirling him toward the
Barracks, was hindered for a moment on a corner.
Glancing without intention into a common grog-shop
which faced the levee, he caught a glimpse
of the man uppermost in his thoughts. Cortland
was leaning against the sloppy bar; he was alone,
and held in his upraised hand a glass of liquor;
his face was flushed; an unpleasant leer sat in
his eyes. It was all Allard could do to keep from
leaping from the car to fling himself upon the
solitary drinker and throttle him where he stood.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 154 -->

<div class="center" id="ch15">

<p>XV</p>

<p class="small">THE LETTER</p>

</div>

<p>THE next night Captain Allard, too preoccupied
and too self-absorbed to remain at
the club where he had dined with some friends,
passed with a quick, military tread across Canal
Street, and entered the French Quarter by way
of Rue Bourbon. He had, it must be confessed,
the half-formed intention of ringing boldly at
the de Laussan door and demanding an interview
with&mdash;Madame de Laussan? No&eacute;mie? He had
not got far enough to decide which, or what he
should say to one or the other in excuse for his
intrusion. Stay, should he not rather see Cortland,
and tax him outright with his baseness?
He instantly rejected this proposition as premature,
knowing that he would be at a disadvantage
in the presence of the man whom No&eacute;mie&mdash;loved.</p>

<p>He walked on uncertainly. The street between
the tall, steep-roofed houses became more and

<!-- page 155 -->

more filled with shadow as he proceeded. Here
and there, in those <i>&icirc;lets</i> nearest Canal Street,
people were sitting on the banquettes after the
familiar and pleasant fashion of the Quarter;
window shutters were outflung; voices came
drifting out. Through one open door he saw
young people gathered about a piano; they were
singing snatches from grand opera. Down long
alleyways, pitch-dark, he divined courtyards
which sent into the night air the breath of
night-blooming jessamine. Moving swiftly along,
he came at length to the arcade of the French
Opera House. The season was long over, and
the heavy boarding which protects the entrance-stairs
and the offices below was in place; the
shadows within the arcade open to the street
were thick and close; a musty odor as of dead
"seasons" and singers clung to them. A light
burned in the small caf&eacute; nearly opposite. As
Allard passed under the pillared arcade, a man
appeared in the doorway of the caf&eacute;; he stood for
a moment silhouetted against the yellow glare, a
hand on either jamb; then he descended the low
steps and crossed the street with an unsteady gait.
He stepped upon the opposite banquette and

<!-- page 156 -->

lurched heavily against Allard, righting himself
with difficulty. "D&mdash;n you!" he growled in a
thick voice, "can't you keep yo' own shide th'
fench!" It was Cortland. "Gimme light," he continued.
He steadied himself with a hand on the
officer's shoulder. Allard obeyed mechanically,
his thoughts darting about in a blind attempt to
seize the word which might turn this opportune
meeting to account. Even his disgust of the
man, augmented by his present condition, was
lost in this fever of excitement. He produced
his match-box. The match flared up, the thin
flume of flame wavering in the night air. "Hullo!
Ish you, hey?" Cortland exclaimed, with drunken
familiarity. "Ish Allar'! D&mdash;n fool, Allar'!" He
laughed foolishly, making an unsuccessful effort
to fit the end of his cigar to the light in Allard's
hand. "Goo' joke on you, old man!" He essayed
a poke under his companion's ribs, and was
saved a fall by Allard's timely arm. "Goo' joke
on Allar'!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" Allard said carelessly.
"I don't think much of it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh! you don't, hey!" The thick voice, stirred
to obstinate anger, was almost sobered. "Well,

<!-- page 157 -->

I <i>do</i>. I worked it, d&mdash;n me, I worked it. Goo'
joke, I shay!"</p>

<p>"How did you work it?" Allard asked it
with great deference.</p>

<p>Cortland laughed; again a note of cunning
mingled with his inane cackle.</p>

<p>"I tol' Pep-p-pita&mdash; you 'member Pep-p-p-pita,
hey? Cu-b-b-b&mdash; d&mdash;n it! Pep-p&mdash;
<i>dansher</i>. Devlish goo'-looker, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you told Pepita?"</p>

<p>"Tol' Pepp&mdash; <i>her</i>, d&mdash;n it! <i>dansher</i>, tol'
her I'd m-marry her if she'd write note to Allar',
'n if she'd holler for Allar'. She did it aw ri'.
Devlish goo'-looker Pepp&mdash; d&mdash;n it! <i>Dansher</i>.
Goo' joke! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" echoed Allard, like a parrot.
"Good joke on Allard. Didn't know you had it
in you, Cortland."</p>

<p>Cortland straightened himself at the flattery,
patting his crumpled shirt front with a pleased
hand. "Thought I wash fool, hey? May be po'
whi' trash, but no fool, no fool, d&mdash;n you,
no fool."</p>

<p>"You are a genius!" cried Allard, admiringly,
his fist clinched, his nails digging into the palms

<!-- page 158 -->

of his hands, his teeth drawing blood from his
lips.</p>

<p>Cortland wagged his head solemnly. "Pep-p-p-pita
wrote note to Allar'! Shee? D&mdash;n fool,
Allar'! He comes to shee danshe. No&eacute;mie comes
too. I shee to that."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" shouted Allard, off his guard.</p>

<p>But Cortland was too full of himself to note
the sudden angry outcry. "No&eacute;mie!" he repeated,
started upon a new tack by the introduction
of the name. "D&mdash;d fine filly, No&eacute;mie.
Goin' to run her myself in nex' rashe. Shay, ole
boy, you know ashtocratic white-headed ole girl?
Missus de Laussan? Hates me! Goo' joke. I've
got letter. Ever shee letter?"</p>

<p>The coarse voice was thickening. Allard had
lost the power of speech. His eyes, accustomed to
the obscurity, were fastened on Cortland's hand
fumbling in an inner pocket; the diamond on the
little finger, scintillating in the light of the cigar
in the man's mouth, appeared and disappeared.
"Where devil <i>ish</i> letter?" muttered the drunken
seeker, dragging forth a notebook and thrusting
it back. "Reckon ish losh." A couple of men
passing up the street echoed his braying laugh.</p>

<!-- page 159 -->

<p>Allard waited in an agony of impatience. But
Cortland, his attention distracted by a passing
car, had already veered about.</p>

<p>"Shay, I'm d&mdash;d thirsty!" he announced;
and, chanting the chorus of a vulgar ballad, he
recrossed the street, staggering, to the cabaret.
Allard watched him, again framed for a second
in the doorway, then disappearing into the dim-lit
interior. He felt baffled, defeated, impotent;
stunned, besides, by the blackness of the soul into
which he had gazed.</p>

<p>He turned; something caught in a corner of
his outer pocket slipped and fell with a whispering
rustle to the ground. He stooped to pick
it up, thrilled to feel between his fingers the thin,
foreign, folded paper.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he sat in a private room
at a nearby restaurant. An open letter lay on
the table, under his hand; he smoothed it out,
rereading again and again the dim lines on the
yellowed paper. It was dated April, 1861, and
signed, "Gabrielle Verac de Laussan."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 160 -->

<div class="center" id="ch16">

<p>XVI</p>

<p class="small">A CONSULTATION</p>

</div>

<p>TOWARD ten o'clock the same evening Major
L&eacute;on Grandchamps sat dozing in his great
armchair. His sumptuous bachelor apartment in
Rue Rampart&mdash;for the major had been a widower
these thirty years&mdash;was flooded with light. On
a table at the sleeper's elbow were a couple of
decanters, a tray of tall-stemmed glasses, a rack
of pipes, a tobacco-jar filled with P&eacute;rique, and
a box of Habanos, which gave out a subtle aroma
to the warm air. Roses from the ancient garden
in the rear of the Grandchamps mansion filled
the crystal vases on the mantel; a pair of fencing-foils
were laid across the solitaire-board
which rested upon the tabouret at the major's
knee; a sword which had been under discussion
the night before glittered unsheathed, on a
card-table set out with lighted candles in silver
candelabra and fresh packs of cards. The major
was in evening dress, a pleasant duty he imposed

<!-- page 161 -->

upon himself even when he dined alone, as he had
done this evening.</p>

<p>From that half of the house presided over by
the major's widowed daughter, Madame Berthet,
there came, borne across intervening halls, but
muffled by many porti&egrave;red doors, the sound of
music intermingled with the hum of voices and
the echoes of light laughter. It was the evening
at home of Madame and Mademoiselle Berthet.
Later, doubtless, the major would drop in upon his
daughter and her guests.</p>

<p>The sharp clang of the bell at his private entrance
awoke the sleeper. He sat up, smilingly
expectant. It was a full hour and more earlier
than the <i>Cercle</i> was wont nightly to assemble.
<i>Quelle chance, mon Dieu!</i> He rubbed his slim
hands delightedly, and arose, casting the host's
last critical glance about the long salon. C&eacute;sar,
his old factotum,&mdash;valet, butler, chef,&mdash;presently
appeared, sweeping back the heavy curtain draping
the doorway. A quick tread sounded along
the hall; the negro turned one wild, apprehensive
glance over his shoulder toward the approaching
guest, and another upon his master. "Monsieur
le Capitaine Maxime Allard!" he announced pompously.

<!-- page 162 -->

"Pardon, 'Sieur L&eacute;on!" He dropped
the curtain and fled before the purple wrath upon
his master's face.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Cap&mdash;" gasped Major Grandchamps;
"what audacity! How dare you?" he
began in his precise French. His eyes fell upon
the tall, slim young man, attired in obtrusive, unornamented
dark blue, and his manner underwent
swift transition from angry protest to joyous
hospitality. The old eyes sparkled, the purple in
the furrowed face turned to welcoming red.
"Fernand Allard! <i>Mon vieux!</i>" he cried, "it
is thou! At last! Ah, but I have missed thee,
my comrade, my brother!" He opened wide his
arms. Allard controlled an impulse to throw
himself into those arms, which had often been
the refuge of his childhood.</p>

<p>"I wish it were my father, sir," he said quietly.
"But may not the son of Fernand Allard claim
somewhat, too? I am Maxime."</p>

<p>"May the devil choke you and your father
on the same potato!" roared the old man, his
anger increased tenfold by his own misapprehension.
"You&mdash;you scoundrel! How dare you
pollute this house by entering it with the brand

<!-- page 163 -->

of the Yankee on your back, and the brand of a
traitor on your forehead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Major Grandchamps, I beg you to hear
me," interrupted Allard, advancing.</p>

<p>"You will leave this house, sir. On the instant,
Captain Allard. Your presence here, sir,
is more than an impertinence. It is an insult!"</p>

<p>"What I have to say," insisted Allard, taking
advantage of the major's necessity to find breath
to proceed, "is of the greatest moment. It concerns
neither you nor myself, but your kinswoman
and ward, Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie Carrington."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The words seemed to lash the major
into an uncontrollable fury. "Maxime Allard,
if you soil that name again upon your lips, I will
run you through like a dog. By God, I will rid
the world of a rascal, anyhow!" He seized the
naked sword as he spoke, and rushed blindly
forward.</p>

<p>"And I tell you, by God, that you <i>shall</i> hear
me!" cried Allard, springing to one side, and
then leaping upon the infuriated veteran. He
wrenched the weapon from the shaking hand
that held it, and flung it behind him, and quietly

<!-- page 164 -->

but firmly forced the spare form backward and
into the armchair. Then, without giving him
time to recover breath, he began in a clear and
steady voice to state the object of his visit.</p>

<p>This time the purple in the old cheeks faded
to a ghastly pallor; amazed, incredulous ejaculations
burst from the quivering lips. "Impossible!"
he whispered at length. "Impossible!&mdash;Poor
Gabrielle! She may be living still&mdash;I do not
know. But Armand de Laussan, poor boy, he is
long dead. He fell at Manassas&mdash;the letter seems
to be genuine. Stay, I will compare it&mdash;" He got
up stiffly and took a bundle of time-worn letters
from a tall escritoire, running them over as he
returned to his chair. "The same. I thought so.
Gabrielle's handwriting was unlike any other I
have ever seen. What a light on her inexplicable
flight! But impossible! Monstrous!"</p>

<p>The stream of words fell as if unconsciously
from his lips; his eyes were half closed. "Let
me think again. I was in Paris myself just before
Armand de Laussan&mdash;the brother of Nemours,
who married my cousin Laure Destrehan&mdash;married
la belle Gabrielle. May I ask how this
letter came into your possession, Captain Allard?"

<!-- page 165 -->

he opened his eyes to demand sharply. His hand
rested on the page signed "Gabrielle Verac de
Laussan;" it was spread out on the table in the
steady light of the candles.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Major Grandchamps," returned the
younger man, after a moment of hesitation, during
which he swiftly determined that Cortland's
connection with the affair&mdash;his origin, his character,
his schemes&mdash;should for the present remain
known to himself alone; "pardon, but with
your permission I will reserve my answer to this
question for a later time. But I assure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are the son of Fernand Allard&mdash;may the
devil fly away with him! I need no further assurance.
Are the contents of the letter known to
any one beside yourself?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes. Therefore, we must act
at once." He wiped the cold sweat from his
forehead; a vision of Cortland's drunken face,
leering at him across the feeble glare of a match,
rising before him.</p>

<p>"At once!" Major Grandchamps squared his
shoulders. "How soon can you start for France?"
he asked, drawing paper and pen toward him,
and adjusting his <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

<!-- page 166 -->

<p>"Almost immediately. My furlough is due,
and, happily, it may be extended to two months,
or longer, as I have had no leave since I went
out to the Philippines."</p>

<p>"Good! It will take time." The old man
wrote rapidly for some moments; he added to
the letter, addressed to "M. Henri Saint-Cyr,
avocat, rue des Capucines, Paris, France," a slip
covered with memoranda,&mdash;notes, names, suggestions,
addresses,&mdash;and handed both to Allard.
"It is I who should go," he said, after the intimate
consultation which followed; "but I am not
so young as I was <i>dans le temps!</i> I should be
snapped up by the gout after my first dinner
with Saint-Cyr, <i>h&eacute;las!</i>" He leaned back in his
chair and closed his eyes again. "La belle Gabrielle!"
he sighed softly. "Good God! the
thing is impossible! <i>Pauvre enfant!</i>"</p>

<p>"Has he forgotten No&eacute;mie?" wondered the
young man, with a jealous pang. "And Madame
de Laussan!"</p>

<p>"One thing more, Major Grandchamps," he
added aloud, rising and placing the letter and
memoranda, with Madame Armand de Laussan's
long-lost note, in his breast-pocket; he laid a

<!-- page 167 -->

not over-steady hand on the back of a chair
as he confronted his host. "One thing more.
Mademoiselle Carrington&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She does not know?" cried Major Grandchamps,
starting up in alarm.</p>

<p>"No, oh, no! God forbid that she should ever
know. But&mdash;Mademoiselle Carrington is, I believe,
betrothed to Mr. Sidney Cortland"&mdash;he
spoke the name with an effort.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. He is, in my opinion, a cad.
But my cousin, Madame de Laussan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Major Grandchamps, may I ask you, without
for the moment exposing my reasons therefor, to
promise me that this&mdash;marriage shall not take
place during my absence?"</p>

<p>"I will, gladly. Besides, it is necessary under
the circumstances&mdash;the supposed circumstances.
No man would offer&mdash;"</p>

<p>Allard winced visibly.</p>

<p>"I desire," he interrupted, gripping the back
of the chair still more firmly, "before I go, to
make through you the offer of my hand to Mademoiselle
No&eacute;mie Carrington&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Maxime!</i>" The major sprang up, his face
expressing at once admiration and unbelief.

<!-- page 168 -->

"You cannot mean it! When this&mdash;this doubt is
removed&mdash;if this doubt should be removed,
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I love No&eacute;mie," Allard broke in, with a proud
uplift of the head. "I have always loved her.
Whatever happens&mdash;if she should find herself
free, if&mdash;she should not marry&mdash;Cortland,
and if I am fortunate enough to win her love,
I would be the happiest man alive with her for
my wife. Please remember this, sir, whatever
happens! And now&mdash;" he inclined his head in
a formal salute, speaking in a conventional voice&mdash;"permit
me once more to crave the pardon of
Monsieur le Major Grandchamps for intruding
upon him, and for a certain roughness toward
him which, under other circumstances, would be
unforgivable."</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps listened with a gravity
equal to Allard's own. "Maxime, you young
puppy!" he shouted at length, bursting into a
laugh which was half a sob. "You are your
father's own cub! Did he ever tell you&mdash;but
of course he did not, the <i>t&ecirc;te de bois!</i>&mdash;how he
carried me to the rear, with a shot through my
leg, from the field of the Wilderness, grape and

<!-- page 169 -->

canister raining on him the whole way, the madman!
And then cut my acquaintance when I came
out of hospital because I made blackberry <i>cr&ecirc;pes</i>
without sugar&mdash;when there wasn't a grain of
sugar within a hundred miles of us!" He stopped
to laugh uproariously. "He is the most obstinate
fellow alive, d&mdash;n him! I'll fight him yet for
turning you into a Yankee, the cabbage-pate!
<i>I wish you a good-morning, Major Grandchamps</i>,
says your bulldogship, with your jaw
set like a rock. I won't have it, sir, do you hear?
Don't shake your head at me, your renegade!
Come here, rascal, <i>vaurien</i> uniform and all! <i>Who</i>
am I, sir? Why, I am your uncle Grandchamps,
that's who! your <i>parrain</i>, that's who!" He
opened wide his arms once more, and this time
Maxime, with a rush of happy tears to his eyes,
leaped into the old shelter.</p>

<p>XVII</p>

<p class="small">CORTLAND</p>

</div>

<p>CORTLAND'S physical discomfort on awaking
some hours after midnight from the drunken
slumber which had overtaken him in the cabaret
on Rue Bourbon was not improved by an uneasy
if vague consciousness of having talked in his
cups. But&mdash;to whom? And&mdash;of what? It
was some time before he could remember anything
clearly, and when Allard's face, as he had
seen it by the light of a match, did dawn into his
mind, he recalled broken fragments only of his
own aimless maunderings. He knew his power of
silence too well to dream that any reference to the
girl whom he had so heartlessly betrayed&mdash;Pepita,
the Cuban&mdash;had escaped his lips. He
would have staked his life against the mere suggestion
of self-betrayal in a matter so vital to himself
as the stolen letter.</p>

<p>His rage and alarm on discovering the loss of
the letter were extreme. Failing to find it in the

<!-- page 171 -->

memorandum-book where he kept it, or anywhere
about his person, he rushed, completely sobered
by this piece of ill-luck, to his rooms, and sought
for it there as thoroughly as Sir&egrave;ne had done,
cheating himself with the hope that he might,
absently, have placed it in some hiding-place there.
His search, needless to record, was as fruitless as
Sir&egrave;ne's own. As he threw himself, baffled and
overdone, into a chair, he had one of those
flashes of light, unaccountable, mysterious, which
sometimes illumine a single spot, a word, a gesture,
on the canvas of memory, leaving all else
in darkness; he saw, as if with his bodily eyes,
the thin envelope detach itself from the sheaf of
papers in his hand and flutter slowly outward;
at the same time a sense of the nearness of the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l'Op&eacute;ra strengthened the slight clue.
He hurried back to the arcade&mdash;at that hour
absolutely deserted&mdash;and spent a breathless half
hour groping within the thick shadow; thridding
with eager fingers the d&eacute;bris of the open gutter
along the banquette; pursuing wind-blown scraps
of paper&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p>For weeks thereafter he expected daily to hear
his long-guarded and negotiable secret exploited

<!-- page 172 -->

at the clubs, on the streets, in drawing-rooms, in
drinking-shops. He made a pretext for an early
visit to Madame de Laussan in order to draw conclusions
from any possible change in her attitude
toward him, or in that of her yellow tigress; he
watched No&eacute;mie's face, pale and listless,&mdash;from
the summer's heat, they said. But as the days
passed and nothing happened, his confidence
returned. He assured himself that the insignificant-looking
envelope, drifted into some receptacle
for waste, had been carted off to oblivion.
Nevertheless, a residuum of doubt remained which
spurred him to renewed effort to obtain from
No&eacute;mie the definite pledge which she continued
to withhold. Hitherto he had had the letter to be
used as an argument in case the old woman should
balk. Now&mdash;well, the girl he wanted, and her
money! were at stake; he set his jaws together.</p>

<p>To do him justice, the man loved No&eacute;mie Carrington
with all that was best&mdash;and worst&mdash;in
his nature. The light which burned in his soul
for her was not one of those pure and ardent
flames which sometimes glow like stars in the
midst of sordid and depraved souls, as unsullied
by the vice about them as a star by miasmatic

<!-- page 173 -->

fog. It was rather a lurid and sulphurous blaze
in which there mingled slight threads of purer
fire. The baser part of him fed his desire to possess
this exquisite creature who had come so
strangely into his life&mdash;a legacy from his father,
he sometimes declared to himself, with an exultant
sneer. Absent from her, he gloated feverishly
over the memory of her charms, swearing
to push, at their very next meeting, the power he
believed himself to have over her to the utmost
extreme. At such times he would rush to her
house, fling himself like a maniac into her presence&mdash;to
stand humbled before her, cowed into
decency by that nameless atmosphere which envelops
innocent womanhood. Once more out of her
sight, he would fall into blasphemous rage over
what he called his own cowardice, crying aloud
to the empty silence of his chamber his determination
to subdue her to his will; to make her fetch
and carry for him like a slave; to beat her as
he would beat a dog. At rare moments, coupling
her name with his mother's, he fell on his knees,
calling God to witness that he would no more
sully the purity of the one than the memory of
the other. In still rarer moments he told himself,

<!-- page 174 -->

with an oath, that he would marry the girl
if she were penniless; but this assertion was invariably
followed by a sardonic grin at his own
expense, and the self-admonition: "Not much,
you wouldn't, Sid, my son. Drive ahead, the
prizes, both of 'em, are pretty nearly yours; and
if worst comes to worst, you&mdash;and the old
woman&mdash;know the letter by heart."</p>

<p>Nothing of all this, however, appeared in Cortland's
outward manner. Toward Madame de
Laussan, indeed, whom he continued to see at
intervals, he maintained an air of insolent familiarity,
quite aware that, having herself once
more under control, she was watching, warily,
his slightest move. It pleased him to keep alive
and quivering the terror which he detected under
her calm exterior. To the rest of that upper
world in which he moved more and more freely,
he continued to present the same semi-mysterious
aspect, so fascinating to women. He had learned
at length the art of seeming to hold himself aloof
from the men who avoided him. In the underworld,
the congenial atmosphere of which expanded
his cramped lungs, he paid himself liberally
for all this reticence.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>And No&eacute;mie? With the sudden departure of
Allard for France, a bandage fell from her eyes.
She read her own motives by the pitiless light of
self-examination. The glamour which had once
attached to Cortland was long since dissipated.
She saw him, not, indeed, as he really was, but
at least as a man of coarse fibre, commonplace,
uninteresting, persistent, tiresome; yet she had
suffered, nay, encouraged his advances, first
through coquetry, then from resentment at Allard's
interference, finally in a frenzy of eagerness
to show the latter that the lover of Pepita,
the dancer, was less than nothing to No&eacute;mie
Carrington. She appeared at length loathsome
in her own eyes; a thousand times more culpable
than Maxime, who at least had not been
ashamed to let the world see his infatuation for
his light o' love. She remembered with pity and
self-torture the accusing sadness in his eyes that
morning in the Park when, his heart already
wrung&mdash;oh, she knew it now! Cortland had told
her!&mdash;over the death of the girl he loved, she
herself had stabbed him so cruelly, so needlessly!
The recollection of the solitary figure leaning
against the old tomb was an ever-present accusation.

<!-- page 176 -->

He had gone abroad, so Cortland had
assured her, to seek through absence and new
surroundings some solace for his grief. She
groaned aloud, pacing the night away in her dim-lit
boudoir. Oh, yes, Donald was right. There
came a time. <i>She knew</i>. It was too late, forever
too late, but at last she knew. The river had
broken its dikes; she loved him, Allard, Pepita's
lover.</p>

<p>Her first impulse had been to rid herself of
Cortland; he had become in a moment repulsive
to her, though she blamed herself bitterly for
this feeling, which seemed alike unjust to him
and unworthy of herself. During all these months
she had been reasoning herself into the belief
that she&mdash;almost&mdash;loved him. She had given
him reason to suppose that she would be his wife.
Now the thought filled her with horror; it could
not, could not be!</p>

<p>But, for the first time in her life, Madame de
Laussan, after hearing her frank confession, set
her granddaughter's wish aside. She forbade
the girl, sternly, to break with Cortland. "Not
yet, dear child, not yet," she added, almost pleadingly,
after her first vehement outburst. No&eacute;mie

<!-- page 177 -->

gazed at her with anxious eyes, feeling in the
well-known accents a strange vibration of terror.</p>

<p>"Things must go on as they are, for the present.
I command you," reiterated Madame de Laussan.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie bowed her head silently.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh&eacute;, 'sieur le vip&egrave;re!</i>" exulted Sir&egrave;ne; "who
can blind the eyes of Sir&egrave;ne? Me, I have known
from the first that the child was voodooed!
But the spell was broken. Nevertheless, <i>mon
b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>, wait, wait! Let him think what he please!
'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse will give the word. Wait, <i>b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>,
wait."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 178 -->

<div class="center" id="ch18">

<p>XVIII</p>

<p class="small">A MORNING CALL</p>

</div>

<p>NO&Eacute;MIE waited, she knew not for what.
One morning Cortland, making his customary
visit, found the young girl in the billiard-room.
A wood-fire crackled in the fireplace, for
the early November day was unusually bleak,&mdash;one
of those never-expected days which, in
Louisiana, follow, and sometimes precede, midsummer
warmth, and cause the casual sojourner to
glare, in his overcoat or furs, at the native,
and demand, with studied sarcasm, to be introduced
to the sunny South! A small rosewood
work-table of antique shape, with brass mountings,
stood at No&eacute;mie's elbow; an orderly disarray
of embroidery-silks lay in her lap; her eyes were
upon the spray of roses growing upon the strip
under her busy needle.</p>

<p>Cortland, drawing a chair near her, sat down
to feast his eyes upon her perhaps not wholly unconscious
face,&mdash;for it was immediately suffused

<!-- page 179 -->

with a rising tide of color. She had never, he
thought, seemed so desirable, so necessary to his
comfort. But he kept back the words which
crowded to his lips; he had learned to avoid
certain quicksands; he had seen with growing
irritation and alarm the involuntary stiffening of
the slight figure, the withdrawal in the deep eyes,
at the slightest reference to a future which included
himself with her. Was she about to escape
him, after all? His hands trembled a little with
repressed emotion&mdash;a little also from the effects
of last night's orgy. He rested them on the work
table, and so, inadvertently, touched a hidden
spring in a bit of carving. He started back, for
a small drawer shot open. No&eacute;mie smiled involuntarily
at the startled expression on his face.</p>

<p>"My secret drawer," she explained, "which, as
you see, reveals itself with unblushing readiness
to the first comer."</p>

<p>"Not an inviolate hiding-place, certainly," he
agreed. "What is this? The Lost Will? The
chart to a Monte Cristo Island?" He extended to
her the folded paper he had taken from the little
drawer.</p>

<p>"That," she said carelessly, unfolding and returning

<!-- page 180 -->

the sketch to his hand, "is a drawing of
the famous Lafayette Sword&mdash;<i>le sabre de mon
p&egrave;re</i>. L'oncle Grandchamps made it for me, from
memory, many years ago. I was simply daft
about that sword. When I was a child I used to
dream all sorts of romantic and impossible dreams
about it and about my little uncle Pierre." She
glanced through an open door, across an intervening
study or den, at the outer vestibule which
gave upon Pierre's Terrace. "I besought St.
Anthony of Padua nightly, with tears, to let me
find it, or if he would not grant this boon, at
least to restore it to its rightful place upon the
wall. Daily I stole into the library to see if a
miracle had been accomplished." She spoke with
an animation latterly a stranger to her lips.</p>

<p>"But the miracle was not vouchsafed," he
smiled; "since the sword is still in hiding."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"The sword of the Quest! The Sword of Madame
de Laussan's mighty oath."</p>

<p>His laugh irritated her. "The sword of my
own oath," she flashed haughtily.</p>

<p>"Do you really consider that oath, as you call
it&mdash;I call it a joke&mdash;binding?" he asked curiously;

<!-- page 181 -->

"would you really marry the finder of this
wonderful heirloom, whoever he might be?"</p>

<p>"Provided he found it within the Year and the
Day," she said gravely. "After that, <i>I am for
naebody and naebody is for me</i>." She chanted
the line with a slightly defiant air.</p>

<p>"Then," said Cortland lightly, "if I am found
prowling about the house at unseasonable hours,
in unreasonable places, please remember that such
latitude is allowed by Madame de Laussan to the
seekers."</p>

<p>"It is truly time the Knights were in harness,"&mdash;she
echoed his light tone. "It wants
but a few weeks to the eighteenth of December.
Ah, the sun is out at last!"</p>

<p>She arose and walked over to a window which
overlooked the courtyard. She was conscious of
a vague elation, though she was as yet hardly
sensible of the cause. Cortland saw the elation,
and instantly divined the cause. "She means to
use that absurd vow as a loophole to throw me
over!" he thought.</p>

<p>He closed the secret drawer; the thin <i>click</i> of
the catch echoed about the silent room.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 182 -->

<div class="center" id="ch19">

<p>XIX</p>

<p class="small">GABRIELLE VERAC</p>

</div>

<p>MONSIEUR HENRI SAINT-CYR, the distinguished
avocat, glanced at the visiting-card
brought in by a clerk, and read the short
letter of introduction which accompanied it. A
moment later he advanced with outstretched
hands to meet the tall, soldierly young man who
entered. "Welcome to Paris, Monsieur le Capitaine
Allard," he said with warmth. "You bring
with you"&mdash;he touched the letter he held with
a thin forefinger&mdash;"a world of happy memories.
L&eacute;on Grandchamps! Grizzled, doubtless, like
myself&mdash;in your eyes. To me forever young,
reckless, gay, daring, impossible! Sit down,
captain. Grandchamps! Ah! The young men of
the present day are not like those of our time,"&mdash;he
shook his head deprecatingly. "Youth
has become cautious, prudent, sober!"</p>

<p>"This sounds like an echo of l'oncle Grandchamps,"
thought Allard, listening with amused
interest, "when he rhapsodizes on <i>dans le temps</i>."</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"And the women! They, too, are become prudent,
calculating, cautious. Bah! Besides, there
are nowadays no beautiful women like those
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Dans le temps!</i>" murmured Allard involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Eh? Laugh away, my captain, laugh away!"
cried Monsieur Saint-Cyr good-humoredly. "But
they were men and women who lived in my day&mdash;the
day of L&eacute;on Grandchamps and myself and&mdash;
Pardon, my young friend, I grow garrulous. You
are come, I see," he glanced again at the note
in his hand, "on a matter of business." The
sudden transition from the gay, reminiscent tone
of the moment before to the quick, terse voice,
long adjusted to the key of affairs, was almost
startling.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have with me a letter, which&mdash;"
Allard found himself stammering confusedly.</p>

<p>The lawyer settled the <i>pince-nez</i> more firmly
on his large nose, drew a chair to his desk, swept
aside a mass of papers there, and spread out
the yellowed, faintly-rustling sheets handed him
by his client.</p>

<p>The letter, addressed to Madame Nemours de

<!-- page 184 -->

Laussan, was dated, "Avril 14, 1861, La Nouvelle
Orl&eacute;ans." It ran:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Laure</span>,&mdash;When this note reaches your hand,
through a messenger who is unacquainted with its
contents, but who has promised to withhold it&mdash;and
the child&mdash;for twenty-four hours, I will be already
beyond recall. Where I go concerns no one
but myself. Why I go I desire you alone to know&mdash;you,
who have been unfailingly kind to me,
though I think you have not liked me; you, to
whom I leave the little Mathilde.</p>

<p>I have not been happy in this wretched little
village, to which Armand brought me against the
wish of my father and my mother, and in spite
of his own solemn promise and my frantic
prayers. But I would have stayed if&mdash;why do I
waste words when I have only to tell you that I
have learned within the week by a letter from
France that my father and my mother, born,
the one (Louis) Jasmin, the other (Rosine) Rabut,
are <i>gens de couleur</i>, as you say here. What a
crime, my God! They&mdash;or at least my father
was well known in Louisiana before he went to
France. He was free; my mother and her people

<!-- page 185 -->

were his slaves. You will believe me when I tell
you that I did not know of this stain on my
birth&mdash;which they say here all the waters of the
sea cannot wash away&mdash;when I married Armand.
But in France I do not think it can be so terrible!
I have been long enough in your savage America
to know that if this secret were known it would
bring bitter disgrace upon Armand, upon his
child, and upon the proud family whose name I
bear. My going is the price of silence&mdash;on the
part of my own mother! I leave the child, and
the secret, with you; you will be a mother to
Mathilde, and this blight need never fall upon
her. <i>Armand must not know</i>. I charge this
upon you. Let him believe, as he will readily
believe, that I have been lured back to Paris&mdash;anywhere&mdash;by
those gayeties which he thinks I
pine after, and which have no part in this dull
corner of the earth. Adieu.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Gabrielle Verac de Laussan</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>"Gabrielle Verac!" Monsieur Saint-Cyr covered
his eyes with his hand. "Gabrielle Verac!
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he repeated, his voice shaken with
some uncontrollable emotion. It seemed to Allard

<!-- page 186 -->

to express at once longing regret and half-scornful
unbelief.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;pardon, Monsieur Saint-Cyr," he
inquired hesitatingly, "did you also know this
Gabrielle Verac?"</p>

<p>"If I knew Gabrielle Verac!" The avocat
arose from his chair and paced back and forth
the length of the quiet bureau. "If I knew Gabrielle
Verac! Does not even a blind man know
the sun when it beats upon his eyelids! Beautiful,
capricious, heartless, fascinating Gabrielle!
Why, my friend, Gabrielle set all Paris by the
ears during the brief year that she shone in its
sky. She was a maddening draught at which the
hearts of all men, <i>dans le temps</i>, as you say,
sipped, leaving unsatisfied thirst on the lips and
in the throat. L&eacute;on Grandchamps, by God's
grace,"&mdash;he laughed shortly,&mdash;"escaped, maybe.
I hope so. But the others of what we were
pleased to call our set beat our heads to pulp
against the wall of her caprice,&mdash;Hilaire Chenaux,
Armand de Laussan, Marigny, D'Aulnoy,
oh, all of us! quarreled among ourselves; yes, and
fought duels into the bargain, over that bewitching
piece of snow-fire! Well, Monsieur Allard,

<!-- page 187 -->

and what have you to do with the Gabrielle Verac
who trampled upon men's souls before you were
born?"</p>

<p>Again the change from the man to the lawyer,
though this time the listener perceived that it
was not made without an effort.</p>

<br/>

<p>"It will take time, and, I foresee, a considerable
expenditure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare nothing, I beg of you!" interrupted
Allard, "neither time nor expense. The matter&mdash;pardon,
monsieur&mdash;is one of life and death."</p>

<p>"All matters are." The lawyer smiled dryly,
tapping the desk with a gold pencil. "We will
do our utmost, Captain Allard. Come back&mdash;let
me see&mdash;in one month. We have now," he
consulted a calendar, "the second of November.
Drop in, say, on or about the second of December."</p>

<p>The second of December! It seemed an eternity
of waiting. Monsieur Saint-Cyr stood up.
The interview was at an end.</p>

<p>"May I ask," ventured Allard, thoroughly
chilled by the business-like attitude of the great
avocat, "whether Monsieur Saint-Cyr thinks that

<!-- page 188 -->

this&mdash;this story of&mdash;mixed blood can be
true?"</p>

<p>"It is not unlikely," returned the lawyer
gravely. "I trust you are not too much personally
interested in the affair? No hint of such an
infusion in the blood of the Veracs ever leaked
out here in Paris. But that proves nothing,
whereas&mdash; However, such conjectures lead nowhere.
In the meantime, my dear captain, you
must see Paris." The genial smile had returned
to the strong face. "It is your first visit? Ah!
Will you do Madame Saint-Cyr and myself the
honor to join us at dinner to-morrow? Or Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Monsieur Saint-Cyr," Allard said
hastily, "but I am leaving Paris to-night for&mdash;Switzerland
and Italy." The journey was an impromptu
decision; the interval of waiting would
be unbearable in any one place; any companionship
would be maddening. "On my return, I
shall be most happy."</p>

<p>"Gabrielle Verac!" muttered the lawyer, when
the door had closed on his young client and he
was alone in his book-lined office in the Rue des
Capucines. He unlocked a drawer of his desk

<!-- page 189 -->

and rummaged among its contents; when he had
found the oval case he sought, he opened it, and
sat long gazing upon the exquisite face which
looked out at him from the background of the
miniature. The smoke-like eyes, the wonderful
pale, crinkled hair, the low, white brow, the dainty
chin,&mdash;these Gabrielle Verac had bequeathed to
her half-American granddaughter whom she had
never seen. But the mouth, full, alluring, fickle,
and the smile, faintly sensuous, frankly vain,
remained Gabrielle's own.</p>

<p>The old man sighed, and a half-cynical chuckle
preceded the dropping of the miniature back
into the drawer.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 190 -->

<div class="center" id="ch20">

<p>XX</p>

<p class="small">A DISENTANGLED SKEIN</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Allard was ushered into the private
office of Monsieur Saint-Cyr on the
appointed day, he found a stranger there, an
elderly personage, spare, dark, and somewhat
severe of aspect. "Monsieur le Juge D'Aulnoy,
Capitaine Maxime Allard of the United States
Army," pronounced Monsieur Saint-Cyr formally.
"Monsieur D'Aulnoy," he added in a familiar
tone, motioning his visitors to seats and dropping
into his own chair, "is one of the comrades of my
days of folly, eh, Jacques? He was, like myself&mdash;and
others!&mdash;interested in Mademoiselle
Verac. He came up a fortnight ago from Lyons,
where he lives, to lend me his aid in the matter
which has brought you, Monsieur Allard, to
France. The very name of Gabrielle Verac," he
smiled over at the judge, who smiled, but gravely,
in return, "remains, after a lapse of forty-five
years, a spell to conjure with! But you are impatient,

<!-- page 191 -->

my young friend. At your age, even in
these colorless times, one is impatient. I will
proceed at once.</p>

<p>"The desired information"&mdash;he seated himself
comfortably on his cushions and took up a
packet of papers&mdash;"has been less difficult to procure
than I had feared. A couple of cablegrams
to New Orleans gave me a fair start. From the
replies, in cipher of course,"&mdash;he detached two
slips from the packet and laid them on one side,&mdash;"I
learned that Louis Jasmin, <i>free man of color</i>,"&mdash;Allard
winced&mdash;"Louis Jasmin, in company
with Hyppolite Rabut, his wife Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and Rosine,
their daughter, sailed for Havre, France, on
the 15th of June, 1837, on board the ship Jupiter.
A letter which followed the cablegrams"&mdash;he
placed it with the telegraph slips&mdash;"stated that
Jasmin had inherited from his father, likewise a
free man of color, a handsome plantation in the
Parish of &mdash;&mdash; and a considerable number of
negro slaves. In the winter of 1837 he sold the
plantation and the negroes, with the exception of
a few, among whom were the famille Rabut, whom
he manumitted; and, having turned all his possessions
into money, he left Louisiana, accompanied,

<!-- page 192 -->

as I have said, by Rabut, his wife, and
his sixteen-year-old daughter. Before this letter
arrived my confidential clerk had examined, in
the Bureau of Marine Affairs at Havre, the
list of passengers brought over by the Jupiter
on her voyage, ending September 27, 1837;
upon this list appear the names mentioned. Further
research revealed that soon after their arrival
at Havre Louis Jasmin and Rosine Rabut were
united in marriage.</p>

<p>"In 1840 Louis Jasmin made his appearance
at Clamart as Louis Verac. Here he purchased
a small chateau, and shortly thereafter installed
himself with Madame Verac and their little
daughter, Gabrielle, then about two years old."</p>

<p>Allard, who had been leaning forward, listening
eagerly, grew deadly pale, shrinking as if from a
blow.</p>

<p>"And here Louis Verac lived until the day
of his death, a charitable, honorable, and much
respected citizen. No suspicion of the mixed
blood of the Veracs seems ever to have entered
the heads of their neighbors. But, I hasten,"
Monsieur Saint-Cyr proceeded with great deliberation,
"to take up the thread of Gabrielle's story,&mdash;that

<!-- page 193 -->

Gabrielle afterward known, like another
enchantress of the same name, as la belle Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"The three years succeeding the marriage of
Louis Jasmin and Rosine Rabut were spent quietly
by Monsieur and Madame Louis Verac at B., a
small village in Brittany. While here the couple
adopted&mdash;on the death of her widowed mother&mdash;the
infant daughter of Georges Dupont and
Antoinette Morel, his wife,&mdash;both, though poor
and without immediate ties, belonging to the
<i>petite noblesse</i>."</p>

<p>Allard was staring at the speaker with dazed
and, as yet, uncomprehending eyes.</p>

<p>"Many of the older men and women of the
village remembered the Veracs&mdash;<i>les Br&eacute;siliens,
tr&egrave;s riches</i>&mdash;very well, and testified to their
kindness to Madame Dupont as well as to the
adoption of her infant. We took this part of
the inquiry upon ourselves&mdash;Monsieur D'Aulnoy
and myself&mdash;for the sake of Life's Morning,"&mdash;was
there a break in the dry voice? "The
present cur&eacute; of B., at that time an acolyte,
himself assisted at the baptism of Marie Louise
Gabrielle Dupont. From the parish register&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean," gasped Allard, springing to

<!-- page 194 -->

his feet and regarding the speaker with outstarting
eyes, "that Madame Armand de Laussan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly, monsieur le capitaine. Not a drop!
Her blood is as pure as your own."</p>

<p>Allard dropped, trembling, to his seat, and
covered his face with his hands. The revulsion
was almost more than he could bear.</p>

<p>"From the register," Monsieur Saint-Cyr was
repeating, "we copied <i>l'Acte de Naissance</i> and
<i>de Bapt&ecirc;me</i> of the daughter of the Duponts.
Through the courtesy of monsieur le maire of the
village we obtained from the judicial records a
copy of the certificate of adoption by Monsieur and
Madame Louis Verac of Marie Louise Gabrielle,
daughter of Georges and Antoinette Dupont."
He laid these documents on the growing pile of
papers before him.</p>

<p>"The child, adored by her adoptive parents,
whom she believed always to be hers by right
of birth, grew up to womanhood, educated and
accomplished, in the small but well-appointed
chateau at Clamart. In 1858 she came to Paris
with the Countess de G., whose country estate
joined that of the Veracs at Clamart, and was by

<!-- page 195 -->

that elegant woman of the world presented into
the <i>haute soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> of the capital. She became at
once the rage. The small coterie of whom I think
I have already spoken to you, Monsieur Allard,&mdash;Armand
de Laussan, de Marigny, and Grandchamps
of Louisiana; D'Aulnoy, eh, Jacques?
Chenaux, de Marsac, and myself, in particular,
went mad about her, each in his own way. Allard,
my friend, you doubtless imagine that you have
yourself seen beautiful women&mdash;or a beautiful
woman, since there can be but one to every man's
lifetime! Doubtless you have dreamed of houris,
exquisite, alluring, as dangerous as fire in the
blood? But whatever your imaginings, or your
dreams, they are of a poverty&mdash;<i>pouff!</i>"&mdash;he
blew away an invisible atom. "You die, I tell
you, with eyes unblessed. You never saw Gabrielle
Verac!"</p>

<p>"I have seen No&eacute;mie Carrington, her granddaughter."
The words burst unbidden from
Allard's lips. He drew back, crimsoning to the
roots of his hair.</p>

<p>The two older men exchanged covert glances.
Monsieur Saint-Cyr made as though he had not
heard. He was a wise man, the great avocat.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>"Mademoiselle Verac," he went on, "had
many suitors. For a time de Marsac, handsome,
rich, forceful, easily distanced them all; the infatuation
seemed to be mutual. I still think&mdash;well,
suddenly the engagement was announced of
la belle Gabrielle to Armand de Laussan. Monsieur
Verac gave what then seemed a strangely
reluctant consent to the marriage, with the proviso
that the young couple should reside in
France. De Laussan certainly intended to keep
to the promise thus exacted. But the gathering
clouds at home, which were a prelude to your
great Civil War, drew him irresistibly to the
country of his birth. Soon after the birth of
their child, a girl, I believe, early in 1860, if
I remember aright, he returned with his family
to Louisiana. Then came for his friends here
a gap, unbridged save by an occasional letter to
myself or another from Grandchamps or Marigny&mdash;none
from de Laussan. These letters were
concerned mostly with the preparations for approaching
war.</p>

<p>"Suddenly there fell upon us news of the
strange, inexplicable disappearance from her home
in New Orleans of Madame Armand de Laussan.

<!-- page 197 -->

It was, we heard at the time, a nine-days' wonder
in New Orleans; but it was silenced by the
growing horror of that strife which for a time
rent your country asunder. I had myself one
letter from Armand; it was written on the eve
of the first great battle of that war. It is here.
He makes no mention of the shadow which had
darkened his hearthstone other than by saying:
'I pray for a swift and merciful bullet to
my brain. I have now neither motive nor desire
for life. My daughter is in safe keeping.'
<i>Pauvre diable!</i> Long before this letter reached
me his prayer had been granted.</p>

<p>"The letter placed in my hands by you, Captain
Allard, furnishes, so far as I am aware, the
first clue ever had to the apparently causeless
desertion of her husband by Madame Armand de
Laussan. Unless she herself made more explicit
explanations to his family,&mdash;and it would appear
that she did not,&mdash;we must read the story
between the lines of this note. Pleasure-loving,
spoiled, capricious, unused withal to discipline, la
belle Gabrielle pined perhaps in her new home for
Paris&mdash;her bright Paris!&mdash;and adulation. Who
can blame her, poor child! The astounding revelation

<!-- page 198 -->

made her by Madame Verac,&mdash;it is vain at
this distance of time to surmise why she made it;
possibly in a fit of jealous longing for the daughter
of her love; possibly from terror lest her
own and her husband's past should rise up, yonder,
and destroy, without warning, that daughter's
future,&mdash;these taken together were enough
to drive a woman like Gabrielle Verac to flight.
The child? I have never been able to imagine la
belle Gabrielle as a mother." Monsieur Saint-Cyr's
voice was tinged with a certain irritation.
"For another woman to leave her child&mdash;her
daughter!&mdash;exposed to the same danger which
menaced herself, would certainly be incredible.
For Gabrielle Verac&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders.
"But what follows is more inexplicable still.
Madame Armand de Laussan came direct to Paris
from Havre, after her voyage from America, and
proceeded, after less than half a day in Paris, and
without turning aside to visit her parents at Clamart,
to Montpellier, where she was immediately
received as a novice in the Convent of the Ursulines.
Two years later she took the final vows.
Why? Why? I have asked myself the question
a thousand times."</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>"De Marsac," said D'Aulnoy sombrely, breaking
silence for the first time, "fell in a duel with
Justin Belcourt, two days before Madame de
Laussan reached Paris."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Complete silence reigned for a moment
in the bureau. "Her reputed parents,"
resumed the lawyer, "visited Madame de Laussan
from time to time at the convent near Montpellier;
and on the death of Verac, which followed that
of his wife, in 1864, she came into possession of
his estate. This is the story, monsieur, or as
much of it as, perhaps, will ever be known."</p>

<p>Allard took the papers handed him by the
lawyer, with hands that trembled with the irregular
bounding of his pulse. The tense strain
under which he had lived since his chance meeting
with Cortland, six weeks before, had kept
him keyed to abnormal exaltation; the reaction
left him limp and exhausted. He grasped the
hands extended to him, in an ecstasy of wordless
gratitude. No&eacute;mie! No&eacute;mie! he hardly refrained
from shouting the name aloud. His was a joy
like that of some sexless messenger from heaven,
no thought of himself thrusting a moted ray
into the pure light that flooded his soul.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>"Yet a moment, my friend," said Monsieur
Saint-Cyr, for Allard had seized his hat and was
already at the door in his eagerness to be gone;
"la belle Gabrielle&mdash;"</p>

<p>Allard started; he had already forgotten la
belle Gabrielle!</p>

<p>"&mdash;is still living, as you have doubtless
guessed; <i>religieuse</i> in the Convent of the Ursulines
at Montpellier. Her name in religion is Sister
Mary of the Angels."</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Monsieur D'Aulnoy.</p>

<p>"You are right, Jacques," smiled Monsieur
Saint-Cyr, answering his friend's unspoken
thought; "it should be Venus of the Butterflies.
God forgive me," he added gravely; "for, as a
butterfly from a chrysalis-grub, so, perhaps, an
angel from a butterfly! If you desire to see her,
Captain Allard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do desire it," returned Allard.</p>

<p>"Then, since it has been because of you that
the story of her birth has been brought to light,
you may not be unwilling to charge yourself with
the pleasant duty of assuring Madame Armand de
Laussan veuve that her blood is as free of taint
as that of the proudest de Laussan in Louisiana."

<!-- page 201 -->

The old man's lip curled cynically as he added,
"I find myself, if you will pardon me for saying
so, a little apart from your extreme point of view
in this matter."</p>

<p>Allard had recoiled at the first words with
a half-uttered protest; but Monsieur Saint-Cyr
continued imperturbably: "Here is a note presenting
you to the Mother Superior of the Convent
at Montpellier. Her permission and that of
the Archbishop of the Diocese, both of whom
chance to be old friends of my family, for a
private interview with the nun known as S&oelig;ur
Marie des Anges, have already been obtained."</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch21">

<p>XXI</p>

<p class="small">SISTER MARY OF THE ANGELS</p>

</div>

<p>TWENTY-FOUR hours later Allard found
himself awaiting with self-confessed trepidation
the advent of the woman long buried, yet possessing
in her grave, as it were, power to stir the
pulses of the men about whom she had cast her
spell nearly half a century earlier. He had been
ushered through the tall, barred gateway, along
a tree-shaded walk, and into the sunny but austere-looking
reception room, by a silent portress.
Madame M&egrave;re had received him with an aloof
graciousness, her kindly but distant smile resembled
a winter sunbeam gleaming through a wall
of ice. Nothing in her manner, or in the appearance
of the age-worn building within its guarded
walls, hinted at the storm at that moment threatening
the religious orders in France, which was
shortly to sweep them out of their ancient groove
of existence.</p>

<p>Left alone, Allard was beginning to feel the
unwonted silence about him oppressive. He arose

<!-- page 203 -->

from his chair and walked aimlessly about, half
ashamed of an almost overpowering longing to
escape.</p>

<p>"Monsieur desires to speak&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>The voice, though rich and deep, was curiously
monotonous. Allard turned quickly; the mere
presence of the veiled and shrouded figure standing
just within the doorway struck chill to his
already benumbed veins.</p>

<p>"Upon a family matter, madame," he stammered,
conscious that his words were awkward
and commonplace.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is mistaken. I have no family.
And no interest beyond these convent walls."
She was already turning to go.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I beg Madame Armand de
Laussan to accord me a moment's attention."</p>

<p>"Monsieur is again in error. I am not Madame
Armand de Laussan."</p>

<p>There was neither sadness nor curiosity in the
dispassionate tones. Allard shivered slightly, but
hurried on as if she had not interrupted.</p>

<p>"And if the papers which I hold in my
hand are not of interest to Madame Armand de
Laussan, or to Gabrielle Verac&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 204 -->

<p>"Gabrielle Verac!" There was sudden but
momentary sharpness in the echo. "Gabrielle
Verac, monsieur,"&mdash;the dry tone had returned,&mdash;"like
Madame Armand de Laussan, is long
dead."</p>

<p>"&mdash;she will perhaps concede that they may
be of importance to her descendants," finished
Allard boldly. "And particularly to the daughter
of Mathilde de Laussan," he added, with a
sudden break in his voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! She left a child, then, Mathilde? To
inherit the taint," the low murmur barely reached
the strained ears of her listener. "Poor creature!"</p>

<p>Allard felt as if he were beating against a dead
wall, or battling with impalpable shadows. Her
cold indifference stung him to passion.</p>

<p>"Madame, I entreat you. There is no taint.
There never was! See for yourself." He thrust
the papers almost roughly into the hand outstretched
to repel him,&mdash;the certificates of birth
and baptism of Marie Louise Gabrielle, daughter
of Georges and Antoinette Dupont, and the
record of the adoption of the said Marie Louise
Gabrielle by Louis and Rosine Verac.</p>

<p>The pale fingers closed on them mechanically.</p>

<!-- page 205 -->

<p>The nun walked swiftly and noiselessly to the
window, swept her veil aside, and unfolded the
papers one after another. At last Allard caught
a glimpse of the features which lived so vividly
in the memory of the great lawyer of the Rue des
Capucines. They were pale as marble, even
the lips once so alluringly red. But time had
not touched the fine, straight eyebrows, the curling,
silken lashes which swept the sunken cheeks,
nor the cloud-dark eyes, violet-shaded, luminous
in their deep sockets. These rested upon him
enigmatically, as Sister Mary of the Angels moved
again across the room and stood before him, unveiled
still, strangely, mysteriously, indefinably
beautiful,&mdash;far more beautiful, even now, than
No&eacute;mie; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>She was speaking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank you, Monsieur Allard, for your good
intention," the monotony was gone from the full
voice; there rang in its stead something vaguely
antagonistic. "I should, I suppose, be filled with
rapture by the discovery that I am not that thing
to be abhorred, a <i>femme de couleur</i>. But I
leave rapture&mdash;and gratitude&mdash;to the illustrious
famille de Laussan," the ashen lips were crisped

<!-- page 206 -->

by a disdainful smile. "For myself, monsieur,
these,"&mdash;she dropped the precious records one
by one upon the small table by which she stood,&mdash;"these
ravish from me, see you! my father and
my mother, and give me in return merely a cold,
unvalued fact, namely, that my blood is, as they
say in Louisiana, 'pure;' and that the de Laussans
have not poisoned theirs by mixing it with
that of Gabrielle Verac. I loved my father, Louis
Verac, quadroon, mulatto, if you will. For he
was my father by everything that makes for
fatherhood,&mdash;love, tenderness, care, protection,
the most loyal heart and the noblest gentleman
I have ever known&mdash;save one. And <i>he</i>, ah,
what did he care whether there were taint in
my blood or no? He loved me!" The rich
voice vibrated with exultation, and the stiff figure
swayed, graceful as a wind-blown lily, under the
sweep of feeling. "But <i>he</i> was dead when I
came back&mdash;to him, to him, you understand?
Killed defending my name from dishonor. . . .
And now, you are come to tell me that they have
taken away from me my father and my mother!
I cast their miserable 'proofs' back into their
teeth! Why?"&mdash;she whirled suddenly upon

<!-- page 207 -->

Allard,&mdash;"why have you come so far to do a
thing so cruel? By what right have you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie," faltered Allard, scarcely aware of
what he said, but moved by a mighty desire to
clear himself from some unjust accusation; "it is
for No&eacute;mie."</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie? Ah, my&mdash;my granddaughter!
Yes? You love her, this No&eacute;mie?" A wave of color
swept over her pale face, brightening it into still
rarer loveliness. "You love her! But no, you do
not love her," she continued contemptuously; "if
you loved her, what would it have mattered to
you, this stigma, this pollution, which is supposed
to have come down to her from Louis Verac!"</p>

<p>"I love her," affirmed Allard, "so well that I
have already stated to her guardian, Major L&eacute;on
Grandchamps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"L&eacute;on, L&eacute;on Grandchamps!" breathed the
nun dreamily.</p>

<p>"&mdash;my desire to marry Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie
de Laussan Carrington, though she should prove to
be in truth the lineal descendant of Louis Verac."</p>

<p>She drew nearer; her eyes brooded strangely
upon him. "No&eacute;mie! my&mdash;my granddaughter!
She loves you, then!"</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>"Alas, no, madame."</p>

<p>He could never remember afterwards just what
words he used in telling; they poured from his
lips unbidden, unchosen. He only knew that
he had related the story in all its details; beginning
with the domiciliary visit of Butler's Provost
Guard to the h&ocirc;tel de Laussan, under command
of a Captain Cortland; the last interview of
the lad, Pierre de Laussan, with his mother, with
the little Mathilde lying like a white flower upon
the sombre cushions of the couch; the theft
of the box, with the letter written by Madame
Armand de Laussan to her sister-in-law; the
intervening years which had witnessed the
marriage of Richard Carrington to Mathilde de
Laussan, and the death of both; the childhood of
No&eacute;mie, their daughter, under the fostering care
of Madame Nemours de Laussan; her beautiful
and glowing young womanhood; the appearance
of Cortland <i>fils</i>, with all its disgraceful and
disastrous consequences;&mdash;he not only told all
these things, but when he had concluded his
whole soul lay bare before this woman whom,
until now, he had never seen! To the day of his
death, the memory of it&mdash;and of her&mdash;will thrill

<!-- page 209 -->

Maxime Allard, as the name of la belle Gabrielle
continues to thrill the grizzled graybeards who
once, in their far-away youth, loved her.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"You will say to Laure de Laussan that Mary
the Nun thanks her for the faithful fulfillment of
a trust laid upon her&mdash;with little thought&mdash;by
Gabrielle Verac. And you will tell No&eacute;mie&mdash;
No&eacute;mie!&mdash;that the&mdash;the grandmother whom
she will never behold sends a blessing upon her
union with Maxime Allard."</p>

<p>"Madame!"</p>

<p>"She loves you," said la S&oelig;ur Marie des
Anges, with quick imperiousness; "have I been
la belle Gabrielle for nothing?"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;has madame no message for Henri
Saint-Cyr, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>What she might have said he could never
conjecture; there was the faintest rustle of garments
through the corridor without; the tall
form, which for an instant had recovered the
supple and magnetic grace of la belle Gabrielle,
stiffened, like a corpse that had been galvanized,
into the rigid contours of Sister Mary of the
Angels.</p>

<!-- page 210 -->

<p>"<i>Merci, monsieur. Adieu</i>," she said formally,
as the portress entered. Her voice had the
whispering sound of a dry leaf blown upon the
wind.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 211 -->

<div class="center" id="ch22">

<p>XXII</p>

<p class="small">THE SWORD</p>

</div>

<p>ONE morning&mdash;it chanced to be upon the
same day that Captain Allard heard in the
quiet office in the Rue des Capucines the story
of Gabrielle Verac&mdash;there was enacted at the
old de Laussan mansion in New Orleans a scene
at once surprising and dramatic.</p>

<p>A hazy sunshine, mellow and soft, flooded the
courtyard. Cortland, walking back and forth
along the trellised rose-way with No&eacute;mie Carrington,
had stopped to read the shadow on the sundial
which stood in its own triangle of grassy
sward near the entrance to the inner, smaller
court. The batten-gate set in the brick dividing-wall
stood open. The young man, glancing
through, uttered an exclamation of pleased surprise.
Uncle Mink, kneeling near, trowel in hand,
looked up from the violet-border, and growled
under his breath like an aroused watchdog. He
got up to lay a withered hand upon the arm

<!-- page 212 -->

of his young mistress, who had paused in passing.</p>

<p>"Step mo' keerful, honey," he half whispered;
"rattlesnakes is crawlin' in de grass."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Mink!" she laughed, "you old
rascal! you know there isn't a rattler this side of
Bayou St. Jean. What do you mean?" She patted
his hand affectionately.</p>

<p>"Neb mine, Miss No-<i>mee</i>. Dess you do lak yo'
Unk' Mink tell you. Step lak you was steppin'
on aiggs. I see thripple this minute!"</p>

<p>"Miss Carrington,"&mdash;Cortland had turned
and was walking toward her,&mdash;"I realize for the
first time the blue cascade whose praises you have
been singing!" He indicated with a sweep of his
hand the luxuriant growth of blossoming plumbago
which outlined Pierre's Terrace. "I have
never seen it before from below. It is wonderful."</p>

<p>"Is it not!" assented No&eacute;mie, her listless eyes
brightening. "I am very jealous for the fame
of that blue girdle. They tell me that beside the
Queen's Walk in the Alhambra there is a downward
sweeping fall of plumbago five times as
royal as mine. But of course I do not believe it.

<!-- page 213 -->

You have never seen this gate open before?
How odd! Yes, let us go over."</p>

<p>She followed him across the flagged and walled
square, in one corner of which stood the detached
building used as a coach-house and stable. They
seated themselves upon the stone bench within
the loggia, as on a former occasion. How long
ago it seemed to the girl, resting her head against
the stuccoed wall of the house, and closing her
eyes; how remote! A brown and gold glory of
nasturtiums filled, as on that morning, the tall
stone urns; clouds of yellow butterflies hovered
over them; their faint odor mingled with the
heavy perfume of Grand Duke jessamine abloom
beside them. A fringe of withering sweet-alyssum
bordered the inner edge of the brick flower-box,
the sarcophagus where the plumbago burrowed
deep its sturdy roots. A single bee droned
patiently in and out, seeking if he might find somewhere
a lingering drop of sweet. The stillness as
of a spot far removed from everyday sounds was
broken only by Uncle Mink's voice, low, rich, unctuous,
rising and falling in a dolorous spiritual,
which was interrupted by occasional admonitions
to Old Babe, both unseen beyond the wall.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"<i>I walks in de dew an' de dew is sweet;<br/>

Gwine to walk to glory,<br/>

Glory!<br/>

I looks at my han's an' I looks at my feet</i>,</p>

<p>(Pick up dem heels o' yo'n, Ole Babe, er I

<p class="small"><i>Glory!<br/>

<p>(Whyn't you wrop yo' ha'r, Ole Babe? You

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Glory!</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How long ago that moonlighted night! And
what a senseless fool she had been not to know&mdash;this,
<i>this</i>. She shivered, for Cortland's sleeve had
accidentally brushed her own, and drew away,
ever so slightly. The wave of physical loathing,
to which she was becoming used, swept over her
from head to foot; she had almost cried out.</p>

<p>"I will tell him now, this instant," she said resolutely
to herself; "no matter what may happen.
My grandmother&mdash;<i>pauvre m&egrave;re!</i> She does not,
cannot, understand. I can endure it no longer.
Oh, if Maxime&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>At the unspoken name the red surged into
the throat, which had become almost too thin
for beauty, the silken eyelashes trembled against
the marble cheek; the palpitation of her heart
made speech impossible. "In&mdash;in&mdash;a moment,"
she panted within herself, "I&mdash;will tell him."</p>

<p>He had been regarding her; an expression of
uncertainty crossed his face from moment to
moment, succeeded immediately by one of exultation.
Finally, as if his thought had found and
met hers face to face, his square jaws tightened
into hardness; he dropped his elbows on his
knees and leaned forward, idly prodding the
earth in the brick box with the slender cane in
his hands.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cortland&mdash;" No&eacute;mie's manner was grave
and untremulous.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Cortland had leaped to his feet;
he stood staring down at the flower-box with
dilated eyes. "No&eacute;mie! Miss Carrington!" he
said excitedly, "you will laugh at me, I suppose,
but&mdash;but a curious thought has just come to
me&mdash;like a flash. May I&mdash;tell me, has any
one ever&mdash;? Stay, will you excuse me for a
moment?"</p>

<!-- page 216 -->

<p>He ran hurriedly down the terrace-steps, and
disappeared into the outer court. No&eacute;mie had
arisen, and remained, bewildered, where he left
her. Presently he reappeared, bounding like an
eager schoolboy across the intervening space,
and upon the terrace. He carried Uncle Mink's
garden spade in his hand; Uncle Mink himself
limped at his heels, disgust written all over
his black face. Old Babe, egg-eyed, giggling,
brought up the rear of the impromptu procession.</p>

<p>"You will let me try, will you not? Pardon!"
Cortland was throwing off his coat. "Of course
it is a chance in a thousand. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded No&eacute;mie,
frowning, a slight hauteur showing in the well-known
up-throw of her head.</p>

<p>"Only this," said Cortland, his voice still
quivering with excitement; "perhaps I am but
dreaming of fool's gold. Still&mdash;<i>we may find
the Lafayette sword!</i>"</p>

<p>"Where?" cried the girl, startled. She looked
up at the balconied turret, as if the long-lost
weapon might, by some magic, be suspended
there.</p>

<p>"Here. Here, in the flower-box. You have

<!-- page 217 -->

said yourself that it remains just as it was then,
when Pierre de Laussan, your uncle, went away.
Except for the replanting of roots and seeds,
the earth may never have been touched. And
see, the box is more than four feet deep; the
sword could lie far below the roots! You know
it was here that Pierre waited for Hercule."</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, breathlessly, running his
palm up and down the handle of the spade.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie's clasped hands were pressed against
her heart. She had instant conviction that the
long quest was ended; that the ardently desired
moment had come, when the past would yield up
its secret. And in place of the rapturous delight
which she had imagined herself feeling at such a
moment, despair clutched at her heart!</p>

<p>"Snakes is crawlin' in de grass," muttered
Uncle Mink, standing at her elbow; "I feels it."</p>

<p>A low whistle escaped the pursed lips of Old
Babe, hunched upon the railing.</p>

<p>Cortland, oblivious of these cross-gales, kept
his eyes fixed upon No&eacute;mie's face. An almost
imperceptible movement of the head finally rewarded
his gaze. The girl dropped nerveless
upon the bench, but her frightened, fascinated

<!-- page 218 -->

eyes remained set upon the alien, the outsider,
whose muscular arms drove the spade lower and
lower into the packed loam of the box; turning
the clods this way and that with deliberate haste;
getting, she felt it, nearer and nearer to that
treasure which her own people for two generations&mdash;which
Maxime!&mdash;had sought in vain.</p>

<p>The uprooted alyssum dropped out upon the
terrace floor; the droning bee hid himself among
the shaken branches of the plumbago, dragged
out in its turn and laid aside; the pile of rich,
black earth grew higher; the girl's heart beat
more quickly; now with an infusion of hope.
It surely was not there!</p>

<p>Cortland threw down the spade and seated
himself, panting a little, on the bench beside her.
He laughed ruefully, showing the well-nigh blistered
palms of his large, handsome hands. "Fool's
gold!" he admitted, in a tone of deep dejection;
"I wonder if you will ever forgive me! At least,
I trust the plumbago roots are uninjured. I will
reset them at once. If your blue girdle should
suffer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried No&eacute;mie, smiling, one would have
said gratefully, "do not think of that. It was

<!-- page 219 -->

worth trying for. We would never have been
satisfied if we had not tried." <i>We!</i> She could
afford to be magnanimous! She breathed a
prayer of thankfulness, as for a great danger
overpast.</p>

<p>"Well!"&mdash;he got to his feet, this time slowly,
&mdash;"let us repair the ravages." He threw a
spadeful of earth into the box.</p>

<p>"Don't," said No&eacute;mie; "Uncle Mink will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One more try," muttered Cortland half aloud.
He pushed the spade in, leaning far over the box.
No&eacute;mie heard a faint grating; the bottom!</p>

<p>"<i>Ah!</i>" Cortland's voice seemed to echo up as
from a well; his head and shoulders were dipped
forward into the excavation he had made. He
had laid the spade aside and was digging with
his hands.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>He laid the ancient sword upon the table in
the library, and stepped back with that air of
anxious deference, long discarded when alone
with Madame de Laussan. The damp loam still
clung to the scabbard and belt-buckle, both
encrusted with rust. The silver and gold mountings
were tarnished almost to blackness. Only

<!-- page 220 -->

the great jewel, set in the scroll-work of the hilt,
flashed in the softened light of the room like a
flaming eye, untouched by mould, or rust, or
time.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan, sitting in her high-backed
chair drawn up near the table, looked long&mdash;her
brain teeming with God knows what memories!&mdash;at
the familiar and unforgotten heirloom.
A fluttering sigh, exhaled from her blanched lips,
gave the only sign that life stirred within her.
Her cold grasp tightened upon No&eacute;mie's hand
nestled in her own; but without a glance at the
young face, as set as hers, she bent her head in
token of acceptance.</p>

<p>"The Quest is ended&mdash;No&eacute;mie?" His utterance
was shaken by an emotion more unmixed
with selfishness than any he had ever known. For
the moment all egotism, every mean consideration,
was swept out of sight. A strange humility
softened his features; he extended his hand,
which trembled, toward the girl; hers, slowly
outreached, met his above the recovered sword,
and lay passively in the blistered palm.</p>

<p>She had accepted Fate.</p>

<p>XXIII</p>

<p class="small">OLD BABE</p>

</div>

<p>FOR a month and more there had been a rare
flutter throughout the <i>Vieux Carr&eacute;</i> and the
<i>Quartier Am&eacute;ricain</i> of New Orleans. Snatches
of eighteenth-century music, thin, sweet, aerial,
were whistled on street-corners, strummed on
guitar and piano, "patted" by gamins along the
banquettes; more coherent strains floated out
into the night from salon and boudoir, where
belles and beaux were rehearsing <i>menuet</i> and
<i>gavotte</i> to be danced by chosen groups at the Great
Centennial Ball in preparation for the eighteenth
of December, the ball commemorating the transfer
of the Province of Louisiana from France to
the United States one hundred years before,
1803.</p>

<p>Old prints and dog-eared "Books of Costumes,"
dragged from their hiding-places, or disgorged
by the reluctant Petitpain, were spread upon
tables for the better convenience of the eager

<!-- page 222 -->

young heads clustered above them; fresh young
voices discussed, amid shrieks of laughter, the
shocking scantiness and the absurd prettiness of
the Directoire gown; slim young fingers sketched
outlines of Empire corsage, or Colonial scarf;
young tresses were "tried" in impossible coiffures;
from ancient closets and time-polished
cedar-chests came forth great-great grandmamma's
flowered brocade, stiff enough to stand alone
(as if that were a virtue, sniffed my Lady Disdain),
her lace handkerchief, yellow, smelling of dried
rose leaves, her red-heeled satin slippers, frayed
at the toes with much dancing, the high-backed
comb presented by the handsome Spanish Governor-General
Galvez to papa's great-great-great
grande cousine; the dangling earrings worn by
an ancestress at one of the Marquis de Vaudreuil's
famous routs; the Watteau fan carried by the wife
of the first American Governor; the body-waist
of a French Commandant's Virginian bride.</p>

<p>The dead-and-gone belles who wore these narrow
slips, danced in these buckled slippers, flirted
with these fans of a bygone day,&mdash;surely they
would have turned in their oven-vaults in the
cimeti&egrave;re St. Louis could they have beheld their

<!-- page 223 -->

graceless descendants overhauling, with flippant
giggles and contemptuous flouts, their cherished
finery! Yet more surely still would they have
settled back into their places with satisfied
smiles, seeing how bewitching those same descendants
were, tricked out in their own treasured
gear!</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie Carrington, by virtue of her direct
descent from Antoine de Laussan and from Raoul
Destrehan,&mdash;that Castor-and-Pollux pair who
came over from France when the Province was
young, and who left behind them a fiery record
made up of adventures in love and war,&mdash;was included
in the list of dancers of the gavotte. She
found in the rehearsals, and in the eager search
after correct costumes, an escape from Cortland's
irritating presence. The poor child felt&mdash;Quixotic
as this may seem&mdash;bound by honor to the finder
of the lost sword, whom curious destiny, passing
over all others, had decreed should be Cortland.
The engagement was still a family secret. "No,
not until the day after the ball," she said decisively,
at each of those constrained and almost
wholly silent daily interviews with her lover,
when he urged a public announcement. Upon

<!-- page 224 -->

this Major Grandchamps also insisted, though
unaware of the girl's real feelings.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan had taken to her own
apartment the day the Lafayette sword, cleansed
of mould and purged of rust, had been restored
to its place above the library mantel; the day Cortland,
in the short regulation interview with her,
had said at parting: "I have her at last. Mine!
Mine! And let me warn you, once for all, madame,
the least symptom of drawing back on your part
or hers&mdash;<i>the letter!</i>"</p>

<p>"At least he will keep silent now, for his wife's
sake," she whispered over and over again to
Sir&egrave;ne. "Oh, but certainly, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse," the
mulattress invariably replied; and as invariably
added between her teeth, "<i>Coquin!</i> he is capable
of telling all to the first comer. May the bones rot
in his body! for 'Sieur Maxime is surely dead."</p>

<p>"I wish I might stay at home with you, <i>ma
m&egrave;re</i>," sobbed No&eacute;mie, the night of the ball, on
her knees beside Madame de Laussan's couch, her
bright young head prone on the older woman's
breast. "If I could only die&mdash;before to-morrow!
I hate him so, <i>ma m&egrave;re</i>, I hate him so!
Why must I marry a man I hate? Surely God

<!-- page 225 -->

will forgive us both if we break that foolish
oath."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan started; she had in truth
forgotten the oath&mdash;long ago!&mdash;nor had she
fairly realized until this moment that No&eacute;mie was
unaware of her own powerful reason for allowing
the marriage. "<i>Pauvre enfant</i>," she murmured,
drawing the girl closer within her arms. She lifted
despairing eyes to Sir&egrave;ne standing at the foot of
the couch. "Shall I tell her the truth?" the eyes
mutely questioned. "Shall I kill one horror with
another? Shall I?" "No, no. Not now, 'Tite
Ma&icirc;tresse," Sir&egrave;ne's blazing eyes returned.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon tr&eacute;sor</i>, my cherished,"&mdash;the old voice
was heart-breakingly tender,&mdash;"go now; it is
time to dress. Make thyself beautiful, <i>mon b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>"For the last time,"&mdash;No&eacute;mie bent over to
caress the fevered cheek,&mdash;"I will, <i>ma m&egrave;ere</i>.
As for to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>The artificial gayety of her manner was underlaid
with something like defiance. The two
women looked after her apprehensively as she
left the room.</p>

<p>"I will tell her to-morrow," declared Madame
de Laussan slowly.</p>

<!-- page 226 -->

<p>"You will <i>not</i> tell her," stormed Sir&egrave;ne; "it is
not true, 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse; Madame Gabrielle lied!
Is it that you wish to murder her, our <i>b&eacute;b&eacute;!</i>
Me, I will not permit it. The <i>cocodril!</i> the dog!
Pardon, my angel, my mistress! pardon." She
dropped to the floor, and drew the bare feet of
her mistress against her forehead in token of submission.</p>

<p>"I will tell her to-morrow," repeated Madame
de Laussan.</p>

<br/>

<p>The maid, whose deft fingers had been busy
about the radiant figure standing in front of the
cheval-glass, drew back for a last critical survey
of her young mistress, then retired with a deep
sigh of content. It wanted yet a half hour to
the time set for the arrival of Madame and
Mademoiselle Berthet with the carriage. No&eacute;mie
sank listlessly into a chair, clasping her knee with
her ungloved hands, and gazing abstractedly into
the smouldering embers in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Old Babe, permitted to assist at the toilette,
crouched at her feet, caressing with brown, velvety
fingers the slender ankles in their silken gear.</p>

<p>"Miss No-<i>mee</i>, you sho' do beat de Queen o'

<!-- page 227 -->

Rex! D'ain't nobody kin tech you." The small
handmaid nodded an ecstatic head.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie was indeed beautiful, despite the now
habitual pallor of her cheeks, and the sadness
which circled her starry eyes with violet rings.
The short-waisted gown of satin brocade, which
clung so closely to her slight form, was the tint
of old ivory from age; so was the fall of priceless
lace upon the low corsage, and the quaintly-puffed
short sleeves; a jeweled clasp, which once
adorned the waist of a queen of France, drew
into place the broad rose-colored sash; the glittering
buckles, mementos of the same hapless
queen, shone on her red-heeled dancing-shoes.
The de Laussan diamonds sparkled in the up-piled
puffs and curls of her coiffure; the milk-white
Destrehan pearls melted into the whiter
neck and arms.</p>

<p>"Reckin you gwine to dance dat Virginny-reel
wi' Mist' Cotelan', ain't you, Miss No-<i>mee</i>?"
Old Babe rounded her lips enigmatically.</p>

<p>"No, Old Babe," returned her mistress absently.</p>

<p>"<i>Hmp!</i> He's plum pi'zen, dat Mist' Cotelan'."
No&eacute;mie, gazing into the coals, made no reply.

<!-- page 228 -->

Old Babe, unabashed, presently resumed her
inquiries. "Huccum Mist' Cotelan' to mek sech
a'miration 'bout findin' dat swode tether day,
when he done bury it dar hisse'f?"</p>

<p>"What are you saying, Old Babe?" demanded
No&eacute;mie, frowning, as if the words had fallen on
ears but half open.</p>

<p>"I say, what <i>mek</i> dat white man 'ten' lak he
am' nuver seed dat swode, when he done dug it
inter dat flower-box hisse'f?"</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" No&eacute;mie sat up, suddenly electrified.
"Are you crazy, Old Babe? What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"No'm. I ain' crazy. An' I ain' lyin'," said
Old Babe with dignity. "An' I knows what I'm
a-sayin'. Caze, <i>I seen him do it!</i>"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;<i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"Wi' dese here two eyes. I seen him, yas'm."</p>

<p>"Old Babe, tell me at once, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yas'm, fo' Gawd, I gwine to tell de trut'!

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"Old Babe, if you don't tell me what you know,
I will call Uncle Mink this minute," cried No&eacute;mie,
exasperated. "Go <i>on!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yas'm; I wuz thes quoiled up under de billium-room

chuckle. "Hit wuz dark ez pitch. Seemlak

<p>No&eacute;mie had leaped to her feet; her eyes shot

<!-- page 231 -->

sparkles, her white bosom heaved. "Old Babe,"&mdash;she
stooped until she brought her scarlet
cheek close against the child's black one; she
spoke slowly, almost sternly,&mdash;"listen, Old
Babe. Do you know what happens to people
when they do not tell the truth?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, yas'm," returned Old Babe complacently;
"Gawd A'mighty strikes 'em bline;
an' ole black Satun shivels 'em up."</p>

<p>"You saw Mr. Cortland take a sword out of a
bundle of billiard-cues?"</p>

<p>"Sticks? Yas, Miss No-<i>mee</i>."</p>

<p>"And you saw him dig a hole in the flower-box
on Pierre's Terrace, and put that sword in
the hole, and cover it over?"</p>

<p>"Yas'm, Miss No-<i>mee</i>, I wuz quoiled up under
de billium-winder. I seed him dig dat hole an'
bury dat swode. I wuz scrooch-up behine de big
water-jar. Fo' Gawd, I ain' lyin', Miss No-<i>mee</i>."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Old Babe. But you must not
tell anybody else, understand? You are a good
girl, Old Babe,"&mdash;she had scurried across the
room and was rummaging in the drawers of her
dressing-table,&mdash;"here's a sash-ribbon for you,
Old Babe, and some stockings, silk, Old Babe,

<!-- page 232 -->

and a silver thimble, and some beads, and a fan
with only one stick broken, and yes! a gold
ring." She tossed these articles one by one to
Old Babe, whose face, for ecstatic joy, fairly
matched her own.</p>

<p>"Yes, F&eacute;lise, I am coming,"&mdash;for the maid at
the door was announcing the carriage. "Good-night,
Old Babe, the False Prince will be riding
away to-morrow; and the True Prince&mdash;the
True Prince, Old Babe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yas'm, Miss No-<i>mee</i>," said Old Babe, bewildered,
but showing her teeth in an appreciative
grin.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie flew down the stairs on light feet&mdash;the
same stairs, the same feet, which, two hours
before, were so toilsome the one, and so leaden
the other. She was humming "Colinette &agrave; la
Cour" as she approached Madame de Laussan's
bedside.</p>

<p>"Why, No&eacute;mie! Why, my adored!" Madame
de Laussan raised herself on her elbow to stare
at this embodiment of youth, hope, loveliness,
gayety.</p>

<p>"Will I do, <i>ma m&egrave;re?</i>" cried the girl, whirling
her scant skirts into a "cheese," and sinking

<!-- page 233 -->

demurely to the floor. "Will the shades of the
de Laussan and the Destrehan be content?" The
echoes of her laughter ran like sprites about the
dimly-lit bedchamber.</p>

<p>"I think she is going mad!" whispered Sir&egrave;ne,
awestruck, when the door had closed and
the strains of "Colinette &agrave; la Cour" came back,
muffled but spirited, from the stair.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan covered her face with
her hands. "The night before her execution,"
she quoted softly from a family chronicle, "the
young Marquise de Laussan danced in a gavotte
in the prison of the Conciergerie. The Comte
de G. records that her innocent gayety was as
unrestrained as if the morrow were to dawn upon
her <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i>."</p>

<p>XXIV</p>

<p class="small">THE GAVOTTE</p>

</div>

<p>NEW ORLEANS, on the night of the eighteenth
of December, nineteen hundred and
three, was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>. From the upper tip of her crescent,
resting upon the sodded levee at Southport,
to the lower horn which nestles amid the
magnolias of Jackson Barracks, a dazzling procession
of electric lights threw a clear radiance upward
to the sky, and showered silver mist into the
Mississippi; the warships, French, Spanish, and
American, riding at anchor in mid-stream, were
outlined in fire whose broken reflection turned
the water below to a restless tossing of molten
gold; the streets, gay with the flags of three
nations, were a network of shining roadways, all
leading in the direction of the French Opera
House in Rue Bourbon, the centre, as it were the
heart, of this Thousand and Second Night. Here
carriages, an endless succession, were arriving,
pausing to discharge their occupants, hurrying

<!-- page 235 -->

on to give place. The great double entrance stairway
swarmed with ascending guests; the narrow
banquettes, the projecting balconies, the sloping
roofs around, were packed with humanity, noisy,
good-humored, ejaculating humanity. Within
the vast amphitheatre&mdash;proscenium boxes, loges
d&eacute;couvertes, loges grill&eacute;es, baignoires, banes&mdash;was
equally packed with humanity; but silken-clad,
jeweled, starred: stately women and slender maids,
beautiful in carefully considered toilettes; men in
evening-dress; naval and military officers in full
uniform; ambassadors, foreign representatives;
state and city dignitaries, glittering with gold lace.</p>

<p>The parquet and orchestra, floored over for
dancing, were lighted by varicolored globes strung
jewel-like from the vaulted ceiling. A rose-garlanded
dais encircling the immense stage made
a fit throne for half a hundred patched and powdered
<i>grandes dames</i> in the court-dress of Louis
XV and the Empire, and the simpler but no less
effective costume of the American Revolution.
A band, screened by palms whose fronds towered
up into the flies, preluded the ball with
old-time airs: "Les f&ecirc;tes d'Heb&eacute;;" "Armide;"
"La Chasse du jeune Henri."</p>

<!-- page 236 -->

<p>Madame Berthet's carriage had driven to the
stage entrance in Rue Toulouse. Preceded by
Jeanne, jeweled and scarfed for the minuet, and
by No&eacute;mie, scarfed and jeweled for the gavotte,
Madame Berthet climbed the tortuous stair which
gives access to that mysterious region known as
"behind the scenes."</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie paused on the threshold of the mirrored
greenroom to gaze with entranced eyes at
the bewildering panorama within.</p>

<p>"A leaf from 'Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript,' "
suggested Strang, at her elbow. "How
dare mere man, with but a band of blue silk
across his conventional shirt-front to mark him
as one of the Elect, venture into such a kaleidoscope
of loveliness? Methinks only an immortal
in the shining panoply of Heaven were
worthy."</p>

<p>"Mere man, in this case," replied No&eacute;mie, surveying
him gravely, "ought to be ashamed of
himself for declining the trouble of laced coat
and knee-breeches."</p>

<p>"That may not have been the reason&mdash;with
some of us shrunk-shanks," grimaced Donald;
"but you, <i>mademoiselle la jeunesse</i>,"&mdash;he bent

<!-- page 237 -->

gallantly over her hand,&mdash;"you are the most
golden letter on the aforesaid leaf."</p>

<p>She passed on, greeted with an admiring chorus
from the waiting dancers flashing excitedly about
the long room, laughing, babbling compliments,
practicing glide and curtsy, turning one another
about with shrill cries of astonished recognition.</p>

<p>"What has come over her?" mused Strang,
watching her from the doorway. "Has the
Changeling who has usurped the castle for so
long been withdrawn? and has the rightful
Princess been restored to her own?"</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie, as if answering his unspoken thought,
looked over at him and smiled. She stood against
one of those mildewed mirrors before which
generations of <i>danseuses</i> have bounded and
pirouetted, and <i>falcons</i> and <i>chanteuses l&eacute;g&egrave;res</i>
have settled jewel and plume before "going on."
She radiated gladness upon the group gathered
about her. At the back of her brain, beyond
the badinage and repartee of the moment, there
was music to which the heart danced. "<i>I am
free</i>," the strain went; "<i>I am no longer bound.
It is as if neither my grandmother nor myself
had taken an oath. And if she has ever had

<!-- page 238 -->

other reasons</i>"&mdash;here the melody was a trifle
jarred&mdash;"<i>for wishing me to marry him, she will
not wish it when she knows what I know</i>." So,
the strain swung once more with rhythm. "<i>And
if&mdash;if Maxime&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>The minuet-dancers had filed with slow and
graceful step, half an hour earlier, through the
wings, out upon the dancing-floor. The loud
bursts of applause, mingled with the measured
movement of the minuet from Mozart's "Don
Juan," had been drifting into the greenroom.
Now the flushed performers were stepping back
in rhythmic line; the gavotte was forming.</p>

<p>"One familiar with the history of our old
town," one of the brocaded grandes dames was
explaining to a foreign ambassador who stood
beside her in the greenroom, where her word
was law, watching with pleased eyes the animated
scene before them, "would find among the
two hundred young men and women, participants
in these dances, many names familiar to its
early records, social, military, and political; the
Delery, Grima, Castellanos, Viller&eacute;, Fortier, Beauregard,
Claiborne, de Laussan&mdash;Ah, pardon! I
am forgetting a duty!" She flitted away, casting

<!-- page 239 -->

anxious and nervous glances to right and
left.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie looked about her, also with questioning
eyes, aware for the first time that Jules Lestrappes,
her own partner, had not presented himself.</p>

<p>"Miss Carrington,"&mdash;the grande dame was
genuinely distressed,&mdash;"your dancing-partner,
Mr. Lestrappes, is unable to be present to-night.
He has been called away by the serious illness
of his father. I have not told you before, because&mdash;Ah,
here he comes!" she broke off,
relieved. "I was really afraid you had forgotten
your pledge, Major Grandchamps."</p>

<p>"Madame, a pledge to Beauty could never be
forgotten&mdash;by me." Major Grandchamps used
his courtliest tone, as he bent to brush her jeweled
fingers with his moustached lips.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie, at the sound of his voice, had started
eagerly forward; she shrank hastily back, to
stand with parted lips, alternately reddening and
paling; unable, after the first glance, to lift her
coward eyelids. Was it a dream? Could she
have imagined the tall, supple form making its
way in and out, through the slowly moving file
of the gavotte? Her uncle's quiet, highbred voice

<!-- page 240 -->

fell upon her agitated senses: "No&eacute;mie, my dear,
I bring the regrets of young Lestrappes, who, as
you doubtless know already, cannot be here this
evening. I also bring you a partner for the gavotte,
whom I trust you will find an agreeable
substitute. Miss Carrington, Captain Allard, of
the United States Army, my godson."</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie put out her hand mechanically; at
the firm, muscular grasp of the soldier's hand
uncertainty vanished. She raised her eyes confidently&mdash;to
drop them again before the ardent
questioning in his.</p>

<p>As in a dream, she took her place beside him, for
"La F&ecirc;te du Village" was sending its sprightly
call from the musician's bower, and stepped out
from the shelter of the wings into the full blaze
of light beyond. As in a dream, she made with
him the circuit of the immense dancing-floor;
pausing to bend low before the Grandes Dames
on the garlanded dais. The pretty dance, with its
staccato movement and rhythmic interludes, had
fairly begun before either of the pair found speech.</p>

<p>"You will forgive my awkwardness, Miss
Carrington," Allard said in the first pause. "I
learned something like the gavotte when I was

<!-- page 241 -->

a little chap,"&mdash;the exigencies of the dance
whirled them apart.&mdash;"Do you remember Brocard's
<i>Acad&eacute;mie de Danse</i>, where you and I and
Jeanne Berthet"&mdash;another momentary separation
cut his reminiscences short.</p>

<p>"When did you return from France?" No&eacute;mie
questioned.</p>

<p>"This morning, by way of New York. I have
not reported, yet, at the Barracks. I have been
practicing&mdash;gavotting&mdash;all day," he explained
from time to time, during the brief intervals of
waiting a turn. "With Jeanne&mdash;Madame Berthet
at the piano&mdash;l'oncle Grandchamps looking
on, jeering and encouraging&mdash;There! I
have made another blunder. Have I put you
out?&mdash;Sorry for old Lestrappes, <i>parole d'honneur</i>&mdash;But
I may be permitted to bless the Fates,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"A handsome pair that!" commented more
than one spectator; "how beautifully they take
the spirited step together!"</p>

<p>"As I live, No&eacute;mie Carrington and Maxime
Allard! Has the Southern Confederacy then
buried the hatchet? Or has Major Grandchamps
gone blind!"</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"What has become of the dark-browed Cortland,
I wonder."</p>

<p>"Yonder he is, looking down at her, impassive,
as usual. They say he has turned Catholic
for the bright eyes of No&eacute;mie. I hear he is three
times millionaire."</p>

<p>"Ah! If he has changed religion, it is more
likely that the de Laussan diamonds were the
awakening light."</p>

<p>"She has them on. See! And those wonderful
Destrehan pearls."</p>

<p>The gavotte had come to an end, upon a clear,
abrupt note. It was being enthusiastically encored.</p>

<p>"You are beautiful as a vision," whispered
Allard, catching the step now as if by instinct.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you saw many beautiful women in
Paris," remarked No&eacute;mie, smiling over her shoulder,
as she floated away, light as a bit of thistle-down.</p>

<p>"Not one. Did&mdash;did you miss me a little&mdash;No&eacute;mie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maxime," under cover of the renewed
clapping of hands.</p>

<p>He took leave of her at the entrance to the

<!-- page 243 -->

greenroom. "My leave expires at midnight," he
said; "and I have some reports to file. I am to
have an interview with Madame de Laussan to-morrow
at noon. May I&mdash;see you, after?"</p>

<p>Again the simple "yes" thrilled his ear.</p>

<p>It had not occurred to No&eacute;mie to ask how it
had come about that Major Grandchamps had
taken again into his favor the lately detested
wearer of the United States Army uniform, or by
what strange chance Allard had been practicing
the gavotte in l'oncle Grandchamps's own apartment,
with Jeanne Berthet for a teacher, and
Madame Berthet at the piano! It did not occur
to her, now, to wonder why Allard should be
pledged to an interview with Madame de Laussan
on the morrow. She was in that exalted state of
mind and heart when miracles are accepted without
question. The only thing that really mattered
was the fact of Allard's presence.</p>

<p>"To-morrow! at last, my No&eacute;mie!" said a
low voice in her ear, as she stood, later, in a
baignoire, looking at the brilliant scene. She
turned quickly to face Cortland. If he had felt
anger or jealousy at the sight of Allard, his
manner betrayed neither. He smiled, drawing

<!-- page 244 -->

her hand within his arm. It was the smile which
made the girl shudder without knowing why;
the smile that drew his lips away from his teeth,
when his eyelids were narrowed, and a greenish
light played between the heavy lashes.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow, at eleven o'clock," she said
quietly, withdrawing her hand from his arm. "I
wish to see you particularly. No, I shall not
dance any more to-night. We are going home
immediately. Good-night."</p>

<p>She was turning away. The band was playing
very softly "Pauv' petti Mam'selle Zi-Zi," the
ancient Creole chanson. A sudden pang of pity
moved her to hold out the hand which she had
taken from his arm. "Good-night," she repeated
gently. "Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-night. To-morrow!" he whispered,
openly triumphant.</p>

<hr/>

<p>XXV</p>

<p class="small">THE RECKONING</p>

</div>

<p>THE next morning, at the appointed hour,
Cortland found Miss Carrington in her own
boudoir; a small, daintily-furnished room separated
from the library by heavy porti&egrave;res only.
She arose to meet him as he entered. He could
see that she was trembling, though he could not
guess that it was from the terror of the interview
before her, or that the words which she had rehearsed
over and over again within herself seemed
fading from her mind, leaving there only blank
horror of himself.</p>

<p>Cortland mistook her emotion; he advanced
with arms extended, eyes gleaming, cheeks purple.
"No&eacute;mie! At last! Mine! Mine!"</p>

<p>She shrank back. "Do not touch me!" she commanded;
"how dare you look at me in that way!
In any way!" Her eyes blazed anger upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" he stammered,
genuinely astonished.</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>"What do I mean! Will you come with me a
moment?" She swept aside the curtains and led
the way into the library. "Would it not be well,
Mr. Cortland, for you to take your property?"</p>

<p>She flashed a contemptuous glance from his
amazed face to the sword beneath her mother's
portrait. "After the pains you took to get the
sword properly tricked out, rusted, buried, and
dug up again, it is surely of some value to you.
It is, as you may imagine, worthless to us."</p>

<p>He listened at first with an uncomprehending
frown, but before she had finished, his brow
cleared; he burst into a loud, relieved laugh. "So
that is what has provoked you, No&eacute;mie. I really
don't wonder much. How ever did you find me
out? Good joke, wasn't it! Even the wonderful
major was taken in. Gad, when I think of that
absurd old windbag, I am ready to split!" He
laughed again with retrospective enjoyment.</p>

<p>"It may be a good joke to you, Mr. Cortland,"
said No&eacute;mie, half-bewildered and wholly angered
by his careless acceptance of the charge; "but
it does not appeal to me. Neither, I think, will
it appeal to my uncle and my grandmother."</p>

<p>He stared at her, incredulous.</p>

<!-- page 247 -->

<p>"I have only to add"&mdash;she drew herself up
haughtily&mdash;"that everything&mdash;everything is
at an end between us."</p>

<p>"You do not mean it," he said dully; "you
cannot mean it."</p>

<p>"I do mean it!"</p>

<p>"By God!" he broke in roughly. "You think
you can play fast and loose with me, Miss No&eacute;mie
Carrington! Very well, I will show you
whether you can or not. Our engagement will be
announced this day, according to your promise,
or I will know the reason why. The engagement,
and the date of the wedding." Again the coarsened
voice, the hardening of the handsome face
into brutality.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the reason why now," returned
No&eacute;mie coolly. "The reason is that I do not love
you. I have never loved you. I would rather
die than become your wife. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he laughed viciously; "quite clear,
quite convincing. And&mdash;the reason for your
reason, Miss de Laussan Carrington, is not far to
seek. It was present in the person of Captain
Maxime Allard last night at the ball. Am I correct?"</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>"Yes. You are correct," said No&eacute;mie boldly;
"since you insist upon knowing, quite correct."</p>

<p>This confession destroyed the last remnant of
the man's self-control. He crossed over to where
she stood and thrust his face into hers. "Allard,
Maxime Allard," he sneered, "the acknowledged
lover of a common dancing-girl. The coward
who ran off to Europe rather than face the scandal
following such a connection!"</p>

<p>"It is false!" interrupted No&eacute;mie hotly. "It
was you&mdash;you who started that falsehood. I
know it now, though not from him. Besides, I
would not believe you against him though you
swore a thousand oaths."</p>

<p>"You love him, then," said Cortland, with
sudden and unexpected calm.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love him!" cried the girl, carried out
of herself by the derision in his eyes and on his
lips. "I love him so well, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died in her throat. Cortland had
caught her wrist in his powerful grasp.</p>

<p>"You! <i>You!</i> And do you think that by
throwing me over you can get Maxime Allard,
Captain Maxime Allard, for a husband? Well, I
tell you, you are mistaken, my fine Mademoiselle

<!-- page 249 -->

de Laussan Carrington. I suppose that you think
that you know who you are?"</p>

<p>Struggling in his hold, she lifted her head
proudly and opened her lips.</p>

<p>"You think," he went on, in a low, concentrated
voice, "that you belong to the blue blood
of the aristocracy, hey? Don't you? Well,
maybe you've got the blue blood in you. But it
hasn't washed out the black blood. It never can."</p>

<p>"Let me go, sir," cried No&eacute;mie, terrified.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Aha, it's your turn to want to know what <i>I</i>
mean! I mean that you may trace your descent
from all the de Laussans, and all the Destrehans,
and all the Carringtons, you can scrape together,
but all the same, you are bound to trace it also
from Louis Jasmin (afterward Verac), free man of
color, and Rosine Rabut, his wife, a negro slave.
Ha! Ha! How do you like that, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>He released her wrist so suddenly that she
staggered back and would have fallen but for
an armchair upon which she leaned, wide-eyed
and panting.</p>

<p>"It is false, false," she whispered; "false as
you are."</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>"Not so fast, my lady,"&mdash;he relapsed into a
cool, off-hand, conversational tone. "You can
ask Madame de Laussan. She knows. So does
that yellow devil, Sir&egrave;ne. Perhaps others. So
will Maxime Allard, for I mean to find him at
once and tell him. A pretty show you'll make
with any white man, when the truth comes out."</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie had lost the power of speech. She
continued to look at him, horror growing in her
strained eyes, her lips pinching, her face drawn
and ghastly white.</p>

<p>Cortland's eyes gloated over her misery. "How
do I know this?" he continued, as if she had
spoken. "I am going to tell you how I know
it."</p>

<p>Facing her, where one year before he had
faced Madame de Laussan, he told the story as
he had told it then, dwelling on his father's part
therein with savage prolixity; describing the
stolen casket and its contents; quoting Gabrielle
Verac's letter with unctuous deliberation, rehearsing
his first and later interviews with Madame
de Laussan, lingering with shameless gratification
on the uses to which he had put the money
extorted from the terror-stricken woman.</p>

<!-- page 251 -->

<p>"Many a bunch of American Beauties you got
out of that first payment," he laughed, in conclusion.
"Now that you know the truth, you will
doubtless realize that, so far from Miss Carrington's
stooping to mix her blue blood with that
of a poor white, the poor white was going down
into the mud to pick up a&mdash;nigger!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" The smothered shriek was like the
death cry of a wounded animal. It sobered
Cortland's insane rage.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," he hastened to say in a
more temperate voice. "I do love you, No&eacute;mie.
I swear I do. I was driven into telling you the
truth by your treatment of me. I never meant
you to know. Come. I'll marry you to-morrow,
and no one else shall ever know."</p>

<p>"Go." She stood up, tall and straight, fire
flaming her eyes, her mouth set and determined.
"Leave the house this instant, or I will have you
put out of it."</p>

<p>"Very well," he mocked, turning on his heel.
"Exit Cortland, with a certain letter in his pocket
which will make fine reading for a certain captain
in the United States Army."</p>

<p>"Go!" she repeated imperiously. "Do whatever

<!-- page 252 -->

you like, only rid this house of your presence."</p>

<p>He walked jauntily to the door, as he had done
on former occasions. But once outside, he paused
as before to wipe the perspiration from his forehead.
"D&mdash;n fool you've made of yourself
again, Sid Cortland," he muttered; "why must
I show my cards whenever I get into that confounded
library? Gad, but the little Spitfire was
pretty as a picture! Blaze away, my beauty, if it
does you any good. You'll sing another tune
after you have seen that precious grandmother
of yours! Eh, what?"</p>

<p>A man-servant had approached, unheard, and
was standing in a respectful attitude before him.
"Madame de Laussan," he repeated, "begs monsieur
to come for a moment to her sitting-room
before leaving."</p>

<p>Cortland followed him up the stair, a fatuous
smile dawning into his face. "I can manage
Grandmamma fast enough," he boasted to himself;
"and Grandmamma must manage Spitfire,
or it will go hard with 'em both. Sidney, my
boy, the game is yours."</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan was half reclining in a

<!-- page 253 -->

chaise-lounge drawn up by an open fire. She was
carefully dressed, and there was something in
her appearance which arrested Cortland on the
threshold. She seemed by some miracle to have
regained, if not her physical, at least her spiritual
strength; her dark eyes looked out from their
deep sockets with their old-time brilliancy; her
wasted cheeks had taken on a tinge of color.
She was not alone; Sir&egrave;ne, as usual, was stationed
at her elbow; Major Grandchamps sat, well-groomed,
elegant, in correct morning costume,
beside her; Captain Allard stood on the opposite
side of the fireplace, leaning against the mantel.</p>

<p>Cortland flushed a little upon perceiving the
two men, but returned their formal greeting with
a careless nod. He approached Madame de
Laussan with an insinuating, deferential smile,
but Major Grandchamps, who had arisen, lifted a
detaining hand. "One moment, if you please,
Mr. Cortland."</p>

<p>"I believe," said Cortland quietly, "that
Madame de Laussan has done me the honor to
send for me."</p>

<p>"She has," returned Major Grandchamps. "It
is for her, and in her name that I speak when I

<!-- page 254 -->

desire you to listen to the reading of a letter,
whose contents, however, are already familiar to
you. Maxime&mdash;"</p>

<p>Allard made a step or two forward, and placed
in the hand of the older man a yellowed document
with crumbled seal. Major Grandchamps unfolded
it with deliberation. "This letter&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Cortland, taken aback; but,
his effrontery returning, "So!" he sneered, "the
stolen letter! Captain Maxime Allard, then, was
the thief!"</p>

<p>"A hard term, Mr. Cortland," smiled Allard;
"though I confess I should not have hesitated
to take the letter by force or by strategy, had it
been necessary. As it was, I merely picked it up
from the sidewalk, where you left it lying, on a
certain night not over-long ago, after having
verified in yourself the adage <i>in vino veritas</i>.
Possibly you may remember?"</p>

<p>Cortland's ready tongue for once failed him;
he remained sullenly silent. Major Grandchamps
turned to his kinswoman. "You will pardon me,
my dear Laure," he said, "if once more I awaken
unhappy memories by reading the letter of Madame
Armand de Laussan? It is necessary."</p>

<!-- page 255 -->

<p>He read the letter written by Gabrielle Verac
on the eve of her flight slowly and carefully to
the end, then, striking a match, he held the thin
pages over the flame and watched them shrivel
and curl into a bluish ash, which hovered for a
moment in the air and floated slowly to the floor.</p>

<p>Cortland's eyes followed the zigzag fall. "It is
easy enough to destroy a stolen letter&mdash;a twice-stolen
letter, if you will!"&mdash;he bowed in mock
deference,&mdash;"but even Major Grandchamps has
not the power to destroy facts."</p>

<p>"For example?"</p>

<p>"For example, the fact that Louis Jasmin, the
father of Madame Armand de Laussan&mdash;you
will observe, gentlemen, that I have the family
history at my finger-ends&mdash;was a free man of
color, as they said in his day; and that Rosine
Rabut, her mother, was not only a negress, but
an ex-slave."</p>

<p>"We have no intention, Mr. Cortland," said
the major, with suave courtesy, "of denying any
fact or facts in the case. You have stated, with
absolute accuracy, the condition of Louis Jasmin&mdash;afterward
Verac&mdash;and of Rosine Rabut, his
wife."</p>

<!-- page 256 -->

<p>"Ah! then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. But a fact of which you
perhaps are unaware is that Madame Armand de
Laussan was the <i>adopted</i> daughter only of Louis
Jasmin, afterward Verac, and of his wife, Rosine
Rabut."</p>

<p>Cortland laughed incredulously. "A very pretty
story, major," he said; "a romantic story, indeed."</p>

<p>"You will retract the insinuation which your
words and your tones hint at, sir, or you will
fight," cried the major, on fire at once.</p>

<p>"I think," interposed Allard quietly, "that
Mr. Cortland will gladly retract the implied insult
when he has examined these attested papers,
which I myself obtained in France, and whose
genuineness he will do well not to question."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge myself convinced, gentlemen,"
said Cortland, after a close scrutiny of the
papers thrust in his hand. He tossed them upon
the table. "And now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now," roared Major Grandchamps, exasperated
to the last degree by the man's insolent
coolness, "and now, I am quite aware, sir, that
you would not scruple to break any promise you

<!-- page 257 -->

might make. Therefore I exact none. But I
warn you that if you ever dare whisper a syllable
of the&mdash;the atrocious misunderstanding which
has hung over this house for so long, I will hunt
you to the ends of the earth to kill you! As for
the money you so shamelessly wrung from my
cousin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"L&eacute;on!" breathed Madame de Laussan.</p>

<p>"Keep it, and be hanged to you, sir! But,
again I warn you! neither the name of my
cousin, Madame de Laussan, nor that of my ward&mdash;"
Choked with passion, the old man finished
the sentence with a threatening glare.</p>

<p>Cortland had remained looking at him as if he
had heard nothing. He turned with a not ungraceful
inclination of the head to Madame de
Laussan.</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, madame," he said, "I
will take my leave. I am called to San Francisco&mdash;on
business, and shall take the earliest train
possible out of this city, which, by the way,
madame, for certain reasons, is forever blotted&mdash;with
all its people and things&mdash;out of existence
for me. I fear I may not have the pleasure of
seeing you again; will you have the goodness to

<!-- page 258 -->

convey my farewell&mdash;and my congratulations&mdash;to
Mademoiselle No&eacute;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The opening phrases of this allocution rang
hollow and insincere, sounding like a stilted imitation
of some stage speech, but in the last words
his voice broke; that best which is in every
man appeared for a brief second and looked
out of his eyes; he turned away leaving the
name unsaid.</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps found himself suddenly
and inexplicably moved; he followed his fallen
foe to the door. "Mr. Cortland," he said in a
low voice, "I understand that you are for the
moment financially embarrassed. Will you allow
me to offer you a check?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you and your money!" snarled
Cortland. He walked away without a backward
glance.</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" said Allard thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Madame de Laussan's eyes were closed, her lips
moved in an unspoken prayer of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the room. Sir&egrave;ne, unobserved,
drew from her sleeve an unsheathed
poniard and slipped it into her stocking. "The
<i>gri-gri</i> has worked without it," she muttered.

<!-- page 259 -->

"All the same, his bones will rot, and his marrow
will burn, and he will twist in his bed in the
midnight and pray to die."</p>

<p>She exchanged a long look with her mistress,
whose eyes, unclosed, plunged themselves into
hers.</p>

<p>"Poor Gabrielle! Gabrielle la belle! Gabrielle
la malheureuse!" The words exhaled like a sigh
from Major Grandchamps's unconscious lips; his
old eyes were moist.</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie! she need never know of this terrible
shadow which seemed to menace her life?"
said Allard.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Never!" cried Major Grandchamps
and Madame de Laussan in a breath.</p>

<p>"I wish it had not been he who found the
sword," said the latter. "However, one must not
ask for the earth, I suppose, L&eacute;on." She stood up,
smoothing down her laces after her old fashion.
"You and Maxime will come to-night to dinner,
also Jeanne Berthet and her mother, and F&eacute;lix,
the scamp! And Monsieur Paturin, who will
scold, of course, when he is told about that wasted
seven thousand and odd dollars! And Frances
Heron. And Tom Masters, of course, and Donald

<!-- page 260 -->

Strang. Please see that they are all
asked. Sir&egrave;ne, you will go at once and say to
Mademoiselle No&eacute;mie that Captain Allard is
awaiting her in her boudoir. Now I shall go
to sleep until you and No&eacute;mie come to ask my
blessing, Allard, my boy. For all is well at last,
<i>n'est-ce pas</i>, L&eacute;on?"</p>

<hr/>

<p>THE note which Sir&egrave;ne handed to Major
Grandchamps, waiting below with Allard,
was sealed and addressed to Madame de Laussan.</p>

<p>"She is not in her room, Mam'selle No&eacute;mie,"
whispered Sir&egrave;ne, with ashen lips; "I think she
has gone away, I do not know why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps made no scruple about
tearing open the note; his hand shook as he read
it aloud.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear grandmother," it ran; "<i>he</i> has
told me the terrible, terrible truth. How you
have suffered for me&mdash;and for my mother! It
will be harder yet for you <i>when every one
knows;</i> for <i>he</i> has said that every one shall know
at once. It will be far better for you, <i>ma m&egrave;re</i>,
and perhaps for me, if I go away. I am going
away. But have no fear for me, dear mother; I
will know how to be brave&mdash;have you not taught

<!-- page 262 -->

me yourself how to be brave? I love you so! I
love you so! Only I cannot&mdash;" Here a whole
line had been carefully erased, and the note ended
abruptly. "Your b&eacute;b&eacute;, No&eacute;mie."</p>

<p>"He has told her, the scoundrel!" shouted
Major Grandchamps. "He has told her, the
black-hearted villain! I will kill him; he shall
not leave this town alive. My poor little No&eacute;mie!
Oh, I will kill him!"</p>

<p>Allard laid a calming hand on his arm; his
own face was white and stern. "Let him wait,
the hound! "he said; "we must find her first&mdash;<i>No&eacute;mie!</i>
God! what may not have happened
already!"</p>

<p>"It is not that, 'Sieur Maxime, not that!"
Sir&egrave;ne saw his agitated glance in the direction of
the river, and divined his thought. "She would
never leave us in <i>that</i> way, my b&eacute;b&eacute;. She would
never give a sorrow <i>like that</i> to the Little Mistress."</p>

<p>"Then where&mdash;" began Allard.</p>

<p>"To the Convent of the Ursulines. I am sure
of it. It was there that Mam'selle No&eacute;mie was at
school, and Mam'selle Mathilde, her mother."</p>

<p>Relief was expressed in the features of both men.</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>"You are right, quite right, Sir&egrave;ne. You
will say not a word to your mistress&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Tite Ma&icirc;tresse has not slept for many nights.
She will sleep like an angel all the afternoon,"
interrupted the mulattress confidently.</p>

<p>"Very well. See to it that not a breath of all
this reaches any one in the house," said Major
Grandchamps; "we will drive down to the Ursulines
at once, Maxime. I will call a carriage.
Meantime do you write or telephone those dinner
invitations. Not a word; it must be done. For,
of course, No&eacute;mie will be here long before the
hour. I will be back immediately. It is now one
o'clock,"&mdash;he consulted his watch,&mdash;"by three,
at the latest, we shall be here again."</p>

<p>But No&eacute;mie had not gone to the convent of
the Ursulines. The return drive seemed interminable
to both men.</p>

<p>"You wished to speak yesterday, Maxime,"
said the old major from time to time, forgetting
that he had said the same thing before; "and I
urged you to wait."</p>

<p>"Do not reproach yourself, dear friend," Allard
would reply; "I am equally to blame. Was
it not I, even more than yourself, who planned to

<!-- page 264 -->

surprise her with an unexpected partner for the
gavotte? Besides, we are uselessly anxious. She
will have gone back home long ago. The dove
will return to its nest."</p>

<p>"She may have gone into the cathedral," Allard
suggested later. The carriage was rolling
swiftly up Royal Street; he called to the coachman
to stop, and, descending, hurried with beating
heart into the darkening church. There were
several kneeling figures about the aisles and before
the altars, but No&eacute;mie was not among them.
His foot was on the step of the carriage again,
when a small, familiar figure, hunched up on the
opposite banquette, caught his eye. He crossed
the street. "What are you doing here, Old
Babe?" he demanded, looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Nuttin' 'tall, Mars Max-<i>eem</i>," Old Babe replied
stolidly; "thes a-watchin' dem angels in
de winder yander. I ain' up to no mis-cheef, fo'
Gawd, I ain'."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" repeated Allard
sternly.</p>

<p>"Yas, Marse Max-eem, I ain' gwine tell no
lies." She stood up, stretching her skinny arms
above her head. "I'ze all crump-up. Lawd, I

<!-- page 265 -->

been squattin' heah 'bout ten hours. Yas, Marse
Max-<i>eem</i>, I gwine tell you." She looked about
apprehensively, then tiptoed, laying a black paw
on his wrist, and whispered, "<i>She's</i> eroun' yander,
in de nigger convent."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Allard, frowning.</p>

<p>"Miss No-<i>mee</i>."</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried the young man, falling
back in amazement. Seizing the child's shoulder,
he ran her across the street, thrust her bodily
into the carriage, and sprang in after her. "Now
then, Old Babe," he said, quivering with impatience,
but striving to speak calmly, "tell the
major here, and me, what you know about Miss
No&eacute;mie."</p>

<p>The major had hardly the time to look puzzled.
Old Babe screwed up her face and peered doubtfully
into one confronting face, then the other.</p>

<p>"You ain' gwine ter let daddy lick me, is yer?
Well, den, I wuz thes quoiled-up&mdash;lak I wuz when
I seed dat piz'n white man onwrop dat swode;
you know, Marse Max-<i>eem?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Old Babe," said Allard, without
the least idea of what she meant. "But Miss
No&eacute;mie? Go on, go <i>on</i>."</p>

<!-- page 266 -->

<p>"Yas-sir. I wuz thes quoiled up dis mawnin'
in de libary, hine de sofy, lak I wuz dat time I
seed dat piz'n white man onwrop dat swode&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you don't tell me what you know about
Miss No&eacute;mie, Old Babe, I'll break every bone in
your good-for-nothing body!" interjected Major
Grandchamps.</p>

<p>"Yas, ole marse. I gwine ter tell you. I wuz
thes quoiled up&mdash;"</p>

<p>It took Old Babe some time to tell her story,
there being no possibility of hurrying her, though
her frightened eyes rolled wildly at the major's
dire threats. Stripped of superfluities, the thread
of it was clear and dramatic.</p>

<p>Coiled up behind the sofa in the library (for
what purpose Old Babe did not vouchsafe to say),
she had been an eye- and ear-witness of Cortland's
interview with No&eacute;mie Carrington. She brought
the scene so vividly before the eyes of her listeners
that when she came to the point where
Cortland had caught the girl's wrist, "an' shak
her, fo' Gawd, he shuk her!" inarticulate cries
of rage filled the carriage.</p>

<p>"An' dat low-down piz'n Mist' Cotelan' had
de in<i>su</i>'ance to tell Miss No-<i>mee</i> dat <i>she</i> wuz a

<!-- page 267 -->

<i>nigger</i>," continued Old Babe. "He skeered her
ontwel seem-lak she gwine ter drap down dead.
But Gawd-a'mighty, first thing you knows she
riz up high ez de roof, an' tole dat piz'n-mouf
liar ter cl'ar out. An' he thes sneak out lak a
puppy wid his tail a-tween his laigs."</p>

<p>Old Babe had crept up the stair after her young
mistress, "quoiling" behind a table in the upper
hall, and when No&eacute;mie reappeared, veiled, and
shrouded in a long cloak, she had followed her
stealthily out of the house and along the streets,
until the door of the Convent of the Holy Family
in Rue d'Orleans had opened to receive the fugitive.
"I thes been settin' yander a-waitin'," concluded
Old Babe; "caze I dunno what devil<i>ment</i>
dem fool nigger-women inside dat do' mought
do to Miss No-<i>mee</i>. Dey mought tek it inter dey
fool heads dat she <i>wuz</i>&mdash;what Mist' Cotelan' call
her&mdash;an' dey mought <i>mek her work</i>. I wan't
gwine to go home ontwel I knowed how dem
niggers wuz treatin' Miss No-<i>mee</i>. You ain'
gwine ter scold Miss No-<i>mee</i> fer runnin' away, is
you, ole marse?" she queried anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Old Babe," groaned Allard, for
the old major was incapable of speech. "We are

<!-- page 268 -->

going to take Miss No&eacute;mie home. That's all.
You are a good girl, Old Babe," he added, as
No&eacute;mie had done.</p>

<p>"Miss No-<i>mee</i> ain' no&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Hush!" cried Allard.</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps and the officer walked
along Rue d' Orleans, leaving Old Babe to peer
wistfully from the carriage-window, and stopped
before the closed door of the Convent of the
Holy Family.</p>

<p>This rambling, two-storied, red-stuccoed building,
surmounted to-day by a cross, has a history
all its own. During the first half of the nineteenth
century it was the ballroom of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
de l'Op&eacute;ra, which stood on the corner of Rue
Bourbon and Rue d'Orl&eacute;ans. Along the tesselated
marble of its entrance hall, and up and down the
graceful stair, passed the elegant figures&mdash;men
and women of the <i>haute soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>&mdash;of the <i>ancien
r&eacute;gime</i>; light feet, long since stilled, skimmed
the polished floors; the gay murmur of voices,
long ceased, mingled with the strains of forgotten
melodies that beat the perfumed air. Later, when
the old theatre was laid in ashes, and the opera
had passed to its stately home in Rue Bourbon,

<!-- page 269 -->

the place became the scene of those orgies known
as the <i>cordon-bleu</i> balls, where soft-eyed quadroon
and octoroon women smiled with seductive
sweetness upon high-born gallants,&mdash;smiles often
as dangerous as seductive, which lighted the
pathway through a dewy dawn to that old dueling-ground
below the city, or the shorter route
to the briar-grown square behind the Cathedral
St. Louis, where pistols spoke, or cold steel
flashed a finale to the dancing! To-day the
building shelters the colored nuns of the Holy
Family, the only order of colored nuns in the
United States; an imposing chapel occupies the
corner where the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l'Op&eacute;ra Fran&ccedil;ais
once stood. White-veiled novices and black-veiled
sisters, running the gamut of color from coal-black
to soft, cloud-like white, glide noiselessly
about the old corridors and the old ballroom;
peace broods where passion once ran riot; prayers,
rising like a fountain, night and day, sweep
the air clean of the graceful badinage of the
<i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, and send atonement aloft for the
ribald jest and the voluptuous innuendo of the
nights of the <i>cordon-bleu</i>.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie Carrington, on her knees in the quiet

<!-- page 270 -->

chapel, had ceased to pray; body and soul were
alike benumbed; the strained nerves had reached
that point beyond which response to emotion is
no longer possible.</p>

<p>For hours, since stumbling blindly up the
aisle to fall prone before the altar, she had
wandered through a chaos strewn with the crumbling
remains of all that had made up life for her,
her lips mechanically framing prayers for mercy,
for help, for strength; her heart bursting with
anguish, with the exaggerated fancy of youth,
she lived through coming eternities of shame
and mortification. She saw herself, writhing like
one torn limb from limb, branded as a thief,
pilloried as an impostor. She heard her name
whispered, pityingly perhaps, in drawing-rooms,
shrieked by newsboys about the streets, bandied
from tongue to tongue through shop and market-place.
Again and again she had beaten back
the temptation of the river. "I will not, for my
grandmother's sake; she has suffered enough.
Oh, I will not!" With equal strength she had
thrust away the thought of Maxime Allard. "By
now, <i>he knows</i>." She had allowed herself but
this one pathetic whisper, and turned away as

<!-- page 271 -->

a drowning man might withhold his hand from
a spar within his reach. But the storm had at
last spent itself. She continued to kneel, rigid,
motionless, staring, with eyes that saw nothing,
at the White Virgin, who seemed to float in the
dusky air above her head.</p>

<p>A hand fell softly upon her shoulder. "Come,
my child," the Reverend Mother said, assisting
her to her feet, and guiding her gently through
the chapel and out upon the railed gallery in the
rear. The girl's cramped limbs hardly sustained
her weight; she leaned like a helpless child
against the strong, supporting arm. "Poor little
one!" The kindly black face smiled down into
hers; she responded with a dazed uplift of heavy
eyes.</p>

<p>From the prim garden below, lying in the
mellow glow of the setting sun, arose the rich
perfume of honeysuckle and sweet-olive; the
Spanish Daggers lifted their unseasonable cones
of white bells; an orange tree in a big tub had
adventured an out-of-time blossoming which
showed between the thick, clustering, green leaves.
In the court the orphans and the half-orphans
cared for by the Holy Family were at play. Their

<!-- page 272 -->

plaintive voices bent in a <i>danse ronde</i> came floating
up:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small"><i>Ainsi font, font, font,<br/>

Les petites marionettes</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"They are&mdash;singing&mdash;down there," No&eacute;mie
said wonderingly. How indeed could any one have
the heart to sing? She laid her hand on the rail;
a little black spider scuttled across it and swung
himself on a filmy rope down toward the garden.</p>

<p>"Yes. They sing, <i>mon enfant</i>, because they
are happy," said the Mother.</p>

<p>"I shall never sing again," thought No&eacute;mie.</p>

<p>Madame M&egrave;re placed her in a chair near an
open window of the shadow-filled reception room,
and, dislodging from the piano stool a small,
chocolate-colored half-orphan, who was dolorously
pounding the yellowed keys, she retired,
shoving the giggling musician before her.</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie closed her eyes and leaned her head
upon the window sill. "Now," she thought confusedly,
"they will bring me a white veil, perhaps,
and put it on my head. And I will be one of
them&mdash;I am one of them! By birth, I am <i>one
of them!</i>"</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie!" She sprang to her feet with a

<!-- page 273 -->

hoarse cry. At sight of Allard, standing in front
of her, she shrank back, warding him away with
pleading, outstretched hands. "Oh, why have
you come!" she moaned.</p>

<p>"I have come, No&eacute;mie,"&mdash;Allard caught her
ice-cold hands in his and held them fast,&mdash;"I
come because I love you; I come to take you
home, No&eacute;mie, <i>ma bien aim&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;he has not told? You&mdash;you do
not know,"&mdash;she wrenched her hands from his
grasp,&mdash;"you have not heard that I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie!" he cried sternly, "do not say it.
I forbid you. It is not true."</p>

<p>"&mdash;colored," she gasped, sinking, half-fainting,
in her chair. "Do not touch me,"&mdash;she
started again to her feet, her voice rising to a
shriek,&mdash;"do you not hear? <i>I am colored!</i>"</p>

<p>"No&eacute;mie,"&mdash;Major Grandchamps advanced
from the shadow where he had been standing,&mdash;"listen,
my child. It is all a mistake. A cruel,
cruel mistake. Maxime will tell you."</p>

<p>His words fell upon such bewildered senses
that Maxime had to repeat several times the story
of Gabrielle Dupont's birth and adoption before
the poor child could comprehend its meaning, or

<!-- page 274 -->

its relation to herself. "So you see, my beloved,"
he said at last, "that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am white?" she interrupted, her large,
imploring eyes fixed upon his. "I am really&mdash;<i>white?
All white?</i>"</p>

<p>"White as the whitest angel in heaven," he
reiterated, stroking her hand tenderly.</p>

<p>The tears welled from her eyes, and rolled
unchecked down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thank God for my dear grandmother,"
she sobbed.</p>

<p>"My No&eacute;mie," breathed Allard.</p>

<p>"And for you, Maxime."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Carrington," said Major Grandchamps,
after a silence, "there is one thing which
I have forgotten to tell you, and that is, that
Captain Maxime Allard of the United States
Army, the son of my old comrade, Colonel Fernand
Allard, did my family the honor to ask
for the hand of my ward, Mademoiselle de Laussan
Carrington, <i>before</i> he went to France, and
while still under the impression that Madame
Armand de Laussan was, or might prove to be,
the daughter of Louis Jasmin."</p>

<p>"Before&mdash;?"</p>

<!-- page 275 -->

<p>"Before he knew the truth about you, No&eacute;mie,
my cherished."</p>

<p>"<i>Maxime!</i>" The pride and joy winging the
cry upward made it almost heart-breaking.</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps turned away, wiping his
dimmed eyes. No&eacute;mie had leaped to Maxime's
breast; his arms were about her; his wet cheek
caressed hers.</p>

<br/>

<p>"She is simply wonderful!" remarked Strang,
surveying Madame de Laussan from his end of
the table that night. And truly no epithet short
of this could fitly describe the silver-haired hostess
presiding over the betrothal dinner of No&eacute;mie
Carrington and Maxime Allard. The very
memory of the long and anguished months, which
had appeared to suck the vitality slowly, cruelly,
from the slender frame, and to exhaust the
strength of that indomitable spirit, was wiped out
as if by magic, leaving the grande dame more
grande dame than ever. She wore the de Laussan
tiara in her hair; the rare laces which
adorned her trailing velvet robe sparkled with
rarer, long-unseen jewels, drawn from the inexhaustible
treasures of the de Laussan vault;

<!-- page 276 -->

even these, Colonel Fernand Allard (late of the
Confederate States Army) remarked, with old-fashioned
gallantry, were lustreless beside the
dewy shining of her beautiful dark eyes. "She
is a reincarnation of those fabled women of old,
whose charm (declare the ancient chronicles)
<i>dothe but increase with ye passinge of ye
yeares</i>," added Strang. "May she live forever!"</p>

<p>And this present chronicler desires to echo
the wish. May she live forever! For never was
anything, surely, so gracious-womanly as this
"Old Moon wi' the Young Moon (No&eacute;mie's first-born)
in her arme!"</p>

<p>The dinner had progressed joyously.</p>

<p>"As like Miss Carrington's d&eacute;but dinner of a
year ago as one of these roses is to another," Masters
observed to Jeanne Berthet, sitting beside
him; "minus the Intruder" (meaning Cortland).
"The fellow has gone, by the way. I saw him
board the west-bound train an hour ago, scowling
impressively as usual."</p>

<p>"Gone! The Finder of the Sword!" mocked
Frances Heron. "Did he take the sword with
him, a sort of consolation prize, seeing that the
real guerdon has fallen, somehow, to another?"</p>

<!-- page 277 -->

<p>"Mr. Cortland has turned out to be <i>not</i> the
Finder of the Sword," Jeanne announced, with
an air of importance; "we&mdash;the family&mdash;have
just been informed."</p>

<p>And whisperingly, cautiously, the curious episode
of the false sword went around the table; for
Major Grandchamps was deeply mortified at his
own failure to detect the imposition. "He has
torn that false sword down with his own hands,
my grandpapa, and trampled upon it," breathed
Jeanne; "and <i>ciel!</i> how he has cursed <i>l'anglais!</i>"</p>

<p>No&eacute;mie, radiant in white gown and betrothal
roses, showed no more than Madame de Laussan
a trace of past wretchedness. Allard, wearing
the uniform of the United States Army,&mdash;at the
request of l'oncle Grandchamps,&mdash;looked, F&eacute;lix
Monplaisir complained, unbearably, exasperatingly,
abominably handsome and happy. The
pair had been duly toasted and congratulated;
the excitement following the announcement of
the <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i> had a little subsided, and Major
Grandchamps was booted and spurred, and off
into <i>le temps</i>, followed at close range by Colonel
Allard and Monsieur Paturin. "<i>Dans le temps</i>,"
continued the major, amid a respectful silence.

<!-- page 278 -->

"Eh? What is it, Joseph?" The butler, leaning
to his ear, repeated something softly.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!"&mdash;the major rose precipitately,&mdash;"I
thought I smelled smoke. Do not
agitate yourself, Laure, <i>ma ch&egrave;re;</i> it is nothing.
There seems to be fire about the house somewhere,"
he added in a low tone to Allard; "in
the tower room, did you say, Joseph?"</p>

<p>He went out, followed pell-mell by the others.
Even Madame Berthet panted after the lighter-footed
young women, who trooped behind the
men up the narrow stair known as the tower-stair.
Madame de Laussan came last, leaning on
Sir&egrave;ne's arm.</p>

<p>The tower, or turret-chamber, and the hall conducting
to it, were filled with smoke; the candelabra,
snatched by Joseph from the dinner table,
and the lamp carried by Uncle Mink, illuminated
the haze and touched into glitter here
and there the brass claws of a table foot, or the
crystal-drops of a sconce; armoires and chairs
loomed large in the shifting light, for the turret-chamber
had long been dedicated to that sort
of outworn and dilapidated furniture known as
plunder; a discolored map or two hanging against

<!-- page 279 -->

the boarded walls, and two or three dusty desks,
seemed to suggest an ancient schoolroom; such,
in fact, in the time of Pierre de Laussan, it had
been.</p>

<p>" 'Tain't nuttin', Marse L&eacute;on," declared Mink,
with disgusted conviction. "I done tole Joseph
'twan't nuttin' but a rumpus in dat secon'-han'
sto' down yander on de side street. Som'p'n
always a-burnin' in dat sto'. <i>Hmp!</i>"</p>

<p>"He is right, major," said Allard, from the
window. He had thrown up the sash and had
been peering out. "The smoke comes from the
side street; it is already blowing away." He
drew down the window; the sash struck the sill
with a heavy thump which sent a cloud of dust
upward; at the same time a rusty nail fell noisily
to the floor at his feet. One board of the wainscoting
under the sill, loosened, swung slowly
downward.</p>

<p>"The dust of ages!" laughed Allard, stooping
to flap his trousers with his handkerchief. Suddenly
he arrested his hand and stooped lower. A
moment later he had drawn from the shallow slip
in the boarded wall, dust-covered, cobwebbed,
time-stained, the sword hidden there by Pierre de

<!-- page 280 -->

Laussan the day he passed out of his home forever.
A bit of paper, torn evidently from a memorandum-book,
was tied into the fringe of the
faded crimson silk sash&mdash;the sash which l'oncle
Grandchamps had neglected to reproduce in his
drawing, and which Cortland, therefore, had not
included in his order for a "real antique!"</p>

<p>Major Grandchamps detached the mildewed
scrap and handed it to Pierre de Laussan's mother.</p>

<p>"Vive la patrie! &Agrave; revoir, ma m&egrave;re ch&eacute;rie.
Ton Pierre," said the young soldier, from out of
that wonderful Past.</p>

<p>"My boy! my little Pierre!" murmured Madame
de Laussan, pressing the paper to her
bosom.</p>

<p>"The Lafayette Sword!" said Major Grandchamps,
unsheathing the blade, and describing a
circle in the air with the flexible steel. "This
time there is no room for doubt."</p>

<p>"None whatever!" said Donald Strang in a
steady voice, looking from Allard's triumphant
face to No&eacute;mie's&mdash;flushed, happy, adoring&mdash;beside
it.</p>
