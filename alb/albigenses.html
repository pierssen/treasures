<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THE present work is a part of a series, and is
the first of three historical romances, illustrative
of European feelings and manners in ancient
times, in middle, and in modern.</p>

<p>Such a series might show the diversities
of national and human character, in the chief
points of view essential even to graver knowledge.
The splendid barbarism of the feudal
ages, with their wild superstitions and dubious
Christianity, their knightly gallantry and baronial
oppression, the native fierceness of the Gothic
conqueror, mingled with the levity, bigotry, and
baseness of his Italian and Gallic slave, offer
powerful materials to the painter of manners with
the pen.</p>

<p>The more subtle policy, improved system of
government, and commencing diffusion of literature
in the second period,&mdash;and the still more

<!-- vol 1 page viii -->

enlightened political system, confirmed knowledge,
and popular influence, that distinguish
times nearer to our own,&mdash;give obvious room for
all that is picturesque, intelligent, and interesting
in description.</p>

<p>How far I may have succeeded, is not for
me to judge. I put forwards my present work
with diffidence. No one can think more moderately
of his powers than I do of mine; but
I must demand of my reader's consideration,
that the opinions and errors of my imaginary
characters shall not be transferred to my own.
In what singularly severe and injurious spirit
this has been hitherto done, I need not say. No
man less disregards public opinion; no man
is less disposed to offer an insolent defiance
to sincere criticism: but if an unoffending life
cannot protect a writer from those dangerous
imputations, I disdain defence, and leave them
to their judgment by all generous and unprejudiced
minds.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE crusade undertaken against the Albigenses
in the reign of Philip Augustus, in the
year 1208, had produced the most decisive
results, and had terminated in the almost
total extirpation of that people throughout
the province of Languedoc. The sack and
spoliation of Beziers&mdash;the desertion of Carcassonne
by its inhabitants&mdash;the absence of
Count Raymond of Toulouse (the ill-fated
favourer of the Albigenses), who had gone to
Rome to make his peace with the Pope&mdash;the
death of his nephew, the Count of Beziers&mdash;and

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

the general terror impressed by the sweeping
conquests and terrific cruelties of Count
Simon de Montfort, the chief of the armies of
the church<sup id="ref001"><a href="#en001">1</a></sup>, had scarcely, as it was deemed,
left a victim for the next crusade. Occasional
disturbances, however, soon began to arise,
from the unquenchable zeal and proselyting
spirit of the few surviving Albigenses; but
nothing worthy of record occurs till about
the close of the year 1214, when Count Raymond's
return from Rome, with the object of
his journey unaccomplished, gave pretext to
the Pope's legate to hold a council at Montpelier,
and proclaim a second crusade against
the followers of Waldo: Count Raymond
had pleaded his cause before the Pope powerfully;
his representations of the cruelty, avarice,
and violence of Count Simon de Montfort
and the Bishop of Toulouse were supported
and corroborated by those of Arnaud de Villemur,
and Raymond de Roquefeuille, lord of
Querci; and the Pope, moved by their remonstrances,

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

felt disposed to favour them, when,
by the advice of some members of the conclave,
who dreaded a breach with the Count
de Montfort, he was induced to dismiss them
with a reference to the legate; couched in
terms sufficiently soothing to excite hopes
he never meant to realize, and sufficiently
indefinite to justify the legate for declining
to fulfil them. On their return, therefore,
to France, they received from the Pope's
representative those evasive answers, and ineffective
promises, in which the court of Rome
was so well skilled to deal; and, perceiving they
had nothing else to expect, prepared once more
to take up arms for the recovery of their rights
and possessions. The capture of the town or
city of Beaucaire was the signal for renewed
hostilities on both sides. One hundred bishops
preached the crusade throughout Languedoc;
and the Count de Montfort, with a splendid
train of Italian ecclesiastics, armed with bulls
and indulgences, journeyed to Paris to be invested
by the King of France with the duchy
of Narbonne and the county of Toulouse,

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

vowing not to leave on his return one heretic
alive within the realm of France. This vow
was, however, owing to recent circumstances,
more easily made than kept; the want of
regular forces rendered the event of so protracted
a warfare eminently doubtful. The
King of France, less powerful than many of
his barons, and kept in a state of anxious
and restless vigilance by his neighbour, John
of England, had been unable or unwilling to
afford the slightest assistance to the first crusade.
The <i>Pelerins</i>, who constituted the main
body of the crusading army, were chiefly retained
in their ranks by the promise of forty
days' indulgence, and paradise if they fell in
battle. The former condition appeared the
most inviting, as they generally disbanded at
the end of the forty days, and took their
chance for paradise afterwards.</p>

<p>Finally, King Philip Augustus had good
reason to dread the ambition and desperate
daring spirit of the Count de Montfort<sup id="ref002"><a href="#en002">2</a></sup>; and

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

though, in obedience to the commands of the
Pope, he invested him with the duchy of
Narbonne and the county of Toulouse, he
refused to add a single soldier to the crusading
army, and was even suspected of a
secret disaffection to the cause, which nothing
but his fear of Rome prevented him
from testifying more effectively.</p>

<p>Under these inauspicious circumstances;
Count Simon, however, succeeded in raising
a powerful army, and advanced to the assault
of the castle of Monteil-Aimar, held by Guitand,
lord of Monteil-Aimar, who, with Aimar
de Poitiers, were more than suspected of secretly
favouring the cause and persons of the
Albigeois. On the other hand, Count Raymond
was said to be employed in vigorous,
though silent preparation; he was supported
by the powerful lords, the Count de Comminges,

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

Gaspard de la Barre, Enguerand de
Gordo, lord of Caraman, and Estephe de la
Vallette, whom an old historian describes as
<i>tous braves, vaillans, et bien accompagn&eacute;s;</i>
and, in spite of all his wrongs and his misfortunes,
he had a dependence on the hearts,
fealty, and indomitable spirit of the Albigeois,
which the leaders of <i>l'arm&eacute;e de l'Eglise</i> could
scarcely place in the desultory, tumultuous,
and excursive hands of the Pelerins.</p>

<p>The castle of Monteil-Aimar held out against
the forces of the crusaders; the preparations
of Count Raymond were becoming formidable,
less, perhaps, from their vigour than from their
secrecy; and thus the affairs of the Albigeois
began to assume an aspect of doubtful and
latent hope, when Count Raymond, in the
year 1216, took one of those steps which
marked the vacillating and <i>unreliable</i> character
which cotemporary and succeeding historians
have ascribed to him alike in politics,
warfare, and ecclesiastical negotiations:&mdash;he
abandoned his warlike preparations, and set
out once more to seek reconciliation with the

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

Pope; while Count Simon, wearied and ashamed
of exhausting his time and forces under the
walls of Monteil-Aimar, availed himself of the
intelligence that the castle of a noble crusader
was invested by a band of the Albigenses, to
draw off his troops, and haste to the aid of
the beleaguered fortress. It was the castle of
the lord of Courtenaye and Beaurevoir, the
most powerful and wealthy baron in all Languedoc,
and a zealous persecutor of the Albigenses,
it was said, less from zeal for the cause
of the church, than from dread of her castigations;
for he was reported to be deeply attached
to the pursuit of knowledge forbidden to man
and justly denounced by the church as impious
and damnable.</p>

<p>It was said that a numerous body of the
Albigenses (who had effected their subterranean
escape from Carcassonne under circumstances
which, though historically attested,
have all the air of romance, and had since
concealed themselves in the woods and mountains,)
had at length, stimulated by want, and
confident by numbers, rushed forth from their

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

hiding place to force their way to the dominions
of the King of Arragon, whom personal
hostility to the Count de Montfort had rendered
more propitious to the Albigeois than
the orthodoxy of his creed warranted; and
the castle of Courtenaye obstructing their progress,
they had invested and attacked it.</p>

<p>The Count de Montfort, who well knew that
these wretched people, so far from being furnished
with means to carry on a siege, (an
undertaking requiring at that period disciplined
forces, and complicated and ponderous machinery,)
were not able to oppose anything
in the field but their clubs, arrows, and woollen
garments, to the lances, swords, and complete
armour of the crusaders, laughed secretly at
the terrors of the Lord of Courtenaye, while
he availed himself of the pretext they gave him
to raise the unsuccessful siege of Monteil-Aimar.
Of the Lord of Courtenaye we have
not at this period of our story much to tell&mdash;save
that he avenged himself on his inferiors
for the general disdain and derision of his
equals. The deformity of his person, and

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

the weakness of his constitution, rendered him
incapable of bearing arms from his infancy:
it was even said, according to an opprobrious
proverbial formula of that country, that "had
he lacked a pigeon for his breakfast, the craven
could not have hit it with a bird-bolt." This
inefficiency, which exposed him so much to
the disdain of the warlike age in which he
lived, he tried to balance by the strictest severity
of feudal discipline within his castle, and
the fiercest rigour of feudal tyranny throughout
his vast domains; but neither could protect
him against the terror inspired by the approach
of the Albigenses; and he continued to urge,
by missive overtaking missive, the Count de
Montfort and the Bishop of Toulouse to speed
to his assistance. Some said that the Lord of
Courtenaye was more jealous of his niece, the
Lady Isabelle, heiress of Courtenaye and
Beaurevoir (on whose continuing unmarried
his state and wealth depended), than of the
catholic faith; and that, provided he could
keep her suitors at a distance, he cared little
how near the Albigeois might be: they were

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

mistaken; the Lord of Courtenaye, however he
might pique himself on his duplicity in other
matters, was always profoundly sincere in his
cowardice.</p>

<p>The Count and the Bishop, a warlike prelate
of that age, were advancing with their band of
Pelerins to the defence of the castle, and their
numbers were perpetually increasing with their
progress; the announcement of the new crusade,
and the report of the heretics having
had the insolence to assault the castle of a
crusading baron, had collected a number of
military adventurers, (chiefly single knights,
with their small trains of men-at-arms,) who
poured in from every province in France, all
eager to break a spear in honour of the
church,&mdash;all sure of winning heaven by dipping
their lance-point in the blood of its
enemies.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances of the times which
we have thus attempted to sketch, our readers
will not be surprised if we thus abruptly introduce
to them a solitary knight, mounted on
his war-steed, and attended by a person who,

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

without assuming the rank of squire or page,
fulfilled occasionally the offices of both. The
scenery, from its air of deep solitude, was
well stated to the lonely appearance of the
two passengers. No painter could imagine
a background of richer darkness or more profound
repose, or give a stronger outline and
character to the figures in front, than did the
evening sky and dark heath over which they
were advancing.</p>

<p>The knight and his attendant, after a long
day's journey without rest or refreshment, (for
they had neither encountered hostel, town, nor
castle in their way,) had now entered on a wild
<i>lande</i> or heath, wild as ever was trod by the
"brogued feet"<sup id="ref003"><a href="#en003">3</a></sup> of highland hunter, or "rough
Irish kerne." The wars in Languedoc had left
many parts of the country almost desert, and
the province was, moreover, at this time, from
various circumstances resulting from the operation
of the feudal system, partitioned into
vast tracts of heath, (deserted from the checked
and depressed spirit of agriculture, or from

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

their being infested by hordes of robbers or
gipsies, then almost as formidable,) slips of
arable or of pasture ground in the immediate
vicinity of towns, or cultivated lands situated
close to the castles of powerful barons.</p>

<p>On such a heath our knight and his attendant
appeared in an evening in the autumn of
the year 1216. It was about the beginning
of September; the sun had set, but there was
a broad bright band of gold round the western
heaven that powerfully contrasted the darkness
of the upper sky, and the deep shade that had
fallen upon the lace of the earth;&mdash;the heath
lay wide, brown, and unbroken around and
before the travellers to the utmost verge of the
horizon, and on its whole extent there was not
to be discovered living or moving thing, or
trace of human habitation, or aught else to
break the perfect loneliness of the view, save
the two silently advancing figures;&mdash;the deep
moss with which the heath was covered scarce
permitting the heavy tread of their steeds to be
heard by the riders,&mdash;while the forms of each
seemed dilated to the dimensions of a giant,

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

from the circumstance of their being alone on
the wide scene, and strongly defined on that
golden light whose fading richness flushed the
western sky.</p>

<p>The first figure rode far before his companion,
so as almost to be alone. He seemed
in the vigorous prime of adolescence, just at
that period when the slender and flexile graces
of youth are strengthening into the marked
and muscular symmetry of perfect manhood.
He was in armour from throat to heel, but
it was of a construction that rather displayed
than concealed the exquisite proportions of
his form; it was formed of that <i>complete</i> mail
used in those days, composed of innumerable
rings of steel, as intricately arranged as those
of a modern steel purse, and, from its Extreme
elasticity and flexibility, possessing a power of
adaptation the nicest and most faithful to the
human form. The modulation of the finely-turned
knee, the taper limb, and slender ancle,
were as perceptible through it as if they were
veiled only by the light texture of modern
drapery. This armour covered the entire

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

person, including even the feet; on the hand
it was divided at the thumb, but enclosed the
fingers to the very tips; it was also furnished
with a hood or shirt (as it was called) of the
same construction, which in battle was drawn
over the helmet, and on other occasions was,
as on the present, flung back and hung on the
shoulders, producing no ungraceful effect.</p>

<p>In his right hand the knight bore a lance,
which was held loosely, as in the hand of
one unconscious of the burthen. On his left
arm hung his shield, of the singular half-cylindrical
shape used at that period, the
sides being so bent in as to give the bearer
the appearance of being defended by a tower
on the left side; it bore for device a moon
over which a cloud was passing, with the
motto, <i>Lucei dum latet</i>. Below was a
bloody cross, allusive to the exploit from
whence Sir Paladour de la Croix Sanglante
had derived his title and his fame. At his
saddle-bow, as he rode, hung his ponderous
gisarme, and his helmet of the uncouth and
tub-like fashion then in use, and which a

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

cotemporary writer describes not unaptly as
"<i>lebes inversus</i>." Over his shoulders fell in
ample folds a mantle of the richest scarlet,
the cross on which, transferred from the
shoulder to the breast, announced that the
warrior was devoted to the crusade, not
against pagans, but heretics.</p>

<p>The knight's head was covered only by a
barrel cap, without jewel, plume, or favour,
which did not conceal the dark luxuriance
of his curled chesnut locks; and his features,
thus exposed, displayed that perfect beauty,
to which imagination or art would vainly, in
copying them, have added tint or touch: they
were such as might have visited the inspired
dreams of a classic sculptor, haunted by the
godlike images of "the fair humanities of
old religion," the deity of Delos, or the son
of Maia. The slight degree of unmanliness
which the rose-leaf tint of the cheek, and
the "riper and more lusty red" of the small
mouth, gave to his contour, was corrected by
the commanding character of his noble profile,
the shade of his dark hair, and short but thickly

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

curled beard, and a brow, on whose broad
expanse thought seemed to sit as enthroned.</p>

<p>Yet over that brow hung a cloud, whose
elements, unanalysed and unknown to the
sufferer himself, lay brooding there like the
thunder-clouds that gather in the glorious
west of the summer evening-sky; and the
smile of the eye and lip that nature had shed
her brightest radiance and roses on, made
strange contrast with the storm that scowled
and blackened above. The unfortunate youth
was conscious when this expression began to
settle on his features, for it was accompanied
by an undefinable feeling that had haunted
him from childhood, and which he felt must
one day determine his mortal destiny;&mdash;dim
traces of past events, effaced resolutions and
forgotten struggles, lay like a mass of ruins
in his memory; but, amid these ruins, the
image of a terrible vow stalked forth like a
tenanting spectre, and, while all else of the
past lay obscure, colourless, and dream-like,
forced itself on the mind's eye with the hideous
vividness of distinct and vital reality. The

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

recurrence of this image was attended from
his childhood upward by increasing horror&mdash;with
the expansion of his faculties the image
seemed to expand, and the burthen to increase,
till it was becoming too much for reason to
endure. The hour of his visitation was on him
now; he passed his hand twice or thrice across
his forehead, and then, unable to master the
rising fiend, called with a quick and eager
voice to his attendant to join him, whose ill-favoured
visage, bore a sinister expression of
timidity, cunning, and affected vacancy. The
attendant complied, with shrugged shoulders,
up-turned eyes, and that mixed expression of
deference and derision which a crafty domestic
assumes, conscious that his cunning is more
than a match for his master's power or anger.
"Where are we now, knave?" demanded the
knight.</p>

<p>"Upon a lone heath, without the vestige
of human habitation, or the trace of human
foot, or the mark of man or beast to guide
us," quoth the attendant, looking leisurely
around him, as if he had been merely required

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

to give a topographical sketch of the spot
where they stood.</p>

<p>"If I lacked the track of a beast to guide
me," said the knight impatiently, "I would
surely have bid thee lead the way."</p>

<p>"Your knightship forgets," said the squire
doggedly, "that we are warned ever to eschew
the <i>mark of the beast</i>,"&mdash;(the term applied
by the catholics to the professors of the heretical
religion, and which was retaliated by the
reformers on the catholics three hundred years
afterwards with equal felicity of allusion and
acrimony of retort.)</p>

<p>"Truce with thy buffoonery," said the
knight, checking his steed, "and tell me truly,
if thou knowest, where we be; this heath
seems to spread before us, as we advance&mdash;the
night is gathering round us&mdash;and I am
all uncertain of the track we are pursuing."</p>

<p>Before the knight had ceased to speak, the
squire disappeared; and the former, striking
his lance in the earth, rested on it for a few
moments, like one who sought forgetfulness
of himself and of all around him, when the

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

attendant suddenly came galloping back, tossing
his meagre arms, and shouting at the top
of his shrill voice, "I have found it&mdash;I have
found it."</p>

<p>"What hast thou found?" said the knight,
snatching his lance from the ground.</p>

<p>"Only, that we have lost our way," said
the squire, dropping his arms, elevating his
eye-brows, and standing before his master with
that ineffable expression of mingled stolidity
and cunning which he had generally found
available in averting the anger which his
humour, at once shy and mischievous, sullen
and caustic, seldom failed to incur, often to
the hazard of his misshapen bones. On this
occasion the experiment was once more successful,
and the knight changed his humour of
anger for one of laughter.</p>

<p>As they continued to ride on in anxious uncertainty,
the scene began somewhat to vary,
and some features of diversified landscape appeared
dimly in the departing twilight. "Shall
we betake ourselves," said the knight, "to
yonder wood on the left? Its darkly-tinted

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

mass," he cried, gazing on it, "seems like
an assembled host waiting the leader's war-word&mdash;now,
as the breeze rises, the foremost
branches bend and float like standards in the
van, and that dense and serried mass in the
rear stands like a noble harvest for the sword
to reap&mdash;shall we thither, knave?"</p>

<p>"Yea, marry," said the squire; "and the
rather, because men say there be as many
wolves as leaves in that wood; and what rent
their fangs and claws may make in that goodly
shield and mail of price, I leave to God, your
knightship, and the armourer; in whose danger<sup id="ref004"><a href="#en004">4</a></sup>,"
lowering his voice, "perchance you
stand for their value."</p>

<p>"What think'st thou," said the knight,
pausing, "shall we hie us to those hills on
the right?&mdash;such, methinks, was the track
the Pelerins pointed out to us."</p>

<p>"Perchance so," quoth the squire, "because
they know them to be haunted by a
sort of bears, and peradventure they are so
jealous of your bearing away the honours of

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

the crusade against those heretics, that they
would first send you to tilt against their brethren
of the hill and cavern by way of essay;&mdash;take
my counsel, valiant knight, and rather encounter
the dint of fifty of those rascal-heretics'
clubs on your crest, than the fangs of a dozen
bears in your flesh;&mdash;Heaven pardon me, but
I could hardly chide them for comforting their
bowels as they might, when I feel the ravage
grief and emptiness are making in mine own."</p>

<p>"Thou hast not fasted longer than thy
master, I trow," said the knight.</p>

<p>"All's one for that," rejoined the squire;
"your knight's stomach is all for fighting,
your squire's for fare wholly more nutritious,
digestible, and Christian-like; marry, there is
also a huge difference in their capacity as in
their taste; your knight can break his fast on
a tournament, dine heartily on a battle, sup
lightly on a duello, and sleep on the siege of a
castle or two, and then (insatiable as he is!)
whimper for the lack of similar dainties for
a month to come; while your squire, Heaven

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

help! needs no more than four meals a day,
with contingencies&mdash;and when his stomach
hath rung matins, noon, and vespers, to some
forty pounds of beef or boar's flesh, moated
with brewis, flanked with capons, and gallantly
guarded with rosemary and bays, he thinks, in
the moderation of his spirit, of nothing more
than to pray to his Saint Venter, that his
devotions may be paid at the same shrine
every quarter&mdash;of an hour."</p>

<p>While the squire was thus delivering himself,
the knight caught the glimpse of several
figures passing swiftly along the verge of the
heath,&mdash;the increasing darkness, and the speed
with which they rode, preventing his discovering
whether they were armed or not; at the
same moment, but by very different, instincts,
the knight spurred forward, and the attendant
after, so closely as almost to thrust the nose
of his jade among the bases of the richly
caparisoned war-steed. "Seest thou yonder
group?" asked his master. "Of them I may
learn my way, or perchance join them in

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

theirs." Then turning to the attendant&mdash;"I
wot not what may be the issue of this
encounter, or when we may again meet&mdash;hast
thou any provision, poor knave?"</p>

<p>"A quarter of kid and a loaf of buck-wheat,
that I bought of a peasant while your knight-ship
was at shrift this morning&mdash;poor viands,
and all unfit for knightly food. Would I had
the secret of that widow of Zarephath, of
whom I have heard monks tell, though the
close fathers would never confess in what part
of France she sojourned."</p>

<p>"Thou art not then unprovided for; and
for myself I reck not," said the knight, dashing
his heavy spurs into his steed, and disappearing
in a moment. The feelings of the unfortunate
squire, distracted between the wish to
enjoy his meal undivided, and his terror at
being thus suddenly deserted, broke forth in
the following exclamations.</p>

<p>"Hear, sir knight, hear me!&mdash;in the name
of all the saints or all the devils, will you run
a tilt against (it may be) a host of spirits that
haunt this heath?&mdash;By the mass, an' I have

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

not a mind to devour the whole quarter for
mere vexation, I am no true squire&mdash;and a
morsel might refresh me!&mdash;Turn back, I say,
sir knight," (here his exclamations became evidently
fainter)&mdash;"ah, foul befall thee, losel
squire, who pamperest thyself when thy master
is in peril!&mdash;now the fiend ha' me if I swallow
another morsel&mdash;save this, to give me strength
to cry after him!&mdash;Nay, now my mouth is so
full, it is in vain to strive&mdash;he will never,
never," said the squire with a sigh, "return to
taste a morsel of it&mdash;so it were better briefly
to discuss what remains, than leave it, perchance,
to be the prey of these accursed
heretics."</p>

<p>While the attendant was thus vociferating
gradually <i>in diminuendo</i>, and masticating <i>in
crescendo</i>, the knight rode across the heath,
and prepared himself to accost the group he
was approaching. In spite of the increasing
darkness, he could observe, as he drew near
them, one of distinguished figure, who by his
gestures, seemed about to dismiss a numerous
body of attendants, and to prepare to ride

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

alone. There was something awful and even
ghostly in the appearance of this shadowy
group, who parted at the signal of their leader
in perfect silence, the deep moss of the heath
tendering their horse-tramp scarce distinguishable
even amid profound stillness. They
divided, part wheeling to the right, part to
the left, like broken masses of the heavy evening
clouds, and the knight and the stranger
were left alone on the heath; the latter still
continuing to extend his arm in the direction
his band were now faintly seen pursuing.</p>

<p>AS Sir Paladour approached the stranger, the
latter wrapt himself in the folds of a vast
houpland, which covered even the flanks of
his horse, and, drawing his barret over his
face, seemed wishing to render his person
wholly undistinguishable. To the inquiries of
the knight, however, he prepared to return an
answer; especially when the inquirer added,
"Methinks the band of Pelerins of whom
I sought my way this morn have shown me
aught but the right one."</p>

<p>"So do they with many," said the stranger
in a disguised voice, and evidently with a deeper
meaning than his words at first seemed to bear&mdash;"so
do they with many&mdash;it is their use;
meanwhile, sir crusader, (for such I deem you,)

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

your courtesy enforces me to teach you what
otherwise I might withhold. Your way to the
castle of Courtenaye lieth right onward, yet
may you hardly reach it by to-morrow's night;
and in your way, if I remember me, there
is a lake, over which I doubt that you
will find bark or boat to waft you at this
hour."</p>

<p>"Sir traveller," said the Paladour, "thou
knowest, that to place peril in the path of a
true knight, is to determine his choice of that
path, were a thousand courting him to safety."</p>

<p>"There is more than you wot of, perchance,"
said the traveller. "Men say&mdash;I vouch not
for the tale&mdash;that at midnight a female form
appears on the lake, and beckons belated travellers
to her bark, promising to waft them
over with all swiftness and security; but of
those who embarked, none within mortal
memory ever reached the other side."</p>

<p>"Of earthly might I reck not," said the
knight after a pause, "and unearthly I defy,
having this morn been shriven by a holy recluse
who dwelt in a rock, being of the order

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

of St. Simeon Stylites<sup id="ref005"><a href="#en005">5</a></sup>, the odour of whose
sanctity hath reached hither even from the
shores of Egypt, where God's people sojourned
of old."</p>

<p>"And thus prepared, thou art most fit to
join the band of the crusaders," said the stranger,
with a peculiar expression. "Go," he added&mdash;"go,
and add one more to the countless and
causeless enemies of the unfortunate Raymond
of Toulouse.&mdash;Forbear thy thanks," he continued,
interrupting Sir Paladour; "forbear them
till thou meet Count Raymond in the field; to
him I refer thy debt of obligation. Pay him
not with thy words, but thy deeds; and look
they be the boldest thine arm ever wrought, or
I shall hold thee still my debtor."</p>

<p>"Oh, that the hour were come!" exclaimed
Paladour, while his steed, as if participating
in his riders feeling, reared and pawed the
earth; "my lance should pierce more deeply
into his false heart than did ever the lash of
the legate Millon into his flesh when he did

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

penance for the slaughter of the holy preacher
and martyr Ch&acirc;teauneuf<sup id="ref006"><a href="#en006">6</a></sup>."</p>

<p>"Perchance," said the stranger, in a voice
still more subdued, "he had before received a
wound, in whose anguish that of all others was
forgotten; before the legate's lash had marked

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

his flesh, a deeper one had torn his heart&mdash;he
had lost two fair sons."</p>

<p>The knight, confounded at this appearance
of compassion for a heretic, indignantly reined
up his steed, and exclaimed, "Art thou then
a fautor of that arch-heretic&mdash;and have I
rode in peace by the side of one who upholds
him?"</p>

<p>"No, so save me Heaven," said the stranger
solemnly, "as I know not a more deadly enemy
to Raymond of Toulouse than him with whom
thou talkest; all other foes but me he might
have defied&mdash;but what is thy cause of quarrel,
youth, to him?"</p>

<p>"Askest thou the cause of quarrel," interrupted
Paladour, "between a champion of
holy church, and the mortal foe of her faith
and her fold?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;I had forgot," said the stranger,
acquiescing. After a long pause, which neither
of them (now alike mysteriously suspicious
each of the other) seemed inclined to
break, the stranger spoke: "Art thou lettered,
sir knight?" said he.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

<p>"I skill somewhat of the learned tongues,"
said Paladour, blushing at the avowal of an
acquirement then held to be the exclusive
accomplishment of the 'book-bosomed
priest.'</p>

<p>"Then thou hast perchance read of a wight
in antique story, surnamed the Just?" said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"He was a Greek," replied the knight;
"his name, I take it, was Aristides."</p>

<p>"Clerks tell of this Aristides," rejoined the
stranger, "that, when he was about to be
banished by his enemies, a rustical man prayed
him to write his name on the shell of banishment,
avouching that the branch of his hatred
sprung from no deeper root than his jealous
weariness of hearing him ever named the Just.
It is said of this Count Raymond, that he is
noble and pitiful&mdash;courteous to his peers, and
fulfilled with all gentleness to his vassals and
subjects."</p>

<p>"Men speak him so," said Paladour.</p>

<p>"And wilt <i>thou</i> sign his sentence too?"
asked the stranger.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

<p>"He is the enemy of God, and therefore
mine," replied the knight.</p>

<p>"Farewell, sir knight," said; the stranger,
who appeared unwilling to trust himself with
farther parley; "perchance, ere long, Count
Raymond may defy thee to make good the
boast thou hast this night uttered."</p>

<p>"To the bounds of Christendom, and at
peril of my life," exclaimed the youth, "I
trust in the good cause for which I combat,
that I shall pierce the arch-heretic's heart,
were my lance a reed, and he in panoply of
adamant."</p>

"So wouldst thou do him most acceptable
service," said the stranger; "he is one who
would rather feel the lance of a knight in
his bosom, than the lash of a monk on his
shoulder," Thus saying, the stranger clapped
spurs to his steed; his parting form was seen
for a moment through the mist, and then lost.</p>

<p>As the knight rode slowly on in the direction
indicated by the stranger, the scene became
wilder, and the night more gloomy;&mdash;it
was one of those nights so rare on the

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

continent, which recall the image of the sad
and troubled atmosphere of the north, where
masses of dark-grey cloud, with a few gleams
of pale and dusky white, pursue each other
incessantly, and make the sky appear like a
dark and agitated ocean suspended over our
heads. The objects around were now scarcely
distinguishable; but by the sound of waters
the knight perceived he approached the lake,
and, alighting, he led his steed cautiously.</p>

<p>The gleams of a struggling and watery moon
broke forth at that moment, and he found
himself on the border of a lake of some extent,
enclosed by rocky hills on every side,
save that by which he had approached it.
A breeze, whose sound was multiplied by the
echoes of the shore, swept over its dark surface,
and sent its waves with hoarse and heavy
murmurs to his feet. Amid the hills were
a few huts, and an aged fisherman was
hauling his crazy boat on shore. At the
sight of a knight in armour leading his steed,
the old man was about to fly; but, reassured
by the tones of Paladour's voice, he remained,

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

though visibly with reluctance. The gift of a
few liards assuaged his fears, and the natural
anxiety of solitude for the relief of human
intercourse soon made him communicative.</p>

<p>Shaking his head at the desolation around
him, he began to tell, that, till lately, the
fishery of the lake had supported the inhabitants
of the neighbouring huts, who were accustomed
to sell its produce chiefly to the Lord
of Courtenaye, and the wealthy abbot of Normoutier;&mdash;that,
within the last two months,
a female form had appeared, rowing a bark
along the shores of the lake, the terror of
whose presence had prevented the boldest
fishermen from venturing out, and the little
community was thus reduced to poverty. She
never spoke to any of the peasantry, but was
sometimes heard talking, or rather chanting,
to herself. She never debarked, but was seen
by some whom fear or curiosity kept awake to
watch her, rowing whole nights close to the
shore, and apparently waiting with anxiety for
some one whom she was to waft over.</p>

<p>When a knight or armed man arrived at the

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

lake, she eagerly offered her services; but of
those who accepted them, it was said that not
one had ever reached the other side. A holy
and intrepid monk, had once ventured to address
her as she lay resting on her oar beneath
the shadow of a rock in the twilight; but he
soon shrank from the conference in horror,
and declared afterwards, that he must do deep
penance to clear him from the sin of listening
to the words he had heard.</p>

<p>The knight, whose strong faculties struggled
with the credulity of that dark age, demanded if
the fisherman indeed believed that a being,
human in form and action, could exercise such
deadly operations on the elements, and their
inhabitants. "For what cause," said the old
man, "did my net break this morning&mdash;and
my strong line, when I cast it, float on the
surface like a rush, as if it were flung there to
catch water-flies withal?" And he sat down
sullenly among his broken nets, as if doubting
of what use it was to repair them.</p>

<p>"The night wanes, and I must win yonder
shore ere midnight," said the youth; "bear

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

me thither in safety, old man, and I will
requite thee like a knight."</p>

<p>"Not for the ransom of a crusader," said
the fisherman; "against such encounter the
mail of a knight is of as light avail as the
dank and sorry weeds of the fisherman&mdash;as
thou thyself shalt prove, an' thou tarry longer,"
he added, pointing with his trembling hand to
what seemed a swell on the distant surface of
the lake, but, as it approached, appeared to be
a boat rowed by a female form.</p>

<p>Sir Paladour watched its approach in silence;
he counted every stroke of the oar, of
which the sound seemed to smite on his heart.
The female pursued her task silently, but
with increasing force, and in a few moments
her oar sent the spray dashing against the
stony bank on which stood Sir Paladour, his
arm wreathed in the mane of his war-steed.</p>

<p>"Embark, sir knight, and come with me,"
were her first words; "the boat is launched&mdash;the
sail is set&mdash;the oar is feathering the surge.
Long have I wandered on this lonely shore,
and all for thee&mdash;embark, then, and come;

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

your passage shall be swift, and your welcome
fair on yonder shore. Many await you there;
and I bear a charge to waft you to them."</p>

<p>"Jesu preserve him who trusts to your
pilotage!" muttered the old fisherman, who
at first had retired to some distance, but still;
continued to linger without departing. While
he spoke, a gleam of moonlight gave Sir Paladour
a view of the figure who addressed him.
Instead of the witch-like and haggard features
he had expected to see, the glimpse he had of
her lineaments showed them to be noble and
majestic, suited to her lofty stature, but discoloured
by an unnatural paleness; her dress
was that of a peasant, a tunic and mantle of
woollen cloth, but she wore it not like a
peasant; her hair, grey, but of a remarkable
length, floated on her shoulders. She stood
upright in the boat, resting one arm on the
oar, and waving the other with a gesture of
lofty invitation to Paladour.</p>

<p>It was impossible to look on this singular
being, seeming a creature of the elements,
sailing for ever under the clouds of night,

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

and apparently dwelling on the dark waters,
without deeming her something "not of this
world." There seemed, too, a power of fascination
in her silent look; for the knight, as
he viewed her, felt himself impelled towards
the bark.</p>

<p>"Now go not with her, sir knight, in the
name of heaven," cried the old man&mdash;"go
not, as you dread body's scathe and soul's
peril."</p>

<p>This adjuration was strengthened by the
cries of another voice; it was that of his
squire, who came on galloping at full speed,
and exclaiming, "Turn back, sir, knight&mdash;wherefore
should you be so wilful to wend
with the fiend?&mdash;turn back, in the name of
all holy saints!&mdash;Would that you were as
well learned in their lives and legends as in
those lying scrolls of troubadours, more apocryphal
than my grandame's winter tales, that
send you madding after these misadventures,
to the perilling of your soul, and the manifest
discomfiture of your forlorn"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had you no warning of danger," said the

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

old man, "ere now?" laying his hand on the
reins of Sir Paladour's steed.</p>

<p>"I remember somewhat," said the knight,
musing&mdash;"but all uncertainly; what was that
the traveller told as we rode by the way?"</p>

<p>"The traveller was the devil, and yonder
ill-fared<sup id="ref007"><a href="#en007">7</a></sup> hag is doubtless his dam," interjected
the squire.</p>

<p>"Ill-fared!" repeated the female, the awful
and ruined majesty of whose figure seemed to
dilate in the moonlight&mdash;"ill-fared!&mdash;was it
so once?&mdash;or was the past a dream, and is
the present a lie?&mdash;Yet, well it may be&mdash;evil
passions do upon our frame more deadly work,
than time or distemperature; and the greenest
tree of the forest, when scathed by the lightning,
becomes a gnarled and unsightly stump."</p>

<p>"Lo you now, what a captious spirit!" quoth
the squire&mdash;"a most delicate and exceptious
devil! my rosary to a handful of acorns but it
is a female fiend&mdash;she can bear to be called
the devil without wincing&mdash;marry, the word
'ill-fared' galls her shrewdly."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

<p>"Paladour de la Croix Sanglante," said the
female, "befits it one who wears chain and
spurs to take counsel with fishermen and
grooms, when his course lies fair, and a
woman is his guide?&mdash;Erase the impress
from thy shield, or give it for the guard of
some bolder heart."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the knight sprung into the
boat, which shook with the impulse of his
bound, and the weight of his armour; the
moon sunk behind the clouds, and a flock
of birds, roused by the clash of the armour,
flew in heavy circles and with melancholy
cries above their heads.</p>

<p>"Nay, then," said the squire, sadly retreating,
"may lance and shield avail you in
the matter you wot of!&mdash;I trow beads and
breviary were the better gear for such encounter.&mdash;St.
Dennis to speed, did ever earthly arm row so swiftly!"</p>

<p>The faint beams of the moon were reflected
from the knight's armour, and gave a dim and
shadowy tinge to the figure of the mysterious
pilot, as the boat, whose track furrowed the
lake with a long line of silvered foam, departed

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

with its freight from their sight. The fisherman
and his companion remained standing on
the shore, and gazing after it, when a shriek,
the most wild and fearful that ever pierced
the human ear, reached them. No other
sound was heard that night but the moan of
the wind or the murmur of the lake; nor ever
again was that female seen rowing her bark
on its waters.</p>

<p>Before dawn the fisherman conveyed the
knight's attendant with his steed across it, and
the latter found his master alone on the other
side. There were a few spots of blood on his
armour, and he was plunged in one of those
fits of profound and gloomy thought which
his follower dared not arouse him from. Even
when it had passed away, no question, whether
put insidiously or directly, could extort from
him an answer; and in silence they pursued
their way to the castle of Courtenaye.</p>

<br/>

<p>WE must now hasten to the scene and company
that Sir Paladour was speeding to join,
and introduce the reader to the spot where
various parties of the crusaders were assembling
in detached and irregular bands, suitably
to that desultory and unorganized system of
warfare which formed one of the most striking
characteristics of that period. The country,
for many a league round the castle of Courtenaye,
was all alive with military preparations;
and though reports hourly arrived that not an
heretic had yet appeared beneath its walls, the
crusaders continued to press forward with unabated
speed. Here were to be seen the lords

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

and barons of Languedoc arraying their men-at-arms,
in rescue of one whom, though they
despised as an ally, they dreaded as a dark
and potent enemy;&mdash;young knights who had
mortgaged their lands to purchase gaudy and
gilded coats for themselves and their followers,
to win favour in the eyes of the lady of the
castle;&mdash;troops of engineers, their huge wains
groaning under the weight of mangonels and
arbalists, or guiding on wheels their catapults
and war-wolves, and all that "devilish enginery,"
which anticipated, before its invention,
the most destructive effects of gunpowder;&mdash;straggling
troops of Pelerins, the wandering
condottieri of that war, with cross shifted from
the shoulder to the breast;&mdash;and troops of ecclesiastics,
regular as well as secular, with crucifix
and banner, fairly displayed, chanting aloud
the "Exsurgat Dominus" amid the deafening
hum of martial preparation,&mdash;fierce contention
often arising between these two classes,
the latter threatening to shut the gates of Paradise
against the contumacious, and the former
menacing to withhold the aid of the arm of

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

flesh, and leave the churchmen to wage rosary
and crucifix against the clubs and arrows of
the heretics. These were generally appeased
by the <i>Bonnibelles</i>, who followed this tumultuary
array in competent numbers, and were
most frequently the objects of contention themselves.
Nor were there lacking in flank and
rear of the crusading army bands of minstrels
and mimes, furnished with all the dissoluteness,
poverty, cunning, and amusive powers,
which were then, and still are, "the badge of
all their tribe." Now, harping to knights and
nobles in their silken pavilions,&mdash;now vainly
trying to woo the ear of a village churl,&mdash;now
caressed, and now spurned, always necessary,
yet always contemptible, with hearts as light
as their purses, and a good-humoured vanity,
making them ample satisfaction for all scorns
and wrongs,&mdash;they lived that life of exigencies
and extremes that seems to the individual
himself something unreal and dramatic; as
if he were <i>acting</i> a life, not living one,&mdash;the
very excitement constituting its wild charm,
and its perils and privations possessing an

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

interest denied to the homely monotony of
every-day existence. Such was the army and
array of the crusaders.</p>

<P>It was the night following that on which
Sir Paladour had been encountered on the
heath, that, in the van of this tumultuous
band, there came riding on three distinguished
crusaders, who, though pursuing the same
direction towards the castle of Courtenaye,
seemed, by the slowness of their pace, and
easy lightness of their conversation, either
much to doubt the danger which menaced
its lord, or wholly to disregard it. This group
consisted of the Bishop of Toulouse, a conspicuous
character in that age,&mdash;an old knight,
Sir Aymer du Chastelroi, and a young one,
who rode beside him in silence. The bishop
led a numerous band of men-at-arms, amply
appointed; in their van rode a body of priests,
one of whom sustained the weight of his vast
crosier, and the other his banner, emblazoned
with the mitre, and bearing the motto of the
crusaders, <i>Dieu et l'Eglise</i>, wrought in gold.
Close behind him was a confessor, mounted

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

on a goodly mule, and telling his beads; while
two pages on foot led the prelate's war-steed,
the noble animal champing and rearing, as if
he longed for an armed weight to press his
loins, and already "smelled the battle afar
off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting."
His master seemed to share his impatience,
often looking back on the fiery force
he hoped ere long to bestride in battle, and
which, in truth, none save himself seemed
able to guide or to command. He had that
marked and regular, but chilling physiognomy,
which seems rather that of a statue than of
a breathing man,&mdash;an impression which was
strengthened by the gigantic proportions of
his figure, the immobility of his iron features,
and the stern repose of his large commanding
eye. He was arrayed less according to the
military costume of the age, than to his own
ideas of ecclesiastical chivalry. He disdained
the aid of the defensive armour allotted at
that period to the higher classes exclusively;
he wore neither hose nor shirt of mail, but
a corslet laced over a well-quilted gambazon.

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

He had also cuisses and greaves of polished
and ponderous steel; and at first sight it would
have been difficult to distinguish the warlike
prelate from a man fully armed, but for the
magnificent and jewelled cope which he wore
on his head; while his helmet hung at his
saddle-bow, or was occasionally given to a
priest to bear, who received it as reverently
as he would a relic.</p>

<p>Combining in his single person all the physical
powers that were the requisites of the
stormy age in which he lived, with all the
mental energies that make themselves known
and felt in every age, the Bishop of Toulouse
presented to the eye all that is imposing and
magnificent&mdash;to the mind all that is overpowering
and formidable&mdash;a man of power
and might, body and soul, whose strong mind
clung to his strong frame like the human part
of the centaur of old to the animal part, making
but one between them; the former urging
and directing the latter, and the latter seconding
the mighty impulses of the former
with a force that seemed instinctive and
connatural. Beside the bishop rode the

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

brave old merry knight, Sir Aymer du Chastelroi.
He was in armour, but had his helmet
doffed for ease; and his bald forehead, grey
locks, and lank cheeks, were strongly contrasted
with the laughter of his blue glittering
eye, and the curl about his lip, sometimes
sarcastic, always jocular.</p>

<p>The firm seat he kept on his war-steed,
(which he disdained to change for a pacing
palfrey) and the ease and address with which
he wore his heavy harness, proved him a
knight "not dubbed on carpet consideration,
and with unhacked rapier," but one who,
though in advanced years, "at their own
play, could foil a dozen would-be's of the
day." The brave old knight had stirred himself
in his tower, like a veteran war-steed in
his stall at the sound of the trumpet, on the
intelligence that the castle of Courtenaye had
been invested by the heretics; and set out at
the head of fifty men-at-arms (the appointed
complement of a knight); but through his
sympathy with young bloods, or his condonation
for old&mdash;the placket the former
loitered for, or the pullen the latter coveted,

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

the good knight seldom rode with more than
fifteen out of fifty of his company; yet he
never gave them word of rebuke, jestingly
overpassing the one, and but coldly chiding
the other. The youthful knight, his companion,
seldom spoke; his head, covered with
a profusion of pale golden locks, was generally
declined, and be seemed meditating on softer
subjects than crusades or sieges. Sometimes,
when jocularly addressed by Sir Aymer, whose
notion of humour was by no means delicate,
he looked up, and, blushing for the effeminate
beauty of his features, he touched his budding
mustaches, as if anticipating the time when
his visage would boast a more martial and
manly shade.</p>

<p>As the party rode on, their conversation
ran diffusedly as that of men apparently more
occupied with the local inconveniencies of
their progress than with the object of its
termination. "How now, Sir Aymer," cried
the bishop, "are we near the castle of this
lord of Courtenaye?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

<p>"I know not well," replied the knight;
"for, by the mass, when I enter on a doubtful
way towards nightfall, I care not whither my
course tends, so it have end at all&mdash;hamlet or
hovel, tower or town. Many a cherry lip and
grey eye<sup id="ref008"><a href="#en008">8</a></sup> may be found under the woollen
hood; while the white hand you kiss in a
castle-hall may take you over the lips for
the license."</p>

<p>"What! art thou there still, mad knight?"
quoth the bishop with a smile; "still for the
placket and coif?&mdash;marry, other pursuit would
better befit thy years, and thy vow of chivalry
binds thee to aid distressed demoiselles, not to
add to their number."</p>

<p>"Mine age!" retorted Sir Aymer; "many
a breast has been prematurely swept by a white
beard ere now; and your snow," he added,
stroking it, "was ever a close neighbour to
your volcano. For my vow as a knight, let it
rest with thine, lord, as a churchman; men
say that the Bishop of Toulouse would not

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

have sped so fast to the aid of the Lord of
Courtenaye, had not the beauty of the Lady
Isabelle, his niece, outshone the brightest
blazonry on his towers."&mdash;The bishop smiled,
not unpleased,&mdash;"But, reverend lord," pursued
Sir Aymer, "should we fail to reach the
cattle of Courtenaye to-night, may we not
harbour with the Abbot of Normoutier? a
festive churchman he, and a hospitable&mdash;who
will not spare the best of his fare, and the
choicest of his wine, to welcome us withal."</p>

<p>"What!" said the bishop impatiently, "ask
hospitality of that mere murderer of languages,
against whom the soul of every martyred letter
in the alphabet will rise up in judgment at the
last day?&mdash;Wot ye not, that though he hath
scarce Latin to mumble a mass, yet would the
fool be learned, and he betaketh him to a
cunning priest, praying him for certain phrases
of the Latin tongue to grace his speech withal;
and sir priest, in a witty spleen, teacheth
him phrases clean contrary to the meaning he
seeketh to convey; so that he cannot utter his
reasons in plain language, if they be not tagged

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

with some remnants of ill-assorted Latin. By
the bones of St. Benedict, the founder of his
rule, I had rather couch on the heath, than on
the softest bed in the abbey of Normoutier.
I would dream all night of the dispersion at
Babel, or wake to be haunted by the ghost of
some basely murdered quotation. Was it not,
as we went on pilgrimage to holy St. John of
Beaucaire, in honour of the martyr Ch&acirc;teauneuf,
that he broke forth with, How now, my
fellow-pilgrims, what talk shall we beguile the
way withal? for, as a father saith, <i>loquendi
homines magistros habemus, tacendi Deos</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That breaks no squares," said Sir Aymer,
affecting to listen as if he understood him&mdash;"that
breaks no squares with a loreless knight,
though it may with a lettered churchman&mdash;that
my lord the abbot's saws shall be found
of light digestion when swallowed along with
his rich viands&mdash;what say you, Sir Amirald,
to our choice of harbourage for the night?"</p>

<p>"That I had rather kneel to receive the
bishop's lance in my bosom at the gates of
Normoutier, than his benison in the halls of

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

Courtenaye," said the youth, with an emotion
that made strange contrast with his silvery
voice and boyish features.</p>

<p>"How now, sir boy!" said the ancient
knight, laughing, "art thou such a heretic
in love that thou speakest thus of the walls
that enshrine the very saint of beauty, the
dame sans peer, the Lady Isabelle?"</p>

<p>"She hath been a good mistress to me,"
answered the youth in a subdued voice&mdash;"a
noble and a gentle&mdash;and to save one
golden hair of her head from shredding," ('Her
hair is brown,' muttered Sir Aymer,) "I would
pour my heart's last prayer, my heart's best
blood."</p>

<p>"Nay, I wage my knighthood, spurs and
all," said Sir Aymer, "that we win him yet
within the towers of Courtenaye; and to prove
that I am master of the spell, I will conjure in
a name less potent than that of Lady Isabelle.
Hear, thou recreant to beauty; were the castle
of Courtenaye this moment invested by the
heretics, headed by that incarnate devil, Raymond
of Toulouse&mdash;were the barbican won,

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

the moat crossed&mdash;every loophole filled with
shot from arrow and arbalist&mdash;tower and
bastion rocking with the blows of war-wolves&mdash;every
pinnacle and battlement ablaze with
wild-fire and burning darts&mdash;whom wouldst
thou plunge amid the burning ruin to save?"</p>

<p>"The Lord of Courtenaye," answered the
youth, with a fierce but generous pride; "and
as I bore his cankered and worthless body
through the flames, I would whisper to him,
'I swore to be avenged of thee, and I am!' "</p>

<p>"Well sung, young cockerel of no dunghill
brood!" quoth Sir Aymer; "thou wilt one day
crow that all France shall hear thee."</p>

<p>"What hath been the youthful knight's
wrong?" said the prelate, half excited by the
emotion of Sir Amirald, who now, apparently
ashamed of betraying, or struggling to subdue
it, rode apart.</p>

<p>"Marry, an old tale, my lord," said Sir
Aymer&mdash;"the mere burthen of a minstrel's
ditty&mdash;how a page loved to kiss my lady's hand
better than her pantoffle&mdash;how he was thereupon
sentenced to the discipline of the porter's

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

lodge&mdash;how he resisted&mdash;how my lady prayed&mdash;how&mdash;but,
<i>infandum, regina, jubes renovare
dolorem</i>."</p>

<p>"Reserve it then till I am more in the
mood of condolence," said the bishop, whose
eye had caught another figure through the
increasing gloom; "for I would first gladly
learn whether he who approaches through the
darkness be friend or foe. I heard his horse-tramp
on the heath long ere I beheld him."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the stately figure of a knight,
completely armed, approached then; and the
shade could no longer conceal the lofty grandeur
of his air, or the martial splendour of his furniture.</p>

<p>"Now, by'r Lady," said Sir Aymer, than
whom none was better skilled to judge of
'the thewes and sinews of a man,'&mdash;"Now,
by'r Lady, a knightly presence and a noble&mdash;would
that he may ride up and join our
company!"</p>

<p>While this was said, the knight advanced,
and saluted the party with a lofty grace, with
which the slight reverence of modern ceremony

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

would make most vile comparison, and, with
his hand raised to the visor of his helm, and
his plume almost touching his horse's mane,
he demanded of them if they were bound to
the same cause and course with himself. His
action, as he spoke, made the cross on the
breast of his mantle visible; and Sir Aymer,
without further explanation, greeted him with
the free welcome of the brave. "Welcome,
fair sir," he said; "our cause and errand are,
without question, the same. We be crusaders,
who speed to the aid of the Lord of Courtenaye;
we march in ample strength and meet
appointment to his rescue&mdash;Fie, where be
those loitering knaves of mine?" And here
the old knight cast an abashed glance on his
dispersed and desultory train, ashamed of the
license he allowed them, and of himself for
allowing it. "My holy lord," he muttered,
"I pray you hold the stranger knight in
parley while I chide the knaves for their
tardiness."</p>

<p>The bishop, meanwhile, was scanning the
young crusader as he would a noble animal

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

whose physical force he was appreciating, or
more properly a machine whose momentum
he was calculating. "Benedicite!" he said,
in his most gracious tones, "journey you
with us, sir stranger knight?"</p>

<p>"So your holy lordship pleases," replied
the youth.</p>

<p>"It pleaseth us well," answered the prelate;
"thou art armed in the cause of holy church,
and we are also the soldiers of Christ&mdash;ride
up beside our rein. Why, here," he cried,
in admiration unrepressed, "here is an
arm might mow down a heretic host as
the fire kindled by our peasants consumes the
weeds of the field&mdash;a hand that might fell the
oak of the forest with a blow&mdash;a breast that
might meet the flight of a hundred arrows,
and shake them from thee like bird-bolts from
the pinion of a soaring eagle. Stand up in
thy stirrups, sir stranger, and let me view thy
might."</p>

<p>The youthful knight obeyed, with a mixture
of proud submission and graceful consciousness.

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

He rose upright in his stirrups, poising
himself with his lance, and then slowly sunk
to his seat, bowing low to the bishop.</p>

<p>"God's mother!" whispered Sir Aymer,
who had meanwhile rejoined them, "is he
not one in a thousand?"</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst rightlier say, a thousand
in one," said the bishop, smiling.</p>

<p>Sir Aymer, who had availed himself of the
interruption caused by the stranger's approach
to lead the party into the road that conducted
to the abbey of Normoutier, was in no mood
to contend with the bishop; but, being somewhat
of Polonius's taste in topics of conversational
amusement, he broke forth ere they had
ridden half a mile: "Alas, for a troubadour's
tale, or a minstrel's lay, to cheer us as
we speed!&mdash;or even for that witty parrot who
bore the loves of the son of King Antiphanor
to the lonely lady of the orchard<sup id="ref009"><a href="#en009">9</a></sup>. I warrant
me, sir stranger, thou couldst unfold some
curious and delicate love-tale if thou wouldst;

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

but give modesty to the devil (marry, I know
no one else will take her,) for a moment&mdash;What!&mdash;I
know thee for a lover and a loyal
one; that trick of thy folded arms&mdash;that careless
tossing of thy reins on thy steed's neck&mdash;that
smothered sigh that ushers every word&mdash;nay,
thou art convicted to thy very heart; betake
thee to thy confession, and we will share the
penance by listening to thy tale&mdash;list, young
Amirald, and be edified."</p>

<p>"For a career in the lists of love," said the
stranger, trying to catch the vein of the
merry knight, "you shall hold me excused,
if I boast not of trophy or prowess&mdash;&mdash;I
am one of Dian's knights, and my
heart is yet sans impress or device; but if
I am summoned before the parliament of love
to answer for my treason to its sovereign, I
shall doubtless choose for my proxy so gay and
loyal a votarist as I deem thee, sir knight."</p>

<p>Old Sir Aymer smiled at the compliment,
while he felt it a jest; then, "What will the
youth of this age come to," he cried, in a sad
and sententious tone, "when sixty must be

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

proxy for twenty!&mdash;But be it so&mdash;shift we
the theme to war; to that strain I warrant me
thou canst sing a mean or bass without a
trumpet to rouse thee."</p>

<p>"Among valorous and veteran knights,"
said the youthful stranger, "such theme would
ill become the lips of an adventurer who hath
joined your company by chance, and who
claims no honour but that of being reckoned
among the meanest of those who contend for
the rights of holy church."</p>

<p>"That shall not serve your turn, sir knight,"
said the persevering querist; "you have looked
on deeds of chivalry ere now."</p>

<p>"I have been at the siege of the castle of
Andely, and of Ch&acirc;teau-Gaillard," said the
stranger with reluctance<sup id="ref010"><a href="#en010">10</a></sup>.</p>

<p>"And that was a glorious encounter," said
Sir Aymer, kindling at the name of the first&mdash;"when
Robert de Lacy held out full bravely
for his liege lord, King John of England. He
was Norman by birth, that Robert de Lacy,"

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

he added, passing his hand over his brow.
"Tell us some stirring tale of the siege, sir
knight; the English claim all the glory for
the defence made by <i>their</i> Robert de Lacy."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said the stranger in a subdued
voice, "that he whom men call Gaubert
the Swimmer did good service at that siege."</p>

<p>"I heard not of him," said the bishop&mdash;"how
goes the tale?"</p>

<p>"He was a man of huge strength and
dauntless resolve," replied the youth; "and
when the castle held out beyond all expectancy,
when surprise was hopeless and assault
desperate, he disrobed himself on a dark night
by the edge of the castle moat, and, fastening
around him certain earthen vessels skilfully
stopped, and containing fire within, he plunged
into the moat, and, diving his way across,
lodged the concealed fire under the bastions,
and ere morn the castle was in a blaze above
its defenders' heads, and Robert de Lacy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember me now," said the prelate,
with marks of impatient weariness; "but, for
mine own part, the feats of villains and of
vassalry leave me lightly in their debt either

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

for credence or for merit&mdash;tell us, if thou
canst, a better tale, or let us have at least
a better hero."</p>

<p>"The next that I remember," said the
stranger, who seemed to shun speaking of
himself, "was Pierre Bogis, surnamed Camus<sup id="ref011"><a href="#en011">11</a></sup>,
whose piercing eye discovered a window
in the basement story of the castle, which
was kept open to air a magazine withal,
and which the besieged imagined was concealed
from all. At peril of his life he swam
the fosse, clomb the parapet, wrenched the
iron bars from the window, and, ere morn,
the Earl of Chester yielded him prisoner to
King Philip, who, in requital of his valorous
bearing and stout defence, permitted him to
walk the streets of Paris free, till order could
be taken for his return to England."</p>

<p>"Thou merely weariest us by these tales of
the rascaille," said the proud prelate; "what
know or care we for thy Gaubert and Camus
(whose nose, short as it might be, was, God
wot, an overmatch for his pedigree,)&mdash;canst

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

thou not preach to us from a text that will
teach loftier lessons?&mdash;Were there not, at the
taking of Ch&acirc;teau-Gaillard, three youthful
candidates for knighthood, who had borne
them with such high and equal courage in
the assault, and done such sprightful deeds
of gentle emulation, that the king exclaimed,
as he stood on the well-won turrets of
Ch&acirc;teau-Gaillard, and saw the reek of its
smouldering bastions ascend, and hover like
clouds o'er the mouth of a volcano, 'Whoever
plunges into that gulf of fire, and brings
to us the most precious thing that can be
saved from its burning ruin, him will we make
knight-banneret on the spot where we stand,
and he shall bear the oriflamme before us in
battle, though kings riding beside our rein
contended for its grasp.' At the word, the
three youths plunged into the fiery darkness."</p>

<p>"It reminds me of a tale I have heard,"
quoth Sir Aymer, "how King Frederic of
Sicily tempted a foolish diver to plunge into
the gulf betwixt Scylla and Charybdis (two
potent sorceresses, men say,) for a silver cup,

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

or the like foolish toy&mdash;marry, he never saw
cup or diver more, and for what befell them
the polypuses must answer."</p>

<p>"The first youth," said the bishop, disregarding
the interruption, "whom men called
Sir Ezzelin de Verac, returned with a beautiful
woman whom he had saved, and bore her in
his arms to Philip's feet, not doubting that
such prize liked his sovereign well. Perchance
those in lofty state cannot brook a saucy consciousness
of their pleasant vices in an inferior,
which they deem like a rebuke; for so it was
that the king turned in displeasure from the
youth&mdash;in truth, his goodly form was so defaced
by affectation, and his scarf and adornments
were of such fantastical and overwrought
fashion, that he seemed fitter to play in a
pageant with maskers than couch lance among
knights who do battle. The second, the wealthy
heir of Semonville, had worked like a mole
amid the foundations of the castle, where the
waters of the moat slaked the inendurable
heat, and brought from thence pix, chalice,
and candlestick of solid gold, worthy the high

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

altar of Notre Dame in Paris; but he approached
the king with an air so mean and
proud, so full of pretension and emptiness,
and with a touch withal of base and plebeian
confidence in his costly prize, that the king
would have laughed outright, had not another
and a nobler form stood beside him, bearing
in his mantle somewhat which he seemed
anxious, yet trembling, to offer to his sovereign."</p>

<p>"And what was that," said Sir Aymer,
smiling, "which King Philip held of dearer
preciousness than beauty or than gold?"</p>

<p>"King Philip," quoth the bishop, "looked
more earnestly on the youth, and bade him
advance and show the prize he had won.
From the folds of his bloody mantle the
youth drew forth an infant, the child of an
heretic Albigeois, (who had got, Heaven knows
how, into the castle,) and whom its parent
was about to cast into the flames, when the
youth, baptizing it in his blood, whose trace
the forehead of the infant yet bore, hasted to
offer it to his sovereign, as the most precious

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

relic of the ruins. At sight of this prize, King
Philip demanded the name of the youth;
whose blood, fast streaming through his broken
armour, made the sacrifice of the drops with
which he had assoiled his wretched burthen
more precious and more perilous every moment.
'Men call me Paladour, my liege,' said
the youth, bending beneath the keen regards
of Philip's eagle eye&mdash;'but my birth, my
descent, are all unknown to me; mine infant
life began with mystery, and not a ray hath
yet broke on the dark and thorny path I have
trod to manhood.' 'It is the destiny of some
to be the last of a mighty race,' replied the
king, 'and of others to be the first; take thou
no shame, youth, that the latter and better
fate is thine. I trust to the promise of thy
gracious and manly form, that the honours
now bestowed on thee will flourish in thine
own house 'unto the end of many generations'&mdash;Grace
&agrave; Dieu, so much of holy writ
have we learned from our chaplain Bigord&mdash;Paladour,
kneel down.' The youth obeyed.
'Rise up, Sir Paladour,' said the king, after

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

a short whisper with an old knight (who was
as skilful in toys of heraldry as if he had
emblemed the banners of the twelve tribes
when camping in the wilderness)&mdash;'Rise up,
Sir Paladour <i>de la Croix Sanglante</i>, knight
banneret, dubbed on the field of battle by the
hand of thy liege lord.'&mdash;'And now,' he said,
'let our surgeon look heedfully to his wounds,
or France may lose the stoutest lance in her
host, and chivalry the fairest flower in her
ample field of honour and of gentleness.' "</p>

<p>"And what said the young knight to this
golden prodigality of royal praise and honour?"
asked Sir Aymer, touched for a moment with
generous admiration; then relapsing into the
habit which time and indulgence had made
inveterate, he loosely added&mdash;"marry, that
night I warrant the fairest maid in the vicinage,
not the royal chirurgeon, found ready salve
for his wounds; and the young knight would
rather have pledged his new-won spurs than
wanted his will."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;on my life&mdash;on my soul, he would
not," broke forth Amirald with all the fervour

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

of young enthusiasm, and the freshness of
untainted purity&mdash;"the breast over which so
holy a blazon is spread can nourish none but
holy thoughts and pure."</p>

<p>"Be not in such haste to enshrine thy
demigod, sir boy," said the bishop, with a
proud laugh of dissolute derision; "men say
the infant was a promising one, and that the
youth had a fatherly care of it&mdash;not without
cause."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have neither parent nor child," said the
stranger, speaking for the first time after a
long interval.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the breeze wafted aside his
mantle; and the moon, which now rode high,
threw her bright full light on the cognizance
of Sir Paladour de la Croix Sanglante. The
effect of the discovery, made thus involuntarily,
was strikingly marked by the different modes
in which it was recognized by the bishop,
Sir Aymer, and his youthful companion. The
former, full of fire and interest while the relater
of a narrative which he believed unknown to
the hearers, felt all that interest lost when its

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

genuine hero appeared; and, after a few words
of cold but courteous compliment to Sir Paladour,
he was silent;&mdash;not so old Sir Aymer;
after causing his steed to make sundry caracoles,
he swore, "by Mary's knight, a gentler
passage of knighthood might not be found in
story;"&mdash;while Amirald, springing from his
steed, bowed his knee beside Sir Paladour's
stirrup, and with resistless enthusiasm pressed
his lips to his glove of mail.</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of a bell, heard
deeply amid the silence of night, struck the
ears of the crusaders. They paused, and
reined up their steeds. The sound was repeated.
Though their armed train was now
left far behind, their courage defied all thought
of danger; but there was something unspeakably
solemn in the sound thus heard at night,
on the verge of a lone heath whose limits were
lost in darkness, for the moon was again
concealed in heavy clouds, and the bishop's
attendants had not yet lit the torches with
which they were provided. In a few moments,
during which scarce a breath was drawn, from

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

a sensation at once awful and pleasurable,
lights were seen twinkling through a wood to
the left, which till then had appeared like a mass
of solid and sable rock, and a band of monks
emerging from it with tapers in their hands
in regular procession, offered, in the name
of the abbot of Normoutier, the hospitality of
the abbey for the night.</p>

<p>The night had become intensely still; not
a breeze stirred a leaf of the wood, or ruffled a
fold of the churchmen's garments; the tapers,
burning upright and steadily, gave their strong
light to the mailed forms, floating plumes, and
reined and pawing steeds of the crusaders, and
to the sombre habits and white scalps of the
monks, the latter strongly defined on the dark
and clustered trees that formed the background
of the scene. To the bishop's indications
of reluctance and distaste at this unwelcome
invitation, Sir Aymer replied, by urging
the impossibility of reaching the castle of
Courtenaye that night. To his further intimation
of danger from wandering bands of
the heretics, who were known to be dispersed

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

over the country, the bishop replied only by
an impatient movement to pursue his journey.
But when Sir Aymer, whose heart was in the
cause, whispered to the prelate the loose discipline
and luxurious accommodation of the
abbey, and swore that they would be little
molested by any bell within its walls, save
those which ever tolled punctually for the
service of Saint Jentaculum, Saint Prandium,
and Saint C&oelig;na, the muscles of the bishop's
face began to relax, and with them relaxed his
resolution.</p>

<p>"Sith better may not be," said the bishop
in a reluctant tone&mdash;then casting his eye on
the armed train, who, at the tidings that they
were about to halt for the night, began to
gather fast round their leaders&mdash;"where, in
the name of Lot and his guests, are all these
to be housed and fed to-night?"</p>

<p>"My holy lord," said Sir Aymer, "you are
not to learn that the abbot of Clugny hath received
into his hospitalitium three kings, with
their trains, yet never a monk was dislodged
from his pallet to make room for a page in

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

the royal following&mdash;I trust there is not less
wealth or less courtesy within the walls of the
jolly abbot of Normoutier&mdash;trust me, we shall
fare well."</p>

<p>"On, then, in the name of Heaven, since it
must be so," quoth the bishop; "I shall at
least escape the sufferings of St. Jerome, who
was punished by the angels for his unchristian
familiarity with the writings of Cicero. I am
not likely to hear much of him to-night, and if
I did, the ancient, if raised from the dead,
could not swear to his own name were it
uttered by the abbot of Normoutier."</p>

<p>As the prelate spoke, the train of knights
and men-at-arms approached the gates of the
abbey of Normoutier.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<br/>

<div class="small">

<p>There was high feasting held at Vaucouleur.</p>

<p class="right">SOUTHEY.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE valves of the great entrance were displayed
to their utmost extent on the approach
of the crusaders, and the bishop rode through
them in pride, recollecting that such entrance
was never opened but for a royal visitor, or
for one honoured next to royalty<sup id="ref012"><a href="#en012">12</a></sup>. Sir
Aymer and the young knights followed; and
fast behind them came the mingled and multitudinous
throng of men-at-arms, Pelerins, and
military stragglers, all zealously inclined to put
to the proof the munificent hospitality of the
princely-revenued abbot of Normoutier. The
group rallied, and formed in a vast square,

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

which was enclosed by the buildings of the
abbey.</p>

<p>The lord abbot, who was engaged with a
guest whom he much wished to conceal, and
who, like many modern inviters, had sent the
invitation in strong hopes of its being rejected,
now rushed forward, in his first trepidation,
issuing contradictory orders, and uttering unintelligible
quotations, in the same breath, to his
visitor, and to the monastic officials, who
crowded into his presence for direction and
orders. To the former he whispered, "Hide
thyself with that speed thou hast. Alack!
thou hast not had a morsel of food or a cup of
wine. <i>Lusisti satis edisti atque bibisti</i>." To
his cross-bearer, "Do me thine office seemly;
knowest thou not its dignity, and to what thou
mayst yet aspire?&mdash;Hum.&mdash;<i>Pasces in cruce
corvos</i>." And as the friars thronged into
the procession, eyeing their stony figures, and
the perpendicular and motionless folds of
their drapery, he murmured, "Ay, this looks
well.&mdash;<i>Sinuantur flamine vestes</i>."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

<p>And while the torch-bearers stood in goodly
row,</p>

<p class="small">Each holding as it were a staff,<br/>

A taper burning bright.&mdash;SOUTHEY.</p>

<p>"They burn steadily and bright," he cried;
"<i>Afflavit Deus ventis, et dissipantur</i>.&mdash;Now,
where be my ring, my cope, my"&mdash;as
he hastily indued the insignia presented
by the lay-assistants&mdash;"Now all is meetly
ordered, and as a father saith, '<i>Asinus
portat mysteria</i>.' Now for a witty greeting
to meet the bishop withal&mdash;as&mdash;<i>Amice, ad
quod venisti</i>&mdash;Fie, that were stale,&mdash;they say
the ghost of my predecessor murmurs that at
the door of my cell every night."</p>

<p>As the lord abbot spoke, the increasing
trampling of the steeds, the clashing of the
armour, and the ringing of the massive spurs
of the knights on the paved court, warned him
he had not a moment to lose; and quickening
his movements, he led the way, surrounded by
his ecclesiastical attendants, to greet his distinguished
guests with the mingled courtliness

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

and formality of a man of the world and a
monastic dignitary.</p>

<p>His guests collected in such order as they
might, to await his welcome; and as they
stood, rode, or knelt, the torches lit by the
bishop's attendants blazing on the band, there
was a magnificence of grouping, a glare of
light, a depth of shadow, a broad and bold
outline of the principal figures, and a tumultuous
and massive heaping in the perspective,
that made the scene of meeting like a dark
but richly tinted picture, of some hand of the
olden time; such as we see by dim and unpropitious
light in some ancient gallery, and wish,
as we gaze, to snatch it from the wall, and hold
it up once more to the light before it fades for
ever.</p>

<p>The inner gates, at the extremity of the court,
opposite to, and correspondent with, those
of the great entrance, widely unfolded, displayed
the goodly person of the abbot, standing
between their ample valves, with a vast
attendance of monks and torch-bearers in the

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

rear; taper and torch flinging a yellow and
smoky but strong glare on the foremost
figures of the group on both sides; while the
vapour, eddying in thick and heavy wreaths
round the cloistered stories, narrow windows,
and tapering carved spires of the interior
buildings, and then descending, settled in a
dark but richly tinted mass (purple streaked,
like that which precedes the thunder storm,)
over the crowded heads of the multitude, lay
and clerical, who thronged the vast area.
The light fell powerfully on the contrasted
figures of the gorgeously robed abbot and his
pale mute attendants, with their sallow aspects,
bare scalps, dark habits, and apathetic features,
and the dazzling reflection flashed back
from shirts of mail, cuisses of steel, embroidered
surcoats, emblazoned banners, and
chains of all rich metals, and the caparisons
of war-steeds, mingled from the sparkling
chevrons on their foreheads to the gilded
bells on their necks, with the scarlet and
purple plumage of their crested riders,

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

who vailed their heads low in honour of their
host, while the court of the abbey rung beyond
the echoes of its loudest bells with the trampling
of the steeds, the trooping of the multitude,
the tumult of martial and monastic
life, thus abruptly thrown together, yet each
combating for and maintaining its own splendid
formality and solemn pretension. Even the
well-intended courtesy of the knights, as they
sprung from their steeds, and lowering lance and
pennon, in reverence to the place, shook the
stone pavement with the clatter of their
armour, caused a din that, warlike, exhilarating,
and glory-sounding as it was, made the abbot's
brains reel under his jewelled cope; and he
hasted to bestow the monastic forms of benediction
to his guests, to avoid further ceremonial.
It was at this moment that above, and
distinct from all other sounds, a voice from the
crowd was heard to exclaim, "Hold&mdash;hold&mdash;tarry
for <i>my</i> blessing! I have waited long
to shed it on you: tarry a moment yet."</p>

<p>The bishop and the knights, amazed, reined

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

up their steeds, and cast back angry glances
on the train, conceiving that this interruption
must arise from some drunken minstrel, or
"all-licensed fool," who had chosen ill time
to vent his buffoonery in.</p>

<p>The men-at-arms who followed them, as if to
exculpate themselves from such charge, opened
on each side in opposite semicircles, and in
the centre stood a figure, covered in dark
drapery from head to foot; sex, form, and age,
were alike undistinguishable; only the torch-light,
resting fully through the wide opening
just made, rendered the form perfectly visible.
For a moment it seemed motionless as it was
inscrutable; then advancing, with a movement
whose rapidity caused some tremor in
the breasts of those it glided past, it stopped
between the bishop and the abbot. "Bless
on," it said, in a soft and unnatural voice,&mdash;"I
come to bless also." Then, with a sudden
and supernatural exaltation of accent,
"Accursed be ye slayers of men!" it cried,
pointing to the crusaders, "accursed be ye
who bless those that deface the image of your

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

mutual Maker! For every drop of blood <i>ye</i>
shed, or <i>ye</i> sanctify, may oceans of molten
lead be roaring and hissing for you in the
teeming, over-seething cauldrons of your master
and mine."</p>

<p>"Blasphemer&mdash;wizard&mdash;sacrilegious!"&mdash;uttered
a thousand voices, and a hundred
lances were raised against the offender: one of
these chanced to raise the thick veil that covered
the figure; it fell back, and discovered the
form of a woman. The uproar increased, "A
female, and within cloistered walls!&mdash;a female!
shame for thy sex! and insult to these walls!"
cried the ecclesiastics, "What makest thou
here?" The military followers soon caught
the example of indignity and outrage, and the
wretched female was hurried to the gate.&mdash;&mdash;Breaking from them she exclaimed, in
a voice that made the rudest pause:&mdash;"A
woman! Yes; Did not a woman bear ye?
Did not a woman nurse ye? Did not a woman
love ye? Ay, or ye had never grown to that
pitch of lustihood: and manly and grateful
use ye make of it, to thrust and throng a
woman thus!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

<p>Some of the gentler held back; and taking
advantage of her momentary liberation, she
walked rapidly forward, and standing close to
the bishop of Toulouse, before he was aware
of her approach, she asked abruptly, "Dost
thou know me?"</p>

<p>"Know thee, vile hag!" cried the proud
prelate, recoiling from her in ineffable disdain.</p>

<p>"Yet thou knewest me once," said the
figure, "and I know thee yet; drunk with
pride, and crime, and blood, as thou art; and
as deeply and bitterly as I have wished, from
this withered heart, that I had never beheld
thee, so deeply shalt thou wish, one day, from
that burning and ulcerated heart of thine, that
thou hadst never seen <i>me</i>. Oh! vengeance is
long-lived; and for years after the tree is
blasted and leafless, the trace of the lightning
that scathed it remains on its trunk. Knowest
thou me?" she continued, turning to Sir Paladour.</p>

Paladour, who recognized his guide over the
lake, and round whom fearful reminiscences,

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

and more terrible anticipations, began to gather
at the sight, shrunk from it, and leaned for
support on the shoulder of Sir Amirald; who,
ignorant of the cause of his agitation, supported
him with that homage, at once affectionate
and reverential, which the youthful
brave are first to pay to the mature in valour
and glory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wretched female was fast
hurried to the gate by the military and ecclesiastic
attendants; but not before, turning
her tall figure, and waving her arm above her
head, she exclaimed, "Ye know me not&mdash;ye
know me not&mdash;none of ye know me
now. Be it so; but ye will all&mdash;all&mdash;ay,
spurn and buffet me as ye will," she cried,
struggling with the rude attendants&mdash;"Ye
will all, at mortal peril of your lives, and
to your souls' eternal bale, ye <i>shall</i> all know
me hereafter."</p>

<p>She was then thrust from the gate; and this
accident little discomposed the ceremonial of
the meeting. The procession moved on; the

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

bishop, reverently welcomed as the prime guest
in honour and sanctity, marched at the right
hand of the abbot; the knights followed,
through a narrow and stone-paved passage;
the clank of their armed tread and ringing
spurs making its arches resound with other
echo than that of the whispered Benedicite, so
long the sole and tranquil tenant of its solitude.
From this dark and narrow passage, which
Sir Aymer, as he stumbled through it, termed
the previous purgatory to the paradise of the
abbot's refectory, the guests passed into a
spacious hall. It seemed dim at first, but the
attendants crowding in fast with their torches,
and arranging themselves behind the guests,
as they seated themselves, soon made the
space which they encircled as bright as noon,
while the thick smoke that arose from the
torches formed a kind of atmospheric canopy
that enriched and deepened the lustre below.</p>

<p>The banquet was worthy of the wealth and
hospitality of the abbot of Normoutier. At
the extremity of the two long tables, which
extended half the length of the refectory, there

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

was a transverse table, to which the abbot led
the bishop and his more distinguished guests:
this was the <i>dais</i> of this monastic banquet-hall,
and was raised about three feet above the
level of the paved floor; but all the tables
were heaped with the same profusion of game,
fowls, and fish, (not cold, like the relics of a
feast, but all smoking, and all of them "grisamber
steamed,") with entremets of marchpane,
blanc-mange, and <i>subtilties</i> then so
called, being devices in confectionary, with
figures, flags, and mottoes. All wondered how
the abbot could on the sudden heap his tables
with such daintiness and profusion; but that
was a secret which the lord abbot kept to
himself; and it was certain that the appetite of
his guests was not at all observed to diminish
in consequence of their not participating in it.</p>

<p>Ample store of pigment and claret washed
down their costly viands, and reconciled even
the most fastidious of the feasters to the comparatively
coarse accommodation of this conventual
revel. Save the tables,&mdash;which were
covered with carpets, sore worn and much

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

stained with wine, and the benches, which
were totally bare,&mdash;the ample hall was wholly
unfurnished; except that, in an obscure unheeded
nook, stood a kind of wooden pulpit,
from whence, in days of purer discipline, a
monk used to read a homily or a legend during
the period of the temperate meal. Yet, amid
this meagre and uncouth arrangement, there
was a picturesque glory of light and colouring,
of costume, and character, that redeemed the
inferiority of all "appliances and means to
boot," and shed over this mixture of meanness
and magnificence a lustre that intoxicated
the eye and the imagination.</p>

<p>The volumes of dark and wreathed smoke,
that rose from the torches of the attendants,
hung at an undulating distance above:
above them still was seen the dark but
richly carved wainscoting of the refectory,
which rose to the height of eighteen feet on its
walls; and above that again the sole vast
window, that enlightened it by day, and that
now, with all its glory of emblazoned panes,
and burning hues, and figures of saints, as

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

glowingly portrayed as if the tints were
kindled at the flames and furnaces that consumed
them, rose in rich pride above the
mingled and heavy masses of light and vapour
that crossed each other in the lower part of
the hall. And above all, the risen moon,
in her full-orbed light, gleamed through the
uncoloured compartments of the topmost panes
with pure, pale, silver light. These three
strongly-marked belts of light might, even to
an unimaginative gazer, have suggested the
idea of the gross and sordid vapours that
depress the soul in its first aspirations; then
of the gorgeous, mystical, and fantastic gleam,
that superstition sheds, on the eye it dazzles
and bedims; and, lastly, of that pure and
holy beam that breaks on the soul that has
struggled through the mists of life, and the
illusions of fanaticism, and fixes its failing
organ on that light which emanates from Him
who is light, and the Father of it.</p>

<p>Unconscious of thoughts like these, or,
indeed, of any but what were "more germane
to the matter" of feasting, Sir Aymer, after his

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

trencher had been often replenished by the
sewer, and his goblet still oftener by the cellarer
and his assistants, turned suddenly to the
bishop of Toulouse, and exclaimed, "Said I
not, my lord, that I would quit your tale of
the knight De la Croix Sanglante, with a
romaunt of mine own, worth many a minstrel's
tale?&mdash;Marry, the bishop heeds me
not&mdash;he is deep in sad and holy talk with the
lord abbot.&mdash;Now Heaven forefend that I
should mar their conference! Doubtless it is
on some grave matter, touching the widening
of the nunnery grates, or the abridging of
veils and frontlets; would they would admit
me of their counsel! Come on, Sir Paladour,
pledge me in a full goblet, and thou shalt hear
a tale worthy a knight's ear."</p>

<p>"Noble knight," said Sir Paladour, slowly
raising the, goblet to his lip, and slightly
tasting it, "Noble knight, I pledge you."</p>

<p>"Nay, I will name a pledge," quoth Sir
Aymer, "that will make thee drain the goblet
as if a favour from thy lady-love lay sparkling

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

at the bottom. Pledge me here to him<sup id="ref013"><a href="#en013">13</a></sup> who
saved the life of king Philip at the battle of
Bovines."</p>

<p>"To the bottom of my cup and of my
heart," answered the young knight, emptying
the former at a draught. "But who was he,
I pray you? I have heard of him, but men
said that, with the modesty of a true valour,
he shuns all fame and mention."</p>

"And he doth so," answered Sir Aymer,
repelling the monitory pressure of Sir Amirald's
hand on his mantle. "Nathless men
will talk of him, though the virtuous fool
himself were praying them for silence. Bore
you arms on that bloody day, sir knight?"</p>

<p>"I was not so honoured," answered Paladour.</p>

<p>"Ah! there were deeds wrought to stir
the blood in bold hearts, and make the
harps of minstrels ring as though the chords
were fire!" cried Sir Aymer; and he proceeded,

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

in "good circumstance," to detail the
battle of Bovines to Sir Paladour; whose ear,
filled for ever with mysterious and inaudible
whisperings, caught but half his tale, and welcomed
the noisy stranger but coldly. Sir
Aymer described the vast disparity in numbers
betwixt the army of king Philip and that of
the emperor Otho; the former amounting to
but fifty thousand, while the latter trebled that
number.</p>

<p>He spoke of the skilful disposition by which
the king of France gained to his forces the
advantage of sun and wind, and the (till then
unheard of, or, at least, unpractised,) system of
warfare, by which he arrayed the squires and
armour-bearers in the van; with whom the
knights of the imperial army, disdaining at
first to contend, were mowed down by hundreds;
till, feeling the blows of squires as
heavy and mortal as those of dubbed knights,
they deigned at length to return them, but too
late to prevent their own utter defeat and discomfiture.</p>

<p>So far Sir Aymer related like a cool and

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

experienced martialist; but when his narrative
bore him into the heat of the battle, his
heart and tongue kindled with his theme,
and he exclaimed, "Hadst thou seen, sir
knight, the close of that day, thou hadst never
wished to behold another: no after-time, or
after-tale, were worth the living for or listening.
The field was well-nigh won by king Philip's
chivalry, when the emperor Otho, who had all
that day done deeds surpassing human valour,
made his last and furious charge against the
royal guard, who fought closely round the
king, for fear of the assassinates. It was a
perilous, and mortal shock&mdash;a bloody and
fearful grappling. The royal guard dealt about
their iron-headed clubs with heavy force and
wearied strength. The duke of Burgundy, who
fought by the king's banner, was unhorsed.
The count St. Paul, the stoutest lance in the
royal host, lay wounded, and supported by his
squires at the foot of a tree. King Philip
himself fought on foot, though he was now
dealing impotent blows on the dead bodies of
his guard, that, faithful even after death, lay

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

round him like a rampart. The emperor
Otho pressed on, mounted for the third time
that day, and surrounded by the flower of
the imperial chivalry. It was then, the few
who still fought round King Philip, and
deemed all lost in his danger, shouted aloud,
"Lower the oriflamme, in token of the king's
peril!" The oriflamme had bent no more
from its stately height all that day than the
oak of the forest, when the storm hath swept
it, and laid all but its monarch on the earth;
but, at the cry of the knights, the banner-bearer
lowered the oriflamme, and a hundred
knights, from various distances and dangers of
the field, hasted to the royal rescue. I was
then in a far distant spot, confronted with that
traitor Eustache de Maguelines; but, when I
saw the oriflamme lowered, it seemed to me
as if the sun was sunk. I know not how
it fared with me&mdash;all wandered in a bloody
mist. But I say, Sir Paladour," continued the
veteran, recovering his voice, "a hundred,
yea two hundred, sore wounded as they were,

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

so that many could scarce bestride their steeds,
hastened from every part of the field at that
signal.</p>

<p>"But there was <i>one</i>, a boy in arms, a wanderer,
a mere adventurer of the day, unnamed
and unknown, who arrived first of them all&mdash;with
one blow of a battle-axe, which he had
snatched from some powerless hand, he clove
the skull of the emperors horse, while the rider's
grasp was on the king of France's rein, who
was again horsed; and the noble steed, rearing
in mortal agony, turned with his rider from the
blow. King Philip shouted, "The emperor
hath turned his back and fled!" The word
spread like lightning. The chivalry of France
rallied;&mdash;and&mdash;and for the rest of the day," said
Sir Aymer, wiping his eyes, which overflowed
involuntarily at the mention or relation of a
noble action, "methinks this boy left us little
to do but to chase the flanks of the emperor's
host as a hawk would a flight of pigeons;
and, as we bound up our wounds, to curse the
Count of Flanders, who gave the cause of

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

quarrel. But, as touching that boy,&mdash;Know
you him?" said he abruptly to Amirald.</p>

<p>"No one knows him less," said the youth,
in a suppressed tone.</p>

<p>"There thou liest, and loudly," quoth Sir
Aymer, with the coarse jocularity permitted
in that age between equals in rank. "Thou
art the man, or <i>wilt</i> be, if thou livest to be
a man. Now, by the saints, it was thou thyself
didst the very deed, and won'st thy
title of knight banneret from the royal hand
of Philip: a hand that would, ere this day,
have been cold, had not thine&mdash;<i>thine</i>, clove
the skull of the emperor's steed. Tush, what
signify words, or becks, or blushes? reserve
them for thy bridal, if ever thou gettest a
beard, and breath enough to woo a maiden
withal. Sir Paladour, I wot thee to know
this is Amirald, who saved the life and royaume
of our liege lord King Philip. Now shame
to me, a bearded knight, to sit betwixt two
boys knight bannerets, whilst I&mdash;Fill me a
cup of Muscadel, good cellarer, to wash down
remembrance."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

<p>While the cellarer promptly handed the
cup, which the knight as promptly quaffed,
Sir Paladour, tearing off his glove of mail,
eagerly extended his hand to Sir Amirald;
and again the youth, instead of grasping it in
his, pressed it to his lips with grateful reverence.</p>

<p>"And wast thou the unknown youth," said
Paladour, extricating his hand, "of whom I
have heard such glorious tales; who, when the
oriflamme and fleur-de-lis vailed before the
lion and the dragon, upbore them like the
streamers of a drifting bark, and sailed gloriously
with them into haven?"</p>

<p>"Less honoured in such deed," said the
blushing youth, "than in the clasp of that
hand, which saved a soul from mortal sin, and
baptized it in the blood that burst from the
gracious fountain of a Christian heart."</p>

<p>"I like not this," said Sir Aymer, shaking
his head, "I like not this. I see thou hast
found thee a new brother-in-arms; and thy
father-in-arms, as you was wont in fondness to
term me, must now give place." But as he

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

spoke in a tone of affected anger, his eye rested
with delight on the view of mutual affection,
thus kindled in brave young hearts by the
recital of honourable deeds, and illuminating
features in which the glow of enthusiasm was
heightened by the consciousness of valour.</p>

<p>At this moment the raised voices of the
bishop and the abbot caught the ear of the old
knight; for whose ready organ any sound of
tumult, from the thunder of the battle to the
roar of the revel, had an excitement and a
charm; and he exclaimed, laughing, "What,
more brothers-in-arms! By my faith they
pledge their vow somewhat aloud." And he
turned towards the disputants, whose clamour
was now at the highest.</p>

<p>The abbot, according to the habits of the
age, had begun the conversation by courteously
pressing his guest to partake of various dishes,
and solemnly excusing the deficiencies of his
entertainment; but his "bald disjointed chat,"
patched with ill-assorted Latin, seemed designed
to turn into a jest the welcome it was meant
to convey.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

<p>"What now, my lord," he said; "you
scorn our sorry cheer. Nay, you must wash
it down with a cup of Muscadine, or wine of
Candy; for what saith a certain father? <i>Ne
quis modici transiliat munera Liberi, Centaurea
monet cum Lapithis rixa;</i> wherefore I
say, <i>deprome quadrimum, strenua Lyde</i>."
(The strenua Lyde was a paralytic monk of
fourscore, assistant to the cellarer).</p>

<p>"Fill higher," said the bishop, "reverend
brother, till I pledge the lord abbot; for saith
not the same father, <i>vertere pallor tum parochi
faciem, nil sic metuentis ut acres potores?</i>"</p>

<p>"By my mitre, a shrewd text, and aptly
quoted," cried the abbot. "Nay, your lordship
hath the gifts. Alack! my memory
(bestrew mine overmuch love of study) is
a blank, a desert, a quicksand. What with
the fathers, the lives of the saints, homilies
on vigils, and mysteries for holidays, the
constitutions of the order, and private exhortations,
my brain is a mere Babel, and my zeal
for learning hath eaten me up."</p>

<p>"I pray you, reverend abbot," quoth the

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

bishop, "let your memory be fruitful in answer
to an idle question:&mdash;Of what rule is your
community?"</p>

<p>The abbot's dull blue eye, that had begun
to twinkle with incipient ebriety, sunk at this
question under the penetrating glance of the
bishop, and he faltered out, "The Benedictine."</p>

<p>"I asked but for mine own satisfaction,
my reverend host," said the bishop; "for you
know," contemptuously substituting the fragment
of a royal sumptuary edict for a quotation
from a canon of the order, "<i>Nemo dudeat
dare pr&aelig;ter duo fercula cum potagio</i>."</p>

<p>"We will have none of those texts handled
now," said the abbot. "Fill a goblet of
Greekish wine, to my lord of Toulouse. My
lord, I marvel how grapes may grow in Greece,
an outlandish country, men say many leagues
from France."</p>

<p>"If I remember me," said the bishop,
"some of the rules of your order be, that the
monks quit not their cells but to go to
church, nor speak to any but with good

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

leave; that their beds be straw, with a coverlet
of woollen cloth, and their habit," glancing at
the abbot's ermined and jewelled vestments,
"a cowl, hose, and cloak of hair-cloth; that
at meals their hands be on the table, their
eyes on the dish, their attention on the reader,
and their hearts on God."<sup id="ref014"><a href="#en014">14</a></sup></p>

<p>"My holy lord," said the abbot, rallying,
"however we may as it were abridge and
overpass certain items of our rule, there be
others also of which we have high regard,
nothing intermitting the performing of the
same: for proof, look down the board, and
wherever the attention be straying, I trow you
shall find every hand on the table, and every
eye on the dish. Marry, good discipline,
and meetly observed! What! some of our
rules be as mouldy as the bones of the
founder, and did we stick to them with an
unadvised sourness, little should we joy in such
guests as gallant knights, or reverend bishops
either; seeing that, by the charter of Hugh,
bishop of Grenoble, (whose soul is in paradise,)

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

no woman is allowed to pass through
our conventual territories: a grievous prohibition,
and nowise tending, I guess, to make
our neighbourhood the more gracious to my
lord of Toulouse. For, as Saint Augustine
hath it, <i>ubi f&aelig;mina est, quid est quod potest
deesse, ubi autem non est, quid est quod potest
prodesse?</i><sup id="ref015"><a href="#en015">15</a></sup>"</p>

<p>"Thou art right, lord abbot," said the prelate,
nothing displeased at this allusion to his
gallant propensities; "and I hold thy copy of
St. Augustine more orthodox than mine own.
Were it not to behold the fair beauty of
the lady Isabelle of Courtenaye, and to visit
the shrine of that enskyed goddess, I would
not set foot in stirrup, or lance in rest, for all
the peril of her craven kinsman."</p>

<p>"They speak her a peerless and unimaginable
beauty, a treasury of unsummed excellencies,
and, indeed, a paradise of all rare
felicities," said the abbot; "and yet I warrant
I have seen fairer than she."</p>

<p>"Thou merely talkest profanely against

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

that heaven of beauty," said the bishop impatiently,
"and art a heretic in heart, if not in
thy creed. What saint hath taught thee thy
new faith?"</p>

<p>"A peasant damsel, the daughter of an
Albigeois, whom I saved from being converted
in a summary way by certain Pelerins,
on a day."</p>

<p>"Humph! since thou lackedst charity for
the task," said the bishop, "thou shouldest
have left it to more willing hands."</p>

<p>"Never trust me, but her innocent helplessness
and beauty pitied me at my very
heart."</p>

<p>"What talkest thou of thy peasant maiden?"
said the bishop in scorn; "thine eyes shall be
opened, and that shall be revealed to thee that
shall convert thee in a twinkling. Ho! brother
Eustache!"&mdash;he called to his crosier-bearer;
"my breviary, I say." Then, in a tone half
confidential, half boastful, to the abbot, "I
have caused a cunning limner to counterfeit
the features of all the prized dames of France,
in the margent of this book, under the forms
of female saints. Con the holy page well,

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

lord abbot," he added, with a smile, as he
gave the splendidly illuminated volume into
his hands, "and tell me whose lineaments
there, from Queen Ingelberg on the throne, to
the abbess Eloise in the cloister, may vie
with those of the lady Isabelle."</p>

<p>The abbot, no stranger to this invention of
profane gallantry, which was practised in
France, even so late as the reign of Henry
the Third, received the book with the smile of
a gratified connoisseur, and proceeded to study
its pages with an air of profound meditation.
The head of the beauteous Isabelle, portrayed
as Saint Cecilia, drew from him a cry of
delighted admiration; but, after gazing on it
for some time, he swore to the bishop, by his
faith as a Christian, and his habit as a
monk, that the peasant maid was fairer.</p>

<p>"An umpire! an umpire! there is treachery
in the lists," exclaimed the bishop.</p>

<p>"And to what umpire shall we better
appeal than to yon young knights?" answered
the abbot.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

<p>It was at this period of their conversation
that their exalted voices reached the ear of
Sir Aymer. The arbitration was eagerly accepted
by the young knights, among whom
Sir Aymer affected to consider himself included,
and the crosier-bearer put the gorgeous
book into the hands of Sir Paladour.</p>

<p>"A prosperous augury! the book opens of
itself at the page of my saint," said the bishop,
as he beheld the eye of Sir Paladour riveted
on the portrait of her, who was never excelled
in beauty by the fairest of the daughters of
men. "Have you ever beheld aught so fair,
sir knight?" demanded the bishop.</p>

<p>"Never," answered Sir Paladour, with a
burst of emotion, that gave that little word the
effect of volumes.</p>

<p>"Nay, let <i>us</i> judge not rashly," said Sir
Aymer; "these texts must not be so handled.
What says our coadjutor, Sir Amirald?"</p>

<p>"That I have beheld a far fairer," said
Sir Amirald, in the deep but timid tones of
suppressed emotion.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

<p>At this moment, while many gazers were
collected round the portrait, the abbot, who
had good reason for being on the watch, saw
distinctly a dark figure emerge, like a shadow,
from a distant nook, mingle for a moment among
the group unobserved, as they bent over it,
and then retire, no one seeing him but the abbot.
All his insouciance and jollity forsook him at
this vision, which he interpreted but too well.
He sunk back in his chair, pale and gasping;
then starting up, exclaimed, "The torches wax
dim, and the night doth wane, our noble guests
must needs lack repose." The guests rose.</p>

<p>"We trouble you, sir abbot," said the
bishop.</p>

<p>"Nay, my holy lord," quoth the abbot,
recovering his presence of mind, and his suavity,
"I doubt your hard couch will make
ill apology for your stinted fare. Ho! tapers
and meet attendance for my lord of Toulouse;
suffer me to be your lordship's torch-bearer."</p>

<p>The ceremonial of parting now commenced;
the bishop and abbot exchanged the kiss of
peace; the former bestowed his benison on the

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

knights, who knelt reverently to receive it, and
then on their followers, who took it kneeling
or standing, as they might.</p>

<p>"My holy lord, and noble knights, a fair
good rest," said the abbot. "My brethren, I
give you a dispensation from midnight lauds."</p>

<p>"By the mass," said Sir Aymer, "we
have sung them to St. Bacchus for the last
half hour; their chimes will ring in my head
till matins."</p>

<p>It was half an hour ere the refectory was
cleared of the guests, the monks, and the men-at-arms.
The abbot walked up and down
restlessly among the lay-brothers, who were
removing the viands, and the cellarer and his
assistants, who were busy about the wine
flagons, and drinking cups.</p>

<p>"These matters shall be cared for," said the
abbot; "tarry not now; I will lock the door
of the refectory, and the remnants of the feast
will serve for&mdash;the poor. Tarry not now,
but depart, I pray you. Why loiterest thou?"
he added, angrily, to the paralytic monk, who
tottered from the refectory, singing, or rather

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

croning over part of the hymn wont to be
chanted at the <i>Feast of Asses:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="small"><i>Lentus erat pedibus<br/>

Nisi foret baculus<br/>

Et eum in clunibus<br/>

Pungeret aculeus.</i></p>

<p>"Take heed, thou sluggard," said the
abbot, whom association had made familiar
with the meaning of the Latin words, "lest
thou hast to pray thy Saint Aculeus too to
spare thee his goad, an' thou tarriest longer."</p>

<p>The ample hall was at length empty, and
the abbot walked up and down for some time,
looking at the fragments of the feast, with an
expression of restlessness and absence. As
the last servitor departed, the abbot went out
and locked the door of the refectory. In the
meantime all bed-rites had been done to
the guests of the abbey: the monks had resigned
their cells to the men-at-arms; the
rude and disorganized band of the Pelerins
were housed in the ample offices of the abbey.
The bishop of Toulouse was marshalled to his

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

selected apartment by the sacristan, with a
wax taper in each hand, followed by two
monks with torches. He took courteous leave
of the knights in the narrow passage which
led to their separate apartments, and entered
his own. The splendid curtains that encanopied
his bed were of silk, wrought with silver
and gold, the sheets were cambric, and, contrary
to the decree of Urban the Second,
the coverlet was of miniver; yet this superb
chamber lacked all the appliances which a
modern garret would have furnished: in lieu
of them stood an ample vase of holy water,
and opposite, in a niche, which contained the
image of the Virgin, two tapers were lit, whose
smoke had blackened it to the hue of ebony.
The bishop threw off his robes, which he
had resumed during the feast; the wind,
from a broken casement, shook the tapestry,
that, coarsely nailed to the walls, shivered in
every blast; the rats chased each other over
the floor, and gnawed at the gold-twisted
hangings of the bed; and the bishop, after
gazing on the martial figures in the tapestry

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

till their shapes multiplied and darkened in
his eye, sunk into a slumber. Sir Aymer
was conducted to an inferior apartment;
and when the monks who attended him
thither retired, leaving him to the care of his
squire, the old knight flung himself at his
length on a wooden settle, or form, in his
chamber, and bidding his squire call him if the
heretics assailed the abbey of Normoutier
ere morning, was asleep in a moment. Sir
Paladour and Sir Amirald were ushered to
the same chamber. An over-watched and
weary monk placed a lamp on an oaken stand,
and, with a drowsy Benedicite, left them,
together. In silence, they flung their armed
limbs by each other; and a muttered night-prayer,
and short but fervent clasp of each
other's hands, were the only preludes to that
slumber which soon fell deeply on both. Sir
Paladour's dreams were illuminated by the
lovely apparition of the lady Isabelle; and
Amirald's by one still lovelier.</p>

<p>Through the vast extent of the abbey walls,
the sounds of tumultuous and highly excited

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

life subsiding into repose, were heard every
moment less and less distinctly. The cataract
of noise that all night had thundered through
court and cloister, was fast sinking into a
stilly murmur, and soon that murmur itself
was hushed. The snort and stamp of steeds,
and the noise of the inferior multitude in the
outer court, ceased first. On them always
falls first the blessing of the "<i>prima quies</i>."
Then died away the clash and clang of the
iron-shod men-at-arms, as they trod the passages
to their respective cells, or flung themselves,
like rocks of metal, on their creaking
pallets. Then all was still, save the whisper-like
hymn of the novices from the pistorium;
where, after it had been duly sifted and prepared
by the priests and deacons, they were
employed in shaping the consecrated wafer
for the holy ceremonies. At this moment the
abbot was stealing unseen, with a lamp in his
hand, and his sandals off, along the passage
that led to the refectory. After a long pause
he slowly opened the door, and throwing,
while he held up the lamp, an apprehensive

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

glance around, he entered. All was dark in
the deserted hall. The abbot, treading as if
every footfall would waken a slumbering
enemy, descended a few stone steps, to a low
and narrow-arched door, that lay below the
level of the paved hall: he opened it, and
whispering, "Descend swiftly, all is safe, and
the night is wearing fast;" descending steps,
for the door opened on a narrow stair, soon
greeted his ears; and the figure which had
been seen more than once that night within
the walls of the abbey, bowing beneath the
narrow door, entered the hall of the refectory.</p>

<br/>

<p>AS this strange visitor crossed the hall, the
abbot threw himself into his chair with an
air sullen and dissatisfied, but inquisitive and
anxious withal. The visitor, seeming nothing
to regard his looks, strode across the hall with
firm but light steps, till he stood right opposite
the abbot. He was a man apparently of middle
age, formed like a Hercules, and with a strongly
marked, but not unpleasant physiognomy.
Yet, though the general contour of his features
was good, and such as a shallow and hasty
observer would have deemed handsome, there
were lines of cunning and ferocity in his countenance,
and a hard brow, and a sneering lip,
and a look of defiance, with a forced gleam of
insolent jocularity playing over it, that bespoke

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

a character at war with itself, where, though
the worse struggled potently with the better
part, and was ultimately sure of the victory,
yet still the better was not wholly subdued,
nor as yet inactive.</p>

<p>His dress was as singular as his figure; his
tunic and hose were of the woollen cloth worn
by peasants (probably adopted for disguise);
over his broad shoulders was spread a cloak
of wolf-skin; a cap of the same material was
on his head, and in its front uncouthly sparkled
a gem of price; his feet were covered with
strong buskins, plaited with leathern straps.
But what appeared to strike most the abbot's
eye, was the richly-jewelled dagger that was
stuck in his coarse belt; the spear, too, in his
hand, which gleamed brightly in the reflected
glow of the dying embers, had a certain share
of the dignitary's uneasy attention. Such was
the figure who now confronted the abbot of
Normoutier, and who seated himself, sans invitation,
on the first bench that offered itself.</p>

<p>The lord abbot clasped and unclasped his
hands, rich with many a ring, poised himself

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

in his chair, and then, with looks averted, demanded&mdash;"Now,
thou naughty knave, as I
before demanded when the arrival of the crusaders
interrupted us, whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>"From the rat-hole where I hid me till the
visit was overpast&mdash;marry, let me taste a cup
of wine to wash down the cobwebs I swallowed
there, and their musty recollection that is even
now rising in my throat." And as he spoke,
he knocked off the head of a flagon of wine
with his dagger-hilt, and drained its contents
at a draught.</p>

<p>"A truce with thy tricks of foolish wit,"
said the abbot doggedly, "and answer me
roundly whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>"From my palace, dormitory, and fortalice
of L'Aigle sur la Roche," said the outlaw, for
such he was.</p>

<p>"I deemed no better," said the abbot sullenly;
"it were a rare sight to see thee come
full-handed from the plunder of a castle (I
mean a hamlet) of the heretics, or the disburthening
of a band of pilgrims richly gifted,
or of merchants wealthily laden travelling

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

towards some town of mart, as Nismes or
Beaucaire; marry, the heretics have left
nought to be plundered in Toulouse&mdash;and
for Beziers, it is as empty as&mdash;thy purse,
I trow. And what may be thy errand here
at this time, fellow?"</p>

<p>"To win absolution for all sins for the time
forepast, and indulgence for those that may be
committed for forty days to come," quoth the
outlaw. "You wot well that the season for
adventures is approaching; autumn hath set
in sharp and early; but my knaves will not
break up the capon till the lord abbot hath
said grace. Marry, if you could strain courtesy,
and stretch the indulgence to twice that period,
we should be much your debtors."</p>

<p>"Debtors!" rejoined the abbot&mdash;"ay,
and our debtors ye would remain till doomsday.
Hear ye me, sir outlaw, sir robber!&mdash;thou
hast exhausted the exchequer of the
church; thou hast drawn upon her indulgence
till there remains not enough to save a soul of
thine excommunicated fraternity from purgatory,
far less from another place you wot of;

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

thou ever comest craving for indulgence when
the saints have not one to spare&mdash;and worse,
thou bringest nothing to purchase it with.
Where be the silver lamps for the shrines, the
plate for the altar, the rich robes for the saints?&mdash;where
be all that thou hast promised for years,
and lacking which our abbey shows like the cell
of an eremite, or a chapel hewed by miners out
of the bare rock?&mdash;An' I am not ashamed to
say mass in our church before the crusaders
to-morrow, I am no mitred abbot."</p>

<p>The outlaw muttered something about hard
and perilous times, and about the country
being overspread by the crusading armies, or
by bands of the Albigeois, who were as poor
as mendicants, and ended by urging his former
petition for indulgence.</p>

<p>"Indulgence me no indulgences," quoth the
abbot, "but come roundly to the matter in
hand. What hast thou to offer for the boon
thou seekest of the church?&mdash;Hast thou not
had absolution already for rapine, murder, and
conflagration, beyond all modest count and
computation?&mdash;Did I not annul for thy sake

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

the 'truce of God,' solemnly kept by the
boldest barons and deadliest foes in France,
and give thee license to prede and burn in
the weeks of Advent?&mdash;Have I even spared
Lent for thy sake?"</p>

<p>"Thou hadst the plunder of two castles for
it," muttered the outlaw.</p>

<p>"Nay, did I not," continued the abbot,
who seemed not to hear him&mdash;"Did I not,
overpassing all thine other enormities, connive
at thy devouring a haunch of red-deer on
Good Friday, the most abominable of all thy
transgressions?"</p>

<p>"Your refectory board, lord abbot," quoth
the offender, "smoked with the pasty of that
very deer three days following."</p>

<p>"Tell not me&mdash;talk not to me," said the
abbot wrathfully&mdash;"my conscience can bear
the burthen no longer."</p>

<p>"Nor can my conscience any longer bear
the burthen of your impositions," cried the incensed
outlaw, striking his iron-nerved hand on
the table with a force that made its planks start
asunder. "For forepast transgressions I am

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

but lightly thy debtor, I trow; and for what
I seek, if the band of L'Aigle sur la Roche
lack indulgence, let the abbot of Normoutier
look how his board be spread, and his cellars
stored, when he next holds a feast for prelates
and crusaders."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest the way to win me," said
the abbot; "or, as a certain father hath it,
<i>cedant arma tog&aelig;</i>&mdash;But, God-a-mercy, wilt
thou drink all the wine, and devour the remnants
of the feast alone?&mdash;methinks I am sore
athirst, and could never handle these texts
with dry lips."</p>

<p>The outlaw, who had been eating and drinking
sans intermission, knocking off the heads
of the bottles with the handle of his dagger,
and helping himself furiously with its point to
the scattered viands, placed a flagon beside
his host.</p>

<p>"Thou wast muttering something about indulgence
for thy lawless band," said the abbot,
sinking into a solemn and pacific tone as he
drained the flagon to its last drop&mdash;"hadst
thou not better seek it first for thyself?" Then

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

fixing his light but keen eyes, on the outlaw:
"Deemest thou the bells of Normoutier have
deafened me to the hearing of all other sound?
Where be the two hundred bezants thou robbedst
the Jew of under the walls of Nismes
within this week?"</p>

<p>"Sir abbot," quoth the; outlaw, "in robbing
a Jew I deemed I was doing service to holy
church, and needed not to trouble the saints
for their merits to pay the price of mine
own."</p>

<p>"And was it also doing the church service
when thou plunderedst a company of merchants,
who were travelling with jewels of
price from Italy for the princess Alice, and
such they were as might enrich for life the
man who won them?"</p>

<p>"We deemed such gear too heavy for
rascal burghers, and too light for churchmen,"
said the dauntless robber, "and so
we kept them for ourselves&mdash;all but this
gem;" and he took it from his cap. "And
now I pray, lord abbot, let not the saint
look dim longer, unless some fair leman of

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

thine wills to outshine him, and wear it in
her carkanet next confession-day."</p>

<p>The abbot's passion here rose beyond all
bounds; but he had one to contend with
whose voice was as loud, whose passions
were as fierce, and whose plea was perhaps
the stronger.</p>

<p>"Curb thee, lord abbot," he cried; "for
the matter in debate we peril life and limb,
and our souls beside, if all thou sayest be
true; and what receive we from thee but
empty promises of absolution, (and I know not
what,) that a century hence, if these heretics
thrive, would not cheat a child?&mdash;Wottest
thou, sir abbot, I came hither to crave pardon
for myself?&mdash;I hold thy benison at a liard's
value, and thine excommunication at a liard's
loss. But I have scrupulous knaves to deal
with, who must needs make the sign of the
cross ere they whet their brands, and would
fain dip in holy water before they dip in
blood."</p>

<p>"Why, there it is," said the abbot, cooling
as his antagonist warmed&mdash;"no man can

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

speak to thee for thy good, but straight thou
art&mdash;I know not how; thou and thy band
shall have the indulgence thou seekest&mdash;on
conditions well observed&mdash;a score of heretics
slaughtered&mdash;or&mdash;we will not stand for a
trifle. The doughty knight, Sir Samson, won
his bride with a hundred scalps of the Philistine
chivalry, and shall the church be less
easily won for a bride?"</p>

<p>"I have paid that dowry too often already,"
said the outlaw doggedly.</p>

<p>A long pause followed; and the outlaw,
very slowly, and with more appearance of
feeling than he had hitherto betrayed, said
in a subdued voice&mdash;"Father&mdash;I remember,
though I was but a youth&mdash;and would" (he
sighed) "I had never been man!&mdash;I remember
the dreadful fate that befell that noble
unhappy lady, Marie de Mortemar."</p>

<p>"She was a heretic, and accursed," said
the abbot.</p>

<p>"And accursed were they who did the
deed," added the robber.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

<p>"How, thou unreverend knave," cried the
abbot, "knowest thou of whom thou speakest?"</p>

<p>"I know them well," said the outlaw;
"they were the bishop thy guest&mdash;the deceased
brother of the Lord of Courtenaye&mdash;and
Count Raymond of Toulouse, then a persecutor,
but now a fautor of these same heretics;
and this I say, that three more ruthless
lords never banded together to work their will
if it might be, or to wreak vengeance if it
might not. But all is over now&mdash;it was a sad
and fearful deed&mdash;wild tales are told still that
she is alive&mdash;Holy Mary sain me from such
encounter!&mdash;and that the Lord of Courtenaye
less dreads the power of the heretics, than the
prophecy uttered in her madness, that the
<i>fiery arrow</i> should one day level the usurped
towers of Courtenaye with the dust."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the abbot dozed, <i>vino gravatus</i>,
but waked now and then with a startled
exclamation, that showed him not unconscious
of the subject.</p>

<p>"Wake, lord abbot," cried the outlaw,

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

"and pledge me to the success of my next
petition."</p>

<p>"Thy next petition?" said the abbot,
rousing himself,&mdash;"what wouldst thou have?
Art thou not already excommunicated?&mdash;absolved,
I would say. Petition me no more&mdash;I
will not be petitioned&mdash;I swear I will hear
no petitions&mdash;my head will no longer bear
them.&mdash;And now that I have thought better
of thy petition (and will by no means listen
to or grant it), let me hear it, and briefly&mdash;Fie,
where the devil is this foolish bottle?"</p>

<p>"Even in thy hand, sir abbot.&mdash;As for my
petition," continued the dauntless visitor, "I
must needs accompany you on your purposed
visit to the castle of Courtenaye; for there I
know you will bear the crusaders company,
and thither I must follow in your train."</p>

<p>At these words the abbot threw himself back
in his chair, in an agony of consternation unfeigned.
"Save me&mdash;sain me&mdash;uphold me,"
he cried; but as not a saint came to aid, and
his companion gave no help, or testified even
the least sympathy, the abbot contrived to

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

recover within a reasonable space; but with
his faculties, his passions and his voice returned
also. "What, art thou there still,
thou <i>petrum scandali</i>, thou <i>catharma</i>, or all
else vile that I may call thee?" he cried;&mdash;"thou,
an excommunicated outlaw, thou ride
with godly churchmen and valiant crusaders?&mdash;thou&mdash;what
goad but that of the fiend
spurs thee on to such pursuit?&mdash;Speak, what
motive canst thou urge, external, internal, or
infernal?"</p>

<p>"Only," said the outlaw, coolly and daringly
repeating the words of the bishop of Toulouse,
"to behold the fair beauty of the Lady
Isabelle, and to visit that enskied goddess&mdash;Nay,
never cross or sain your breast, lord
abbot&mdash;of your train I will be, in your van
I will ride. I will disguise me so that she
who bore me would not know&mdash;Alas!" (he
groaned) "may <i>she</i> never know me!&mdash;I shall
be your guide," he added, recovering himself,
"through this wild country, and lead you
through paths you wot not of to the castle of
Courtenaye; this wolf-skin, with other guisements

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

I have, would bear me unknown through
mine own band.&mdash;By Heaven, he sleeps!&mdash;rouse
thee, lord abbot!"</p>

<p>"Where is the bottle?" said his host, scarcely
waking.</p>

<p>"In thine hand, I told thee, and still unemptied;
where be thine eyes, lord abbot?"</p>

<p>"Well nigh blinded with tears for the enormities
of a sinful age," quoth the abbot with a
maudlin whimper, attempting, however, to lift
the bottle.</p>

<p>At that moment a sound was heard that
made the abbot relinquish his hold, and the
bold outlaw start from his seat: it was that of
the tremendous war-horn, well known in those
days, whose blast seemed to shake the massive
building from spire to foundation. It was instantly
followed by loud knocks on the outer
gate, evidently struck by a lance-head, or some
stouter implement; wielded by no weak hand.</p>

<p>"Curse of Heaven!" cried the abbot, sinking
on the floor, "the Albigeois are on us, and
we are utterly spoiled; and"&mdash;lifting the cup
he had dropped&mdash;"and behold, the precious

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

liquor spilled!&mdash;Fie on the water-drinking
knaves, they never deem how thirsty our
prayers for their soul-safety may render
churchmen."</p>

<p>"Fie on thee, sir abbot," said the more
manly outlaw; "is this a time"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wisest of men hath said there
is a time for all things," quoth the abbot;
"and for me, I hold this a fitting time for
retreat; lo, I will ensconce me behind the
tapestry of this chair&mdash;and, dost thou hear?&mdash;should
the heretics force their way, remember
I am a mitred abbot, and my life may be loss
incomputable;&mdash;whereas thou, being an ostensible
sinner, and most notorious layman"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"As thou puttest it," said the outlaw, "my
life is a lighter loss to the church than thine
own."</p>

<p>"It is no time for controversy," cried the
abbot&mdash;"the heretics come; make good the
pass, I charge thee, with thy life."</p>

<p>Another blast of the horn was wound; the
outlaw stood in consternation; and the bare-footed
porter, stumbling after the revels of the

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

night, unbarred the gate, and a messenger
(whose horse fell dead as he lit, and who was
girthed from hip to shoulder,) rushed into the
refectory, exclaiming, "Missives, missives,
lord abbot, from the Lord of Courtenaye. His
castle is beleaguered by the heretics; and he
deems all fautors of that heresy who do not
hasten to his aid."</p>

<p>The outlaw kept back, and a pause followed,
till the abbot crept from behind his
chair. "The monks of Normoutier are sluggards
at early mass," he said, "or thou hadst
never caught me watching them thus, to oversee
the discipline of the house more strictly
observed."</p>

<p>"Lord abbot," cried the breathless messenger,
"the Lord of Courtenaye commends
him to you, and bids you haste to his rescue.
He is avertised that many a crusading lord
and knight is couched within the walls of
your abbey to-night; and he bids me say,
they had fitter ride to his rescue than snore
vigils to St. Somnus in the cells of a monk.
Whether there be such a saint in the calendar,
my lord abbot knows better than I."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

<p>"Away&mdash;away!" cried the abbot, fully
awakened from his drunken sleep, and trembling
lest the heretics should remember how
near the towers of Normoutier were to those
of Courtenaye&mdash;"Sound thine horn again till
it make cloister and cell ring&mdash;sound it, as if
it would split the ear, and waken the dead.
The Lord of Courtenaye in danger&mdash;in mortal
danger?"</p>

<p>"The Lady Isabelle in peril?" cried the
outlaw, brandishing his dagger and spear&mdash;"perchance
she may see as daring deed done
for her safety by an outlaw as by a belted
knight."</p>

<p>"Wind thine horn, I say&mdash;toll out the great
bell," cried the abbot in a fever of terror.</p>

<p>He was obeyed; and at the toll of the
ponderous bell, and the winding of the horn,
whose sound, confined within the walls of the
refectory, seemed to split its very roof, the
sleepers started up, like men roused by the
trump of doom.</p>

<p>Life was then full of such stirring scenes,
and no man lay down with the certainty of an
hour's rest, if the sound of war was in the

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

neighbourhood. Up started the thousand guests
of the abbey at the summons. The Pelerins,
who lay on the stone pavement of the court,
or were dispersed through the various offices of
the abbey, were the first to spring from their
slumber and seize their arms; a few torches
burned dimly in the courts to light them;
then followed fast the glancing lights seen
through the narrow windows of the galleries,
as the men-at-arms and the bishop's followers
hurried from their dormitories, lit by the
monks. The bishop of Toulouse was in the
court at the first summons, casting, as he
mounted his steed, a look of reproach on
his laggard attendants. The flaring torches,
lit in haste at the presence of the bishop, were
now blazing through the court, held by the
brotherhood, who dreamed as they stood;
and the court itself rung like the streets of
a town besieged. The surly waking of the
troops&mdash;the tumult of oaths, orders, and exclamations&mdash;the
hurried and hasty confronting
of men belonging to various leaders&mdash;formed
a scene of discord and of din, amid which the

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

bishop of Toulouse's voice alone could have
commanded attention, or enforced control. The
men-at-arms were summoned to their respective
standards&mdash;the promiscuous band required to
keep in the rear, and a kind of disorderly order
established; while the abbot himself was seen
to join the train, mounted on a pacing palfrey,
and attended by a muffled figure in a dress
which partook of that of a hunter and a
peasant, to whom he whispered, ever and
anon, "Be true, thou false knave, for thine
own sake."</p>

<p>"And who is this companion?" said the
bishop, as he rode by.</p>

<p>"A rustical fellow, but useful withal," replied
the abbot; "he knows the perplexed
paths of this wild country, and will track your
heretic sure as a bloodhound. Alack, my
lord, your sleep, I fear, hath been broken;
for me, a few pages of St. Chrysostom or
St. Jerome in my cell, and I sleep as I would
after a vigil or at a mystery&mdash;<i>eripiunt somnum
Druso vitulisque marinis</i>."</p>

<p>At this moment the great gate was once

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

more flung open; its vast arches again rung
with the din of steeds, arms, and men; the
torch-light that flashed on its ribbed vaults of
stone was contrasted with the pale light of an
autumnal morning; and out rushed leader and
vassal, "the horse and his rider," like a flood,
through the gates (that quivered on their
massive hinges with the impulse), and poured
themselves tumultuously over the heath that
surrounded the spacious walls of the abbey.</p>

<p>"To him," cried Paladour, couching his
lance, "who arrives but a spear's length before
me at the castle of Courtenaye, I will forfeit,
if he be a knight, my steed of price; and if
a man-at-arms, my glove of mail filled with
agnels."</p>

<p>"To him," cried Amirald, spurring his
steed to the rowel-head&mdash;"to him who attains
a spear's length after me, I will forfeit, if
a knight, my helm and corslet, and if a vassal,
its value summed and paid"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My holy lord," cried Sir Aymer, who saw
the bishop's armed heel pointed towards his
steed's flank at these words, "I pray you, use

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

your discretion&mdash;let these mad boys run a tilt
for the love of their lady Luna, and shiver
lances in the clouds, an' they list; but leave
thou such fierce fooleries to us youth, I pray."</p>

<p>"Most reverend youth, I stand checked,"
said the bishop, smiling, "But believest thou
this tale of the peril in which the towers of
Courtenaye stand from a handful of unarmed
and wretched peasants?"</p>

<p>"If Raymond of Toulouse be in France, as
true men have reported," answered the old
knight, "there is no saying what enterprise he
will not dare, sith all hope of his reconciliation
with the church ends with his return."</p>

<p>"<i>Dieu et l'Eglise</i> be the word then," quoth
the bishop, shouting the war-cry of the crusaders.</p>

<p>It was repeated by the voices of armed
hundreds, breaking the morning mists that
hung round their path, and the progress began&mdash;Sir
Paladour and Sir Amirald still heading
the van&mdash;Sir Aymer now jesting with the
Pelerins, and now repeating with hoarse and
quavering voice the ditty of some minstrel&mdash;and

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

the abbot, sore fatigued with his journey,
and trembling for his doubtful and dangerous
companion, who, however, faithfully discharged
his office as guide.</p>

<p>It was twilight when they caught the first
sight of the stately towers of Courtenaye and
Beaurevoir; but, from the summits of the hills
by which they were surrounded, a band of the
Albigenses, pouring down in increasing numbers,
seemed preparing, however desperate the
effort, to dispute or to delay the advance of
the crusaders.</p>

<br/>

<p>WE have to transport our readers to a very
different scene, and represent to them the
actual state of that persecuted people, at the
sound of whose name prelates, nobles, and
knights had started to arms.</p>

<p>The Albigeois were then very generally
diffused throughout Languedoc; but, scattered
and depressed by persecution, by the death
(supposed violent) of the Count of Beziers,
and by the frequent absence and vacillating
character of Raymond of Toulouse, they in
general affected conformity to the church of
Rome, or at least conducted themselves so as
to escape dangerous notoriety. The few who

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

still held the reformed faith were dispersed
among the mountains of Languedoc, awaiting
their destiny amid suffering and privation, sometimes
expecting aid from the Count of Toulouse,
and sometimes refuge from the King of
Arragon. Their numbers diminishing as their
hopes declined, some rushed desperately forward
to find shelter or death amid friends or
foes; and of this number was the band to
which we have now to introduce the reader,
who, though a small and inconsiderable company,
may possibly serve as a specimen of the
rest, like Sterne's single captive, shut up in his
dungeon. The band of the Albigeois, then,
who were said to menace the towers of
Courtenaye, were the remains of those who
had effected their miraculous subterranean
escape from Carcassonne. Their harbour
since had been the mountains; and from
the mountains they now rushed to force their
way, or perish. The rigour of their creed
had not been at all softened by their mountain
habits; they also boasted of having among

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

them the most powerful of their preachers,
and the most dauntless of their unarmed
warriors; and, in this last attempt, to skill
they opposed ferocity, and even to victory,
despair.</p>

<p>All their best and bravest had been dispatched
the preceding day as an advanced
guard, not to molest or oppose the crusaders,
but, if possible, to win their way to Arragon;
and on the following evening a band of wretched
enfeebled beings, old men and maidens, mothers
and infants, were descending in slow and sad
march from their mountain fastnesses&mdash;from
"caves and holes, and dens of the rock,"
where they had lingered in vain hope of being
permitted by their persecutors to reach their
land of promise, the territories of the King of
Arragon.</p>

<p>The stoutest of their band were (as we have
said) on the advance, furnished with what
arms they could obtain (chiefly clubs and
arrows), to ascertain or secure the safety of
those who followed. The central body consisted

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

chiefly of their <i>barbes</i>, or pastors, with
their wives and children; behind them the
mingled and mournful band of the Albigeois.
The women had wrapped their children in their
scanty mantles; the men sought food for them
where they could, and, failing in the search,
had nothing to present but wild chesnuts and
roots, and the stalks of the wild vine to roast
them by when fire could be obtained;&mdash;still,
however, as they boasted in language they were
fond of borrowing, "there was no complaining
heard in their streets." If a famished infant
died, the mother laid it on her exhausted bosom,
and lay down to perish with it, as if she had
been hushing her infant to slumber:&mdash;if a
man fell, his wife spread her garment over
him; and to those who passed and spoke, she
shook her head, as if his slumber was not to
be broken (that slumber she was resolved to
share with him). But still, amid these dreadful
scenes, there was a strong excitement kept
up amid this spiritual army, where leader and
preacher were synonymous terms; and the

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

advancing host uttered a shout, that was echoed
from the hearts, if not from the voices, of the
feeblest that followed. The audible prayer of
thousands, issuing from rock and glen every
morning,&mdash;their solemn hymn, resounding every
evening from cliff to cliff, where no other sounds
were heard, save the scream of the vulture, or
the sweep of the blast,&mdash;the midnight murmur
of the distant prayer of fathers, husbands, and
sons, mingled with and sounding like the
stream that roared from the hills, or rushed
through the rocky gorges of the mountains,&mdash;gave
comfort, if not hope, to those who heard
them, and suggested to them images of undying
patience and eternal hope. The very
children leaned over the crags to catch the
echoes; and when they ceased, the elders or
barbes hoped, from the pause, that their
brethren "had found the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land," and turned with sickened
hearts and shrinking hands to bestow
what remained of sustenance and support on
the dying, the wearied, and the weak.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

<p>Such had been their progress; but now,
deserted by their bravest and boldest, the
evening darkening round them without tidings,
and almost without hope, and a wild and
hostile country before them, its termination
presented a prospect dreary enough to wither
the most patient hearts; and as they wound
with painful and way-worn steps their path
down a rude declivity, grasping at shrubs and
tufts of sun-burnt grass for their support, many
a prayer for release from unutterable misery
was breathed by hearts that suppressed the
unuttered feeling, and trembled lest it might
be guessed by their companion, while they felt
that companion echoed it from the bottom of
his own. Of these men it is difficult to speak;
history has told but little of them; and their
characters, alike exaggerated by friends and
foes, has left "the middle way," if the safest
way, the very hardest to take. It is, however,
admitted, that their manners were pure, their
discipline strict, and their creed evangelical.
It is also a curious, but indisputable matter of

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

fact, that the majority of them were as tenacious
of certain texts and terms of the Old
Testament, as their legitimate descendants, the
English Puritans, were some centuries later;
and that, like them, they assumed Jewish
names, fought with Jewish obduracy, and felt
with Jewish hostility, even towards those of
their community who differed from them in a
penumbra of their creed, whom they termed,
in the phraseology they loved, the half-tribe of
Manasseh, the spies that brought evil report
of the land, the offerers of unholy incense,
whom the earth would swallow up like Nadab
and Abihu; with various other vituperative
comparisons, with which memory or malice
furnished them from <i>that law</i>, which He who
came to "fulfil every tittle and jot of, <i>hath</i>
fulfilled and nailed to his cross, bearing away
the <i>law of ordinances</i>." Such were the differences
which prevailed even among these
scriptural and conscientious men, who had in
a good and honest heart received the word,
but among whom it brought forth according

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

to the nature of the soil; not forbidding the
hope, that even where it was most divergent
and eccentric, it might bring forth fruit to life
everlasting.</p>

<p>By a singular coincidence, at the same
moment that the armed and splendid array
of the crusaders were approaching the castle
of Courtenaye, the central band of the Albigeois
were descending from the rock into a
valley, where they hoped to find shelter for
the night. The moon at that moment bursting
forth, shed a light on their path, and
revealed the valley, or rather deep gorge,
into which they wound, with its masses of
grey stone, that had fallen from the precipices
above, and obstructed the fractured bed of
the stream that struggled through it; its caves,
whose shadows, sinking far into their rocky
hollows, no light could penetrate; and the
silvery-tinted crags of its peaked fantastic
summits, on which the scanty foliage of many
an autumnal spray still smiled in the moonlight,
and waved to the breeze.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

<p>The sight was lovely, but not to the eyes
that now beheld it; nor is there a more
withering effect of habitual wretchedness than
that which deprives us of our sensibility of
nature, and makes us look on all that is wild
and grand in her forms and operations, as
enemies with whose hostilities we must struggle,
or masters to whose stern power we must submit.
The foremost of the group consisted of
an aged pastor, named Pierre, whom the cruelty
of De Montfort had deprived of sight, and who
was led by a young female, his grand-daughter&mdash;another
who had taken to himself the appellation
of Boanerges, an assumption well justified,
by the thunder of his eloquence and the extraordinary
powers of his voice, which were said
to be so great as even to have split rocks, and
brought down their fragments on the congregation
assembled beneath them;&mdash;a phenomenon
that will scarce appear miraculous to
those who know that amid the Alpine heights,
the slightest sounds will often cause the most
alarming concussions of the air, and that travellers

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

are even obliged to tie up the bells of
their mules, lest the reverberation should bring
down an avalanche on their heads.</p>

<p>With these came the deacon Mephibosheth
(the only office beside that of pastor recognized
in the church of the Albigeois), a man of low
stature, forbidding features, intolerant zeal,
and intolerable pretensions. Lame from his
birth, he had adopted the name of the son
of Jonathan; and after (with infinite difficulty)
having slid, stumbled, or scrambled down the
declivity, he contrived to join the party at the
entrance of a cavern that seemed to promise
them shelter for the night. Before its entrance,
which was shaded with pine and larch, and
mantled over with shoots of the wild vine,
genistum, and clematis, stood for a moment
the pastor Pierre, turning his sightless sockets
towards heaven. He could no longer see the
light, but he could feel that partial warmth of
light, of which the blind are peculiarly susceptible,
and he removed his hoary and streaming
hair from his forehead as if to bask in it.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

Beside him, and still supporting him, stood
the slender form of his daughter, her white
unsandaled feet bleeding from her painful path,
the hood of her coarse mantle thrown back to
watch the moonlight as it played on her grandfather's
face, and her dark redundant hair,
escaped from confinement, almost reaching
her feet as she stood.</p>

<p>The face, thus transiently disclosed, had
the character of the light that revealed it,
pure, pale, and heavenly;&mdash;the dark, thoughtful
eye,&mdash;the nobly arched, but mild and patient
brow,&mdash;the smile of the pale resolved lip,
announced that mixture of strength and purity
that is never to be found but in woman. The
pastor felt from the pressure of his daughter's
arm that he was near a place of rest; and
another touch, still softer, made him feel (for
those deprived of sight are often repaid with an
exquisite sensibility in their remaining organs)
that Genevieve was gazing on the moon, and
tasting the calm and holy glory of her effulgence,
"I feel what thou seest, my daughter,"

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

said Pierre, pressing her arm closer to his;
but Genevieve at that moment felt him tottering
from feebleness, and hasted to lead him
into the cavern. Where a crowd presses
together for ease or shelter, the wives whom
husbands support, or the children whom their
mothers bear, seldom are the slowest, and an
aged man, led by a slender timid girl, is often
the last; so it fared with Pierre and his
daughter.</p>

<p>"Let me pass, I pray," said the deacon
Mephibosheth, hastening past them; "I see
the sisters and brethren are preparing for the
supply of our failing bodies. Wot ye not
mine office?&mdash;It is meet that the deacons
should serve tables, for thereunto were we
elected from times apostolical." And he
pressed on.</p>

<p>Meantime the band had gathered some
vine-stalks, and cut some peat, to which they
quickly set fire; and a vivid blaze, contrasted
by the darkness of the cavern, began to glare
on their pale and cheerless visages. Genevieve

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

placed Pierre as near as she could to
the heat, chafing his numbed bands, till,
warmed by the action herself, she retired to
make room for others. All this while the
deacon, exclaiming, "I am faint for lack of
food," went about inspecting the stinted provisions
that the harassed group displayed for
the refreshment of their aged, their sick, and
their infants, selecting from each whatever
might satiate or soothe an appetite that, like
that of the horse-leech, seemed ever to cry,
"Give, give."</p>

<p>"And thou too art faint for lack of food,"
said Genevieve, bending sadly over the pale
and uncomplaining face of the old man as
she supported his head on her knees, while his
aged limbs were extended on the rocky floor
of the cavern. "My father," she whispered,
"would that your bed were softer!"</p>

<p>"My daughter," murmured the pastor, "my
couch is softer than that which, pillowed the
patriarch when journeying to Padan-aram he
placed a stone beneath his head, even in the

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

field of Luz, and that night saw a vision of
angels, such as may visit <i>my</i> dreams, and I
also find this flinty bed the gate to heaven&mdash;or
that, in Egypt, where the holy Joseph slept
in the dungeon of Pharaoh, the spirits of the
pure watching him&mdash;or that in Susa, the
ancient seat of the Persic king, where the
highly favoured Daniel couched with lions on
the stony floor of their den. Even in our
dreary wanderings to-day, what thoughts, what
themes, have come rushing on me like floods
of inward light, till my mental eye, like my
bodily, seemed exhausted and seared! But,"
and he checked himself, "feelest thou no
hunger, my child?"&mdash;and he pressed her hand,
as if he would feel, from its faint damp touch,
the answer her lips would not give.</p>

<p>"I too have had visions, my father," said
Genevieve, with a kind of ghastly sportfulness.
"When I hungered, I thought of the brook
Cherith, where the prophet Elijah was fed
morn and evening by ravens: or of that
palace where the holy Daniel lived on pulse,

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

and was nurtured even as if fed at the royal
table."</p>

<p>"My daughter," cried Pierre, grasping her
hands more earnestly, "seek not to visions or
dreams&mdash;they are the glory and the joy of the
sightless. Holy visions and images, unembodied
and unspeakable, sometimes float before
me; and God thus supplies the loss of those
organs of which cruel men deprived me: but
to thee all the grandeur of the broad heaven,
all the brightness of the green earth, are still
open. Oh! if I could once more behold
creation&mdash;could I want a motive to adore
creation's God&mdash;&mdash;. But I err," he added,
declining his head on Genevieve's knees as
he spoke, while she spread her cool and
fragrant fingers, like the petals of a flower,
over lids that, though sightless, were burning
to the touch from fatigue and excitement; and
silently declining, as she sat, the offers of their
scanty refreshment from the rest, lest the
pastor's rest should be disturbed, sat with her
eyes fixed on the entrance of the cavern, where

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

the full-risen glory of the moon shone, turning
every crag she gleamed on to silver, and tinting
the very weeds that crept around them
with the hue of a pale emerald.</p>

<p>She gazed on the sight till her vision
seemed to fail, and the sleep that felt deeply
on her was but a continuation of its glories.
The character of her dreams was soon exchanged
for that which, from infancy, had
haunted her scared and broken sleep.</p>

<p>There was a youth, named Amand, in the
advanced party that day, whom not even the
life of peril and privation they mutually had
lived from childhood, had prevented from
expressing towards her feelings which at first
she understood not, and when she was at
length compelled to do so, could not return.</p>

<p>His fate seemed to weigh heavy on her
spirit in dreams that night. She had seen
him go forth that day to certain danger, perhaps
to certain death,&mdash;she had seen his
mother weep, though <i>she</i> wept not; and the
coldness of her last farewell reproached her in

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

her last waking moments, and haunted her in
her visions like a crime.</p>

<p>Perhaps indifference towards those who love
us truly, fondly, and worthily, that insolvency
of the heart towards a generous creditor, is the
pang that tries its chords most deeply. The
figure of Amand, pale, his garments dripping
blood, seemed to stand before the entrance of
the cavern; the moonlight was still there, for
she had slept so recently that the images of
reality still were mixed with those of her
dream. The figure seemed to point to a dim
perspective of confused slaughter, as if announcing
the fate of her friends. Genevieve
tossed and moaned on her bed of flint; suddenly
the same figure appeared, but the image
was so vivid, the action so distinct, and the
scene so real, that Genevieve, though asleep,
felt as if it was no longer a dream,&mdash;she
screamed aloud&mdash;her scream seemed echoed
and prolonged by a wild and piercing cry,
that rung through the cavern, as thoroughly
awake, she started up, and gazing round

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

her, beheld the worst bodings of her dream
verified.</p>

<p>The scene was like many that she had witnessed,
but exceeding all in horror and grief.
The party who had dared to meet the crusaders
had suffered for their temerity; few survived,
and those few were scarce enough to announce
their utter discomfiture, and to tell that
those who might follow were scarce enough to
bear away the bodies of the dead. The group
of wounded, defeated, hopeless men, darkened
the centre of the cavern; around them, vividly,
and even hideously pictured out by the light,
hung the asking forms and eyes of mothers,
wives, and daughters; and their looks were
accompanied, not by words, but by cries so
terrible, that Genevieve, long accustomed to
sounds of woe and horror, closed her ears for
a moment. The men stood sullen and discomfited,
as all men after a defeat, even in
the eyes of those who know victory is impossible;
shrouding themselves in the darkness of
the cavern, and answered in sullen reluctant

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

tones,&mdash;"We are but the first of the messengers
of Job's desolation; those that follow will
bear tidings less welcome." Boanerges, who
never till then lifted his eyes from a manuscript
copy of the New Testament, (then of an immense
price,) which he had obtained by chance
in the plunder of a monastery, closed the volume,
and uttered, in his tremendous voice, the
words,&mdash;"Mourn not as those who have no
hope:" while deacon Mephibosheth, starting
from his sleep, muttered something from the
Song of Solomon, "of fear in the night." Almost
as they spoke, another band poured into
the cavern; they were led by Mattathias, a
ferocious warrior and eloquent preacher, who
had stoutly, but vainly, opposed that day the
clubs and arrows of his band to the lances
and swords of the crusaders; and, defeated as
he and his desperate followers were, they had
succeeded, by dint of surpassing courage,
strength, and perseverance, in bearing away
the dead bodies of their companions.</p>

<p>There was an instant and awful silence in

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

the cavern. The women knelt on the earth
to recognize the defaced bodies of fathers,
husbands, and sons; but when they had done
so&mdash;the shriek and the agony, the hope and
the fear, were over&mdash;all were dumb as the
dead beside whom they knelt.</p>

<p>They wept, but their tears felt to the weepers
themselves like ice; a dreadful certainty congealed
every heart and chained every tongue&mdash;no
one inquired, for the object for whom her
heart trembled lay before her.</p>

<p>Amid the prostrate band, dumb with feeling
too profound and bitter for utterance, the figure
of Mattathias stood sternly erect, streaming with
blood, and silent as the dead around him;&mdash;leaning
on his heavy club, which had been
wielded not in vain that day; but those
who knew him (and Genevieve was one)
dreaded when that silence would end:&mdash;it
ended at length. "The Lord hath forsaken
us," said the fierce warrior and intolerant
zealot,&mdash;"and wherefore? because we have
not kept our vow,&mdash;the vow we vowed on the

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

spoiling of Beziers&mdash;on the escape from Carcassonne&mdash;over
the bodies of these saints
who sleep let us renew it&mdash;and keep it, as I
have kept it with arm and heart to-day,&mdash;from
henceforth be our persecutors accursed,
body and soul, life and limb; accursed be
those who help or pity them&mdash;those who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou forgettest," whispered the deacon
Mephibosheth, "the fat things of the earth,
all that grazes the field, or traverses the wood,
especially their venison and their kid."</p>

<p>"All that appertains to them," said Boanerges,
closing the Bible, and exalting his awful
voice,&mdash;"horn and hoof, vassal and menial,
from the serf who eats their bread in fear, to
the waiting-damsel chambered in luxury."</p>

<p>"Thou hast spoken wisely," said the deacon,
adopting the strong Hebraic metaphor, "but
not warmly&mdash;not to the <i>hearts</i> of the brethren.
I say, moreover, that, though prelate, peer,
and knight, be banded against us; though
Amalek be joined with them, and they are
upholden by the children of Lot; yet they

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

shall be as the daughter of Babylon, wasted
with misery, and blessed shall they be who
rewardeth her as she hath served us."</p>

<p>The sharp vociferation of the deacon roused
the pastor from his slumber, and, feeble and
starting, he exclaimed,&mdash;"What are they now
saying, my child?" Genevieve tried to hold
him back for a moment, and then whispered,
fearfully, "My father, they are cursing."
"Then let me try to turn their curses into
blessings," said the pastor, rousing his feeble
strength. "Help me, thou," he cried, as staggering
from weakness and blindness, he tried
to rise, and Genevieve endeavoured to support
him.</p>

<p>As they stood among the distracted group,
half of them eager to join in the imprecation,
half of them shuddering at it, but all stung and
sore with recent anguish and menaced evil, they
seemed like spiritual beings, appearing under
those forms that might best soothe or solemnize
the human mind, even in its fiercest
exacerbations of misery and hostility;&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

holy beauty of Genevieve preaching more eloquently
than many sermons to the young men
and maidens, and the withered but awful
figure of him whom she supported, appealing
alike resistlessly to old men and children.</p>

<p>"My brethren," said the aged pastor, extending
his hands, as if to touch the hearts he
invoked but could not reach, "wherefore are
ye gathered together? what rites are these ye
are assembled to celebrate? are they the spells
of sorcery, the bloody ceremonies of Heathenism,
or the prayers of an afflicted and persecuted
church?" All were silent on a sudden
at the voice of this living martyr of the faith.
"Ye are assembled," continued the pastor,
"in the name of your God&mdash;the God who is
love; and for what!&mdash;to curse; the horrid
contradiction thrills through your ears, it thrills
through your hearts. If any sufferer be here,"
be cried, exalting his feeble but piercing voice,
"if any be here who has suffered more than
me, and claims a mournful right to dictate
from the pre-eminence of misery, let him

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

speak." All were silent. "I dare not compare
myself," continued the aged man, "with
him who was in sufferings often, in labours
more abundant, in perils often. I have lost&mdash;,"
his voice was choked, and the tears gushed
from his eyeless sockets and trembled over
his hoary beard, "I dare not now think of
what I have lost; but if poverty and persecution,
if the slaughter of my family (all but this
feeble girl who tries to support me), if blindness,
and the cruel spoiling of my goods,
entitle me to this wretched priority, hear how
I will curse your enemies."</p>

<p>A deep and breathless pause followed his
words; the character of Pierre the pastor
stood high among the congregation, and his
offer to join in this vituperative and maledictory
mode of devotion, that had become, from
their adoption of the Jewish phraseology, too
much the habit of the Albigeois, was so new,
and the excitement caused by it so strong, as
for some time to suspend every other feeling.</p>

<p>Boanerges and the deacon Mephibosheth
(for Mattathias still stood leaning on his bloody

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

club in the rear of the cavern, like some misshapen
and sanguinary idol of ancient superstition,)
hurried forwards, and irreverently and
urgently pressing their hands on the shoulders
of the aged man, exclaimed, "Kneel&mdash;kneel."
He knelt, and the congregation was hushed.
"Bless them, God!" cried Pierre; "bless
them to see the many errors of their ways,
and to grant to thy persecuted people the
permission 'after the way they call heresy to
worship the God of their fathers.' "</p>

<p>At these words, so different from what they
had expected, a murmur deep and loud burst
from the congregation, and Boanerges and the
deacon, incensed and disappointed, threw themselves
among the assembly, (while Mattathias
stood in fierce stillness,) and fed their kindled
spirits by every art of inflammation. The
tumult increased, and the multitude appeared
like the trees of a forest, groaning and tossing
under the power of tempestuous winds. Genevieve
clung to her father, pale with terrors,
which he felt not. "Lead me hence," he
cried, with an energy that made her start;

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

"stand ye there on Mount Ebal to curse&mdash;whilst
I go up to Mount Gerizim to bless&mdash;even
though I go alone."</p>

<p>A few feeble voices, that seemed to dread
their own sound, repeated, "Thou shalt not
go alone;" and as Pierre returned to his retreat,
he was followed by a small band of the
moderate, the timid, and the irresolute,&mdash;those
who were still attached to ancient authority,
and those whose hearts calamity had crushed,
but not embittered;&mdash;by the old, who followed
their pastor because they had followed him for
forty years,&mdash;and by the young, to whom the
beauty of Genevieve seemed, amid darkness
and desolation; to gleam like a light from
heaven.</p>

<p>On the side of Boanerges and his party
remained the sanguinary, the melancholy, the
enthusiastic, and the despairing,&mdash;those whom
a fierce attachment to the cause, or the cruelties
of their enemies, had led to such arts of
atrocity and vengeance, that, feeling reconciliation
hopeless, they laboured to render it
impossible,&mdash;and those who, distinguished by

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

the name of zealous, placed all religion in a
creed of exclusion and a practice of hostility,
and painted heaven to their imaginations and
their hearers as a place whose joys would be
exalted by their consciousness of the interminable
sufferings of their persecutors and
enemies.</p>

<p>Mattathias was called on to address them,
and he prepared; but, after a long pause of
internal conflict, such was the fierce intensity
of his emotions, and so powerful their action
on his gigantic frame, that when he at length
attempted to speak, the blood gushed from his
mouth and nostrils, and he fell prostrate on
the floor of the cave. He was borne away;
Boanerges and the deacon succeeded to the
office of addressing the multitude; and by
prayer, by exhortation, by every means that
could sustain the energy of high-toned passion,
and make excited minds fight their desperate
and successful strife with exhausted bodies
and worn-out hearts, did they all that long
night of physical weariness and mental fever
toil to feed the flame that lit it, and cherish,

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

amid the embers of wasted frames and wandering
minds, every spark that could be kindled
to a blaze, or emit, even in its ashes, a dismal
and smouldering light.</p>

<p>Boanerges began; and when he had exhausted
every topic and term of denunciation
with which a well-stored memory and an implacable
hostility inspired him, he was followed
by the deacon, who, pointing to the few who
had retired with Pierre, extended the broad
anathema of Boanerges, and included within its
circumference the feeble hearts and faint hands,
and "sinners who went <i>two ways</i>." Then he
rehearsed the bitter and emphatic curse of
Meroz, and comprehended in it those who
had not come up to the help of the Lord
against the mighty. He proceeded, and
wrought up his hearers and himself to a pitch
of ferocity which has often armed fanaticism
with desperate and successful opposition even
to disciplined troops and systematized warfare.</p>

<p>To the exhortation of Boanerges the congregation
replied in deep assenting murmurs;
but as the deacon finished, those murmurs

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

were exchanged for groans and howlings as
wild as those of the neighbouring wolves;
every period of his frantic and incendiary
eloquence was drowned in the cry of his
hearers; and Boanerges himself, as he saw
the increased excitement, the powerful and
universal action of which he had been the
first propeller, trembled at the working of
the machine he himself had set in motion,
and "doubted whereunto this would grow."
So fares it with all who presumptuously approach
the ark of Revelation, and are lost in
the attempt to steady its progress and direct
its course ere they have ascertained their right
to touch it.</p>

<p>In the meantime Pierre and his companions
were kneeling in their remote recess; and the
lights and features of scenery under which
these different groups were assembled were
singularly adapted to their different characters.
In the interior of the cavern an ample fire had
been lit; its light, flaming upward, fell vividly
on the notched and ragged edges of the rocks
that impended above, shaping their wild outlines

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

into a resemblance of the visages of
gigantic spectres seen in a feverish dream;
even the light foliage of the shrubs that
started from among their interstices, and the
pendant and waving vegetation of the weeds
that clustered round them, lost all the beauty
of their verdure and forms in that strong unnatural
light, and seemed like the dark webs
that wave in the chambers of sorcery. Below,
the glare was reflected from fierce faces, marked
with fiercer passions, obstinacy and rage, hatred
and despair, and that peculiar expression of
religious hostility that combines all and surpasses
all. In the little sanctuary of Pierre's
associates there was no fierce and fiery light,
no passion or tumult; they knelt on the floor
of stone, and the moon, gleaming through a
chasm in the rock, was the only light that
fell on faces, mild, pale, and sorrowful,&mdash;on
clasped hands, heads meekly depressed, and
bodies, in whose deep and tranquil prostration
you might see that hearts were bowed down
also; and amid the cataract of sound that
thundered from their fiercer brethren, the stilly

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

flow of their pure prayer was heard to murmur
sounds only of love and of peace, of submission
and of sorrow. It seemed as if the
accusing and deprecatory spirits were on their
flight towards heaven together, and the still
small voice of the latter proclaimed that his
petition was accepted.</p>

<p>It was now past midnight; the fires had
sunk low, the moonlight was withdrawn, and
the stormy congregation of Boanerges, and
the placid followers of Pierre, alike sought
a refuge from the stings of many wants and
sufferings in slumber. The gleam of the
embers shed a sullen and wearied light at
length on bands looked in defiance or in
supplication&mdash;now unclasped;&mdash;on eyes that
had flashed with the light of every passion
that can dilate or inflame their orbs&mdash;now
closed;&mdash;on forms agitated by every spirit
that can shake and convulse them most fearfully&mdash;now
still as infancy; all buried in a
sleep like that of death: rage and grief, talent
and mediocrity, power and weakness, slumbered
beside each other. The stormy Boanerges,

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

and the hot deacon, and all their followers and
favourers, with all their various shades of discrepancy
and contradiction, were mute; as
deep a repose was on the few followers of the
pastor; it was a living churchyard. Genevieve
alone, like the angel of the resurrection, sat
watching till the morning.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE desperate courage of Mattathias and his
followers had delayed, though not rendered
doubtful, the strife with the crusaders. Many
fell, and the few who survived fled to their
mountain retreat, their flight well covered by
their dauntless leader, who fought to the last,
and, while the flying party were mingling with
the mists of the mountains that shrouded them,
still kept his face toward the foe. His arrow
was the last that flew&mdash;and it never flew
without quivering in a foeman's heart; his
club was the last that was wielded&mdash;and it
never fell without crushing a man-at-arms to

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

the earth; his curse on the cowards that fled,
and the foes that opposed, was the last sound
that thundered over the hills, amid which the
flying Albigeois seemed, like spectres, hastening
to hide themselves amid the deepening
shades of the mountains and of the night.</p>

<p>Paladour and Amirald, who had dealt about
with their lances and swords as boys would
with their staves amid a heap of bulrushes,
grew weary of the carnage, and toward
twilight rode apart from the field and stuck
their lances in the ground, while they viewed
with some amazement the deeds of a minstrel,
apparently the most eccentric and dissolute
of his profession, who had all day long
sung the loose strains that pleased the ear
of Sir Aymer; and when the conflict (if it
could be termed so between armed knights
and unarmed peasantry) commenced, had
snatched a weapon from one of the bishop's
attendants, and dealt about his blows with
such mortal force, that he scarce gave a
wound where he did not leave a corse. At
the end of the business he caught up his

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

harp, and, tuning it as he might, began to
sing some antique ditty, apparently careless
to whom he sung, or whether his strain was
noted or not. There was an insouciance
about his general department that accorded
with this abrupt transition from ferocity to
levity. He was not old, though he looked
so; intemperance, anticipating the approach
of age, had done its full work on him; his
hair was white, and his hands shrivelled; his
garb too was such as betokened rather the
attire of a poor wandering minstrel than of
the pampered favourite of a lordly castle;
and from time to time there was an expression
of insanity in his sunk eye, and something like
the reality of it in the stubbornness with which
he refused all solicitation to sing the songs
that his companions called for, and persisted
in chanting the wildest and loosest lays that
ever minstrel uttered. They were, however,
sufficiently acceptable to Sir Aymer, whose
admiration was not diminished by the valour
of which he gave such unexpected proofs, and
who, riding up to the young knights, exclaimed,

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

"This is a brave minstrel!&mdash;Where, fellow,
didst thou learn to wield the harp and sword
together?"</p>

<p>The minstrel, instead of answering, struck
some vague chords on his harp, and then
replied, "In the service of a noble valiant
lord, whose name I dare not utter now; there
I learned that the brave alone can worthily
sound the actions of the brave, and that none
should dare to lay finger on the harp, who
could not lay hand on sword and lance."</p>

<p>"And who was thy valiant lord?" said Sir
Aymer.</p>

<p>"One whom I dare not name, though his
towers are near;&mdash;let the bishop of Toulouse
tell ye whose they were once."</p>

<p>"Thou darest not name Raymond of Toulouse,
a heretic and accursed of the church,"
said the bishop, as he rode by.</p>

<p>"<i>Thou</i> hast named him," answered the
minstrel in a suppressed voice, "though <i>I</i>
dare not; those towers once were the abode
of Raymond of Toulouse; a neighbouring
retreat, where he had placed his family for

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

safety&mdash;alas! not a stone of it is left; the
smoke of its last flame was slaked by the
blood of his wife and infant children; and
ever since that day of blood and death,"
he exclaimed, "I have been all for mirth
and jollity;" and he preluded wildly on his
harp. "Ever since that day," he repeated,
striking his harp so strongly that some of the
strings gave way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast broken the strings of thy harp,
fellow," said Sir Aymer.</p>

<p>"It was in memory of the day the strings
of the minstrel's heart were broken," said the
player&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Who busied himself the strings withal,<br/>

To hide the tear that fain would fall."</p>

<p>"And whose service boasts thy minstrelsy
now?" said Sir Aymer, laughing as the minstrel
wept.</p>

<p>"I am in the service of the Lord of Courtenaye,
the tenant of yon castle," said the minstrel.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Sir Amirald, advancing as
they rode, "thou the follower of Raymond of

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

Toulouse, and now the menial of the Lord of
Courtenaye, his deadliest foe?"</p>

<p>The minstrel, without answering, struck a
few wild chords on his dismantled harp; then
suddenly raising his head and his voice, "Hadst
thou ever loved the harp, sir knight," he said,
"never wouldst thou cease to love the spot
where its chords were first struck and echoed.
The stones of that castle," he cried, pointing
to it&mdash;"the weeds that burst through its
walls&mdash;the very waters of its moat&mdash;the
rugged battlements of its walls, are dearer to
me than all or aught but <i>this</i>"&mdash;and with
enthusiastic expression he kissed his harp as
he spoke. "With this," he cried wildly, "I
can raise palaces of amethyst and rivers of
silver, and flowers of hue and odour that
shame paradise.&mdash;But such visions mock me,"
he continued in a dejected tone;&mdash;"give
me the dark-grey stone, the heavy water, the
weeping and tufted weed, and the dim twilight
that sheltered me as I sung of themes then
praised, now forgotten&mdash;give me my dreams
of childhood back again, when my harp and

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

I were alone the tenants of a world of vision
and felicity. Nay, were not one stone of those
walls left on another&mdash;were the streams flowed
away, and the trees rooted from the hills, this
spot would still be populous with forms
and sounds&mdash;would still have tenants for
me."</p>

<p>"And who are they?" asked the bishop.</p>

<p>"The dead," replied the minstrel.</p>

<p>"The fellow raves!" said Sir Aymer, retreating.</p>

<p>"Sing us some strain of that lovely minstrelsy
thou talkest of," said Sir Amirald.</p>

<p>"And look that thou usest virtuous words,
thou ungodly fellow," said the abbot of Normoutier,
who retained all the spleen then felt
by churchmen against mimes and minstrels,
with whom they were at deadly feud for their
dramatic superiority; "but I forewarn thee,
let thy speech be decent; for what saith the
text?&mdash;<i>Castum pium poetam esse decet ipsum&mdash;versiculos
nihil necesse est</i>."</p>

<p>"Sing, fellow, as thou art commanded,"
said the bishop of Toulouse haughtily.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

<p>"Not till my master commands me," said
the minstrel firmly.</p>

<p>"Thy master is absent."</p>

<p>"No, my master is here," said the minstrel,
bowing to Paladour.</p>

<p>"Does he rave?" said Sir Aymer, while
the bishop of Toulouse steadily regarded the
speaker.</p>

<p>"No," answered Vidal, (for that was his
name;) "if there be truth in words or faith
in hearts, the broad lands he treads, the
towers that rise to his view, and I and all
the vassals beneath their roofs, are his, and
his alone."</p>

<p>"What!" said Sir Aymer, "art thou one
of those songsters that will be prophets too,
and tell mad tales of the fiery arrow that is to
pierce yonder towers."</p>

<p>"It is on its flight already," said Vidal
emphatically.</p>

<p>"What meanest thou?" cried Paladour
with amazement, not unmixed with stronger
feelings.</p>

<p>"Mean, sir knight?&mdash;Nothing," said Vidal

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

vacantly; "what meaning have minstrels and
madmen?&mdash;Nought, save lies and dotage.&mdash;They
say Cassandra's fate was hard, but what
was the fate of those who despised her?"</p>

<p>"This is somewhat strange," whispered Sir
Aymer to the bishop.</p>

<p>"Strange!" replied the prelate, "that an
half-crazed minstrel should lie, and a romanceful
youth should listen?&mdash;Hark! he is going
to sing again." And Vidal, as he spoke, burst
into a different strain.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Paladour rode on as the minstrel sung,
full of those heavy thoughts that a mysterious
word or an unexpected incident never failed
to stir up like a host of sleeping enemies
within; and Amirald rode with him in sad and
wondering silence, till his companion, with the
strong habit of solitary suffering, spoke aloud.
"And wherefore," said he at length&mdash;"wherefore
is every step of my earthly progress
marked by presages, and voices that, though
of the living, sound as if they issued from the
grave?&mdash;The voice, the song of that minstrel,
recall to me the images of years in which
I seem to have lived;&mdash;I could, methinks,
repeat every word of his lay, echo every note
of his harp;&mdash;but unless <i>so</i> touched, every

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

chord of my early memory is broken, tuneless,
and irresponsive.&mdash;Hast thou ever had,
Amirald, such thoughts, such feelings?"</p>

<p>Amirald answered that such communications
might be; but he believed that they
were bestowed by blessed spirits, and were
given as tokens of good.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Paladour, "no tokens are
on me for good&mdash;no blessed spirits attend
me. I could swear to that minstrel's voice&mdash;I
could swear that in infancy I sat on
his knees and listened to it. Hadst thou
ever such thoughts of a life that began
before thou hadst living consciousness&mdash;of
a power that awed, a vow that bound thee
even then?"</p>

<p>"I have had such <i>dreams</i>," said Amirald.</p>

<p>"Tell me thy dreams then, and I will tell
thee my life; for my life is as a dream, and
thy dreams perhaps resemble my life," said
Paladour: and Amirald was about to listen,
when the minstrel sung again: and the words,
though totally unconnected with the preceding,

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

seemed to seize irresistibly the ear of
Paladour.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>WHEN their red light the torches lent,<br/>

They feasted full in the victor's tent:<br/>

And ever, with loud and lavish boast,<br/>

The stranger youth's acclaim they raise,&mdash;<br/>

For wonder vanquished jealous pride,<br/>

And joy had made them prone to praise&mdash;<br/>

The stranger youth, who sought that morn<br/>

Their leader, with petition high,<br/>

To bear his banner in the fight,<br/>

And plant it there in blood&mdash;or die;<br/>

And how, when chiefs of bearded might<br/>

Deemed it foul scorn, that stripling light,<br/>

Who never, as his words confess'd,<br/>

In sportive tournay's bloodless jest<br/>

So much as shivered spear,&mdash;<br/>

Dared now, in dread and mortal fight,<br/>

Of chief assayed and well-fleshed knight<br/>

To hold himself the peer:<br/>

How the proud blush of conscious worth<br/>

His hero features burned,<br/>

And his cheek, so pale with awe and hope,<br/>

To speaking crimson turned:<br/>

And while he pleaded yet, and prayed,<br/>

And still the pausing chief delayed,<br/>

The standard from its staff he tore.<br/>

And where upon the heath's dim bound,<br/>

Rung conch and cymbal's heavy sound&mdash;<br/>

And faintly rose: the Paynim moon,<br/>

In dim eclipse to set so soon&mdash;<br/>

Where the dark battle mustered well<br/>

The turbaned bands of Ishmael&mdash;<br/>

Headlong in desperate charge he bore:<br/>

Then closed around the Paynim bands<br/>

In unavailing strife;<br/>

For lo! a thousand weapons aimed<br/>

Against a single life!&mdash;<br/>

And there are lightning lance, and spear,<br/>

And sabre-flash, and scimetar,<br/>

And arrows are hailing from the rear,<br/>

And javelin glance like, failing star.<br/>

Then sprung each warrior to his steed,<br/>

To aid their champion at his need;<br/>

When loud was heard the blood-choked cry,<br/>

That shouted&mdash;"God and victory!"<br/>

And ere the aids can come,<br/>

Through brand and blood his way he wore,<br/>

To earth the struggling foemen bore,<br/>

And on to meet the rescue sprung,<br/>

And mid the shouting champions flung<br/>

The banner blessed by Rome.&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

Like lightning that precedes the storm,<br/>

Ere the clouds dark battle form,<br/>

Was that wild sally's desperate strife;&mdash;<br/>

Then, like the whirlwind in its sway,<br/>

Joined the dark hosts in dread array,<br/>

That parted but with parting life&mdash;<br/>

And he who still aloft that day,<br/>

With bloody hand, the banner bore,<br/>

Who, thrice that day, his bold breast threw<br/>

The Christian leader's life before;<br/>

And from the yelling Paynim's grasp<br/>

Their waning moon in triumph tore;<br/>

Amid the assembled chieftains proud,<br/>

In that dread day's tremendous close,<br/>

While his proud eyes' new-lighted fire<br/>

Still lightened on his breathless foes,<br/>

Low kneeling 'neath his leader's sword,<br/>

Knight-banneret arose:<br/>

"And bear henceforth," the chieftain said,<br/>

"The <i>cross of blood</i> upon thy shield;<br/>

And mayest thou still, as on this day,<br/>

The sword of God resistless wield:<br/>

And saints still give thee faith in death,<br/>

And valour in the field."</p>

</div>

<p>"Not the oaths of the holiest on earth&mdash;not
the attestation of a descended angel,
though he left heaven for the purpose," cried
Paladour with vehement solemnity, "could

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

make me believe I had not heard those words,
those sounds, before,&mdash;though amid scenes I
cannot, cannot recall. Oh those associations,"
he cried, with increasing emotion, "that, far
seen, and faintly remembered, we struggle after
through mist and darkness, and grasp only
their shadows&mdash;those spectres of departed
memory that rise before us when its essence
is gone for ever!"</p>

<p>"And whatever may be the mystery of thy
fate," said Amirald, "mine can parallel it."</p>

<p>"Speak it, then," said Paladour, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I was an orphan, left exposed at the gates
of the Lord of Courtenaye: some mark, that
my flesh still bears, announced me not of
ignoble birth: thus I was committed to the
charity or cruelty of the Lord of Courtenaye.
But amid all the indignities my proud heart was
forced to crouch to, I felt he hated because he
feared me."</p>

<p>"There my early fate parallels thine," said
Paladour;&mdash;"I too was left an orphan,
reared by an obscure burgher,&mdash;and, for the
rest, I cannot for shame speak it; even the

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

dark reminiscences that haunt me, are a relief
to the gloomier picture of my boyish sufferings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My cheek still burns," interrupted Amirald,
"at the recollection of the unworthy, the
unutterable usage I met with in yonder towers,
whose lord trembled at the presence of the
boy he sentenced to vile punishment. I fled
the castle: the bounty of the Lady Isabelle,
generous as she is beautiful, furnished me with
the means of purchasing steed and armour;
and at the battle of Bovines,&mdash;but thou hast
heard that tale;&mdash;and now, with this good
lance, this gallant steed, a light bosom, and a
loyal heart, I am prepared to run my career
in this wild tilting world, as unconscious how
it may terminate as how it began."</p>

<p>"Such fate too hath befallen me," said
Paladour; "and it is marvellous how the
early destinies of strangers should thus agree.
One would think that we were both enchained,
from our Cradles, in one link of suffering,&mdash;but
thine hath been twined with flowers, and
mine forged of iron."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

<p>"I have sometimes thought we might be
brothers," said Amirald, pausing.</p>

<p>"I have often wished that we were,"
said Paladour. "Hark!" he exclaimed, as
Vidal rushed past them, and plunged into the
gloom of the deep-spreading valley that lay
below,&mdash;striking, even in that moment of
partial frenzy, the broken chords of his
harp with a master hand,&mdash;"hark, how he
thunders into the vale, hand and harp, foot
and voice, in deep and terrible accord!&mdash;is it
a mortal minstrel that sweeps the strings?"</p>

<p>"How sweetly," said Amirald, listening to
his own associations,&mdash;"how sweetly they
mingle with the blasts that wail round these
dark hills, deepening in rich sadness as the
darkness deepens! Methinks, while listening
to such wild minstrelsy by twilight like this, I
could forego all thoughts of war and fair
renown, and wish to live for ever amid these
pleasant and solitary places, dwelling with the
images that such sounds could still raise
before me."</p>

<p>"The images that rise before <i>me</i>," said

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

Paladour, with a melancholy smile, "are of a
darker hue;&mdash;but what are thine?"</p>

<p>"There is but <i>one</i>" said Amirald, with enthusiasm;
"that of a form which sometimes
floats between the evening clouds and me, so
softly, so lucidly, that though her beautiful
face be real, (I have beheld its portrait, as I
avouched at the abbey of Normoutier,) the
figure, as it ever floats on the evening clouds,
to mine eye seems more of heaven than of
earth: I see the stars through her form&mdash;her
veil is of light; there is a filmy transparency
between us as I gaze, that I deem her a saint,
though, alas!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I too see the form of a female;&mdash;but"&mdash;Paladour
became convulsed as he spoke, but
still repeated,&mdash;"and I too see the form of
a female."</p>

<p>"Heaven comfort thee!" said Amirald, reining
up his steed, that Paladour's head might
sink on his shoulder. "Wilt thou seek to
the bishop of Toulouse, or the reverend abbot?
they bear holy reliques that might fight with
the dark thoughts that beset thee&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

<p>"No," cried Paladour, raising his head.
"Those sounds have ceased,&mdash;those sounds
to which I can give no name&mdash;affix no meaning&mdash;save
that they madden me to hear
them. This pale light, those dark hills, our
gloomy progress, will restore me. My spirit
swells amid a scene like this, as thine would,
Amirald, under a sunny sky and a bowery
landscape."</p>

<p>The scene was, indeed, such as might have
inspired or cherished the darkest thoughts.
Unlike the other fortified castles of the age,
the castle of Courtenaye, as it was then called,
though it had formerly belonged to Raymond
of Toulouse, seemed built rather for safety
than hostility. It lay in a vast hollow, surrounded
by many hills or mountains, that,
rising one above another, and winding amongst
themselves into endless and shadowy intricacy,
defied the skill of the traveller. Where these
mountains formed a hollow sweep, their summits
retiring behind each other, the castle of
Courtenaye arose like a mountain of stone
that had fallen into the valley; but still, from

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

its commanding magnificence and vast extent
of structure, seeming the master alike of
valley and of mountain. The youths paused
and reined up their steeds to gaze below.</p>

<p>The dark and flying troops of the Albigeois
had long disappeared from the summits of the
hills,&mdash;the mists of night began to deepen
and mingle there, like a dark advancing host
in aid of those who fled,&mdash;the mountain-summits
themselves, partially shrouded by the descending
clouds, and the rising vapours of the
valleys, lay like a giant army in the heavens,
mingling their huge and darkly-defined masses
with those of the clouds that settled heavily
on them. Above the castle, as it stood, one
broad and burning gleam of western light still
lingered, giving to the towers and battlements
the appearance of being in a blaze; and this
appearance was heightened by the contrasted
darkness of the mountains, so that a red and
lowering banner of vengeance and hostility
seemed to stream over the pinnacles of the
castle, while all around lay in darkness. Paladour
and Amirald rode into the valley.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

<p>"Here we part," said Amirald, as they now
descried the many-twinkling lights from the
casements and loopholes, and the torches that
began to blaze from the battlements, as tokens
of invitation to the crusaders: "Here we
part;&mdash;on the wild and dark hills that surround
us would I rather seek for shelter, than
couch in the towers of that felon lord."</p>

<p>"On their bleakest points would I rather
rest," said Paladour, "than in yonder towers.
The unbidden impulse that hath swayed me
all my life seems now more potent than ever.
I tell thee, sir knight, no armed host, with
lances couched and banners spread, could
strike such terror into my soul as yonder castle
with its dark battlements and towers. This
is no dream of fancy&mdash;no fond imagining of
a morbid mind brooding over its own dark
workings: no;&mdash;it is something that nature
warns me from, by those dark but ceaseless
intimations (aided by many external bodements),
and yet seems to impel me to&mdash;&mdash;I
know not what impulse to obey,&mdash;I stagger
beneath the burthen of my destiny,&mdash;fate is

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

beckoning me from every battlement,&mdash;something
more than human weighs me down;&mdash;nothing
human ever weighed me down before."</p>

<p>As he spoke he fell from his horse, and lay
prostrate on the earth. Sir Amirald unclasped
his helmet, undid his gorget, and bared his
throat and bosom to the air. In doing so, he
discovered on the shoulder of Sir Paladour a
trace which, though his eye glanced at it but for
a moment (dimly seen as it was), he started to
behold;&mdash;he bore a similar one himself,&mdash;not
merely similar, but so exactly the same,
that it was evident they must have been impressed
by the same hand, and for the same
purpose. The slight disparity of their years
was no disproval of this conjecture. Paladour
had indeed the finished form of youth on
the confines of manhood: Amirald's form had
the growing graces of a youth of eighteen;
and often had he, when a page in the castle
of Courtenaye, consoled, under many indignities,
his young heart of pride with the mark
that his shoulder bore, deeming it impressed, at
his birth, by those whom he might be proud to

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

recognize as his parents, and who might be
proud to recognize their child. As these
visions of past ignominy and future glory, associated
as they seemed to be with this singular
discovery, passed rapidly and brightly across
his imagination and eye, young Amirald had
the precaution to throw the silken scarf over
Paladour's shoulder; a moment afterwards
Paladour breathed, and his hand sought for
and felt with strong affectionate pressure the
hand of Amirald.</p>

<p>"Dismiss those fellows," whispered Paladour,
(imagining, like all who recover from
a swoon, that he was surrounded by a multitude,)&mdash;"do
thou alone remain near me."</p>

<p>"We are alone," said Amirald, pressing
his hand.</p>

<p>"Amirald," said Paladour, faintly, "wherefore
am I thus overcome? Have I borne me
like a coward to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said the light-hearted Amirald,
"thou wast like the eagle of Jove in flight
and pounce; there was blood enough on thy
beak and talons to warrant thee the cup-bearer

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

of the Thunderer; but now thou hast to
encounter a sort of doves&mdash;Venus's doves, I
deem. Shrinkest thou from such encounter,
thou craven? Mine eagle," he added cheeringly,
"bear away thy plume and breast
unruffled from such conflict; and thou shalt be
my bird of birds&mdash;yea, my ph&oelig;nix."</p>

<p>They were now beneath the walls of the
castle.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou leave me now,&mdash;now, in this
untold conflict of horrid thoughts?"&mdash;said Paladour,
raising himself from the earth.</p>

<p>"Sir Paladour," replied the youth, springing
on his steed, "claim mine arm and brand in
thine hour of peril&mdash;mine heart in thine hour
of kindliness and brothership (if Heaven allow
us another)&mdash;and my life at <i>any hour</i>&mdash;all
shall be thine, at thy lightest summons; but
ask me not to enter the walls of this castle.
There is mystery in thy fate; there is mystery
also in mine, which I cannot now reveal to
thee. Perchance the fiery arrow hath a <i>two-fold
flight</i>."</p>

<p>The tramp of his armed steed's hoofs

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

drowned his last words as he departed: and
Sir Paladour, who had resumed his casque
and gorget, joined the other crusaders as they
approached the entrance of the castle.</p>

<p>Amirald pursued his course among the hills,
with that uncertainty of purpose and of destination
that has its charms for the romantic
and enterprising,&mdash;sometimes murmuring a
love-sonnet, and sometimes listening, amid the
echoes of the hills, for the sound of a convent
bell, where he might claim hospitality for the
night. As pausing thus, from the summit of a
neighbouring eminence he took a last look
of the procession of the crusaders as they
wound in long and dim array through the
portals of the castle, his ears were struck by a
cry suddenly and forcibly suppressed;&mdash;he
listened&mdash;it was repeated&mdash;and the voice was
evidently a female's: there needed no more to
inspire Amirald, who, immediately couching
his lance, spurred his steed in the direction
from whence the cries proceeded.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<br/>

<div class="small">

<p>Lo, at the close of a stormy day,<br/>

They saw a proud castle among the trees.</p>

<p class="right">MOORE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE Lord of Courtenaye had watched that
evening the conflict between the crusaders and
the Albigeois, from the highest turret of his
castle, scarcely feeling himself in safety even
there. When at length, however, the crusaders
poured onward, like a river in flood between
the rushes on its banks that it sweeps away in
its progress, and held their course towards the
castle, he descended from his turret, and prepared
to receive them at the entrance of his
banquet-hall.</p>

<p>He was lit on his way by his constant attendant,
Thibaud, (who bore a torch through
the dark and vaulted passages which they had

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

to traverse before they reached the portals of
the castle,) and whose visage, though he was
silent, bore a meaning his lord did not seek to
interpret.</p>

<p>"We hold a feast to-night," said the Lord of
Courtenaye, with a kind of officious restlessness,&mdash;"is
all prepared?"</p>

<p>"All is prepared," answered the attendant;
"but there is a guest coming thou hast not
reckoned on."</p>

<p>"And who is <i>he</i>," said the Lord of Courtenaye,
who had but one object for the concentrated
terrors of his mental vision.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> will visit thee to-night," said Thibaud.&mdash;"She
hath been seen on the hills this day;
and wherever war or woe chance to be, there
is she, sure as the raven to prey on the dead,
or the spoiler to strip the slain. Moreover,
the wise astrologer who hath watched, fasting
and pure, in the highest tower of the castle,
since the dawn of morning, hath declared that
the lord of the ascendant is combust and retrograde,
and that Almoden is cusped in the
seventh house."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

<p>And the man, as he spoke, shook as if he
was uttering a necromantic spell, though obviously
(from his misuse of the terms of astrology)
ignorant of their meaning.</p>

<p>"Hold the torch higher!" said his lord,
impatiently, "I cannot see my way." The
vassal flashed it full in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Lord of Courtenaye," he cried, stopping
with an air of savage resolution, "I have graduated
long in thy school of perdition. I
have learned my trivium and my quadrivium
in it. For a hasty handling of sword or
dagger in my mood, or at the command of my
liege lord, absolution may be lightly won.&mdash;Show
me a throat to be gashed, or a heart to
be pierced, and where wilt thou find stronger
arm than this?"&mdash;and he bared it,&mdash;"or keener
blade than this?"&mdash;and he brandished it before
his shrinking lord!&mdash;"but for your deeds of
wizardry, your dark dealings in yonder chamber
of sorcery, I scorn them with my heels,
and spit at them with my tongue. Meet the
foul hag if thou wilt, but thou shalt meet her
alone;&mdash;I witness your ghastly conferences

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

no more. What;&mdash;I have a soul to be
saved,&mdash;you must needs bear a conscience,
Lord of Courtenaye?"</p>

<p>"But hush, I pray thee, Thibaud," said
the lord, "have I not explained to thee the
difference between magic lawful and unlawful;
betwixt the evocation of spirits by periapts
and words of power, and foul and fatal compact
with the master of evil? Thou gavest up
thine error, heldest it no longer that it was a
damned art, and wast a believer in the virtues
of fumigation, so grateful to the planetary
spirits"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace with thy wild jargon," said his
companion, whom familiarity in crime had
rendered insolent. "My blood is thine, and
it hath often been shed in streams to spare the
drop that trembles at thy craven heart;&mdash;my
life is thine, for I am thy sworn vassal&mdash;my
liege-lord,&mdash;but my soul never shall be thine."</p>

<p>"But hear me, Thibaud," said the Lord of
Courtenaye, "the arrival of her whom thou
dreadest is horary and auspicious,&mdash;the night
advances&mdash;ere it wane, I have been told, and

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

feel, of a surety, that my mortal enemy will be
here&mdash;whether he come in human form or no,
I wist not; but hark, there he trampling of
steeds and riders over our heads,&mdash;the crusaders
come, and I must bend up my spirit
to receive and greet them as I may,&mdash;we will
talk further of this business at midnight&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Nor at midnight&mdash;nor ever," said Thibaud.
"Command me in aught else; but
for that sin for which men burn both here and
hereafter, you shall hold me excused. I
quailed not at murder,&mdash;not even thy bro&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The smoke of thy torch chokes me," said
the Lord of Courtenaye, dashing it from the
hand of his attendant, and emerging from the
dark passage through which they had wound to a
corridor that opened on the court of the castle.</p>

<p>The crusaders were pouring into it, and
seemed, from their loose array and joyous
colloquy, more like huntsmen returning from
the chase than from a field of battle. The
loud laugh&mdash;the careless bearing of their
arms&mdash;the minglement of squire and knight,
of monks and men-at-arms,&mdash;the inter-crossing

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

of the banners of chivalry and of the
church,&mdash;the pennons of the knights, with
their armorial bearings, floating and conflicting
in the air, with the standard of the cross, upheld
by the attendants of the bishop of Toulouse,
gave to victory the air of a pageant.
It was dim twilight as they entered; the vast
towers of the castle seemed mingling with the
masses of cloud in the western hemisphere, nor
was it easy to distinguish the remoter buildings
of the castle from a heap of misty and volumed
vapour; or the clouds that impended over
them, with their sombrous masses and shifting
pinnacles, from an edifice of magic reared in
the air. Light enough remained to distinguish
forms, though not colours; so there was
a dim and shadowy magnificence overspreading
the group, and as its torrent swept onwards
towards the vast arch of the portal, it seemed
like a river rushing to bury itself with all its
waves beneath the mouth of a cavern. But
as they entered the inner court all was changed
in a moment;&mdash;four hundred torches, borne
by vassals and domestics, turned the twilight

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

into noon&mdash;vermillion and saffron giving
them a brilliant and almost magical lustre&mdash;heralds
and pursuivants, with tabards of cloth
of gold, and embroidered banners depending
from their trumpets, gave note of welcome,
and hailed each distinguished crusader by
name as he rode into the court&mdash;every corridor
and casement around did "blaze with
lights and bray with minstrelsy." The songs
of minstrels and troubadours were mingled
with the soft sounds of lutes and the softer of
female voices, while the fair songstresses scattered
flowers and essenced waters from the
casements and loopholes through which their
bright eyes and necks of snow were displayed.
The Lady Isabelle herself, with her two favourite
damsels and her aged gouvernante,
seated on the summit of an interior tower,
where four torches of perfumed wax blazed
around her, waved her silken scarf in token of
welcome; while every knight, as he rode by
"bare-headed, lower than his proud steed's
neck," bowed in proud and graceful obeisance;
and the Lord of Courtenaye, in the triumph of

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

his feudal pride and individual vanity, forgot
his crimes, his dangers, and all&mdash;but his
terrors&mdash;yet had he heard certain passages
among the guests for whom he had prepared
so magnificent a reception, that vanity would
have had but slender aliment.</p>

<p>"This fool," said the bishop, gazing on the
splendour that surrounded him, "ever loved
the pomp that follows greatness more than
greatness itself." Then turning to the abbot
of Normoutier, "Meseems the Lord of Courtenaye
wills us to play in a pageant to-night&mdash;what
part wilt thou play, lord abbot?"</p>

<p>"Marry," said the literal abbot, as two
ecclesiastics helped him from his palfrey; "I
am clean spoiled for play or pageant&mdash;alas, I
am shrewdly galled&mdash;but if pastime be going
on, pity it were that it were marred; if it be a
mystery or such, I will think no scorn to bear
my part&mdash;let your holy lordship play the
devil, and I will play the fool."</p>

<p>"Thou hast spoken well," said the bishop,
with a prophetic smile; "but I devise to play
my part on a wider stage than this."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

<p>"The castle-hall is ample wide," answered
the abbot, puffing on. "Pray God there be
a cushion on the settle after all; for what saith
the text, <i>percussit eos in</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speed thee on," said the bishop, alighting,
"or thou wilt be too late to play the fool."</p>

<p>"I am never too late to play the fool&mdash;I
doubt not to do my part&mdash;for, as a father
hath it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do believe the text, spare us the gloss,"
said the bishop.</p>

<p>"<i>Nec lusisse pudet, sed non incidere
ludum</i>," said the inveterate abbot, "I deem
it apt authority to prove it is never too late to
play the fool."</p>

<p>Meantime the crusaders, with the bishop
of Toulouse at their head (equally from respect
to his military talents as to his ecclesiastical
dignity) pressed onward to the banquet-hall;
and Paladour, who followed among the
rest, seemed to himself to be plunging into his
grave. The force of his bodily sensations, the
agony of his mental horrors, drove him on
among the crowd as if he were an automaton,

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

a lifeless breathless thing; and while all eyes
were fixed on his towering form and conspicuous
armorial, he gazed on all with glassy
rayless eye, nor was he conscious that he was
a spectator of the magnificent banquet that
swam before his darkened vision, till he was
roused by the voice of Sir Aymer, who demanded,
half jocularly, half reproachfully,
"What, is this a guise to meet ladies
withal, clad in armour as if thou wert tilting
in the lists? Ladies must lack mirrors when
they need to see themselves in corselets and
brigantines&mdash;it is a mere reproach to their
tirewomen."</p>

<p>"I had forgot me," said Paladour, absently,
"or I had not appeared thus&mdash;and yet I
know not&mdash;I feel as if within these walls I
were best wear armour."</p>

<p>"Armour!" repeated Sir Aymer, "what!
hast thou no bravery to honour the feast
withal&mdash;no cloak of velvet with a golden
guard&mdash;no nice foppery of the Italian guise?
By the mass, a taper leg in cloth hose, and a
straight back in a satin doublet, were worth a

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

score of your hacked gorgets and vant-braces.
What avails a taper leg in a boot of steel, a
white neck if it be buckled in mail, a curled
head if it be hid in a helmet?&mdash;Youth, let thine
eyes be opened, and the virtues of tissue be
revealed unto thee."</p>

<p>"My mails contain some suits indifferent
costly," said Paladour; "but the disquietude
of my mind&mdash;I would say the negligence of
my knave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Away, away to thy mails&mdash;examine their
contents&mdash;and if but a point, a thread be
missing, torture thy squire; put all the damsels
in the castle to a rack of thine own devising,
and strain it to thine utmost strength!"</p>

<p>"How merrily thou talkest, Sir Aymer,"
said his sad companion.</p>

<p>"Now heaven forefend," said Sir Aymer,
with an, expression of ludicrous solemnity,
"for here be waged the loves and lives of two
doughty knights on the issue&mdash;go, array thee
in thy panoply&mdash;here is a wasted leg to thy
full calf&mdash;a narrow chest to thy ample shoulders&mdash;a
bald forehead to thy thick dark

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

locks&mdash;in the teeth of such deadly odds, I
defy thee to combat; go, accoutre thee as
thou mayest, and the lady Isabelle be at once
judge and prize of the field&mdash;but mark me&mdash;so
speed me tissue and velvet, if I make thee
not an example to all presumptuous youth, no
masses shall be able to redeem my tailor's soul
from purgatory!"</p>

<p>"I skill so little in gauds," said Paladour,
"that thy tailor's soul is in small danger."</p>

<p>As he prepared to retire, the splendid retinues
of the Lord of Courtenaye entering the
hall made him pause: though he was in
armour, and concealing himself among the
crowd, he thought the eye of the Lord of
Courtenaye rested on him for a moment. The
train passed on, and he was almost alone at
the door; he cast back one glance on the
splendid hall, and some shadows of faint reminiscence
rose before him&mdash;he thought he had
beheld that place before, and struggled with
the recollection, but could not dismiss it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guests crowded fast and frequent
into the hall, the costume of which,

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

rude as it might appear to modern refinement,
boasted a wild barbaric splendour with which
modern refinement could not dare to vie. The
light effused from the torches of the attendants,
who arranged themselves at the backs of the
guests as they sat, fell on the rich liveried
habits emblazoned with the arms of Courtenaye
and Beaurevoir; and on sheets of tapestry
suspended round the walls, where figures,
though uncouthly delineated, glowed in all the
richness of silk and silver. The subjects
were grouped, perhaps, with more than poetical
license: the giant Termagant (a corruption
probably of Tres-magne) was conflicting with
Goliath of Gath&mdash;Bathsheba was ministered
to by the three Graces in her bath&mdash;and
Cupid was aiming his mischievous darts at
king David the while. In another compartment,
the sacrifice of Iphigenia was paralleled
with that of Isaac, and Abraham and Agamemnon
(who had probably never met before
save in the head of a mythological nun who
wove the tapestry), were portrayed in the
same panel, knife in hand; while, by some

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

singular confusion of appropriate situations,
Diana was carrying away Isaac, and a ram
caught by the horns was butting away amid
the foliage that wreathed the classic altar of
the Grecian sacrifice. It could not be said
that these persons, in extenuation of their manifold
absurdities, had nothing to say for themselves,
for from their mouths issued long labels
announcing their names, characters, and destination,
as well as could be told by needle.
Between these sheets of tapestry hung the portraits
of armed chiefs and feudal beauties&mdash;all
the high ancestry of a lordly line<sup id="ref016"><a href="#en016">16</a></sup>; and
the chandelier suspended from the ceiling
blazed with lights, and shed its aromatic diffusions
over viands and banquetters. Nor
was the flavour of the one unworthy the rank
of the other; these were the red-legged partridges
so famed in Languedoc, the livers of
geese fattened by Jews (then eminent in that
art), snails stewed in oil of Lucca, conger

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

and sturgeon, cranes and swans, Tuscan veal,
marchpane and marmalade, and "princely
peacock's gilded train," with its brilliant plumage
and its bill on fire, for the dainty; and
for stomachs more robust, the boar's head and
the haunch of the hart of ten duly broken.
The richest wines of France and Italy sparkled
in the goblets of the knights, which they did
not fail to drain; and at every pledge from the
carved and gilded galleries of the halls, the
minstrels sounded their loud and joyous strains,
with the exception of Vidal, who had seated
himself among them, and who looked round
with an absent and earnest expression, as if
awaiting the arrival of some one for whom he
was to touch the harp he leant on in silence.</p>

<p>Paladour, as he lingered at the door, and
his dazzled eye passing over the group, fell
for a moment on Sir Aymer, now no longer a
veteran and skilful martialist, but a mere
superannuated fop "frounct and trickt" from
head to foot, sighed to himself unheard, "he
bears him like an aged elm, around which the
vines of pleasure still cling, flushing lovely and

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

luxuriant. I am like the oak that spreads its
branches in broad and vigorous flourishing,
but at whose heart a rottenness hath engendered
that causeth the trunk to fall before its
time, and to crush even the flower that was
smiling by its roots."</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye was now seated at
his board-end, between the bishop of Toulouse
and the abbot of Normoutier, whom he
greeted as became their rank and his: but
amid his courtly smiles and silver tones, there
was about him an air of circumspective anxiety
and jealous frugality and apprehended disdain,
that ill became the lord of a feast, at whose
board were seated the first prelates and peers
of France.</p>

<p>There was another expression, too, which
passed from time to time over his features;
but of this the Lord of Courtenaye was himself
unconscious, from the long indulgence of
evil thoughts, corroding recollections, and fearful
anticipations; and his guests were too busy
with the banquet and too careless of him to remark.
For a few moments he sat thus silent

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

and aghast at the head of his splendid board,
often clearing his throat, and at length poured
forth, in tremulous but well-modulated tones, a
panegyric on the champions of the church who
had that day saved the castle of Courtenaye.
The speech only drew forth a haughty and
indignant laugh from the bishop of Toulouse.</p>

<p>"What, my lord," he said, dipping his
hands in a ewer of perfumed water which a
kneeling page presented to him, "what! do
you deem the crusaders spiders that are summoned
to chase a sort of flies from the casements
of thy castle&mdash;the flight of the heretics
was as swift, and their murmur as soon stifled.
If such be the peril of thy castle, St. Dominic
may garrison thee with his band of
inquisitors, and thou mayest defend thy towers
with a rosary!"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Sir Aymer, who enjoyed the
jest at the expense of the Lord of Courtenaye,
"nay, at the next assault, send me summons,
and hold me no true knight if thy pages with
their silken caps, and thy damsels with their
needles, do not beat off the assailants. Marry,

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

let me have the marshalling of the maidens;
they shall be expert, I warrant, in their discipline,
and thy foes shall be prostrate before
them. Trust me it was pity of my life to see
them fall as they did to-day, unarmed and
unresisting&mdash;alas, to see a host of armed
knights trample on a herd of peasant heretics!&mdash;it
made the very hoofs of my armed steed
recoil as I spurred him through the field!"</p>

<p>"The lord abbot," said the bishop, setting
down his cup, "should have been mounted on
your steed; he would have seconded the impulse,
and have been most apt in the recoil."</p>

<p>"I retreated to the rear of the host," said
the abbot, "that I might win the fight by
prayer. Wot ye not, my lord of Toulouse,
that the lifting up of the prophet's hands won
the fight when Israel strove at the siege of
Troy&mdash;or how d'ye name the place&mdash;I know
'tis in Africa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even so," said the bishop, "thou didst
strive and didst also prevail&mdash;for as the rascaille
peasantry fled or fell, ever and anon thy
hands were devoutly lifted up to a flagon of

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

muscadine, and deeply didst thou drain it.
Marry, there was a transitory neat's tongue,
but of that we will not talk&mdash;thou didst deal
with fervent prayer and hot wines, and we with
cold steel and tough carcasses."</p>

<p>The abbot was about to rejoin, when Sir
Aymer joyously exclaimed:&mdash;"The lord
abbot must needs prove his orthodoxy by draining
this goblet of Cyprus wine to the speedy
destruction of the heretics. What! let him
that will not draw his brand against them
draw his beaker, at the least; else by my beads
(heaven pardon sin I have none), I hold him no
true churchman, and the absolution he promised
me for the matter he wots of is stark
naught."</p>

<p>The abbot filled his cup; the bishop was
not slack to follow; Sir Aymer's was sparkling
to the brim before theirs were filled; and
the Lord of Courtenaye was slowly and gracefully
lifting his to his head, when he recollected
the usual ceremonial of every pledge
being announced by the lay of a minstrel, and
made a sign to Vidal, who was leaning in

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

gloomy absence over the rails of the gallery
where he was seated, to touch his harp.</p>

<p>The minstrel complied with a disturbed
and reluctant look, and rung out some chords
preluding a warlike song that had often been
sung at the feasts of his former lord, Raymond
of Toulouse: it had been composed on the
event of the battle in which, some centuries
before, the Saracens, on their invasion of Italy,
had been defeated near Padua; and Vidal
loved it, for his lord had loved it well&mdash;it was
a fragment of his former strain.</p>

<div class="small">

<h3 class="center">Fragment.</h3>

<p>Night sunk upon the field&mdash;by Brenta's side,<br/>

Whose troubled currents red with slaughter swell,<br/>

Paynim and Christian bands their might have tried.<br/>

The arm of God hath smote the infidel,<br/>

The shades that loured where many fought and fell<br/>

(Shrouding in darkness day's last gloamings red),<br/>

Wild image of the battle pictured well<br/>

To wanderer lone&mdash;or bard with shuddering tread&mdash;<br/>

If bard might venture well, unscathed, near scene so dread.</p>

<p class="center">2.</p>

For clouds are furling there their volumes deep,<br/>

Like folded banners of retiring host.<br/>

The parted sun hath sunk in fiery sleep,<br/>

Like tented chieftain on his victor-post!<br/>

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

Wild as the cry that murmured 'All is lost!'<br/>

The night-winds sweep the field with hollow dirge&mdash;<br/>

While (as he mourned his bloody purpose crost)<br/>

The sanguine streaks that in the darkness merge<br/>

Like war-fiend's angry scowl, glare o'er the battle's verge.</p>

<p class="center">3.</p>

<p>Hushed is the battle's roar&mdash;the breeze of morn<br/>

Waved standard sheet, and woke the clarion&mdash;<br/>

Low sung on evening's blast the distant horn<br/>

To the cold ear of flight, its warning tone;&mdash;<br/>

Fallen is the battle's pride&mdash;where gonfalon<br/>

O'er peer and paladin in glory streamed;<br/>

Hovering in hungry swoop on dark pennon<br/>

The vulture and the bird of carrion screamed,<br/>

Where, wan beneath the moon, their mailed corses gleamed.</p>

</div>

<p>As the minstrel struck the last chords, and,
animated by his theme, was arming his band
for a more martial touch, and tuned to words
more thrilling, the two side doors of the ample
hall unclosed, and from the one appeared the
beautiful vision of the Lady Isabelle, (whom
her uncle willed to grace the feast by her
presence,) attended by her damsels and gouvernante,
and from the other Sir Paladour,
his armour doffed, and splendidly arrayed for
the banquet; and as they thus appeared, no
youthful painter, in his dreams inspired by

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

love and genius, ever imaged two forms more
bright and perfect. The form of Paladour had
all the sculpture-like glory of a god descended
from his pedestal; his eagle eye and cheek of
flame seemed at war with the immobility of
his figure, as he stood gazing on the loveliness
of the form that he beheld. He stood transfixed;
but the life-blood that seemed to have
deserted his frame gushed in the brightest
torrents and wildest tides to his cheek and
lip, that, in the language of Southey,</p>

<p class="small">Made the <i>rose's blush</i> of beauty pale,<br/>

And dimmed the rich geranium's scarlet blaze.</p>

<p>Opposite to him the heiress of Courtenaye
and Beaurevoir burst on the eye and soul at
once, converting admiration into rapture, and
leaving the gazer mute and breathless; moving
in the light of beauty, she seemed to communicate
a portion of it to the very atmosphere she
breathed in. The consciousness of unrivalled
loveliness, and the pride of lofty birth, were
blended on her brow with a dignity that
seemed not to seek for conquests, but to

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

demand homage; and the mutable brilliancy
of her expression proved feelings within that
took instant part with all that wakes the
noblest or touches the softest chords of the
heart.</p>

<p>In every movement of her form, in every
variation of her features, there was an undulation
of majesty and gentleness, an union of
vivacity and power, a submissive grandeur,
a sportive imperiousness that is the peculiar
character of female loveliness, claiming protection
amid its very omnipotence, but most
omnipotent in its weakness. The union of
brilliant and lively intelligence with perfect
purity is to be found in the human face scarce
ever&mdash;in those of men never; it was embodied
in that of the Lady Isabelle.</p>

<p>Her apparel was suited alike to her rank
and her beauty; the attire of noble females of
that age bearing, from its lengthened drapery
and numerous folds, more resemblance to the
Grecian than to the Gothic costume. She
was arrayed in a tunic and skirt of azure silk;
a zone (not lower than the modern cincture)

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

compressed her exquisitely modulated bust,
and from it hung her embroidered gipsire;
her mantle of crimson swept the ground, but
one end, gracefully fastened to her zone, displayed
the rich embroidery of her left skirt,
that blazed with the arms of Courtenaye and
Beaurevoir; her wide sleeves, open from the
shoulder, disclosed her graceful arms, wreathed
with bracelets set with gems; her swan-like
neck was encircled with a costly carkanet,
and the ringlets of her dark-brown hair,
twisted with pearl, were suffered to stream on
her bosom, (doubtless through the negligence
of her damsels, whom, however, she forgot to
chide;) while a gem-studded coronal of gold,
over which was flung a glittering veil of aurifrisium,
was insufficient to restrain her dark
curls from straying over her forehead, and
mingling their shade with that of her nobly-arched
brows. Some said the Lady Isabelle
looked loveliest when she touched her lute in
her evening bower; some deemed her so when
she presided at the tournament or the banquet;
but Vidal, the minstrel, swore she never looked

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

so lovely as when she distributed the weekly
dole at her castle-gate, and with her own delicate
hands bestowed their portions on the deformed,
the cripple, and the leper, who gazed
upon her as they received it, as if at her
heavenly smile disease fled, and anguish was
forgotten.</p>

<p>As Paladour approached the chair of state
where her maidens spread the rich folds of
her mantle, while the lady placed her slender
foot on an embroidered cushion that a page
reverently laid for her, not all Sir Aymer's
whispered ridicule and monitory touches could
recover him from the delicious trance, the
awful tremblings, that at once urged and repelled
his timid advance. Sir Aymer, versed
in courtly ceremonial as well as in martial
discipline, announced with becoming dignity
the Knight de la Croix Sanglante; while Paladour
blushed and bowed, and the lady, after
a graceful bend, dropt her veil of golden thread
over half her beautiful face, as if avoiding all
farther encounter with the fixed and glowing
eyes that were raised to hers, but betraying by

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

the action a feeling and a fear of their power,
as flowers close their silken leaves beneath the
ardours of a too brilliant sun.</p>

<p>Perhaps the same instinct induced the lady
to address herself with smiles and laughter to
her maidens, and even to bestow a transient
glance on two gorgeously-habited knights who
were near her. Sir Ezzelin de Verac and
the Sieur de Semonville; the former of whom,
with exaggerated affectation, lay on a cushion
at her feet, while the other sat upright on his
bench, disarranged his costly garb at every
movement, called to his page to mend his
scarf, cursed him for misdoing it, and then
turned to catch the lady's eye, as if his
petulant folly and peevish spleen were meritorious
service in the eye of high-born beauty.
Sir Paladour leant in silence on the arm of
her chair, when the lady half turned towards
him, and her beautiful lips, slowly unclosing,
murmured, "Art thou indeed that knight De
la Croix Sanglante, of whom Fame hath said
so much?" Paladour, trembling, was about
to answer by a profound obeisance, when

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

Vidal, who from his gallery had watched the
moment with anxious eye, pursued his strain
unbidden, and painted the reception of the
hero of his ballad after his victory.</p>

<div class="small">

<h3 class="center">Fragment.</h3>

<p>Oh! sweet it was to see his smile<br/>

Breaking through terror and through toil,<br/>

(As summer, lightning's vivid glow<br/>

Plays o'er the evening's misty brow,)<br/>

While graceful thanks in courtly phrase<br/>

To prelate, peer, and dame he pays;<br/>

But in his path no rose was shed<br/>

Like that his glowing cheek that spread&mdash;<br/>

Waved on the night no ensign fair<br/>

Like his rich rings of floating hair&mdash;<br/>

Nor gem on beauty's bosom past<br/>

The glory that his eye-beam cast,<br/>

And mingled, <i>deep expressions strange</i><br/>

Glance o'er his cheek with lovely change&mdash;<br/>

Where the wild glow of boyish grace<br/>

Mixed with the warrior's sterner trace&mdash;<br/>

And high-arched brows' majestic gloom<br/>

Shaded a cheek of vernal bloom,<br/>

And vermeil lip of dewy thrill<br/>

Seemed quivering with the war-word still.</p>

<p>The Lady Isabelle bowed to the minstrel as
he sung; and he, mistaking the signal, paused

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

in his strain. "I cannot for my soul sing any
other songs than those I sung in the halls of
Raymond of Toulouse; I sing no song to
please the Lord of Courtenaye."</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye meanwhile had
been pledging his noble guests deeply, and
with graceful courtesy at every pledge, till,
at the sudden change of Vidal's minstrelsy,
and the force and power of his altered voice
at the moment that Paladour was about to
address the Lady Isabelle, he bent forward in
his chair with ominous conjecture and fearful
curiosity. The form and features of Paladour
(before concealed by his armour) were then
distinctly visible.</p>

<p>"Fill the goblet of our noble host," said
the bishop of Toulouse; "he hath forgotten
our pledge."</p>

<p>"Yea, to the brim," said the abbot of
Normoutier; "for what saith the text&mdash;marry,
I have forgot&mdash;fill mine, knave."</p>

<p>"Hold it to his head, fellow," said Sir
Aymer&mdash;"he seemeth unable to lift or to
empty it."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

<p>It was so indeed: the eyes of the Lord of
Courtenaye seemed convulsed in their sockets.
He held his goblet, and forced a ghastly smile;
but while he did so a blue circle gathered
round his lips, which contracted rapidly; a
hideous and squalid paleness overspread his
visage; and while dropping the cup that a
page attempted to take from his hands, he
exclaimed, "God!&mdash;another risen from the
dead!&mdash;this is sorcery and hellish dealing!"
and the Lord of Courtenaye fell senseless
beside his chair.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<br/>

<div class="small">

<p>What shall be the maiden's fate,&mdash;<br/>

Who shall be the maiden's mate?</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE consternation that diffused itself was
universal. The Lady Isabelle, with a faint
shriek, rose and retired hastily with her female
attendants. The guests rose also to depart;
those who were unconscious of the cause of the
disturbance, full of wonder and inquiry, loud
and anxious,&mdash;and those who were perhaps
conscious profoundly silent, repelling all curiosity
with grave looks, and hiding under them
feelings that they would willingly have exchanged
for those of the most idle and vacant
querist. So rapid was the dispersion, that but a
few moments had elapsed, when Sir Paladour,
starting from the trance-like feeling which

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

had now become the habit of his life, and
which the recent event had powerfully induced,
gazed around, and saw himself the
sole inmate of the deserted banquet hall. For
a moment he seemed to himself to have sat
at a feast of visionary beings, and to have
been mocked by the semblance of beauties,
nobles, knights, and minstrels; but the unfinished
viands, the untrimmed lights, the
unemptied goblets, were still there, and to his
first profound amazement succeeded that deep
melancholy with which we view the haunt of
departed splendour and festivity. All the
emblems and incentives of gaiety and of glory
were still there; but the spirit of life that
kindled them was extinct, and all were like
glowing but dull embers of a dying fire.
Unconscious and uncaring where he flung
himself, Paladour sat for a few moments
opposite the deserted chair of the Lady Isabelle,
till, startled by a sigh that almost was
breathed in his ear, he turned, and beheld
close to him the minstrel Vidal.</p>

<p>The gentleness of Paladour's spirit struggled

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

with its habitual depression; and he said slowly,
"That was a sweet fragment of old minstrelsy
thou sungst to us, minstrel; repeat it, I pray
thee."</p>

<p>"Lord of these towers," answered Vidal,
"seat thee in thy rightful seat, from which the
usurper hath fallen beneath the glance of thine
eye as if beneath the lightning of heaven, and
I will harp to thee as I have to thy father,
who loved a minstrel well, while my harp hath
a string, or I a finger to touch it."</p>

<p>"Thy words are madness," said Paladour,
rising at this wild address.</p>

<p>"So they may be," said Vidal, whose inflamed
visage and wandering eyes proclaimed
him overcome by wine; "for I am mad
who utter them; but yet I have words to
utter to thee of high import, if the devil that
blazes in my brain would deliver them faithfully
to the devil that stammers from my
tongue. No&mdash;I see it is in vain-&mdash;thou
wouldst not believe what thou scarce couldst
understand."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

<p>"Wretched man," said Paladour, "how
couldst thou fall into so low a vice&mdash;one that
degrades thy lofty art, ennobled as it hath
been by hands in whose veins runs the richest
blood in France?"</p>

<p>"Upbraid me not <i>thou</i>," said Vidal, "for
it was grief for thy father and his house"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And who, then, was my father?" said
Paladour.</p>

<p>Vidal only answered himself. "Then habit&mdash;the
devil&mdash;or that strong appetence for
feverish life which the minstrel must feel and
feed from his first hour to his last. What the
murmur of the stream, the song of the birds,
the music of the woods when the wind waved
them, did for me in my youth&mdash;<i>this</i> must do
for me now;" and he drained a goblet as he
spoke. "Wo&mdash;wo to those," he said, setting
it down, "who, like me, dip the wings of
their muse in wine to brighten her plumes, but
lose and drown her in the attempt, and lose
themselves after to seek her!"</p>

<p>"My life seems haunted by portents and

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

omens," said Paladour; "in the name of
Heaven"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Vidal, with an aspect of
mysterious but mockful solemnity, "name
not Heaven beneath this roof; its usurper
hath devoted himself to hell, and its inferior
agents are now around and watching us. Yet
I had something to unfold&mdash;something, too,
that might redeem my worthless and weary
life, and make men say the wandering minstrel
parted with a full and fair confession: but
not now&mdash;my brain still burns and my senses
blaze, and I would mix images of my harp's
creation&mdash;that harp, my comfort and my curse&mdash;with
substantial things of real horrid life.
Darest thou meet me in thy chamber at midnight,
youth?"</p>

<p>"Did ever mortal ask such question of me
before?" said the knight; "why dare I not?"</p>

<p>"I know not. I am a drunkard&mdash;a fool&mdash;a
madman," he added, draining another goblet.
"But look to the furniture of thy sleeping
chamber." And drinking again, he sung
wildly&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

<p class="small">"And now for the deep and drunken sleep<br/>

When the brain is turning, whizzing and burning,<br/>

And we plunge into a bed of fire,<br/>

Whose roof seems rising higher and higher,<br/>

Till the eye-lids drop; yet within them keep<br/>

The flame that glares through our frantic sleep,<br/>

And we toss through a night of feverish pain,<br/>

And wake to thirst and flames again.<br/>

Oh! thus ye slumber, minstrels, well&mdash;<br/>

Would that such sleep were your only hell!"</p>

<p>"At midnight, if thou darest," he added,
nodding at the knight.</p>

<p>"At midnight, if thou <i>canst?</i>" said Paladour.
"Poor soul, I pity thee."</p>

<p>"Pity <i>thyself</i>," said Vidal, "but heed <i>me:</i>
I will be punctual as the castle bell, solemn
as its sound, true as its touch of time, and&mdash;forgotten
as its echo." And they parted.</p>

<p>Even when Paladour reached the chamber
to which they conducted him, he could not
help making a kind of shadowy acquaintance
with the objects around him, as if he had beheld
them in some early and forgotten part of his
existence; but it was singular, that the more he
endeavoured to bring these objects into contact
with his faded recollections, they only receded

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

the faster; yet, when he gave up the effort,
the reminiscences returned with more vividness
than ever. Seated by his lamp, which he
forgot to trim, he awaited the approach of
midnight, while the words of Vidal recurred
to his memory; "survey the furniture of thy
sleeping chamber." A heavy stupor fell on
him as he sat,&mdash;it was not sleep, for his
senses were awake to the slightest impression.
The heavy toll of the castle bell, the only announcement
of time then known, measured by
the hour-glass of the warder of the barbican,
and instantly echoed from battlement to
terrace, proclaimed midnight. Paladour,
starting up, listened and thought he heard the
sound of distant steps; he rose&mdash;the steps
approached, and a light gleamed along the
passage; a moment afterwards a sound was
heard like the fall of a trap-door, mixed with
a brief and stifled cry of agony. Paladour
never again beheld the minstrel Vidal.</p>

<p>All was hushed in the castle. The perfumed
torches with their light were dying away
in the arched passages; not the echo of a step was

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

heard along them, from the sounding tread of
the knights and their attendants to the noiseless
step of the sandaled monks; all that broke
on the stillness was the distant baying of the
dogs chained in the holes of the outer ballium,
or the footfall of the warders, whose armed
tread made the stone terraces ring with their
marked and accordant sound. The Lord of
Courtenaye sat in his closet in silence and
with clasped hands. He had recovered from
his swoon, but his faculties still seemed darkened
and bewildered. Thibaud was his sole
attendant,&mdash;his ample hand rested on the
back of his lord's chair, and his eyes were fixed
on the ground: from time to time he raised
them to gaze on a black curtain that hung
opposite him, and then hastily withdrew them.
At length, "How wears the night?" said the
Lord of Courtenaye.</p>

<p>"It draws towards midnight," said the
attendant; "towards the appointed hour."</p>

<p>"What sound is that in mine ears, like that
of cries of slaughter?" said his lord.</p>

<p>"Perchance the distant baying of the dogs

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

who are chained in the outer court," answered
Thibaud. "I hear no other."</p>

<p>"Nay, but listen."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>Both were intently silent.</p>

<p>"A footstep approaches," said the Lord of
Courtenaye, starting.</p>

<p>"Thou hearest the armed tread of the warders,
as they pace the rocky terraces, which
return every step with a marked and distinct
echo," replied the vassal.</p>

<p>"Methought," said the Lord of Courtenaye,
"the sound was close at my chamber door."</p>

<p>"In the deep and stilly night," said Thibaud, "sounds
come with a strong distinctness
to the ear, that in the hurry of day we
would not heed, or could not hear."</p>

<p>"It fares, then," said his lord, "with the
mind as with the ear; for, in the night, many
thoughts arise that seem to shun us by day.
Oh that the eye of the mind could be closed,
even as the ear of the body may be shut,
against such visitors, by sleep,&mdash;yea, though
the sleep were eternal!" He paused, and

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

rocking himself in his chair, murmured, "Now
that all sound hath ceased, doth not the stillness
press on thine ear as somewhat dreary
and unnatural?"</p>

<p>"Dreary enough," said Thibaud, with a
faint shudder, "but not unnatural. The
castle is hushed, and all the guests are departed."</p>

<p>"Would that they were," said the Lord of
Courtenaye; "but I have a guest who will not
depart: he is with me when I am alone:&mdash;were
a hundred voices around me, his is the
only one I hear: he was at my board to-night,&mdash;he
is in my closet now." And, as he
spoke, the Lord of Courtenaye, with trembling
hand and reverted eye, withdrew the black
curtain and disclosed the portrait of an armed
warrior. Thibaud shrunk from the view, or
from the resemblance it bore to one he beheld
so lately; but his lord fiercely shook his feeble
hand at the portrait as he dropt the curtain,
and cried,&mdash;"The sword cannot slay&mdash;banishment
cannot expel&mdash;excommunication
cannot crush and wither the accursed race,&mdash;one

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

serpent maimed sends forth another to hiss
in my face. There is but another course to
be taken," he added, his eyes fixed on a point
with fearful expression.</p>

<p>"And that course, lord, thou must tread
alone," said Thibaud, retiring.</p>

<p>"Begone, then, fool," said his lord in wrath;
"thou art not fit to hear of such high mysteries,
far less to speak of them. One sound of thy
profane utterance were enough to undo all;
that the words of the sage, and the works
wrought in this chamber of secrecy, are doing
for me now&mdash;even this moment. I pray
thee rid me of thy presence!"</p>

<p>"That is lightly done," said Thibaud, opening
the door,&mdash;"as lightly," he muttered, behind
it, "as at thy hest I left thee brotherless."
Then half opening it and showing his inflamed
yet ghastly face,&mdash;"for the encounter thou
art about to brave, trust me, one holy priest
were worth a host of armed knights. For
the body I reck not, come fiend come foe,&mdash;but
for the soul&mdash;I have had fearful dreams of
late;&mdash;what will be thine, dark-dealing lord,

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

to-night?&mdash;even amid the horrors of mine own
I will smile, in vision, to think how deeper
thine must be."</p>

<p>As the door by which Thibaud retired closed,
another opened, (for every panel in the closet
contained a secret door,) and a figure appeared
at it that seemed, indeed, "not of this world."
His visage was deeply marked with the traces
of time and thought, his eyes sunk, his forehead
wrinkled, and his beard descended to his
girdle; on his bald head was a conical cap,
marked with strange figures, and on his breast
the mystical angles of the pentacle: he had a
staff in one hand, and a parchment with the
plan of a horoscope in the other. His white
garment had a border wrought with the signs
of the zodiac, and his girdle was wrought with
Arabic characters, in the centre of which
blazed in gold the tetragrammaton&mdash;the awful
four letters, whose influence, alike awing the
devout and intimidating the weak, gave at once
sanctity and terror to his appearance.</p>

<p>Thus arrayed, pale, trembling, and hoary,
the sage stood before the Lord of Courtenaye;

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

and each gazed on the other as those who
have to hear or to communicate fearful intelligence,
yet dread to ask or to utter it.</p>

<p>"Speak!" said the lord at last, in a choked
voice, "for I feel thou hast evil to tell,&mdash;herald
and agent, perchance, of evil as thou
art."</p>

<p>"The constellations withhold their light
to-night," said the trembling astrologer; "but
one burns dimly in the heavens, and he is to
thee most hostile;&mdash;a stranger is in the house
of Mars, whose mail is redder than blood;
and the planet that is the lord of thine ascendant
is dim."</p>

<p>"Liar and villain!" said the spleenful lord,
rushing on the defenceless old man. "Villain,&mdash;but
not liar," he added, shuddering as he
recoiled, "a stranger indeed hath come,"&mdash;and
he sunk on his seat.</p>

<p>"Then are my words verified," said the
trembling seer. "Alas! I can read the stars,
but cannot command them."</p>

<p>"Slave and dog!" cried the patron, gnashing
his teeth; "was it for this I snatched thy

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

withered carcass from the flames of the inquisition?&mdash;marry,
I did the flames little wrong,&mdash;thine
whole anatomy would not have yielded
one drop of blood, to hiss in the fire. Was it
for this I saved thee from the vassalage, when
old wives with distaffs, and boys with bird-bolts,
would have threshed thee to chaff?
Was it for this?&mdash;to taunt me with thy terms
of art, the jargonry of thy vile trade, and
teach me a lesson from the stars thou never
readest thyself; or, if thine art be aught but
a lie, mightest efface, and seek or trace
happier characters and more auspicious presages."</p>

<p>"Lord of Courtenaye," said the seer, more
incensed at the indignity offered to his art
than to his person, "what talkest thou of
effacing the letters of thy destiny written in
that book of heaven, the stars, which all eyes
may gaze on,&mdash;but gifted eyes alone may
read? Canst <i>thou</i> turn back their courses or
veil their light? Thou mayest place thine
hand over thy feeble organs, and hide their
lustre from thee; but will that retard their

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

viewless operation, or empower him who reads
them to say, because they are not bright to
thee, they are not legible to him. Thus was
the prophet rebuked by the incredulous
Moabitish chief; and thus also he answered,&mdash;if
Balak would give me his house full of
silver and gold, I cannot go aside from"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;"Knave, slave, and in one word&mdash;astrologer,"
said the angry lord, stamping in
agony of impotent wrath, "wretch and dog,
is it for this I have perilled life and soul to
shelter thee in the turrets of my castle?"</p>

<p>"Light thanks I owe thee for it," said the
incensed sage, "for thou didst it for the sake
of that which thou valuest more than soul or
body, the towers of that castle which to-night
trembles over thine head."</p>

<p>"Thou monster of ignorance," said the
lord, not hearing him in his passion, "scarce
worthy to rehearse a traditionary almanack, to
tell the peasants' wives that by our Lady's
grace it will thunder in summer, and if the
foul fiend (would he had thee) prevent not, in
winter there will be snow:&mdash;thou human

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

horologe&mdash;thou&mdash;but words are wasted on
thee thou ducking obsequious slave of time,
and boasted ruler of futurity, that canst set all
the stars in an uproar when the handle of my
lady's fan is lost, and put constellations to
torture if her lap-dog be astray;&mdash;is it thou
who pratest when the destiny of the Lord of
Courtenaye is weighing in the balances of
heaven, or of hell?&mdash;Avaunt, I say, begone,
teach thy stars to speak better language, or by
the protomartyr, I will exalt thee fifty feet
nearer them on a gibbet in the castle-court,
where, nailed to it, thou shalt have leisure to
view them, unless the hooded crow first peck
thy bleared and doting eyes out."</p>

<p>The astrologer stood aghast, and the Lord
of Courtenaye was rapidly approaching one of
those paroxysms of fury that so often proved
fatal alike to associate or foe, when a sound
was heard from beneath his feet that operated
instantaneously on his fiercest moods; and the
fear of the one, and the passion of the other,
were hushed in a moment to watch it. The
sound was repeated, and soon after a board in

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

the floor beneath them (which was for certain
purposes but partially paved) rose with a slow
motion, and disclosed the form of a female,
who emerged from it. She was wrapt in a
grey mantle, the hood of which fell far over
her face: her shape was completely enveloped
in this mantle, but when her feet touched the
floor, she extended one bare and sinewy arm
towards the Lord of Courtenaye, and exclaimed,
"Spirit dark and disquieted, be at
rest&mdash;for I am here."</p>

<p>"And welcome art thou, my meet ally,"
said the wretched man, now almost raving
between the extremes of rage and terror; "the
assassin and the astrologer, the powers that I
could hope aid from in earth or sky, have deserted
me: there remains but thee,&mdash;whence
<i>thou</i> comest I guess, where thou wilt bear me
I reck not,&mdash;the strong necessity of fate drives
me to thee, and to thee I will cling as my last,
deadly, inevitable, and <i>most accursed</i> resource."</p>

<p>"Thou hast spoken my welcome well,"
answered the figure, without changing position,
place, or feature,&mdash;"none ever cursed

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

the evil power in bitterness of voice and spirit
more deeply than when they felt their sole
dependence was on him."</p>

<p>"Speak to her," said the Lord of Courtenaye,
"for though her presence exalts,
her voice chills me;"&mdash;and he sunk on his
chair incensed, and yet vacillating between
them, not knowing in the agony of his incertitude
on which he should bestow the name of
demon and deluder, or to which he should
offer himself a victim.</p>

<p>"Lord of Courtenaye," exclaimed the astrologer,
"the astral spirits, whose being is purity,
and whose essence is light, may ill consort with
those whose forms are exhalations from the burning
lake, whose breath is blasting, and whose
blessings are curses. If man <i>will</i> rend asunder
the veil that wraps futurity, if he will know
that which Heaven will not have known, let
him seek it at least where the temptation may
be a balance against the offence, as the fruit
of Eden might be a palliation for the fall;&mdash;let
him read the vast volume of the planetary
skies, alive with glory and instinct with knowledge:&mdash;not

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

the blood-scrawled leaves of deadmen's
skin where sorcery traces the dooms of
hell. Even if our system err, is it not better to
err with us?&mdash;to dream that we see the astral
intelligences seated each on his golden orb,
guiding their mystic dance round the throne of
light, and hymning to each other the songs of
paradise through the stillness of unmeasured
space, till mortal cares and thoughts are lost
amid the dim glories of nocturnal contemplation&mdash;the
inaudible but heart-echoed harmonies
of heaven&mdash;and the rush of the expanded
soul that pursues its bright and boundless
career through the infinitudes of the universe,
seeking and tracing the mysterious and irreversible
relation which every minute and
opaque orb holds to the destination of the
inhabitants of its neighbour-planet;&mdash;is not
this a laudable temerity?&mdash;a god-like sin?&mdash;an
aspiration worthy of an angel not quite
fallen?"</p>

<p>He paused; but of his hearers, one seemed
as if he heard him not, and the other as if she
were listening to other voices, "The glories,

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

and perchance the truths of heaven, were
unfolded to thee," said the indignant sage,
departing, "and thou hast rejected them,&mdash;the
horrors and the darkness of hell be thine,
since thou hast chosen them;" and he disappeared
through the narrow door which led
by a secret stair to the loftiest turret in the
castle.</p>

<p>"The dotard is gone," said the Lord of
Courtenaye; "speak now, if thine art be not a
fable, or thy power a dream; canst thou by
drug or charm, or aught of evil operation thou
boastest of, do deadly and sudden work on
mine enemy?&mdash;he is within these walls&mdash;within
my very clutch&mdash;do thou some mortal
deed on him this night."</p>

<p>"What fearest thou from him?" said the
fearless female.</p>

<p>"That which I cannot utter," answered her
shuddering companion. "Were an assassin
holding a dagger to my throat,&mdash;were a fiend
grasping my disembodied spirit, I should know
what I had to fear, and knowing would cease
to fear: but this suspense between earth and

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

hell, this dream-like existence among beings of
this world, and beings that are not of it, fills
me with fears I cannot utter;&mdash;indefinite fears
worse than darkest realities."</p>

<p>"Then art thou twice the coward I deemed
thee," said the female; "there is a peril from
which the bravest may shrink, even in his hour
of might: but he who dreads to name his
danger, dreads the sound of his own voice,&mdash;becomes
a spectre to himself, and never was
fear so horrible. Men have said, fear is the
shadow of danger; but I say unto thee, danger
is but the shadow of fears like thine;&mdash;but thou
art a dissembler in thy very cowardice;&mdash;there
is something lurking in the folds of thy heart
which thou darest not reveal to thyself, though
I already know it."</p>

<p>"A stranger came to my castle to-night,"
said the Lord of Courtenaye, covering his eyes
with his hands;&mdash;"and he bears such resemblance
to my mortal enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As son to sire," answered the female,&mdash;"I
know it,&mdash;and such he is."</p>

<p>"Hell take thee, sorceress," exclaimed the

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

angry lord, grinding the curse between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"Waste not thy breath on useless prayer,"
said the female, with a dreadful smile;&mdash;"Hell
is at work to find room for us both."</p>

<p>"Accursed be thy destiny!" said the furious
lord, "and doubly accursed the instruments
with which it hath enforced me to deal!"</p>

<p>"Accursed rather," retorted the female,
"be thy evil passions; and tenfold accursed
the need that compels the power that moves
thee to assume the form of thine instrument!"</p>

<p>"Instrument or power," exclaimed the
lord, "name thyself, or <i>be</i> what thou wilt,&mdash;mine
enemy is within my walls, rid me of
him, and&mdash;&mdash;Oh that I knew what demon
wafted him hither, that I might curse him!"</p>

<p>"Curse <i>me</i>, then," said the female; "this
hand pointed, this arm rowed, this eye fixed
his path to thy towers."</p>

<p>"I am bewildered," said the unhappy man;
"there is a mystery about thee that nought can
penetrate;&mdash;thou hast promised me the destruction
of mine enemy,&mdash;thou bringest him

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

beneath my roof,&mdash;thou triumphest in my
ruin,&mdash;thou hast boasted thou wilt work <i>his</i>&mdash;What
must I think,&mdash;is this thy faith to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the female, exalting her lofty
figure with her voice&mdash;"my faith to thee
shall be truly kept. I am bound to thee by
ties thou knowest not, or hast, perchance, forgotten,&mdash;by
me remembered ever. I swore
that by my means should be wrought the destruction
of thine enemy;&mdash;that oath I
pledged to thee in thy vault of sorcery&mdash;again
I pledge it to thee in this chamber&mdash;the
portal of hell; and that I may redeem it,
know that Vidal, the minstrel, is even now
seeking the chamber of the stranger, and will
reveal to him that which may give the 'fiery
arrow' a fleeter wing and surer mark."</p>

<p>"Vidal here!" exclaimed the Lord of
Courtenaye,&mdash;"and seeking the chamber of
that stranger knight, but whence and wherefore
is it," he cried, pausing, "that thou thus
ever seemest to deal doubtfully betwixt me
and mine enemies,&mdash;to evade, and yet fulfil
my purpose?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

<p>"For mine <i>own</i>," answered the female,
sternly; "but if the deed thou wishest be
wrought, ask not thou the means or instrument;&mdash;they
may be beyond thy thought to
reach, or thy touch to finger, save to harm
them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho! Thibaud!" cried the Lord of
Courtenaye.</p>

<p>"Ay, summon him," repeated the female.
"Now is Thibaud in his office. Alas! that
vengeance should rest in men's hands, and only
in women's hearts!"</p>

<p>Thibaud appeared at the door, and seemed
to listen with eagerness to the whispered communications
of his lord.</p>

<p>"Assassin&mdash;lord and murdering ruffian! ye
are met again," said the female to herself;
"but soon shall ye be parted, each to his
destiny. Amid fires your bond of slaughter
was begun; amid fires it shall be consummated&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the whispers of the lord
and his attendant reached her, as she stood
erect and motionless, her arms folded, appearing

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

to listen only to her own dark mutterings;
yet, from habit, involuntarily catching the
slightest sound within the compass of bearing.
Some of those sounds were terrific enough;
but her ear was now cold as her heart was
seared; and she listened, if not with pleasure,
with a kind of fearful interest, as one who
herself had interest in all fearful things. The
whispers became louder, and Thibaud seemed
urging some desperate measure.</p>

<p>"No noise&mdash;no tumult!" murmured the
lord; "the castle is full of guests lightly
aroused." The whispers sunk lower; then
came the scarce audible sound,&mdash;"The passage
that he must tread to that chamber&mdash;the
trap-door he wots not of, but thou canst govern
its springs&mdash;thou knowest how they
play&mdash;he falls through it. My countdom to
the coin thou balancest in thine hand,&mdash;I will
treble it&mdash;quadruple it&mdash;so thou doest thy
work well;&mdash;the drunken dreamer will fall
into the snare, and awake in eternity."</p>

<p>Their slow and faltering steps were then

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

heard for a few moments, as they glided along
the passage; the female listened till the sound
had ceased, and then raiding the trap-door,
plunged into the vaults to pursue her unutterable
occupation.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Far other scenes than those that occurred
in the secret chambers of the Lord of Courtenaye,
and the restless apartment of Paladour,
were passing in the chamber of the Lady Isabelle;&mdash;scenes
of loveliness and light, of
reposing beauty, and perfumes that gently
prepared the senses for slumber; and music,
that wound up the spell by its richest and
softest tones; and all that high-born beauty
might claim, or feudal power command;&mdash;all
were displayed in the night-chamber of
the Lady Isabelle.</p>

<p>The lady, her dark-brown locks (now untwined
from the band of gems, coronal, and
veil,) touching the ground, sat in a lofty
chair; while her female attendants, of the
lower class, were arranging her beautiful

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

tresses for the night. Germonda and Blanche,
her favourite attendants, lay on cushions at
their lady's feet,&mdash;sometimes chiding the inferior
attendants for their negligence in arranging
her long-flowing locks,&mdash;sometimes pausing,
in their chidings, to admire their beauty and
length, and lifting in their slender hands
the lady's hair, that now, fully displayed,
fell from her tapestried chair to the floor.
Dame Marguerite kept her post of honour
at the back of the lady's chair, fan in hand,
mirror at her girdle, her eye glancing at
the inferior attendants, as if to intimate that
the art of placing combs, or of braiding tresses,
was lost since her time; and ever and anon
scowling at the young favourites who occupied
the embroidered cushions at their lady's feet.
Meanwhile, Dame Marguerite panted with
terror, lest a secret of her own should be discovered,
which, if known, would, in those
towers of feudal power and violence, have cost
her life on its discovery.</p>

<p>Undisturbed by the secret jealousies of her
attendants, and the desperate treachery of the

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

gouvernante, the Lady Isabelle, in all the light-hearted
sportiveness of undoubting security, and
the gay consciousness of triumphant beauty
preparing for gorgeous repose, was jesting
with her attendant damsels: "Now read me
my riddle, maidens," she said, "and read
it right,&mdash;Which of all my suitors deserves
to be rated highest in our esteem, or in your
commendation?"</p>

<p>The damsels, as the lady guessed, each
commended him whom she was least anxious
to acknowledge as her favourite. "Ah, lady!"
said the elder, "who can doubt the supremacy
of that knight for the very lists of love, Sir
Ezzelin, that sovereign of cuts, slashes, and
guards, and indeed that most potent prince of
the territory of fringes and feathers?&mdash;Cupid's
arrows are ambushed in every fold of his
doublet, Venus's swans are in the plumes of
his cap. Trust me, no knight dare tilt with
him, unless a tailor were his squire; then there
might be fearful odds. For me, so help me
needle and bodkin, I dare no more undertake
him on the ground of women's gear from the

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

tapestry that covers your chair to the lace
that binds your skirt, than I dare do battle
with the heretics, or encounter the Lord of
Courtenaye when the crane or peacock is not
duly dismembered, or the wines of Greece
and Italy offered to the guests below the
salt."</p>

<p>"Where didst thou learn the nonsense thou
hast talked?" said the lady.</p>

<p>"Be not displeased, lady," said the attendant,
trembling; "it was from a wandering
minstrel, an attendant of Sir Ezzelin de Verac.
The words were dictated, he told me, by a
maid who loved him."</p>

<p>"The words are naught, and the music
discord to mine ear," said the lady. "What
canst <i>thou</i> say?"&mdash;to her other attendant.</p>

<p>"Nought but what the Lady Isabelle would
hear," replied the cautious damsel; and the
lady answered, "Say on without offence."</p>

<p>"Then, for my life," said the damsel, "methinks
the Sieur de Semonville hath a pleasant
wit; his patrimony is ample, his birth noble,
his haviour gentle."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

<p>"Check thy falcon, lest it prove a haggard,"
said the lady, smiling; "I will myself tell the
rest; his hawks well bathed&mdash;his hounds well
fed&mdash;his towers well warded&mdash;his treasures
well barred in the ample chests of his castle
hall.&mdash;But, mercy of Heaven! what hand
rends mine hair so?"</p>

<p>Dame Marguerite, weary of her long silence
and perhaps anxious to conceal her treachery
by increased officiousness, advanced, fanning
herself with much trepidation; and avouched
that she had snatched the lady's tresses out
of the hands of the conspiring minions, who,
beside their want of skill in bredes and
bands, globes and spires, had dared to breathe
the name of a landless knight, whose birth
and lineage were unknown, as paregal with the
names of the noble suitors of the lady, Sir
Ezzelin de Verac and the Sieur de Semonville.</p>

<p>"And who was that knight of whom they
dared to speak?" said the Lady Isabelle, in a
tone that made each party fear she had gone
too far.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

<p>"Sir Paladour," quoth Marguerite at length&mdash;"that
doubtful and dangerous guest of the
castle of Courtenaye. Twice did I courtesy
to him unnoticed, though I stood close beside
thy chair&mdash;three times (by chance) I dropt my
fan; he never regarded it&mdash;then I coughed
aloud; and, instead of tending me the broidered
kerchief or napkin, he bowed to look for thine.
Now out on him for a hilding, a most uncourteous
and unnurtured knight!&mdash;I say fie
on him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dame Marguerite," said the Lady Isabelle,
pointing to the tapestry of her chamber,
which was embroidered in allegorical figures
representing the seven deadly sins, with their
concomitants, "thou seest the punishment of
<i>Mal-bouche</i> and <i>Vil-reproche</i>&mdash;I trust thou
wilt not incur it." Dame Marguerite was
dumb as the figures in the tapestry. "Claudine,"
said the lady in a tone of languid
pleasure to the discarded attendant, "bind
thou my hair; thy touch is softer, methinks,
and thy hand most skilful.&mdash;Now for a tale

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

of the last tourney we witnessed, damsels.
Where was the last pageant shown? I love
to have those bright images haunt me between
sleep and waking, to have them linger betwixt
mine eyelids ere I sleep, and wake me with
their bright forms before the dawn."</p>

<p>The damsels were instantly profuse in their
praises of some splendid pageants exhibited in
honour of the Lady of Courtenaye.</p>

<p>"Methought," said the skilful Claudine,
"I saw in my dreams a pageant that outdid
them both. I saw a fair fortalice assailed by
a knight who called himself L'Amour, and he
flung feathers, fringes, and flounces at it, and
the lady who held out the fortalice laughed
him to scorn: then came another knight,
naming himself La Richesse, and he flung
purse after purse, and then he began to fling
heavy chests at it, and still the fortalice and
the lady held out bravely. Now, at the end
of the pageant, came in a knight named <i>Le
Bel Estranger</i>, and he neither summoned nor
assaulted the fortress; he bowed, and looked,

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

and the lady and the fortress were in his bands
in a moment."</p>

<p>The Lady Isabelle was silent; but the attendant
damsels navigated instantly and skilfully
on the new tack indicated by Claudine.</p>

<p>"Methinks," said Blanche, "I too have
seen that pageant played, but not in a dream;
and oh, how lovely looked <i>Le Bel Estranger!</i>
Is he not the absolute prince of fancy, the
sovereign of the domains of valour and of
beauty? How looks the Sieur de Semonville's
visage to his?&mdash;like that of a mousing
owl to a soaring falcon's."</p>

<p>"And Sir Ezzelin's gorgeous attire," quoth
the other, "seemed in comparison like the
mottled plumage of the pye with the dark
pinion of the king of birds, the strong rider
of the elements."</p>

<p>"I am weary," said the lady;&mdash;"disarray
me for rest. But thou, Claudine, be near
when I sleep; I love thee well, wench, though
I have not shown it hitherto. Wear this
carkanet for my sake; but wear it not, I
charge thee, in presence of Sir Paladour.&mdash;Now

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

read me my riddle once more, my
maidens." As her head sunk on the silken
pillow&mdash;"How may ladies sink most sweetly
into their first slumber?"</p>

<p>"I ever sleep best," said Blanche, "when
some withered crone is seated by the hearth
fire to tell me tales of wizardry or goblins, till
they are mingled with my dreams, and I start
up, tell my beads, and pray her to go on, till
I see that I am talking only to the dying
embers, or the fantastic forms shaped by
their flashes on the dark tapestry or darker
ceiling."</p>

<p>"And I love," said Germonda, "to be
lulled to rest by tales of knights met in forests
by fairy damsels, and conducted to enchanted
halls, where they are assailed by foul fiends,
and do battle with strong giants; and are, in
fine, rewarded with the hand of the fair dame,
for whom they have perilled all that knight or
Christian may hold precious for the safety of
body and of soul."</p>

<p>"Peace and good rest to you all, my dame
and maidens!" said the lady in whispering

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

tones from her silken couch. "None of you
have read my riddle. She sleeps sweetest and
deepest who sleeps to dream of her first love&mdash;her
first&mdash;her last&mdash;her only. A fair good
night to all. Stay thou with me, Claudine,
and touch thy lute, wench, to the strain of
some old ditty&mdash;old and melancholy&mdash;such
as may so softly usher sleep, that I feel not
his downy fingers closing mine eyelids, or the
stilly rush of his pinions as they sweep my
brow."</p>

<p>Claudine prepared to obey, as the lady sunk
to rest amid softened lights, subdued odours,
and dying melodies. A silver lamp, richly
fretted, suspended from the raftered roof,
gleamed faintly on the splendid bed. The
curtains were of silk, and the coverlet of
velvet, faced with miniver; gilded coronals
and tufts of plumage shed alternate gleam
and shadow over every angle of the canopy;
and tapestry of silk and silver covered every
compartment of the walls, save where the uncouthly
constructed doors and windows broke
them into angles, irreconcileable alike to every

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

rule of symmetry or purpose of accommodation.
Near the ample hearth, stored with
blazing wood, were placed a sculptured desk,
furnished with a missal and breviary gorgeously
illuminated, and a black marble tripod, supporting
a vase of holy water; certain amulets,
too, lay on the hearth, placed there by the
care of Dame Marguerite, some in the shape
of relics, and others in less consecrated
forms, on which the lady was often observed
by her attendants to look somewhat disregardfully.
The great door of the chamber
was closed by the departing damsels carefully;
and the rich sheet of tapestry dropt over it,
whose hushful sweeping on the floor seemed
like the wish for a deep repose breathed from
a thing inanimate. The castle was still,
the silver lamp twinkled silently and dimly;
the perfumes, burning in small silver vases
round the chamber, began to abate their
gleams and odours; the scented waters, scattered
on the rushes with which the floor was
strewn, flagged and failed in their delicious
tribute to the sense; the bright moon, pouring

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

its glories through the uncurtained but richly-tinted
casement, shed its borrowed hues of
crimson, amber, and purple on curtain and
canopy, as in defiance of the artificial
light that gleamed so feebly within the
chamber.</p>

<p>Claudine tuned her lute, and murmured the
rude song of a troubadour, such as follows.</p>

<div class="small">

<h3 class="center">Song.</h3>

<p>SLEEP, noble lady!&mdash;They sleep well who sleep in warded
castles. If the Count de Montfort, the champion of the
church, and the strongest lance in the chivalry of France,
were your foe, as he is your friend, one hundred of the arrows
of his boldest archers at their best flight would fail to reach a
loophole of your towers.</p>

<p>Sleep, noble lady!&mdash;They sleep well who are guarded by
the valiant. Five hundred belted knights feast in your halls;
they would not see your towers won, though to defend them
they took the place of your vassals, who are tenfold that
number&mdash;and, lady, I wish they were more for your sake.
Valiant knights, faithful vassals, watch well your lady's
slumbers; see that they be never broken but by the matin
bell, or the sighs of lovers whispered between its tolls.</p>

<p>Sleep, noble lady!&mdash;Your castle is strong, and the brave
and the loyal are your guard.</p>

<p>Then the noble lady whispered to me through her silken

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

curtain: 'A foe hath found his way to me, though my towers
are strong, and the valiant are my guard, and the brave and
the beautiful woo me in song, and with many kissings of their
hands.' And I asked, what foe is that?&mdash;The lady dropt her
silken curtain, and slept; but methought in her dreams she
murmured&mdash;'That Foe is Love!'</p>

<br/>

<p>THE next day after the arrival of the crusaders,
when a brief mass had been said in the chapel,
a kind of war-council was held in the great
hall of the castle of Courtenaye. The Lord
of Courtenaye himself (<i>dextra frigida bello</i>)
presided at it, to accustom himself to the
dreaded sight of Paladour. The deliberation
was deep and anxious; it was obvious that the
Albigeois, crushed and scattered as they were,
were still formidable, as a band of them had
so lately, though unsuccessfully, attempted to
make their way to Arragon. They might be
aided by similar parties from the mountain

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

fastnesses; and those who were dispersed
through the cities of Languedoc might rise
in support of their brethren; and thus the
defeat of a feeble and unarmed outpost might
operate as a signal to raise the inhabitants of
the most populous and cultivated territory in
France.</p>

<p>The abbot of Normoutier and the majority
were therefore for crushing all who resisted at
a single blow, without mercy, hesitation, or
delay; and they urged their present state of
terror and weakness as the most opportune
for striking such a blow, when a slight skirmish
on the preceding day had made their
bravest bite the dust. Others urged the expediency
of tarrying till King Philip had disembroiled
his affairs with King John of England&mdash;till
the result of the Count of Toulouse's
negotiation with the Pope were known&mdash;or,
finally, till the arrival of Count Simon de
Montfort, who, with his forces, was expected
every hour; and this (as they represented) less
from their need of his aid, than from their
fear of offending that powerful lord, the

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

favourite of the Pope, the rival of his sovereign,
and the chosen champion of the armies
of the church.</p>

<p>During the debate, while the Lord of Courtenaye
sat pale and balancing between the fears
of having his castle deserted and the charges
attendant on the protracted sojourn of the
crusaders and their followers, a horn was
sounded at the gate, and letters from Rome
were delivered by a kneeling messenger to the
bishop of Toulouse, who retired to a distant
window to read them.</p>

<p>From the moment of their perusal, the
bishop sat silent and abstracted during the
debate, shaking his head when appealed to,
and tracing with the end of his crosier shapeless
figures amid the rushes on the floor.</p>

<p>At length, roused by the repeated cries of
"My lord, we lack your counsel"&mdash;"My
lord of Toulouse was not wont to spare in
giving sharp counsel against the heretics"&mdash;"My
lord of Toulouse was wont to deal with
the brand, not the crosier"&mdash;"Yea," quoth
the abbot of Normoutier, "for what was my

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

censure&mdash;let us crush them at a blow&mdash;<i>non
vi, sed s&aelig;pe c&aelig;dendo</i>." Thus urged, the bishop
of Toulouse, with evident reluctance, spoke of
the expediency of a brief delay. Mortified
pride and disappointed passions struggled
through his extorted confession, and were obviously
the causes of its having been so long
withheld. Yet not even under circumstances
the most unfavourable did his deportment lack
dignity, or his arguments plausibility.</p>

<p>He said, that till the pleasure of the Pope
was known through the legate, now on his
way to France, it were perilous to proceed
further in the matter; and he added, as
matter of confidence, that the legate's counsels
were perchance too much under the influence
of an obscure ascetic, an eremite whom men
called the monk of Montcalm, who held
preaching to be a better means of converting
the heretics, according to the mode of the
blessed St. Dominic, (founder of the order of
Dominican preachers,) than the lances and
swords of crusaders. "Yet let us yield,"
concluded the bishop, "to the will of the

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

holy father; thus by a timeous delay we shall
win his approbation, and avoid all shadow of
offence to the champion of the church, the
valiant Simon de Montfort, who might grudge
to see the harvest reaped to his hand, before
he had put in his own sickle. And we will
also relieve our noble host from the fear of
having his towers besieged by the heretics;
for, ere three days elapse, the warder's horn
shall blow a blast from his highest battlement,
as he descries the advancing army of Simon
de Montfort; and that blast will be echoed by
the trumpets of the champion of the church,
with all his famed and fair array glittering on
the mountains that tower and frown through
yonder casement."</p>

<p>Loud and deep murmurs were heard in the
hall at the bishop's words, though all, from
their knowledge of his warlike, ambitious, and
impetuous character, felt they were extorted.
Some exclaimed they were betrayed; some
that they were deceived and dishonoured;
and the rest, indignant alike and weary of
the perpetual vacillations and compromising

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

spirit of the papal councils, swore they never
would clasp gorget or draw brand again while a
sort of halting priests, whose missives might be
months in reaching them, were to determine
on the chance of blows that must be struck
within the hour, and their echo never heard in
the Vatican.</p>

<p>The tumult of voices and of passions rose
and raged louder and fiercer every moment,
while the Lord of Courtenaye trembled, and
the ecclesiastics attempted to mediate in vain.
"Hot lords," exclaimed the one party, "be
more restrained; is it thus ye show your
reverence for holy church, whose champions
ye vaunt to be, by defying the authority of its
holy head in the teeth of his own missives?"</p>

<p>"Craven knights, recreant crusaders," retorted
the others, "we best show our regard
for the interests of the church when we defend
them at peril of our lives, even though its
head seems to have forgotten them."</p>

<p>The abbot of Normoutier, meanwhile, whose
voice had little weight in the assembly, but
who appeared in full costume of crosier, ring,

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

and mitre, raised his weary eyes often to the
windows; and, as he saw the shadows fall far
eastward, wondered how men could waste time
in wild debate while the meats were cooling;
and felt disposed to answer those who occasionally
sought his opinion (more from deference
to his rank than his judgment) somewhat
in the style of the honest priest in the 'Fop's
Fortune,'&mdash;"In truth, unless some one be
married presently, dinner will be cold, and
then&mdash;nobody will be able to eat it:"&mdash;while
the bishop of Toulouse, who had his own
reasons for keeping on terms with the court
of Rome, and yet felt deeply the personal
indignity of being held dependent on the
counsels of the legate, governed, as he admitted
they were, by an ascetic monk whom
he affected to despise, sat indignant and
sullen, enjoying the storm that gathered and
growled around him, and deeming the hour
was not far distant when he might grasp its
collected thunders in his hand, and, while
they rocked the towers of the Vatican, make

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

the roar rebellow through every court in
Europe.</p>

<p>The debate had now reached a pitch of
wrath and fury, when the sound of horns
was once more heard at the gates of the
castle; and the crusaders, like steeds reined
up and foaming for battle, (who, at the sound
of the trumpet, stand for a moment with ears
erect and eyes on flame, arching their noble
necks and champing their bits,) paused, fretted
and impatient for the tidings.</p>

<p>They had long to wait for them, and fiercely
their impatience brooked the delay; while a
wearied horseman rode slowly into the castle-yard,
and, seeking the hall with the heavy
step of one toil-worn and foredone, his steel
sandals making heavy measure to his tread
along the paved passages, after he was refreshed
with a deep draught, told for truth
the certain tidings of the arrival of Count
Raymond of Toulouse in France: but whether
he was content to sit down with the spoliation of
his domains and the dispersion of his vassalage,

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

or to rise in aid and rescue of both, the narrator
knew not.</p>

<p>The effect of this intelligence on the assembly,
divided as they were, was single and
simultaneous. All, in spite of his vacillating
character and compromising spirit, dreaded
the power and presence, the exhaustless resources,
and undiminished popularity of Raymond
of Toulouse;&mdash;reconciled to, or at feud
with, the Pope, they felt his presence was
equally formidable to them; and at the tidings
the loudest became silent, and the boldest
were awed. Some apprehensions too, according
to the superstitions of the age, were
mingled with their dread of the recent intelligence,&mdash;for
all believed Raymond of
Toulouse held communication with infernal
powers, and forbidden arts as a heretic; and
those who had most fiercely urged the necessity
of immediately exterminating the heretics,
began to wish for further delay in the matter,
till the legate's pleasure were known; and even
accused themselves of bringing, by their irreverent

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

language used against the Pope, a
judgment on the land in the return of Count
Raymond,&mdash;an impression which, it must be
acknowledged, the ecclesiastics took no particular
pains to efface.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Paladour mused on his
meeting with the stranger on the heath, and
deemed it was not impossible that Count Raymond
and he had met before, though under
circumstances so strange and shadowy that
they now crossed his memory like a dream:
while the Lord of Courtenaye, weary of a
debate where he had no share, and of a scene
where he sustained no part of dignity, seized
the first moment of tranquillity to command
the doors of the banqueting hall to be thrown
open: the seneschal, with his silver wand,
advanced; the pages and sewers stood in
prompt attendance; and Paladour, forgetting
the past, and compromising for the dreaded
future, felt his whole frame thrill with delicious
tremblings, as the order was obeyed.
The lights, the luxuries, and the splendour of

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

the banquet,&mdash;splendid as that age of feudal
power could invent or furnish, made strong
contrast to the gloomy hall&mdash;the fierce and
protracted debate&mdash;the interchanged pledges
of mortal defiance&mdash;and, finally, the tidings
that spread doubt and consternation among
them all.</p>

<p>It was a proud and yet softening sight, to
see how the most fierce and evil passions that
can disturb the frame and agitate the mind of
man, even when those frames are as adamant,
and those minds fit tenants for such mansions,
bowed and humbled themselves in the presence
of female beauty. As the knights crowded
into the banquet hall, "the might, the majesty
of loveliness," displayed in the form, the array,
and the lofty courtesy of the Lady Isabelle,
hushed every ruder sound, and dispelled every
fiercer feeling. Men forgot they were foes
while they looked at her; and those who had
not felt enmity, wondered it could ever be felt
on earth while such a being trod its surface.</p>

<p>The command of her uncle had summoned
her again the banquet; but, from the splendour

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

of her habit, her damsels guessed that
the command was not reluctantly obeyed:
and as the crusaders filled the hall, she bowed
with such lofty submission&mdash;she greeted with
such gentle stateliness&mdash;her lovely swan-like
neck was curved with such majestic yet winning
undulation&mdash;her sunny eyes flashed such
brilliant yet chastened light on all who bowed
within the sphere of their radiance&mdash;that the
elder knights, like Priam's counsellors on
another occasion, swore, that a ten years'
crusade were better waged in the cause of such
beauty, than against the rascaille Albigeois
for a day;&mdash;while the younger testified their
devotion by swearing certain fantastical vows,
which the lady annulled as soon as they were
uttered, and smiled in gay disdain on those
who imagined she could ever be plaintiff or
defendant in the court of <i>les arrets d'amour</i>.</p>

<p>The knights then flung themselves on the
rushes and tapestry at the lady's feet, and
sought her attention by modes of courtship, so
long exploded, that the tale would be tedious
to modern ears. In that vast assembly there

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

were but two individuals who beheld the proud
sight of power, rank, and valour, prostrate at
the feet of beauty, with indifference or with
reluctance. The Lord of Courtenaye, who
murmured to himself,&mdash;"While that witch
can spell within her circle of beauty all that
is noble and valiant in France, these towers
may defy the fiery arrow; but&mdash;&mdash;" in involuntary
agony he clenched his hands, then
instantly, with strong effort unclasping them,
extended them with a graceful action of hospitality
towards his guests, as he seated himself
at the board end.&mdash;And the abbot of Normoutier,
who, puffing in the rear, and telling
his beads, repeated incessantly,&mdash;"Oh for
the quiet of mine abbey, where vigils, matins,
vespers, nocturns, and lauds, were not more
duly observed than the hours of refection and
rest, or indeed so well attended! Our Lady
speed me in safety from these warlike counsels,
or rather counsel-like wars, where men have
no appetite but for cold steel, which would
clean spoil both appetite and digestion with
me. Good fellow, I pray thee, break up that

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

pasty!&mdash;nay, stand not on bowing and tarrying
for sewer or carver; I am a humble
churchman, and bound to take with gratitude
the bounty of the founder. Ha! before God,
an excellent and well-devised condiment&mdash;somewhat
overdone though. Holy St. Bruno!"&mdash;he
exclaimed, after having dealt with the
pasty, wiping his beard with a napkin, and
looking round on the younger knights&mdash;"Holy
St. Bruno! what fools men be! after a day of
fasting that would have tried the stomach of a
friar of Camaldoli,<sup id="ref017"><a href="#en017">17</a></sup> and an uproar that would
have silenced a conclave of Cardinals or a
synod of Dominican preachers, even with the
wind in their favour,&mdash;with good cheer before
them, these youths turn from it to be eye-fed
on a woman's favour.&mdash;A cup of wine, I pray
thee!&mdash;stint not till I bid thee; my tongue
cleaves to my palate with ruling the stormy
counsels of this day;&mdash;fill it again, I tell
thee!&mdash;uttering much wisdom hath made me
thirsty, and commanding those enchafed spirits

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

hath so chafed my blood, that it will require
more than that flagon to cool it."</p>

<p>Paladour, who had mingled among the
crowd of the crusaders, placed himself near
the entrance of the hall, to observe the effect
that his presence might produce on the Lord
of Courtenaye,&mdash;many motives mingling in
his purpose; and, perhaps, the most powerful
being that of discovering the secret of his
destiny by some look, word, or movement;
for those who, like him, are mysteriously
wretched, place a wretched dependence on
mystery for its development. So he stood
near the door-way, when the cry of the pages,
who bore cushions for the seat and footstool
of their lord, was heard,&mdash;"On before my
masters!&mdash;on before!&mdash;room for the Lord of
Courtenaye!" At that moment Sir Paladour
stood almost beside him, erect, lofty, and
fixing on him eyes whose expression could
neither be shunned nor mistaken. The Lord
of Courtenaye had evidently screwed not only
his courage but his countenance to the sticking
place; for he passed Sir Paladour with a

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

graceful wave of his hand and a smile somewhat
livid, and instantly hastened forward.
At that moment the bright vision of the Lady
Isabelle rose on his view; and almost cursing
the stormy clouds that, for ever crossing his
soul, hid from it that lovely light, he was
about to approach her where she sat, when
seeing her so splendid in her array, and so
gallantly attended by kneeling knights, that
the floor seemed carpeted around her by
glittering and graceful figures,&mdash;a feeling of
pride and diffidence struggled in his breast,
and almost suspended his respiration, while it
gave added lustre to the burning hue of his
cheek and the dark glory of his full and flashing
eye. It is certain that love, in its first operations,
is very unskilful, and even self-frustrating;&mdash;the
splendour by which Isabelle believed she
might excite her lover, repelled and even
offended him; and the diffidence which is
the strongest proof of masculine devotion,
appeared to her like the effect of indifference
or disdain. Thus they remained, with eyes
averted, speech suppressed, and hearts burning

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

for the communion which pride withheld
each from seeking. Sir Paladour shrunk back
among the crowd of guests, and again he felt
his shoulder touched by old Sir Aymer, and
his ear assailed by his rough but well-meant
jocularity. "What! thou art equipped then,
<i>cap-&agrave;-pied?</i>&mdash;Look to thy doublet; an' mine
do not prove it a recreant, there is no faith in
satin. Lo, yonder is the Venus of this mortal
sphere!&mdash;but your schoolmen tell us your
Venus had a hankering after a senior called
Anchises. Look to thyself."</p>

<p>"I am not in the mood for jest," said Paladour,
who felt the mingled irritation of habitual
melancholy, and incipient, though almost unconscious,
jealousy. "I pray thee, who are
those who press so boldly around the lady?
Methinks I have seen them before, though not
flung on rushes at the feet of beauty, and
glistening in broidered cloaks and doublets of
tissue?"</p>

<p>"The chief of them," said Sir Aymer, "are
Sir Ezzelin de Verac and the Sieur de Semonville,
both inveterate suitors of the Lady Isabelle.

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

Were a herald to blazon them, he
would tell thee they were men of puissance,
birth, and valour; but <i>I</i> tell thee they are
fools&mdash;yea, fools of the first head. He who
hath seated himself on the cushion at the
lady's feet, is a knight, sir, of carpet and
tapestry; marry, he was engendered of silk
and velvet, and holdeth high respect to his
parents, but he forgetteth his maker&mdash;a tailor!
He kisseth his hand to the mere dissolution of
his fingers; and, for their resurrection let his
next mistress answer, or furnish him at her own
expense. His hose and doublet are of such
orthodox cut, that he may defy the inquisition
even of St. Dominic, unless some Italian
minion of the new legate, full of fresh-imported
vanities, pronounce it heresy; then will he
straight doff his apparel, and thou shalt see
him a true convertite to the creeds of gallantry
newly devised in a conclave of the coxcombs
of Verona or Genoa. For thy further despair,
know, thou man of misery, that his tags
are of silver gilt, and his pantoffles (I tell thee
in sad and solemn secrecy) studded with pearl

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

and braided with gold. I bribed his page for
the tidings, that I might overwhelm thee
withal."</p>

<p>"These are fearful odds," said Paladour,
smiling; "yet this Sir Vanity hath valour
withal. He did good service at the siege of
Andely; and I saw him make into the thick
of our bloody feast but yesterday."</p>

<p>"Tush! tell not me of valour!&mdash;what care
I for courageous coxcombry, or, at the best,
coxcombical courage? He flourished his brand
in pure vanity, as if it were a lady's favour.
Tell not me of the valour of one who, if you
hold talk with him of a field, turns on you
with, 'Sir, I was not supervacaneous in that
<i>hostium congressu:</i>'&mdash;'Sir, at the spoliation
of that castellum, I wore as a favour a glove
bestowed on me by the noblest hand in France&mdash;I
nominate not Queen Ingelberg&mdash;marry, fie
on my precipitant precocity, or rather precocious
precipitancy!' "</p>

<p>"Does he dare," said Paladour, with kindling
eye and cheek, "to boast of favours received
from the Lady Isabelle?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

<p>"Tush! he never lies under a queen or a
princess&mdash;hold thee content; then will he
say of a field where he bore himself; right
valiantly, 'Yea, sir, I was there, and wore
that day my lilac scarf purfled with gold; I
may not say whose fair fingers wove and wound
it around me.' And thus he talketh&mdash;numbering
his battles and sieges by the plumes and
trinketry he was arrayed in; and deeming
more of the feathers in his crest than of the
banners he rends from besieged battlements&mdash;and
of the hue of the scarf he wears, than of
how blazed the red and gold of the oriflamme
of France, when her chivalry fought round it
only to bleed and die."</p>

<p>"Yet he did good service at that fearful
and prolonged siege," said Sir Paladour.</p>

<p>"So did that figure," said Sir Aymer, pointing
to De Semonville, "who looketh as if he
were carved out of a trencher, and the instrument
had been a wooden knife: but, by Corpus,
though he looks all wood, it is touchwood; he
will be quarrelling, though it were with his
shadow; and men say they will not walk with

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

him of a sunny day therefore. Every man
hath something great to which he is born,
and the genius of the Sieur de Semonville
inclineth him most especially&mdash;to kicking. He
keepeth dogs, not to course with, but to kick;
he kicks his pages if his points be not well
trussed&mdash;his chaplain, if he be over-long at
mass&mdash;his sewer, if he break not up a capon
handsomely. He is a Herod&mdash;a very Herod.
He will deflower a scullion's lockram, rend a
menial's doublet in twain, pluck a herald's
tabard over his shoulders if his trumpet rung
too loudly in his ears;&mdash;and should he wed
the Lady Isabelle, let her set her carkanet
aright, or look to her white throat, lest it be
twisted on her shoulders."</p>

<p>"And these are my rivals!" said Paladour
mentally&mdash;"a coxcomb and a fool&mdash;a peevish
fool!"</p>

<p>"Why, what the devil standest thou muttering
here for?" cried Sir Aymer; "advance&mdash;approach
the lady; thy sight will not make
her swoon as it did her kinsman last night.
Udsfoot! to see the boys of this age!&mdash;they

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

lack liver, blood, heart, and vitals; they are
excuterated. Wert thou my son, and thy
mother the chastest dame in France, I would
pronounce thee bastard. Were I like thee,
I would ere this have seized her white hand,
assaulted her lip, carried by storm or mine
her heart, body, and soul, and made the
fortalice surrender ere it knew whose trumpet
summoned it: on&mdash;on, I say, thou recreant!"</p>

<p>"I care not to contend with fops and fools,"
said Paladour, retreating proudly.</p>

<p>"Now, by Heaven," cried Sir Aymer, "thou
exceedest in thy folly even that Amirald, who
shuns these towers because he was a page
here and had a quarrel with his lord;&mdash;on, to
the lady, I say! Hear the language in which
her suitors woo her; and if thine make not
better music in her ear&mdash;&mdash;He heeds me no
more than I would one of mine own age,
were I of his. How opinionated and singular
the boys of this age have grown!"</p>

<p>"Urge me not thus," said Paladour dejectedly;
"they are men, as thou saidst, of puissance,
birth and blood, rich revenue and noble descent.

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

What am I?&mdash;a landless knight, and
nameless&mdash;birth, descent, alliance, all unknown."</p>

<p>"All the better," quoth Sir Aymer; "the
lady can imagine them&mdash;she can trace thee up
to Charlemagne, or King Arthur of Britain&mdash;him
of Elfland: on, on, I say! by Heaven,
she hath sent a lure to thee twice; she hath
glanced in thy direction&mdash;dropped her kerchief&mdash;her
fan, and received them with an
absent negligence. Again she looks in thy
direction&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a negligent disdain," said Paladour.</p>

<p>"God's wounds!" exclaimed the incensed
knight, "with a disdain of <i>thy</i> negligence,
thou meanest. Wert thou of another sex,
St. Francis might have spared his wife of
snow&mdash;thou wouldst have quenched him in
a twinkling. Wilt thou yet approach the
lady?&mdash;Death, that boys can thus brave
a thousand men in the field, and shrink before
a single female&mdash;a thing made of silks and
smiles, paintings, pouncings, fopperies, fooleries,
treacheries, and heartlessness!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

<p>"And why dost thou push me on such a
shore?" said Paladour, forcing a smile as he
advanced.</p>

<p>"To see thee wrecked&mdash;that is all,"&mdash;whispered
Sir Aymer. "Now listen how those
fools are beating about the rocks: if thou
utter not better reasons to the lady's ear and
taste, I hold thee no better than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But where must I place me?" said Paladour,
hesitating, but still advancing.</p>

<p>"Why, curse thee! beside the lady's chair:
marry, show thine arm as thou leanest on the
drapery&mdash;it is well formed, and may prevail.
Doff thy cap; those curled locks win faster
on women's hearts than barrets of velvet,
and feathers set in aigrets of diamond. Now
mark what folly her suitors talk!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that I could utter even such folly!"
said Paladour, "since it seems to win her
ear."</p>

<p>"On, then!" whispered Sir Aymer; "a
woman's presence hath ever a marvellous
power in inspiring men to talk folly&mdash;and
act it too."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

<p>Thus urged, Paladour approached. The
Lady Isabelle, who, wearied, mortified, and
displeased at his apparent neglect, was listening
with an air of vacancy to her wooers, at
this motion raised her head; the attendant
damsels interchanged smiles behind the ample
drapery of her chair of state, on which they
leaned; the fan of feathers, borne by Dame
Marguerite, moved in <i>piu presto</i> time; and
Sir Ezzelin, who mistook the signal, pursued
his courtship to the lady "in good set terms,"
according to the fashion of his time, being all
as allegorical as John Bunyan, as "affectioned
an ass" as Malvolio, and as unintelligible as
most love-makers by profession have been from
the year 1216 to that of 1823; six hundred
years' grace being quite insufficient to restore
them to a solvency of sense. "Sir knight,"
said he, briefly recognizing Paladour as his
compeer at the siege of Andely, "encroach
not on the sad hours of a pilgrim who is now
journeying from the shrine of <i>mercy</i>" (a phrase
well understood in those days) "to the valley
of Malcontent. There the pilgrim wandereth,

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

failing of the shrine his vows were addressed
to; and there is he committed as a captive to
the custody of cruel jailors, whose names be
disappointed hope, defeated desire, darkful
doubt, and carking care. Anon, they have
their prisoner to a dungeon where his food is
<i>fel</i>, his atmosphere <i>suspiria</i>, his drink <i>lachrym&aelig;</i>,
and his companionship the thereon-sequent
amaritude of all discomfortable thoughts."</p>

<p>"Now," said the Sieur de Semonville internally,
as he sat on his bench in the perfect
perpendicularity of supreme awkwardness&mdash;"now,
would I might be hanged if I could
utter such a charm to my dogs when a witch
crosses me in coursing; marry, I'll beg it of
him, and try it with the rats, that do grievously,
as it were, infest my castle of Semonville:
my grandame's spell against them is not
worth&mdash;but I stifle its value for good manners'
sake." (All this was said <i>sotto voce</i>, and neither
De Semonville nor his hearers were a
whit wiser.)</p>

<p>"It is a dear happiness to ladies," said
Isabella, flinging back all the glories of her

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

sunny eyes, and winding her swan-like neck
towards her maidens as they bowed forward&mdash;
"it is a dear happiness to hear the praise of
their beauty in terms they cannot understand,
and to be wooed in a tongue they cannot
answer in. Sir knight of the bloody cross,"
she continued, averting her eyes, and speaking
as if she addressed an absent person, "how,
I pray thee, wooest thou thy lady-love?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know," said Paladour, quivering
in every limb, through which her accents
thrilled; "if she understood not the language
of mine eyes, I know none other in which I
dare address her with such force, such fervency,
such deep and burning devotion."</p>

<p>"But it might be that the lady skilled not
in such language," said Isabelle; "how, then,
wouldst thou fare?"</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Paladour, who
felt, as he spoke, inspired and carried beyond
himself; "her eyes were formed only to
breathe of love, to talk of love, and to inspire
love. Nor could she fail of an interpreter,
when all that those love-lit eyes could tell

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

lacked but the interpreter of her lips. Nay,
by Heaven, her eyes, were they but once turned
on me, would have lacked no interpreter;
for never did such light burn in mortal orbs&mdash;never
did such beams pierce mortal bosom."</p>

<p>"She must be wondrous fair," said Isabelle
pensively;&mdash;"was it for her beauty's sake that
the achievement was wrought which hath
placed thee among the first and fairest in
fame of Christian chivalry?"</p>

<p>"I had not seen her then," said Paladour,
"or&mdash;but I will not boast&mdash;since I have beheld
her, there is nought that mortal may dare
that I would not undergo&mdash;yea, accomplish&mdash;save
the desperate task&mdash;to tell her that I
love."</p>

<p>"And how shall the lady then apprehend
thy love, sir knight?" answered Isabelle, with
averted eyes, and subdued but most expressive
voice.</p>

<p>"If," said Paladour, "she feels it not from
my deep and reverential silence&mdash;from the dew
that gathers on my brow when I see her&mdash;from
the delicious trembling that deprives me

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

of all power when I approach her&mdash;from my
hatred of those I loved the dearest&mdash;my
loathing of food&mdash;my willingness not to sleep,
but to dream&mdash;my inaptitude to all warlike
exercise&mdash;from my fierce indolence, impatient,
yet melancholy, hating the voice of men,
even of my best-loved and heart-cherished
friend, yet crouching to catch a woman's
whispers, though it were her meanest damsels&mdash;from
my fearful indifference even to Heaven,
as, while I bow to the image of the Virgin,
but utter another name&mdash;if from my wildness,
worthlessness, irritation, and melancholy,
she knows it not,&mdash;then am I the most ill-starred
of lovers, and she of ladies the most
insensate."</p>

<p>"<i>O no, she is not!</i>" said the Lady Isabelle
half internally, and dropping her veil between
her and Paladour.&mdash;But these whispered words,
which he would almost have given his life to
hear, were drowned in the blasts of the warders'
horns that rung out from every turret of the
castle; not in that heavy tone that announced
the approach of the weary messenger from

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

Rome, but with that loud and lively blast that
harbingers a distinguished guest.</p>

<p>These sounds were soon echoed distantly,
but distinctly, by the trumpets of the party
whose approach the warders had descried.
The hall was hushed, and listening, "It is
the trumpet of the heretics, that seek to treat
for ransom of prisoners," said Sir Aymer,
laughing; "hast thou many to yield them,
Lord of Courtenaye?"</p>

<p>"Methinks it is the trumpet of the legate."
muttered the abbot. "Pray Heaven the ascetic
monk comes not with him; then will the viands
and flagons disappear in a twinkling.&mdash;Page,
fill my goblet ere the worst befall&mdash;higher&mdash;fuller,
I say! By Saint Benedict, one would
think the monk of Montcalm himself were
measuring my draught!"</p>

<p>"It is the trumpet of Count Simon de
Montfort" said the bishop of Toulouse; "I
know its sound."</p>

<p>Another moment removed all doubt; the
jarring and creaking of the ponderous draw-bridge
as it was lowered, the hollow tramp of

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

the men-at-arms, and the ringing hoofs of the
steeds of mounted knights, as the former
pranced and curvetted over its sounding arch,
were blended not unmeetly with the re-echoing
horns, blown shriller and louder as the object
of their salutation approached, with the trumpets
of the heralds, who advanced into the
court to greet him with the high ceremonial
of chivalric honour, and with those of the
noble stranger's train, which were drowned in
the war-cry of a thousand followers, knights,
squires, and vassals, all pealing in wild and
deep accordance, 'Simon de Montfort&mdash;<i>Dieu
et l'Eglise!</i>'</p>

<p>The heavy tread of armed steps was heard
approaching the hall&mdash;the folding doors were
expanded to their utmost limits by the pages&mdash;marshal
and minstrel, sewer and seneschal,
were all in their places to perform their appropriate
rites of ceremony&mdash;the guests rose from
their seats, and the Lord of Courtenaye was
gracefully carrying the cup of wine to his lips,
about to give as his pledge the health of De
Montfort, when the object of all this homage

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

strode into the hall; and following him like
skiffs in the wake of some mighty galleon,
came knights and squires of noble birth, with
their various trains of attendants; and, as they
floated on in a tide of gorgeous and gloomy
magnificence, seemed as if they entered the
castle rather as conquerors than guests. The
courtesy with which the company was prepared
to receive the champion of the church was
repelled by the uncouth and unnurtured fashion
in which he made his entry. Armed from
head to foot, and scanning the guests through
the bars of his helmet as he would the features
of a foe, he stalked to the board end of the
hall, like an iron tower that was moved by
some internal mechanism.</p>

<p>Arrived there, without greeting the lord of
the castle, or bowing to the lady of the feast,
he flung himself on a seat, and made signs to
his squires to undo his helm and gorget.
While this was performing, he growled internal
curses at their unskilfulness; and, rending all
asunder, flung the weighty pieces of armour
on the floor, and disclosed a visage that accorded

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

with the promise of his figure. The
latter was gigantic, of a clownish heavy make,
but unequalled in strength; the former were
coarse and inexpressive, but sometimes lit by
a gleam of rude jocularity, and oftener by a
glare of ruthless and savage ferocity. As he
flung his helmet on the floor, his heavy but
not undiscriminating eye rested for a moment
on the Lady Isabelle; and the omnipotence of
female beauty received at the moment that
homage of <i>instinct</i> which is perhaps the
most powerful, as it is the most sincere. As
he viewed the fair vision, the jaws of the
uncourtly gazer involuntarily expanded, his
cold eyes twinkled and rolled in their sockets,
and his vague and savage laugh indicated that
species of admiration, which, wanting words,
announces itself by a fierce and involuntary
delight. This rude homage paid, the Count
de Montfort began to give a glance of surly
recognition at the guests.</p>

<p>"My Lord of Montfort, we pledge you,"
repeated the Lord of Courtenaye, holding his
goblet high.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

<p>"I will do you reason, Lord of Courtenaye,"
answered the Count; "but first let me know
those who pledge me, as well as thee. Now,
by my faith, that star of beauty had almost
quenched my sight!&mdash;I drink to thee, Lord of
Courtenaye. And whom have we here?&mdash;Ha!
the lord abbot of Normoutier?&mdash;Nay,
then, all the fathers have taken the field in
one thick volume, and we may lay aside sword
and spear, and beat out the brains of the
heretics (if the Dominican preachers have left
them any) with mere books. But what say
the fathers to this, lord abbot?" he pursued,
in a tone of rude jocularity; "where be thine
authorities, thy citations and quotations, and
the devil knows what?&mdash;Nay, if thou lackest
motto for thy crusading banner, it shall go
hard with my Latin an' I do not furnish thee
with a meet one&mdash;'<i>qui ensem capit, ense
peribit</i>.' "</p>

<p>"I have thought of it," said the abbot
demurely, who sometimes blundered on a right
Construction; "but methought it savoured too
much of carnal vanity for a churchman; wherefore,

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

I pray you, cherish the motto for yourself."</p>

<p>"Sinful man that I am!" said De Montfort,
not heeding him, "and have I overpassed the
bishop of Toulouse?"</p>

<p>"Champion of the church!" said the bishop,
"champion of the church! we greet you well,
and give you the amplest benediction of the
cause, whose noble and approved soldier you
are."</p>

<p>The warlike savage bowed his head in short
reverence at these words; then raising it, and
shaking back his thick and uncombed locks,
"Now foul befall the meddling priests," he
exclaimed, "who put a mitre on thy head,
and a crosier in thy hand, when the one
should have borne the helmet, and the other
wielded the brand!"</p>

<p>"The sword of the church," said the bishop,
"is two-edged, and smiteth both ways."</p>

<p>"I wot it well," said the rude lord; "one
edge to scare the wolf, and another to shear
the flock. How now, lord abbot? Drain not
thy flagon so fast! I am sore athirst; and

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

thou, though a crusader against the heretics,
wilt not on such occasion deny the cup to a
layman?"</p>

<p>"By the bones of St. Benedict," said the
abbot, much incensed, "a most scurril and
profane jest, <i>lepid&egrave; ac facet&egrave; dictum!</i>"</p>

<p>"And who be these," said Simon de Montfort,
finishing his ample draught, "who cluster
round thy board, Lord of Courtenaye?&mdash;minstrels
or mimes, as it should seem by their
holiday array. What pageant, what device,
are they about to show us? Let them forth
with their foolery, that we may laugh."</p>

<p>The bishop in vain plucked the mantle of
the count; and the Lord of Courtenaye grew
pale with terror and anger, as, gazing round,
he saw Paladour's brow crimsoned to the roots
of his hair, the Sieur de Semonville (who was
choleric) lay his ready hand on his dagger,
and even the courtly Sir Ezzelin start from the
Lady Isabelle's footstool at this insolent sally.
"My Lord of Montfort," said he, "you do my
noble guests and me most heavy wrong; they
are the best and bravest of the crusading host.

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

Speak for yourselves, valiant knights; ye have
perchance met the Lord of Montfort at the
siege of Andely, and the battle of Bovines,
and other scenes which your memories can
better furnish than mine."</p>

<p>"Noble lord," said Sir Paladour, "if my
deeds speak not for me, I dare not be mine
own herald."</p>

<p>"Aye, I have heard of thee," said De
Montfort, scanning him under his scowling
brows; "thou wonnest knighthood by baptizing
a heretic brat, whom it were better deed
to have flung into the flames."</p>

<p>"King Philip, thy liege lord and mine,
deemed not so," said Paladour with modest
pride, "when he conferred on me the noble
rank of knight; the which I will maintain
(less for mine own sake than that of my
sovereign) in the teeth of him who avouches
it was lightly won or unworthily bestowed."</p>

<p>"By the mass, a brave stripling to ruffle
with pages in my lady's antechamber! Good
youth, keep thy wit warm and thy steel cold,"
said De Montfort, with a brutal laugh. "And

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

who be those gay companions who seem to
have dealt for their array more with the mercer
than with the armourer?"&mdash;and his eye rested
in scorn on the gorgeous habits of Sir Ezzelin
and De Semonville, while the Lord of Courtenaye
hasted to whisper their rank and names.</p>

<p>"Now, by my grandame's soul!" quoth
Semonville, "if he pass further gibe on me, I
have a foolish dagger here, that will not
long lack acquaintance with his unmannered
pate."</p>

<p>"Certes," said Sir Ezzelin, addressing the
lady as if in scorn of his assailant; "certes,
this rustical lord, or rather lordly rustic, resembleth
his visage (which courtesy itself cannot
term lovely) to some outlaw's hold; his eyebrows
are the bartizans, his nose the portal
tower, his upper jaw the portcullis; and when
the rusty trumpet of his tongue hath sounded
an alarum, out rush his words, not like a train
of courtly knights, but as a sort of ruffian
bandits to assail, and stab, and brawl."</p>

<p>"We, youth," said Sir Aymer, "are better
nurtured. Marry, the Lord of Montfort hath

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

a rude trick of the olden time&mdash;our forefathers
were but a discourteous race."</p>

<p>"Ha, old Sir Aymer," cried De Montfort
recognizing him, "art thou there? Marry, I
was much amiss not to seek for thee at the
first amongst beardless chins and gaudy
doublets&mdash;what, hast thou yet made peace
between those near neighbouring foes, thy green
head and gray beard?&mdash;never trust me an'
thou lookest not among those gay and gilded
youths like a roosted owl amid a cast of newly-bathed
falcons with their bells and bravery on&mdash;that
beard of thine waves like a scourge to
whip the boy Cupid from the very chamber
thou hauntest&mdash;get thee a scythe and hour-glass,
man, so thou mayest save the charges of
a wooden figure of time for an abbey clock, or
some old monument.&mdash;Thou make love to
ladies!&mdash;provide thee first a bright eye, a
curled head, a soft palm, and a straight back,
and thou mayest yet win the grace of my
lady's bower-woman to swear thee her servant
on the knot of her pantoffle; for trust me,
knight, even in thy better days (I should say

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

thine earlier), thy wit was all too unreclaimed
to pounce on nobler quarry."</p>

<p>"An' it were not less of a haggard than
thine, De Montfort," said the knight laughing,
but much irritated, "I would not fly it at the
coif of a country wench."</p>

<p>"But whereto tends this," cried De Montfort
without heeding him&mdash;"but whereto tends
this?" and he looked round with an amazed
disdain. "These be crusaders that sit around
me, as I guess by the crosses on their mantles,
and knights of birth and valour, as our host
speaks them (himself a meet judge of valour),
otherwise I might have guessed them for a
band of troubadours. What, am I summoned
to a battle or a banquet? The champion
of the church looked for other greeting in
these towers&mdash;where be the harness clattering
on the floor and the war-steeds neighing in the
court,&mdash;the clasping of gorgets and the closing
of helmets,&mdash;the grasping of brands and the
wielding of lances,&mdash;and all that glorious and
stirring invitation to the high-heaped feast of
battle that makes a warrior of a very coward,

<!-- vol 1 page 297 -->

and turns a warrior into a host? What, is
there an Albigeois left in Languedoc, that
the crusaders are sitting at a feast? My Lord
of Courtenaye," he continued, "when I
reached your castle, I deemed to see it moated
with the blood of the enemies of God, and to
note every knosp and pinnacle of your battlements
crested with a heretic head (the best
blazon they ever could boast); and now, what
see I?&mdash;a band of revellers&mdash;a masque&mdash;a
pageant: by Heaven, the Pope is sore deceived
in the trust he puts in these crusaders!"</p>

<p>"<i>Thou</i> art deceived, unadvised lord," said
the Bishop of Toulouse in a voice that stilled
even the turbulent and ferocious De Montfort;
"thou seest around thee men bound heart and
hand, body and soul, to the service of holy
church, and her warfare against her enemies.
What though they be garbed in satin, they
have felt the griding pressure of steel on head,
breast, and body ere now; moreover, noble De
Montfort," he whispered, "our hands are held
for a space&mdash;the Dalilah of the Vatican hath
bound the strong man&mdash;we wait for further

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

missives from the legate, or rather from his
concubine, who hath some foolish pity on these
Albigeois, being herself a native of Languedoc.
There is a monk&mdash;they call him the monk of
Montcalm&mdash;an ascetic&mdash;a very Eremite&mdash;a St.
Simeon Stylites, or whatever saint you please
to miscall him, who is inward with the legate.
He outpreacheth the Dominicans, worketh
miracles, and doeth such tricks that I dare not
quarrel with him for the value of my mitre.
The legate hath employed him to win a truce
between the heretics and us for a space&mdash;mark
me, for a space only. Now, in the name of
Heaven, lord, since, such reasons are uttered
to you, restrain your free speech, and do no
further offence to this fair meeting."</p>

<p>"It is well," said De Montfort, who appeared
slowly, but at length thoroughly, to apprehend
the bishop's reasons; "and my hand must then
be in the pasty, and not on my brand; but, mercy
of Heaven, what stuff is here!" striking down
with the hilt of his dagger a rich and luscious
confectionary, as if to avenge himself on inanimate
things&mdash;"a <i>sotiltye</i>, with streamers and I

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

know not what devices as high as a bannered
castle!&mdash;Bear it away, knave!" to the sewer.</p>

<p>"My noble guest," said the Lord of Courtenaye,
"there are more solid viands at
hand."</p>

<p>"Look that there be," said De Montfort rudely
to the attendants, without regarding his host;
"meanwhile fill me a cup of wine, and break
up that pasty (that seems as if it held venison)
to prepare the way for my next draught."</p>

<p>By this time the Lady Isabelle, shrinking
alike from this gross excess and obvious negligence
of her rank and sex, rose with her
female attendants to quit the banquet-hall,
polluted by the presence of the brutal lord and
his companions, who were fast following his
example in insolence and licentiousness.</p>

<p>"Stay, lady, stay!" cried De Montfort as he
saw her preparing to retire; "what, flying
without news from the courts?&mdash;how queen
Ingelberg sets her hood, and how many gems
her girdle is studded withal&mdash;meet tidings for
fair dames when uttered by courtier-lips like
mine!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

<p>"We will hear the court-tidings at our
better leisure," said the Lady Isabelle with the
dignity of offended beauty, "and we trust
your ample draughts of Malvoisie will not
have washed such precious matter from your
brains ere the morning."</p>

<p>"Marry! my tidings from the court will
brook no such delay," said the stern, lord, exalting
his voice to a pitch the ears of the proud
beauty were ill accustomed to&mdash;"I bear a
message from King Philip, which matters of
higher import had swept from my remembrance."</p>

<p>He rose with fierce action from his
seat, and while the Lady Isabelle, terrified
and incensed, stood pale and proud, averting
her looks, but delaying her departure&mdash;"Lady
of Courtenaye and Beaurevoir," he
cried, "I come to claim thee as the ward of
King Philip. He hath vowed thine hand to the
Lord of Auberval; and if his lands be not
broad as thine, or his coffers filled like yon
ample chests," (here the Lord of Courtenaye
cast a look of speechless agony on the chests

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

that then formed the principal furniture of
feudal mansions, and which in the hall of
Courtenaye were loaded with plate, gems, and
coin, so as almost to be immoveable), "I
pledged word, oath, and fealty, to deliver the
royal hest, and five hundred of my knights and
men-at-arms shall be thine escort to the court
of King Philip, though their absence cost me to
spare the lives of thrice that number of heretics&mdash;a
debt which this good arm and brand
shall soon redeem," and he brandished the
former as he spoke: "meanwhile," he added,
crossing the hall, "let me hail the future bride
of the Lord of Auberval."</p>

<p>The spirit of her high-descended race glowed
on the cheek and lit the eye of the noble
maiden, as, withdrawing her hand from his
touch, she exclaimed, with a strong but an ill-timed
allusion to the masculine and martial
propensities of certain females of the count's
family, "The dames of the house of De Montfort
may be won, like the Amazons of old, by
him who can deal the heaviest blows; but the
ladies of Courtenaye are to be won by other

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

suitors, and in different wise from those who
claim them as tributes to their liege lord."</p>

<p>Neither the incensed looks which the
younger knights exchanged as they half rose
from their seats, nor the majesty of insulted
and trembling beauty, touched the fierce spirit
of De Montfort.</p>

<p>"For my dame," he said with a hoarse
laugh, "I grant she can furbish a corslet, and
even wield a brand at need&mdash;good gifts in times
like these; but for thee, thou gaudy, delicate, disdainful
toy, what must I say to thee? This only&mdash;yield
thee to the will of King Philip, whose
ward thou art, and think not to strive with me.
Will thy skirt of tissue prove a fence against a
royal mandate, or thy braided tresses man thy
towers when the boldest of thy warders would
tremble at the summons of the royal trumpet?
Nay, dry thine eyes, lady&mdash;I promise thee a
bridegroom noble and valiant&mdash;the minion of
the king&mdash;the very Hylas of our royal Hercules,
as our school-bred courtiers phrase him;
what would woman in all her fantastic cupidity,
all her minstrel-taught visionry of loving

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

days and livelong nights, desire beyond such
offer?"</p>

<p>"Her liberty," answered the lady with a
voice of power that made her persecutor start
at the spirit he had raised. "Her liberty&mdash;that
liberty granted to the meanest cottage-dame
whose locks are hid by the coif, not
bound by the coronal&mdash;the liberty which I
would give to the daughter of the meanest serf
who lives under the shadow of the towers of
Courtenaye, to choose or reject her humble
partner. And shall such privilege be denied
to the daughter of the lordly line of Beaurevoir
and Courtenaye?"&mdash;and the pride and spirit of
her ancestry (the proudest of their day) seemed
to dilate her form, and inspire her looks as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest the law, or rather the will
of the king," said De Montfort doggedly; "thy
hand, person, and ample dower, are all at his
dispose, or thou must redeem the pledge perchance
at the price of half thy lands. The wars
against these heretics have deeply drained the
royal coffers; our liege hath also to watch the

<!-- vol 1 page 304 -->

movements of King John of England; and
other matters, which may not be told to a
lady's ear, have made King Philip willing to
transfer some of the heavy chests that cumber
this hall to make easy seats for his favourites
at Paris."</p>

<p>"Lord of Montfort!" said the Lady Isabelle
with that high-wrought energy of look, voice,
and resolve, which, though originating in fear,
has in woman all the effect of courage, "Lord
of Montfort! Bear back my greetings to the
king, and tell him thus, as thou art true knight&mdash;let
him take lands and living, towers and
towns&mdash;despoil my domains and enslave my
vassals; and then let him despair of bending to
his will the spirit of Isabelle of Courtenaye,
nor deem that her hand and her heart shall
ever be bestowed but upon him she deems
worthy of them, without consulting prince or
peasant on the bequest."</p>

<p>"Haughty terms and proud," said De Montfort,
biting his lip till the blood came to curb
his mood, "from a ward to her guardian and
her sovereign!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

<p>"Say," cried Isabelle, sinking on her chair
of state that trembled with her emotion&mdash;"say
from a persecuted but not powerless
female to her oppressor."</p>

<p>A murmur, like a rising storm, began to
stir and gather through the banquet-hall. The
crusaders, who had been prepared to behold
de Montfort with veneration, as the champion
of the church and their leader, and to greet
him with deference, as a peer of France and a
warrior of fame, felt both claims dissolved by
his insulting and brutal bearing towards a
lady. The Lord of Courtenaye could brook
his agony no longer.</p>

<p>"Fair niece," he said, "I pray you consider
you are a royal ward. I see how the
matter goes," he exclaimed, encountering the
eloquent flash of her dark eyes; "castle,
towers, and cities claimed by King Philip, and
the well-filled coffers fleeting, as if they had
wings, into the pouch of some velvet-clad
minion of the court. Fair niece, relent, and
save thee from confiscation, spoliation, and
the fiend knows what other terms the time

<!-- vol 1 page 306 -->

may devise for divesting thee of land and
seignory, worship, and wealth, and suitors."</p>

<p>"Nay, not suitors," said De Montfort;
"deemest thou not that were thy queenly
dower diminished to the value of a vassal's
ransom, thy lover would not still woo thee for
thy fair beauty's sake, Lady Isabelle?"&mdash;and
his voice assumed a kind of reluctant softness
as he gazed on her.</p>

<p>"Tell such a wooer," said the lady, now in
extremity between her dastard kinsman and
his fierce guest&mdash;"tell him that his unknightly
persecution will leave his bride landless, dowerless,
and houseless, ere she wed him; tell him,
moreover, that I am homely, disfeatured,
unnurtured as a peasant maiden, ungracious to
sight as a leper, or a dwarf hired to make
mirth for menials. See&mdash;see if I am not!"
and with that mixture of terror and pride that
predominates in the female mind even in extremes,
she raised her veil, and displayed the
resplendence of her unequalled beauty, at the
moment she required to be described as an
object of deformity.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

<p>This effort cost her much; for, repeating her
last words, she drew her veil over her face,
gasped for breath beneath its folds, and while
her high heart denied her the relief of a tear,
she felt as if she could have given the world to
shed one, <i>if it could be concealed</i>. She did
not swoon, nor did she weep, but a choked
and tremulous sob indicated the effort she
made, and how much that effort cost her.
The murmur deepened in the hall. The voice
of admiration and pity was heard in many
a mingled tone. The female attendants collected
round the lady, and dame Marguerite,
officiously removing her veil, muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"An' that Lord of Montfort be fit for better
than to play the Selvaggio in a masque, or the
devil in a mystery play, I am no true maiden!"
As she spoke, she eagerly rent away veil,
wimple, and kerchief, which her lady as eagerly
replaced; but in the moment that intervened,
the beauty of the noble maiden, agitated,
dishevelled, and suddenly exposed, touched
even the savage De Montfort.</p>

<p>He "grumbled pity," and muttered half

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

inwardly, "By the rood, an' I had deemed the
lady would have brooked the tidings so ill,
King Philip should have chosen other messenger!"
He added in a voice as if he wished to
give consolation, but knew not how&mdash;"That
the lady might yet at a desperate chance
redeem her person from the royal claim, without
the risk of land or wealth; and that had <i>he</i>
been her champion, he would have saved her
and her dower for the splinter of a spear, or
her fair beauty's sake."</p>

<p>"We thank you," said the lady, recovering
breath and speech by a strong effort, "we
thank you for valuing our beauty and the
splinter of a spear alike; at the same rate as
the latter, do we hold the Lord of Montfort's
courtesy. But thou seem'st to speak of a way
of deliverance; if such may be found, and we
with honour may accept it, we are willing to
hear it, even from the unwelcome deliverer of
King Philips behest."</p>

<p>"Marry! I know not well how to make my
discourse pleasing to ladies' ears," said De
Montfort, rocking himself on the bench where

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

he sat; "but if a noble bridegroom and all
courtly delights do thy fantasy such offence,
there is a way of deliverance, as thou termest it,
though scarce any may undertake that way without
certain peril, or accomplish it without loss of
life." It was said, that at these words certain of
the knights who surrounded the chair of the
lady recoiled. Perchance, her declaration
that she would forfeit land and dower ere she
would bow to the will of King Philip had
been but cold fuel to the flame of their passion;
and the condition of added mortal peril in her
cause was, in ordinary estimation, not likely to
rekindle it to a blaze. The Count de Montfort
went on&mdash;"Thy chance, I fear, is desperate,
lady; but to the tears of beauty I will not
refuse to tell it, desperate though it be. As I
parted from King Philip he said, as it were
jestingly, 'Thou wilt find that fortalice guarded
by many a strong warder&mdash;see thou do thy
devoir if my hest be disputed;' and I, answering
him in the same humour of mirth, replied,
'My liege, I will forfeit my head, if among the
suitors that besiege the castle of Courtenaye

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

and its fair wardress, there be one who in tilt
and tourney can unhorse me, or draw blood
from between the joints of mine harness.' If
such champion may be found among thy
gilded wooers, summon him, lady, in God's
name, to aid thine appeal, and here lies my
gage;" and as he spoke, he flung down his
glove of mail on the floor with a force that
made the hall resound, and the Lord of Courtenaye
rock and quiver in his chair of state.</p>

<p>"Gage for gage!" cried the Lady Isabelle,
flinging down her glove of silk with desperate
courage&mdash;"Gage for gage!"&mdash;the fall
of the soft light glove caused no sound, like
the clank of De Montfort's heavy gauntlet;
but ere the echo of the former had ceased,
Sir Paladour had seized it, and brandishing it
at De Montfort, announced his acceptance of
the challenge, "if the lady deigned to accept
such champion of her right,"&mdash;and he bowed
with blushing and deferential awe to the
fair being for whom he was perilling fame
and life.</p>

<p>"Valiant knight," said the lady, her cheek

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

glowing with a hue, and her form dilating to a
grandeur more than mortal, as she saw the
chosen of her heart, the first and boldest
assertor of her rights&mdash;"Valiant knight, I
accept thee for my champion, and God and
our Lady nerve thine arm to strike in the right
of the defenceless and persecuted! Meanwhile,
take and wear this favour for my sake;
and may it prove a shirt of mail to a breast so
hold and true!" And detaching an embroidered
scarf from her ivory shoulders, she flung
it round those of her kneeling champion.&mdash;Long
before this action of the lady, the
knights had started from their trance, and
a hundred voices claimed the combat in the
cause of the Lady Isabelle.</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;come all!" exclaimed their
giant-like antagonist, with a savage but gleeful
shout of defiance&mdash;tossing his huge arms like
the branched of an oak in a storm&mdash;"Mass!
it were mere sport to encounter scores of such
velvet bodies and heads of feather! I will
requite their new fence with certain convincing
touches of the old discipline of tourney&mdash;I

<!-- vol 1 page 312 -->

shall be but half-breathed to encounter a hundred
of such in the career, and toss them
about like tennis-balls&mdash;mine health lacks
such exercise. An' the court of the castle be
not strewed to-morrow with scarfs and surcoats,
plumes and favours, like a tapestried
floor, or the path of a royal pageant, say there
is no true manhood left in France."</p>

<p>"A boon, a boon, my Lord of Montfort!"
cried the Lady Isabelle, in a voice whose
wonted tone of imperious gaiety was exchanged
for one of anxious supplication.</p>

<p>"And of what boon may not so fair a
suitor be assured?" said De Montfort, involuntarily
softened.</p>

<p>"I claim as a boon," said the lady, "that
your combat in the encounter to-morrow be
the combat of Courtesy, not the bloody
and mortal fight &agrave; l'Outrance." And she
added, with a delicate and venial dissimulation,
"Heaven forefend that the noble blood
which should be cherished for the cause of
holy church, were spent in the cause of a
woman!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

<p>"Thou wouldst have found thy boon hard
to win," muttered De Montfort, "could I have
guessed its purport. Ho, minion!" he added,
in a tone of furious disappointment, to his
page, striking at the lady's glove rudely with
his foot, "take up that toy, hang it on some
pillar in the castle-court, and let him that
dreads to die shun to touch it with his lance
to-morrow.&mdash;Lady, I doubt that this fence will
prove sufficient barrier,&mdash;for how, in the
combat of courtesy that thou hast claimed,
can blood be drawn from betwixt the joints of
my mail? otherwise, my grant is bootless as
thy boon was trivial."</p>

<p>"I put my trust in Heaven," replied
the trembling beauty, raising her eyes
upward&mdash;a motion instantly followed by her
attendants, who devoutly crossed themselves,
uttering prayers to every saint for their lady's
rescue.</p>

<p>"For thee, boy," said De Montfort to Paladour,
"I will turn pedagogue to thy vanity;
and so whip this humour of valour out of thee,

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

that thou shalt turn as pale at the sight of a
lady's favour as thou wouldst at the array of
a bannered host."</p>

<p>"The hue of death must be on my
cheek," said Paladour, "ere it turn pale
at the voice of defenceless beauty, or the
stirring summons to battle;&mdash;for the former,
I need no instinct as man&mdash;for the latter,
I lack no spirit as knight&mdash;yea, knight
I say, and warrior, approved in a field where
thou foughtest not," he exclaimed, maddening
at the sight of De Montfort's cold and savage
sneer.</p>

<p>De Montfort sat amazed, if not awed,
by the power of a voice that pealed round
the hall, like "a trumpet with a silver sound;"
he set down his untasted cup, in which he
had been pledging the abbot of Normoutier,
and looked as if expecting the silent defiance
he was about to meet.</p>

<p>Sir Paladour, after again kissing the scarf
which the lady had bestowed on him, and
then proudly replacing it on his shoulders,

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

crossed the hall, and stood full opposed to
De Montfort, front to front, breast to breast,
and eye to eye; for the Count had risen from
his seat, and met this mute challenge of
physical strength, by confronting the frame
of an Atlas with that of an Antinous.
Neither of them spoke&mdash;their eyes only
darkly flashing, and deeply fixed on each
other, uttered a language more than audible&mdash;for
it was felt by the spectators&mdash;by the
latter the issue of the combat was already
anticipated, as they surveyed the contrasted
figures of the champions, who still stood
pleasuring each other with looks of mortal
defiance.</p>

<p>"Here break we off," said Sir Aymer,
who dreaded the further incensement of such
proud and fiery spirits&mdash;"and, lady, I will
hold myself honoured as a self-chosen marshal
of the combat of the field to-morrow; so please
you to accept my service&mdash;let the Lord of
Montfort, of all these nobles, choose the
other."</p>

<p>"Valiant sir," said the lady, struggling to

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

assume her wonted tone of stately courtesy,
"we thank you for the proffer&mdash;you will
doubtless do the devoir of an experienced
martialist.&mdash;For thee, Sir Paladour, we enjoin
thee, as our champion, to perform deep orisons
to thy saint to-night&mdash;we give thee this relic
to aid thy devotions," she continued, giving
him a silver box of curious workmanship and
exquisite perfume, containing a relic, in the
estimation of that age invaluably precious;&mdash;"and
in those devotions, forget not the name
of her whose fair possessions and fairer hopes
are trusted undoubtingly to the justice of thy
cause, and the valour of thine arm."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the lady, with her female
attendants, rose to quit the hall. Sir Paladour,
as bound by his lady's command, prepared to
retire in obedience to her will, tremblingly
conscious of the solicitude that betrayed itself
through her tone of ceremonious imperativeness,
and of the soft and subdued emphasis
by which she distinguished between her fair
possessions and her <i>fairer hopes</i>. He led the
lady to the door, through which she retired,

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

made a low obeisance to the Lord of Courtenaye;
and then advancing for a moment, flashed
the last light of his proud eye on De Montfort,
like the glance of a retiring storm, whose
thunders are hushed for a space, but menace
a swift return.</p>

<p>"The braggart is gone," said De Montfort
with a hoarse laugh, flinging himself on his
seat, and calling for more wine.</p>

<p>"Term him so when thou hast proved him
so," said Sir Aymer, whose superannuated
levity had not left him insensible to what in
those days would have been termed "a touch
of true valour," displayed by Paladour.</p>

<p>"He is a valiant knight and faithful crusader,"
said the bishop of Toulouse, who spoke
from the impulse that instinctively urged him
towards physical or mental power, however
discovered or developed, as a laborious and
skilful alchemist would cull a useful ingredient
for the alembic from which he hoped to extract
the gold-creating stone or the elixir of
immortality;&mdash;"nor would I, for my mitre,
lack the blaze of his cognizance in the van of

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

our battle, or the dint of his brand in its
heart, and heat, and centre."</p>

<p>At these words, that seemed to place no
difference between a new-made knight and
the descendants of countless nobles and warriors,
the murmur deepened round the hall;
and as a silent but emphatic answer to them,
one hundred shields, bright with blazonry,
traced from achievement, or tradition, blazed
in the eye of the bishop; and twice that
number of banners floated opposite to, above,
and around him, (the latter almost touching
his robes as he sat,) all bearing the
memorials of far-descended ancestry and of
valour, which has the power of uniting the
past with the future age, and calling on posterity
to echo the acclamations with which their
departed progenitors have hailed the might
and the memory of the brave. The bishop
was neither dazzled nor dismayed&mdash;above the
prejudices of his age, though unhappily not
above its vices; his commanding voice made
the advanced banners quiver in the hands of
those who held them, and thrilled through

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

the bosoms of some over whose heads their
proudest blazonry sparkled and floated.</p>

<p>"Valorous knights," he said, "noble peers&mdash;and,
if I may address you by a higher title,
champions of the church, and crusaders in her
sacred cause,&mdash;why spurn ye and scoff at a
single knight? Trace upwards but for a few
dark and perhaps fabled ages, and the foundation
of the proudest castle ye own rests for its
corner-stone on the grave of some sole distinguished
being, who, had he been not known
like this Paladour, never perchance had <i>ye</i>
been known, and ye would have had no need
to scorn at recent honours, having never known
what honour was. The first and proudest of
your line was one like this Sir Paladour, and
in him is concentred, dimly as it this day
shines, that glory, to whose pale and reflected
light ye look back through centuries for all
the lustre ye borrow while ye boast of. By
Heaven! I had rather be the bright and
salient fountain, bursting from the mountain
side, and sparkling in the eye of the traveller,
than the muddy stream that stagnates in its

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

course, neither reflecting light from heaven, or
bestowing fertility on earth, in its proud and
fruitless progress."</p>

<p>The tumult, if not appeased, was hushed at
these words, and each betook himself to the
topic of the morrow's encounter. Sir Aymer,
an expert tactician in the strategy of that age,
arranged with zealous but skilful officiousness
the ceremonial of the combat. The Count
de Montfort drained cup after cup, pledging
the bewildered abbot of Normoutier, who,
after doing him reason till he had nearly lost
his own, began to ask his crosier-bearer if the
Albigeois were at the gates, that there was
such an infernal ringing in his ears? De
Verac whispered sundry orders to his pages
and squire concerning plumes, gems, and devices,
and then murmured to Semonville,&mdash;"Thinkest
thou that faded scarf of the lady's
will bear comparison with that I wear to-morrow
of green (the colour of hope) purfled
with silver (the type of innocence)?&mdash;for I
would as it were be most emblematic and exquisite
in mine array."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 321 -->

"I think not at all of it," said his blunt
companion. "Mass! I am thinking more of
the hard knocks that will ring on my mail
to-morrow, than of a silken scarf that will
never brook their dint!"</p>

<p>"Oh! for a device!" quoth De Verac;&mdash;"some
quaint, curious, and absolute touch of
fancy inspire me now, and I will be its vowed
slave for ever!"&mdash;as he rushed from the ball
in a fit of amorous delirium <i>de re vestiaria</i>,
leaving, as Sir Aymer said, his funeral dirge to
be sung by all the tailors in France, and his
bones to be converted into the handles of fans
for ladies.</p>

<p>De Semonville followed, calling aloud on
armourer and squire; and the younger knights
hastened after, each with anxious and tumultuous
orders to their respective attendants. The
elder guests sat late; the Count de Montfort
continued to drink deep, fearless of the event
of the morrow; the bishop and the abbot were
not slack to pledge him, (the quotations of the
latter, always indistinct, having now the advantage
of being quite unintelligible;) while

<!-- vol 1 page 322 -->

the lord of the feast (who, while he gracefully
performed all the offices of a noble host,
sipped cautiously the goblet his kneeling page
presented to him,) sat with his eyes fixed on
an internal perspective,&mdash;the body of Paladour
breathless and bloody beneath the lightest
stroke of the lance of Simon de Montfort.</p>

<p>"She hath claimed the combat of courtesy
for her minion," he said to himself; "but so
speed me their heated blood and fiery spirits,
if it be not soon exchanged for mortal strife!
And then&mdash;and then," he murmured, "one
vision of peril and horror shall pass from
before mine eyes, and I shall be as though
I had never seen him."</p>

<p>The roar of the deep and late carousal,
mingled with the din of the armourers, the
orders of the knights, and the hurried preparation
of the menials and vassals for the
tourney to be held on the morrow, rung
through the castle the livelong night from
turret to rampart. Every individual felt excitement,
and assumed importance, from the
meanest wench and drudging horseboy,

<!-- vol 1 page 323 -->

through all the acclivities of the vast household,
to the busy page, the anxious squire,
the favoured minstrel, and the bower-woman,
to him whose life was suspended on the event,
and her whose liberty, wealth, and honours,
hung on the same precarious issue.</p>

<p>Marshal and minstrel, proud of their expected
functions, met with hastened step and
glad greeting: henchman and herald hurried
to and fro with hasty and tumultuous orders.
The most forlorn of the group were the pale
dismayed monks and priests, who formed the
corps of the bishop and the abbot, and who,
as they traversed the crowded passages to
their humble dormitory in the base-court of the
castle, uttered many a terrified "benedicite," (as
the rude war-men, in passing, pushed them
against piles of scattered armour and horse-furniture),
mingled with many a prayer for
their safe and speedy return to the placid
monotony of their conventual life. The din
and stir were not less in the court of the
castle, where the vassals, with their assistants,
toiled all night to prepare the lists, the

<!-- vol 1 page 324 -->

scaffolding, and the seats for the marshals,
and a canopied state (as it was called) for
her who was the judge of the combat.
They toiled the livelong night by torch-light,
to complete their work before dawn; and
till within half an hour of it, the sound
of axe and hammer, and the shout and
turmoil, were still ringing through the court of
the castle. This tumult, so wide, various, and
prolonged, was augmented, from time to time,
by the sound of bugles and clarions, that rung,
from distance to distance, for miles around
the castle; they were blown to summon or
warn the wandering troops of the numerous
crusading chiefs assembled in the towers of
Courtenaye. They seemed the echo of that
uproar returned from mountain, valley, and
heath; not a shout of La Croix Sanglante
and Dieu et l'Eglise was uttered within the
walls of the castle, but was overtaken by a
wild and wind-borne blast from without and
from far. On every side, for leagues around,
was heard the indistinct hum, or the thrilling
shout, the war-blast blown fierce and near,

<!-- vol 1 page 325 -->

or the far-echoed sound of the horn dying on
the distant hills. Through the depth of night
the very air seemed alive with the sounds of
martial preparation and highly excited feeling;
and a dim but tumultuous vitality seemed to
pervade the face of the country round, wrapt
as it was in darkness.</p>

<p>There was a deep contrast between this
fever of excitement amongst those who had
neither life nor fame to risk on the issue of
the combat, and the deep and lonely emotion
of Paladour, as, long unused to repose, he
paced his chamber till he was weary of the
effort, yet still more wearied at the thought of
flinging himself on that bed which gave no
rest. It is the peculiar character of all mental
diseases to be highly accelerated by external
accident or local excitement, and such was
his present state; the visions of his childhood,
the strange events of his growing years, the
mysterious pilot, the songs of Vidal, and, above
all, his own dark and troubled and antedated
recollections, rose and rolled like a dark

<!-- vol 1 page 326 -->

vapour over his soul. The image of the Lady
Isabelle came gleaming betimes, like a moonbeam
through stormy clouds; and he started
as a benighted traveller would when she bursts
suddenly on his sight, and then is as suddenly
lost:&mdash;the gleam was transient, the
gloom permanent and deepening. At this
moment his squire brought in the last piece
of his armour, which was to be worn on the
morrow.</p>

<p>"Will't please you survey it, sir knight?"
said the attendant, as he stood, torch in hand.</p>

<p>"It will do well," said Paladour, without
even glancing at it. "I pray thee now
remove thy torch, and thyself too&mdash;the moon
shines brightly through the casement."</p>

<p>"And she gives fittest light to madmen,
like thee," said the attendant, retiring.</p>

<p>Paladour again, and perhaps voluntarily,
for that is the chief error of a morbid and
wandering spirit, plunged himself into the
vision his attendant had interrupted. It was
broken by the moon being suddenly lost

<!-- vol 1 page 327 -->

in clouds. He awoke, his foot striking
against the armour, that was heaped in a
corner of his chamber, and at the same
moment his hand involuntarily touched the
relic the Lady Isabelle had bestowed on
him, and reminded him of the orisons he had
vowed to perform that night. "I have
neglected this too much," he murmured, "and
better, in my dark hour, had I oftener had
recourse to it. Sweet saint! then for <i>thy</i>
sake," he added, bending before the relic,
which he placed on the lofty window-seat,
(above which the bright moon gleamed,) as he
would on a tapered altar,&mdash;"Sweet saint!
for thy sake I pray that to-morrow my life
may be preserved, to save, what I value more
than life, thy peace, wealth, and honours;
and that mine arm may be nerved to smite
their rude challenger beneath the hoofs of
his steed."</p>

<p>While he spoke (as he long after told&mdash;whether
true or not he vouched not for, nor
required the hearer to believe it,) between the
emerging moon and him there came, as before,

<!-- vol 1 page 328 -->

a thin cloud; and as it wafted aside, there
seemed to lie on mist behind it a female
form, stretched as on a couch; her bosom
bare, and gashed with a deep and mortal
wound; her body and limbs, as the mist
floated on, wrapt in a shroud. Twice before
had that form been visible, but never so distinctly.
In childhood it had floated before
him a confused mass, something that he was
sworn to wound and slay, and that he often
smote the air to catch and grasp. In advancing
manhood, though the vision always
hovered round him, a cloud on his brow, and a
burthen on his heart, it had never been distinctly
revealed to him but on the night he
met with his mysterious pilot, and the evening
hour when he parted with Sir Amirald; but
he had gathered from horrid internal intimations,
that he was born, and sworn, to
be the sacrificer of some victim; that that
victim was to be a female, young and
beautiful. His mind and body collapsed alike
under this fearful visitation, and he fell, still
kneeling, but almost prostrate, before the relic,

<!-- vol 1 page 329 -->

whose fragrance scarcely revived his scattered
senses.</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven," said a soft
voice, "what orisons art thou performing;
or to what saint art thou addressing
thyself?"</p>

<p>"To none," replied the wretched youth.
"The saints and all good beings have, I
believe, renounced me. But whom am I to
invoke in thee?" he cried, rising without fear,
but not without surprise, at the sound of the
voice, as he turned. What could scarcely be
called a form, or any thing that embodies
itself to the eye, hung hovering in an upper
cavity of the chamber, from which, it seemed,
a panel had been removed. It stood, so
white, tremulous, and visionary there; that
Paladour addressed it, in the spirit of his preternatural
and wildly excited feelings; and
darkly and waywardly ruled existence.</p>

<p>"Speak thy message! If from Heaven, I
submit; if from other power or place, I defy
thee."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 330 -->

<p>"Neither of heaven nor earth," said the
vision, in a kind of sportive whisper, "but
so mingled of both, that the wisest doubt to
which we indeed belong&mdash;nay, we scarce
know ourselves&mdash;so are the celestial and terrene
elements mingled in us."</p>

<p>"Thou art some light damsel of the household,"
said the knight, restored to recollection,
and recognizing mortal tones, if not mortal
form, in the apparition&mdash;and who, moreover,
pure as he was proud, valued himself on
a virtue, then as indispensable to chivalry
as valour. "I pray thee, minion, avoid
my chamber, and betake thee to that of
some losel page&mdash;fitter place for thee than
this."</p>

<p>"Were mine the arm of man," said the
figure, in an altered voice, "it would thrust
that lie down thy throat, ere thou couchedst
lance against De Montfort in the lists to-morrow."</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven!" answered the
astonished knight, "what seekest thou? or

<!-- vol 1 page 331 -->

why art thou here in my chamber in such doubtful
guise, and at such unwonted hour?"</p>

<p>"To do the hest of the Lady Isabelle,"
answered the voice.</p>

<p>"Of the Lady Isabelle!" cried Paladour,
the fresh blood returning to his cheek, and
new pulses beating in every artery,&mdash;"Speak!
speak! and pardon me!"</p>

<p>"She wills thee&mdash;she prays thee,&mdash;" said
the vision, with many pauses, "to&mdash;forbear
the combat to-morrow with the redoubted and
invincible Simon de Montfort. She prays thee
not to trust to thy strength&mdash;thy skill&mdash;to
all that she would trust, were it <i>her</i> life that
were perilled&mdash;and&mdash;to forgive that fear,
that never sprung from hatred."</p>

<p>"Am I all so lightly held," said the knight,
"that thy lady repents to trust the redeeming
of her rights to mine arm? Tell her, to relinquish
the pledge were to avouch myself unworthy
of it;&mdash;and soothly say to her damsel,"
he added, "that Paladour, in risking his life,
risks not aught he loves or values."</p>

<p>"You wrong the lady's meaning," said the

<!-- vol 1 page 332 -->

voice, in a tone still more subdued, and struggling
with emotion; "it was from aught but
mistrust of your valour, or indifference to your
safety, that she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray thee, maiden," interrupted Paladour,
"give over this fruitless parley. Thy
lady hath trusted her right to the defence of
this arm; and weak as she may deem it, it
shall be hewn from my body ere I resign that
trust, more precious than life, save&mdash;to <i>her</i>
commands."</p>

<p>"Then <i>I</i> command thee&mdash;&mdash;" said the
vision; and the voice, which assumed its natural
tone, and the veil, which in her agitation had
fallen from her head, betrayed the Lady Isabelle.
She stood for a moment discovered,
and agonized at the discovery; then catching
up her veil, and throwing herself into the arms
of her maidens, who were at short distance,
waiting the event of the scene, she disappeared;
the panel closed as it had opened,
without a sound; and Paladour flung himself
once more before the relic, on which the
moonbeam emerged auspiciously, with feelings

<!-- vol 1 page 333 -->

that the purest religionist might participate,
the boldest warrior might envy, but the
most impassioned of lovers alone could understand.
His devotion was not long undisturbed.
Some inhabitants of the castle were
retiring to their apartments through the gallery
where his chamber lay; their loud voices
and reeling steps, bearing attestation to the
effect of the long-protracted revel. Amid
the last of the group, Paladour recognized
the voices of the abbot of Normoutier, and
the guide who had conducted them to the
castle, and who appeared to be attending the
abbot to his chamber. Part of their dialogue
was singular enough to catch Paladour's ear,
as he listened involuntarily.</p>

<p>"I pray thee have a more reverend care of
thy speech," said the abbot, with many a
hiccup, and an audibly titubating march. "How
near thou wast to betraying thyself to-night!"</p>

<p>"Or betraying thee rather, lord abbot,"
said his companion, who appeared to forget
all reverence due to the tottering dignitary.
"But fear not, lord abbot, the wage is won,

<!-- vol 1 page 334 -->

and the peril past; and thine shall be the
ample guerdon&mdash;thine shall be the red-deer
of unknown forests, and the vines of all Languedoc
shall shed their rich blood into thy
cellars exclusively&mdash;yea, and amen for ever&mdash;the
merchants of Bruges and Antwerp
shall ransom their silks with the velvets of
Genoa&mdash;the Jew shall resign to thee his
simple profit of eighty in the hundred&mdash;thou
shalt reign abbot of monopolies and usances&mdash;the
crown of king Philip of France shall
look dim before the gems that adorn thy
meanest crypt, and Queen Ingelberg herself
shall swoon with envy at the brocade that
covers the curtain before the host."</p>

<p>This was said in a tone that proved the
state of the attendant to be pretty similar to
that of the abbot.</p>

<p>"Go to!" muttered the abbot, "go to! thou
art drunk, fellow!&mdash;why canst thou not take
pattern by me?&mdash;Saints uphold me! here is a
step I did not see. A curse on this broken
pavement! it had well nigh overthrown me&mdash;hie
thee to rest, thou swine, and sleep off thy

<!-- vol 1 page 335 -->

drunkenness!&mdash;but first help me up this stair.&mdash;Now,
by St. Benedict, this is a miracle!&mdash;the
steps double as I ascend, and, moreover,
the walls grow narrower and narrower&mdash;every
thing is wrought in this castle by magic&mdash;I
was warned of it: send two of the friars to
assist me to my chamber.&mdash;I am well holpen
to trust to the aid of a profane laic, and an
excommunicate withal!"</p>

<p>"Trust to my shoulders," quoth the companion;
"place thy back against mine, lord
abbot, and 'tis as great or greater odds, that I
do not shove thee up the narrow stair, as that
the Lord of Montfort's lance do not pierce
through shirt and mail of that unnamed adventurer
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All that avails not," quoth the abbot.&mdash;"By
crosier and mitre, here I sit till I am fitly
aided to my chamber!" and he seated himself,
"suiting the action to the word," resolutely on
the stairs.</p>

<p>The companion, finding the case thus desperate,
and having other business to attend to,

<!-- vol 1 page 336 -->

flung the abbot across his shoulder, conveyed
him up the stair, threw him on the silken coverlet
of his sumptuous bed, without much heeding
his frequent invocation of St. Benedict, and
hasted again to the gallery, where the rustling
silks, the creaking shoes, and the waftage of
the fan, announced the presence of a female.</p>

<p>The mincing tones of superannuated flirtation
soon discovered dame Marguerite; and
sundry speeches of high-strained gallantry
passed between her and her companion, who
seemed to insist on escorting her, to her apartment.
The sounds, "Oh, sweet sir!&mdash;nay,
in sooth, it is too much"&mdash;were answered by,
"I am listed under the banners of the bold
knight, Love; and in his nape I assiege the
fortalice of thy beauty, sage Marguerite; thus
I tote possession of the palisadoes," kissing
the outspread fingers of the withered gouvernante,
"thus I overpass the fosse, guarded as
it is by the archers stationed in those bright
eyes; and thus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thus and thus," squeaked the dame, "but

<!-- vol 1 page 337 -->

I vow it must not be thus&mdash;I may be ruined,
<i>thus and thus</i>, and then what becomes of the
family?"</p>

<p>"Ungrateful Marguerite," said her companion,
evidently retreating with satisfaction
at the slightest repulse.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful, callest thou me?" said Marguerite,
"when to obtain this interview I have
counselled and instructed the lady to seek the
secret passage to the chamber of this knight-adventurer;
and where their parley will detain
her perchance an hour."</p>

<p>"Went she alone?" answered her companion.</p>

<p>"Alone!" exclaimed Marguerite; "not for
the world: two damsels went with her for
security&mdash;but come to my chamber, and thou
shalt hear more."</p>

<p>"Would," muttered her companion, "that
two damsels were with <i>thee</i> also, for <i>my</i> security;"
and the voices died away in whispers,
and the steps in lighter treading along the
gallery.</p>

<p>Paladour could have smiled at this folly,

<!-- vol 1 page 338 -->

(not knowing what deep purpose was harboured
beneath it), though he marvelled at
such disorder within the walls of a noble's
castle; but his rest and his disposition to devotion
were alike broken by the interruption.
He sat while the red gleams of the dying embers
were reflected from his armour, in deep
but not painful meditation, till the pale light
of an autumnal morning succeeded them; and
the shield, corslet, and cuisses, that had glowed
like heated iron, now returned a pale and
bluish gleam to the feebler light.</p>

<p>At the wished-for approach of dawn, Sir
Paladour summoned his squire; and after a
brief but earnest act of devotion, prepared to
array himself for the combat.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Since when, my watch hath told me towards my grave<br/>

I have travelled but two hours.</p>

<p class="right">SHAKSPEARE'S <i>Twelfth Night</i>.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>IT was on the dawn of that eventful day,
that the figure of an aged monk might be
seen by its earliest light, winding his painful
way down one of the rocky hills that
we have before described as engirdling the
castle of Courtenaye. His figure, though
not picturesque in itself, being only that
of a stooping enfeebled man, clad in a coarse
dark garment, girt with a rope, and wearing
sandals fastened with the same rude material,
derived, nevertheless, some interest from the
scenery through which his slow and painful
path descended. Sometimes he disappeared

<!-- vol 1 page 340 -->

wholly among the heavy mists that
gathered and dispersed around the hills;
sometimes he stood on a peak, measuring
with doubtful and cautious glance the precipice
he was about to plunge into; and
more often treading with a pace and aspect
that at once implied weariness, resignation,
subdued fears, and humble hopes, down the
steep and perilous paths which wound along
the sides of these rocky hills&mdash;some hollowed
by the mountain-stream, some broken
up by the earthquake, and a very few bearing
marks of human attempts (apparently
resigned in despair) to shape a track for the
traveller down declivities almost impassable.</p>

<p>The mists increasing as the dim autumnal
morning broke, the monk lost all view of
his way; and as the heavy vapours rolled
like an ocean in foam beneath him, he seated
himself on a projecting crag, looking like a
mariner perched on the fragment of a wreck,
and gazing sadly on the ocean that surrounds
him. As the monk seated himself, his staff, as
lightly as it was leant on by a feeble hand,

<!-- vol 1 page 341 -->

detached a huge mass of loosened stone from
the cliff, which went flashing and thundering
down the precipice, and sinking amid
the waters of a dark quiet mountain-lake,
sent its agitated waves in ripple and foam
to the shore. At the sound, so abrupt and
unexpected amid that deep and stilly loneliness,
the thousand echoes of the hills
awoke; the eagle started from his aerie, and
added his wild scream to the clamour; and
the mist itself, by the strong percussion of
the air, parted for a moment, then slowly
and dimly gathered and settled again. All
then was still; the echoes subsided, the
scream died away, the lake lay still again,
and the silence became more profound and
touching from the contrast.</p>

<p>The monk looked round him at first with
that expression of wonder mingled with curiosity
and awe, which the slightest phenomena
of nature amid these her deep and
profound recesses of solitude must cause&mdash;it
was like the cry of treason in the chamber
of a slumbering monarch.&mdash;"And here,

<!-- vol 1 page 342 -->

even here," said the monk, "amid the stillness
of the everlasting mountains, of the
primeval lakes, the fall of a pebble can
cause inquietude and uproar! The rocks
make war on the waters, and the wide echoes
take part in the fray&mdash;inanimate nature itself
becomes hostile around me;&mdash;but how
soon that enmity is appeased!" His mind
reverted sadly to the assembly of the Albigenses,
whom he expected to find fixed as
their mountains and cold as their streams&mdash;pure,
passionless, and moveless: his mission
had proved them far otherwise. His eye
glanced involuntarily from the cliff he had
now descended to the direction in which stood
the lofty towers of Courtenaye, shrouded by
the surrounding hills and by the mists that
mantled them from summit to base,&mdash;"And
thus," he exclaimed, "must man wander ever
amid doubtful evils;&mdash;and wherefore, but
to show him there is on earth no certain
good? Yon mountains shelter as fierce or
fiercer passions in their cold breasts as
those towers within whose proud walls lie

<!-- vol 1 page 343 -->

knight, and noble, and prelate, all on fire
with unholy feelings, baptized in the name
of holy church, and defying the God of
Mercy in wicked honour to his name!&mdash;Wherefore
is this?" he exclaimed (his mental
feet stumbling on the dark mountains), "wherefore
is this, that from hovel to castle, from the
persecuted peasant to the baron in his tower
and the knight on his steed, we meet with
nought that resembles thine image, nought
that bears thine image and superscription&mdash;O
God! whither are we to turn? Wretchedness
in castles, and pride in huts&mdash;evil
every where&mdash;good alone in Thee! Dry up
thus, dry up thus every source from which we
hoped to drain even a drop to slake our
thirst, that our burning and insatiate hearts
may turn at last to the fountain of living
waters, and feel that there alone it may be
quenched!"</p>

<p>Again his thoughts wandered back to the
congregation of the Albigeois, and to the
events which had occurred during his sojourn
among them. On his first arrival, his habit

<!-- vol 1 page 344 -->

had given such offence to the more zealous
among them, (though they could scarce expect
a visitant in a less formidable garb,) that
it was with much difficulty he gained access
to their leaders. The known sanctity of his
character, however, proved available security
for him even among those who abjured his
creed; and he was at length allowed to state
the terms offered by the Pope's legate.
Then "rose the riot and the din"&mdash;powerful
objections from the teachers, and deep misgivings
of heart among the congregation, too
well founded on former instances of treachery
and fears of their renewal. The Huguenot
deputies, when admitted to an audience with
Catharine of Medici, were never more tenacious
of security, nor with more reason.</p>

<p>But instead of offering the proud security
of prince and peer and prelate, (a pledge too
often violated,) the monk of Montcalm pledged
his own good faith for the safety of the
Albigeois; and kissing the wooden cross appended
to his rosary, he attested the Redeemer
of all to witness the pledge.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 345 -->

<p>This action awoke the controversial spirit
and declamatory zeal of the whole party; and
Mattathias, Boanerges, with the rest of the
preachers, (the deacon Mephibosheth was
not lacking,) denounced anathemas, fierce as
ever were fulminated from the Vatican, against
the abominable idolatry (as they termed it)
of a senseless piece of wood: and moreover
their wrath began to wax hot against the
messenger of peace; remembered injuries
stung them&mdash;apprehended dangers surrounded
them;&mdash;the tumult became louder, and the
language and gestures of the crowd more
violent.</p>

<p>Pale, but not dismayed, the monk of
Montcalm pressed the cross to his lips and
breast, when a well-remembered voice produced
a momentary suspension of all tumultuous
feelings&mdash;it was the voice of Pierre
the pastor.&mdash;"Let me hear him! let me hear
him!" he cried; "I cannot <i>see</i> him; but if
ever there was truth in human accents, there
is truth in that voice.&mdash;Let me feel thy hand,"
he said, affectingly feeling about for the hand
of the monk.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 346 -->

<p>"It is clasped in thine," said the monk,
grasping the hand of the venerable pastor; his
heart responding to the choral the pastor had
struck, perhaps not without some latent anxiety
for his own safety.</p>

<p>"The pledge of knight and noble, gauntlet
to gauntlet clasped, was never truer than mine
to thine," said the ancient pastor: "thou art
safe among us; we will hear the reasons of
thy preachers: and tell them, on thy return,
that depriving me of sight, I thank them for it,
mine eyes will not be dazzled with their glorious
array, (in which, I yield, we are much
lacking;) and mine ears will better hear their
reasons; for God hath recompensed the loss
of one sense by keenly quickening another, so
that hearing is now sight to me; for I swear
to thee by yea and nay, I heard in thy voice a
touch of sincerity, and feel in thy hand a grasp
of holy warmth, that kindles the embers of an
expired heart within me."</p>

<p>"Now, holy blessings be on thee, aged
man," said the monk of Montcalm; "and
though thine eyes be darkened, may thy mental
sight be illumined to see the error of thy evil

<!-- vol 1 page 347 -->

and heretical path, which leadeth to destruction.
Meanwhile I will not spare my rosary
to pray for thee."</p>

<p>The monk betook himself to his rosary as
he spoke; and the tumult of anger and vituperation
which this action produced, was on a
sudden drowned by the yet louder voices of
the military leaders contending with the pastors
of the congregation, each party fiercely insisting
on <i>their</i> exclusive right to treat with the
crusaders in the name of the whole body, and
return the answer to their messenger.</p>

<p>It was difficult to adjust the pretensions
thus hotly urged, as the military chiefs had
always been accustomed to exercise the offices
of preaching and praying, as well as of commanding
and fighting, and had been raised by
the exigencies of their warlike existence to a
superiority in the estimation of the brethren.</p>

<p>The barbes, on the other hand, seconded
by the deacons, contended that the privilege of
pleading for the church belonged to her ministers,
not to her disciples; and they soon brought
their battle to fierce issue, for tongues in debate

<!-- vol 1 page 348 -->

strike as keenly as swords in battle. As usual,
each availed themselves sufficiently of allusions
borrowed from wholly inapplicable passages in
the Jewish dispensation.</p>

<p>"Holy Heaven!" cried the bewildered monk
of Montcalm, "how impotent are human
efforts, and how baseless human hopes! In
the solitude of my cell I had dreamed that all
the world might have been one vast Christendom,
living in one feeling of love, rejoicing in
one hope of immortality: and now&mdash;and
mine eyes weep to see it&mdash;not only are the
Catholics set in arms against their erring brethren,
but even amongst you, who boast your
purer faith and closer unity, every man's hand
is against his brother!&mdash;What answer shall I
bear back to them that sent me?&mdash;save that,
since the clamour of your own contentions
hath deafened you to the voice of warning
and the message of peace, the war-cry of the
crusaders, thundering among your caverns and
your mountains, must rouse you to your
answer."</p>

<p>The effect of this rebuke was lost: both

<!-- vol 1 page 349 -->

parties sought to forget the shame of their mutual
exposure, by joining their forces to assail
the helpless monk; till some, more moderate,
dreading a repetition of the tragedy of Ch&acirc;teauneuf,
gathered round the victim to prevent it.</p>

<p>"I dread not peril of my life&mdash;they will not
kill a helpless monk,"&mdash;he replied to their assurances
of safety; "and if their wrath burn so
hot, that nought but mine aged blood must
quench it, I pray thee, reverend man," calmly
turning to Pierre, "let my rosary and cross be
buried with me. I hope not for flowers to
spring, or odours to breathe from the earth
where I fall; but let the sole companions of
my sixty years' pilgrimage be the companions
of my grave, should thy brethren dig it for me.
Scorn not this, I pray thee, as the prayer of
superstition&mdash;it is the prayer of memory and
of hope&mdash;they have been mine only wealth
during many years of wandering; and thou
knowest," he added, with a martyr's smile, "a
miser, doth not willingly part with his treasure,
even on his dying bed!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 350 -->

<p>"Thou art safe&mdash;thou art safe," cried
Pierre, grasping with unwonted energy the
hand he felt for; "I am old, blind, and
powerless; yet, ere a foot approach thee, they
must first tread on this withered body&mdash;the
body of their pastor."&mdash;And as he spoke, he
flung himself before the monk.</p>

<p>A deep silence followed this action, and
Pierre felt the force of its appeal.</p>

<p>"My brethren," said Pierre, "to-morrow
ye may pass to your mortal trial before the
mighty of the earth&mdash;even those who keep
in their hands the keys of the doors of
life and death; if they unlock the latter,
ye appear at sun-rise before your eternal
Judge!&mdash;And in His presence of what avail
will be the trifles that divide ye now? THERE
the question will not be whether ye have baptized
infants or adults&mdash;whether ye have sung
the songs of the Jews, or the hymns of our
more enlightened brethren; but whether ye
have fed the hungry, clothed the naked&mdash;Alas!
ye could not, for ye were hungry, naked,

<!-- vol 1 page 351 -->

sick yourselves; but this ye can do&mdash;protect
and save the stranger;" and he pointed
with strong action towards the monk of
Montcalm.</p>

<p>The appeal had its full effect: the multitude
retreated, the clamour subsided, and the murmur
arose deep and strong among the congregation.&mdash;"Pierre,
our pastor, we will hear
him; he shall guide us touching the matter of
our treating with the crusaders."</p>

<p>"The zeal of our brethren may seem to thee
rash," said the poor pastor, "but thou must
needs yield they be zealous."</p>

<p>"I may not deny it," said the monk, smiling,
"when they were well nigh zealous unto
slaying."</p>

<p>The pastor felt rebuked; and murmured
that their zeal might indeed be urged to
extremes; but that, at least, they must be allowed
the praise of an unmoved and constant
firmness.</p>

<p>At this moment, the multitude again lifted
up their voices, exclaiming that they would
hold a conference with the divines of the crusaders;

<!-- vol 1 page 352 -->

and that Pierre, the pastor, should be
their pleader&mdash;their Moses to speak for them
in the presence of Pharaoh."</p>

<p>"They call me Moses, now," said Pierre,
"and yesterday they would have rent me to
pieces, in a controversy touching whether the
Psalms of David, or the hymns of the brethren,
should be sung in the congregation."</p>

<p>"Alas! reverend man," said the monk, "I
fear thou canst claim as light praise for the
firmness as for the zeal of thy people."</p>

<p>The "hectic of a moment" passed across the
cheek of the humbled pastor&mdash;"Thou hast
seen the nakedness of the land in truth," he
said, "and I am rebuked for my confident
boasting; yet, credit me, these are but the
infirmities of our evil nature, that break forth
in all: and judge not of us, that we are violent,
rash, and unjust because we are (what
thou wouldst deem) heretics, but because we
are human."</p>

<p>The monk of Montcalm admitted the
humble apology, though, perchance, his creed
disclaimed it; and the matter of conference, so

<!-- vol 1 page 353 -->

long disturbed and interrupted by the violence
of the multitude, was now about to be settled
in a few moments by two mild and heavenly-minded
men.</p>

<p>"Bear back our message," said Pierre, "to
the crusaders&mdash;a message of peace will well
become thy lips: tell them we will hear the
reasons of their preachers; and that I, the
humblest of those thou seest, (and humble we
are all in rank, and power, and birth, and
speech,) I will answer them by action, if not by
words;" and he waved his staff, meditating
perhaps the action which he meant to substitute
in place of "many words" on the day of
the intended meeting.</p>

<p>"Surely I will bear thy message," said the
monk; and, resolved to give no offence to the
tenacious Albigeois, he told his beads in silence
for the prosperous event of the meeting.</p>

<p>A chill seemed to hang over the pastor as
he pronounced his assent to the meeting; he
struggled with recollections at once painful
and terrible&mdash;remembered massacres, under
the guise of truce, floated before his sightless
but sharpened vision, turning inward on memory

<!-- vol 1 page 354 -->

with redoubled power from the suspension
of its exercise on things external.&mdash;"And
what security shall we demand for our safety,"
he asked, "before the lords and knights in
whose presence we must plead defenceless?"</p>

<p>"Do peasants then demand security from
noble lords and valiant knights?" said the
monk, who was not wholly untouched by the
spirit of the age, and its high prejudice in favour
of noble and gentle blood.</p>

<p>"We demand it," said Pierre, "in the name
of a thousand massacres."</p>

<p>The monk's blood rose to the cheek and
brow that it had deserted for thirty years.&mdash;"Thy
rebuke is just," he said, "and we have
both erred&mdash;each in cleaving too closely to the
<i>cause</i>, not the motive&mdash;to the instrument in
whose power and pride we have trusted, not to
the Great Agent who gave them power, but
not pride&mdash;<i>I</i> stand your surety; let that suffice."</p>

<p>"And it shall," said the pastor: "we shall
meet in that plain of controversy thou hast
named; and if that fail, where next?"</p>

<p>"In heaven,"&mdash;said the monk, grasping his

<!-- vol 1 page 355 -->

hand,&mdash;"doubtless, in heaven!"&mdash;and they
parted.</p>

<p>As the monk, in his painful progress down
the declivities of the hills that encircled the
castle, pondered on these scenes, whose impression
on his memory was not the less powerful
from his recent share in their danger, he
was interrupted in his meditations by the tramp
of a war-steed. He paused, and looked upward,
for the sound came from above; and
soon, between the precipices of a defile on
whose rocky platform the monk stood, but far
below, came pawing and prancing a proud and
beautiful animal, his broidered housing waving
in the wild air of the mountains, and the bells
round his proud and foam-spotted neck ringing
out in time to his haughty curvettings, as
he trod the rocky path: his fiery pride was
reined by the arm of a knight in complete
harness, who often, however, turned back his
head, as if to trace some forgotten or doubtful
way; while his plumes, floating in various directions
with the breeze as he turned, seemed

<!-- vol 1 page 356 -->

indicative of the knight's irresolution, and uncertainty
of the path he was to follow.</p>

<p>As man and steed, harnessed and barded,
came thundering down the narrow pass, the
monk of Montcalm turned humbly aside. His
figure, however, did not escape the notice of
the youthful knight, who, reining up his steed,
(while his hoofs struck fire from the stones on
which he reared and backed,) with humble
grace asked benison of the holy man.</p>

<p>"Thou hast it, fair son," said the monk;
"and, if I may demand of thee a boon in requital
of so mean a gift as a poor monk's
benison, may I ask of thee my nearest way
to the castle of Courtenaye?&mdash;for, in truth, I
am well nigh bewildered in these mountain
paths."</p>

<p>"The rather, reverend sir," said the youth,
"that mine own way lieth thither; but,
meanwhile, it becomes not a layman like
me to bestride a steed, while thou, reverend
man, treadest thy hard and dreary path
on foot: I pray you mount my steed; you

<!-- vol 1 page 357 -->

will find him fleet as a bird and calm as the
air it cleaves; otherwise, I will guide the rein
while you keep the saddle."</p>

<p>"Fair son," said the monk, "I dare well
answer for your steed's fleetness, if not for his
gentleness&mdash;but thine arm is better fitted to
rule him, as thy form is to govern and to grace
him.&mdash;I will rather pace softly by thy side&mdash;the
knight to his steed, and the monk to his
sandal; and truly mine" said the poor monk,
halting from weariness, "mine are sore worn
in my late travel."</p>

<p>As the monk thus paused, looking up
with an expression of interest, his coarse
garments folded round him and bound by a
rope&mdash;and the young knight in his "pride
of panoply," with floating plume, and lowered
bannerol fastened to his lance's point,
reining up his steed, paid graceful attention
to the humble form before him,&mdash;the
precipice behind, the steep and perilous path
before, forming a wild landscape to the two;
figures thus singularly contrasted,&mdash;one would

<!-- vol 1 page 358 -->

have deemed it an emblem of the martial spirit
of the age doing homage to its devotion.</p>

<p>"And these sandals are thus worn, fair
son,"&mdash;said the monk, observing that curiosity
was blended with the expression of attention
in the young knight's attitude&mdash;"they are thus
worn from my late painful journeys to the
mountain abode of the heretics, where, in truth,
they have been driven to sojourn by the severity&mdash;but
that imports not now.&mdash;I am returning
with a message of peace from that
persecuted people: would it had not been so
qualified by their rancour and hostility.&mdash;But
of <i>them</i> let no man judge; they are embittered
by causes that I would had not existed.&mdash;But
wherefore art thou again, at my feet, fair son?"</p>

<p>"To beg thy benison, if thou art the holy
monk of Montcalm," said the youth.</p>

<p>"Receive it, fair son," said the monk, "but
not in the name with which thou hast, in the
language of earthly men, flattered me.&mdash;I am
the monk of Montcalm&mdash;<i>holy</i> appertains to
Him who shares not his glory with his creatures:

<!-- vol 1 page 359 -->

but near the close of my earthly pilgrimage,
I rejoice to bear the message of
peace."</p>

"Message of peace!" said the knight, flinging
himself again on his war-steed, "message
of peace! monk of Montcalm! By heaven
thou bearest most unwelcome news&mdash;tidings
that will win thee cold welcome at the castle
of Courtenaye. Thy breath will be the coldest
air that ever fanned the banners on its towers."
He added, highly chafed&mdash;"All this fair array&mdash;this
goodly and gallant preparation&mdash;and
thy message of peace!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the monk, regarding his disturbed
form and angry gestures with an air at
once humble and commiserating, like a partial
and overawed parent at the insolence of a
wayward child&mdash;"Alas! and, hast thou, fair
son, so young in years, so goodly in form,
drank thus deeply of the cup which this fierce
age has filled with the waters of bitterness,
even to overflowing? While thy mother's
milk is yet warm on thy beardless lip, dost
thou already thirst for blood?&mdash;Were it not

<!-- vol 1 page 360 -->

better, fair son, that the wanderers of the flock
should be brought back to the fold by the voice
of the shepherd, than driven to it by the yell
of the wolf?"</p>

<p>"I am not learned in metaphor, reverend
sir," said the fiery youth; "but I deem foul
scorn that lords, and knights, and holy prelates,
and learned clerks, should stand to exchange
reasons with loreless peasants, and be
baited with the jargon of their vile heresy&mdash;by
heaven, I would convince them with my
lance, and so close the controversy for ever.&mdash;Trust
me, sir monk, thou bearest most ungracious
tidings to the thousand warriors that
are even now sweeping down yon hills towards
the castle of Courtenaye&mdash;mark what welcome
they will give them!"</p>

<p>"Be they warriors thou pointest toward?"
said the dim-eyed monk, his crouching figure
and tremulous hand, as he turned in the direction,
making strong contrast with the spirited
form of the youthful knight, whose mailed arm
was extended at almost a right angle with his
body, and whose eyes flashed through the bars

<!-- vol 1 page 361 -->

of his helmet&mdash;"Be they warriors?" repeated
the monk; "to my dim eyes they seem like
wreaths of mist winding down the mountain
sides."</p>

<p>"Wreaths of mist!" exclaimed the knight;
"say thou rather thunder-clouds, that will
burst ere long;&mdash;There," he said, rising in his
stirrups, while his quick young eye pierced
through the mists that veiled the descending
hosts from the eyes of the monk, as quitting
their mountain encampment, they sped towards
the castle, "there float the banners of the
good knight Sir Aymer du Chastelroi&mdash;alas!
that his train is so poor; but such is his wont,
he hath no power over his loose licentious
band.&mdash;There fly the banners of Sir Ezzelin
de Verac and the Sieur de Semonville&mdash;
now, by Heaven, a gallant array!&mdash;pity it is,
that a fop and a churl should be brothers in arms
to lead such a band.&mdash;See," he exclaimed,
with the feelings of a child, before whose
senses one splendid pageant, passing momently,
supersedes and eclipses another, "see the

<!-- vol 1 page 362 -->

men-at-arms of Count Simon de Montfort, champion
of the church, sweep down the declivity!&mdash;lo!
the standard of the cross, how it rocks and
nods, as the standard-bearers wind through the
defile&mdash;proud men are they who bear it the
while.&mdash;Grace and good fortune to thee,
holy sign, and to those who charge in thy van,
and to those who uphold thee, and to those
who perish in thy sacred shadow!&mdash;Be thou
as a beacon in the stormy ocean of the battle.
<i>V&aelig; victis! v&aelig; victis!</i>&mdash;I see the banners of
the bishop of Toulouse&mdash;woe be to those
who meet thee, proud and mighty prelate,
either in council or in the field! Thy words,
when thou speakest, are mightier than wielded
swords; and thy sword, when thou wieldest it,
makes the lances of an army vain&mdash;terror
and delight tremble in my heart, while I gaze
on thy array, thou mightiest of the mighty!&mdash;Though
thou art in peace, I behold thee as a
foe&mdash;for there is that in thee which seems to
make toys of kings, and tools of armies; and
when thou strikest thy boldest blow, it seems

<!-- vol 1 page 363 -->

struck for thine own high and secret purposes,
not for the cause in which thou hast flung
down the crosier for the lance, and buckled
harness over rocket and hood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven, fair son," said the
bewildered monk, "of whom speakest thou&mdash;
and what is that gallant array of which thou
talkest, and whereto wind they?"</p>

"Did I not tell thee, reverend monk," said
the youth, still fixing his fiery eye on the
descending groups, and spurring on his steed,
"did I not tell thee, that this day a tourney is
held in the castle of Courtenaye; and Sir
Paladour de la Croix Sanglante combats
against Count Simon de Montfort, in rescue of
the Lady Isabelle's lands and hand.&mdash;May
Heaven favour him who strikes in the cause
of right and of beauty!"</p>

<p>"Holy Heaven!" cried the monk, dropping
in utter dismay his beads, and clasping
his hands together&mdash;"Holy Heaven, what
mad and wayward times!&mdash;Are there not
enemies enough, but the crusaders must turn

<!-- vol 1 page 364 -->

the lances consecrated to the service of the
church against each other?&mdash;well said the
prophet, 'I labour for peace, but they make
them ready to battle.' Set on, sir knight,
I pray, and in the name of Heaven stay, if
thou canst, this mad battle, at least till such
time as I can arrive and yield them reasons
for the delay."</p>

<p>"You must needs pardon me, sir monk,"
said the youth; "I know no power that may
bind the arm of Sir Paladour from striking in
such cause; and thou best knowest whether
De Montfort in his mood may be turned away
by a churchman's prayers. Try first whether
they shake yon deep-seated hill, or check the
torrent that thunders down its side; and if
they obey thee&mdash;despair of moving him"&mdash;and
spurring forward, he mingled in the train
that hastened towards the castle of Courtenaye,
his vow of never re-entering its walls
forgotten in his solicitude for the fate of
Paladour.</p>

<p>He arrived at a critical moment&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 365 -->

combat had already begun&mdash;the order of the
Lady Isabellas champions had been determined
by lot, and it chanced that Sir Paladour's
was the last. Hitherto all that had
encountered Simon de Montfort had been
disabled and overthrown.&mdash;The ladies who
surrounded Isabelle began to tremble. Sir
Aymer, who was the marshal of the field
on her part, with compressed lip and
tightening grasp of his staff, began in his need
to pray vehemently, but internally.&mdash;The Lady
Isabelle herself, who had mechanically bowed,
smiled, and waved her hand to each of her ill-fated
champions as they rode into the lists,
now sat with unrelaxing features, and a cheek
as pale as death, when the trumpets sounded
for Sir Paladour's encounter&mdash;it was her last
hope, but it was her first fear. Amirald, who
had dismounted, and was making his way
with difficulty through the crowd, was suddenly
stopped by one of the lady's attendants,
veiled, who caught his arm, and whispered,
"Art thou Sir Paladour's friend?'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 366 -->

<p>"I am his brother-in-arms, damsel," answered
the knight.</p>

<p>"Prove it at his need," replied the damsel;
"for the Count de Montfort hath made a vow
to God, that nought shall mar the overthrow
of Sir Paladour this day, though the laws of
combat and of chivalry be broken to accomplish
it."</p>

<p>Amirald eagerly pressed on&mdash;as he gained
a post, Sir Paladour, taking his lance from his
page, rode to the barrier&mdash;his tall but slender
form was but too evidently no match for the
gigantic De Montfort; yet, so stately was his
demeanour, so lightly did he bear the weight
of his ponderous arms, and with such graceful
strength did he manage his steed, that every
heart in the assembly beat high for his success,
and every lip put up a prayer for his safety.
De Montfort himself seemed to enter into the
impression made by his appearance; for,
though he had hitherto met all comers without
any other preparation than that of changing
his lance when it shivered, he now dismounted,

<!-- vol 1 page 367 -->

demanded another steed and another lance,
and carefully examined that which was given
him in exchange. He also called for a goblet
of wine; and as this could not be swallowed
without unclosing his helmet, a circumstance
in consequence occurred that had deep share
in the event of the day, and was exactly
similar to that by which Henry the Eighth was
near losing his life in a tourney with his future
brother-in-law, Charles, Duke of Suffolk.
While De Montfort was swallowing a deep
draught, Sir Paladour put his steed in motion
to approach the gallery where the Lady
Isabelle sat; and De Montfort, mistaking this
movement, snatched his lance from his squire,
and flung himself on his steed, closing his
helmet hastily, and so carelessly, that some of
the rivets remained unfastened. Sir Aymer,
aware of the movement Paladour was making,
called aloud on Lady Isabelle to give her
champion word, or smile, or look. "Smile
on him, lady," he cried: "look lovely on
him for Heaven's sake&mdash;throw him a glove&mdash;let
down thy long hair,&mdash;smile on him at

<!-- vol 1 page 368 -->

least, nay give him a word&mdash;a word&mdash;a look.
Now, God help thee, noble Paladour! thou
perilest life for one who will not give thee a
smile in recompense&mdash;did ever champion ride
against such odds?"&mdash;Isabelle sat insensible,
and frozen with horror, grasping the warder with
unconscious fingers.&mdash;"Holy God! she cannot
speak," cried Sir Aymer; "and his lance
is already in rest. My lord of Toulouse,
hast thou no saint to call to aid?" The
bishop shook his head as he viewed Sir Paladour.
Sir Aymer clasped his hands, dropping
his marshal's staff&mdash;"the champion rides to
his doom," he cried, "without a smile of
comfort, a word of hope:" then glancing at
the mute and pallid terror of Isabelle,&mdash;"Lord
abbot," he cried, "out with thy beads, and
call on the saints for succour! Holy St. Benedict,
aid us in this extremity, and thy
altar shall burn brighter, till the day of doom,
with a candlestick of solid silver&mdash;nay, I will
not stand with thee for gold, blessed saint, at
this need, though the last rood round mine
ancient tower of Chastelroi were sold to pay

<!-- vol 1 page 369 -->

the charge. Ladies,&mdash;dames and damsels, have
ye no saints to invoke, no tongue to speak
withal? I warrant me ye would weary all the
saints if your lap-dog ailed, or your dove pined;
have ye not a breath to utter when a noble
lady is in peril, hand, land, and liberty? Minions,
to your prayers, to your prayers!&mdash;nought
but Heaven can save us in this desperate
strait." The words were not addressed
to unwilling ears&mdash;the attendants of Isabelle
were uttering prayers with clasped hands
and uplift eyes. The ladies, spectatresses of
the combat, forgave her beauty for once,
and making common cause, uttered vows
audibly. The abbot of Normoutier called
on St. Benedict with his utmost might,
and told his beads as fast as he could tell.
Sir Amirald dropped his reins on his steed's
neck, and clasped his armed hands together&mdash;"I
make a vow," he cried, "I make a vow to
go on a pilgrimage to St. Jaques le Grand
barefoot, and with hair-cloth on my skin, so
my brother-in-arms escape this peril in success
and safety&mdash;so help me, God, and St. Denis

<!-- vol 1 page 370 -->

of France!" The champions met in full
career. The blow aimed by De Montfort,
right at the helmet of Sir Paladour, must have
felled him to the dust, if he had been a statue
of stone cleaving to a steed hewn out of the
same block&mdash;but, an instant before it reached
him, the chevron of Sir Paladour's barded
steed (who had chanced to bend his head)
darted into the nostril of the Count de Montfort's;
and the noble animal, maddening with
the agony, reared so suddenly and so high,
that the lance of the unseated rider passed
above the shoulder of Sir Paladour; while,
at the same moment, the lance of Paladour
touched the very point of the unclosed helmet
of De Montfort&mdash;shook the heavy harness from
visor to gorget&mdash;the giant form of De Montfort
rolled in the dust&mdash;and a thousand voices
thundered applause through the lists as he fell.</p>

<p>Those shouts were soon exchanged for cries
of terror and dismay. De Montfort, maddened
by his disgrace, forgot all laws of chivalry;
and springing from the ground, as Sir
Paladour, who had dismounted, approached

<!-- vol 1 page 371 -->

to call on him to confess himself vanquished,
he retreated towards the barriers, and snatching
a battle-axe from the ready hand of one of
his followers, he rushed on his antagonist.
At that moment, with the speed of lightning,
Sir Amirald, aware of the meditated act, not
perhaps of treachery, but of ferocious vengeance,
tore a battle-axe from the hand of a
by-stander, and gave it over the lists to Paladour.
Meanwhile, the whole assembly, lists,
barriers, and galleries, were in an uproar at
this unheard-of infraction of the rules of
combat. "Cast down the warder, lady; in
God's name cast it down!&mdash;they fight their
combat <i>&agrave; l'outrance</i>&mdash;in the name of God,
cast it down!" Isabelle sat petrified, turned
to a statue, and grasping the warder closer
as the cries redoubled round her, and sounded
in her ears like the waves of a distant ocean.
Marshal and herald hurried into the lists to
part the combatants. Enguerrand de Vitry,
brother-in-arms to the Count de Montfort,
made all haste for the honour of chivalry, and
in deep shame for the disgrace done by the
count. Sir Aymer, on the contrary, who had

<!-- vol 1 page 372 -->

started from his seat at the first impulse,
paused with conscious delight as he saw Sir
Paladour snatch the battle-axe from Amirald,
and approach boldly in his defence&mdash;nevertheless,
he shouted with the rest, "Treachery,
treachery in the lists! part them, heralds!
Lord marshal make in, make in for the honour
of chivalry&mdash;part them!" Yet he muttered
under his breath, while purposely delaying his
descent to the barriers, "Now down thou
goest, an thou wert an Ascapart, or the twelve
peers of France, and the knights of the round
table to boot." Ere the marshals could meet
in the lists, this second combat had been
decided&mdash;and as the first, by chance&mdash;for
Paladour, in actual strength, the great requisite
in such combats, was far inferior to his
antagonist. The blood, streaming from the
wound of Simon de Montfort, right over the
eye, had dimmed and drowned its vision;
and with blind fury he heaved his battle-axe,
sure of its first felling his antagonist; but the
blood flowed fast, and the blow, dealt in
fury and blindness, struck into a lance that
lay on the sands, with which the lists were

<!-- vol 1 page 373 -->

strewed, with a force that made the splinters
spring into the air several feet. Sir Paladour's
blow, better aimed, and inspired by a passionate
desire, not only to signalize himself in
his lady's sight, but to avenge himself for this
outrage on chivalry and knightly practice, fell
full on the part exposed by the still unclosed
helmet; and then the</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Griding axe, with discontinuous wound,"</p>

</div>

<p>wandered down the gorget in its descent, and
the blood gushed from between the joints of
the giant champion's armour as he fell a
second time. Sir Paladour, his strength exhausted
by the last unexpected blow, was now
in no condition to make demand of the vanquished
champion. He leaned exhausted on
the breast of Amirald, who had hurried into
the lists; but he turned his swimming eye and
waved his broken brand in token of triumph
towards the gallery, where the Lady Isabelle,
starting from her, trance of terror, flung herself
on her knees, and then bursting into a sudden
agony of tears, fell into the arms of her
attendants.</p>

<br/>

<p>IN agony of spirit that he could neither brook
nor conceal any longer, the Lord of Courtenaye
had rushed from his place on the unexpected
event of the combat, leaving to some of his
attendants to plead sudden indisposition as the
cause of his absence&mdash;and burying himself in
the dark recesses of his secret apartments, he
summoned their darker visitants round him on
the instant. The astrologer descended from
his tower; the female, that mysterious president
of evil, emerged from the vaults
of the castle, with whose secret passages she
was well acquainted, and where latterly she
chiefly abode, except when for months she
wandered among the mountains, without giving,

<!-- vol 1 page 375 -->

on her return, account of her employment or
her time&mdash;and both stood beside him, one, as
usual, trembling, and one making <i>him</i> tremble.
The astrologer had positively predicted the
death of Paladour; the female seemed to
exult in his safety, and yet to promise from it
a richer fulfilment of the Lord of Courtenaye's
hopes than could ever have been obtained by
his death <i>at that period;</i>&mdash;their harassed
victim fluctuated between them, cursed them,
and begged their aid alternately, with the
natural vacillation of hopeless misery; and
finally would have summoned Thibaud and
his attendants to spurn them from the castle
gates, had not a thought been suggested to him
at that moment that made him pause in the
expression, if not in the purpose of his evil
will&mdash;and he lent an eager ear, and glanced
with a lynx-like eye, while certain whispers
from the female, who seemed to enjoy alike
her powers of command and of torture as
exercised on him, trembled through his ears.</p>

<p>What dark counsels were given and received
at that meeting, never transpired but by their

<!-- vol 1 page 376 -->

results. A report had spread through the
castle, (favourable to the views of the Lord
of Courtenaye,) originating perhaps from the abstracted
habits and visionary language of Paladour,
that he had dealt with the agents of the
invisible world, and that voices had been heard
the preceding night in his chamber at an hour
when all earthly voices are mute. The menials
of the castle, fond of the "wonderful and
wild," believed and repeated it; and the defeat
of Count Simon de Montfort, the fiercest champion
of the age, by an almost beardless boy,
seemed to give sanction to the report of the
latter having been aided in the combat by a
power <i>worse</i> than earthly. Memory is apt
and active in furnishing materials for morbid
and feverish fancy to work on&mdash;the songs of
Vidal were now repeated through the household
with all their mysterious allusions&mdash;the
report of "the fiery arrow" was rife in
mouths that dared not, the preceding day, have
whispered the sound within the towers of
Courtenaye&mdash;the Lady Isabelle herself, as
she passed from the court of the castle to her

<!-- vol 1 page 377 -->

chamber to throw off her heavy robes, had
paused ominously before the portrait of an
ancestress, the most beautiful of her race and
age, who had been wooed by a splendid and
valorous knight, whose title and birth no one
knew, though all had witnessed his achievements&mdash;and
whose mangled corse was soon
after discovered in the woods near the castle;
nor had it ever been known whether her bridegroom
was the fearful <i>loup garoux</i> so dreaded
in Languedoc, or whether she had perished
by a less horrible destiny, even under the fangs
of <i>real</i> wolves&mdash;the bridegroom never returned&mdash;the
corse was interred&mdash;the portrait
still smiled in the rejuvenescence of two
hundred years; and the Lady Isabelle paused
as she passed it, gazed, and shuddered.</p>

<p>Nature, that day seemed to rise in aid
of the Lord of Courtenaye&mdash;the morning
had been gloomy, but calm&mdash;the combat
had protracted the dinner-hour till two,
and all met at the banquet exhausted and
spiritless after the strife of the morning.
Meanwhile, the clouds that had hung over the

<!-- vol 1 page 378 -->

mountains all day began to descend in misty
wreaths down their summits. These appeared
at first like masses of wool, white, but shedding
darkness where they spread; then assuming
the forms of water-spouts, some descended in
inverted cones on the hills, and burst in a deluge&mdash;others,
perhaps, fuller of electric matter,
wandered lower in search of some point of
attraction, and sent forth flashes of pale lightning,
and rumours of distant thunder among
the valleys&mdash;at length, toward evening, the
whole collected force of the tempest burst
forth, and it was terrible&mdash;the mountains
seemed to rock to their bases, and even to
change their aspects and postures as the storm-clouds,
flying before the blast, swept round
their dizzy and shifting peaks&mdash;the rain,
mingled with hail, came down in a deluge; not
the rain that patters against the casement,
but that which ploughs up the ground where
it falls, and strews the ruined hovel of the
peasant beside his blasted harvest&mdash;the mountain
torrents came rushing down as if at a
signal, and the roars of the bears and the

<!-- vol 1 page 379 -->

wolves, whom it swept away, were drowned in
the roar of its flood; and this was increased by
the masses of granite which, struck by the
lightning or precipitated by the flood, thundered
from precipice to precipice, lashing the
foam into madness, and dragging down trees,
overwhelming animals, and indenting the earth
where they fell with traces that seemed to
have been left by the primeval deluge. The
banquet was thinly attended&mdash;those who had
encountered De Montfort had retired to their
apartments, sore and discomfited, and consoling
themselves for their bruises by the reflection,
that they were so impartially shared
among a number, that no individual of the
defeated band could fairly reproach a fellow-sufferer.
The lady, according to a vow she
had made when Sir Paladour was in extremity,
had shut herself in her chamber to perform
her devotions, which were to continue till
morning. The vast hall looked dim and desolate&mdash;the
fierce spirits, who had passed the
day in mortal contention, seemed awed, if not
subdued, by the terrors of the elements, and

<!-- vol 1 page 380 -->

each took his place in silence; they were but
few, and they crossed themselves often as they
sat, and offered internal vows to their various
saints for the overpassing of the storm, in
which each heard pealing the remembrance of
crime, or the summons of vengeance. The
torches of the attendants waned as the lightning
flashed through the vast windows&mdash;and
the tapestry, waving to and fro in the blast
that rushed through door and casement, gave to
its distorted forms the appearance of gigantic
spectres, who menaced the guests as they sat
by their fitful and shadowy movements. As
the night advanced the storm diminished&mdash;the
attendants were desired to remove their
torches; and the knights, gathering round the
vast wood-fire that blazed on the hearth,
about which their benches had been placed by
the attendants, began to feel that kind of
gloomy comfort with which men, after a day
of toil and a night of terror, gaze on glowing
embers and listen to the gossip's tale, while
the blast is raving at the casement and rocking
the battlement, and the excluded world without

<!-- vol 1 page 381 -->

is wrapt in darkness and in danger. One
single minstrel in the dim gallery touched his
harp; but, whether from impulse or command,
he chose a wild theme of spirits abroad on the
elements guiding their force and aggravating
their mischief, launching the lightning at the
chieftain's tower, pouring the deluge over the
peasant's hut, scaring the traveller on the
brow of the precipice, and luring the wanderer
to the verge of the cold dark flood or the footing
of the treacherous morass. The haughty
spirits, who had a thousand times braved
death in the field, subdued (as the fiercest
animals are said to be) by the terrors of the
elements and the lassitude produced by confinement
within walls, listened with a kind of
gloomy and passive relaxation; and the Lord
of Courtenaye, who saw their minds lowered
to the very key he wished and was well skilled
to touch, gradually and cautiously introduced
the subject of the appearance of disembodied
spirits, and of the possibility of holding safe
intercourse with the invisible world. Full of
the spirit of the age, which inculcated such

<!-- vol 1 page 382 -->

belief, rather as matter of creed than of
debate, the guests eagerly embraced the topic;
and those who could relate nothing in support
of the prevailing impression, listened with wild
and breathless anxiety to the evidences produced
by others; and though all were traditional
and obscure, and many trivial and even
ludicrous, the feeling deepened, and the awe
became general. Among the group there
were but two silent and absent listeners, the
bishop of Toulouse, a resolute sceptic, who
sat on perhaps for that very reason, and by a
strong effort concealed his smiles; and Paladour,
who internally struggled with the fearful
ascendancy which early and undated feelings,
combined with supposed experience, was obtaining
over his intellects. It was remarkable,
that though the conversation among the other
guests was at first adopted incidentally, and
without any appearance of interest, yet the
interest now strongly increased&mdash;the embers
were on the wane&mdash;the hall waxed dim&mdash;men
could not see the speaker's face, or catch
from his expression the horrors of his tale, or

<!-- vol 1 page 383 -->

how that expression was affected by their influence&mdash;the
laugh, under which some sought
to disguise their fears, grew fainter and then
ceased; and the fire, though roused by the
pages at the order of their lord, was at length
reflected from pale cheeks, (which no other
fear could blanch,) unclosed and breathless
lips, and sunk but eager eyes fixed on the teller
of the last tale; and no sound was heard in
the pause, but the rustling of the mantles of
the guests, who laid down their untasted wine,
or started as the blast, putting to full proof the
strength of the casement and door, seemed
like the dark menace of the entrance of something
that was steering on its pinion, and mingling
its voice with its roar. The Lord of
Courtenaye, like all cowards, grew stronger
amid the fears he had inspired&mdash;and as he
watched with anxious eye the hall gradually
thinned, (while some retired to pray, and some
lest they should hear what would keep them
sleepless that dreary night,) saw, with unuttered
satisfaction, the group reduced to all he wished

<!-- vol 1 page 384 -->

it to contain&mdash;the bishop of Toulouse, who
lingered to guard his scepticism from suspicion&mdash;the
Count de Montfort, on whom some
dark convictions pressed, which he felt the
narratives of others were a kind of silent
channel for&mdash;the abbot of Normoutier, who
dozed over his goblet, but who generally awoke
at the end of a relation in due time to utter
an ave, or make the sign of the cross&mdash;Paladour,
who loitered because he dreaded, and
Sir Aymer, because he hated the hour of retiring,
be the cause what it might&mdash;De Verac
and Semonville, who tarried, the former in
visions of new garbs, armour, and devices,
and the latter in downright honest terror,
afraid alike of his bed, of the passages that
led to it, of the very floor he trod, and
almost of the air he breathed, for every thing
around him seemed to partake of a hideous
and preternatural vitality;&mdash;of the latter the
Lord of Courtenaye recked not, but he inwardly
rejoiced that the two dignitaries were
of the number. The group was now so diminished,

<!-- vol 1 page 385 -->

that they seemed in the vast hall, in
dimension like fairies collecting, and in sound
like crickets chirping round the hearth.</p>

<p>"How say ye, my lords?" said he of Courtenaye;
"shall we have some authentic tale
to wipe these foolish fantasies from our brains,
somewhat that may be sternly credited? Nay,
let us draw nearer the fire&mdash;the night is foul
and the tempest raving still&mdash;better an hour
wasted thus than in tossing on a sleepless
couch, while the wind and rain beat heavy
time to our restless heavings. Sir Aymer du
Chastelroi, hast thou nought to tell us of what
thou may'st have heard or remembered of these
terrors of the olden and overpast time?"</p>

<p>"Of the old time," said Sir Aymer, somewhat
chafed, "I can remember nothing, being
then a youth; but I remember a tale that
chanced a century before I was born, and that
will I relate."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sir Aymer's Tale</i>.</p>

<p>"My grand-uncle, Odo of Chastelroi&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was thine uncle Odo, surnamed the

<!-- vol 1 page 386 -->

Lion," interrupted De Montfort; "and the
matter chanced about fifty years ago, which is
rife in thy memory."</p>

<p>"Thou art right," said Sir Aymer, though
discomfited at this rectification of dates.
"Mine uncle Odo, surnamed the Lion, being
at one time sore sick, and at point to
die, sent for the prior of St. Bernard's to
shrieve him: the prior came, attended by
two friars; one of whom bore away on
his departure a relic of precious value,
which an ancestor of Sir Odo's had brought
from the Holy Land in the first crusade.
Odo the Lion, well so named, when restored
to health&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was owing to the prayers of the
prior," muttered the abbot of Normoutier.</p>

<p>"He showed but little gratitude," said Sir
Aymer; "for when he could brook his saddle,
his first exploit was to assail the priory of St.
Bernard's, and demand his relic, which he
swore had been secretly conveyed away by the
crafty friar. Odo the Lion was at the head
of fifty men-at-arms&mdash;the prior came forth to

<!-- vol 1 page 387 -->

meet him at the head of the brethren; but it
so chanced that bead and bell were weak fence
against lance and brand&mdash;the good prior, by
some mistake, lost his life in the scuffle; and by
the same mismanagement certain torches, that
happened to be in the hands of the men-at-arms,
found their way to the roof of the priory,
which was a heap of smouldering ashes ere
morn. Mine uncle, leaving his train to settle
the matter with the friars, set forth without
delay for Rome, where, having obtained absolution
from the Pope, he was enjoined, for
penance, yearly to make a pilgrimage to the
tomb of the martyred prior, (who might thank
Odo for his martyrdom,) and to endow the
spot where he was interred with a heavy sum
for masses to be said for ever. Mine uncle
readily complied with the latter enjoinment,
which hath left the shrine of St. Bernard as
rich as the tower of Chastelroi is poor&mdash;marry,
for the former he commuted; for it
was enjoined him to go barefoot to the shrine
the day the deed was done; and that being in
December, when weather is foul and roads

<!-- vol 1 page 388 -->

stark naught, Odo the Lion rode with his bare
feet in his stirrups, while a henchman, bearing
his boots of steel, (lest the weather should
prove too rough,) ran beside him as he rode.
Now it chanced that the shrine of St. Bernard
lay sixteen miles from Odo's castle, and
between them was neither town nor tower, or
other sojourn than a hostel, which, however,
was well-liked and frequented, being possessed
by a merry old host, whose free humour, jovial
songs, and quaint sayings, made his abode
better liked than the towers of certain castles,
where men say&mdash;&mdash;I crave your pardon,
Lord of Courtenaye."</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye bowed in grim
civility.</p>

<p>"He was named the host of the Black Hog
from the letters on his sign, which ran thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'Je met en Dieu mon tout espoir,<br/>

Et je demeure au Cochon Noir.'<sup id="ref018"><a href="#en018">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Mine uncle, on his pilgrimage, always sojourned
at the host of <i>Cochon Noir</i>. He loved

<!-- vol 1 page 389 -->

to gather with his train round the bright woodfire,
to list his merry songs, and quaff his wine,
while the storms of December pealed without
the walls, and to-morrow's journey lay before
him unremembered. It was one night while
they sat thus, as the storm waxed fierce, and
the fire blazed bright, and the host, with broken
voice and increasing girth and lungs, puffing
away their last breath in merriment, tried to
excite the sinking spirits of his noble guest,
that a mingled humour of mirth and melancholy
seizing on Odo the Lion, he exclaimed,
'My merry old host sing no longer&mdash;thy
voice is to me like a voice I shall never hear
again; the hand with which thou touchest
thy harp is weak, the tones that follow its
chords are broken; and thou hast rounded to
such a size, and thy limbs are like those of a
grasshopper. Trust me, my pleasant host, I
never expect to meet thee on another December
anniversary; and so I bid adieu to
good wine, well-aired chambers, and cheerful
converse on my next visit to the shrine of
St. Bernard.'&mdash;'And trust me,' said the merry

<!-- vol 1 page 390 -->

host, 'even if I be dead, the harp shall ring in
your ears, your wine-cup shall be filled, and,
noble guest, your bed shall be as well-aired
and as warmly spread as when you honoured
my poor hostel last.'&mdash;Some maudlin tears
were then shed&mdash;I say not they were insincere,
for mine eyes gushed over this day when Sir
Paladour foiled thee in the lists, De Montfort."</p>

<p>"Finish thy goblet and thy tale," said De
Montfort.</p>

<p>"Odo the Lion was then conveyed to his
bed," said Sir Aymer; "and they say he
murmured, as he went, that he would slay every
prior in France, and do penance after for the
deed, provided that the hostel of <i>le Cochon
Noir</i> lay in his way as he rode."</p>

<p>"The storm increases," said the abbot of
Normoutier, starting from a dose, "Were
we not best to bed?&mdash;not that I could close an
eye&mdash;I must tell my beads all night."</p>

<p>"Such a storm as fell to-night," said Sir
Aymer, "chanced the night that a twelve-month
after mine uncle set out on his wonted
pilgrimage: heavy rains, mixed with gusts

<!-- vol 1 page 391 -->

from the mountains, fell during the short
day, the night closed, and matters grew
worse&mdash;the guides, though well-accustomed
to their way, lost the track&mdash;the deluges
ploughed up the roads, and made every brook
a river&mdash;flashes of pale lightning glimmered
round the horizon, but there was not a peal
of thunder; nought but the roar of streams,
and of winds conflicting with woods, and the
yells of wolves, that, though distant, sounded
but too near in the watchful ear of terror.
Odo the Lion himself, in attempting to
ford a stream, was well nigh lost in the
strong current; two of his squires swam beside
to hold him on his steed, and by dint of a
vow to the Trinity of Gaeta at his utmost
need he won the hither bank: his train followed
as they might&mdash;a light gleamed at scant
distance, to which they tended, and which
issued from the hostel, now a drenched hovel
rocking in a morass. The noble guest was
received, however, with joy, ushered to his
wonted chamber, and his shivering train spread
themselves before the fire below, after placing

<!-- vol 1 page 392 -->

one or two wine flagons they had saved on a
table before their lord. After he had drained
them, and warmed his chilled limbs, (for he
still rode barefooted,) his heart began to glow,
and his memory to return; and as he expanded
himself to the grateful heat, he could not
choose but exclaim, 'Would that my merry
old host were here to touch harp or lute, and
sing me some drowsy strain, betwixt whose
changes I might wake and nod, and then
be lulled again!' Odo the Lion, on his
dying bed, and to a holy friar, but not of St.
Bernard's, assevered, that as he uttered these
words, (nay, all his life-time he told the same
tale,) the dull low tinkling of a lute was heard
in the pauses of the wind. Mine uncle had
two companions, one his confessor, the other
his squire;&mdash;the latter became senseless at the
sound; the other, being a bold as well as a
holy man, sat out this awful visitation. The
sounds increased, and were accompanied by
words that seemed to come neither from below
the earth nor above it; still less did it resemble
any sound on earth. Mine uncle was wont to

<!-- vol 1 page 393 -->

term it the ghost of speech. These words, so
sepulchral, unnatural, and fearful to human
ears, were, nevertheless, part of the welcome
song his former host used to sing to his guest;
and as they ended, my kinsman, turning his
head, saw something faint, shapeless, and featureless,
stand in the corner of the chamber&mdash;he
said there was a film or gauze either before
his eyes, (which he allowed grew a little dim
on the occasion,) or before the aspect of that
something; for, though no human visage
could be traced, he swore it bore a kind
of fearful indefinite resemblance to his
ancient host. He added, that the garb was
neither that of living man, nor the last dreary
array of a shrouded corse, but a shadowy
envelopment he could not describe. Odo,
collecting his spirits when his head was
averted, stamped for his attendants to spread
for supper; they prepared to do so, but first
applied themselves to the recovery of the
squire, who recovered only to a state of
idiotism. This Odo did not much regard&mdash;the
table was spread, and the attendants were

<!-- vol 1 page 394 -->

prompt; but Odo observed one more prompt
than them all, his eye followed the swift silent
figure as it flitted around, and he saw <i>who</i> filled
his trencher ere he could swallow its contents,
and made his goblet sparkle to the brim
when he thought he had drained it, so
over officious was this mute attendant. The
confessor himself avouched that there was <i>one
more</i> in the chamber than he could reckon;
and though he began and ended the tale<sup id="ref019"><a href="#en019">19</a></sup> over
and over again, still there was one in the
chamber who completely perplexed his calculation,
and whom, though he <i>saw</i>, he never
could <i>count</i> among the number&mdash;he ever saw
twelve, but could number but eleven. The
confessor betook him to his beads, and my
kinsman to his bed, (the poor squire being
in a lamentable state); but he had not rested
long when he was awoke by some one softly
and lightly pacing round his bed, and ever and
anon adjusting the clothes. Odo started up,
and beheld the same shapeless, nameless thing,
employed, as it seemed, officiously around his
bed; and what was worse, as the bed was but

<!-- vol 1 page 395 -->

narrow, the face without lineaments, the aspect
not to be thought of without horror, even in
the silence and absence of the grave, was now
close to his&mdash;the dead one was his silent
gliding chamberlain. There was no standing
this. Odo sprung from the bed, roused his
confessor, who was sleeping on the rushes,
fenced by relics above, below, and around, and
commanded his train to set forth that moment.
The storm had abated, and they gladly obeyed;
for they had heard some fearful whispers as
they waited, and all were ready on the instant:
some said a shadowy figure, without head or
shape, helped Odo to his stirrup, and bowed
as he rode off. I know not how it was,
the confessor retired into a monastery, the
squire was an idiot for life; so mine uncle, to
save charges, made him his fool; but amid his
fooleries he would utter such ghastly things
as made Odo's hair rise round his scalp.
Odo also withdrew his annual offering at
the shrine of St. Bernard, and defied them,
having impoverished himself by his lavish
endowment for ever."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 396 -->

<p>"Humph," quoth the abbot of Normoutier,
"he had the authority of a certain father for
it&mdash;<i>cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator</i>."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Sir Aymer, whispering
his next neighbour, "that is, I do not remember,
but I have heard in mine infancy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There he lies deeply," said De Montfort,
quaffing his goblet; "he remembers it well."</p>

<p>Sir Aymer whispered on&mdash;"a wild tale,
that on the annual night of that strange meeting
a voice is heard murmuring at the tomb of
Odo, (he lies interred in the chapel of the castle
du Chastelroi,) 'Wilt thou have thy cup filled,
Odo?' and an hour after, 'Is thy couch soft
and well-spread, Odo?' The effigy of mine
uncle lies on his monument in marble, his
feet on a couchant hound, his hands uplift in
prayer, his armed legs crossed; but it is said,
at these sounds the stony lips of the figure unclose
with a crashing noise like the opening of
a sepulchre, and sounds issue forth, that many
who watch at that fearful moment do not understand,
and the few who do have never dared
to interpret. By the mass, an' it be so, I would

<!-- vol 1 page 397 -->

not choose to <i>rest</i> with my grandsires!" and
Sir Aymer ended with his usual laugh.</p>

<p>"Laugh as thou wilt," said De Montfort,
who had listened with a kind of sullen attention,
"but there are those who have faith in
such tales;" and he seemed angry with himself
at the concession an inward and unavouched
feeling seemed suddenly to extort from him,
"My lord of Toulouse," he cried, "is it not
the truth that disembodied spirits may be
made visible to bodily eyes, avouched by holy
church?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said the bishop, who always
concealed his scepticism under a show of yielding
to the grossest superstitions of a gross age;
"and, noble De Montfort, perchance you have
had some proof of the point on which we bold
such dark and doubtful question."</p>

<p>"By the mass," said De Montfort, "something
comes dimly to my memory since Sir
Aymer spoke, which I had sooner were forgot!
I feel like one whom sudden mention of a
drear and desert country, through which he has
travelled, brings back to the recollection of the

<!-- vol 1 page 398 -->

dark stream, and leafless bush, and grey unsightly
stone, he encountered on his cheerless
way."</p>

<p class="center"><i>De Montfort's Tale</i>.</p>

<p>"About twenty years since I hunted the
wild boar and the wolf with Enguerrand de
Vitry and thy brother, Lord of Courtenaye, in
the woods of Languedoc. We had toiled three
days and nights in the chase; and on the evening
of the fourth, as the sun set amid heavy
clouds, and the forest shades fell deeper round
us, and a rustling wind among the leaves betokened
a gathering storm, I found myself
separated from my companions, amid a path
so trackless and overshadowed by interlacing
boughs of oak and elm and pine, that I might
as soon have made my way through the cloistered
passages of a cathedral, which they much
resembled.</p>

<p>"Mine attendants, to the number of twenty,
were well-armed with boar-spears and other
hunting gear; and they gave counsel to pass
the night on the spot, where the deep sward

<!-- vol 1 page 399 -->

formed a couch, and the broad oak a canopy;
and the glimmering moon, that now began to
show herself between the trees, seemed like the
lamp in my lady's bower, fitful and pale, yet
beaming sweet light on the dreamer's broken
rest, who looked up, and slumbered again.
Such was the page's song, who sung at my
knee while I lay on my folded mantle and
endeavoured myself to sleep. Suddenly there
was a shout among the huntsmen that they
descried a light at a distance. I started up, for
the mention of light was mingled in my half-begun dreams
with the discovery of a nest of
wolves or a troop of bears; and I urged on the
knaves, half in my sleep, till we reached a thick
avenue of trees, at the end of which opened a
glade unencumbered even with a shrub&mdash;a wide,
open, deep circle, from whence issued the
light we had seen: the wind had sunk, the
chilly rain had ceased to patter among the
forest-leaves&mdash;all was still&mdash;the light burned
clear, and as we advanced without whoop or
horn, what think you we beheld?"</p>

<p>"A group of sorcerers at their infernal incantations,"

<!-- vol 1 page 400 -->

said the Lord of Courtenaye, with
a deeper interest than his tone betrayed.</p>

<p>"A band of pilgrims," said the abbot of
Normoutier, "belated in their journey to some
holy shrine&mdash;perchance St. Benedict's&mdash;marry,
well fare them!"</p>

<p>"Travellers," said the bishop of Toulouse,
"who had lost their way, and had kindled a
fire to warm themselves withal."</p>

<p>"Ye err," said De Montfort; "it was a congregation
of these same pestilent heretics, more
than two hundred in number; and among them
was placed on high a preacher or barbe, as
they call him; and the light we followed arose
from a pine-torch, which some knave-heretic
held in his hands, while the preacher read
aloud lines from that forbidden book of which
our holy father has closed the leaves&mdash;such
was the sight."</p>

<p>"And how didst thou deal with them?"
asked Paladour.</p>

<p>"Askest thou how a hunter deals with a
brood of wolves&mdash;sire, dam, and whelp, all
helpless, and within the gash and gore of his

<!-- vol 1 page 401 -->

weapon?" said De Montfort, with a grim smile.
"Askest thou a crusader how I dealt with
heretics, unarmed too, and in my power? By
Heaven, there lives not one man, woman, child,
or infant clinging to the breast, to tell the deed
of that night, save those who wrought it! and
the hunter's boar-spears were as deeply dyed
as the brands of knights in battle! They
perished, kneeling as they were&mdash;none rose,
and none resisted; and it was bright morning
ere the huntsmen wiped their spears."</p>

<p>"It was a cursed deed," muttered Paladour.</p>

<p>"It was ten years after," said De Montfort,
not heeding, or perhaps hearing him, "that I
chanced to hunt again the wild boar and the
wolf in the same forest, in the same spot, or
near it. It was evening, when tracing the
windings of a thicket in pursuit of a wolf, who,
from size and fierceness, was the terror of all
that country, I found myself at the foot of a
rock without cavity or aperture. My pursuit
was checked&mdash;I had dismounted, and was
now on foot alone, amid a wildering thicket,

<!-- vol 1 page 402 -->

with no weapon save my hunting-spear in my
hand, and mine horn at my side. I climbed
the rock, not without danger, and saw around
me nought but the darkening mountains and
the declining day.</p>

<p>"I wound mine horn to summon my train,
but the sole answer was the echo from the dark
hills; and I will confess, that at the moment,
the meanest serf, who ran that day barefoot
beside my rein, would have been a sight most
welcome. I deem there was, beside the
dreariness of the spot, and the deepening
gloom of the evening, (now fast closing into
night,) an unwonted heaviness that hung on
me, and weighed me down. As I descended
into the hollow or ravine betwixt two stony
hills, (forbearing to wind mine horn, for the
sound, unanswered as it was by human voice,
added to the deep loneliness that surrounded
me,) I saw on the summit of a hill, the lowest
and nearest to me, a figure, small, mean, and
peasant-like. I shouted to him, and commanded
him to conduct me on my way. He
descended in a moment, but remained at a

<!-- vol 1 page 403 -->

distance from me; and though he appeared to
understand every sign I made, he never
answered to a word, though I strained my
voice to its utmost pitch. Still he beckoned
me onward, and signified, as it were, that he
would guide me; and I, seeing him in the
habit of a peasant, judged that he might be
ne'er the worse guide through those hilly passages,
and followed at mine utmost speed."</p>

<p>"Heap on more wood," said the Lord of
Courtenaye,&mdash;"the fire waxes low."</p>

<p>"Not so, Lord of Courtenaye," said De
Montfort, "with your fair leave, such tales are
ever best told by the dim and glowing embers.
It was not until we came within the deep and
narrow gorge, formed by two hills, rock from
summit to base, that I caught a distinct view
of my strange guide. I discovered he was in
the garb of an Albigeois, such as I had seen,
and I called and threatened louder; but
though his stature was dwarfish, and his
strength, mated with mine, had been as the
thistle-down's to the whirlwind's, yet his speed
so far surpassed mine, that, panting, I followed

<!-- vol 1 page 404 -->

him as I might. My mood hath been always
hot, and impatient of the peasant's insolence.
I strained my utmost strength to overtake and
slay him on the spot, (even though I might
wander among the mountains till I perished,)
but he was ever a bow-shot length before me,
and still he waved and beckoned with such
more than human eagerness, that, incensed
and well-nigh exhausted as I was, I could not
choose but follow. Thrice I flung mine hunting-spear
after him, and I was then no erring marksman,
but twice it fell far short of him; the
third time it seemed to pass through his body,
yet still he pressed on; and when I reached
the spot, it stood quivering and bloodless amid
a bunch of fern. At this moment the figure
had reached the summit of the path that
wound between those rocky hills, and he stood
there fixed as them, and beckoning me to
advance&mdash;I did so, sure that when I reached
him I would force him to speak, or make him
dumb for even I was within arm's length of
that dwarfish figure, which I now could distinctly
see between the receding hills, and

<!-- vol 1 page 405 -->

nought but the twilight sky behind his dusky
form, when, uttering a faint and wailing cry,
he bounded from where he stood, and plunged
into a dark glen, where the pine and larch
growing thickly hid him from my sight in a
moment. I know not, nor can I tell, nor do
I distinctly remember, the desperate and defying
feeling in which I plunged after him. I
sprung from crag to crag on my descent with a
speed and safety that seemed to myself supernatural:
the thick dark wood in the hollow
opened its bosom to receive me&mdash;as I entered
it, my brain cooled, and my senses settled;
and I saw, as distinctly as I now see this group,
in the wide opening glade, the same band of
heretics, barbe, torch-bearer, and all, in a kind
of ghastly mockery of devotion&mdash;they looked,
but not with the same visages; they prayed,
but not with the same voices; and they turned
on me, but&mdash;oh! they were the same, and not
the same. Maddened at the sight, as I am now
by the bare recital, I rushed among them&mdash;I
thought I did&mdash;but all rose to meet me, the
barbe with his book, the mother with her child,

<!-- vol 1 page 406 -->

the father with his young daughter, the crone
with her grandchild, the stripling with his
boy-brother, and the aged with their gray
shaking locks&mdash;and all were as the dead. I
heard the clattering bones&mdash;I saw the eyeless
sockets, the bare and grinning jaws.&mdash;I would
sooner have rushed on a thousand spears.&mdash;I
raised mine hunting-spear, but their cold eyes
seemed to have blunted its point and withered
the hand that held it.&mdash;They gathered round&mdash;they
closed in on me&mdash;St. Mary! I hear
them now!" he cried, clasping his hands on
his rough forehead, and bending forward for
a moment, as if a viewless choir were still
pealing in his ears.</p>

<p>"I know not how it fared with me&mdash;my
fellows found me stretched on the sward, in a
swoon, they said,"&mdash;he added in a more subdued
voice, but without raising his head, "and
I survived it.&mdash;But," he cried, suddenly lifting
up head and figure at once, and bursting into
a wild laugh, "was it not&mdash;might it not be all
a dream, a vision?&mdash;how sayest thou, lord
abbot?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 407 -->

<p>"That it was a mere device of the foul
fiend," quoth the abbot: "regard it no more
than I do this empty cup; fill it, knave!"</p>

<p>"But, my Lord of Courtenaye," said De
Montfort, whose brief fit of superstitious remorse
was over, "you who have urged us to
those dark tales could yourself tell a darker
still. What was that mysterious fate that
befell my lord, your brother? Men have spoken
strangely of it. Nay, never look on the tapestry,
man, as if its waving chided you, or on
the portraits as if they would start from their
frames.&mdash;Tell us truly how perished the Lord
of Courtenaye. Fellow, fill your lord's goblet!&mdash;he
looks deadly pale."</p>

<p>"Fill my lord's goblet, knave, dost thou
hear?" said the abbot, from association: "<i>in
vino veritas</i>."</p>

<p>"For a vile marksman, thou hast for once
hit the white," said the bishop of Toulouse,
internally.&mdash;"My Lord of Courtenaye, we
wait for your tale;" and his eye and voice assumed
a peculiar expression, that made the

<!-- vol 1 page 408 -->

Lord of Courtenaye quit his untasted goblet,
and, though dreadfully pale, enter abruptly on
the subject he was thus forced to.</p>

<p>"My brother," he said, or rather whispered,
"was a bold and approved warrior, and a true
Catholic; but he had ever a spirit and will to
pry into those things that are hidden from
man."</p>

<p>"I trust that spirit has not descended to his
family," said the bishop somewhat sternly, and
yet hesitatingly, as if he felt the remark might
be retorted.</p>

<p>"My brother's death," said the Lord of
Courtenaye, shuddering, "has been loudly
mouthed, and darkly whispered, as the talkers
were more or less confident or ignorant&mdash;but
I know the truth!"</p>

<p>"As if truth ever came out of that mouth!"
muttered the bishop: "let us have it then,
we pray you."</p>

<p>"My departed brother was fond of those
dark studies I have hinted at," said the Lord
of Courtenaye, commencing his solemn tale.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 409 -->

<p>"From which of his family did he learn
that taste?" said the abbot of Normoutier in
his <i>insouciance</i>.</p>

<p>No one heeded him, and the Lord of
Courtenaye proceeded&mdash;"Every year, it
was his wont, (I mean in the latter troubled
and unhappy years of his life,) on the eve of
St. Michael&mdash;but I tell my tale ill, noble
hearers.&mdash;I should have first related that there
was in the neighbourhood of our castle of
Beaurevoir a lake that lay among the mountains&mdash;a
dark, still, gloomy sheet of water,
that the traveller started when he beheld in
such a spot, where he looked only for a yawning
gorge amid the stony hills:&mdash;it was
said that in its waters no fish lived, and no
fowl dipped its wing&mdash;that it bore on its dark
surface only the reflection of the rocks that
impended over it, and of the twilight sky,
which their precipices darkened even at noon
into somewhat like the shadows of evening.
No peasant built his hut near the spot; the
wanderer who had lost his way struck into

<!-- vol 1 page 410 -->

another path, ere he would follow that, even
at midnight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough of the spot," said the bishop of
Toulouse; "we know it well."</p>

<p>"It was my brother's wont," continued the
Lord of Courtenaye, in a still more suppressed
and hollow tone, "on the eve of St. Michael,
as I have said, to embark on that lake in a
boat rowed by a single vassal&mdash;my brother
ever rowed back alone. The following year
he embarked at the same period with another
vassal, and returned again alone. Small count
is held of vassals' lives; but know not how it
was, when many such visits had chanced,
neither the scourge, nor torture, could force a
vassal, old or young,&mdash;&mdash;" he paused, and
then slowly resumed&mdash;"In the stormy twilight
of an autumnal eve, the eve of St. Michael,
(all day the wind had roared, and the waves
of the lake were crested with foam, and the
sky was dark as December;) on such an
evening my brother rowed forth on the lake
<i>alone</i>."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 411 -->

<p>"And when did he return?" asked the
abbot of Normoutier, starting from a doze.</p>

<p>"<i>Never!</i>" answered the bishop of Toulouse:&mdash;"My
Lord of Courtenaye, have ye
aught further to communicate concerning your
brother's fate?"</p>

<p>"Nought," said the Lord of Courtenaye,
applying his napkin to his eye, "save the
profound grief in which his mysterious disappearance
plunged our house."</p>

<p>At this moment, a laugh of derision, wild
and fiendlike, burst from behind the tapestry
of the hall; nor did it cease till every ear had
distinctly heard it. The contrast was so strong
as to force itself on the senses of all whom
these long tales had left awake. At the close
of Sir Aymer's and De Montfort's relations, wild
and vague as they were, the silence deepened,
the group gathered closer, the very rushing of
the wind, as it shook the hangings, was watched
with a kind of jealousy&mdash;all had been still, as
if inanimate things themselves had become
mute and anxious listeners; but the laugh
that followed the Lord of Courtenaye's tale of

<!-- vol 1 page 412 -->

his brother's fate seemed to announce other
than human listeners to his words.</p>

<p>"That was a ghastly sound," said the abbot,
effectually startled from his doze.</p>

<p>"It was the wind howling through the passages,"
said Sir Aymer: "our talk hath been
dismal, and such themes make men eager
interpreters of sad and boding sounds. I have
heard the wind sweep over a battle-field while
I rode in my harness; but in my lonely tower
of Chastelroi, its very whispers had sounded to
me like the wailings of the dead."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said the bishop with a stern
smile, "of winds that sighed, or moaned, yea,
uttered all sounds that imitated the tones of
human suffering, from the wail of the infant, a
span long, to the dying groan of man in the
strength of maturity; but never did I hear
before the winds accused of mocking the sound
of human laughter."</p>

<p>"And what other sounds," said the Lord of
Courtenaye, who perceived that the excited
feelings of his guests required a sudden change
to work them to his purpose; "and what other

<!-- vol 1 page 413 -->

sounds would you have to join in the burthen
of idle tales but those of laughter? Methinks
such tales told by dim light give pleasure like
that the cricket gives when he chirps faintly on
the hearth, and the slumbering warrior stretched
near it knows not whether that, or the minstrel's
drowsy note, is humming in his ears. But
what, my noble guests, if we turn this to matter
of mirth, after the sad and solemn talk that
hath held us so long? what if we prove these
things but toys&mdash;fables&mdash;mere vanities? The
proof lies within a moment's trial. There is
one, a woman too, whom some hold a sorceress,
and some mad&mdash;she hath shown some
curious tricks of art. Please you, my lords
and knights, to see them; 'twill be as pastime
after our sad supper. She is now in the vaults
of the castle&mdash;indeed she tenanteth chiefly in
vaults or in dismal places. What say ye,
Lords?&mdash;shall we visit her?&mdash;shall we hear
what she hath to tell, that we may mock at it
and her? Methinks it will be a merry period
to our sad controversy."</p>

<p>The guests shuddered as he spoke; but the

<!-- vol 1 page 414 -->

Lord of Courtenaye pursued his point, applying
himself dexterously to the individual feeling
of each he addressed:&mdash;"I have heard,"
he said in a mysterious whisper to the bishop,
"that she predicted the popedom to a cobler's
serf, and that a Holy Father should one day
have a laundress to his sister<sup id="ref020"><a href="#en020">20</a></sup>; and that a
goose and a swan should one day hiss the
Roman eagle from the Capitol;<sup id="ref021"><a href="#en021">21</a></sup> and that
though their wings would be scorched, their
flutter would extinguish the fire kindled by
their opposers&mdash;strange, unmeaning words,
my lord!"</p>

<p>"Strange, but perchance not unmeaning,"
said the bishop, starting from a reverie; "let
us see this woman, and hear what she hath to
say"&mdash;many things foretold by an astrologer, and
many others suggested by his own potent and
prophetic spirit, rushing on it at that moment.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 415 -->

<p>"Lord abbot," cried the Lord of Courtenaye,
encouraged by his success, "What!&mdash;shall
we skulk from the array of the Philistines
to-night, and visit this Witch of Endor?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said the abbot, who was now
very tolerably drunk, "wherefore not?&mdash;for
what saith a father&mdash;<i>magicas invitam accingier
artes</i>&mdash;and, as he sweetly added, <i>si nequeo
superos flectere, Acheronte movebo</i>."</p>

<p>"Noble guests!" said the Lord of Courtenaye,
pursuing his triumph as he addressed
the rest, "ye will not grudge to break a spear
in a visionary list, who have borne yourselves
in a real one so manfully to-day."</p>

<p>Paladour, under the influence of a feeling he
dared not avow even to himself, intimated his
compliance silently; but De Verac, hesitating,
whispered Semonville&mdash;"By my faith as a
knight! I like not these magical meetings;
(this castle is but too much noted for them;)
there will be such a smouldering smoke of
brimstone, sulphur, and unsavoury herbs, that
my sensitive organs would be sore offended;
and worse, my mantle and doublet turned to

<!-- vol 1 page 416 -->

such hues and drenched in such vapours, that
the devil himself could not abide them, were
he to tilt for recovery of his former state."</p>

<p>"I understand not that," said Semonville;
"nevertheless I would risk the meeting to-night,
but I have not my grandame's spell about
me&mdash;I would it were here; thou shouldst then
see how I would confront and confound the
sorceress."</p>

<p>As they whispered thus, the Lord of Courtenaye
had raised the tapestry that covered a
small and narrow arched door in the hall, and
looked back as if to assure them that some preparation
would be necessary.</p>

<p>This door opened on a nook, through which
Thibaud passed angrily, a torch in his hand,
and exclaiming, "Art thou mad, Lord of
Courtenaye?&mdash;dost thou bring churchmen to
witness that for which, in their holy charity,
they might commend thee to the care of the Inquisition?
Remember that though Ch&acirc;teauneuf
is dead, his spirit may yet kindle a fire in
Languedoc, whose flame will overtop thy
highest towers;" and he parted, his speech

<!-- vol 1 page 417 -->

being as brief as the glare of his torch, which
he flashed full before his intimidated lord.
The Lord of Courtenaye paused for a moment,
and dreaded to proceed in his purpose
without holding advice with him&mdash;his lips were
half open to call him back, even to entreat
him&mdash;then he reflected that the topics he would
have urged on Thibaud were such as perhaps,
if suppressed or concealed, would give him at
a future day added power over his vassal.
He had the presence of dignitaries of the
Catholic church to bear him out in all they
might see or imagine they saw: their presence
was ample sanction against the anger of the
church. Another motive, trembled at the
bottom of his coward heart: he wished for
witnesses to support his courage during this
terrible scene; but that was a motive he dared
not avow to his guests, or even to himself.
So, opening the narrow door again, and looking
into the hall, he whispered to Verac and
Semonville, "You go not with us, noble
knights." They nodded a refusal.</p>

<p>The door then admitted successively the

<!-- vol 1 page 418 -->

bishop of Toulouse, on whose brow sat a mingled
cloud of pride, daring hopes, and something
that resembled anxiety&mdash;it was impossible
it could be fear&mdash;the Count de Montfort, turbid,
dark, and restless as ever, went on like a wave
in a storm rushing to encounter a rock, though
fated to perish against it; he had not mental
power to analyse his feelings to their elements,
but he felt excitement: a summons to a new
species of trial and of peril, and a spirit that
defied them both to extremity&mdash;both of them
(though of far different characters and habits)
verified the words of our great dramatist:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>It ever is the marked propensity<br/>

Of restless and aspiring minds to look<br/>

Into the secrets of futurity.</p>

<p class="right">ETHWALD.</p>

</div>

<p>Then followed the abbot; supported by two
attendants, whose office was on this occasion
no sinecure, exclaiming loudly against <i>loups
garoux</i>, and all other goblins and fiends
whatever, let their operations and occupations
be what they would.</p>

<p>"Come, fiend or fury!" he cried, brandishing

<!-- vol 1 page 419 -->

his crosier, "I defy them in the name of
St Benedict!&mdash;shew me these spirits!&mdash;I will
exorcise thy vaults for thee, Lord of Courtenaye!&mdash;Bear
me gently down the steps, I
pray ye.&mdash;Oh ghost! Thou art no ghost of
this world; I promise thee, ere another hour
hath struck&mdash;gently ever, I pray ye!"</p>

<p>Paladour went last. The door was closed,
the tapestry dropt over it, and Verac and
Semonville were left the sole tenants of the
hall.</p>

<p>THE belief in the power of witchcraft, and its
influence as connected with that belief, were
during the dark ages in a state of fluctuation
and obscurity, equally puzzling to the historian
and the writer of romances.</p>

<p>The art was denounced as unlawful and
damnable, yet often resorted to by those who
reviled it the most. It was at once disclaimed
and confided in, forbidden, and employed.
Councils and courts consigned its professors to
flames temporal and eternal, yet nevertheless
"sought to them" on all occasions momentous
or trivial. All the thunderbolts of law, ecclesiastical
and civil, had been let loose against

<!-- vol 1 page 421 -->

them; and those who fulminated them with
the utmost fury admitted similar impostors to
their confidence, sheltered them in their castles,
and entrusted them with secrets big with all
their hopes of the present, or all their fears
of the future world.</p>

<p>Thus the wretched beings we have alluded
to, alternately persecuted and worshipped, tortured
or rewarded, passing from the closet of
the prince or prelate to the dungeon or the
stake and faggot, caught at their precarious
existence with a convulsive grasp, and dealt
about their spells, charms, and promises, in the
vaults of a castle one night, for vast reward,
at the risk of perchance blazing in its court
on the following day.</p>

<p>These observations were perhaps necessary
to introduce the reader to the scene that was
now acting in the vaults of the castle of Courtenaye,
and to the beings who were the performers
in it.</p>

<p>The vault to which the Lord of Courtenaye
led his guests by many steps of stone was of
vast extent&mdash;arch beyond arch, solid, low,

<!-- vol 1 page 422 -->

and strongly built of stone, seemed intended
to lead to recesses of interminable darkness.
There was a kind of compartment where four
low arches of stone rose from the paved floor;
the roof was in that place vaulted above; and
by the sport or spleen of the architect, or
perchance by order of the founder, the arches
were springing from corbels hewed into the
faces of demons, their hideousness magnified
by their being strongly hewn out in stone, and
presenting features "grotesque and grim"
beyond the dream of the sufferer under the
nightmare to paint or to imagine.</p>

<p>Beneath the midmost arch of this vault sat
a form, clothed in rags, applying fuel to a cauldron
that was slow in seething. She drew
from her withered bosom fragments of charmed
wood, and placed them slowly and carefully
under the cauldron&mdash;still it boiled not. The
hag, in the inveteracy of her nature, cursed
the inanimate materials, and then sat rocking
beside the embers, when two other forms
appeared through the arches of the vault.
They were both women far advanced in years,

<!-- vol 1 page 423 -->

yet still possessing marked muscular strength
of frame, inveterate malignity of aspect, but
something of decision of character in their expression
that had its effect alike on the aged
and the young.</p>

<p>"And what hast thou done?" said the elder
of the twain; "has the cauldron seethed?"</p>

<p>"Six hours have I drudged here," growled
the hag, "till my limbs are numbed, and mine
eyes are bleared, and thou seest my toil is
bootless yet."</p>

<p>"I bring that which will aid it," said the
other, crouching beside her, and displaying her
lap full of withered herbs: "here be marmartin
and mandragora, pannax and hemlock; and
that herb," she said, twisting it within her bony
fingers, "which frustrates all the hopes of
love; and that also which makes those love
to madness who hated before to death."</p>

<p>"And what is that," said her companion,
"to what I bring? Here be nightshade, slips
of yew, (churchyard yew, mark that!) and
cypress, and wolfsbane, and," with a pause
of horrid delight, "a branch of sycamore that

<!-- vol 1 page 424 -->

grew from a parricide's grave; and this weed,
whose name I trow not, but it grew fresh and
fair on the grave of one whose crime woman's
tongue cannot utter&mdash;the better for our purpose."</p>

<p>"Pour them into the cauldron, and cause the
fire to glow," said the crone, who had tarried
for them.</p>

<p>"I will pour in mine first," said one of them,
advancing to the cauldron.</p>

<p>"<i>Thou!</i>" cried the other, interposing;
"thou hag and witch from thy birth&mdash;thou to
mingle thy paltry ingredients before <i>me</i>&mdash;thou
that never gatheredst herbs but from a
common."</p>

<p>"And where hast thou gathered thine, thou
wrinkled succuba!" answered her compeer,
"that thou givest me terms so foul?"</p>

<p>"From the church-yard&mdash;from the vault&mdash;from
the ruins where murder hath been,"
rejoined the other beldam:&mdash;"have I not
been where thou darest not be&mdash;where wolves
were tearing the dead from the graves?&mdash;have
I not grappled with them, and wrenched the

<!-- vol 1 page 425 -->

bones from their jaws?&mdash;where the bat whizzed
past me, watched I not till I caught him by
his leathern wing?&mdash;where the battened toad
croaked from his hole, whose fingers tore him
out?"</p>

<p>"Thou liest," cried her antagonist; "thou
never knewest what it was to lame or dry up
cattle, or to spoil harvest, in thy long and
worthless lifetime."</p>

<p>"I have made," said the other, in the
miserable emulation of wickedness, "I have
made more wed-beds fruitless than thou couldst
for thy art, were thy master at thy back."</p>

<p>"Hag and fiend!" exclaimed the former,
darting on her with the springs and fangs of a
wild cat, and grasping her by the throat.</p>

<p>"Forbear!&mdash;forbear!" said she who had
first sat beside the cauldron; and rising, with
difficulty she tore them asunder.</p>

<p>They stood panting, ghastly, and menacing,
at the opposite sides of the cauldron; while she
exclaimed, "Are you mad?&mdash;are not famine
and faggot enough here, but ye will kindle
the eternal fire for yourselves before the time&mdash;see

<!-- vol 1 page 426 -->

how bright and blue the flame arises!"&mdash;and
whether from the ingredients supplied, or
from some other circumstance operating on
the ignition, the flame burst forth so darkly
blue as to give the countenances of the hags
who cowered round it a hue beyond all human
paleness&mdash;a hue preternatural and even diabolical.</p>

<p>The signal operated punctually on their
associations.&mdash;"Haste and feed the flame,"
said the twain in a breath: "an' it had not
blazed so brightly, <i>she</i> whom we tarry for had
rated us like dogs."</p>

<p>"I marvel what gave her tongue such license,"
rejoined the other.</p>

<p>"I marvel more what gave it such power,"
said the first; "for I have felt it thrill through
blood and marrow; it is a sound I hate to
hear, yet dare not disobey."</p>

<p>"Wo to us since the hour we knew her!"
said the other, and they suddenly exchanged
their mutual hostility for a mutual whine of
condolence. "Wo to us since that hour!&mdash;she
rules us as a lord would his serfs&mdash;it was

<!-- vol 1 page 427 -->

better times when the noblest and the fairest
of the land came to our hovels with hands full
of agnuses and bezants."</p>

<p>"And so it was," said the other, busily
feeding the flame the while, and nodding a
ghastly acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Ay, thou rememberest," continued the
hag, "and so do I&mdash;there came the lady
wrapped in her handmaid's veil to ask tidings
of her lover&mdash;I knew her by her tripping
tread and mincing voice. Ay, and the lord
hid in the guise of his meanest serf, to ask his
fate in some distant battle&mdash;crusades they
called them, then fought against Pagans far
away&mdash;crusades they call them still, though
they now slay only their own countrymen. I
knew <i>him</i> too by his proud tone and lofty
tread. Gold, gold," she cried, "hath creased
this withered hand&mdash;the mother hath left
me her last kid to tell the fate of her son gone
to battle, and I devoured it, while I knew her
stripling lay lifeless ere its limbs were seethed;
and the abbot, muffled above his tonsure, hath
left me the value of his ring and crosier to

<!-- vol 1 page 428 -->

foretell the fate of the mitred bishop, in whose
stall he was fain to sit; and both have been
cold in the earth, while my old blood was
warmed by the wine that I purchased with the
gift, to quaff healths that would have made
their bones burst through cerement and sepulchre
to hear!"</p>

<p>"Ay, those were the times that we have
seen," answered the coadjutor, plying her task;
"and now&mdash;and now, we are sent to gather
weeds in a churchyard at <i>her</i> command. I
tremble to speak of her when I know she is
leagues distant; yet do I hate her deadly&mdash;deadly!
Would," added she, thrusting a bundle
of weeds under the cauldron, "would that
this were the brand to light her stake!"</p>

<p>"Would that it were," said a low, but
deep-toned voice; and she of whom they had
been speaking stood suddenly among them&mdash;"would
that it were! But the brand that blazes
for me will never be lit by thy hand." And
without further notice of what she must have
overheard, she continued, "To your task, to
your task! those are gathering around ye who

<!-- vol 1 page 429 -->

may rend you piecemeal for your delay!"
The wretched assistants crouched around the
cauldron.</p>

<p>Fresh fuel was added&mdash;the flame blazed
bright and blue, sending a flitting light round
the ribbed arches, and the inferior agents
renewed their toil, and plied their task in
silence. Meanwhile, their chief, who was no
other than she who had rowed Paladour over
the lake, and assisted at the secret councils of
the Lord of Courtenaye, began to prepare
herself slowly and, as it seemed, carelessly, for
the fearful scene she was about to preside at;
she threw off her large mantle, gave some
herbs to one of the attendants, and a flask of
medicated oil to another; and then drawing
some other ingredients from her bosom, which
she examined without showing to her associates,
said, "These will avail&mdash;a few nights more
of toil and of suffering&mdash;of darkness and delusion&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;feed ye the flame," she
added aloud,&mdash;"and quickly and fiercely,&mdash;for
I hear the sound of steps that I must meet,
and of voices that I must speak with." And

<!-- vol 1 page 430 -->

as she spoke, she placed a small triangular
piece of black marble on the block of stone,
and bade her assistants retire for a space.
The hags arose from their crouching posture,
muttering, more from inveterate habits of
discontent and malignity than from any purpose
or power of resistance. "Obey me!&mdash;begone!"
said the mistress of the spell&mdash;"I
hear steps approaching." Steps approached&mdash;the
iron door, low, narrow, and strongly
barred, slowly admitted the visitors,&mdash;"and
welcome," she said, displaying all the height
and grandeur of a form naturally majestic,
and now elevated by preternatural excitement,
and the power of concentrated passions, to a
kind of fiend-like grandeur,&mdash;"Welcome,"
to De Montfort, "thou glorious and gilded
butcher&mdash;whom men have girt in iron, and
called a noble and a knight: and welcome thou
(to the Lord of Courtenaye) who hadst always
the heart to slay, but never the hand to strike
the blow:&mdash;and welcome thou (to Paladour),
thou <i>predoomed</i> murderer&mdash;the deed that is to
be, must be done&mdash;avert not thy head, and

<!-- vol 1 page 431 -->

delay not thy step; but nerve thy hand and
harden thy hearts&mdash;for so it must be: but
come not thou!" she shrieked, in more exalted
tones, as the Bishop of Toulouse entered&mdash;"come
not thou, lest the vault should split
over thy head and mine,&mdash;never, never must
we meet, till we meet at last on the verge of
the lake of fire, and to its lowest bottom will
I sink with a smile, if I may but see thee first
weltering on its billows."</p>

<p>The visitors, somewhat appalled at the
language and gesture with which they were
encountered, paused at the threshold, with the
exception of the Bishop of Toulouse, and
some powerful associations seemed to be awakened,
as he fixed his eyes on the wretched
female, who, from being almost convulsed,
was now speechless from deep and terrible
emotion.</p>

<p>"Heed her not," whispered the Lord of
Courtenaye to the rest, (dreading the disappointment
of the purpose he had planned)&mdash;"heed
her not&mdash;she talks wildly, poor
distracted soul! specially at the sight of

<!-- vol 1 page 432 -->

strangers; but when her frenzy hath past
away&mdash;as in brief space it will&mdash;she will become
communicative and tractable as one of
your jongleurs that sing at the gate, or sport
in the hall, and predict successful chase to
the lord, and noble wooers to the lady of the
castle, faster than they know how to tell their
beads."</p>

<p>It seemed as if he spoke truth,&mdash;the flash
departed from the eye&mdash;the excitement and
dilation from the figure of the object he
pointed to&mdash;her very garments seemed to
sink and subside into quieter folds,&mdash;her eyes
lost all light, her features all colour, her form
all expression, character, and power.</p>

<p>"I said it would be so," whispered the Lord
of Courtenaye.&mdash;"Now mark her,&mdash;now
the fit is o'erpast,&mdash;mark what will follow."</p>

<p>The change did not seem more to the taste
of the visitors, as the vision, for such she now
appeared to be, with pale aspect, extended
arm, and lips unclosed, waved them slowly
and silently into the interior of the vault.
They paused&mdash;but their character for courage

<!-- vol 1 page 433 -->

was at stake&mdash;and they followed, all
internally uttering vows, or searching their
memory for counter-spells, but Paladour.
As they followed, the blue flame that glowed
beneath the cauldron, and gleamed on the
arches of the vault, was extinguished; a thick
smoke, or rather vapour, for it had no repulsive
smell or stifling effect, formed their atmosphere&mdash;they
felt for each other's hands in
the darkness; and however divided in passions,
interests, and habits, they were discovered to be
thus linked together hand in hand, (all damp
and cold,) when the triangular block of marble
began slowly to effuse a pale and sulphurous
light. As the light developed surrounding
objects, it was seen that the bishop of Toulouse
still stood alone, strongly fixing his eyes on
the female, who now was seen, pale, calm, and
resolved, beside her fearful preparations.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>De Verac and Semonville had walked
silently for an hour up and down; at length
the latter turned abruptly on his companion,&mdash;"A

<!-- vol 1 page 434 -->

thought&mdash;a sudden thought hath struck
me deeply," said he.</p>

<p>"That I should change my lilac scarf for
one of crimson," said De Verac, stopping.</p>

<p>"I thought of no such matter," said Semonville,
doggedly.</p>

<p>"And of what else couldst thou be thinking?"
said he of the scarf.</p>

<p>"Not of thy complexion, I promise thee,&mdash;but
whether we should be sworn brothers or
foes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Foes!&mdash;wherefore should we be foes?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not, nor do I much care. I
had as lieve be foe as friend with any man&mdash;I
care not whom&mdash;such is my humour. I see
how matters fare in this castle, whither I was
sent, chiefly at my grandame's instance, to woo
the Lady Isabelle. This Sir Paladour bears
down all before him. He hath foiled De
Montfort in the lists; he makes the Lord of
Courtenaye tremble at his board-end, if he
but glance at him. I have seen it."</p>

<p>And here Verac was astonished at the

<!-- vol 1 page 435 -->

acuteness which fools often display in the
observation of circumstances and manners.
He recollected the Lord of Courtenaye had
more than once shown terror and aversion at
the sight of Paladour, and he wondered at his
not having first discovered and observed it.&mdash;As
he stood silent&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art more busied," said the blunt De
Semonville, "twisting the scarf into folds
than in listening to my words,&mdash;yet I tell
thee the foldings of thy scarf were merely
scorned in the tourney."</p>

<p>"Scorned!" repeated De Verac instantly,
roused by a reflection on his attire.</p>

<p>"Yea; and I tell thee, moreover, as thou
rodest into the lists, the ladies said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Said what?&mdash;What could they say?&mdash;My
plumage was foreign, and of a most delicate
fancy."</p>

<p>Fool as he was, Semonville felt he was
now master of the key to which alone Verac's
feelings uttered harmony or discord, and he
pursued his advantage.</p>

<p>"Dame Marguerite&mdash;I answer not for

<!-- vol 1 page 436 -->

her taste&mdash;Dame Marguerite likened your
helmet to her fan; a handle of silver, and a
forest of feathers waving above and around."</p>

<p>"Malicious hag, she lied! The plumage
was fair, curious, and well-assorted."</p>

<p>"Ay, and so were thine hose the night
before, when thou wert dancing, and yet men
say there might be better legs than thine."</p>

<p>"I defy them," said Verac, drawing up
his hose, and showing a taper and well-formed
limb. "I defy them! I care not what they
say of my form and feature&mdash;let them call
me uncomely&mdash;any thing&mdash;but let them not
dispraise my scarf and attire."</p>

<p>"Do I not point out the way to work thy
will, and meet thy wish?" said Semonville.
"The Lady Isabelle scorns us both; let us
be brothers in arms for mere hatred, and
sworn friends for mortal malice,&mdash;for methinks
I would like to defeat that Paladour of his love."</p>

<p>"Thou sayest well, and I accept thy
pledge," said De Verac, after pausing a moment,
and then he grasped eagerly the proffered
hand of De Verac.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 437 -->

<p>At that moment a wild and horrid cry,
the fierce yell of masculine agony, in its most
horrid extremity, made Verac relax his grasp.</p>

<p>"The Work of hell is going on below,"
he cried, in the horror of sudden conviction:
then, with an illapse of gallant feeling, which
was indeed natural to him, "Could brand
or lance aid them, I would hack them to
splinters on the dungeon walls, wherein they
have enclosed themselves; but no mortal help
may avail them <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"An I had my grandmother's spells," muttered
Semonville, "I would no more heed
fiends well-enclosed in a vault, (where I might
deal with them roundly, provided they never
passed their bounds,) than I would a community
of the heretics, whom I would indeed
give their choice of death by flame or
sword, or as they might wish&mdash;for I always
seek to be courteous in such matters&mdash;but
in truth I will confess to thee, that mine hair
stands almost upright. And I have no
weapons," he added, half drawing his dagger,

<!-- vol 1 page 438 -->

"for such enemy as they are dealing with
now." And he was hastening from the hall.</p>

<p>"It were pity and shame to leave them
in such strait," said Verac; his natural courage
struggling with his superstitious feelings. Another
horrid and indescribable sound bursting
on his ears, made him catch Semonville's
arms for support.</p>

<p>"It were worse," said Semonville, pushing
him out, "to have this huge hall crumble over
our heads;&mdash;mine, I know, could never sustain
the weight, however thicker skulls might
fare. If this gear hold in the Castle of Courtenaye,
I would sooner couch in my grandmother's
closet, which all know to be haunted,
than in the chamber of the Lady Isabelle.
If one must needs be haunted, it were
better by the ghosts of one's own family than
by those of strangers. What, the devil, dalliest
thou for?"</p>

"I doubt I have left a certain favour
behind me," said Verac, lingering; "it was a
knot, <i>couleur-de-rose</i>, which I always bore on

<!-- vol 1 page 439 -->

the sleeve of my purple tunic, since a fair
hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tarry an thou wilt," said Semonville,
hurrying away himself; "perchance, if thou
delayest, no fair hand, but a fiery fang, will
fasten on thee another kind of favour."</p>

<p>"The saints forbid!" cried Verac, darting
through the passage.</p>

<p>"Amen, Amen!" quoth Semonville, who
was first in the flight.</p>

<p>Rapidly as they sought and gained their
apartments, the fearful sounds they had heard
seemed to pursue them. They paused&mdash;listened&mdash;the
sounds ceased on a sudden&mdash;they
plunged into their beds, and drawing
their silken quilts high above their heads,
muttered their night-spells earnestly under the
quivering coverlet.</p>

<p>Oh, ransom, ransom, do not hide mine eyes.</p>

<p class="right">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>WE have told, in a preceding chapter, if
the reader should happen to remember it,
that Sir Amirald on hearing the cries of a
female hastened to her rescue. The knight
and his steed were indeed wearied wandering
among the hills without shelter or food,
when they appeared suddenly stirred at
the summons, as if the high impulses of
chivalry operated simultaneously on both,
the knight applying his spurs, and the steed
quickening his pace at the signal, exhaustion
and weariness forgotten at the
appeal.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

<p>To understand the cause of the knight's
career, which he pursued at full gallop
among the rocky defiles at the risk of his
life, we must retrograde a few steps, and
return to the scene that passed in the cave
of the Albigeois on the night we have before
described. Genevieve had sat supporting
her grandfather's head on her knees, after
carefully spreading under his chilled limbs
her mantle of woollen cloth, and gazed on
a fissure of the cavern through which the
moonlight streamed, and felt as she gazed
the deep wish to solemnize her feelings, and
abstract them if possible from anxious and
troubled views of her earthly destination&mdash;the
solicitudes for that "frail and feverish
being," which though forced on her by necessity,
her pure heart felt it like a crime to
dwell on in her hours of lonely reflection.</p>

<p>The preceding scene had touched her mild
but acute perceptions deeply. "And here,"
she said to herself, "even here, where a
number of persecuted beings are assembled

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

together to worship God,&mdash;even here dissension
and discord are reigning; and those
who are weak against the strong are making
themselves weaker by division amongst themselves!"</p>

<p>She mused, then turning to that holy
beam which glowed brightly on fragment
and fissure, and tinted even the small crags
and airy foliage with a silvery and visionary
light, she murmured, "Oh that I had wings
like a dove, for then would I flee away
and be at rest!"&mdash;"Genevieve, Genevieve,"
whispered a voice at this moment, low
but audible. She listened, but perceived not
from whence it came. The sound was repeated,
and a figure like that she had first
seen passed before the aperture, dimming the
moonlight as it crossed its beams, and a
voice again called on the name of Genevieve.
She remembered the ghastly figure which had
visibly crossed the entrance of the cavern
that disastrous night, and she heard the voice
again whisper, "Genevieve." She listened

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

with a feeling that wandered between vision
and reality; her imagination took part with
her senses, enfeebled by famine and fatigue&mdash;she
saw all objects falsely, and exaggerated
as through a mist: she half believed it
might be an intimation from no earthly voice,
and gently laying the head of the pastor on
her folded mantle, and rising with cramped
and shivering limbs, she tried to gain the
entrance of the cavern.</p>

<p>It was a venturous progress among those
who slept, and whom she feared to awake,
more than to disobey the impulse under
which she advanced. Her gentle steps trod
among men sunk in sullen but still watchful
slumber, who murmured the war-word in
their dreams, and who at the lightest sound
that reached their sleeping senses would have
started to arms or to prayer: she trod still more
gently, her fairy foot scarce touching earth,
when she approached where mothers lay
with their infants&mdash;<i>them</i> she most feared to
disturb. Her light step, her slender form,

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

her quiet solicitude, won her way for her
unnoticed and unmolested; she reached the
entrance of the cavern, and a human figure
covered with blood stood there to greet her.
She shrunk back for a moment, then clasping
her hands over her eyes, stood to listen with
that deep habitual feeling of self-possession
which early misfortune had taught her.</p>

<p>"You know me not, then," said the figure
bathed in blood, "you know me not." It was
the voice of Amand, the young Albigeois, who
had always been deemed timid even to cowardice,
who had never wielded a club, or joined
the sorties of the young peasants in the course
of his life before. Mild, indolent, and contemplative,
he had attended with reverence
the assemblies of the Albigeois, and listened
with profound attention to the exhortations
of the Barbes; but neither the devout nor
the warlike of the community seemed to
consider him worthy of farther notice, than
for the former to wonder that one so reverent
and attentive had never aspired to give

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

"the word of exhortation," and the latter
to remark his increasing stature, and marvel
that he never wielded "the sword of the
Lord against the mighty:"&mdash;the men thought
of him as nothing, and the women as worse
than nothing. "And is it thus I see thee,
and none but thee?"&mdash;"Thou wouldst, then,
have seen other than me?" said Amand,
with a peculiar expression; "yet for thy
sake am I <i>thus</i>. I was deemed a coward&mdash;I
have proved I am not: behold I am covered
with blood!"</p>

<p>"I never thought&mdash;" said Genevieve, not
knowing what to say; "but to see thee thus
covered with blood is horrid to mine eyes:
we have wandered, wept, and prayed together&mdash;and
I know not how this new aspect
of thine in war terrifies me. Was it thou
I beheld to-night, as thou didst darkly seem
to cross the entrance of the cavern?"&mdash;He
was silent: "And why didst thou disappear
on the instant?"</p>

<p>"I shrunk when I beheld thee, Genevieve:
I had madly hoped to die in thy sight, but,

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

when I saw thee, the love of life stirred in
me again."</p>

<p>"But why art thou here so late, and
wherefore here at all?" said Genevieve.
"Thy wounds need tending, and thou hast
nought of hope or comfort to tell."&mdash;"If
my wounds lack tendance, I ask thee not to
be my leech," said Amand impatiently: "if
I have nought of hope or comfort to tell, I
have that to tell which is of import to thee&mdash;if
I have breath to utter it. Thy beauty,
Genevieve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mine!" exclaimed the startled girl,
shrinking as from the charge of crime,
"mine! and is this the moment thou hast
chosen for topic so light and vain?"</p>

<p>"Farewell, farewell," said Amand, rushing
from her; "thou art displeased with me;
but I shall perish to-morrow, and let that
be remembered as a palliation, if my words
have offended thee this night."</p>

<p>"Nay stay, Amand, stay, I pray thee,"
said the trembling girl, "and tell me, I

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

charge thee by our common creed, if I have
aught to dread, exceeding the trials my people
are exposed to."</p>

<p>"Thou wishest then to hear of the fame
of thy beauty, while thou affectest to shrink
from its mention," said Amand, with an
expression which was but too well suited
to his harsh but marked and expressive features:
"then hear. When we encountered
with those children of the Anakim, for such
they seemed in stature, forces and power&mdash;with
the sons of Belial, for such they are,
luxurious and loose&mdash;when they cut us down
like the grass of the field, and trampled on
us as the peasant treads on the weeds of his
path&mdash;what was the war-cry of one?&mdash;'Saint
Genevieve of the Albigeois!'&mdash;Oh, Genevieve,
we have been children together&mdash;we
have been nurtured in the same faith,
and trod the mountain, and breathed the
breeze, and sung and prayed, and smiled
and wept together&mdash;oh, pledge me then thy
faith, Genevieve, that (if it so should chance)

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

the fame and praise of thy fair beauty, the
courtly talk of goodly and gallant knights,
and, above all, the profane and flattering
gallantry of him men call the Abbot of Normoutier,
will not, will not, turn thine heart,
or thy faith, or thy brain."</p>

<p>"Is thy brain turned," said the maiden,
"that thou askest such question? What
know I of thy knights and thine abbot?
and which of those sons of pride would
deign a glance to the peasant maiden?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve!" said the youth, with
agonizing earnestness, "thou knowest not
what thou sayest: they might not descend
to persuade; but (his voice became not
louder; but more intense and emphatic in its
tones) thy youth, thy innocence, thy eloquence,
heaven-taught, and uttered in tones
that breathe of Heaven, would vainly plead
against that enemy thou ever bearest about
thee."</p>

<p>"Is it mine evil heart of unbelief?" said
Genevieve. "What other enemy have I?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

"I speak of thy beauty," said Amand:
"that is thine enemy&mdash;thy sole, thy worst;
for which of the daughters of men can vie
with thee in beauty, and who would be a
more acceptable prize and prey to the ruthless
knights and licentious churchmen who
call themselves Crusaders?"</p>

<p>The unhappy girl stood confounded at this
intimation of a danger, to which her unconsciousness
of or indifference to her own exterior,
combined perhaps with the hourly exigencies
of a life of peril and suffering, had
hitherto rendered her insensible. She stood
silent for some time; and then raising her
eyes, fixed them on Amand with an expression
of appeal the most piteous and piercing.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her companion, answering her
looks, "I came to shew thee at once thy
danger and thy safety:&mdash;there is a retreat.&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was much agitated, and his voice became
inarticulate.</p>

<p>"But wherefore," said Genevieve, gazing
timidly around her on scenery she beheld for

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

the first time&mdash;"wherefore hast thou led me
so far from the cave?"</p>

<p>"It was lest we might disturb the sleepers,"
said Amand.</p>

<p>"I will go no farther," answered she:
"speak what thou hast to tell here, or rather
let me return to my retreat and hear it
there."</p>

<p>"Thy father lies stretched near the entrance,
and thou knowest the lightest whisper
were enough to break his slumbers," replied
Amand.</p>

<p>Genevieve paused, prepared to listen, but
resolved not to advance; and he described
in a confused manner a retreat among the
hills that surrounded them, known only to
himself, and tenanted by an Albigeois family,
who lived in unmolested tranquillity, practising
their worship unsuspected, amid solitudes
unviolated by the cruelty, unknown even by
the jealousy, of persecution. "And thither
I will bear thee ere dawn," he continued,
speaking rapidly; "and let priest, or peer, or

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

fiend in league with them, trace thee if he
can."</p>

<p>There was something pictorial, hollow, and
fallacious in the style of his description that
had more than once struck Genevieve in the
course of it, rapidly as it was delivered. She
suppressed her doubt, however; but hastened
to terminate their conference.</p>

<p>"Thine offer is vain," she said: "I accept
of no retreat that does not also shelter my
father;" and she turned towards the cavern.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not choose!" said Amand,
fiercely: "thinkest thou I came hither to talk?
In the depths of the wild woods, in the caves
of the mountains, in the clifts of the rocks,
would I rather see thee stretched at my side
and perishing with famine, than behold thee
the paramour of a glorious Crusader. Amid
the mountains thou wast born, and amid the
mountains, please Heaven! thou shalt perish,
though such is not thy wish." As he spoke,
he had raised her in his arms and carried her
to some distance.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

Genevieve struggled gently for a time,
scarce believing such violence was intended
her; at length she made her strongest effort,
and attempted, but vainly, to extricate herself.</p>

<p>"Why didst thou not suffer me to depart?"
cried Amand, overcoming her struggles:
"why didst thou not suffer me to flee, when
I would have done so? My conscience smote
me&mdash;I fled; but thy voice recalled me, and
thou must abide the result of thine own wild
will."</p>

<p>Genevieve struggled more vehemently, and
with increased terror; but her strength was
no match for that of Amand, who, though
timid and feeble, displayed on this occasion
a force with which female strength contended
in vain. He had borne her up a
rocky steep, and, scarce drawing breath, was
preparing to ascend another, when from
behind a projecting angle of the rocky path
two men suddenly started forth, part of
their armed figures gleaming in the setting

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

moonlight, and part shrouded by their dark
houplands. Without speaking a word, they
struck Amand to the earth; and then
seizing on Genevieve, they enfolded her in
one of their long dark cloaks, and attempted
to stifle her cries by drawing it closely round
her while they bore her on between them.
There was no need for the attempt&mdash;her
terror suppressed all outcry; and it was not
till they had borne her to some distance, that
she collected the feeble force of her suppressed
voice to implore for mercy. "Mercy!"
said one of the captors; "what mercy deservest
thou, who canst not pay a liard for
thy ransom, and has cost us more toil than if
we were to bear a nun from a cloister?"&mdash;"Befall
what may," said the other, "she
will be no unacceptable prize to one of the
Crusaders who are feasting at the Castle of
Courtenaye."</p>

<p>At these words Genevieve uttered a
shriek so loudly that her companions, without
mercy or hesitation, threatened to stifle

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

it by the most ruthless means if she dared
to utter it again.</p>

<p>The cry, however, had reached other ears.
As Genevieve was hurried on, half-stifled,
half-dead with terror, she heard distinctly
a voice (though its feminine tones seemed
to give but little hope of defence) exclaim,
"Hold, caitiffs! miscreants! whither are
ye bearing that burthen between ye?"&mdash;"It
is a corse we are bearing to be interred,
the due rites being first said over it
by the Abbot of Normoutier," quoth one of
the bearers.&mdash;"It is a prede taken from the
heretics, which we want the blessing of some
holy man to consecrate to the use of Holy
Church," said the other: and as they spoke
both in the same breath, and in the same
moment, the stranger, whoever he was, had
no hesitation in believing both accounts
false.</p>

<p>"Mercy! for the love of Heaven," exclaimed
Genevieve, in a struggling and stifled
voice, which, faint as it was, seemed to thrill

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

through the ears of her champion by the
answer he made on the instant. "Is it a
corse ye bear? set it down on the spot, or,
by Mary's might, that abbot ye name will
have to sing a mass over <i>your</i> hilding corses,
instead of that ye pretend to bear."</p>

<p>The men returned no answer; but the
next moment Genevieve (whom her captors
had flung on the ground) heard blows dealt
about so heavily and heartily, that she scarce
could believe they were bestowed by an
arm that appertained to one whose voice
was so soft and feminine. Those blows, so
lustily dealt, decided the point in less than
two minutes; but ere those had elapsed,
Genevieve, though stunned by the shock and
fall, had disentangled herself from the folds
of the houpland, and tried to gaze around;
and by the light of the stars, (more vivid than
moonlight in other regions,) she beheld the
slender figure of a youth contending, and not
in vain, with two muscular ruffians. He was
armed, and his antagonists soon betook themselves

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

to flight, exclaiming it was sooth that
the devil always helped his friends, nor could
they hope better meed for dealing with a
heretic Albigeoise.</p>

<p>Genevieve rose from the earth, on which
she had sunk in gratitude, and stood before
her young preserver without the power of
speech. He had, indeed, saved her from the
outrage of ruffians; but she knew the habits of
that lawless age too well to deem her danger
less in the hands of a youthful knight, generous
and valiant as he had proved himself in
her cause. Through her instinctive sense of
her danger, quickened by the hints of Amand,
as well as by her late peril, she folded her mantle
about her, so as to shroud both her face
and person, and stood trembling in irresolute
and ungracious silence.</p>

<p>Her champion seemed as embarrassed as
herself; he was fatigued by the struggle,
and he mused how he might address a shape
so silent, and apparently unconscious of the
service he had just rendered her.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

<p>"Is it indeed a corse that I have rescued?"
said he, at length approaching her; and his
young and gentle tones inspiring her with
confidence, she ventured to answer, "It is
one who would ere this have wished she
were a corse, were it not for thy valour,
sir knight."</p>

<p>"Fair saint," said the youth, addressing
her in the strain of the age&mdash;"fair saint,
draw the curtain of thy shrine, that I may
see and worship."</p>

<p>"Your devotion, sir knight, would be ill
bestowed," said Genevieve, timidly.</p>

<p>"By the favour of our Lady, I have saved
thee from some danger," said the youth;
"and may I not be guerdoned by a glimpse
of thy fair form, a glance of thine eye, a
touch of thine hand, or perchance of thy
red lip, in requital?"</p>

<p>Genevieve felt her danger equal at least to
her obligation; but she took her resolution in
a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, with all, sir knight," she answered,

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

unfolding her mantle; "and with more than
all&mdash;for here are not only eye, and hand, and
lip; but fame and honour, body's safety, and
soul's price, entrusted to thee. I am a peasant
maiden, an Albigeoise: the child of
those against whom thy faith and thine arms
are pointed alike; for well I guess thou
art a Crusader. I am in thy power; but
feel, therefore, that as thou art noble, I am
safe."</p>

<p>There was a trembling majesty in her
form and accents as she spoke, an appeal
without power, a fear that commanded, that
made her young preserver feel all that can
melt and agitate a youthful heart, whose
chords for the first time vibrate to the delicious
touch of a claim for pity and protection.
Yet, comparing her voice and manner
with the purport of her words, the young
Crusader could scarce conquer his incredulity.
"And is this the daughter of a heretic and
peasant?" he said; "yet her tones have no
smatch of her birth, nor do her reasons lack

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

aught of what dear and noble spirits might
utter in hap like hers:&mdash;Damsel," he added,
"thou art safe with me; he who perilled
life for thy safety would not lightly endanger
that which thou nobly valuest more than
life, and which he who has saved it prizes
above his own." And this was spoken with
the eloquent blush and earnest grace of truth;
so that Genevieve, sinking with fatigue and
agitated feelings, no longer declined the support
of the arm which he tendered with as
high courtesy as ever he had to titled beauty.
"Thou art trembling, damsel," said Amirald,
with anxious gentleness.&mdash;"I tremble, but
my fears are not for myself," answered the
maiden.&mdash;"Thou art near one of the wretched
retreats of my persecuted people, and should
they find thee here&mdash;&mdash;" "Would they not
be grateful for thy safety at least?" said the
knight.&mdash;"I cannot answer for their gratitude;
but I can well answer for thy danger,"
said the maiden.&mdash;"Leave me, I pray thee:
thy noble life is perilled while thou tarryest;

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

leave me to wander back alone." "Not at
the peril of a thousand lives, were they mine,"
cried Amirald, as he marked the faltering
step and sinking voice of Genevieve; and
lifting her on his steed, he led her gently
on in the direction her parting steps had
indicated.</p>

<p>In the effort, the wounds, till then unfelt,
that he had received in his conflict with the
ruffians, burst forth, and the blood gushed
through his armour.</p>

<p>"I will perish, I will perish on this
spot," cried Genevieve, "or I will wander
back as I may, ere I witness such a sight
again. Oh that I might," she cried, the
habitual reverence for rank overcoming her
other feelings, as one whose community was
at war with the established state of society&mdash;"Oh
that I might with mine own hands
heal those wounds, and wash them with
my tears, and tend them by the hour, while
stooping frame and bended knee, care and
prayer, watched over the work. Oh that I

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

were but worthy to be thy handmaid, noble
knight!"</p>

<p>Touched more deeply by the mellow and
melting tenderness of the peasant maiden's
voice, than by his own sense of actual pain,
the young knight once more attempted to
raise her in his arms. Genevieve resisted,
but in vain, and was at length compelled to
submit to accept his assistance. While Amirald
sustained her slender weight, and while
she endured to be so sustained, each murmured
to themselves&mdash;Amirald perhaps audibly,
"Is there, then, such noble and gentle affection
in an Albigeoise, such lofty thought, combined
with language so gentle?"&mdash;and Genevieve
internally, "and is there such honour in a
Crusader, that he risks life for the safety of
a despised daughter of my people?"</p>

<p>They had not advanced far, when a
certain whistle was heard, accompanied by
watch-words, or rather signals, to which
the ears of Genevieve were well accustomed.
"Depart," cried Genevieve eagerly; "I hear

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

the feet of my people approaching&mdash;they are,
perchance, in quest of me."&mdash;"I will depart,"
said Amirald, bending his proud knee to the
earth, while he kissed the hand of his lovely
burthen, "I will depart, maiden, though I
know not where this night to couch my head;
but rather would I deal with a host of ruffians
like those who seized thee, than touch a hair
of the head of thy people who seek thee and
who love thee. Maiden, under no Crusader's
corslet beats a heart so full of pity towards
a heretic as mine to thee. Oh that thou
wert a daughter of the true Church! what then
would be lacking to thy glorious qualities and
gentle haviour?" He parted:&mdash;"Oh," cried
Genevieve, "that thou wert an Albigeois&mdash;<i>but
for their bonds!</i>"</p>

<p>The restless agony of Pierre, who had felt
his daughter's absence on awaking from his
broken slumber, had caused some of them to
set forth at whatever risk in pursuit of her.
By them she was found, and the joy of meeting
forbade all enquiry with regard to her

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

short absence; or, perhaps, the habits of the
Albigeois, accustomed to strong vicissitudes,
anticipated all enquiries by the consciousness
that another might occur before the cause of
the preceding one could be explained.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE Crusaders hourly now expected the
return of the Monk of Montcalm with the
answer of the Albigeois, and the bishop
proudly anticipated another triumph of that
eloquence which had hitherto been deemed
irresistible;&mdash;already he saw in perspective
the reputation of St. Dominic himself, the
first preacher and inquisitor, shrinking into
insignificance, and the memory of the ill-fated
Ch&acirc;teauneuf compromised in the glory of that
powerful appeal that was to convert the Albigeois
to the Catholic creed, and place a new
gem in his expected tiara.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

<p>It was certainly a rare and perilous policy
on the part of the Church of Rome, to <i>commit</i>
men who, however individually powerful in
intellect, and possessed of all the learning of
that age, relied for the effect of their sermons
rather on <i>prescription</i>, than on the interest of
novelty, the cogency of argument, or, perhaps,
the omnipotence of truth&mdash;with men who
drew their credentials from Scripture, and
urged them with an energy, feeling, and conviction,
"as having authority." The preachers
of the former class (now for the first time
urged to exertion in that important department)
seemed to offer to their thirsty hearers
stinted draughts from a medicated cup; the
latter pointed with the air and voice of inspiration
to the "<i>integros fontes:</i>" they shouted
aloud, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come
ye to the waters."</p>

<p>Such, however, had been the mode adopted
(and perhaps no better presented itself then)
on the first disastrous mission of Pierre de
Ch&acirc;teauneuf, partly from the pride of power,

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

which would not be outdone in the novel
mode of competition adopted by the antagonist,
and partly from the consciousness of
superior intellectual attainment (then conceived
to be the exclusive property of the
ecclesiastics, though in truth it was but
thinly and inadequately diffused among their
vast body).</p>

<p>But the Church of Rome, then in the
plenitude of her power, could not, or would
not, admit the conviction, that the supremacy
of her establishment rooted, even at
that remote period, for ages, and supported,
aided, and embellished by all that was then
powerful in human eloquence, profound in
human learning, exciting in human interests,
and touching in human passions, could fail
before the preaching of a few illiterate peasants,
who drew their theology from a forbidden
book, and their inspiration from Nature
and from heaven; that the glorious
galley&mdash;the "gallant ship," which had weathered
a thousand storms and assaults, was

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

to strike sail to a carvel, when she was now
safe and proud in harbour.</p>

<p>The experiment, however, had failed, and
the missionary Ch&acirc;teauneuf had been the
victim. But the court of Rome had at present
another object:&mdash;the grasping ambition
of the Bishop of Toulouse, whose heart, eye,
and almost hand were already on the tiara,
had not escaped their notice. His intrigues
with the various sovereigns of Europe they
had been apprised of, by the emissaries they
employed at their courts; moreover, his correspondence
with the Emperor of Germany,
and the Kings of Arragon and England, had
been intercepted, and though the cypher in
which they were written baffled all the ingenuity
of the Vatican, with that of its most
expert secretaries, still his peculiar hand was
recognized; and the circumstance of such
a correspondence existing was enough to
awaken suspicions and apprehensions still
more formidable. Finally, his putting himself
at the head of the Crusaders, next to

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

Count Simon de Montfort, seemed, in fact,
to be putting himself in place of the Pope
himself in France, while the <i>well-good</i> understanding,
as it was termed in the language
of that age, between him and the boisterous
and brutal De Montfort, was considered as
a kind of sinister omen, and strengthened the
supposition that he might avail himself of his
influence over his rude coadjutor to win his
own secret way, and work his own powerful
will.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, at this juncture that the
court of Rome availed itself of its usual temporizing
policy, and through the legate, who
stood responsible for all measures, employed as
its commissioned mediator the Monk of Montcalm,
whose well-accredited sanctity of character
and purity of life stood between the
rotten politics of the Vatican, and the vigorous
and vital spirit that animated the community
of the Albigeois&mdash;like the priest of old between
the living and the dead&mdash;to negotiate between
the contending parties. To the infinite disappointment

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

of the Pope and the conclave,
they found they had selected a man the last
on earth to be trusted with such a mission.
They thought they had secured every point;
the known sanctity of his character rendered
him a most respectable agent; the humility of
his station, and his spiritual-mindedness made
him also an unsuspected object to the Bishop
of Toulouse, who knew as well as any cardinal
in the conclave, that the Monk of Montcalm
would not resign his hermitage for the tiara.
Thus they imagined that they had provided
a powerful antagonist (for the sanctity of the
poor monk far outweighed the dignity of the
prelate, even in the estimation of the most
worldly,) under the guise of one apparently
the most feeble and inefficient; and that all
their procrastinating policy (meant chiefly to
diminish the power and mortify the ambition
of the Bishop of Toulouse) might be laid
safely on the shoulders of the legate, who,
supporting his assumed and constrained part,
affected a profound reverence for the sanctified

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

character and inspired counsels of the Monk
of Montcalm.</p>

<p>Thus the whole politics of the ecclesiastical
world, (and politics were at that period almost
exclusively confined to ecclesiastics,) like
an inverted cone, rested on a point, a diminutive
and almost invisible part of the mighty
mass it sustained; but the wisdom of the
Vatican was here completely outreached, even
by the very simplicity of the instrument it
deigned to employ.</p>

<p>The man whom they justly deemed humble,
abstracted, and unearthly, was, nevertheless,
one who went head and heart straight forward
to the truth and the right of whatever
cause he was engaged in. Had they employed
the most profound diplomatist of the
age, who was sworn in secret to confound
or counteract their counsels, they could not
have fared worse than they did from the
instrument employed. An honest upright
man is the worst implement that ever designing
and corrupt hands meddled with, to
work their foul and secret purpose.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

<p>The Monk of Montcalm was a strict
and conscientious Catholic, but he had a
Christian feeling for the sufferings of the
Albigeois; and "innocent of the knowledge"
that he was played off as a <i>pis aller</i> in the
desperate game that was fighting between the
Vatican and the Bishop of Toulouse, he travelled
from Rome to the Castle of Courtenaye,
and from thence to the neighbouring
retreat of the Albigeois, from which, as we
have related, he was now returning; grieved
alike by the pride of one party and the obstinacy
of the other, but rejoiced that he had
at least effected one peaceful meeting between
them: Thus, his integrity of purpose,
benevolence of heart, and true heavenly-mindedness,
(which was all counted by
the Vatican as weakness that would perplex
and protract the negotiation <i>ad libitum Pap&aelig;</i>,)
instead of having the effect they had hoped
from his imputed ignorance and diplomatic
inefficiency, produced exactly the contrary
effect of making the adverse parties understand

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

the terms on which they stood; and
of effecting, by indefatigable activity and
immaculate veracity, the arrangement of a
meeting between the Crusaders and the Albegeois&mdash;a
meeting within a few hours, which
the council at Rome hoped might have
been delayed for as many months.&mdash;And
thus the Monk of Montcalm proved all
unconsciously the triumph of plain strong
sense, profound religious feeling, and fervent
intense philanthropy, over all the complicated
counsels, jarring interests, and fiercely
opposed passions of Rome and of those she
employed, and dreaded and distrusted most
when she found their agency most necessary.</p>

<p>The Monk of Montcalm was expected to
return on the day after the combat, (the
storm of the preceding evening having, probably,
delayed his arrival then), for, though
advanced in years, he was known to perform
his journeys with the punctuality of
a foot-post. All that day a cloud hung
over the Castle of Courtenaye. The storm

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

of the preceding night had passed away, but
dark vapours still rested on the hills, thick
drops of rain beat heavily against the casement,
and blasts came roaring down the
wide chimney, driving forth the blaze of the
wood-fire before it, that shrunk and failed
again as it retired. The fierce excitement of
the age knew no graduated intervals of quiet
and useful occupation, between the extremes
of gloomy sloth or perilous extremity. The
guests were, therefore, ill-prepared for a day
of dull and in-door tranquillity. To add to
its dulness, the lady Isabelle (perhaps to shun
the sight of De Montfort) was engaged in the
devotions she had promised to her patron-saint,
if her champion was successful in the
lists. During the day the knights and nobles
stalked through the vast hall, yawned
heavily, played a game at draughts drowsily,
glanced at the high windows, which, though
they admitted light, excluded all prospect,
and, internally cursing the slow and doubtful
counsels of the Vatican, made vows for the

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

speedy return of the Monk of Montcalm.
Verac and Semonville, who were the only
individuals in the Castle acquainted with the
midnight visit of the others to the vault,
assumed faces of importance vainly hiding
impressible curiosity. They winked, nodded,
and looked mysteriously at each
other; but their curiosity was doomed to be
both insatiable and unsated. They threw
themselves eagerly in the way of those who,
the preceding night, obeyed the summons of
the Lord of Courtenaye, or rather their own
wild will and dark feelings, and whispered
enquiries with all the secrecy of anticipated
confidence, but they could only obtain from
Sir Paladour a brief, obscure, and agitated,
reply. The rest were totally silent. No
mode of questioning or hinting, direct or
indirect, no circuitous approaches of Verac,
or barefaced questions of Semonville, could
extort more. The enquirers stood abashed,
repelled, and defeated.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Toulouse (whom neither

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

dare accost) was playing chess with the Count
de Montfort, and dictating between the
moves to his Latin secretary, who was seated
at a small table beside him, a letter to the
Pope, (the contents of which he had no fear
of his antagonist, or, indeed, any other in the
hall understanding.)</p>

<p>Towards noon or somewhat later, as they
were about to spread for dinner, the bishop
in the same breath cried "Checkmate,"
though De Montfort was reckoned the most
skilful player of the age, dictated a few final
lines in Latin to the secretary, concluded the
letter with a hieroglyphic, written with his
own hand, sealed it with his own proper
signet, ordered the messenger, who received
it on his knees, to ride for life, and
rose to watch for the Monk of Montcalm,
whose speed was delayed, as we have said,
alike by his persisting to travel on foot, and
by the storm of the preceding day. It was
on the close of this weary day, that the
monk, indeed, arrived at the Castle of

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

Courtenaye. He bore tidings that the
heretics were grateful for the legate's message,
and accepted the offer of meeting the
Crusaders and hearing the bishop's exhortation,
provided the party came unarmed.
"Alas!" said the holy man, "Beziers and
Carcassonne are still fresh in their memories."&mdash;"And
so is the martyr Ch&acirc;teauneuf
in ours," said the bishop. The tables were
now spreading for the feast, and the Crusaders,
collecting round them, anticipated joyously
the three great epochs of chivalric life&mdash;a
feast, a procession, and preaching (a novelty
then to Catholics)&mdash;and perchance, highly as
they deemed of the eloquence of the Bishop
of Toulouse&mdash;a battle after all.</p>

<p>During the tumult of the hall, the monk
was about to retire, when the bishop stayed
him, after murmuring to himself, "Had I
had emissaries among these heretics&mdash;had I
sounded their <i>shoals</i>, for they have no <i>depths</i>,
I should ere this&mdash;but no matter&mdash;I will ere
long. There be men among them that may

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

be tempted, there be women that may be
melted. I will have those about me who
will watch the bait most likely to catch, or
the net best twined to entangle;&mdash;no, I
will watch myself: some bright eye, some
commanding feature, some towering stature
among their women&mdash;that will be
rare among peasants&mdash;that will not do;&mdash;then,
some keen visage, eager face, loud
tones, and prompt ambition of an unnoted
spirit; yea, that were better to deal with.
Your peasantry ever abound in those when
their wits are whetted on the touchstone of
Scripture, as they call it; and their usurped
authority giveth them a kind of right of
railing against the power they would be fain
to share. If I should meet but two such&mdash;a
woman fair and ambitious, a man sensual,
avaricious, or gluttonous, a slave to those appetites
they boast of subduing&mdash;then were
the game as surely in my hand as if I were
to encounter my lord De Montfort again at
chess. Bishops, castles, and knights, were

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

vain against me&mdash;I would checkmate with
my pawns; but we must hold question with
this Monk of Montcalm."</p>

<p>The crowd gave way as the bishop advanced;
and it was a striking sight to mark
the meeting between the magnificent prelate
and the humble monk, who seemed like the
embodied representatives of this world and
the future.</p>

<p>The pale ascetic moved timidly and slowly
amid the splendid and tumultuous group of the
Crusaders, (whose demeanour still breathed
of war, though they wore the dress of peace,)
like a humble fishing-bark amid a fleet of
proud and gilded gallies, tacking every moment,
as if dreading to be sunk by their movements,
or crushed between their sides. Yet
such, even in that rude age, was the impression
made by sanctity of manners, integrity
of purpose, and benevolence of heart, that
many a lofty head was bent to sue for his
benediction; and many a proud breast, enfolded
in silk and silver, panted for the peace

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

that was enshrined in a heart covered only
by the sorry weeds of an eremite.</p>

<p>When the Monk of Montcalm came in
presence of the bishop, where he stood in the
splendour of his episcopal vestments, surrounded
by attendants, and indeed with an
air that would have given grandeur to the
humblest state, he bowed low as to superior
station, but with undazzled eye, and meekly
craved his Messing.</p>

<p>"Holy monk, we rather ask yours," said
the bishop, who never failed on due occasion
to give his dignity the grace of condescension.</p>

<p>The eremite stretched forth his withered
hand as the bishop bowed his mitred front;
and then the conference was about to commence.
At the first sentence, "<i>Dic Latine,
qu&aelig;so, frater reverendissime,</i>" said the bishop.
"<i>Nequeo, episcope sanctissime</i>" answered
the monk with some diffidence.
"<i>Absunt mihi et facundia et facilitas</i>." The
bishop gave a signal to his attendants, who
retired to a respectful distance.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

<p>The conference lasted but for a few moments,
for what had the speakers in common?
The monk told all he knew&mdash;the bishop
learned all he wished; and the former, whose
dim sight was aching with the splendour of
lights and gorgeous pageantry, craved permission
to withdraw to his shed in the basecourt
of the Castle, conformably to his vow,
never to sleep but under the roof of monastic
walls or of his own lonely tenement.</p>

<p>The bishop looked after him for a space,
and then triumphantly murmured, (for his
greatest triumphs were always internal)&mdash;"So,
Rome hath enmeshed herself again in
her own web; be it so. And so they
thought that this poor ascetic would so perplex
and obscure their matters with the
heretics, that they might dally and delay at
their list, and play King against Champion
of the Church, and the Champion against
the Bishop of Toulouse, as it suited their
cold and temporizing policy; and now they
are quitted as they deserve. This dolt-headed 

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

monk hath gone straight-forward in
the path of his office; the controversy is adjusted
in a twinkling; and I, whom they
dread (yes, I know they dread me," said the
prelate, muttering still lower, and compressing
his lips to conceal a proud involuntary
smile,) "am, by their bungling politics, the
accredited mediator between two parties, of
whom it were hard to say which hates me
deadliest. By Heaven! had they entrusted
their cause to me, I could have protracted it
for twenty years, save that it were too long
to wait for the tiara. I would have fought
battles with them; and were they lost, I
would have recourse to treaties; and if
<i>they</i> were broken, I would have fought battles
again. No matter: they have wrought
their own decay. To-morrow I must speak
with these heretics, and let their mountain-echoes
look to it; for though I envy not the
martyrdom of that Ch&acirc;teauneuf, I will not
leave a rock that shall not thunder back
eloquence louder and more potent than ever

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

he uttered, and force these heretics that love
the mountains to call on them to cover them,
but to escape from its sound."</p>

<p>"My lord museth," said one of the attendants,
who, like the rest, was standing at
a distance.</p>

<p>The sound instantly struck the bishop's
ear, whose senses were remarkably acute;
and as the Lord of Courtenaye approached
with courteous speech to invite him to the
banquet, which was now spread, he answered
with the collected air of one on whom important
business presses:&mdash;"My lord, you
know that to-morrow it is the Holy Father's
will we encounter these heretics, not with
weapons, but with words. I have need of
many orisons to-night, to pray the Saints
to enable me to sustain the burthen the will
of our Holy Father hath imposed on these
poor shoulders. I crave an interest in your
prayers, my good lord, though a layman's&mdash;and
bid you a fair good rest this night."</p>

<p>"A fair good rest, my holy lord," answered

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

De Courtenaye, mechanically repeating
the words, and bowing low to the bishop
as he quitted the hall; then turning towards
the tables, he muttered; "Proud, dark, and
daring hypocrite, <i>thou</i> talk of orisons! such
rest be to thee as thou wishest me in thy
secret heart! Thy dreams will be of that
vision displayed to thee in the vault last
night; thy pride conceals it, but thy heart
believes; and mine must be&mdash;no matter
what! The feast is spread&mdash;the fools are
smiling&mdash;and I&mdash;Oh God&mdash;must smile too!"</p>

<p>"So please you, my lord&mdash;" said the seneschal,
approaching.</p>

<p>"I know what thou wouldst say. I am
coming. May not a man smile in his own
hall, but thou must watch his mirth? I
will break thy wand over thy pate if thou
marrest my mirth thus again!&mdash;Sit, noble
guests! and now, lord abbot, pledge me
in this cup of muscadine, and tell me how
thou thinkest these heretics will meet the
reasons of my lord of Toulouse to-morrow."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

<p>The abbot answered the pledge duly.
But his thoughts on the event of the following
day we are unable to record, save that
report says they were somewhat inarticulate,
and altogether unintelligible.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE next morning, at the close of the
month of September 1216, at an early hour,
the cavalcade set out from the Castle of
Courtenaye. The lord of the castle had
taken care that his own appointment should
be sufficiently gorgeous; and to increase its
splendour, he required that the lady Isabelle,
with her female attendants, should
accompany him,&mdash;a request with which she
complied the more readily, as knowing that
every female of rank in the vicinity proposed
to join in the procession. The Bishop of
Toulouse, his embroidered vestments resplendent

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

with gold and gems arranged so as to
represent the cross-keys, the insignia of his
rank; his noble steed almost hid beneath
his gorgeous caparisons, but evincing by
his impatient prancings and curvettings a
spirit that the rider gracefully and majestically
restrained&mdash;his cross-bearer and
other attendants, habited as splendidly and
imposingly as their profession and station
allowed, surrounding or following; the magnificent
standard of the Crusaders, blazing
aloof in the morning-sun like the banner of
a king, waving before him:&mdash;the bishop, I
say, rode in the van, "in shape and gesture
proudly eminent," and seeming indeed fit to
lead the van of an army of kings.</p>

<p>The Abbot of Normoutier, with scarce less
pomp, but far less dignity, followed in the rear.
Next in this magnificent march came the
horse-litters of the Lord of Courtenaye, the
lady Isabelle with her attendants, and a
train of noble females, whom devotion, curiosity,
or the wish to display their sumptuous
habits and furniture, had collected on that

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

day. Around them rode nobles and knights,
their armour exchanged for weeds of peace,
and their squires and attendants bearing
their pensiles and bannerols as the indication
of rank, not the announcement of hostility.</p>

<p>The litter in which the lady Isabelle rode
was as gorgeous as that which Margaret of
Valois described with such ostentatious accuracy
more than three centuries afterwards.
The cushions were of velvet embroidered;
flourishings in gold, and curious paintings
of the sufferings of Saints, diversified its
carved and gilded panels; and the Lord
of Courtenaye, looking back from his seat,
saw with delighted vanity the arms of the
house of Courtenaye blazoned on every
small flag that rose from the corners of
the litter, like the pinnacles of a church-battlement,
or the minarets of an Oriental
mosque; for the morning, though in autumn,
was so calm, that every decorative pendant
stood as still, and gleamed as fair, as if a
breeze were never to stir its folds again.
Around this and other splendid litters, the

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

Crusaders and attendant peers and knights of
France made, as they rode, their proud steeds
caracole, sometimes throwing them almost on
their haunches, to shew how skilfully and
difficultly the rider kept his seat; and oftener,
as they rode close by the litters kissing their
ungloved hands, causing them to make certain
capricio's, which drew first a faint shriek
and then a smile from the fair spectators; nor
did such action fail to display to full advantage
the mantles of cloth of gold, the chains
set with gems, the barrets sparkling with
jewels and bending under the weight of plumage,
now disclosed and now concealed by
the banners waved over them by the squires
and men-at-arms.</p>

<p>Amid the cavalcade rode Sir Paladour,
without squire, bannerman, or attendant,
distinguished only by a form that ranked
him among the first and fairest of the sons
of men, the report of former valour well-accredited
by the recent glory of that combat
in which he had encountered the giant-champion

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

of the Church, and rescued the
noblest heiress in France from thraldom of
person, will, and wealth. Formed in that perfect
mould which antiquity chose for that of
her gods, yet with that exquisite symmetry,
alike obvious in the robe of silk or the elastic
coat of mail, Sir Paladour rode near the litter
of the lady Isabelle; and not all the flutter
of emblazoned banners, the gorgeous array
of attendants, ecclesiastical, civil, or martial,
the long parade of caparisoned steeds and
sumptuous litters, nor the glow and glitter
of their proud riders, could prevent the
lady from often waving her white hand
from her litter to Sir Paladour,&mdash;nor him,
though many heads bowed at the signal,
from understanding to whom that mark of distinction
was addressed. But his proud steed
felt the impulse that the rider scarce dared
own; for at once he felt the spur and the
rein, and his fiercest bounds at the unwonted
<i>man&egrave;ge</i> were scarce so high and wild as the
throbbings of Paladour's heart.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

<p>The place of meeting fixed on was a vast
plain surrounded by hills, in the neighbourhood
of the Castle, and in the territories of
Courtenaye. The eminences that enclosed
this plain were covered with spectators, many
hours previous to the arrival of the slow-travelling
cavalcade of the Crusaders: hundreds,
and even thousands, had risen at midnight
to be in time for the spectacle, and
before dawn their dimly-defined forms were
seen moving in shadowy masses, like mist on
the hill-tops which commanded the plain.
They were arranged, in spite of their immense
and increasing multitudes, in amply-accommodated
rows, and were "at large
though without number," till, as the sun
arose, it seemed as if one vast sheet of human
vegetation covered the hills with a kind of
spontaneous efflorescence. There they sat,
still and patient, forming to themselves magnificent
ideas of the spectacle they were to
witness; and a few hours after dawn their
most ambitious anticipations were realized,

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

as the van of the long procession of the
Crusaders appeared, gleaming in gold on the
summit of a richly-wooded hill, like the sun
rising in his glory.</p>

<p>The plain on which the parties were to
meet seemed, indeed, like an apt and ample
theatre for the splendid and eventful drama
that was to be acted on it: it was almost
square, and bounded on two of its sides by
rocks of dark granite, hewed by the hand of
Nature into a resemblance of terraces, and
crowded to their very pinnacles by thousands
who "sent their souls into their eyes."</p>

<p>The remaining sides were as opposite in
their character and scenery as in their position.
The march of the Crusaders wound
by an easy path down hills, feathered from
their base to their summit with the larch,
the pine, and the picturesque ash-tree, with
its hoary trunk and leaves of the lightest
green; and on the rich sward that clothed
its declivities, flowers were glowing and
scents were breathing, and all that is grand

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

and lovely in Nature was effusing its bounty
and its beauty. As the pageant first rose on
the summit of the hill, the voices of thousands
of spectators pealing in thunder from
the rocks on which their dark and crowded
masses rested, (like the clouds from whence
the thunder issues) sent forth a shout of mingled
triumph on their appearance and approbation
of their cause; and its echoes continued
to roll round the hills long after the lips of
the acclaimers were closed, as if the spirits
of the mountains had caught up the sound,
and swelled and prolonged it with the powers
of more than mortal intonation.</p>

<p>And now between the trees, with their
dark trunks and leaves of vivid green slightly
discoloured by the tints of autumn, the proud
array of the Crusaders came glancing nearer;
and every moment were more distinctly seen
the gleams of glittering mantles, of steeds caparisoned
in embroidery, of floating plumage
and gemmed banners, and they gorgeously emblazoned
with all the rich and fantastic profusion

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

of heraldic devices; the group now
emerging from the greenwood shade, now
concealed by a thick duster of ancient trees,
now gleaming gaily out on a spot of greensward,
and now at length pouring the full
glory of their march in all the splendour of
broad sun-light on the open plain, whose surrounding
scenery with all its magnificence of
Nature, seemed but an appendage to the
dignity who were born to be her lords.</p>

<p>As the great standard floated into the
valley, the multitudes, that covered the hills,
made the holy sign with the solemn ardour
of rapturous devotion. The Bishop of Toulouse
caught the signal, and made a sign to
the ecclesiastical attendants to raise in chorus
the psalm "Quare fremuerirat gentes?"
The melody, or chaunt, adapted to these
words was so simple and monotonous, that
it was easily caught and repeated by those
to whose ears it was wafted, and thousands
on thousands of voices, above, below, and
around, in ascending circles thundered "Quare

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

fremuerent gentes?" till the very mountains
seemed vocal from base to summit; and
Nature and the elements appeared inspired
and voiceful in the spontaneous eloquence of
musical devotion.</p>

<p>Right opposite to the richly-clothed and
verdurous hill from which the Crusaders had
descended, rose a naked rock, bare, save
that here and there it was dotted with a few
firs; the sterility of the soil denying any other
produce even under the sunny skies of Languedoc.
There was no path down its rude
sides; the passenger had to make his perilous
way from crag to crag, slowly and ungracefully.
Nothing in inanimate nature was ever
more dreary, comfortless, and unlovely; and
nothing in animated nature seemed better
suited to the cheerless scene, than the group
of the Albigeois, who, clad in the grey
woollen garments worn by the peasantry
(and some of them in sheep-skins), slowly and
painfully wound their way down the dangerous
declivities of the hill. The group

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

consisted of the delegates of the Albigeois,
and was chiefly composed of their preachers,
Mattathias and the chief of their military
leaders having been disabled in their late
conflict. Pierre the pastor was in their van;
and from long habit and fond associations
believing himself unable to walk without the
aid of his grand-daughter, he was supported
by Genevieve. This sole appearance of an
humble female, consecrated by duty and sustained
by motive alone, heightened instead of
destroying the delicacy among so many persons
of the other sex, though of her own
community, and silently enhanced the respect
it claimed.</p>

<p>As the party advanced into the plain, singing
the psalm "In exitu Israel," there was
no applause, no echoed thunders of the mountains:
violence was indeed forbidden, but
disdain and hatred were strongly expressed
in the profound silence that attended their
progress; and the feeble and ill-modulated
strain, supported by tuneless tenors and hoarse
bases, contrasted with the choral magnificence

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

of the Crusaders' hymn; to which the very
air bore burthen, struck the ear as powerfully
as their appearance did the eye; their squalid
garments, coarse visages, and uncouth procession,
stood in helpless opposition to all that
Nature could boast of loveliness, or earth could
display of magnificence.</p>

<p>The combat seemed fought and lost already
in the eyes of the spectators: it was
singular, too, though accidental, that the
sun had been pouring the full brightness of
his morning-rays (in a glorious September
morn) on the path by which the Crusaders
had descended, while the bleak and sterile
rock down which the Albigeois wound their
painful way threw its shadow far and deep
westward, darkening their progress as they
went, so that their feet seemed literally
to "stumble on the dark mountains," and
Nature herself to give evil omen, and take
up "a taunting proverb against them."</p>

<p>Undismayed (or at least appearing so), the
humble party descended into the valley; but

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

not the coarse hood and thick folds of the
woollen mantle which Genevieve drew closely
round her, could conceal a form that united
the spiritualized graces of a Madonna with
the physical perfection of a classic statue.</p>

<p>Her eyes were cast down, but there was a
light from beneath their veined lids; her step
was slow and her head dejected; but there
was a natural majesty, an air of more than
mortal purity and calmness diffused about
her, as if, in the language of the poet, Nature
had said of her, "she shall be a lady of
my own."</p>

<p>The Albigeois had descended to the plain,
but stood at a respectful distance from the
band of the Crusaders, feudal feelings still
operating strongly on their associations: they
felt it like a crime to approach the presence
of "the earth's high lords" till summoned.
During the interval the Bishop of Toulouse
prepared to celebrate mass under the superb
shade of a silken pavilion. There was no
lack of implements for that imposing ceremony;

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

vases, tapers, flowers, incense, bowing
acolytes, and all the ritual pomp which
attends its celebration under the "high embowed"
roof of a cathedral. The Albigeois,
while what they termed the abomination of
the mass was going on, stiffly averted their
heads, and prayed earnestly, but internally,
so as not to disturb the ceremony, to be delivered
from the snare thereof, adding, "Surely
in vain is the snare spread in the sight of
any bird."</p>

<p>The ceremony over, the Bishop of Toulouse
prepared to address the heretics. The
bishop was deemed the ablest controversialist
of the age; and so perhaps he might be&mdash;for
it is a curious and undoubted fact, that infidels
always make the best controversialists.</p>

<p>The zeal of a believer may carry him too
far, or his humility may withhold him too
much; but the infidel has neither zeal to
mislead, nor humility to check him: no language
can shock, no objections alarm him.
The appalling terms in which doubts and objections

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

are clothed, compel the believer to
stop his ears, instead of answering them&mdash;he
shuts out the cries of violated religion,
instead of flying to her rescue. The curiosity
that first tempted the infidel to enquire and to
doubt, conducts him fearlessly on; while the
believer pauses from reverence, and dares not
follow his antagonist to the perilous spot to
which he challenges him.</p>

<p>In a word, the believer walks the dark and
intricate maze of controversy like a rich,
and, therefore, a jealous and timid passenger:
the infidel ranges about like a needy assassin;
he may gain something, pride at least, by
success, and he has certainly nothing to lose.
The bishop had this advantage (if it can
be reckoned one), and moreover the bishop
possessed eloquence to delude, learning to
confound, genius to dazzle, and dignity to
awe, the proudest assembly of his day.
In his discourse, or rather his address, to
the Albigeois, he had tact enough to discover
that with these children of the mountain

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

and the mist, beings whose lives were
passed amid the fiercest conflicts of the
elements of Nature, and the struggles of
human passion, with which the former have,
perhaps, an undefined, and as yet unanalysed
alliance; beings, who lived for many months
of their comfortless year on ice-clad summits,
or in snow-heaped valleys, plunging amid
precipices of frozen snow to save their sheep,
and returning on their chilly path to hear
the word of exhortation or of prayer from a
half-clad pastor in a hovel, that tottered with
the storm, or more frequently without even
that frail shelter, amid the acclivities of rocks,
the roar of many waters, and the thunders
of heaven:&mdash;that with such, it was expedient
to adopt other than the usual tone of controversy
in that fierce and stormy age; he made,
therefore, ample allowance in his address for
these physical contingencies. He knew and
felt that men so brought up, were likely to be
rigid in their notions, and tenacious of their
creeds, that the sternness of their physical

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

existence extended itself to their moral; that
such persons are almost invincible by argument&mdash;for
the spleen they feel against Nature
evaporates in revilements against those who
have obtained the means to soften her dispensations.
The rigour of their faith is
truly a reflection of the rigour of their destiny;
and liberty (whether, political or religious,
the most rigid of all things) has
always been the offspring of mountains and
storms, and life uncivilized and unhappy&mdash;of
beings exasperated by want, fierce from
constraint, declaiming against luxury till they
enjoyed it, struggling against power till they
obtained it, and impatient of authority or
domination, till they could exercise it on
those who had inflicted it on them.</p>

<p>"Such hath been the origin of all revolutions,"
thought the Bishop of Toulouse: "the
aggrieved poor retort on the tyrannical rich;
they become aggressors in their turn, and
repay with heavy interest their debt of
wrong and injury; but this&mdash;this matter
hinging on words merely, may be checked

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

by words, in which I am not to seek;
and then I may direct this torrent that
threatens to overwhelm us into a safe and
quiet channel, yea, turn it into a golden
stream whose waves shall pay tribute to
the treasury of the Vatican."</p>

<p>Thus thought the bishop during mass, and
the same feeling (if he ever felt) appeared
to predominate in his address to the Albigeois.
He touched on all points of controversy,
as matters in which all would agree;
were their principles duly examined, and
hinted that ample accommodation would be
granted by the Church to scrupulous and
delicate consciences. Lightly and gracefully
he trod over the <i>ignes supposito cineri doloso</i>
of the controversy. Transubstantiation, the
mass, confession, image-worship, were all
passed over with superficial and temporizing
mention; for the bishop knew that on these
points his antagonists were armed in complete
mail; but he hoped, and not unreasonably,
to send an arrow through the joints
of their armour, that would penetrate the

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

champions' hearts if it did not touch on their
convictions.</p>

<p>The Albigeois, with whom, as with all
France, the character of the bishop stood
high for learning and eloquence, were obviously
struck by the mildness of his address,
and the dexterous lenity with which he
passed over, or treated as unimportant, certain
points which they expected would have
been insisted on as indispensable. There
was a kind of vacillation, a reluctant disposition
to listen, beginning to betray itself
among them. Pierre, from his blindness,
was unable to discover this, but Boanerges
and the deacon were beginning to exchange
looks of doubt and alarm: the bishop saw
his advantage and pressed his point, addressing
himself powerfully and exclusively to their
feelings.</p>

<p>"Come back," he exclaimed, at the close
of his appeal; "come back, ye wanderers,
to the bosom of your long suffering mother:
ye have wounded, ye have wronged her,
but she is your mother still. The bosom

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

yet bleeding with the blows you have dealt
is expanded this moment to receive and to
embrace you; the arms you have tried to
lop off are extended to invite you to peace
and to felicity.</p>

<p>"The visible presence of the Deity amid
these his most stupendous works calls on
you for solemn deliberation and salutary
choice. He hath shaken mountains mightier
than those which lower and darken around
you; and will you in your pride be more
inflexible than they? He hath made the
streams to gush from rocks more hard and
sterile than those from which you descended;
and will your hearts be less penetrable than
they? All Nature, animated and inanimate,
is pleading with you; see this plain overspread
with the mighty of the earth, the
nobles of the land: with sheathed sword and
hands held out in peace they supplicate you
to have mercy on your own souls. Behold
those hills covered to their summits with
thousands of the faithful: they implore you
by their presence to turn from the error of

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

your way and live. Behold," he cried,
"beings above the heights of the utmost
hills. Yon vast congregation is but a shadow
of that which watches you from above.
There be patriarchs and prophets, apostles and
martyrs, saints and spirits in paradise; and
the seraphim in ascending circles of glory,
order above order, up to the hierarchy of the
bright archangels who stand nearest to the
throne of God and tremble at their own
exaltation: all that glorious company are
pleading for you, <i>to</i> you, this moment. Myriads
on myriads, from glorified mortals to
the first order of created beings; angels who
kept their first estate: such are your witnesses,
your advocates. They bend from
their intercession&mdash;they look down on you:
they say, for you we burned and bled&mdash;for
you were we stretched on the rack and
chained to the stake; by the vast weight of
our merits we have inclined the eternal scales
in your behalf, till the accusing angel himself
resigned his office."</p>

<p>Here a murmur began to arise among a

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

band of the Albigeois, to whose ears the
sound of <i>merit</i> was an abomination.</p>

<p>"And even above that glorious circle,"
resumed the Bishop, "high beyond the highest,
and bright above the brightest, the
Mother of God herself appears, as in the
vision of the mystic book, clothed with the
sun, and the moon beneath her feet, and
in her arms the form of him who created
both." And as he spoke the bishop fervently
kissed the gorgeous crucifix that was appended
from his shoulders.</p>

<p>The murmur among the Albigeois increased.</p>

<p>The bishop watched and waited till the
murmur subsided: he allowed the wave to
dash in full force, and sailed in triumph on
its recoiling surge. "Spurn not the cross,"
he cried, "for the sake of him who hung
thereon! If ye boast your love to him, if
ye treasure in your hearts every word he
uttered, every precept he enjoined, every
ordinance he appointed, scorn not those who
hallow with their lips and their hearts the

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

memorial of him whom both are bound to
love. You cherish his faith in your hearts;
we press its symbol to our lips. Is it possible
we can shew inwardly or outwardly
too much devotion to Him to whom both
look alike for salvation? Shall men differ
for modes, when the spirit and the system is
the same?&mdash;and even in those modes, have
not saints agreed with us? Can we not
reckon against your feeble, and unauthorized,
and recent examples, our saints, our anchorets,
our eremites, our holy men whose memory
hath been embalmed from age to age,
and in the period of twelve hundred years have
kept the odour of that memory undiminished?
We point your steps to that bright
track: behold who have preceded you; see
how their path is gemmed and studded, not
with crowns and coronals of this earth, not
with tiaras and mitres. Have you wept?&mdash;so
have they. Have you suffered?&mdash;so have
they. Have you bled?&mdash;their blood was first
shed for you. There are the palms of martyrs,&mdash;branches

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

of living emerald; the tears
of saints turned to diamonds that paved
their way to Heaven as they shed them;
the blood of martyrs, whose every drop is
now a ruby in their celestial coronals. There
be the treasures unexhausted, inexhaustible,
of their accumulated merits, which the
Church throws open to you, overlaying
the way of your return with the gems and
gold of the sanctuary of Heaven." He
paused: the Albigeois stood attentive and
reverent&mdash;but there was neither movement
nor answer amid their assembly, and this
silence was evidently neither that of conviction
nor even of hesitation. "God!" exclaimed
the bishop, (for an infidel can sometimes
work himself into the semblance of an
enthusiast by the assistance of his passions,)
"if there be fifty righteous in that heretical
Sodom&mdash;thirty, ten, nay one, let them come
forth."</p>

<p>Not a foot was advanced&mdash;not a voice was
heard among the vast multitude.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

<p>Pierre, the pastor, alone tottered forth,
supported by Genevieve, and stood almost
opposite to the bishop.</p>

<p>"Silence hath answered thee," said the
sightless pastor. He turned solemnly towards
the congregation. They stood mute
and motionless as the dead.</p>

<p>The blind old man appeared to hear this
silence: he drew a furrow with his staff in
the sands of the plain, between his congregation
and the band of the Crusaders. "Pass
it who will!" he exclaimed: he listened with
hearing rendered more acute by the privation
of the organs of sight: no sound of
voice or step was heard. He shook his white
and streaming hair in triumph. "Silence
hath answered thee," he repeated. "There
is not one amongst us, from the stoutest that
can wield a club, to the timid maiden on
whom I lean, who will sell their birthright
unto thee! We are poor, and afflicted, and
despised; but every man in our host is a
Joshua, and every woman a Miriam!" In
his emotion, he dropped his staff, which

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

Genevieve stooped to recover. In the action,
her mantle and hood, partially displaced, disclosed
a glimpse of her form and countenance:
her long dark hair almost touched the ground,
and there was a light of holy triumph in her
eye and on her features, that gave them for
a moment a character almost unearthly. It
was but for a moment! She hastily replaced
her mantle, folded herself in it, and stood like
a veiled statue by the pastor.</p>

<p>Short as was the interval, the bishop had
seen her, and that was enough in his thoughts
to decide her destiny. He stood for a space
silent, his eyes still fixed on her shrouded
figure; but instantly recovering himself, he
pursued his address to the Albigeois; but his
tone was now changed from the conciliatory
and expostulative to the minatory and commanding.
"Unhappy men!" he thundered,
"ye have sealed your doom&mdash;sealed it in
both worlds: the book of life was unfolded
to you that ye might write your names on
its page, and Paradise would have smiled as
you traced them. Ye have shut that book;

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

and now another volume is opened, and on
its burning leaves I see your doom inscribed,
Death! death temporal and eternal!"&mdash;and
thousands of voices from vale, and rock,
and mountain, chorussed the denunciation,
"Death! death! temporal and eternal death
to the heretics!"</p>

<p>The pastor attempted to speak, but his
voice was drowned by the powerful tones
of Boanerges, struggling forth amid the
shouts of the multitude. "We are not careful,"
he cried, addressing the Bishop of Toulouse,
"to answer thee farther in this matter.
Thou mayest doom our bodies to torture, and
our lives to the sword; but every soul, as it
parts from its ruined tabernacle, shall swell
the cry that issues against ye from beneath
the footstool of the judge, 'How long, Lord!
how long!' "</p>

<p>Language so unusual produced for some
time an amazed silence on the part of the
Crusaders; and the deacon, with virulent pertinacity,
took up the word, which he could
not help seasoning with occasional references

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

to his favourite propensity. "And who art
thou," he cried to the astonished Prelate,
"that scatterest the fold of the Lord, and
pushest them with shoulder and side from
the fat pastures wherein they should dwell
safely? Thou hast thyself eat of the fat
and drunk of the sweet, I warrant me; yea,
thy food hath been of the kidneys of wheat
and the fat of fat rams, and thy drink of the
vine of Sibmah and the vintage of Elealeh;&mdash;and
comest thou here to scare the chosen
people who wander in the wilderness, and
are fain to feed on manna, while thou wast
feasting amid the flesh-pots of Egypt?"</p>

<p>The bishop fixed his stern and steady
gaze on the speaker without answering; but
his cross-bearer, who noted his lord's expression,
said to himself, "That heretic's doom
is sealed." But all other sounds were now
lost amid the indignant clamour of the Crusaders,
who, scorning to be thus batted by
their vassalry, rode fiercely round the pavilion,
under whose silken awning the Bishop
of Toulouse still stood.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

<p>Loudest was heard the voice of Simon de
Montfort, who, spurring before them all, exclaimed,
"Come we here to be rent by these
swine, my lords? Call you this a conference,
where your overmuch patience is answered
by the blunt and bitter rudeness of
villain peasants? A conference, I trow!!!
with thee (to Pierre), blind of soul as blind
of sight, or with that skin-clad ambassador"
(pointing to Boanerges, who was arrayed in
skins with the wool unshorn), "who seems
to have come deputed by a sort of goats, that
have lent him their best robes to grace their
grave commission withal."</p>

<p>"Misproud lord!" retorted the preacher,
"it would better become thee to cast thine
eyes on the vain attire of thine arch-priest,
who arrays himself in scarlet and gold, and
precious stone, the livery of that Babylonian
harlot whose seat is on the seven hills that
totter while I speak&mdash;better to cast thy beclouded
eyes on <i>him</i>, and ask thyself whether
he or I most resemble those who 'wandered

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

about in sheep-skins and in goat-skins&mdash;of
whom the world was not worthy.' "</p>

<p>"The foul fiend ha' me!" exclaimed De
Montfort, foaming with fury;&mdash;"an' if there
were lance in my hand, I would not nail
thee to the earth as thou standest, vile
peasant! My lord of Toulouse, let us but
charge among these dogs with our riding-rods,
and they will flee as the slaves in old
story, that my chaplain tells of, fled from
their masters at the sound of the lash."</p>

<p>"Foul shame and scorn it were," said
Paladour, interposing, "to assail unarmed
and helpless men in the hour of truce."</p>

<p>"And darest thou oppose thy green wit
and unfledged valour against me in this
matter?" said the fierce lord, reining up
his steed by Sir Paladour, and bending his
stern aspect on him.</p>

<p>"For green wit we youth must be content
to bear a gibe from our seniors," said Sir
Aymer; "but men deemed his valour well-fledged
in the plumage of De Montfort's crest

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

what time it swept the dust in the tourney
lists of the Castle of Courtenaye."</p>

<p>"Oh, peace!&mdash;for shame, if not for Heaven's
sake, peace!" cried the Monk of Montcalm:&mdash;"rein
in the fierceness of your vainly
incensed spirits, lest the enemy you despise
laugh you to scorn."</p>

<p>"Here break we off," said the Bishop of
Toulouse, rising with dignity. "The long-suffering
patience of the Church hath been
trampled on, her tender mercies rejected and
despised; and for you (for I am not unskilled
in those Jewish phrases in which ye delight)&mdash;for
you, who have whetted the sword
that is to smite you in pieces&mdash;who have
hewn out with your own hands from the
mountain the stone that is to fall and
crush you&mdash;for you, after this last hour
of insulted mercy, every implement of mortal
might shall be let loose against you;
and should they fail&mdash;but they will not
fail&mdash;the thunders of the Church's curse,
outroaring the thunders of the hills where
ye seek for shelter, shall pursue you, to blast,

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

wither, and exterminate you, till your name
perish from off the face of the earth. Blessed
shall he be whose weapon is but tinged
with your blood, and thrice blessed shall he
be whose hands reek with it. As it is written,
'Thy foot shall be dipped in the blood
of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy
dogs may be red through the same.' " As he
spoke, the Crusaders prepared to depart; and
the sound of their movement as those who
rode reined up their steeds, and those who
had dismounted sprung on theirs, signing to
their attendants, who on foot or on horse
hastened forward to stand by the reins of
their respective lords, was, in the language
and in the ears of the Albigeois, like the
sound of many waters.</p>

<p>"Hear, mighty lords," cried Pierre, "hear
yet a word. Suffer us but to depart, at
least the women and the little ones: suffer
them at least to depart in safety into the
mountains of the Cevennes, or the region of
Arragon. Spare the lives of wretched peasants;
send us forth into the wilderness

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

lacking all things but God and his word&mdash;and
if we perish, we perish: wherefore
should you set yourselves in array, and make
your battle strong against men, amid thousands
of whom there is not one who skills to
draw the sword, or fight with spear and shield?"</p>

<p>At this appeal the Monk of Montcalm
held up his locked hands with an air of
supplication to the Bishop of Toulouse.
The prelate waved him off indignantly with
one arm, while he extended the other towards
the Albigeois.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "shall ye be suffered
to go forth like the locusts in that mystic
vision of him who saw the apocalypse in
Patmos, to shed your poison over the face
of all the earth? Behold," he added, pausing,
and holding forth his robe; "behold I turn
once more like the ambassadors of old, to
proffer peace or war, safety or destruction.&mdash;Choose,
while yet a moment for choice.&mdash;Choose."</p>

<p>The Albigeois, as one man, averted their
heads, and with one voice called on Heaven;

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

and the pastor with a faint exclamation between
triumph and thanksgiving, fell quite
exhausted into the arms of Genevieve. The
Bishop of Toulouse cast a terrible look on
the devoted band; "The volume is closed&mdash;the
door is shut&mdash;the day is past," he cried;
"your blood be on your own heads:&mdash;to-morrow
ye die."</p>

<p>THE carousal at the Castle that night was
deep and late. The Crusaders felt like men
who had but to lift an arm on the morrow,
whose sole and single blow was sufficient to
sweep the Albigeois from the face of the
earth. The cups were pledged and drained
to the destruction of heretics. The Monk
of Montcalm alone was absent; he had retired
with a grieved heart to his shed in the
courts of the Castle, and passed the night in
prayer. De Montfort, whose spirit, ferocious
as it was martial, kindled alike at the

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

thoughts of a slaughter or a battle, was in
tumultuous spirits, and rudely proposed that
the lady Isabelle should accompany them to
what he called the heretic-hunt on the
morrow. "You shall hold me excused,
lord of Montfort," said the lady shrinking
at the motion.&mdash;"Nay, lady," said Sir
Aymer, "be not so fond to say us nay&mdash;what,
art thou not an Atalanta, a huntress,
one of Dian's nymphs? I warrant me, thou
lovest to ride through the green wood with
a merlin on thy wrist, or to wander on the
banks of the merry Garonne, to fly thy spar-hawk
at a pigeon, or mark thy falcon stoop
at a partridge."&mdash;"Tush," cried De Montfort,
"thou talkest of sport for my lady's
waiting-damsels. I warrant, she better loves
to spur her palfrey through glade and brake,
when the huntsman winds a mort, and the
stag holds out his throat to her fair hand,
and the raven perching near flutters and
croaks till the quarry is broke."</p>

<p>"Never, trust me," said the lady, the
tears almost coming to her beautiful eyes,

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

which Paladour had never thought more
beautiful, "if it pitied not my very heart to
see his plight, and I chid myself for the
delight I had taken in that cruel sport."&mdash;"Well
then, to please thee, they shall not be
stags, but a sort of foxes, that we shall deem
we hunt to-morrow," said De Montfort&mdash;"foul,
filthy vermin. We will place thee on a
hill, whence thou shall see us untappice the
sly malign beasts, smoke them out of their
earth-holes, and chase them over the country
with their young, till not one of the foul
vermin be left to poison the land."</p>

<p>"Not one&mdash;not one be left alive," was the
universal shout of the Crusaders. "<i>Adolescentulos
cum puellis, senes cum infantibus</i>,
as the Psalmist hath it," chaunted the Abbot
of Normoutier.&mdash;"Alas," said the lady, shuddering,
"in times of peril, such sights must be;
but must women's eyes be forced to look on
them?"&mdash;"Marry must they," persevered De
Montfort. "As you would wish for short
shrift and light penance next confession-day.

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

My lord of Toulouse, you will yield this fair
back-slider such weighty reasons."&mdash;"Fair
niece," interposed the Lord of Courtenaye,
"you will do us pleasure in hearkening to the
bishop's reasons."&mdash;"I trust, noble lady," the
bishop was commencing, when one of the
menials hastily entering the hall put into his
hands a torn and bloody scroll.</p>

<p>"How now, knave!" said the Lord of
Courtenaye, "be these thy manners to thrust
a villainous and filthy scroll into the hands
of my lord of Toulouse?" The bishop
did not mark him: his countenance changed
as his eyes fell on the disfigured paper.</p>

<p>"What hath changed your favour, lord
bishop?" said De Montfort.</p>

<p>"Read," answered the bishop, putting
the paper into his hands. It contained only
the word "Beware!" written in blood, and
but freshly traced.</p>

<p>While De Montfort with some difficulty
decyphered the word, the domestic answered
the enquiries of the bishop. He said that he

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

had followed in the train of the Crusaders
that day; and that returning late he had
fallen over something that lay in his path: a
groan convinced him it was a living being,
but one who had not long to live. The unfortunate
man was unable to tell the name
of his murderer; but he collected his dying
strength to adjure him by gestures to convey
the scroll, marked with his own blood, to the
Bishop of Toulouse; and, while he was speaking,
expired. The relator had no more to
disclose, and the bishop mused in silence.</p>

<p>"A toy, a device, on my life, a very foolish
and insufficient toy!" cried De Montfort, striking
down the scroll with the hilt of his dagger:
"I will wage," he continued, raising his
voice&mdash;"I will wage the broad lands of De
Montfort against the peak of l'Aigle sur la
Roche&mdash;a noble's having 'gainst an outlaw's
hold, that, leaving the body of our battle
to fence these towers, without man-at-arms,
squire, or page, I and the knights-crusaders
alone will encounter the heretics, and not

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

leave one to tell the tidings within the bounds
of fair Languedoc or ere the sun be high to-morrow!"</p>

<p>This wild proposal was received with as
wild acclamation by the knights, who began
to be inflamed with the wine they had drunk,
and by the hope of distinguishing themselves
in the eyes of lady Isabelle.</p>

<p>The bishop, who only might control the
frantic purpose of De Montfort, was still musing,
heedless of what passed; and Sir Aymer
alone had the sense to see the danger and
folly of the motion, and the courage to oppose
it. "Why, how now, mad lords!" he
said, "where is your wisdom?&mdash;where is
your discretion?&mdash;nay, where is your valour?
Sith true valour setteth not more by the
peril it risks, than by the glory that gives, to
peril its sweetness and its price. Be ye such
peevish and unskilled chess-players, that ye
will hazard Knight, Bishop, and Castle,
against a file of beggarly pawns? Are ye
avised what men they be against whom ye
thrust yourselves in such raw and unprepared

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

fashion? By the mass! they fight
from behind a bare crag, as it were a warded
tower;&mdash;then they have a whoreson, villainous
trick of rolling down stones from the
heights on visitors that come not in a fashion
to please them; and they will send you over
a thicket certain damnable convincing touches
with arrows that will find out every crevice
in your armour. An' ye come not back
stuck all over with darts, like so many Saint
Sebastians, or battered like cocks with cudgels
at Shrovetide, say there is neither truth,
wisdom, nor manhood in Sir Aymer." And
so ending his free, honest speech, the knight
sat down. His blunt rebuke was lost in the
tumult of voices scoffing and shouting; and
scarcely could the knights be withheld, by
the mover of the mad enterprise himself,
from rushing out to undertake it that moment.</p>

<p>"Forbear!" said De Montfort, exalting his
voice&mdash;"forbear while I marshal the cavalcade
for the chase to-morrow. The lady
Isabelle and her damsels, most like the huntress-goddess

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

and her nymphs, shall be seated
on a hill to view us wind and run down
the prey. My lord abbot and the reverend
brethren of Normoutier shall be placed to
chaunt litanies for us on the brow of a
mountain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How far distant?" interrupted the abbot.</p>

<p>"On a peak of the Pyrenees, an' thou
wilt," said De Montfort, angrily.</p>

<p>"Nay, I speak not in respect of fear; but,
the more distant the view of a battle, the
clearer still it always proved to my sight as
it were," replied the abbot. "I promise you
I shall be the first to bear glad tidings from
the mountains; and now I bethink me,&mdash;is
there not an instance for it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quam speciosa sunt vestigia</i>," whispered
the cross-bearer.</p>

<p>"Mass and well said!" quoth the abbot:
"it was a joyous hunting-song that; but all
those carnal toys have clean slipped from my
memory."</p>

<p>"And we," pursued De Montfort, shouting
with fierce delight&mdash;"we keen hunters will

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

unearth these foxes that spoil the vineyard of
the Church, and chase them over the country
like Samsons, with firebrands at their tails.
For thee, young Paladour, do thy devoir as thou
didst on the day of tourney; and bethink thee,
it is a lighter task to lay the heads of a thousand
heretics in the dust, than to make De
Montfort's bend to his saddle-bow."&mdash;"By
Heaven, lord," said the generous Paladour,
"I have little heart for wasteful and unresisted
slaughter. It yields me no joy to
ride over a field of wretched peasantry, as I
would over the fern of a moor, and lop head
and limb as lightly as a peasant-boy mows
down thistles with his staff. Trust me, when
the poor knaves clasp my knees or footcloth
with their unarmed hands, and sue for life,
I am fain to avert my head, that I may not
see the blows I deal."</p>

<p>A murmur of derision rose among the
guests at these words, which closed the debate;
and it now only remained for the
knights each to choose a brother-in-arms for
the encounter, who might succour them when

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

assailed, or defend them if wounded, as they
had deprived themselves of the wonted attendance
of their squires and pages. Paladour
named Sir Amirald.</p>

<p>"That young knight is a stranger to
these walls, methinks," remarked De Montfort.</p>

<p>"He is no stranger to any spot where
peril may be braved or honour won," answered
Paladour.</p>

<p>"Indeed it troubles me much," said the
Lord of Courtenaye, replying to De Montfort:&mdash;"know
you the cause, valiant Sir
Paladour?" and trembling as he spoke, he
attempted to raise his eyes to the young
knight, but dropped them instantly. The
free and prompt reply of Sir Paladour that
he was ignorant of the cause, abated his
apprehensions for a moment; but he was
heard to murmur to himself, "This hawk
but <i>canceliers</i><sup id="ref022"><a href="#en022">22</a></sup>; he will pounce anon."</p>

<p>While this was passing, De Verac and

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

Semonville held a whispered sort of discontented
conversation in a recessed window,
where they had withdrawn themselves from
the carousers. "Thou seest how lightly we
are held," said the latter resentfully; "none
but this Sir Paladour to be named as the
peer of De Montfort&mdash;none but Sir Paladour
to lead the lady forth off the hall, and kiss
his fingers with apish courtesy as she mounts
her palfrey."&mdash;"I ever deemed lightly of
that lady's discretion, since she dispraised
my habit that was so curiously wrought
with&mdash;&mdash;" "I have seen it," said the other,
who justly dreaded this exordium&mdash;"it was,
indeed, of a rare and singular fashion."&mdash;"Thou
hast a marvellous subtle judgment,"
said his gratified associate; "and of a truth
I love thee; and wilt thou but join thy wit
to mine, I will confide to thee a plot that
shall pluck the feather vanity from this jay
of a Paladour, and enforce my lady to turn
the vane of her inclinations to whatsoever
point the breath of our choice may vary to."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I have but a small
wit," replied his friend; "but when I hear

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

of a plot, I promise you I rise hugely in
mine own conceit. Any churl, thou knowest,
may guide himself by his vile common
sense, and plod on in the straight-forward
path that leads to the thing he needeth;
but it is plots, schemes, quaint devices, and
delicate fine stratagems that shew the wit of
man; and truly I was always willing to be
in a plot, though I never could devise either
to frame one, or, indeed, to get out of one
when devised by another."</p>

<p>"I will disclose to thee a fine-witted, deep-reaching
trick of invention, requiring valour
withal," said De Verac.&mdash;"I pray thee then
disclose it in level terms," replied the other;
"and not as if thou wast rehearsing a troubadour's
song, or reading out of a book of
riddles."</p>

<p>"Thou hast read in the adventures of that
wandering knight, Sir Eneas of Troy, painfully
penned by the great magician Virgil."&mdash;"By
my grandame's soul, I never read line
or letter in the book thou namest."&mdash;"Sayest
thou me so? and how chanced that, Sir knight?"
"Mass, I know not; except that I never was

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

taught to read."&mdash;"A reason not to be impugned;
list, then, and mark: there were in
the train of this Sir Eneas two young knights,
by name Nisus and Euryalus, sworn brothers;
the one wore the favours of Queen
Hecuba of Troy, the other those of the most
royal lady, the Princess Cassandra her
daughter, and both had vowed to do some
high emprize in honour of their ladies. I
will now describe their arms, devices, equipments,
and caparisons."&mdash;"Time will serve
for that," said Semonville hastily, "when
thou hast found the end of thy tale."&mdash;"The
camp of Sir Eneas being besieged by a host
of godless and malicious pagans, what does
me young Sir Nisus and his comrade, but
sally forth by night among them, cut off their
heads as they slept, and carry back their arms
and spoils to their own camp, where they
were received with all manner of honours, as
shouts, music, and other delights, and royally
feasted by Sir Eneas in his tent, under a
canopy wrought by Queen Dido, his leman."&mdash;"Marry, 
a pleasant figment; but where lieth

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

the plot?" said the literal De Semonville.&mdash;"Askest 
thou? What hinders that we two sally,
forth under cover of night, kill and disperse
the heretics, and trundle their heads before us,
like so many tennis-balls, to the Castle-gate,
where if my lady look not lovingly on our
valour, and Sir Paladour shew not beside us
like a holiday peasant's tin brooch to the
topaz in my barret of tissue, say I am neither
politic nor valiant."</p>

<p>Semonville, who was as rashly brave as he
was dull and wayward, received the motion
with eager delight;&mdash;"And for our more
assurance of safety, and because we will not
be wandering all night through mire and
moor, I will borrow the squire of this Sir
Paladour, under show of helping to furbish
mine armour for the morrow. Men say
he hath marvellous skill in the perplexed
paths with which this region aboundeth."
"It is colourable; it is semblable," said De
Verac with a nod of assent.&mdash;"Thus shall
his vain courtesy (for he refuseth nothing
gently sought) work his annoyance and defeat."&mdash;"But,"

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

whispered Semonville anxiously, "how shall we make escape?&mdash;the
craven lord of the Castle hath the drawbridge
raised, and the keys of all the gates from
barbican to postern brought to him, ere he
sleeps."&mdash;"I have a plot too for that, which
I will shew thee if thou wilt come to my
chamber&mdash;slack not to borrow Sir Paladour's
squire, and follow me."</p>

<p>The boon was asked with dogged reserve,
and granted by Paladour with graceful courtesy;
and the pair then retired to prepare for
their sally from the Castle before midnight.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>The lady Isabelle sat late within her
chamber that night. She had determined on
accompanying the Crusaders on the morrow,
lest her farther refusal might expose her to
the suspicion of heterodoxy (a charge which
her conscience could not altogether disclaim,
for pity in that age was heterodoxy, if
felt for heretics); and she prolonged her
orisons late, supplicating alternately for

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

the safety of the Crusaders, and the deliverance
of the devoted Albigeois. Towards
midnight she was disturbed by the
sound of something heavy dropping into the
court, and then of steps traversing it hastily.
She opened the casement of her oratory, and
looked out. The moon had risen; but the
tower in which her chamber lay threw its
vast shadow across the court, concealing
those who trod it with speed and in darkness.
They were De Verac, Semonville, and
the attendant, with a damsel of her train.
This female, who had been lightly won by
the gorgeous habits and courtly language of
Verac, had prevailed on her brother, the
solitary warder of a neglected tower in the
outer wall of the Castle, to assist them in
escaping from a casement of it, and facilitating
their passage over the moat, which
was there nearly dry. As the lady gazed
forth, another casement opened at some distance;
and she paused for a space, irresolute
whether to address a figure that appeared
indistinctly at it. "Who is it?" at length

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

she said, "who watches at this late hour?"&mdash;"It
is your beauty's servant and ever-wakeful
meditator," answered the voice of
Paladour.</p>

<p>"Did you hear steps or see figures cross
the court of the Castle?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"I did, noble lady: they were doubtless
menials whom 'tendance on the banquet held
late, and who are hastening to their lodgings."</p>

<p>"Alas! Sir knight, hie you to your couch,"
said the Lady: "to-morrow will be a day of
toil, if not of peril, and you must needs lack
rest."</p>

<p>"I may not rest, noble lady: my heart
is heavy with many evil bodements, and my
brain is possessed with thick and gloomy
fantasies. I have wrestled with, but cannot
overcome them: a vague and shapeless presage
of some undefined disaster keeps me
waking. Lady, for the love of Heaven, quit
not these towers to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"I fear my uncle's chiding, the blunt
scoffs of that rude lord De Montfort, and
the solemn anger of the bishop, more than

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

aught of peril in to-morrow's encounter,"
answered the lady. "And now a fair good
rest, Sir Paladour: I might be lightly held,
were I to prolong this conference at such late
hour. The best thoughts of the night, and
the lightest slumbers, be about your pillow!"</p>

<p>"Farewell, bright saint!&mdash;and may the
pure spirits that minister to virgins' dreams,
weave thine of such hues and texture as
glow in the visions of sleeping saints, who
part dreaming of Paradise&mdash;to wake in
Heaven!"</p>

<br/>

<p>THAT night was to the Albigeois one of
unmixed consternation and horror.</p>

<p>The delegates returned with their answer
of desolation. The devoted people saw their
doom approach without the possibility of
averting or retarding it; not a resource was
left. If they attempted to pass into Arragon,
or to seek the Cevennes, the army of the
Crusaders interposed itself. Amid the rocks
and mountains where they now wandered,
they must shortly perish by famine. Beziers
and Carcassonne were in ruins. Their friends
in Toulouse were unable to protect them,
could they even reach that city in safety; and

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

the possibility of aid being supplied by Count
Raymond had never occurred to them, for
they were ignorant of his arrival in France.
They saw "they were in evil plight." Some
of the more enterprising leaders and enthusiastic
preachers, among whom were Mattathias
and Boanerges, suggested the idea of
resistance; and even exhorted them to "resist
unto blood."</p>

<p>But this proposal to an unarmed multitude,
half of whom were women and children,
only added to despondence the conviction
of its helplessness. And after an
evening of gloomy deliberation, they embraced
with sore reluctance the last feeble
chance of safety: this was, to separate into
small distinct parties, and pursue various directions,
some seeking shelter in the mountains,
and some going towards Toulouse, that
thus detached and divided, without appearance
of union or resistance, they might afford
less cause either for cupidity or hostility;
"and thus," said Pierre, "if Edom and the
armed men with him come and smite one

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

band, peradventure the other may escape,
and a remnant yet be saved."</p>

<p>But this melancholy resolution, which
necessarily involved the separation of the
robust from the feeble, of parents from children,
and of husbands from wives, required
strength from above to support the victims in
the moment of its execution. With fainting
hearts and wearied spirits they implored that
it might be deferred till dawn, and that this,
the last night of their earthly intercourse,
might be passed in prayer.</p>

<p>Fearful of being molested in their devotions
by some of the fierce and licentious train
of the Crusaders, who still loitered in scattered
bands on the plain, they removed some distance
to a spot whose deep and secret solitude
had often afforded them concealment,
and from whence their "songs of the night"
had often arisen, heard only by the ear of
Heaven.</p>

<p>It was night when they entered the rocky
defile which led to a spot that seemed the
oratory of Nature. The narrow path suddenly

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

opened into an area, enclosed on every
side by vast masses of rock; these masses
projected as they ascended, so that, though
the space below could contain the whole
multitude, the precipices, almost meeting
above, disclosed but a small portion of the
heavens, whose brightly-twinkling stars alone
proved to the eye it could be visible there.
These appeared intensely vivid, as if seen
from the bottom of a well.</p>

<p>The projections of the rocks, intercepting
rain and dew, had precluded all vegetation, except
where a few wild ash-trees twined their
knotted fantastic roots among the fissures.
One or two dark rills tinkled down the sides
of the rock, and meeting in a brown and
stilly pool at the bottom, seemed to rest there;
then struggling on, forced their way, with a
hoarse and troubled murmur, through the
defile by which the wanderers entered the
valley. Here the Albigeois assembled for
the last time, to all human conjecture. In
this last hour of danger, the innumerable
differences that had distracted them in hours

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

of comparative safety, and which, in the
exaggerations of their zeal, had often appeared
as important as the vital doctrines of
Christianity, now appeared lighter than vanity
itself. The endless divisions and subdivisions
of restless and unappeasable polemics,
the doubtful gloss, the minute distinction,
the metaphysical subtlety, the verbal nicety&mdash;labour
as profitless as the attempt to
divide an unit, or discover parts in a point&mdash;were
all forgotten. And with one voice and
one heart the congregation called on their
ancient pastor to offer up his prayers with
and for them, peradventure for the last
time.</p>

<p>In this hour of extremity not only were
systems compromised, but all distinction of
characters was absorbed, as bodies lose their
varieties of colour on the approach of night.
The petulant acrimony of the deacon, the
stern enthusiasm of Boanerges, the fanatic
fury of Mattathias, were all subdued, all silenced,
and the pure faith and meek holiness
of the aged Pierre rose like the ark triumphant

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

over the waves, under whose prevailing
waters the tops of the highest mountains
were covered.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the voice of Pierre
ceased, from his exhausted strength; and the
whole multitude prayed in silence with their
faces to the earth. Such was their absorption
of spirit and intensity of devotion, that a
shriek from one of the females was unheard,
till its repetition made those who were near
her demand the cause. Apart from the
rest, she said she had heard an arrow whistle
past her, and seen it lodge among some
bushes at the entrance of the defile. Some,
upon hastening to the spot, found the arrow
still quivering there, and exclaimed in terror
they were betrayed, and the signal was given
for the work of slaughter.</p>

<p>Pierre checked the alarm by pointing out
to them that the arrow was purposely sent in
a direction where it could do no mischief;
and he ventured even to intimate his hopes
that it might rather be the effort of a friend
to warn them, than of a foe to molest them.

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

A few moments of agonizing expectation
passed, while this hope was to be confirmed
or defeated:&mdash;they were soon over. A second
arrow came whizzing past them in the same
direction, and those who watched its flight
saw a scroll attached to it. A hundred hands
were instantly employed in searching for
this missile, whose friendly purport was no
longer matter of doubt, even to the most
desponding. It was found and unfolded, a
light was quickly struck, and it was singular
that amid this poor and illiterate multitude,
there were more to be found who possessed
the rare acquirement of being able to read,
than in the Castle of the Lord of Courtenaye&mdash;so
intense had been their zeal for obtaining
the knowledge of Scripture. The
superscription was "To the Church which
is in the wilderness." And Boanerges, to
whom it was given to be read, recognized
the hand-writing of a chaplain of the Count
of Toulouse; a man zealously attached to
the cause of the Albigeois, and no less so to
the Jewish phraseology, by which the more

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

enthusiastic of that day delighted to distinguish
themselves. It contained the following
words:</p>

<p>"Whereas ye are as men appointed unto
death, and as prisoners in the hold where
there is no water, and because many dogs have
come about you, and fat bulls of Basan close
you in on every side; therefore now look up
and lift up your heads, for your deliverance
draweth high, for behold he whom men call
Raymond, even the lord of Toulouse, hath confronted
the man of sin, which is antichrist,
whose palace standeth on the seven hills.
And lo, he hath passed over from the South,
and cometh up to the help of the Lord
against the mighty, even as Barak, the son
of Abinoam, came up from Kedesh Naphthali
with ten thousand men at his feet, all of
them mighty men of valour, men who draw
the sword. And because ye have sent aforetime
messengers to him saying, Slack not
thy hand from thy servants, but come unto
us and help us, that we perish not; therefore
now be strong and of good courage, for, as

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

the Lord liveth, before the morning be spread
upon the mountains, your help shall be swift
and sure, and though ye mourn with a very
great mourning, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon
in the valley of Megiddo, yet a
little while and your name shall be no longer
Bochim,<sup id="ref023"><a href="#en023">23</a></sup> but your name shall be called Mahershalal-hash-baz,<sup id="ref024"><a href="#en024">24</a></sup>
because of the prey and of
the spoil which the Lord shall give you of
your enemies round about. And behold I,
even I, have sent a swift messenger (whose
running is as the running of Ahimaaz, the
son of Zadok, who overran Cushi by the way
of the plain, in the matter of Absalom,) and I
have straitly charged him saying, make no
long tarrying or delaying, and it shall be if
the men, the children of Belial compass thee
round about, that thou shalt make fast the
letters to a swift arrow, and"&mdash;Here the
manuscript was torn, and nothing but the
signature was legible. "Written in the
tenth day of the sixth month, even the

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

month September, by me Zerubbabel, whom
men call Bertrand de Var."</p>

<p>The effect produced on the assembly by
the perusal of this letter was in its expression
as single as it was profound: with one accord
they threw themselves with their faces on
the earth in a mute agony of solemn gratitude;
and the thanksgiving for a deliverance
almost miraculous rose from their hearts
alone.</p>

<p>There was now but one voice and one resolution
among the whole multitude; with
renewed strength and rekindled courage they
prepared to penetrate further among the hills
in the direction where they might expect the
approaching army of the Count of Toulouse,
the van of which they hoped to meet before
the dawn of morning, and under whose flank
they might find protection during the awful
day, for whose event they pleaded solemnly
to the God of battles. In the elevation
of sudden hope, Mattathias and some of the
more warlike, even proposed to set forth and
encounter the band, who, from the latter part

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

of the letter, it was plain had intercepted the
messenger; and this proposal, though rash
and untimely, was so eagerly embraced, that
Pierre forbore his fruitless opposition, and
about fifty, armed with clubs and arrows, set
out on the expedition, accompanied by Boanerges
and the deacon, who, with a sudden
illapse of valour, joined them, exclaiming,
that the "lame should take the prey." The
rest commenced their progress into the mountains,
and for some time hope supplying them
with supernatural strength, the most dejected
forgot their fears, and the feeblest their weakness.
But it was soon found that physical
obstacles long continued are an overmatch for
the power of imagination, however excited.
The strongest and most resolute had departed
with Mattathias, and the multitude who were
journeying onward consisted chiefly of those
who were feeblest in sex and in age, in all the
lassitude of weariness and inanition.</p>

<p class="small">"With her child of yesterday<br/>

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

<p>The acclivities of the mountains seemed
to become more arduous, and the mist that
enveloped their summits seemed to darken
as they approached them; many sat down in
a mortal stupor, from which no power could
wake them; and many, who still retained
their intellect, with all the earnestness of
suppliants implored that they might lie down
and die. It was then that their aged pastor,
and the ministering angel at his side, collected
the last remains of their strength and spirits
to sustain those whom hope and life were fast
deserting. To those who were yet rational,
he suggested the hope of deliverance; to the
desponding, the consolations of religion: for
every fear he had a word of alleviation&mdash;for
every complainer a topic of comfort. He cherished
every purpose of exertion; he fanned
every spark of hope; and even when the lamp
was gone out, he could supply it from the
rich abundance with which faith had lighted
his own. It was a rare and holy sight to see
the weakest in sex and in years&mdash;an ancient
man and a youthful maiden&mdash;concentrate in

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

themselves all the physical energy that could
command success, with all the mental fortitude
that defies despair.</p>

<p>Thus sustained and excited, the sufferers
prepared for their last effort&mdash;it was made in
profound silence; every one reserved his
breath for the struggle&mdash;not a word was
heard of fear or of hope, of comfort or of
murmur. The effort was made&mdash;the summit
was won&mdash;the mist that covered the tops of
the mountain rolled slowly down its sides
into the valley, where it lay like an ocean.
A line of golden light fleckered the opposite
horizon: it broadened&mdash;it brightened, till the
sun burst forth in glory on the hills far eastward,
and his first level rays glanced brightly
on the broad banners and fair and widespread
array of the army of Count Raymond
of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The shout uttered by the Albigeois at this
sight, resembled that sent forth by the crew
of a vessel just going to pieces when day
reveals to them a friendly shore, and boats

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

putting off to their assistance: it was a mixture
of joy and desperation. The shouts that
greeted them, on the other hand, were like
those that hail the numbed and sunken-hearted
mariner, inspiring hope and promising
security.</p>

<p>All that they had dwelt on with anxious
hope for many days, all that had sustained
their spirits with distant and visionary comfort,
was now realized in almost as many
hours. To distribute nourishment, raiment,
and cheering felicitations of safety and auguries
of success, to assist those who were still
able to reach the van of Count Raymond's
army, and to encircle the hill with a band of
archers for the protection of those who were
not&mdash;to do all that the approach of danger
would permit to be done, and say all that
haste would suffer them to say, may easily be
imagined as the prompt and joyful office
of their friends.</p>

<p>Among multitudes thus singularly thrown
together, there were many recognitions as

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

singular&mdash;mothers and daughters in the pastor's
band recognized long-divided relatives
in those who approached to welcome and
protect them; and in the host of Raymond
many a visor was raised to gaze on countenances
that seemed to them like those seen
in a dream; and many a mailed arm strained
in its clasp a form never expected to be embraced
on this side the grave. But these endearments
were short and mournful: clouded
by the recollection of past calamity, and interrupted
by the preparation for approaching
danger.</p>

<p>It was not till the pastor had seen the
feeblest of his flock supplied with the means
of rest and refreshment, and the others content
with the promise of them, that he began
to sink under the fatigue that had already
exhausted bodies far more vigorous and minds
of more unyielding texture. Unable to descend
the hill or cross the valley, he prepared
to take the only repose the place afforded, by
resting his head on the knees of Genevieve,
who had seated herself on the ground beside

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

him, and whose white small fingers, clasped on
his forehead, made delicate contrast to its deep
furrows, dark hue, and dishevelled hoariness.
Conscious of his exhausted strength, he replied
to the importunities of Arnaud, and
Genevieve's mute pressure of his hand, only
by a faint smile, and a whisper, that that
spot must be his Pisgah, since he was unable
to enter into, or even (he added with
a meek sigh) behold the land of rest from its
summit.</p>

<p>The enquiries of Arnaud, however, soon
discovered a sojourn less comfortless; and he
hasted back with the intelligence, that if
Pierre could summon strength enough to
descend the declivity of the hill but a few
paces, there was a cave, which had been
inhabited by an eremite not long deceased,
where he would be sheltered at least from
the chill breeze of the mountains, and might
rest on the bed of leaves its last inhabitant
had left there. Supported by Genevieve and
Arnaud, he struggled to make the attempt;
and Genevieve, as they slowly approached

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

the spot, struck by its character of shade,
seclusion, and quiet, mentally wished for
such a retreat from the "sound of the trumpet
and the alarm of war," where her pure
existence might be passed in devotion, and
sustained only by the herbs of the field and
the stream that trickled from the rock. The
hermitage was a cave scooped by the hand of
Nature out of the rock; art had added one or
two cavities for containing the crucifix and
bed of its solitary inhabitant: to form these
had been his only earthly employment. The
entrance to the cave was shaded by some
firs and pines; a small stream had worn its
way down the upper cliff, and fell into a stone
basin just at the entrance; above it rose a
rude crucifix, formed out of the rock, but
now clustered over with moss and ivy, so as
to be almost indistinguishable: a few mossy
branches of fir, once triangularly disposed,
indicated a rude attempt at a belfry; but
there was now neither bell nor hand to
toll it! Genevieve, in spite of her creed,
thought how holy and refreshing amid these

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

wilds, without track or tenant, its sound
must once have been to the wandering traveller
amid the shades of evening, or the wakeful
religieux to whose ear it came amid the
stillness of night. The door of wood still
remained with its bolt and staple, apparently
intended as a defence against the wolves or
bears: its inmate was probably above the
fears as well as the wishes that depend on,
or are connected with, the agency of man.
Here the pastor was conveyed, and here
some of the more weak and weary were collected
to congratulate and to partake of his
retreat.</p>

<p>Genevieve had hardly spread the bed of
withered leaves, and assisted the pastor to
stretch his chilled and painful limbs on them,
when a tumult of voices was heard without;
and all hurried to the entrance to catch the
sounds. Every ear was now as awake to the
tidings of success, as they had been but a
few hours before to the murmurs of despondency.
In this case they were not mistaken.</p>

<p>The party of Mattathias and Boanerges

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

had surprised and led captive those who
had been the means of scaring the messenger
of Count Raymond's chaplain from
approaching the retreat of the Albigeois;
and were now returning with their prize,
disputing the whole way how they were to
dispose of them.</p>

<p>The captives were no other than the hapless
adventurers De Verac, Semonville, and
their ill-chosen guide, the squire of Sir Paladour,
who still retained his boast of knowing
every mountain-path and forest track in
Languedoc, and his habit of leading astray
every one who trusted to his guidance.</p>

<p>Long before they approached the cave,
the shrill voice of Deacon Mephibosheth was
heard exclaiming, "They shall be for a prey
and a spoil, even as Shalman spoiled Betharbel
in the day of battle: her infants were
dashed in pieces, and her women with child
ripped up."</p>

<p>The dogged and mortified tones of Semonville
were heard in reply:&mdash;"Thou liest,
foul knave! I am no infant; I would

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

thou wouldst know it; and if thou rippest
me up for a woman with child, thou art no
better than a notorious liar, and I will hang
thee for it an' there be law in all Christentye,
or Languedoc, which comes nearer to the
matter."</p>

<p>The affectedly effeminate accents of Verac
were then heard exclaiming, "Good knaves!
good scoundrels! most worthy and absolute
rascals! I pray you throttle me an' you will;
but let it be with aught but your greasy
fingers: a lady's garter will serve, if such
commodity may be found here. Good goat-bearded
apostle (to Boanerges), preach to thy
hirsute brethren; thou shouldst have a fellow-feeling
for my mustachios. I warrant me now
thou hast no crisping tongs to countervail the
damage they have undergone withal. Good
fellow! good selvaggio! most dulcified and
depilated Orson (to Mattathias), if thou wilt
needs be near me, at least restore me my
pouncet-box, that I die not the death of the
unsavoury." All this time the deacon was
drawing tighter the cords which bound the

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

hands of the luckless knight. "I thank thee,
gentle squire, for the courtesy bestowed on my
wrists; extend it so far, I pray thee, as not
to profane with thy plebeian touch the tissue
sleeve which&mdash;&mdash;God's nails, and all other
petty oaths!" he exclaimed with unrestrained
vexation, as one of the rudest of the
party, thinking he talked too fast and moved
too slow, gave him a thrust <i>au derriere</i>&mdash;"God's
nails! the villain hath not only made
incision in my flesh, but hath rent my gambazon,
quilted with thread of gold and lilac,
in a most delicate and unnameable part.
What, Bucolican Sylvan! deemest thou art
goading an ox to tillage, or&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Lead them on!" said the stern voice of
Mattathias, "that we may hew them to
pieces before the Lord in Gilgal."</p>

<p>"There is no such place in France, thou
wordy fellow," said Semonville, sturdily:
"and I would I might be hanged ere I consent
to be hewed in pieces for any man's
pleasure in outlandish parts; never trust me
else: so look to it, thou wert best."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

<p>"I pray thee, let us first examine them,"
said Boanerges; "it may be that we may
gather something out of them."</p>

<p>Arnaud joined in this petition, which he
enforced by strong reasons; and Mattathias,
though refusing to be convinced by either,
leaned on his club at a distance, and growled
a sullen assent. The party were then ushered
into the cave. Pierre was plunged into that
profound deep which no tumult could disturb;
and Genevieve cast her eyes on the band only
to see if Amand were yet alive, and among
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile others of the party were examining
the splendid armour and ornaments
which they had lost no time in despoiling
their prisoners of. Mattathias was attempting
to adapt to his giant limbs the corslet
and cuisses of the slender De Verac; and
Boanerges was exclaiming that the richly
inlaid vant-brace should be made plates of
gold for the coverings of the altar.</p>

<p>"And what hast thou won?" said Arnaud
to the deacon: "I trow thou hast not been
slack in the matter of the spoil."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

<p>"Of a verity it is a kid," replied the deacon;
"even a kid of the goats, which the
men, the sons of Belial, have roasted with
fire, and would as it were have eaten very
exceedingly; but now behold it shall lie on
mine own platter, and be carved with mine
own knife, and be unto me as a kid."</p>

<p>Arnaud now commenced his examination
of the prisoners. "Sir Crusader," said he
to De Verac, "your goodly mien and armour
of price show you to be of high lineage,"&mdash;"This
is the only selvaggio who hath
spoken to the purpose yet," said De Verac.&mdash;"Wherefore,
if you deal truly with us in
this matter, and tell us the numbers, purpose,
and array of the Crusaders, we will hold you
to ransom; but an' ye will not, know that
your life is merely jeoparded; and who is
he that shall deliver you out of our hands?"</p>

<p>"Here's a goodly catechising!" quoth the
knight, in high disdain: "shall tissue be
bound to answer frieze, and the jewelled barret
courtesy to the woollen cap. I tell thee,
vile churl, I scorn to parley with thee, wast

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

thou robed in goat-skins with the hair outward."</p>

<p>"Why, thou thing of velvet and feathers!"
exclaimed Mattathias, fiercely, "thou mere
fardel of an Italian pedlar, an' thou art not
conformable, I will be myself thy tailor, and
take measure of thee with this club, in such
sort that thou shalt think the devil is broke
loose:&mdash;thy doublet shall be slashed after a
fashion of mine own devising;&mdash;the trunk
pinked, not with needles, but with lances
and arrows;&mdash;thy vest shall be seamed from
collar to girdle by a curious two-handed
sword;&mdash;and thy skin left hanging in slips
about thee, like the points that truss thy
hose withal."</p>

<p>"Send a thousand arrows through me,
base churls!" said the gallant-minded coxcomb,
"even the whole ammunition of your
rascaille band, and then despair to hear aught
from me but the defiance and disdain I utter
now."</p>

<p>Here he attempted once more to fling
himself into a graceful attitude; but feeling

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

the pressure of the cords, exclaimed in the
double anguish of pain and mortified vanity,
"Curse thee, peasant! undo me these cords:
their damnable ligatures will not let me even
die like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Thou hast come to us, like Agag, delicately,
and like Agag shalt thou perish," said
the fierce warrior, raising his club.</p>

<p>"Oh, spare him!" cried Genevieve&mdash;"spare
the gallant knight!&mdash;alas, for pity!
Must he die for valour and good faith?"</p>

<p>"I do perceive," said Verac to himself,
"that this heretic damsel hath a glimmering&mdash;as
it were, a small light of discretion."</p>

<p>Mattathias suspended his blow, not at her
entreaty, but at the uproar in another part
of the cave, where a similar conference between
Boanerges and Semonville was just
arriving at a similar conclusion.</p>

<p>"Dolt-headed and unnurtured lord!" said
the indignant preacher, "a club may convince
thy skull; but it were vain boasting
to say it could beat thy brains out."</p>

<p>"There's a jest!" said the literal De

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

Semonville; "as if a man's brains were to
be found any where but in his skull, I trow;&mdash;but
all's one for that. You have despoiled
me of mine armour, and pinioned me here,
as men truss a capon for my lady's trencher;
and if you beat my brains out, I would you
would know I ever valued them the least of
my possessings. Here's goodly handling of
a noble by a villain peasant!"</p>

<p>"Better than thy meed, thou railing
Rabshakeh!" retorted the preacher: "what
usage had we met at thy hands, had we
fallen into them? When did thou and thy
godless companions spare the life of an
Albigeois?"</p>

<p>"And reason good," quoth the knight.
"Why, thou puzzle-headed knave! is there
no difference atween us? Are not we sons
of Holy Church, and ye vile heretics, whom
we are licensed to slay, abolish, and demolish
when need serves, and on lawful occasions?
What! hast no sense?&mdash;canst not make a
difference? with a pestilence to thee!"</p>

<p>Another pleading shriek from Genevieve

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

withheld the arm of Boanerges. "Oh,
harm him not!" she cried; "shed not the
blood of the helpless and the prisoner!"</p>

<p>"Mass!" said De Verac: "the light of
the damsel's discretion is marvellously in the
wane, when she pleads for such an ass as De
Semonville."</p>

<p>"Maiden," said Mattathias, "thou hast
no part in this matter. Befits it thee to mix
in the council of the saints, or the deeds of
warriors? Did Saul's daughter strive with
the prophet when he smote the Amalekite?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no!" said Genevieve, timidly retreating;
"but she saved the life of David,
when Saul sent men to slay him."</p>

<p>"We waste time," said Arnaud, "with
these foolish knights."&mdash;("I knew they would
call me a fool," said Semonville: "it is
passing strange how all men find out that,
as if I had ever told them of it.")&mdash;"They
know not the deliverance that hath been
wrought for us: take them forth and let
them behold the armies of the faithful
covering the mountains, and then they will

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

gladly ransom life and safety at the price we
name."</p>

<p>The prisoners were then rudely thrust to
the entrance of the cave and bid to lift up
their eyes and behold.</p>

<p>"Look forth," said Mattathias, "look
forth, behold Israel is come up by tribes unto
the battle, and the Canaanite shall perish
out of the land."</p>

<p>"Look forth," repeated Boanerges, "for
behold the mountains are covered with chariots
and with horses of fire, like that vision
of Elijah in Dothan."</p>

<p>The prisoners beheld the full array of the
army of Count Raymond. "Woe, woe to
you, clear and gallant spirits," cried De
Verac, in the anguish of sudden conviction;
"ye have perilled your lives and
honour in vain. Some hundred armed
knights against a host, and led by Raymond
of Toulouse! Oh, for the men at arms that
are slumbering within the fatal towers of
Courtenaye!"&mdash;"What sayest thou?" said
Arnaud.&mdash;"It boots not to ask," said Mattathias,

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

who drank-in the unguarded exclamation
with ear and soul; "still less may it
boot delaying: saddle me a swift horse that
I may suddenly bear the tidings to Count
Raymond. Thou wilt go with me, brother
Boanerges?"&mdash;"Of a surety I will," answered
he:&mdash;"such tidings must not cool by the
way."&mdash;"I will also go with you," said
Arnaud, seizing on the horse of Semonville;
"peradventure ye have taken up this matter
unadvisedly."</p>

<p>Mattathias returned no answer, and the
party were setting off at full speed when the
deacon, who had discussed his kid, seized
the stirrup of Mattathias, exclaiming, "And
who is to guard the prisoners?"&mdash;"Thou, if
thou wilt," said Mattathias, flinging him off:
"what, are they not bound, and hath not the
door of the cave a bolt and staple? Away to
thy ward, Sir deacon, and I pray thee surfeit
not thy prisoners by a too plentiful share of
thy prize"&mdash;and he galloped off.</p>

<p>"I warrant thee for that," said the deacon,
looking after them: "they shall not have

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

a morsel to comfort their hearts&mdash;not a
morsel. In, in; ye have heard your sentence,
ye erring knights; look for no refreshment
but the sweet word in season, which shall
be administered to you abundantly."</p>

<p>"Spare us thy cursed chattering," said De
Verac, "and we will hold all privation light."&mdash;"I 
would I had the golden legend here," said
Semonville, "or, indeed, any book of riddles;
I never skilled to read, but my old tutor,
who was a Benedictine monk, made me commit
many of them to memory, and methinks
to knock a hard text or a <i>l'envoy</i> about his
head, would give me a huge delight."</p>

<p>"In, in, I say," cried the deacon, in all the
pride of authority: "ye will not linger thus
at the gates of Lucifer."&mdash;"How should
we," said De Verac, "seeing we shall have so
apt a porter as thou art? By the mass, this
cursed door was made for the entrance only
of shaveling hermits or hooded peasants.
Nay, there be uses in calamity&mdash;had I my
plumed cap of maintenance on, I must be
fain to enter on all fours."</p>

<br/>

<p>IT was with terror that Genevieve saw the
prisoners committed to such a hold and such a
warder. They were both in the full vigour of
their strength, their friends were perhaps approaching
even if they were unable to liberate
themselves, and their only guards were the
aged and feeble Pierre, a young maiden, and
the deacon, who, exclusive of his infirmity,
was never suspected of carrying his courage
to any dangerous extremity. From the disconsolate
demeanour of the knights there
was not, indeed, much to be apprehended.
They sat gloomily down on a rude bench

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

of stone, where their bound arms, drooping
heads, and <i>dos-&agrave;-dos</i> position, made each
resemble the figure of the <i>tristis captivus in
arcu</i> in an old Roman triumph.</p>

<p>"So here we are," said De Verac dolefully,
"like a pair of birds trussed for these cannibals.
Men say, the filthy knaves stick not
to eat horse-flesh, and even ass-flesh; what
then may'st <i>thou</i> expect, De Semonville?"&mdash;"If
they devour me," said his companion,
"never trust me an' I do not make shift to
stick in their throats, let them take it how
they will."&mdash;"Instead of lying at peace on
thy blazoned monument in effigy, thy feet
resting on a greyhound, thy shield by thy
side, and thy hands joined in a fashion as if
thou wert praying, heralds blazoning thy
'scutcheon, priests singing mass, clerks penning
goodly epitaphs"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There thou touchest me," said Semonville,
almost weeping; "instead of all this, to
be wambling about in the guts of a filthy Albigeois,
like a frog in a marsh! Would that the

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

first morsel of me might choke them, or may
I never see mine own castle again!"&mdash;"Not
a morsel, not a single morsel," repeated the
deacon, entering the cave after securing the
door inside and out with the best of his care.
"Curse thee, slave!" said De Verac, to whom
the cupidity of his jailor had suggested a faint
hope of deliverance: "Curse thee! dost thou
think such mechanical morsels were ever intended
for the food of a noble or knight?"&mdash;"Slander
not my kid," said the deacon,
"whose flavour, of a verity, was as delicious
as if he had descended from the goats of Nebaioth,
or the flocks of Kedar."</p>

<p>"Now if I could get this fool to join me,"
said De Verac; then raising his voice, "why,
thou eldest child of famine and apparent
heir of mere emptiness! thou who hast slept
in a warren that thou mightest have visions
of vermin; and hast given thanks over a
second course of flies! who hast surfeited at
the mere smell of a cook-shop, and lain drunk
two days from winding a pipe of Malvoisie,

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

at the distance of a league! I tell thee thou
wouldst fall into a trance at the bare mention
of the viands our sumpter-mule carried but
last night."&mdash;"Of a surety the good creatures
should not be disregarded," said the deacon,
who hearkened with his very mouth; "and
now that I think on't, what might your stores
contain?"</p>

<p>"If I could but make this fool understand
me now!" said De Verac: "rememberest thou,
Semonville, the delicious contents of our"&mdash;&mdash;"Mine,"
said De Semonville, "held a piece
of marchpane, an agnus, and a charm for
the tooth-ache,"&mdash;"Thou dreamest or ravest,"
said Verac; "there was a huge nook of
pasty, some half-dozen pheasants and partridge&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Were
they red-legged?" interrupted
the deacon:&mdash;"As my lady's fool in his
new hosen," said De Verac:&mdash;"a vast conger
with a mane like a war-steed, and a sturgeon
that the king's fishmonger rode on up
the Seine to Paris, as there was no boat
large enough to hold him."&mdash;"May this be

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

true?" said Mephibosheth.&mdash;"Have faith in
it, I tell thee, thou unconvinced deacon,"
answered Verac; "otherwise perish in unbelief,
and be damned, like a heretic as thou
art, to everlasting hunger."</p>

<p>Semonville, who saw the turn matters were
taking, had the sense to hold his tongue. "And
may I hope to find these curious viands thou
tellest of?"&mdash;"Thou wilt find them, that is,
if thou make speed; otherwise the Crusaders,
or some of thy own vile brethren, will taste
of dainty fare ere long."&mdash;"I will gird up
my loins, and that suddenly," said the deacon,
with much trepidation: "foul shame
and sin it were if any of the weaker brethren
fell into a gin and a snare because of the
savoury meats of the wicked. Surely for
<i>them</i> to taste of the accursed thing in any
wise, were exceeding sinful&mdash;it were abominable,
and not good."&mdash;"Peradventure the
mule may have strayed a mile or twain
into the forest," said Verac; "in such case
thou wilt not be slack to follow it."&mdash;"Tell
me not of miles," said the deacon, "my feet

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

are as harts' feet, and as a young roe's upon
the mountains."</p>

<p>Genevieve, whose terrors increased every
moment, now at last feebly and fearfully
attempted to detain him. "Can it be," she
cried, "that thou art about to depart and
desert us in this strait? Alas! how will you
answer for your charge, left in the hands of
a feeble maiden and a weak old man?"&mdash;"Woman,"
answered the deacon, "why
troublest thou me? Are they not bound, and
hath not the door a bolt? I tell thee, inasmuch
as lyeth in me, shall the weaker
brethren be saved from the snare, even
though I devoured the viands myself; yea, all
of them, or hid them secretly beneath in the
earth."&mdash;"The fiend fly away with thee for
a dissembling glutton!" said Verac, as the
deacon departed;&mdash;"and thou," to Semonville,
"couldst not aid me by a word to
uphold his humour of luxury?"&mdash;"By holy
Mary," answered the other, "thou didst
utter forth such enormous lies about a
sturgeon riding on the king of France and I

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

know not what, that at first I deemed thou
wast crazed; and I promise thee I never
much affected lies, except they were told in
the way of honesty, as lies should always be."&mdash;"Hush!&mdash;and
to our task."</p>

<p>The last sound of the deacon's halting steps
was no sooner heard, than the knights began
to apply the ropes with which their hands were
bound to a sharp projection of the rock that
was near them, and to try and cut them by the
friction. For some time their industry was
more painful than profitable, and their hands
were stripped of skin and streamed with blood
before a single rope gave way. At length
knot after knot yielded, and the ropes began
to hang in shreds about their wrists.</p>

<p>Genevieve saw it, and comprehended the
extremity of her danger; but terror, instead
of paralyzing her strong mind, only stimulated
it, and the very approach of peril suggested
to her the means of escaping from it,
and making a friend of the exigency.</p>

<p>Amand, whose romanceful wanderings had
made him acquainted with every cave in the

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

hills of Languedoc, had availed himself of
his short stay to point out to her that in
case of danger there was a funnel or narrow
passage winding upward through the
rock right over where the hermit had lighted
his fire of dried leaves. She now turned
her eyes on it, and prepared to speak:
"Noble knights," said she, in a faltering
voice, "I see your purpose, and vain were it
for a feeble maiden to say she could resist it.
It is easy to cut the ropes that bind you,
and easier to break through that shattered
door; but as you value your lives, risk them
not in such desperate purpose."</p>

<p>"What says the heretic damsel?" asked
Semonville, tugging hard at his manacles.&mdash;"By
heaven, I know not," said Verac, "but
never did I hear such a silvery and lute-toned
voice breathe from plebeian lips: I
am rapt in listening, and am in sooth as
one&mdash;"&mdash;"Heed not now what thou art
<i>as</i>" said the other, "but what thou <i>art</i>
indeed:&mdash;say on, damsel;&mdash;the devil himself
must have knit this knot."&mdash;"I say," said

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

Genevieve, her courage rising with her fears,
"that a thousand lances will be aimed at the
breast of him who dares present it at that
threshold; and should you by miracle escape
to the hills, ten thousand arrows, from bows
that never failed, will pursue your flight, and
nail you to the earth. There are, indeed,
means of safe and secret escape, but they are
known to me alone; nor will I sell the knowledge
for nought."&mdash;"Show us the means,
and thou shalt find us no niggards for the
nonce," quoth Semonville.&mdash;"I do note some
lineaments of likelihood in the damsel," said
Verac; "some touches of love's pencil, toys
of Cytherea, and odd remnants of the Graces;
that is, an' her hood were better set, and
her loose exorbitant locks were submissive to
the hot rebuke and tortuous discipline of the
silver tongs."&mdash;"Oh, heed not me," said
Genevieve, tremblingly eager to withdraw
their attention from herself&mdash;"think of your
valiant lives, your precious moments: there
is a path by which you may win the summit
of the hill, beyond the reach of fleet arrow or

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

keen eye; and if I point it out to you, what
shall be my guerdon?"&mdash;"I will straightway
betake myself to it, to prove I am not unthankful,"
said Semonville; "and, moreover,
I will fill thy hood with bezants&mdash;that is, when
thy people restore me that they have robbed
me of."&mdash;"Noble knight, I ask no gold,"
said the maiden timidly.&mdash;"Tush, I knew she
would 'sdeign thy proffer," said Verac; "thou
art fitter to treat for thy ransom with a greedy
peasant or gold-griping Jew, than with a
damsel in the vanity of her rustical comeliness;
I tell thee, maid, thou shalt have a mantle
guarded with vair, a tunic of broidery, and a
hood of such quaint and excellent fashion,
that all the female heretics of thy party shall
be converted, and say their prayers in Latin,
<i>in s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum</i>, to the utter demolition
of heresy!"</p>

<p>Genevieve's look of humble but expressive
rejection showed that this gorgeous proffer
was as little valued as the other. "In the
name of all the devils," said Semonville, "what
wouldst thou have, or what art thou?&mdash;for

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

woman thou canst not be, unmoved as thou art
by gold or gay attire. So may Marie aid me,
if thou be not some spirit of the woods or
fairy of the mountains. Look to it, De Verac;
she will ask of us anon a drop of blood, or a
lock of hair, or something that will merely
cost our perdition."&mdash;"Oh no, no!" cried
Genevieve, "mistrust me not: I will suddenly
point out your way, and ask but for my
meed," uncovering the venerable head of the
sleeping Pierre, "that when ye see a head
so white as this, or meet a lone and lowly
maiden like me, ye will do no despite to the
feeble, no dishonour to helpless woman."&mdash;"This 
passes!" said Semonville; the phrase
by which he always expressed his sense of
whatever exceeded the range of his faculties,
or the expansion of his sensibility.</p>

<p>"Fair nymph of the cave," said the more
gentle De Verac, "most polished sylvan, and
indeed faithful heretic, doubtless thou art the
daughter of a Catholic, and as such my orisons
shall be breathed for thee to our lady Venus
and saint Cupid."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

<p>"Breathe orisons for thyself the rather,"
said Semonville, to whom Genevieve had
indicated the way, and who had begun to
ascend, "for the way seems perilous, dark,
and rugged." De Verac followed, and his
voice was soon heard exclaiming, in plaintive
accents, as his drapery suffered in the
rude ascent&mdash;"Saints and angels, what a
rent! mercy, good crag&mdash;gently, thou villain
briar. By Heaven! the very rocks
here are turned heretic, and delight to pierce
the raiment of the faithful. I shall seem in
this ragged attire like an ape that had run
away from a gleeman, and ran wild through
the country with his scarlet slops dangling
about him."</p>

<p>"By the mass, I am stuck," quoth Semonville,
with a groan.</p>

<p>"Go up."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Come down."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Then let me pass thee, and gain the
entrance," said the more adroit Verac; and,

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

as he spoke, he sprang upwards, and at one
light and vigorous bound reached the aperture.&mdash;"What
dost thou shout for," cried
Semonville, "thou traitor knight and false brother-in-arms,
as if all the devils in hell were
in thy throat?"&mdash;"The Crusaders," shouted
Verac, forgetting their peril in the enthusiasm
caused by their gallant appearance&mdash;"the
Crusaders: they wind down the mountain
like a stream of gold. The great standard
of the cross nods and blazes to the noon-day
sun: wave all your banners, shout your battle-word,
couch your lances, noble knights,
valiant Crusaders&mdash;<i>Dieu et l'Eglise</i>."</p>

<p>Semonville had now toiled to the entrance,
and stood gazing on that gallant sight in
despair. "Now Christ them sain and save!"
he cried; "for living men they never will
win back to the towers of Courtenaye this
night:&mdash;now hie thee on, Verac, I will not be
slack to follow;&mdash;perchance we may warn&mdash;"&mdash;"We 
at least can perish with them," cried
Verac, bounding from the hill-top like a
falcon from his stoop.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

<p>Him followed the Sieur de Semonville,
wishing, at every stumble he made, De Montfort
and his mad counsel at the devil.</p>

<p>"Safe!" cried Genevieve, as she heard the
distant voices, and looked on her parent;
"safe! thou from death, and I, perchance,
from worse."</p>

<br/>

<p>MATTATHIAS and his party lost no time
in making their way to the presence of Count
Raymond. As they passed along, they were
loudly greeted by the men-at-arms, whose
fair array and increasing numbers augmented
their confidence, and whose greeting they
did not fail to repay by hints that they bore
tidings of much moment, such as justified
their utmost diligence of speed. They had
soon passed the vanguard, and were conducted
into the presence of the leader of the
host. Count Raymond of Toulouse was

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

seated on his war-steed, in complete armour
from head to foot, in expectation of immediate
action; he had neither caused his tent to
be pitched, nor even dismounted, since break
of day. He was surrounded by knights, all,
like him, armed for action, and by preachers
and pastors who were vehemently exhorting
him to go up against Ramoth-Gilead, and prevail
against it; and to whom he listened with
the constraint of one who, weary of the importunities
of a faction, still feels their influence
indispensable. His demeanour was noble and
martial; but when he spoke, his hesitating
voice, broken sentences, and undecided manner,
verified the fickle, pliant, and irresolute
character which historians have generally
ascribed to him. On his brow might be seen
traces of past calamities, of recent trials, and
of dangers momentarily expected; and he
looked, in truth, like one weary of playing the
arduous part assigned him in life, but sadly
resolved to sustain it with dignity to the
close. In early youth he had been a zealous
persecutor of the heretics, and sworn friend

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

to the brother of the Lord of Courtenaye,
the father of the lady Isabelle, their unchangeable
enemy: he afterwards became the
patron of the Albigeois, and then commenced
a scene of feudal hostility between the former
friends, which ended in the Lord of Courtenaye
surprising one of the castles of Count
Raymond, and slaughtering his wife and
infant children; for this he was rewarded by
the King of France with that vast accession
of territory which made the lady Isabelle
the richest as well as noblest heiress in the
land; and for this Count Raymond had
deeply sworn against the house of Courtenaye
a vengeance he had never yet been empowered
to wreak. The rest of his life partook
of that vacillating character which had
marked its commencement&mdash;now making the
most abject submissions to the Pope, and
now heading an army against the Crusaders&mdash;now
indignantly opposing the superstitions
and the domination of the Church of Rome,&mdash;now
revolted by the enthusiasm and daring
pretensions of the Albigeois:&mdash;such was Raymond

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

of Toulouse, firm alone in his purpose
of vengeance against the house of Courtenaye;
yet was he not without noble and
gentle qualities: he possessed valour, and had
often proved it; and he had a heart susceptible
of strong affections, for he had never
ceased to mourn for the wife of his bosom
and the children of his youth.</p>

<p>He received Mattathias and his party courteously,
and forgot not even to enquire after
the pastor Pierre, on the ineffaceable image
of whose simplicity and sanctity of character
his wearied thoughts reposed delightedly for
a moment; but when, in the progress of their
communication, they stated that by the intelligence
of their prisoners the lives of his
enemies were that day in his hand; and
Boanerges added (more than he knew) that
doubtless the Lord of Courtenaye and his
household were among that devoted band,
Count Raymond started in his seat and drew
his sword; and his horse rearing at the sudden
impulse of his rider, gave to the beholders
the idea of an equestrian statue bounding

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

into life by the power of magic. Count Raymond
rose upright in his stirrups; his eyes
flashed through the bars of his helmet, and,
waving his bright sword above his head, he
vowed to God not to quit the field that day
while a drop of the felon blood of De Courtenaye
remained unshed on the earth.</p>

<p>Waving brands and banners afloat, and
shouts that rent the air, hailed this declaration;
and none was louder in acclamation
than Mattathias, who dashed about his club
and yelled in an ecstasy of ferocious enthusiasm.
"Let us fall upon them!" he cried,
"and overtake them; neither turn again
till we have destroyed them: let their carcasses
be as the dust of the plain, and their
blood lie like dew on the valley."</p>

<p>"Bring forth my banner!" shouted Count
Raymond: "sound all your trumpets, and
lift your battle-cry like thunder among the
mountains!&mdash;<i>Dieu et l'Evangile!</i>&mdash;we will
rush upon them like the avalanche from the
precipice, and bury them where they stand!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

<p>"Hold! and hear me&mdash;even me!" exclaimed
Boanerges, grasping the reins of the
plunging and fiery steed&mdash;"hear me, I say,
that thou quench not the light of Israel."
And as he stood checking the horse and his
rider in their might, his head and feet naked,
his beard and hairy garments streaming in
the wind, while Raymond looked down on
him with impatience and doubt, he was no
mean image of an ancient prophet, a Micaiah,
or a Jeremiah, withstanding a king of
Israel as he made himself ready for battle.
"Hath not the Lord delivered them into
thy hand? and shall a hair of the head of
the meanest of my lord's servants fall to
the ground this day because of them? Tarry
till they are enclosed in the valley, where
they thought to slay the flock with the
shepherd: is it not a place of marshes and
springs of water, where the feet of their
horses shall stumble and be snared? And
when they lie before thee like a wild bull
in a net, then shoot out thine arrows and

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

consume them. Behold I, even I," he cried,
exalting his awful voice&mdash;"I say unto this
people, as Moses said unto the children of
Israel when the Egyptians pursued after
them, 'Stand still and see the salvation of
the Lord this day.' "</p>

<p>"Thy counsel pleaseth me well," said
Count Raymond, (as the last counsel he
heard was always sure to do). "I would
not," he added, muttering to himself, "that
felon lord had even a chance of flight to save
his forfeit life."</p>

<p>The situation of the ground was indeed
eminently favourable to the mode of warfare
suggested: hills above hills in endless
undulation, some shrouded in mist, some
sheltered by wood, afforded a thousand
points of concealment to the army of the
Albigeois, who had possessed themselves of
their summits. At the foot of that where
Count Raymond and his knights were posted,
was a narrow and rocky valley, intersected
with many streams, and closed at the
extremity by a perpendicular mass of rock.

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

Here the Albigeois hoped that the Crusaders
might direct their course, as the spot closely
resembled that where they had retreated the
preceding night;&mdash;nor were they deceived in
their expectations.</p>

<p>The band of knights, after riding for some
space diffusedly, as men in search of pastime,
began to approach the valley. With that
infatuation which seemed to rule all their
counsels and movements that day, they determined,
in the very wantonness of their
assured success, to feast under the shelter of
some rocks during the heat of the day, and
play at chess for the lives of the heretics,
like Benhadad of yore carousing in his pavilion
while his enemies were arraying their
battle against him. Tents and tables were
quickly spread by the attendants of the Abbot
of Normoutier and of the lady Isabelle; and
this delay gave time to the forces of Count
Raymond to possess themselves of every vantage-post
and point of assault, also to refresh
themselves, being weary as men who had
marched all night.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

<p>The mountains had cast their shadows
deep and broad into the valley, when the
Crusaders, after placing the lady Isabella
and her attendants on a wooded knoll,
and taking their leave with the joyous
gestures and shouts of men who were
parting to a feast, began to enter the valley.
A disposition had been effectually made
for their reception. Every summit of the
surrounding hills was covered with parties
of the Albigeois, screened by thickets or
clumps of trees; even the low sides of that
rocky valley were hung, wherever the shelter
of a crag was interposed, with archers
and slingers. A few of the fugitive Albigeois
were posted conspicuously on the
heights, as if they had just made their
escape, so far as to tempt pursuit, by appearing
to point out where the rest were
concealed.</p>

<p>The Crusaders rushed in a wild, tumultuous
train into the valley, descrying a few
fugitives on the rocks that enclosed it, and
believing the rest had shrunk amid its caverns

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

and cliffs; disregarding the fractured
rocks that formed its bed, and the streams
that divided them, and amid which their
horses were now up to their haunches, now
struggling for a precarious footing amid the
stony paths, till they had almost reached its
extremity, without discovering an individual,
and their progress was checked by that perpendicular
mass of rock, against which the
foremost rider almost dashed the chevron of
his barded steed before he perceived it was
an unscaleable barrier.</p>

<p>The Albigeois watched their prey in silence:
not an archer drew his bow&mdash;not a
slinger raised his arm&mdash;till the last knight
had rode into the defile. Then from hill,
and cliff, and crag&mdash;from every thicket, bush,
and almost bough&mdash;from front and rear&mdash;from
flank to flank&mdash;down rained the arrow-shower,
thicker than the mountain-rain; and
fast came mingled the sling-stones, like hail
in a mountain storm: and every shaft had
its mark&mdash;and every stone left its dint&mdash;and
the whole assault seemed dealt by invisible

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

hands; for not a shout, war-cry, or word
issued from the assailants.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, entangled and disarrayed,
still were undismayed, believing this a mere
desultory attack of the fugitives&mdash;the flight
of a few spent arrows. All, however, agreed
on the immediate expediency of quitting the
defile; and with a wild and derisive, but still
joyous shout, they attempted to regain the
entrance, and recover the height from which
they had descended. It was easier to quit
than to regain it. Their array broken&mdash;their
armour useless&mdash;their noble steeds galled,
wounded, tormented by the broken and
rocky ground; backing, facing, rearing, and
charging on each other&mdash;plumes rent&mdash;banners
torn&mdash;shield clashing with shield&mdash;housings
dyed in blood:&mdash;what a different group
did they present from that which, but a few
moments past, had rushed like a stream into
the valley, flooding its rocky banks to their
height with a rich tide of gorgeous chivalry!
Meanwhile the archers and slingers gave them
not a moment's respite; and when they had

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

at length struggled out of the valley, the
men-at-arms came rushing from the hills on
every side like mountain torrents.</p>

<p>"We are betrayed!" said Sir Paladour,
riding up to De Montfort: "there needs swift
counsel in this strait. Let some one be dispatched
to the Castle of Courtenaye, who
may show of our perilous estate, and summon
the men-at-arms to our aid without
delay."</p>

<p>"I will do your message full gladly," said
the Abbot of Normoutier, who rode up panting
with fatigue and fear. "In evil hour
did I ever ride with armed knights."</p>

<p>"Haste then, lord abbot," said Paladour:
"and as thou goest, I charge thee seek the
lady Isabelle, and convey her in safety to the
castle; and tell her that her knight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, I will be no bearer of love-token or
tidings," said the abbot, darting his spurs
into his steed: "is this a time for such
fooleries?"</p>

<p>"Craven priest!" said De Montfort, who
saw only this action: "is it thus thou flyest?

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

Here comes a churchman of another mettle,"
as the Bishop of Toulouse rode up to them.</p>

<p>"How now, my lord of Montfort?" cried
the bishop: "how deem you now of the
warning of last night? Do you still hold it a
shallow and inefficient toy? That 'Beware!'
had we marked it in time, had saved this
day the noblest blood in France from washing
the feet of base churls."</p>

<p>"My lord of Toulouse," said De Montfort,
"I would at this season that you would
thrust me through with your lance in earnest
rather than with your bitter taunts in jest; for
I perceive that I have this day brought evil
on the valiantest knights in Christendom;
whereof, I make a vow to Christ's Mother, it
repenteth me sore, so that my heart is nigh
to burst mine harness for shame and agony
of spirit."</p>

<p>"Now foul befall the tongue that reproaches
thee in an hour like this, noble
De Montfort!" said the generous Paladour;
"for surely it was the noble heat of a true

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

valour that lighted the flame that must consume
us this day. So may my soul see Paradise,
as it pants not to part in nobler company
than thine!" De Montfort wrung his hand in
proud agony, while a tear was seen to start
through the bars of his helmet. With that
Sir Aymer, his armour hacked and pierced,
his face disfigured by a frightful wound
which laid his jaw bare, flew past them
like a flash of lightning, borne away by his
steed, whom he could no longer rein, and who
was maddening with the pain of two arrows
that quivered in his bloody flank. As the
knight passed like a spectre, he shook his
hand, streaming with blood, at De Montfort,
and exclaiming, "Lo! the issue of your mad
counsel!" was borne from their sight.</p>

<p>This spectacle opened the mouths of the
Crusaders, who now came gathering round
De Montfort. "<i>Thou</i> the champion of the
Church!" cried one; "lo, into what plight
thou hast brought her champions!"&mdash;"Doff
thy helmet for shame," said another, "and

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

borrow a coxcomb."&mdash;"Is this the noble
chase," cried a third, "thou vauntedst of?
Methinks the quarry stands at fearful bay."</p>

<p>De Montfort, as they thus assailed him,
turned from one to the other with the fury
of a baited bull on the dogs that are tearing
him; then fiercely exclaiming, "I can bear
your reproaches, but not mine own!" he tore
the standard of the Cross from the bearer,
and rushing right forward on the advancing
body of the Albigeois, flung it with all his
force among them, and plunged desperately
after it. He sunk like a diver into the ocean;
and a fearful space elapsed before the plume
of his helmet was again visible.</p>

<p>"The standard of the Cross in peril!"
cried Paladour: "no, by good Heaven!
while an arm is left to win it. Who dreads
shame more than death, follow me!" The
spirit of the Crusaders rekindled as he spoke,
and all prepared to follow him.</p>

<p>Paladour paused as he put his lance in
rest, and addressing Amirald, "Dear knight
and brother," he said, "we haste to our last

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

field: valour itself is fruitless here. Should
it be my fate to fall first, stay not to bestride
me; but bear this token, dipped in my blood,
to the lady Isabelle, and say to her, he who
wore it prized it more than life, and felt
nought so bitter in death as the pang with
which he resigned it."</p>

<p>"Courage! valiant knight and brother!"
answered Amirald: "we shall yet see many
a field; and the peril of this day shall be a
theme for mirth in many a winter evening's
talk;&mdash;but should it fall otherwise, I will be
a loyal messenger to the lady of thy love."
As he spoke, a stone from a sling, as if aimed
by the arm of a giant, smote him on the
head, shattering the cheeks of his strong
helmet,&mdash;and he rolled in blood beneath his
horse's feet.</p>

<p>The flight of the Abbot of Normoutier,
with his ecclesiastical attendants, was not
unnoticed by a party who were stationed on
an adjacent eminence.</p>

<p>"Draw, Mattathias!&mdash;draw thy bow!"
cried Boanerges. "There speeds a missive

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

to the lord of Courtenaye; and if he reach
the castle ere the shadows fall, the children
of Belial will come up against us as the sand
of the sea-shore for multitude, and Israel
shall be swallowed up quick of his enemies
before the sun goes down."</p>

<p>"Send not an arrow after him," said the
milder Arnaud; "he is a churchman, and of
noble blood."</p>

<p>The strong arrow of Mattathias whistled
past him as he spoke; it passed through the
body of the abbot's cross-bearer, who fell
dead on the earth, the splendid ensign prostrated
beside him.</p>

<p>"Another!" cried Boanerges&mdash;"a fleeter,
and a surer. Lo where he flies with the rags
of Rome fluttering around him. Speed to
the South, false priest, and bid thy lord the
Pope send forth his vassals the kings of earth
to thine aid."</p>

<p>Another arrow flew from the ready bow of
Mattathias, who stamped and ground his
teeth for very rage as another of the attendants
lay levelled beside the abbot's rein; who

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

grasping the mane of his steed, and striking
his spurs to the rowel-head, galloped on without
a mortuary prayer for his followers' souls.</p>

<p>"When have I seen thee fail thus?" said
Boanerges. "Did not a man draw a bow at
a venture and smite the king of Israel through
the joints of the harness that he died?"</p>

<p>In the fury of disappointment Mattathias
bent his bow, and aimed an arrow at the air;
it flew not erring. At that moment the
maddening steed of Sir Aymer bore his rider
like lightning in the course the abbot had
taken. The shaft struck the shoulder of Sir
Aymer, whose horse fell dead under him as
he rode. The old knight sunk stunned on
the earth. With a feeble hand he unlaced
his battered helmet to gasp for air, and stretched
forth the other weakly, as if to feel for his
dead steed; the hand at last rested on the
bloody and heaving flank, and he withdrew
it. "Mad knights&mdash;a mad enterprise&mdash;a
mad world"&mdash;murmured Sir Aymer;&mdash;"and
to perish thus!&mdash;done to death by vile peasants:
it had been better&mdash;no matter <i>now</i>.&mdash;And

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

is this death?" he said, in a state between
delirium and that tendency to deep
reflection which the approach of death produces
in the hardest and lightest minds;&mdash;"the
huge mountains dance around me like
atoms; it is time for me to die when all
Nature is departing," A short trance overwhelmed
his senses; he recovered from it in
spasms of deadly sickness. "Would I could
shape a prayer, or weave my mind into a
saintly frame! It is wondrous how lightly
I deem now of that matter of controversy
for which I have been perilling life all my
days, and at length have lost it. I shall
soon know all&mdash;more than man can tell.
The battle wanes," he murmured, as his
senses failed;&mdash;"I hear no shout, no clashing
of arms. Is the field lost? Courage!"&mdash;his
voice growing fainter; "Sir Aymer, to
the rescue!&mdash;but it grows dark;&mdash;be sure
you wake me by dawn;&mdash;we must fight
again." A heavy trance fell on him as he
struggled to rise&mdash;in vain.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

<p>The desperate valour of the Crusaders had
"with many an inroad gored" the array of
the enemy, and spread such panic, that for
a space around them the field was for a moment
cleared&mdash;the men-at-arms retreating on
every side, and Count Raymond and his
knights, sure ultimately of the field, fighting
far aloof. The Bishop of Toulouse had from
the first conceived the hope of effecting his
escape from this desperate field, neither from
cowardice nor indifference to the event, but
from that ambitious selfishness that made
him rate his own safety at a price above that
of half his species; and he now attempted
to realize it by the exertion of a strength
and courage more than human: he clave his
way right onward, every stroke of his battle-axe
laying a foeman prostrate; while his
war-steed, well trained to bite with tooth and
trample with hoof, tore and trod out the small
remains of life in those who fell&mdash;so the rider
and horse passed on like the pale steed and
him who bestrides it, having commission to

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

slay, themselves invulnerable. But De Montfort
and Enguerrand de Vitry, his brother in
arms, dealt round their blows with blind and
reckless fury, making havoc of others without
thought of their own safety: now unhorsed
and fighting on foot&mdash;now mounted again and
discharging blows to right and left, the very
wind of whose impulse was enough to fell a
man of ordinary strength; their plumes and
pennons appearing in the stream of fight like
sails of gallant barks vainly contending with
the might of a thousand waves. But ever
Sir Paladour rode round the prostrate body
of Amirald, whom there was neither squire
nor page to bear from the field; and when
the foe, daunted, retired to a distance, he spurred
his steed, and, wheeling in short and fiery
circles, mowed down all within the reach of
his sword, and then returned to guard the
body of his friend, defending both with his
shield from the shower of arrows that fell
around them, and rested not.</p>

<p>It was towards night, the shadows of

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

which were deepened by the darkness of the
surrounding hills, when De Montfort and his
companion, wiping their brows with their
bloody gauntlets, sat down amid a heap
of maimed trunks and severed limbs, as two
wearied woodmen sit down after the toils of
the day amid the trunks and branches of a
forest of felled trees, and looked round them
to spy for succour while light yet remained
in the sky. The towering form of the Bishop
of Toulouse was still seen dimly on the verge
of battle smiting with unabated force, but far
distant from them. They saw Paladour also;
but, could even shout or bugle-sound reach
him where he stood, they knew him too strict
an observer of the laws of chivalry to quit
the body of his brother in arms. Of the
other knights, all were slain, or had deserted
the field. They saw not where De Verac
and Semonville, who had easily found steeds
and armour on the field, still shouted their
war-cry, though too late for all but danger
and death, and still did the devoir of gallant

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

knights in such guise as might well redeem
the foppery of the one and the sullen dulness
of the other. There was a form they had
beheld before, but knew not who he might
be: it was a knight in black armour, who
had late in the battle joined them and done
valiant deeds;&mdash;but he seemed to fly from
one part of the field to the other with a
speed that prevented their either demanding
his name or deriving hope from his succour.
The arrows now fell in a slackened shower,
the shouts came more distant, and this singular
figure became more conspicuous from
the increased desertion of the field.</p>

<p>"There come no succours from the Castle
of Courtenaye," said Enguerrand De Vitry,
turning his dim eyes sadly westward:&mdash;"the
lord abbot hath been slain or taken, and we
are left alone&mdash;to perish. The shadows
lengthen as our term of hope and life waxes
shorter."</p>

<p>"Enguerrand De Vitry," said De Montfort,
"thou knowest I am not superstitious;

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

and how I have borne me this day in the
bloodiest field I think knight hath ever fought
in, thou knowest well, and wilt report at
need; but, I tell thee, I cannot shake off the
heavy presage that weighs down my spirits
when I behold yon knight in black armour;
I deem him of no earthly frame or mould.
Be confirmed that our death's-day is come,
and that he comes a messenger from Heaven
or hell to tell us so."</p>

<p>Enguerrand endeavoured to cheer his friend;
but at this moment the black knight rode by
them like a storm, his horse's feet scattering
splintered armour and lopped limbs like leaves
in a gale; and he shouted, "Linger ye here
while your task is unfinished,&mdash;your destiny
unfulfilled? Follow!&mdash;follow me!"</p>

<p>De Montfort braced his helmet and grasped
his lance once more at these words; and
his companion could see by the twilight that
the flushed and sanguine hue of his countenance
was exchanged for an ashy paleness:
he had but short time for observation.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

<p>Count Raymond and his knights came
rushing from the hills like a flood, and surrounded
them on every side. Enguerrand
was the first to fall, and De Montfort after
a few desperate blows, every one of which
cost the life of an assailant, was struck from
his horse, under whose feet he fell so trampled
and defaced, that the Albigeois vainly
sought to recognize his body among the slain.</p>

<p>Sir Paladour remained last on the field; for
De Verac and Semonville, deeming all lost,
had taken flight in hope of succouring the
lady Isabelle. He looked around him, and
saw no one living on the field but himself.
The short twilight was past; the bright
stars came forth above his head; the mountains,
with their sharp and ridged lines, stood
strongly defined in the deep dark blue of an
autumnal sky. The night-breeze that fanned
his burning forehead congealed the blood on
his wounds, whose pain became intense; and
the sound of a thousand streams, that seemed
to his fevered perceptions flowing near him,
excited a sensation of thirst almost intolerable.

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

It was at this moment that his ear was
struck by a singular sound,&mdash;it was the
voice of an idiot, a fool of the Lord of Courtenaye,
less than half-witted, but shrewd,
gibing, and affectionate withal, whom neither
persuasions nor blows could drive back from
accompanying the Crusaders that disastrous
day. When all was over, he sat him down
on the summit of an eminence, and began
singing a kind of triumphant song with the
most lugubrious aspect imaginable: the words
were&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">De Montfort shall come from the hills above<br/>

And carry all before him&mdash;</p>

<p>This song of an idiot, heard amid the
awful stillness of departed battle, heard where
the valiant, the mighty, the eloquent, and
the beautiful were dumb, had a strange
meaning and power; but Paladour was no
longer able to feel; a deep stupor began to
creep over him. The last sensation he had
was that of trying to fall so as to hide the
body of Amirald, and even in death protect
it from spoliation and indignity. The precaution

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

failed; the soiled and broken armour
of Paladour offered no temptation to the
plunderers, who now began to traverse the
field, while Amirald's, who had fallen early
in the strife, was still fresh and resplendent.
The senseless bodies of the youths were soon
torn asunder. The idiot died that night,
and his dying song vibrated on the ear of Sir
Aymer, who was awaking from his deep and
death-like trance. "Ha, ha," said the old
knight, rousing with his constitutional laugh,
"there be greater fools here than thou.&mdash;I
marvel that my squire comes not to arm me.
God's mother! have I slept all this while,
and never drew brand while there was battle
so near me? Methought I rode with Crusaders
in my dream.&mdash;How cold the morning
sun is!" he muttered shivering, as the moon
rose in pale and midnight glory over that
bloody field, and the echoes of the hills resounded
with the hymns of the triumphant
Albigeois. These "watchers of the night"
seemed to take up their song of rejoicing
along with the host of Heaven, with those

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

who have "neither speech nor language, but
whose voices are heard among them;" like
them they lifted up their voices all that night
from hill to hill; and while the rich sounds
rolled into the dim and stilled valleys, a pure
heart and ear might almost have deemed them
the faint and far-descending echo of the inaudible
harmonies of heaven.</p>

<p>THE lady Isabelle with her attendants
had been placed by the Crusaders on an
eminence when they set out on that disastrous
enterprise, and she had waved her hand and
scarf to them as long as Sir Paladour remained
in sight. Though compelled to accompany
them, she shrank from the sight of
slaughter, and ordered her attendants to
spread her awning or tent on the side of the
hill opposite that by which the knights had
descended.</p>

<p>Here reclined on cushions, which her damsels
spread on the grass, she lay listening to
tales of the Crusaders, among whose praises
the maidens who knew how to soothe their

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

lady's ear, forgot not to reckon highest those
of Sir Paladour. Her only attendants were
Marguerite, Blanche, and Germonda, two
pages, the driver of her horse-litter, and the
Monk of Montcalm, whom the Abbot of
Normoutier, when inflamed with wine, had
vainly pressed to join in the assault. The
dame and damsels were stretched at the feet
of the lady; the pages and driver were ever
and anon climbing to the summit of the hill,
to look forth on the field; the Monk of
Montcalm stood apart and told his beads till
even-song, and then knelt and prayed fervently
at a distance. Thus, beneath the silken
awning there was a rich foreground of luxurious
and reposing beauty; the picturesque
habits and eager gestures of the young pages
gave character and life to the group; and
the thin ascetic form, the pale uplifted eye,
and dark garments of the monk, as he knelt
beneath the branches of a mighty pine, lent
a dark and solemn contrast to the picture.</p>

<p>Evening came on, and the lady at length
consented to the petition of her damsels, and

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

dismissed Germonda to the summit of the hill
for tidings which the pages had failed to bring.
It has been already told how all communication
had been cut off by Count Raymond's army.
It is, therefore, no marvel that the first intimation
of her danger the lady received was
from the cries of her attendant. "Holy heaven!"
she cried, "the heretics are increased to
tenfold their former number. They are pouring
from hill and mountain like a flood."&mdash;"Thine
eyes are bedazzled by the setting sun,"
said the lady, half raising herself from her
cushions of silk; "screen them with thy hand,
and tell me what thou seest."&mdash;"I see thousands
and tens of thousands pouring down on
the Crusaders."&mdash;"And were they hundreds
of thousands," said the noble maiden, "they
will cower like a flock of sparrows when the
falcon is abroad. Is not Sir Paladour in the
field? How fight they, and what arms do
they bear?"&mdash;"Alas," said the damsel, wringing
her hands, "they fight not with clubs and
arrows, but with spear and sword, like armed
men; and, as I may guess by plume and banner,

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

no churl or peasant leads them on, but
nobles and knights expert in war."</p>

<p>"Thou ravest," said the lady. "Would
they not ere this have sent us tidings, if aught
thou tellest of had befallen? Look forth
again."&mdash;"There comes one who seems to
bear tidings by his speed," said the damsel.</p>

<p>The lady Isabelle started from her seat, and
leant over the brow of the hill, straining neck
and eye to catch a view of the approaching
horseman, from whose bearing and speed she
and her companions drew such auguries as
the distance and the windings of the hills
allowed of. The horseman was the Abbot
of Normoutier, who had escaped the arrows
of Mattathias, and lain perdu amid a thicket
till he deemed he could reach the towers of
Courtenaye in safety.</p>

<p>"It is the Abbot of Normoutier who rides
with good tidings," said Germonda.&mdash;"He
rides not like the bearer of good tidings," said
Blanche; "he seems rather the worn and
wearied courier of a discomfited host and a
disastrous day."&mdash;"What tidings, lord abbot?"

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

all exclaimed, as he checked his rein on the
summit of the hill. "To flight!&mdash;to flight!"
gasped the abbot;&mdash;"fly, lady!&mdash;all is lost!
the hope of chivalry and of Christendom hath
perished on yonder field. One hundred and
fifty thousand Albigeois&mdash;I counted them
every man&mdash;have either dropt from the clouds
or ascended from hell, and tossed us about
like so many tennis-balls over these cursed
hills. Valour was a mock, and stout-dealing
but child's-play against such numbers. If
ever there was a lion in a cope and cowl, as
such did I bear me this day; but all would
not serve. One Sir Paladour would have had
me quit the field to bear a love-message, or
some such idle toy; but, I promise you, when
I laid hand to brand, my fingers forgot it had
ever a sheath."&mdash;"Where fights Sir Paladour?"
cried Isabelle, starting as from a
trance at the name;&mdash;"where is De Montfort?&mdash;where
Sir Aymer?&mdash;what are Verac
and Semonville doing?&mdash;where is the noble
cavalcade that heralded me at noon to this
fatal spot?&mdash;where is Paladour?&mdash;oh that

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

he had come to my aid instead!"&mdash;&mdash;"Alas,
good youth!" said the abbot;&mdash;"he bore
himself bravely, Very indifferently brave;&mdash;then
a sort of clubs came clattering on his
helmet, and, as near as I could guess, some
hundred arrows or so pieced through his
mail where we stood together; he said no
more but 'Commend me to the lady Isabelle;'
and there he lay: I bestrode him&mdash;but what
availed mortal valour?"&mdash;"What indeed!"
said the lady Isabelle, with a sudden and
fearful calmness of tone&mdash;"what availed it
when Paladour fell?"</p>

<p>"Lady, betake thee to flight," said the
abbot, terrified at her looks;&mdash;"if thou win
the towers of Courtenaye ere night, thou
wilt be glad woman<sup id="ref025"><a href="#en025">25</a></sup>; for the soul of Sir
Paladour, trust me, it is half-way to purgatory
ere this, and that it halt not there
long will be owing to the prayers I put up
as I rode."</p>

<p>"Hie, noble lady, at thy utmost speed!"

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

cried the Monk of Montcalm; "the heretics
prevail; the cry of '<i>Dieu et l'Evangile!</i>'
comes loud on the wind."&mdash;(The pages and
the maidens gathered round the lady.)&mdash;"Men
say the devil, in the likeness of Count
Raymond, is in the field," quoth the abbot;
"for myself, I value him not a straw; I bear
holy relics about me." As he spoke, the
horses were taken from the litter, and the
lady Isabelle placed on the fleetest by her
pages. "Ride up&mdash;ride up!" said the abbot;
"ride up, damsels, by your lady's rein; methinks
she looks wondrous wan, and skills
not to manage her palfrey."&mdash;"Dear lady
and mistress!" cried the attendants, "what
ail you, and wherefore do you not betake
yourself to flight?"&mdash;"Nothing," said the
lady;&mdash;"I ail nothing:" and a fearful stupor
pervading her, she added faintly, "Lead me&mdash;guide
me even where you will;&mdash;I know
not what I say&mdash;I reck not whither I go."</p>

<p>At this moment the sharp whizzing of a
score of arrows was heard at the foot of the
hill, and the shout of '<i>Dieu et l'Evangile!</i>'

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

made the abbot set spurs to his horse, and
the lady's attendants to hurry her off with
what speed they might. Germonda and
Blanche, springing on their steeds, were not
slow to follow; while dame Marguerite, who
alone had been neglected in this hurried
arrangement, with a spring and talons like
those of a wild cat, darted herself, <i>en croupe</i>,
behind the Abbot of Normoutier as he galloped
along, and clung close as a vice to the
body of horse and rider. The consternation
of the abbot, who imagined that the whole
host of Count Raymond were seizing on him,
<i>au derriere</i>, was beyond all power of description.
Demosthenes himself never shouted
<i>ζωγρει</i> in a louder voice than the abbot continued
to exclaim, galloping all the while,
"Hold me to ransom!&mdash;a bishop's ransom!&mdash;a
king's!&mdash;it shall be paid;&mdash;three thousand
crowns of gold&mdash;the saints shall melt&mdash;altar-plate,
pix, and chalice&mdash;cope, ring, and mitre&mdash;abbey-lands
and costly missals&mdash;six thousand
crowns!&mdash;on the faith of a churchman&mdash;eight
thousand!&mdash;gripe not so hard! the

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

crowns are to be wrung out of my purse, not
mine intestines."&mdash;"Does the lord abbot deem
so hardly of a fair friend?" said the mincing
voice of dame Marguerite.&mdash;"Fair friend!"
quoth the abbot, then first venturing a glance
over his shoulder: "fair fiend!&mdash;fair succuba!&mdash;fair
night-mare!&mdash;why clingest thou to me,
vile hag? An' I had not thought thou wast
a host of devils risen from hell to seize me,
I am no true churchman!"&mdash;"Uncourtly
abbot!" said the lady.&mdash;"I tell thee," said
the abbot, interrupting her, "thou or I must
quit hold; and when it comes to a question
between me and thee in a case of mortal
peril, it demands no skill to find the issue: I
tell thee, I will stick by my steed."&mdash;"And I
will stick by thee," said the dame, fastening
her fangs closer than ever. This movement
renewed the abbot's delirium, and he shouted
aloud: "Holy Saints! save and succour me!
but this time&mdash;this time only, I entreat!&mdash;and
if ever I draw brand for Holy Church
again, take me at my word, and let me be
spitted on the arrow of an Albigeois, and

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

served up for Count Raymond's cannibal
supper." So saying, he struck spurs more
deeply into his steed, who, mad with his
double burthen, galloped on furiously; while
dame Marguerite, at each succussion, rose
like a tennis-ball from the croup, and sunk
again with a motion, of which the celerity
bore no imaginable proportion to the grace or
satisfaction of the performer. In the end, the
gouvernante's pertinacity proved more than a
match for the abbot's horsemanship: he was
left prostrate on the earth; while the dame
galloped on <i>seule</i>, with the air of a "damsel
met in forest wide by knight of Logres
or of Lyones."</p>

<p>The abbot, sore dismayed and much aggrieved
in all his members, was encountered
about an hour after by the Monk of Montcalm,
who was pacing his way to the Castle
of Courtenaye. "Alas! and art thou here,
lord abbot?" said the monk.&mdash;"Alas, and I
am!" quoth the abbot. "I trusted thou hadst
been at the Castle of Courtenaye by this."&mdash;"So
I had trusted myself," said the abbot;

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

"but thou seest how matters are. A certain
fury, or goblin, sent by those heretics, who
deal with the devil, and who owed me double
spite for the valour I had shewed in the
Church's cause to-day, hath maltreated me as
thou seest, and rode away on my horse in a
flame of fire. I am bereft of the use of my
limbs, and am clean spoiled for farther deeds
of chivalry."&mdash;"Nay, it is not so ill with thee,
I trust," said the monk, raising him; and in
the effort the abbot appeared suddenly restored
to the use of all his limbs, and eagerly
proposed seeking the castle with the aid of the
monk's arm. "And how," said he, gazing&mdash;"how
didst thou escape, when churchmen
were crippled of their limbs, and knights and
nobles laid low, by the hands of peasants?&mdash;What
spell dost thou bear about thee?"&mdash;"None,"
said the monk, "but our Lady's
grace, and a conscience void of offence. I
felt that the most ruthless of those called
heretics would not murder one who had been
a messenger of peace betwixt you both, and
whose spoil would not prove a peasant's ransom.

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

I had nought to lose on earth: in
Heaven my hope and hold was, above their
reach or thought."&mdash;"I tell thee what," said
the abbot, as he paced softly, leaning on the
monk's arm, towards the castle, "all that
thou talkest of&mdash;thy not being summoned to
heavy and high trials, like me, is merely owing
to thy lack of faith&mdash;'<i>Quos Deus amat,
eos castigat</i>.' Hadst thou been favoured like
me with abundance of that precious grace,
thou wouldst have had like me abundant
exercise for it; wherefore I counsel thee, out
of mere Christian love and brotherly zeal, to
redouble thy macerations and abstinences,
thy penances and pilgrimages, and, moreover,
abate and chastise thy exorbitant spiritual
pride, and so thou mayest be favoured with
the chance of a crown of martyrdom from
the hand of some heretic, which I, thy superior
in rank and sanctity, was so near receiving
this day." The humble monk listened,
and then suggested the necessity of expedition
in their progress. "I tell thee," quoth
the abbot, "when I am occupied in giving

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

ghostly counsel, I would not wag a jot the
faster, were the bell ringing for matins."&mdash;"But
I hear horsemen on the path behind
us."&mdash;"That alters the case," said the abbot.
"As thou hast no dread of Crusader or heretic,
encounter them boldly; do thy devoir,
as I urged the gallant knights to-day; while
I esconce me behind this thicket, to assist
thee with my prayers, which, having forgot
in my overmuch valour to-day, it were find
sin to neglect any longer, when such opportunity
offers." The patient monk stood
confounded when the horsemen, riding up,
proved to be two wearied and wounded
knights. They were Verac and Semonville,
who, on horses they had caught, were seeking
their way to the castle. The monk
proffered to guide them; and the abbot, as
soon as he recognized their voices, sprang
nimbly on the croup of the foremost, and,
himself taking the guidance of the party,
they made what speed they could for the
towers of Courtenaye.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the lady Isabelle and her

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

attendants had ridden fast and far, dame
Marguerite ramping and galloping in the van,
like Burger's Leonora, till a clump of chesnuts
stopped their course; from which a knight in
black armour rode forth with courteous demeanour,
and, accosting the lady Isabelle,
prayed her to pause. "I bear a message
from Sir Paladour," he said, "to the Lady of
Courtenaye, if she rides in this company."</p>

<p>"Sir knight," said the lady, suddenly rousing
herself, "say you that Sir Paladour lives,
and that you are the bearer of tidings from
him?"</p>

<p>"True, noble lady: if you will vouchsafe
me the hearing."</p>

<p>The lady Isabelle reined up her palfrey;
and the noble air of graceful confidence with
which she prepared to listen might have disarmed
the heart of mal-intent and treachery
itself.</p>

<p>"Mark how she hears the deeds of that
Sir Paramount!" quoth Germonda.&mdash;"See
how she bends in courtesy to the message
the stranger bears," replied Blanche.&mdash;"My

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

velvet tire to a heretic's woollen hood,
if this Paladour yet quarters not his new-won
arms with the noblest heiress in France."&mdash;"Nothing
but the gemmed bracelet from
her wrist as the guerdon of such tidings."&mdash;"Methinks
he bows in return with an uncourtly
favour," said her companion.</p>

<p>The nice ear and fine tact of the lady Isabelle
had discovered in the stranger-knight
some touches of a rude unnurtured manner:
he was profuse of polished language, but
seemed to be speaking a conned lesson. But
his credentials were not to be disputed: he
bore the ring and dagger of Sir Paladour as
his tokens. He assured the lady that Sir
Paladour lived, though sorely wounded; and
sent to implore her, by those pledges, to escape
by a secret path (known only to the dark
knight) from the pursuit of the Albigeois,
who, flushed by victory, were in full chase of
the noble heiress of Courtenaye, whom at
best they would hold at a queen's ransom,
and who might, perchance, dread worse dealing
at their hands.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

<p>The message was so rapidly delivered,
that the lady Isabelle could scarce comprehend
her danger. She hesitated. "Lose
not a moment!" said the black knight, seizing
her rein. "For Sir Paladour's sake!&mdash;for
your own!&mdash;amid the wounds that fester
in his breast to-night, there is not one so
agonizing as his fear for thy safety."</p>

<p>"The castle is near," said the lady, pointing
to its towers.</p>

<p>"But the cursed heretics have intercepted
that course!" cried the knight; "and think,
lady, what may be thy fate if thou fall into
their hands! I know the safe and secret
path by which thou mayest win the castle,
without risk from thy pursuers; it lies down
this glen;&mdash;suffer me to guide thee." And,
without waiting for permission, he seized the
lady's rein.</p>

<p>They galloped down a steep and rocky
descent, the strong arm of the knight sometimes
grasping the rein, sometimes holding the
lady on her seat: the damsels followed. At
the bottom of this descent was a thick grove

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

of firs. The short twilight was over, and
the moon, now risen, threw her cold white
gleams on the rock they were descending;
while the dark dell at the bottom received
and returned not a gleam, and the trees and
their foliage seemed to form one mass of
solid and impenetrable darkness. The lady
paused. "I am safe in the guidance of Sir
Paladour's friend?" said she, trembling. The
dark knight made no answer but by seizing
therein of the lady's steed, whom he dragged
at full gallop till they entered the dell; then
applying a bugle-horn to his lips, and winding
a low and cautious blast, many men in
vizards and dark houplands appeared from
among the trees and surrounded the party.
The dark knight, seizing the lady Isabella,
placed her on his own steed. She neither
shrieked nor resisted, for she had swooned.
Her damsels uttered loud outcries; but these
were soon hushed by the menaces of the band,
and by the rapidity with which they were
hurried on, and which soon deprived them
of all power of expostulation. Dame Marguerite

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

was treated with less ceremony; the
fellow to whose care she was committed flinging
her across his horse, and galloping at
speed to keep up with the party that preceded
him, till the domains of Courtenaye were left
far behind, and the drear prospect of a tract
of barren sands and the waves of the Mediterranean
beating on them, bounded the view
of the fugitives by dawn.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE first tidings of the defeat of the Crusaders
were borne to the Castle of Courtenaye
the following night by Sir Aymer. The lord
of the castle was in his hall inspecting the
splendid banquet, the warders on the tower
strained their eyes through the twilight to
catch a glimpse of the expected messenger,
and the men-at-arms and military retainers,
fretting like caged lions, strode about the
courts wild for intelligence, and swearing,
had they been there, the news had not slumbered
on its way. The slow and solitary
tramp of a single rider was heard. The
drawbridge went down with clash and jar;

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

and beneath the raised portcullis, the fierce
visages and warlike garb of the men-at-arms,
flared out in the torch-light, borne by the
crowding attendants. "What tidings?" cried
a hundred voices. A single knight rode in like
a spectre through the court till he reached the
hall; there dismounting and clanking up to
the dais, he sat moodily down, and flinging
back his helmet, and disclosing his ghastly
wounds, he answered, "Such as ye see, such
as ye might expect. Sixty knights to charge
six thousand men with that devil from hell,
Raymond of Toulouse, at their head. Said I
not so? What tidings?&mdash;Such as this torn
jaw and bloody harness tell. De Montfort is
down&mdash;Enguerrand de Vitry by this bestrides
a corse&mdash;the Crusaders are cut off to a man.
Amirald's lance will never more be laid in rest,
and, by God's mother! all is stark nought.&mdash;You
have my tidings. Now let me have a chirurgeon,
or a stoup of wine, I care not how soon&mdash;the
wine first, ere the rascal leech forbid it,
and to qualify as it were the mountain dew
I have been fain to swallow to-night, sorely

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

to the prejudice of mine orthodox lungs, which
never imbibed such a heretic draught before."</p>

<p>As the knight thus harangued, casting his
eyes round the deserted hall, he inquired for
its lord. On the first intelligence of the defeat
of the Crusaders, the Lord of Courtenaye
in an agony of terror had secured himself in
the highest tower of the castle, there surrounded
by Thibaud, the astrologer, and a few
menials. He gave and revoked orders, consulted
and cursed the stars in the same breath,
and finally would have shut the gates of the
castle against the Crusaders, had it not been
hinted to him that the first intimation of such
hostility or repugnance might be fatal to himself.
The repeated sounds of the horn, while
the knight's wounds were dressing in a chamber
apart, gave intimation of the escape and
arrival of more of the Crusaders, and no remonstrances
could prevent Sir Aymer from
hastening to join them. "I tell thee," said
he to the man of medicine, who represented
the danger of farther exertion,&mdash;"I tell thee
most learned leech, thou hast turned me into a

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

muming with thy salves and bandages already,
and if I may not eat and drink, inter me quick
at once&mdash;preach not to me of cullises and confections!&mdash;go
cure chickens of the pip, and
compound a charm for the tooth-ache, and
find out the natural cause why we are cold
when it freezes; but think not to cure me with
aught but a draught of Malvoisie, and a stirring
tale to wash it down,&mdash;that's your true
<i>probatum est</i>." On descending to the hall,
however, he found only the Abbot of Normoutier.
"How, lord abbot," he cried, "are
we the only survivors of this mad adventure?"&mdash;"There
be also the Bishop of Toulouse, and
the knights De Verac, Semonville, and Sir
Paladour; but the bishop hath called for writing
materials and shut himself up with a priest,
meaning to send missives to Rome without
delay."</p>

<p>"Then would I not stand in his report as
De Montfort will, for the title of champion of
the church," said the knight.</p>

<p>"De Verac and Semonville have hied them
to their chambers"&mdash;"I conceive thee&mdash;where

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

the one will find solace in counting over his
feathers and fringes, and the other in cuffing
his lacquey till his valour be redeemed in his
own opinion."</p>

<p>"Marry, thou guessest well; they are confirmed
in their resolve to pursue and redeem
the lady Isabelle, who hath disappeared none
knows how, save that the story that a spirit
must be her bridegroom, hath gained much
ground&mdash;I heard it long ago; but De Verac
hath, in truth, returned to provide fair array
on the quest, and Semonville to cuff his squire
for misleading on their way:&mdash;for Sir Paladour
(who rode here for aid to bear the body of
Amirald from the field,)&mdash;when he heard that
the lady Isabelle hath not yet been heard of,
he made a vow that he would never return
without tidings of her, and rode sadly away,
scorning counsel or aidance, though such was
the plight of steed and rider that I fear he
will not lightly redeem his pledge."</p>

<p>"Now, by the faith and fame of chivalry,
done like an enamoured knight and a valorous!&mdash;And
the lady Isabelle not heard of?&mdash;this

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

storm blows from all points. Ah, gallant
Paladour! thou hadst not gone alone on thy
perilous quest, had Amirald's foot held the
stirrup still&mdash;Amirald," cried the veteran, his
stout heart melting within him, and the tears
falling fast over his hoary beard&mdash;"Amirald,
brave and gentle boy, whose heart was as bold
as thy favour was gracious, a blight came on
a goodly spring when thou wast laid low&mdash;these
white hairs had been a fitter crop for
the grave than thy bright locks of youth&mdash;would
God I had died for thee, Amirald,
my son!"</p>

<p>"Worthy knight," said the abbot, "you
have indeed cause to mourn for that youth&mdash;and
the rather, as at your advanced years the
loss must needs be irreparable; youth soon
supplies its losses, but this misfortune hath
befallen you when your body is enfeebled,
your intellectuals weakened, your valour declining,
your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beshrew thee for a comforter," interrupted
the knight. "What, talkest thou of age? all
mine ancestors were grey in their youth, and

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

your whoreson rheum is a villainous decayer
of the teeth, and wrinkles come a man knows
not how or why; but, bating these, what trace,
what feature, what semblable proof of age
canst thou quote in me? But I see how it is
even with thee, thy understanding must be
marvellously beclouded, or thou hadst not
talked so long without a remnant of false
Latin vilely applied. But what uproar have
we here? does Hell keep holiday, or are the
Albigeois broke loose again?"</p>

<p>The tumult arose from a difference between
Verac and Semonville, who were each carrying
matters to an extremity that threatened
a dissolution of their brothership in arms, as
hasty and motiveless as its commencement.
On the intelligence that Sir Paladour had set
forth, spite of his wounds and weariness, in
quest of the lady Isabelle, they had instantly
adopted a similar resolution, being no wise
deficient in courage, or in that amorous devotion
which was the character of the age; nor
in that spirit of emulation with a distinguished
rival, which is the character of every age.

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

But though they agreed in their object, they
differed widely about the means of pursuing
it; Semonville insisting on setting forth instantly,
after first giving due correction to
Paladour's squire, who had led them astray
on their path&mdash;and Verac, with equal tenacity,
refusing to join in the expedition till
certain costly garments he possessed, were
well secured in his mails and sure to follow
him as he ventured forth in quest of the
lady&mdash;"for," as he internally said, "the fairest
lady on earth may take her chance for
thraldom or liberation ere I appear before her
but in attire worthy of myself." The noise
of their conflict had already reached the hall,
where Sir Aymer and the Abbot of Normoutier,
the former in spite of medical prohibition,
and the latter in defiance of ecclesiastical
rule, were, amid their differences on other
points, completely agreed in draining every
flagon on the board, when the parties rushed
before them, with an appeal for their counsel&mdash;Semonville
dragging in the false guide (as
he termed him), and Verac calling all the

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

saints to witness, that never was lady delivered
to her own satisfaction, to that of her
champion and of Christendom at large, unless
he were suitably arrayed for the enterprise.</p>

<p>The decision of those to whom they appealed,
was suspended by the sound of a
numerous train, unannounced by horn, or
herald, approaching the hall. This party had
arrived late, no trumpet was blown in their
van, no name or style proclaimed by harbinger;
the warders hesitated whether to
lower the drawbridge, and demanded whom
they were to admit? "The corse of Simon
de Montfort," exclaimed a female voice;
"lower your drawbridge on the instant&mdash;the
palace of King Philip might be proud to
receive such guest." The drawbridge was
lowered, the train admitted, and the Countess
de Montfort, who had arrived too late for the
conflict of the Crusaders, but had instantly
set forth to seek for her husband's body, appeared
preceding the litter on which the
body of the champion of the Church, "gored
with many a ghastly wound," was extended.&mdash;Verac

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

and Semonville, as she entered the
hall, compromised their dispute, and whispered
apart. Sir Aymer and the abbot rose
(the latter with some difficulty) at the presence
of the noble, martial-minded widow. She
bowed not, nor looked towards them, while
they stood like statues. The body of Count
Simon de Montfort was extended on a table.
The lady approached, and in deep and speechless
anguish flung her arms on his chest&mdash;a
faint respiration followed&mdash;Jane de Montfort
started from the body in triumph&mdash;"He lives&mdash;he
lives," she cried; "go, bear the tidings
to the Bishop of Toulouse, (I know his purpose
well)&mdash;tell him that De Montfort lives&mdash;the
champion of the Church! and that his
wife will wear corslet and poise brand herself,
ere prince or prelate rob him of his title."</p>

<p>COUNT Raymond was not intoxicated with
a victory, which he perceived to be owing
solely to the temerity of the vanquished. He
was aware also, that the first intelligence of
the defeat of De Montfort and the knights
would bring down the formidable force of
their men-at-arms on the Albigeois&mdash;a force
which, even without efficient leaders or skilful
arrangement, threatened peril to the victorious
party. Rejecting, therefore, the furious
counsel of Mattathias, Boanerges, and their
party, who, inebriated with success, urged

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

him to pursue his course even to the uttermost,
and half promised that the sun should
stand still on Gibeah, and the moon in the
valley of Ajalon, till the Lord had given his
enemies into his hand, he issued his orders
that the whole band should set forth towards
the kingdom of Arragon, on his way towards
which, he was in hopes of being joined by
powerful succour from Toulouse.</p>

<p>This order was sufficiently grievous to the
men-at-arms, who had by forced marches and
desperate efforts, arrived at their present post;
and still more so to those they came to relieve.
But both were sustained and recruited by a
day's interval of refreshment and repose; by
the confidence of victory; and by that hope
of ultimate success, which, extravagant in
itself, had that day received appropriate
nurture from an event that completely defeated
sober calculation, and laid the flower
of chivalry at the mercy of the clubs and
arrows of a scorned and excommunicated
peasantry.</p>

<p>The submission to this order, though

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

strictly enforced, was marked with more
humanity than the manners of that age generally
admitted; the feeble and aged were to
depart first, under a strong escort, and seek
shelter with their protectors among the
mountains; while the army of Count Raymond
covered their retreat, and presented at
the same time a formidable front to the enemy,
whose pursuit was momently expected.</p>

<p>Among the first to submit to this order,
though the least able to obey it, were Pierre
and his grand-daughter. Their progress lay
through the field of the late slaughter, still
strewed with the bodies of the Crusaders;
and the diversity of the ground, every where
broken by rocks, shaded by thickets, or intersected
by streams, only rendered the
spectacle of the carnage more terrible. To
view a vast plain heaped with corses, to see
at once this ocean of the dead, and prepare
to wade through, is, perhaps, a less fearful
object to the imagination, than to totter along
amid darkness and doubt, uncertain whether
the next cavern does not echo the groan of

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

the dying, whether the shade of trees you
approach does not wave over the dead, or
the stream you tremble to cross is not tinged
with the blood of the corse that lies pale and
stark on its margin. Such were the feelings
of Genevieve as, shuddering, she entered this
valley of the shadow of death. Pierre, unable
to walk, was supported in the arms of
two of his flock; Genevieve followed, upheld
by Amand, who trembled more than
she did, but from a different cause. The
path lay in darkness before them, but, as they
passed a thick cluster of chesnuts, a light
suddenly burst on their eyes. Count Raymond
stood there in complete armour, dismissing
his brief war-council; the torches
held by his pages, gleamed alternately on the
dark foliage of the trees and his polished
cuirass and cuisses that shone like silver:
round him stood dark forms, and darker
visages, tinted by the torch-light, with
the glow of fierce passions, and the glare
of stern purposes; contrasting the pale
and timid group that advanced trembling

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

at their intrusion, though commanded by
duty.</p>

<p>"Who passes there?" said the count, with
the quick and eager voice of one to whom
suspicion and anxiety had become habitual.
The attendants pointed out to him Pierre
and Genevieve.</p>

<p>"I know that voice," said Pierre, "though
I must never behold the lips that utter it, in
this life."</p>

<p>Count Raymond recognized the sound,
and caught in his mailed grasp the withered
hand of the ancient pastor. "This hand
pointed my way to life," he cried, as he
asked his benediction.</p>

<p>Of all the barbes or teachers of the Albigeois,
Count Raymond had confidence in
Pierre alone, inspired and justified by the
unearthly purity and apostolic simplicity of
his spirit, character, and views; and the
expression of this confidence was rendered
more affecting by recent danger, and solemn
from the circumstances of their meeting and
the mute farewell which closed it.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

<p>"Israelite in whom, indeed, is no guile,"
murmured Count Raymond, rejoining his
band; "I have seen thee, perchance, for the
last time, but when shall I behold thy like?"
Thus honoured and greeted, the ancient man
was borne on, and when they had wound
their tray through the defile, so fatal to the
Crusaders the preceding day, Genevieve, dismissing
Amand, prepared to follow Pierre
and his attendants.</p>

<p>Their path was now less obstructed by
corses and broken armour, but often Genevieve
shrank from these objects which their
loneliness tendered more ghastly; and she
was alarmed by the distant and increasing
tumult, which she guessed to proceed from
the men-at-arms issuing from the Castle of
Courtenaye, whose war-cries, calling on their
fallen lords, rang wild and wide among the
dark hills.</p>

<p>As grasping at the branches of the larch
and fir, and the crags amid whose fissures
they sprang, they toiled up their arduous
way, a sudden blaze of light flashed on

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

them, and Genevieve, giving a sign to their
guides to pause, gazed fearfully round her
for the cause, and at a little distance beheld,
under the shade of a gigantic ash-tree, a
sad and noble sight. It was a woman, magnificently
habited, who sat on the ground
with the body of a warrior stretched on
her knees. His helmet, gorget, and vant-brace,
were off, so that all the lineaments
of death were visible in his pallid but still
ferocious aspect. Two priests stood by, who
appeared too much terrified to pray; there
were female attendants, who seemed to
suppress their grief from reverence for the
lady; and pages in silence held the torches,
whose light, falling on the dark grey trunk of
the ash-tree, gave a kind of ghastly background
to the figures of the group. The
lady sat gazing on the body; her hands were
clasped on her forehead, and the jewelled
bracelets with which her arms were bound,
discovered her rank; her face was as pale
as that of the warrior, and the silence of her

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

despair seemed to have awed her attendants
into silence also.</p>

<p>"And is it thou?" she said at last, in a
voice hoarse and broken&mdash;"this livid, cold,
helpless thing&mdash;is this Simon de Montfort?"&mdash;and
something between a shriek and a laugh
burst from her lips. The women, seeming to
take this as a signal, broke into lamentations.</p>

<p>"Hush," she said, "weep for women or for
babes; the warrior and the noble must have
the death-groan of a thousand for his dirge."</p>

<p>The priests then seemed to whisper consolation,
or offer masses for the dead; she
shook her head. "I knew thy bold spirit well,"
she exclaimed, addressing the corse, "and if
it retains aught of its former strain, it would
joy less in Paradise for a hundred masses
than for one war-cry thundered in battle.
No, my husband&mdash;mine no more&mdash;for the tears
of women and the prayers of priests, the
blood of a thousand churls shall fall for every
noble drop of thine, and thy tomb shall be
the bravest warrior ever slept in&mdash;the bones

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

of a thousand enemies. So swears the
widow of De Montfort, and Christendom
shall see her oath fulfilled."</p>

<p>Awe-struck by what she saw and heard,
Genevieve attempted to hasten on, when the
sound of a low and feeble moaning caught
heir ear; and near this spot she beheld an
Albigeoise supporting her son, a dying youth,
on her knees; she, too, was seated on the
earth; but there were no attendants, no
torches, no gems blazing around the figure
of despair and passion. The mother wiped
with her kerchief, from time to time, the
blood and froth that gathered on the lips of
her son, and often pressed hers to them
with a brief agony she checked, to catch the
hope which the sufferer tried to breathe, or
to whisper it when that breath was suspended
by pain. Her words betokened more anxiety
about the immortal than the mortal part;
she spoke, while yet she had hope of being
heard, of the blessed frame in which a believer
should depart; she even, with choked Voice
and bursting heart, reminded him that forgiveness

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

of wrongs was the first requisite of
that frame.</p>

<p>"Ill-fare the battle-axe of the Bishop of
Toulouse!" murmured the youth; "it was
that which laid me low."&mdash;"Is it thus thou
forgivest, my child?" said the mother.&mdash;"I
could forgive them all&mdash;but bereaving thee
of me: canst thou forgive them that?"&mdash;"I
must!" said the mother.&mdash;"Then, I can,"
said the boy.</p>

<p>A few moments after, by the motion of
his lips (though he could not articulate distinctly)
and the tossing of his weak limbs,
the mother believed he might wish to say
something, which she bent in vain to hear.
"Thou wouldst say somewhat," said she
very slowly. Speaking with much difficulty
and many intervals, the sufferer uttered:&mdash;"I&mdash;have&mdash;given
you&mdash;sometimes&mdash;pain."&mdash;"Never
till now," said the wretched mother,
pressing a corse in her arms&mdash;"never, till this
moment!"</p>

<p>Genevieve was rushing towards her, when
her guides, assuming authority in their

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

turn, pointed out her way, and urged her
vehemently to pursue it. She submitted
when she looked at her grandfather; but she
could not help exclaiming, "O that my corse
may be bedewed with the tears of affection,
not with the blood of vengeance!" As she
spoke, she attempted to hurry on, till, her feet
striking against a piece of armour, she fell;
and when she rose with difficulty, perceived
that her guides were at a distance, and that
she had fallen near the body of a Crusader.
The pale light fell full on the object, on
which she could not help gazing with more
than emotion. The plunderers had already
rent away casque and breast-plate; the rest
of the splendid armour announced the rank
of the fallen warrior; but Genevieve was less
struck by these than by the pale features and
redundant hair of a youth of eighteen: his
forehead was marked by a deep wound, and
his white bosom was deeply gored by another.
As Genevieve gazed on him, a choked and
convulsive breathing announced that life

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

was not yet quite extinct. Genevieve bent
over him involuntarily: the sigh was repeated
more audibly; and grasping at the hope of
preserving one human life from the event
of that bloody day, she had even the temerity
to implore one who approached her,
to assist in removing the wounded knight
to the shelter of some tree or cave, "where
at least," she said, "the mountain-winds
would not blow so unpiteously on his untended
wounds." The man, who had only
returned to ask why she loitered, sternly
refused her request, and demanded would
she seek him to aid a Catholic, a "persecutor
and injurious?" "Alas!" said the maiden,
"he has no mother to hold his dying head&mdash;
no noble widow to watch his corse. In the
name of Him who <i>is</i> mercy, let us be merciful!&mdash;aid
me to bear him but where he may
die unpierced by the chill wind, and unrent
by the wolf and the bear! Alas, for pity!&mdash;in
these bloody times the voice of war bids
men hate each other; but centuries agone

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

there was a voice that said, 'Love one
another,' and to that voice I rather yield
me."</p>

<p>"I doubt thou dost," said the speaker,
whose voice betrayed Amand. "And is it
thus, Genevieve, I find thee employed?"</p>

<p>"And how camest thou here?" said the
startled Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Because I left father and mother to follow
thee," said the youth, bursting into an
agony of indignant grief: "and would I
had died ere I met thee thus!&mdash;the corse
of a foe is dearer to thee than the life of
a friend."</p>

<p>"I answer thee not!" said Genevieve,
proud in the purity of her heart: "thou hast
refused me thine aid, and I need not thy
reproaches."</p>

<p>"Reproaches! No, Genevieve!&mdash;nor shalt
thou bear the reproach of the congregation
through me. The secret of thy wishing to
aid one of the accursed shall be kept as it
were my own; though, were it told, it would

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

be a sin against thee and thy father's house
to cut them off for ever."</p>

<p>"Do in that as thou wilt," said the maiden,
who felt this promise somewhat like a threat:
"for me, I am not a Jael to smite, but a Michal
to aid in the time of peril and of escape.
And weak as mine hands are, they may, in
bearing this mangled frame to shelter, do
more acceptable deed than the hands of those
who laid it low this day." So saying, with
her utmost strength she attempted to raise
the wounded knight. A cry of pain, and an
increased convulsion of the limbs, indicated
that she gave only agony, but gave not relief.
Amand could not see her straining her slender
arms, and sighing as she resigned her helpless
burthen without some touch of feeling; but
when at the movement the blood again gushed
from the wounds of the tortured youth,
Amand forgot all his jealous feelings, and
springing to her assistance, the body, with
his added strength, was borne to a cave,
where the young and graceful form lay pillowed

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

on stone as on a monument, and the
thick clusters of the clematis and ivy hung
towering over it, like banners over a grave.</p>

<p>So said Amand, with perchance a sneer at
the obsequies of chivalry, which he had been
taught to hate and disdain. "And how,"
he asked, "wilt thou reward me for this
toil?"&mdash;"With my prayers," answered the
maiden, whose heart was lightened by
this deed of mercy.&mdash;"Nay, a Catholic
Beata could pay me with her prayers."&mdash;"Then,
with my love."&mdash;"Ah, but thou
lovest Heaven, the pastor&mdash;all but me."&mdash;"Then
with my hand."&mdash;"Thy hand!" cried
Amand.&mdash;"Yes, my hand," said Genevieve,
with forced and mournful gaiety; "and give
me thine in return to aid me to climb this
steep; in sooth I cannot, without thy assistance&mdash;and
it is to follow my father&mdash;and I am
very weary. Nay," she added, straining her
exhausted spirits to soothe his sullen mood&mdash;"Nay,
frown not, Amand; would knight of
chivalry refuse such favour from his lady?&mdash;and
wilt thou reject mine?" He assisted

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

her in silence to ascend the steep; but the
pressure with which he wrung her hand
when she reached the summit, and the look
he cast on her, visible even amid the darkness
from its fierce intensity of expression,
made her tremble. She knew not what she
had to fear&mdash;but still she feared.</p>

<br/>

<p>SIR Paladour set forward on his desperate
search, mal-content and full of troubled
thoughts. At the castle, or from the bands
whom he occasionally met, he could obtain
no information but that the lady Isabelle
had been carried off by some unknown violence;
and the Abbot of Normoutier, who
might have been enabled to give a more particular
account, he had not seen or conferred
with. To prick forth alone, without guide
or direction, in pursuit of a lady borne off by
violence, was in the very spirit of the age, and,

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

if it had not, would still have been congenial
to his daring spirit; but now he felt impelled
to it by a wish to escape from a revisiting
of those disastrous presages, which
never failed to be awakened by the recurrence
of recent misfortune.</p>

<p>Riding on, without path or hope, he found
himself, towards midnight, on the verge of a
heath, whose bounds were lost in darkness;
and here, unknowing either region or track,
he threw the reins on the neck of his weary
horse, and, reckless whither he was borne,
sat wrapt in his own dark musings. "Fate
will no longer be mistaken!" Thus his
thoughts ran. "She deals with me in oracles
no longer. Evil befalls all around me,&mdash;and
the flight of so many arrows shows at
whom they are aimed. The lady of my love
is the prey of violence!&mdash;the friend of my
soul falls beside me in battle! This scattering
of the leaves foretells speedy autumn.
Would that the blast were come, and the
despoiled tree were bowed to earth before it!"&mdash;"Many
a tree in falling crushes the feller!"

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

said a voice distinctly near him, "and woe
to him who lays axe to the root of that for
which Heaven is whetting its own. Fear not,
Sir Paladour, thou hast seen the goodliest of
the forest strewed like willows around thee
to-day, but the blast that shall level thy
stately stem, is brooding yet in the treasury
of heaven's own heaped and hoarded wrath."</p>

<p>Sir Paladour caught up his reins; the steed
too, as if by instinct, started and stood sweating
and pawing the earth. A form stood
near him in shapeless darkness, but the
sounds that issued from it rang in the ears
of the knight, as those of a voice too well
remembered. At any period to have encountered
such greeting at midnight and in
solitude, would require well-strung nerves.
At that in which Paladour lived, it demanded
courage almost superhuman. And
in this peculiar instance, peculiar resolution
was indeed necessary, for he recognized in
that dark figure her who had piloted him
over the lake, and whom he had afterwards
encountered on a more fearful night, in the

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

vaults of the Castle of Courtenaye. The
remembrance of the terrors of that night
held him dumb, nor did the figure appear to
wish to renew the topic, potent as it was:
thus a singular silence was observed between
them by a kind of mental and unexpressed
compact on the subject of their last meeting,
(it was, indeed, never discussed till a much
later period,) and each seemed to prepare
only for the present encounter.</p>

<p>The knight crossed himself, and repeated
his credo and ave before he ventured to look
round.</p>

<p>"Thou didst not tremble thus to-day,"
said the shape, approaching and almost laying
its hand on his rein. "Why tremblest
thou at the voice of a being like thyself?"&mdash;"Mortal
I scarce believe thee," said the
knight, "for when did aught mortal touch
me with fear such as I now feel?"&mdash;"Yet
mortal I am," answered the voice, "for I
suffer, and I come to announce suffering.
Lackest thou other proof of my being one of
thy own wretched race? Fling all your warnings,

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

voices of the dead, cries heard in the
still night, or whispers from the tomb, all that
terror has taught, or credulity believed, in
one scale, and weigh it against the denunciatory
voice of the living, who announces woe
and can verify the announcement, and see
how the scale inclines."</p>

<p>"In the name of all that is sacred," said
the knight, in whose ears the voice of his
strange pilot over the lake became more
and more distinct, "whence comest thou,
and where art thou sped?"&mdash;"Whence I
come," answered the voice, "I know not;
whither I go, I reck not. But for thee,
Paladour, I can tell whence thou comest,
and whither thou speedest. Thou comest
from a feast where thou wast at once
viand and caterer; the feast of war, where
fools are food; where life is lavished we
know not why, and eternity risked we care
not wherefore. Thou comest from fighting
against the fools who make pleasure a crime,
in the cause of those more desperate fools

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

who make crime their pleasure. Thou
comest from that mart of deadly traffic,
where deeds are given in security for words,
and he who believes he knows not what,
signs the bond of his blind creed with his
blood, and dreams that the Almighty will
ratify the contract and repay the loss.
From such spot thou comest, and thou art
hastening where the frail idol of thy
earth-bound heart is held by a stronger
arm, and kept in cage where thy beak
may be blunted, and her gay plumage soiled,
ere its wires be broken, and the bird
be free."</p>

<p>The knight, overpowered and appalled as
he was by her words, caught in the last a
hope to which the very fibres of his heart
clung; yet, dreading alike to provoke or attempt
to soothe one whose malignity seemed
so unappeasable, and fearing that his betraying
solicitude would be the very means
of its defeat, he tried to speak with evasive
caution.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

<p>"Thou hast truly said why I am here,
now tell me as truly wherefore thou art?"&mdash;"To
serve thee, to serve thee, doubtless,"
she answered; "Oh, wherefore else do I
live," she repeated with a frantic laugh,
"but to be thy slave and work out thy purposes
at the risk of these miserable remains
of withered life and ruined intellect? I tell
thee, Paladour, I can point thee to the very
spot where the lady of thy love was borne
this night."</p>

<p>The knight shrunk back in horror at the
thought that the fate of the lady Isabelle was
in the power or even the knowledge of such a
being. The female mistook the cause of his
emotion.</p>

<p>"And shrinkest thou, Sir knight of the
bloody cross? Craven knight! could not one
stamp of my foot have overset the bark
when I rowed thee on thy way to the Castle
of Courtenaye? Could not one breath of my
lips bring around thee the heretic warriors; who
wander yet on the verge of this heath, and
would count thee an acceptable sacrifice to

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

their vengeance, and call it an offering to the
Lord?"&mdash;"Cease, accursed hag!" cried the
knight; "into the hands of heretics themselves
would I fall, rather than into thine."&mdash;"Choose
thy next guide thyself," said the
shape, turning from him. "Nay, hold, hold!"
as she rushed away, "hold and turn," he
shouted; "I yield me to thy guidance, show
me but the path where she hath been borne,
the hold where she is constrained&mdash;the one I
will pursue at my life's dearest peril; the
other, were it guarded by fiends, I will
assail, were my soul's safety on the issue."&mdash;"Life
and soul!" said the figure, returning,
"a goodly risk, and manfully perilled;" and
she strode on with a step rapid, yet light and
firm.</p>

<p>They were in a sandy morass, where his
guide, who knew the track, bounded from one
tenable spot to another with incredible
celerity, while the wearied and heavily encumbered
steed flounced from moss to mire,
and from stone to turf, embarrassing himself
and his rider.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

<p>"Alight," said the figure, "and leave thy
steed here; he shall be tended. What!
afraid again? and of a woman? and yet deep
reason hast thou to dread woman," she said,
speaking to herself; "and deeper still hath
woman to dread thee; yet fear not her who
partakes neither of the weakness of her sex,
nor the brutal strength of thine, who has
ceased to hope, or fear, or feel; who has no
remaining link to bind her to life, save that
which throbs with pain&mdash;who knows not that
she lives but when she feels she suffers."&mdash;"I
understand not thy words, nor dare
to scan their meaning," said the knight alighting;
"but it never shall be said that fiend,
in the form of woman or man, repulsed Paladour
from peril or adventure. To our dear
Lord's grace and Mary's might I commit me
in this strait; but I had rather follow the
fallen banner of the Cross in ten such fields
as were lost this dread and disastrous day,
than guide like thee, save in such cause."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the female began ascending a
cliff, that suddenly rose amid the swamp,

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

with a speed and strength almost miraculous;
and the knight, though well nigh exhausted,
and encumbered with his heavy armour,
followed with a vigour and celerity which
he owed partly to a frame that united the
most knitted muscular strength with boyish
lightness, and partly to an excitement which
strung his nerves with preternatural energy.
The female, who saw him almost overtake
her in the wild bounds and desperate graspings
of a track known but to herself, and
where no step but his would have dared
to follow, seemed from time to time to
look back on him with a kind of reluctant
admiration, "And must it be so?" she muttered
to herself, "so fairly fashioned&mdash;so
clear and bold a spirit!&mdash;See how he bounds
from crag to crag&mdash;how he grasps at a tuft
of withered grass, and, now that it fails,
springs upward with the whole strength of
his gallant frame! That was the arm that
struck the giant De Montfort to the earth in
the lists&mdash;that was the foot that held its stirrup
last in the bloody field&mdash;that was the

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

ample chest from which thundered the war-cry
of La Croix Sanglante, when prouder
voices were hushed, and more boastful tongues
were cold. Welcome; welcome!" she exclaimed,
as if priding in her victim, who had toiled to
the summit of the cliff; then suddenly turning
on him, "Now dash thyself below&mdash;leave
thy body in ten thousand fragments to be
snatched by the vultures, and commit thy
soul to heaven! Thou shudderest, but be
warned, (I warn thee in mercy,) and follow
me no farther."</p>

<p>"I ever deemed thee a fiend, and thine is
a fiend's counsel," said the knight, as he stood
on the steep, dizzy with toil, famine, and
fatigue; "but whither wouldst thou indeed
lead me?"&mdash;"<i>To thy wish</i>, fool," said the
female: "now judge if I give thee not kind
counsel to perish rather. She who points a
sudden and desperate death to the sufferer,
perchance shows him mercy; but she who
guides thee to thy wish, guides thee to wretchedness,
so bitter, so inevitable, so deadly, that&mdash;knit
not thy brow, or handle thy brand&mdash;thou

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

hast already determined. One moment's
pause of feeling came over <i>my</i> heart&mdash;one
moment of reflection was allowed <i>thee</i>&mdash;both
abused, both lost, there remains but this&mdash;now
follow me," and she plunged from the summit
of the crag, like an eagle from its eyry. The
knight followed more slowly, yet reached the
plain almost at the same moment; it was a
waste extent of sand interrupted sometimes
by rocks, over which the female seemed to
glide, ever beckoning her wearied associate
to follow. It was now near morning; a pale
grey light gleamed on a range of headlands
and promontories, broken by deep and sinuous
bays full of sands heaped up to a formidable
height, and so curved, that the point one
seemed to touch with the eye, required a
mile's toil to reach. The distant thunder of
the breaking surge was heard, but so faintly,
that the knight heard distinctly the hissing
of the sands under his mailed feet; and this
sound so calm and monotonous formed almost
a fearful contrast to the deep silence of his
guide. Suddenly, his companion springing

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

on a ledge of rock which rose in their way,
and motioning to him to follow, extended her
arm towards an object faintly seen in the
hazy light, and exclaimed, "There is l'Aigle
sur la Roche, the hold of that fierce outlaw
who keeps thy lady in thrall." Paladour,
straining his sight, could scarce discover a
mass of rock that projected far into the sea,
and seemed to be terminated land-ward by
a morass, thus forming nearly a peninsula.
On its summit arose something of which the
eye could scarce ascertain whether it were
edifice or rock piled on rock, so much did its
massive and perpendicular structure seem
like a part of the cliff it was perched on.
Its aspect was so dreary and formidable, that
the knight, as he withdrew his eyes from
that unassailable hold, and turned them on
his own solitary and unaided person, could
not prevent a heavy sigh of despondency
bursting from his bosom.</p>

<p>"Yes, yonder is l'Aigle sur la Roche," said
his guide, as if answering his thoughts; "and
when thou canst win the eagle to drop the

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

lamb he has pounced on, still despair to
rescue the prey from the fangs of the outlaw;
and when thou hast caused the Alps to rock
to their foundations, then dream of awaking
a pinnacle fall from the battlements of yon
tower."&mdash;"Then," said the knight, with rekindled
eye, "are those walls doomed to ruin
as sure as the light of heaven's sun is rising
on them this hour! for never yet did aught
perilous or desperate invite me to the encounter
unfoiled; nor need I higher assurance
of victory, than to hear that my foe is
invincible."</p>

<p>At this moment, as he fixed his eagle eyes
on the tower, at which already they seemed
to take fatal aim, something was seen moving
on the summit of the rock, which the distance
prevented their distinguishing as human
forms; but the next moment the blast of a
horn that woke the thousand echoes of the
shore, suggested to Paladour the thought,
that perhaps at that moment, the lady and
her attendants were entering the hold of the
outlaw. They were, indeed, the prisoners

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

whom Adolfo and his band had seized the
preceding day, and whom they were now
conveying to their fastness.</p>

<p>From the moment of her recovery from
the swoon into which her terror had thrown
her, the lady Isabelle had in vain supplicated
to know in whose power she was, or whither
she was to be borne; her entreaties, aided by
the louder cries of her attendants, were heard
in silence, and the horsemen pursued their
course at full speed, treating their prisoners,
however, with all the gentleness their situation
rendered possible. Towards midnight,
conceiving themselves beyond the reach of
pursuit, they slackened their pace, and at
length halted in a valley, where, spreading
their mantles on the ground, and assisting
their prisoners to alight, they invited them
with no uncourteous gestures to partake of
the refreshments with which they were spread.
This was the only interruption to their journey,
till by dawn they reached the tower of
l'Aigle sur la Roche. After passing the gate,
they were conducted into a rude hall, without

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

windows or any light, except through a narrow
slit near the door. The walls were of unhewn
stone, and the floor was flagged in compartments
to resemble a chess-board. On this
some of the band were stretched and playing,
as the party entered: their oaths and vociferations
were hushed in a moment; they rose
and retired respectfully, and the lady and her
attendants remained alone with their captors,
who stood in silence round them, without
either removing their masks, or throwing
off their mantles. It seemed as if they knew
not how to deal with their prisoners, while
the latter stood trembling, not knowing what
danger they were to deprecate first, or to
whom they were to make their appeal. The
lady Isabelle alone struggled to resume that
air of insulted dignity, of which fatigue and
terror had almost deprived her. Accustomed
to command, she considered the expression
as equal to the habit, and the assumption of
it did for a moment awe the rude and lawless
men who surrounded her. At this moment,
dame Marguerite, who had collected her

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

breath, advanced, and with grimaces that
seemed to the lady to indicate insanity, welcomed
her to <i>her</i> castle, lamented the hardships
of her rapid journey, and assured her
that her reception should be worthy of the
noble knight, her bridegroom; who&mdash;&mdash;Here
dame Marguerite, on a sign from the principal
of the band, was borne in a moment
from the hall; while after a pause he advanced
with an air of embarrassment, and,
pointing towards a narrow door at the extremity
of the hall, seemed to intimate his wish
that she should ascend a staircase of stone on
which it opened. The lady, who saw she
could not choose but obey, cast a look of
agony round her; but, perceiving that her
damsels were permitted to follow, began to
ascend, declining all proffer of assistance from
the dark knight, which the steepness of the
stair seemed to require, while its narrowness
rendered the ascent of more than one at a
time impossible. Thus, with steps whose
falterings she tried to conceal, and with a
heart whose tremblings she scorned to betray,

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

the noble beauty, wrapt in her veil, ascended
the stairs in silence, rejecting all aid, but ever
castling a watchful wistful look on her damsels,
who followed close behind.</p>

<p>The tower of l'Aigle sur la Roche, built
by a predatory baron of the preceding century,
rose eight stories from the rock in which
its foundations were sunk, and which was
impregnable to any mode of assault known
in those days. Each story contained a large
square apartment roofed and floored with
stone, and furnished with small recesses, hollowed
in the solid walls, of various shapes,
some wholly dark, some lighted only by a
loophole. The apartment on the ground-floor
was a kind of guard-room; that above it, a
rude banquet-room; the recesses, or niches
rather in both, serving the banditti for the
purpose of sleeping in. The upper apartments
were occupied as armouries or store-rooms
for plunder; but the topmost had been
formerly fitted up with some care for the favourite
of the lawless man who built the tower,
and was the only apartment in the whole

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

structure that could boast of a window, or
rather casement, whose stanchion of stone
and shattered panes seemed rather to tell of
the comfort and elegance it was intended
once to bestow, than to afford either now.
All these apartments communicated by a
spiral staircase of stone, whose only level
landing-place opened on this apartment, while
a few ascending steps led to a bartizan, from
whence the piercing eye of the outlaw could
discern (it was said for miles) his prey, land
and sea, and arm his band or man his bark
to seize whatever spoil either element might
afford. It was to this apartment the lady
Isabelle ascended, and it was evident that it
had been furnished for her reception with a
kind of rude and hasty splendour. Tapestry
was hung on the walls by wooden pegs stuck
between the interstices of the stones, but in
many places those walls of ragged stone
were totally bare. A vast wood-fire blazed
on the hearth, and a lamp, suspended by a
soiled and tarnished chain from the raftered
roof, hung swinging to and fro as if but recently

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

placed there. The bed, with its silken
canopy, was worthy the chamber of a princess,
but there was an incongruity, a want of appointment
in the chamber, which, with all
its coarse and lavish display of splendour,
reminded its unfortunate visitor too strongly
of the well-regulated magnificence of her
bower in the Castle of Courtenaye. The
damsels, too, shuddered when they observed
there was not in the apartment, either a
vessel for holy water, a crucifix, or an image
of the Virgin. The outlaw, after pointing
the lady to a bench covered with tapestry,
and placing before her a trivet covered with
refreshments and costly wines, and by gestures
inviting her to partake of them, retired.
The lady Isabelle, who had continued
speechless from terror, indignation, and the
nameless dread of what their expression
might expose her to, if she opened her lips,
sat in silence for some moments after he had
departed; then rising, as with an instinctive
movement, she approached the casement, and
flinging it open, gazed with fearful earnestness

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

on the prospect below. The tower here rose
perpendicularly from the rock; two hundred
feet below its foundations the waves of the
Mediterranean were beating the rock, which,
rushing out into a promontory, increased the
agitation of the waves, that roared like exhausted
thunder at its base, and tortured by
the crags and cavities, tossed their spray, like
the bound of sea-monsters, to a terrific height
on the terraces into which the rock had been
hewn for the accommodation of the outlaw's
men. The lady Isabelle looked down in
dizzy terror on a sight she had never before
beheld, an unscaleable rock, and the ocean in
fury foaming at its base. She closed the
casement, and, turning from it, advanced a
few steps into the apartment. She spoke not,
but despair was in her features. Her damsels,
who had watched her looks, now flung themselves
at her feet, and grasping her robes, as
if for protection, burst into those wild expressions
of grief, which reverence for their
lady, and hope derived from her, had hitherto
suppressed.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

<p>The noble maiden, at this sight, felt her
long-sustained courage and high-wrought
spirit fail, and, after vainly pressing her hands
on her bosom, as if to aid her painful respiration,
she burst into an agony of tears.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>IN the mean time, the other apartments
in the tower were filled with their various
occupants, all intent on their own pursuits.
The bandits had retired to calculate on the
princely ransom of the heiress&mdash;Adolfo to
drink with his comrade&mdash;and dame Marguerite
had been at an early period of her arrival
borne off to another apartment by one of
the band, to whom Adolfo had given a sign.
This apartment was no better than one of
the recesses we have before mentioned; its
form was that of an acute angle, of which the
vertex ended in a loophole not more than six

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

inches wide, but being <i>bevilled</i> inwards, the
immense thickness of the wall allowed it to
effuse more light through the recess than its
narrow aperture promised, but that light fell
only on rugged walls, a stone bench, and an
ill-carved image, which was once intended
for a crucifix. On this stone-bench was
dame Marguerite seated perforce, and pouring
forth loud reproaches against her uncourteous
conductor. "My lord," said the bandit,
who had his lesson, "requires that all
this be received and understood as the testimony
of his infinite respect for the virtuous
and discreet Marguerite."</p>

<p>"Respect me no respects!" cried the gouvernante:
"respect hath flung me across a
horse, as a miller's boy would a sack of flour&mdash;respect
hath shaken mine entrails to a jelly&mdash;respect
hath dislocated every joint in my
frame&mdash;respect hath rent my veil and head-gear
to rags&mdash;respect hath torn my tunic and
skirt in a fashion shameful and piteous to
behold&mdash;respect hath thrust me into no better
than a dog-hole;&mdash;and then comes respect to

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

hope that all is to my liking:&mdash;the foul fiend
fly away with such respect! I have been
treated with civil rudeness once and again,
and have borne, yea, and made civil return,
when there was no offence done but such as
gentlewomen might and ought to bear with
in civility; but thy respect, knave, I cannot
away with,"&mdash;"Perchance all was done in
curious delicacy, to prevent the suspicions of
the lady Isabella, who might be jealous of
service done to one who so far excels her in
beauty?&mdash;"She was indeed strangely jealous
of me," said dame Marguerite, propitiated by
this homage to her incredible folly; "and
had I not deemed that seeing me preferred
by a young and valiant knight would have
been a wholesome lesson to her vanity, I had
never encountered such trial. Marry, the
issue has cost me more than her for whose
behoof it was undergone: this is what we
get by aiming at the good of others. But,
mercy of Heaven! what place is this they
have borne us to? Where be the fair attendance,
the noble knight, the love-suit, and

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

the gallants waiting? Meseems, this is more
like a robber's hold than a knight's castle&mdash;more
like what I have fearfully heard men
tell of l'Aigle sur la Roche, or some haunt
of bandits."&mdash;"Nothing can escape thy penetration,
sage Marguerite," said the robber;
"thou art indeed in the fastness of that outlaw,
whom courtesy forbids me to name, terrible
as the sound must be to ears feminine."
The scream uttered by the wretched woman
at this disclosure certainly pierced the robber's
ears, but had not the same effect on his
feelings, for he listened with perfect <i>sang-froid</i>
to the exclamations that followed,
"What! am I betrayed?" shrieked Marguerite.
"Did not this Judas appear among
the train of the Abbot of Normoutier?&mdash;did
he not win mine ear with a tale of a
noble knight who loved and would make
me his bride?&mdash;did he not say that he would
the lady Isabelle might be there to witness
the bridal?&mdash;and did I not do him to wit
how she might be seized when her attendants
were away but yesterday, when the

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

Crusaders went on their mad course? And
is this the reward of my faithfulness and
loyal dealing? Where is the castle to receive
me?&mdash;where is the bridegroom to
welcome me?&mdash;where is the promise that
the lady Isabelle should bow herself before
me? An' it had not been to chastise her
vanity, as it were, thou hadst never seen
me here."&mdash;"The chastisement may not be
thrown away, though it hath missed the
lady Isabelle for the present," said the robber:
"in the mean time be not discomfited,
amiable Marguerite; for, I swear to thee,
thou shalt meet thy promised bridegroom
to-night, though it be in the walls of l'Aigle
sur la Roche."&mdash;"Nay, if I am to meet him
to-night," said the gouvernante, "that mollifies.
But, now that I think on it, I am and
will be discomfited; I have had nought to
breakfast. Send me suddenly a manchet and
a cup of pigment, and let the lady Isabelle,
or one of her lazy damsels attend to arrange
my coif and veil; else look to it, knave;&mdash;and,
dost thou hear? tell the knight, my lover, to

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

cause some tapestry to clothe these walls and
cover this unsightly bench of stone; for of a
truth, since my so speedy journey, this seat
feels like aught but a bed of roses." The
answer of the robber was interrupted by
three blasts of a horn, wound at short intervals.
Starting at the sound, he hastened to
the hall, where Adolfo was, leaving Marguerite
to dream of tapestry, pigment, a new
coif and tunic, and the lady gazing with
envy at her bridal magnificence.</p>

<p>The outlaw was carousing in the hall, or
guard-room, with Gerand, the second in command,
a sullen and ferocious character, but
desperately brave; and both were revelling in
the pride of success and the wantonness of
rude luxury. "A health," shouted Adolfo,
"to the brain that devised, and the hand
that wrought, the boldest emprize that
ever crowned an outlaw!&mdash;a health to the
eagle who holds in his talons a prey that
makes him indeed the king of birds! Now
pledge me deeply, Gerand! I have a glorious
vision of the huge coffers of the Lord of

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

Courtenaye yawning like opening graves, and
yielding up to a joyful resurrection some
thousands of bezants and golden crowns that
have slumbered there for centuries."</p>

<p>"Thy rashness had well nigh lost us the
sight of that beatific vision," muttered Gerand.
"What a plague hadst thou to do to
thrust thyself amid the Crusaders and the
heretics, like some fantastic knight of adventure
in a troubadour's song, and set lance in
rest when thou shouldst have laid spur to
flank. An' thy foolish humour of valour
were not near marring the game and missing
the prize, I would I might never rob pilgrim
again!"</p>

<p>"By St. Dennis of France!" answered
the outlaw, "I went with purpose to have
secured the lady first;&mdash;but when I heard
the war-cry shouted and the bugles wound,
and saw the banners stream and the knights
charge, I could not choose but share the
feast to which I had such noble invitation;
and hadst thou tasted of it, thou wouldst

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

have marvelled how one in harness could
quit it so soon."</p>

<p>"This valour of thine at times leaves thee
no better than a common man," said Gerand
sullenly. "When the lady and train were
borne hither, thou stoodest before them abased
and mute, like one who knew not whether
thou wast their prisoner, or they thy thrall,
as I am a true man!"</p>

<p>"Say rather, as thou art a false knave!"</p>

<p>"All's one for that. I was about to ask
thee whether we were not best to convey
them to their castle back again."</p>

<p>"By the mass! and if thou hadst, at that
moment I would have said, 'Marry, with all
my heart!' I am not one to blench for the
threats of man or the tears of woman;&mdash;but
when I saw that noble lady, standing so
beautiful and pale and helpless, amid a band
of rude, lawless knaves like thee, I stood before
her like a chidden urchin, and felt <i>that</i> tug
at my heart-string which I am a fool to tell
thee of, who couldst as soon con thy breviary
as give utterance to one gentle thought."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

<p>"Here be fit time and place for gentle
thoughts!" said Gerand, as the blast of the
horn made both spring to their feet and
grasp their daggers instinctively, and the
robber who had just left Marguerite, rushed
into the hall.</p>

<p>"How now!&mdash;thy tidings, knave?"</p>

<p>"A band of pilgrims, wealthily laden as I
guess&mdash;for they travel slowly, and have armed
men in their company&mdash;are about to cross
the morass," said the robber.</p>

<p>"We will take order that the weight of
their baggage do not sink them. Now,
honour to the Saints! they bring us ever our
best visitors. A pestilence on those peevish
Albigeois! Did their cursed heresy prevail,
there would not be a pilgrimage in the land
to pay toll to the warders of our lonely
tower. Fie on them! I say. Where be our
masks and mantles? Summon our men!
These pilgrims have full wine-bags to be
pressed, and boxes of costly reliques, and,
perchance, purses of bezants. Foul shame it
were if the holy men laboured under their

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

weight long, while quick hands were near to
lighten them. St. Dennis so speed me in
this essay, as I will dedicate on his altar four
wax-candles, each of bigness enough to be
the pillar of a church! Ever most generous
Saint! send me a company of jolly pilgrims,
and it shall go hard if thy altars be not the
brightest in every church in France. And
for the rest, so help me Heaven! I will clear
off all next Easter with the Abbot of Normoutier."</p>

<p>"These be thy gentle thoughts," said Gerand
with a sullen sneer. The outlaw laughed:
"I warred with knights yesterday: do thou
engage with pilgrims to-day:&mdash;each to his
destiny."&mdash;"But not to his choice," said
Gerand gloomily, as he masked himself.</p>

<p>The outlaw was following, when the messenger
grasped his arm. "The prisoner
within," said he, "hath become outrageous.
She says, she will be wedded to-night."&mdash;"Then
wed her thyself!" said Adolfo, flinging
him off, "and rid me of her and thee."&mdash;"Wed
her!" quoth the robber; "I would

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

sooner hang her, withered succuba!"&mdash;"Then
hang her, an' thou wilt, so thou molest me
not."&mdash;"Marry and will; from the highest
pinnacle of thy tower thou shalt see her like
a kite nailed to a peasant's barn, and her kirtle
floating like a banner, on thy return."&mdash;"Hark
thee, knave," said the outlaw, flinging
back his houpland, and fixing the lull force
of his commanding eye on the speaker, "I will
have no cruelty. She is a fool, and treacherous;
but though thou mayest mock, thou shalt
not abuse her;&mdash;she is a worthless fringe on
the garment which I kiss with my heart's
lips. I yield her to thy sport, but not thy
barbarity; and for the rest, on thy life meddle
not with the female prisoners."&mdash;"Ay,"
said the robber, when he was out of hearing,
"by his own good-will he would never have
any one meddle with the female prisoners
but himself."</p>

<p>The lady Isabelle, from her casement, saw
the brigands depart, and clasped her hands
in a short moment of ecstasy; and she even
augured well from the frequent demands for

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

aid from the tower. Troop after troop poured
out; while the tower rang, from base to
summit, with the hasty step of those who
rushed to seize their arms, and made the port
and drawbridge ring with their steel-shod
steps. The conflict seemed a dangerous one;
and it was late in the twilight of that evening
that the horn was blown, and faintly
answered by the wearied party who wound
their way up the rock. The iron voice of
the outlaw was heard through the eight stories
of the tower by ears quickened by terror.
"Fling the pilgrims into the dungeon; let
them see if their beads will ransom them!
Bear the wounded knight to safe tendance:
give me a draught of wine: an' he were not
a Crusader, I would fling him from the summit
of this rock, wounded as he is. We will
hold him to ransom, and he shall pay in gold
for every drop of blood he hath cost us to-day:
but for his mad aid, we had won that
band of pilgrims for saying 'Stand!' A cup
of wine, knaves! and stick a torch in yon
niche of the hall, that I may do myself right

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

when I am pledged to myself alone, and ye
are howling over your paltry hurts, like maimed
curs in a peasant's cottage. But look to
the wounded knight, I charge ye. He bore
him bravely. I would not see him suffer
wrong for twice the value of this day's
booty."</p>

<p>The wounded knight (who was no other
than Paladour) was borne insensible in the
arms of two of the robbers, who, still smarting
under the wounds he had dealt with no
sparing hand, were not in the mood to treat
their charge too gently.</p>

<p>"Where have ye left the prisoner?" said
Gerand, who saw them descending the stair
by the light of a torch Bertran (one of them)
carried. "Where best beseems his valour
to be," said Bertran. "He fought to-day
like a devil, and we have bestowed him
where he will have devils enough to fight
with,&mdash;in that dark chamber where the fiend
is heard to yell so fearfully at night. Being
a Crusader, he is doubtless armed with a
spell or relique, or such godly gear as will

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

prevent the fiend, and save us from being
tormented before our time."&mdash;"Tarry, and
lend me thine arm, knave," said Gerand:
"my wounds begin to ache, and I am not in
the mood for the fierce revel that Adolfo is
to win courage to accost the lady with. He
hath sworn he will treat with her for her
ransom to-night."&mdash;"Hasten back," said Bertran
to his comrade, "and I will treat thee
with a scene of mirth worth all the feats of a
jongleur, or the moralities played by the priests
at Easter." His companion soon joined him,
and they proceeded together to dame Marguerite's
cell, who saw with delight the gleam
as it appeared through the many crevices of
her door. "Noble lady,&mdash;for so we must
call you now," said Bertran, with a low obeisance,&mdash;"we
come to conduct you to the presence
of your noble and enamoured knight."&mdash;"In
good time," said the dame; "for here
have I sat all day, like an owl in the hole of
a ruined wall, with no companion save the
wind whistling through the loophole&mdash;no
couch save this seat, that would mortify the

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

limbs of a hermit&mdash;no food but a sorry loaf
and a pitcher of sour wine,&mdash;with sundry
other lacks that a gentlewoman cannot signify.
Truly this knight of thine had needs
be valiant and loving, to make amends for all
I have borne for his sake."&mdash;"Thou wilt find
him all that troubadours sing and maidens
dream of, and, moreover, impatient to clasp
thee to his bosom."&mdash;"Nay, I will not be
so fiercely handled," said the dame.&mdash;"I
doubt thou wilt," said the other outlaw.&mdash;"He
is, perchance, very young, then," said
Marguerite, simpering.&mdash;"Thou wouldst not
credit me if I said how young," said Bertran.&mdash;"He
was but three when he was caught,"
quoth the other.&mdash;"Caught!" echoed Marguerite.&mdash;"Alas!
noble lady," said Bertran,
winking at his comrade, "he is, like thyself,
a captive: two years hath he been the thrall
of Adolfo, who now repents him that he hath
held him so long prisoner, and will shortly
set him free ransomless."&mdash;"Nay, for that
matter," said the dame, "an imprisoned
knight hath a rich charm for the fancy of a

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

maiden like me, who always loved a romaunt
better than her breviary; and, as
long as he is a thrall, there is less fear
of his escaping from me. But, faithful
squire, you have never painted to me the
goodly favour of your knight."&mdash;"Marry,
for his looks," said Bertran, stroking his chin,
"there be those who like them not; but,
nevertheless, he hath somewhat, methinks&mdash;I
know not how, as it were, to phrase it&mdash;somewhat
that strangely resembles thine own
favour, noble lady."&mdash;"Then he is not altogether
uncomely," said the dame, spreading
her hand before her face.&mdash;"Every whit as
comely as thou art," answered the other.&mdash;"And
he is of an ancient noble stock, thou
tellest me?" said the dame.&mdash;"Nay, of the
most ancient family in France:&mdash;men say his
ancestors were lords of mountain and plain
ere the forefathers of King Philip were
known; and that all our nobility were the
sons of yesterday, compared to his high and
unknown descent."&mdash;"Young, noble, and
enamoured&mdash;and a prisoner!&mdash;lead me to him,

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

and I will yield what solace an afflicted
maiden can give," said Marguerite,&mdash;"Yet
how shall I present myself to him, my tunic
rent, my coif disarranged, my hair disordered,
my&mdash;" "Trust me, noble lady," said Bertran,
"he would better like thee all disarrayed."&mdash;"You
make me blush," murmured
Marguerite.&mdash;"That would be a task to defy
the devil," said the comrade.&mdash;"How meanest
thou?" said the dame.&mdash;"He means,"
quoth Bertran, winking again at his comrade,
"that the devil himself could not raise a
blush on a cheek like thine, unconscious of
aught but the glow of maiden pudency."&mdash;
So saying, Bertran supported one arm, while
his comrade lighting a splinter of pine at the
torch, caught the other, and led the dame,
nothing loth, through a paved passage, near
the centre of which was a circular aperture
covered by a stone, about the size of that
through which the Cardinal de Guise was
thrust into a dungeon, and afterwards murdered,
and which a modern traveller declares
to be no larger than that of a hole in the

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

pathways of London for admitting coals.
The party, as they approached the brink of
this precipice, might have presented a group
for a Gothic Hogarth. The fierce light that
gleamed from the splintered pine, fell on the
figures of the robbers, who were half-armed,
their steel-caps and breast-plates clasped, but
in coats of buff leather; and between them
minced the dainty form of dame Marguerite,
her head-gear aside; the ringlets, that should

<p>"Here rest we," said Bertran, stopping at
the circular stone, "Here waits thy bridegroom."&mdash;"Where?"
exclaimed Marguerite.&mdash;"Even
where I stand," said the robber;
"and here thou must descend to meet his
embraces."&mdash;"How, in the name of all the
devils, am I to descend," quoth the irritated
gouvernante, "through a hole that would
not admit a weasel?"&mdash;"Noble lady, thou
dost cruel wrong to thy slight form in saying
so," said Bertran; "divest thee of thy superfluous
trappings, and thou mayest defy a score

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

of weasels."&mdash;"Spare my veil," cried Marguerite.&mdash;"It
might be rent by the craggy
stones of the vault," said Bertran.&mdash;"But
my kirtle and tunic&mdash;nay, this is going too
far."&mdash;"Thy knight will love thee best so
disarrayed."&mdash;"But my skirt?"&mdash;"And how
couldst thou with that monstrous skirt, hung
round with pouncet-box, fan, and God knows
what fooleries, make thy way to thy enamoured
knight down such a narrow passage?&mdash;doff
them altogether."&mdash;"Nay, ye have doffed
me of them already, but wherefore those
ropes? I will not be bound."&mdash;"Ay, bound
for ever to thy knight by these ropes, which
thou shalt henceforth call silken cords, that
form the steps of thy ladder of ambition and
desire:&mdash;how should else thy taper waist and
slender limbs be visible to thy knight, who
howls and maddens in his apartment below
to grasp thee?"&mdash;"Bind me, then, if it must
be," said Marguerite, as, winding the rope
round her waist, they lowered her through
the aperture, and then heaving up the flags on
both sides of the hole, held the pine-torch far

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

downwards to watch her reception from her
noble lover.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Marguerite found herself
in a vault of narrow dimensions, of which the
faint gleam of light from above enabled her
only to descry a portion; judging, however,
that a noble and enamoured knight lay captive
in the dungeon, she prepared to address
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The light of beauty, it is said, can irradiate
the darkest prison, and I have heard
troubadours sing that the gleam of their
lady's eyes could pierce even the dungeon's
darkness, in which knights were held captive
by cruel Saracens; how much more then,
noble though enthralled knight"&mdash;a hideous
howl, or rather yell, here burst on her ears.&mdash;"Take
not thy captivity so to heart, noble
prisoner; here is one who will turn thy thrall
to pleasure&mdash;thy chains to&mdash;Oh, God! how
his eyes glare&mdash;this is no knight&mdash;how his
yell appals me&mdash;it is&mdash;it is a demon"&mdash;as a
wolf that was kept in the dungeon for the
purpose of terrifying the prisoners, or perhaps

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

for a more horrible one, sprang at her as far
as his chain allowed him. The shrieks of
Marguerite actually drowned the yell of the
savage. "Take me up! take me up!" she
screamed, "or ye shall be hung from the
highest battlement of your tower."&mdash;"Nay,
is it thus thou flyest from thy bridegroom?"
cried the banditti, laughing at her terrors;
and they continued to repeat in succession&mdash;"Consider
his ancient descent&mdash;his youth&mdash;his
resemblance to thyself&mdash;his wish to clasp
thee to his bosom&mdash;his captivity," till Marguerite,
mad with terror, made a desperate
spring to catch at the hole of the vault, and,
on their raising her from it, darted instinctively
towards the staircase; and half-dressed
as she was, lost not a step, or suffered one
scream to overtake another, till she had
reached the door of the lady Isabelle's apartment.</p>

<br/>

<p>THOSE screams, which might have awakened
the dead, broke the deep trance of one
who was almost so. Paladour had been savagely
flung on the stone-floor of one of the
chambers of the tower by the bandits. The
wound he had received in his encounter with
the robbers had stunned him; it was dexterously
directed at the fracture in his helmet,
which the clubs of the Albigeois had left the
preceding day. Our knight was no hero of
the troubadour's songs, who could fight three
days and nights in his stirrups, sans intermission,
and undergo wounds without pain in
suffering, or difficulty in healing&mdash;he was
mortal both in frame and feeling.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

<p>He had toiled among the Crusaders in
sweat and blood, during the day of which
the Albigeois had reaped the bloody harvest&mdash;his
night had been one of travel,
terror, and weariness. He had joined at
dawn the pilgrims who were assailed by the
band of Adolfo, against whom his lance
had been driven with resistless force, till,
yielding to lassitude, his arm began to
droop, and, his armour pointing him out as
a prey to the robbers, he was borne to l'Aigle
sur la Roche, and, in a state between swoon
and sleep, lay apparently senseless till
awakened by the shrieks of dame Marguerite.
Then a dim vision rolled over his
clouded senses&mdash;he thought himself among
the Crusaders, and struggled to shout his
war-cry, "La Croix Sanglante!" Then came
on that horrid feeling of obtuse pain that
men experience between sleeping and waking,
when they begin to know that they are to
awake in pain, to the recollection of suffering
that has been endured, or the anticipation
of suffering that is to commence.&mdash;Then

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

the distinct recollection of his having been
engaged in a wild adventure for a party of
pilgrims&mdash;of his being struck down&mdash;he
knew not by whom, and borne he knew
not where.&mdash;Last, as if to soothe him into
the belief that all had been a dream, came
the bright image of the lady Isabelle,
"smoothing the darkness of his vision till
it smiled;" when the wild screams of dame
Marguerite burst on his ears. He started
up; then believing it one of those sounds
which might be heard by night and day
with little notice in an outlaw's hold, he
tried with the tossing agony of one in pain
to turn to rest.</p>

<p>Another cry reached his ears. The
sound last heard was, apparently, one that
never issued from human lungs; it was the
howl of a wild animal. The chamber in
which Paladour lay, was one which seemed,
like the rest, to occupy the square of the
tower; but beside the stair which communicated
with all the apartments, there were
others hollowed in the depth of the wall,

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

which, in many similar towers, bear testimony
not only to the masonic skill with
which they must have been constructed in so
rude an age, but to the patience with which
the gigantic race of former days must have
submitted to modes of entering doors, and
threading stairs, that would have puzzled
modern dwarfs.</p>

<p>The howl&mdash;it was no human sound&mdash;was
repeated. Paladour started up, and gazed
round his chamber. The walls were of
unhewn stone, the floor was broken, the
ceiling rudely vaulted; one door visible to
his bewildered eye straightly closed on the
outside, no means appearing of opening it to
the possessor of the apartment; but the
moonlight gleaming brightly through a stone
aperture barred with iron, fell on a niche,
in which there appeared a pointed arch
formed in the wall, and originally intended
for the construction of another door, where
none, however, was inserted, and in whose
shadow stood a shapeless form, that grinned

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

and nodded at the knight some time before
his weakened sight could descry it.</p>

<p>"Art thou man, or fiend?" said Paladour
at last. "I have, methinks, dealt with both;
but thy shape, and the sound thou utterest,
defeat conjecture."&mdash;"I am neither," said the
figure, "though oft I deem I am the latter.
Tell me now the deeds and motions of your
fiend, what be his appetites, the food he
loves, the foul thoughts he dwells on, the
hours at which his howl is heard piercing
human ears and thrilling human hearts."&mdash;"I
know not how to answer such fearful
questioning," said the knight. "Then I will
answer it for thee," said the figure. "My
loved hour is night, my food is torn from the
grave;" and he held in his hand what
seemed horrible confirmation of what he
uttered; "and my voice thou hast heard
before,&mdash;it hath made the boldest hearts in
this tower of guilt quake to their core, and
the murderer grasp at his unsheathed weapon
in his dream&mdash;wouldst thou hear it again?"

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

And by a strong exertion of his chest and
dilation of his mouth, he seemed prepared
to utter another of those fierce howls which
Paladour had heard before. "Thou'lt drive
me mad," said the knight, stopping his ears;
"in the name of all the devils, what art
thou?"&mdash;"Mad," repeated the figure eagerly,
as if grasping at the interpreting sound;
"Mad, ay! that is it: I am a mad wolf;"
and with hideous grimaces and wild leaps
he bounded towards Paladour. The wounded
knight had no defence to make; yet he half
rose from his couch of stone as if to grapple
with the fearful being who approached him,
when the latter suddenly stopped and exclaimed,
"Do you not see I am a wolf?&mdash;look,
examine me." A strong gleam of
moonlight darting through the aperture, disclosed
the form of the horrible querist. It
was that of a human being, low and
coarsely formed; his beard and hair almost
concealed his countenance; something like
a wolf's skin was wrapt about him, and his

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

hand held too evidently the proof of his demoniac
appetite.</p>

<p>The knight sunk shuddering back on his
couch. It was evidently a man in the most
horrid paroxysm of lycanthropy, a distemper
now unknown, but well authenticated to
have existed at a far later period than that
of our tale.</p>

<p>"Examine me," said the unhappy wretch;
"I tell thee I am a wolf. Trust not my
human skin&mdash;the <i>hairs grow inward</i><sup id="ref026"><a href="#en026">26</a></sup>, and
I am a wolf within&mdash;a man outward only.
Slay me, and thou wilt be satisfied of the truth.
The hairs grow inward&mdash;the wolfish coat is
within&mdash;the wolfish heart is within&mdash;the
wolfish fangs are within;&mdash;yet, still, here is
the food, and I cannot gnaw it as a wolf
should:"&mdash;and he made the execrable morsel
again visible.</p>

<p>"Sir wolf," said Paladour, gathering
strength and courage for this fearful encounter,

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

and suddenly conceiving a hope that
inspired and augmented both, "dare you
shew me your den?"&mdash;"That will I, gladly,"
said the lunatic; "there be choice morsels
there on which thou mayest feed, and howl
between at the moon, that throws her greedy
beams through the iron grate."</p>

<p>Paladour, shuddering, attempted to rise
from his couch and follow his fearful guide,
as the latter hobbled and capered before him
with hideous imitation of the paces of a wolf.
On a sudden he placed his back to the wall,
and uttered a howl that made the hair of the
knight stand on end. "And wherefore is
that horrid cry?" he exclaimed, stopping his
ears.&mdash;"It is to scare other wolves from my
den," said his companion; "for, wot ye, there
be many in the clifts of this steepy rock:"&mdash;and
he pointed to the various stories of the
tower (for they were now on the stair) with
a distinctness that shewed, though his intellect
was destroyed, his observation and memory
were unimpaired.</p>

<p>Paladour, though unacquainted with the

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

horrors of the haunted chamber, into which
he had been purposely flung by the bandits,
began to conceive that the dreadful secret of
this wretch's lycanthropy was closely kept
and employed as an engine of terror by the
chief; he also conceived that this unhappy
being was probably conversant with all the
secret passages of the tower; and from these
circumstances he derived new hope and heart,
having such a fearless spirit that he would
have followed the fiend himself to the rescue
of the lady Isabelle. Weak and wounded as
he was, he leaned against the wall, and, summoning
a quick apprehension and invincible
spirit to his aid, he demanded, in terms suited
to the perverted capacity of his miserable
companion, whether these wolves did not
sometimes prey on lambs, and whether there
were not some prisoners of that harmless
breed immured in the tower?</p>

<p>"Thou wottest well of the wolves that
tenant here," said the wretched being. "I
heard lambs bleat far&mdash;far above me this
night;"&mdash;and he pointed with strong gesture

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

to the upper story, thus designating the prison
of the lady Isabelle. "But what of
them? there be morsels below to feast the
palate of a prince. Come with me and feed."</p>

<p>"So will I," said the knight, "an' thou
first show me the lambs that were seized to-day,
and are held in this fastness."</p>

<p>A wild laugh burst from the maniac as he
pointed, with frantic gestures, upward and
downward the stair. "There," he howled,
"is food for thee and me. Wilt thou come
and feast? Above and yonder is another
feast prepared. Wot ye, here we are all
wolves; and some feast on the dead, and
some on the living. Which will ye feed on?&mdash;choose
ye."</p>

<p>Paladour saw the necessity of humouring
the wretched being, and, though he
recoiled at the effort, replied:&mdash;"Sir wolf,
thou hast doubtless a grudging towards the
choice morsels in thy den. I will not contend
with thee for them: thy fangs and
claws might soon make me repent my daring."
Here the wretch shivered and mowed

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

with horrid delight. "Now, sir wolf, show
me but where the prey lies which hath fallen
into other clutches, and I will not disturb
thy repast."</p>

<p>The cunning, rabid appetite, and eager
malignity of intelligence displayed in the
features of the lycanthrope at this moment
defy all power of description. He was evidently
proud of his secret, anxious to betray
it, fearful of being imposed on, and longing
to partake of his own fearful food undisturbed.
After a short pause, obeying the
most powerful of these impulses, and glancing
a downward look on his <i>den</i>, he motioned to
the knight to follow him, and trotted with
his horrid ambiguity of motion up the dark
and narrow stair. The knight followed.
His fearful guide paused suddenly, and made
a motion to Paladour to follow his example,
while he thrust his face through a crevice
between the stones of the wall, and withdrew
it in a moment. Paladour applied himself
to the crevice, and saw an object which
made him gaze with soul and eye; nor could

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

he withdraw what might be called the <i>grasp
of sight</i>, till the wretched being muttered to
him, "Thou hast thy prey!&mdash;may I feed
on mine undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"Accursed brute!" said the knight, "feed
on what thou wilt; howl where thou mayest;&mdash;but
begone!"</p>

<p>With a faint howl the lycanthrope disappeared
down the stair. The knight remained
rivetted to the spot. The crevice
between the stones of the wall, in a place
where they were unshrouded by tapestry,
gave him a full view of the interior of the
apartment: it was that to which the lady
Isabelle had been conducted, and which we
have described as furnished with all the rude
magnificence that a robber's hold could afford.
The group within might have indeed fixed
a less anxious gaze than that of Paladour.</p>

<p>The lady Isabelle sat on a low seat covered
with tapestry; her splendid habit was deranged,
and her fine hair floated on her
shoulders, and, descending far lower, seemed
to supply the place of her silver-tissued veil

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

that lay in a heap beside her. Pride and
terror, anger and supplication, passed across
her beautiful features, like storm and sunshine
over a landscape in autumn; but pride
predominated still: there was a trembling
dignity about her, that seemed intended
rather to impress the idea of power than to
be conscious of it herself; her cheek was as
pale as that of the dead, but her eyes were
burning with a light, that even fearfully
contrasted that paleness.</p>

<p>A little behind her stood her damsels,
trembling as much at their lady's emotion
as at the cause of it, towards which
their eyes, like hers, were directed, and
grasping the folds of her mantle, with an
attitude that seemed as if they sought at
once to give and receive protection. In a
corner of the apartment stood the figure of
the outlaw, in an attitude between defiance
and alarm, his features inflamed with intoxication
and fierce passions, yet awed by the
sight of beauty in despair, and struggling to
hide from himself and her that he trembled

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

before his own victim, and that victim in
his power. It seemed that the lady, by her
broken respiration, had but just ceased
speaking, but had been unheard amid the
screams of Marguerite; louder than those
rose the voice of the incensed outlaw.&mdash;"Haughty
lady," he cried, "remember thou
art in the talons of the eagle, who never
pounced on prey that he resigned."&mdash;"Slave
and villain," said the incensed beauty, trembling
with passion and terror; "such
another word, and these walls that enclose
me shall prove my grave. Thank Heaven
they are hard enough to dash this slight
frame into atoms before thy very sight!"</p>

<p>A laugh of rude derision burst from the
outlaw; but his inflamed eyes menaced more
than scorn, and he seemed advancing to fulfil
their threat. The damsels shrieked. At this
moment, a slight but determined movement
of the lady Isabelle (who half-started from
her seat), her compressed lips, and the fixed
and fearful bending of her eye on the walls
of her prison, made the bold outlaw shrink

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

before her. At the same moment, a sound
was heard that seemed like a groan heaved
from the bosom of a giant; it was followed
by a shock that made the strong walls ring.
It proceeded from Paladour, who, maddened
by the sight of danger he could not avert, and
of indignity he could not avenge, uttered a
groan of agony, and fell in the full weight
of his heavy armour on the spot where he
stood.</p>

<br/>

<p>OUR wandering tale now returns to the
Deacon Mephibosheth, who had set out in
pursuit of the dainties promised by De
Verac, which were as apocryphal as Sancho
Panza's islands and earldoms. For a weary
day did the deacon pursue this scentless
track, leaving literally no stone unturned to
find the partridge, pasty, and marchpane,
promised him in those deceitful visions.
Often and high did he rear his nostril, expecting
ever and anon to be treated with
that delicious flavour which was to exhale
from the viands to which his imagination
attached such luxury of enjoyment. "Journeying

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

with this intent," the deacon was alike
surprised and disappointed, when, at the close
of evening, he found himself bewildered amid
a labyrinth of rocky hills and glens, which
drove him from the thoughts of his expected
repast, to the more immediate consideration
of how he might effect his return to his party.</p>

<p>At this moment, which, considering the
state of the country, might have proved a
trying one to a man of more metal than the
deacon Mephibosheth, his ears were greeted
by the sound of the feet of mules or horses,
and that of human voices, and still more by
the conviction that, from the slowness of
their pace, and the tranquillity of their tones,
the travellers were men of peace. A few
moments after, emerging from behind a hill,
rode forth two men on mules and one on
horseback, who seemed debating of their
way, and who agreed finally to refer it to
the first traveller they might meet. The
deacon caught the names of the places as
they spoke, and along with them a knowledge
both of where he himself was, and of

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

his capacity of being their guide.&mdash;"<i>Quem
qu&aelig;ritis, adsum</i>," said he, suddenly appearing:
"I know the place you wot of, and will
guide you thither, on well assurance of my
safe conduct, it being parcel mine own way."&mdash;"This
guide must be trustworthy, forasmuch
as he greeteth us in Latin," said one of
them.&mdash;"Do as thou hast said, brother, with
speed, for the night is closing in."&mdash;"Nay, take
me with you," quoth the deacon, "the labourer
is worthy of his hire. I have fasted all day
in this desert, and lack refreshment, such
as, doubtless, those ample bags are stored
with;"&mdash;for this part of their equipment had
not escaped his observation.&mdash;"Marry, thou
hast guessed right, nor shalt thou lack other
guerdon so thou keep touch with us," said
the foremost rider.&mdash;"Touch not, taste not,
handle not," said the deacon; then suddenly
checking himself, he assisted the speaker
to empty the contents of a bag or wallet that
lay on the shoulders of his mule, on which he
fastened with infinite eagerness, the riders
halting the while, and the conversation being

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

strangely divided between their enquiries and
the deacon's late reminiscences and present
occupation. "And how far, sayest thou,
must we fare, ere we reach&mdash;&mdash;?"&mdash;"A red-legged
partridge," muttered the deacon, discussing
a capon, which his imagination was
comparing with the delicious viands promised
by Verac.</p>

<p>"He hears me not," said the horseman;
then raising his voice, "Many mountain
streams cross us in our way?"&mdash;"A tun of
Malvoisie," said the deacon, devoutly applying
himself to a leathern bottle, but still
dreaming of Verac's golden promises.&mdash;"And
who the devil is to guide us across them?"
said the querist:&mdash;"A conger-eel," quoth
the deacon.&mdash;"He is stark wode," said another
rider.&mdash;"He swam up the Seine to
Paris on the back of the king's fishmonger, or
how was it?" said the deacon. "Ah, I remember
me now, it was all a device of Satan's
to lure me into the snares of the enemy, but
I have defied him and prevailed; and lo,
here is spread for me a table in the wilderness."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

<p>So saying, he dispatched the capon, a
huge cheese, and the contents of the leathern
bottle, and then rising with all the
speed his lameness permitted, demanded the
bones of the former, and the skin of the
latter.</p>

<p>"Even wear them thyself as trophies of thy
victory," said one of the riders, "for never did
knight on foughten field earn them more
hardly, or merit them more."&mdash;"Sayest thou
me so?" said the deacon, disposing them in
different parts of his garb, "then shall not they
or thy counsel be cast away. And now, sir
traveller, I am for you, over heath or holm,
glen or rock; through mountain mist, or fog
of the valley."&mdash;"We have a mad guide towards,"
said the traveller, drawing up his
rein; "but how wilt thou, being on foot,
keep pace with our mules, slow-paced as they
be?"&mdash;"All's one for that," said the deacon,
"the path to home lacks half its length to
the foot that treads it, and I shall, perchance,
quit you on the way with some spiritual
dainties for your temporal refection."&mdash;"He

<!-- vol 2 page 277 -->

is a pardoner," whispered one of the party.&mdash;"Rather
a pilgrim, who hath been foundered,
wandering from shrine to shrine," replied his
companion.&mdash;"Whoever he be," said the
third, "he hath promised us safe guidance,
and it is time we put him to the proof&mdash;the
sun is far behind the hills, and the way uncertain,
if not perilous."</p>

<p>The deacon, as he halted beside his new associates,
had full leisure to note their appearance,
for the inequalities and deviations of the track
made him, spite of his infirmity, a match in
speed with the best mounted of the party. The
two who rode on mules were wrapped in
houplands, which hung on the flanks of their
beasts, but under their hoods might be seen
the folds of a monk's cowl: the third, who
was a horseman, seemed to have nothing ecclesiastical
about him, save in the peaceableness
of his demeanour. He wore a dark cassock,
and a short cloak, with a cap of cloth on
his head, but he managed his horse with the
air and spirit of one used to long journeys
and rough encounters with wild roads, and

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

the animal that bore him over them:&mdash;this
was no other than the celebrated Guillaume
de Rusbriquis, whose travels into Tartary
were then the theme of all tongues<sup id="ref027"><a href="#en027">27</a></sup>, and
whose adventures prove that there are no
&aelig;ras in savage life, as at the distance of centuries
it presents just the same picture of the
caprice, insolence, cowardice, and vacillation
that may be found in Lord Macartney's and
Lord Amherst's recent embassies to China, or
Cox's residentship in the Burmhan empire.
With these companions did the deacon set
on, though we will do him the justice to
say that he abhorred the monk's cowl as he
would the devil's hoof, and therefore by no
means suspected of what company he was
the associate:&mdash;"And now I pray you, sir
stranger;" said one of them, "resume your
tale of foreign lands; methinks, while I hear
you, I am presently there myself, which, in
faith, I had rather be by proxy than presence,

<!-- vol 2 page 279 -->

lacking the courage to travel, and the skill to
read."&mdash;"The passages which befell me," said Rusbriquis,
"at the court of the Tartar king, I
have already told."&mdash;"What king saidst thou?"
interrupted the deacon.&mdash;"I said the king of
Tartary."&mdash;"Out on thee for an impostor!"
cried Mephibosheth, "thinkest thou to put
the change upon us with tales and tricks of
Ind and the Antipodes? We have heard of a
king of England, a king of Arragon, nay of
kings of Northern countries, whose names
our language knows not; but who hath ever
heard of that outlandish king thou namest?"&mdash;"Peace,
and let him proceed, thou bold fellow," said
the monk; "I uphold that there
is a king of Tartary."&mdash;"It is a figment," said
the deacon, "shew me such a place as Tartary
in the Scriptures."&mdash;"On leaving<sup id="ref028"><a href="#en028">28</a></sup> the king,"
said the traveller, "I was had into the chief
temple, where the priests were doing service
to their idols: these were small figures of men
and women sorely smutched by reason of the

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

lamps that burn there continually; before
them hung pieces of scarlet cloth, to which
were fastened waxen effigies of various parts
of the body, offered by those whom the idols
were said to have healed, being evil-disposed
in their limbs. Some of these poor heathens
were bowing themselves before the figures of
the idols to the ground, while the priests went
on chanting, or rather moaning, in slow cadence,
their idolatrous liturgy; but what they
said I know not, nor, perchance, would it
have well liked Christian ears to hear them.
Some also were making vows for the recovery
of those who were sick, or the return of the
absent, offering money, flowers, or gums to
the idols; the priests instructing them how
to make these offerings, keeping the money
themselves, and carefully presenting the
smoke to the idols, the silly laics counting
them benefactors for the same, and much
extolling the goodness of these priests."</p>

<p>The monks crossed themselves at this account,
which had a very different effect on

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

the deacon.&mdash;"Now loud thou liest, sir traveller,"
said he, "loud thou liest, as I told
thee at first; thou dost bear us in hand with
tales of Tartarus or Tartary; and lo! thou
tellest of what may be seen in every idolatrous
steeple-house in France at this day."&mdash;"How!
what meanest thou?&mdash;what sayest
thou?" said the three eager voices of the travellers,
in a kind of unison trio.&mdash;"I say that
I will testify against your abominations,"
quoth Mephibosheth: "need we go to Tartary,
or how callest thou it, to witness what thou
tellest us of? have ye not in your churches
muttering priests, a chanted mass, rags and
reliques, vows, pilgrims, penances, and processions;
censers with incense, and vessels of
flowers, and offerings of silver, and offerings
of gold, which ye keep for yourselves, giving
the smoke of your tapers and the smell of incense
to your idols on the high places?&mdash;And
is <i>this</i> idolatry among the paynim folk, and <i>latria</i>
and <i>dulia</i> when practised by monks and
friars?"&mdash;"In the name of all the devils,"

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

cried the monks, "whom have we got for a
guide?"&mdash;"A guide in truth," said Mephibosheth,
"not a guide over mountain and
moor, but a guide that will make the crooked
straight, and cause that your feet stumble
not on the dark mountains:&mdash;I am one that
am raised up to testify against an idolatrous
generation; I am as one appointed to remove
the high places, and to cut down the groves,
and to break in pieces the brazen serpent,
and call it Nehushtan. At the voice of my
crying, Bel shall bow down, Nebo shall stoop,
and men shall cast the idols of silver and the
idols of gold, which they made to worship, to
the moles and to the bats."</p>

<p>Here the monks crossed themselves in horror,
and Mephibosheth, who had an excellent
memory, took advantage of their silence to
repeat the forty-fourth chapter of Isaiah from
beginning to end, without missing a word by
the way. This gave them time to recover
from their amazement, and the first use they
made of their hands, after they had recovered

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

from their uplifted position, was to seize on
the deacon, whom they held fast, without,
however, being determined as to the mode in
which they would express their gratitude for
his exhortation.&mdash;"What means this, my
masters?" cried Mephibosheth, vainly struggling
with them; "why do ye lay hands on
me; will ye rend my raiment? will ye slay
me?"&mdash;"Thou hast, indeed, spoken matters
that should be answered with thy life," said
one of the monks. "By the faith of my order!"
said the other, "he is either an incarnate
fiend, or a heretic, and in either case must
be dealt with: if the one, by a cunning exorcist;
if the other, by those means which the
legate well handled in his <i>Sermo de h&aelig;reticis
comburendis</i>."&mdash;"And is this my guerdon for
your safe guidance?" quoth the unfortunate
deacon; "am I thus quitted for leading you
by the right path where your footsteps slipt
not?"&mdash;"Marry art thou," said Rusbriquis,
who was assisting to tie his hands, "and it
is but doing reason and fair quittance withal.

<!-- vol 2 page 284 -->

Thou hast been their guide in carnal things,
and they will be thy guides in things spiritual;
so follow, Sir Catechumen, with what
stomach you may, for yonder are the towers
of the abbey of Normoutier;" and the travellers
indeed drew near that stately pile of
which the monks were inmates.&mdash;"Stomach!"
murmured the deacon internally, "alas! I
have followed my stomach but too far!&mdash;Ah,
Mephibosheth, Mephibosheth, thy god hath
been thy belly, and a devil of a god he is
likely to prove; better hadst thou fared
gnawing a fragment of goat's-milk cheese,
though it were hard enough to split thy teeth
in splinters, and quaffing whey, though sourer
than all vinegar, than to have gone after their
feast of fat things, and desired their dainty
meats. Oh! for a mess of pottage and a
draught of water as it were in safety, or perchance
a savoury quarter of a kid of the goats,
or peradventure, portion of a stalled ox, or
store of feathered fowls! The Lord rebuke
that prating, vapouring gallant, with his apocryphal

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

conger and legendary venison, thus
to send me a whoring after the flesh-pots of
Egypt, when I might have fed on manna in
the wilderness!&mdash;Behold now I am brought
into captivity, and led unto the death."</p>

<p>They were now at the gate, on which they
smote with their riding rods, and, to the enquiry
of the porter, "Who knocked so late?"
replied, "Open quickly, for we are brothers
Austin and Hilary, with the traveller the famous
Rusbriquis, and a prisoner, of whom we
know not well whether he be heretic or only
devil incarnate."&mdash;"If he be heretic," quoth
the porter, whose voice announced him very
drunk&mdash;"if he be heretic, I will not undraw a
bolt for him&mdash;marry if he be devil, he is dearly
welcome, for we have chosen an abbot of misrule,
the revels are held in the chapter-room,
and we lack a devil for the nonce."&mdash;"Truce
with thy foolery," said the monk; "we bring
thee wine from Beaucaire." No talisman
could sooner have opened the doors of an enchanted
palace in romance, than these few

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

words did the gate of the abbey; and the
monks, hurrying Rusbriquis and the deacon
along with them through a cloister that ran
round three sides of the outer court, flung
open the doors of the spacious chapter-room,
which the brotherhood, in that cold season,
preferred as the scene of their revels to the
vast refectory, where, erewhile, had feasted
the band of the Crusaders. As the doors were
flung open, a sight burst on the eyes of the
astonished deacon that made him for a moment
imagine himself a Daniel summoned to
the idolatrous feast of Belshazzar.</p>

<p>In the absence of the Abbot of Normoutier
the brotherhood had agreed to hold a species
of revel, then not inadmissible within conventual
walls, had elected their abbot of misrule,
dispatched missives in search of lemans and
costly wines; and the relaxed character of the
abbot gave them little cause of fear that their
frolic, however it might pass the bounds of
decorum, would transgress the limits of his
patience. The scene disclosed by the opening

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

doors surpasses all power of description.
In this monastic masquerade some had assumed
the habits of classical, others of scriptural
personages, and all appeared preparing
for a dance, however dissonant their characters
or unassociating their costumes might be.</p>

<p>They were all arrayed in dresses which,
whether appropriate or not, were wildly fantastical,
and even exaggerated into a kind
of frantic extravagance, and the faces of most
of these revellers were covered with gilt visors,
which, concealing all resemblance to the
human countenance, diffused a strange and
horrid glitter over their featureless faces;
their language, too, was a squeak or gibber,
and their dialogue, carried on rather by
gestures than by words, seemed a kind of diabolical
short-hand. Torches, held by the lay-brothers,
who laughed, however, too heartily
at this metamorphosis to hold them quite
straight, shed a red and smoky light on the
wild group of these clerical masqueraders;
and in a corner others were holding back the

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

dogs belonging to the abbey, who, terrified at
the strange appearances around them, would
have flown at them unless withheld, and
whose ceaseless barking made a kind of concert
with the general uproar of this monastical
festival&mdash;their eager eyes, pointed heads, and
the stretched arms, and the encouraging voices
of their young exciters, making no bad background
to the painting. "Now Heaven protect
me!" said the unfortunate deacon, "that
these fiends tear me not in pieces!&mdash;alas! I
am finely holpen." The abbot of misrule,
who was distinguished by his tinsel mitre,
crosier, and ring, and a superior portion of
extravagance and absurdity in his vestments
and gestures, demanded of the travellers who
they were that sought admittance to the
solemn rites he was about to celebrate. "Two
poor monks of the order of St. Benedict,"
answered the ecclesiastics, "who return from
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Bacchus of
Beaucaire;" and they produced the well-filled
skins that testified the success of their mission.&mdash;"Relics
of value in truth," said the

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

abbot, "and that shall be meetly enshrined
ere long," as he stroked his ample paunch at
sight of the wine; "and whom bring you to
this our cloister of misrule?" "I am Guillaume
de Rusbriquis, the famed traveller," said Rusbriquis,
entering into the spirit of the revel; "I
have journeyed from pole to pole&mdash;have helped
the sun to go on horseback in the east,
and held his stirrup when he alighted in the
west&mdash;have been shipwrecked in the frozen
ocean, and anchored on the back of a kraken,
deeming it to be the main land. Marry,
if ye doubt the truth I tell, here is my fellow-traveller,"
pointing to Mephibosheth, "who
came by this halt in his gait from sojourning
overlong in the land of Antipodes, and
wholly forgetting to walk on his feet."&mdash;"He
speaks brave matter," quoth the abbot, "and
must needs be a traveller by his lying;&mdash;and
thou who standest shivering and groaning
there, art thou what he delivers thee?"&mdash;"I
am one," said the deacon, "who am led
captive into a strange land, and sit down to
weep by the waters of Babylon."&mdash;"There

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

thou liest," said the abbot, "for there is not
a drop of the waters of Babylon in the abbey
or its neighbourhood: we know no such
strange wines&mdash;take heed, fellow, for I do
grievously suspect thee, from thy speech, to be
as it were an Albigeois, in which case there
were no more words but to hang thee; yet,
that thou mayest perceive we are a merciful
lord abbot, dance a-round with us, and it
shall be thy purgation."&mdash;"Surely I will not
dance," quoth the deacon, whose courage rose
with opposition; "it is an abomination more
befitting the daughter of the harlot Herodias
than a deacon of the holy congregation. All
dancing is evil, very evil, exceedingly evil,
and not good&mdash;but to dance in the tents
of Kedar and the tabernacles of the idolaters,
to be set up on high among the ungodly,
and dance in the high places, were an
utter abomination:&mdash;wherefore I say, Down
with the filthy squeaking of pipes, and the
lewd jarring of crowds<sup id="ref029"><a href="#en029">29</a></sup>, and&mdash;"&mdash;"So please

<!-- vol 2 page 291 -->

you, my lord abbot," said one of the monks,
"let us drown this peevish fellow's noise, and
cause him to dance with us:&mdash;your true sour
heretic (and your lordship perceives he is no
better, though I shame to name such vermin
before your lordship) needs no other martyrdom
than the sight of free honest mirth."&mdash;"Thou
sayest well," said the abbot; "he shall
dance and die the death of the spleenful:&mdash;for
the rest, let such of the nine worthies as be
sober, lead forth Deborah, Judith, and Queen
Dido&mdash;the three children in the furnace shall
dance with Nebuchadnezzar to make up their
old grudge&mdash;Susanna shall pace with one of
the elders, and the Goddess of Chastity with
the other&mdash;ourself, the Abbot of Misrule, will
lead the lady of loose-delight, with her paintings
and her pouncings, her mincings and her
mockings&mdash;and the heretic shall dance with
the devil, and there is a company meetly
sorted. Strike up, my masters."&mdash;Here the
hapless Mephibosheth was seized on by a hideous
figure enveloped in a black garment,
with cloven feet of flame colour, a tail that

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

swept the ground, a mask equipped with
"eyes that glow and fangs that grin," and a
huge pair of horns starting from the forehead.
All his struggles availed nothing with his
frightful partner: he was dragged into the
circle, compelled to perform numerous pirouettes,
which were more remarkable for velocity
than grace, and if he relaxed for a moment
in his exertions, a swinge of his partner's
tail, a kick of his cloven foot, or a blow with
his horns, set him prancing again with pain
and terror till his strength was exhausted, and
he fell to the ground. At this moment the
cook was seen entering the hall, attended by
the lay-brothers groaning under the heavy
dishes they bore, and shouting in unison the
monastic chorus&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">Caput apri defero,<br/>

Reddens laudes Domino;<br/>

Qui estis in convivio,<br/>

Plaudite cum cantico.</p>

<p>The revellers instantly surrounded the tables,
covered with delicious fare; and flagons of
the choicest wines; and down sat pagan gods,

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

Christian martyrs, devils and angels, promiscuously.
Susanna pledged the elders, while
they could undergo her challenge&mdash;Queen
Dido did reason to St. Dennis for France, in
potations deeper than those Virgil describes
her indulging in when she feasted &AElig;neas&mdash;the
three children in the furnace prayed to sit
near Niobe&mdash;and Moses and Satan, observing
they were the only persons of the drama who
were accommodated with horns, agreed to sit
together, and, to the vast amusement of the
group, instead of carving, tore up a pasty that
was before them with their horns.</p>

<p>"Fast and furious" waxed their mirth, till
in a pause of laughter that had threatened to
be inextinguishable, one of the party demanded
whence that groan had issued?&mdash;"It is a
sigh breathed from a hole in a vessel of clay,"
quoth the disconsolate deacon, who sat panting
on the floor after his involuntary exercise,
and wistfully gazing on the feasters.&mdash;"Yea,
and a lame broken vessel," said Rusbriquis&mdash;"And
an empty vessel, I trow," rejoined the
abbot,&mdash;"how sayest thou, heretic?"&mdash;"It is

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

even so," said the deacon; "and I pray you,
since I am become a by-word and mock, let
me eat a morsel of savoury meat, and drink a
cup of wine, lest I become like them that go
down to the pit."&mdash;"By the mass, well prayed
and in good season," said the mock abbot:
"thou hast been as Daniel in the den of
lions, but now thou shalt be as Daniel in the
palace of the king of Babylon, and shalt
think scorn of the water and pulse thou feddest
on in thy peevish mood, and raw perverse
nonage."&mdash;The deacon hesitated not to
accept the permission, and in a moment the
humour of tormenting their prisoner was exchanged
for one of feasting him: his trencher
was filled with the choicest morsels, and his
cup oft and mischievously replenished with
wines, of whose power he was as ignorant as
of their flavour.</p>

<p>The persecution thus disguised had its full
effect; the good wine "did its good office
soon," and the revellers with triumph perceived
the increasing intoxication of the sullen
heretic, who, preaching between every

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

mouthful, and hiccuping between every word,
presented a spectacle of maudlin gravity, uncouth
hilarity, zeal truly without knowledge,
and eloquence without the power of speech.&mdash;"Thou
wilt chant a roundelay, or a hymn
to the Lady Venus now?" asked Rusbriquis.&mdash;"Yea,
that I will, to be conformable," quoth
the deacon: "any thing in conformity, and to
do reason."&mdash;"And thou wilt dance a round
with us, if need be?" asked the abbot.&mdash;"Surely
I will dance," said Mephibosheth,
"that is, in the way of comfort to the weak;
I will dance, yea, dance very exceedingly&mdash;so
that it shall be said hereafter, his dancing is
as the dancing of Mephibosheth the deacon,
for he danceth furiously;&mdash;but only in the way
of comfort, mark ye me&mdash;otherwise not
a grice, though fat bulls of Basan closed me
in on every side."&mdash;"And thou wilt whisper a
love-tale in a fair leman's ear?" said another.&mdash;"Why,
there it is," said the deacon, with an
ineffable leer, "I yield it that thou hast me
there; I was always the lovingest soul, and
could skill of music in my youth; but away

<!-- vol 2 page 296 -->

with these vanities!&mdash;Hold, fellow! I meant
not the trencher and cupful of new wine&mdash;Tell
not me of fair women: if thou wilt pledge
me in a cup of wine, so,&mdash;if not, would all
the women in the land kept their own counsel
and were sober&mdash;As for me, tears have
been my meat day and night"&mdash;and he burst
into a violent fit of drunken grief, which was
drowned in the shouts of laughter, that rose
on every aide. All gathered round him assailing
him with invitations to eat, to drink, to
dance, to sing, in the same moment, while
others called as loudly on him to preach, that
they might be converted by his doctrine: then
their passions changing, they began to revile
him; curses and foul terms were heard on
every side, and those who were distant began
to throw fragments of the feast at him. This
moment completed the distraction of the unfortunate
deacon!&mdash;his senses reeled, his perceptions
became confused, he saw false colours,
and mistook one object for another&mdash;he
answered the curses with a vacant laugh,
and reviled those who still jested with him.

<!-- vol 2 page 297 -->

At length his habitual reminiscences, struggling
with this temporary delirium, he snatched
the huge knife from the hand of the
sewer, and exclaiming, "I will break down
the carved work thereof with axes and hammers,"
began to demolish the figures of the
saints with which the abbot's chair of state
was richly and beautifully wrought. In a
twinkling, St. Lucia once more lost both her
eyes, the head of St. Dennis dropped from
under his arm, where he was carrying it; and
the Abbot of Misrule himself narrowly escaped
a blow that clove his mitre in twain&mdash;"Bel,
bow down; Nebo, stoop, I say," shouted
Mephibosheth, redoubling his blows, "for I
am he who will bring the idols low, and will
purge this house of Baal, and make it a draught-house
unto this day;" and at the same moment,
with unlucky dexterity, he flung two
massive goblets at the painted windows,
which missing not their mark, left the gorgeous
and costly compartments in shivers.</p>

<p>The horror with which the monks beheld
an act they deemed sacrilege, kept them at

<!-- vol 2 page 298 -->

first motionless; but, recovering themselves;
they rushed on the deacon, and holding him
fast, looked round them in an impotence of
rage, that knew not how to vent itself&mdash;"Accursed
wretch!" said the abbot, who first
found breath, "vile heretic, and worse than
an infidel! what have thine excommunicated
hands done?&mdash;but thou shalt die the death."</p>

<p>The deacon, but half recovered from his
delirium, gazed with lightless eye and vacant
face around him.&mdash;"How will the abbot chafe
when he sees the spoils of his goodly seat,"
cried he of Misrule, holding his cloven mitre
with both hands,&mdash;"and the defeature of those
glorious windows, the pride of the houses of
God in all Languedoc," rejoined the monks.&mdash;"This
it is," said Rusbriquis, "to seek to
tame a wolf, and have your fingers bitten off
for your guerdon."&mdash;"To death with him!"
cried a hundred voices at once, amid which
the abbot's was heard loudest; and the only
question was now what punishment was
adequate to his crime. The mode of dealing
with heretics was summary as it was cruel

<!-- vol 2 page 299 -->

then: it was suggested to fling the wretched
Mephibosheth into the enormous fire that
burned on the hearth, and which might have
consumed Goliath, while two or more held a
huge bar of iron across the aperture, lowering
or heightening it to prevent his escape, while
his tortures admitted of the possibility of his
making the attempt. This horrid proposal
was negatived only by the abbot's remarking
that the screams of the victim would disturb
them at their revel.&mdash;"Let his tongue be first
plucked out," said one of the monks.&mdash;"And
how shall we purify the chamber&mdash;this
chamber royal in our palace of misrule, from
the noisome smell of burning bones!" said the
abbot&mdash;"foh! we do amerce thee in a cup of
wine, for giving such unsavoury counsel to
thy liege,"&mdash;"Let him be flung from the
highest tower of the abbey, and let the hogs
feed on his carcass as it lies i' the court," said
another.&mdash;"The night is over cold to stand
shivering on the battlements of the abbey
tower," objected the abbot; "and he who
rises betimes to see the hogs at breakfast,

<!-- vol 2 page 300 -->

breaks the first law of our realm of misrule,
which sets forth that all its loyal subjects
must be a-bed at noon, and a-foot at midnight;
wherefore, my censure is, that we
hang up the heretic <i>curia sedente:</i>&mdash;yon grimly-carved
visage that frowns from the ribbed
arch of the door shall serve for gallows; his
partner in the dance shall howl him a black
santis for shrift; and with so many knaves
in the convent, it were hard if a rope were
lacking for the nonce."</p>

<p>This sentence was received with acclamation,
probably because it promised the enjoyment
of witnessing the prisoner's death without
quitting their seats; and the rope was provided,
flung over the giant-visage that projected
with an ominous frown over the arch
of the door, and held strongly on the other
side by two brawny lay-brothers, before the
hapless deacon understood for whom this
fearful note of preparation was sounded.&mdash;"Wherefore
am I led unto death?" he cried
with a ghastly gaze; "look to it, and mark
well what you do, for my blood will be required

<!-- vol 2 page 301 -->

at your hand."&mdash;"Is the rope well plaited?"
said the abbot; "look that ye put forth
all your strength, and wince not for his struggles."&mdash;"Hold
yet for a space," said the deacon,
"for a moment, hold!&mdash;ye have made me
drunk with new wine; ye have caused me to
speak unadvisedly with my lips&mdash;cut me not
off in my transgression; grant me a space to
cry for mercy; destroy not soul and body,
spare me for a moment." His lips grew horridly
white, and he wrung his damp hands.&mdash;"The
confessor we have appointed thee,"
said the abbot, beckoning to the hideous
figure that personated the devil, "will rightly
handle the texts concerning thy departure,
and expound to thee the promise of thy soon
encounter with him. Wherefore delay ye to
knit the rope?"&mdash;"It is knit and cast," answered
the hoarse but jocular voices of the
executioners. The doomed wretch, flinging
himself on his knees, and seeming to grow
to the paved floor (for no force could rend
him from it for a space), poured forth in his
despair all the dreadful denunciations against

<!-- vol 2 page 302 -->

blood-shedding contained in the Jewish law,
accompanied with strong additions of his
own.&mdash;"Cursed be the men of blood!" he
cried, "cursed be their wrath! for it is cruel&mdash;may
the avenger of blood overtake them
while his wrath is warm, and may the city of
refuge be far from their path! Cursed be they
with the primal curse, the curse of the first
sinner out of Paradise, who was a murderer!
Cursed be their morning, for its breath is
groaning, and cursed be their evening, for
its dew is blood! Cursed be the earth that
shakes beneath them, and cursed the heaven
that frowns on them!"&mdash;"Depart, cursing and
accursed," said the abbot, "and con over thy
blasphemies with him from whom thou hast
learned them."</p>

<p>The rope was twined round the neck of
the victim, the executioners pulled with
their full strength, placing each one his foot
against the clustered pillars of the door.&mdash;Some
of the revellers had the cruelty to hold
a torch full in the face of the victim. There
was a slight convulsion, a brief tremor, a

<!-- vol 2 page 303 -->

gush of perspiration that dyed face, neck, and
hands of a livid hue; the next moment the
rope broke, and the deacon fell on the floor
apparently lifeless. He was raised instantly,
and there was a kind of sportful strife among
the assistants.&mdash;"He is dead," said one; "he
is not dead," was the reply. "How can
he be dead when the rope has scarce left
a mark on his neck? Can mere imaginings
work so strongly, or hath the rope done its
office sooner on him as a heretic?"&mdash;"Ye
know nought," said Rusbriquis, "of the
flittings of life in extremity, toward and froward,
like a flame hovering on and off the
wick of a lamp;&mdash;and still less wot ye how
habituated savours will cause the vanished
soul to return to her dwelling like a bird
to its spray, when limed with such sweet
poison&mdash;for a proof," applying the savour of
a richly-composed dish to the nostrils of
the deacon, whose associations immediately
testified the power of the luscious condiment
and the sagacity of the traveller. He
sneezed, opened his eyes, and extended his

<!-- vol 2 page 304 -->

hand towards the dish as if instinctively.&mdash;"Look
that the rope be stronger, and that ye
ply it well," said the abbot; "this heretic fox
shall yield us sport at another chase."&mdash;"Lord
abbot," said Rusbriquis, who, if not more humane, was
at least more considerate, "may
not this fellow, who seems a leader in this pestilent
heresy, deliver some secrets touching
them that may prove a ransom for his worthless
life? Men say that Raymond of Toulouse
is again in France, and that the Crusaders
have fled before him."&mdash;"Thy counsel is
good," said the mock abbot, "such report hath
reached us, and I would give my mitre to
hear how our jolly abbot hath fared in the encounter:
perchance his mitre hath been
found of as brittle matter as ours&mdash;Speak,
fellow, for thy life, and divulge to us what
thou knowest?"</p>

<p>This injunction was repeated several times
to the stupefied deacon before he could hear
or understand it; but when he did, in that
agony of mind which makes the pretenders to
religion set a frantic and exaggerated value on

<!-- vol 2 page 305 -->

<i>that</i> life which it was their habit to speak of
with lofty disregard, he eagerly offered to disclose
important matter, if <i>his</i> were spared.&mdash;"Important
matter," said the abbot, "we list
not to hear; our royaume of misrule prizes
but two commodities&mdash;old wines and youthful
paramours:&mdash;touching the former we count
thee ill-provided, for, perchance, thou hast
never till this night tasted it;&mdash;for the latter,
thou may'st win mercy by being our purveyor&mdash;speak
for ransom of thy life: knowest
thou a heretic damsel worthy of a churchman's
love?"&mdash;"In all the land," said Mephibosheth,
"there is no woman so fair as
Genevieve, the daughter of Pierre the pastor&mdash;of
all the daughters of men there is none
to compare with her for comeliness and wisdom,
for gracious favour and goodly gifts."&mdash;"And
canst thou win this priceless demoiselle,
to share our reign of Misrule with us?"
said the abbot.&mdash;"Of a truth," gasped the deacon,&mdash;"the
women and the weak ones journey
in the van, and it may be that I may
lead, if life be spared, where they can be

<!-- vol 2 page 306 -->

found, and, peradventure, led away into captivity
even as the Syrians went out by companies,
and took away a little damsel who
waited on Naaman's wife."&mdash;"She shall minister
to Naaman, not his wife," quoth the abbot;
"and on such condition do we spare thy
life; but mark me, heretic, that life depends
on its fulfilment.&mdash;Doth thy accursed creed
allow of an oath to bind thee withal?"&mdash;The
unfortunate wretch uttered an oath the most
tremendous and inviolable, and in so doing
fell prostrate and exhausted again at the feet
of the abbot.</p>

<p>His swoon did not interrupt their festivity
long, but several days elapsed before the fever
that was the consequence of the terror, agony,
and excitement of the unfortunate deacon,
enabled him to undertake the accomplishment
of his promise, by leading a band of monks in
the direction he had indicated.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE danger to which the unprotected
females of the Albigenses were exposed,
from this meditated assault, was tenfold increased
by circumstances that had since
occurred without their knowledge, or even
that of their persecutors. The Bishop of
Toulouse seized, with prompt hand and
watchful eye, the moment when the hopeless
state of Count de Montfort, (who still lay
at the castle of Courtenaye in a state of stupor,
his wounds healing, but his faculties and
physical power totally annihilated,) and the
dispersion of the Crusaders, in the equally
hopeless pursuit of the lady Isabelle, left a

<!-- vol 2 page 308 -->

powerful disposable force of men-at-arms in
his hands;&mdash;the Countess de Montfort, herself,
compromising her jealousy of her husband's
honour in her zeal for the cause, and
giving up the command of those she led to
the bishop, while Sir Aymer promised his aid
the moment he was able to bear his armour,
and sit his war-saddle (and his influence was
too extensive to be despised), and the vassals
of de Courtenaye were armed, and impatient
for action. He seized, moreover, the
opportunity to direct and dispose of this force,
by representing to the court of Rome that the
cause had been ruined in France by the madness
of the champion of the Church, and the
ascetic apathy and inoperative neutrality of
the monk of Montcalm; that the reins dropt
so suddenly, by an unskilful and desperate
hand, must instantly be seized by a powerful
and active one, or the race would be run
and the goal won by the antagonist. He
prayed forgiveness of the holy father for
his over-confidence in the measure of putting
himself at the head of what remained of the

<!-- vol 2 page 309 -->

crusading army in Languedoc, in terms that
rather courted praise for his courage, than
pardon for his temerity; and ere it was
possible that his couriers could have reached
the Vatican, the bishop had placed himself
at the head of all the men-at-arms,
who still sojourned in the castle of Courtenaye,
or its neighbourhood, and set forth
against the retreating army of Count Raymond
of Toulouse. Such were the terrors
that impended over the heretics: but of these
they were as yet ignorant. On the night following
that of the further retreat of the Albigeois
into the fastnesses of the mountains,
Genevieve, with trembling heart and limbs,
after the pastor had composed himself to rest,
sought the cave where the wounded Crusader
lay. The path was so intricate and tangled
that she had less to fear pursuit or detection
than the possibility of retracing her steps
again; and to have seen her slender form and
delicate limbs, as she struggled through entwining
weeds, matted brushwood, and interlaced
and slowly disparting branches of trees,

<!-- vol 2 page 310 -->

and then tremulously placed her slender foot
on the stony path which often betrayed it,
one might have imagined her a banished
oread or dryad tremblingly haunting the
scene of her former sylvan existence.</p>

<p>Through all obstructions, however, her
slender form and resolute will made way: she
reached the cave&mdash;she raised the thick foliage
of wild ivy and clematis that embowered its
entrance&mdash;she entered, but there was no one
there&mdash;no trace even of the wounded knight,
no fragment of armour or shred of scarf or
plume showed he had ever been an inmate
there. She paused for a moment in amazement
not unmixed with terror, and both were
increased by observing the entrance of the
cave darkened by the figure of a man who approached
her&mdash;it was Amand. He did not
speak, but he gazed on her intently, and a
smile which she trembled at, severed his lips
for moment&mdash;"What hast thou done?" she
said fearfully&mdash;"Oh! what hast thou done
with the wounded knight?&mdash;Where have you
borne him&mdash;or is he indeed yet alive?"&mdash;"Canst

<!-- vol 2 page 311 -->

thou misdeem of me as that voice
would imply?" said Amand, with impassioned
reproachfulness&mdash;"I cannot behold aught pitied
by thee that I do not pity, or aided by
thee that I would not aid. Last night I lingered
behind thee to bear the wounded knight
to fitter shelter;&mdash;I pulled the leaves for his
bed, and bound his wounds, and spread my
own garment over him where he lies;&mdash;but,
oh! Genevieve, I felt two hearts in my bosom.
I could," he added, "even while I bore his
body in mine arms, have dashed it against
the rock, when I thought of the look with
which thou didst gaze on it last night."&mdash;"Alas!"
said the maiden, shrinking from his
vehemence, "tell me, at least, where you have
borne him, that I may myself minister to him&mdash;men
tend not men with that gentleness that
women can&mdash;nor do ye bear those thousand
waywardnesses which break from a spirit
galled with the body's sufferings; nor know
ye to invent and apply those petty cares
and nameless comforts that are to the sufferer
more than the drugs of many skilled

<!-- vol 2 page 312 -->

leeches."&mdash;"I doubt not thou wilt be a tender
nurse," said Amand sullenly; "but are there
none to be tended among thine own people,
that thou seekest to minister to an alien and
idolater."</p>

<p>"If I tend the afflicted of mine own people,"
answered Genevieve, "what do I more
than others? but if I bind up the wounds of
the enemy of my faith and my life, that faith
alone can supply the motive&mdash;or the reward."&mdash;"Thou
deceivest thine own heart, Genevieve,"
said the youth, shaking his head; "but though
thou canst not deceive me, thou canst overcome
by thy pleadings. Better were it for
man never to contend in words with woman,
for she will prevail by that sweet wilfulness
that makes reason a mock to itself; so I will
lead thee where lies this wounded knight, and,
oh! may he inflict on his leech no hurt more
deadly than those thou canst heal!"</p>

<p>He beckoned her to follow him as he spoke,
and Genevieve followed trembling, anxious
and silent, to a deeper recess in the woody
glen than she had hitherto explored. "Why

<!-- vol 2 page 313 -->

dost thou pause?" said Amand abruptly as they
reached its darkest part; "the object of thy
care is here,"&mdash;he flung back the boughs that
closed: and she found that Amand had not exaggerated
his good offices. He had removed
him to a deserted hut, such as the shepherds in
mountainous regions erect during the summer
season, and leave on the approach of autumn,
when they drive the flocks lower into the
valleys: it was concealed from the Albigenses
by the approach being thickly matted with
brushwood and weeds, and was provided
within with a heap of dried leaves, and a
woollen garment. Stretched on these lay the
body of the young knight; and Genevieve saw
with gratitude, that the long and clustering
hair had been cut away from his forehead,
and that the wound he had received was such
as to cause deep stupefaction without peril
either to life or reason: that on his bosom
caused still less alarm, for Genevieve was
mistress of all the vulnerary medicaments of
the age, and, presaging hopefully of his recovery,
she applied salves and bandages to both,

<!-- vol 2 page 314 -->

(the patient giving no signs of existence save
faint tossings and low mutterings), and then
implored of Amand to conduct her to the
same spot every night, till the wounded youth
was restored to his strength. "Genevieve,
thou triest me too hardly," said the young
Albigeois, sternly; "I have done more than
man hath ever done&mdash;I have borne more than
man&mdash;more than I can bear; I have seen
thee, when I parted to mortal fight, tearless&mdash;I
have seen thee weep over mine enemy and
thine."&mdash;"It is so sweet to save an enemy's
life," murmured Genevieve.&mdash;"An enemy's,
indeed!" said the jealous youth. "If the
pale and pleading beauty of those light locks
and pearl-like skin won thine eye, even when
he lay as one dead before thee, how will they
seem when he appears before thee in all the
loveliness of life, blushing with gratitude
and blessing his preserver? Then, deluded
maiden!&mdash;then will his enmity prove most
perilous and most deadly!"</p>

<p>Genevieve, alarmed by his agitation, but
wholly unconscious of its cause, averted her

<!-- vol 2 page 315 -->

head in silence; her pure heart suggested
to her but one motive for her compassion,
and she was unable even to comprehend
those which were alluded to by Amand.
Her gesture was mistaken by him: he imagined
she was dwelling in cherishing silence
over the picture he had drawn, and he passionately
exclaimed, "This is the last night I
will visit this spot with thee!"&mdash;"Then I must
visit it alone," said the maiden.&mdash;"And wilt
thou dare to visit it alone?" said Amand.&mdash;"I
dare do aught but neglect a life left to
my sole tendance:&mdash;if thou <i>canst</i> desert me,
I will win my way as I may; yet thou wilt
regret thou wast not here to aid me with thy
better strength, and, perchance, to smooth
that rugged path to my bleeding feet."&mdash;"And
wouldst thou wish, wouldst thou suffer
me to be present at thy meeting with this&mdash;stranger?"
cried Amand, his jealousy half
dictating, half forbidding the question.&mdash;"Alas!
did I not solicit it?" said Genevieve,
in the simplicity of her heart. Amand made
no answer but by twining her arm in his

<!-- vol 2 page 316 -->

and, as he led her away, muttering between
his closed teeth, "Thou most tormenting,
delicious being! thy simplicity sometimes
showing like subtlest art, and thy sole art
being true simplicity&mdash;thou canst do aught
and all thou wilt with me, making me slave
to my very victim,&mdash;and," glancing back at
the spot they were quitting,&mdash;"perchance a
victim to my very slave!"</p>

<p>From this period, the visits of Genevieve
to the wounded knight were unremitting;
and her care was at length rewarded by seeing
him in safety, though unable either to
recognize or thank her. Every evening it
was her task to conceal part of the provisions,
which, from the liberality with which they
were now supplied, could be done without
detection&mdash;to prepare her simple materials
for dressing and binding his wounds&mdash;then,
as twilight was fading into night, to steal
forth to his retreat, watching every sound,
and shrinking from every object, till she
gained the spot, and, with broken respiration
and palpitating heart, sunk on the floor beside
her patient; then to apply the food to

<!-- vol 2 page 317 -->

his lips, to chafe his numbed limbs, to attempt
to add ease to his posture and comfort
to his retreat, repaid her for all danger and
weariness, till the few moments that she could
allot to her visit had elapsed, and she hasted
to return, trembling, but glowing; anxious,
but elated. The contemplation of this visit
became a dream of delightsome anticipations
all day, and its performance the cherished
solace of the evening.</p>

<p>That delicious picture of secret contemplation&mdash;that
"joy of its own which the
heart knoweth and a stranger doth not intermeddle
with"&mdash;that hidden treasure which we
retire to contemplate and sum in secret with
a miser's joy and a miser's jealousy&mdash;is above
all the enjoyments that ever were generalized
by participation, or weakened by diffusion.
Could mortal eye have beheld them, they
would have presented a sight like that described
in lines of mystical and magic beauty,</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 318 -->

while Amand stood the sullen, jealous sentinel
of these moments, ever warning Genevieve
that they had elapsed almost from
their commencement&mdash;ever menacing her
with the consequences during their hurried
return, and often withholding his aid from
her faltering steps, in jealous waywardness
of spirit. Meanwhile, the damp confinement,
and want of all accommodation suited to his
state, delayed the perfect recovery of the
knight long beyond the time that his youth
and vigour promised, and in spite of the skill
and assiduity of the leech; and it was not till
the fourteenth evening of her visits that her
patient seemed to evince some touch of consciousness,
and feebly to attempt to discover
and thank his visitor. That night an autumnal
blast had strewed her path ankle-deep
with leaves, which heavy rains had converted
into mire; the roof of branches had been torn
off the hut, and Genevieve trembled as she
approached it, lest the storm should have
disturbed the sufferer. To her astonishment
she found him with both faculties and speech

<!-- vol 2 page 319 -->

restored, and anxious to be led forth into the
light even of the frowning and stormy heaven,
murmuring, as he tossed on his bed of
leaves, that nothing could restore his health
but the free open air of heaven.</p>

<p>"And thou shalt breathe it, if mine arm
have power to support thee," said Genevieve.&mdash;"Is
it the touch of mortal or spirit that I
feel pressing my burning brow with such
delicious coolness?" answered the knight;
"it feels like a wreath of fresh flowers
around mine head."&mdash;"Angels do not now
visit the desert," said Genevieve, "as they
did in the days of holy men of old: our sins
have banished those heavenly visitants;&mdash;it
is a mortal who supports thee."&mdash;"If I
may judge by the clear music of thy voice,
and the silky softness of thy touch," said the
youth, "doubtless one of a noble race."&mdash;"Of
the very humblest of fallen mortality,"
answered Genevieve, with a firm sadness:
"a peasant maiden; one to whom a noble
knight would blush to owe a courtesy, and a
Crusader would think it foul scorn to be indebted,

<!-- vol 2 page 320 -->

even for life." She spoke with deep
emotion; for, by the stronger light, as they
approached the rude aperture that served for
door, she recognized in the wounded knight
the youth who had preserved her the night
she had been seized on, and she anticipated
the effect which the disclosure of her birth
and religion must have on a knight and a
Crusader. "I understand thee," said the
knight: "thou art of that unhappy faith
which&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Which teaches me, wherever
good can be wrought, or mercy shown, not
to pause to ask who is my neighbour," said
Genevieve, forgetting that this scriptural allusion
was probably lost on the hearer.&mdash;"Thy
faith, whether true or false," said the
knight, smiling faintly, "owes me somewhat,
even the preservation of a fair female heretic
from the assault of ruffians, who menaced
not, in truth, her life, but might have left
her nought to prize in the life they spared.
Mine arm," he added, reclining on the support
of Genevieve, who proffered it more
tenderly than ever&mdash;"mine arm was stronger

<!-- vol 2 page 321 -->

then; yet still, I think, it could fell to earth
aught that approached with touch of maculation
that holy beauty"&mdash;"Dost thou remember
her?" said Genevieve, in a voice
scarce audible; "could a peasant damsel
fling such spell over the memory of a noble
knight and a Crusader?"&mdash;"On my bed of
leaves," said the youth, "that vision was with
me. Oh, so lofty was her demeanour&mdash;so
sweet and thrilling her voice&mdash;so purified and
earth-abstracted the whole saintly vision,
that I have sometimes thought an angel
had descended among the heretics and worn
her form, to win them back to heaven!
Now, mock me if thou wilt, damsel; but
in my wanderings I have often thought
that a voice like hers breathed in my ears&mdash;that
a hand like hers smoothed my
bed of leaves&mdash;that <i>she</i> was with me in my
lonely wretchedness."&mdash;"She was with thee,
she is with thee, she thanks, she blesses her
preserver, but never, never can she repay
him." And, as she spoke, Genevieve threw
back the hood that had hitherto concealed

<!-- vol 2 page 322 -->

her features, and the full glory of that face
to which earth had given its noblest modulation,
and heaven its holiest character and
expression, burst on the eyes of Amirald.</p>

<p>He gazed on them intently for a moment,
then clasping his hands, attempted to bend
his knee in the attitude of worship, but his
strength failed in the effort, and he fell prostrate
at her feet. Terrified at this prostration,
which she ascribed to his weakness,
Genevieve was attempting to raise him,
when the voice and eager gestures of Amand,
who was rapidly descending from a hill, announced
to her that not a moment was to
be lost. Genevieve, accustomed to these
pulses of terror, caught the hand extended
to her, and casting one look of regret behind
her, followed Amand, till her failing steps
and broken respiration made him pause from
compassion, which she had not breath to
solicit. "There is danger and disaster in
thy speed," said his panting companion at
length, "nor dare I ask what it is this fearful
haste announces."&mdash;"Men say that the

<!-- vol 2 page 323 -->

Bishop of Toulouse approaches with a mighty
host," said Amand hastily, "and messengers
have come from Count Raymond, commanding
that the women and the children be sent
farther into the mountains till this evil be
overpast; and half I rejoice," he added in a
voice of constrained passion, "at these hasty
and fearful tidings, for now must thou see
this stranger no more, nor shall mine eyes
waste in their sockets beholding your meetings;
ere morning, distance and deserts will
be between you."&mdash;"But that will not deprive
him of thy aid?" said Genevieve: "Now
know I of an assured surety, that thou wilt
not desert him, for never was good deed
coupled with peril but it seemed lovelier in
the eye of the brave."&mdash;"Thy flattering
words win me not," said Amand obdurately;
"I fear the wrath of the congregation because
of him. Shall I become an Achan and a
troubler of the camp for this stranger,
because his favour is fairer than mine?
Knowest thou not, that they who aid
our enemies in any wise are cursed with a

<!-- vol 2 page 324 -->

curse?"&mdash;"It is vain for man to curse what
God hath blessed," said the maiden; "there
is a prior and unwritten law of love and
mercy in thy heart, Amand, which thou
mayest neglect but canst not efface; what is
enjoined in that law? how readest thou?"&mdash;"I
see how it fares with thee," said Amand,
his eyes flashing with a fire visible even in
the increasing darkness of twilight&mdash;"I see
how it fares with thee; thou hast loved
strangers, and after them wilt thou go.
Neither distance nor danger, impassable paths
nor the terrors of night, the prayers of thy
friend nor the wrath of thy people, can avail
to withhold thee from forsaking the guide
of thy youth, and forgetting the covenant of
thy God."</p>

<p>Affrighted at his violence, and wounded
by his reproaches, Genevieve forbore to plead,
and at this moment the murmurs of many
voices in various accents of alarm, grief, and
anxiety, announced to her fresh cause for
concentrating her resolution, and banishing
all cares but those of meeting the present

<!-- vol 2 page 325 -->

emergency. It was a night of tumult, terror,
and distress to the unfortunate Albigenses,
the feeble and female part of whom were
preparing, on the approach of night, and
amid the stormy gloom of autumn, to penetrate
farther into the mountain fastnesses,
and seek amid the haunts of the wolf and
the bear, that shelter which was denied them
in the abodes of man. Their progress, however,
was checked by another messenger from
Count Raymond, requiring that all the males
capable of bearing arms should immediately
repair to his camp, as the forces of the Crusaders,
headed by the Bishop of Toulouse,
were fast approaching, and threatened to intercept
all communication between him and
the advanced body of the Albigenses. This
order, with which it was indispensable in the
present exigency to comply, completed the
despair of the unfortunate women, as it deprived
them not only of guides and protectors
in the "howling wilderness" they were
about to traverse, but of those to whom they
were entwined by every tie of nature and of

<!-- vol 2 page 326 -->

passion: husbands took brief and sad leave
of wives, and parents of children, committing
them to Him, whom they invoked to
be their pillar of flame in the desert; and the
cries of warlike preparation and solemn intercession
were heard on every side, mingled
with the wailings of unappeasable mothers,
and the ceaseless moan of scared and wearied
infancy. Amid the tumult, Amand invented
a thousand causes of delay (for which his
courage was not overpraised), till his topical
knowledge, eminently serviceable amid scenes
like these, where wild and perilous exigencies
were to be encountered only by as wild
and perilous expedients, had enabled him to
recognize a spot where his adventurous step
had often scaled alone, and where no force
of man could reach those who had obtained
access to it. It was a perpendicular rock
which closed the extremity of the gorge or
ravine, which they had reached in their
dismal progress: it was ascendible only on
one side by a stony path broken by many
interruptions; and this path, which wound

<!-- vol 2 page 327 -->

like a natural stair to the summit, was so
overshadowed by bowery plants of laurel,
and genistum, and weedy tufts of lavender,
and thyme, and ivy, that tapestried all the
rock, as to be invisible to all eyes but those
of the restless pursuer of Nature into her
deepest loneliness. On the summit there
was a level space of considerable extent, in
front of which the rock rose like a parapet
or the battlements of a castle, and above
towered another clothed with fir and pine,
its summit presenting a chance of escape or
shelter even to those to whom this fortress,
hewed by Nature's own hand, should prove
not impregnable. The moment Amand
pointed out this retreat, Genevieve implored
him no longer to delay hasting to
join the forces of Count Raymond. Amand
viewed her with a doubtful eye and a bitter
smile, and then hastened with the utmost
exertions of his strength, and the most
fearless risk of his own safety, to conduct
her companions to the summit. Genevieve
was last; as he aided her to ascend, he

<!-- vol 2 page 328 -->

whispered, "One word, only one word with
thee."&mdash;"Aid the feeble and those who need
thee," said Genevieve, trying to ascend without
his assistance,&mdash;"Thou <i>shalt</i> hear me,"
said the impetuous boy, grasping her arm.&mdash;"Well,
then I must," replied the maiden
trembling; "but what is it thou wouldst
say?"&mdash;"For thee," said Amand, in a choked
and agonizing voice, "for thee have I perilled
life, soul, and what I value more, thank thy
new creed of chivalry for the lore."&mdash;" I understand
not thy words," said the affrighted
maiden.&mdash;"Understand this, then," replied
Amand; "I have perilled my life to find
shelter for thee, for what step but mine could
have scaled this rock? I have perilled my
soul, for I have concealed thy backsliding
from the congregation, who would have burnt
thee with fire had they known that thy
pity had watched over a Crusader; and I
have perilled more than both, for I have
been as a coward in the eyes of men and of
women, to find a place of safety and shelter
for thee; and mine eyes are opened and I see

<!-- vol 2 page 329 -->

that valour is all that women prize in man,
and, in yielding me a coward, and one that
shrunk from the battle, I have done that
for which thou owest me dear recompense."&mdash;"Thy
words bewilder me," said the maiden:
"an evil and troubled spirit seems to speak
from within thee; I pray let me ascend this
steep."&mdash;"Not a grice till I have named my
recompense. I am going to perish in the
desperate battle, from which thy late remorse
cannot save me: for all I have done, for all I
shall yet do, if action be available in this life,
or intercession effectual in the other, grant
me but this&mdash;promise that thou wilt visit
that stranger no more."&mdash;"Surely I will
not promise it," said Genevieve, "for in so
doing, I should sin against mine own soul."
As she spoke, Amand seized her arm, and
hurried her up to the summit of that terraced
rock, without speaking a word or remitting
his speed for a moment.</p>

<p>Genevieve stood at last on the summit,
panting and tottering as he released her&mdash;"Thou
wilt not promise?" he repeated in a

<!-- vol 2 page 330 -->

voice scarce articulate; "Genevieve, I and
the stranger are on a precipice&mdash;one of us
must be flung from it to save the other&mdash;shall
it be I, or thy minion?&mdash;choose while a
moment's choice is allowed thee." The blast
of a horn, floating far on the hills, was heard
as he spoke; it was the signal for departure:
all the fires of hell seemed to blaze in his visage,
as exclaiming, "Thou wilt <i>not</i> speak, then
the choice is mine," he darted from the cliff,
and was lost to her sight in a moment. This
moment was one of exquisite anguish to Genevieve:
she began, for the first time, to fear
that she had carried her gratitude to the
Crusader too far; and her imagination tormented
her with the fear, that this gratitude
might be exposing him to dangers greater than
those she had saved him from; but her feelings,
never habituated to dwell on <i>self</i>, found
speedy and ample employment in soothing
the terrors and hushing the murmurs of her
hapless companions. No situation could indeed
be more desolate than theirs: perched
like hunted birds on a bare rock, which,

<!-- vol 2 page 331 -->

though it afforded concealment, gave no
shelter; deprived of their guides and protectors,
uncertain how long their absence
might continue; and trembling lest the event
of another hour might make it eternal, these
unhappy women had still an aggravation of
their sufferings&mdash;the want of that excitation
that had now become the habit of their existence,
the food and fuel of their hearts&mdash;the
want of the prolonged evening exhortation,
the choral hymn, the enthusiastic anticipations
of their final triumph, and, not less welcome,
the denunciations of prophetic vengeance
against their enemies; the agony of
prayer, the simultaneous spreading out of
hands, as if to take heaven by storm; the
accordant murmur of a thousand voices, like
the rush of mighty waters; the pause more
awful than that human thunder in its loudest
bursts&mdash;the want, in effect, of all that forms
to weak but susceptible and highly-excited
minds, what may be called the drama of devotion,
and stands in place of the usual employments
and relaxations of life, which the

<!-- vol 2 page 332 -->

enthusiast is compelled by his creed to resign.
The want of this pressed sore on the
wearied and dejected spirits of the helpless
women.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Genevieve,
who had often been accustomed to give the
word of exhortation in the absence of the
Barbes, and always to lead the hymn, in
which her voice, whether in supplication or
in praise, seemed to "sing at heaven's gate,"
suggested to her companions the seasonableness
of fervent prayer. She reminded them
of the night when Paul and Silas prayed and
sung praises in a dungeon; and during the
holy conflict, <i>every man's chains were loosened;</i>
they acquiesced, and the holy maiden burst
into a spontaneous effusion, that was in truth
more like the outpouring of the spirit on the
handmaids, than words uttered by "mortal
mixture of earth's mould;" but among her
trembling and heartless auditory, there was
no voice, nor any that answered: one was
intent on hushing a wearied infant, another
on tending a sick one, many were shivering

<!-- vol 2 page 333 -->

with cold, and all with terror; some were
stupefied into dumbness and apathy, and
those who could yet feel or speak, felt or
uttered but one wish, "Would God it were
morning." With such a congregation, a
Miriam must have failed; she might strike
the chords of inspiration, but there was no
daughter of Israel to follow her in the song.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>She sung, they found no comfort in her song;<br/>

<p class="right">MONTGOMERY.</p>

</div>

<p>Repulsed, but not wearied, she turned to
the children, and soothing some by caresses,
and calming all by the tones of a voice whose
speech was music, she succeeded in diffusing
a momentary tranquillity among the most
querulous; the wearied children at last slept;
their mothers slept also. Genevieve seized
this moment to examine what possible defence
their present dreary position offered: she saw
that the rock, a natural breast-work, rose as
high as the battlements of a castle in front of
the terrace they occupied; and she observed
that several of the stones which formed this

<!-- vol 2 page 334 -->

parapet were loose, many of them having fallen
from the cliff above; and others being retained
in their place only by the weeds that
mantled between the apertures, and the clay
and sand which rains had swept from the
upper cliff and lodged in the numerous interstices,
and might therefore prove a means of
defence, or at least of desperate menace,
should they be assailed from below. While
thus occupied, her failure in that eloquence
of consolation and inspiration of prayer, which
had so often soothed and elevated the congregation
to whom, in such moments, her face
was as the face of an angel, struck her with
melancholy force; and she shed a few tears
less for the loss of her powers, than for the
privation that loss must cause to others.
"Perhaps," said she, "it is a just rebuke to
my spiritual pride; I, who sought to be a
mother in Israel, must learn to be mute and
helpless: but <i>Thou</i> who canst give waters in
the wilderness, though thou hast dried up
this brook, thou canst cause the stones
of these rocks to cry out, the floods of the

<!-- vol 2 page 335 -->

valleys to clap their hands, the trees of these
mighty forests to break forth into singing, and
the very stars in their course, though they have
neither speech nor language, to cause a voice
to be heard among them." Thoughts like
these, solemn as the hour and pure as its light,
began to visit her soul; her meditations became
more intense, her thoughts more elevated&mdash;she
gazed upwards, and wondered at
her fears and weakness. Before the power
whose visible agency surrounded her on every
side, all other power shrunk into nought;
before the thoughts that filled her soul, all
other thoughts or cares seemed a profanation
and vanity; one bright gleam of consolation
rose on her after another, as stars arise in the
night, till her whole soul glowed within her,
and her mind became as resplendent with
internal light, as the midnight heaven was
with the numerous glory of all the stellar
fires. In this holy frame, amid peril and privation,
in a desert, and at midnight, she sunk
into a slumber that seemed like a continuation
of the rapt and trance-like mood that

<!-- vol 2 page 336 -->

had preceded it&mdash;the same visions hovered in
it, and she felt, as she reviewed their images,
like a traveller who looks on the same landscape
in sunshine and in twilight. From this
slumber she started with the feeling of one
never accustomed to rest long, or to awake
in safety, and perceived her companions already
roused. It was day-light, but a heavy
mist hung on the mountains, and lay like an
ocean in the valleys; sounds of steps were
heard approaching, but the thickness of the
vapour rendered those sounds obtuse and
confused, while it prevented the possibility of
their discovering who were approaching. All,
however, agreed in encouraging each other to
believe they were friends; while each concealed
in her heart a fear that contradicted
her expressions; but when the mist yielded
gradually to the increasing light, the figures
of the deacon and of a few others mounted on
mules, and wrapped in long cloaks, appeared
at the foot of the precipice.</p>

<p>GENEVIEVE gazed on the former with
amazement, as he eagerly recognized her,
and testified by uncouth gestures his pleasure
at the interview. "If the mountain
mists, or the spirits who are said to raise and
rule them, have not abused my sight," said
she, "thou art Mephibosheth the deacon."&mdash;"Of
a truth am I damsel," said the deacon,
"and I pray thee to tell me how I may climb

<!-- vol 2 page 338 -->

up to thy place of strength, which is unto
thee as the high hills to the goats, that so
I may speak words of counsel and of comfort
unto thee."</p>

<p>"Thine absence hath been so long, and its
cause so strange," said Genevieve, "that I
would rather first hear what thou hast to
tell, and whether thou comest as friend or
foe,"&mdash;"Surely, as a friend," said the deacon,
"and, 'as a brother is born for adversity,'
so come I to warn thee of peril thou
mayest best avert by submission, not by
defiance; for, behold, the man whom they
call the Bishop of Toulouse, is come up
against ye, and he vaunteth of his strength
and of his mighty deeds, and he saith of
Beziers and Carcassonne and all fenced cities
where the brethren fought and perished,
'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad,
and of Sepharvaim?' "</p>

<p>"Thou dost well," answered Genevieve,
with holy indignation, "to borrow thy menace
from the mouth of that idolatrous king, who

<!-- vol 2 page 339 -->

in his arrogancy, threatened not man but
heaven. Remember also the answer given
to him, and take it for mine&mdash;to Him who
inspired that answer of old, to Him who can
inspire it even now, I refer thee&mdash;even Him
who in one night turned the host into dead
corses, and caused him to perish in the
house of his idol gods, and by the hands of
those whose parricide, while it punished his
guilt, filled up the measure of their own:
but for thee&mdash;for thee, Mephibosheth, whose
lips should have kept knowledge, who
should have been a stay to the weak, a
shelter to the weary&mdash;how shall I read thy
words aright, or believe, indeed, it is thou
who utterest them? "&mdash;"Even as thou
wilt," said the deacon&mdash;"yet to thee they
are words of truth and of safety. Can the
rock afford thee shelter, or can it give thee
food? Wilt thou abide there till thou famish,
till the vultures peck at thee and the bears
howl round thee, and thou faint for lack of
water? Behold, a city of refuge is open to

<!-- vol 2 page 340 -->

thee&mdash;even the Abbey of Normoutier, where
thou shalt eat of the fat and drink of the
sweet, and whither I, even I, am come to
lead thee. Wherefore should women delight
in the sound of the trumpet and the alarm
of war?"</p>

<p>"Mephibosheth," said the maiden, "I
ever held thee earthly and sensual, but now
do I deem thee devilish; for surely, unless it
be a minister of the evil one who is permitted
to assume thy form, thou speakest words
which befit none but his servant. Wast
thou a master in Israel, and is such thy counsel
to the daughters of the captivity?"&mdash;"Where
is the confidence wherein thou trustest," said
the deacon, abashed and incensed at the
firmness of a woman contrasted with his own
apostacy and vacillation: "I tell thee, those
who have built their nest in a rock, have
been humbled to the dust, and shalt thou be
delivered? The mighty and the eloquent have
been abashed and put to silence&mdash;a Moses
hath erred with his lips, an Aaron hath
yielded to the sin of the congregation, and

<!-- vol 2 page 341 -->

shall a Miriam alone strike her timbrel and
sound praises to her own constancy and courage?
Daughter of pride, come down and
sit in the dust: thou shalt be like one of us&mdash;thou
shalt be weak as we are. Bow, ere the
golden sceptre is changed for the rod of iron."</p>

<p>"It shall crush me in pieces first," answered
the maiden; "even on the timid
ears and failing hearts of women, thy base
eloquence of fear hath failed of its power.
From their hold of the rock, from where they
battle with the eagle for his eyry, and with
the fox for his den, women defy and despise
thee. But oh, Mephibosheth, what depth of
scorn must she feel, what bitterness of reproach
should she utter, who rememberest
what thou once wast! Is it <i>thou</i> who comest
to snatch away the support of Aaron and
Hur from the uplifted arms of the prophet,
even though thine own being depends on
their being upheld? to make the wheels of
our chariot drive heavily, when thou shouldst
lay thine utmost strength to the load?&mdash;to
trouble the host, when thou thyself shouldest

<!-- vol 2 page 342 -->

be first to show the lamp and blow the
trumpet, and shout, 'The sword of the Lord
and of Gideon.' "</p>

<p>The deacon shrunk before the voice, the
attitude, the inspired beauty, and the sacred
eloquence of the young prophetess; for such
she appeared.</p>

<p>"The truth is with her," said he, retreating
among his companions; "and I cannot
contend with or prevail against it."</p>

<p>"On again," said one of the monks of
Normoutier; "or we will goad thee on with
our spurs and riding-rods to the assault."&mdash;"On,
on," repeated the rest, "and seek how
we may climb to this den where the heretic
wolf hath hid his mate and her young. An'
thou lure not down that bird of the rock,
whose note is so much braver than her
plumage, and teach her other song ere long,
thou art but a lost deacon."</p>

<p>Thus urged, the unfortunate deacon once
more approached the rock, at the foot of
which the monks were exploring the traces
of that concealed path which we have before

<!-- vol 2 page 343 -->

described. "Hear, ye wretched women,"
cried Mephibosheth, "deliver up this damsel
to us, with the young maidens of your company,
and we will depart; but if ye will not,
we will heap up the ling and the dry heath,
the fir-tree and the pine-tree together, and
cause the flame thereof, and the smoke
thereof, to go up even to your hiding-place,
that ye be consumed and perish," At these
words, Genevieve looked round on her companions,
her features radiant with the light
of pure perfect confidence. With horror, she
perceived there was no animating answer of
a corresponding expression. The dejected
and dismayed women looked on their children
and then on each other doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Are ye mothers?" cried Genevieve: "do
ye clasp children to your bosoms, and those
children daughters, and can ye hesitate? Oh,
fling me rather from the spot where I stand,
a crushed and breathless mass of horror at
their feet, than even think for a moment on
the alternative. Your crime will not be so
great, and my suffering will be far, far less.

<!-- vol 2 page 344 -->

But ye do not think of it&mdash;ye cannot," she
cried, raising her voice. "No&mdash;tempter&mdash;no;
all here are women, women in soul as in sex;
and to those who have either soul or sex,
such crime were impossible and unnatural!"</p>

<p>The women excited by her appeal, testified
the revulsion of their feelings by a shrill
and piercing scream of defiance. "What,
are there none but women in that nook,"
cried the loose monk, who had acted the
Abbot of misrule, "and stand we at the foot
of the nest, to hear the hen-birds crow in
our mere defiance; up, up and seize them
where they stand. Thou, deacon of the
damned, ordained by Beelzebub himself, shalt
climb first, and look thou show some tricks
of thy old vocation in skipping from rock to
rock like a chamois; we shall be nothing
slack to follow, and leave these tough hens
not a youngling to cackle or ruffle for." As
he spoke, the monk made good his word,
springing at hazard up the precipice, followed
by his companions, dragging the
wretched deacon along with them.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 345 -->

<p>The monks were vigorous and active:
they calculated every step of their perilous
ascent with steady eye, sprung with light
foot, and grasped with firm hand, while the
deacon, after one or two premonitory suspensions
over a crag, where his companions held
him half in mischief, half in mockery,
bounded upwards with a speed that justified
his persecutors in urging him to it, and displayed
an excess of grotesque activity in the
effort, at once ludicrous and terrific.</p>

<p>Genevieve saw their progress with terror
that concentrated her resolution. "Hear
me," she cried, "hear me at peril of your
lives! Look up at these masses of rock, so
mighty that their fell must crush the children
of the Anakim; so lightly poised as to yield
to the touch of the feeblest woman. Advance
but another step, and as He liveth
in whose might I trust, and in whose spirit I
speak, they shall crush your bodies into fragments,
that the vulture shall utter a famished
shriek as she passes by them."&mdash;"Hear me,"
cried the gasping deacon, "thou Zipporah;

<!-- vol 2 page 346 -->

thou Athaliah! Art thou unsexed; wilt thou
be zealous unto slaying?"&mdash;"Unsexed men
make women forget their sex also," cried
Genevieve: "when the protector turns the
oppressor, the unprotected forget aught but
their safety; and thou shalt feel, that woman
in the cause of her faith and her honour is
mightier than man assailing them."&mdash;"Of a
verity I will not advance," said the deacon:
"was not Abimelech, that mighty man of
valour, slain under the tower of Thebez, by
a stone cast by a woman?"&mdash;"On, thou losel!"
cried the monks: "thou mightest as well
heave the Abbey of Normoutier from its
foundation with thy little finger, as the
slender arms of that damsel lift those rocks
from their base." They ascended, and came
near. "Now God aid me in mine extremity!"
said Genevieve, applying herself to her
task: "your blood be on your own heads,"
she cried; while the united strength of her
companions, joined with hers, shook, loosened,
and finally detached, the vast masses of stone,
which, bounding, smoking, and rattling from

<!-- vol 2 page 347 -->

crag to crag, dragging with them a forest of
crashed boughs and brushwood, and sending
before them a cataract of splintered rocks,
and fragments of stone, trees, and clay, thundered
into the valley, and sent their echoes
far and wide among the mountains. With
dizzy horror, Genevieve gazed on the downward
progress of the ruin, and beheld, almost
with a sensation of joy, the monks escape
with miraculous dexterity the fate that
threatened them, and stand trembling beside
the course of that stony torrent as it flashed
and thundered through the ravine.</p>

<p>They had brief space to congratulate themselves
on their safety, for at this moment
another danger menaced them. A large body
of the Albigeois appeared on the summit of
the opposite hill, and the terrified females
caught an omen of hope and safety from
their speedy return. To shout in joyful unison
with their cry, to dart into the valley,
and send a score of arrows after the fugitive
assailants, who plied spur and riding-rod
amain, was the work of a few minutes; and

<!-- vol 2 page 348 -->

as they sped through the valley, their eager
gestures and increasing shouts testified they
had been the witnesses, and were the intelligencers
of some welcome event. The tidings
they brought were as joyful as they were important.
The Bishop of Toulouse had, indeed,
put himself at the head of the remains of the
crusading army, but the military followers of
the fallen Crusaders had deserted almost
universally, as was the custom of the age,
when they were no longer commanded by
their individual leaders; every man making
his best speed to gain the territory or castle
of his fallen or wounded lord, and leaving
the bishop to meet the Count of Toulouse at
the head of troops flushed with recent victory,
with a band of unorganized and disarrayed
vassals, instead of men-at-arms. King
Philip besides, who on the throne of France
trembled at the power, character, and views
of the ambitious prelate, refused to recognize
him as champion of the Church in place
of Simon de Montfort, till his title was admitted
by the court of Rome. The missives

<!-- vol 2 page 349 -->

from Rome were hourly expected, but the
bishop not brooking the delay, and hoping
to awe both the King of France and the
Pope by the promptitude of his movements,
and the rapidity of his success, had forced
his diminished army through the mountain
passes, and encountered so severe a check
from the advanced troops of Count Raymond,
that he was compelled to retreat again towards
his episcopal castle and city of Beaucaire,
and there await aid from the Crusaders.
The way was thus left free for the
movement of the females and children towards
Arragon; but the Count had, in the
mean time, been apprised that the King of
Arragon had been excited to strong hostility
against the Albigeois, by the missives of the
bishop; and stimulated by the exhortations
of the preachers who outnumbered and outvoiced
the military men of his host, he
entertained the hope of again becoming the
lord of his native territories, establishing the
heresy, as it was termed, within the walls
of Toulouse, and rebuilding Carcassonne and
Beziers.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 350 -->

<p>To effect this work, the preachers, amongst
whom the foremost were Mattathias and
Boanerges, assured him a day of fast and
supplication was necessary; and to this, after
their more favourable intelligence had been
communicated, the party came to summon
and conduct the females, whom it was no
longer necessary to keep at a distance from
the main body.</p>

<p>According to the habits of the community,
a summons to a solemn act of humiliation
and fasting was deemed, even by the females,
like an invitation to a festival.</p>

<p>Not Deborah uttering her inspired song
to a host of triumphant warriors, not Judith
calling the elders of Bethulia to the gate to
witness the event of her daring deed, felt
more pride than these females, lately so
persecuted and bewildered, when they heard
of the solemn assembly which they were
about to join under the protection of their
relatives, and in the security of brief tranquillity.</p>

<p>Genevieve alone, who retained in a memory

<!-- vol 2 page 351 -->

rendered more faithful by the energy of her
character, and the intensity of her feelings
even when a child, the images of the horrors
of Beziers and Carcassonne, shuddered at the
thought of the desperate effort to establish
the rights of the Count of Toulouse, and the
exercise of the persecuted faith in his territorial
city; and while she joined the train
which now wound slowly and in safety down
the precipice, foreseeing nothing but danger
arising from courage, and calamity overtaking
success, she wished "for the wings of
a dove that she might flee away and be at
rest." She felt, as all that are deeply religious
must feel, that its exercise should be
calm and tranquil, a "communing with the
heart and in the chamber," and a "being
still;" nor was she a little disturbed at the
thought of being produced as the heroine of
her party, for an effort which her habitual
timidity made her almost consider as a
crime, now that her spirits had subsided,
and her mind had lost the high tone it was
strung to in that emergency.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 352 -->

<p>The hints of this had already reached her;
and when, with the acclamations of all the
females, Arnaud placed her on his mule,
while two men-at-arms of Count Raymond
rode beside her, and Amand purposely entangled
his hand in her rein that he might
be near her, she shrunk from their hold,
and whispered her wish to Arnaud.</p>

<p>"It shall not be so," said Arnaud, in
answer, "why art thou disquieted, damsel?
Behold the women shall go before thee with
songs and with dances, and they shall praise
thee with the praise of Jael, the wife of
Heber the Kenite, because thou hast smitten
the enemy by the hand of a woman; also the
old man thy father, behold he is yet alive,
and he shall bless thee with many blessings,
because thou hast been strong and very
courageous for the truth, passing the strength
of woman."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be blessed," said Genevieve;
"for I say to thee, reverend Arnaud, that
one blessing from lips that tremble with affection&mdash;from
lips that perchance may be closed

<!-- vol 2 page 353 -->

ere they utter another, were to me worth
the shout of the congregation, even of a very
great multitude."</p>

<p>Amand, who had not spoken till then, but
walked patiently beside her rein, said eagerly
but whisperingly to her, "Haste then, if thou
wouldst have his blessing."&mdash;"What meanest
thou?" said Genevieve.&mdash;"Nothing: I
mean nothing&mdash;I <i>am</i> nothing, nothing in thy
eyes; but, reverend Arnaud, art thou sure
that the damsel will, indeed, be greeted with
a blessing, even the blessing of Pierre the
pastor?"</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone that made Genevieve
tremble and Arnaud regard him with a
look of consternation. "If it be so," he
added, gnashing his teeth, "may I be accursed&mdash;but
that I am already! Go, go,"
he continued flinging back the rein, "go and
see what blessing awaits thee: go and see if
even Pierre will bless thee."</p>

<br/>

<p>THEY journeyed all that day in safety;
and about its close, their way, winding round
a rock, suddenly disclosed to Genevieve and
her companions a view of the valley where
the Albigeois had assembled on what they
termed their holy convocation, and which the
preachers named the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
It was now evening, and the shadows of the
mountains had struck far into the valley,
shedding the gloom of twilight over the dark
and mingled groups who were assembled under
its shadows. The solemn exercise, which
had commenced with daylight, was still carried
on: those who had breath and perseverance

<!-- vol 2 page 355 -->

for the task were still pursuing it,
and those who had not could yet add their
gasping Hallelujah, or their faint So be it,
to the petition which they could no longer
hear. The valley where the Albigeois were
assembled was one intersected by a narrow
stream, increased by many rills from the
surrounding mountains. Some spots in the
valley were clothed with rich verdure and
vegetation even in Autumn; many more
were desolate and bare: the stony and broken
path that wandered through the valley
was sometimes obstructed by water, sometimes
by broken branches of trees, and oftener
by fragments of rocks that had fallen from the
hills above;&mdash;but wherever a spot was to be
found where two or three might gather together,
there were the pastors, or Barbes,
exhorting and praying; the congregation
bearing audible response, and frequently leading
the devotions they should have followed.
The teachers were as diversified as their respective
groups of listeners: the veterans of
Count Raymond's army, who were of the

<!-- vol 2 page 356 -->

newly-adopted creed, enforcing it on their
hearers with all the authority of established
preachers, yet sometimes finding that authority
shaken or questioned by some young
champion in the lists of theology. Thus
amid the centre of one group was to be seen
a mailed warrior, his helm and visor doffed,
his grey beard floating over his armed chest,
his hand on a parchment scroll containing
the New Testament, explaining it to a group
of hearers; while all his allusions and analogies,
according to his own construction, were
drawn from the Jewish Scriptures;&mdash;while a
beardless youth, cased in arms, would hold
deep controversy with him, till the distracted
audience knew not how to decide between
the young Daniel come to judgment, and the
masters in Israel, who were charged with
not knowing these things. In another group
the Barbes were seen with their woollen garments,
their hoods resembling those of monks
and their long beards: these were more dogmatical
and imperative than their lay coadjutors.
They hushed every murmur, permitted

<!-- vol 2 page 357 -->

no voices to be heard but their own, and
by their powerful intonation, eager gesture,
and denunciatory vehemence, seemed to exercise
as absolute authority over their congregation
as the power which they denounced
and execrated could have aspired to in its
utmost ambition of spiritual domination.</p>

<p>The visages of all these men were marked
with the strongest lines of fanaticism and
military enthusiasm combined. Cowl and helmet,
when withdrawn, showed the same deep
and stern character: some were distinguished
by religious austerity, others by martial ferocity;
but all bore the traces of long and severe
suffering&mdash;all announced wounds of the heart
or of the brain&mdash;all spoke of that hope deferred
which maketh the heart sick, or that terrible
reminiscence of evil inflicted, which
seeks or feels no relief but from the power of
redoubling the infliction on others. Among
them were many whose faces were marked
with a character of deep reflection and indomitable
resolution: not one of them who was
not, from hour to hour, prepared for the loss

<!-- vol 2 page 358 -->

of mortal life, and engaged as frequently in
the most awful questions relating to future
existence. Hovering thus, as it were, between
the living and the dead, they seemed
to look on their earthly tenure with scorn;
and to the future they had familiarized themselves
by the intense and solemn exercise of
all their faculties and feelings on "those mysteries
which Heaven will not have man to
know." So "under the shade they walked;
now solemn stood." These groups were scattered
promiscuously wherever they might
find space; but far above them there was an
ample auditory. The Albigeois, to the number
of thousands, crowded the hills that enclosed
this valley: they sat in patient silence, catching
from time to time the sequel of a prayer,
or a denunciation, and echoing it in voices
that, numerous and distant, added an awful
solemnity to their close; and above them
still were seen the tents of the army of the
Count of Toulouse, hanging like flakes of
snow on the tops of the hills; while low
and dim in the valley burned the lights that

<!-- vol 2 page 359 -->

glimmered from the cavern, where the elders
of the congregation had met to debate on the
projected expedition to the city of Toulouse,
and to bless or ban it, according to their various
views and feelings, whose influence was
permitted an operation which had hitherto
produced but diversity, dissension, and hostility.
Of this, Genevieve had not as yet
been a witness; and the glorious sight which
the first view of thousands of people worshipping
amid rock and mountain, under the canopy
of Heaven, and by the light of the rising
stars, which glow like suns amid those mountain
regions&mdash;the pealing answer of the thousand
voices to a single prayer&mdash;the choral
hymn that woke the echo of a mountain
"seated in hearing of a hundred streams"&mdash;the
glorious and innocent pomp of this primitive
worship, in a temple of which earth
formed the foundation, the eternal mountains
the walls, and Heaven the roof,&mdash;struck
on the high-toned mind of Genevieve, and she
could not help exclaiming: "Such, such was
Israel once, ere God descended to dwell in

<!-- vol 2 page 360 -->

temples made by hands&mdash;even when He was
fitly worshipped in his primeval and heaven-domed
shrine in the wilderness&mdash;when the
sands of Arabia were pressed by the knees
of six hundred thousand worshippers, and
her rocks echoed nightly to the songs that
made them vocal with the name of the Holy
One of Israel. My God, leave to thy people
the Heaven, which is thy throne, to appeal
to; and the earth, which is thy footstool, to
kneel on; and we will not envy the glories
of the Temple, where thy presence descended
in fire on the altar, and thy voice was
heard between the trembling wings of the
cherubim!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, Arnaud led her to the entrance
of the cave, where the Barbes, with
some of the military leaders, were engaged
in prayer, interrupted by eager dispute about
the movements of the host. Barbe and chief
were fiercely at work: text and war-cry were
levelled at each other, as when "arrows
clove arrows in the air, and darkened all the
sky."&mdash;"Nay, let me rest here," said Genevieve,

<!-- vol 2 page 361 -->

glancing a look into the cave, "of
a truth I am wearied and sore-worn; and I
feel somewhat like a presage of evil hanging
at my heart, that I can neither define nor
banish."&mdash;"Genevieve," said a voice low and
close to her, "go no further&mdash;enter not the
cave." The voice was Amand's; but so altered
by some powerful emotion, that she
was compelled to look steadfastly on the
speaker before she could recognize the voice.
"And wherefore not?" said Genevieve. He
repeated the interdiction in a voice still more
agitated, broken, and terrific; "Go no further&mdash;enter
not," and unable to articulate the
word "there," he pointed, with action alarming
from its violence, to the cave. Genevieve
rose in terror; and Amand, mistaking this
movement for a resolve to enter, grasped her
arm and repeated, "Go not, I command!&mdash;no,
I implore thee, unless thou wouldst hear
that which will transfix thee where thou
standest:" and he rushed away; yet, before
he was out of sight, turned again, and by an

<!-- vol 2 page 362 -->

attitude of deprecation the most vehement,
seemed silently to beseech her not to go; he
then disappeared.</p>

<p>"Is the youth insane, or is he distempered
with strong wine?" said Arnaud, gazing after
him, "Alas! no," said Genevieve; "an evil
and unhappy spirit troubles him, and prompts
him to utter he knows not what." The sounds
of contention fierce and loud that had issued
from the interior now suddenly ceased, and a
deep voice was heard speaking alone. "Yet
tarry, maiden," he continued, seeing she was
about to advance, "peradventure there are
things spoken within which may be heard
only by the ears of the chief of the congregation,
and in a council of war, or deep debate
on mysteries, the presence of a maiden were
unseemly and unnecessary: tarry a while
that I may go in;" and he left her. Arnaud
returned in a few moments, his countenance
was very pale, and averted from her. He took
her hand without seeming to know that he held
it, and attempted hastily to draw her away.

<!-- vol 2 page 363 -->

"Wherefore is this?" said Genevieve, "surely;
I will enter, for what evil can befell me&mdash;if
Pierre be there?" Arnaud beheld her for a
moment with an aspect, in which doubt, regret,
and pity were struggling, and then dropping
her hand departed without speaking.</p>

<p>Genevieve, thus left alone, after a momentary
pause, approached the interior of the
cave. She did not enter, but stood leaning on
a crag of the rock, which concealed her from
the view of those within. They consisted of
Mattathias, Boanerges, and some of the more
fierce and zealous both of the pastors and
chiefs;&mdash;Pierre was also there, seated on a
block of stone, himself appearing turned to
stone also; his clasped hands resting on the
top of a staff, and his sightless eyes turned
towards heaven. Mattathias and all the rest
were standing: he was silent, but he appeared,
from his peculiar and terrible expression both
of face and attitude, to have been uttering
some tremendous imprecation as he stood.
The rest were gazing on him silent also; but

<!-- vol 2 page 364 -->

amid the horror that marked every pallid
visage with a deeper shade, a stern satisfaction
was visible. The barbes threw back
their cowls, and the warriors leaned on their
swords, all fixing their stern and eager looks
on him.</p>

<p>Mattathias had been disclosing to them
the crime of Genevieve, of which he had been
informed through a channel that may be
guessed at. He was now winding up the
period of his denunciation against his victim,
while she herself was involuntarily and invisibly
the witness of her own condemnation.&mdash;From
what she had heard, she understood
what had been already said, and perhaps
already determined; and as if she had been
present and pleading among them, she gazed
on every iron visage and cold fixed eye, but
read no relenting in them: she clasped her
hands and recoiled. The next moment
Mattathias, though with a reluctant pause,
announced death to be the punishment.&mdash;Death&mdash;death&mdash;repeated
many voices. But

<!-- vol 2 page 365 -->

some of those voices echoed the word in
horror.&mdash;some pronounced it in the mere
agitation of the moment&mdash;some in doubt of
what they heard, some in direct question, but
not one in vengeance,&mdash;save that of Mattathias.
The stern zealot repeated the sound.&mdash;"And
she must die, then; she <i>must</i> die!&mdash;must
she die?" repeated Pierre, dropping his
staff, and rolling his lightless eyes round the
assembly, as if trying to examine their countenances
by the long-lost power of vision.
"By the law," said Mattathias, "such ought
to die."&mdash;"By what law?" asked the trembling
parent; "by a law long abrogated&mdash;the law
of the Jews. I appeal to Christians&mdash;I appeal
to <i>men</i>&mdash;to fathers, and to mothers!&mdash;Speak,
for I cannot see you&mdash;Oh, strike not
the staff from the hand of the decrepid;
quench not the sole light of the blind! Must
my child die?"&mdash;"Yea, and thy hand should
be first upon her," cried Mattathias, "for
malediction and for death;" and he seized
the arm of the ancient man, whose exhausted
frame fell senseless at his touch.</p>

<p>"Oh! not his&mdash;not his!" cried Genevieve,
as she rushed into the cave, and prostrated
herself beside the pastor&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>NEITHER the deep and cautious silence
which the Court of Rome preserved on the
subject of the Bishop of Toulouse assuming
the title of champion of the Church, and leading
the army of the Crusaders&mdash;the refusal of
King Philip to aid him with a single man-at-arms,
till that title was recognized by the
Vatican&mdash;nor the desertion of the Crusaders'
troops; nor ultimately the defeat he had sustained

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

in leading the remainder against the
forces of Count Raymond, had subdued the
invincible spirit of the Bishop. Neglected
by the Pope, disclaimed by King Philip,
he resolved to give his retreat the air of a
victory, and consulting both policy and the
rude tactics of that excursive war, he was
leading the remainder of his forces towards
Beaucaire, thus, at once securing a retreat
to his own well-fortified castle in the vicinity,
intercepting the advance of Count
Raymond on other cities in his territory,
which were filled with Albigeois, and presenting
an imposing attitude of hostility,
while he meditated only his own security.
It was on the third evening after his defeat,
that the bishop, riding alone, and at some
distance from his followers, took out a small
table-book in which he had noted down the
names of the knights Crusaders. In a hasty
tone, he repeated, "Paladour, knight of
mystery, departed in quest of the lady Isabelle;
let him tilt against the rocks till his
lance breaks, and then break his brainless
head against them. Amirald!&mdash;a page at

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

the Castle of Courtenaye; knighted for some
mad deed of chivalry, and done to death at
his late encounter. Verac and Semonville,
fop and churl, parted too on the wild quest
of this lady of the lake. By heaven, the age
of old romance hath come again! The
knights who fought around old Troy were
wiser, for they demanded the dowry with the
dame, and these would win the dame, though
she lacked her dowry. But to my tablet.
Sir Aymer, grey-beard and green spirit: most
unapt assortment!&mdash;but he hath valour and
power. The Lord of Courtenaye, coward
and murderer known, and sorcerer suspected.
I list not to read farther. I am as a chess-player,
who must marshal my pawns as I
may against a fearful array of knight, bishop,
and castle&mdash;but the king," he added, striking
his bold breast, "the king can never be
taken." As he spoke, he tore and scattered
the leaves of the tablet.</p>

<p>"How fares it with my lord?" said a priest,
who rode near him.&mdash;"Even as with an artist
who hath no implements to work withal,"
replied the bishop. "And hast thou not

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

stout bodies and valiant hands to work thy
will?"&mdash;"I want <i>minds</i>," answered the bishop
abruptly, "not such as those about me,
minds almost corporeal so formed by habit
and circumstance, that their whole train
and course of action seem the result, not
of will, but of necessity. I lack men,
whose characters have been forced out by
strong emergencies&mdash;by rare and high trials&mdash;by
abrupt and potent cries from suffering
society. Let me have no blocks chiselled out
by the patient slow-working hand of human
toil, and then stuck on pedestals for brute
idolatry to bow before. Give me the rude
shapeless mass rent from the rock by the lightning
and the storm, and bearing wonder and
ruin in its career! We have too much of monastic
impotence and inefficiency: we cloister
up our males till eloquence is a <i>capucinade</i>,
and energy turned a book-worm, feasting on
the vile scrolls of fierce and frivolous controversy,
or worm-eaten metaphysics; and our
women cloistered too&mdash;their persons neglected,
their costume repulsive; ugly enough
even in the embellished pages of a missal,

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

amid gold and azure and vermilion, but the
devil in the conventual garb. Oh! with such
men as those I encountered; and such a
form as thine, Genevieve, and perhaps".........
He paused,&mdash;"But who be they who approach?
I see through the twilight a numerous company
advancing."&mdash;"It is the Abbot of Normoutier
and his train," answered father
Chrysostom, "journeying homeward from
the Castle of Courtenaye, where he hath made
long sojourn, partly he said for the healing of
his wounds. I know the state in which the
wealthy abbot rides, and know he must pass
this moor to reach the abbey walls, now not
two leagues distance. So, please you, my
lord, let us pray him for his hospitality tonight.
There is no place in this wild country
that can afford meal or harbour fit for a wolf&mdash;or
worse, a heretic; and the lord abbot,
though merely a fool, is hospitable withal."&mdash;"I
tell thee," said the bishop, "I had rather
couch on this dark moor, than harbour
for a night with that murderer of all meaning,
and mere necromancer of the ghosts
of departed quotations; none of which obey

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

his call&mdash;say to him so, and quit me of
him."&mdash;"But, my lord....." said Chrysostom.&mdash;"But
me no buts," said the prelate
hastily; "I can abide bad fare, and worse
lodgment; but debility, or even mediocrity
physical or mental, is the object of mine
utter and insurmountable aversion. I had
rather be tortured in a hell of devils, than
live in a paradise of fools: go, I say, and do
my message."</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Abbot of Normoutier
had also descried the approach of the
Bishop of Toulouse, and sent forward his
crosier-bearer to pray his lordship to partake
of the humble fare and lodgment of the Abbey
of Normoutier that night; and that his invitation
might lack no courtesy, he spurred up
his mule and rode towards the bishop to enforce
it.</p>

"If the Bishop of Toulouse," said father
Chrysostom to a monk of Normoutier whom
he knew, "refuses the proffer of the abbot,
his train are like to suffer; for it is held,
reverend brother, that the brotherhood of

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

Normoutier keep not cold Christmas in their
superior's absence."</p>

<p>"Thou art in the right of it," said the
monk.&mdash;"But," added Chrysostom, "what if
the abbot and his guest overtake them in their
hour of revel? such deeds have chanced:
how say ye to that?"&mdash;"I say," added the
monk, "that we have a trick shall win the
abbot to overpass all transgressions as lightly
as we pardon full-handed penitents at Easter.
Wot ye that we have two prisoners in the
abbey, for one of whom the Abbot of Normoutier
would pawn the richest jewel on the
shrine of St. Benedict. Hark, and I will
avise thee of their names,"&mdash;they were disclosed
in a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"We reserve this secret," said the monk,
"to appease the wrath of the abbot, should
it be kindled against the community, for
aught they may have done unbeseeming the
sanctity of their order, during his absence.
Thou wilt not betray me?"&mdash;"Not for the
pope's absolution," quoth Chrysostom, riding
up, as he spoke, close to the Bishop of Toulouse.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

<p>It was at this moment that the abbot's importunity,
though enforced by his very worst
quotations, was yielding to the bishop's pertinacious
and somewhat haughty refusal, that
father Chrysostom whispered, "My lord, I
pray you, comply with the abbot's prayer. I
shall yield you such reasons as shall afford
you large contentment: those whom you wot
of are lodged in the Abbey of Normoutier."&mdash;"Lord
abbot," said the bishop, suddenly
softening both mien and voice, "we shall be
debtor to your hospitality once more. Turn
we, then, towards the abbey. We trust
one day, lord abbot, to repay you at our poor
Castle of Beaucaire."&mdash;"Surely, my holy
lord," said the abbot, "I shall partake of
your cheer right gratefully&mdash;<i>velut illis Canidia
afflasset pejor serpentibus atris</i>. Set on,
brethren, towards the abbey; hardly shall we
win it ere night, and travelling is now right
perilous." And so the abbot rode on beside
the bishop, who reined up his war-steed to
keep pace with the former's pampered mule:
the fiery mettle, free movements, and noble
form of the one contrasted with the sleek

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

body, slow pace, and gorgeous trappings of
the other, giving no unsuitable image of the
characters and habits of the respective riders.
It was dark before they reached the
Abbey of Normoutier. The long massive
pile of building with its towers and spires
clustering in the darkness, stood like a mountain
on the verge of the heath. No light
gleamed from any part of the building, save
from the windows of the refectory, which
appeared all in a blaze as the travellers approached,
and there was a sound of music,
which might at a distance seem the chaunt
of monks at vespers; but the bishop soon
caught the sounds of a glee lustily chaunted
by the monks: it was one of that monastical
Anacreon, Walter-a-Mapes, beginning as
followeth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">Mihi sit propositum in tabern&acirc; mori,<br/>

Vinum sit appositum morientis ori<br/>

Ut dicant cum venerint angelorum chori<br/>

Deus sit propitius huic potatori.</p>

<p>"The brotherhood," said the abbot, who had
some inward misgivings, "are doubtless employed
in offering up prayers for the souls of

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

the Crusaders, who fell on that day of many
deaths." As he spoke, his attendants knocked
at the gate, and "the lights, so many and
fair, that signal made but now," disappeared
in a moment as by magic. "Smite again,"
said the abbot, who sat chattering with cold
on his mule, "and smite harder: use dagger-hilts
on the gate, if riding-rods avail not to
make them hear."&mdash;"Sir abbot," said the
bishop, smiling, "I pray you, disturb them
not at their holy exercise; perchance a Crusader's
soul is now shivering between purgatory
and paradise."&mdash;"I know a Crusader's
body is shivering between cold and famine,
and that is a more near and touching matter
at the present," said the abbot. Meanwhile
the knocks were redoubled; and the porter,
who reconnoitred the party through a wicket,
rushed back in terror to the community, who
had been at high revel, and verified all their
fears by announcing the return of the abbot
with the Bishop of Toulouse in company.
"Hold him in parley," said the abbot of misrule,
"for a space, if thou canst we have a
device for the nonce to slake his wrath, if it

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

burned against us as a furnace heated seven
times hot. Hold! I will go myself. Clear
the hall with what speed ye may; while I
undergo the challenge of this invader of our
royaume of misrule." They had already
extinguished the lights, and now made haste
to remove the covers and carpets, and the
dainties with which they were heaped, into
various nooks of the refectory; while he of
misrule set forth to gain time by holding the
abbot in parley. "Who is it," he asked, in
a snuffling and solemn tone, "who knocks
so loud and late, disturbing the devotions of
a few poor servants of holy St. Benedict?"
"It is your abbot," answered a quavering but
impatient voice, "restored to your prayers and
those of the community, which have doubtless
wearied Heaven for mine escape from
the peril of battle, and the fell and bloody
dint of the heretics' clubs in that day
when the flower of France and of chivalry
perished."&mdash;"Thou art a lying and an evil
spirit," snuffled the monk, "and art merely
sent to tempt us; know we not by sure
avisement that our late abbot....?"&mdash;"Thy

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

<i>late</i> abbot; I tell thee I am thy present
abbot," quoth the impatient dignitary.&mdash;"Peace,
thou lying spirit!" answered the
other. "True men told us that the late
Abbot of Normoutier fell in that fierce and
fruitless battle that the Crusaders fought
with the heretics. Nay, to confound thee,
and for thy more assurance, I had it revealed
to me in a dream, that Raymond of
Toulouse himself cleft him with his battle-axe
from his head (skull, I should say) to his
middle. Nay, never groan or make wail; I
promise you, men marvelled much at the
manner of his death, for in this abbey it was
held as a matter of creed, that the abbot's
skull would have undergone the dint of the
club wielded by Ascapart, or the fall of the
highest tower of the Abbey of Normoutier."&mdash;"Knave,
admit me suddenly," said the incensed
abbot, "and I will prove to thee that
thy tale is false by strokes across thy pate,
such as were never dealt by spirit."&mdash;"Lo
you now," answered the other, "what a malicious
and fiery spirit have we to deal with!
Our abbot in his life-time was deemed a

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

peaceable, pursy, dignitary as ever slumbered
in stall, and here comes his spirit vaunting,
daunting, and ranting like Termagant,
or the twelve peers of France and the
knights of the Round Table to boot&mdash;an'
the other world have taught ye no better
manners, speed back and learn them as ye
may&mdash;our gates are open to no spectre-rampant
at this hour."&mdash;"I swear to thee,
brother Gregoire," said the abbot, "that I
am a living and sinful man. Admit me,
I pray, or, as a Father hath it, <i>prima nocte
domum claude!</i> Knowest thou me now,
for I was ever skilled in apt quotation?
keep me not chattering here in the cold at
the gate of my own abbey."&mdash;"Chattering
with cold, thou false spirit," said brother
Gregoire; "I warrant thee thou art reeking
hot from purgatory&mdash;foh! I smell the smell
of sulphur through the wicket. Avaunt, thou
unquiet spirit! masses shall be said for thy
repose; depart and trouble us no more."&mdash;"Hark
thee, reverend brother," said the
bishop, who had his own reasons for gaining
speedy admittance, "we have certain toys in

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

our train called war-wolves' catapults, and
such names of endearment, the least of
which discharged against your doors, would
shatter them to dust; wherefore, we pray you
to open them with all convenient speed, lest
your skulls and feet have a weary way to
travel, ere they meet at the resurrection."&mdash;"We
will consider of your request," said the
monk, who felt the matter was becoming
serious; and at this moment it being signified
to him that the hall was cleared, the gates
were thrown open and the travellers entered.</p>

<p>The refectory presented an appearance
sufficiently decorous, the carpets had been
withdrawn from the tables, and the viands
and wine flagons removed; but there was a
strong and rich odour of savoury meats, which
accorded as ill with the naked appearance of
the apartment, as the flushed visages, reeling
obsequiousness, and involuntary titubations of
the monks, did with the superinduced demureness,
in which they clad themselves on
the appearance of the abbot and his guest.
The fire that blazed on the ample hearth,
gave attestation to the manner in which the

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

jovial monks had been passing the time during
their superior's absence; but the chilled
and wearied abbot had drawn close to the
fire without noticing the cause of its unusual
resplendence and intensity, when another
spirit began to move within him, and he exclaimed
in answer to the eager inquiries
of the monks, which it may be supposed
were in the inverse proportion of their real
anxiety, "<i>Sufficit quoad spiritualia</i>," and
he sunk into his vast and well cushioned
chair, as he spoke. "<i>Nunc quoad temporalia</i>&mdash;what
does the refectory furnish to
please the palate of my lord of Toulouse
withal?"&mdash;"Alas, lord abbot!" said Gregoire,
whilome abbot of misrule&mdash;a monk of some
fun and more impudence, and who, much
provoked at missing the good cheer the community
were about to partake of, had inwardly
sworn that the abbot and his lordly
guest should not taste morsel of it that
night&mdash;"Alas, why seek you viands in the
refectory of poor monks, who, for their last
<i>neuvaine</i><sup id="ref030"><a href="#en030">30</a></sup>, have never tasted flesh or white

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

bread, being engaged in devotion in honour
of St. Benedict, for the safe restoration of our
worthy abbot? Ye might as well seek for
flesh in a butcher's house on Good Friday:
I promise ye, we are no flinchers when St.
Benedict is in question. He is marvellously
tenacious, and somewhat, as it were, vindictive;&mdash;but
let that pass&mdash;saints have their
faults."&mdash;"I doubt it not, brother Gregoire,"
said the abbot, "and so have monks too&mdash;faults
of memory, or else how didst thou perform
a <i>neuvaine</i> for my restoration, supposing
me dead all the while, and denying me
entrance to mine own abbey?"&mdash;"I had
somehow a misgiving or inward doubt," said
the monk, with strong impudence, "or
as it were a confirmed assurance, reverend
abbot, that thou wouldst never die in battle."&mdash;"All's
one for that," said the Abbot of
Normoutier, "Meseems I have been saved
from the perils of the battle to die of hunger
within the walls of mine own abbey. I pray
thee, set before us what thou canst find in the
buttery and cellar; they were left not meanly
stored. Where be the fat haunches of red

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

deer which the vassals of the abbey were
wont to bring in at this season?"&mdash;"We
devoured them with careful haste," said
Gregoire, "lest they should have been
seized on by the heretics, led by that arch-fiend
Raymond of Toulouse. They were
then within a two-days' march of the abbey,
and it was whispered their appetite for venison
had not been at all diminished by
their faring for many months on cakes of
buck-wheat and water from the mountain-rill."&mdash;"I
doubt it not," said the abbot;
"but where be the butts of Malvoisie I left
behind me, under the care of the cellarer?&mdash;were
they also drunk lest they should fall
into the throats of the heretics?"&mdash;"They
were drained to the last drop," said Gregoire,
"lest the Lord of Courtenaye should have
borrowed them to feast the Crusaders on
their return from victory&mdash;I would say, defeat.
Thou knowest, lord abbot, that the
niggard would never set a wine-cup on his
board at his own cost, whiles he could borrow
from a wealthy abbot&mdash;we did it all in pure
zeal to the holy cause, as thou must judge."&mdash;"Thou

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

impudent and insulting knave!"
began the abbot; then checking himself,
"I pray you produce what vivers you have,&mdash;weary
travellers must digest them as they
may."</p>

<p>Thus addressed, Gregoire signed to a couple
of lay-brothers, and the table was, at the sign,
equipped with an earthen pitcher containing
some two gallons of water, a jar of wretched
wine, and a couple of loaves, as black and
coarse as the Albigeois were said to feed on.</p>

<p>"And is this our cheer?" said the abbot,
whom a whisper from one of the monks
had made <i>au fait</i> of the business; "marry,
sorry cheer for one who hath fought his way
through men and devils, embodied fiends on
earth, and disembodied fiends from beneath,
to win his way to the towers of his beloved
<i>domicilium</i>."&mdash;"Scratches from a few bushes
and briars," said the bishop, seating himself
down contentedly; for the bishop was
one who could at one moment revel in
frantic and intoxicating luxury, and the next
make mock of those who scorned to partake
of the humblest fare. He loved all the

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

wild and fierce extremes of life, and it
was scarce more indifferent to him to
revel with princes, or famish with peasants.
"Scratches from briars and thorns," he repeated,
helping himself to the homely fare, as
in high disdain of the abbot's fastidiousness.
"Say not so, my holy lord," said the abbot,
and pursuing his purpose; "never did man
or churchman deal more valorously than
did I, the simple Abbot of Normoutier,
this night&mdash;first, I dealt with the fiends
who withstood me in the name of Saint
Dunstan, that Saint of England of odorous
memory; but I soon found the demon was
too cunning to be caught by the nose as in
former times. Marry, Saint Dunstan had
left him not a cartilage of the nostril to
be caught by. At length I invoked Saint
Benedict, our founder&mdash;(sinful man that I
was for delaying to call on him!) and lo, the
demon became as docile and obsequious as
the page that holds up my lady's foot-cloth."
The monks crossed themselves at this detail.
"Then Saint Benedict saved your soul at its
utmost peril," quoth Gregoire.&mdash;"Yea, and

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

my life into the bargain," said the abbot;
"for what said the demon whom he subdued?&mdash;'I
have of late been let loose among the
community of Normoutier, and will reveal to
thee the secret nooks where I have hidden
viands to tempt them;'&mdash;and he named them,
saying, 'In the north cupboard there be pasties
of venison, and under the table store of
game stewed in ambergris, and manchets of
the whitest flour, and in that nook hid with
carpeting, bottles of Greekish wine'&mdash;where
haste and produce them, brethren, if they be
there; if not, we prove the Devil a liar, and
then shall religion flourish; if they be, then
so shall the fame of Saint Benedict flourish.
In any case we must be gainers&mdash;you by
the fame of your founder, and I by a solid
refection."</p>

<p>The disconsolate monks, at these words, produced
from nook and cupboard the dainties
intimated, protesting all the time that the
Devil must have conveyed them there, as the
rigour of their <i>neuvaine</i> had banished taste,
sight, or thought of such carnal indulgence.</p>

<p>"The Devil must then be an excellent

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

caterer," said the bishop, helping himself
largely to the red-deer pasty, and quaffing a
draught of wine. "Make him thy providore,
lord abbot; and the Bishop of Toulouse shall
oftener sup with the Abbot of Normoutier."</p>

<p>"Your holy lordship," said the abbot,
much incensed, "shall never lack the Devil
for a caterer, when such monks as brother
Gregoire may be found under the shelter
of holy walls. Hence to your cells, ye lewd
and scandalous monks, I will areed you such
penance for this&mdash;such fasting (marry I
wish I knew of worse,) as shall make your
bowels croak within you, like frogs in a
midsummer marsh."</p>

<p>At this moment Gregoire, who happened
to stand near the abbot's chair, bent down,
as if to hear the denunciation more reverently,
but whispered in the abbot's ear,
"Sir abbot, we pray you at this time to
pardon our delict, for certes we have tidings
that shall give you huge contentment&mdash;the
damsel you wot of, and another person, are
now prisoners in the abbey."</p>

<p>The abbot's features relaxed at this intelligence;

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

but, still maintaining the appearance
of anger, he enjoined the community,
with Gregoire at their head, to depart to
their cells suddenly while he meditated on
what penance should be devised for them;
"and trust me," he said, "it shall be as
severe as that menaced by an ancient superior
to a disorderly community, '<i>Cum tu
pulsas, ego vapulo tantum</i>.' "</p>

<p>The monks disappeared at this hint, and
the bishop and abbot were left with the ecclesiastical
attendants of the former, and the
few men-at-arms who accompanied the latter,
the remainder of his dispersed and scattered
forces being still at a distance.</p>

<p>The board was nobly furnished, and the
dignitaries failed not to do justice to the
savoury dishes and well-filled flagons; but
the period for all earthly enjoyments is short,
and the abbot, conscious of and dreading
deeply the superior intellectual powers of
the bishop, trembled for the time when the
conventual forms required the dismission of
their mutual attendants, and he should be
left alone with his formidable guest. Nathless,

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

the abbot made head and rallied what
powers he possessed, which were, indeed,
few and feeble, for commencing the dialogue
when the bishop and he were left to their
wine, the drinking of which the bishop mischievously
prolonged to fulfil the purpose for
which alone he had visited the abbey.</p>

<p>In the full confidence of a rich monastic
supper, ample draughts of wine, and that
contentful self-sufficiency, that a man, however
poor in intellectual store, feels after such
an operation, towards a visitor of superior
rank; the abbot, expanding his palms towards
the cheering blaze of the wood-fire,
exclaimed, "My holy lord, lonely as we are
left, trust me we shall not lack matter of
converse. I have swallowed many books."&mdash;"Hast
thou, lord abbot," said the bishop,
"then must I marvel thou hast not burst, for
thou hast digested none."&mdash;"I wot not what
my lord of Toulouse means by gestation,"
said the abbot, flying for shelter to the
reputation of the community; "but I will
uphold that our community possesseth somewhat
that may charm a lettered ear. What

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

thinks my lord of those savoury lines composed
by that brother Gregoire, whom I have
doomed to sharp penance for his delight?"&mdash;"Delict,
thou wouldst say, sir abbot," said the
bishop. "Delict, or delight, as thou wilt,"
said the abbot, "in the end they will be found
the same&mdash;but list to the verse composed as it
was on the eve of Corpus Christi: a whole
verb is declined&mdash;no, a noun conjugated&mdash;in
sooth, I know not but an interjection is
conjugated, or conjured, or grammatically
dealt with also. Here be the verses, for I
am an expert Latinist:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'Mors mortis morti mortem, nisi morte dedisset,<br/>

C&oelig;lorum nobis janua clausa foret.'</p>

<p>Nay, on the performance of the 'Tenebr&aelig;,'
what was his marvellously witty <i>l'envoy</i> to
the <i>proeme</i> he wrote thereon?"&mdash;"Poem,
thou wouldst say, sir abbot," replied the
bishop. "That avails not," said the abbot;
"hear the distich;" and he repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'Non miror tenebras Christo moriente fuisse,<br/>

Nam semper tenebr&aelig; sole cadente fiunt.'</p>

<p>"What deemest thou of that?"&mdash;"Truly,
lord abbot, I deem of the metre and meaning

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

alike."&mdash;"I knew thou wouldst," said the
abbot, "and deemest thou our community then
lacking in aught that might win the ear of
the learned to list?"&mdash;"I deem it more
lacking in hospitality," said the bishop rather
abruptly, speeding to something "germane
to the matter." At the word "hospitality,"
the abbot gazed with vacant and astonished
eye on the board with its vanished
viands, but amply furnished flagons; and
repeated "Hospitality!"&mdash;"Yea, lord abbot,"
said the bishop; "for thinkest thou, musty
fragments of monkish verse can furnish
dessert to a feast like thine? Thou lackest
one thing, lord abbot, to make thy viands
tasteful to knight or churchman; thou
lackest the sole incentive that can give flavour
to costly cates, or zest to racy wine."
The abbot raised a vacant lightless eye to
the speaker, and fixed it on him, as if unable
either to understand him or to withdraw it.
"Nay, look not thus, lord abbot," said the prelate,
"thou knowest that such incentive may
be found within these holy walls." The abbot
flung himself back in his chair, in somewhat

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

the attitude in which erst he received the
daring proposal of the outlaw. "In the
name of Heaven and holy Saint Bennet," he
cried, "how didst thou learn that woman, or
aught that bears woman's form, is harboured
within the towers of Normoutier?"&mdash;"Even
from thyself, lord abbot; for how else should I
have profanely guessed that a female was concealed
in these walls?"&mdash;"The Devil must
have helped thee to the knowledge," said the
abbot.&mdash;"Slander not the Devil," said the
bishop, smiling; "thou hast been indebted
to him for a supper already, for his spirits
have conjured it from nook and cupboard;
and now I summon the same spirits to convey
hither on the instant&mdash;on the instant I say&mdash;the
female heretic Genevieve, who lies in
the south turret of your abbey, and the
deacon Mephibosheth, who lies in a dungeon
northward, foul and fetid. Now judge
if my spirits be not as apt in conjuring as
thine, sir abbot." As he spoke, "four of his
people, with an obedient start," made out in
the direction he indicated; and before the
abbot could recover from his amazement,

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

Genevieve and her fellow-prisoner were led
into the refectory. "These be the spirits with
which you are haunted," cried the bishop,
pointing to the shrinking Genevieve. "But
I shall take such order, lord abbot, for the
future, to clear your abbey of these visitants,
that thou shalt confess me as expert an exorcist
as Saint Benedict himself."</p>

<p>The abbot thus taken in the manner, and
seeing denial bootless, betook himself to defence.
"Surely," he said, "if a breach of
monastic rule were ever pardonable, it was in
this matter, when the zeal of the brotherhood
to convert that female heretic had led them
somewhat to strain discipline, by admitting
her within the precincts of hallowed walls.
But I will myself," he added, "place her
amid a sisterhood of nuns hard by, where my
daily visits and exhortations"&mdash;"Amid a
sisterhood of nuns!" repeated the bishop indignantly
to himself; "the mystery of this
maiden's high destiny is unknown to thee,
fool as thou art; nor couldst thou even conceive
it, were it disclosed to thee."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

<p>The reluctance of the abbot to lose his
beautiful prize, began to overcome even his
awe of the bishop, as it had before all considerations
of his character and profession;
and he began to raise his voice, while the
bishop, disdainful of opposition, commanded
his attendants to prepare for instant departure.
At this moment, while the deacon
stood in moody silence, the unfortunate
maiden, though hopeless of success, made a
feeble effort to address her persecutors: "To
ask," she said, "why, though guiltless, she
was treated as a prisoner, would be to ask in
vain; for when did power ever yield reasons
for following its own fierce will? Alas!"
she continued, "though ye listen not to so
mean a suppliant, yet do not yourselves such
wrong&mdash;debase not lofty station and lordly
title, by bending them to the level of a lowly
peasant maiden." Touched by the melody of
tones so sweet and low, "that excellent
thing in woman," the bishop stood for a
moment subdued and silent, when a loud
knocking at the gate was followed by the
blast of a trumpet. The porter hastened to

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

the gate, and there was scarce time to remove
the prisoners into an adjoining passage,
when Sir Ezzelin de Verac and de Semonville,
to the no small surprise and dissatisfaction
of the two churchmen, rushed into
the refectory.</p>

<p>We shall avail ourselves of the interruption
caused by their presence, to relate the means
by which Genevieve fell into the hands of the
monks of Normoutier.</p>

<p>AT the exclamation of Genevieve, mentioned
in a preceding chapter, the pastor was
borne from the cavern by some who felt much
for him, and more for the beautiful victim,
who stood pale, but resolved, before her pitiless
judges. It was observed, that she cast
one agonizing glance on her grandfather, as
he was borne like a corse from the cave, and
then turned calmly and fearlessly to meet the
judgment about to be passed on herself, as if all
her personal sufferings had ceased with that
spectacle, and she was prepared to listen to
what followed as if it regarded another; her

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

lips were compressed, her hands clasped on
her bosom, and her eyes, without being raised
or depressed, directed straight onward as if
her very eyes could listen. So she stood
moveless and silent as one capable of the
highest resolve, and incapable of being
deterred by menace or power from its
avowal. Multitudes in the meanwhile began
to throng into the cavern; the report
had spread; and the females who had been
her companions that eventful morning were
among the first.</p>

<p>"Woman," said Mattathias, "thou hast
heard thy crime urged and proved; if thou
canst say aught in denial or disproof, our ears
are open; but utter not a word in palliation
of thy deed, for to such we shall be deaf as
the rock that overarches our heads."&mdash;"Of
denial or of palliation will I not utter a
word," said Genevieve, "till I know my
crime."&mdash;"Thy crime, thou female Achan!"
said Boanerges. "Hast thou not saved the
life of a Crusader in the face of the malediction
uttered by the whole congregation with the
fullest, fiercest force of execration? Did we not

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

curse with the curse of Meroz, those who aided
them by deed or hand, or look, or thought?
and who hath dared such deed in defiance of
her God and of her church?"&mdash;"A woman,"
answered Genevieve, whose courage rose
with the emergency, "but one who defies
neither God, nor a church which walks by
his will, in doing a deed of mercy and pity.
Alas! if fearful times and deadly acts rouse
men to hatred and hostility, if blood must be
shed, and life be lost, at least leave woman
to her natural office and duty, that of tending
the sick, and soothing the sufferer. Let the
pride of man preserve its privilege to draw
blood from hearts, and tears from eyes, but
leave to woman her cherished right to
stanch the one, and wipe away the other."</p>

<p>It was singular that Genevieve, in this
emergency, completely forgot that oriental
phraseology, which formed the characteristic
language of her community, so that
her judges seemed to speak in one tongue,
and she to reply in another.</p>

<p>"Thou knewest," said Mattathias, "the

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

wrongs and the sufferings of the faithful;
wherefore, when a foe of God and of his
people was in thy power, didst thou not
deal with him as those holy and heroic
women of old, Jael and Judith, dealt with
the enemies of their faith, and the persecutors
of their people? so had thy name been
famous among women. But now shalt thou
be a by-word and a hissing, an outcast and
a scorn."&mdash;"Not amongst women," replied
Genevieve; "God, in his justice, commanded
the sword to go forth by the hands of his
people of old against the abominations of the
ancient idolaters. But when did He put a
sword into the hands of Christians to smite
and to slay those who profess the same faith,
who call on the same name? Even now in this
day of trouble and rebuke, I am justified in
the hearts of mine own sex, and an hour will
come, when even you shall do me unwilling
justice, and wish in your moment of peril
and calamity that you may meet with <i>an
enemy like me</i>."&mdash;"Thou art overbold,
woman," said Mattathias, "to defend thine

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

evil deed; thou lovest the comely favour of
this stranger, and for it, wast willing to betray
the cause of Heaven and of thy people."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, a light came
to Genevieve's eye, and a sudden accession
of power to her whole form, that made
those who beheld her, gaze as if she
had been changed in their sight on the
instant. "Slay me, banish me," she said,
"use your power as ye may; but stain not
by one suggested thought the fair fame,
which to guard, these hands rolled down
rocks from your mountains this day, and
would have aided to drag them on my own
head, ere I would become the vile thing I
cannot name. But," she added, a glorious
expression settling on her calm brow&mdash;"but
ye are <i>men</i>, and I forgive you. Ye cannot
divine the depth of woman's purity. With
<i>you</i> reward is ever the motive: with <i>us</i>
motive is ever the reward. But I trouble
you," she added, in a subdued voice, the
inspiration of the moment fading fast from
eye, and cheek, and form. "Now let me
hear my sentence, and spare not to speak.

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

Two pangs bitterer than death have already
been undergone, and what yet remains must
be unfelt. I have seen my father fainting
under sufferings I inflicted; I have heard
my fair name doubted by those who know
that this morning I made an effort, beyond
the natural strength of woman, to
preserve it. What I am yet to suffer, tell
me suddenly; it can scarce cost me one
added pang."</p>

<p>"Woman!" thundered Mattathias, provoked
beyond his usual stern ferocity of
temper by that quiet heroism which women
only possess. "Behold, we sentence thee,
in our mercy, to an everlasting separation
from the Church. Go! we cut thee off as
a mortified limb, and as a broken branch.
Of our food thou shalt never partake&mdash;in
our community thou shalt never join&mdash;in
our prayers thy name shall be forgotten.
Go!&mdash;wander in the wilderness, and mayest
thou bear with thee the sin of the congregation!"</p>

<p>The unfortunate maiden seemed blood-frozen
at these words&mdash;all her courage failed

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

at once&mdash;she cast, for the first time, an
appealing look at her judges. "It is not possible,"
she said, "that you will expose a
wretched solitary female to the fangs of the
wolves and bears, and of what she dreads
more than the wild beast in fury and famine?
If ye have not daughters, ye are
the sons of women. It is not possible!" she
cried, in a voice of confidence&mdash;"It is
not possible!" she continued, her voice faltering
and her courage failing, as she gazed
on the stern and lightless visages around
her&mdash;"It is not possible!" she repeated
again, hiding her face, as, her voice failing
utterly, she burst into an agony of tears. A
murmur, deep and loud, arose among the
congregation&mdash;tears they had too often witnessed
to affect them much, and to beauty
they were from poverty, coldness of constitution,
and habitual hardness of feelings (rendered
hard by their destiny,) almost insensible;
but there was something in Genevieve's last
appeal that roused all that was manly and
feeling in their hearts, and they testified it by
that deep murmur, which, like the preluding

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

hum heard among their mountains, gave
token of the approaching storm.</p>

<p>The women, always first in the cause
of humanity, commenced the murmur;
and the men sustained and prolonged it,
till it pealed like thunder in the ears of
her judges. At the sound, Mattathias
only bristled his shaggy brows and compressed
his lips; but Boanerges, though
he would have disdained the show of opposition
as highly as his assessor, was already
softened towards Genevieve; and Arnaud
sought to mediate between both: "What
though she have wrought folly in Israel," he
said, "shall we therefore do a deed that will
be sin unto us and to our children?" Boanerges
pleaded still more earnestly; and Mattathias,
with rigid vehemence, opposed both
till their raised voices were drowned in the
increasing tumult of the congregation; when
the sight of Genevieve's waved arm and parted
lips produced instant tranquillity among
the latter. "Hear me," she said: "I am
about to suffer for that for which, though
I cannot repent, I bear my punishment

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

unrepiningly. I have read in old story,
that the root of freedom in a mighty state
had not flourished, were it not nourished at
its planting by the blood of a woman. And
shall the courage of a Christian maiden vail
to that of a heathen matron? But make
not my misfortune a crime, as it must be,
if a being so humble and unhappy kindle a
difference between those who acknowledge
the same faith, and contend even unto death
for it. I am not worth the breath ye waste in
my defence: far less worthy am I, that for me
the peace of the Church should be disturbed.
Let me be cast forth, as unworthy to sojourn
with you, while in the wilderness of persecution;
but let me still trust that we shall meet
on the hither bank of Jordan and rejoice."
A murmur of acclamation, which drowned
the aggravated voices of dispute between
Mattathias and his assessors, was her answer:
it awoke the high-toned spirit of Genevieve&mdash;and
while her voice swelled to the most
powerful tone that ever issued from woman's
lip, and her eye kindled like that of a warrior

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

on the eve of battle, her features were
as pale as those of the dead, and her form
had all the mute and motionless stillness of
a sculptured statue. "My sisters!" she cried,
addressing the females, "did I not, this day,
save yourselves and your little ones, those
younglings of your hearts whom ye would
have nourished with that heart's blood
sooner than see them perish?" And the
females held up their children in verification
of her appeal. "Brethren," said Genevieve,
turning towards the men, "I have saved
your wives and infants this day. Have I
no right to demand a service from you
in return?" Voices innumerable, male and
female, thundered through the cavern, repeating,
"Name thy boon, and it shall be
granted! It <i>shall</i> be granted!" repeated
they again and again, till the seats of stone on
which her judges sat, rocked and rang with
the reverberated sounds. "Thou seest how
lightly a tumult may be raised by this woman!"
said Mattathias, indignantly.&mdash;"And
thou shalt see also how lightly it may be

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

appeased!" replied Genevieve. "My brethren
and friends!" she continued, raising
her voice, "I demand from you instant submission
to the will of my judges&mdash;such submission
as I myself will yield. I go into
banishment, according to your sentence," said
she, addressing Mattathias; "and pray you
only to allow two aged men to be my guides
to the city of Toulouse; but not so far indebted
to years, that they feel their journey
a burthen; for," she added, with a
broken voice, "I ought to feel deeply for
the aged:" then recovering herself&mdash;"I have
relatives who will, perchance, think no scorn
to receive me, though an exile. Some will
grant this slight boon not for my sake,
but for the love they bear to their ancient
pastor."</p>

<p>"Surely I will go with thee," said Arnaud,
"and will lead thee by a safe and
secret path amid the mountains, because of
the Crusaders, who still gather round the
banner of the Bishop of Toulouse; but the
way, maiden, is perilous."&mdash;"It matters not,"
said Genevieve, her voice subsiding into its

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

habitual tone of mild firmness: "let my
perished body rather waste on the snows of
my native mountains, than fester in pampered
infamy amid the palaces of those sons of violence
and vice." Another companion was
quickly found, who announced that he knew
a more sure, swift and secret path; and spoke
in high terms of his skill and experience in
the way. They demanded of her when she
would set forth. "This very hour!" said
Genevieve; "a resolution that costs us so
much should be realized the moment it is
formed&mdash;the heart may not have strength for
a second effort. I am equal to the trial to
which I am called now; but should I linger
till I saw my father, I should become such a
bankrupt in fortitude, that I feel I should
supplicate on my knees for a mitigation of
my hard doom, and," glancing at Mattathias,
"know I should supplicate in vain."</p>

<p>Mattathias, who, as long as any opposition
to his will was indicated, felt it only an incentive
to adhere to it more rigorously, now
that all opposition had subsided, and his victim
was submissively preparing to depart, felt

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

an involuntary relenting. "Damsel," said he,
"there is one condition on which thy heavy
offence may be pardoned, and thou again be
reckoned amid the daughters of our people."
Genevieve spoke not; but she fixed her
eyes on him with an expression that intimated
there was nothing within the range
of human patience to endure, that in such a
cause she would shrink from.</p>

<p>"Yield up to us," said Mattathias, "the
name of this Crusader, and the secret place
where thou hast hidden him, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Genevieve waited not for the closing of
the period, but, shaking her head, turned
slowly to depart. Those around her now
pressed her with all the vehemence of most
intense importunity, as if they were pleading
for themselves, to give up the name and retreat
of the Crusader; and their importunity
was the more dangerous, as they had indeed
every show of reason and of truth to back
their argument.</p>

<p>Genevieve listened, but yielded not; nor
swerved a moment internally (though strongly
beset) from the high purpose of her own

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

generous heart. When she had borne supplication
and remonstrance with the smile
of a martyr, she said mildly, as if in gratitude
to the pleaders, "Misfortune itself
is as the dust of the balance, when weighed
against crime. From exile&mdash;from death&mdash;were
death itself to threaten me this
hour, would I not purchase deliverance at a
price that must make me loathe the life so
bought. Were I even man, I would think it
foul scorn to betray a helpless and disarmed
enemy. But, holy Heaven!" she added,
raising her inspired eyes, "how must they
wrong thy workmanship who deem that such
heartless treachery could be harboured in the
breast of woman!"</p>

<p>"Then thou persistest to withhold the
name and hiding-place of that idolatrous
paramour?" said Mattathias with a brutal
rage, which the mild sufferance of Genevieve
appeared only to excite.</p>

<p>Genevieve cast one look on the speaker,
and then calmly and silently prepared to
take her departure from the cavern. The
feelings of the whole assembly, men and

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

women, seemed to swell to their throats;
and all and each besought a solemn leave-taking
of her, whom they had looked on as
almost an inspired being. The women gathered
round her first, bearing their children
in their arms; the younger men intermingled
with them; the elder stood not aloof, but
uttered many blessings, as the victim with
slow but firm tread, attended by her aged
guides, turned her departing steps from the
cavern. To the women, bathed in tears,
and the men, who hardly suppressed theirs,
she said, calmly: "No tears&mdash;no embraces&mdash;no,
my friends,&mdash;no farther struggle! My
mortal frame has much to undergo, and all
my strength and courage must be wrought
to the utmost to meet it. Spare me your
tears; but give me your prayers! I shall
have occasion enough for tears when, perchance,
I may not have strength to utter a
prayer:" and she passed on, with pale cheek
but majestic step, till she reached the entrance
of the cavern. Her step faltered but once,
and her recollection seemed to desert her but

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

once also, as, striking her slender foot against
one of the stones with which the rocky floor
of the cavern was strewn, she implored pardon;
and then smiling at her error, and taking
the arm of Arnaud, "I must," she said,
"ask aid of my guide sooner than I deemed."&mdash;"Wilt
thou not see the aged Pierre ere
thou partest?" said Arnaud.&mdash;"If I saw his
grey hairs but once more," said Genevieve, in
a voice of deep but suppressed emotion, "we
should never part: no force could tear me
from him! And yet," she added,&mdash;"and yet
I would wish to see him once more, were I
assured he would not see me!" The moment
she uttered these words, she clasped
her hands on her forehead, and said, with
more agitation than she had yet betrayed,
"Surely my reason wanders, or I should not
have forgot that he <i>cannot</i> see me."&mdash;"From
his swoon," said the pitying Arnaud, "he
hath fallen into a slumber. He is harboured
in a nook of this cavern." Although but a
slight and imperceptible movement of Arnaud's
finger accompanied these words, Genevieve

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

seized their meaning with rapid
intuition of feeling. With finger on lip, and
noiseless step, she entered the nook where
the pastor slumbered. She parted the white
hairs that streamed over his forehead; she
pressed her lips twice or thrice on his furrowed
brow, and two large silent drops fell
from her eyes. With most gentle action,
such as would not wake a slumbering babe,
she wiped them off with her veil; and then,
rushing from the recess, exclaimed, in a
choked voice, "Take me, take me hence,
while I have yet the power to go!"</p>

<p>At the moment that they reached the
entrance of the cavern, a figure, grovelling
at her feet, obstructed her progress, and
the well-known voice of Amand exclaimed,
"Curse me ere thou goest!" Genevieve
paused, as a suspicion of the cause of her
sufferings seemed doubtfully to touch on her
apprehension; and then, in a voice whose
softness was more wounding than many reproaches,
"Is it thou?" she said&mdash;"thou, the
companion of mine earliest childhood, the
very friend of mine habits and of my heart?

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

What had I done unto thee, that thou hast
dealt with me thus?"&mdash;"Enough!" said
Amand, agonizingly&mdash;"enough to justify me
in the fierce moments of provocation; but
not in this terrible hour of my repentance!
I saw thy care of that wounded knight: it
sent flames to my brain, and poison into my
blood. In the madness of jealousy I disclosed
thy secret to Mattathias, and even
urged thy punishment! But it is <i>I</i>," he
added, with a yell of agony&mdash;"it is <i>I</i> who
am punished! Thou dost not forgive me!&mdash;thou
canst not!&mdash;and, without thy forgiveness,
never will I hope for that of Heaven!"&mdash;"Speak
not words so fearful," said Genevieve.
"I do forgive thee, Amand. I
forgive thee, from my soul; but, as thou
valuest thine own, struggle with those spirits,
fierce and dark, that have so long troubled
thee, and had mastery over it. Farewell!"
she added; while he continued silently to
writhe at her feet. "Be a son to him to
whom thou hast left no other child! and,"
bending over him, she whispered, "Tend
well the wounded knight: on thee alone

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

depends that life it hath cost me so much
to save, and thou for that cause wilt cherish
it:" and she passed forth. It was not till certain
that he no longer had to encounter her
sight, that Amand raised himself from the
earth, and looking wildly after her: "Thou
hast at length," he said, "devised a meet
punishment for my crime, were it more than
the first horrors of my self-accusation painted
it. Not the visages of fiends to condemned
spirits are so loathsome, so execrable as the
face of that youth to me; yet I must see him
every day and every hour: she hath doomed
me to it, and I will abide her doom. Never
did man bear man more deadly hatred; never
shall man render more mortal service!"</p>

<p>The pilgrims wound their way slowly
through the valley, and ascended one of the
eminences which bounded it: on its summit
Genevieve paused, but not from weariness.
The sun had risen on the earth, and his beams
were reflected from the white tents that lay
thickly over hill and valley, like a flock of
sheep at rest, as she gazed silently on the habitations
of her people, who were indeed as

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

much a separated and peculiar people in the
country they inhabited, as the Jews of old
were among the nations of the earth. An
access of sacred enthusiasm lit up her eye with
the glory of a prophetess's, and mantled her
form in more than human majesty. "How
goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! and thy tabernacles,
O Israel!" she cried. "Not listed
fields, or kingly courts, or cities of palaces
and temples, present so glorious an object
to mine eyes as the tents of the despised
Albigeois. Oh, I leave you&mdash;I go," she said&mdash;yet
not going&mdash;"as our first erring parent
went, with many a pausing step and reverted
glance, flung fondly back on Paradise&mdash;lost
Paradise!"</p>

<p>IT was yet early day when they set forward,
and their first day's journey was performed
in safety and comparative ease. It led
through a forest rich in all the glories of autumnal
colouring, and expanding in the lofty
luxuriance of vegetable magnificence; and
their path only varied from a deep smooth
sward to the crisp and rustling footing of the
leaves with which the breeze every moment
strewed it. Trees of every species, and now
of almost every hue, contrasted their varying
shades of purple, orange, and brown, with
the everlasting green of the fir, and the darker
foliage of the larch and oak, which as yet
had disdained to yield one leaf to Autumn;

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

and between the rich glades of deepening and
interminable green, (which gave at once to
the eye exercise the most delicious and repose
the most profound,) the dark boles and
intricate fantastic roots were projecting and
interlacing with a variety of modulation,
that would have mocked the eye to disentwine,
or the pencil to trace; the dun
deer bounding with not ungraceful wildness,
and bending their large reverted eyes
on the human intruders. These glades
sometimes gave glimpses of the country they
had left&mdash;the vast fallow field, brown but
not uncomely, as it lay richly fringed with
the foliage of the forest scenery. Sometimes
a higher view was caught of rocks tapestried
from terrace to terrace with vines; and
though the glow and the glory of the
vintage were over, and the purple clusters
no longer blushed amid the rude granite and
dark foliage, yet their undulations still gave
a picturesque drapery to the rocks, to be
found only in a southern landscape. Amid
the most inaccessible cliffs was sometimes
wildly perched a hunter's or a vintager's

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

cottage, seeming from its roof, all covered
with verdure, its walls of grassy clods, and
its door constructed of blocks of stone inclining
to each other, more like the rude
work of nature than the structure of man;&mdash;further
and higher still were caught glimpses
of the Pyrenees, whose infinite varieties of
form and felicities of colouring, while they
seemed fit confines for some land of enchantment,
where brighter hues and richer lights
and finer forms than earth owns are engirdled
and embosomed, gave to the travellers a sensation
of the profoundest anxiety. Yet could
they not but gaze in silent delight, as, on the
sun's decline, the roseate and purpureal tints
shifted from valley to peak; and while the
forest below lay plunged in the deepest gloom,
the summits of the mountain were still
flushed with the vivid tints of a summer
morn, gradually fading into a rich and sombrous
purple, till that hue melted slowly into
the deep blue of the twilight heavens, leaving
it doubtful to the tranced eye whether it was
mountain or sky it gazed on.</p>

<p>As night advanced, they arrived at the
outskirts of the forest, and began to ascend

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

the rocks which formed the base of the
mountain over which their guide had promised
to conduct them. The splendor of the
forest-scenery (which now lay a dark and
tintless mass below) was over, and the perils
of their neighbourhood to it began to be announced
by the cries of the wolves and bears,
many of whom, they feared, were harboured
in the rocks they were ascending, as the
howls were repeated on every side around
them with a force and distinctness that seemed
far to exceed those of the most powerful
echo. A short and trembling council was
held, and it was determined to ascend the
highest pinnacle of rock they could, or
even to seek for shelter at a human habitation,
at whatever risk of rejection or hostility.
As with strength renewed by their
fears, they toiled up the painful ascent, a
light like a star was seen twinkling at a small
distance:&mdash;the travellers instantly turned in
its direction&mdash;they reached it, not without
difficulty, and found it proceeded from a hut
built on the summit of a hill. It was constructed
of clay, but strengthened with stones.
The roof was covered with strong ropes of

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

dry grass, to which stones were appended to
keep them firm, and it was fortified by a
wooden door of rude but substantial fabrication,
which seemed firmly barred. The
light gleamed through a crevice, into which
Arnaud and the guide looked, but could discover
nothing within distinctly.</p>

<p>Their repeated applications for admission
were at length answered by the hoarse voice
of a man apparently roused from sleep, and
their entrance appeared delayed rather by
his drowsiness than his reluctance; for, when
he understood, at length, that they sought
shelter, bolt after bolt was sluggishly withdrawn,
and the interior was at length disclosed.
It was a large, single, desolate room&mdash;a
heap of dried leaves lay in one corner&mdash;a
huge shaggy dog in the other, whose collar,
stuck with iron spikes, denoted him a fierce
champion against the wolves, and whose red
eye and hideous growl kept the travellers trembling
at the threshold. The being who opened
the door seemed scarcely less savage than
his companion: his expression at first seemed
to be marked with appalling ferocity, but,
on examination, there was nothing of human

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

malignity in it; it was the wildness of animal
character untamed, and easily excited by fear
or surprise. He admitted them, placed his
burning splinter of pine in a crevice, hushed
his fierce dog, and threw himself on his bed
of leaves, carefully guarding by his position
his hoard of chesnuts and goats-milk cheese
from discovery. There was a pause on the
side of host and guests, till, the former observing
the travellers produce their slender
portion of goat's flesh and poor wine, he
testified by a kind of social grin his willingness
to be a partaker, and they were glad to
purchase safety and shelter at so cheap a
price. A kind of conversation then commenced,
which the <i>patois</i> of the mountain
shepherd, (for such he was,) and the Jewish
phraseology of the guide, rendered at first
wholly unintelligible, till Arnaud began to
interpret between them. The furniture of the
shepherd's head was as scanty as that of his
hovel; he told, however, that there were two
seasons in the year: the warm when he fed
his flocks among the hills, and the cold when
he led them to the pastures below, for which,

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

he said, he was preparing the next day. His
dog was his only companion. His year had
one era and one holiday, when he went to
the nearest village to sell his sheep and confess
himself to a priest: this was, as well as
they could make out, about Easter. He described
the period by the appearance of the
stars.&mdash;"And has thy simple traffic never
been interrupted by wars or rumours of wars?"
said Arnaud. The rustic said, there was one
day a tumult in the village, and he drove
away his flock in fear. "And dost thou not
know the cause of warfare?" said Arnaud.
The man paused, and then said he supposed
that one had more sheep than another, and
his enemy sought to rob him of them. "They
contend for flocks of different folds," said
Joshua the guide, referring what was said to
the contest between the Albigeois and their
foes; "one for the flock of the true Shepherd,
whom they seek to feed in his own pastures,
and cause to lie down by the still waters; the
other for the goats of the infernal herdsman
whom&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"They are great fools then,"
said the man, who thought he had a right to

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

speak now&mdash;"they are great fools to fight
about sheep and goats, when the latter are
nothing to the former either in milk, meat, or
wool."&mdash;"In the name of heaven," said Arnaud,
who perceived it was in vain to speak
in metaphor, "of what faith art thou?"&mdash;"Of
the faith of our lady of the valley," said
the shepherd; "I bow my head and say Ave,
as I am taught, when I pass her image, as I
do twice a year with my flock. In the spring
I crown it with green leaves; and when I return
in autumn, I pick off the dead ones. She
hath been good lady to me, and though I
hear of other saints, I care not to change her
for the gayest that ever was decked for a
holiday; but I fear I shall not have her long,
for she is old and much decayed, and then,"
he said, "I must seek another."</p>

<p>The flood-gates of Joshua's wrath and
eloquence were now opened, and the deluge
burst forth with a fury that bore more than
a due proportion to its long and forcible suppression.
The shepherd listened for some time
to a torrent of words that overwhelmed him
with their sonorous fluency and uninterruptible

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

rapidity, and even appeared pleased at
first with the sound, as a child would be by
the powers of a new instrument; but when
at length he made out, by dint of Arnaud's
explanations, that the religion which appeared
to him as it did to Arnobius of old, "<i>simplex
et absoluta</i>," had been the cause of wars that
had desolated the fairest provinces of France;
that it had marshalled armies with princes
and pontiffs at their head; and already cost
the lives of thirty thousand men, sacrificed
by their own countrymen; that torrents of
blood were still flowing, and were still to
flow; and that, moreover, so exquisite had
the religious sensibility of the one class become,
that they had sentenced to everlasting
exile from their community, a female, for the
crime of saving the life of one who belonged
to the other, the man at first recoiled, and
then by the sudden and strongly-marked
change in his countenance, appeared to regard
his companions with horror, as the most
wicked wretches on earth. He slunk back
to his bed of leaves, eyeing them with a most
sinister expression, in which, however, there

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

was something honest as well as truculent;
scarcely hushed his growling, ferocious
dog; and as the first light of dawn gleamed
through the crevice, he unbarred his door,
and silently motioned his guests to depart.</p>

<p>Genevieve set out on her second day's journey
with a sad heart and doubtful mind; the
difficulties of her progress were likely to increase
at every step. But another weight
pressed on her thoughts, whose burthen was
doubled by her not daring to communicate it
to her companions. The state of the poor
unenlightened being they had parted from
was, probably, that of thousands of his countrymen
under similar circumstances of intellectual
barrenness and abstraction from human
society; nay, considering the choked
and impeded progress of mental cultivation,
and the necessarily tardy diffusion of religious
knowledge, seven-tenths of the population of
Christendom were in the same situation; and
these beings remained insulated and undisturbed,
ignorant of the elementary truths of
that religion, for whose divisions and
subdivisions, shades and penumbras, their countrymen

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

and fellow-Christians were massacring,
ravaging, burning, and exterminating within
three leagues on every side of them. Her
mind for a space swung from its moorings,
and she appeared to herself to be daringly
voyaging an unfathomable and shoreless
ocean of discovery. Strong sense and right
feeling soon guided her through those straits
and whirlpools, where so many have made
shipwreck, and piloted her to the "haven
where she would be." She came to the just
conclusion, that, however deplorable were the
apathy and destitution of the poor shepherd,
there must be also an error in causeless refinement
and overwrought tenacity, in verbal
controversies urged for life and death, while
the weightier matters of the law of the Great
Master lay neglected and unfulfilled; and she
believed and hoped that the time might yet
be, when Catholics and Albigeois alike might
resign the distinction of mountain or of temple,
and worship God, as he requires, "in
spirit and in truth." The current of her
thoughts was soon checked by the increasing
perils of her progress; they had long left

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

behind them the scenes and even the track
of cultivation; the forests with their deer,
and even the rocks with the foxes and wild
goats, had disappeared; and they began to
ascend those hills of everlasting snow, which,
perhaps, had never felt the touch of thaw
since creation, except where the falling meteor
had flashed, or the lightning had smitten.</p>

<p>The travellers now equipped themselves
with staves tipped with iron, provided for the
purpose, and also with wooden shoes, furnished
with points of the same metal, to
secure their perilous footing. They toiled
till noon in silent and breathless weariness;
and after short rest and refreshment in a cavern,
whose long-depending icicles deliciously
assuaged the fever of their parched throats,
they resumed their toil with hope unabated.</p>

<p>It was not till towards sunset that Genevieve
and Arnaud began to mark and watch
the shade of perplexity and hesitation that
from time to time gathered on the face of
their guide. They had hitherto spoken but
little, reserving all their strength for their
task; but now their unbroken silence, interrupted

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

only by the "snow crunching under
their feet<sup id="ref031"><a href="#en031">31</a></sup>," and the scream of the mountain-birds,
began to appear to themselves depressing
and portentous.</p>

<p>From time to time <i>he</i> eagerly watched the
flight of the birds and the direction of the
clouds, which were wafted sometimes below,
sometimes above them. He ascended every
eminence that presented itself, and then hurried
down in cheerless silence; he examined
the peaks and bearings of the mountains with
all the jealousy of a navigator observing a
new-discovered coast; and he often removed
the snow with the end of his staff, as if to
discover some track which he expected to find,
but which was effaced or lost. Genevieve and
Arnaud observed him in silence; they began
to be afraid to communicate their fears
to each other; and with sick hearts and eyes
averted from each other, they followed him
after these interruptions in profound silence.
As they doubled a kind of mountain-cape,
where the path admitted but one at a time,

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

and the guide preceded, they were startled
by a sudden shout of joy, and struggling onward,
beheld him pointing with rapturous
action, to a mountain heaped with snow to the
summit, above which rose a dark and massive
edifice, that but for its situation would have
appeared to the travellers like a pile of rock.
The full glory of sunset tinged the mountain
from summit to base with shifting hues of
rose and purple,&mdash;a more ethereal and vivid
brightness of azure than ever flushed a summer
sky tinted the crisp and nicely-defined
crags of ice that projected near its summit,&mdash;and
one last gleam of golden light burned on
the spires and towers of the antique structure,
that, while the travellers still gazed, faded into
a sober gray, and, so short is the twilight in
those higher regions, in a few moments assumed
the dark and steely blue of an autumnal
evening.</p>

<p>"We are safe," exclaimed the guide,
clasping his hands in ecstasy: "the track is
lost; but while we bear those towers in
sight, our path is secure.&mdash;Fear not,"&mdash;he
continued answering the mute enquiry of

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

his companions' looks:&mdash;"Fear not&mdash;yonder
is the monastery of St. Montanus: there the
deluded idolaters have reared an image and
set up a high place."&mdash;"I pray thee, tell
thy tidings more plainly, brother," said Arnaud,
"and be not nice to speak the language
of Canaan amid peril like ours."&mdash;"Yonder
towers are tenanted by a community
of monks," quoth Joshua; "and surely
whatever we may deem of their creed, their
works are works of love and mercy,&mdash;they
dwell by their vow amid eternal storms and
unmelted snows, to give aid to belated and
perishing wanderers: moreover, at sunset, they
light up their casements and plant torches on
their battlements; so that their dwelling is as
a beacon among the mountains, seen very far
off. And if we double that cape of snow
where the house of the idol stands, ere dawn
I shall have discovered the path which the
snow hath effaced, even as the brooks disappear
in summer." As he spoke, he pointed
to the towers of the monastery, now blazing
like a fairy palace of fire amid the darkening
heavens, and sending long flashes of ruddy

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

light along the tracts of snow, amid which
it stood, apparently tremulous from its
very brilliancy. Thus assured, his exhausted
companions toiled to struggle up the pinnacle
of the hill opposite the convent, from
whence he told them he could make a
surer calculation of the direction he was to
pursue; but, ere they reached half way, a
sound like that described by <i>Dobrizhoffer</i>
(<i>nescio quid triste ac surdum sonans</i>,) pealed
from the caverns far below their feet, and
was echoed by a hurtling in the air, which
at once warned them of their danger, and announced
it in the same moment to be as awful
as it was inevitable. The wanderers turned
their appalled looks to the heavens&mdash;they
were as yet calm and unclouded&mdash;but their
very calmness gave a more vivid and fearful
display to the atmospheric phenomena peculiar
to those lofty regions: near the horizon.
countless meteors were traversing the heavens
in every direction, with an intensity of brightness
and vitality of motion that seemed to
render the skirts of heaven alive with ten
thousand fiery couriers; above, from the contrast

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

of the perfect whiteness of the earth, the
sky appeared blacker than jet, so that the relative positions of light and darkness seemed
utterly reversed;&mdash;the planets appeared with
a lustre and magnitude actually terrific,&mdash;Jupiter
sending out <i>rays</i><sup id="ref032"><a href="#en032">32</a></sup> like a midnight
sun, and the fixed stars burning with an
emerald light, and all surrounded by a luminous
haze that, while it doubled their size
and splendour, announced the speedy approach
of a mountain storm in all its terror
and peril. They had scarce a moment to
gaze upward, when a blast, with a snowstorm
on its wings, swept across the hill with
such frightful force, that the travellers were
compelled, clasping each other closely, to
cling to a crag to avoid being hurled down
the precipice. The blast swept on.&mdash;"Let
us seek the valley," said the guide, when he
recovered his breath; "if, peradventure, life
may yet be saved." Benumbed with cold
and stupefied with terror, they began to attempt

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

their downward course, and reached
in safety the valley that lay between them
and the towers and spires of St. Montanus,
which, between the darkened heavens and
the desert earth, burned like a constellation.
But here dangers equal to those which assailed
them on the mountain (dangers well
known to the travellers of those regions)
awaited them, not without their own full and
fearful consciousness. The hollows between
these mountains are strewn over with vast
blocks of stone detached from the declivities
by torrents, by tempests, or by time; between
these, deep pits of snow are formed,
and in the hard frosts that succeed the
storms of snow, arches of ice, resembling
bridges in their structure, their apparent durability,
and their imposing promise of security,
present a treacherous facility of passing the
hollows and shortening the path, which
those who trust to seldom survive to boast of
or repeat the experiment. Several have been
known rather to descend into the hollows, and
trust themselves to their uncalculated depth,
and then struggle up on the other side, the

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

arches of ice trembling above their heads, than
to rely on their frail and perilous support. But
now the wanderers were left no choice: a severe
frost had contracted arch to arch, multiplying
the means of destruction, while it seemed
to increase those of safety; and a heavy snow
had fallen over them, so that their passage
across the valley was alike indistinguishable,
precarious, and possibly at their first step
mortal. Here Joshua displayed all the tact
of an experienced guide: he sounded every
step with his staff across the ridges, justly
calculating, that where the deepest weight of
snow lay, there the ice was of thickness commensurate
to the imposed weight. But this
mode of <i>wading</i> doubled the difficulty: they
were up to their knees at every plunge, and
scarcely could they withdraw their chilled
and encumbered limbs when the stroke of
the staff called them to a fresh exertion.
"Bear up!" cried the guide; "if we can
but cross the valley in safety, the brothers of
that merciful order will not refuse admittance
to belated and perishing wanderers."&mdash;"On,
then, if it must be so," said Arnaud. As he

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

spoke, his teeth chattered dreadfully, and his
paralytic utterance and contracted figure began
to announce the mortal effects of cold.</p>

<p>Genevieve appeared still unaffected by
it in so alarming a degree: and it is a
singular but well-ascertained fact, that the
vitality of females, in the extremity of sufferings
from heat or from cold, far exceeds that
of the stronger sex.</p>

<p>As they crossed in safety the last ridge of
ice that lay at the foot of the ascent to the
convent, the long-suspended storm of snow
and whirlwind burst forth with aggravated
fury, and rushed through the valley with the
thunders of a wintry torrent. The travellers,
sinking and clinging fast together, tried
to evade its fury; but when they arose,
breathless and sheeted with snow from head
to foot, they perceived that its strong drift
had hid the walls of the convent to the pinnacle
of its loftiest spire, and not a gleam of
light was longer visible from their sole beacon
amid that trackless ocean of snows. The
fabric seemed to have become in a moment a
part of the mountain on which it stood; and

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

they felt that the labour of many hours could
alone enable the community to remove the
drift with which the storm had heaped their
convent from threshold-stone to battlement.</p>

<p>In an agony of despair, Joshua flung down
his staff, but suddenly seized it again, and,
waving it in a kind of triumph, exclaimed,
"Yet, yet there is hope! So nicely have
those men of the storm and the elements calculated
on their powers, that amid the snowdrifts
that heap their building to its topmost
turret, they know that the blast may be
transient and the peril small: and only on
occasions of mortal danger, which their experience,
hourly exercised on the aspect of
the elements, enables them to foresee&mdash;only
on such do they toll the great bell of the
convent, which, being heard many a mile,
warns the travellers to follow the direction by
sound which can no longer be traced by sight.
Then the convent-gates are thrown open to
all who may be in its neighbourhood, and
Raymond of Toulouse, at the head of the
Albigeois, might enter unquestioned. The bell
hath not yet tolled: safety may yet be won.

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

There is," he continued, feeling the ground
with his staff, while his benumbed and bewildered
companions gazed on,&mdash;"there is a
stair cut through the rock, that winds by a
short ascent to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I have found it!&mdash;I
have found it!" he shouted, dashing away
the snow with his staff and piked sandals,
and springing upwards with the bounding
activity of hope.</p>

<p>As Genevieve and Arnaud attempted to
follow, every bell in the Convent of St. Montanus
pealed out in that tremendous tone
which announces the last extremity of danger
to travellers. The group stood gazing on
each other, with visages frozen like their
hearts, and for a moment they seemed to
each other like their own spectres, so livid
was the hue of their utter despair.</p>

<p>Joshua was the first to start from this
trance of horror: he caught up his staff, and,
with an exclamation almost amounting to an
oath, asseverated there was still hope of winning
the ascent, and he would peril life on
the issue. As he spoke, he darted upwards
by the assistance of his pole.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

<p>"What is it thou sayest?" said Arnaud: and
Genevieve was shocked to feel that he leant
on her for support unconsciously, and his
face looked frightfully contracted. "Cheer
thee!" said Genevieve; "our brother hath
departed for a space, but he will return with
tidings of hope."&mdash;"He will," said Arnaud:
"hark! I hear his voice."</p>

<p>There was indeed a cry&mdash;a human cry,
and Arnaud feebly and deliriously echoed it:
"Didst thou not hear that voice of hope and
life?" Genevieve, shuddering, dared not
answer him: she heard the voice, and knew
its sounds were aught but those of life or
hope. The next moment, the falling body
of the guide dashed past them like a dark
meteor: he had trusted to a projecting ice-crag
for a rock, it sunk under his weight,
and he was precipitated into one of those
abysses, where it is hoped life may be extinguished
almost before the agonies of dissolution
are felt.</p>

<p>"I saw a bird fall from the cliff," said
Arnaud, in an increasingly chattering and
paralytic tone. "The birds are for the roost,

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

and the beasts for the lair, and I too am for
my rest: lean on me, while I speed to it,"
he added, leaning on her. Genevieve, who
perceived he was no longer conscious of what
he said, appeared to comply, but attempted
to lead him upwards: his weight dragged
her down.</p>

<p>"We have had a weary day," he cried:
"it is time to take rest, and here is a
place where I may repose. Art thou not
also inclined to slumber?" Genevieve, who
knew the danger of her fellow-traveller,
implored him, while her breath seemed turning
into icicles as she spoke, to resist his
fatal propensity to sleep. His heavy and
scarcely intelligible voice murmured, "I must
sleep! awake me soon, and I will aid thee:
one hour's sleep is all I ask." As he spoke,
he sunk on the snow, making faint signals to
her with his frozen hand. "God!" cried the
desolate and hopeless female, as her last companion
shrunk away to die. Her lips then
closed; and feeling that her only chance of
preserving life was exercising all her remaining
powers, she attempted to walk with all

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

the speed her benumbed joints could supply
before the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>Her senses wandered, and she imagined
she saw a giant in white armour stand menacing
her above. He menaced not in vain; the
next moment two vast arms seemed descending
from the skies to clasp her; a roar and
crash followed, maddening the mind and
stunning the ear. Genevieve tried to utter
a prayer&mdash;not for life, but for a tranquil spirit
to meet her fearful doom. Her frozen lips
refused to utter a sound, the blood seemed
congealed at her heart, she fell prostrate and
senseless, as an avalanche thundered down
from the mountains, and, shattered and dispersed
among distant precipices, flung some
of its most light and feathery flakes as far as
the spot where she lay&mdash;as the waves that
have sunk a gallant ship, throw their foam
and spray on the sole gasping mariner that
has survived the wreck and gained the
shore.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE community of St. Montanus, however
skilful in calculating the fierceness and
duration of the storms which visited that
mountainous region, were deceived with regard
to that which "shook their battlements"
that night: it was as transient as it was violent,
and the moment it had passed away,
some of the lay-brothers, with that fearless
humanity which then and <i>ever</i> will do honour
to such communities in catholic countries,
set forth to render aid to such passengers
as might have been overtaken by the
storm. They had discovered the body of
Joshua (the guide) in a snow-drift, frightfully
mangled by his fall from the precipice, and
the blood already frozen on his numerous

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

wounds; they had found also that of Arnaud,
frozen to death as he sat: and from the
peculiar fashion of their garb, and the absence
of rosary and crucifix, they guessed
that the departed sufferers were of the "sect
every where spoken against." "They have
perished by a colder death than their crime
of heresy deserved," observed the sternest
of the party. At a short distance they discovered
the almost-lifeless form of Genevieve,
and with difficulty raised and disencumbered
her of the snow. Her closed eyes and contracted
features gave no indications of that
beauty in which she once excelled all "the
daughters of woman;" but they could not
help noticing her slender and graceful form,
though under the disguise of the coarse habit
she had assumed for her journey. And she
was now in a state that disarmed the fiercest
rigour of monasticism, and she fared the
better for it.</p>

<p>There was in the neighbourhood a female
community, under the denomination of <i>Beat&aelig;</i>,
not precisely under conventual rule, but bound
by voluntary vows to exercise deeds of mercy

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

and charity to pilgrims or passengers in the
neighbourhood of their dismal and stormy
dwelling. Hither Genevieve, still senseless,
was conveyed; and after two days careful
tendance on the part of the Beat&aelig;, who were
unwearied in their work of mercy, her limbs
recovered motion, and her mind sanity. She
had been insensible during the interval; but
when her eyes, almost blinded by the fall of
the avalanche, regained their power, she looked
on the humble apartment in which she
had been placed by the Beat&aelig;, and imagined
herself in a cottage of the Albigeois again:
the wooden walls, the straw pallet, the unglazed
casement, all recalled to her memory
the images of her early existence. She gazed
around her, and saw, in a dark recess of her
narrow chamber, an aged female in a black
woollen garment, who seemed by the frequent
inclination of her head towards a figure
rudely carved in wood, in a niche of the chamber,
and by often making the sign of the
cross, to be engaged in some act of devotion.
The slight noise that Genevieve made by
raising herself on her pallet, caused the

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

female instantly to approach her she bore
in one hand a crucifix, and in the other a
small vessel of holy-water, and made eager
signs to Genevieve to kiss the one, and asperse
herself with the other. Genevieve
mildly declined the offer.&mdash;"Is this, then,
thy gratitude to Saint Montanus?" said the
ancient female, with horror in her visage.&mdash;"I
am grateful to God," said Genevieve calmly.&mdash;"What
am I to deem of thy words?" said
the Beata: "art thou a heretic, an Albigeoise?"&mdash;"After
the way that <i>men</i> call
heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers,"
answered Genevieve, who now felt in whose
hands she was, but who at the stake would
not have concealed or compromised the truth
for life itself.</p>

<p>The female instantly retired; and Genevieve,
exhausted by this short conference, or rather
by the emotion which it had caused, sunk into
a doze, in which she saw before her precipices
of snow rocked by earthquakes, and bodies
falling from them, when she was startled
from her vision, by the touch of a hand
colder than ice&mdash;it was that of the oldest of

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

the Beat&aelig;, who exercised in this community
all the authority of a prioress over nuns.
Genevieve, half-awakened, and reverting to
her late trial, exclaimed, "I know I am
banished: where, and how must I depart?"
"Even where thou wilt," said the cold and
stern Beata; "but with us thou must tarry
no longer: we have done the deed of Christian
charity in saving thy mortal life, but
may not peril our souls in sheltering a heretic
beneath these walls:&mdash;depart, and leave us.
Thou hast strength, though thou renderest
not thanks where they be due."&mdash;"Holy
mother, hear me," said Genevieve, lifting her
supplicating hands.&mdash;"Not for a word, false
heretic," said the Beata, stopping her ears
"I tell thee depart, and trouble us no more:
thy strength is restored, arise, and begone!"&mdash;"It
is not in thy nature, not in thine heart,"
said Genevieve, "to thrust forth a helpless
wanderer thus. Why was I saved from
perishing amid snows, if I must be plunged
into them again?"</p>

<p>The Beata paused for a moment; and
then said, though with evident reluctance,&mdash;"Hie

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

thee hence to a place I will point
thee to: it is but at small distance from our
domicile; there shalt thou have a holy
man for thy guide to the city of Toulouse,
where thine heretic sect loves to abide, and
whither I have heard thou wast journeying;
a holy pilgrim who goes with other purpose
will meet thee there, and be thy safe conduct;
arise, and depart."</p>

<p>Genevieve seeing there was no alternative,
arose and attired herself: her limbs tottered,
and her heart sunk; but she obeyed, and followed
the Beata to the entrance of a cave
that appeared to have been the residence of
some departed anchoret. The Beata pointed
to a seat of stone, then to the heavens, and
departed, not without a sigh. "Alas!" she
murmured, "that so goodly a vessel should
be filled with the waters of perdition!" She
then retired, leaving with fruitless precaution
a crucifix of lead within the reach of
Genevieve, and with humane consideration,
a morsel of black bread, and a cup of stone
filled with water: of these Genevieve gratefully
partook, and then retiring into the remotest
part of the cave, awaited the approach

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

of the pilgrim. It was twilight&mdash;he came
not: it was night&mdash;he came not. The night
was very dark: the cave, or rather the rocky
cell, where she was seated, grew more gloomy
and more cold every moment: it was in vain
that she tried to fortify her courage. "It is
not possible," she said, and wept; but still
the pilgrim came not; and though she still
repeated "It is not possible," she wept the
more.</p>

<p>As she raised her eyes after one of these
involuntary bursts of tearful weakness, she
beheld a strong gleam of light right before
her, darting its rays through the trees,
and, with the mingled instinct of hope and
fear, she rose and hastened forward in its
direction. Her situation, she felt, could not
be more desolate, and light itself is always
to the unhappy a kind of indefinite security
for hope and for comfort. It gleamed from
a cavern, and was often obscured by the
branches of trees; yet she pressed towards
it, and as the Beat&aelig; had fortunately fixed
their residence in a low and sheltered valley,
she had no storms to encounter, no precipices
to descend, and no ice-bridges to cross in her

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

progress. The light burned distinct, full,
and bright, guiding and inviting her progress.
As she approached slowly and fearfully, a
spectacle so wild, singular, and lovely appeared,
that both to the eye and to the imagination
it seemed to realize all those tales
of spirits of woods, and caves, and mountains,
which she was accustomed to hear from her
infancy, and which indeed might be termed
the physical mythology of persons, who,
dwelling amid the most tremendous scenery
of Nature, and witnessing her most eccentric
phenomena, are glad to shelter their terror
under the ascription of such operations to
supernatural agency.</p>

<p>Genevieve paused on the scene before
her, with a doubt whether it was an illusion
of the senses, or a deception wrought
by other power. The arch of the cave,
at the entrance of which she stood, was lofty,
but the interior sloped downwards, so as
to reduce to strong perspective the group
that occupied it, and who were visible from
the red light of a wood-fire that burned on

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

eddies passing through a natural aperture in
the roof. Within, there sat on a seat of
stone a lady "beautiful exceedingly," and
gorgeously arrayed, two maidens were beside
her, and an aged female in extravagant
foppery of habit was rocking herself,
with an appearance of extreme agitation, on
a stone right opposite the others. As Genevieve
came nearer, she could distinguish the
habit, and hear the words of the lady, who
seemed by her seat and gesture the sovereign
of that singular region. The lady's mantle
of velvet floated rich and wide over her seat
of stone; her tunic embroidered in gems
and gold on the left skirt with the blazon of
some noble house indicated her lofty rank;
and the coronal of gems that vainly confined
the dark locks that descended to her waist,
though shrouded by her veil, gave attestation
to the descent her features and carriage
claimed, even amid a place so wild and rude.
Her attendants, too, were robed in silk, and
bore costly jewels, but seemed to wear them
rather as ornaments of servitude, than appendages
of rank.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

Genevieve could discern all this, and, aware
of the dress worn by noble females at that
period, she hoped for the protection she
hardly dared to claim. The sweet sounds of
the lady's voice thrilling like most distinct and
welcome music in her ears, gave her courage
to approach still nearer, though unseen.</p>

"What now, my maidens," said the
air vision, "why look ye sad? In sooth,
liberty hath made me so happy, that I could
fancy this rude cave mine own bower."&mdash;"Look,"
she added, extending her white
arm, "what lack we here but fantasy to
change this cave into a stately chamber?
Those rugged and channelled fractures in the
roof have something in them that reminds
me of the fretted work of my ceiled chamber:
a bolder hand hath carved those lines of
stone than mortal finger that ever wrought
with implement in curious wood;&mdash;and for
tapestry," she continued, playfully catching
at the ivy that hung in fantastic wreaths
above her head and around her, "when did
clusters of leaves so richly interlace or so
verdantly glow in the arras of my bower, as
those do here?&mdash;and for the smoky light of

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

torches held by pages, have we not here a
rich and ruddy fire that throws its broad
light on all we love to look upon, in this our
<i>royaume</i> of secrecy?"</p>

<p>"And on other sights that thou mayest
not love to look upon," said one of the
damsels.&mdash;"What sayest thou?" said the
other. &mdash;"That I have twice seen a female
figure cross the entrance of this wild resting-place,"
said the attendant.&mdash;"Nay, if
it be a female form, it bodes us good," said
the lady smiling; "and thou, who wast a
mountain maid, shouldst teach me charms to
conjure. Come, then, spirit of mountain or
moor, of water or wood; come in female
form, and see if I dread thee. Ha!&mdash;a spirit
indeed," she exclaimed, as Genevieve, encouraged
by what she had heard, advanced:
"for when did earth own aught so beautiful?
Heaven forgive me!" she added, "if I have
lightly spoken of names I should have reverenced.
Thou art surely too lovely to be harmful;
yet speak, for thy silent approach awes
me."&mdash;"A mortal maiden," said Genevieve,
"and most unhappy, craves the protection
of your presence, noble lady, from the dangers

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

of this deep solitude."&mdash;"Why, this
is brave," said the lady; "here sit we like
fairy queen in this wild forest, to dispense
our elfin gifts on spell-struck wanderers and
slighted lovers. Approach, damsel, without
fear; and perchance thou mayest one day receive
token of our favour amid scenes better
suited to their inmate than this rude cavern;"
and her proud and beautiful smile, as she
spoke, showed her nothing displeased with
Genevieve's prompt recognition of her rank.&mdash;"Now
to thy tale, damsel; and look it be
wild and full of adventure, meet for the
scene."&mdash;"For Heaven's sake, Madame,"
said one of the women, "urge not the
damsel to speak, the sound of our voices
may be heard, and visitors not so harmless
pry into our solitude."&mdash;"Thou art witless,
wench, with thy fears," said the lady: "if
this fire that burns so bright betrays us not,
the soft tones of this maiden give no cause
for fear; but in sooth, mine escape from
peril, far greater than aught that may befall
us here, seems to have given me false
courage, and I feel as if there were nought

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

again to dread or to suffer in life."&mdash;"Shield
us, Marie," said the damsel, "here be steps
approaching." They listened in painful silence;
the sounds came nearer, and they
heard at length a masculine voice say,
"Thou counsellest well; let us even tie our
mules to this tree, and warm ourselves at
yon fire, for, by the mass, I chatter for very
cold." With that, two men in ecclesiastical
habits entered the cavern, and approached
the fire. The apprehensions of the lady and
her attendants seemed somewhat qualified by
the garb of the strangers; but Genevieve,
who with horror recognized in them the
men from whose violence she had been rescued
by Sir Amirald, shrunk close for concealment
behind the lady.</p>

<p>The strangers had nothing of the monk
about them but the habit&mdash;their look was sullen
and licentious: they replied briefly and uncouthly
to the greeting of the lady, and then
drew near the fire, not without casting looks
of surprise on the party, whose appearance
was so ill-suited to their situation. In a short
time, their regards became concentrated on

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

Genevieve: they began to exchange looks and
to whisper, without attending to the lady, who
was expressing, but in somewhat a timid tone,
her satisfaction at the presence of two reverend
men, whom she prayed to remain with them
till the return of their absent protector,
which was looked for momentarily. "It may
not be, lady," said the monk, on whom this
hint operated in a manner very different from
that the giver intended; "it may not be;
our errand requires haste: but we will at
least diminish your cause of care, for we must
have with us one of your fair companions."
Genevieve clung closer at these words&mdash;she
felt well the <i>one</i> intimated. "How mean
you, reverend men?" said the lady. "Forlorn
as I am by most strange accident of all that
should suit my birth and state, (of which I
might vaunt not vainly,) do me not such
wrong as to bear away mine attendants,
feeble women who can do ye none."&mdash;"And
is that maiden thine attendant lady?" said
one of them, pointing to Genevieve.&mdash;"She
is under my protection," said the lady, extending
her mantle over the shrinking form

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

of Genevieve.&mdash;"She is a heretic," said the
monks; "and we have sought her that she
may be delivered over to the secular arm,
and burnt with fire as her crime requires."&mdash;"Oh,
execute your dreadful purpose here,"
cried Genevieve, "and see if I submit not.
My father, mother, and brethren perished in
the flames; and prove me, if I have not
hereditary courage as well as hereditary
faith. But rend me not from my protectress&mdash;it
is <i>that</i> I dread."</p>

<p>The monks advanced. "Cling close to me,"
exclaimed the lady: pride, fear and anger,
chasing each other in rapid alternation of colour
and expression over her beautiful features:&mdash;"Said
I cling close? nay touch my
mantle's hem, and it shall be to thee as a
knight's broad shield. Unreverend churchmen,"
she continued, "do not such deed of
violence for shame, if not for mercy. Your
purpose cannot be so horrid as you mean.
Hold," she cried, as the monks still advanced,
"hold! the noblest maiden in France
offers herself in pledge for this damsel, and
nobly will she redeem her pledge. Trust me,"

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

she cried, extending her white arms towards
the men who had now strong
hold of their victim.&mdash;"Save me, noble lady,
save me," cried Genevieve, taking fast but
fruitless hold of the lady's robe.&mdash;"At your
peril! lewd and lawless churchmen, if churchmen
ye be," said the lady.&mdash;"Clasp me closely,
damsel; help, my maidens, help!"</p>

<p>The united force of slender hands proved
but weak against the brutal strength of the
monks; and Genevieve, with many a struggle,
but without a scream, was placed before
one on his mule, while the other led his up a
rocky defile, that, he said, would conduct them
soon to the Abbey of Normoutier. Judge
ye," he said to his companion, "if the lord
abbot will not lightly overpass our delicts in
his absence, when we have such a prisoner to
produce to him."&mdash;"Speed on," said his companion;
"we may be glad men if we reach
the abbey in safety; she, from whose side we
tore her, is a noble lady by her garb and
bearing; and should we be traced, the abbey
roof may be in a light flame over our heads
when the Crusaders have gathered head

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

again against the heretics." The monks spurred
on their mules, and Genevieve was lodged
by the next morning in the Abbey of Normoutier.
She was treated with decorum,
and even with courtesy, by the community,
who had their own reasons for preserving a
<i>bonne bouche</i> for their abbot; nor was it till
after many a day of unmolested solitude that
she was discovered, as we have related, by
the Bishop of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The object of Verac and Semonville was
to demand what aid the bishop could spare,
to assist them in their pursuit of the lady
Isabelle. The prelate promptly accorded their
boon, that he might be the sooner rid of their
presence; and a number of his armed attendants
was instantly added to their train, which
wheeled from the abbey-gates by dawn.</p>

<p>The bishop looked after the knights as they
rode, "There go arrows shot into the air," he
said internally; "in winning these prisoners,
mine hath hit the white." While the abbot,
who stood disconsolate at the gate during
their departure, exclaimed sorrowfully, "they
have drained my cellars&mdash;they have exhausted

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

my buttery&mdash;they have borne away the only
solace left me in such bereavement." He
sent a melancholy glance after them as they
rode&mdash;"But is there not a text to console me:
<i>Tu me malis Hesperidum locupletasti</i>. There
is yet some comfort in apt quotation," he
added, repeating it as he retired within the
gates of the Abbey of Normoutier.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE peril of the Lady Isabelle had indeed
approached its crisis. When the outlaw first
made prey of her, he had no further thought
but of enriching himself and his comrades by
the ransom of the noble and wealthy heiress;&mdash;when
he first beheld her, he gazed on her
"as a bright peculiar star," above his region,
though not his view; but now the habitual
familiarity of seeing and speaking to her
had suggested other thoughts and views to
a mind ambitious, daring, and amorous.
He conceived that the lady might be won
to wed him; and his pride, avarice, and
passion, were alike flattered by the thought.
He knew that the first avowal of his feelings
towards the lady had been met by her declaration

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

(seconded by no feeble action), that
she would dash herself piecemeal against the
walls of her prison were the insult repeated;
but he felt that his avowal was made in a
moment of inebriety. Thenceforth he carefully
abstained from the habit, (at least in
her presence,) and it was no slight sacrifice.
He devoted himself also to the adornment of
his person, which wanted not comeliness; he
shaved his beard, and rubbed rich essences
into his rugged hair; he arrayed himself in
splendid attire, of which he had store; he
used baths of wine, and in fine, practised mien
and 'haviour in the mirror of his polished
shield, which was now employed in no other
use. Nor was his care less to make the apartment
of the lady worthy of its inmate: tapestry
and gorgeous raiment were piled in it
day after day, and many a plundered castle
and pillaged abbey were tributary to the
apartment of the captive lady, the lavish and
barbaric splendour of which testified the magnificence
and prowess of the robber, but bore
small witness to his taste. In his new and vain
humour of adorning his person, and heaping

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

the apartment of his captive with gorgeous
furniture, the outlaw forgot his usual habit of
command over his companions; and Gerand (of
whom mention has been made) was rising
higher every hour in the estimation of the
rude and restless band, who marvelled at the
sudden effeminacy of their heretofore dauntless
leader. Even his rapacity yielded to his
adopted habits, and he forgot that a Crusader
and a Knight lay prisoner within his walls,
whose ransom at another time would have
been the weightiest matter in his thought.</p>

<p>Sir Paladour, meanwhile, had cause to congratulate
himself on the forbearance of his
captor. Perchance the want of a leech, or
the sullen neglect of that "sad dog who
brought him food to make misfortune live,"&mdash;or
the profound stillness of his prison, (for
sometimes the want of all aids to distemperature
is better than their utmost redundance)
contributed to his convalescence more than
aid, medicine, or condolement; for so it was,
that the knight at the end of some days of
delirious misery had leisure to employ his
thoughts on the deliverance of the lady, and

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

reverted even to the idea of employing that
wretched and abhorred being the lycanthrope
as an instrument of her safety.</p>

<p>It was after an evening passed in such musing
that Paladour fell into a slumber, and
dreamed that he had been contending with a
whole army of harnessed knights in the cause of
the lady Isabelle, and overcame them. His vision
went on, and he imagined that after saving the
lady against all odds, he bore her to a wild
wood, where a wolf with a human voice commanded
him to strike a dagger into her throat.
He obeyed as under a supernatural impulse;
but the moment he aimed his dagger at his
lady's throat, the wolf fastened on his with fang
and claw. He awoke in horror, and that
horror was not diminished as he discovered,
by the moon-light gleaming through the shothole,
a form hanging over him no less hideous
and formidable than that of his dream&mdash;it was
the lycanthrope, whose eyes fierce and fiery,
jaws distended, and white strong teeth fully
displayed, allowed not a feature to be visible
in his countenance, but those which assimilated

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

him to the animal his horrid frenzy
personated; his claws, too, (for so they might
be called from their length and sharpness)
were extended, and he was just about to dart
on his victim as Paladour awoke. A fierce
struggle ensued; in the first attack the fangs
of the lycanthrope drew blood from the
bosom of the knight, and his hideous yell at
the sight might have stunned and appalled
another antagonist, but his mad bites and
desultory wolfish springs were no match for
the adroit vigour of Paladour, who, when the
wretch had fastened on his shoulder, tore him
off with the loss of blood and flesh, and flung
him (as their conflict had dragged them
toward the spot) down the aperture from
which he had ascended. The body fell: Paladour
heard the sound; step after step it
rolled, a heavy lifeless weight.</p>

<p>Paladour reeled backward on his pallet,
and found in trance rather than slumber a
respite for his overwrought frame and exhausted
spirit. He had not long lain thus,
when the form of that unfortunate being
haunted his imagination and his conscience.

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

He rose with full purpose to descend into
the aperture where the body had been
thrown, but in the attempt he staggered
and fell, and it was more than two days ere
he could recover strength for the effort.
Meanwhile, all things in that lawless hold
were operating in his favour. Adolfo, in his
dream of power and voluptuousness, heeded
not treating about the ransom of a single crusader;
and his guard, who was deeply impressed
with the terrors of the haunted chamber,
scarcely allowed himself time to leave the
sorry meal on the floor, and fling the armful
of straw for the prisoner's bed, ere he hurried
from it and closed the door. Thus Paladour
was enabled, as his recovered strength permitted,
to visit the habitation of the maniac.
A lamp was left with him every night, as
the shortening days of November sent scarce
a gleam of light through the loophole of his
prison, and with this he essayed to visit the
vault; feeling something for that miserable
being, but feeling more that the knowledge
of the passages through the hold of the outlaw
might essentially aid him to work the

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

rescue of the lady. The staircase of stone,
originally ill-constructed, abrupt, and broken,
was here so precipitous and interrupted, that
the knight was compelled to hold his lamp
aloft in one hand, while with the other
he swung himself, not from step to step,
but from height to depth at random. A
moan was his only direction as he reached
the maniac's vault.&mdash;"Approach," said a feeble
voice, "approach, and fear me not:"
the maniac was stretched on a bed of stone,
like a corse laid on a bier&mdash;"approach, and
if thou canst remember a prayer, utter it for
me." The pious knight knelt beside him,
repeated what prayers he could remember,
and holding up the cross on his mantle, urged
the dying sinner to fix his sight and soul on
that token of salvation.&mdash;"With me that
avails not now," said the dying man: "come
nearer, thou needest now neither dread bite
nor blow. I am a fangless wolf&mdash;list to my
last words&mdash;they are true. Our Lady and the
saints have granted a gleam of light at the
close of my dark and stormy day, as I am
sane&mdash;but stand, I pray thee, opposite to that

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

dim light, for my memory seems to return
with my reason, and thine image floats before
me like straws in the vision of a drowning
man. I grasp, but cannot catch it: stand
fair and full, that I may view thee, if I can.
Now I see thee," he exclaimed. "Thou
art Paladour de la Croix Sanglante."&mdash;"How
knowest thou me?" said the knight.&mdash;"Hush!"
said the dying wretch, "list to me
while I have breath to speak. I know the
secret of thy life, and the fearful unfulfilled
doom that hangs over thee. Rememberest
thou aught of thy early life?"&mdash;"It was
passed in the booth of a mean mechanic in
Nismes," said Paladour.&mdash;"Is that thy earliest
remembrance?" asked the lycanthrope.&mdash;"I
have a horrid vision of antedated existence,"
said Paladour, pressing his hands on
his throbbing temples, "but recall it not,
or I shall soon be as thou wast."&mdash;"But I
<i>must</i> recall it," said the wretched man.
"Rememberest thou one who visited the
booth of that mean man, and after short converse
held with him thou wast more kindly
treated?&mdash;and rememberest thou not the

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

features of him who wrought thee such
good?&mdash;Ah! no; thou canst not. Famine,
madness, and terror, have done their fearful
work on <i>me</i>; but thou hast the glow of
youth combined with the matured symmetry
of manhood: in thee I recognize the boy I
knew at Nismes, and the youth whom I met
in afterdays, and furnished with armour of
price, and a goodly steed."&mdash;"I have deep recollection
of those most strange events," said
the knight, "but nought of who was the
agent in them."&mdash;"But <i>I</i> know," said
the dying man: "it was a female of voice
and action such as never left my memory
even in madness: it was she who gave me
gold to bribe that brutish clown&mdash;it was she
who gave me gold to purchase steed and armour.
Years passed on, and I saw her not.
I led a lawless, godless life," he added;
"but it avails not now to speak of that.
Once more I saw her when she set herself
to row a boat, to waft thee over some lake;
but ever her word was, 'Mine eye and mine
arm are on him for evil and not for good.' "&mdash;"Miserable
man!" said Paladour, "and couldst

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

thou confederate with a being such as thou
tellest of, against a child?"&mdash;"She gave gold,"
said the wretch; "in loose riot I spent the
gold she gave so lavishly; but it is falling
in molten drops that sear my heart at this
my dying hour. I travelled with a band of
pilgrims in this neighbourhood to win pardon
for my sins: we were made prisoners by the
outlaw. They deemed me wealthy, and, to
extort costly ransom, they chained me in a
dungeon within chain's-length of a fettered
wolf. Mine own dark desperate thoughts,
and the howls and boundings of my hideous
associate, made me in short space what thou
hast seen me and <i>felt</i> me too," he added
with a livid grin: "but now," he added,
"I would do, if I could, somewhat of good.
Wouldst thou not wish to make thine escape
from this hold of horror?" The answer
burst from Paladour's heart and lips together&mdash;"Shew
me but the means of deliverance for one dearer than life, and mine shall
be staked for its fulfilment."&mdash;"Thou seekest
some maiden&mdash;some lady-love," said the
other:&mdash;"but whatever she be, there have

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

been maidens as fair as she, who have revelled
at length with the ruffian-band, and sunk in
crime and passion below their tempters; and
some who have forced their desperate way to
death through casement and arrow-slit, or
flung them from the battlements. Oh! how
often have these stony chambers rung to
female cries!&mdash;and all in vain. But mark
me, if thou wouldst win thine escape, ascend
that passage through the wall&mdash;that
steep and difficult stair that winds through
it will lead thee to the terraced rock from
which the outlaw nightly watches to see his
barks heaving on the ocean; but one warder
watches that pass&mdash;for from the sea he dreads
no assault. But may not a night come when
the unmanned barks shall lie beating at the
foot of the rock, and the warder shall shrink
from his post in terror of the wolf-man, whom
living they tortured&mdash;whom dead they will
dread&mdash;whose cry, even at midnight, hath
startled them at their drunken revels and
broken their feverish sleep."&mdash;"There may,"
said Paladour: "and may Heaven assoil
thee of thy sins in requital of the good service

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

thou mayest render to its most fair and
favoured work!"&mdash;"Rave not to me of thy
love-toys," interrupted the other, "but pledge
thy faith as a Christian and knight, that
thou wilt obtain all spiritual help for mine
imprisoned soul when it is writhing in penal
and purging fires."&mdash;"I will myself," said
Paladour, "tell a bead and say an Ave for
thee every night ere I close mine eyes, and I
will cause masses to be said for thy soul's repose
by the monks of Normoutier while the
abbey stands."&mdash;"Enough," said the dying
man: "now seek the passage while I can yet
point it out to thee: it is now night in this
dungeon, and never shall I see the dawn of
another morn."</p>

<p>The evening had far advanced when Paladour
began to explore his way, and the outlaw,
according to his wont, prepared to visit
his unfortunate prisoner.</p>

<p>HER captivity and its attendant persecutions
had hitherto rather irritated than subdued
the lofty spirit of the lady Isabelle.
Accustomed from her very childhood to the
homage paid by her own sex to her rank and
by the other to her beauty, power had with
her become a habit, and constraint, specially
when imposed by an inferior, appeared a contradiction&mdash;an
inexplicable phenomenon in
life. In vain did her kneeling and weeping
women implore her to soften her looks and
language&mdash;her pride forbade even the thought;
and to behold her, on the outlaw's entrance,
seated in silence, so gorgeously attired, her

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

beauty even heightened by the flush with
which pride and anger dyed her cheek, her
eyes averted and her form motionless, one
would have imagined she sat there as the
judge, not the prisoner of the offender.</p>

Twice and thrice, standing uncovered before
her, he made his unacknowledged obeisance,
and addressed to her all that he
thought might win the ear of pride and
beauty to listen, while her trembling women
turned their anxious eyes from one to the
other. At length, "Is it the use," he said,
"of noble ladies to let their visitor stand
before them unnoticed? Is there nothing
that may win word or look from thee?"&mdash;"Such
looks," said the lady, slowly unclosing
her lips, "as I would give, would perchance
like thee ill; for words&mdash;there is but one
theme on which I deign to parley with or
listen to thee&mdash;my ransom, outlaw. Are
not the wealth and wide lands of the Lady of
Courtenaye enough to content thy rapacity?
And why am I held thy thrall, when I
proffer for my liberty what would be deemed
ransom not unworthy the daughter of King

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

Philip?"&mdash;"A ransom meet for the daughters
of kings," said Adolfo, "might yet be unworthy
such priceless beauty as thine."&mdash;"Accursed
be that fatal beauty," said Isabelle,
"that hath betrayed me to the unutterable
humiliation of this moment! It is enough to
rebuke the vanity of mine whole sex, that
the praised theme of knights and nobles hath
sunk to the mark of an outlaw's lewd and
saucy commendations."</p>

<p>"And what," said the robber, whose passions
were as high as her own&mdash;"And what
are these boasted knights and nobles themselves
but outlaws, whom wider power hath
led to deeper crimes, and glossed them with
an impunity which poorer villainy lacks?
What are the records of the far-traced ancestry
of Courtenaye, but a story of violence
and blood, of lands despoiled, towns and
castles burned, innocence abused, and foul
murders done? Did not thine own father,
lady, besiege and burn the castle of Count
Raymond of Toulouse, and massacre his wife
and children in cold blood? And did not
King Philip reward his bloody fact, with the

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

lands of him he had despoiled? The blood
of De Courtenaye, though mingled with that
of Beaurevoir, might have frozen for want in
those vaunted veins, had they not won the
wealth of plundered heretics to support their
pride! And did he not, with that same
Raymond (then his brother-in-arms, before
he was a fautor of heretics), and with that
proud and bloody priest, he of Toulouse, do
such shameful wrong to that noble heretic
lady Marie de Mortemar, that the like was
never wrought in Christian land before; and
when despoiled of all, sent her forth a maniac
and a mendicant?</p>

<p>"Now by Saint Mercury, that paynim Saint
of thieves, (I lack a Christian one for the
nonce,) a man were better go to shrift with
all the murders on his soul done by my wild
band since they harboured here, than with
such a tale as one of those ennobled murderers
hath to tell the priests who pray trembling
beside his dying bed."&mdash;"Base churl!" said the
lady, "thou canst put no difference between
the crimes of an excommunicated robber, the
enemy of heaven; and the high deeds of

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

men who marched beneath banners blessed
by the Head of the Church, and perilled
life in the cause of heaven and its holy truth.
If their zeal blazed forth too hotly, it is for
God, not man, to areed their doom,&mdash;least
of all for thee, outcast of both! But I think
scorn to hold further parley with thee. My
body thou mayest enthrall, on my sight thou
mayest obtrude thyself; but never, till Heaven's
grace or man's valour set me free, shall
these lips again be unclosed to thee, save to
treat of my ransom!"&mdash;And as she spoke she
drew her mantle round her, and wrapping
her delicate arms in it with a resolute fold,
sat in as proud attitude of defiance, as a
knight in battle opposed in panoply to a
mortal foe. "If thou wilt not answer, thou
wilt hear me," said the outlaw:&mdash;"nay thou
shalt, for I have deeply sworn it! It is not
for me who have never bent knee to man
(rarely to Heaven)&mdash;who have never vailed
bonnet to noble, or helmet to foe, to stand
curtsying for a lady's grace. Listen, lady:
wilt thou do a more glorious act than all thy
ancestry can reckon in their lawless lives?&mdash;

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

Wilt thou save a soul condemned&mdash;a body
doomed to the fiercest cruelty of the ruthless
law?" Isabelle turned on him a look of
amaze, as ignorant of his meaning. "I have
wealth," said the boastful outlaw, "to win
my peace with Heaven, I can purchase absolution
for all my forepast crimes. I have
wealth to win the name of noble from King
Philip, who sells knighthoods for gold to aid
him in his wars with John of England,&mdash;I
have wealth, as thou seest, to deck thy chamber
in this lonely tower with such adornments
as might beseem thy bower in the
lordly castle of Courtenaye. I will reconcile
me to the church&mdash;I will avouch me true
liege-man to King Philip&mdash;I will restore ten-fold
to all I have wronged or despoiled&mdash;I
will join the Crusaders with true heart and
strong arm, and lead my bold band in their
van&mdash;I will set thee free ransomless&mdash;I will
do all and aught thou shalt bid me do&mdash;so
thou wilt wed me, noble lady." The effect
which the last words produced on her to
whom they were addressed, struck him
dumb. This effect was not to be wondered

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

at. If even in modern times the union of
a noble female with an infamous convict,
would be considered an outrage on the
feelings and habits of society, what vast
allowance must be made for one who, under
the full influence of what might be
called the feudal dispensation, regarded parity
of rank as the indispensable basis of the
nuptial compact, and listened to a proffer of
marriage from an inferior, (and that inferior
infamous, and an outcast from the church,) as
she would to the horrid proposal of an union
between beings of two different species!
Isabelle sprang on her feet&mdash;both hands were
compressed on her left bosom, as if <i>expecting</i>
her heart would burst, and her eyes inflamed
and dilated seemed starting from their sockets.
She directed them right onward for some
moments, as if they could have pierced her
prison-walls; at length she turned them full
on the outlaw, and that look said as audibly
as language, "Begone this moment, or
stay and see me driven to frenzy!"&mdash;The
outlaw, with all his atrocious boldness,
was daunted at the sight: he rushed from

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

her apartment, cursing the very pride to
which he crouched, and muttering between
his closed teeth, (half vow, half imprecation,)
that he would never again quit her presence
unanswered, and never should she fare in
their next parley with impunity. For some
moments after his departure, Isabelle stood in
the same attitude, a terrific picture of agonized
beauty; her women knelt and wept
round her, but she stood as a statue among
them: not a word issued from her parted
lips, not a breath seemed to pass from them.
At length, Dame Marguerite, who had with
difficulty constrained herself hitherto, exclaimed,
"Here is a world to see!&mdash;marry if they
deal thus with high-born dames, how will it
fare with me?"&mdash;A wild hysterical laugh
burst from the lady Isabelle at these words,
which were the first she appeared to hear
or distinguish; and this laugh continued so
long and so wildly, that the damsels began to
tremble for her reason. It was succeeded by
a burst of tears copious and agonizing.
"No, my poor Marguerite," said the lady,
suddenly checking both laughter and tears,

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

"though thy treachery hath betrayed me to
this hold of fiends, I will be thy security;"
and with an action half-mockful, half-affectionate,
she patted the gray hairs on the gouvernante's
forehead: "and <i>this</i> shall be mine,"
she added, bursting from the arms of Blanche
and Germonda, leaning her forehead against
the stone-shaft that divided the window, and
gazing downward on the ocean&mdash;"this shall be
mine." At that moment the distant deep-toned
bell of a convent of nuns, near the shore, was
rung for vigils, and the sound reached the ears
of the unhappy inmates of that godless hold.
"For Heaven's sake, Madam," said the damsels,
telling their beads at the sound, "quit the
casement: we have heard that a being of horrid
and nameless nature haunts that precipice
at this fearful hour. Come from the casement,
dear lady."&mdash;"For that very cause," said
Isabelle, "will I abide here. No bodyless and
hideous phantom can shock my senses like
that form:" she stopped as if unable to utter his
name. "Perchance," she added, with increasing
gloominess, "from unhallowed things might I
rather expect aid than from aught that bears

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

the form of man. Such fearful compact hath
been; and it is in an hour like this that the
thoughts of it deeply overshadow a troubled
soul." She leaned from the casement as she
spoke: it was a calm and lovely night; the
moon was at full, not a breeze stirred the
waves, that rippled and glittered like those of
a small brook at the foot of the inaccessible
rock that formed the foundation of their prison.
"Oh! that my kinsman, the Lord of Courtenaye,
who is said to deal with the spirits of
earth and of ocean, and unless he is belied with
spirits of a darker dwelling," cried Isabelle&mdash;"Oh,
that he had taught me words to command
the dwellers of those depths below or
above in the space of a few hours one or
other must open to receive me."&mdash;"Nay, Madam,"
said the trembling damsels, "use not
such fearful words: methinks already they
have raised a fearful form."&mdash;"There <i>is</i> a
form," said the lady, bending from the casement,
"but mine eyes are dim. Alas! they
were not so," she said, "till tears obscured
them. Look forth, Blanche; is there not a
moving form on that rock? The moonlight

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

falls on it fair and full."&mdash;"It seems to me," said
Blanche, shuddering and retreating, "like a
sheeted corse in that pale light."&mdash;"It seems
to me," cried Isabelle, "like a knight in bright
armour; but, spirit or body, I will speak to it."
The figure at this moment stood right beneath
the casement with uncovered head, and
waved a kind of signal with one arm, while
it displayed in the other the favour of the lady
Isabelle, whose silk and silver glittered in the
moonlight. "Away, lady, away!" cried
Blanche, "the figure motions to thee." Isabelle, meanwhile, had recognized both the
figure and signal. "Save me, Sir Paladour,"
she cried, stretching her arms from the casement,
"save me, save me." The figure retreated
within the shadow of a buttress of the
tower, and, as well as could be distinguished,
pointed to the sky and the ocean. "It waves
thee on to some fearful deed; Oh, lady, look
no longer at it," said the trembling attendant.
"If I have life," said Isabelle, fixing her fullest
powers of vision on the figure, "it is the
Knight de la Croix Sanglante, and if he hath
life, he brings me safety: nay if it be his disembodied

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

spirit, he comes to give solemn warning,
and perchance glorious hope."&mdash;"Men
say, he perished in that wild battle with the
heretics," said the damsel.&mdash;"He perished not
there," whispered a mournful and tremulous
voice from the terrace or rather rampart;
"would he had!"&mdash;"It is his voice," cried
Isabelle, "it is the voice of Sir Paladour!
Speak; art thou indeed an inmate of this desperate
place? Speak, if thou livest?"&mdash;"I live,"
answered Paladour, "if he may be said to live
who sees the lady of his heart the thrall of a
vile outlaw, and himself a helpless and maimed
wretch, that howls in despair at the spot
he should guard with life."&mdash;"I am safe, I
am safe!" cried Isabelle, clasping her hands in
ecstasy, "I am safe if it be thou, indeed, Sir
knight; I cannot despair while thou art near
me."&mdash;"If this arm," said Paladour, "if this
heart that seems bursting from my bosom towards
the grates of thy casement, could sever
them, then should thy deliverance be wrought,
and in a moment; but the breakers that burst
at its foundation may sooner sap it from base
to battlement than mortal arm redeem its prisoners.

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

Yet, hopeless as is my gaze&mdash;worthless
as is now my life&mdash;here will I stand till I perish.
Against this rock will I plant my body, and here
shall the waves dash over me till they sweep
away my corse!"&mdash;"Utter not such mad vow,"
said Isabelle, "it were sin to keep it. The outlaw
visits my apartment, and"&mdash;"Godless ruffian,"
said Paladour, "and doth he dare"&mdash;"Oh,
heed not what he dares," cried Isabelle; "doubt
not thou that the daughter of Courtenaye
can defy all that he can dare. Away, conceal
thyself; by thine oath of chivalry I adjure thee&mdash;by
thy devotion to thy lady I command thee&mdash;risk
not for another moment a life so precious
to her. If thou canst command a secret passage,
come to-morrow evening when yon star
is as bright in heaven as now, and when its
light is seen in the waters of ocean. Be here,
and if Isabelle of Courtenaye be living, she
will speak to thee from this casement: if not,
be assured her parted spirit will bear thy
name to Paradise."&mdash;"But stay, lady," cried
Paladour&mdash;"I may not, I dare not," said the
lady: "the outlaw will visit me at this time
to-morrow night. Devise for my safety meanwhile,

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

or for my death. Away, my voice once
had power in the lordly halls of Courtenaye:
let it not plead in vain in mine hour of danger
and distress." As she spoke, the knight,
throwing himself on his knees, appeared to be
making a vow to Heaven for her safety; and
Isabelle, closing the casement, prepared to fortify
herself against the terrors of the outlaw's
next visit by the recollection of the presence
of Sir Paladour, her valiant knight and loyal
lover.</p>

<br/>

<p>NO night was more unfavourable to the
purpose of the outlaw's visit. Elated by her
interview with Sir Paladour, and the confidence
excited by his presence, the lady no
longer refused to answer him. But it was only
to return supplication by disdain, and menace
by defiance; and scarcely could she refrain
from expressing the source of that hope,
a hint of which must have been fatal to its
fulfilment.</p>

<p>Their interview ended in agonies of passion
on both sides; and almost choked by his, Adolfo
rushed from his apartment to vent it on some
inferior object. Every thing seemed combined

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

to exasperate him on that night which
was to terminate so eventfully; for in the
hall he found Gerand conferring gloomily
with some of the band whom the detention
of the prisoners without ransom had long rendered
malcontent and mutinous. He glared
on them for a space in silence, and the robbers,
who knew him dangerous in his mood,
one by one quitted the hall without speaking&mdash;Gerand
alone remained. Adolfo, seizing a
cup of wine that stood on the board, and
draining it in a draught, dashed it on the
ground, and crushed its sides together with a
stamp of his foot. He then strode up to
Gerand, so close that their inflamed and
scowling visages almost touched each other.
"And what make ye here," he said "brooding
treason with those damned dogs?"&mdash;"Because,"
said the surly Gerand, "the
company of <i>men</i> likes me better than that of
women, or of men whom folly hath unmanned!"&mdash;"By
Heaven, he speaks but truth,"
said Adolfo, throwing himself on a seat that
rocked with his force: "I must be spell-bound&mdash;something
superhuman, whether of good or

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

evil, guards her. Was it not that first night I
spoke to her of love that a groan which chilled
the blood was heard, and a sound that resembled
the fall of an armed giant?"&mdash;"What,
witch-ridden as well as woman-ridden?" said
Gerand, with a sneer: "thou art a proper leader
for men who should be without fear&mdash;for shame&mdash;shake
off thy folly, hold the prisoners to ransom
without further fond delay. Our coffers
need replenishing, the band are finely holpen
to jeopard life for those fringes and fooleries
thou deckest out thy most uncourtly person
withal."&mdash;"An' it resembled thine," retorted
the other, "the task were hopeless; but what
hast thou to do or to dictate in this matter?
She is mine, my prisoner and my prize; won
by stratagem never devised in thy dull brain&mdash;won
in the heart and heat of battle, while
thou wast hovering on its skirts. Mine she is,
and mine shall be, and I will hold her to
ransom or detain her in these walls at mine
own pleasure."&mdash;"At thine own peril," thundered
the other; "what! shall we lose our
prize because the fool is love-sick? She is ours
as well as thine; we ventured life for her too,

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

though not in vain careering in a battle-field,
where, hadst thou been known, crusader and
heretic alike would have turned against thee.
Nay, never lay hand on your dagger; I tell
thee, that if she be liberated, we will share in
her ransom to the last liard, and if she be held
in thrall, she shall be mine, and every man's;
thine perchance the last."&mdash;"Gerand," said the
outlaw, his voice dropping from its high and
wrathful key to one unnaturally low and soft&mdash;"Gerand,
be warned; I feel the fiend unchaining
within me!"&mdash;"Warn those that fear
thee," cried Gerand; "I care not, I, if fifty
devils and fifty drivellers like thee were unchained
together!" They were the last words
he ever spoke; the dagger of Adolfo was in
his heart, and so sudden and deep was the
blow, that the body dropped on the floor
without a groan. Adolfo paused a moment
over his deed of blood. Impenetrable to
remorse, perchance he felt something like
regret at the murder of one who, though surly
and savage in his mood, was the most brave,
faithful, and long-tried of his associates&mdash;a
half-sigh escaped his lips, and looking round

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

him vacantly, he exclaimed, "Why do ye all
stare at me thus?" The silence and loneliness
of the hall struck him as he spoke, and he felt
that terrible necessity of vehement excitement
to which men of desperate habits feel as fatal
and indispensable attachment, as the victims of
inebriety to the cup of fever and of poison.
He stamped with his foot, and some of
the banditti entered. They had heard the
loud voices and the sudden fall, but they
were not prepared for the terrible result.
They recoiled and looked aghast; "Take up
that body," yelled Adolfo, "and bear it to the
chamber of the lady. Shrink ye? by heaven or
hell, if ye hope or fear either, the dagger that
is yet warm from his heart shall not lack life-heat
again and soon, if your craven hearts can
yield it. Take up that body: ho there, bear
a torch and follow to the lady's chamber."
Terror seemed to have wrought the effect of
full submission on these fierce and lawless
men. They raised the body; one bore
a torch, and the unfortunate prisoners soon
heard those heavy steps that announce
weighty load ascending the stair of stone.

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

The door was instantly barred, and the women
put all their strength, as the voice of the
outlaw was heard demanding admittance.
"The bolt is drawn," answered the lady Isabelle,
"and no hand in this chamber shall
undraw it!" One spurn of the muscular ruffian
sent bolt and door in splinters before
him into the chamber, while, spite of the
shrieks of the females, he commanded the
body of Gerand to be laid at the feet of the
lady Isabelle, who in the agonies of tortured
pride and harassed feelings had no other
resource than to hide her head in the bosom
of her nearest attendant.</p>

<p>"Behold thy work!" cried the outlaw;
"there lies the corpse of one with whom living
I have stood twenty years foot to foot, and
arm to arm, when nobles and knights quailed
at our very name. Murder is on my soul for
thee! foul murder, and thou shalt make deep
atonement."&mdash;"Look," he cried, rudely dragging
her to the casement, "the elements
in all their wrath and power, the passions of
man in their fiercest excitement, rise as sworn
against thee. Lo, there an ocean moats thee;

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

lo, here a moat of blood! How deem that
thou canst escape or defy me, when I am
seated in my empery of embattled rock, the
ocean my moat, and trample on the body
of my last human foe, as I do thus?"</p>

<p>This moment of horror was fatal to Isabelle's
resolution, and almost to her reason.
Half-frantic at the horrid spectacle before
her, and at the insults of the outlaw, all
prudence forsook her, and she exclaimed,
wresting her raised arm from him with all
her strength, "False traitor! there be within
thy walls the means to work my deliverance!"
Dark lightning flashed from the
outlaw's eye. "By hell! there is treachery
here!" he exclaimed: and he called over
rapidly the names of his followers. "No
not one of them!" he cried: "they are
faithful!&mdash;They saw their great idol hewed
down without a murmur! Thou prayest to
another saint! that fair-formed youth, that
Sir Paladour: fetch him hither on the instant,
that he may perish in her sight!"</p>

<p>Isabelle, in vain and late repenting of her
temerity, now cried aloud, "No! no! not

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

him! not him, I swear!" But the order
was already obeyed by the willing messengers
of the chief; and the lady, collecting in
brief space all her remaining self-possession,
felt that strongly denying all interest in the
life of Sir Paladour was now the only means
left of preserving it. She had scarce time
for the effort, or, rather, for the resolve to
make it, when Paladour was dragged into
the chamber.</p>

<p>"And is this unarmed and beardless minion,"
shouted the robber-chief, "the champion
who must set thee free!&mdash;A proper stripling
he for dalliance in a bower. Is this he?
Speak, and confirm his doom!"&mdash;"He is in
thy power," said Isabelle, vainly struggling
for indifference of look and voice: "he is in
thy power, thou man of blood; but thou art
deceived, if thou deemest I have more interest
in the life of thy prisoner, than I have
ever had in that of the innocent and the
stranger."</p>

<p>"Strike, outlaw!" said Paladour with uncontrolled
emotion, "and try if thy dagger
can pierce so deeply as her words."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

<p>"Bring not such deep guilt on your soul,"
said Isabelle, trying to plead without betraying
a vital interest in the cause: "murder not
in mere wantonness." These words were spoken
feebly and with many pauses, as if she
dared not trust herself with her own emotion;
then on a sudden her form expanded,
and her voice burst forth in its loftiest tones:&mdash;"No,"
she cried, "I cannot&mdash;I cannot thus
basely perjure mine heart!&mdash;he <i>is</i> my knight,
my champion, and my love! Forgive me,
Sir Paladour," she cried, "if my words have
cost thy noble life; but I can better brook
the thought of dying with thee, than of
denying the love I bear thee!"</p>

<p>"A single life is too mean a price to pay
for such blessed hearing," said the grateful
and impassioned Paladour: "and these last
moments of my brief existence I prize above
centuries of base and common life."</p>

<p>"Mean as is the price, it must be paid
on the instant!" said the outlaw, unsheathing
his dagger.</p>

<p>"O for the arms!" cried the unfortunate
youth, vainly grappling with the ruffians who

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

held him a fixed and obvious mark for their
leader's blow;&mdash;"O for the arms of which
thou hast despoiled me! even those in which
I met the giant-force of Simon de Montfort,
and bore him down in my career like the
rooted oak before the whirlwind! And now
to perish by a felon's blow, with pinioned
arms and naked breast!" and the burning
drops of agony, which he could not lift his
hands to wipe away, gushed from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Rend open his collar and doublet!" cried
the outlaw, "that there be no hidden charm
or spell concealed in his bosom to blunt my
dagger-point."</p>

<p>"False robber!" said Paladour, as the
order was rudely obeyed, "I never used
charm or spell when dealing with harnessed
knight in the lists, or men-at-arms in the
field, far less against thee, felon!"</p>

<p>At this moment Isabelle, with a dreadful
shriek, flung herself at the feet of the robber.
"Save him! save him!" she cried: "at
the feet of King Philip I would not kneel
in vain for the life of a felon; and must I
kneel to thee in vain for the life of a noble

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

knight? Am I not humbled? am I not
wretched enough? O man! if man thou
art, shew mercy!" The soft touch of her
hands sent the blood in tides of fire through
the veins of Adolfo: he looked on the proud
prostrate beauty half in triumph, half in
compassion; his heart softened, and not a
tear, but a moisture of mingled sensibility
and passion, shaded his dark eyes as they
rested on her. "Save him!" repeated she,
catching with rapid instinct the sign of the
melting mood, "and I will&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" "Thou
wilt what?&mdash;speak, speak! The dagger is
in mine hand, and thy lover's white bosom,"
he added, gnashing his teeth as if the words
gave him torture in the utterance, "is bared
to my blow. What wilt thou do?&mdash;speak!"&mdash;"I
will&mdash;I will&mdash;deliberate on thine offer!"
cried Isabelle, wringing her hands in extremity
of almost mortal agony: "demand
no more, or, in my desperation, I may be
unable even to do that!"</p>

<p>At that moment, the blast of a horn,
that seemed to come seaward, reached their
ears. Isabelle sprang on her feet with a

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

shriek of joy. "Deceive not thyself, lady,"
said Adolfo; "those be the blasts wound by
my sea-purveyors, who coast along the shores
of Languedoc. Hark and thou wilt hear
their signal answered by our warder." Isabelle
stood speechless before him, as four
blasts were distinctly wound by the warder,
who was placed on the turret seaward. "I
must see my bold fellows," said the outlaw,
"and take count of what they have brought.
Forgive me, noble lady, that strong circumstance
enforces mine absence," he added,
making a low obeisance to the lady, who
unconsciously answered it with stiffened
joints and features convulsively fixed. "Bear
the prisoner to his chamber!" he shouted,
recovering his natural tone; "his life hangs
on the lady's lips. Lady, thy resolve must
be taken within the hour; look it be taken
wisely."&mdash;"It is taken already," said she,
when the door was closed, and all but her
women had departed, "it is taken already,
but thou shalt never hear it from my lips."
She flung open the casement and looked
down on the ocean, tossing in its dark

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

strength beneath. "My deep and eternal
bed!" she said internally, "where ten thousand
wild arms are reaching upward and
grasping to receive me; and must I sleep on
thee at last, and must I cast myself, with
horrid, high-nerved spring, into thy cold and
gulfing safety? I had hoped for calm and
noble rest: I had deemed that Isabelle of
Courtenaye would have slept amid her high
ancestry, her effigy carved on her tomb amid
praying saints and holy emblems; but now
the wave must be my winding-sheet, and the
ocean my grave!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, Sir Paladour, who had
not lost a moment, after being replaced
in his prison, in winding up the secret
passage, by which he regained the terraced
rock seaward, whereon the casement
opened, stood in her view. The night was
dark and stormy. "Who stands there?"
said the lady, as she held the casement open.&mdash;"I
and despair," said Paladour, reft of
all hope. "O lady, what will betide thee
now?"&mdash;"O fear not for me, Sir Paladour,"
said the noble maiden; "the daughter of

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

the lordly line of Courtenaye, the daughter
of a hundred heroes, lacks not the spirit
of her lofty race in this her last extremity!
The ocean is cold, but it is deep; and my
corse shall welter on its waves, ere I become
the prey of a godless outlaw. A boon, my
love!" she cried. "When my falling body
flashes past thee, utter a prayer for the soul
of her who preferred even crime to infamy,
and would rather endure added ages of
suffering in that future and dreaded world,
than undergo one moment's shame in this!"</p>

<p>At this moment, the near approach of
the boat compelled Sir Paladour to conceal
himself behind a projecting crag,
whence he perceived two men advance from
the opposite end of the terrace, both armed
with spear and dagger, and one of them
bearing a torch: "Ho comrades!" he shouted
to those in the boat, "what bring ye to
put in the eagle's beak?"&mdash;"The carcasses of
four fat beeves," answered one of them, "and
a goodly tun of Malvoisie.&mdash;Marry, there is a
foolish cask of Greek wine, which I hold to
be hot and unmeet for our leader, who is of

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

a fiery humour: come down, and help me to
hide it in the nook you wot of"&mdash;&mdash;"By
the mass, and will, with all content," quoth
the other, preparing to descend.&mdash;"Tarry
thou here," he said to his companion, "and
should the wolf-fiend appear, 'tis but shooting
an ave or a couple of credo's at him, and <i>probatum
est</i>, as the fat friar of Saint Bernard's
was wont to say, it will be all the better for
thy soul, for naught but the fiend himself
could terrify thee into uttering a prayer."
The other made no answer till his comrade
was out of sight, and then&mdash;"Tarry here,
and stand shooting credo's at a fiend, who
would use no more conscience but to
bear me to his den and devour me! The
very warder dare not abide on his turret
at this fearful hour&mdash;marry, for that he is
a craven and a coward. Were I on such
vantage post I think scorn to yield the fiend
an inch, but being as it is&mdash;&mdash;They dare not
report of me either," he said retiring, "seeing
I overheard them in the matter of the Greek
wine."</p>

<p>With joy almost to agony did Paladour

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

watch the sound of his departing steps.
The warder absent from his post&mdash;the boat
at the bottom of the cliff&mdash;were it but possible
for the lady to gain the terrace, her liberty
was won; from thence to the bottom was a
descent safe though irregular. Compelled to
conceal himself till the boatmen had toiled
up the rock with their burthen, he at length
saw them disappear, heard a postern gate
open and close, and once more placed himself
beneath his lady's casement. "Hist, lady,"
he called, "Heaven has not deserted us&mdash;all
have departed&mdash;a moment is ours&mdash;and if
thou hast the means of lowering thyself from
the casement to where I stand, ere dawn
thou shalt be safe from this hold of horrors."
And soon Sir Paladour by the lights
within the chamber saw, with strained
eyes and throbbing heart, all employed and
exerting their utmost strength to fasten a
strong coil of rope to the stanchion of
the casement. It was done at length, and
one of the damsels proposed to try its
strength by descending before the lady ventured.
"No," said Isabelle, "it never shall

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

be said that the lady of Courtenaye was
taught courage by her waiting-damsel." She
began to descend, and after a few moments
of anxious agony Sir Paladour held her safe
in his arms; the rest followed swiftly and
safely. The descent to the spot where the
boat lay was accomplished without danger,
and almost without difficulty: they reached
it&mdash;they embarked. Not a word was uttered&mdash;scarce
a breath drawn; no whispered congratulations,
or even whispered fears; the
danger was too great for fear. Sir Paladour
seized the oars, and for the first time attempted
to ply them. Their splash at once
aroused the warder, who was only shrinking
within his bartizan. Instantly the warder
sounded his horn, till tower and rock, sea,
air, and heaven resounded; and at the blast
the tower rang with the hasty tramp of
armed feet. Lights gleamed from every loophole,
and in a second torches were gleaming
from battlement and bartizan, and their
fierce red light discovered to the fugitives
Adolfo on the summit of the tower, surrounded
by his band, while each and all,

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

more to shun the rage of Adolfo than from
well-liking to the cause, hastened from the
battlements in pursuit. Then the lights flashed
thicker through embrasure and loophole,
and in a moment a score of arrows from every
aperture in the edifice that gave room and
mark to the archers, whistled over the bark
that bore the fugitives; they fell far beyond
them. Paladour plied the oars faster and
faster with his utmost strength.</p>

<p>Adolfo, after glancing his eye downward
for a moment, approached the bartizan,
where the warder still stood sounding his
horn. The wretched man saw his doom in
this movement, and with his utmost strength
he clung to and wound about a pinnacle of
the battlement. He seemed growing into the
stone, uttering all the while the most fearful
cries. Adolfo, without unclosing his lips,
wrested the clinging and screaming wretch
from his hold as a boy would unroot a weed
from between stones with his fingers, held
him for a moment in the air, and then dashed
him from the summit of the tower into the
ocean. The next moment the outlaw had

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

reached the terrace, and, not lingering on the
descent, flung himself by desperate bounds
like a chamois from crag to crag, and dropping
alone into the other boat, plied both
oars in pursuit of the fugitives. He had
every advantage. His strength was that
of a giant&mdash;he was armed&mdash;his boat was
light, and free from all burthen but his own,
nor was he unpractised at the use of the oar;
while Paladour, who had never handled one
before, rowed a heavy boat with four passengers,
and with strength much enfeebled by
his late conflicts. Nevertheless he persevered,
though he knew not, when he reached
the shore, which the far-projecting promontory
of l'Aigle sur la Roche made his point
of bearing, where he might find shelter for
the lady and her women.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the outlaw gained fast upon him&mdash;the
spray tossed up by the dash of his oars
fell on the deck of their boat, and the waves had
now scarce room for a ripple between. With
agonized strength Paladour plied the oar&mdash;they
were not a bow-shot from the shore.
"Oh! thou wilt perish in this toil," cried

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

Isabelle, "and I cannot be saved." Paladour
had no longer breath to answer: with a deep
and long-drawn respiration he made his utmost
effort, and the boat touched the shore.
Recovering his breath, "Fly where thou
canst, lady," he cried, "while I deal with
the pursuer." The outlaw's bark touched
the shore the same moment; and Paladour,
armed only with the oar which he had caught
from the boat, repeated his adjurations to the
females to escape. Adolfo, planting his armed
foot on the strand, advanced dagger in hand.
By matchless dexterity Paladour twice foiled
him with the oar at two fierce assaults, while
the women made vows to every saint in heaven.
The outlaw's dagger was within an
inch of his bosom, when a figure, distinctly
visible in the light of the torches that still
blazed on the battlements, darted forward,
and, with a force and speed that seemed more
than human, plunged a weapon into his
heart. Adolfo fell, battering in his dying
agonies the rock with his impotent dagger.
Paladour, leaning breathless and panting on
the oar, raised his eyes, and beheld in his preserver

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

the dreaded form of the maniac. The
terror which her presence always inspired
seemed almost aggravated by her last daring
action, though he owed life to it; and he
could not choose but exclaim, "Was that
blow dealt indeed by the hand of woman?"&mdash;"Well
mayest thou ask," she replied, "when
such another had long ago set me free; but
if I lacked courage to repel my wrongs, despair
hath at last nerved me to avenge them.
In mine hour of suffering I was like that
gaudy fainting minion; in mine hour of vengeance
I became what thou seest me." Paladour
gazed on her in awe and horror, as if
fearing to ask counsel of her. "Take up
that frail burthen," she said, "and follow me.
I will conduct thee to a cave where thou
mayest be unmolested. It is known to few
but me; it is a rude retreat, but there at
least will be safety for thy companions, and
repose for thee." And she began to ascend
a rock that wound from the shore, with that
firmness and rapidity that marked all her
movements. Paladour followed, bearing the
lady in his arms; the affrighted women came

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

last, deeming all that had past a vision, and
crossing themselves as they gazed on their
fearful guide. As she reached the summit,
the blaze from the tower threw its
red light far on the sea, tinting the dark
rocks with a partial gleam, and dimly revealing,
as with a meet funereal light, the
outstretched corse of Adolfo. "Eagle of the
rock," she exclaimed, "how sudden was thy
fall; how low thy bed; how profound thy
rest! Hosts might in vain have assailed
that eyry which was robbed of its proud inmate
by the hand of a woman! No more
shall the land be darkened under thy outspread
pinions, no more shalt thou pounce
with talon and pierce with beak!&mdash;How
fiercely but now did corporeal power
and excited passions hold mortal strife on
that stilly spot?&mdash;Shall it be thus with me?"
she cried, "shall I lie so calm when at
length my task is wrought, and my struggle
overpast. Oh, no; the passion that has become
the essence of my being will become
identified with my disembodied spirit, and I
shall still hover over such scenes, and prompt

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

such purposes, and witness such deeds, unseen
perchance, but not unconscious!"</p>

<p>And she hastened on, seeming to pursue
the subject in inward mutterings, till they
reached the cave. On the floor lay a heap
of dried leaves and implements for kindling
a fire, and there were even some rude refreshments
spread on a projecting block of
stone that seemed to present itself for the
purpose in that wild retreat. As Sir Paladour
entered the cave with his burthen, the
loosened hair and floating garments of the
half-senseless Isabelle streamed over his
shoulder and swept the floor; her utter helplessness,
contrasted with her costly habit,
seemed to strike the imagination of the
maniac.</p>

<p>"How mockfully," she said, "those trappings
of pride and power glitter on a thing
so fragile, so powerless and yet passionate!
I marked her <i>look</i>, when I did the <i>deed</i>. She
seemed as if she could have killed with eye,
but never with hand; and that jewelled
blazonry on her tunic's skirt," she cried,
touching it, "would that have been a shield

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

against the talons of the eagle? The high
heraldry of Marie de Mortemar, as nobly attested
and as gloriously engemmed, was no
available defence against wrong and outrage."</p>

<p>Then suddenly turning to the preparations
for the fire, she lighted it, and in a few moments
a cheerful flame blazed through the cavern.
"Ye are no unexpected guests here," she
said, pursuing her task: "this fuel hath been
stored for many a day; these coarse viands
have been changed every day in hope of visitants,
for I deemed that the stout heart
and valiant arm I summoned to aid, would
do its work, and not leave the task to be
finished by a woman. Yet on these shores
have I wandered day and night to watch the
tower. I lacked not the wild converse of
the spirits of the storm and the spirits of the
sea in my wanderings." She checked herself,
as feeling the presence of her trembling listeners.
"Now list to my counsel," she cried;
"watch well your ruddy fire, for the wolf
and bear excepted, (whom the blaze will
scare,) I know no visitant ye have to dread.
That fairly-painted piece of clay," pointing

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

scornfully to Isabelle, "lacks repose for the
night. Let her for once feel it may be tasted
as deeply on a pillow of stone as of down.
But, ere the dawn, seek the convent of the
Benedictine nuns, whose bell thou mayest
have heard toll, even in that godless hold. It
is but half a league; the lady's dainty feet
must learn to pace that distance. Place her
in those walls whose reputed sanctity has
defended them from the outlaw during his
whole rapacious and bloody career!"&mdash;"But,"
answered Paladour, "I lack both horse and
arms, and how may I defend the lady of
Courtenaye from violence, should she be
assailed again traversing this wild country,
an unarmed man her only champion? And
will the holy nuns thou tellest us of, find me
steed and armour?"&mdash;"Interrupt me not:
talk not to me," said the maniac, if such she
was; "in my few moments of sane thought
I brook not to be questioned or doubted.
Take my counsel while yet I can give it; save
that fair feeble thing thou dotest on; place
her amid walls thou deemest holy, and ere
the following morn, a harness and steed,

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

such as knight may bear and bestride in the
day of battle, shall be thine. Thou doubtest
still, but remember that will is power, and
that none capable of forming such purpose
as mine ever lacked the means to fulfil it."</p>

<p>"Thou seemest like one who would scorn
aught of thanks," said Paladour, doubtfully,
"yet must I thank thee for my life."&mdash;"Thank
me for life," she repeated, with a
shriek of fierce derision, "thou art a right
grateful fool to thank me for that which all
feel a curse, save when they are employed
in making it a curse to others. Forbear, till
thou hast cause to thank me; our gratitude
may perchance then be mutual; and now,
Sir Paladour, I crave a boon: I must confer
with thee for a space apart and alone.&mdash;Ha!
shrinkest thou? feeble and forgetful being;
did not the hand that beckons thee forth
strike dagger into thy foeman's heart within
this hour?"&mdash;" 'Tis even true," said Paladour,
musing, "and I must trust, though I
must also tremble at thee."</p>

<p>As he spoke, she turned away, and approached
the lady Isabelle where she sat recovered

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

from her swoon. She lifted up her veil
and gazed on her for some time in silence, while
the lady recoiled, but did not dare to resist her.
"That visage," she said with emotion, "might
make a fiend falter in his purpose, but apostate
humanity is more depraved than angelic&mdash;their
original estate was lower, and lower
perchance is their fall: it moves not me!"&mdash;she
dropt the veil, and beckoning to Paladour
who followed reluctantly, quitted the cavern.
Meanwhile, the spirits of the lady rose with
the consciousness of recovered liberty: she
drank for the first time water out of a wooden
cup, and said, "it liked her better" than
wine from the gemmed goblets at her castle-board:
she tasted the rude refreshments, and
they pleased her more than crane and peacock,
manchet or marchpane; and she was
conversing even gaily with her damsels, when
Genevieve, as has been told, besought her
protection, and was almost instantly torn
from it. The glow of agitation and anger was
still on Isabelle's brow, when Paladour and
his companion returned. The countenance of
the former was as that of the dead. "It is mere

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

weariness," said the lady, touching with her
delicate fingers his damp and pallid forehead.
"Would it were!" said the youth, with a sigh
that shook his frame. At that moment she
perceived the ring on his finger had disappeared,
and remarked its loss&mdash;"Would I
might never again see it!" said he heavily.</p>

<p>The maniac threw a glance into the cavern,
but did not enter. "No," said she; "in
her best and brightest days, Marie de Mortemar
was never aught like thee.&mdash;Whither
now?" she murmured, as in self-debate&mdash;"for
my mind begins to darken again!&mdash;On
to the castle of Courtenaye&mdash;to the
castle with my best speed. My spells begin
to work, and the spirits to throng within
my circle, and my toil of twenty years
shall not at length be in vain:"&mdash;and with unwearied
strength and spirits she pursued all
that night her way to the castle, and at daybreak
descried a troop of horsemen led by
two knights fully armed, traversing the plain
on which she had just entered. "By Marie,"
said he who rode foremost, "the very maniacal
who did us to wit of the enthralment of

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

our lady.&mdash;Dame," he continued as she came
near, "we have fared forth as thou seest:
tell us if we are near the eagle's eyry?"&mdash;"Turn
back," she answered without pausing
or looking up&mdash;"the eyry is cold, and the
eagle's pinions are furled for ever. Laggards
that ye are in love and in war, turn back."&mdash;"By
the mass, an thou railest so on me,"
quoth Semonville, "the end of this lance
shall teach better manners to that crazed
head of thine!"&mdash;"Tush, she is a woman,"
said Verac.&mdash;"All the better," quoth the other;
"had it been a man I might have feared
him, but thinkest thou I fear a woman?&mdash;By
the mass, not one that lives, specially being
old and crazed."</p>

<p>At the last word, the maniac cast a
commanding glance of perfect intelligence
on him. "The spark," she said, "the
last spark that glimmers on the dismantled
hearth of the hovel is often brighter than the
blaze of castled halls. I would not change
my gleam for thy broad dull light."&mdash;"Heed
him not," said Verac, "but put us suddenly
in possession of thy tale. Hath the outlaw

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

perished? Hath the lady won her liberty? And
is our quest in vain?"&mdash;"All shall be told
in few words," she replied; "Sir Paladour
hath achieved the lady's liberty. Sir Paladour,
mark ye me&mdash;he who levelled the bold and
brutal challenger of her dowry with the sand
that strewed the lists, while thou," to Semonville,
"wast caught and cast like a wildcat
from his throat: and thou," to Verac,
"wast flung into the air like a fan of feathers
tossed by some gay lady to her damsel.&mdash;Sir
Paladour hath achieved the lady's freedom&mdash;that
freedom she will soon resign to him.&mdash;Haste,"
she said, telling rapidly but distinctly
their way; "haste, or if they be not
there, there is a convent near. Your men-at-arms
were better employed in the safe-conduct
of a noble lady, than in withstanding a
wretched maniac on her way.&mdash;Haste, or ye
will be late to bear Sir Paladour's train at
the bridal."&mdash;"The bridal!" echoed both.
"Yes," said the maniac, "the bridal, and I too
haste to be there. I must be the bride's bower-woman:
I must bind her hair and smooth
her pillow."&mdash;"Thou," said Semonville, with

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

inextinguishable laughter&mdash;"thou, thou wilt
be a meet bower-woman for a noble bride!"&mdash;"Thou
sayest true," she replied; "for I alone
can bind her hair in a braid no hand can untwine,
and smooth her pillow in such wise
that never shall she wish to raise her head
from it again."</p>

<p>"I tell you," she cried with raised voice
and awful energy of action and mien, "I will
be at that bridal, and they shall not hereafter
talk of bride or bridegroom, but they shall
say that&mdash;<i>I</i> was there! Now pursue your
course, as I shall mine:"&mdash;and she parted
from them. "This comes of thy folly," said
Semonville to his companion angrily: "thou
must needs tarry on the way to have curious
and costly habits made, as if the matter
lacked not the steel harness rather than the
satin doublet; or, as if thou wert sure of
the lady's hand before thou hadst even
achieved her liberty."&mdash;"Content thee," said
De Verac, placidly; "were she even now
standing at the altar, I would win her away.
It is not in woman to resist a fashion so
richly fancied."&mdash;"In the name of all the

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

devils," said Semonville, thoroughly provoked,
"what is there to content me, if after
sharing in the charges and peril of the enterprise,
my reward is to stand by and see thee
wedded to the lady in a new doublet of tissue?"&mdash;"The
border shall be overlaid with
silver as more congruent," said Verac, scarce
hearing him, "and then thou shalt see the
lady's fancy made captivate by the garb as
much as her person was by the outlaw."&mdash;"This
passes," said Semonville, giving up all
further expostulation. Then as he rode on in
moody deliberation, "I do plainly begin to
perceive that I have been made a fool!&mdash;but
by more saints than I can now remind me of,
if the lady doth not wed me incontinently,
I will advise her of the charges I have been
at in the wooing; such as arms, masquing
habits, rich liveries for my train, and other
fooleries; and she shall pay me to the last
liard, or I would I might never see mine own
castle again."</p>

<p>"Therein," said he smiling internally,
"will I outwit Verac, and all her other
wooers, from whom I shall hide my device,

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

or they would all doubtless be beforehand
with me:" and with a kind of sulky joy, he
rode in silence.&mdash;It was noon when they
reached the cavern which the fugitives had
not yet quitted, and found Sir Paladour
buckling on a suit of armour as black as jet,
which with a stately steed of the same hue
had been presented to him at break of day,
by a person of singular appearance, who had
refused to tell either whence he came, or who
employed him.&mdash;Thus equipped, and with
the welcome accession of Verac and Semonville's
armed followers, the party set on to
the castle of Courtenaye.</p>

<p>"IT is his living image!" said the Lord of
Courtenaye as a few nights after these events
he sat in that closet-chamber (to which few
but himself had access), and gazed gloomily
on a portrait from which the black curtain
was partially withdrawn. It was that of a
young and handsome knight in armour, his
hand on a sword, his helmet lying on a table
beside him&mdash;his hair fell in thick ringlets on
his shoulders, and on the margent was written&mdash;Remond&mdash;anno
Salvatoris Mundi 1192.
"It is his living likeness!&mdash;the same triumphant
and insulting beauty, the same smile
that his father bore when he mocked my impotent

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

body and distorted mind, and swore
they were alike crooked.&mdash;Did I not fall prostrate
at his sight in my castle-hall, as if
pierced by a sword?"&mdash;Still gazing on the
portrait&mdash;"I dared not to beard thee
then, when thou wast companion-in-arms
to mine elder brother, and I was the broken
and sightless branch of the root of Courtenaye!
But did I not repay thee?" he cried,
shaking his weak hand at the lifeless portrait.
"Blood and life were paid down for gibe and
jeer, when thou didst join with the heretics,
and my fierce brother at my urging left not
wife or child, male or maiden, alive within
thy walls." His eye, that seemed to threaten
the portrait as he spoke, wandered wildly&mdash;"And
yet, and yet&mdash;he was within these
walls a living being ere long."</p>

<p>The cloth that covered the door was now
hastily withdrawn, and Thibaud rushed in exclaiming,
"Tidings, my Lord of Courtenaye,
of the lady Isabelle!"&mdash;"Would that the lady
Isabelle lay coffined at my feet!" quoth her
kinsman; "her foolish beauty hath made my
castle the resort of wooers, and among them

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

came one fitter to dig it from its foundations
than to add one pinnacle to its battlements,
unless to place his own blazon there."&mdash;"I
deemed thou wouldst have been well pleased
to hear of the safety of the lady Isabelle,"
said Thibaud sullenly.&mdash;"The fiend fetch the
lady Isabelle and thee!" said his lord. "Does
it pleasure me to hear that my coffers must be
emptied for her ransom; for such I deem is
the sum of thy tidings? Would the outlaw,
or the ocean on which men say his tower is
placed, had her in their wildest grasp first!"&mdash;"She
hath been delivered from thrall," said
Thibaud, "by the skill and prowess of a
single knight; and for her ransom men say
her deliverer made the outlaw pay it with his
blood."&mdash;"Good, good," said the Lord of Courtenaye;
"she is delivered without ransom, and
my coffers shall not be ransacked for the redeeming
of a paltry girl. Marry, the gems on
her girdle were ransom but too precious for
her whole worthless sex! But thou didst
speak of a deliverer&mdash;who may that be? who,
who?" and his voice rose to a pitch of screaming
agony: "say Paladour de la Croix Sanglante,

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

and take thy leave of life!"&mdash;"Such
tidings are told," said Thibaud. "Name but
the name of her deliverer," said the Lord of
Courtenaye writhing.&mdash;"Thou hast named him
already," said Thibaud; "it is Sir Paladour
de la Croix Sanglante."&mdash;With a spring like
that of a mountain cat the Lord of Courtenaye
darted at the throat of his vassal. The strong-limbed
vassal held him at arms' length, and
shook him till he quailed. "No force or fury,
lord," he said: "the fiend may rise within me
too, and his workings be fiercer in this arm
than in thine!"&mdash;"My gentle Thibaud," said
the cowering lord, "I know thou hast uttered
all this in sport.&mdash;Thou dost but mock thy
master&mdash;say so, I pray thee&mdash;say in one word
thou hast deceived me, and I will not harm
thee." And his soft unnatural voice, his supplicatory
whine, and his ashy visage made fearful
contrast with the fierce and vivid malignity
of his eyes as they flashed on Thibaud. "Thou,
thou harm me!" said Thibaud, relaxing his
hold and bursting into incontrollable laughter:&mdash;"by
heaven, lord, I deceive thee not.
A missive of the Bishop of Toulouse bore

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

hasty tidings this day:&mdash;the sum was, the
lady Isabelle hath been disenthralled by that
Sir Paladour. They purpose for the castle of
Courtenaye; there be also Sir Ezzelin de
Verac and the Sieur de Semonville, and they
attend that noble lady with a gallant company
of men-at-arms."&mdash;"Curses, curses!"
said the frantic lord, tossing his released arms
above his head&mdash;"curses on them as they go,
and when they come! Go thou," he cried,
"fling me that hoary-headed liar&mdash;that traducer
of the stars&mdash;that blasphemer of the
bright lights of heaven, before their very eyes
into the deepest moat of the castle, and burn
me that foul witch!"&mdash;"If thou darest!" said
a tremendous voice; and the form of the maniac stood before him, heaving up a stone of
the paved floor, like a spectre rising from the
grave.&mdash;"I will do thy hests, lord," said Thibaud,
"willingly;" and by sundry expressive
gestures he intimated in a manner at once
frolic and ferocious his good disposition to
that feat.</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye waved him off
with a mixture of impatience and fear, as the

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

mysterious being slowly and again repeated,
"If thou darest! Thou hast the power and
evil will, and thy brute instrument lacks no
spur to second both; but so doing thou wilt rob
thyself of a dear pleasure. Thy chiefest delight
is to do evil, thy next to hear evil foretold,
and of that my death would bereave
thee&mdash;slay me now, if thou darest!"&mdash;"False
hag!" cried the Lord of Courtenaye; "what
canst thou predict that may bring comfort to
me? Is not my niece delivered from thraldom
by the very arm that I would were withered
muscle and marrow? Is he not journeying to
my castle with his prize in his proud arms?
and will not his valiant deed (oh, that his arm
were forceless and feeble as this!) and will
not his goodly favour win her to listen to
that nameless suitor?"&mdash;"If thou doubtest of
my predictments," said the female, "take this
at least for truth. Surely as I guided the
knight Sir Paladour to thy castle, surely as I
led him to the hold where the lady was
thrall, surely," she said with dreadful energy
of voice and action, "as I struck his foeman
to and through the heart; so surely does

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

the lady Isabelle love him who will be
her bridegroom, and her murderer. Throw
ope thy castle gates, welcome him nobly,
couch him on silk and down, affy him
to thy cousin, stand smiling at the altar
as she weds him, and then&mdash;then&mdash;Lord
of Courtenaye, the meanest vassal of those
wide domains over which thou rulest by
tyranny and torture, would not exchange
his place that night with the bridegroom of
the lady Isabelle. He shall be miserable to
the full extent of his predicted doom; more,&mdash;to
the extent of thy most malignant wish.
Thou thyself shalt,&mdash;no," she added with a
bitter laugh, "I had forgot&mdash;thou canst not
pity, else had I said, thou wouldst pity that
Sir Paladour."</p>

<p>It was singular, that the confidence of
the unhappy man, who was at once her
prey and her sport, seemed to increase in
proportion to her denunciations of evil. With
ears that thirsted, and eyes that listened, he
caught her last words, denouncing the terrible
doom of Paladour, and he instantly
waved Thibaud from the chamber.&mdash;"I am

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

best pleased being absent," said Thibaud:
"the sight of that being makes my pores to
open, and mine hairs to bristle." He dropped
the curtain of the arched door as he spoke, and
disappeared; then, raising it for a moment,
"Shouldst thou again change thy humour of
hearkening to the foul witch, for one of burning
her, I will attend thy lightest summons, lord."</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye and the maniac
were left alone. "Woman, or what
may I call thee?" said the wretched man,
"I am driven to extremity; present perils
and future shadowed and visionary horrors,
are in my day-thoughts and my night-dreams.
By crime my brother won wealth
and power; by crime I hold it. I urged
him to the slaughter of Count Raymond's
family; but who urged the secret death of
that brother, thou knowest not&mdash;nor is there
living witness. And for my cousin the
lady Isabelle, her nurse was over-faithful,
else she had never caused this trouble. I
should have been undisputed Lord of Courtenaye
and Beaurevoir; and such I may yet
be, if thou wilt lend that aid thou hast so oft

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

promised me."&mdash;The maniac bowed her head.
"Give me, then," he said, "to see him&mdash;that
mighty one&mdash;that evil one, at whose
disposal, that ancient and forbidden book
saith, are all the kingdoms of the world and
their glory! Let me but see him, and make
mine own dark terms with him: promise me
but this."&mdash;"Yet pause," she said; "pause
on thy terrible demand! Wilt thou, indeed,
abide by it? None guilty as thou art need
lack the aid of wizardry to call up that spirit
that is ever stirring uncalled within him.
Yet, if it be thy will&mdash;&mdash;" she said.&mdash;"My
will!" repeated the Lord of Courtenaye: "I
tell thee, it is the unquenchable thirst of my
spirit. The spirit that works within me needs
a mightier one to strive with for mastery or
subjection. Let me behold, if thou hast such
power, my vassal or my chief. I spurn at
the implements with which I toil. I would
behold at once the entrance to that lower
world and its dark and potent ruler, such as
thou hast painted him! Be there not miners,
who, while their fellow-labourers wore out
their dismal existence in fruitless labour and

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

lightless gloom, by one well-fortuned stroke
sprung a vein and discovered the hidden and
fructifying ore? Be there not others of
whom men have told, that, amid the hopeless
toils of their living tomb, they were encountered
by the mighty watcher of that dark
and hidden wealth, and suddenly enriched
beyond the dream of those at whose hest
they wrought?"</p>

<p>While he spoke, his companion listened
for the first time with deep attention.&mdash;"Go
on," she said: "disclose to me the
darkest abysses of mind depraved, an ulcerated
heart, and a damning conscience.
I have dived deeper than thou canst; for
stronger intellect is but a dreadful pledge for
more deep and daring progress into regions
of evil unexplored. Go on speak thy wish,
and it shall be fulfilled; name the work, and
it shall be wrought!"</p>

<p>The wretched man named his fearful purpose
in language too horrible to be repeated.
His companion listened with unshrinking
form and unaltered visage&mdash;not a muscle in
her whole frame or face was contracted or

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

relaxed. When he ceased at length, her lips
severed; her eyes were intensely fixed on
him her form inclined forward, her right
arm raised; and she stood so, that the deaf
would have thought she was speaking intently,
though for that space she uttered not
a word. At length, in a voice deep and
distinct&mdash;"Have thy wish!" she said. "By
that Power thou believest in, if thou believest
in aught, on the lady's bridal night
thou shalt meet with thy master and mine!"
and as she spoke, she passed from the
chamber.</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye looked after her
a moment. "Thou art an agent for mighty
mischiefs!" said he; "but I were to blame if
I wrought by thee alone. Madness and intellectual
might are contending in thee; but
every engine, mean or mighty, must be strained
for this work. Spells may be counteracted and
reversed, but when failed the strong hand
and ruthless heart? If I cannot move heaven
and earth, I will at least move earth and
hell to aid me. Ho! Thibaud," he cried:
and the attendant entered.&mdash;"Is the fiend

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

vanished," said he, in that tone at once familiar
and fierce, in which he was wont to address
his wretched lord.&mdash;"No sooner does
one vanish, than a worse appears," muttered the other. Then with a rapid change of
look and voice:&mdash;"My gentle Thibaud," he
said, "I think thou lovest me!"&mdash;"Faith, lord,
I love me thee not!" said Thibaud, indolently
applying his finger to his dropping lip.&mdash;"I
care not how many know my mind. I ever
loved peril for its own sake, and the more for
its sworn brother, gold; and thou art so
wealthy and wicked, that I knew I never
should lack either in thy employ: otherwise
I love thee no more than a man may love
one who hath employed him at idle hours to
cut others' throats with firm purpose that his
own should be cut in mere consequence!"&mdash;"Thou
art pleasant, Thibaud," said his lord,
forcing a faint laugh.&mdash;"By my soul, lord,"
said Thibaud, "though that is but poor pledge
either, I am sadly serious. But what is
this demon-deed thou art working me to, for
I read thy drift in thy averted eyes, and
pale lip, better than I could ever learn from

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

thy words?"&mdash;"Arrest <i>him</i> on his path!"
said the Lord of Courtenaye, starting from his
seat, and whispering with quivering lips in
the bent ear of his vassal though none listened,
holding him by the collar of his doublet
fast. "Send swift arrow or keen dagger
through him ere he arrive; it will be light
task to what thou hast wrought for <i>me!</i>
What, my bold Thibaud, doth thy mettle fail?"&mdash;"And
on whom is this gentle feat to be done,
Lord of Courtenaye?" said Thibaud with the
calm look of a habitual villain.&mdash;"Ask'st
thou on whom?" said his lord, quitting his
hold, and stamping on the floor till the
chamber rang again: "On <i>him</i>, thou mocking
knave!&mdash;on him, the very echoes of my
castle repeat his name, though <i>I</i> cannot,"
he added, in a choked voice, and unloosing
his collar. "It is Sir Paladour," he yelled
forth, and flung himself on a bench: then
rising, "Here be fifty bezants in this purse,"
he cried, drawing it from his girdle: "I will
double, I will treble, I will quadruple," he
continued, watching the increasing shades of
reluctance in the strong lines of Thibaud's

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

visage. "Name thy terms!" he exclaimed,
dashing his purse on the ground and facing
his vassal front to front, his agitated and
feeble frame making strong contrast to that
of the sinewy and motionless ruffian who stood
calmly before him.&mdash;"On twice and twenty
times thine offer," said Thibaud, "would I
trample as I do on this;" and he planted his
foot on the purse. "What! murder him who
hath saved the honour of thine house&mdash;who
hath won at risk of life the liberty of the
lady Isabelle&mdash;who held the cause of the
Crusaders light weighed against the peril of
a noble lady! But why speak I to thee?
they who are villains by nature not by necessity,
know not that there be degrees in villainy?
Thou didst reach the goal at a
stride, and therefore knowest not how much
I yet lack to overtake thee."&mdash;"Art thou
most surely assured," said the lord (who
ceased to tempt and dared not threaten) with
a musing air, "that in the slaughter of that
family, <i>all</i> did perish? might not one have
escaped, and may not that one be he?"&mdash;"My
lord, your brother," said Thibaud, "was

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

not wont to do his work by halves. Of that
doomed household not a soul was spared,
from the confessor telling his beads to the page
that held the stirrup! chief and vassal, woman
and nursling, all, all perished!&mdash;Hark!"
he cried, "are their spirits come to confirm
my tale?" as a horn was loudly rung, and
the creaking of the chains of the drawbridge
was followed by the numerous trampling of
men and steeds. "By heaven! lord," said
Thibaud, who had rushed out and suddenly
returned, "there is no time for plots and
practice: Sir Paladour and the lady are in
the court of the castle."&mdash;"Curses! curses!"
cried the desperate wretch in utter despair:
"Oh that they were weltering in its moat!
oh that its towers would fall and crush them!
oh for a curse that would poison the air they
draw, and blast them as they enter!"&mdash;"Now,"
said Thibaud internally, "may the Devil
lash himself with his own tail, for very spite
to see himself outdone in fraud and fiendish
simulation. Hark to the welcome he gives
them."&mdash;"Welcome! welcome! fair niece,
and thrice welcome, thou valiant knight her

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

deliverer," he exclaimed as the lady Isabelle,
her beautiful cheek somewhat paler
from her late peril and fatigue, knelt to receive
the benison of her false kinsman: and
Sir Paladour and the knights her escorts, with
a gallant train of attendants, thronged the
hall into which he had rushed to receive her.</p>

<br/>

<p>WE must now pursue the course of the
Bishop of Toulouse, who some space before
this event had set forth with his prisoners
towards his episcopal palace or castle in the
neighbourhood of Beaucaire, and felt the captives
he bore with him as "arrows in the hand
of the giant."</p>

<p>His palace at Toulouse he had long deserted
as situate in a city which was then the
head-quarters of the Albigenses, and fortified
his episcopal residence at Beaucaire till it
rather resembled the stronghold of a marauding
baron than the abode of a peaceful ecclesiastic.
Genevieve, who knew as little of her
conductors as of her destination, felt however

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

some faint hope, some shadow of consolation,
from the presence of the deacon her fellow
prisoner. This consolation, however, she was
not fated to enjoy. The deacon, dejected and
abashed at her presence, declined intercourse
with her, but his spirits rekindling at some
taunts from the bishop's train, he rejoined
with such acrimonious energy and fluent
virulence, that they were fain to menace the
gag, to insure his silence during the remainder
of the journey.</p>

<p>"Thou tellest strange news," said the bishop
to his cross-bearer, "if the noblest and
wealthiest heiress in France be to wed a
birthless landless knight.&mdash;And what is this
thou tellest of the overthrow of Adolfo, the
bold outlaw?"&mdash;"Marry, it is merely truth,"
said the cross-bearer; "and men say that the
Abbot of Normoutier and his, are fain to keep
Lent at Michaelmas for the same." The bishop
mused "What!" he continued, starting
from his reverie in a mood of trivial jealousy,
"and that withered ascetic the Monk of
Montcalm to wed them! I ever held that

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

lady Isabelle a peevish religionist, and a
fautor of those heretics."</p>

<p>"How far to Beaucaire?" he cried, exalting
his voice. The cross-bearer named the
number of leagues. "But is there no shorter
way?" said the prelate impatiently.&mdash;"There
is," said the attendant; "but it is unsafe,
by reason of the troops of wolves, whom the
timeless sharpness of this keen and early
autumn hath driven from the mountains, and
who, finding on the wasted lands of the
Albigeois no prey, have descended to the
forests, and seize on many men."&mdash;"Tush,
fool!" said the bishop, "are we not armed,
and enough to meet them were every fallen
leaf on the wood-path to be changed into a
wolf?&mdash;set on without delay!"</p>

<p>The cross-bearer, knowing expostulation
vain, announced the bishop's purpose to his
train, who prepared to follow. It was in
the short twilight of an autumnal evening
when they entered the vast forest that then
neighboured the city of Beaucaire. The autumn
had from its commencement been
unusually severe; the mountains were already

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

covered with snow; and even in that milder
region a keen frost crisped the wood-path,
that, thickly strewn with leaves, wound beneath
the bare branches of the forest-trees.
There was a moon; but that only made the
nakedness of the dismantled trees more
visible and dreary. As they entered on
their way, there was heard a fearful and
distant sound. "Heardest thou that?" said
the cross-bearer, emboldened by his fears;
"it is the howl of wolves."&mdash;"It is the
echoed tramp of our horses' feet," said the
bishop, as he rode headmost of his company.
Genevieve, who rode behind a man-at-arms,
felt her peril, and offered up a
silent prayer.</p>

<p>They had scarce entered the wood, when
the mingled roar and yell of some savage
conflict reached their ears; and soon they
saw a bear fastened on by many wolves,
who, spite of his resistance, dragged him off,
and by their howl testified their triumph
over their victim. The cry of a human voice
was heard the next moment, and a saddled
horse without a rider was seen at some distance

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

flying like the wind, with some thirty
wolves in pursuit, two of them growing to
his haunches.</p>

<p>"Speed on," said the bishop to his
train, "there is a glade between these forest-trees
where the moon-light falls full
and fair; light always scares these savage
animals, and we shall speed safely." The
party pressed on towards the glade, which
was shadowed deeply by the trees, and by
grassy knolls that rose behind them; but,
as they advanced, they saw a vast troop of
wolves descending from the hills, and apparently
delaying their attack, and waiting for
a reinforcement from others.</p>

<p>They formed themselves in a regular body,
and, without rushing forward, kept their
ground, uttering hideous howlings, such as
that the best riders in the Bishop of Toulouse's
train could scarce rein their steeds, who were
maddened with fear at those horrid sounds.
"We must even turn back," said the cross-bearer,
who had climbed a tree, "there be
thousands of those fierce savages rushing on us.
It is like a sea in a storm, where every wave

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

is alive and howling to engulf us&mdash;so they
come, and their numbers increase as I look
on them; and I dare look no longer," he cried,
dropping his hold of the tree&mdash;"God send us
safe from this fearful peril!"&mdash;"If we <i>must</i>
turn back," said the bishop, who always heard
such a proposal with reluctance&mdash;&mdash;"Turn
back and ye are lost!" cried a voice that
seemed to issue from the air: "another band
of wolves is gathering in the rear. Help me
down from this tree, with the lady to whom
I have been a fruitless guide; and I will, perchance,
show that which may profit you."</p>

<p>The bishop's train looking up perceived
that the voice issued from one seated amid
the branches of a tree with a female, masked
and covered with the coarse mantle and
hood of a peasant. They assisted him to descend,
with the female, who showed much reluctance
to avail herself of their aid. "Sir
traveller," said the man (who proved himself
a mountaineer by his accent) bowing to the
bishop, "I have often crossed these wild
wood-paths before&mdash;yea and the wildest
mountains of Languedoc, but never did I

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

know such deep and deadly peril from those
fierce beasts as threatens us now. My comrade
hath already perished: my horse and
the lady's mule are tied for safety to yon elm;
and we climbed the tree for shelter."&mdash;"How
may we best meet them?" said the bishop
calmly. "Light the fire that some travellers
have left the embers of, strewed round that
broad oak," said the mountaineer; "fire will
scare them, and their fear will win you time."
At the word the fire was struck, the dry leaves
and broken branches heaped on it, and in two
minutes a fierce and flaring moat of fire
blazed round the party. "Dismount," said
the bishop; "place the women and horses in
the centre, while we meet them with lance
and arrow."&mdash;"By your favour, sir traveller,"
said the peasant, well skilled to wage
such warfare, "that were weak policy: they
hunger more for horse-flesh than for man;
send two or three of your steeds adrift, and
mark if you be not the safer."</p>

<p>The bishop gave the sign, and some of the
men-at-arms dismounted, and attempted to
urge their horses over that barrier of flame,

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

opposed to which stood their fierce and yelling
enemies. The wretched animals, conscious
of their danger, crouched on their
very haunches, and, with bursting nostril,
reverted eye, pointed ear, and agonized neighings,
testified their horror. By the bishop's
command lance and dagger-point were applied; and at length the tortured animals
dashed through the flames, and fled like
wind into the forest. The event verified the
mountaineer's prediction: a vast body of
wolves pursued them; their cries were soon
heard, mixed with the howls of those who
mangled and devoured them almost in their
riders' sight. But still the main body pressed
on, and even dashed through the fire, howling
as they felt it, less from pain, than from ferocity.
The bishop's train always received the
front rank on their lances, while the archers,
standing above, rained down an incessant
shower of arrows on the rear. It was in vain&mdash;for
fifty that fell, hundreds followed;
those hundreds seemed to be succeeded by
thousands. The yell and the spring, the impulse,
and the fierceness, and the number

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

seemed exhaustless, and the howl of the
dying seemed only a signal to call on the
living; till the bishop, alighting from his
steed in fury, dashed the burning branches
among them as they rushed on, and then
trampling on the flames that scorched him
through his armour, hewed down to right and
left with his battle-axe the maimed and howling
fugitives. At this moment the spectacle
was horrible: the dark and bloody forms of the
animals, bounding through the flames&mdash;the
yells of the dying and wounded, who in their
agonies bit fiercely at each other&mdash;the flashes
of the fire, the gleaming of the lances, and the
cries of the fierce savages that kept the ear in
hell, were almost maddening. The bishop
with his train rode on over dying and dead,
hewing and stabbing, and flinging burning
brands among the advancing troop, till the
mangled dead lay beneath their horses' feet;
and the survivors slunk howling to the
mountains.</p>

<p>The trembling women in the meanwhile
had clung close to the shelter of the tree,
round which the fire was kindled, but not

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

even the extreme of terror had extorted a
word or sound from that masked lady.&mdash;"Fellow,"
said the bishop, as he rode back,
"thou hast done us service, and we will
requite thee; thou shalt ride in our train to
Beaucaire, if such be the intendment of thy
journey." The man was profuse in his expressions
of gratitude, which, delivered in
the mountain <i>patois</i>, were peculiarly offensive
to the ears of the bishop.&mdash;"Good
fellow, forbear," he said, "would that thy
silent companion were as fluent as thou,
and better intelligible: she hath not thanked
us yet."&mdash;"Noble sir," said the mountaineer,
proud of a prolonged conference with one
whose bearing and train attested his rank,&mdash;"Noble
sir, it is her wont: for four days
that we have been her guides, she never
uttered a word but to urge us to speed.
It was but this evening she willed us to
cross the forest at all peril, wherein my
comrade lost life; and when we ascended
the tree for safety, it was all against her
will, for ever her word was&mdash;Speed on,
speed on. But though she paved our way

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

with gold every league&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"What sayest
thou?" said the bishop hastily.&mdash;"Even
mere truth, noble sir," said the mountaineer.
"I am a made man for life by her guerdon."&mdash;"She
is not of thy state then, fellow?" said the bishop.&mdash;"Alas! no, my
lord," said the guide; "her small hands,
and delicate voice, would soon tell that
secret; besides, there were armed knights,
and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"She bears the coarse mantle
of a peasant," said the bishop.&mdash;"She hath
costly garments beneath them," answered
the mountaineer.</p>

<p>The bishop lost not a moment in approaching
the lady, and intimating in courteous
language the pleasure he had felt in
rescuing her from her recent danger, and
the hope of hearing himself rewarded by
the expression of her satisfaction. Thus
urged, the lady, without removing her mask,
uttered her thanks as briefly as she might;
and, as it struck Genevieve, who stood close
beside her for protection, not only in a foreign
but feigned accent. "We will give
you the further protection of our company,

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

if ye intend for Beaucaire," said the bishop.&mdash;"Oh
no, no,&mdash;we do not," said the lady,
speaking in her alarm at this proposal in
her natural voice. The bishop paused a
moment, and then bending his eye on her,
"Madame," said he, in a voice in which ceremonious
respect was blended with fixed resolution,
"please you to unmask."&mdash;The lady's
agitation increased; she did not comply with
his demand, but, pressing her hand on her
bosom for a few moments in agonized silence,
she sunk on the earth in a swoon. Her
mask was removed for air, and Genevieve
then caught a glimpse of a face evidently
past the bloom of youth, but still exquisitely
fair; her small and delicate features attested
her rank, of which, in those days,
such a distinction was deemed decisive, but
her snowy skin and flaxen hair, proved her
no daughter of swarthy Gaul; and though
eyes were closed, one would have sworn,
from the veins in the lids, that the orbs beneath
were the brightest blue. The bishop
gazed intently on her face with stern and
triumphant pleasure. "Why this is chance's

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

masterpiece," he exclaimed. "Tend her
with gentleness, and when she is refreshed,
place her on mine own palfrey, and set on
to Beaucaire." The unfortunate lady, as
she recovered, heard his last words, and
seemed about to essay to move him; then
relinquishing the effort with a groan of
despair, she reclined her head on the shoulder
of Genevieve. In the tumult of remounting
their horses which followed, a
moment occurred in which the two females
were left unobserved and alone; and this
moment the lady seized to place a costly
jewel in the hand of Genevieve, which she
pressed with significant earnestness. Genevieve, who understood this action as a
pledge of confidence, or perchance a means
of liberation, returned the pressure; but the
next moment they were lifted on their horses
by the bishop's followers, and pursuing their
route without further peril or adventure,
reached Beaucaire by the dawn.</p>

<p>GENEVIEVE, though born in a city, had
been from her infancy a mountain girl, one
living amid the freedom and felicity of
nature, save when barred from both by the
tyranny of man. She had but a very faint
and shadowy recollection of the horrors of
the subterranean retreat from Carcassonne,
by which her infant life had been preserved.
But the image of a city thus mingled with
her earliest associations, had left nothing
but impressions of darkness, constraint and
terror; these impressions were, perhaps,
rather strengthened than effaced, when she

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

first beheld the pomp and wretchedness of an
ancient feudal city. It was surrounded by
walls, and had strong gates flanked by towers,
on the battlements of which stood warders
who wound their horns to alarm the town
till they discovered the advanced standard of
the bishop of Toulouse, and then they descended
to open the gates, whose creak and
jar sounded like the entrance into a prison.
The bishop pressed onward, and his train
followed. He had previously advertised
them to mention that two female heretics had
been seized on, and were to be conveyed to
his residence for examination, to shun the
indecorum which then attached to females
being seen in the company of a noble ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>As they entered the city, its singular features
developed themselves. There was nothing
like a regular street, and the first
houses that appeared, were removed at a great
distance from the walls, evidently to avoid the
consequences of a siege which must first fall
on <i>them</i>. The unoccupied space between these
houses and the wall, was filled with lepers

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

and lazars, writhing in all the contortions of
diversified misery, and festering in the rising
light of the sun, which gleamed so gloriously
on the array of the bishop, who gave his benison
as he passed, while his purse-bearer scattered
handfuls of coin among them, for which
the maimed and loathsome wretches fought
fiercely in his sight. Farther on there was
some appearance of a city: several houses
were built close to each other, but with such
marked contempt of all rules of civic architecture,
that the gable ends of most faced the
street, making uncouth angles with the fronts
of others which were turned towards it; their
abutments jutting out far into the road (for it
could scarcely be called a street;) their windows
sometimes projecting forth in a balcony
form, sometimes contracted to a single pane
stuck in a most unnoticed corner; their high
and sloping roofs here and there defended by
a bartizan; their chimneys rising in clustered
shafts like the pillars of a cathedral, and, like
them, girdled in at various stages or stories with
uncouth ornaments sculptured in stone, and
sometimes with inscriptions from holy writ;

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

a battlement of stone cresting every roof,
and loopholes in the lower apartments in
place of windows: all these testified the
strength and the peril of a feudal city.</p>

<p>These clusters of houses were built close to
a church; perhaps for the convenience of
worship, or from a belief in the supposed
sanctity of the vicinage, or, more probably, to
fly to for shelter in the event of a siege. As
the bishop and his captives passed on, they
perceived the monks at the doors of their convents
distributing food to the mendicants,
and artists and tradesmen preparing for the
business of the day, their shops projecting far
into the street, being furnished with an awning
for the protection of the goods which were
exposed as in a booth. Over these were suspended
some painting corresponding to the
signs formerly used by tradesmen, but they
contained nothing emblematic of their trade;&mdash;they
were the portraits of their patron
saints.</p>

<p>The usual passengers of the streets of a
feudal city now began to appear; a fair

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

mincing dame going to matins, a leper soliciting
her charity&mdash;a pardoner whose loud
vaunts of his godly gear were insufficient to
draw the attention of passengers from the
display of rich and curious wares exhibited
by an itinerant pedlar from Italy&mdash;a poor
widow going on pilgrimage to the shrine of
St. Benedict in the abbey of Normoutier, for
the recovery of an only son, accompanied by
two others, whom a wealthy citizen, who had
committed murder, had hired to perform this
penance for him. A troubadour and his mistress,
seated in a latticed balcony, were singing
the praises of the nightingale, so often mentioned
in the songs of the Proven&ccedil;al bards; and
a little farther, on the closely-barred door of a
gloomy house was traced the terrific inscription,
<i>Domine miserere nos</i>, indicating it had
been the abode of plague. As they reached
an irregular enclosure near the centre of the
city (its <i>place publique</i>) the groups became
more numerous, diversified and characteristic.</p>

<p>A number of young men, armed and mounted,
were practising the martial exercise of
throwing the javelin; on a raised platform

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

a group of priests were exorcising with various
ceremonies a woman who pretended to be
possessed, but who, though apparently convulsed
at the display of the <i>St. Suaire</i>, or holy
handkerchief, chatted and laughed at the intervals
of the exorcism with some jolly young
palmers who stood by. A band of monks,
with tapers in their hands, which burned
dimly in the increasing light of day, were conveying
the host to the death-chamber of a
wealthy citizen; and hard by, some mendicants
were raising the dead body of one of their
companions from the dunghill where he had
perished from want.</p>

<p>One feature in the aspect of the city was
strikingly characteristic of the age: there
were no public buildings but churches; no
courts, no edifices for the discharge of business
or the distribution of justice: at that
period the halls of barons in the country, and
the aisles of churches in the city, were the
only scenes of either. It was also observable,
that every house was in a state of defence,
according to the means of the inhabitant;&mdash;those
of the lower classes scarce having a

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

window, and the door never facing the street;
those of the middling orders having loopholes,
as has been mentioned, in place of windows in
the lower stories, while the upper were
ascendible only by a stair on the outside,
which, like a drawbridge, could be raised at
pleasure; while the dwellings occupied by
the wealthier citizens were crested with battlement
and bartizan like a baron's castle.</p>

<p>Such was then the structure of a feudal
city, possessing a fortified castle for its defence,
and churches to fly to in the last resort
for shelter or for sanctuary, but which often
proved ineffectual for either. Yet this wild
and barbaric picture of life had something of
interest and of picturesque in it that the uniformity
of civilized life possesses not:&mdash;a mendicant
in rags is a better subject for a painter
than a modern court lady in plumes and
train; and such relative comparison may a
feudal city bear to a modern one with its
parallel rows of houses and rectangular
squares; its perfect safety, comfort, regularity,
and insipidity.</p>

<p>Genevieve as she rode through the streets,

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

felt the contrast between her former existence
and her present destination swell her heart
almost to suffocation. She had never before
been conscious of beholding a city.</p>

<p>"And this is the habitation of men?" she
said internally; "close and choked, feverish
and dungeon-like; whose houses bear
on every side the mark or resistance of outrage.
Alas! can beings so crushed and
crowded together, so tortured by the indulgence
or the infliction of evil passions, and so
surrounded by the works of their own hands,
that no thought but that of human power can
touch their minds, be meet worshippers of
him who dwelleth not in temples made with
hands? Oh," she thought, "for the aerial
magnificence of the mountain! Oh, for the
rush of a hundred streams murmuring in deep
and stilly burthen to the voice of the congregation!
Oh, for that canopy of heaven, pure,
blue and glittering with thousand stars, that
beheld, and in beholding seemed to smile on
us! Alas, to this what is all human art&mdash;all
human grandeur! Men rear piles of stone,
but the eternal mountains, the fabrics of deity,

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

laugh them to scorn. They paint their roofs,
and hang them with lights; but when did
they emulate the blue of the firmament, illumined
by small twinkling stars, or the darkness
of the storm, broken by the arrowy
flash of the lightning? And men may utter
measured sounds taught by art in their narrow
walls, and toss censers of fragrance under
painted roofs; but is the sound so solemn as
when the choral song of my people arises at
midnight on the mountain, and is echoed from
the valley, till cliff and crag are vocal with
the harmonies of heaven, and plant and
flower vibrate to their echo, and the incense
of devoted hearts ascendeth richly as the
evening sacrifice? Oh, might I dwell for
ever in the gigantic palaces of creation, shadowed
as I sleep by the forest, and lulled by
the torrent, the primeval mountains for the
walls of my dwelling, and the broad clear
heaven for its roof, while every thing around
me told not of man but God, and self was
annihilated as I contemplated the deity in
the immensity of his works!</p>

<p>"And this is a city!" she said, as the

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

bishop's train arrived at the palace-gate. The
draw-bridge was lowered, the prisoners entered
the court-yard, and beheld a castle
equalling in strength and magnificence any of
the royal residences of King Philip; but as
they traversed the court there was also to be
seen the <i>carcan</i>, or signorial standard, an iron
pillar with its full furniture of chains and collars;
and this emblem of despotism and
cruelty, contrasted with the taste and splendour
of the entrance, bore no unapt similitude
to the character of their possessor. His attendants
now gathered round him to learn
how they should dispose of the prisoners.&mdash;"For
the masked lady," said the bishop, in a
strong distinct voice, that seemed meant to
reach the lady's ear, "Let her be treated with
all nobleness, suited to her rank: for the heretic
maiden, let her be lodged meetly, and
look that she want no tendance; but whence
is that tumult among my train?"&mdash;"My
holy lord," said one of them, dragging forward
the unfortunate deacon, "is it your
pleasure that we hang him presently from
the carcan, or plunge him into the moat of

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

your castle?"&mdash;"At your peril, knaves!" said
the prelate. "Unbind him on the instant.
The deacon Mephibosheth shall this day dine
with the bishop of Toulouse."&mdash;"I loath all
dainty meats," said the deacon. "I will put
a knife to my throat ere I taste of them.
Thy precious balms shall not break mine
head."&mdash;"Put a gag in his mouth," quoth the
bishop; "he will speak sense anon, when
the bell rings the dinner-hour."</p>

<p>The prisoners were then borne to their different
apartments in that spacious mansion;
the lady, removing her mask, having thrown
one glance of agonizing supplication on Genevieve,
which was as expressively returned
before they were separated.</p>

<p>The bishop no sooner entered his castle,
than, insensible to the fatigue of his journey,
he began dictating letters to the pope, and
the kings of Arragon and France, over the
latter of whom he knew he had in his last
prisoner a hold irresistible. There were
also letters from these potentates, which had
arrived in his absence, the contents of which
were more favourable to his views than formerly.

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

The pope seemed to incline to his
appointment as head of the crusaders; but so
guarded and doubtful was his tone, that the
letter was capable of any construction. The
king of Arragon was more explicit: he expressly
assented to the bishop's requirements,
and declared that the Albigeois should neither
find shelter nor passage through his dominions.
There was one letter, the contents of which
contracted his brows as he read it;&mdash;it was
from Simon de Montfort, announcing his improving
health, and his purpose of leading the
crusaders against the heretics in the following
spring. In reading and replying to these letters,
and writing others to all whom he could
command or persuade to collect their forces,
and assail Count Raymond of Toulouse, while
still encumbered with the helpless train of the
wives and children of the Albigenses, the
bishop was instantly occupied, and so intently,
that the priest, who attended to say
mass as usual on the prelate's arrival, after
standing in his robes unnoticed for eight
hours, fell on the ground from fatigue, and
then first recalled to the bishop's occupied

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

mind the idea that any one was present but
himself.</p>

<p>Three days elapsed, during which Genevieve
passed a life of unmolested loneliness.
A female attendant brought her food, accompanied
her when she walked in the gardens
of the castle, and treated her not only with
decorum, but with deference; but to any
thing like an attempt to conciliate her confidence,
or solicit her aid, she opposed an impenetrable
silence. It was on the evening of
the third day, as Genevieve was preparing to
retire to rest, this woman appeared with a
sumptuous habit in her hand, which she required
her to put on, and follow her to the
presence of the bishop.</p>

<p>Genevieve, who felt that resistance was
vain, complied, till she perceived that the
magnificent dress she was to wear exposed
more of her person than was ever visible before,
and then, though knowing herself in the
power of her attendant, made with her eyes
a silent appeal to her.&mdash;"Fold thy veil, or
clasp thy white arms over it," said the
shameless female "the bishop, it is said,

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

prizeth most <i>veiled</i> beauty; but whether it be
that of nuns or of heretics, thou shalt shortly
know." She then was led through many a
spacious passage and gallery, till the conductress,
raising a curtain, pointed to her to
enter, and retired. However from habit
an admirer of the sole magnificence of nature,
Genevieve was for once compelled to
an involuntary admission of the magnificence
of art, as she passed into that gorgeous chamber.</p>

<p>The bishop, who had been a crusader
in the East as well as in the West, had
brought from the oriental world all the taste
for splendour and magnificence that then,
even more than now, characterised the style
of their buildings and their furniture; and
this apartment, the usual scene of his licentious
pleasures, was a model of eastern luxury,
painted faithfully from an imagination
as retentive of gorgeous imagery as it was
awake to every glowing incentive to indulgence.
The chamber, of noble dimensions
and perfectly rectangular, was hung quite
round with the richest crimson silk, its borders

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

wrought in gold and coloured silk, with
amatory passages from the poetry of the
Troubadours, in Arabic characters, so that
the costume of the drapery was strictly preserved,
and <i>Alla il Alla</i> wrought in gold at
every corner served to connect the cyphers
of the other inscriptions. Never on the
gilded and gemmed walls of that voluptuous
Alhambra did passion, poetry, and devotion,
mingle in such mystified union. Nor was
the border bedecked with less costly and
curious flourishings, than in that singular
temple of amorous devotion. Just where
those rich hangings reached within three feet
of the floor, the piles of embroidered cushions,
heaped round the chamber, met them at that
height, and being of the same rich material
and broidery, seemed like a continuation of
them&mdash;a silken couch spread under a silken
canopy;&mdash;and all round that room of luxury
were vases of pastilles and perfumes burning
faintly, but sending forth an odorous and inebriating
scent, well calculated for its luxurious
atmosphere; and between were vases
of materials unknown in Europe, filled with

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

the rich flowers of the East&mdash;the tulip, the
Persian ranunculus, and many other glowing
daughters of oriental gardens, that blushed
and burned for the first time in European
air. The floor was strewed six inches high
with costly carpeting, part of the warlike
prelate's eastern spoil. In the centre of the
floor was placed a table occupied by a curiously-wrought
silver frame of filigree, and
surrounded by seats so constructed as to harmonize
with the oriental costume of the
apartment, and yet preserve the accommodation
required at the meeting of European
guests. A fretted lamp of silver swung over
the luxurious table, diffusing light and odour
at every vibration; and in each corner of
the magnificent chamber a naked negro slave,
well represented in black marble, with one
knee bowed on the golden pedestal that supported the figure, and one arm folded on the
breast, held in the other a vast waxen torch,
whose light blazed gloriously on the banquet-room.
The turban, spurs, chibouque, and
shield of polished metal, won in fierce combat

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

from a Saracenic chief by the bishop, were
displayed on the rich ottoman as appropriate
furniture, rather than a trophy of triumph;
and right opposite to these sparkling memorials,
the latticed window, tinted in its lower
panes with gorgeous colouring and distorted
figures, admitted in its upper, traversed by
many a branch of intricately wrought stone,
the full glory of moonlight. The ceiling,
flatted according to the rules of oriental
architecture, was also, according to its taste,
gorgeously painted with a representation of
Jerusalem; the bright colours, and vivid distinctness,
and animated grouping of the picture,
making strong contrast with the rich
and gloomy grandeur of the crimson drapery
below. There was Mount Gihon to the
south, with its two fountains, upper and
lower; and right opposite, Mount Calvary,
which the painter (a Jew) had veiled in
a deep shadow. The walls of the Holy
City rose high; but above them sparkled
in glorious colouring the palace of Herod,
and far above that, the mighty pile of

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

the temple on Mount Moriah, like a rock
of alabaster, its domes like globes of pure silver,
and its pinnacles glittering like the stars
in heaven. Northward of the city the brook
Kedron trembled in its course, as if it felt the
footsteps of a passing God; Siloa glowed
mildly in the moonlight, as if rejoicing in his
presence; and Mount Olivet rose dimly in
the perspective, her dark trees mingling with
the horizon; while far above, the firmament
burned with all the deep azure and living
gold of Syria's nights, and to the eye it
seemed as if even yet&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;silence still<br/>

Watched on the towers of Zion's hill.</p>

<p>Into such a chamber was Genevieve introduced;
and, appalled by its very magnificence,
she hesitated, till summoned by the commanding
voice of the bishop, to approach. She attempted
to obey him, but, ere she did so,
with instinctive feeling she drew her gaudy
and tissued veil over her bosom, and then
with hands clasped closely on it, slowly advanced.
"Approach, maiden," said the bishop,
casting a triumphant eye on the magnificence

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

around him, and motioning his
trembling companion to a seat.&mdash;"Thou seest
I am not of the mind of that warlike prelate,
he of Germany, who, when he had built a
strong castle, and was demanded of the men-at-arms
he had placed in it, how they might
subsist, answered, 'Doth it not command
four roads?' I am not wholly of such martial
mood. If we have lairs of stone and
shrouds of the bloody sod for foes, we have
also seats of down and robes of price for
beauty. Why dost thou linger, maiden?
thou seemest like one bewildered."&mdash;"I am bewildered
and dazzled," said Genevieve, slowly
seating herself on the farthest couch, and
often pressing her hands on her eyes and removing
them again as she gazed round her.</p>

<p>The bishop enjoyed her amazement;
"Look round thee, maiden," he said, "is not
this a fitter bower for beauty than the squalid
hovel, the wooden couch, and the bed of
earth? Doth not each thing on earth seek
meet and fair companionship? and were not
bowers like these formed for beauty, and
beauty formed alone for bowers like these?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

<p>The splendour&mdash;the perfumes&mdash;the gorgeous
banquet, seemed even to herself to act like
intoxication on Genevieve; she felt like one
desperate. "And dost thou think," she said,
"that the peasant maiden hath not luxuries
too? oh! that a wish could bring before mine
eyes the pure, cool, quiet light that hung
round me like a garment in the cottages of
my people!&mdash;compared with this unhallowed
glory I behold, it was like the fire kindled by
the breath of the Lord, contrasted with the
stifling and abhorred censers of Nadab and
Abihu. I have indeed slept on straw in a
hovel of clay, but, when my hymn and prayer
were done, I had nightingales to sing me
to rest, and if I awoke I saw the bright
lights of heaven through my uncurtained
casement; and the scent of flowers richer
from the heavy dew awoke me even before
the sun. Can thy palace boast such minstrels
or such harbingers of waking? here all is
palled, tasteless, and stupefying&mdash;earth, heaven,
and air, are shut out. One such night
in a peasant's hut would convert thee&mdash;if not
to his creed, at least to the conviction that a

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

peasant may have luxuries thou wottest not
of, and a peasant know rest thou canst
never enjoy."&mdash;"Never till I couch with thee,
sweet Genevieve," said the bishop, seizing
her hand. With a faint shriek she struggled
in vain to withdraw it from his iron
grasp, while he led or rather dragged
her towards a plate of polished metal which
reflected her form as perfectly as the most
pellucid mirror. Behold," he cried, gazing
on the form and semblance with wonder and
delight, "behold thyself&mdash;is that a form to
slumber in a peasant's shed, and talk of
flowers, and stars, and birds, like pining
minstrels to love-sick damsels? No; surely
as that prophetic eye of old rested on Saul,
whose stately form overtopped the host, so
surely does mine, resting on thee, presage
that thou art one who wilt cause changes
that shall be remembered on earth when
the tales of the Jewish fabulist and of that
after-faith, whose thread-worn train I seem to
uphold (to conceal my smiles beneath it), shall
be alike forgotten."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Genevieve beheld, for the first

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

time, her form reflected as from a mirror;
her pale majestic beauty, her lofty stature, her
perfect symmetry, amply and magnificently
displayed in the splendid dress she was compelled
to wear, flashed on her eyes like a fine
painting, and consciously and unconsciously
at once she felt and saw she was the most
perfect human form that earth had ever produced
or beheld: the colour in her cheek,
which was always like that in the bell of a
hyacinth, deepened into crimson as she averted
her eyes. The bishop again misconstrued
their expression&mdash;"And for what," he said,
"were such rare glories bestowed on the human
form, and wherefore do we gaze on them
with delight so intense and vivid? Nay, think
not, maiden, that it is on the transient graces
of a form finer than limner ever traced or
poet dreamed of, that I fix my prophetic
glance fairer than all the daughters of men
as thou art, thy outward frame is but the casket
of an enclosed gem which I am gifted to
behold, and destined to display to a wondering
world look once more on thyself, and ask
thee, was the spirit that kindles through that

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

transparent veil of loveliest humanity formed
to bend to the base drudgery of a cottage, to
seethe the peasant's pot, and spread rushes
for his foul and sordid lair?&mdash;'twere scorn,
yea foul sin, to think so:&mdash;it was formed to
sparkle in palaces, to control the councils of
the wise, and direct the arm of the mighty;
to rule the rulers of the earth, and bow to thy
will those at whose word their species bow
down like the reeds of the marsh to the wind
in his wintry sweep." He paused, but Genevieve,
scared and oppressed, was silent, and he
went on.&mdash;"List, maiden, and I will tell thee
of what will make thine eye flash, and thy
bosom throb in proud sympathy with mine
own.</p>

<p>"The vast system of which I am no
feeble or inert engine, hastes to the consummation
of its working&mdash;the conquest of
the world. That old and mighty Rome, of
whom pedants prate, subdued but the meaner
part of man&mdash;his body; but our Rome enslaves
the mind&mdash;that mind, which, once enslaved,
leaves nothing for opposition or for
defeat. Look round thee&mdash;a peevish dotard

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

in his seven-throned palace tramples with his
palsied foot on the necks of the crowned
kings of earth, from the shores of the Orcades
to the cliffs of Calpe. He stamps with it, and
their blood, their treasures, and their vassals
are poured on Asia, making the eastern world
tremble to its centre: for ours is the power
that not only binds the spirit but makes it
clasp its chain; ours are the powers of the
world to come; all that is potent in life, all
that is mysterious in futurity, the fears, the
hopes, the hearts of mankind, all are ours;
and shall we not wield the weapon their credulity
has put into our hands for our own
behoof?"&mdash;Genevieve gazed aghast, and he
proceeded more rapidly;&mdash;"All knowledge is
ours&mdash;to the laity the book is closed&mdash;the key
is lost&mdash;every avenue to science, every loophole
through which light might wander, is
barred up or sternly sentinelled; the tomes of
ancient wisdom are buried in monkish libraries,
unfolded, save by daring hands like mine.
Under the old tyrants of the earth, the decree
of a senate might desolate a province, and

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

the frolic of an emperor consume a city; but
when did it chain up the arm of man, or wither
his soul within him, like a papal interdict,
at whose reported sound the bridegroom
drops the hand of his betrothed, the mourner
quits the unburied corse, and the priest flies
from the altar? I tell thee, maiden, the eagles
of Ancient Rome would be blasted if they
dared to grasp the thunder that is now wielded
by the hand of every busy legate."</p>

<p>He paused, and Genevieve, though trembling,
ventured to answer.&mdash;"Alas for those,"
she said, "who twine, serpent-like, round the
tree of knowledge, neglecting the tree of life!
Thou hast sought," she added, "to dazzle me
by the display of that vast and uncurtained
fabric, of which thou art a pillar of strength;
but I behold nought in it save a monument of
the power, the craft, and the crime of man."&mdash;"Maiden,"
answered the prelate, "where
power is, <i>there</i> can be no crime, or none that
men will dare to call so. Does not the will of
the ruler mark the bounds of good and evil
throughout life? The murder of a parent, or

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

the marriage of a sister, have been the habits
even of regulated life; and when all power
is consigned to one hand, and mankind take
their law from one lip, shall not that be good
which we enjoin, and that only be evil which
we denounce? Then we shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil, yea creating it by
the breath of our mouth. Already are not
murder and assassination, rebellion and dethronement,
the canonized virtues of our
calendar? and needest thou farther proof of
our omnipotence? We have holy sins, and
may we not have unhallowed virtues? The
voice of Becket still warns the sovereigns of
earth from his enshrined grave, and the
blood of Ch&acirc;teauneuf hath been the signal for
shedding torrents of thy people's. Nay, let
thine eyes gaze not in horror, but in conviction,
on the view I unfold to thee: expand
thy thought to receive the glorious stranger.
Omnipotent on earth as we must be, wilt
thou not share with us that, which having,
we shall leave heaven to the dreamer of the
cloister, or the famine-wrung and theorizing

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

heretic; the crowned idiots we rule
shall have their tinsel sceptres; the warlike
savages we need, shall have the chase, the
battle, and the crusade; the peasant his
scourge and his fetter; and for us, ours shall
be all knowledge, all power, all enjoyment.
Yea, if there be yet unknown regions in this
ample globe, where the eagle of Old Rome
never dared to spread her pinions, or flesh
her beak, even there I behold with no erring
vision the cross floating above unnamed
fanes, and emblems of faith unknown, and,
wherever the voice of man is heard, its
language shall yet be <i>Dominus Deus noster
Papa.</i>"</p>

<p>And as he spoke, such was the preternatural
dilation of his figure, and the awful
pealing of his voice, that he seemed as one
who "in spirit saw rich Mexico, the seat of
Montezume."</p>

<p>But Genevieve was now beyond fear; depravity
revolted more than splendour could
inebriate, or power appal her, and every
word that the speaker imagined would exalt

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

him above her veneration, was fast sinking
him below her very scorn.</p>

<p>"Thou hast led me," she said, in a low
but firm voice, "to an eminence from
whence I look down scared indeed, but not
bewildered; but who hath led <i>thee</i> thither?
Is it not He who hath boasted that his are
the kingdoms of the world and the glory of
them? and wilt thou receive them as his
gift, and fall down and worship him for
them? Infatuate, desperate exchanger, pause
on the price, and count the cost."&mdash;"Another
of thy hovel-bred whimsies!" said
the prelate, quaffing a goblet of wine, and
sinking on his couch, that he might view her
as she stood with more luxury of leisure:
"what know we of that mysterious, and
perchance unreal, being thou hast named,
but that he is powerful? That he is miserable
and malignant it imports not; man is miserable
and malignant too, without the dignity
of the fallen angelic chief. What he can
menace, I defy; what he can bestow, I can
myself acquire, and share with him unthanking.

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

Not from him proceed the diseases
that erode the frame, or the anguish
that wrings the heart, and still less the power
to escape from either; both are from man&mdash;at
once his own tormentor and physician.
What wonders are wrought by the increasing
progress of art, that laughs to scorn alike the
miracles of saints and the plagues of the fiend!
Are not all the lying legends that moulder in
our cloisters, of sight restored, health recovered,
yea, extinguished life revived, become
the mere daily operations of a sorry leech,
who would no more share the praise with
demon or demi-god than he would the liards
he earns by his craft? The air we breathe,
the herbs we tread on, the springs that bubble
unnoted in our ears, are full of the secret
power of renewing the decayed organ, of
bracing the pithless limb&mdash;full, perhaps, of
the power of rejuvenescence&mdash;of immortality.
List, maiden, for I fable not&mdash;the
march of mind hath begun; and though we
will not, because we may not check its
progress, we will at least fix its direction,
and mark all its discoveries and all its

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

triumphs for our own. Then shall the
dream of him who sees the wealth of worlds
distilling in one rich drop from his alembic&mdash;the
hopes of him who watches the airless and
buried lamp to kindle from its light the spark
of extinct vitality; yea, all the aspirations
destined to prove and to make man not lower
than the angels&mdash;all shall be fulfilled; and
with senses ever flourishing, with an undying
capacity of enjoyment, and life spontaneously
renewed, we shall count disease the
infirmity of fools, and death the refuge of the
coward; while we make earth a heaven,
and convert a frail and painful existence into
enjoyment and immortality."</p>

<p>The sound of his voice had long died
away, ere Genevieve could answer him: compassion
and horror struggled at her heart, and
forbade, for a space, all words. At length,
"Mighty and miserable man!" she exclaimed,
"and this is then thy creed, and this is thy
hope?&mdash;false, below the detection of the meanest
mind&mdash;wicked, beyond the seduction of
the most depraved. What progress permitted
knowledge may make in alleviating

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

the outward evils of human destiny, I know
not; but never can it avail against those on
which his everlasting state must hang. Can
it remove one evil passion from his heart?
has it subdued one in thine? Wouldst thou
not still be a groveling worm, the slave of
sensuality and sin? Thou&mdash;<i>thou</i> ambitious!&mdash;I
tell thee, godless priest&mdash;dishonoured noble!
the meanest of my people who couches on the
earth this night, rests him in a nobler hope,
and rises with loftier aspirations than thine.
Were even thine impious dream realized,
and thy life of blind and brutal fruition protracted
till dissolution were a mercy to its
loathing satiety, the meanest order of disembodied
spirits might drop a tear of angelic
pity on thy forfeited glory, and sigh over
thee, 'How art thou fallen from <i>heaven</i>, O
Lucifer, son of the morning!' "</p>

<p>She had instant reason to repent her temerity;
fury, and another expression more dreadful,
began to kindle in the bishop's eyes.
"And is this," he said, "is this the language
of a slave to her master? But my folly merits
such meed; the scorn in which thou holdest

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

distant felicities, teaches me well not to slight
the present." As he approached her, Genevieve
hopelessly shrieked&mdash;"How now!" cried
the bishop, as one of the curtains was raised
and a figure appeared at it;&mdash;"how now!&mdash;what
boldness licenses thine intrusion?"&mdash;"So
please you, my lord," said the speaker, without
advancing, "a band of some twenty knights,
fully accoutred with a body of men-at-arms,
are riding at full speed toward the castle: we
know not their purpose; they have neither
sounded trumpet nor sent herald; but their
bearing seems right hostile."&mdash;"We looked
for this," said the bishop, rising with the air
of one habituated to the most startling transitions
from voluptuousness to peril. "Look
that the wardens be on their posts, and that
a double band of archers line the battlements
and loopholes of the first gate: raise the
portcullis of the second gate, we will hold
parley with them from the platform there."
And as he spoke he departed, leaving Genevieve
alone, dazzled and appalled by all she
had seen or heard. She sat alone amid that
solitary grandeur, gazing on the walls and on

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

her gorgeous attire. A sense of guilt and degradation
mingled itself with her view of the
voluptuous apartments and of her own appearance:&mdash;she
knew she was not the loose
companion of that great and wicked man; but
she felt that she looked like such.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>MEANWHILE the bishop had gained the
upper gate of his castle, and the warders,
starting from their seats of stone hollowed
in its walls, held torches while the portcullis
was raised; and many attendants,
ecclesiastical and military, crowded the
arched way behind, their torches flinging
an umbered light on its narrow entrance
of grey stone and its ribbed arches. In the
front, and in strong contrast to the smoky
glare of the torches, and the dark masses
on which it fell, stood the Bishop of Toulouse,
magnificently arrayed as just risen
from a banquet; his crosier-bearer on one

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

side, and on the other his standard-bearer,
displaying the broad banner, embroidered
with the motto of the crusaders in wrought
gold, <i>Dieu et l'Eglise</i>. The bishop's castle
was fortified with unusual strength; from
the gate which opened on the drawbridge,
a flight of stone steps cut in the solid rock,
led to a second and higher gate, which
opened on the court-yard, whose level was
far above that of the moat; each of these
gates was defended by a strong portcullis,
and the first by a strong barbican and barriers
beside. A band of knights appeared
at the same moment riding close to the
barbican, having a stout train of men-at-arms
in their rear, and seeming to demand
parley. "Who and what are ye?" said
the bishop. "Knights as ye seem by your
guise, though not by your courtesy, who ride
in hostile wise so near the holy and peaceful
habitation of a churchman." At these
words a herald was about to apply his bannered
trumpet to his mouth, when the
foremost knight struck down his arm, and
pricking forward, reined up his steed in

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

the van; and rising in his stirrups, shook
his mailed hand at the bishop for a moment
without speaking; then extended it
right onward as if menacing the castle.
"Speak," said the bishop, "if any in yon
train can speak; I answer no dumb defiance.&mdash;Say
who ye are, and wherefore come
ye?"&mdash;"False priest! disloyal prelate!"
said the knight, whom rage alone had bereft
of speech. "Full well thou knowest
who we are, and wherefore we are come.
Thou holdest a prisoner within thy godless
walls, for whom the royaume of King Philip
were but meet ransom. Thou wottest whom
we mean. Deliver her suddenly and ransomless,
or thy proudest turret shall kiss
foundation-stone ere the morn;&mdash;darest
thou deny that such is here?"&mdash;"And admit she
be," said the prelate, "she hath sought shelter
here, and here shall she abide, till the
royal mandate of King Philip claim her,
not the light summons of nameless wanderers."&mdash;"Thou
liest in the throat, priest!"
said another knight, "but we will not parley
in words with thee, we will suddenly return

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

in stronger force, and see if thy towers then
hold not softer parley with our catapults
and arbalists."&mdash;"Advance a war-wolf
against these towers," said the bishop, in
the perfect calmness of resolved crime,
"and that very hour the deepest moat of
my castle shall be measured, by a weight
that shall never be raised till the day of
judgment."&mdash;"Thou darest not such outrage,"
said the knights, "in the face of
Europe, of Christentye, of chivalry&mdash;thou
darest not. We defy thee."&mdash;"Defy not
me, ye triflers&mdash;boys who ride forth with a
lady's favour for your casque, and a sonnet
for your cuirass! What I dare to say, I dare
act, and avouch with sword and lance,"
said the warlike prelate. "And I say to
thee, Bernard de Vaugelas, and to thee,
Pierre de Limosin, for I know ye both, as
well by your cognizances as by your saucy
bearing, that I lack not royal warrant
for word and deed. Ye shall have the
proof anon! On the distant hills I see
a royal courier, and he beareth him
right onward to this castle."&mdash;"Thou

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

shalt never be the wiser of his counsels,"
said the knights: "we will slay that false
courier with our lances ere he arrive; right
well we know the errand he rides on."&mdash;"Recreant
and disloyal knights," said the
prelate, "no marvel that ye thus insult the
church in the person of her highest dignitary,
when ye dare defiance to the missives of your
liege lord the king: but look to the end!"&mdash;"Lawless
kings and godless priests merit
such meed," cried the knights, as they
wheeled round in fierce career to intercept
the courier. At the bishop's order signals
were hoisted from the warder's tower to instruct
the courier the path he was to pursue.
The messenger, after checking his course for
a moment, appeared to understand and obey
the signals, and turned in another direction.
Meanwhile the knights pricked up the hill,
and soon reined their steeds on its summit,
cresting it, as they stood, like a battlement of
iron; while their men-at-arms, though sorely
galled by the archers' shot that flew fast and
heavy from the bishop's towers, gathered
close to the drawbridge, so as to cut off the

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

possibility of the messenger's arrival. The
unfortunate courier saw his mortal peril, ride
where he might; but he was not unprovided
for the emergency: he attached his letters to
an arrow, and, drawing the bow with his
utmost strength, he shot towards the castle
with good aim, and the arrow fell near the
bishop's feet, at the same moment that the
hapless bearer expired under the lances of the
knights. The bishop in triumph held up the
letters during this dreadful scene, and immediately
quitting his situation, the portcullis
was lowered. The knights, after venting
their rage in as many curses as must
have made ample matter for their next confession,
withdrew with their train into an
adjacent wood, not caring to abide in the
town, lest their commerce with some of the
bishop's domestics, touching their secret admission
into the castle, should be suspected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Genevieve, left so unexpectedly
alone, and unobserved, had lost no time in
profiting by the opportunity. She had noticed
with quick observation, that the compartments
of that splendid chamber were

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

filled with curtains in strict conformity to its
oriental costume; and she conceived that
through one of these she might have easier
and less discoverable access to the other
apartments of the castle, than through doors
hollowed in walls of stone.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of the bishop, she
raised one of the curtains, and found herself
in a long vaulted passage, lit at the extremity
by the flame that arose from an iron cresset.
She advanced with trembling steps towards
the light. It burned before an arched door
that closed the extremity of the passage.
She paused in deep disappointment, when
the sobs of an agonized spirit were heard
issuing from the apartment; and instantly
forgetting her own dangers and terrors, she
ventured to raise the latch of the door, and
to enter. It opened on another magnificent
chamber, but inferior to that she had just
quitted. It seemed as if one were painted
by the burning fingers of luxury and passion
for the welcome of their favourites: the other,
as if arrayed by the gorgeous but cold hand
of ceremony for the reception of its guests.

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

All was chaste and splendid: a fretted lamp
of silver shed its light on silken tapestry,
wrought with the exploits of the Spanish
knights against the Saracens; and at the
upper end of the chamber lay a lady under
a silken canopy, her veil cast over her head,
and apparently lost in grief. So light was
the tread, so soft the approach of Genevieve,
that she stood before the lady for
some moments unseen as unheard, till the
latter, flinging off her veil, gazed round her
suddenly. The form of the beautiful Genevieve,
gorgeously arrayed, gleamed before
her like a vision. At the first view the lady
uttered a faint shriek; then recognizing her,
she instantly assumed the conscious dignity of
"high habitual state;" for without bowing her
head, or extending her arm, "I know thee
now," she said; "thou art she with whom I
journeyed here, and to whom I entrusted a
gem of price to win thy secrecy if thou knewest
me, or thy aid if thou knewest me not: but
I see," she said, casting a haughty glance on
Genevieve's glittering habit, and then on her
own tunic of dark blue velvet, sprinkled in silver

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

with the lilies of France&mdash;"I see how it hath
fared with thee: thy gay habit proclaims thee
already the victim and the scoff of thy brutal
enthraller. Why comest thou here to insult
that misery, perchance, thy fatal beauty hath
caused?"&mdash;"Lady," said Genevieve, offering
her again the gem, "as pure as this gem
sparkles, so pure is the hand that offers it
to thine. Dare I else stand before thee?
Dare I claim the sanctity of my sex, or
feel that which I do this moment&mdash;that in
thy presence I am safe, were I what thou
deemest me?"&mdash;"Thou art wise as well as
fair, damsel," said the lady, half rising from her
couch: "to what lofty descent am I to ascribe
speech so gentle and thoughts so noble?"&mdash;"Alas!"
said Genevieve, "humble birth and
most unhappy lot were but worthless commendations
to thy favour&mdash;I must win it by
better deservings: by happy chance I have
discovered the means of reaching this apartment
unobserved; aid me to pursue those
means, and if, as I deem, thou art with me
a reluctant inmate here, we may yet devise
for our liberation."&mdash;"May the saints aid thee

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

in the purpose they have inspired!" said the
lady fervently; "and now I bethink me,
chance hath also favoured me. My chief attendant
was once of the deluded heretics
men call the Albigenses: she was borne prisoner
here, and became (by means I cannot
tell) the loose companion of the godless bishop;&mdash;from
thence she sunk into a menial, and
now half her wretched existence is passed in
carousal and vile degradation&mdash;half in weeping
her former state: yet such fast-clinging
hold hath she of her early errors, that when
I bow to the cross, she ever quits my chamber,
though it be all the while to hold loose
talk with the pages in the antechamber.
Such, alas! is the tenacity with which we
cling to creeds, and the ease with which we
resign principles!"&mdash;Genevieve sighed and
shuddered at this portrait, as she reflected
that the unhappy original had once professed
the same pure faith, and, perhaps, possessed
the same unsullied conscience, as her own.&mdash;"This
will give us unobserved occasions of
meeting," continued the lady: "but art thou
not anxious, maiden," she said, "to know to

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

whom thou hast proffered thy services?"&mdash;"Alas!
noble lady," said Genevieve, "is it not
enough that it is a woman, and oppressed?
Trust me, no image touches mine heart more
pitifully, save"&mdash;she said, while her eyes filled
fast with tears, "save it were, perchance,
that of a very aged man&mdash;deserted, solitary,
and blind."&mdash;"I know not what thou meanest,
damsel," said the lady, who appeared to
be occupied by her own sufferings exclusively,
and even in suffering to feel that superiority
of rank which she dared not avow, and
yet wished to be instinctively understood.
"Perchance thy zeal will not slack," she said
more proudly, "at the recognition of its object.
I am Ingelberg the queen, and wife of
Philip Augustus."&mdash;Genevieve instantly sunk
to the floor, and kissed the hem of her sovereign's
garment: "and how," she said, raising
her eyes, "how did I, a peasant damsel, dare
to murmur at my fate, when the royal lady
of the land is held enthralled by her false vassals?
Madame," she continued, "where is
the faith and power of thy royal spouse&mdash;of
thy children&mdash;of thy nobles? why is a helpless

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

maiden the sole attendant on the wife of
King Philip, and the sovereign of France?
Oh God! forgive me, that till now I thought
suffering the sworn-brother of humble birth
alone!"</p>

<p>"Amen to thy prayer!" said the queen, smiling
through her tears; "for surely the thought
favoured much of ignorance. From that sad
and splendid hour, when I sat by the side of
Philip, the crowned queen of France, till
this, never did I place my head on a pillow
in peace, or raise it in hope. King Philip
loved all womankind but me, and I bore his
early wanderings without a murmur; but as
my children grew up<sup id="ref033"><a href="#en033">33</a></sup>," (her voice was choked,)
"my loving and loyal son, Prince Lewis,
was urged by my wrongs to brave his father,
dagger in hand, while yet a boy. Oh, what a
sight for a mother and a queen to witness!
But now King Philip, neglecting the crusades
against Saracen or heretic, is given wholly to

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

the love of the fair Agnes of Moravia: she
hath borne him children; and for her sake
was I to have been poisoned, that she might
have reigned queen of France. Wherefore,
holding my life to be merely perilled, unless
I put the broad seas between my lord the
King and me, it was my purpose to escape to
the King of Denmark, my brother, and there
enshroud me in the habit of a nun; for, trust
me, maiden," gracefully placing her hand
on the bright locks of Genevieve, "if peace
ever settles on a brow that was once as fair
as thine, it will be when wrapt in a veil, not
when bound by the diadem of France!"</p>

<p>"But, my liege lady," said Genevieve,
"were there not nobles and knights to assert
the rights of the queen? Are they not now
thundering at the gates of this palace of
crime and tyranny?"</p>

<p>"And who are they?" said the queen in a
melancholy accent.&mdash;"Even knights and
troubadours. Alas! maiden, that I must
initiate thee into the crimes and voluptuousness
of these times! These men, who pride
themselves on composing some disjointed

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

sonnets as harsh as the hymns of the Albigenses,
ever select some beauty or noble
dame for the subject;&mdash;some of them have
even dared to make <i>me</i> the subject of their
songs: and it is to this I owe that they are
now wasting their threats against these impregnable
towers. They deem a mistress as
indispensable to a troubadour, as a saint to a
religionist. And if I owe my deliverance to
them, it will be to a spirit of romantic and
licentious gallantry, not to the devoir which
true knights should pay, by their vow, to a
persecuted female, and a deserted queen."&mdash;"Now
go," said Ingelberg, "ere thine attendant
surprise thee; and remember me,
maiden, in thine orisons."</p>

<p>Genevieve again kissed the hem of her
sovereign's robe, and regained her own chamber
without observation.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE next morning, Genevieve had scarce
time to collect her thoughts on the important
event of the preceding night, when the passage
leading to her chamber rang with the
tread of armed feet; and the bishop, harnessed
all but his head, stood before her, a
page bearing his lance and helmet.</p>

<p>"Damsel," he said, "a hasty summons
calls me hence. I speed to aid the Abbot of
St. Etienne, to siege and spoil the castle of
the Lord of Ventadour, who hath borne away
the abbot's leman, and denies to hold her to
ransom. Such aid may I demand from the

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

abbot at mine own need; and harness was
never buckled on bolder breast, nor lance set
in rest by more warlike hand, than those of
that mettled churchman. Pity and shame it
is that he sporteth away life amid lemans
and ladies, instead of rallying in the van of
the Crusaders! Were not a woman the
cause, never would he have lifted spear
against the Lord of Ventadour, though he
had burned the abbey over his head. A
peaceful churchman, and an orderly!"</p>

<p>"What churchmen?" thought Genevieve,
as she stood silently before him, offering mute
and internal thanksgiving for his absence on
any terms, as feeling herself free from persecution
and peril worse than death for that
period at least. She was about to add, "I
thought your intendment was against the
heretics;" but she checked herself, conceiving that she might learn more from the
bishop's communications than from her own
inquiries.</p>

<p>"Nay, seat thee, damsel," said the prelate:
"why should trembling beauty stand servilely
before one who hath ever been beauty's

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

vowed slave? Can aught be done to pleasure
thee in my absence? Speak and command
me."</p>

<p>"If my lord would listen to the prayer
of his handmaid," said Genevieve, "let
me be permitted to walk more frequently
in the gardens of the castle." The bishop's
brow contracted. "Oh!" said Genevieve, clasping
her hands, "let not my lord be angry,&mdash;I
dream not of liberty or of hope. But let
me breathe the pure air of heaven, see the
distant mountains above the walls of my garden-prison;
see the work of God's hands, not
of man's, once more, and weep in freedom,&mdash;grant
me but this. Alas! here," she continued, "the rich and heavy odours of these
perfumed chambers are like the steams of
intoxication, magic, and sin."&mdash;"Order shall
be taken for it," said the bishop, softened
by her supplicating earnestness. "But well
didst thou term thine hope of escape from
hence a dream; for in mine absence will rule
a sterner master of this wild household than
I have been, an austere priest now, though
once a preacher of thy heretic creed."&mdash;Genevieve,

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

accustomed to vicissitudes, heard him
without betraying any emotion. "Wouldst
thou know who is the master of my household
in mine absence? It is thy former associate,
even the deacon, Mephibosheth: was
not such his Jewish name?"&mdash;Genevieve, who
feared that her answer might provoke him; was
silent, till reading in his eye that her silence
displeased, she uttered what she felt in three
short words,&mdash;"Is it possible?"&mdash;"Possible!"
retorted the prelate, "all things are possible
to him who grasps with one hand the
sword of earthly power, and holds in the
other that visionary key that unlocks the
portals of the world to come. Maiden, be
wise! obey the lesson that the wise deacon
hath set thee; and, look thou be in more
tractable mood on my return."&mdash;"And by
what means," said Genevieve timidly, "hath
such sudden conversion been wrought?"&mdash;"By
means proportioned to their end!" said
the bishop. "Give me man, not brute matter
to deal with, and I will baffle the boast of
that antique dreamer, who said, 'Give me
where I may stand, and I will move the

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

world.' There be weights some may not
raise with levers, and others can balance with
a straw. Slight engineers were we, unless
we knew what load was to be drawn with
wain-ropes, and what with a thread! They
had fasted and penanced the worthy deacon
in the abbey of Normoutier, till he was a
mere skeleton. I wrought by other means: I
caused the deacon not to fast, but to dine with
me. The controversy was hot, and so were
the viands; the strife rose high, but higher
mantled the goblets; and the man who
would have contended at the stake for his
faith, resigned it for a mess of pottage,
swallowed councils and confections in the
same mouthful, and digested the celibacy of
priests by the help of an eringo pie. What!
shall I lose a convert for lack of saffron<sup id="ref034"><a href="#en034">34</a></sup> in
his condiment, or hurl fathers, fire and faggot
at one who is best convinced by marchpane
and malvoisie?"&mdash;"And canst thou rely on

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

the sincerity of such converts?" said Genevieve.&mdash;"For
their sincerity, I reck not of
it!" said the prelate; "but on their thenceforth
close-linked fealty to me do I most
surely reckon. Their crime hath placed a
gulf between them and mankind; their
former fellows dread and hate, their new
associates doubt and despise them. In such a
state they can become important only by
crime; therefore by that they distinguish
themselves, and are flagitious by the fixed
necessity of their situation. The habit of
doubting, too, ends for the most part in infidelity:
then are they meet for any task that
power and guilt may enjoin them. Oh! for a
ruthless despiteous deed, appoint me ever your
cold-hearted infidel, not your burning bigot:
the latter may exalt crimes into virtues, but
the former holds virtues very crimes; he loathes
those habits he cannot participate in, those
hopes he cannot aspire to, the forfeited blessings
of the birthright he has sold: and therefore
will he labour to prove, that they who
trust in them are fools; that their virtue is
hypocrisy, their religion a name, and their

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

hope a lie."&mdash;"Alas!" thought Genevieve sadly,
"that such high gifts of physical power and
mental might should be bestowed on one
like thee, who wieldest them only against
the Power that gave them!"</p>

<p>"What thinkest thou of my convertite?'
said the bishop, with haughty irony.&mdash;"May
Heaven have mercy on him!" said the maiden.&mdash;"If
thou disbelievest what I tell thee,"
said the bishop, "wilt thou believe thy
senses?" And he stamped with his armed
foot, and at the sound the quondam deacon,
Mephibosheth, in full clerical habit, advanced
between two priests of the bishop's household,
all three chaunting with as much vigour
and vociferation as St. Augustin of yore,
when he approached the Saxon king, with
the cross in the van, and the priests in the
rear singing litanies.</p>

<p>"Suffer me," said the bishop, "suffer
me, fair lady, to present to thee our chaplain
and secretary&mdash;even Sir Ambrose, a
reverend priest of the grave and godly household
of the Bishop of Toulouse. Come on,
Sir priest; speak for thy function. Expound

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

to this fair heretic the texts that concern
this matter of thy conversion."</p>

<p>At the word, Sir Ambrose advanced, and
forthwith commenced a predication, so long
and loud, urging with such inverted tenacity
all the most popular topics of a Catholic controversialist,
and breathing so hotly the spirit
of proselytism to his new creed, that Genevieve,
after raising her appealing eyes to the
bishop and preacher, at length, saddened and
sickened at heart by this horrid prostitution,
burst into an involuntary flood of tears. The
bishop, though he despised tears, could not
behold those of beauty unmoved, and he dismissed
the deacon.</p>

<p>"See now," he said, "by what threads
weights may be drawn. That man would
have bit out his tongue and spit at me at the
stake, yet hath he melted before the fires lit
in my kitchen. I hold your true infallibility
lies not in a conclave, but in a council of
your sapient and savoury cooks, and Sir
Ambrose deems the doctrine orthodox."&mdash;"I
ever held him a slave to sensual appetite,
and a boaster," answered Genevieve.&mdash;"And

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

for those who are slaves to <i>mental</i> appetites,"
said the bishop, "it is as easy to find fetters&mdash;or
snares:&mdash;ambition&mdash;pride&mdash;even rapacity&mdash;they
be glorious guilts that boast themselves&mdash;faults
that men share with the mightiest of
earth's lords; perchance, if all that is written
in thy forbidden volume be true, with the
highest order of angelic beings: but sensuality,
the low and loathsome working of a carnal
spirit, proves it not <i>my</i> power to discover
such an agent, and to make him work my
will?"&mdash;"There be those who, I yet think,
would resist all that thou couldst offer&mdash;and
thy power is mighty; all thou couldst menace&mdash;and
thy wrath is deadly," said the maiden.&mdash;"Name
them," quoth the bishop, glancing
over his tablets. "I have names here written
down. Mattathias, a brutal warrior; Boanerges,
a powerful preacher. The saints speed
me through this catalogue of names, assumed
from their Jewish theology!&mdash;Why, maiden,
I tell thee," he said, laughing at the list,
"as lightly as I won the deacon Mephibosheth
to become my chaplain&mdash;it is but after a few
hours of torture or of luxury, as we have to

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

deal with strong or with relaxed habits, to
put a lance into the hands of the mighty, or
a text into the mouths of the eloquent, and
thy Mattathias and Boanerges shall severally
volley their arrows or their curses against what
side I choose to point. The one I could win by
the glory of riding a knight in the crusading
army&mdash;the other by the hope of out-thundering
all its trumpets in proclaiming the miracle
of his conversion."&mdash;"It may be so," said
Genevieve, trembling at her own temerity,
"it may be so but there are yet two names
unwritten in thy book of seduction and
death. "&mdash;"And which be they," said the bishop.&mdash;"Those,"
said Genevieve, "of a blind,
poor, and aged man, who would spurn at the
proffer of all visible creation, being as one
who sees the <i>Invisible</i>, and prizes that vision
alone; and of a despised and enthralled
maiden, who sets all claim of glorious ancestry
below the boast of inheriting his faith, his
fortitude&mdash;and if Heaven so wills, his sufferings."&mdash;The
bishop's trumpets sounded to
horse as she spoke, and he started on his feet
at the summons, snatching his helmet and

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

lance from his page. He paused a moment,
and flung back one wild and flashing glance
on Genevieve. "Maiden," he said, "by heaven
I leave thee with reluctance, though that
trumpet summons me to the fearful game,
which I love as laggards love their chess and
draughts. Thy voice would wake a warrior's
soul within him more deeply than all the
trumpets of a royal host, were they thundering
around the oriflamme of France. But
every word thou speakest rivets the chains of
thy destiny more fixedly. Thou must be
ours," he said with reverted glance. "Thou
must be <i>mine</i>," as he flung his helmet on his
head; and the streaming plumes floating far
backward at the motion, he strode from the
chamber, leaving Genevieve relieved by his
absence, but dreading that after that absence
worse was to be feared from his return.</p>

<p>For three following days her existence was
as wretched as prescriptive and monotonous
existence always must be. In the afternoon
she was permitted, and even enjoined, to walk
in the garden; for the bishop was as jealous
of the beauty of a selected favourite, as a

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

florist would be of the stripes of a tulip, or
the tint of a hyacinth. But never did she quit
her chamber, or take her guarded walk, save
watched by two sentinels, who crossed her
path at every step: her only hours of indulgence
were those passed with the imprisoned
queen, whose apartment she gained every
night by means of the passage through the
oriental chamber, without detection or even
suspicion. They sat together&mdash;wept while
they talked of hope, and hoped more fervidly
while they wept:&mdash;then parted with
mutual assurances of happier prospects on the
morrow; and met with the melancholy smile
that announced the augury vain: and while
the last day's disappointment wrung their
hearts, prepared for the renewal of the pang
by talking of the hope that to-morrow would
"bring forth."</p>

<p>It was on the fourth evening that Genevieve,
raising with slow and timid touch the
latch of the royal apartment, beheld queen Ingelberg
standing right opposite to it, her form
irradiated, and buoyant with hope and joy.
"Tidings," she cried, ere Genevieve could

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

well enter the apartment, "tidings of hope!
Bernard de Vaugelas and Pierre de Limosin
are riding near the walls of the castle. I have
strained mine eyes from the casement the
live-long day, to watch them as they rode.
I saw them careering at the head of a troop
of men-at-arms; and so aptly did they counterfeit
in their action the surprisal of a castle
by a secret passage, and the deliverance of an
imprisoned lady, that while I beheld them I
deemed myself at liberty again: and for my
better assurance, the streamers of their lances
were all of green, the cherished colour of
hope; the very same their scarves were of in
the lists of the castle of Plessy, when their
sonnets were first sung, and their lances shivered,
in honour of the fair queen of France.
But why speak I of this to thee, who art
ignorant of the gallantries of a court, as,"
she added with a sigh, "thou art innocent of
its crimes?" Yet a reminiscence of former
splendour and gaiety mingled obviously with
the regret which Ingelberg seemed to bestow
on the errors and the perils of courtly existence.
"Now aid me, damsel," said the queen

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

with renewed spirits, "to place this lamp in
the casement; for well as I might judge by
their signals, they required me to leave the
casement ope, and place a lamp withal, in
token that I understood and approved their
purpose."</p>

<p>Genevieve obeyed; and then seated herself
at the casement, trembling with hope, solicitude,
and doubt. The queen never ceased to
utter vivacious and rapturous exclamations.
Genevieve was deeply silent. The one whose
habits had been (with some interruptions)
those of command and pleasure, felt that she
breathed once more in the lofty elements of
her native atmosphere: to the other, joy was
so rare a visitor, that when it came it was
slowly recognized and timidly welcomed.</p>

<p>The night was calm, the lamp burned
with a steady light, and the stillness of high
expectancy in that lonely apartment was
singularly contrasted with the sounds of
revelry that rose from the hall below, where
the loose household of the bishop were
feasting.</p>

<p>They had not long sat thus, when the

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

queen asked her, did she not hear a sound
approaching? "Of a surety do I, royal lady,"
said Genevieve; her senses bearing joyful
testimony to the hopes of Ingelberg: each
interpreted the augury according to their
different associations.</p>

<p>"It is like the floating of a knight's
bannerol," said the queen.&mdash;"Methinks,"
said Genevieve, "it is like the fluttering
flight of a wearied bird:" and as she spoke,
a pigeon flew through the open casement:
then, scared by the light of the lamp, it fluttered
round the chamber, and at last rested
on the bosom of Genevieve; while the queen,
who understood this mode of communication
better than her companion, soon detached an
epistle, elaborately tied and curiously perfumed,
from the wing of the wearied bird:
its superscription was&mdash;"To her who, in yielding
the title of Queen of France, hath won
that of Queen of all loyal hearts and stout
lances:" and the first lines of the epistle
corresponded with such induction, for they
began&mdash;"Let all loyal lovers utter vows
to their Lady Venus and the blessed Saint

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

Martin, whose eve devout Christians are now
about to celebrate, and they shall find their
prayers answered."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the anxious Ingelberg, "how
mockful in our hour of wretchedness is that
jargon of profane gallantry to the ear of a
prisoner listening for the hope of her disenthralment;
it is worse than the language
of France sounded in mine ear when I first
heard it: and mine eyes so ache, and mine
hands so tremble!" she cried in tears, letting
the letter fall; "and I have no one to read to
me the purpose couched in the fine fooleries
of their poetical and courtlike affectedness."</p>

<p>"If it please the queen's grace, I skill to
read," said Genevieve timidly.&mdash;"Thou!"
said the queen in amaze: "then thou hast
deceived me, and surely art of noble birth, or
else" (she added, pausing and recoiling)&mdash;"an
heretic!"&mdash;"Does it avail," said Genevieve
humbly, "what she may be, who, in the
hour of extremity, can render true service
to her sovereign?"&mdash;"Read on, then," said
the queen, "sith it must be; but overpass
those flourishings and gaudy illuminations of

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

the scroll, and come plainly to the text."&mdash;"The
purport is," said Genevieve, with
difficulty disentangling the meaning from
the intricate meshes of amorous phraseology
in which it was involved, "that thy deliverers
are this night conferring with one who
hath promised them secret entrance into the
castle; that they hold his promise stronger
than his power; they dare not communicate
more, lest messenger and message both
be intercepted; but they will thee, royal
lady, if thou receivest this letter, to return
and superscribe it&mdash;'courage to loyalty, and
hope to beauty.'&mdash;Such is the letter," said
Genevieve, blushing as she perused it.&mdash;"And
how, oh! how," said Ingelberg, impatiently
wringing her hands, "can I return
answer to them, being bereft of the writing
materials I bore about me till I was
conveyed hither?"&mdash;"Madame," said Genevieve,
fertile in resources, "despond not yet.
I bear a bodkin in mine hair that can make
deep impression, and from those four wax
torches that burn so fair in the corners of
your chamber, may we not glean enough to

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

cover the paper withal, and trace on them
the lines thy deliverers seek?"&mdash;"Do as thou
wilt," said the queen, "for I give myself to
thee solely, whatever thou mayest be. I am
so lost betwixt fear and joy, that I could not
now dictate, or write a line." Genevieve
expeditiously and dexterously prepared the
paper, traced the required characters on it,
and then, with the queen's assistance, fastening
it by a silken thread, dismissed the bird
of good augury on its flight. They then
placed themselves once more close to the
casement to await his return, each employed,
though in different ways, in soliciting that
aid, without which this desperate enterprise
seemed impracticable; Genevieve, in silent
internal prayer, and the queen in making a
vow of a pix and chalice of pure gold to the
church of Saint Olave, the patron of Denmark;
but this situation, at once agitating
and sedentary, soon became intolerable to
both, and with all allowance for the miscalculation
of the progress of time, (unavoidable
under such circumstances,) the delay of the
bird's return, now protracted for hours, began

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

to justify the terrors that seized them.
Genevieve subdued the consciousness of hers
in attempts to soothe the queen; but Ingelberg
gave way to her fears, her repinings, and
her impatience, with the vehemence of one
long accustomed to consider even time her
vassal, and to believe that mortal powers and
agents, when employed in her service, should
suddenly be invested with the might of supernatural
ones. "Ah!" said she sadly, "why
did I trust a deceitful troubadour?" and her
memory suggested to her an ancient song, in
which a disappointed retainer of one of them
complains of their fickleness, arrogance, and
levity; "they will promise any thing, but
it is vanity, not truth, that prompts their
boastings, and they would rather make
themes for their own vaunting and perishable
verses, than be recorded in the true histories
of renowned knights. They will promise to
ladies their liberty, to their brothers in arms
the aid of lance and sword, to minstrels liberality,
and to the saints jewels and robes of
price; but their promises are false as vows

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

made in wine, or love professed by a noble
for a plebeian maiden:&mdash;who boasts and deceives
like a false troubadour?"&mdash;"Surely,
royal lady," said Genevieve, "the knights
will redeem their pledge; and even now
something interposes between mine eyes and
that star on which they have been fixed so
long."&mdash;"It is a passing cloud," said the
queen.&mdash;"But I hear the fluttering of wings."&mdash;"It
is the sighing of the breeze," answered Ingelberg;
but as she spoke the faithful messenger
once more arrived, and the letter he
bore contained intelligence beyond the imaginings
of hope&mdash;their deliverance was to be
unfailingly accomplished on the following
night by means which the writer had not
time to explain, but which precluded the
possibility of disappointment or of discovery;
and they had prudently delayed this
communication, till, by the extinguished
lights they judged that all the inmates of the
castle were retired to rest. "Did I not tell thee
so?" cried the queen, offering her hand to the
humble kiss of Genevieve, her despondency

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

all forgotten,&mdash;"did I not say it from the
first? Why wouldst thou disquiet me with
thy fears? Ah!" she cried, in the spirit of
the age, "ah! who is it that loves and fights
like the valiant troubadour?"</p>

<br/>

<p>FROM a troubled and melancholy dream,
Genevieve awoke at dawn, with a confused
consciousness of something important to be
done or expected soon; even when her recollection
returned, she felt like one stunned
by the magnitude and indefinite extent of
some vast and suddenly disclosed prospect.
She could scarce comprehend her situation,&mdash;a
heretic&mdash;the thrall of a godless libertine&mdash;the
queen of France herself a prisoner
in the same towers&mdash;their deliverers
knights, and troubadours, men valiant, loyal,

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

(in the amorous language of the day,) but
licentious, and, perchance, presuming on the
success of their enterprise. With joy inexpressible
she greeted the moment allowed
for her brief exercise in the garden of the
castle; for she felt that the agitation of
her mind had extended to her frame; and
that rapid and restless motion of the latter
would be something like a balance to the
painful impulses of the trembling dweller
within. In the garden she almost forgot her
terrors; the day was unusually lovely; there
was a tender and vernal blue in the sky,
a fresh mildness in the air, and a lingering
glow of autumnal flowers, that transported
the imagination, almost to the bright
auspicious season that follows winter.
There was a pillared arcade which the
bishop had caused to be constructed to
the south of the garden. Here, as Genevieve
sat musing, in apparent slumber, on
her situation of peril, and her hope of liberty,
her sentinels, who had hitherto walked at
a surly distance from her, now chanced to
pass nearer; and she heard one of them

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

say, "She sleeps, thou need'st not whisper;&mdash;I
tell thee it must be done to-night."&mdash;"What
must be done?" said his companion,
"for hitherto thou hast spoken thy purpose
darkly."&mdash;"The queen must be removed
this night," said the other. "Here have
been missives from the bishop, who, amid
the thunders of the siege, found leisure to
receive and answer the letters of King Philip,
touching the matter of the queen's thraldom,
and to send the order thou wottest
of, and which must be suddenly obeyed.&mdash;"What
cause hath the bishop to bear the
queen such deadly hatred?" asked the other.&mdash;"Tush,
thou art a fool," said Hugues,
"and knowest naught of state-policies; 'tis
not the bishop's hatred, but King Philip's love
she must rue. So madly doteth he on the
fair Agnes of Moravia, that he would bestow
the choicest gem in his royal crown to make
away queen Ingelberg. By lucky chance,
in her flight she was captived by our far-reaching
lord, who hath made her sudden
and sure removal the condition of obtaining
men and treasures for the crusade. And

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

such is the King's dotage, that he hath
yielded to all that hath been required of
him, and would have done so were King
John of England thundering at the gates of
Paris."&mdash;"The queen then dies to-night?"
said the companion with something like a
reluctance of natural horror as he spoke.
Genevieve's blood froze as she awaited the
answer, yet still she preserved the appearance
of sleep. "Deemest thou the bishop an unpolicied
ass like thyself?" said Hugues, "no!
he will have her conveyed in the deep sleep,
into which the drug he hath sent me, shall
cast her, to that vault beneath her chamber
which many have been known to enter but
none to return from. Yet his purpose aims
not at her life: that will he preserve with
jealous care, that, should King Philip deny
him future aid, he may in a moment annul
his adulterous marriage, by producing Queen
Ingelberg alive."&mdash;"But being wholly in his
power," said the other, "what needs there
that sleepy drug thou minglest in her cup
to-night?"&mdash;"To hinder cries heard, or resistance
made," answered Hugues. "Fools would

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

hold question till the day of doom! hear thou
thy task; the rather keep the household
from wandering near her chamber; say such
is the bishop's command: look that the door
to the vaulted passage be open, that she may
be borne thither without noise or delay, and
at midnight expect me bearing a royal burthen
in my arms, and winning a royal guerdon
by the deed."&mdash;"It is vengeance cold,"
said the other, who seemed but indifferently
affected to the undertaking:&mdash;"it is vengeance
cold! Would the lady would awake!"&mdash;Genevieve,
amid all her horror, had self-possession
enough not to "awake" too soon; and
when she at length appeared to do so, it
demanded her utmost efforts to conceal the
discovery she had made, and the feelings with
which it had inspired her. Though her eyes
were averted, she dreaded that her tottering
step and involuntary shudder would betray
her horror of the assassins. At length she
gained her apartment, and sat down in solitude
and despair.</p>

<p>The dreadful fate of the unfortunate
Queen on the very eve of liberation, and

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

with that fate her own involved&mdash;every way
the prospect was horrible and hopeless; her
mind succumbed beneath it, and she sat for a
time in fearful stupefaction. But long accustomed
to demands for instant mental exertion,
and never relaxed by the habit of indulgence
even in grief, she struggled to rally her
scattered and distracted faculties. Her first
thought was for the safety of the queen; but
how was it possible to gain her apartment
till after the hour of supper? and <i>at</i> that hour
the deadly drug was to be drunk, and she
must see her no more.</p>

<p>One sole means suggested itself of obtaining
an interview previous to the fatal hour of
supper, and, feeble and almost hopeless as it
was, she lost not a moment in attempting to
employ it. She had observed that Hugues,
who sometimes brought her meals, lingered
secretly to hear the solitary hymn which she
sung at their conclusion.</p>

<p>She had often discovered, that while at her
devotions, which always commenced and concluded
with a hymn, he was gently pacing
the adjacent gallery&mdash;and, as a stronger mark

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

of his sensibility of music, he had even presented
her with a small lute, obviously with
a view to his own increased indulgence,
though he said it was to soothe <i>her</i> solitude.
To this resource, slender as it was, she now
betook herself, and to propitiate him as far as
her limited powers enabled her, she forbore
to sing <i>hymns</i>, and tasked her memory for
some antique Proven&ccedil;al ballads, which she
had heard in her childhood. The spell
wrought, he lingered and listened. Her
voice, ever sweet and plaintive, now, under
the influence of deep emotion, poured forth
such rich and troubled tones that the wretch,
with nerves of iron and heart of stone, after
long reluctant struggle with a power too
mighty for him, at length cursed himself,
yielded to it, and</p>

<p class="small">"He wept&mdash;he wept." <i>Moore</i>.</p>

<p>In a few moments after he entered the chamber,
and while placing preparations for her
solitary meal, said somewhat slightly in praise
of her voice.&mdash;"Alas!" said Genevieve, assaying
her simple art, "thou canst not judge of
it. I am a bird that never could sing encaged,

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

were every bar of it gold: and to thraldom
now is added loneliness. Had I but a companion,
I think I could make music that would
be pleasant to thine ear."&mdash;"Thou shalt sup
in the hall to-night," said Hugues, after a
pause, "though I peril my place for it, so thou
wilt sing sweet songs that I love, and be as
the other damsels of the household."&mdash;"Oh,
no, no," said Genevieve, shrinking, "it is not
that I aim at&mdash;&mdash;look," she said, with an agonizing
effort at playfulness, pointing to the
cages with which her chamber was hung&mdash;"look
where many birds are gathered, they
sing not: they chirp and wander; but where
two are paired," pointing to a cage of doves,
"there they make sweet melody;&mdash;list to them
as thou lovest music, and by that sweet charm
let me see the imprisoned lady to-night. Oh,
never did mountain bird, sullen and drooping
on her perch alone, warble forth more blithely
when restored to a dear mate than will I, if
by thee I may win the sight of that sad lady.
Say me not nay," she cried, with vehement
sincerity and unforced tears&mdash;"to-night I
must see her, for my mind is wondrous sad

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

and heavy."&mdash;"To-night thou must if ever,"
thought Hugues; "to-morrow she may change
her gaoler for a ruder one, and her chamber
for a long and lightless prison."</p>

<p>Genevieve, who understood his horrid meaning
but too well, sick at heart, replied not.
Hugues stood pausing on her request: he
knew his victim sure, and pondered how to
purchase his indulgence at the cheapest price.
"If she should betray me," said Hugues, sullenly,
compressing his under-lip with his fingers.&mdash;"Deemest
thou me such a fool," said
Genevieve, with increased fervour, "as to mar
my last solace by mine own self-harming
treachery?"&mdash;"Thou speakest wisely, damsel,"
said Hugues; "it were indeed thy self-harm;
but," he exclaimed, turning suddenly,
and fixing his dark and piercing eyes on
her, "but whence is this marvellous importunacy,
damsel, and so sudden too, that thou
must visit that lady to-night?"&mdash;"Because,"
said Genevieve, "I have been haunted of late
with fearful dreams: I have dreamed of the
loss of a friend."&mdash;"Of what friend?" said
Hugues, eyeing her more closely. "I have

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

dreamed," said Genevieve, weeping unrestrainedly,
"that evil was about to befall&mdash;"&mdash;"Whom,
damsel?"&mdash;"Mine aged father,"
said Genevieve; and her tears flowed faster,
while her nice conscience checked her at the
word.&mdash;"Now for that word, damsel," said
Hugues, clasping her small fingers in his
coarse hand, "for that word thou hast won.
I am a reckless wretch; but that is the
priest's concern who will hear my last confession.
I have a mother&mdash;a wrinkled crone,
who weeps and rails and swears, an' I leave
not the bishop's service, I am but a lost man:
yet still I trow she loves me well. Dry thine
eyes, maiden: thou shalt see this lady: expect
me at the twilight."</p>

<p>The interval between his departure and
return was, to Genevieve, "like a phantasma
or a hideous dream." Reflection was
impossible: the very resources of imagination
failed; nor did even a vision of bright impossibilities,
such as often visits us in our
moments of darkest desperation, flash upon
her mind. She sat almost unconscious till
the gathering shades of evening reminded her

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

that the hour was come: the steps of Hugues
were heard in the passage; the light he bore
gleamed through the crevices of the door; it
was opened, and he beckoned her with cautious
gesture to follow him.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>ON reaching the apartment, Hugues lifted
the tapestry that covered the door, and
dropping it again instantly, Genevieve found
herself alone with the queen. She stood
there as she entered, unable to quit the spot,
to raise her eyes, or to utter a sound. The
chamber was nearly dark, nor did either at
first seem to distinguish the other. "Oh!"
said Ingelberg, who appeared to start from
broken sleep, "I have had such fearful
visions. Wearied with thought, I tried to
sleep; Virgin Mother forefend that mine
eyes should ever again close if they must see
forms so terrible! I dreamed that I saw our
friends riding all in the dim twilight, by the
banks of a river, and that they ever motioned

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

me to join them, still beckoning through the
shade and riding on. Oh, how I toiled to
follow; but heaps of armour, broken and
bloody, lay all before and around me; and
still as I removed the massive pieces, heavier
and heavier fell in my way; at length, I won
the brink of the river, but there was neither
bridge nor ford, and I stood bewildered and
calling on them, when a little bark, rowed
by an infant, set out from the opposite shore.
I entered it, and oh! how powerless seemed
the stroke of his oar in my dream, and how
often the cross-set currents drove us back
ere we reached the centre of the stream.
At length we gained it; when, his form
grew bigger&mdash;his eyes were fixed on me&mdash;a
fierce and fiendish laugh rung in mine
ears&mdash;it was Hugues.&mdash;And then&mdash;&mdash;but why
standest thou so sadly dumb and motionless?
Speak, I pray thee, maiden; amid the gloom
of the chamber thou lookest like some dim
spectre.&mdash;Speak, I command thee, speak,"
she cried in the quick loud voice of fear.
Genevieve, in brief and broken words, communicated
her dreadful tidings, she scarce

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

knew how; and the queen with one piercing
shriek dashed herself on the floor in
utter despair. Genevieve sunk on her knees
beside her, and, though hopeless, tried to
speak of hope!&mdash;"Hope!" exclaimed Ingelberg,
in a voice that chilled her blood.&mdash;"Hope!"
she repeated, madly playing with
the rushes with which the floor was strewed.
Then, rising slowly, and her eyes vacantly
but intently surveying every object in the
chamber, till at length they rested on
Genevieve,&mdash;"Yes, I will hope," she cried,
falling on her neck, "for there is something
in thy presence, maiden, that forbids despair."&mdash;"And
even now, is it not as by a
miracle I am in thy presence, and with the
permission of him who guards thee?" pursued
Genevieve eagerly, catching at a topic
of comfort. "Is not this a prosperous augury,
and proof, that a true earnest zeal
contends with all possible things, yea, with
those that seem impossible, and overcomes
them? May not something as wondrous
interpose yet for thy deliverance?&mdash;And
even now a thought visits me, wild but

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

most hopeful. Now do I turn prophetess
in thy cause, queen, and presage most truly,
that if we may but reach the vault undiscovered&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"The
vault!" exclaimed
Ingelberg, recoiling with horror; "art thou
mad, or wouldst thou drive me mad by such
horrid mention? Is not that the place whither
they are to bear me; the dungeon
of mine eternal captivity? Were I but
once to enter its dark round, hope, reason,
life would all desert me together."&mdash;"Hear
me, royal lady, hear thy poor vassal speak
only this once," cried Genevieve, zealously,
"and then resolve even as thou
wilt. Is not that the very direction in
which thy deliverers must come?&mdash;and what
if we meet them there? Is it not also a
place of safety and of concealment? for who
would search for thee there? Trust me, oh
queen, in this thing," she continued, trembling
with energy; "yield to the strong impulse
which rules me: for since I have
spoken, a light is on my mind, that, I do full
truly feel, comes not from any earthly, or
darker than earthly power, but from that&mdash;"&mdash;"Hush!"

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

cried the queen, stopping her ears,
"speak not thou of holy things&mdash;thou prayest
not to holy saints."&mdash;"I pray to One
mightier than they," said Genevieve, "even
their Maker and mine&mdash;the Creator, not the
creature."&mdash;"Hush!" interrupted the queen;
"for, however fairly thy words are ordered,
it were deep sin to listen to them. Speak to
me rather of this hope thou seemest to point
to."&mdash;"We will not speak of it now; it lies
all shapeless and imperfect in my thoughts,"
said Genevieve, as the hope, at first so
bright, rose in faded colours to her afterthought;
"but in its furtherance I pray thee,
royal lady, to meet this Hugues to-night
with smiles and cheerful favour; give him
all courteous entertainment, and seem to do
him honour; cause him that he sit at the
board with thee, and that he drink much
wine; this will give me time to look steadfastly
and definitely on that which is now
dimly unfolding itself to the mind's eye.
Nor must he," she added, "see thee thus
with dishevelled hair, and robes all deranged.
Will the queen permit so humble a handmaid?"

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

and lighting the lamp that hung
from the roof, she approached, while Ingelberg
silently let down her long hair, whose
profusion of pale gold locks covered the chair
as she sat. As she proceeded in her task with
trembling and silent dexterity, "It is not
alone in sleep we dream," said Ingelberg;
"but now methought I was in my royal
castle of Plessy; and thou, the most favoured
of my damsels, wast braiding my hair with
pearls. Tell me, may not this be yet?
Thou wilt not answer? Dost thou then
envy thy queen the last smile that may ever
visit her lip?" and as she spoke, though
talking of smiles, she burst into an agony of
tears. "For Heaven's sake, madame, be
more calm!" cried Genevieve: "alas! you will
have much need of calm dissembled looks
anon."&mdash;"Doubt me not," said the queen,
recovering herself, with a faint effort at cheerfulness;
"thou knowest I have right to a
double share of dissimulation, as a woman
and a courtier, and thou shalt see I will not
forfeit my privilege." As she spoke, steps
were heard approaching; and the voice of

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

Hugues sounded from an antechamber, where
some pages were playing dice, and some women
dancing loosely to the sound of the ghittern.&mdash;"Go
hence," he said; "the queen is
ill at ease, and must not be disturbed; and
look that ye approach not these, chambers
again all this night." Ingelberg's blood ran
cold at the sound, whose meaning she knew
too well. A few moments after Hugues entered
with preparations for supper, dismissing
the pages at the door. Full of the terrible
event of the night, the unfortunate females
observed the most trifling circumstances attendant
on this preparation with anxious and
watchful attention. Hugues, entering alone,
placed two silver dishes on the board, and
afterwards two goblets on a trivet adjacent,
with a vase of water, the eyes of the females
following him at every movement; the queen's
too intently, those of Genevieve cast down,
shaded by her long dark eye-lashes, but
equally observant. When he had finished
his preparation, he stood opposite to the
queen in respectful silence, waiting for the
signal to carve the meal. And now Genevieve

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

was astonished at that conventional self-possession
which is peculiar to the inmates of
a court: amid all her agitation, imbecility,
and terror, the queen addressed herself to
Hugues with a mixture of condescension
and dignity that enhanced each other; and
none but a court-practised eye could discover,
under the bland and beautiful smile that severed
her lips, the anguish that stiffened her
other features almost into convulsion.</p>

<p>"We thank our gentle gaoler," said the
queen, "for the solace he hath afforded us
in the society of this maiden, and will do him
meet requitement when in our royal palace,
where we shall smile at our enthralment to
this proud prelate here, as we would at a
vision of captivity that had haunted us in
our dreams. Meanwhile, receive such requitement
as we can give; sit at our board,
and partake the meal with thy sovereign:
and thou, maiden, sit too; we will it."&mdash;"Alas!
madame," said Genevieve, feebly
supporting her part in the drama the wretched
queen was forcing herself to act, "alas!

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

madame, demean not your royal rank by such
a guest."&mdash;"Sit; we command thee," said
the queen, while Genevieve obeyed with
undissembled awe of reluctance. Hugues
glanced his dark eyes from the queen to her
companion, as if he would read their souls;
then finally, with an expression resembling
that of a beast of prey who is sure of his victim,
and suffers it to sport out its space of
misery without the possibility of avoiding its
termination, he availed himself of the queen's
permission, seated himself at the table, and,
having no invincible aversion to rich viands,
exquisite wines, and the presence of beautiful
women, he soon became the most joyous
of the party. His own intense devotion
during the meal rendered him fortunately
regardless of the slender and tasteless homage
of his companions; and the wine, which the
queen repeatedly urged him to drink, did
not assist to quicken his powers of observation,
farther than related to the unintermitting
repletion of his ample goblet. Ingelberg,
meanwhile, though apparently from
time to time she touched her goblet with

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

her lips, took care never to imbibe a drop
of its contents. At the end of the meal,
while Hugues was removing the dishes,
(whose burthen had been lightened eminently
by his exertions,) the queen exclaimed,
"Alas! how different is this our gloomy meal
in a prison, from those in our palaces and
castles, where ladies danced, and troubadours
sung, at the waving of queen Ingelberg's
hand."&mdash;"Madame," said Hugues, whose
spirits were not less exalted by wine than
by the supposed condescension of the queen,
(for even in the temporary superiority given
by crime or accident, vulgar minds always
feel their inferiority, and bow to the grace
of the victim they prepare to sacrifice,)
"Madame, it is a proverb in my country,
that those who go forth to hear the song
of the nightingale, return well pleased with
the note of the thrush or the linnet; and if
it please your grace, I will essay my simple
skill."&mdash;"It pleaseth us well," said the
queen; and raising the untouched goblet
to her lips, she said, "We drink to the
strain of the thrush, since we may not hear

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

that of the nightingale." There needed no
more to excite Hugues, who, possessing a
mellow though untutored voice, pantomimic
humour, great self-confidence, and above
all, the inebriation inspired by female
beauty and applause, began with the
"<i>Parrot</i>," by Arnaud de Carcasse, a whimsical
licentious ballad, sufficiently popular
then, and ending with repeating in a kind
of recitative, and with much action, the
<i>novel</i> of Peter Vidal; perhaps the most
poetical and chivalric of all the productions
of the troubadours. The queen, whose
associations were easily excited, and whom
neither terror nor peril could deafen against
the voice of music and the force of dramatic
action, applauded loudly; though sometimes,
when her eye fell on the calm agony of
Genevieve's expression, she sighed deeply,
and, affecting to wipe the tears of laughter,
felt they sprang from another source that
almost froze them as they fell. Recovering herself,
she cried, "Gramercy, fellow; thou hast
pleased us well; and we would not willingly,
during our short and enforced sojourn here,

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

exchange thee for any other gaoler the walls
of thy proud master hold."&mdash;"Royal dame,"
said Hugues emboldened by wine, and the
malignity of his conscious power bursting
forth uncontrolled,&mdash;"royal dame, with all
due humility, I do believe thou wilt have
reason (I say it without self-flattery)&mdash;to
regret, when some sudden chance may cause
thee to exchange thy present warder for
another." The queen, who comprehended the
full meaning of these words, fell backwards
in her chair. Genevieve saw and felt the
peril of the moment: "Trust me, madame,"
she cried, "thy warder loves music, however
rudely touched or chanted: he hath lingered
to hear my rude song, and would, if your
grace so please, I might sing it again!"&mdash;Hugues,
elated beyond himself, exclaimed,
"An' if the queen will crown her grace to
me to-night, she will demand of that damsel a
single song."&mdash;"Sing, then, damsel, we command
thee," said the queen: whom a glance
from Genevieve had taught to give the air of
command to an act of necessity. "So please
you," said Genevieve, trembling at the temerity

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

of her experiment, "I have little skill
to sing, but, if Hugues will fetch from my
chamber the lute he hath lent me, I will
essay mine utmost to please the royal ear."
Hugues with delight accepted the commission,
and departed instantly.</p>

<p>The queen and Genevieve were left alone.
"We have a moment allowed us: examine
the goblet, royal lady," cried Genevieve. The
queen shook her head. "Thou knowest not,"
she said, "the deep and deadly potency of
the draughts that they call soporific. I bear
about me a charmed ring&mdash;a mighty test of
what is sanative or mortal."&mdash;"Apply the
test, apply it without delay," cried Genevieve.
The queen drew a ring from her
finger,&mdash;"if," she said, "in this goblet there
be ingredients intended for mischievous or
mortal purpose, the metal will change its
hue, as I touch it with this gem." She applied
the ring, and the metal of the goblet
darkened all above the surface of the sparkling
wine. The queen fell back in speechless
horror, faintly uttering, "Twice have I
thus saved my hunted life: but <i>now</i>&mdash;"&mdash;"And

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

now shall it again be saved!" cried Genevieve
with zeal that made her tremble at
her own word and act&mdash;"I will exchange
the goblets. He is inflamed with much wine,
and will not note the change: urge him by
some playful challenge to drain the goblet on
his return; and for the rest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The steps of Hugues were heard: he
entered, and delivered the instrument
to Genevieve, with the flushed and triumphant
air of one who was at once the
master of his crimes and of his pleasures.
"Thou hast marred it in the carrying,"
said Genevieve, preluding on it to catch
his attention: "the strings are all discordant."
The exchange of the goblets had
been made in his absence, and the queen,
seemingly jealous of his attention to the
symphony, exclaimed&mdash;"With all thy boast
of loyalty to the liege lady of France, I will
wage this turquoise ring to the glass button
in thy cap, that thou wilt not quaff thy goblet
at a draught to her sudden deliverance from
thraldom!"&mdash;"Will your highness do me reason?"
replied Hugues, with inflamed visage

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

and broken articulation.&mdash;"Oh! deeply, to
such a pledge: doubt me not," said the
queen, slowly raising the goblet to her lips.&mdash;"Then
is thy turquoise but a lost turquoise,
liege lady," cried Hugues; "for I hold him
a coystrel and a craven, who would not drink
to a fair queen's pledge, till his brains turned
like the vanes on an abbey tower, and rung
like all its bells to boot!" and as he spoke, he
seized his goblet and sunk on his knees, the
queen bending on him looks fixed with
horror for the event, while Genevieve, long
accustomed to the suppression of emotion,
testified hers only by deathly paleness and
suspended respiration. But Hugues was
now beyond all thought of suspicion; he
raised the goblet to his lips, and drained it
at a draught.</p>

<p>The hollow sound from the cup marked
the engulfing of the last drop: and
he remained convulsed, without the power to
replace the cup on the table, or to rise from
his knees though he made many efforts to
do so, accompanied with a ghastly laugh of
impotent self-derision. Failing finally, he remained

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

before them a moment on his sinking
knees; his flushed features making fearful
contrast with the stony fixedness of his eyes;
then, so potent and profound was the effect
of the <i>mithridate</i>, compounded by the most
skilful chemist of that age, that he sunk
back on his knees, his head reclining against
the adjacent chair, still sensible, but wholly
powerless.</p>

<p>The queen, alike overcome by scenes of
terror, whether she was agent or spectatress,
fell back in her chair powerless as her persecutor;
and Genevieve, after vain attempts to
rouse her, felt that hers must be the dreadful
task to take the keys from the living and
struggling corse, who, though he expanded
his arms, groaned deeply, and gazed on her
with his glassy lifeless eyes, in full consciousness
of her purpose, had not the power to
prevent it. It was a task less terrible, but
more difficult, to rouse the queen; and it
was only by displaying the keys before
her eyes, that Genevieve awoke her to
a kind of stupefied recollection: her lips
opened, but not a feature in her face moved;

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

yet she spoke with a kind of rigid dignity,
half the result of paralysis, half of remembered
associations. She struck the keys as
they swung in Genevieve's hand. "I know
thee who thou art," she said; "thou art my
gaoler&mdash;thou comest to lead me to another
dungeon&mdash;but I must follow thee." And to
the astonishment of Genevieve, with moveless
features, and unmeaning but unerring steps,
she rose and walked to the door of the
apartment.</p>

<p>Genevieve in this last exigency availed
herself of an illusion, which, though
frightful to behold in its effects, she felt it
necessary to encourage&mdash;the safety of the
queen of France was in the hands of a female
peasant. She caught up the lamp and keys,
and passed quickly from the chamber, Ingelberg
following her in a state of preternatural
excitement. The precautions taken by Hugues
for a different purpose, had removed all the
attendants to a distance; even he who was
to have assisted in conveying the queen to her
prison had not arrived, as the success of
Genevieve's enterprise had anticipated the
hour of his appointment.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

<p>They descended the stairs unmolested and
unobserved, and Genevieve then perceiving a
low and open door, that seemed to lead to
the subterranean passages of the castle,
entered it with the feeling of one who has in
her desperate course neither guide nor choice.
She was right in her conjecture; it opened
on an inclined plane, which they traversed
for some time till it led them to a flight of
stone steps, of which their feeble light shewed
them neither the termination nor direction.
Genevieve, after a brief pause, began to descend:
the utmost caution was now necessary;
the steps were broken and unequal,
often interrupted by masses of stone that
seemed to have fallen from the arched roof
above. The roof itself, framed of unhewn
stone, was in many places so low she could
hardly crawl beneath it, drawing her companion
with cautious gentleness along; and
the torch, their only resource, struggling with
the subterranean damp and vapours, threw
out its flame far behind them, its sparks
hissing on the dank footing as they descended.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

<p>On the shaken mind of the queen, the
darkness, the solitude, and the slow progress
operated, however, favourably: she recovered
her reason, and recognized her companion;
but it was only to add to the distress of the
burthened and helpless Genevieve. Believing
herself at a sufficient distance to complain
in safety, she poured out her feelings without
constraint, and never spoke but to harass her
assistant with enquiries she could not answer,
lamentations she could not soothe, and
terrors she dared not herself bear the steady
view of. For the latter there appeared but too
much reason: the descent seemed endless,
for Genevieve knew not it penetrated even
below the moat of the castle. It did end,
however; and the wanderers beheld at its
foot a level path, but one that seemed of
darkness impenetrable and interminable.
They, nevertheless, advanced; when they
shortly found their escape checked by a sheet
of dark water, that, as it gleamed dimly
in the light of their dying torch, seemed indeed
like the gloomy stream sailed over "by
that grim ferryman the poets speak of."&mdash;As

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

they approached, however, it appeared to
be a collection formed by the perpetual droppings
from the arch above. They waded
through it, and at the end of their progress
found themselves in an apartment, long, narrow,
and lofty, formed, like the passages, of
rugged stone, and traversed crosswise by a low
wall or screen which opened in the centre,
and whose top was fortified with strong pointed
iron spikes. Genevieve pushed it open, and
when they had thus gained the interior division
of the dungeon, she eagerly applied the key
she had taken from Hugues to a lock she perceived
on the inside of the screen. It turned
in the massive wards&mdash;instinctively she locked
and double locked it, and then placing her
torch in an iron socket, she paused for a moment's
breath and courage to enable her to
examine this chamber of death. In the compartment
they were in, her eye rested on nothing
but four low doors of iron which she
doubted not led to remoter prisons, where the
victims of the bishop's passions or power were
conveyed never to return alive. She tried
them all&mdash;all were fast secured. Mute and

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

almost hopeless, she sunk back on a rude stone
bench, above which the torch was suspended,
and gazed around her, while the queen lay
helplessly on her bosom weeping like a child.</p>

<p>It is at such a moment that every effaced
or forgotten woe and terror presses back on
the mind; and memory, with cruel and busy
treachery, brings up all the past in aid of present
calamity. She thought of that night of
the subterranean escape from Carcassonne,
whose traces of terror were the first that had
been inscribed on her infant memory. She
recalled the madding multitude ghastly with
famine&mdash;the midnight shrieks&mdash;the plunge&mdash;the
dark and perilous procession&mdash;the heat,
the crush, the press, the struggle for life&mdash;for
life, when children trod over their fallen
parents, and mothers left their infants! She
clasped her hands over her temples to preserve
her reason, but loosed them in a moment,
and bent eagerly forward. The suppressed
but busy hum of many voices reached
her ear from one of the doors, to which a key
seemed to be applying. She listened&mdash;it was
no delusion, her companion heard it too. "We

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

are betrayed," cried Ingelberg, with a shriek
that made the vaults re-echo, "We are pursued&mdash;we
are lost: God and St. Olave aid us
in this extremity!"&mdash;"Hush, hush, for Heaven's
sake!" cried Genevieve, trembling with
ecstasy, as she recognized the unforgotten
tones of Amirald amid the increasing murmur.
An unknown voice was then heard loudly
exclaiming, "By Heaven! lords, ye do me
wrong: this is the door, and if the key fail,
what hinders that ye break down the door
with what weapons ye have?"</p>

<p>"This passage leads right onward to the
queen's chamber and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"She is here&mdash;she
is here!" cried Genevieve.&mdash;"Oh!" she cried,
"as ye are true men, as ye are valiant knights,
force, force the door, the life of a royal queen
is in peril."&mdash;"In the name of Heaven," cried
the voice of Amirald, "by what chance?"&mdash;"Seek
not to know&mdash;stay not to ask," cried
Genevieve, "bring axe and lever and force
the door on the instant&mdash;the life of the queen
hangs on a moment."</p>

<p>At the word, twenty battle-axes began
to ring like thunder on the door, while the

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

attendants put all their strength to the task,
sawing away the bolts, and thrusting their
lance-points between the crevices, to loosen
and widen the apertures. The din was
enough to "stun the living and waken the
dead;" but louder still were heard the exulting
shrieks and agonizing vows of Ingelberg
to every saint in heaven, but chiefly to St.
Olave, for protection and deliverance. There
was need of them now; for at this moment
Sir Ambrose, at the head of half the household,
furnished with arms and torches, rushed
in at the opposite end of the vault.</p>

<p>The noise at the door, and the sight
of the queen and Genevieve gave him in a
moment to understand all that he had
to fear; and his rage was increased almost
to distraction, when he found that the iron
screen, which Genevieve had locked on the
inside, formed an impenetrable barrier between
him and his victims. While some
ran hastily for instruments to force it, and
others followed them to shun his fury, the
priest fiercely required some of the attendants
to clear the screen at a bound and seize

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

on the prisoners. The most active, hoping
an ample reward, instantly obeyed him. He
cleared the screen; but his feet slipping on
the damp pavement, he fell, and breaking
his leg, lay writhing impotently, and shaking
his hand at his intended victims. Another,
undeterred by this mischance, made the
attempt; but his mantle catching in one of
the spikes dragged him back on it, and he
hung there till lifted off, bleeding and lacerated,
by his companions.</p>

<p>The door began to give way. "Draw
thy bow," said the priest in fury to an archer
who stood by him, "and send me an arrow
through yon fugitive on the instant!"&mdash;"I
am not used to draw a bow against women!"
answered the man sullenly.&mdash;"Slave and
dog!" cried the furious priest, "do as thou
art commanded, or I will have thee hung
from the highest tower of the castle for the
vultures to devour thy flesh, and the hooded
crows to peck out thine eyes&mdash;alive&mdash;villain!&mdash;alive!"</p>

<p>The man slowly and reluctantly fitted the
arrow to the string. "Whom must I aim

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

at?" said he: "there be two of them, and
foul wrong it were if the innocent should
suffer."</p>

<p>"I am Ingelberg, the queen of France!"
cried Genevieve, presenting herself to the
mark of the assailant. As she spoke, the
arrow quivered in her side, and she fell,
bathed in blood, at the feet of Ingelberg.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE first beginnings of recovered consciousness
were, to Genevieve, accompanied
by exquisite pain and a gloomy confusion of
ideas. As her fleeting senses returned, she
perceived herself to be in a kind of litter,
which however did not move; she felt also
that her wound had been bound up; and
after some vain and painful efforts to recollect
how she had been wounded, or why
she was thus confined, she slowly drew back
the curtain of the litter, and attempted to
revive her dim perceptions by the sight of
surrounding objects. The night-breeze thus
admitted, though it chilled her frame, restored
her faculties, and she began to comprehend

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

her situation, which, though one
of comparative safety, seemed still full of
"doubt and dread."</p>

<p>The night was rough and stormy; masses
of hurrying rack were driven fast across the
moon, which, emerging from time to time,
shed her full brief light on the group that
surrounded the litter. Queen Ingelberg was
in the centre, mounted on a noble steed,
which she managed with a skill and spirit,
that was more the result of habitual, than
of native courage. She was surrounded by
a band of armed knights on their war-steeds;
and their steely forms now gleaming
out in the broad moonlight, and now
enveloped in darkness, gave a shadowy and
spectre-like hue to their figures and movements.
The bishop's castle, like a huge
pile of rock, stood darkling in the distance;
but the lights that flashed fast through every
loophole, the torches in the court that threw
their sheets of vivid and abrupt light on the
massive towers, and the increasing tramp
and din within the walls, as the men-at-arms
rushed to the sally-port, proved that the

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

alarm had been given, and that the fugitives
must owe their safety to speedy measures.
They appeared to be holding eager and
anxious consultation. "Take counsel for
the wounded maiden first," were the first
words that reached the ears of Genevieve;
(it was the voice of Ingelberg.) "Take counsel,
I say, first for the wounded maiden:
if to you we owe our liberty, to her we
first owed our life." Touched and melted
by this grateful magnanimity, Genevieve
drew the curtain wholly aside, and exerting
her utmost strength, cried, "Set forward,
noble knights, without delay: leave&mdash;leave
me here. What is the life of a peasant
damsel, weighed against the safety of a
crowned queen?"&mdash;"We are, indeed, crowned
queen," said Ingelberg, riding to her side.
"But thou, methinks, wast born one. Now
by the soul of Waldemar, and the bones of
blessed St. Olave, we stir not from this spot,
till thy safety be cared for."&mdash;"Your grace
lacks swift counsel in this strait," said
Bernard de Vaugelas, who rode close beside
her rein. "An' if I may guess by the sound

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

within yon towers, short space will be allowed
to give or take it."&mdash;"What if we
ride through the streets of Beaucaire, and
raise the townsmen in aid of the queen of
France," said Pierre de Limosin. " 'Twill be
the first time in their lives the <i>rascaille</i>
were ever honoured by the summons of a
knight, or the suit of a lady."&mdash;"The bishop
would strait despoil the town of its privileges,"
said Vaugelas, "if one of his vile
burghers wielded a bill, or shook a rusty target
on our side."&mdash;"There is a convent," said
a voice which thrilled through every fibre of
Genevieve's frame, "a sisterhood of holy
nuns not far distant: there may her Grace
take sanctuary, were the foul fiend chafing
at the grate."&mdash;"To sanctuary then a' God's
name, and with what speed ye may!" quoth
de Vaugelas, closing the rivets of his helmet.
"Hardly may De Limosin and myself, with
our train, stem the torrent that will soon
pour from yon barbican."&mdash;"Alas!" cried
the queen, dropping her reins, "must my
safety again be purchased at a price so
dear? Hear me, Bernard de Vaugelas, if

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

as a queen I can no longer command, as a
lady and most distressed I will not plead in
vain to a loyal knight."&mdash;"My liege lady," said
Vaugelas with the proud gallantry of chivalry,
"honour your slave in your most generous
thought so far as to believe him one who is
not content alone to shiver a lance, or trill
the lay of a wanton troubadour: no, on this
spot to-night he will leave bloody proof
that the sovereign of his heart was also the
lady of his life."&mdash;"I cannot fashion to set
my words in such fair order," said the less
polished De Limosin, couching his lance,
"but, royal dame, I too <i>can die</i>." Their
train gathered round the devoted knights.
"Ah, C&oelig;ur d'Acier! ah, Bel-et-brave!" cried
the queen vainly addressing each by the <i>nom
de caresse</i> she had bestowed on them in days
of chivalric splendour and regal festivity&mdash;"did
ye not swear to me on the faith of
knighthood, that ye would refuse me no boon
demanded in those names?"&mdash;"Sir Amirald,"
said De Vaugelas, in a low voice, "by thy
lady's love, and as thou wouldst have the
benison of thy saint in thy mortal hour, convey

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

the queen to safety: hark! they are
lowering the drawbridge."&mdash;"Farewell, my
liege!" cried De Limosin, "one tear for my
tomb, and one mass for my soul, is all thy
loyal lover now can crave."&mdash;"No tears for me,
my sovereign dame!" said the courtly Vaugelas:
"my soul would be sad in paradise, if
I thought my lady wept."&mdash;"Farewell, ye
priceless friends!" cried the queen in tears,
as she turned her reins to ride:&mdash;"alas! the
dark stream that I saw in my vision, was it
to foretell me this?"</p>

<p>The train set forward at the command
of Vaugelas, and in the pain produced by
the motion of the rudely constructed litter,
Genevieve soon lost all consciousness, and
with it all the perils of her flight and the
tumult of the conflict, whose sounds of
terror pursued them for miles beyond the
walls of the castle, where the safety of the
queen was fiercely contended for by Vaugelas
and Limosin.</p>

<p>By the light of the grey dawn, the fugitives
found themselves in a narrow valley of
considerable extent, bearing the same proportion

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

to a champaign landscape, that a long
gallery or passage does to the more spacious
and splendid apartments of the mansion, yet
not without its grace as well as its utility.
A small stream wandered through it; its
high precipitous banks of stone, like proud
neighbours, overshadowing and almost concealing
it; between their fissures many a tree
was bending its branches, and interlacing its
knotted roots&mdash;the boughs of some almost met
over the narrow stream, and those of others
closed around the low roofs of a small religious
edifice dimly seen at the extremity of
the valley. The objects thus gradually and
partially developed partook of the character
of the light by which they were beheld;&mdash;all
was quiet, sombrous, and still. The travellers
urged on their weary steeds; and following
with difficulty a track, rather than a path,
that winding sometimes among rocks, and
sometimes through water, was always so
overshadowed by the branches of the trees,
that the riders were compelled to bend to
their horses' manes to pass through them, at

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

length they approached the building as the
last toll of a faint bell summoned its inmates
to matins.</p>

<p>The building itself, simple almost to meanness,
and nearly hidden among trees and
rocks, gave no unapt image of an eremite
amid his shades and solitude, humble, lonely,
and sequestered. The unusual summons of a
bugle at their peaceful gates brought, not only
the portress, but the abbess to the portal; the
former held a feeble taper&mdash;for it was still
twilight; the figure of the latter appeared
faintly in the rear. "Shelter and sanctuary,
holy mother, for a forlorn wanderer!" cried
Ingelberg, "for one who flies in peril
through the land of which she is the queen."&mdash;"And
thou shalt have it, royal daughter!"
said the abbess, flinging her veil over the
head of the queen with a solemn air of protection,
"were all the kings in Christentye
thundering at this feeble gate for entrance.
Enter in safety and peace; and, for thou
knowest," she added viewing Ingelberg's
escort, "the strict rule of our order forbids
the approach of man nearer than our grate,

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

yonder knight with his train may harbour
in a near hamlet." As she spoke, Sir Amirald
had alighted and knelt to the queen, who extended
to him her hand to kiss&mdash;"Pardon,
my sovereign lady!" he cried: "my duty is
fulfilled, and my task finished here. I left a
pledge beneath the towers of the Bishop of
Toulouse, and must redeem it or give life in
exchange."&mdash;"I know thy meaning," said Ingelberg;
"and wilt thou, then, for some fantastic
toys of honour, desert thy queen and thy
duty? Are thy life, and the commands of thy
liege lady, of such light avail that a romantic
scruple can outweigh them both?"&mdash;"By a
true knight, royal dame," said Amirald, "his
life is ever held cheap, when poised with a
lady's commands; but both are underpriced
when weighed with that which alone gives
to life its value, or to a lady's commands the
right to be obeyed&mdash;even his honour:" and as
he spoke he flung himself on his war-steed.&mdash;"Am
I the Queen of France?" cried Ingelberg;
"am I she at whose lightest word the brands
of a thousand knights have leaped, as alive,
from their sheaths, and who now am denied

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

boon by one?"&mdash;"Detain him&mdash;Oh, detain him
yet, sovereign lady," cried Genevieve. At
the well-remembered voice Amirald rode
round to the litter, and withdrawing the curtain,
gazed on her for a moment&mdash;"Now were
my dishonour complete," he cried, "were it
beheld not only by the sovereign of my life,
but the lady of my love;" and as he spoke, he
hotly pursued his way back to the castle of
Beaucaire.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THOUGH Genevieve's wound, on examination,
proved so slight that it was obvious the
archer had purposely consulted her safety
while he gave it, the tenderness of the queen
would not suffer her for some days to quit her
cell or her pallet. This interval she passed
almost in utter solitude; for Ingelberg, exhausted
by fatigue and emotion, remained in
her apartment; and the nuns, when they had
discovered that their guest was a heretic,
(from her possessing neither cross nor rosary
and making no use of holy water) took care
to remain no longer near her than was necessary
for dressing her wound and supplying
her with food. This solitude was as delicious

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

to her as it was dangerous. Even amid suffering
and peril the images of both had been
effaced by the parting exclamation of Amirald;
and now, in the stillness and repose of
her cell, her mental eye rested with unwearied
luxury of gaze on the bright scenes of its internal
and new-found world of felicity. From
the moment that she had felt that compassion
for a wounded and deserted youth was rapidly
exchanging for a sensation new, indefinable,
and tumultuous, she guarded her heart
against his image with a vigilance and firmness
that suffered itself neither to be surprised
nor seduced into admitting its approach for a
moment. The insurmountable inequalities of
rank and of religion, of station and habit, helped
to sustain her fortitude, and aid her in the
discipline of her heart; and though she could not
make it cease to feel without making it cease
to beat, yet so closely was its secret guarded
that the only indications of its existence were
an increasing indifference to all that had interested
her before, and sometimes a sigh, for
which she condemned herself the moment it
was breathed. But Amirald's proclaiming her
with his own lips the lady of his love (a term

<!-- vol 3 page 297 -->

much more significant in those days than ours)
had now alike banished doubt and constraint;
and though she deemed the obstacles to happiness
or even to hope, as impracticable as
ever, yet still by the deep delusions of passion,
all felicity seemed comprehended in the
consciousness of its mere existence; and
the image of him she loved seemed sufficient
for the occupation of her heart during
the whole period of after-life. "Years
hence," she thought, "those who see me shall
say, 'Why does that pale maiden sigh when
she sees a noble knight ride past?' but none
shall be able to answer."</p>

<p>It was on the third evening after her arrival
at the convent that the queen and Genevieve
joined the nuns at the hour of supper.
In the refectory and its furniture, as well as
in the appearance of the group that occupied
it, there was a tone of severity exceeding
the usual rigour of conventual discipline,
and which displayed a striking contrast to
the gorgeous garments of the queen and
her companion. The walls were of stone;
a stone bench, extending the length of one
of them, formed a seat; a coarse table,

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

an iron lamp suspended from the ceiling, and
a massive and grotesquely carved chair, with
a wooden footstool, resigned by the abbess to
the queen, formed all the furniture. As the
rules of the community prohibited even the
<i>sight</i> of meat at their board, the queen's repast
was fish, an egg, and honey; and her
beverage water. Genevieve partook of its
remains, while the food of the abbess and
nuns was roots which they had themselves
reared and prepared; and they partook sparingly
of the pure element with which the
coarse cup of wood in the centre of the table
was filled. The silent meal concluded, the
nuns retired, and the queen began to converse
in a low voice with the abbess. The
countenance and expression of the latter riveted
Genevieve's eyes as she stood reverently behind
the chair of the queen. The
visages of the poor nuns had exhibited nothing
beyond gloom and apathy, graduated according
to the various lengths of their experience
of a conventual existence, and the variety
of temperaments on which that experience
had to operate; but the features of the abbess

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

wore that singular character of the expression
of youth mingled with the lines of
age, which marks countenances where grief
has been anticipating the work of time.
The lustre of her full dark eye was unimpaired,
and the noble regularity of her profile
still possessed and proclaimed the high
intellectual character associated with that
class of features; but her cheeks were wan
and hollow; and as a few locks (which she
hastily replaced) strayed from beneath her
frontlet or her veil, the grey far outnumbered
the black hairs&mdash;once blacker than the
raven's plume. Genevieve gazed intently on
her most interesting aspect, while the queen
continued conversing rather <i>to</i> than <i>with</i> her,
and the abbess telling her beads the while,
listened with the air of one whose mind was
wandering far both from her companion and
her occupation. "Yes, my reverend mother,"
said the queen, "it was within these
walls I was confined by order of King Philip,<sup id="ref035"><a href="#en035">35</a></sup>
while the cruel and unfounded process

<!-- vol 3 page 300 -->

for our divorce was carried on, spite of the
authority of the Pope and the menaces of my
brother, king Canute of Denmark; and here,
in place of a stern monastic gaoler, I met one
who, amid the chill of a cloister, had yet a
pang for insulted royalty and a tear for injured
love."&mdash;"It was my duty," said the
abbess: "<i>haud ignara mali</i>," she added, with
a painful smile: then checking herself, "I
forgot that I had abjured all my profaner
studies."&mdash;"And reverend mother," said the
queen, "deem you not that, when certain
agents have been employed in the ordering of
matters fairly and fortunately to our wish, and
such agents again surround us, bearing in the
time and all other circumstance of their appearing
a meet proportion to their former relation,
that it is a kind of augury&mdash;a betokening&mdash;How
shall I term it?&mdash;mine heart feels
the meaning, though my lips can frame no word
for it."&mdash;The abbess replied "that it might be
so; but that it was dangerous to build too
close analogies on the mysterious and far-reaching
dispensations of Providence."&mdash;"Here
are we," said the queen, explaining herself
by facts, "under the very roof where we

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

first tasted the offices of sisterly and Christian
love: and hither were we led in safety by
that Sir Amirald, to whom, at the time of
which we speak, we owed our honour and our
crown as by a miracle!"&mdash;"A miracle!" repeated
the abbess, raising her eyes.&mdash;"It
seemed no less," said the queen<sup id="ref036"><a href="#en036">36</a></sup>; "for when
the pleadings for my divorce were held before
the Pope's legate, under the roof of the Bishop
of Paris, and the advocates of the king
urged their reasons with such force and
sharpness, that when the crier proclaimed
'let the queen's advocates come forth,' none
appeared in answer, then stepped there forth
an unknown youth in our cause, who ordered
his reasons with such sententious and
weighty wisdom, and a gravity so learned
and modest withal, that the king himself, as
one amazed, put a stop to the pleadings, and
we were saved from disgrace and defeat,
at least on that day; but when the king
caused search to be made for the advocate,

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

no man knew aught of him, nor did
we till lately learn that it was this Sir
Amirald, who, though he thought no scorn
to take on him the office of advocate
for a distressed queen, yet would not have
it known, as less befitting a knight than a
cowled churchman or coifed son of peace;
but&mdash;mercy of Heaven! whence was that
din?" she exclaimed;&mdash;"one at the portal
seeks entrance."&mdash;"No horn hangs at our
peaceful gates," replied the abbess; and as she
spoke the ancient portress appeared.&mdash;"An
armed knight is at the gate," said she, "seeking
to speak with the queen."&mdash;"What is
his name?"&mdash;"I know not, madame."&mdash;"His
cognizance?" demanded the queen.&mdash;"Alas!"
said the poor recluse, "he looked so bright
and terrible in his armour, that I hasted
away; but his voice was like that of the
young knight who rode beside your highness
that morn."&mdash;"Sir Amirald!" cried the queen
exultingly. "Now by the soul of Waldemar<sup id="ref037"><a href="#en037">37</a></sup>,
there be hopes;" and hurrying Genevieve

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

along with her, they presented themselves
at the grate; and never in the wide
luxury of a veranda'd casement did beauty
look so interesting as through the rude and
narrow grate of a convent. The hardness of
the frame augments while it contrasts the
loveliness of the portraits which it encloses.
Sir Amirald dismounted, and kneeling on one
knee, gracefully doffed his casque to salute
the queen, while his eyes were fixed on Genevieve
alone. "Now, thou truant knight,"
said Ingelberg, "how darest thou venture
into the presence of a queen thou hast so
lately disobeyed and deserted?"&mdash;"So please
you, royal dame," said Amirald, the brightest
suffusion of joy dyeing his cheek and brow
with vermilion, "the tidings I bear embolden
me to press into your presence, were my fact
even more heinous."&mdash;"Now, Heaven! if it
be thy will&mdash;Bernard de Vaugelas and"&mdash;&mdash;"Are
living men, and still bear stout heart
and strong lance for the service of the queen."&mdash;Ingelberg
with devout gratitude began to tell
her beads: "And better thus employed," she
cried, "than in causing masses to be said for

<!-- vol 3 page 304 -->

their souls. But haste thee and tell me."&mdash;"They
were made prisoners by the bishop's
men; and being lodged in the same tower,
and waited on by one who had been about
your highness's person during your thraldom,
and who feared that the bishop on his return
would take his life, he contrived a means of
escape on condition he might accompany
them; and now have they reached the vicinage
without discovery or pursuit, purporting to
join you to-morrow in your meditated flight,
should you still," he added, with a peculiar
expression, "mean to pursue it."&mdash;"To-night,
to-night," cried the impatient queen;
"this very night will I set forth. The bishop
may pursue&mdash;king Philip may discover my
course; a lost hour is perchance the loss of
liberty&mdash;of"&mdash;&mdash;"Your grace does not lack
their aid to win your liberty," said Amirald,
his countenance assuming increasing resplendency
of colour and expression; "it is
achieved already. The remonstrances of the
Holy Father, and the repinings of Agnes of
Moravia, have changed the heart of king
Philip:&mdash;he waits to welcome you again as

<!-- vol 3 page 305 -->

his spouse and queen. The pope for this
concession legitimates the children of Agnes.
All is at peace between the Louvre and the
Vatican; and your faithful knights, instead of
aiding the flight of a fugitive, will now grace
the progress of a glorious queen, returning to
dwell among princes and palaces."&mdash;"It is
too much happiness," said the queen faintly,
while, giving him her hand through the grate
to kiss, she leaned back exhausted on the
shoulder of Genevieve then suddenly relapsing
into suspicion and fear&mdash;those habitual
guests that do not soon forbear the mansion
they have begun to inhabit&mdash;"And how,"
she cried, "does this suit the tidings we have
heard, that our son prince Lewis is leading a
strong force in aid of the Crusaders, whilst
king Philip never advanced mark or man before
in the cause? And must it not be on
the sad condition that I shall be the thrall of
the Bishop of Toulouse?"&mdash;"By all the saints&mdash;by
all and aught that knight or Christian
may swear by," said Amirald, his features on
fire with the earnestness of that conviction he
felt, and, feeling, impressed on his hearer, "the

<!-- vol 3 page 306 -->

tidings I bear are mere truth. Ask Bernard
de Vaugelas else. Prince Lewis at the
head of a strong band will not lightly
be won to quit his post. Nay, royal
dame, image to thyself a valiant prince
at the head of a host he was panting to
lead,&mdash;would he be checked in his course
of chivalry and conquest by the long-suspended,
and often-contradicted commands of
the King of France?"&mdash;"Thou persuadest me
to hope even against hope!" said the queen,
"and I will believe thee. Now, whom,"
she cried, in the natural effusion of a beneficent
heart, "whom shall I make happy?
Kingdoms would I give at this moment, were
kingdoms in my gift! By the rights of our
recovered queendom we will not leave this
spot, till thou, loyal knight, and thou, loving
damsel, have asked and won a boon worthy
of a sovereign to bestow."&mdash;"Sovereigns can
bestow honour," said Amirald, faltering and
blushing, "but love alone can give felicity."&mdash;"Ha!
goes it there," said the queen smilingly:
"Why god-a-mercy, boy, thou must have
a Belle-amie before thou hast a beard. I

<!-- vol 3 page 307 -->

think thy lips be as smooth as those of any
lady in our court. Well, when we win to Paris,
if this lady Guinever of thine refuse the intercession
of a queen, we will deem her lacking
in courtesy."&mdash;"She is not there," Amirald
was about to say, while his eyes fixed
on Genevieve were pleading still more eloquently;
but the queen, too happy to heed
him, had turned to her favourite. "For thee,"
she said, placing her hand on the brow of
Genevieve "for thee we will shape out a
noble fortune. Thou shalt with us to the
court; thy matchless beauty shall lack no
aid of rich attire, and ample dower; and the
proudest noble in king Philip's palace shall
not think scorn to mate with the peasant
maiden who saved the queen of France."&mdash;"Oh,
not to the court, my sovereign," replied
Genevieve, with deep but respectful firmness:&mdash;"not
to the court, if it please the queen?
I should deem it foul shame, if, while my
people eat the bread and drank the water
of affliction, I were dwelling in palaces. I
should be a mournful, ill-placed, abused thing!
Never&mdash;oh, never will I revel on dainties,

<!-- vol 3 page 308 -->

while they dig the earth for roots or eat the
grass of the field! Never will I be robed in
sinful and superfluous luxury, while they
shiver in cold and nakedness! Never will I
couch on down, while their bed is the rock;
and that pale sightless old man," she said,
with increasing emotion, "I should hear his
voice amid the music of a royal bower:
while I paced through palaces, he would tell
me he lacked a guide in the desert. Oh,
pardon, royal dame, if my words offend! but
never&mdash;never&mdash;" and the agonizing tears of
recollection burst forth and choked her voice.
Ingelberg was affected for a moment, then
struggling with feelings which her faith condemned&mdash;"We
have sworn deeply," she
said, "that we will not hence till thou
hast asked a boon; nor may the oath be
forfeited! Speak then, maiden, and remember
it is not easy to task the gratitude
of a friend, or the power of a sovereign."&mdash;"Royal
lady," said Genevieve, kneeling and
kissing her robe, "since He, in whose hand are
the hearts of kings, turned thine husband's
towards thee again, oh! win him to deal

<!-- vol 3 page 309 -->

gently with his suffering subjects. Trust me,
my liege, hearts more loyal beat not
in living bosoms; hands more bold never
wielded lance in fields of battle. Let our
liege but yield us the grace to worship
Him in whom we trust after the dictates
of our conscience and of his word,
and then shall our sovereign see, all through
fair Languedoc, every man sitting under
his vine and his olive, fearing God and honouring
the King." Queen Ingelberg shook
her head&mdash;"Thou proposest hard matter,
maiden," she said; "but, though it cost the
king's displeasure, I will not fail to redeem
my word. We will send holy priests, not
armed knights, to convert thine erring people;
and oh, that thou mayest be the first-fruits
of that milder mission!&mdash;and now," she
added cheerfully, "the queen hath a boon
to ask of thee. Wear this for my sake,"
she said, detaching a carkanet of jewels from
her neck, and fastening it round that of
Genevieve: "Now beshrew thee and thy
peevish heresy, that will not let thee visit
the court, were it but to show how well a

<!-- vol 3 page 310 -->

carkanet suits thy white and graceful neck.
I ask it not as a boon," she added more seriously,
"that thou wilt wear this ring of
small price," putting it on her finger; "it is
marked with my name, and thou wilt
prize it, not as the gift of the queen, but as
the memorial of Ingelberg."</p>

<p>At sight of the costly ornament of gems,
Genevieve burst into transports of grateful joy,
and the queen drew back disappointed and
displeased. "If we are to learn that thou
prizest such toys," she said, "we can enrich
thee, peasant, beyond thy wishes, yea thy very
dreams."&mdash;"Royal dame," said Genevieve, while
a proud but modest suffusion dyed her cheek,
"when thy vassal dies, those who are beside
her corse shall find this treasured ring next
her heart; but for these jewels&mdash;their price
is yet more precious to me. It shall procure a
guide for him from whom cruel men have
rent both his eyes and his child, whose aid
made him half forget their loss: yea, on thyself,
queen, shall the gift be visited in blessings.
It shall extort prayers for thee from
many a bleeding and many a broken heart.

<!-- vol 3 page 311 -->

They shall contend with and prevail against
the cries that arise hourly to the throne of
God against our slayers and persecutors.
For me," she added, repressing her enthusiasm,
"foul shame it were, if, while youth
and health remain, I sought subsistence from
the bounty that the weak and aged lack.
The labour of her own hands shall clothe
the peasant maiden with garments meet
for her, and God will give her food."</p>

<p>"Alas!" exclaimed the queen, kissing
her forehead with a sudden impulse
of admiring love&mdash;"Alas! that thou <i>wilt</i>
be a heretic but," she added, "in this
thy self-forgetfulness, order must be taken
for thee: whither wilt thou go, and what
is thy purpose?" Genevieve expressed her
humble wish to seek shelter with some
relatives in Toulouse; "And if I must weary
my liege for a boon," she added, "let me
have a safeguard thither, that I may meet no
hindrance or wrong."&mdash;"Sir Amirald himself,
with a chosen band of men-at-arms (maugre
all the crosses on their breasts), shall be thy
guide, thou false heretic," said the queen,
playfully entwining her fingers in Genevieve's

<!-- vol 3 page 312 -->

dark luxuriant ringlets as she
spoke:&mdash;"Will such guard content thee?"&mdash;Trembling
at the words, Genevieve felt
about to say "Aught of peril but <i>his</i> presence;"
but she checked herself, half from
awe of the presence in which she stood,
half from an internal yielding, which
she condemned while she submitted to it;
and murmured, "It must be as the queen
and the noble knight shall will it."&mdash;"As
the noble knight shall will it? as the queen
commands," said Ingelberg resuming rapidly
the language of royalty. "Sir Amirald, we
command thee to guard this fair damsel
where she listeth; but look that thou convert
her by the way," she added smiling.
"And now meseems that errand is not all
unwelcome: there was a gleam on thy
features like summer lightning, as I spoke."
The young lover bowed to hide his blushes
from the queen. "For thee, Amirald," said
Ingelberg, "we will ourself be the builder
of thy fortunes: trust our royal word, and
we will give thee solemn pledge for its redemption.
Hie, maiden, to the abbess, and

<!-- vol 3 page 313 -->

ask from her that priceless relique we consigned
to her care the night her walls first
sheltered us."</p>

<p>Genevieve soon returned with the abbess,
who placed the relique, enclosed in a small
box of silver, in the hands of the queen, and
then dropping her veil at the sight of a man
before the grate, stood apart. "Take this
relique," said the queen, attaching it to a
chain of gold: "it holds the holy dust
gathered from the bones of the Protomartyr,
who perished at Jerusalem under the hands of
his fierce and bloody countrymen. Why lingerest
thou? Seekest thou aught more from
us?"&mdash;"Beyond all that pilgrim or palmer
ever bore from holy land," said the young
knight, blushing as he knelt, "would I prize
the silken band that binds yon maiden's
hair."&mdash;"A silken band!" said the queen,
"nay, we will give with that a lock of the
silken hair it entwines."</p>

<p>Genevieve did not presume to resist, while
the queen with her own hands cut off a lock
of hair as rich as ever crowned the head of
regal beauty. "Now," said the queen,

<!-- vol 3 page 314 -->

"yield him thy white hand to kiss." Genevieve
retreated. "The noble knight," she
said, "must not profane his lips on the
hand of a peasant maiden."&mdash;"When hath
he kissed a fairer in a royal bower?" said
Ingelberg, seizing her hand, and offering it
through the grate to Amirald. At this
moment the abbess wrapped her veil around
her, and retired. The movement was unobserved
by the rest; the queen triumphed
in the interchanged pledges of valour and
beauty, which revived all the associations
of her former chivalric and courtly existence.
The young knight trembled as he kissed the
white hand extended to him, as if it were
rather accorded to the command of the
queen, than the act of the possessor; and a
new and nameless sensation trembled through
the pure frame of Genevieve, when she
felt the soft lip of Amirald, for the first time,
touch and press her hand. "We are
wearied," said the queen, reclining on the
shoulder of Genevieve; "we are wearied,"
laughing and wiping away her tears, "with

<!-- vol 3 page 315 -->

excess of happiness; we will retire to our cell,
and pass the night in orisons to the saints
for our present felicity and our future hopes.
And oh," she said, "oh that thou couldst
share them!"</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>GENEVIEVE'S full heart felt its need of
orisons too; she trembled at the perils of her
situation, though it seemed now to embrace
all that was delightful to hope, or flattering
to love. The increasing tumult of her heart
began to terrify her, and she resolved to commune
with it in solitude, and, if she could, to
bid it be still.</p>

<p>After attending the queen to her oratory,
Genevieve, with that impulse caught from
her early habits, which prompted her ever to

<!-- vol 3 page 317 -->

pour forth her prayers, when she could, amid
the liberty of nature and the light of heaven,
hasted to the garden of the convent. The
enclosure so called was of as simple and
austere a character as the fabric to which it
belonged; no flowers were cultivated there;
it contained only vegetables for the food
of the recluses, and vulnerary or sanative
herbs for the use of the sick and maimed
whom they tended; one broad and grassy
walk extended its entire length, lined on
either side by tall pines, whose branches, almost
meeting above, gave to the passenger
the idea of traversing a cloister. At the end
of this walk a hoarse and shallow stream
interrupted by its sole sound the deep repose
of the scene, its waters darkened by the
shade of the trees; on the bank was a rude
seat formed of the trunk of a fallen tree, a
similar block bore a human skull, and on the
surface of the wood these words had been
carved by the abbess, "<i>huc virgo veni, virgo
m&aelig;sta veni&mdash;hic umbr&aelig;, fontes, pax</i>."</p>

<p>The gloom, quiet, and repose of this spot,
over which the darkening shades of an

<!-- vol 3 page 318 -->

autumnal twilight began to gather, were
grateful to the harassed spirit of Genevieve:
she moved slowly and in silence among the
trees, with eyes upturned, watching the
decreasing light as it gleamed between their
branches; and it was not till she reached
the termination of the walk, that she perceived
the abbess seated and gazing upwards,
while the tears came slowly down her pale
cheek. Genevieve was retreating, with a
timid apology for her intrusion, when the
abbess caught her arm, and with silent emphatic
gesture detained her. Genevieve, conscious
of the difference of their creeds, and
fearful of some proof of fruitless zeal, was
again attempting to retire, when the abbess,
pointing to her cell, signified her wish that
Genevieve should follow her thither; she
obeyed, and on their entering it, the abbess
closed the door, and gazed on her for some
moments in silence; at length, "Thou
lovest," she said. Genevieve was silent.&mdash;The
abbess pointed emphatically to her own
pale cheek and wasted figure, "Behold,"
she said, "the fate of her who loves." And

<!-- vol 3 page 319 -->

in the long and melancholy conversation that
followed, she eloquently painted the progress
of that disastrous passion which bestowed on
its victims immortality and wretchedness.
At its close she read to Genevieve part of
a letter she had been writing, and of which
every page was blotted with her tears.</p>

<p>'Deum testem invoco, si Augustus universum
pr&aelig;sidens mundum, matrimonii honore
dignaretur, totumque mihi orbem confirmaret
in perpetuo pr&aelig;sidendum, charius
mihi ac dignius videretur, tua dici amica,<sup id="ref038"><a href="#en038">38</a></sup>
qu&agrave;m illius imperatrix.'&mdash;"Go, maiden,"
she said after reading these words, "and
when thou too weepest thy hopeless love,
remember the abbess Eloise, and the convent
of the Paraclete." She closed the scroll, and
she and her hearer remained mute for some
moments, the one from remembered, the other
from existing associations. They started
mutually at a sound seldom heard within
those walls till of late, a knocking at the
gate; the ancient portress tottered into the

<!-- vol 3 page 320 -->

chamber. "Who is he that would seek us?"
&mdash;"He calls himself the Monk of Montcalm,"
said the portress, "and he saith he hath
heavy tidings to utter."&mdash;"He is a gracious
and a holy man," said the abbess; say we
will see him on the instant."&mdash;"Stay thee,
maiden," she added to Genevieve as the
sandals of the aged monk were heard in the
passage to the apartment of the abbess. His
pale, ascetic, almost spiritualized form appeared
at the low and narrow door of the chamber.
The abbess rose as the portress held a dim
light beneath the pointed arch of the door,
and the conventual salutation of <i>Benedicite</i>
and <i>Pax vobiscum</i> passed between them.
"Reverend mother," said the monk, "I am
the bearer of tidings which, even in these
times of woe and fear, lack parallel."&mdash;"Such
tidings," said the abbess, "ever visit the
abode of grief&mdash;the messenger knows his way,
and chooses his fittest sojourn. But what are
thy tidings, holy monk?&mdash;It were a mournful
pleasure if an exhausted source could feel its
streams flow once more. I fear me there was
but one hand that could touch their spring&mdash;and

<!-- vol 3 page 321 -->

that&mdash;opened them once, and then they
closed for ever."&mdash;"Reverend dame," said the
monk, hasting to deliver his mission, "I
have journeyed to tell thee that, on to-morrow's
night the monks of holy St. John of
Beaucaire will sing a mass in the church of
Paraclete, for the soul of the lady Isabelle
of Courtenaye, who was murdered on her
bridal night by a hand unknown;&mdash;but not,"
he added, "unsuspected."</p>

<p>The abbess Eloise sat silent and horror-struck
at the tidings. "Where was the
bridegroom?" she said at length. The monk
crossed himself, and shuddered.&mdash;"Her uncle&mdash;her
kinsmen&mdash;her wooers?" repeated
Eloise. The monk prepared to answer; and as
he stood before the abbess, who was seated
and had placed the lamp far behind her,
so that only her features and form were
visible in dark profile, while the light fell full
on the pale features, naked feet, and withered
hands of the ascetic, which were clasped on
the staff he leant on&mdash;the dark drapery that
shrouded his form, all invisible in that dim
light&mdash;they appeared to Genevieve like a

<!-- vol 3 page 322 -->

being from the world of spirits, disclosing its
secrets to a summoning prophetess. "The
dark and bloody house of Courtenaye," he
said, "hath achieved its dark and bloody
destiny:&mdash;its wars and wrongs and ravages
have met their fearful consummation. Thou
knowest, reverend mother, the crimes of that
house of blood, and thou mayest, perchance,
have heard the dark prophecy of that Marie
de Mortemar, who had undergone such
wrong from them and their brothers in
arms, as Christian land never witnessed, and
Christian tongue cannot utter."&mdash;"I have
heard report," said the abbess, "that the
fiery arrow should pierce through the towers
of Courtenaye, but I knew not, or regarded
the import of these dark words."&mdash;"They
have been fulfilled," said the monk. "The
arrow hath prostrated the castle to its foundation-stone.
There was not a noble maid
in all France wooed far and near like the lady
of Courtenaye: but she rejected all in the
pride of her beauty, till among the Crusaders
there arrived at her castle a stranger, whom
men called Sir Paladour de la Croix Sanglante.

<!-- vol 3 page 323 -->

No one knew his birth, his kindred,
or descent; but there went a hushed and
mysterious whisper through the castle that
<i>he</i> was that visionary being&mdash;that spectre
bridegroom, who came to fulfil the fearful
prophecy. If he were such, never did Satan,
since his fall, clothe himself more like an angel
of light. I need not tell thee of the glorious
beauty of that faultless form," he said; "such
image should never visit the fancy of a holy
recluse."&mdash;"Thou needest not," said the abbess;
then averting her head, she murmured,&mdash;"Such
vision too oft haunts her dreams."&mdash;"There
was somewhat superhuman," said
the monk, "not only in his form, but in his
deeds. With more than mortal might he
confronted the Count de Montfort in the lists
in rescue of the lady Isabelle's lands and
person from the claim of King Philip&mdash;with
more than mortal might he contended in that
fierce and fruitless battle which the crusading
knights fought with the army of the Count of
Toulouse, at the mad instigation of Simon
de Montfort&mdash;with more than mortal arm did
he strive with the bold outlaw named L'Aigle

<!-- vol 3 page 324 -->

sur la Roche. The attendants of the lady
said that an unearthly figure aided him there
and struck a dagger into the outlaw's heart.
How it chanced I cannot tell: the tale was
rife in the mouths of the vassals when the
lady returned in safety; and she would prove
her love to him who had saved her from both,
and would wed him and make him lord of
her wide lands and countless dower. The
Lord of Courtenaye consented. I joined their
hands, but I swear to thee, reverend mother,
as I uttered the holy words of the sacrament
of marriage, I deemed that I joined the hand
of a marble statue to that of the bride; and
never from statue or portrait glared eyes so
fixed and lifeless as those of Sir Paladour. And,
on the bridal night, when some late revellers
still loitered in the hall, there was heard a
cry like that once heard in Egypt on her
night of doom. At the voice of that cry the
revellers started from their feast, and hasted
to the nuptial chamber; but death had been
already there&mdash;the bride lay a corse on the
bridal bed, her bosom streaming with blood.
No mortal weapon was in that chamber of

<!-- vol 3 page 325 -->

death. The bridegroom had departed, and
ere the cry of horror had well ceased, cries
louder and louder issued from a lower apartment, from the closed door of which flames
and shrieks came bursting forth together.
We hastened thither, and there was a scene
such as never was wrought by those profane
players in their painted passions and tragical
horrors. Smoke and sparks issued from the
door of the chamber, and its wretched inmate
was shrieking that he burned!&mdash;he
burned!&mdash;it was known on what task he
was employed; and that those who may
not be named within these walls were his
associates in his unutterable work. The door
was fast&mdash;the key lost&mdash;men wrought with
axe and crow, and the roof and ceiling was
broken up, and water poured on the flames;
but below as the waters hissed and sunk on
the embers of the burning chamber, mine
eyes beheld all the awful implements of that
dread and accursed work&mdash;the inverted cross,
the seething cauldron, the triangular stone
with its ghastly central gleam, magic-wrought,
and magic-bright, and blazing 'mid

<!-- vol 3 page 326 -->

all that conflagration; the abused relics of the
dead, skull and bone disposed in mockery,
flames of every colour, and the horrid crisped
lumps of ashes, which had been but a few moments
past the agents in that work. Whether
the flames that consumed them burst from
the unholy ingredients of their employ, or
were kindled by the dark and fiery spirits
who are mantled in them in their unfathomable
dwellings of torment and of flame, it
were alike impossible to tell and fearful to
conjecture." The monk paused; he dared
not tell that he himself had seen a hellish
form spring from beneath, seize the Lord of
Courtenaye, and plunge him yelling amid
the flames that closed round them both for
ever.</p>

<p>At the end of this awful communication,
the abbess, the monk, and Genevieve, remained
in deep silence. There is a species
of horror attached to certain narratives,
which, while it repels belief, forces conviction.
In such divided state of mind, though
from various causes, sat the party for one
fearful and silent hour. "Holy monk," said

<!-- vol 3 page 327 -->

the abbess, at length breaking silence, "wilt
thou not partake of such humble refection as
our cloister can offer?"&mdash;"I have tasted
bread and water thrice this day," said the
pale ascetic skeleton; "more than enough
for a mortal frame, that would not be bowed
down by carnal heaviness and pampered
sloth. The spirit's burthen is enough; let
us not add to it the weight of earthly indulgence
to damp the pinion, whose overburthened
flight will never soar heaven-ward."&mdash;"There
may be a heavier burthen on its
wings," sighed the abbess, as the monk retired
to pace his way to the monastery of
Beaucaire. "Now part we," she said to
Genevieve.&mdash;"Nay, let me watch with thee,
reverend lady," said Genevieve; "though I
must not mingle prayer with thee, perchance
mine aspirations may not pollute
the incense of the sacrifice?"&mdash;"It may not be
so," said Eloise. "Order must be taken in
the convent for the celebration of this bridal
hymn&mdash;this sepulchral dirge, I would say.
Alas!" she added, raising her eyes with an
expression of wild and profound melancholy,

<!-- vol 3 page 328 -->

"how many wandering thoughts beset me!"&mdash;then
suddenly, as talking to herself, "<i>She</i>
died blessedly by the hand of him she loved,&mdash;a
single, deep-dealt blow.&mdash;She had not
to linger for the heart-gnawing, cold, slow,
sedentary murderer, Grief."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she summoned a lay-sister,
to give order for the ceremony of
the night, and Genevieve retired to her
cell. She felt her need of profound rest
to prepare her for her early setting forth
with the queen on her journey, but she
knew not that an exhausted frame and an
excited mind are the most inveterate foes to
that rest which both require. She prayed
fervently, and slept soon, but not without
seeing, amid her devotions, and even after
she had closed her eyes, the pale form of the
victim-bride in every corner of her narrow
chamber. The visions that thus disturbed
her waking thoughts held increased power
over her slumbers, and in her dreams she
thought she was traversing a dark and
dreary mountain-path, at the extremity of
which a light was twinkling. This melancholy
reminiscence of her former existence

<!-- vol 3 page 329 -->

seemed like a renewal of it, and she wept as
she had done in her infant wanderings, weariness,
and peril. Suddenly she was alone&mdash;all
her companions appeared to have left her.
She dreamed that she approached the light
alone&mdash;it gleamed from a hole in a hovel.
She asked for admittance, and a hoarse voice
answered, "We are watching our dead."
She was at last admitted, and saw the corse
of a man extended on a bed, and a woman
watching beside it, whose face was concealed.
In a short time the woman retired, and the
corse rose upright, not at once, or suddenly,
but slowly and deliberately. It rose, quitted
the bed, and beckoned Genevieve to follow.
She followed in her dream, till they reached
a church-yard, where the ghastly figure
beckoned her onwards; she shuddered, and
retreated at that moment, he half unfolded
his shroud, as if in token of invitation. She
retreated faster; and the scene suddenly
changed to a splendid hall, such as her late
conversations with the queen had painted in
vivid colours on her imagination. The board
was spread with dainties, and surrounded by

<!-- vol 3 page 330 -->

nobles and beauties gorgeously attired. At
the head of the board sat Sir Amirald, and
beside him was placed an empty chair. He
looked pale and abstracted; but in a moment,
as he beheld Genevieve, his features were
flushed with the glow of passion and joy,
and he sprang forward to lead her to the
vacant seat.&mdash;At that moment, her late fearful
companion appeared close by her side, and
seized her hand, exclaiming, "Since you will
not come to meet me, I have come to meet
you." As the vision spoke, the shroud disappeared
from its form and features, and she
beheld the corse, for so it seemed, of Amand.
The touch of his hand at first seemed to burn
like fire&mdash;then it became colder than ice.&mdash;She
shrieked and awoke. It was not for
some time that she recovered her recollection,
and when she did, the objects by which
she was surrounded made her almost doubt
the evidence of her senses. She found herself
in an apartment of the convent larger
than she had yet beheld; some rude figures
of stone, ranged in niches along the walls,
and some still ruder attempts at ornament

<!-- vol 3 page 331 -->

in the roof, were dimly descried by the light
of two torches of black wax, that burned before
a painting obscure and hardly seen; opposite
to her was a hearse, with small black
banners at each corner, and covered with a
pall of black, on which was wrought a silver
crucifix. Her eyes at length rested on an
altar, from which the usual decorations of
flowers, vases, and embroidery were removed,
and which displayed only a crucifix of wood as
black as ebony. After gazing long on these
objects, her perceptions began to return, and
she comprehended her situation. She was
in the church of the Paraclete, furnished as
it was for the masses to be said for the soul
of the lady Isabelle; and she at once conceived
that she must have wandered there
in her sleep, a habit which the broken and
fearful slumbers of her childhood had induced,
and which had probably been renewed
by the terror and intensity of the images
that had troubled her dreams that night.
She arose, and looked round her, but no
longer with terror. A profound melancholy,
mingled with grief and awe, pervaded her

<!-- vol 3 page 332 -->

heart as she beheld these memorials of faded
loveliness and prostrate pride. From the
conversation of Eloise and the monk she
had learned, that the "lady of the cave,"
whom she encountered in her solitary wanderings,
and whose beauty and splendid
garb had, amid such a scene, made
her appear like a queen of Faerie, was
that lady Isabelle, whose surpassing beauty
she had beheld&mdash;whose obsequies she now
witnessed. "And art thou she?" Genevieve
exclaimed,&mdash;"art thou she who didst
pass all the daughters of men in beauty; who
sattest in thy pride of life so far above me,
that I deemed it almost an insult to grasp
thy garment's hem; yet to-night I might, unchidden,
touch thy shroud? Oh! how glorious
wast thou in thy loveliness! Yet thou
hast perished; and I love to linger on the
image of what thou wast&mdash;so beautiful,
proud, and yet gentle:&mdash;there was a trembling
loveliness about thee in thy haughtiest mood
and moment; and when thou seemedst to
offer protection to me, it was as if thou
seemedst to supplicate for thyself." Her eyes

<!-- vol 3 page 333 -->

again were fastened on the hearse with its
banners and blazon. She shuddered and
murmured&mdash;"And what avails this pageantry
of death? and oh, what availed the pageantry
of thy bridal, when nobles held thy rein and
their daughters bore thy train? And that
being, not of this world, flashing the light of
his demon-eyes on thee, and fixing in thy
bosom the fangs of murder!"</p>

<p>She cast back one involuntary glance on
the hearse as she retired&mdash;a spectacle was
there that nailed her to the spot where she
stood, and froze the blood in her veins.&mdash;The
figure of the departed stood by the hearse,
in form, stature, attitude as in life; but not
in hue or expression resembling aught that is
mortal:&mdash;it was folded in a shroud:&mdash;what
seemed its arms were clasped across its
bosom; and, though the face was visible, the
colourless and moveless features brought to
the memory of Genevieve such recollection of
the living as her image wrought in marble
would. Beauty was there; but it was a
beauty "not of this world"&mdash;the eyes alone
seemed gleaming with intense and supernatural

<!-- vol 3 page 334 -->

light; but they appeared fixed like
lamps in sockets of stone. So she stood, pale
in immortal beauty&mdash;blending the associations
of divided worlds, bearing the character of all
that is sad in the present, all that is awful
in the future. Genevieve's first impulse was
to fly; but her feet seemed rooted like those
of the apparition; and she stood struggling
but unable to move, as sufferers feel under
the influence of the night-mare. Then came
slowly on her that unutterable sensation
which those feel who believe themselves in
the presence of an inhabitant of the other
world&mdash;a sensation which almost assimilates
them to the awful being on whom they gaze,
in rigidity, coldness, and immobility. The
hair of her flesh stood up&mdash;every pore tingled
with distinct vitality&mdash;her eyes became, to
her own perception, glazed, though she retained
the full power of vision; the next moment
they were dilated beyond her power of
closing them; the figure appeared expanding
in dimensions and advancing on her. The
murmur that at first crept through her cold
ears, increased to the rushing of many waters&mdash;the

<!-- vol 3 page 335 -->

air became tremulous with a purple
light; her abortive attempt to shriek felt like
hands grasping her throat. The paroxysm of
horror suspended her faculties&mdash;her whole
body contracted, and she fell senseless on the
pavement.</p>

<p>THE bridal of Sir Paladour de la Croix
Sanglante and the lady Isabelle was held
with a magnificence suitable to the state and
wealth of the bride, and the merit and valour
of the bridegroom. After the marriage
ceremony, performed by the Monk of Montcalm,
there was a gorgeous feast; and then
the company assembled in the hall of the
castle to dance, the bride and bridegroom,
according to the custom of the times and
of many following, being the leaders in the

<!-- vol 4 page 2 -->

ball. The feudal hall presented a rude and
grand consistency:&mdash;the fire supplied with vast
blocks went roaring and blazing up the wide
and grateless chimney; the chimney-piece, a
noble work of antique art, adorned with rich
sculptures in wood of men and animals, demons
and saints, fruits and foliage, heraldic
emblems and sentences from Scripture,
wrought with rich and fantastic luxuriance
of ornament, rose like a monument to the
height of thirty feet; its stories (as they
might be called), with their entablatures and
flourishments, tapering as they ascended, till
the topmost carving almost touched the cornice
of the hall, loaded like it with heavy,
fantastic, but most rich sculpturing in wood,
"all made out of the carver's brain." There
was not, perhaps, a right angle in the walls
of the apartment; but, of its polygon figure,
every panel was either hung with rich tapestry,
or framed of wood so polished and
wrought, that the eye turned with delight
from gold and gaudy figures, to repose on
the dark hue and strong relief of the alternate
compartment.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 3 -->

<p>A "liveried army" of domestics, stationed
in recesses, held waxen torches, whose
light, like banners in a field, streamed forward
or backward with the movements of
the dancers and the impulse with which they
swayed the air; and those movements so
stately, yet so expressive&mdash;the sweeping robes
of the ladies, the gentle tread of the knights,
the sonorous rustle of the long-depending
garments on the inlaid floor, from which the
rushes had here and there been swept, mingled
with the clank of the small spurs which
their partners wore even on that occasion,
made meet accompaniment to the strains of
the minstrels; who leaned from their carved
and gilded gallery amid the pillars of the
lordly hall, to witness that luxury of motion
which they participated while they inspired.
And the vast uncurtained window, on whose
gorgeous and emblazoned panes the admitted
moon shed her full light, tinting them with
purple, vermillion, and gold, and then resting
in pale and placid glory on some uncoloured
pane, seemed to make heaven a joyous witness

<!-- vol 4 page 4 -->

of that festival: and within the deep recesses
of those windows, on high-piled and costly
cushions, sank beauty, panting from the delicious
exercise of the dance; while youthful
knights, "all on the wanton rushes laid them
down," and pointing to the felicity of Paladour
and Isabelle, did then most effectively plead for
the completion of their own: while, through
the low-arched doors that opened in sundry directions,
was often caught, by the light of
iron cressets, or the flash of torches borne by
passing domestics, the sight of the menials of
the household dancing in groups, to strains
more homely and with steps less graceful, but
with hearts as light as any in that gay assembly.</p>

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye, seated in his
chair of state, whispered courteous words
to every lady as she passed him in the dance.
The Monk of Montcalm, seated at a small
trivet, furnished with a basin of holy water,
with which he was to sprinkle the bridal-bed
that night, was conning over his night-spells
and benisons for the prosperity of the wedded
pair: beside him stood the lord's falconer, with

<!-- vol 4 page 5 -->

a hawk on his wrist, hooded to quell her
screams; and the lady Isabelle's huntsman
held a pair of snow-white hounds in a leash
of gold tissue, broidered with names of the
bride and bridegroom; and the all-licensed
fool made jests on the allusion, and shook
every bell on his cap in chorus to his own
drollery, and joyous burthen was borne by
the laugh of all the domestics, who that
night were not reproved for their mirth by
their lord. He was engaged with other
thought, for ever as he glanced towards the
Monk of Montcalm he muttered,&mdash;"Thou art
the master of a powerless spell: they whom
I rule have forespoken thee already."</p>

<p>The bride had danced one round, and was
seated in her chair of state, arrayed in cloth
of silver, and a transparent veil falling over
her lovely brow, as if to hide her from the
gaze of the throng. "It is she," they said,
"for whom Sir Paladour de la Croix Sanglante
challenged and overthrew Simon de
Montfort&mdash;him whom fifty lances had not
shaken in his saddle-seat in the lists that
day. It is she for whom he undertook and

<!-- vol 4 page 6 -->

accomplished the adventure against l'Aigle
sur la Roche, who never released prisoner
ransomless before."&mdash;"And right worthy,"
cried the knights, "was she of such valour."&mdash;"And
as worthy," rejoined the ladies, "he
of his reward." As they spoke, Sir Paladour,
taking a torch from one of the attendants,
offered his hand to the lady for another
round. "I challenge this fair prisoner,"
said he, pressing the hand she gave, "by the
golden fetters in which I bound it to-day;" and
he glanced with gay triumph on the marriage
ring. "That were easy," said the smiling
bride: "but oh, thou subtle enthraller! where
didst thou learn to bind the heart in such
fine fetters, that it cannot choose but quit its
home to dwell with thee, and delight itself
to dwell in such sweet prison ever?"&mdash;"There
is no shrine on earth," said the impassioned
bridegroom, "worthy of gem so rich. Το
look on thee, to listen to thee, to touch thy
hand, are several such delights, that it were
worth life's dearest peril to win but one of
them; but to think all these, and thyself the

<!-- vol 4 page 7 -->

sum of all, are mine, wraps me in too exquisite
a trance; and I fear," he added, darting
on her eyes, under whose vivid and melting
brilliancy her own sunk, "I fear I shall lose
all consciousness of my felicity from its very
excess."</p>

<p>At this moment a page approaching touched
his mantle and whispered some words
in his ear. "Go, boy," he said slightingly,
"this is no hour for such importunacy;" and
he led the lady as he spoke. The boy drew
nearer and put a ring into his hand:&mdash;the
glow that all that night had made his cheek
seem like a living rose, left it in a moment
as pale as that of the dead! He uttered some
inarticulate sounds; and then, whispering his
bride he would return on the instant, he
hurried from the hall. As he crossed the
threshold, he flung one unmarked look of
agony in the direction where she stood, and
disappeared. The lady, who had been employed
in lifting and arranging her veil for
the dance, heard his words, but saw not his
expression; and re-seating herself to await
his return, began to enter into gay talk with

<!-- vol 4 page 8 -->

her attendants. Suddenly she paused&mdash;"Do I
see between sleep and waking?" she said,
bending forward, "or is that my lord? Methinks
he looks wondrous wan!"</p>

<p>Sir Paladour was seen leaning against the
doorway, looking like any thing but a happy
bridegroom. The gaiety of the festal was
now on the decline; the cry through the hall
was, "It waxes late&mdash;the torches burn to
bedward." At the word the Lord of Courtenaye
rose from his chair, and six pages
arrayed in white detached themselves from
the dance, and seized torches to escort the
bridegroom. This movement, though it did
not disturb the dancers, caused some tumult
and press around the doorway, while all
waited for the train of ladies who were first
to escort the bride to her apartment.
Sir Paladour stood like a statue amid the
bridesmen, amongst whom some pleasantries
suited to those coarse but merry times
were passing, when Verac exclaimed,
"Hold thy torch aloft, boy! By Heaven, Sir
Paladour, thy cheek is as wan as that of

<!-- vol 4 page 9 -->

the dead!" "And is no cheek here but mine
pale?" said Paladour: "methinks thine is
pale, too, Verac, and thine, Semonville."
"The torches burn wondrous dim," said
many voices: the pages trimmed them in
vain. A blue pallid light diffused itself
through the hall, and the flushed cheek of
panting beauty paused from the dance,
and the young ruddy aspects of the gazing
pages were tinged with that pale and ghastly
hue at the same moment; while, amid the
vapour, the cressets and lamps waned in
light like moons in their eclipse. The darkness
increased, and the Lord of Courtenaye,
however he might hail the signal, called
aloud for fresh torches. The order was
obeyed, but the torches they produced,
lighted from those whose flame was so
strangely coloured, had a tint of the same
pale and portentous light.</p>

<p>At length the hall was cleared; the only
individuals left were the Lord of Courtenaye
and Thibaud: the former shewed some impatience
of this officious surveillance of his vassal&mdash;"Why

<!-- vol 4 page 10 -->

art thou here?" he said.&mdash;"Because,"
said the vassal, "I see thine eye is fixed,
and thy step pointed toward thy chamber
of crime and darkness; when in such emergency
didst thou say, 'why art thou here?' "&mdash;"I
lack not thy counsel, nor thy aid," said his
Lord: "begone, and trouble me not."&mdash;"Thus
says a sorcerer to an imp who can no longer
serve him," said Thibaud; "yet mark me,
lord," and with cold hand and visage pale
he approached the Lord of Courtenaye, and
grasped his shrinking shoulder&mdash;"mark me,
we met in mirth and wine to confer on thy
brother's murder&mdash;let that pass. I meant
not thou shouldst gnash and grin like a wolf
at the memory. Let us not part in sadness:
we must drain cups to deep pledges ere
we part," and he filled a vast cup to the
brim.&mdash;"God rid me of thee, thou insolent
knave!" said his lord.&mdash;"What sayest thou,
Lord of Courtenaye," quoth Thibaud, reeling,
but holding the cup straight, "deem'st thou
I am carousing to the bridal?&mdash;No; I will
name a health in which thou shalt pledge

<!-- vol 4 page 11 -->

me in thy soul&mdash;&mdash;if thou hast one. Here is
to the consummation of thy evil purposes!"
and he attempted to drain the cup in vain.
"Here is," he cried faintly, holding it to his
lips, "here is to the fiend and thee!" Then
after a deeper draught, "Here&mdash;here is to
that daughter of Satan that weds the Lord
of Courtenaye to-night in the vaults of his
castle, and I shall be the bridesman in flames,"
he repeated, draining the cup, "flames in my
throat&mdash;in my brain&mdash;in my heart. Am I
not thy meet bridesman, Lord of Courtenaye?"
and he fell prostrate on the floor, dashing
in his fall the cup far from him.</p>

<p>"Insensate, intoxicated brute!" said the Lord
of Courtenaye hasting from the hall, "and at
such a time!" And as he raised the tapestry
which led to the passage communicating
with his secret closet, the prostrate wretch,
raising his inflamed visage and blood-shot
eyes, like the face of a demon, once more
exclaimed, "flames&mdash;flames&mdash;in throat and
brain; but not in soul like thee, false, fiendish
lord!"</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 12 -->

<p>The Lord of Courtenaye stayed not to
listen to his ravings: he hastened to his secret
chamber, in the spirit of him who
said "Evil, be thou my good." The terrible
implements of the vault had all been removed
thither; there was the necromantic
altar-block of stone supporting a seething
cauldron, the triangular stone of black marble
on whose dark and polished surface a
light gleamed and disappeared successively
as the flame of the cauldron blazed and
sank&mdash;that flame was of the deepest blue;
there was no light in the chamber or closet,
but that which issued from the cauldron.</p>

<p>The light thus singularly diffused fell on as
singular a group. Three female forms, withered,
haggard, and decrepid, were gathered
round it. They were the same who had
before been assembled in the vault. One of
them kneeling, held open a parchment volume,
on which characters were inscribed in
red and black alternately. Right opposite,
another hag was seated on her hams, her
elbows resting on her knees, and her withered

<!-- vol 4 page 13 -->

knuckles locked in her jaws, while her
livid eyes and visage were now partially and
ghastlily seen by the light of the cauldron,
and then, as the gleam subsided, lost in
darkness. The third, crouching close to the
cauldron, flung in some ingredients, and
zealously pursued her task of stirring the
mixture. She was placed in such a position
with regard to the light, that her figure
was indefinable&mdash;her action only visible, as
her dark arm crossed the flame from time to
time.</p>

<p>"And thinkest thou," said she who pored
over the parchment leaves&mdash;"thinkest
thou she will fulfil her promise to-night?
and that she will shew to him that which she
hath promised?"&mdash;"Doubt it not," said the
other, without unlocking her contact of jaw
and knuckle. "Did she not bring us first
acquainted with the evil one? And if all be
true, the Lord of Courtenaye is meeter mate
for him than we."&mdash;"It glads me," said
the inferior agent, who stirred the cauldron,
"to see our mistress when she is wrought by

<!-- vol 4 page 14 -->

the passions of others, being passionless herself,
to do or to promise that which passes
earthly power. Then I feel she has a look
that may command the fiend&mdash;I feel that my
master may be my slave, if I had eye and
voice and step like&mdash;&mdash;Oh, she is awful in
her moment of power!"&mdash;"Awful she is,"
said the other, "but awful though she be,
she favours much one whom I remember
fair in her youth. I was fair myself&mdash;men
told me so; but age, and want, and the wish
of revenge without the power, have brought
me to what I am."&mdash;"But who was she?"
said her hearers eagerly.&mdash;"Put in more
nightshade and wolfsbane, and see that the
flame wane not."&mdash;"Tell us whom doth our
mistress resemble?"&mdash;"Even Marie de Mortemar,"
said the crone.&mdash;"And who was
she?" said the reader of the parchment,
dropping the scroll.&mdash;"She was a noble,
beautiful lady, heiress of Mortemar; and
methinks even yet our pale mistress hath her
falcon eye, her glorious port, her thrilling
voice; but it fared ill with her.&mdash;She was a

<!-- vol 4 page 15 -->

heretic; and worse, she would be a preacher&mdash;a
prophetess&mdash;she would be the <i>Virgin</i> of
the Albigenses. Her touch healed the sick&mdash;her
prayer suspended the avalanche in its
fall&mdash;her word raised the dead. She was
one, as I have heard, who could make a
heaven, herself being sole goddess; or turn
that heaven to hell. But lo, in the height of
her spiritual pride, there came against her
Count Raymond, then sworn brother to the
Lord of Courtenaye, the brother of him
whose hests we do, and the Bishop of Toulouse,
and they despoiled her of lands and
power, and burnt her castles, and made of
her people serfs, and misused her in such
sort, that she wandered a maniac for a time,
and then was heard of no more."&mdash;"And
fate too good for her," said she who stirred
the cauldron. "Was she not a heretic?
I thank kind stars," she muttered, pursuing
her task&mdash;"I thank kind stars, for
holier name must not be uttered here, that
witch as I am, I never was heretic, else may
these flames I am stirring consume me."&mdash;"And

<!-- vol 4 page 16 -->

how," said the mocking hag who
spoke last,&mdash;"how deemest thou thy lot better,
being a witch?"&mdash;"Because," said the
other, in the dreaming darkness of her intoxicated
existence, "I know not well whether
I be witch or no. I am as one between
the living world and that which lives not.&mdash;Sometimes
I think all a dream, and other
time I think all reality, and often I know
not what to think. I was promised wealth,
and power, and youth, yet am I poor, and
powerless, and withered. I banquet at gay
feasts, and wake famished. I see stores of
gold, and do the drudgery of a devil for a
liard."</p>

<p>"Hast thou had no hours of dark power and
fearful pleasure, when we have drained the cup
our mistress deals to us, and anointed us with
that ointment she mixes?" said her companion,
trying to fortify her own incredulity by the
extorted confession of the other. "Have we
not had brave nights, high visions, rare pleasures?
Was it a dream that night when we
danced round the tree, where hung the bodies
of the vassals of the Lord of Courtenaye,

<!-- vol 4 page 17 -->

whom he slew in his mood for saying that he
knew better how to feast the Crusaders, than
to lead them; and ever as we danced we rent
a rag or gnawed a muscle till they descended
and joined us, the fetters clanking round the
fleshless bones making meet time to our measure?
Who our dark minstrel was, thou
sawest thyself."</p>

<p>"And what was that," said the other
in fiendish emulation&mdash;"what was that to
the night we feasted in the ruined church
interdicted for murder long since done, and
in which the children of the Count of Toulouse
sought sanctuary in vain? I, for thou
wast not there, dug with these nails the
body of a span-long unchristened brat from
the grave where the mother, a leman of the
Bishop of Toulouse, had smothered it in
earth. Flags of the aisle were our table, and
strange were the dainties heaped on them;
but that which pleased our master best was
the&mdash;&mdash;Hush! let us stir the cauldron: the
flame waxeth pale, and it must be the hue
of the rose, ere the charm be perfect. Hark!"
she exclaimed, "hark!" and "hark again!"

<!-- vol 4 page 18 -->

was repeated by her companions, as a sound
of unutterable horror ascended from the floor
on which they stood. "Is it our master?" said
the hags, crouching close to each other. "Who
are ye?" said a feeble voice,&mdash;"who are ye,
the sound of whose voices I hear above me?"&mdash;"We
are the daughters of evil!" said the
elder hag, "met to do our father's will."&mdash;"And
fitter spot ye might not choose," said
the voice; "but if ye be human, list to me,
though ye may not aid me."&mdash;"And who art
thou that criest on us so?" said the hags,
bending their ears to the floor.&mdash;"I am Vidal
the minstrel!" said a feeble voice: "I have
been plunged by the craft and crime of the
Lord of Courtenaye in this dungeon, because
my memory bore traces that are now effaced.
Here have they held me in misery; but they
fed me at least till within the last two days.
From thence I have not tasted food, and
that I should lightly regard; all I crave is
one draught of water! water! and I die
content." The hags, from the deepest experience
of human wretchedness combined
with the most craving excitement of the

<!-- vol 4 page 19 -->

imagination, were as unmoved by the horrors
they heard as by those they were about to
prepare, and they would have mocked the
gasping petitioner, had not one appeared
among them, who in a moment chained up
every tongue in terror.</p>

<p>It was the Lord of Courtenaye, who
entering the closet locked the door behind
him, and then fiercely turning to the group
demanded&mdash;"Where is <i>she?</i>"&mdash;"She will
be here anon," answered the beldames;
"and meanwhile we lack no implements
for our task."&mdash;"To it, then, and suddenly,
and successfully," said the Lord of
Courtenaye: "or ye shall welter and roar in
the cauldron ye are lighting! To your gear
and quickly, ye hags. So sure as I fling down
this key from my hand," and he dropped it
into the seething cauldron, "so surely shall
ye never quit your task till it be fulfilled."&mdash;"She
will be here anon&mdash;doubt it not," said the
terrified hags.&mdash;"I neither doubt nor believe,
nor think nor feel," said the furious lord: "on
with your task! The night wanes, and the fiery
arrow is already drawn to the head&mdash;the

<!-- vol 4 page 20 -->

heavens are dark&mdash;the astrologer reads the
stars no more. What light I may now catch
must flash on me from the abysses of that
downward world, of whose entrance ye are
meet portresses." Two of the wretched
women then linked themselves hand in hand,
while the third recited aloud from her parchment.
As they hopped and hobbled their
witch-dance round the cauldron, one of them
repeated incessantly, <i>hurr, hurr, hurr,
harr, hus, hus;</i> at every sound striking
her staff stronger on the floor, while her
voice rose to a shriek, and the other uttered
the imagined potent sounds <i>Dies, dies jesquet
benedoefet, douvima, enitemaus</i>. The arch-witch
meanwhile stirred the cauldron, and
read fast and loud from that bloody scroll.<sup id="ref039"><a href="#en039">39</a></sup>
Suddenly the blaze of the cauldron tapered
upward, gleamed and expired. "By hell!"
said the Lord of Courtenaye, "ye mock me
with some device." The hags wearily pursued
their magic dance, and the cauldron blazed

<!-- vol 4 page 21 -->

again. "Of what hue must the flame be,"
said the Lord of Courtenaye, "ere her promise
be fulfilled?"&mdash;"The hue of the blood-red
wine, or of the warrior's heart-drops," answered
the witches.&mdash;"And know ye not, hags, a
spell to make the flame change its hue from
that pale infernal blue to crimson? Hark
ye! raise the flame to its right and ruddy
hue, or by hell I will stir the cauldron with
your withered carcasses!"</p>

<p>The terrified hags renewed their "toil
and trouble:" and the fierce and fiend-like
visage of the Lord of Courtenaye was
bent more eagerly on the blaze. The
hags crouched breathless beside it. "I have
got an ingredient of power," said one of
them; "but our mistress charged me not to
use it, save in her presence."&mdash;"Use it now,"
said the Lord of Courtenaye, "plunge it in,
or thou thyself shalt plunge in that cauldron!"
Thus urged, the wretched woman flung the
ingredient with which the mistress of the
spell had furnished her into the cauldron.
It was a chemical preparation of singular
power. The moment it was dropped into

<!-- vol 4 page 22 -->

the cauldron, the flame sank and all was
darkness for a moment. The next it blazed
up to the height of the ceiling, caught fierce
and instant hold of the rafters, and next of
the cloth with which the apartment was
hung. And in a few moments every compartment
of the chamber was on flame, and
the light of the cauldron extinguished in
that of blazing roof, tapestry, and furniture.</p>

<p>The first effort of the Lord of Courtenaye
was to recover the key which in his passion he
had flung into the cauldron. But its contents
were boiling like molten lead, and with a
shriek of agony he withdrew his arm. His
next was to call on his wretched associates
to assist in extinguishing the flames; but
all the materials were combustible, and
their thread-bare rags, which they tore off
to stifle the flames, burned like tinder in
a moment. His last impulse was to rush
to the door, and thunder at it with hand
and foot, uttering all the time yells of fierce
and fearful agony. The chamber was remote
from the haunt of domestics. He redoubled

<!-- vol 4 page 23 -->

his cries: but, meanwhile, the flames
had increased, the tapestry was consumed,
the roof was in a flame over their heads,
and blazing fragments began to drop on the
floor. The cloth that hung before the warrior's
portrait, consumed to ashes, crumbled
away, and the figure painted on copper, and
resisting the force of the flames, stood out
strongly in the horrid light, as if a living and
present being glared on the fearful doom of
his foe.</p>

<p>At this moment, the wretched hags,
maddened by the increasing flames, yet retaining
some witch-like associations, excited
by the crimson blaze, began once more their
ghastly reel about the cauldron, whose over-boiling
flames caught their garments in a
moment. They blazed, yet still they staggered
in that wild dance, and shrieked their spells
as the fire reached their flesh. Then all at
once they seized hold of the Lord of Courtenaye.
Loud as his cries were, they were
drowned by louder cries without. A hundred
voices shouted&mdash;"Where is the Lord of

<!-- vol 4 page 24 -->

Courtenaye? Where?" and a hundred footsteps
were heard above in the stone-paved
galleries.&mdash;"Here&mdash;here!" said their lord,
whose horror of his dreadful death overcame
his fear of being discovered with such associates
in such employment. "I burn&mdash;I burn;&mdash;unless
aid be given presently. The key is
lost&mdash;use axe and crow&mdash;break ope the door&mdash;break
ope the door!" he cried, turning
his feeble fingers round the massive lock.</p>

<p>"Then mischief hath done its masterpiece,
and it is hell's very holiday!" exclaimed a
voice without. "The Lady Isabelle lies
slaughtered in the bridal bed, and none can
trace the assassin!"&mdash;"What tellest thou me
of the Lady Isabelle!" said the Lord of Courtenaye:
"I tell thee, slave, I burn!" The
volumes of smoke now came bursting from
beneath the door, and through the apertures
of the walls. In a moment crows and axes,
and all the implements for forcing a way, were
thundering against the door; while another
party ascending by a stair, the landing-place
of which was on the roof of that closet, tore

<!-- vol 4 page 25 -->

it up, with pick-axe and all implements at
hand; and others toiled to drag up the stair
vessels of water to pour on the flame. The
din was horrible: the dying screams of the
hags, two of whom were suffocated by the
flames, the last dancing and blazing in a paroxysm
of fury-like inebriation, till she fell&mdash;the
cries of the Lord of Courtenaye, who
held fast hold of the door, shrieking at every
blow dealt on it&mdash;the clash and batter on the
roof of the chamber&mdash;the roar of the suppressed
flames&mdash;the clamour of the attendants,
made the scene almost infernal. It
was in vain the strength of the vassals was
tried on the iron-plated door: blow after
blow was dealt in vain. Above, the toil
was more successful: the planks were rent
asunder, the rafters laid bare, casks of water
poured on the flames; and bending through
the fractures of the ceiling, they heard their
lord exclaim, "Oh, for one drop of the water
that I have denied the thirsty mendicant
at my castle-gate!&mdash;one drop!"&mdash;"One
drop," echoed a voice which none heard but

<!-- vol 4 page 26 -->

he. The same exclamation was uttered, and
at the same moment, by the lord of the castle
and the victim of the dungeon. At that
moment the floor gave way, and went crashing
and blazing into the vault below. "Fling
down ropes, since the door will not yield,"
cried a hundred voices, as the shrieking
lord clung to the posts of the door, the
scorching fragments of the floor being his
only standing-place. "Come heaven or
hell," said Thibaud, whom frantic intoxication
bent over the shattered roof among the
rest, "the Lord of Courtenaye shall not perish
alone: be his doom what it will, I will
partake it." And, spite of the resistance, he
dashed himself from the crater, as it might
be termed, into the gulf below. The impulse
of his fall shattered and bore down the
single plank on which the Lord of Courtenaye
stood. They plunged together amid smoke
and flame; but amid both arose another
form, whose yell and grasp, hideousness and
fierceness, justified the terrible construction
put on its appearance. "Out with thy

<!-- vol 4 page 27 -->

beads, Monk of Montcalm," cried all: "save&mdash;save
him, if thou canst! The fiend hath
risen in flames to seize him!&mdash;how he grapples!&mdash;how
he writhes&mdash;how he gnashes!&mdash;the
fiend is stronger! Holy Mary!&mdash;&mdash;Did
ever human eyes see such sight!&mdash;The
fiend hath him&mdash;he plunges him into the
flames.&mdash;Tell thy beads faster, monk. Holy
monk, save his soul, if not his body!&mdash;He
rises&mdash;he shrieks&mdash;he sinks&mdash;he is lost!" all
exclaimed, as the Lord of Courtenaye disappeared,
sinking into that vault of flame and
darkness with the ghastly shape that seized
him. It was indeed Vidal, the prisoner of
the dungeon, who, in the agonies of his dying
vengeance, as the roof of his prison fell in,
had seized on his tyrant lord, and dragged
him down into the flames, amid which he
was himself choking and expiring.</p>

<p>The smouldering ruins of the magic chamber
fell fast into that gulf of flame. All
present averted their eyes at the sight, and
prayed in terror, or in deprecation. A single
voice thundered through that awful silence:

<!-- vol 4 page 28 -->

it exclaimed, "When have my predictions
failed? Said I not unto thee, <i>thou
shouldest meet my Master and thine this
night?</i>" Those who heard had scarce time
to catch the sound, or distinguish the form
of the speaker; for many footsteps approached,
and voices were heard to exclaim&mdash;"Foul
witchery hath been wrought this night! The
body of the lady Isabelle hath disappeared;
the traces of blood are in the chamber, but
nowhere can her corse be found. Close all
the doors, let every knight in the castle
draw his brand, and look that the murderer
escape not."</p>

<p>But their way<br/>

Lies through the perplex'd paths of this drear wood.</p>

<p class="right">MILTON'S <i>Comus</i>.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE Monk of Montcalm had set out on
his return to Beaucaire, after doing his
errand at the convent of the Paraclete. The
danger to be apprehended from the wolves,
which infested the forest that lay in his nearest
way, induced him to adopt another and more
circuitous route. While pursuing it, evening
came on&mdash;a grey and misty twilight veiled
every object. The way lay through a rocky
road that wound among mountains, or rather
stony hills, bleak and bare. Not a
sound broke on the stillness, save the echo
of the solitary passenger's steps from the hollows
of the hill, and the screams of the birds,

<!-- vol 4 page 30 -->

which, after a few short circles in the grey
and cloudy air, flew back to their retreat
among the cliffs.</p>

<p>As the evening or rather night advanced,
the clouds dispersed, and the scene around
became less dreary. The path opened on a
plain apparently boundless; it was covered
with a soft thick sward, of which the elastic
resistance to the tread made the footing delightful:
the wide dome of the horizon was its
only limit; the bright stars "came up above
the head" of the traveller, and there was just
that dubious interval between light and darkness,
that, though shadowy and indistinct,
cannot be termed gloomy. So profound was
the silence, too, that the monk could distinctly
hear his own footsteps; there was no
other sound, save the whistle of the shepherds
shooting across the heath, or a few notes of
those simple airs by which they amused the
loneliness of their pastoral life, and which,
heard thus at night, (the singer too invisible,)
had an expression of plaintive and soothing
sweetness which they must have wanted by

<!-- vol 4 page 31 -->

day: they had the effect not only of cheering
the path, but the spirits, of the good monk.
"Perchance," he said, "those sounds, so simple
and yet sweet, may be caught by a more
skilful ear than mine; and, when adorned
with courtly words, and set off by some
curious instrument, may yet be heard
with delight in the palaces of princes.<sup id="ref040"><a href="#en040">40</a></sup>
And thus too, perhaps," he added, "the
sounds that these poor Albigeois have presumed
to strike on the mysterious chords of
inspiration, when modulated by a truer ear
and a finer touch, may be caught by futurity,
and one day make music in the ear of
heaven." The plain now terminated in one
of those thickets through which he had to
make his way, to avoid the dangers of the
forest. Here, struggling through the tangled
and intricate brakes, the only point of direction

<!-- vol 4 page 32 -->

discoverable was a small eminence, surmounted
by what, on reaching it, he discovered
to be a cross of stone. He gained it,
and tried to send his feeble sight far into the
night. The lights that long ere this should
have glimmered from the town of Beaucaire,
were not visible; the humble spires of Paraclete
had ceased to be so long ere twilight;
and where the sky glowed with the blaze of
its brightest constellations, their lights burned
in the direction of the far-distant towers of
Courtenaye, so late the seat of beauty, valour,
and festivity; now dark, deserted, and suggesting
only images of fearful and mysterious
calamity.</p>

<p>At this moment he saw a light at
a small distance, slowly but distinctly approaching
him. It paused, and then he
thought he could distinguish a group of
figures; but all was dim, shadowy, and uncertain.
The Monk of Montcalm, however,
sure that human beings were near, hasted
from the eminence to implore their assistance;
but, at the first sound of his voice, the light

<!-- vol 4 page 33 -->

was extinguished and the figures became totally
invisible. He struggled on&mdash;he thought
he heard the low moanings of one in pain,
but suppressing his cries; and, as he attempted
to feel his way with extended hands,
something like a human hand touched his;
but the touch was so cold, that the monk
withdrew his from the contact, shuddering
as he did so with invincible horror. The encounter
seemed, however, to brace his nerves;
for, after having, with dizzy head and unconscious
step, forced his way, as he imagined,
but a few paces onward, he found himself
on a spot which must have been a furlong
from his last position. Here the brushwood
was cleared away&mdash;a few dwarf trees only
intercepted the view: but these stood lone
and almost ghastly, waving their boughs in
the night-breeze like the arms of skeletons;
their pale bark and doddered trunks making
themselves visible in the dim light.</p>

<p>Amid this scene, cheerless, if not desolate,
on a bare platform, stood a tower, large, square,
and low. Around this lonely tower were the

<!-- vol 4 page 34 -->

fragments of a shattered wall, amid whose angles
(for it was very irregularly built) were the remains
of some ruinous outbuildings. The monk
paused and looked round him: terror was his
first impulse; but his weariness, both mental
and bodily, prevailed, and he was compelled to
seat himself on a fragment of the ruined wall,
while he trembled at the shelter he sought. It
was the tower of Ugo, or Hugues,<sup id="ref041"><a href="#en041">41</a></sup> in whose
vicinity the boldest in that country dreaded
to be after sunset. The monk was not without
his share of the superstition of the age;
but the purity of his conscience was a balance
to the errors of his creed; and he looked on
the tower, and thought of its terrible inhabitant,
with fear indeed, but unmixed with a
sense of danger.</p>

<p>As he looked upwards on the huge

<!-- vol 4 page 35 -->

pile, dimly defined on the troubled sky,
a small postern that lay concealed in the
darkness was cautiously opened, and two
figures issuing from it, approached him.
They spoke, but their conversation was in
whispers, and he could distinguish only one
sentence: "It is done! and were the guerdon
doubled, I would not undertake such task
again." They passed on; and dreary as the
speech had been, the monk felt it was still
drearier to listen to their departing tread,
and watch their figures as they diminished
in the darkness.</p>

<p>At this moment a light was distinctly
seen gleaming in a loophole of the tower;
and though this was, in the monk's
opinion, a very equivocal sign that the inmates
of the tower were beings of his own
species, he continued to watch with that
vague hope that light always suggests in a
situation so lonely, till he saw it glimmer
through a narrow slit that seemed on a level
with the postern. If the hand that bears
that light be human, thought the monk,
rising with difficulty, it will not close the

<!-- vol 4 page 36 -->

door against me at such an hour. And he
struck on it with his staff.&mdash;In a few moments
it was opened slowly, and a figure appeared
at it, bearing a light in its hand. It
was tall, and enveloped so completely in dark
garments, that neither form, sex, nor age was
distinguishable. The eyes alone were visible;
and though they were bright and large,
there was an expression in them that was
not calculated to diminish the feeling its
singular appearance created. The monk (in
a tone that he could not prevent from faltering)
told his distress as a benighted traveller,
and entreated permission to enter,
almost wishing now it might be denied. The
figure appeared to be examining him closely:
at length it replied, "Enter, if thou wilt."
But these words, pronounced in a voice by
which it was still impossible to judge of the
speaker's sex, seemed, by the manner in
which they were uttered, to imply "Enter if
you dare." The monk, anxious for something
like a parley with his strange host, asked if
he might be permitted to sleep that night

<!-- vol 4 page 37 -->

beneath the roof. "Sleep," answered the
figure in the same tone, "if thou canst." It
closed the door as the monk entered, and,
turning, led the way up a winding staircase
of stone, rudely constructed, and much dilapidated.
After ascending a few steps, it led
the way through an arch of stone, without a
door, into a large chamber; into the centre of
which it advanced, and then stood in silence.</p>

<p>The monk looked round him. The apartment
was rude, wild, and desolate; without
furniture, and apparently without other inhabitant.
The walls were of unhewn stone,
and, with the arched ceiling, were blackened
by time and smoke. In the huge fire-place
some embers were still burning on the hearth,
shedding on the wide arch above and the
rugged walls</p>

<p class="small">"A melancholy light,<br/>

The gloom of glowing embers."<sup id="ref042"><a href="#en042">42</a></sup></p>

<p>On one side was a kind of rude wooden
couch, on which were spread some dark vestments;
on the other side a heap of the same

<!-- vol 4 page 38 -->

seemed huddled in a dark nook; on the hearth
was placed a large cauldron. These objects
were scarce discoverable by the dim light the
figure held, but were disclosed from time to
time by the red and fitful glow of the fire.
The monk had time to notice these objects,
for the figure had not yet spoken, but remained
standing in the centre of the room.
At length, pressing its hand on its brow, as if
with an effort at recollection, it muttered,
"Yes, he lacks food." Then turning to the
monk&mdash;"Thou art with one who, unconscious
of human wants, sometimes forgets
that the children of the dust possess not such
exemption." And, pointing to the monk to sit
down on a bench of stone, it offered him some
fragments of bread and a cup of water.&mdash;The
monk declined the food, but drank the water,
first fortifying himself with an internal ejaculatory
prayer. "Perhaps thou art dainty: I
have nought else to offer."&mdash;"It is my wonted&mdash;in
truth, mine only fare," replied the monk;
"but I am weary and o'erworn, and would
willingly sleep." The figure silently pointed

<!-- vol 4 page 39 -->

to a nook in which some straw was spread,
and then quitted the apartment, bearing the
light with it; while the monk, after praying
with more than usual fervency, tried to betake
himself to rest. The glare of the fire for
a long time prevented him from closing his
eyes; and when at length he did so, and was
sinking into rest, he was roused by a groan,
not loud, but perfectly audible, issuing evidently
from some one in the chamber. He half rose
on his elbow, and looked round him: it was
not repeated, and he tried to compose himself
again. But he had scarcely done so, when
a second groan was heard nearer him, as if
the person who uttered it was approaching.</p>

<p>Giving up all farther thoughts of rest,
the monk now began telling his beads earnestly.
But, while thus occupied, his eyes
involuntarily closed from weariness; and he
then thought he perceived the light, that had
hitherto shone so strongly through the chamber,
suddenly obscured, so as to be perceptible
to his sight, though his eyes were closed.
Once more he raised himself, and then saw

<!-- vol 4 page 40 -->

distinctly a dark figure standing between him
and the fire. Its back was turned to him; but
the form was visible, and strongly defined on
the light. After a few moments, it glided away,
and was lost in the obscurity of the chamber.</p>

<p>The monk now arose, and tremblingly
but solemnly adjured the vision, whether
a living mortal or a disembodied spirit,
to appear and reveal the cause of its restlessness
and its wailings. There was no
answer, but, as he advanced farther into the
apartment, it appeared to him that the heap
of vestments spread on the couch, which he
had before observed, moved slightly. "This
light deceives mine eyes, perchance," he said;
"yet surely those garments seem so disposed
as if a human body lay beneath them."
The folds heaved palpably as he spoke. With
the preternatural courage of fear, he raised
part of the drapery, and saw with horror, beneath,
the naked bosom of a man, from a
wound in whose side the blood was still
flowing. He had not strength to look at the
face; he staggered some paces back, and

<!-- vol 4 page 41 -->

leaned against the wall for support. At this
moment the sound of steps slowly roused him,
and the figure he had before beheld again entered
the chamber, bearing something in its arms.</p>

<p>The monk did not venture to quit the
spot: he stood contracting his figure and
suppressing his breath, while he watched its
movements. After some uncertain gestures
and vague glances round the chamber, it
crouched at length before the fire, and, unfolding
the burthen it held in its arms, began
to drop slowly and singly its contents into
the cauldron. These appeared to be herbs;
but there were other ingredients: and at
length he perceived relics of mortality,
bones and parts of a human body, mingling
in the mixture. He could no longer doubt the
purpose and employment of the figure; and,
trembling lest he should become in some degree
a partaker of the crime by continuing
to witness it, he hastened from his concealment,
and called aloud on the figure to forbear.
She rose, and turning hastily towards him,
dropped the mantle which enfolded her head,

<!-- vol 4 page 42 -->

and disclosed the features of a face which, but
once beheld, had been forgotten never.&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"He had awaken'd at night<br/>

With the dream of those ghastly eyes."<sup id="ref043"><a href="#en043">43</a></sup></p>

<p>His first impulse was to gaze on them for
a moment with unmingled horror; his next,
to fly from the place. "Stay me not," he
cried, as she appeared attempting to detain
him: "withhold me not; I know thee who
thou art! Not a word, not a breath, will I
exchange with thee: I know thee who thou
art!"&mdash;"Know me!" she replied in a voice
in which scorn seemed to be mingled with
incredulity.&mdash;"I know all!" he exclaimed;
"I know thee, thy crime, and thy despair:
crime that forbids mercy; despair that shuts
out hope."&mdash;"Thy words&mdash;thy voice," she
said, "are like those dreams that sometimes
cross the dark sleep of my existence. Now
the recollection rises dimly on me like a
vision. Dost thou remember the lonely lake,
and her who rowed the dark skiff? It was

<!-- vol 4 page 43 -->

a strange meeting that&mdash;marked by doubtful
question and fearful answer."&mdash;"Would I did
not remember!" replied the monk, crossing
himself. And he recalled that night alluded
to in the commencement of our tale, when he
had encountered this female, previously to her
meeting with Sir Paladour, and after having
done deep penance for the involuntary crime
of listening to her dreadful secret. "Yet
stay," she said, detaining him, while she
seemed searching her scattered recollections,
"yet stay, there is a task to be done, in
which thou wilt not scorn to join even
with me: there is one whose wound is
deep and deadly, and thou must aid me to
heal it."&mdash;"Wretched woman," cried the
monk, who believed she spoke of herself,
"for such wound as thine there is no balm,
no leech, or healing in mortal power."&mdash;"And
deemest thou it was of a spirit's immortal
wounds I spoke?" she said, "or sought
aid or cure for them from <i>thee?</i> Then were
my folly beyond even my crime. No&mdash;it was
of another I spoke, and, light as I hold thine

<!-- vol 4 page 44 -->

aid, or that of man, the credulity (which
thou wouldst call faith) of the sufferer demands
the charm of prayer muttered over
the ingredients I am preparing for his cure:
it may not else be wrought."&mdash;"And darest
thou," said the monk, shrinking with horror
from the proposal, "darest thou imagine
that I would blend the worship of Heaven
with the rites of Hell, and mix the breath
of profaned and polluted prayer with the
steam that issues from that cauldron of abomination?
If I pray for thy victim, I pray
alone."&mdash;"My victim!" cried the female with
fierce derision. "Ye are the victims of your
own lusts, madness, and crime&mdash;victims of
your own preparation. And then ye dare
to accuse the stars&mdash;the elements&mdash;the hurtless
operation of inanimate things. Yea, in
your insane impotence, ye accuse that Heaven
that renounces and hates ye! My
victim!" she repeated; "when was man a
victim, but by his own agency?"&mdash;"I heed
not thy ravings," replied the monk, divested
of all terror: "if good is to be wrought,

<!-- vol 4 page 45 -->

tell me how, or on whom; but it never can
be in conjunction with thee!"</p>

<p>A deep groan seemed to echo his words;
and now fully aroused and emboldened, the
monk turned to observe whence it issued.
That smaller heap of coiled-up garments
which he had noticed before, seemed to stir,
and a sound was heard from beneath it
that resembled respiration painfully suppressed.
He made a movement to approach it.
"Hold!" cried the female, seizing his arm,
"disturb not the slumberer: Sleep is the
image of death. When have mortals rest
but in sleep, or in the grave?"&mdash;"Talk not
to me," said the monk,&mdash;"here hath been
evil done&mdash;a corse lies in this chamber. I
tell thee, wretched woman&mdash;if woman thou
art&mdash;weak as I am, I will not quit this
spot till I know what body lies beneath
that bloody and unblest covering."&mdash;"It is
a wounded knight," she said; "and I have
brought him hither that I may heal him."&mdash;"And
is it with such ingredients the cure
is to be wrought! What are the foul

<!-- vol 4 page 46 -->

contents of yonder cauldron?"&mdash;"Thou
knowest not what is mingling in that potent
mixture," she replied, bending her eye on it.
"There be hope and anguish, crime and
fear; tears wept from the heart, and mingled
with its blood; maidens' young vows,
and true men's broken hearts."&mdash;"Aroint thee,
foul witch!" cried the monk, "<i>adjuro te in nomine!</i>"&mdash;"Peace
with thy powerless jargon,"
she interrupted; "the adder's ear is not deafer
to it than mine. Speak! wilt thou utter a
prayer over what I have prepared and provided
here? For myself I ask thee none:
those who have nothing to hope, have also
nothing to fear."&mdash;"Blaspheme not, wretched
woman! Holy Heaven, is it possible that
aught that once bore thine image can be so
utterly fallen!"&mdash;"Fallen!" she repeated in
an altered tone; "yes, truly thou sayest fallen;&mdash;it
is not that time has bowed my form,
that disease has ravaged my frame, that
anguish has withered my heart: this is not
to be fallen;&mdash;it is when God hath departed
from the soul where he dwelt; when the

<!-- vol 4 page 47 -->

cherubim withdraw their plumes from the
mercy-seat; when the desecrated temple
becomes the den of fiends, the abode of
hatred and vengeance! <i>That, that</i> is to be
fallen, and that am I!"</p>

<p>Moved by her words, the monk was
attempting to frame his voice into a tone
of compassion; when, the tide of her feelings
suddenly recoiling, she burst into a
strain of imprecation so vehement, continuous,
and dreadful, that the holy man, believing
himself in truth in the presence of an evil
spirit, and losing all other fears in the thought,
rushed from the spot in horror: nor was it
till he was at some distance from the tower
that he could collect his thoughts, and endeavour,
by urgent prayer, to banish the recollection
of the horrible sounds with which
his ears still seemed ringing.</p>

<p>When, lo! a train profusely gay<br/>

Comes prankling o'er the place.</p>

<p class="right">PARNELL.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE beams of the morning sun rising in
a cloudless sky, and gleaming on the glittering
frost-work of a wintry but smiling landscape;
the crisped earth; the narrowed
brook, with its line of blue waters gliding
between two banks of crystal; the cold but
reviving and bracing air; the twittering of
the birds, waking in their wintry nests amid
the leafless branches; and the merry bells
ringing in the town of Beaucaire, whose
spires towered and sparkled in the far
blue horizon&mdash;came welcomely and refreshingly
to the senses of the poor monk, as the
morning broke on his advancing progress.
The fearful night had passed, and he felt

<!-- vol 4 page 49 -->

its dark images disappear before the cheering
and invigorating influence of that kindliest if
not loveliest of mornings&mdash;the bright healthful
morning of a genial winter-day.</p>

<p>He wound his way through the thicket,
and after one involuntary reverted glance towards
the dark tower of Ugo, was entering
on the plain, when, from an opposite hill, a
gay and splendid train appeared descending,
and the contrast between them and the fearful
forms of the past night, made them appear
like some bright group from fairy-land.</p>

<p>A gallant array of knights and men-at-arms,
well accoutred and mounted, rode round
a lady, sumptuously attired, and appearing
the mistress of the train: the bells round the
necks of the knights' horses, and the bugles
of their attendants, making a merry melody
as they rode. Behind them followed a smaller
train; and as they reached the foot of the
hill the van halted, and the knights, reining
up their steeds on each side, left a space
in the centre, where the lady sat on her palfrey
alone. The party in the rear then advanced,

<!-- vol 4 page 50 -->

and a young female, alighting from her horse,
knelt to the lady, and attempted to kiss her
hand, while the other, bending from her saddle,
embraced her. A short delay occurred,
as a brief and hurried farewell seemed to
pass between the two parties. The former
gathering round the lady in the splendid
garb, and pushing their horses to speed as
they parted in one direction; while a single
knight, with about a dozen men-at-arms, appeared
to act as the guide and conductor of
the other female, who had now remounted
her horse, and rode rapidly in the opposite
direction. The parties seemed to separate
with every token of regard, the knights saluting
by lowering their bannered lances and
bending their plumed heads, and the females
by waving the ends of their embroidered
veils, and kissing their hands till they could
behold each other no longer.</p>

<p>The former party consisted of queen Ingelberg,
who, with De Vaugelas and Limosin,
was pursuing her way to Paris; the latter,

<!-- vol 4 page 51 -->

of Sir Amirald and his train, who by the
queen's order, and at her own wish, was conducting
Genevieve to Toulouse.</p>

<p>On that spot they had parted; but not before
a change, at which she trembled, had
taken place in Genevieve's heart and mind.
She had rode some days in peace and security
with queen Ingelberg's party. Caressed
by the grateful queen, honoured by
her courtly attendants, and, most dangerous
of all, loved by one, for whose love she would
have forsaken all but her faith: in this short
interval of tranquillity, the only one her
stormy existence had ever known, characters
had been developed without the strong exigency
of circumstances, and feelings expressed,
that seemed the birth of the heart and
the habit, not of the moment.&mdash;What noble
feeling!&mdash;what lofty thought!&mdash;what deep
self-devotedness!&mdash;what graceful courtesy
had not the knights displayed; and queen
Ingelberg, who owed her superiority evidently
more to her rank than to her intellectual eminence,

<!-- vol 4 page 52 -->

how grateful was she! and how resistless</p>

<p class="small">In all the graceful gratitude of power!<sup id="ref044"><a href="#en044">44</a></sup></p>

<p>And their manner&mdash;their voices&mdash;their language&mdash;their
whole existence, seemed modulated
on a scale of noble harmony. All that
was lofty&mdash;all that was refined in life, seemed
to be concentrated in the self-devoted valour
of the men&mdash;the stately and gentle
courtesy of the women. And these were
the beings who had been represented
to her from infancy as demons of pride,
rapacity, and brutality; and Amirald, too,
the beautiful, the brave, the gentle, was
he indeed the enemy of Heaven?&mdash;She began
to doubt her creed; then trembling at
her own aberrations, forced herself to cast a
look on her future life&mdash;it was one of poverty
and toil; for she had sacredly determined to
appropriate the value of the jewels she had
received from the queen to the relief of her
suffering people, and to maintain herself by

<!-- vol 4 page 53 -->

her own labours; and her late existence, caressed
by royalty and flattered by love, was
to be a dream&mdash;And let it be a dream! she
sighed, with a strong effort of internal resolution:
she struggled hard with her heart, and
strove to fix her eye steadily on her future
prospects, dreary as they were.</p>

<p>"Would I had never known them," she
said; meaning only <i>him</i> when she said <i>them;</i>
for the creed, the home, and the habits of
her fathers seemed dark to her mental eye as
she forced it to dwell on them: and she tried
to expiate the involuntary crime by an internal
resolve never to suffer gratitude, admiration,
or another feeling (which she would
not name but could not disavow) to interfere
with the claims of her conscience&mdash;the duties,
the exigencies, the necessities, (and she
often repeated the word) the necessities of
her own destination. Perhaps she was not
aware that this resolution was made while
her face was averted from that of Sir Amirald,
for the next moment when she beheld
those features glowing with youth, beauty,

<!-- vol 4 page 54 -->

and passion, she again felt her heart palpitate
and her mind wander. She could not, however,
decline conversing with her guide and
protector, though she knew that the topic of
his discourse would put her resolution to the
test; and she prepared to listen with averted
face and a rigid determination of self-watchfulness
and self-possession.</p>

<p>The conversation was long, earnest, and
animated on the part of Amirald: its tenor
may be conjectured from the only reply of
Genevieve's that was audible,&mdash;"No, Sir
Knight, never!&mdash;Sir Knight, never&mdash;the destiny
of a noble youth must not be thwarted
and debased by a lot so lowly and hapless.&mdash;Go
on, noble knight, in the career to which
thy fate calls thee, and honour and fortune
sit on thy lance, save when it is levelled
against the helpless and the harmless! Forget
me, save when thou meetest one of my
people; and then think on me and spare him.
Some fair and noble maiden&mdash;" but she could
not finish this part of the picture; and so,
having uttered her resolution with what

<!-- vol 4 page 55 -->

strength she might, she said to herself, "Now
my heart is at peace&mdash;yes, I am at peace;"
and dropping her veil, wept in silent agony
within its folds.</p>

<p>But here she was mistaken: endless opportunities
occurred during their journey,
and Amirald was not a youth likely to lose
his suit for lack of importunity; besides,
pleading has a thousand tones, and refusal
but one; and Genevieve grew wearied and
ashamed of the poverty and monotony of her
sole reply to the endlessly varied and increasingly
eloquent pleadings of her lover: nature,
too, seemed to take part against her in their
progress; for the spot where they halted to
partake of their noon-day meal, seemed
formed to soften the heart: it was one of
those spots that winter seems delighted to
spare&mdash;a grassy path kept fresh and verdurous
by overhanging evergreens, terminated
in a rocky enclosure, whose acclivities
were feathered to their very summits with
every tree and shrub that could yet boast a
leafy spray or a tint of green. A narrow
stream fell in sheets of foam from the highest

<!-- vol 4 page 56 -->

rocks, and rested in a basin, where its transparent
dark-brown water gave back, as it reposed,
the image of every rock and grassy
tuft and pendent spray that overhung it:
around, the rocks were hollowed into cavities,
rich with mosses of every hue, and the
fantastic clusters of creeping plants:&mdash;their
rude forms, sequestered look, and the mystical
and shifting light that played over them,
as the sun gleamed on the water or the wind
waved the boughs, suggesting the image&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">Intus aqu&aelig; dulces, vivoque sedilia saxo,<br/>

Nympharum domus.<sup id="ref045"><a href="#en045">45</a></sup></p>

<p>It was here the travellers rested, and
seating themselves on the grass, partook of
their repast, and slaked their thirst at the
stream as it fell. "Thou art resolved, then,
that I must be of noble birth," said Amirald,
renewing the topic of their conversation as
soon as he could: "Alas! sweet Genevieve,
I am the child of mystery&mdash;a foundling, exposed
beneath the walls of the castle of Courtenaye,
and reared on the surly charity of its

<!-- vol 4 page 57 -->

lord. I never knew but one whose destiny,
he told me, bore aught of similitude to mine&mdash;that
darkly-fated knight de la Croix Sanglante."</p>

<p>Genevieve trembled at the name. "Alas!"
cried Amirald, his eyes fast filling with tears
at the recollection; "alas! for the noble
knight!&mdash;the love of brothers was but a faint
image of mine for thee, Paladour. A braver
knight never laid lance in rest; a truer never
pledged faith to a brother-in-arms; a goodlier
never wooed lady in her bower. Woe is me
for thee, Paladour! But what a fearful
cloud overshadowed thy setting!"&mdash;"Fearful
indeed," Genevieve murmured, shuddering as
she remembered the night of the apparition
in the convent of the Paraclete.</p>

<p>"Methinks," said Amirald, half reclining
on his cloak, which he had spread on the
grass, and letting his blue eye fall negligently
on the lovely scene around him, "methinks,
when I recall the disastrous fate of the brave
and lovely, when I think of Paladour and
the lady Isabelle, the world and all it contains

<!-- vol 4 page 58 -->

grow dim to my view. I wonder not
that men have fled from it to these sweet and
solitary places. Methinks I could now cut
off mine hair;" and he displayed, not unconsciously,
its glossy and redundant clusters;
"change my lance for a staff, my chain for a
rosary, mine helmet for a cowl, and dwell in
yonder cave, a hooded eremite.&mdash;No, not an
eremite&mdash;I would be a peasant&mdash;a wool-clad
peasant; and thou, sweet Genevieve, by my
side, while heart and hovel alike were brightened
by the light of thy smile."</p>

<p>Genevieve struggled hard to wrest her
mind from the contemplation of the picture;
but it would not do: her natural love for
rural scenery and rural habits took part with
her heart; and she thought she was but advocating
her own simple tastes, while she was
unconsciously pleading the cause of a different
and a more dangerous client. She spoke
of the spot with an enthusiasm she had never
felt before, and there was not an object around,
from the blue mountains in the distance, to
the redbreast that alit with its slender feet on

<!-- vol 4 page 59 -->

the turf to pick the crumbs of their meal,
that she did not try to paint to his attention,
with all her simple skill, till she discovered
that the eyes of Amirald were fixed not on
her, but on a superb eagle that was soaring
right above their heads and appeared stationary
at the proud height he had towered
to. "That is a gallant bird," he exclaimed,
screening his dazzled eyes with his hand;
"oh, who would hop and peck, a red-breast
in the shade, when he might soar an eagle
among the clouds? My heart would burst
were I to live amid all this softness, sloth,
and obscurity. Babieca, my gallant steed,"
he cried to his war-horse, which he had
named after the Cid's, and which came forwards
snorting and bounding at the sound of
his voice,&mdash;"Babieca, wouldst thou not renounce
my recreant weight for dooming thee
but in thought to the drudgery of a vile
peasant's market-horse?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Genevieve's cheek;
it overspread even brow and bosom. "So
wouldst thou deem <i>thyself</i> dishonoured, Sir

<!-- vol 4 page 60 -->

Knight," she cried, "wert thou yoked with
such humble mate as me; for ever wouldst
thou blush for the shame, for ever reproach
her who was its cause, and its victim."</p>

<p>"I should only have to reproach myself,"
said Amirald, whose feelings flowed in rapid
and contending tides, "for having risked
all for one, who had not even a heart to offer
in return."</p>

<p>Genevieve, without speaking, fixed her
eyes on him, till feeling them suffused with
tears, she withdrew them. "Is this generous?
is it noble?" she said at last with a
faltering voice&mdash;"is it even kind, Sir
Knight?" she added in one still more subdued,
"to crush out from a heart by torture
the secret it <i>ought</i> to keep&mdash;if it could?"&mdash;"And
canst thou love, sweet Genevieve?"
said the youth, half-reclining towards her,
while his pleading tones and glowing eyes
made that moment more dangerous than a
thousand hours of reproaches.&mdash;"Is it manly,
Sir Knight, to pursue such poor triumph
farther?" said the weeping maiden.&mdash;"Nay,

<!-- vol 4 page 61 -->

weep not, sweet Genevieve; in sooth I spoke
but in jest; I love these scenes, I love all
that is soft, soothing, and lonely: I love
these leaves," he cried catching at some from
a pendent branch, "for they remind me of
the couch which the gentle heretic once
spread for the wounded knight. <i>But</i>," he
added, and then glancing at his accoutrements,
some of which lay glittering on the turf
where he reclined, and pointing to his war-steed,
"<i>But</i>"&mdash;&mdash;"I feel, Sir Knight, what
thou wouldst say," she uttered: "here let
our conference end; and yet remember,
noble, and knight as thou art, that <i>He</i> who
made man for happiness, and was the best
judge of his own work, placed him at his
creation not in palace, castle or city&mdash;He
placed him in a garden, and called it Paradise."&mdash;"And
Paradise would be this spot,"
cried the enamoured Amirald, "if&mdash;Hark!
what sound was that? was it the scream of
the eagle?&mdash;no, by Heaven, the breath of the
trumpet! and lo where an armed band bears
up the hill! Ha! the lilies of France glitter
in the van. To horse, fellows! my helmet,

<!-- vol 4 page 62 -->

my gorget, help to don them quickly: it
must doubtless be some noble company: fear
not, maiden, I will be with thee soon."</p>

<p>And Sir Amirald rode away at full speed
with some of the men-at-arms. Genevieve
followed him with her eyes, and saw on the
summit of a hill a band of knights and men-at-arms,
who, with bugles sounded and banners
displayed, proudly crested the eminence
where they stood, seeming the precursors of
a more numerous host that was following.
A stately form in complete armour appeared
the leader of the train; a person in the
habit of a monk stood by his side, and Sir
Amirald soon rode by the other. Cordial
and courtly greeting passed; a brief but
earnest conference then took place between
the three; at the termination of which, Sir
Amirald rode off with speed in another direction,
attended by a few followers of the
stranger band.</p>

<p>Genevieve continued to gaze in the direction
he pursued long after he disappeared,
and then with an indefinable feeling of dejection

<!-- vol 4 page 63 -->

and anxiety turned to look on her
few remaining companions. Reading neither
intelligence or comfort in their looks, and
not suffering herself to doubt of Amirald's
swift return, she remounted her horse, and
dropping her veil sat in anxious silence.
She was not long left in suspense; a man in
the habit of a pursuivant, approached from
the stranger party, and after exchanging a
few words in a tone of authority with her
companions, approached her with an air in
which licentious freedom was blended with
mock courtesy. "Fair damsel," said he,
"it is the command of the princely leader
of yonder band, that I conduct you to him,
and that you share the protection of his
company." Genevieve, mute from consternation,
made no reply; the man then attempted
to raise her veil, but she held it
closely; he then caught her rein and led
her a few steps onward. "Sir stranger,"
she said checking her horse, "whatever
claims your leader may have on your obedience,
I know none he holds on mine."&mdash;"He

<!-- vol 4 page 64 -->

is noble, damsel," said the man haughtily;
"let that suffice thee."&mdash;"If he be
noble, let him prove it," said Genevieve,
"by shewing all gentleness to a female
left in the guard of a noble knight, who
hath most suddenly and strangely left her."&mdash;"Mass!"
said another who joined them,
"this dainty maiden deems there is but one
paramour in the world for her; cheer thee,
damsel, shalt have a host anon, men-at-arms
and all."&mdash;"Curb thy loose tongue," said
the other, who saw Genevieve almost dead
at his words, "and let me lead the lady on."&mdash;"In
the name of Heaven, gentle sir," said
Genevieve.&mdash;"By the mass, a heretic!" cried
the other, "or thou wouldst have called
some blessed saint, and never have troubled
Heaven for the matter."&mdash;"Alas, you seem
of gentler speech than this wild man," said
Genevieve, turning to the first, who continued
to lead her horse; "in the name of whatever
may win your ear, I implore you to tell
me into what hands I have fallen, and
where you are leading me."</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 65 -->

<p>Her conductor, instead of answering, called
to the driver of a horse-litter which appeared
in sight, to halt. "Ah, ha!" cried
the other, as two females, gaudily dressed,
alit from it, with evident marks of reluctance
and vexation; "ah, ah! my bonnibells&mdash;my
laced muttons&mdash;descend&mdash;dismount&mdash;give
place&mdash;ye must foot it, my pretty
does, unless some merciful man-at-arms or
gentle squire of dames, take ye <i>en-croupe</i>."</p>

<p>"Vile hilding!&mdash;unnurtured slave!" said
the incensed females&mdash;"is it thus thou talkest
to ladies of our state?"&mdash;He continued to
laugh, and they to rail, while Genevieve
stood amid the rude men and licentious women
like an angel in the presence of fiends.&mdash;"Gentle
dames," she said, trembling, "in
the name of womanhood, plead for me."</p>

<p>"Is this the beauty so much prized?" said
one of them, as Genevieve raised her veil to
speak.&mdash;"This helps not," said her companion,
lifting her from her horse, and placing
her with the female attendant in the litter.&mdash;"One
word&mdash;but one word," she cried,

<!-- vol 4 page 66 -->

forcing back the curtain. "Am I in the
power of him they call the Bishop of Toulouse?"&mdash;The
man regarded her with a look
of compassion for the first time.&mdash;"If the
Bishop of Toulouse be friend of thine," he
said, "would thou wert;" and he closed the
door of the litter.</p>

<p>The brief winter day was now on the
wane. The party, who appeared to have
halted merely for refreshment, prepared for
departure, and, heedless of the mute despair
of Genevieve, and the clamorous grief of
her attendant, amid the clash of arms and
the sound of trumpets, all the train rode on,
the bannered lilies of France glittering in
the van.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE man of mighty mind, the Bishop of
Toulouse, had not slumbered during the interval.
He had received the intelligence of
the escape of the queen and Genevieve from
his power, while engaged in the aid of his
ally, (as has been mentioned): on the principle
that made him sometimes foment, and
sometimes conciliate the constant feuds of
the neighbouring dignitaries and barons&mdash;the
principle of a politician of old&mdash;<i>Divide et
impera</i>. The first effect of his rage at this
intelligence would have cost the messenger
his life, had it not been qualified by other
and more welcome tidings that arrived almost

<!-- vol 4 page 68 -->

at the same moment. By his emissaries
in Paris the bishop learned that king
Philip was about to dispatch troops and treasure
in the cause of the Crusaders, under the
conduct of an unknown leader; and, what
was of higher importance at that juncture,
that Count Raymond, who was always satisfied
with slight advantages and feeble efforts,
had retired to his territorial city of Toulouse,
conceiving that he had risked enough
for the Albigeois, and was again employing
powerful agency at Rome, to effect his reconciliation
with the pope. From other missives
he learned, that many of the more powerful
barons of Languedoc, whose vassals
were of the new sect, incensed at the slaughter
and spoliation of their people, murmured
against the severity of the crusade, and waited
but a signal to take the abdicated place
of Count Raymond. To all this was
added the intelligence, that Count Simon
de Montfort, to whose pretensions and
high-established fame the court of Rome
had hitherto conceded every thing, was

<!-- vol 4 page 69 -->

slowly recovering from his wounds, and
would not be able to take the field till the
following spring. The bishop instantly
raised the siege, and returned to his castle at
Beaucaire. There he held a feast; dignitaries
and nobles thronged to it, and the result
was all that his ambition could aspire to:
to the devout, he suggested the scandal that
a mob of heretics, a vile peasantry, should
yet defy the power of the nobles, and the
thunders of the church, and wander about
propagating their vile abuses of religion; to
the warlike he declaimed on the disgrace
the cause of the church must suffer, if
they allowed their lances to rust, because
Simon de Montfort's wounds were unhealed;
to the rapacious, he promised the plunder
of the lands of those barons who secretly
favoured the cause of the Albigeois, and to
the timid and politic (who were the fewest
of the party) he hinted the danger of the
powerful lords of Languedoc rising in aid of
their distressed vassals, if some strong effort
were not made, some powerful blow struck

<!-- vol 4 page 70 -->

on the instant. The hall rung with acclamations;
the bishop seized the moment, "when
their hearts were jocund and sublime," to
propose himself as their leader. The place of
rendezvous was fixed at Nismes; and the
next morning's dawn saw the warlike prelate
ride, in his own proud element, at the
head of fifteen hundred lances, to meet the
Crusaders in that city.</p>

<p>He had vital reasons for urging matters
with the utmost dispatch: he was ignorant of
the late reconciliation between Philip and his
queen, and knowing that the troops had
marched in consequence of his belief of her
detention, and would be recalled as soon as
the truth of her escape was known, he hasted
to put himself at their head before that intelligence
had reached king Philip, satisfied
that he might then defy both the pope and
king, when commanding a force that would
not lightly desert such a leader. With these
hopes and views he hurried on at the head of
his train towards Nismes, as he had learned
that the troops of King Philip had marched

<!-- vol 4 page 71 -->

in that direction. We mention these circumstances
as explanatory of the scenes that
followed Genevieve's capture, to which we
have now to reconduct our readers.</p>

The party travelled all the evening, and
at nightfall arrived at the town of Nismes.
Genevieve, uncertain of her destination, felt
at last from the slower motion of the litter,
and the increasing tumult of voices and
trampling of horses, that the party had reached
their place of rendezvous. The lights
of the town of Nismes began to glimmer
through the curtains of her litter. Knights
and peers, with their tumultuous cavalcades,
rode away in the search of abode in the town,
thinning not imperceptibly to Genevieve's ears
the concourse and the noise. Yet she watched
the parting of every knight and noble
with his train, as if a friend rode away from
her unprotected side. The litter still continued
to proceed, though the attendants appeared
to be diminished to a few individuals.
At length it stopped, and Genevieve, who
was assisted to alight from it, found herself

<!-- vol 4 page 72 -->

in a place which she could not compare with
any other that sight or even imagination had
ever before presented her with.</p>

<p>It was a vast area, the ground unequal
and frequently encumbered with huge masses
of stone, of which some appeared the effect
of recent dilapidation, and others were
clothed with hoary moss, the growth of
centuries. There was no roof; and the
moon, "walking in brightness" above her
head, shed her full light on masses of building,
that, viewed even from the distance
where she stood in the centre of the area,
seemed to have been the work of antediluvian
giants; arches above arches, supporting
ponderous seats of marble, rose to a height
that made the eye giddy; yet, in all this
vast range of edifice there was no vestige of
human habitation. The stars glimmered
through the tenantless arches, and the foliage
waved lightly to the moon, as the breeze
sighed through this vast and desolate
monument of departed power. Genevieve
had beheld all that was great, sublime,

<!-- vol 4 page 73 -->

and even terrific in nature; but it was with
a new sensation of awe that she gazed round
her on this stony desert of man's creation&mdash;this
huge skeleton, that might once have
been clothed with myriads of population.<sup id="ref046"><a href="#en046">46</a></sup>
She would have enquired where she was;
but the thought of her own fearful situation
rushed on her, and she was silent.</p>

<p>When they had advanced a short space,
the man who conducted her, suddenly lowering
his torch, pointed to her to enter a small
recess, where was a seat of stone, over which
he threw his mantle; and then placing the
torch in a nook, made a sign to her female
attendant to withdraw, while he himself retired.
So utterly subdued were her spirits,
so hopeless was her heart, that she made no
attempt to deprecate this ominous movement,
but by clasping her hands in mute and
unheeded supplication.</p>

<p>He soon after returned with refreshments,
of which he pressed her to partake;

<!-- vol 4 page 74 -->

and she then recovered breath to implore
him to tell her in whose hands she was, and
for what purpose she had been brought to a
place so dreary. The man gazed on her a
moment, and, answering only by a laugh that
froze her blood, again withdrew.</p>

<p>Starting from her trance of stupefaction,
she tried to examine the place, and discover
if it afforded even the most desperate means
of escape. A large aperture in the wall of
the recess where she was placed, gave her a
view of the area below, on which the moonlight
fell in full lustre. Under one of the
lower arches, a band of armed men were
seen carousing by the light of torches, which
they had fixed against the walls. Two of
distinguished port, and fully armed except
their heads, were walking at some distance,
and occasionally appeared to issue orders
and make inquiries, or interfere to check
the rude mirth of the revellers. One of
them was evidently the leader of the band
they had encountered that day; the other
seemed an ancient knight: but, whoever they

<!-- vol 4 page 75 -->

might be, they were evidently objects of the
deepest reverence to the rest; as, at their
lightest word, one or other darted forth from
beneath the arch, with his flaring torch,
seeming to demand their pleasure. And
Genevieve, amid all her terrors, could not
help admiring the darkly-seen and solitary
grandeur of these forms, moving alone, amid
that vast pile, like its former inhabitants returned
to visit earth; while the sudden flashes
of light and involutions of darkness, caused
by the gleam and disappearance of the
torches, seemed like shadows of gigantic
spectres following each other, in their majestic
flight from the deserted ruins.</p>

<p>In a short time, the knights, apparently to
shun the noise of their followers, quitted that
part of the area, and walked nearer the
aperture, within which Genevieve withdrew
herself, while every word of their conference
came to her distinctly in the stillness of the
night. The younger appeared at first to be rebuking
the elder, for addressing him by some
title that he wished to disclaim.&mdash;"Be it as

<!-- vol 4 page 76 -->

thou wilt, Sir Knight of the Lilies," said
the other, who happened to be our old friend
Sir Aymer&mdash;"but what dost thou mean by
this masking? Why art thou thus disguised
at the head of a valiant, potent band?"&mdash;"To
accomplish two the dearest purposes I cherish,"
answered the other: "to deceive my
father, and to confront and confound that
proud prelate of Toulouse."</p>

<p>"That children should deceive their parents,"
said Sir Aymer, "is doubtless the law
of nature, or of custom, which comes to the
same thing. I had that virtue in my youth,
but let that pass. Wherefore chafest thou
so hotly against the warlike prelate?"&mdash;"I
hate him&mdash;hate him deadly," answered the
younger speaker, inhaling the air as he
spoke, like a reined and impatient steed.
"The throne of King Philip is but a toy&mdash;an
infant's bauble; while its power, if not
its seat, is shared by his insolent, encroaching
vassals, the Bishop of Toulouse and Count
Simon de Montfort. How the proud prelate
will chafe when he sees <i>who</i> leads the lances

<!-- vol 4 page 77 -->

of King Philip."&mdash;"Men say he rides at the
head of two thousand lances himself," answered
Sir Aymer; "and thinkest thou he
will lightly yield them to another leader?"&mdash;"Lightly
or not, he <i>shall</i> yield them," said the
other fiercely; "the bull may bellow in his
grange, but he will tremble when he hears
the lion roar, and feels that he has dared to
cross his path."&mdash;"Royal whelp," said Sir
Aymer, "take heed that thou roar not too
loud, ere thy fangs and claws be fully grown."</p>

<p>The other was silent for a moment, and
then said in a voice almost choked with passion&mdash;"By
Heaven, Sir Knight de Chastelroi,
thou dost not suffer the privilege my indulgence
has allowed thee of being my reprover
to go into abeyance."&mdash;"Jesters are allowed
their privilege, my liege," said Sir Aymer;
"and perchance the office of a jester and a
reprover are always the same; at least they
are both alike the subjects of scorn and
of neglect. But, meanwhile, spend not thy
spleen on me, Sir Knight of the Lilies; hoard
it all up for the Bishop of Toulouse. If all

<!-- vol 4 page 78 -->

report says be true, he will have enough to
hoard and vent in his turn: all provocation
that thou canst give him is light compared with
that which awaits him."&mdash;"How meanest
thou?" said the other impatiently.&mdash;"Even
what I say, my liege: report reached me on
the way, that Simon de Montfort himself is
on his journey hither, and that his warlike
dame hath flung plaster and cataplasm,
cullis and cordial, at the leech's head, and
braced him in iron from head to heel. Some
ears have heard his trumpets; but that must
be by witchcraft."&mdash;"Now, by Heaven! I
should wish to hear them this moment," replied
the interlocutor. "Ha! goes the
game there?&mdash;then have I to confront the
haughty prelate in his pride, and the brutal
De Montfort in his borrowed power. The
thought stirs my blood. Methinks we resemble
three streams that I have seen falling
from the mountains, narrow, feeble, and
chafing with their rocky banks; but when
they dashed into the valley, and met together
conflicting, how loud was their uproar, how

<!-- vol 4 page 79 -->

fierce their encounter!&mdash;the spray ascending
up the silent rocks from which they fell, and
the roar heard and felt among the mountains,
which the conflict shook to their bases."&mdash;"It
may be a magnificent metaphor," said
Sir Aymer; "but in my poor opinion it
resembles more what I have seen in a <i>morality</i>,
when the fool, iniquity, and the devil,
after playing their several passions, met at
last on the stage, and belaboured each other,
to the huge contentment of the audience. A
merry, mad world," Sir Aymer added, half
sighing, half whistling apart to himself,
"when three bands of the Crusaders meet
to destroy the heretics, and then pause first
to ask, whether they must not previously
knock out each other's brains?"&mdash;"But thou
wilt stand by me," said the younger knight;
"thou wilt doubtless stand by me:" he
spoke doubtingly.&mdash;"With heart and brand,
with life and limb, my liege," answered Sir
Aymer; and when he had thus spoken with
all the energy of feudal faith and chivalric
loyalty, he added some light words, intimating

<!-- vol 4 page 80 -->

the facility with which females might be
won, when the approaching war must make
wooers scarce.</p>

<p>The other speaker appeared to withdraw
from the topic with that disgust which youth
feels at the ill-affected follies of age&mdash;"By
Heaven," he said, "thou preachest better than
a Dominican, for thou dost thoroughly distaste
one of sin and folly. To hear one so old
and yet so vicious, is merely a disgust to
youth."&mdash;"<i>I</i> vicious? I defy thee," said
Sir Aymer, "prove me such, and I will abide
thy questioning."&mdash;"Darest thou deny that
thou canst over-drink even the Abbot of Normoutier&mdash;that
most bibulous and misquoting
churchman?"&mdash;"The church gives both example
and precept," quoth Sir Aymer: "Some
choose the former, and some the latter: for
myself, I adopt the example, not the precept,
of the church; and on that quarrel I will fight
while there is a grape to be pressed in Languedoc."&mdash;"That
thou wilt game with a
page, cheat with a jongleur, and lie with a
palmer who pretendeth that he hath been in
the land of Armeny?"&mdash;"The former was a

<!-- vol 4 page 81 -->

churchly vice, the latter a princely one; for I
have heard <i>thee</i> forswear thyself at tennis like a&mdash;&mdash;;
but all simile fails. Proceed; I have no
doubt to prove myself virtuous at the last."&mdash;"That
thou art a most unconscionable?&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Nay,
thou art the devil reproving sin.
Whereto tends this goodly masque thou art
acting this night? Wherefore art thou apart
from thy train amid these solitary ruins?
And what means that damsel in the nook
(the beatings of whose heart I can hear as I
walk), whom thou didst bear away to-day from
her guide and champion? Ha, my royal hawk,
thou art about to pounce on thy quarry, and
yet reproving a poor mousing owl like me,
that am fain to blink for my prey sometimes
in a barn."&mdash;His companion laughed vehemently
at the reprisal of the old knight, and
then swore deeply that nothing pleased him
more in the adventure than sending her champion
on a wild emprize to tilt against a tower
inhabited by spirits&mdash;"By our Lady of Notre
Dame," he cried, "unless I had that fanatic
dotard, that Monk of Montcalm, to aid me

<!-- vol 4 page 82 -->

with his tales of witchcraft, and I know not
what, I never could have won that saucy
stripling (who hath not a hair on his cheek,
though he presumes to love) to sever from her
side."&mdash;"Speak not so lightly of spirits and
witchcraft, 'specially in this lonely place," said
Sir Aymer, crossing himself; "thou art not an
infidel! Marry this darkness and loneliness
were enough to convert a man." (The train had
retired, and a single solitary torch shed its light
over the vast extent of the area.)&mdash;"An infidel!
I scorn thy words: I am about to convert
a heretic, and when I have taught her
her creed, thou shalt confirm her in it."&mdash;Sir
Aymer laughed again, and then demanded, in
a careless tone, if he knew the name of the
knight whom he had robbed of his prize with
the unconscious help of the Monk of Montcalm.&mdash;"Name,"
repeated the other; "name&mdash;methinks
they call him Sir Amirald."</p>

<p>The steps of Sir Aymer were instantly checked,
and his tone altered. "Sir Amirald," he repeated;
"he who fell in our mad encounter
with the Albigeois headed by Raymond of
Toulouse."&mdash;"Ay,&mdash;fell like thee and many
others, to rise again."&mdash;"He who did good service

<!-- vol 4 page 83 -->

to Queen Ingelberg, pleading in her
cause on an occasion thou wottest of."&mdash;"He
was overpaid by a kiss of the queen's hand;&mdash;a
landless, birthless, nameless, nothing&mdash;knighted
for some mad exploit of chivalry."&mdash;"I
heard he saved the life of King Philip at
the battle of Bovines," said Sir Aymer, with
increasing emphasis: "was that the mad deed
of chivalry thou speakest of?"&mdash;"And if he
did," answered the other, "his exploit, as thou
lovest to term it, prevented the crown of
France from descending on a brow that
would have worn it better. Deemest thou
I owe him deep obligation for such exploit?"
and he dwelt on the word maliciously.</p>

<p>"Sir Knight of the Lilies," said Sir Aymer,
"since such it is thy pleasure to be called,
here I pause. I have a foolish fondness for
that boy, and somehow cannot bear to see
him wronged. Were it the loose leman of
a common youth; but no, no&mdash;I cannot
brook this."&mdash;"What dost thou, what <i>darest</i>
thou mean?" said the other in wrath: "is
not the boy a plebeian?&mdash;is not the maiden a
heretic?"&mdash;"Plebeian&mdash;heretic&mdash;what thou

<!-- vol 4 page 84 -->

wilt," answered Sir Aymer; "she is to me
as sacred in yonder nook, as an enshrined
nun in her cloister: and I say, Sir Knight of
the Lilies, that in <i>her</i> cause, her champion
and protector being absent by base fraud&mdash;fraud,
mark me&mdash;I will wield brand against
a host!"&mdash;"Traitor-knight!" exclaimed the
other, "wilt thou turn thy brand against thy&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Not
for my life!" answered Sir Aymer,
sheathing the sword he had half drawn.
"But this I say, that if thou doest young
Amirald such deep wrong, never more will
Sir Aymer and his fifty faithful lances ride by
thy standard&mdash;never more will&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Hence,
dotard, with thy threats!" said the other,
stamping in fury: "hence with thyself, thy
menace, and thy men-at-arms! and in thine
absence I will have leisure to weigh which I
hold in the greater disdain." He broke from
Sir Aymer as he spoke, and in a moment
after Genevieve had the horror to see him
burst into the recess where she sat, his inflamed
visage and flashing eye betokening
that the late conference had done aught but

<!-- vol 4 page 85 -->

assuage the passions that already burned too
fiercely. His first impression was evidently
that of awe&mdash;the awe that the presence of
perfect beauty inspires; and he stood before
her, now first seen, like one who has broken
into a sanctuary to plunder it, and, dazzled
by the glory of the holy ornaments, stands
amazed at his intended sacrilege. Genevieve
was the first to recover herself, and assume,
at least, the courage necessary for speaking.
"Noble knight," she said tremulously, "I
thank you for your care of me in my journey,
and for my quiet though somewhat
lonely lodgment here; and I crave to know
when I may be permitted to rejoin my party;
when my thanks shall be doubled&mdash;yea, trebled?"
And in agonizing sincerity she pressed
her hands on her bosom.&mdash;"Fair maiden,"
said the youth, gathering courage from her
sweet and timid accents, from which he drew
a favourable but false augury of the pliancy
of her character,&mdash;"fair maiden, thy thanks
are most grateful guerdon; but, perchance,
I may ambition a higher and dearer reward."&mdash;"The

<!-- vol 4 page 86 -->

thanks of a noble knight shall be
added to mine," said Genevieve, in a voice
still more earnest, "for the protection vouchsafed
to his deserted companion."&mdash;"<i>His</i>
thanks?" repeated the youth, in a tone of
high disdain; "his thanks? Yes, he owes
me much, and thou dost well to turn me over
to him for payment; but I mean in his absence
to exact it from a fairer debtor."&mdash;"If
thou meanest my ransom, Sir Knight," said
Genevieve, who struggled with her own conviction
to misunderstand him, "and if thou
wilt deign to accept ransom for one of
nameless birth, it shall be paid. I have
jewels&mdash;jewels of price: all, all shall be
placed in thine hands, so thou wilt restore
me to my friends in safety and honour."
And at this moment she would indeed
have willingly placed the costly gift of the
queen in his hands, on the conditions she
named.&mdash;"I will accept thy ransom," said
the youth approaching her, "when thou
canst shew me a ruby with a tint like thy
lip, or a diamond with a beam like thine

<!-- vol 4 page 87 -->

eye; or, would I had not to add, a pearl
pale and precious as thy cheek." Her cheek
was indeed pale.&mdash;"Noble knight," she cried,
no longer daring to misunderstand him,
"noble knight, have mercy on me!" and
she fell on her face at his feet.&mdash;"Mercy
on thee!" said the youth, walking a few
paces from her, and evidently embarrassed
at her appeal,&mdash;"mercy on thee! And what
mercy hast thou on me? Is not each word,
each look, each movement, doing the work
of many daggers on mine heart? Maiden,
thou hast bowed thyself before me: I bow
to thee in my turn; and, trust me, no common
suppliant pleads. Pity, and love me."&mdash;"Oh,
Amirald! where art thou?" cried Genevieve,
in agony unutterable.&mdash;"Amirald
again!" said the youth with fierce impatience:
"what, is thy fancy so weak and worthless,
dwelling on that boy&mdash;that stripling,
blushing and beardless? <i>Thou</i> for whom, but for
thy plebeian birth and accursed creed, the
lances of every knight from Nismes to
Paris might be shivered, and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Oh,

<!-- vol 4 page 88 -->

let them be my advocates!" cried Genevieve&mdash;"my
lowly birth, my hated creed; let them
plead for me! I am unworthy of thy meanest thought,
noble knight: spurn me&mdash;dismiss
me&mdash;crush me to the earth!"</p>

<p>"And <i>Amirald</i>," said the youth, pacing
the narrow recess furiously&mdash;"Amirald?&mdash;no 
Sir Amirald:&mdash;it is plain whence such
familiar speech hath its rise between a heretic
peasant and a belted knight."&mdash;"Believe
that too," said Genevieve; "believe all that
is vile of me&mdash;all that can make me unworthy
of thee."&mdash;"And if I did," said her
companion, "yet hardly can I believe it,"
he added, gazing on her pure and pallid
beauty: "and if I did, darest thou play the
coy one with <i>me</i>, when by thine own confession
thou hast acted other part with that
stripling, that boy?"&mdash;"Oh no, no," cried
Genevieve in agony; "I wronged, I belied
him: he is innocent as I am: disregard, disdain
me&mdash;but doubt not of the truth and
loyalty of Sir Amirald."&mdash;"So much zeal
for one without name, without descent,

<!-- vol 4 page 89 -->

without lineage, and all under the name
of gratitude!" said the youth, retreating from
her with a proud step, and measuring her
with a prouder eye. "What, then, canst thou
deny, under the name of <i>love</i>, to one who
wooes thee in the highest title that ever
reached the ear of plebeian damsel? The
fairest dames in France have courted the
distinction thou hast scorned. It is not
for me to sue. Vile peasant, thou may'st
count amongst the highest honours of thy
life, that of being the paramour of Lewis
the Dauphin of France."</p>

<p>At the word Genevieve uttered a shriek
of ecstasy. She sprang on her feet, and,
tearing the ring from her finger, cried,
"Art thou the Dauphin, Prince Lewis of
France? Then am I safe as the daughter
of King Philip in a warded tower, with
princes for her guard. Thou canst not destroy
the peace and fame of her who saved
thy mother's life! The scar is on my breast&mdash;the
ring is in thine hand&mdash;the proof is in
thine heart!" she exclaimed, with increasing

<!-- vol 4 page 90 -->

energy, as she saw Prince Lewis bend over
the ring, which she almost forced into his
hand. "Oh, never can the son destroy the
preserver of the mother! Approach&mdash;touch
me now, if thou darest!" Then her enthusiasm
subsiding, and her habitual feelings of
submission to lofty rank recurring&mdash;"Oh no,
if thou <i>canst</i>&mdash;&mdash;," she cried sinking on her
knees before the Dauphin.</p>

<p>Prince Lewis, agitated by many feelings,
in silence held the ring to the light afforded
by the torch, and examined it closely. The
report of his mother's deliverance, and
escape by aid of the courage of a female
prisoner, had reached him. He had heard
also the report, which perhaps touched
him nearer, of Sir Amirald being appointed
as the protector of a fair heretic, on her
progress to join her friends at Toulouse, and
had immediately resolved to be a personal
judge of that beauty whose fame was so fair;
but he had not expected to behold in that female
the preserver of his mother; on whom,
amid all his licentious propensities and fiery

<!-- vol 4 page 91 -->

passions, he doted fondly. "It is true," he
said at length, "thou hast given a pledge
which shall be nobly redeemed, maiden.
Thou art the preserver of our mother; I acknowledge
the ring of queen Ingelberg.
Rise; thou art as safe as if thou wert the
daughter of Philip of France, in a royal
castle. Why dost thou tremble? The faith of
a knight, the honour of a prince, are pledged
for thy safety. Rise, and receive this hand in
pledge that thy honour is valued as mine own."</p>

<p>"Princely Dauphin&mdash;royal lord," cried
Genevieve, writhing in ecstasies of gratitude
still at his feet, and struggling to kiss the
border of his mantle. As he withdrew it,
her lips touched his hand. "Forbear, forbear,"
said Prince Lewis; "such gratitude is
dangerous. Forbear:"&mdash;and yet his fingers
again sought the caress. "And may I not," he
said, "may I not yet gaze on thee, as
I should on a portrait? may I not gaze
on thee as I should on a sacred image?"&mdash;"Royal
lord," said Genevieve shrinking, "I
pray you suffer me to depart: it is easy to form

<!-- vol 4 page 92 -->

a generous resolution, but it is most difficult
to keep it."&mdash;"By Heaven," said Prince
Lewis, "I begin to feel the truth of what
thou sayest in every vein. Ho, my bannerman,
Eustache!" he cried, "where is Sir
Aymer? hath he quitted these walls?"&mdash;"He
walks discontentedly, some few paces hence,
my liege," said Eustache. "Summon him
on the instant! Sir Aymer," he said, as the
old knight slowly and reluctantly approached&mdash;"Sir
Aymer, thou hast done the devoir
of a loyal friend and true knight in chiding
me; and I will do that of a prince in requital.
I hold in my hand," taking Genevieve's,
"a fair pledge for thy fealty; and if
thy faith to me depend on the safe and
honourable usage of this damsel, Sir Aymer
and his fifty lances will be at the Dauphin's
side again to-morrow. Wilt thou be thyself
the protector of the maiden?"&mdash;"In
faith, my liege," answered the knight, "had
I not seen the dame, I might have undertaken
such office; but as it is, does
your Grace think me marble, or a mummy, that
you trust me with a charge that

<!-- vol 4 page 93 -->

St. Anthony's temptations were very snowballs
to."</p>

<p>Prince Lewis smiled internally at the
success of his stratagem; for he well
knew when he made the proposal, that Sir
Aymer, in his affectation of youthful gallantry,
would decline it. "How shall I
bestow thee, damsel?" he said with assumed
perplexity. "Thine accursed creed forbids
thee the shelter of a nunnery, and I know
none of my train with whom thou mightest
be in safe keeping, till the return of young
Amirald. Eustache," he cried, giving his
bannerman a look which he well understood,
"seek out some grave and well-reputed
matron in the town, and place the damsel
with her till&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Thanks and blessings,"
interrupted Genevieve, pressing her lips to
the hem of his mantle; then dropping her
veil, she gave her hand to her new conductor.</p>

<p>Prince Lewis turned hastily, like one
who wrests away his mind abruptly from
some unpleasant thoughts, and, accosting Sir
Aymer, as if he wished to divert his attention

<!-- vol 4 page 94 -->

also, he pointed to where a few streaks
of grey in the clouds indicated the approach
of morning. "Be those clouds," he said,
"that gather so darkly on yonder hill?"&mdash;"If
they be," answered his companion, "they
are clouds that will burst in thunder soon.
In that very line is the Bishop of Toulouse
marching by credible report; and, as I look,
methinks those clouds change their places
like the forms of men in motion."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the trampling of horses was
heard, and Bernard de Vaugelas and Pierre de
Limosin were seen riding at full speed towards
them. They checked their steeds when
they saw the Dauphin,&mdash;"Tidings my liege,
and of high concernment," they cried, alighting
from their horses.&mdash;"First, welcome, gentlemen
and friends," said Lewis; "and next
for your tidings."&mdash;"We seek your Highness
by command of your royal mother," said
Vaugelas, "who detached us from her train
for the purpose."&mdash;"How fares our dearest
mother?" said Lewis.&mdash;"Well; and commends
her to your Highness: and we have
ridden two hours before the dawn, to bring

<!-- vol 4 page 95 -->

you tidings that the Bishop of Toulouse is at
hand with fifteen hundred lances at his back."&mdash;"And
<i>we</i> are here, prepared to give him
welcome," replied the Dauphin.&mdash;"He hath
marched with such speed, that he was fain
to halt with his overwearied band on yonder
hill&mdash;(Prince Lewis cast a look of defiance
and enmity in the direction);&mdash;and thy careful
mother enjoins thee to beware the meeting
with that proud and potent prelate."&mdash;"That
is a woman's counsel," said the Dauphin.
"What is thine, De Limosin?"&mdash;"That your
Highness beard and brave the hot churchman
in his pride. He is to enter the town by
dawn, to celebrate the mass in the cathedral
of Nismes; and then to offer himself as
leader of the armies of the church, to the
assembled knights and peers."&mdash;"Ho, mine
armour!" cried Lewis, starting as from a
trance; "mine armour, knave!"&mdash;"Your
Highness is already armed," said Vaugelas,
"as well by the presence of your faithful
knights as by your stoutest harness."&mdash;"I
meant not that," said Lewis, vexed at perceiving

<!-- vol 4 page 96 -->

that his emotion was observed; "I
meant that this armour was too heavy. I
must haste to my lodging to change it.
Where is Eustache? but I sent him on other
errand. This news hath bewildered me, I
think," he added with a forced smile. "Noble
knights, gentlemen, friends, may I depend
on your aid on the morrow, when we meet
the proud prelate?"&mdash;"As firmly as on the
brand your Highness leans on," answered the
knights.&mdash;"I must haste to the town," said
Lewis; "I must rouse and summon my noble
friends to join me on the morrow: the <i>morrow?</i>
by Heaven, it is already bright dawn!
There is not a moment to be lost: Sir Aymer,
thou wilt with us?"&mdash;"So please you, my
liege," said Sir Aymer, "I have had somewhat
a restless night, and have also a foreboding
that to-morrow will be a doubtful if
not a bloody day; and methinks I would
willingly secure some mortal rest in this
world, before I am dismissed to my final one."&mdash;"Come
then with me, De Vaugelas, and
noble De Limosin; your spirits are untired:

<!-- vol 4 page 97 -->

come with me, and let us try if a son of
France or a shaveling churchman hath most
influence with her noble and puissant chivalry."&mdash;"We
wait on your highness, and demand
but to be put to the proof," said the
knights.&mdash;"If I meet Sir Amirald," said Sir
Aymer, "I will bid him haste to your aid, my
liege."&mdash;"And when I am king of France,
I will appoint thee to the office of my jester
in requital," answered Prince Lewis, as he
hastened toward the town, where all that
morning he toiled among the knights and
peers who had followed his standard, exacting
renewed oaths of fidelity, and receiving
assurances of it, grounded more on their
hatred to the Bishop of Toulouse than on their
attachment to the ambitious, voluptuous, and
vindictive Dauphin. In these anxious conferences
two hours passed away, and the
morning sun broke on the city of Nismes.</p>

<br/>

<p>BY its earliest light the Bishop of Toulouse
and his train had ridden into the city. Immediately
on his arrival he hasted to the cathedral
to celebrate mass; but as he passed
through the aisle, he was struck by the sight
of a number of knights, who were ranged like
statues on either side, completely armed and
with their visors closed; and who returned
slight or rather no obeisance to the bishop,
as he marched amid a train of nobles and
ecclesiastics towards the altar. Their appearance
caught the eye of the bishop as he passed
on amid ranks of bowing churchmen and
kneeling knights craving his benediction,
which he dispensed with due solemnity, and

<!-- vol 4 page 99 -->

then, as he approached the altar, and prepared
to change his robes for the ceremony,
sent his crosier-bearer to demand of
the knights why they assumed such hostile
and unwonted guise in the church. The
knights answered not a word, and kept their
visors down. The ceremony began: again a
messenger was dispatched to require them to
depart, if they joined not in external devotion
at least, while the holy mysteries were celebrating.
The crosier-bearer, who delivered
the second message, seemed to himself, as he
said, to walk amid the pillars of a cathedral,
so stern, erect, and motionless stood the
figures; and he returned with another report
of the impenetrable silence of the unknown
knights.&mdash;The sacred bell was rung, and
every head and knee was bent to the earth
at the sound, but those of the party that filled
the aisle. At the conclusion of the ceremony,
which the bishop performed with imposing
dignity, yet not altogether without
some misgivings of heart, he prepared to address
the congregation, which was composed

<!-- vol 4 page 100 -->

of his own train of knights and men-at-arms,
(mixed with the troops of king Philip,) from
the altar where he stood; that his appeal
might want no influence of the spiritual
power in aid of the forces of the temporal,
with which he felt himself amply furnished.
His address, powerful and eloquent, was received
with loud acclamations by his own
party; and they were even echoed by some of
king Philip's troops, with whom the character
of the warlike prelate stood high. The
mute and visored figures who filled the aisle
of the cathedral were observed to exchange
whispers with each other at this latter sound.
"For you, noble knights," said the bishop,
"though your demeanour hath been somewhat
discourteous and full of mystery, though
ye have refused to raise your visors, or to
utter speech, or to join in the rites of holy
church, we honour you as the leaders of those
troops whom king Philip, that faithful son of
the church, hath sent in aid of her cause, now
at its utmost peril; and demand of you (and
such demand ye will perchance deign to

<!-- vol 4 page 101 -->

answer) to know to whose hands ye are commissioned
to entrust them?&mdash;A single knight
stepped forward, and stood in the centre of
the aisle, confronting the bishop as he stood
by the high altar, and without raising his
visor or altering his posture, answered, "To
the hands of him who led them here."&mdash;"And
who is he?" demanded the bishop.&mdash;"Lewis,
the dauphin of France," said the
knight, raising his visor, while all the knights
of his train at the signal made a similar disclosure;
and the Bishop of Toulouse beheld
around him the countenances of many of
the noblest and the most hostile peers
and knights of France.</p>

<p>For a moment his presence of mind forsook
him. He had believed Prince Lewis
far distant, waging unsuccessful war in England,
and wasting his time and troops before
Dover Castle, in consequence of the
reproach of King Philip, who, on the mention
of his son's exploits and successes in
England, remarked, he had not yet got
<i>its key</i>. Yet Prince Lewis was on the spot
confronting him, and at the head of Philip's

<!-- vol 4 page 102 -->

troops. For a moment, we say, his self-possession
forsook him; but in the next he recovered
himself, and descending from the
steps of the altar, advanced to meet the Dauphin.&mdash;"My
liege prince and future sovereign,"
he said with dignity, "we greet you
well with the homage of true hearts and
strong hands, armed alike in the cause of
your royal house and of the church. But
wherefore hath your grace come upon us
thus in disguise?"&mdash;"Lord bishop," said
prince Lewis, with somewhat of a grim smile,
"men ever go to a doubtful feast masked."
The Bishop of Toulouse passed on to greet
the knights of Prince Lewis's train; and it
was admirable to see the address with which
he hailed those whom he deemed the most
accessible, and the dignity with which he met
the most hostile; while from time to time he
bent his ear to a lame and diminutive figure
who hobbled beside him, and seemed to be
playing the fool amid the magnificent pageantry
of that ecclesiastical drama. This
was no other than Sir Ambrose, (the <i>ci-devant</i>

<!-- vol 4 page 103 -->

Deacon Mephibosheth,) who was whispering
to him intelligence of which he resolved in
this exigency instantly to avail himself. The
ceremonial of meeting over, the bishop again
retired to the altar, near which Prince Lewis
and his train ranged themselves in firm and
steady line; and exalting his voice, "Nobles,
and knights of France," he cried, "I have
rendered the duty of a subject to the son of
my liege lord the king, and I must now render
it to the son of Him whose minister I
am, and in whose temple I stand. In <i>his</i>
cause we are armed, and his favour alone can
bid our banners float in triumph; but shall
we dare to hope for that favour if those banners
are grasped by the hand that caresses an
heretic? Yes, noble peers, ye well may look
amazed! Prince Lewis, who claims the honour
of leading you, nourishes in his bosom
a heretic concubine, and, stained with such
mortal sin, is unworthy to fight even among
the meanest ranks of the army of the church."</p>

<p>At this charge, the substance of which
had been overheard by Sir Ambrose in whispered

<!-- vol 4 page 104 -->

conversation among Prince Lewis's
knights, and had been instantly communicated
to the bishop, who seized on it as a
desperate defence in his extremity&mdash;at this
charge, a murmur was heard among the crusaders,
many of whom began to cast looks of
disdain and distrust on the Dauphin. Prince
Lewis's soul rushed to his face, not with shame,
but with rage; and, instead of addressing
the knights, he turned fiercely on the bishop.&mdash;"And
is it thou," he cried&mdash;"thou who
darest to reprove thy prince for lightness!"</p>

<p>"For thy foul slanders, prince," said the
bishop with an insolent affectation of meekness,
"thou hast my pity and my prayers.
Methinks the fair beauty, the lady Blanche,<sup id="ref047"><a href="#en047">47</a></sup>
and the respect thou owest to the royal
house of Castile, should recall thee from
wandering in quest of light and lawless
love."&mdash;"Insolent and meddling priest!" exclaimed
Lewis, maddening at being thus
checked and schooled in the presence of his

<!-- vol 4 page 105 -->

nobles, "what hast thou to do with thy
prince's domestic concerns, or with his royal
right? the which he will maintain in spite
and in scorn of thee! Judge, lords, how
lightly this proud churchman will prize your
honours, when he dares thus check your
sovereign in the presence of his subjects."&mdash;"Ungrateful
as thou art forgetful!" cried the
bishop, kindling in his turn&mdash;"is it thus thou
speakest of churchmen, to whom thy father
owes his throne and life? Who, at the battle
of Bovines, marshalled the array, and fought in
the van of King Philip's host?&mdash;who won the
day that else had seen King Philip throneless?&mdash;Guerin,
the warlike bishop of Senlis.<sup id="ref048"><a href="#en048">48</a></sup> Who,
on that day, armed only with a mace of iron,
(for the holy man would not draw sword, to
avoid the guilt of bloodshed,) felled to the
earth and made prisoner the stout Earl of
Salisbury?&mdash;Philip de Dreux, bishop of Beauvais.
And is it for <i>thee</i> to scoff at churchmen?
Profane prince, prouder heads and stouter

<!-- vol 4 page 106 -->

hearts than thine have bowed, and shall bow
yet, to their power. Remember Henry, emperor of Germany, doing penance barefoot and
in winter at the gates of a pontiff's castle."&mdash;"Where
the holy father," interrupted
Lewis, "was revelling with the Countess
Matilda."&mdash;"Out on thee, ribald&mdash;reviler!
Remember examples nearer home: remember
Henry of England, lashed by monks at the
tomb of the holy Becket; and his son John
kneeling, but as yesterday, to receive his crown,
at the footstool of the legate Pandulf."&mdash;"Remember
<i>thou</i> also," retorted Lewis, "the noble
letter of Eudes, duke of Burgundy, to my
father; wherein he counselled him neither to
make peace nor war at the command of pope
or cardinal; where he swore to aid him with
his vassals, treasure and right arm in their
spite, and to enter into no treaty with them
without his sovereign: remember the answer
of King Philip to thy master, pope Innocent,
that he owed his royaume to God and his
sword, and thought scorn to hold them by permission

of a priest.<sup id="ref049"><a href="#en049">49</a></sup> If our annals hold such
matter as thou hast quoted, (eternal shame to
the churchmen who write them!) their brighter
pages show many an example of high resolve.
and noble defiance to the insolence of priestly
power."&mdash;"Judge, peers of France," cried the
bishop, "how fit is he to lead the armies of
the church, who thus insults her minister and
defies her power! Hence, prince Dauphin;
waste if thou wilt the troops and treasures of
France in nameless exploits and fruitless conquests
on English land; but dream not of leading
the armies of the faithful. Men mocked
at the laxity of King John, when the deputies
of Rouen came to him to implore succours
for the last city that held out for him in Normandy,
and found him playing at chess; and
how much seemlier were it that the crusaders
should demand where was their leader, and
be answered, 'Dallying in his tent in the
arms of a cursed heretic.' "&mdash;"The heretic
shall be burnt," cried Sir Ambrose, (who had

<!-- vol 4 page 108 -->

not forgotten his rancour against the luckless
Genevieve;) "she shall be burnt with fire."&mdash;"Traitor-priest!"
cried Lewis, losing all self-command,
and laying his hand on his sword.&mdash;"Impious
prince," said the bishop, (while Sir
Ambrose retreated behind him,) "is it in the
house of God that thou assailest his servant?"</p>

<p>The knights interposed, and Prince Lewis,
sheathing his half-drawn sword and stamping
with fury, exclaimed in a choked voice, "How
long, my lords of France, will ye see your prince
baited by these cowled and mitred bloodhounds?
Is there a noble among you&mdash;a
<i>knight</i>&mdash;a <i>Frenchman</i>, gentlemen, who will
fight under other standard, when his sovereign's
is displayed? or join in other <i>cri
d'armes</i>, when the word is <i>Montjoie St.
Denis?</i>"</p>

<p>The last words, uttered with the utmost
power of the Dauphin's voice, were echoed
by all his train; and even by many of the
bishop's, who yielded to the feeling of the
moment: and the cathedral of Nismes, cloister,
aisle, and roof, rang to the cry of

<!-- vol 4 page 109 -->

<i>Montjoie St. Denis!</i> But at this moment,
louder than all the acclamations, was heard
the sound of trumpets blown at a short
distance, and announcing some distinguished
approach. The Bishop of Toulouse instantly
recognized the trumpets of the Count de
Montfort; for in those days, as it is said, every
one of high distinction had a blast or note
sounded peculiar to themselves, and which
was well known to hearers even at a remote
distance. The bishop's countenance
changed; but instantly commanding its expression,
and adopting the only alternative
of which the sudden and desperate emergency
allowed, he quitted his station by the
altar and advanced towards the Dauphin,
wisely judging that he could more easily
govern the volatile and impetuous Lewis
even at the head of an army, than Simon
de Montfort alone. As he advanced towards
the prince, who, suspecting the meaning of
this sudden movement, kept his hand on
his dagger,&mdash;"My liege prince," he said,
"here let our strife end. I yield me to thy

<!-- vol 4 page 110 -->

claim: I transfer mine own to strengthen
thine. Let us unite together against this
Simon de Montfort, who will else prove too
powerful for either singly. I will march
under the oriflamme of my sovereign, but
not beneath the banners of a subject."
Lewis gazed on him for a space, as one
would on some fierce animal, which, in the
act to spring on and rend him, suddenly
crouches at his feet, as dreading his treachery
not less than his fury: "Be it so,"
he cried at last, like one taken by surprise;
"but if thou playest me false!" The bishop
answered only by a significant gesture; and
while this short scene passed, the band of De
Montfort came pouring into the cathedral
church of Nismes: page, pursuivant, and
even herald&mdash;such was the royal state in
which Simon de Montfort rode&mdash;crowded into
the aisles, followed by the men-at-arms,
knights, and peers, who had gathered round
his standard; and last appeared De Montfort
himself. He entered the aisle slowly
and painfully, but still with an air of conscious

<!-- vol 4 page 111 -->

and habitual superiority: his hair and
beard were long and neglected; his features,
naturally harsh, and now squalid from long
illness, had almost a ghastly expression; and
this was increased by the swathes in which
his head was still bound. He wore his
armour, but with evident difficulty, as still
scarce able to bear its weight; and over
it, instead of a surcoat, was thrown a mantle
lined with miniver. His gigantic form
was bowed by infirmity; but, though he
moved with pain, he still tried to move
erect, and his hollow voice had abated nothing
of its usual haughty tone of command.</p>

<p>As he reached the centre of the aisle, and
stood leaning on his huge sword, and looking
round him with a portentous aspect of silent
inquiry, he seemed like the gigantic spectre
of some departed warrior, who had started
from the grave in arms as he lay, at the last
summons. The Bishop of Toulouse advanced
to meet him; while Prince Lewis whispered
to the knights, by whom he was surrounded,
and who had stood in amaze at the sudden accommodation

<!-- vol 4 page 112 -->

between the hostile prince and
prelate.</p>

<p>"My lord de Montfort," said the bishop,
"we greet you well; and joy to behold that,
though no longer able to lead the armies of
the church, you come, in your christian zeal,
to partake in her councils."&mdash;"I come," replied
De Montfort, rejecting the hand which
the bishop extended towards him, half in
greeting, half in benediction, and supporting
himself on his sword, "I come, lord bishop,
not to partake of your councils, but to maintain
my right&mdash;right that hath been wrested
from me in mine involuntary absence, and in
the forged and false belief of mine infirmity."&mdash;"Forged
belief!" repeated the bishop, crossing
himself, as he retreated in well-dissembled
amaze, and glancing a look of hypocritical
compassion around. "Alas! my lords, he
trembles as he speaks."</p>

<p>"If I tremble, it is with rage, not weakness,
injurious prelate," said De Montfort.
"But I see thy crafty aim: thou knowest
mine hot ungoverned humour, and wouldst
urge me to some wild speech or fierce act

<!-- vol 4 page 113 -->

that might work me dishonour in the eyes of
this fair assembly."&mdash;"An' I do not ere the
day be done," said the bishop internally, "I
will exchange my mitre for a coxcomb."&mdash;"Fair
assembly," cried the Dauphin,<sup id="ref050"><a href="#en050">50</a></sup> hotly
breaking in on the conference, "and fair example
in truth&mdash;where proud subjects meet to
debate on the rights of princes to lead their
own liege vassals to battle!"</p>

<p>"Boy!&mdash;princely boy!" said the veteran
chief, with hollow voice and tremulous action;
"I saw thee take the noble rank of
knight at Compiegne on the feast of Pentecost,
from the hand of thy royal father
Philip I heard thee sworn to <i>l'amour de
Dieu et des dames</i>."</p>

<p>"And I am a heretic," said Sir Aymer
half audibly, "if his highness fulfil not one
part of his vow to the letter."</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 114 -->

<p>"I was thy sponsor," continued De Montfort,
extending his wrinkled hand, "at the
font which a true knight holds sacred as that
of his baptism: and could I deem, when the
spur was buckled on thy heel, and the sword
first girded on thy stripling's thigh, that thou,
my <i>damoiseau</i>, my royal <i>varlet</i>,<sup id="ref051"><a href="#en051">51</a></sup> wouldst ever
draw it in quarrel against thy godfather-in-arms?"</p>

<p>Prince Lewis, touched by the recollection,
was silent for a moment. The Bishop of Toulouse
saw there was not a moment to be
lost: "And were it so," he cried, "what
avails thy tale of Compiegne and feasts of
Pentecost? Does that give thee a title to
usurp the Dauphin's power, and make thy
liege thy vassal? What right dost thou pretend
to in this fair assembly higher than that
of other loyal peers of France?&mdash;of me, for instance,
or of the nobles who surround us?"&mdash;"What
right?" cried De Montfort: "is the
question asked in jest or in scorn? I claim

<!-- vol 4 page 115 -->

the command of the armies of the church
(as thou well knowest, lord bishop) by commission
from thy master the Pope himself."&mdash;"The
holy father," said the bishop, "was
deceived by false reports, palliating if not
concealing thine infirmity of health, and other
causes that render such appointment null."&mdash;"<i>Other
causes!</i>" cried De Montfort, biting his
lip to repress his choler: "I claim it by consent,
yea by command, of King Philip of
France."&mdash;"He will revoke that consent,"
said Prince Lewis, "when he knows it prejudicial
alike to the interests of the church
and the honour of his son."&mdash;"I claim it, then,
in right of <i>this</i>," cried De Montfort, striking
his gauntleted hand on his sword, the blow
making the paved floor of the church ring
again: "and if that plea avail not," he added
with somewhat a tremor in his voice, "by
these, and these, and these;" and he pointed
proudly to the numerous wounds that his
armour concealed, but under whose effect he
was still evidently suffering.&mdash;"Tell also
where those wounds were received," said

<!-- vol 4 page 116 -->

the bishop tauntingly. "Even in that wild
battle to which thou led'st the chivalry of
France in thy pride, and where its flower fell&mdash;the
victims of thy mad counsel."&mdash;"God's
malison on thee, thou proud prelate!" cried
De Montfort, yielding to his choler; "art
thou, too, turned mine enemy? Ere I came
hither men told me the Dauphin and thou
were well nigh hurling your daggers at each
other's heads in deadly wrath, and do ye
now join together to bait me with your injuries
and reproaches?"&mdash;"I sought and obtained
the pardon of the holy prelate," said
Lewis somewhat suddenly, "for mine unadvised
speech."&mdash;"My royal son," said the
bishop with more graceful dissimulation, "it
was won ere it was asked." De Montfort
shook his head, as he viewed them both with
a stern but expressive smile,&mdash;"Prince and
prelate, crafty as ye are, and crafty ye are
as the fiend himself, ye do not deceive me:
ye cannot by your hollow truce deceive these
lords, who were witnesses but now to your
deadly feud, and all but mortal strife. Peers,

<!-- vol 4 page 117 -->

and knights of France," he cried, "will you
march under divided counsels and unfriendly
leaders, or under the sole and faithful guidance
of him, ye once named your Maccabee?"
And the voice of the veteran, weakened by
infirmity and emotion, faltered again: not
so the thousand voices that shouted, "A De
Montfort!&mdash;&agrave; De Montfort!" in answer.</p>

<p>"An' we make not in to the rescue, the
field is lost," whispered the bishop to Prince
Lewis:&mdash;"Out on thee," he thundered aloud,
"thou bloody chief! Thy cruelties have stained
the cause of the church, and brought defeat
and disgrace on our arms!"&mdash;"Dissembling
priest!" cried de Montfort kindling, "dost
<i>thou</i> name cruelty?&mdash;thou, who at the sack
of Lavaur didst chaunt the <i>Veni Creator</i>, with
thy clergy, to the shrieks of four hundred heretics
perishing in the flames!"<sup id="ref052"><a href="#en052">52</a></sup>&mdash;"Their
crime merited such punishment," interposed
the bishop; "but thy cruelties were wanton

<!-- vol 4 page 118 -->

as they were needless&mdash;the fruits of thy dark
and bloody soul. Remember the foul assassination
of the Count of Beziers!&mdash;heretic as
he was, he was thy prisoner, entrusted to
thine honour!"&mdash;"The murder of the lady
of Lavaur!" cried Lewis, "flung by thine
order or thy hand into a pit, and whelmed
with stones&mdash;the murder of a noble lady,
thou stain to chivalry!"&mdash;"Thy sworn and
solemn truce with the Count de Foix, ordained
by the council of Lateran, violated in
wanton perfidy!" exclaimed the bishop.&mdash;"Nor
is thy perfidy less than thy pride!"
continued Lewis, "<i>Simon en nom, et roi en
faict</i>.<sup id="ref053"><a href="#en053">53</a></sup>"&mdash;"And thy rapacity surpassing
both!" pursued the bishop, giving him no
rest: "thou, who didst force the heiress of
Bigorre from the arms of her wedded and
rightful lord, and compel her to espouse thy
son, that ye might seize and share her ample
dower!"</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 119 -->

<p>At this detail of the well-known enormities
of Count Simon, a murmur spread even
among his own train; and those who had hitherto
stood nearest him, began, as in shame,
to fall from his side.</p>

<p>De Montfort looked round him with a
wild and vacant glare: his passions, always
violent, in this desperate moment of shame
and anguish utterly overpowered his reason;
a kind of delirium seized him, and unsheathing
his dagger, while he shouted "A De
Montfort! &agrave; De Montfort!" he rushed to
where Prince Lewis stood. The movement
was so rapid and unlooked-for, that the blow,
though aimed by the hand of a madman,
might have been fatal, had not a young
knight thrown himself between De Montfort
and the Dauphin, and received it himself.
It pierced between the joints of the vant-brace
to his shoulder, and the blood burst
from the wound.</p>

<p>At sight of the blood, which all believed
to be that of the prince, a cry of consternation
and horror burst from the whole assembly:

<!-- vol 4 page 120 -->

shouts of "Treason! treason!" and
"Make fast the gates!" resounded on every
side, and all parties hastened to gather round
the Dauphin. In the tumult, the attendants
of De Montfort found means to bear him
away, still struggling, but exhausted; and
his band of knights and followers, unable
to justify the outrage they had witnessed
with horror, departed to a man.</p>

<p>"I will after him on the instant," cried
the bishop to Prince Lewis; "and while his
blood is warm, I will paint to him his guilt
in such horrors as shall make him deem the
concession of his claim but light atonement
for such deadly crime."&mdash;"After him, then,
my noble friend," answered the Dauphin,
"and St. Denis to speed!" Then as the bishop
departed with his train, "False priest!" he
murmured, "I trust thee as I love thee;
but where is the youth who preserved me
from the arm of that mad assassin?" he
cried, looking round him.&mdash;"Here, my liege,"
answered a youthful voice; while the speaker,

<!-- vol 4 page 121 -->

making low obeisance, and raising his casque,
disclosed the features of Sir Amirald.</p>

<p>Lewis recoiled as if stung by an adder:
he recovered himself, however, sufficiently to
wave the knights who surrounded him to a
distance; then in a hurried voice, "How
now!" he said, "so soon returned?"&mdash;"In most
happy time, my liege, did I return to meet
the peril that menaced your grace."&mdash;"And
you found the tower of Hugo empty?" cried
Lewis, though Amirald had not said so.&mdash;"As
empty," answered the youth with emphasis,
"as your grace's promise of safe conduct
and honourable usage for my hapless
companion."&mdash;"Sir boy," said Lewis, haughtily,
"presume not, on the slight service
thou hast rendered us, to deem that we
will brook such look or language from a subject:
but I see whence this strange boldness
springs&mdash;thou lovest this errant damsel
thyself. 'Tis well and so thou provest
thy loyalty as knight, by upbraiding thy
prince; and thy faith as Crusader, by daring

<!-- vol 4 page 122 -->

to love a heretic. Thou wouldst marry
her too, I warrant, in thy romance of honourable
love. Now, by St. Denis, I will
keep the damsel in my custody, were it
but to prevent such foul disgrace to the
Church's cause."&mdash;"It will be more dishonoured,
prince," replied the youth, "when
a helpless and lonely maiden is the victim of
a Crusader's violence and wrong."</p>

<p>"Avoid my presence!" said Lewis, stamping,
"lest <i>she</i> prove not mine <i>only</i> victim,
as thou darest to term it. By Heaven,
I am well schooled between a hoary ruffian
and a beardless stripling! Hold&mdash;stay&mdash;come
back," he cried, as the youth,
giving him a look that subjects sometimes
can give, and princes sometimes must bear,
was retiring,&mdash;"Come back, I say." Then
with a struggle between pride and fear,
"I doubt not thou wilt make this mad love
of thine an excuse for deserting the cause of
thy prince."&mdash;"No, my liege," answered the
youth with a melancholy firmness; "my sovereign's
forgetting his duty can never absolve

<!-- vol 4 page 123 -->

his subject. I will fight beneath thy
standard with a wrung, but loyal heart; and
though in the anguish of my soul I think
you a tyrant, and dare tell you so, never
I will I whisper such a sound in another
ear, or brook to hear it from another lip."&mdash;"Shame,
shame," cried Sir Aymer, who had
ventured to linger near, "that such faith
should meet such guerdon! Call him back,
call him back, my liege. How can a son of
France bear to be outdone in honour by his
liege-man?"</p>

<p>"Royal lord," cried Amirald, returning
uncalled, and bending his knee to Lewis,
"be generous, and restore the maiden."&mdash;"Prince,"
said Sir Aymer, with unusual
spirit&mdash;"prince, be just, and wrong not her
who saved thy mother's life."</p>

<p>Lewis struggled for a moment with his passions;
but, though he could conceive, he had
not mental strength to realize their subjection,
and rending his mantle from the grasp
of Sir Aymer, he exclaimed, "No, I cannot&mdash;by
Heaven, I cannot resign her!" and

<!-- vol 4 page 124 -->

rushed away.&mdash;"Courage yet," cried Sir
Aymer: "if she is between heaven and
earth, she shall be found; and if found,
restored."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Genevieve had been conveyed
by her conductors to a detached and secluded
apartment in the lodgings occupied
by the Prince and his immediate attendants,
in the town. Though Lewis resolved to
employ only persuasion with his prisoner,
he could not carry his generosity farther;
but determined, at every risk, to keep her
concealed from Sir Amirald. In the meanwhile
he availed himself of every opportunity,
which the stormy debates of the Crusaders
allowed him, to visit her,&mdash;employing
all the eloquence of passion and of power,
and in violent importunity even prostrating
himself before her; her beauty, purity,
and unprotected helplessness, alternately
urging and disarming him. These visits
were the only interruption to her solitude.</p>

<p>It was on the fourth evening of her
confinement that at a late hour the door

<!-- vol 4 page 125 -->

of her apartment was burst open, and
Prince Lewis rushed in; his visage inflamed,
and his hair and robes deranged, as if from
the consequences of a personal struggle.
He gazed on her, and then striking his
forehead with an agonizing expression of
self-reproach, he exclaimed: "Come with
me this moment, maiden&mdash;if, indeed, a moment
yet be left thee!"&mdash;"And whither
must I now go?" said Genevieve, as she
rose and stood trembling before him.&mdash;"Stay
not to ask&mdash;stay not to speak," he
cried; "a moment's delay may cost thy
life!"&mdash;"My life!" she said, with a faint
smile&mdash;"is that all? Then, Sir knight, I
quit not this spot:" but her heart recoiling
as she spoke, "And am I, indeed, to
perish, and so soon?" she said: "and cannot
even Sir Amirald save me?"</p>

<p>"Sir Amirald save thee&mdash;thee whom a son
of France is unable to rescue even for an hour!"
exclaimed Lewis. "Frantic and obstinate girl,
hear and believe thy peril and <i>my</i> shame:&mdash;I
was this night at a feast held by the

<!-- vol 4 page 126 -->

Bishop of Toulouse; a feast of reconciliation he
termed it&mdash;aught but that was in his fiendish
thoughts. As we sat, tidings came that some
of the most potent lords in Languedoc were
taking arms in defence of their vassals, amongst
whom the cursed heresy of thy people rages.
At the word, every sword sprang from its
sheath, every eye was fixed on me, every
tongue hailed me champion of the Church&mdash;the
title for which I would have forfeited life&mdash;for
which I had well nigh lost it to De Montfort.
But even De Montfort ceded his claim; the
bishop employed his only to strengthen mine.
I believed him all sincere; but the subtle and
bloody prelate had been dealing deeply with
the Crusaders. He hates thee deadly, maiden,
I know not wherefore: he had sworn them
to a man: I shame to tell thee, their absurd
and savage superstition required that I should
yield thee up to perish ere a knight would
stand by my banner: they assailed, they implored,
they beset me, inflamed as I was with
wine, intoxicated with power, and I"&mdash;&mdash;"Yielded,"

<!-- vol 4 page 127 -->

said Genevieve, fixing on him her
mild dark eyes. "Alas! Sir knight; and to
honour, to humanity, thou wouldst not yield
me, and to the first call of mad and selfish
ambition I am doomed to be the sacrifice!"&mdash;"No,
by Heaven, maiden," cried Lewis;
"scarce had the mad words passed my lips
when I retracted them: through menace,
through injury, through indignity that I blush
to have survived, I burst from their accursed
feast. Two of the faithfulest of my train
still guard the postern, and will make good
the passage with their lives, while I bear thee
to some safer retreat, where their ruthless and
brutal rage shall be matter of scorn to us.
Maiden," he cried, watching her moveless features,
fixed in horror at the thought&mdash;"maiden,
for thee a son of France has forgotten his
rank, his rights, himself; and dost thou dare
to hesitate who hast nothing to risk? But thou
shalt not be allowed the choice."&mdash;"Prince,"
said Genevieve, retreating as he approached
her,&mdash;"prince, thou gavest thine oath but yesterday,

<!-- vol 4 page 128 -->

in mercy to my terrors, that I should
suffer no farther violence at thy hands: I
claim that oath now; and as thou hast pledged
thine immortal soul, and valuest the pledge,
redeem it, and leave me to die."&mdash;"And
thou, so young, so fair, so gentle," said Lewis,
gazing on her with mingled feelings of admiration
and agony,&mdash;"canst thou brave death&mdash;such
death as they may prepare for thee?"&mdash;"It
will be but a few moments of brief torture,"
said Genevieve hurriedly; "and then&mdash;but
a few moments indeed," she cried&mdash;"I hear
them approaching:" and already a tumultuous
band was heard surrounding the apartment
which we have described as detached, and to
which Prince Lewis's flight had pointed their
way. Some of them bore torches, and the
voice of Sir Ambrose was heard among them
fiercely exclaiming, "Let us burn the heretic
harlot with fire," as with unappeasable rancour
against Genevieve he led the intoxicated
party on; while some began to hurl their
torches towards the roof, too plainly indicating
their horrible purpose. "Dogs, devils

<!-- vol 4 page 129 -->

as they are," cried Prince Lewis in fury,
"they dare not do such outrage!"&mdash;and he tore
open the casement: the flashes of light came
thicker and brighter through it.&mdash;"Oh! save
me, save me!" cried Genevieve with an involuntary
shriek of horror at the prospect of her
fearful doom. "But it must be," she said,
the heart's dew of agony bursting from every
pore of her pale brow&mdash;"but it must be!
Away, for God's sake, away, lest thou too share
my dreadful death!"&mdash;"Saints and angels!
and canst thou reject life&mdash;love&mdash;a prince's
love, to embrace a fate so horrible? The postern
is guarded by our friends: this moment I
will bear thee through it; but I cannot alone
encounter those hounds of hell."&mdash;"And <i>I
must</i>," said Genevieve with a ghastly smile:
"it will be but a few moments,&mdash;a brief agony&mdash;better,
far better than a life of shame.
Away, Prince Lewis, save thy royal life; and
if he thou callest Amirald should name me
hereafter, tell him I perished unstained and
true."&mdash;"Thou shalt not perish," cried Lewis
with his most tremendous oath, "<i>Par le sang

<!-- vol 4 page 130 -->

des Rois;</i> in thine own despite I will save thee."&mdash;"Amid
those cruel men," cried Genevieve,
springing from him, "would I rather fling
this frail body, than into arms like thine.
I shudder at mine horrible death; but I
shudder more at thee."&mdash;"They must have
the power as well as the malignity of the
great fiend, if they dare to oppose me," cried
Lewis rushing from the apartment; and
wrapping his mantle round his left arm, he
flung himself among the assailants. Genevieve
looked from the casement: she saw him
stagger, sink in the heat and struggle, and
borne off insensible.</p>

<p>The chamber was constructed of wood: the
roof was already in a blaze, and the burning
fragments of the timber were dropping around
her. She retreated from them as they fell;
but the floor began also to burn, and the
shouts or rather yells of her persecutors
deepened in her ears. She retreated to the
centre of the chamber, but the heat there was
suffocating. She sank on the floor; but started
from it, as it scorched her. "Oh!" she

<!-- vol 4 page 131 -->

cried, as the volumes of smoke rolled towards
her&mdash;"Oh that they might choke me at once,
that this horrid agony might be over!
Oh, what those suffer who perish in flames!"
she cried, as she attempted to fly from place
to place, while the flames gathered strength:
but every where the burning touch, the suffocating
smoke repelled her. Her senses gave
way: the last distinct impression she retained
was that of sinking into a profound sleep,
from which the voice of Amirald tried in vain
to arouse her.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE report which had reached the Crusaders
at the feast held by the Bishop of
Toulouse, was true. Some of the most
powerful lords in Languedoc, among whom
were foremost the Counts de Foix and de
Comminges, had risen in aid of the Albigeois,
and threatened to oppose a formidable barrier
to the progress of the Crusaders. Those
two lords had been the intimate friends of
the Count of Toulouse: they had even had
the courage to accompany him to Rome, and
advocate his cause before the Pope; but
latterly revolted by his imbecile and fluctuating
character, incensed by the spoliation
of their territories and the slaughter of their
vassals, and in fact jealous and trembling for

<!-- vol 4 page 133 -->

their own diminished wealth and power;
after dispatching respectful embassies to the
Pope, to justify the measures they declared
themselves compelled to, they bade their banners
fly, and summoned the Albigeois to seek
protection beneath them. The first measure
they adopted was to seize on some city,
which they proposed to fortify, and collecting
their troops there, to offer shelter to all the
Albigeois who were disposed to avail themselves
of it; thus putting an end to the
desultory and uneventful warfare which had
been hitherto carried on, and assuming a
position alike cognizable by friends and
enemies. Their standards were soon followed
by a numerous band of men-at-arms, and
by what the historian terms, "<i>une foule incroyable</i>"
of the Albigeois, who, abandoned
by Count Raymond, sought where they could
for safety and for life.</p>

<p>These measures were concerted and acted
on with such expedition, that the intelligence
reached the Crusaders only at the moment of
its execution. The place they had fixed on

<!-- vol 4 page 134 -->

was the worst they could select&mdash;the city of
Tarascon. It was in the neighbourhood of
Beaucaire, from which the Bishop of Toulouse
could always detach a considerable force
against it: it was also commanded by a
fortified castle beyond the walls of the town;
an edifice spacious enough to contain a host,
and strong enough itself to stand a siege the
fiercest that that age could lay. The town
had been among the first to yield to De Montfort
when he overran the territories of the
Count of Toulouse in his first rapid career
of conquest, and was now held for the Crusaders
by Lambert de Limons, a brave and
experienced warrior; but his garrison was feeble,
the fortifications of the town were equally
so, and the houses wholly undefended; for at
that period the privilege of having their
houses fortified belonged exclusively to the
bourgeois of Toulouse and Avignon&mdash;a privilege
for which they had often paid sufficiently
dear. This circumstance, perhaps,
determined the inauspicious choice of the
leaders of this new army, believing that

<!-- vol 4 page 135 -->

Tarascon would be an easy prey; but in their
march thither they were fated to encounter
circumstances still more inauspicious. They
were themselves rigid Catholics&mdash;so were the
men-at-arms they led. The wandering bands
of the Albigeois collecting from every
quarter, and especially from Toulouse, from
which the Count's vacillating creed had once
more expelled them, were tenacious of the
new faith, and fierce and even bloody contest
arose on their progress between the protectors
and the protected. The leaders
could hardly venture to interfere to check
this; and when they did, their interference
was repelled by a reference to their mutual
creed on the part of their followers.&mdash;"Dogs
of heretics!" they cried, "we well deserve
such reproach for aiding their cause." And
this was followed not only by increasingly
injurious treatment of the Albigeois, but by
mutinous murmurs against their leaders.
Meanwhile this unhappy people, no less persecuted
than persecuting, were perpetually
at war among themselves; for every division

<!-- vol 4 page 136 -->

and subdivision of opinion was now developed
among the multitudes that assembled in
every direction,&mdash;emigrants from Beaucaire,
Toulouse, Nismes, and every place supposed
to be infected with heresy; and in
the intervals of abuse that they plentifully
received from the troops of the Counts de
Foix and de Comminges, they employed
themselves in as liberally bestowing it on
each other; and the terms Petro-brusiens,
Henriciens, Catharins, and Patarins, never
ceased among the unhappy and distracted
multitude; every man upbraiding his comrade
and fellow-sufferer, and then making
common cause against the catholic troops,
who assailed them in turn, and never failed
to pay the interest of their debt of sharp
words with heavy blows, till the whole band
presented the appearance of a mutinous, disarrayed
and disorganized multitude, fiercely
hating and assaulting each other, accordingly
as words or blows might predominate.</p>

<p>The winter had expired, and an early and
favourable spring had commenced, when this

<!-- vol 4 page 137 -->

party, of whose march intelligence, as we have
told, had reached Toulouse, was approaching
the city of Tarascon; and their leaders, anticipating
a temporary cessation of their differences
on their arrival at this seat of mutual
shelter and defence, urged on their progress
with the utmost haste. On their approach,
however, to Tarascon, they were struck by the
tranquil, defenceless appearance of the city,
and halted for a short consultation. They
knew the well-proved courage and military
skill of Lambert de Limons, who held the
town for the Crusaders, and paused to consider
whether some danger was not to be
dreaded from this singular tranquillity.
Their debates were broken in upon by the
clamours of the men-at-arms, who were
anxious for plunder, and the Albigeois, who
were still more anxious for food, of which
their military companions had appropriated
so large a proportion during their march, that
their situation resembled more that of men besieged
by enemies than protected by friends.
The leaders consented to the demand, rather

<!-- vol 4 page 138 -->

than petition, of their tumultuous army; and
dispatched a band of fifty archers, flanked by
as many men-at-arms&mdash;all of them expert,
chosen men&mdash;to reconnoitre the approaches of
the town. They returned in safety, but
their report was sufficiently mysterious and
unsatisfactory; and when the Counts de Foix
and de Comminges put their forces in motion,
and approached the town, singular as
it was, they found it verified. Not a banner
waved on the walls&mdash;not a warder stood on
tower or bartizan&mdash;not a horn was blown
from the gates&mdash;the town had no moat, save
on one side, and the gates lay open in silent
and portentous invitation.</p>

<p>All that day the army lay before the
walls, but it seemed as a city of the
dead. As evening fell, the impetuosity of
the troops would no longer be restrained:
the leaders yielded to it, and the whole army
burst into the city, followed fast by the
Albigeois. Streets, houses, churches, square,
and citadel, were all empty; nor man
nor beast was to be found wherever they

<!-- vol 4 page 139 -->

might turn. The earth returned nothing
but the sound of their own steps&mdash;the air
nothing but the echo of their own voices.
There was now no restraining the troops;
they wandered, pillaged, ravaged, and revelled
through every street in Tarascon; and
ample booty was there to excite and satiate
their cupidity. Rich garments, household
stuff and plate, appeared displayed in ostentatious
profusion; and with these the men-at-arms
hasted to equip themselves, appearing
in their new and multifarious array something
like Trinculo and Stephano in their
stolen robes, while the spirit which laid the
glittering bait was waiting to pursue and
punish them for the trespass. The half-famished
Albigeois betook themselves to the
provisions that they found spread with equal
and mysterious plenty in the empty houses;
and ere night fell, all had feasted on the
viands, and arrayed themselves in the garments
they found in the deserted city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Counts de Foix and Comminges
had drawn their immediate band of

<!-- vol 4 page 140 -->

knights and gentlemen into the citadel; and
still not wholly unsuspicious of some treachery,
they searched every apartment and
passage, till at length they conceived themselves
sufficiently safe; and, finding rich
viands and costly wines in the citadel, they
sat down to banquet at their leisure. Their
spirits rose as they feasted and drank;
they pledged each other deeply; and, in
pride of their strange and sudden achievement
of the possession of the town of Tarascon,
were clasping each other's hands at
every pledge, when a trumpet was blown
on the sudden, and an armed knight rushed
in almost along with the sound. The
Count de Foix and his companion started
up at the intrusion, believing it to be some
knight of their train. The stranger raised
his visor, and disclosed a face which both of
them remembered to have beheld, but neither
could clearly recollect where.</p>

<p>"I am to crave your pardon, lords,"
said the youthful knight, "for mine intrusion;
and next, to announce tidings of

<!-- vol 4 page 141 -->

high concernment!"&mdash;"Thy tidings should
indeed be of importance to justify such intrusion.
Speak, then!" said De Foix, standing
with his hand on his dagger as he spoke.&mdash;"Thine
employers have sent but a weak
instrument to sound their challenge," said
Comminges.&mdash;"Then hear it to-morrow
from the trumpets of the Crusaders," said
the youth, "who ere dawn will invest your
towers! Such are my tidings; brook them
how ye list."</p>

<p>De Foix and De Comminges started to
their feet. "These be stirring tidings indeed!"
exclaimed the former. "And where
gottest thou them? and what be thy credentials&mdash;thy
pledge?"&mdash;"My life!" said
the youth with proud confidence: "I have
placed that in your hands; and as ye find
me to have spoken the truth, so deal with
me. The army of the Crusaders is on its
march; they will be beneath your walls to-morrow;
and hang me from the highest turret
of your citadel, if by dawn ye find not
my tidings, which I have risked life to bear,

<!-- vol 4 page 142 -->

true!"&mdash;"And who art thou that bearest
such tidings? and who commissioned thee
to bear them?" said De Foix.&mdash;"Ay,
ask him that!" said De Comminges.&mdash;"My
lords," said the young knight, "I
must say that the reception I have met with
is lacking, not only in noble courtesy, but in
the wisdom I might seek in chiefs like you.
I bear you tidings of high import&mdash;I pledge
my life on their truth&mdash;and ye seek my
name and title? If that be warrantage, I
tell ye, peers of France, that I have right
to the <i>cri d'armes</i>,<sup id="ref054"><a href="#en054">54</a></sup> being a knight banneret,
knighted by your liege sovereign and mine,
King Philip, on the field of battle."</p>

<p>De Foix and De Comminges whispered together,
and looked at him as they whispered.
"Wast thou not one of that godless band,"
said De Foix, "who wore the cross on their
breast, but trampled it under their feet?"&mdash;"I
have transferred it from my breast to my
heart," said Amirald; "and there I trust it
will remain."</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 143 -->

<p>"And what motive hast thou for such
change?" said De Foix suspectingly. "We
rise in aid of our despoiled vassals, our
ravaged territories; but thou, a landless,
birthless youth, to all seeming&mdash;what motive
hath urged thee to such enterprise?"&mdash;"My
lords," said the youth blushing, his youthful
grace and modest mien making strong
contrast with the half-recumbent posture,
scowling brow, and flushed but stern visage
of the querist, "my lords, is this noble?&mdash;is
it generous to press on a stranger's private
thoughts? Believe it, that the motive must
have been powerful that could produce such
change: I will say no more."</p>

<p>"If thine intelligence be true," said De Foix,
"thou canst tell us how the Crusaders have
marshalled their array?"&mdash;"De Montfort,"
replied Amirald, "hath marshalled them
in three bands, in honour of the Holy Trinity:
the Dauphin leads the centre, the
Bishop of Toulouse the left wing, and De
Montfort himself the right." De Foix and his
companions interchanged looks, as if their

<!-- vol 4 page 144 -->

suspicions began to be removed. "But,
lords, my tidings are not yet told: a powerful
ally, as well as a fierce enemy, is in
the field&mdash;Count Raymond of Toulouse is
marching hither."&mdash;"Sir stranger knight,"
said De Comminges, "thou taskest our credulity
too far. Know we not that Raymond of
Toulouse is paying his devotions before the
doors of every church in his territories&mdash;because
he dares not enter them? and causing
prayers to be said for his reconciliation with
the holy father?"&mdash;"And know ye not also
the holy father's answer to his last embassy:
"<i>Mon fils, &eacute;coutez-moi, aimez Dieu sur tout
chose, ne prenez jamais les biens d'autrui;
mais defendez le votre, si quelqu'un veut vous
l'enlever;</i>"<sup id="ref055"><a href="#en055">55</a></sup> and that, on the faith of that message,
Count Raymond is already at the head
of a potent army, and making towards Tarascon
with his utmost speed?"&mdash;"This seems
like truth," said De Foix.&mdash;"<i>Seems</i>," cried
Amirald. "Now, by Heaven, lords, I will

<!-- vol 4 page 145 -->

no longer brook these wrongs: trust me, or
slay me on the spot!"</p>

<p>De Foix was about to return a fierce answer,
and De Comminges to interpose, when
a loud tumult was heard at the entrance, and
some of De Foix's attendants rushed in,
dragging, or rather carrying among them the
ghastly figure of a man apparently wasted
by disease, but who neither offered resistance,
nor attempted supplication. "My
lord," they cried, in answer to the questions
eagerly hurried on them, "we found this
fellow concealed in a private passage near
this chamber; we have brought him hither,
and perchance he can tell the cause of this
city's strange abandonment, and why, of the
thousands that swarmed here but two days
past, he alone was found, and found concealed."&mdash;"Speak,
fellow, for thy life!" said De
Foix, turning fiercely on the ghastly wretch.&mdash;"My
life!&mdash;not for that," said the prisoner,
with an energy of voice and manner singularly
contrasted with the squalid debility of
his appearance: "but I <i>will</i> speak, and ye

<!-- vol 4 page 146 -->

shall find my words are true as the words
of the dying are ever. Lambert de Limons,
the governor of the town, withdrew his
garrison from these walls on the report of
your approach, and he hath thrown himself
into the castle of Tarascon, which he purposes
to hold for the Crusaders, whose arrival
he expects by to-morrow's dawn."&mdash;"This
confirms the stranger knight's report," said
De Comminges.&mdash;"It needed not <i>such</i> confirmation,"
said Amirald with some disdain.&mdash;"And
the inhabitants of the town?" said
De Foix.&mdash;"They dispersed on the garrison's
being withdrawn."&mdash;"And wherefore didst
thou tarry here alone?"&mdash;"I was unable to
follow them; and if I were, it was my wish
to stay: my reasons you will know ere
long," replied the prisoner, with an expression
somewhat sinister. "Hast thou aught
else to disclose?" said De Foix.&mdash;"Tidings
that should be welcome to you, noble lords,"
said the man with a portentous smile: "and
yet methinks you will scarce have heart to
welcome them when they are fulfilled."&mdash;"Tell

<!-- vol 4 page 147 -->

them plainly," said De Foix; "and
forbear, if thou canst, that leer that suits
so ill the features of a dying wretch like
thee."&mdash;"Men say," answered the prisoner,
"that Raymond of Toulouse is marching
hither; and that the incarnate fiend, in form
of a knight in sable armour, fights by his
side. However that be, Lambert de Limons
thought better, with his small garrison, to
maintain the castle than the town, whose
defences were destroyed when Simon de
Montfort won it from the Count of Toulouse."&mdash;"Sir
stranger knight," said De Foix
eagerly, "we cry you mercy for our unseasonable
mistrust, and gladly accept the proffered
aid of your arms and counsel."</p>

<p>Amirald took the hand of the Count, who
accompanied his words with the suitable action,
and grasped it with an energy that made
him feel the pledge was given for life and
death. His finely modulated temper, like a
piece composed by some skilful musician, admitted
a passing discord for a moment, only
to swell and enrich the succeeding harmony.

<!-- vol 4 page 148 -->

"Now, my lords," he said, "shall we not set
forth by to-morrow's dawn? A <i>sortie</i> from
these towers would at least check the Crusaders;
and if we succeeded in turning their
flanks, perchance by that time the army of
Raymond of Toulouse may arrive, and thus
they will be enclosed between two fires. A
sortie, noble lords, by the dawn, and I will
yield to the first lance levelled against me,
an' we do not win the day against De Montfort
and his triple host, were they trebled
again."&mdash;"Sir stranger knight, thou sayest
well," answered De Foix; "but our men-at-arms
are now scattered through the town in
quest of pillage. We will summon them back
on the instant: they have, I warrant me, scarce
left a meal untasted or a garment untried in
the town. They must be recalled to their
standards within the hour, and by dawn we
charge from these walls."&mdash;"Is it true," said
the prisoner, "that your troops have partaken
of the food, and clothed themselves with the
garments they found within these walls?"
No one heeded him; while the Count de Foix

<!-- vol 4 page 149 -->

loudly issued his orders for recalling the men-at-arms
from their dispersion through the
town. The prisoner then repeated his demand
in a hollow voice, but with an expression
of eagerness indescribable. "And dost thou
ask, fellow," said De Foix, issuing orders,&mdash;"dost
thou ask whether men-at-arms will
seize on the spoil of a deserted town; or
whether the starved Albigeois will not snatch
a meal where he can find it?"&mdash;As he spoke,
his back was to the prisoner, but he suddenly
turned on hearing a wild and fierce shriek
of exultation:&mdash;"Then are they death-doomed
every man, did each possess the
strength of a hundred giants! The town was
visited by the plague; Lambert de Limons
withdrew his garrison in terror; and the infected
and unprotected inhabitants wandered
where they might: but they left behind them
pledges of their good-will towards their
expected guests. Every morsel that ye have
tasted is death&mdash;every garment that ye have
but touched is deadly as mortal poison. Now
rejoice at the speedy succour of Count Raymond.

<!-- vol 4 page 150 -->

Ha, ha! he will be greeted by your
livid corses: or by your spirits parting
in torture and I&mdash;I remained alone to
tell the enemies of God their fate, and
to die." The breathless silence that followed
this terrible communication was itself
as terrible. It did not, however, continue
long. "Die, then! accursed fiend," cried De
Foix with an ungovernable impulse of fury
and horror: and he plunged his dagger to the
hilt in the body of the prisoner, who fell without
a groan. He fell on his face; but in a
few moments, by convulsive exertions, he turned
himself on his back as he lay, and tearing
open his garment, pointed to the livid spots
on his breast, and, glaring at his murderer
with an unutterable smile, expired.</p>

<p>Amirald, who like the rest had stood dumb
and stupefied with horror, now felt a sting of
agonizing consciousness thrill through frame
and soul, and striking his forehead, and uttering
with a sob of despair the single word
"Genevieve," he rushed from the apartment.
On his reaching the citadel that disastrous

<!-- vol 4 page 151 -->

night, he had placed her under the care of
his two squires (to which his retinue was now
diminished) in the antechamber, while he
passed on to impart his tidings, and offer his
aid to the leaders. There he now found her
seated, in a retired nook, with her veil folded
round her, silently shrinking from the rude
gaze of the armed attendants of the counts,
as they hastily traversed the chamber. He
stood some moments in irresolute agony;
but when, at length beholding her young
protector again, she rose, and with a sweet
and timid confidence extended her arms
towards him, he thought his heart would
burst he rushed towards her, and in a brief
and shuddering whisper communicated the
terrible intelligence of their danger.</p>

<p>Genevieve for a moment trembled, and recoiled
in natural horror; but in the next she
said, in a voice tremulous indeed, but which
announced invincible resolution, "Then I
will seek my poor old father, and we will
perish together." It was in vain that Amirald,
with all the agony of a lover, expostulated,

<!-- vol 4 page 152 -->

implored, and finally menaced to detain her.
"Thou wilt not use force," she said with resolute
mildness; "and to naught but force will
I yield in this thing. Noble knight, gentle
friend," she added, "withstand me not; I will
not be counselled."</p>

<p>Amirald adjured her by her only chance for
safety, to remain in the citadel, as she was yet
free from infection, having neither tasted the
food nor touched the raiment since her arrival.</p>

<p>As he pleaded, some of the more respectable
of the Albigeois came to solicit the protection
of the Counts against the tyranny and
rapacity of the men-at-arms, who were taking
from them their provisions, and otherwise
abusing and plundering them. As these men
struggled through the tumultuous and insulting
opposition of the men-at-arms who
crowded the apartment, a voice was heard
exclaiming, "Smite me not, I pray thee! I
am old and blind, and lack a guide to aid
me." Genevieve sprang forward at the
sound, and in a moment locked her arms
round the neck of the aged Pierre, and sobbed

<!-- vol 4 page 153 -->

in mingled joy and agony on his breast; while
the old man, recognizing her in the same
moment, held her to his heart with a
sense of pleasure so oppressive and overpowering
that it was almost converted into pain.
The others who filled the apartment were
unfit spectators of such a scene: they gazed
incuriously for a time, and then began to utter
coarse jests on the meeting, till Amirald
forced his way among them, and fiercely repelled
the rude circle. But such was the
tumult and distraction in the citadel of Tarascon,
the tidings of infection spreading fast,
that it was only by dint of manual force,
seconded by that of his squires, that the
knight succeeded in securing a small and
remote chamber in the citadel for Genevieve
and the pastor; where he left his attendants
to protect them, and hastened back to take
part in the troubled and distracted councils
of the Counts de Foix and de Comminges
during the short remainder of that dreary
night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the pastor and his daughter

<!-- vol 4 page 154 -->

sat in their still, remote chamber in a state
of pure delight, which not even the sense of
near and mortal danger could disturb. The
thought made their meeting solemn, but not
sad. "And why dost thou quit my side,
Genevieve?"&mdash;said the old man, extending his
arms towards her.&mdash;"It was to bring the
lamp nearer my father."&mdash;"But I can
feel thee without it."&mdash;"But I cannot see
you, my father, in this dusky chamber filled
with arms. Alas! how you are changed, my
father!"&mdash;"Regard it not, my child, but haste
to tell me all that hath befallen thee, and how
thou hast been restored to me; for my heart
forebodes that, surrounded as we are by pestilence
and war, these are the last and only
moments in which it will be allowed me to
listen to thy voice, and to feel thy hands in
mine."</p>

<p>Genevieve began her tale, but often paused,
palliated, and omitted when the theme was
her own danger. But it was observable even
to Pierre, that when the name of Sir Amirald
mingled in her story, her voice became free,

<!-- vol 4 page 155 -->

her language fluent and unhesitating, and her
narrative most minute and circumstantial.
She told of her deliverance from the flames by
<i>him</i>, who, at the risk of his life, had borne
her through them; and then, almost unaided,
charged on her persecutors with one arm,
while he sustained his senseless burthen in the
other. In her narrative she could not but
contrast the daring courage and faithful love
of Amirald with the selfish and violent passion
of the Dauphin, who had persecuted her while
in his power, and abandoned her to her horrible
fate when he found his interest with the
Crusaders was compromised by her presence.
"But, oh! my father, hadst thou seen him&mdash;his
noble daring, his gentle courage! It would
be worth a miracle to restore thy sight, were
it but to view that form so lovely and noble."&mdash;"But,
my child," said the old man, "it was
of thee I wished to hear: what is the comely
favour of that youth to me? Go on, my daughter:
he guided thee to Toulouse (as thou saidst
was thy intendment) in safety and honour?"&mdash;"Alas!
yes, my father: but when I arrived

<!-- vol 4 page 156 -->

there, all things were changed. Our kinswoman
Merab, with whom I hoped to sojourn, had obeyed the new injunctions of
Count Raymond, and professed the ancient
faith: the count himself assisted at mass,
and enjoined it on all his subjects during his
negotiation with the Pope. Our kinswoman
was a widow with many children: she gazed
for a space on the gems I offered her to
shelter me; but then she looked at her children, and averting her head that she might
not see me, pointed to the open door. I was
then a wanderer in the streets of Toulouse:
and oh! how I rejoiced to find that the most
powerful feeling of my persecutors was
their avarice! But my ransom soon left me
poor; for when Sir Amirald bore me from
that burning chamber, I left in a cabinet,
where I had hid them, the most costly jewels
of the queen's gift. It was darkling when I
sheltered me within the shadow of a church
where they were singing mass or vespers.
Soon a glare of torches flashed on me where I
lay concealed, and I saw the powerful preacher,

<!-- vol 4 page 157 -->

the mighty warrior Mattathias, borne from
judgment to the prison, there to abide his
doom; for Count Raymond had resolved to
sacrifice to the Pope's demands the chief
among his once highly-favoured Albigeois.
The torches, held by some ghastly wretches,
blazed in the front of the procession, and
then came Mattathias. He was to be consigned
to prison for two days; and if within
that period he did not submit to the ancient
faith, he was to be burnt with fire. As he
passed me, his stern and ghastly features
spoke aught but faith or hope: they had that
fixed expression that spoke not spiritual, but
physical power; not the zeal of the martyr,
but the strength of the man."&mdash;"I always
judged him what thou hast spoken him,"
said Pierre: "and moreover he was the
cause of thy banishment from the congregation.
He rent the last green leaf from the
sapless trunk&mdash;he quenched the light of the
blind. I have tried to forgive him, and I
have sometimes thought I had done so; but
I dared not search my heart. Yet fear not

<!-- vol 4 page 158 -->

thou, my child; there are none now to oppose
return. Boanerges is now a mighty warrior
clad in mail: and Amand&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Oh, what of
him?"said Genevieve fearfully.&mdash;"Didst thou
love him, my child, that thou speakest with
such earnestness?"&mdash;"Alas! no, my father;
but we sometimes dread more to hear the
fate of those who hated, than of those who
have loved us."&mdash;"He wandered about
among us, after thy departure, heavy and
silent: a bad and restless spirit seemed to be
at work within him. On our way hither, he
disappeared; and no one knows what hath
befallen him&mdash;no one, methinks, inquired. But
tell me, my child, the end of the hard-hearted
and hard-fated Mattathias."&mdash;"Oh, my
father, it was fearful. I sought him in his
prison, near his last moments, and then the
faith for which he had been so zealous failed!
He doubted that he had ever believed. The
soul tried to drop her anchor, but found no
bottom; and went on drifting her dim and
stormy way, almost a wreck. He called on me
to join him in prayer and hymns. I sang and

<!-- vol 4 page 159 -->

prayed, but he said there was no meaning in the
sounds: and then to see his fixed ghastly eyes,
the cold drops on his forehead, and his strong
frame heaving with its throes, like a mountain
moved by an earthquake! His pride
upheld him, and he died the death of a
martyr, but without a martyr's faith or hope.
To my dying hour never can I forget his."
Pierre shuddered at the awful picture.
"But my fears were soon awakened for myself.
My visits to the prison were watched;
there was no safety then in Toulouse for those
of our faith; and again I owed my deliverance
to the care and valour of Sir Amirald.
But when I had escaped from the city, and
my protector asked where I was about to
direct my flight, I looked around me and on
him in mute and utter helplessness, for I
knew not that spot on earth where I might
turn my steps in safety. At length I bethought
me of the report that the Albigeois
were betaking themselves to this city of
Tarascon; and I said that I would repair
hither, that I might share the lot of my

<!-- vol 4 page 160 -->

people; and, if they perished, perish with
them. As I spoke, his countenance seemed
suddenly to glow with a light from Heaven.
'Maiden,' he said, 'the faith that can prompt
and sustain a woman in trials like thine,
cannot be heresy, cannot be error. I will be
thy companion, thy protector, thy friend, the
partaker of thy faith, and the champion of
thy cause: thy people shall be my people;
and thy God my God."&mdash;Pierre clasped his
hands in ecstasy, and blessed her. "As we
journeyed hither," continued Genevieve, "I
endeavoured humbly, as became an unlettered
maiden, to explain to him those glorious
truths that form the substance of our purer
creed; and was it not wondrous, my father,
that from lips like mine he would hear those
truths which perchance he would have rejected,
if expounded to him by the most
learned of our teachers?"&mdash;Pierre smiled in
silence; for though he set a value sufficiently
high on his own controversial powers, he
could not help internally admitting that, to a
handsome and enamoured youth, the lips of

<!-- vol 4 page 161 -->

female beauty were capable of making things
intelligible which would be heard with indifference
from the voice of masculine orthodoxy.
Zealous, however, for every dogma
of his faith, he inquired into the course of
argument she had adopted with her catechumen,
in hope of discovering that the impression
it had made was not, as might be
expected, partial, temporary, and superficial.&mdash;"I
know not how it was," said Genevieve
in her simplicity: "I spoke but now and
then, not long or continuously; and methought
nature, and the objects that presented
themselves as we journeyed, seemed to
take a kindly and aidful part with me.
Once, I remember, when I saw him smile,
(though he suppressed his smile,) at the
thought that an unskilled and unlettered
peasant should handle such high themes, I
ventured to demand of him whether, when
lonely and benighted, he had not often been
cheered by the light glancing from the
casement of the cottager; a light denied by
the barred though lofty windows of a castled

<!-- vol 4 page 162 -->

hold. And once more, as we passed near a
mountain-torrent, that after its stormy fall
wound quietly through the valley, he
spoke with scorn of our humble and
obscure estate, and proudly and painfully
contrasted it with that lofty course
to which his early hopes had aspired:&mdash;I
told him, that men gazed on the cataract as
it thundered from the cliff, but drank of its
waters only when they rested on the plain."&mdash;"It
is well, my child," said Pierre: "but
tell me, mine own Genevieve, didst thou
search thine heart, and was it clear in this
matter? Thou hast painted to me the
youth's favour as goodly beyond that of the
sons of men; and of a truth his bearing towards
thee might have made even deformity
gracious in thy sight. But did no illusion of
earthly and profane passion mingle with thy
hope and thy toil for his conversion? Didst
thou seek to win him to thy faith, or to win
him to thyself?"&mdash;"Not now," said Genevieve
hastily, while a slight suffusion of
womanly pride and shame tinged her cheek,

<!-- vol 4 page 163 -->

and she blushed as though her father could
have beheld her. "I might have had such a
thought&mdash;such a dream: but, alas! my father,
though in the first impulse of his noble
heart he sacrificed all for me, I see every
hour he repents the sacrifice; and though he
would hide it from me, methinks I could
almost better bear his reproaches than his
silence. Never did we pass a lordly castle,
but he gave a sigh to the recollection of the
martial sport of the tourney; its noble guerdon,
dealt by proud barons and high-descended
dames. Never did we pass a church, but
he sighed for the pomp of the ancient faith,
where kneeling nobles received the benison
of the lordly and mitred prelates; where the
feet trod on the dust of princes, and the armed
effigies on their tombs made the very marble
eloquent of the fame of chivalry. Thus
would he speak, and I wept. He saw it, and
forbore to speak; and I wept the more."&mdash;"Enough,
my child," said Pierre: "I grieve
that I probed the wound, whose cure, I see,
will soon be wrought by another hand. The

<!-- vol 4 page 164 -->

young knight's neglect will soon dissolve the
fairy pile in which thou, poor dreamer, didst
empalace thyself."&mdash;"It matters not," said
Genevieve with a kind of heroic melancholy,
hastily drying her eyes&mdash;"it matters not; he
bears a good sword to the cause of the
Albigeois, and a true heart to their faith.
For me, my wanderings are at a close: hither
have I come, and come at length to die."&mdash;"Not
so, my daughter," said Pierre; "for
since I have met thee, methinks the love of
life hath rekindled even within me."&mdash;"But I
have no wish for life," said Genevieve, all
her resolution giving way before the keen
anguish his last words had excited. "Oh, my
father, I feel and know it is easier to meet
death in flames and agony, than to encounter
him under the withering aspect of a broken
and hopeless heart."&mdash;"Genevieve," said the
old man solemnly; and he seized the moment
of strong emotion, and tried powerfully and
successfully to lead her mind back to the sole
topic in which his own centered and terminated
ever; and both found the change for

<!-- vol 4 page 165 -->

the better, and themselves bettered by the
change.</p>

<p>The themes on which they spoke gradually
raised them above the sense of mortal
suffering and of mortal fear. They spoke
of grief, but they no longer spoke with tears.
The daylight broke on their sad and holy
conference: and their exhausted frames alike
requiring rest, the pastor slumbered where
he sat; and Genevieve, as she was wont in
her early days, sat on the ground, and
resting her head on the pastor's knees, slept,
resolved not to dream of Amirald.</p>

<br/>

<p>THE morning broke on the city of Tarascon,
and found it in tumult and consternation.
The disunion between the ill-organized
men-at-arms, and the heretics, whom
they reluctantly protected, (but very willingly
plundered,) was increased by the report of
the pestilence being in the town, and all
was distraction, mutiny, and pillage.</p>

<p>De Comminges enclosed himself in the
citadel, and refused to hold communion even
by letter with De Foix or his retainers,
pretending dread of the pestilence; while his

<!-- vol 4 page 167 -->

men were pillaging through the town,
giving themselves up to all the desperation
of sailors in a wreck, who break open
lockers, dress themselves in the officers'
clothes, and practise every kind of mad extravagance
on the approach of their dreadful
and inevitable doom. Sickening at all he
saw, and hopeless in heart of all that might
succeed, Sir Amirald nevertheless rode forth
at dawn to reconnoitre the advance of the
enemy. As he rode through the streets to
the gate of Tarascon, the sounds of distant
violence and uproar struck on his ear at
every moment, where the fierce followers of
the counts were committing acts of the
wildest outrage and hostility. As he reached
the gate, a kerchief was waved to him from
a casement. Believing it to be a signal of
distress, he reined in his steed, and looked
upward; and for a moment he saw the
heavenly face of Genevieve, as, once more
waving her kerchief, she retired from the
casement. On the door were inscribed the
terrible characters, <i>Domine, miserere nobis,</i>

<!-- vol 4 page 168 -->

and Amirald felt with agony unutterable
how and where she was employed. For a
moment his courage failed: he tried to rouse
himself, but in vain; then at the image of
this humble solitary female, at risk of life
engaged in duty that she knew to be mortal,
a gush of magnanimity overflowed his
heart; and while (for a moment) he wept
like woman, he felt more than man. "I
have seen that heavenly face for the last
time," he said with emotion, setting spurs
to his steed: he dashed a tear away,
and rode up the hill that neighboured the
walls of Tarascon, to observe the approach
of the enemy. It was not yet day, but
something like a heavy cloud lay on the
hills; and Sir Amirald, by the increasing
light, could soon descry a vast body of troops
in motion. He rode back to the city on
the instant, and sought De Foix first, as
De Comminges was, he deemed, inaccessible.
But close beside the gates he found both the
counts at the head of their array, and both
at deadly feud. "This is the issue of thy

<!-- vol 4 page 169 -->

mad counsel," cried Comminges: "here are
we hemmed in between a foe without the
walls, and a pestilence within."&mdash;"And
where be thy men-at-arms to meet the
peril?" replied De Foix.&mdash;"They are pillaging
through the town. This is thy
<i>foi Poictevin</i>."<sup id="ref056"><a href="#en056">56</a></sup>&mdash;"Rude lord, say that
again, and my men-at-arms shall charge
against thine!"&mdash;"At thy peril!" shouted
the other; while he called to his bannerman,
"Turn thy standard! we march back
to the city of Tarascon."&mdash;"In Heaven's name,
lords," cried Amirald, riding up, "suspend
your feud. The enemy hangs like a thundercloud
on your hills; and here ye stand rending
each other like two blood-hounds, instead
of rushing together at the prey. Look yonder,
and see if I speak true!" De Foix and
De Comminges turned their bloodshot and
angry eyes from each other to the view of
the advancing enemy, who were now indeed
seen gathering on the hills like a storm.

<!-- vol 4 page 170 -->

They gazed for a moment on the formidable
sight with a kind of stupor (which was, however,
wholly unmixed with fear); and then,
slowly drawing their suspended breath, and
loosing hold of the daggers, which they held
half-drawn, they turned on each other looks
of mutual shame for their paltry and disgraceful
broil.</p>

<p>Sir Amirald took advantage of this silent
advance to reconciliation, and again pointed
out the approach of the force, that excited,
while it <i>almost</i> awed him, in language not
unlike that of a more powerful poet than
ever knight troubadour was&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Their gilt coats shew like dragons' scales&mdash;<br/>

Their march like a rough tumbling storm."<sup id="ref057"><a href="#en057">57</a></sup></p>

<p>Their appearance was indeed terrific to all but
eyes accustomed to look on war.</p>

<p>The centre of the Crusaders was led by
Prince Lewis in person, and over his head was
displayed the oriflamme of France, grasped
by the same bold hand that had upheld it in
the battle of Bovines; for at this period it was

<!-- vol 4 page 171 -->

customary to crown the heir of France in his
father's lifetime (to insure the succession);
and the Dauphin therefore marched to battle
in all the insignia of anticipated royalty.</p>

<p>But the array of Prince Lewis was all loose
and disorderly: a number of light females
travelled in the midst of his van; and the
prince was so attentive to their accommodation,
that he detached a large body of his
troops to the rear, to secure their safety; while
he was for ever quitting his post to hold talk
with the bonnibelles, amid whom his fool
danced, laughed, rang his bells, and proclaimed
himself the chief of the host, inasmuch
as he led them who led their leader. This
disarray was marked by the keen eye of Sir
Amirald, and he hasted to make his advantage
of it. The left wing was led by the Bishop
of Toulouse, who, though invincibly brave,
and profoundly skilful in the tactics of the
age, could not be safely entrusted with the
command of even a portion of an army; his
ambitious selfishness always leading him to
some desperate enterprise, by which he might

<!-- vol 4 page 172 -->

himself be distinguished, were it at the loss of
ten thousand lives: so that, if in a day of
assault he stood alone on some tower that was
deemed impregnable, and shouted his war-cry
in the voice of victory, he cared not if it
pealed over the dead bodies of every follower
he had led to slaughter. The position he had
taken this day savoured strongly of his character:
he led the left wing, which was of
course opposed to the right of the city of
Tarascon. On that side flowed a branch of
the Rhone; and there the fortifications were
neglected, the inhabitants relying on the
protection of the river, and the difficulty
of approaching the town. Thither the
bishop was resolved to urge his forces, and
make a desperate attempt, careless what
befell the centre of the host, or the right
wing (which was led by the Count De Montfort),
provided he could first plant the banner
of the Crusaders on the battlements of Tarascon.
The right wing was still more
inauspiciously generalled for the event of
the day. De Montfort was at its head: but

<!-- vol 4 page 173 -->

he was no longer the redoubtable De Montfort&mdash;the
resistless champion of the armies of
the Church. The wounds he had received,
which were principally in his head, had
evidently weakened his powers, while they
had inflamed his passions. The slightest
contradiction maddened him; the most
trifling opposition to his will was met by
the menace of lance or dagger. He seemed
to be under the alternate, or rather mingled
influence of delirium and stupor. He issued
orders, and revoked them; gave the most
absurd commands; seemed conscious of it&mdash;but
was furious if they were disobeyed.
Those under his command knew not what
to do, or what he would have them do;
and all predicted, by their briefly exchanged
looks and whispers, a disastrous event to the
battle, if De Montfort, their former Maccabee,
led the right wing that day.</p>

<p>On that day, as the historian<sup id="ref058"><a href="#en058">58</a></sup> informs us, he
appeared eminently under the influence of his

<!-- vol 4 page 174 -->

morbid and portentous habits: he had refused
to march without first participating in the
sacrament, which he termed seeing his Lord
and Saviour, as if he had a presentiment of
some mortal event; and when his wish was
complied with, he seemed rather more agitated,
and his whole conduct and manner were
those of one whom our northern neighbours
would call <i>fey</i>, that is, one hurried on by
supernatural impulse to his fate, and not unconscious
of the impulse himself. He forced
on the right wing rapidly, as if to intercept all
communication between the castle of Tarascon
(which lay to the left of the city) and the city
itself; thus demonstrating that the post was
of some importance by his movement, though
the opposed forces could not yet imagine why:
while the bishop, intent on <i>his</i> purpose, urged
on the left wing with still greater rapidity,
careless how he weakened the main body,
provided he succeeded in seizing on that part
of the city which he well knew to be the least
defensible. The centre, thus weakened by the
elongation, or rather total detachment of its

<!-- vol 4 page 175 -->

wings, was in still greater confusion from the
surprise into which Prince Lewis and the
fiery knights around him were thrown, at seeing
a band, whom they had believed cooped
up and shrinking within their city, marching
forth in fair array to give them battle before
its walls. "What," cried the Dauphin to the
lords that rode round his standard, "have
these wolves, that we have hunted to their den,
rushed forth to make prey of us?"&mdash;"Ar'n't
like your grace," said old Sir Aymer: "those
wolves have fangs that will snap the stoutest
lances in your host."&mdash;"I like not grey-beards
to prate of battle," said the Dauphin, scornfully
reining back his steed, as if to shun the
voice of the unwelcome speaker.&mdash;"Nor I,"
said Sir Aymer on his part,&mdash;"nor I, boys,
to dream of heading hosts."&mdash;"Peace, Sir
Aymer, peace!" cried the standard-bearer, who
stood justly high in the favour of the Dauphin:
"the cloud that is spreading on yon plain
hath somewhat overshadowed Prince Lewis's
memory of thy worth."&mdash;"And if report says
true," answered Sir Aymer, "the cloud that

<!-- vol 4 page 176 -->

is gathering on yon hills will turn that shadow
into night, ere it be noon." And he pointed
with emphatic gesture to the hills, whence
a rumour had reached the Crusaders that
Raymond of Toulouse was approaching with
the embodied fiend among his host; nor did
the terror of this wild report, in those ages,
at all impair its authenticity or its effect.</p>

<p>"Who is that boy?" said Prince Lewis,
proudly turning to his followers, "who rides
careering in their van? He is neither herald
nor pursuivant by his garb. Go thou," to one
of his pages, "and ask if he be warder of yon
towers: go tell him we will spare him farther
pains to guard them within in an hour."
The page (who was an esquire and of noble
birth) bowed to his steed's mane, set spurs,
and rode. In a short space&mdash;while Prince
Lewis was laughing, between a youthful
knight, who counselled him to ride on and
trample on the host, as peasants tread their
vintage, and a fair dame, who was patting
the proud neck of his war-steed with her
white hand,&mdash;the page rode back at full

<!-- vol 4 page 177 -->

speed, but stood silent. "Speak on," said the
Dauphin, "without fear, and without offence."</p>

<p>"My liege," answered the page, "the
youth is somewhat insolent; and saith, if you
are fatigued in taking his place of warder of
the towers of Tarascon, your brows shall be
wiped by his hand in such wise that you will
never have to undergo such toil again."&mdash;"Lords,
gentlemen, noble knights, do you
hear such message done to a son of France!"
cried the fiery Dauphin. "What say you?"&mdash;"On,
on, to the fight!" cried a thousand
voices; and twice that number of lances were
put in rest, and of swords drawn and flashing
round the oriflamme of France. "Send
forth the archers and slingers first!" cried Sir
Aymer, riding up by the Dauphin's side.&mdash;"Churlish
knight, I disdain thee and thy
counsel!" exclaimed Prince Lewis, spurring
his steed.&mdash;"Upon them, lords&mdash;upon them,
on the instant!" Sir Aymer laid his hand on
the Dauphin's rein; the fierce Prince smote
it with his battle-axe, and the old knight held
it up bleeding: "This will not be the last

<!-- vol 4 page 178 -->

blood I will shed in thy cause to-day, Prince
Dauphin," he cried, as he spurred on his steed
with the rest, holding the reins with his bleeding
hand. Sir Amirald marked the confusion
of the host, and rode at full speed back to that
which was advancing from the city of Tarascon.</p>

<p>The full array of the troops of the Counts
de Foix and de Comminges was more formidable
than could be apprehended by their
adversaries. The intense zeal of the Albigeois
had induced them to submit to the
military discipline of their Catholic leaders,
(however they might detest their creed,) and
the stout peasantry, already well skilled in
the use of the bow and sling, were placed in
front of the host, thus supplying the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>
of the van of a feudal army, (which always
consisted of slingers and archers,) and feeling
their experience more than an equivalent for
the military tact which was supposed the exclusive
possession of feudal vassals. Moreover,
there were amongst them many (and Boanerges
at their head) whose strong frames and muscular

<!-- vol 4 page 179 -->

power easily bore the weight of arms, and
wielded the weapons of the practised militarist;
their zeal, eagerness, and perseverance
supplying every deficiency of practice and
habit. Undeterred by ridicule, unappalled
by novelty, and undaunted by danger&mdash;rigid,
cold, but submissive and watchful, they easily
caught the simple tactics of the age, their
very creed supplying a motive which was
wanted by the mercenary pelerins and the
feudal military vassals, and formed a powerful
and formidable addition to the troops
who had at first despised their inexperience,
and undervalued their aid. Besides these,
the troops of De Foix and De Comminges
were swelled by the accession of the armed
bands of many a powerful lord of Languedoc;
and De Foix had (apparently to the foe)
doubled the number of knights in his army,
by causing every knight to bear <i>two</i> banners;
a <i>ruse</i> by which Henry of Winchester, a few
years after, won a battle from the King of
France.</p>

<p>The battle of the two Counts was thus

<!-- vol 4 page 180 -->

arrayed, when Sir Amirald reined up his
panting steed by that of De Foix. "My
noble lord," said he, "some disorder prevails
in the centre of the host. Mark, too," he
added, pointing with rapid and emphatic
gesture, "how fast the wings are marching
away! Seize, seize the moment, noble De
Foix, valiant Comminges: grant me but fifty
men-at-arms to break their battle, and if I
do not scatter their puny defence of archers
and slingers, and lay my hand on the
Dauphin's rein ere a follower be lost, may
there be not one left to bestride my corse!"&mdash;"Thou
shalt have them," said De Foix;
"and if thou break their battle, youth, I
will follow with a wedge of men-at-arms that
shall split yon oak of the field till it groan
and totter."</p>

<p>At a signal, fifty men-at-arms were detached
from his train. "Haste, fellows,
haste," cried Amirald,&mdash;"haste, that we may
win advantage of the sun and wind, which the
van of Prince Lewis is marching to gain!
Haste! such advantage won the battle of

<!-- vol 4 page 181 -->

Bovines!" He shouted at the top of his
voice; a hundred gathered round him as he
rode. "By heaven," cried De Foix, "this
boy will teach us generalship! On!" he cried:
"St. Denis to aid, though thou fightest
against his banner! Spur and speed be the
word!"&mdash;"Win thy spurs, boy," said Comminges
coldly.&mdash;"They were won in a
bloodier field than ever the Count de Comminges
fought in," cried the youth, spurring
his steed. "Boy! my deeds shall prove me
man to-day!" And as he spoke, he and his
band parted like lightning from a cloud. De
Foix and his associate meanwhile took brief
counsel how they might best avail themselves
of the obvious disunion that appeared to prevail
among the host of the Crusaders. On
the sudden&mdash;"While we are talking," cried
De Foix, "all is done: look, noble De Comminges!"
His companion threw his eyes in
the direction, and saw</p>

<p class="small">The fiery youth with desperate charge<br/>

Make for a space an opening large<sup id="ref059"><a href="#en059">59</a></sup>&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 182 -->

<p>and, trampling down the faint resistance of the
slingers and archers, who had not even time to
draw the short swords with which they were
to support the charge of the chivalry, penetrate
almost to where the knights of the
royal train surrounded Prince Lewis, while
the oriflamme shook in the standard-bearer's
grasp at the successful temerity of the assault.
The assault was indeed successful; but Sir
Amirald and his band, after their fierce force
was spent, were repelled, and recoiled like a
wave from a rock, retreating in foam and
shivers, but rallying for the return even in
the retreat. They were nobly upheld: De
Foix and De Comminges gave their steeds
the rein, and, lowering their heads to shun
the sling-stones and arrows, they "charged
with all their chivalry" in aid of Sir Amirald:
half-way he met them, like a spent
swimmer on a wave; "Once more, once
more," he gasped, "noble De Foix, noble De
Comminges, and the day is ours: the Dauphin's
band is all disarrayed; the wings
wander wide."&mdash;"Seize the Dauphin, and

<!-- vol 4 page 183 -->

the day and the field is ours," cried De Foix,
spurring faster. "What, boy, doth thy mettle
fail now?"</p>

<p>Amirald's heart burned and bled at the
thought of meeting the Crusaders as a foe;
but the din of battle had stunned his ears,
and the flame of fight was glowing in his
eyes: he bowed his head, couched his lance,
and spurred fiercely on with the rest. The
first essay of Sir Amirald had broken and
scattered the centre of the Crusaders;
and now, on that broken and scattered
array, the furious assault of the confederate
Counts had its full effect: they charged,
retired for a moment, wheeled and charged
again, leaving at every attack as many corses
behind them as blows had been struck.</p>

<p>The Crusaders, who at first had almost
scorned to exchange blows with their
assailants, now began to gather round the
oriflamme, to shield the sacred life of the
Prince, leaving their men-at-arms to be
slaughtered and trampled down without regard.
The Dauphin himself, too late aware

<!-- vol 4 page 184 -->

of the presumption and temerity that always
prompted the first movements of the Crusaders,
began to throw anxious looks toward
the wings, now wandering far and
wide. "Where is the Bishop of Toulouse?"
cried Lewis.&mdash;"Within the walls of Tarascon
by this time," said Sir Aymer, who still rode
near him, "if steed and steel hold out."&mdash;"Prophet
of evil!" cried the Dauphin, darting
a furious glance at him;&mdash;"but we shall soon
have better tidings: hither rides a knight
from the bishop's host."&mdash;"My lord the
Dauphin!" cried the panting messenger, "the
Bishop of Toulouse commends him to you:
the holy and valiant prelate hath won the
city of Tarascon, and prays you but to send
a hundred men-at-arms to aid him to maintain
his post."&mdash;"Meet state we are in,"
said Lewis chafing, "to lend him aid! Look
thou how the tusks of those boars, De Foix
and De Comminges, have gored our van!
Let the bishop recall his forces on the instant,
nor dream of his vaunted victory
while the life of his liege lord is in peril!"&mdash;"I

<!-- vol 4 page 185 -->

will do your message," said the knight, who
fell dead of his wounds as he turned his
reins to ride. "Nought but blood and death
around us!" cried Lewis: "where is Simon
de Montfort?"&mdash;"Far on his way to gain
the pass between the castle of Tarascon and
the city," said Sir Aymer, "lest the former
should yield support to the heretics."&mdash;"<i>Par
le sang des Rois</i>," cried Lewis, gnashing his
teeth with fury, "madness seems to have
taken possession of all the host! In the
name of all the fiends, how chances it that
De Montfort is intercepting aid from a castle,
which is held for the Crusaders by the trusty
Lambert de Limons?"&mdash;"Perchance it may
be necessary to secure it for thine escape,
Prince Dauphin," continued Sir Aymer;
" 'specially if the close of this day resemble
its beginning?"&mdash;"Raven, cease thy croaking!"
cried the Dauphin fiercely. "Valiant
knights," he added, "there will be but short
trial of your patience. I see aid advancing
from yon hill, the forces of Vaugelas and
De Limosin. Ride up yon hill, valiant

<!-- vol 4 page 186 -->

knights, we shall thence command a better
view, and be safe for a while from
these fierce assailants! Lord Abbot of
Normoutier, (for the abbot had once more
been induced to ride at the head of his
church vassals with the Crusaders,) ride
up! See you not a descending band
sweeping like a mist down yon hills? And
see&mdash;and see, a messenger rides fast; he
comes with good tidings!"&mdash;"Holy St.
Benedict," cried the abbot of Normoutier,
"did ever messenger of good tidings ride so
ill-bested? He is stuck through with arrows,
and can scarce sit his horse."&mdash;"Think you
so, my lords?" said the Dauphin to his panting
train, who, most of them wounded, had
with difficulty gained the summit of the hill.
There was no time for conjecture: the messenger,
who was a scout of their own, sent
out to reconnoitre the advancing aid, returned
stuck with arrows, a score of archers
in full pursuit of him, (or, in the language of
the chase, growing to his haunches), but dispersing
as his fleet but wounded steed bore

<!-- vol 4 page 187 -->

him beyond their reach, while the loyal
vassal, though mortally wounded, shouted
"<i>Sauve qui peut!</i> Raymond of Toulouse is in
the field, crying 'No quarter;' and the incarnate
devil, clad like a knight in sable armour,
fights by his side. All mortal aid is vain.
Betake you to shrift, noble knights for me,
my task is done. It is a bloody day; it will
be a bloodier night!" He fell from his horse
as he spoke. He died; and none marked his
end.</p>

<p>The terrible intelligence of Count Raymond
being in the field, the fearful report
(credible enough in those days) of the evil
spirit himself being his auxiliary, and the
certainty of their being thus enclosed between
two hosts,&mdash;the troops of De Foix and De
Comminges, and those of Count Raymond,&mdash;sent
a terror to every heart. "Save, save
the Dauphin!" was the universal cry. Lewis
was not wanting either in generosity or in
valour. He dashed something like a tear
from his eye, and then held a brief council

<!-- vol 4 page 188 -->

with the few who were near him in this last
exigency.</p>

<p>"Sir Aymer, what think'st thou?" he said.&mdash;"That
the oriflamme of France was never in
such danger since it was blessed by the holy
Abbot Luger, on the deliverance of thine
ancestor Lewis VI." answered the blunt but
faithful knight.&mdash;"Gaston de Mortigny,"
said the Dauphin to his standard-bearer,
"what is thy counsel?"&mdash;"The same that I
gave your highness' father at the battle of
Bovines," said the firm knight: "I told King
Philip, that, while the oak stood, the branch
should never be rent from its trunk; and, if
your grace so please, the branch shall cleave
to the royal sapling this day, as it did to
the ancient trunk, let the storm blow as it
lists."&mdash;"Then <i>let</i> the storm blow as it lists!"
cried Prince Lewis, tossing his arms with
agitated action, like the oak in a tempest;
and all the knights around him shouted,
"Let the storm blow as it lists!" and clashing
their lances against their shields, drowned
their redoubled shouts in the martial sound.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 189 -->

<p>A dreadful scene was going on in another
part of the field. The Bishop of Toulouse
found the post in the city of Tarascon, that
his desperate valour had won, untenable.
The messengers he had dispatched for aid
had either perished, or returned with disastrous
tidings of the Dauphin being hotly
beset in the centre, and demanding succour
instead of being able to yield it. The bishop
kept his steady and far-seeing eye fixed on
the oriflamme. "Gaston de Mortigny holds
the standard still," he said internally; "the
Dauphin is but panic-struck." Meanwhile,
he saw and recognized the banners of Count
Raymond on the hills; while De Comminges,
at that moment, had detached his powers to
assail him as he burst from the walls of
Tarascon, that he could no longer keep, to
hew his way back to the distracted and
harassed centre of the host. He paused a
moment: the approach of Raymond of Toulouse
was inevitable&mdash;the assault of De Comminges
was not less so; and the bishop, wiping
his "mailed brow with his bloody hand,"

<!-- vol 4 page 190 -->

computed calmly that a thousand lives must
be lost, ere he could win the centre of the
host. With his voice of thunder he shouted
to his followers, whom he was about to sacrifice;
with his battle-axe, wielded with resistless
might, he began to deal death among
all that encountered him. His strokes fell
like a woodman's&mdash;not on oaks that he
cleaved, but on twigs that he shred; and the
whole forest of the field went crushing down
before him. He struck De Comminges
below his horse's hoofs; he mowed down his
train like rushes before a peasant's staff; he
trampled on the dying bodies of his own
men-at-arms. Yet, still there appeared "a
great gulf fixed" between him and the
centre of the host, where, though safety was
doubtful, it could alone be won. De Foix,
Sir Amirald, and their powers, rallying after
their third sally to respire, and to dispatch
aid to the fainting and defeated wing led by
De Comminges, pushed their gored and
panting steeds up a small eminence to reconnoitre.
Here they paused for a moment; and

<!-- vol 4 page 191 -->

Amirald's kindling eye rested with involuntary
admiration on the progress of the Bishop
of Toulouse, while he</p>

<p class="small">"Mowed across and made irregular harvest,<br/>

Defaced the pomp of battle,"<sup id="ref060"><a href="#en060">60</a></sup></p>

<p>trampling a hundred lives beneath him, and
menacing a thousand more by the resistless
might that had laid those hundreds low.</p>

<p>De Foix, after surveying the field for a
moment, exclaimed, "If Raymond of Toulouse
<i>be</i> in the field&mdash;if Raymond <i>be</i> in the
field&mdash;his war-word will be <i>Point de quartier!</i>
Get thee a fresh steed, Sir Amirald, and
charge once more. They are marching like
the wind towards the Castle of Tarascon:
that betokens disaster and defeat. Throw
thyself between them and the Castle of
Tarascon, and leave the day to me."</p>

<p>Sir Amirald cast one reluctant look of
brave regret on the routed and prostrate
wing of De Comminges, and hastened to
obey the order of De Foix.</p>

<p>All the loyal chivalry of France had

<!-- vol 4 page 192 -->

gathered round the Dauphin. He sat on
his steed for some moments, agitated less
by his danger than by that enthusiasm of
devoted hearts that his own was too full
to answer. He paused&mdash;fluctuated&mdash;turned
his eyes towards the Castle of Tarascon&mdash;cast
them again on the brave band that
rallied round him. His foot was half in
the stirrup to fly&mdash;his hand on his sword
to fight&mdash;when the Bishop of Toulouse,
dyed in blood (but not his own) from heel
to helm, spurred the third steed he had
bestrided that day by the Dauphin's side.
"My lord the Dauphin," he cried, "why
this delay? Save your royal life, and let
those of your subjects pay their prince's
ransom!" The Prince hesitated. The counsel
of those who surrounded him was all
various and contradictory. "Seek the ramparts
of the Castle of Tarascon!" cried some.&mdash;"Seek
no rampart but that of the bodies
of thy foes, that these loyal lances shall soon
rear around thee!" cried others.&mdash;"Cease
your vain tumult, knights!" shouted the

<!-- vol 4 page 193 -->

commanding voice of the bishop. "Raymond
of Toulouse is in the field!"&mdash;"And
men say the incarnate fiend fights beneath
his banner!" cried the sole survivor of the
bishop's train.&mdash;"An' it be so," cried the
Abbot of Normoutier, "it is time for me to
quit the field: I marched against mortal
men; but I am no match for the devil."&mdash;"Coward
priest! desertest thou thus?"
cried Prince Lewis, as the abbot, with his
numerous train, turned his reins; his crosier-bearer
riding fast in the van.&mdash;"Recreant
and disloyal churchman! dost thou fly&mdash;and
at such a moment?" shouted the Bishop
of Toulouse, as the advancing banners of
Count Raymond waved over the diminished
and distracted host of the Crusaders, like
the wings of ravens over anticipated corses.&mdash;"<i>Do
pignora certa timendo</i>," quoth the
abbot, clapping spurs to his steed; while
all the church vassals followed fast, the
crosier glittering in the van.&mdash;"False priest!"
cried the Bishop of Toulouse, "would there
were a bow in mine hand, and the arrow

<!-- vol 4 page 194 -->

should nail thee to the earth as thou ridest.
Prince Dauphin, take counsel for thy life;
escape to the Castle of Tarascon. The
arrows of Count Raymond's host are already
galling the flanks of thine. Some strange
misadventure hath befallen us to-day. Win
but the Castle of Tarascon, and to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"On
to the castle! my best
lord," shouted a thousand voices;&mdash;and
Prince Lewis set on, well trusting that Simon
de Montfort had secured his safe reception
there.&mdash;"Take my reins," said the desponding
prince to Gaston de Mortigny as he rode;
"I am no longer fit to guide even mine own
steed."&mdash;"My prince," said the firm standard-bearer,
"mine hand was never wont to sustain
other burthen than that of the oriflamme;
and it shall be severed from my body ere it
quit its grasp."</p>

<p>Voices on voices now shouted, "Haste!
my liege, haste!&mdash;the foe perceives our disarray."&mdash;"Raymond
of Toulouse presses
on our rear!" cried others, thronging fast
with their disastrous tidings.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 195 -->

<p>Lewis stood stupefied with shame and
despair. Starting at length from his trance,
"Take thou this shield," he cried, flinging it
to a page; "and take thou this," to another,
tearing off his surcoat, emblazoned with
the royal lilies and the cross of the Crusaders;
"a fugitive should no longer bear
the insignia of a leader!"</p>

<p>De Foix marked their disarray. "Ride
up!&mdash;ride up! Sir Amirald," he cried; "take
two&mdash;take two hundred&mdash;take three&mdash;take
all my choicest men, and throw thyself
between the Crusaders and the Castle of
Tarascon. My devoir, as brother-in-arms,
binds me to rescue De Comminges." They
parted each on his desperate enterprise; and
that instantaneous parting was like the eruption
of distinct flashes of lightning from an
overcharged cloud.</p>

<p>As Sir Amirald rode, his eye involuntarily
glanced (in spite of the deathful impetuosity
of his speed,) on the scenery that surrounded
the defile through which he pressed.
The banners of Count Raymond surmounted

<!-- vol 4 page 196 -->

the distant hills; his van rushed glittering
from their summits, and amid their windings,
the track of the gemmed and gilded crosier,
glancing and disappearing as the riders
wound up the eminences and descended the
declivities, marked the flight of the Abbot of
Normoutier. But all power of observation
was lost, when he hasted to fling himself
between the power of the Crusaders
and the Castle of Tarascon; for at his first
approach, the castle, which till that moment
had stood like a dark, unexploding
volcano, from bartizan and battlement, from
every loop and shothole, rained down such
a shower from bow and arbalist, that half
the boldest that Sir Amirald led lay corses
beneath the first discharge, and the second
rank who succeeded formed as they fell
only a rampart for those who followed to
scale, and meet the same fate ere they had
climbed the dreadful and slippery ascent of
mangled bodies and streaming blood.</p>

<p>Lambert de Limons, an expert tactician,
had reserved all his artillery for the crisis

<!-- vol 4 page 197 -->

which he foresaw, and its effect was complete.
It was in vain that Sir Amirald
tried to rally his powers; exclusive of the
shot from the loopholes, that fell like the
gigantic hail on the foes of Joshua, fifty
cross-bow-men stationed on the bartizan,
(like riflemen in modern tactics,) of whom
every one could shoot "five hundred feet
him fro," were ranged there, taking down
at their leisure man and life. Sir Amirald
felt his post untenable: he was about to
wind his bugle to recall the few survivors,
when an unusual movement among the
Crusaders made him pause.</p>

<p>The Dauphin and the Bishop of Toulouse,
with their trains, in taking their determination
to seek shelter in the Castle of Tarascon,
had reckoned on their safe arrival there,
as the wing of their army led by Simon de
Montfort was almost under its towers; but
ere their flight (for such it was) could bear
them to the spot, Sir Amirald was there,
and Simon de Montfort was already mortally
wounded.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 198 -->

<p>All now was tumult and consternation.
De Montfort, whose fierce spirit predominated
even in death, called for a fresh steed, but
vainly attempted to mount him. Mental
terrors, hitherto unknown, seemed working
together with his bodily suffering. From
the moment that he had heard the wild
report of an evil spirit in the guise of a sable
knight riding in aid of Count Raymond,
he had exclaimed that it was the spirit of
the Count de Beziers, (of whose murder he
was more than suspected,) and exclaimed
that whenever he attempted to raise his
battle-axe, a hand in black armour lay on
his arm, and weighed down by its pressure
soul and brand. But at the voice of Prince
Lewis he seemed madly excited once more,
and grasping the arm of his squire, "Thou
seest," he said, "this gash on my forehead
so overflows mine eyes with blood that I can
no longer see to guide my reins; place me,
I charge thee, faithful Raoul, right before
the Dauphin; and on my feet, while they
can support me, I will do a warrior's deeds,

<!-- vol 4 page 199 -->

or die a warrior's death."&mdash;"Stay not to
listen to this madman, my liege," cried the
Bishop of Toulouse; "make for the castle
ere all be lost." The bishop's action gave
full warrant for his words; he spurred right
onward towards the barrier that Sir Amirald's
band presented betwixt him and the
castle: "the iron sleet of arrowy shower"
that had rained from the Castle of Tarascon
intermitted on the bishop's approach; the
garrison, by the direction of Lambert de
Limons, sparing their foes, lest they should
destroy their friends. Amirald seized the
moment to extend his line between the lowered
drawbridge and the approach of the
bishop's power.</p>

<p>The bishop paused on his desperate position:
the protended lances of Amirald's band
were before him. Suddenly forsaking his
stirrups, with a hand of iron he twice
and thrice plunged his dagger into the
quivering flanks of his steed; and the noble animal, agonizing under the blows, with
one spring cleared the lances of the band,

<!-- vol 4 page 200 -->

and fell on his haunches amid its centre.
Another stab of the dagger raised him in a
moment: the bishop forsook the reins, and
wielded his battle-axe. He had plunged like a
rock falling into the ocean, but the dispersed
waves soon recoiled. Many lay crushed beneath
the weight of the impulse: others rose;
and others, who could not rise, grasped with
their maimed and dying hands at the bishop's
reins, which lay loose on the neck of his steed.
Those hands were severed by the blows of
his battle-axe, wielded right and left with
a velocity and force as resistless as they are
indescribable; and the last spring of his martyred
steed lodged the bishop on the drawbridge
of the Castle of Tarascon. "Follow
him&mdash;follow the valiant prelate, my liege!"
cried the Crusaders. Prince Lewis spurred
his steed.</p>

<p>At that moment, a sortie from the Castle
pouring over the lowered drawbridge, forced
Sir Amirald on, spite of himself, till in the
tide of battle his hand was on the Dauphin's
rein. "Base renegade!" cried a voice,

<!-- vol 4 page 201 -->

"lay'st thou hand on thy prince's rein?"&mdash;"What
am I now?" said Lewis, as, stupefied,
he appeared to ask of Amirald whether
he were prisoner. "What art thou? The
Dauphin of France still," answered the voice.&mdash;"Leave
me to deal with this Sir Knight
Sans-barbe." And his blow, wielded with no
light hand, made Sir Amirald yield hold of
the Dauphin's rein, and turn in his own defence.
His antagonist, by many evolutions
performed with more skill than force, but
which proved him master of the strategy of
the age, succeeded in drawing Sir Amirald
to some distance from the spot. Amirald,
incensed at being thus deluded, and baffled
by one whose hoary beard was visible
through the bars of his helmet, now struck
with such good aim and hearty hand, that
the old knight almost breathless exclaimed,
"Hold, sir boy! By heaven, thou smitest
like Guillaume <i>le Charpentier</i>,<sup id="ref061"><a href="#en061">61</a></sup> in the old

<!-- vol 4 page 202 -->

Crusades. No marvel thou art silent: thou
lackest all thy breath for such blows."&mdash;Amirald answered him in the words of an old
chivalric song&mdash;</p>

<p class="small"><i>Un Chevalier, n'en doutez pas,<br/>

Doit ferir hault, et parler bas</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Say'st thou me so?" said the old knight,
whose associations appeared to be awakened,
but in no friendly manner, by the sound of
his voice. "Then have at thee!" and he
dealt a blow at the casque of Amirald
(the rivets of which were loosened in the
struggle of the day) with such good-will
and steady aim, that it rolled on the
ground; and his head was exposed to the
next blow of his adversary. It descended,
but was paralyzed in its descent as
Sir Aymer discovered the features of his
former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Amirald. Its force was,
however, such as to lay the young knight prostrate
before him. "Strike," said Amirald;
"but, as thou art a knight, protect a young

<!-- vol 4 page 203 -->

female in yon beleaguered and distressed
town, whom thou hast, I believe, bereft of
all other protector." Sir Aymer was at the
moment beside Amirald, and supporting him
on his knee as he lay. "Protect <i>her!</i>" he
cried, almost in tears, "<i>her</i> who hath been
thy ruin? Now, out on her, hilding and
harlot! Could she not be content with going
to the devil her own heretic way, but she
must needs have thee to bear her company?
Look up, my boy, and live; and a fair course
of chivalry and love is yet bright before thee."&mdash;"Oh!"
said the youth, faintly raising himself
on his arm, while a sickening agony overcame
his whole frame,&mdash;"Oh that, instead of defaming
the most pure and heavenly being
of God's creation, thou wouldst adopt her
better creed!"</p>

<p>"Teach me&mdash;tell me it!" cried Sir Aymer
in the overflowings of his kindly heart, as he
bent over his dying favourite. "But, no,
boy; thou mayest spare the labour!" he said
half-sighingly, half-lightly. "I could resign
unintelligible dogmas and inexplicable mysteries;

<!-- vol 4 page 204 -->

but I never, never can resign that
devotion that worships female saints;&mdash;no,
never for thee, dear boy, (and thou wast
very dear to me,) can I give up that dear
devotion. Pshaw! change the visage of
a Madonna for that of one of thy cowled
barbes!"</p>

<p>At this moment a shout from the Crusaders
announced that the Dauphin had
reached the castle in safety; and the loyal-hearted
knights now took the calm counsel
of despair together, like the sailors who
dispatched a boat from their sinking ship
to land James the Second on the coast
of Scotland, and, as he reached it in safety,
gave him three cheers from the deck of their
own devoted vessel.</p>

<p>There was but too much cause for their
despair. De Foix, who had collected the
routed wing of De Comminges, flung his
whole force between the Crusaders and the
Castle of Tarascon. The Bishop of Toulouse,
by desperate valour, aided by the superhuman
strength of his gigantic frame, had

<!-- vol 4 page 205 -->

passed the barrier: so had Prince Lewis, by
the aid of his loyal knights. But as Simon
de Montfort, blinded with his own blood,
and maddened with the agony of his wounds,
was led towards the bridge, a <i>quarrel</i>, from
a cross-bow aimed at De Foix, who stood
nearer the tower, struck on his head,
mingling the fragments of his helmet with
his brains and blood,&mdash;and the Champion
of the Church was no more!<sup id="ref062"><a href="#en062">62</a></sup> The body
was hurried into the castle by the attendants.</p>

<p>The gap thus made in the battle of the
Crusaders was closed in a moment; but the
loss of Simon de Montfort was recalled and
remembered for centuries afterwards.</p>

<p>There was not a moment now to lament
his loss. The powers of Raymond of Toulouse
came on apace, the sable knight raging
like a whirlwind in its van: De Foix and his
band, blazing like a moat of fire between the

<!-- vol 4 page 206 -->

Crusaders and the castle, few passed it with
life, and fewer still who did so survived
long. The strife beneath the walls resembled
more the struggle of demons in their
native element of fire, than the strife of
mortal men. Steed and stirrup, lance and
sword, were forsaken:&mdash;it was breast to
breast&mdash;limb to limb&mdash;dagger to dagger&mdash;heart
to heart,&mdash;canopied by arrow-flight&mdash;darkened
by the discharge of war-wolf and
catapult.</p>

<p>Amid this scene of demoniac horror and
madness, it was admirable to see how the
strong feeling of religion alone armed its
humblest professor in panoply.</p>

<p>The Monk of Montcalm, who had followed
humbly in the rear of the splendid
array of the Abbot of Normoutier, had, on
the first intelligence of his defection, thrown
himself into the Castle of Tarascon; and
now he stood, amid the flight of five hundred
arrows, to do his holy duty by those
who fought and those who fell. Warned of

<!-- vol 4 page 207 -->

his danger, but slighting it, he stationed himself
on the bartizan of the great gate that
commanded the drawbridge. From that
spot he gave the general benediction to the
hundreds that were perishing; and then,
exalting his voice and straining his sight,
attempted to give absolution to the individuals
whom he saw claiming it: and, amid
the horror and tumult of that mortal fight,
many a dying Crusader turned his swimming
eye, and tried to clasp his blood-steeped
hands, and to raise his maimed and
shattered limbs, to meet the last blessing, or
even to catch the last sight, of the holy Monk
of Montcalm!</p>

<p>At the first shout, announcing the escape
of the Dauphin, Sir Aymer, who had led his
antagonist from the spot merely to secure his
Prince's safety, began, now that that was
provided for, to think of his own. "Farewell!"
he cried: "and yet it pities my very
heart to leave thee thus; though I may be
in worse plight myself, an' I tarry longer. I

<!-- vol 4 page 208 -->

must needs leave the devil and the heretic
together to settle accounts: I will defer the
closing of mine with him while I can:"&mdash;and
he galloped off. Yet, with a touch of his
natural kindliness of heart, returning for a
moment, he told Amirald, that if he could
reach the city of Tarascon, he might shelter
there in safety; as the report of the plagues
raging there was a mere <i>ruse</i>, invented by
Lambert de Limons, and executed by the
malignity of the dying wretch, who was in
fact its only victim.</p>

<p>As he disappeared, the eyes of Amirald,
swimming in mortal sickness, were lifted
towards the hills on which the giant form of
the sable knight rode, careering like the
master and compeller of the stormy clouds
that were gathering fast on their summits.
His train came far behind, for not one dared
to ascend or descend the precipices abreast of
him, nor even on the plain could they match
for a moment the supernatural fleetness of
his course. Amirald's senses failed him as
he gazed on this portentous figure and its

<!-- vol 4 page 209 -->

movements; and saw the hills dimly mixed
in his swimming vision with the form that
swept along them. When he recovered from
his trance, he found himself in a glen, small,
narrow, and solitary, apart from the battle,
but not from its roar, whose thunders from
time to time startled its lonely echoes. His
first sensation was amazement at finding himself
in a place of comparative safety: he raised
himself slowly on his elbow like one who,
awaking from slumber, sees himself conveyed
into an unknown chamber, and wonders how
he was brought there. There was no one to
tell him that the sable knight had commanded
some of his train, who were about
to nail him to the earth where he lay, to
raise and convey him to the nearest place of
possible safety. There was, indeed, no one to
tell this, or aught else; for Amirald soon perceived
that the glen was choked with dead
bodies up to the bases of the rocks that enclosed
it. They were the bodies of some of
De Foix's band; and this pass seemed to have
been disputed with mortal hostility: every

<!-- vol 4 page 210 -->

man had fallen where he fought, and every
man lay on his back as he fell.</p>

<p>As Amirald looked round on this death-place
of unburied corses, the agonizing thirst
excited by his wounds was aggravated by the
sound of "gurgling waters near;" and the
lonely, gentle sound was a kind of rebuke
uttered by Nature to the outrages exercised
by man in her holiest quietudes.</p>

<p>Amirald tried to raise and drag himself in
the direction of the sound. As he crawled
over the dead bodies&mdash;for he could not move
without touching or treading on one&mdash;a groan
issued beneath his feet: he started&mdash;it came
from one that yet lived. Amirald, stooping,
tried to recognize form or lineament in the
breather; but he was so mangled and crushed
by his wounds and fall, that his mother, searching
the field, would not have known her own
child.</p>

<p>Forgetting the thirst that parched him,
Amirald toiled to raise the sufferer, and at
length dragged from beneath the weight of
incumbent bodies the giant-form of Boanerges.

<!-- vol 4 page 211 -->

Amirald's short warfare under the banners
of De Foix had made him acquainted
with the name and person of the warlike
pastor, and with increasing effort he succeeded
at last in placing him with his back
against a rock. He was dying. Amirald made
his way to the spring&mdash;tasted it&mdash;brought back
some drops in his cloven shield, and bathed
the brow and lip of the dying man. They
refreshed him. "Raise me up," cried Boanerges,
"if thou hast any christian mercy."&mdash;"I
will," said the youth, "if my failing
strength can sustain thee; but I fear thy state
is past all hope."&mdash;"It is not that," said Boanerges&mdash;"it
is not that; but did I not hear, as
I fell&mdash;or was it a dream in my deadly trance?
hath the oppressor ceased? is Simon de Montfort
dead."&mdash;"Simon de Montfort hath perished,"
said Amirald, "and the Crusaders
are defeated. The powers of De Foix and De
Comminges, aided by Raymond of Toulouse,
hold the field."&mdash;"Raise me higher, higher,
good youth," cried the stern Albigeois, "that
I may see the slaughter&mdash;the slaughter of the

<!-- vol 4 page 212 -->

enemies of the Lord, while my dying eyes yet
can behold it."&mdash;"In the name of God," cried
Amirald, shuddering at this posthumous vindictiveness,
"turn your mind to better
thoughts. I am not so well versed in thy
creed as thou must be; but does it suggest
no other comfort at thy dying hour?"</p>

<p>"The everlasting hills take part against
them," cried Boanerges: "they reel round and
charge; and their leaders are the storms and
the clouds that have so often been the shelter
of the Albigeois; they are weaving winding-sheets
for them on the hill-tops. The spirits
of those who perished there are coming to greet
them, mother and babe; but"&mdash;extending his
mangled arms towards the Castle of Tarascon&mdash;"Simon
de Montfort hath perished,
and envies his victims already."</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" cried Amirald, "think not
of such things now&mdash;speak not so fearfully;"
and, in involuntary forgetfulness of his
new creed, he held up his cross-handled sword
to fix the eyes of the dying man on the symbol

<!-- vol 4 page 213 -->

of redemption. A rigid pallor had overspread
the face of Boanerges; but at the
sight of the cross his eyes kindled with a
ghastly light, and lifting his maimed hand,
"Take away the abomination!" he cried: then
in a fainter voice, "Nay, let me see it once
more; the blade is red with Crusaders' blood."
He gazed, smiled, and expired.</p>

<p>Amirald now felt as if alone on earth: the
last survivor near him lay a corse at his feet.
He turned his heavy eyes towards the Castle
of Tarascon, where the work of death was
still going on; for the powers of Count Raymond
were now almost beneath its walls, mowing
down by hundreds the remains of the
Crusaders, who, dispirited by the fate of De
Montfort and the flight of the Dauphin and
the Bishop of Toulouse, seemed to submit to
their fate with the passiveness of sheep penned
in a fold to the unresisted ravages of a
band of wolves. As band after band of Raymond's
army swept along the hills, Amirald
raised his voice, and waved his bloody scarf, to
call for aid; as he felt that a knight of De Foix's

<!-- vol 4 page 214 -->

army would meet prompt assistance from the
allied band of the Count of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The thunder of their speed drowned his
feeble appeal: his weakness increased; and he
was sinking down half in stupor, half in despair,
to die, when the tones of a heart-remembered
voice, uttered in the most piercing
distress, roused him in a moment to life and
energy. Other bands besides those of Raymond
were traversing the field: among them
were some of the troops of the Bishop of Toulouse,
whom he had led within the very walls
of the city in his first wild and unsupported
assault, and had left behind him to fight
back their desperate way, or to perish. A
few had succeeded in the former attempt;
but previously they had encumbered themselves
with some rich plunder in the town,
and some females distinguished for beauty&mdash;and
aware of a circuitous direction by which
they might reach the postern of the castle,
they had skirmished on the skirts of the battle,
and now, by the shelter of twilight, dispersing
in small bands and various directions, were

<!-- vol 4 page 215 -->

speeding onwards with their respective plunder.</p>

<p>Amid a share rudely divided and fiercely
contested was Genevieve, whose beauty made
her too precious a prize to be lightly resigned.
As a few, who had parted from the rest,
were hurrying with their victim through the
solitary glen, (as their least dangerous path,)
the sight of Amirald's crest and broken plume
caught her eye, and her shriek of "Save
me for the love of Heaven, save me!"
thrilled in his ringing ears. To start to his
feet, to wave his broken brand, to rush among
the ruffians, and be felled to the earth by
their blows, was but the action of a moment.
Of all that followed he was unconscious: but
his splendid armour marking him as no vulgar
prisoner, his body, still senseless, was borne
into the Castle of Tarascon, when nightfall
rendered the approach to the postern safe;
and along with it was borne that of Genevieve&mdash;not
senseless, indeed, but silent in
despair.</p>

After this golden day of victory.</p>

<p class="right">SHAKSPEARE'S <i>Henry the Sixth</i>.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>COUNT Raymond of Toulouse feasted
that night in his tent, with all his warriors,
in the pride of victory. Their spirits were
elated, and with reason. This was no triumph
by ambuscade over the Crusaders, like
the first they had obtained;&mdash;no desultory
skirmish, like that in which the Bishop of
Toulouse's troops had been cut off by the
Count, when he attempted to intercept the
progress of the Albigeois towards Arragon:&mdash;they
had met the Crusaders in their might,
face to face, and in pitched battle had defied
and defeated them. Meanwhile goblets were
filled and drained to the pledge of "<i>Vive

<!-- vol 4 page 217 -->

Toulouse!</i>" and already, in the imagination
of the revellers, the Count was established
in his territorial city, and his subjects allowed
the free exercise of their religion.</p>

<p>Count Raymond sat and listened; sometimes
elated and sometimes depressed, as he heard
the boasts of victory lately achieved. He
remembered how often he had been thus
hailed and greeted by lips that were now
cold! He dwelt inwardly on a wearying
recollection of war, woe, persecution, and
vicissitude for twenty years, with gleams
of success between, like the brief light of
a sun in a wintry sky, darkness fast following.
As he thought thus, he raised the goblet
to his lips and drained it; resolving to
forget the past if he could, and to enjoy the
present. The debate of the knights struck
on his ear without exciting his attention, till
one of them demanded, "Wherefore did not
that sable knight, who had such noble share
in our toil to-day, meet us at the feast
to-night?"&mdash;"Who hath seen him but in battle?"

<!-- vol 4 page 218 -->

said another. "He shuns all human converse
and society."&mdash;"He never assists at
mass, nor utters his prayers apart, like an
Albigeois," added another speaker.</p>

<p>The mention of the sable knight's name was
like "the letting out of water:" report followed
report, and whisper whisper. "Though he
shuns all converse," it was said, "he talks
often with that ill-favoured page who ever
follows him,&mdash;more like the imp of a wizard
than the attendant of a noble knight."</p>

<p>"Who hath ever seen his visor unclosed,"
asked an ancient knight, "since he
hath joined our host?"&mdash;"Who would wish
to see it?" replied another: "his casque
to-day sustained blows that would have felled
earthly man."&mdash;"And the arrows slew right
and left," said another, "but pierced not him:
they glanced on his mail like chaff flung
against the wind."&mdash;"And his steed, with five
barbed arrows quivering in its flank, and its
sides all gore, made a leap that no mortal steed
ever made, bestrode by mortal rider," added
another.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 219 -->

<p>"Count of Toulouse," said the ancient
knight, "I would rather lose the fairest
field that ever mortal arm struck in, were
life the wage and a throne the prize, than
win it by evil aid, such as I dread was marshalled
on thy side to-day in the form of
that unknown knight."</p>

<p>"Noble sir," said the Count, with his
wonted fluctuation, "you think not so
darkly of the stranger?&mdash;and yet, perchance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heed him not, noble Count Raymond!"
said a youthful knight&mdash;"heed not those
dreams! I saw nought achieved by this
sable knight, as ye call him, beyond mortal
prowess." A murmur was heard among the
knights. "I say," he continued, raising his
voice, "the fears of the cravens he dealt with
first distorted him into a fiend; and then
they ran away from the fiend their fears had
raised."</p>

<p>"Fair lord," said the ancient knight, "may
I be heard?"&mdash;"With all good favour," said

<!-- vol 4 page 220 -->

the Count. "What is it you would demand,
sir knight?"&mdash;"How this nameless knight
chanced to lend you the aid of his arm, of
which all must allow the might, though
many may doubt by whom that might is
given?"&mdash;"I will tell ye," said Count Raymond,
as if he felt relief like that which confession
gives to a penitent,&mdash;"I will tell ye.
Hearken, noble gentlemen and friends, all of
you."</p>

<p>He leaned with his arms on the table as
he spoke, looking thoughtfully the heads
of all within hearing were closely inclined
towards him, and many a cheek was pale
at the expected tale, which the approach of
danger and death that day had tinged only
with a fiercer red.</p>

<p>"It was on the evening," said Count Raymond,
"that the sufferings of my oppressed
vassals, and the treachery and pride of
Rome, had compelled me once more to take
up arms in their defence, and trust their
cause and mine once more to heaven:&mdash;on

<!-- vol 4 page 221 -->

that evening I sat sadly in my chamber,
having only two of my household squires
near me, while I revolved in my own troubled
and silent thought, how much and vainly
I had consulted for the welfare of my
subjects; seeking, I appeal to God, only
their good, while I was ever, alas! unwillingly
working them evil. I thought of the wars
I had been forced into; the peaces I had
been compelled to make; the concessions to
the Holy Father, that had been followed
only by fresh encroachments; and the resistance,
that had been punished by severer
chastisement: and I sighed as I beheld my
shield once more taken from the wall
of my chamber. It waxed late, when a
page entered, followed by him ye call the
sable knight. He advanced in silence, with
the bars of his helmet closed. I commanded
to place a seat for him: he declined it,
waving his hand, but still in silence. I do
vouch, noble friends, though the knight met
my greeting courteously, there was something

<!-- vol 4 page 222 -->

chilling in his presence; such as, perchance,
yourselves may have felt at times."
A responsive shudder among the guests answered
him. "He spoke at length," continued
Raymond. " 'Lord Count,' he said,
'thou art about to do battle against thy
foes: I offer thee the aid of my lance and
sword; perchance thou wilt not find them
powerless. But I demand of thee three conditions,
on which my service shall be duly tendered&mdash;that
thou never demand my name,
or ask why my shield bears no cognizance;
that thou never require that the bars of my
visor be unclosed; and lastly, that if this
arm achieve thee victory, thou wilt grant
whatever boon I ask, save thine honour, life,
and faith.' I yielded and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"This we
have heard," said the ancient knight. "But,
lord of Toulouse, thou hast another tale
to tell of this stranger knight, or report
wrongs thee and him foully?"&mdash;"It is true,"
said Count Raymond; "there is a tale&mdash;a passage&mdash;that
did, in a manner, force on me

<!-- vol 4 page 223 -->

the fear (the feeling I would say) that our
dark associate is formed of other mould than
mortal men."&mdash;"Reserve the disclosure for
a fitter occasion," said a voice close beside
Count Raymond's chair. Count Raymond
sank back in his seat, but lifted his eye
slowly in the direction whence the voice
proceeded.</p>

<p>The sable knight stood there, unannounced,
unattended even by the ill-favoured
page, his constant companion. At
the sound so suddenly heard, many of the
knights started on their feet, and unsheathed
their daggers; while others cowered
where they sat, and hid their foreheads in
their clasped hands for a time. The tent
was lit only by one large lamp, suspended
from the roof right over the centre of the
table where the guests sat; and during the
earnest conversation between them and
Count Raymond, the pages had neglected
to trim it, so that only a dim and waning
light fell on the darkened group with their

<!-- vol 4 page 224 -->

gleaming daggers, and the towering form
and ebon-like mail of the sable knight.</p>

<p>"Sir sable knight," said Count Raymond,
at length recovering himself, "your appearance
amongst us hath been somewhat sudden,
but is not the less welcome: I pray you,
sit, and partake of our cheer." The figure
in the sable armour shook its head in silence.
"Sir sable knight, I pledge you in a cup
of wine: you will not refuse my pledge!"
A silent gesture of disinclination was again
the only answer. "By my faith, sir knight,
this is somewhat discourteous; but if thou
wilt neither partake of our feast, nor answer
to our fair terms of courtesy, declare, after
what manner likes thee best, thy purpose
and thy pleasure here." The figure, by silent
but emphatic gestures, signified its wish
to speak with him alone. Count Raymond's
cheek changed its hue at this invitation;
and twenty voices, in eager whispers,
murmured, "Go not with him, lord Count,
at peril of thy life&mdash;or more!" The figure

<!-- vol 4 page 225 -->

did not utter a sound, but continued to repeat
its gestures with such an air of gentle
invitation, and such a sorrowful inclination
of the head withal, that Raymond, ashamed
of his fears, rose from his seat, and withdrawing
the curtain of a recess in the pavilion,
entered it, followed by the figure, leaving
on the minds of his guests an impression of
anxious and indefinable awe. For some time
not a word was spoken; nothing could be
heard but the rustling of the mantles of the
guests, as they laid down their untasted wine
to gaze on the closed aperture, and then
hushed the sound, to watch what might
issue from it: but not a breath could be
heard&mdash;all within the pavilion was as still
as death. To their high-wrought anxiety
the delay seemed protracted, and their very
silence was becoming insupportable to
themselves, when suddenly a deep and
prolonged groan burst on their ears, and
steps were heard passing from the pavilion.
There was no restraining them now:

<!-- vol 4 page 226 -->

they rushed into the recess, where they
found only Count Raymond, who, after a
hurried inquiry into the cause of their intrusion,
and an assurance, in a broken voice,
of his safety, returned with them into the
pavilion, and took his seat at the board
again.</p>

<p>But from that moment the taciturnity
of his companion seemed to have possessed
him: his goblet stood beside him untouched,
and the most earnest and searching inquiries
could not extort from him a syllable
relative to his conference with the sable
knight. "Press me no farther, lords," he
said at length heavily, "with questions a
solemn oath forbids me to answer. Meanwhile
believe this, that since I was man,
never was I so sore amazed, or in such
deep heaviness of spirit: and now methinks
it waxes late&mdash;A fair good rest to all. Our
wearied and wounded host forbid us to
invest the Castle of Tarascon on to-morrow;
but on the following day we will march
to the assault with all our forces, and shake

<!-- vol 4 page 227 -->

off the gloom which this strange visitation
hath inspired. But, ere we set forth," he
added in a deeper tone, "we must purify
the host, nor hope to prosper with stained
hands, and hearts burthened with unatoned
guilt. A dark and fearful deed hath been
done; and <i>one</i> amongst us must expiate his
crime, even the flesh: for the soul, may God
absolve it." He retired, and every knight
departed silent and thoughtful to his tent.</p>

<p>The sable knight had returned to his,
where, as usual, he found his page, who
never quitted it day or night, awaiting
him. This unfortunate youth appeared to
have been the victim of some deadly distemper:
his figure was slender, though
somewhat awkward; but his hands, and what
could be seen of his face, had the livid and
discoloured hue rather of a corse than of a
living creature. A bandage was over more
than half his face, to conceal the loss of an
eye, which had been extinguished by the
malignity of the disease; while the other
gleamed with a brightness that seemed preternatural,

<!-- vol 4 page 228 -->

when contrasted with the deadly
colour of his features. His shoulders, too, were
bent and distorted: and it was not possible
to conceive a more ghastly and revolting
form than that of the ill-favoured page, whose
inseparability from his mysterious master was
not, in the minds of those who remarked it,
a circumstance likely to diminish the impression
caused by his deformity, profound silence,
and total abstraction from all human companionship.</p>

<p>As the sable knight entered the tent, the
page prepared to touch his harp. "Forbear!"
said the knight: "I am not in the
vein. What star is that," he continued,
looking upward, "that burns so bright in
heaven right above the tent?"&mdash;"Sages call
it Orion," answered the page.&mdash;"Are not
the pure lights of heaven," said the knight,
speaking to himself as was his wont&mdash;"are
they not weary of looking on the crimes and
sorrows of earth? When will they close
their bright eyes, and leave men to do the

<!-- vol 4 page 229 -->

deeds of darkness by the light that best befits
them?" A pause followed, for the page
never spoke till addressed by his lord.
"From whom didst thou learn thy starry
lore?" said the knight.&mdash;"An ancient monk
taught it me, so please you."&mdash;"And was it
a monk who taught thee to touch thy harp
so masterly?"&mdash;"I had another teacher for
that," replied the youth: "a skilful, but a
wondrous harsh one&mdash;it was grief."&mdash;"I believe
thee, in truth," said the knight; "and
never did the hand of pupil counterfeit that
of master so well."&mdash;"Mournful as its touch
is," said the youth, "it hath sometimes won
me back from despair."&mdash;"And me from
madness!" exclaimed the knight, with one
of those stormy bursts of terrible emotion,
which now no longer startled his unfortunate
companion. "Try," he added, "try if
the spell be lost!" The page obeyed, and
accompanied his harp with a voice whose
sweet but wild tones had in them nothing
earthly&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 230 -->

<div class="small">

<p>Oh, sweet is the feeling, and sweet the hour,<br/>

When Fancy, the bounds of existence scorning,<br/>

Restores to past visions of joy their power,<br/>

And the twilight of love beams as bright as its morning!</p>

<p>When day sinks low on its pillar of fire,<br/>

The sky with amethyst glories is beaming;<br/>

The heart reflects its departed gleaming.</p>

<p>But, oh! how much of the mingled and sad<br/>

How sweet and bitter from Memory's cup<br/>

Is the drop that was nectar in Joy's bright bowl!</p>

</div>

<p>"Cease thy strain&mdash;it is all too light,"
said the knight. The page sighed. "And
yet my lord has loved the praise of beauty
well."&mdash;"<i>Once</i>," said the knight, in a voice
that sounded like a groan: "but, I know not
how it is, thy song turns ever on the beauty
of man&mdash;a dull theme&mdash;not on that of women,
one more suited to thy sex."&mdash;"Nor
wonder," said the page, with sudden animation.
"From woman beauty is almost demanded;
the homely are slighted and neglected.
In man we seek but strength, perchance

<!-- vol 4 page 231 -->

symmetry; but when to these is
added beauty, we feel gratitude to nature as
for an unsought favour: it is, in truth, gratuitous
bounty, and we gaze on it with the
same delight that we would on a mountain
fertile in roses, or a palace encrusted with
gems."&mdash;"This is strange speech for one of
thy sex to hold," said the knight. The
youth was silent. "Cheer thee, my boy!"
said the knight, as if answering his silence.
"No woman, in the softness of her sex, could
have been a more faithful attendant on a
wayward lord than thou hast been on me."&mdash;"Oh,
my dear master!" cried the page: and,
grasping the knight's hand while he knelt,
he pressed his livid lips to it, and bathed it
with tears.&mdash;"I have been a stern master to
thee!" said the knight, melting.&mdash;"Oh, no;
ever most gentle and most gracious!"&mdash;"I
have but one task more for thee," said the
knight, collecting his voice; "and then"&mdash;&mdash;He
paused; while the page rose, and folding
his hands on his bosom, stood reverently before
him. "As we passed the shrine of

<!-- vol 4 page 232 -->

holy St. Martin, on the other side the
Rhone," said the knight, in a hurried voice,
"I neglected to pay my devotions there. I
am a sinful man, and would employ the orisons
of one more pure than myself. Go there,
I charge thee, by the dawn, which is now
breaking: four men-at-arms shall be thy
guard, and thy path lies wide of the Crusaders'
post. Offer up thy prayers, and tell
thy beads there for thy unhappy master;
but, at the peril of thy life, return not hither
till the sun hath twice risen on yonder hill."
The unfortunate page seemed to listen as
to his death's doom. He fell on his knees,
apparently in supplication; but at the
stamp of the knight's foot he rose trembling,
and, bursting into an agony of tears,
retired.</p>

<p>The day was now fully broke, and the
knight was slowly, and with head declined,
pacing his tent, when a herald of Count
Raymond appeared at the entrance. The
knight raised his head. "Speak thy lord's
message, and briefly!" he said. "My lord,"

<!-- vol 4 page 233 -->

said the herald, bowing low,&mdash;"my lord
prays you, Sir sable knight, to pause
yet another day on your dreadful purpose;
and if then&mdash;" The knight waved
him off with a gesture of fierce impatience.
"Commend me to thy lord," he
said; and his better nature struggling within
him&mdash;"and thank him, good fellow: but tell
him, that he look to have a scaffold reared in
the centre of his host to-day; for blood that
is flowing now in living veins must stain it
ere many hours be past."&mdash;"Am I to do no
other message to my lord?" said the herald
with sad reluctance. The sable knight paused.&mdash;"Tell
him," said he at length, "that I
pray him to send some holy man to receive
my confession, and, if it be possible, to absolve
my soul. Let none else, at the peril of their
lives, approach this tent to-day!" The herald
departed.</p>

<p>The sable knight's request was not found
easy to be complied with: not an ecclesiastic
in the host of Count Raymond would
undertake the task. But, as the demand had

<!-- vol 4 page 234 -->

been so earnestly and solemnly made, the
Count dispatched a herald with a trumpet to
the Castle of Tarascon, praying them within
of Christian grace to send some holy man to
shrieve a penitent at point to die, and promising
on his knightly word that he should
have safe conduct to and from his camp.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when the holy
man arrived: it was the Monk of Montcalm.
He was conducted immediately to the tent
of the sable knight, which had been inaccessible
to human foot but his all that day.</p>

Some hours elapsed, and at their close the
monk and his penitent were still together;
the proud and lofty form of the knight kneeling
at the feet of the pale monk, who, in the
progress of his confession, (with all its increasing
horrors,) sat with uplifted eyes and
locked hands as he listened.</p>

<p>"She promised," continued the penitent,
"that she would shew my pre-doomed victim
on the very night that the sacrifice was to be
made; and she asked me for my ring, and
swore she would produce it on that night!

<!-- vol 4 page 235 -->

She did but it was my bridal night!&mdash;and
the victim was to be my bride! And such
were her credentials from heaven or hell, that
I believed her. She recalled the very words
of birth-vow&mdash;that I was sworn to sacrifice
the last survivor of mine enemy's race!&mdash;and
that last survivor was she whose hand I
had clasped at the altar that morn! I remember
rushing into the chamber that night
more like a fiend than a bridegroom. There
was but one way to absolve me of my oath,
and yet to shun the impossible crime: I
drew my dagger and&mdash;&mdash;"(the monk caught
his arm)&mdash;"plunged it into mine own bosom!
She saw it. Deeming me mad, she sprang
up and struggled with me for the bloody
weapon. I tried to inflict another&mdash;a mortal
wound; and in the struggle&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Hold!
hold!" cried the monk, gasping.&mdash;"It was not
I!&mdash;not I!" cried the penitent in a piercing
tone of agony: "her own hand dealt the
blow! But when I saw the bosom, so long
pictured in my visions, pierced&mdash;when I beheld
the blood flow, and the body fall&mdash;I

<!-- vol 4 page 236 -->

rushed from the chamber with the speed and
the despair of a fallen spirit hurled from
Heaven. My wounds bled fast; I heeded
them not, but ran on till I fell exhausted.
After that I remember nought. I was for
some months, as they told me, and as I had
fearful cause to believe, where the unhappy
seek to be. The maniac sorceress, whatever
she was, who had urged me to my horrible
fate, watched over my returning health and
reason; but it was for her own deadly purposes,
as a witch watches her cauldron till
the waters seethe and the flames sparkle to
her devilish will. She nursed me, too, in
that unhallowed place, the ruined tower of
Hugo, and gave me for mine attendant that
<i>ill-favoured page</i> who hath furnished such
matter of scoff and slander, but who was,
in truth, a most gentle and feeling boy.
I sent him hence but this morning, that he
might not see me perish."&mdash;"Go on," said
the monk in a tone of singular calmness.&mdash;"I
have nought more to disclose," said the
penitent, "but this: that when restored to

<!-- vol 4 page 237 -->

bodily, not to mental health, I demanded my
horse and arms. They were ready for me,
as if raised by magic power; for that mysterious
being seems always to have wealth at
her will, though not at her use. But when I
declared my purpose of joining the Crusaders
once more, and added the wish that the first
lance levelled by the foe might find my heart,
or the first arrow my brain, she prostrated
herself before me, and, with such inconceivable
agonies of supplication, implored that I
should not draw brand against Count Raymond
of Toulouse: that, all-careless where
I fought, coveting only death, and deeming
that I might as soon find it from a Crusader's
hand as another's, and reckless where, so it
was found, I offered the aid of mine arm to
Count Raymond, on condition&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"I
know the rest," said the monk, "by true
report."&mdash;"Then thou knowest that I have
sought Death in battle&mdash;yea, wooed him&mdash;but
he has not come to me. The arrows missed
me as they flew; the swords struck against
me as if they were rushes: I could not die&mdash;yet

<!-- vol 4 page 238 -->

I will not live:&mdash;and I have demanded
of Count Raymond, as a boon&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"That
which he shall never grant!" said the monk,
rising hastily, as some distant recollections
rolled like a mist over his soul; while amid
them he thought he could trace clear images
of past events, for he had been acquainted
with the Count of Toulouse in his youth;
and the confession he had heard awakened
the thought of a discovery all but miraculous.&mdash;"Holy
father, mock not a desperate man!"
said the penitent.&mdash;"Son," replied the monk
in a solemn voice, "by thy soul's safety&mdash;by
thy hopes of Heaven and mercy&mdash;by the
powers of the Church, in whose name I pronounce
thee absolved of all crime&mdash;I adjure
thee to remain here in peace till my return,
and banish despair from thy heart the while!"</p>

<p>He did not return: but in a short space
Count Raymond, rushing into the tent, strained
in his arms his first-born, "his beautiful,
his brave;" and in mingled agonies of contrition
and fondness demanded pardon of his
child, while he heaped blessings on his head.

<!-- vol 4 page 239 -->

The astonished youth replied not, but knelt
in reverence to receive the blessings so tenderly
yet so mysteriously bestowed.&mdash;"On me
be thy curse, my son!" cried Raymond, when
he recovered his voice: "mine be the guilt
of that vow that I madly bound on thy soul
whilst yet a child! Amid the flames of my
burning castle, amid the murder of thy mother
and thy brothers, I found only thee and
my youngest boy surviving; thou, my Paladour,
wast then near five years old, thy brother
but an infant; amid blood and flames, in
my heart's despair, I made thee swear to
avenge the slaughter of thy house, even on
the last descendant of its enemy's race. Oh,
may God absolve me for a sin so deadly. Then
taking thee, my eldest boy, in mine arms,
while the faithful menial, who had saved ye
both, followed with thine infant brother in
hers, I sought shelter for the night where I
might. Amid the dark hills that surround
the castle of Courtenaye we were assailed by
ruffians: I fought till I fell; though never
had mine arm struck with such strength as

<!-- vol 4 page 240 -->

it did for thee, its precious burthen. I recovered
from the trance, into which I had sunk
through loss of blood; but I recovered to find
myself childless. The attendant had fled with
my infant at the beginning of the fray, and
thou hadst wandered, or been borne away:
nor ever did thine unhappy father hear aught
of either till this hour. One hope I cherished,
till that hope, long deferred, became almost
despair. I had, by a preparation taught me
by a skilful monk, impressed on the shoulders
of each of my sons the mark of an arrow in
colours indelible, trusting that if ever"&mdash;&mdash;Sir
Paladour bared his shoulder, and displayed
the mark, and yielding to all the filial delight
of recognition, he threw himself voluntarily
into the arms of his father: then hastily
withdrawing himself, "My lord and
father," he cried, "since it is mine honoured
fate to call you so, haste, in the name of Heaven,
and save a worthier and happier son than
I. That Sir Amirald, my noble father, who
was my brother-in-arms before I knew him,
my brother in blood on our disastrous progress

<!-- vol 4 page 241 -->

to the Castle of Courtenaye, chafed with
his heavy armour, threw it off to bathe in
a stream we were passing, and I saw his
shoulder bear the same mark as mine."&mdash;"And
where, where is he now?" cried Raymond,
trembling in the new-felt agonies of
the paternal heart.</p>

<p>"He fought yesterday beneath the banners
of De Foix," said Paladour; "and,
late in the day, I saw him borne a prisoner
into the Castle of Tarascon. Full surely
will the Crusaders wreak their vengeance on
him as a recreant to their cause, sparing
neither for his valour nor his early youth."&mdash;"Away!
to horse, to horse! Mine armour&mdash;let
my banner fly!" shouted Raymond. "Gaston&mdash;Bernard&mdash;Guy&mdash;slaves,
why loiter ye
now? Thou, Gaston," as they hurried to the
tent, "hast a sharp spur: ride, ride, good fellow,
for life and death, to the walls of Tarascon,
and summon De Foix and De Comminges,
as they are gallant lords, as they are
Christian men, to join us with all their forces

<!-- vol 4 page 242 -->

beneath the towers of the Castle by dawn.
Tell them, they ride in rescue of the noblest
knight that ever buckled on harness beneath
their banners&mdash;my son, my son!" he exclaimed,
bitter tears of agony starting from
his eyes. "And thou, fair son," he said,
"quit thy fearful purpose, and strike with
me in aid of thy brother: thou wilt not
rend thy father's heart the very hour thou
wast first folded to it."&mdash;" My lord and
father," said the youth sadly and fixedly, "I
must needs resign my purpose, since I may
not dishonour by a felon doom the noble
house I spring from; but seek thy happiness
from Amirald, not from me. That my soul
hath shaken off the burthen of guilt pre-doomed
and preternatural, I bless heaven and
the saints; but life, love, and hope blasted for
ever, would even my father wish me to
live?"</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Raymond, "what tumult
is this?&mdash;who breaks in on us? Merciful
Heaven, what figure is this&mdash;and wherefore?"

<!-- vol 4 page 243 -->

As he spoke, a figure darted into
the tent, and, with a shriek which mingled
joy and agony, clung round Paladour. In
the dishevelled dress of a page, mingled
with the flowing hair, the panting bosom, and
the thrilling voice of a woman, Raymond saw
only an increase of mystery and amazement;
but Paladour beheld in the page, whose bandage
was removed, and whose livid dye had
been washed off, his bride, his victim&mdash;Isabelle
of Courtenaye.</p>

<p>The shock seemed too much for both.
After twice enfolding each other&mdash;after twice
holding each other at short distance, that they
might gaze, and drink in recognition at eyes
that thirsted for the view&mdash;Paladour at length
uttered "Thou livest:" and as Isabelle, exhausted
by emotion, sank on her knees, he
sank along with her.</p>

<p>The Monk of Montcalm, who had accompanied
the <i>ill-favoured</i> page to the tent,
had been apprized on the way of her
story, as on the intelligence of the intended

<!-- vol 4 page 244 -->

sacrifice of Paladour she had hastened
back from her prescribed pilgrimage, entreated
but a moment's interview with him,
and pledged her life for the effect of her presence.
This was communicated by the
monk to Raymond; and the blessings of
a father were breathed on the heads of
both.</p>

<p>The trumpets of Count Raymond sounded
to horse, while the lovers still knelt before
him. "Oh, what means that fearful sound?"
cried Isabelle, clinging to Paladour. "Art
thou to be thus found and lost in a moment?"</p>

<p>"Fear not, my love," cried Paladour, "the
might of many is in my arm, the spirit of
an armed host within my breast, since I
beheld thee. I go no more a desperate reckless
man to battle: I clasp a bride, and go
to save a brother."</p>

<p>"Go then, my lover, my hero, my
husband," said Isabelle, the pride of her
lordly line flushing a cheek long pale:

<!-- vol 4 page 245 -->

"let not the trumpet call thee twice!"&mdash;"Were
it the trump of doom," cried Paladour,
while he hastened to clasp his helmet
and gorget the while, "I should not obey the
summons, till I have heard how I am thus
blest as by miracle."&mdash;" It will be a tale for
our after-life," said Isabelle, "to tell thee
how I was borne insensible from the castle
by that evil woman, in the sad distraction
of the hour when my unhappy kinsman
perished. She had many in the castle to
work her will, and there was none to oppose
her. Thee, too, whom she found breathless
and bleeding in her way, she caused to be
borne to that dreary tower thou rememberest.
I have often thought there was
goodness in that fearful woman to tend us as
she did; but for some dark purpose of her
own, it was suspended or overruled. I
recovered; but only to see thy noble mind
a wreck, my Paladour; and, with bitterer
anguish still, to feel that my presence but
thickened the cloud that overshadowed thy

<!-- vol 4 page 246 -->

soul. That fearful being is skilful, as well as
wicked, beyond her species. She taught me
to stain my visage, and disguise and disfigure
my form, that I might still be near thee
without danger to thy tottering reason; she
counselled me to follow thee in the guise of
the hideous and disfeatured being I appeared;
and sometimes my harp, and sometimes my
voice, had that power for which I bore my
degraded state with joy, and wept in ecstasy
when I was alone."</p>

<p>"But why not sooner recognize me, my
beloved, my bride?"</p>

<p>"Alas! my love, the sound of woman's
name, or woman's love, overshadowed thy
soul with deeper darkness. For years would
I have watched, and wept, and prayed in
my disguise: but now thou knowest me, my
Paladour!" she cried, fixing her bright and
swimming eyes on him as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Know thee!" cried Paladour, clasping
her to his bosom, "know thee! Were I

truth of woman's faith, the strength of
woman's constancy, the power and the purity
of woman's love!"</p>

<p>A herald, as he spoke, appeared at the entrance
of the tent. "I go," cried Paladour,
rushing forth, while Isabelle, who had no
other favour now to offer, cut off a lock of
her long-neglected hair, and waved it towards
him as he flung himself on his war-steed.
"Set on, my noble father!" cried Paladour,
riding by the side of the Count.&mdash;"Hold, fair
son!" said Raymond; "methinks a messenger
rides towards us. Come ye," he said,
as the messenger spurred his wearied steed
onward, "come ye from the city of Tarascon,
from our noble brothers-in-arms De Foix
and De Comminges? or come ye from the
Castle, where the Crusaders have betaken
them?"</p>

<p>"I come, my lord, from the city of
Tarascon, whence the forces of De Foix and
De Comminges are pouring forth fast in aid
of the assault. But, noble lord, as I passed

<!-- vol 4 page 248 -->

the Castle of Tarascon, there were strange
tidings abroad. The Crusaders are said to be
dying by hundreds within the walls: the
gates are thrown open; and all who can yet
escape are flying from it for life!"</p>

<p>"On! my noble friends&mdash;set on! Fellow,
I will reward thee well; but, hark thee, hast
thou no other tidings?"</p>

<p>"None, my noble lord; save that, as I
rode past the castle, I saw an iron pillar
reared on its loftiest turret, and piles of faggots
heaped around it: for, live or die, the
Crusaders have sworn to burn their prisoners
to ashes ere the sun reach noon."</p>

<p>Count Raymond dashed his spurs into his
steed's flank. "Away! away!" he cried,
"tarry not for De Foix's loitering troops!&mdash;tarry
not for mortal aid! <i>He</i> burns&mdash;the
pile is blazing while I speak! Gentlemen,
noble knights, <i>fathers</i>, set on!&mdash;on, in the
name of God!" The army was all in motion
as he spoke. "Where is my son Paladour?"
cried the agitated parent.&mdash;"By thy side, my

<!-- vol 4 page 249 -->

lord and father."&mdash;"Back, back, I charge
thee, lest I lose ye both. Thou wilt not!
Well, then, win thy brother's life, boy, if thou
canst; but in the strife, spare, spare thine
own as <i>mine!</i>"</p>

<p>THE Castle of Tarascon was that day indeed
a scene of horror. The Crusaders, on their
defeat, had thrown themselves within its
walls in distraction, less at the danger that
threatened them from the investing armies,
than at the disgrace of their overthrow:
Prince Lewis, in sullen despair, had shut
himself up in his chamber, and menaced
death to any intruder. The Bishop of Toulouse
alone preserved his resolution. He appointed
the following morning for performing
the obsequies of the Count de Montfort; and,

<!-- vol 4 page 251 -->

to heighten the solemnity, resolved to celebrate
high mass in the chapel of the Castle,
inviting the Crusaders to partake of the holy
rite. This arranged, the bishop, summoning
Lambert de Limons, toiled all day like a common
man in inspecting and strengthening
the fortifications of the Castle; and towards
evening retired to write letters, and dispatch
couriers in every direction to summon instant
aid.</p>

<p>While he was thus employed, Lambert de
Limons loudly murmured against the number
of prisoners that were within the walls,
and demanded, if the attack on the castle
were turned into a siege, how so many useless
mouths were to be fed?&mdash;"We will
take order for that," said the bishop. "Go
thou on the instant, and offer the prisoners
their choice, either to renounce their heretical
faith, or prepare to be dealt with as heretics
when mass is said to-morrow."&mdash;"My lord,"
said Lambert reverently, "there be many of
the Crusaders prisoners in the town; and

<!-- vol 4 page 252 -->

how if the Count de Foix should retaliate,
and deal to them such measure as we deal to
ours?"&mdash;"If it be so," said the bishop, with a
sanctimonious air, "they are sure of heaven,
perishing as martyrs in its cause. But, bold
Lambert," he added with a smile, "thou art
scarce as wise as brave, or thou wouldst
know that the avarice of De Foix and his
associate are ample pledge for the safety of
their prisoners. They will not lightly sacrifice
lives, the least precious of which will
be ransomed for a thousand marks of silver;
while our sorry prey would be dearly redeemed
at a liard for the whole community."&mdash;"But
how, my lord, if they should accept
the condition?"&mdash;"I trust their obstinacy
for that," said the bishop. "Go, and
do my bidding."</p>

<p>The Monk of Montcalm, who was present
at this conference, stood aghast till, startled
by the departure of De Limons, he attempted
to remonstrate with the bishop. "It is
not possible," he said&mdash;"it is not possible

<!-- vol 4 page 253 -->

that you can harbour such horrible purpose!
You speak but to terrify these wretched
men."&mdash;"Thou wilt see that by to-morrow's
dawn," replied the bishop, "an' the smoke
of the faggots do not dim thine eyes!"&mdash;"It
is not possible!" repeated the monk. "The
good God of mercy will not permit such
cruelty to be wrought in his name. Also
this thing will be sin unto me, seeing I have
pledged my faith as a Christian to the prisoners
for their safety." The bishop answered
him in the words of the Abbot of St. Denis,
when the king of England pretended a
scruple of conscience in recognizing Pope
Innocent in preference to his rival Anaclet,
"<i>Songez seulement comment vous repondrez &agrave;
Dieu de vos autres p&eacute;ch&eacute;s: pour celui-l&agrave;, je
m'en charge</i>."&mdash;" Yet beware what thou doest,
lord bishop!" said the monk, trembling with
fear and resentment. "A noble knight,
once a Crusader, is among thine intended
victims, and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"He shall perish first!"
said the bishop, who burned to wreak his

<!-- vol 4 page 254 -->

vengeance on Genevieve through her lover.
"Not all the lands that Raymond's victory
yesterday hath won back for him, should
buy that youth's life for an hour!" The
monk redoubled his supplications.&mdash;"Thou
hast prayed to marble saints, and they perchance
have heard thee," said the bishop;
"but now thou hast to deal with one of more
impenetrable material than marble or adamant."&mdash;"And
they must burn, youth and
maiden, warrior and infant!" cried the monk.
"Mercy, mercy! dread lord," he cried, falling
at the bishop's feet, while tears streamed
down his hoary beard&mdash;"mercy, in the
name of the All-merciful!&mdash;on thyself, as
well as on thy captives! Oh, how canst
thou call for mercy who grantest none!"&mdash;"Debase
not thyself in vain!" said the
bishop. "Go shrieve the penitent who waits
for thee in the camp of Count Raymond!"
The monk arose from his knees, and waved
his withered arm towards heaven. "I am
guiltless of their blood!" he cried: "but

<!-- vol 4 page 255 -->

for thee, thou man of cruelty&mdash;for so I dare
call thee in thy pride&mdash;thou who rendest the
flock thou shouldst feed, look if thou be not
soon repaid as thou hast deserved!" He
stood near a casement that looked on the
walls of Tarascon as he spoke. "Thou
didst send that Sir Ambrose to treat for the
ransom of the Crusaders; and, lo! I see a gibbet
erected on the bartizan, and they are
dragging towards it one who struggles."&mdash;"Are
they about to hang him?" said the
bishop without raising his eyes from the letter
he was writing.&mdash;"On the instant, unless
a swift messenger be sent to stop their cruelty."&mdash;"The
rope will have done its office ere
a messenger could reach them," said the
bishop coolly.&mdash;"In the name of Heaven,
then, let a mass be said for his soul!" cried
the monk.&mdash;"That were needless too, for
without all doubt he will die in his heretic
faith," answered the bishop.&mdash;"Holy Heaven!"
cried the poor monk, "can one hear
of the fate of a dying wretch thus unmoved!

<!-- vol 4 page 256 -->

Now they have dragged him to the
gibbet! what strength despair can give!
He hath burst from them&mdash;he grapples
with them&mdash;now they drag him forward on
his knees&mdash;he clings to the gibbet's foot&mdash;they
cannot untwine his grasp&mdash;the rope is
wound round his neck."&mdash;"Good night, Sir
Ambrose," said the bishop without raising his
head: "thou hast been somewhat troublesome
and useless of late; and I sent thee of
an errand where thy foul tongue and fierce
temper have met their meed. Dotard,
stand not there wringing thine hands!
The herald of Count Raymond hath
sounded his trumpet twice. Go, and assoil
thy living penitent: the dead are past thy
cares."&mdash;"I go," said the Monk of Montcalm,
"and Heaven grant that I may
shed around his death-hour that peace which
I fear me, bloody prelate, will be denied to
thine!"&mdash;"Mauleon," said the bishop (without
noticing his departure) to one of his military
attendants, "thou sawest to-day, as I

<!-- vol 4 page 257 -->

passed through the hall of the castle, where
the prisoners were assembled ere they were
conveyed to the dungeon&mdash;thou sawest I
fixed mine eyes on a woman who stood
amongst them?"&mdash;"I did, my lord, and
understood the signal well."&mdash;"How now,
thou insolent knave?&mdash;the woman I speak
of was neither young nor fair; she was
distinguished only by her grey hairs. Go,
fetch her hither instantly!"</p>

<p>In a few moments she stood in his presence; and the bishop made a signal to his
attendants to quit the chamber. While
removing her mantle she gazed fixedly on
him, disclosing the visage he expected to
behold. "It is thou, then?" he cried; "but
wherefore art thou here?"&mdash;"Wherefore is
the vulture ever near the prey?" replied the
female. "I was wandering near the skirts
of the battle yesterday: they took me for an
Albigeois,&mdash;and I am here."&mdash;"And here,
then, thy life of mystery is doomed to
close: the hand of Heaven hath overtaken

<!-- vol 4 page 258 -->

thee at last!"&mdash;"Name not Heaven," said
the female, "for what hast thou to do
with it? It is mirth for the fiends when
hypocrites talk of Heaven."&mdash;"Thou canst
best tell tidings of thine own associates," said
the bishop: "they will, ere long, welcome
the arrival of one who can teach even <i>them</i>
new lessons of crime."&mdash;"Woe to those who
first taught me!" answered the female.&mdash;"Out
on thee, hag!" cried the prelate: "thy
crimes were wrought in the mere wantonness
of thy depravity! Was it not by thy
devices that the Lord of Courtenaye expired
in flames, and the Lady Isabelle and her bridegroom
perished?"&mdash;"Yet Paladour fought
but yesterday beneath the banners of Count
Raymond; and Isabelle, in menial habit,
sleeps this night at the feet of her husband."&mdash;"What
sayest thou?&mdash;but thou <i>canst not</i>
speak truth!" cried the bishop. "Miserable
woman! as thou hast hope of life, or of mercy,
speak the truth!"&mdash;"Hope of life? bribe
the fools who value it:&mdash;of mercy? who

<!-- vol 4 page 259 -->

ever sought it at <i>thy</i> hands? But I <i>will</i>
speak&mdash;not for thy will, but mine own. There
were three on earth on whom I had vowed
revenge: on two it hath been fulfilled, and
on the third it <i>shall</i> be. Far above the
wretched maniac as they stood in state and
power, mine hand hath reached them. I
knew the vow which was bound on Paladour's
soul in childhood, and from childhood
I watched him. I led him to the Castle of
Courtenaye when his age was ripe to fulfil it.
I obtained admission there by working on the
guilty terrors of the Lord of Courtenaye,
and my admission facilitated my purpose."&mdash;"Hold,
wretch! Was all that thou shewedst
us in the vaults of the castle that night
mere illusion?&mdash;"Not <i>all</i>," replied his companion
with a withering smile. "Paladour
beheld the bleeding form of his pale bride;
and to thee I displayed the triple crown of
flames, which shall ere long, I trust, empale
thy burning brows. My spells wrought&mdash;the
hour arrived, the blow was struck."&mdash;"And

<!-- vol 4 page 260 -->

yet thou sayest Paladour and Isabelle
live?"&mdash;"I crushed them while they contended
with my purpose; I relented when
they became its victims; nor were they ever
the objects, but the implements, of mine hatred:
and when the youth purposed to join
the Crusaders, I shuddered to add to his imaginary
guilt the burthen of real parricide;
for, had he slain Raymond of Toulouse, he
would have slain his own father. And now,
have I not kept my vow and wreaked my
vengeance? The Lord of Courtenaye perished
in flames and torture; Raymond was
punished by twenty years' privation of his
child: there remains but one more victim,
and that victim is&mdash;thyself!"&mdash;"Announce
my doom, most potent prophetess! most sage
sorceress!" cried the bishop, with a disdainful
laugh.&mdash;"Thou shalt appear in the spirit
before the judgment-seat, or ere to-morrow's
sun be set&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Maniac! mendicant!
witching hag!" cried the proud prelate in
scorn, "whose menaces are despicable as

<!-- vol 4 page 261 -->

thyself art loathsome, is it thou who darest
to predict my doom?"&mdash;"Nor maniac, mendicant,
nor witch," cried the female, her
voice swelling to a tone of fearful power:
"it is <i>Marie de Mortemar</i> who speaks thy
doom, and defies her own!"</p>

<p>She snatched a lamp from the table as she
spoke, and stood full before him. "This was
the face that men thought fair, till thou didst
cover it with dishonour; this was the form
that was pure, till thou didst debase it!
Oh!" she shrieked, "that I could thus lay
bare my soul before thee, it would be the
reflection of thine own&mdash;despair!"</p>

<p>The bishop's blood ran cold in his veins.
He retreated some paces; but he tried to
overcome his fear by rage. "Vision from
the grave!" he exclaimed, "abhorred spectre!
thus hast thou often glared in my dreams;
but thou shalt haunt me no longer, waking
or slumbering! Ho! Mauleon, Savari!" he
shouted to his pages, stamping, "bear this
hag to the dungeon!&mdash;No:" he paused;

<!-- vol 4 page 262 -->

"she shall not hold intercourse with agents
from earth or hell! Is there a nook in
these walls where she may be kept in safety,
and apart from the other prisoners?"&mdash;"So
please you, my lord, there is one adjacent
to this chamber."&mdash;"Doth it communicate
with any other apartment in the castle?"&mdash;"With
none, reverend lord, save with the
chapel, which hath been long deserted."&mdash;"Bear
her thither on the instant! I will
try whether the foul shape, with which that
fiendish spirit is entrusted, be proof against
the flames to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Marie de Mortemar departed without uttering
a word; but she gave a glance, as
she parted, that the bishop, in his pride,
shrank from. He stood appalled for a moment;
then issuing orders that the pile should
be lit as mass was said on the morrow, he
retired to rest; but not without a previous
and minute inspection of the planetary
heavens, now in their midnight glory. All
there appeared favourable, as all on earth

<!-- vol 4 page 263 -->

was calm. There was not a sound from the
camp of Count Raymond or the city of
Tarascon, though the moving of the glimmering
lights in each told of preparation all
alive.</p>

<p>The bishop threw himself on his bed,
giving orders to the pages, who slept at his
feet, to wake him before dawn. The morning
broke, and preparations were making in
different parts of the castle for two very different
celebrations, though the cruel superstition
of the age deemed them the same in
religious importance and efficacy.</p>

<p>The chapel, long neglected, was now, like
a banished favourite recalled, arrayed with
all the pomp the time could allow of, by the
ecclesiastics of the bishop's train, who well
knew how to direct such preparation. Meanwhile,
an iron stake had been fixed in the
massive roof of stone with which the highest
turret of the castle was covered; the prisoners,
who were all Albigeois, verifying to a man
the bishop's prediction of their obstinacy, and

<!-- vol 4 page 264 -->

announcing their resolution to perish in the
flames, rather than renounce their faith.</p>

<p>The obsequies of the Count de Montfort,
whose body, clothed in armour, with a crucifix
placed in the hands, lay on a bier in
the centre of the aisle, were first performed,
the bishop and all the ecclesiastics chaunting
the "<i>Dirige gressus meos</i>." High mass was
then celebrated by the bishop with all the
pomp of the Catholic ritual; and after the
distribution of the consecrated elements to
the ecclesiastics, the laity approached to
partake of the bread. Hundreds of armed
figures (Prince Lewis and Sir Aymer alone
being absent) crowded round the altar;
and many a stately head and stubborn knee
was bent, and many a gauntleted hand
locked in earnest devotion, while the holy
rites went on. In a short time a slight confusion
was remarked: some who had partaken,
instead of retiring to their seats in the
aisle, remained, as if unable to quit the spot;
some, who still knelt, seemed, after a few

<!-- vol 4 page 265 -->

efforts to quit their posture, to sink still
lower; while others, who had retired a few
steps, sat down in the aisle, and resting their
drooping heads on their hands, appeared falling
into a lethargy.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastic who held the patin to the
bishop, plucked his robe, as if to mark these
extraordinary appearances; but in doing so
his countenance assumed a strange expression,
and he fell speechless beside the altar.
Two who attempted to raise him, continued
to bend over him helplessly, as if unable to
raise themselves from their incumbent posture;
and a fourth, dashing the holy element
he bore to the ground, and pointing to it
with a look of horror, sank beside them.
The symptoms every moment became more
unequivocal: those who with eyes uplifted
in devotion were partaking of the rite, felt
them fixed; those who had clasped their
hands in prayer, felt them stiffening;
while loathing sickness or excruciating pain
marked the different but fatal character of

<!-- vol 4 page 266 -->

the malady, as it operated on different constitutions.
And those who had not yet participated,
believing the groans and vehement
gestures of the sufferers to proceed only
from the intensity of their devotion, pressed
franticly on to the altar, to partake of the
sacred enthusiasm the rites had inspired.</p>

<p>At this moment the day broke fully, and,
through the many-tinted windows of the
chapel, flung ghastly light on the features of
the dying.</p>

<p>At length the terrible conviction burst on
all: a cry of horror rang through the church,
and the dreadful sounds of "Poison, poison!
the holy elements are poisoned!" echoed
on every side, and in every accent of despair
and death. Through dead and dying&mdash;the convulsed,
who caught his robes in their agonies,
and the still conscious, who implored his
benediction in vain&mdash;the Bishop of Toulouse
burst his way on the first conviction;
and, on reaching his apartment, applied the
strongest antidotes that the skill of the age

<!-- vol 4 page 267 -->

could furnish, and with which he had always
the precaution to be amply provided.
The very first attempts proved their total
inefficacy, and the bishop felt "that he must
appear in the spirit before the judgment-seat,
ere that day's sun was set." His resolution
did not desert him for a moment in this
dreadful emergency; and subduing all expression
of the torture that already began to
prey like a living fire on his vitals, he commanded
his attendants instantly to bring
Marie de Mortemar before him, still cherishing
the belief congenial to all proud and
powerful minds, that he bore "a charmed
life," and that means, even supernatural,
would yet interpose for its preservation. As
Marie de Mortemar was led into the chamber,
the triumph that sparkled in her eye,
and dilated her whole form, restored to her
wasted frame somewhat of the beauty by
which it had once been eminently distinguished.
This identity with her former self
made the bishop shudder. Past crimes and

<!-- vol 4 page 268 -->

horrors seemed present again, as she stood
before him. "Fiend," said the bishop raising
his livid eyes&mdash;"fiend, this is thy work!"&mdash;"Mine,"
she answered firmly&mdash;"mine; and
the last act of my life is its most glorious.
This is indeed dying worthy of the cause for
which alone I have groaned under the burthen
of life for twenty years. But for thy
foolish malice, that confined me in the neighbourhood
of the chapel, instead of remanding
me to my dungeon, I had never had such
ample power of vengeance: the shaft was
aimed at thee, but its flight hath laid many
low."&mdash;"Boast of thy crime," said the
bishop, "while thou mayest; but a few moments,
and thou shalt expiate it in flames."&mdash;"Better
perish in flames, than live to be
their fuel for ever and ever," said Marie de
Mortemar. "Hag, thou liest!" cried the
prelate. "I never feared man nor fiend.
Wherever disembodied spirit may
wander, there it will <i>rule:</i> I shall be
among the spirits of the earth's high lords&mdash;the

<!-- vol 4 page 269 -->

ancient conquerors&mdash;those who, like
me, conceived purposes too vast for earth,
but who will realize them in other regions!
If the spirit survive death, its power will survive
also: I shall sit with kings."&mdash;"Thou
wilt, indeed, sit with the disturbers of the
earth&mdash;the defacers of God's creation!" cried
Marie de Mortemar, fixing her eyes on his
convulsed features; "but where are they?"&mdash;"Vile
hag!" cried the bishop, "I sent not
for thee to ban and rave! Thou, who knowest
the power of that deadly venom, knowest
perhaps its antidote: disclose it, and I will
exchange thy stake for a throne. I dread
not death, but I would live till my sound
reached to the earth's limits. Give me
life, and I will reward thee beyond all thy
delirious dreams of vengeance."&mdash;"Such
antidote I have," she cried; "but thou
shalt never taste its virtue! Oh, hope not,
hope not, man of pride and power, that the
earth's treasure could win that secret from
me! I tell thee, were thy body formed of adamant,

<!-- vol 4 page 270 -->

the drug is so potent, it would expel
thy spirit from it ere an hour be past."&mdash;"Seize
the sorceress, and chain her to the
stake!" cried the Bishop of Toulouse, collapsing
in mortal sickness. "I will see her
burned with mine own eyes!"&mdash;"There, too,
thou art baffled and deceived!" cried Marie,
"thine eyes will close in agony ere a faggot
can be lit, ere a flame can be raised! Hark,
hark to the trumpets of Raymond of Toulouse!
His catapults will shake these walls
ere the words have parted from my lips!
See how fast the bands of De Foix and
De Comminges pour from Tarascon, and
all against this distracted castle, filled with
the dying and the dead. Hark," she cried
listening to the screams of horror and agony
that burst from the chapel below, "hark to
thy knell. Thine enemies are around thee&mdash;thine
allies in blood and crime are perishing.
Chain me to the stake: burn me an' ye will;
but, ere I am in ashes, thou wilt be in flames."
The trumpets of Count Raymond were indeed

<!-- vol 4 page 271 -->

heard as she spoke; and the attendants,
quitting hold of her at the sound, rushed towards
a casement to ascertain the truth of
what she said. Marie de Mortemar seized
the moment of her release: she tore back a
casement that opened on a bartizan; for a
moment she stood there, gazing downward&mdash;"I
come, I come!" she cried; then waving
her arm in the direction of the chapel, from
which the cries of horror and death at that
moment redoubled&mdash;"Follow&mdash;follow," she
cried, "follow all of you&mdash;he waits for
you!" and flinging herself from the bartizan,
her body was dashed to atoms on the rocky
terrace. The bishop viewed her fate with
less emotion than he heard her tidings.
"Look forth," he said, "look forth, and
see if her intelligence be true:&mdash;a trumpet
seems to ring in mine ears; but whether it
be that of the enemy, or of doom, I know
not&mdash;nor reck!"</p>

<p>The attendants looked forth, and beheld all
the plain overspread with the array of Count

<!-- vol 4 page 272 -->

Raymond, who led the van at full speed;
while the troops of De Foix and his associate
were pouring fast from the city of
Tarascon, their lances gleaming in the
morning sun. "They come!" cried the
attendants; "and who is there to meet
them?&mdash;a dying band, and a defenceless
castle!"&mdash;"Am <i>I</i> not here," cried the bishop&mdash;"am
I not here still? Cravens&mdash;cowards,
fetch mine armour!" and he applied his
hands to his robes as if bracing on his armour.
Of his four attendants, three fled as
he spoke to make desperate defence: one
alone remained to watch the last moments
of the mighty prelate, on whose associations
the sound of war operated even amid the
agonies of death.</p>

<p>"Charge! charge!" he cried; "we shall
win the day yet: can we fail with such noble
aid? Thou art with us, Simon de Montfort&mdash;and
thou, Enguerrand de Vitry&mdash;and
thou, Raymond of Toulouse, restored to the
banners thou once foughtest beneath so

<!-- vol 4 page 273 -->

bravely! Why comes that pale Lord of
Courtenaye," he cried, his thoughts all running
on the dead,&mdash;"and that strange bridegroom
and his bleeding bride? Well, let
them ride up: we are a gallant company.
Charge! charge your lances at their throats!
Hold! who is the leader that waves ye
on? Ride not up that precipice; see what
yawns below! He doffs his helmet. See&mdash;see
his visage! Follow not his beckoning.
He plunges&mdash;and we must plunge too&mdash;for
ever, for ever! Dark spirit, I will
grapple with thee!" He fell&mdash;and expired.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the castle was one wide scene
of consternation, horror, and helplessness.
Lambert de Limons had perished; the men-at-arms
had lowered the draw-bridge to effect
their escape from what they believed to be
diabolical power. The fierce and rapid assault
of Count Raymond gave no choice and
met no opponent: his troops in a moment
deluged the castle with a tide of unresisted

<!-- vol 4 page 274 -->

victory. The surviving Crusaders
made good the postern with their lives, to
secure the safety of Prince Lewis. The
Monk of Montcalm made his way to the
chapel, to shrieve the dying and say masses
for the dead. Count Raymond and Paladour
hasted to the turret, where the victims were
already chained to the stake. Raymond
stood exhausted; while Paladour, with one
strong grasp, rent Amirald's chain; and
would have folded his brother to his heart,
had not Amirald, bursting from his arms,
first struggled to break those of Genevieve.</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>It was but a short space after these events,
that Isabelle of Courtenaye, restored to her
honours and wealth, and reunited to Paladour,
was twining the dark tresses of Genevieve,
whom she termed "dear lady and
sister," with the wreaths of pearl that formed
part of her splendid bridal array.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 275 -->

<p>The espousals of Paladour and Amirald
were held in the territorial Castle of Raymond
of Toulouse. The Abbot of Normoutier
(though the younger pair were heretical)
spoke the nuptial benediction; and Sir Aymer
du Chastelroi gave away Genevieve.</p>

<p>We pause not to describe the splendour of
the bridal, nor to relate how many valiant sons
and beautiful daughters sprang from those
auspicious nuptials: but we must record a
circumstance "more germane" to our tale&mdash;that
the difference of birth and creed was
never known to disturb the affection that
subsisted between the high-born Lady of
Courtenaye and the humble bride of Amirald.</p>

<p>Pierre, the pastor, lived honoured and cherished
in the Count's palace, long enough to
feel the little hands of Amirald's and Genevieve's
offspring placed between his&mdash;and then
departed in peace and hope. His body, as a
heretic's, was not permitted to lie in consecrated

<!-- vol 4 page 276 -->

ground: it was interred without the
walls of the city of Toulouse, and a plain
stone bore this inscription&mdash;"<i>Petrus Vallensis</i>."
A few months after his interment, the
Monk of Montcalm, returning from a distant
pilgrimage, halted near this stone: it was
twilight,&mdash;and he asked a passenger to explain
the characters to him. The passenger
told him that the remains of Pierre the pastor
rested beneath the stone on which his
staff was struck. "Then, truly," said the
monk, "I will tell a bead or two, and utter a
prayer for him&mdash;heretic as he was&mdash;ere I quit
this spot." He knelt as he spoke, and the
passenger went his way. The next morning
he returned by chance, and saw the lifeless
body of the monk, bent, as if in prayer, on
the tomb-stone of the pastor. With his staff
he had made shift to inscribe in the dust near
him, "<i>Anima mea, cum anima tu&acirc;, heu multum
deflende! pacem eternam consequatur;</i>"&mdash;thus,
in his last moments, testifying his
attachment to the pastor's character, if not

like them, imitate their tolerance and embrace
their example!</p>

<p>"Mais ce qui plus les affligeoit, c'est qu'ils virent conduire
le Conte Remond &agrave; Sainct Giles, o&ugrave; il fut reconcil&eacute; au Pape
et a l'eglise avec les qui suivent. C'est que le legat commanda
au dit Conte Remond de se despouiller tout nud hors
l'eglise de Sainct Giles, ayant seulement des cal&ccedil;ons de toile.
Au reste pieds nuds, teste nue, et les epaules&mdash;puis il luy mit
une estolle au col, et le trainant par ladite estolle, il luy fit
faire neuf tours autour de la fosse de feu frere Pierre de
Ch&acirc;teauneuf, lequel avoit este enseveli en la dite eglise, et
le fou&euml;ttat de verges que le dit legat avoit en sa main pendant
qu'il tournoyoit la dite sepulture. Le Conte Remond protesta
de cette extraordinaire penitence pour un pech&eacute; qu'il n'avoit
point commis, car il n'avoit point tu&eacute; le dit moyne. Le legat
respondit qu'encor qu'il ne l'eust tu&eacute; ni fait tuer, que parce
que ce meurtre s'estoit fait dans ses terres, et qu'il n'en avoit
fait aucune poursuite, ce meurtre luy estoit meritoirement
imput&eacute; et partant qu'il devoit satisfaire au Pape et &agrave; l'eglise

and Lewis was the son of Philip by his first wife,
Elizabeth of Hainault, whom Mezeray sometimes calls
Isambeau.</p>

<p id="en034"><sup><a href="#ref034">34</a></sup>Saffron was then deemed so exquisite a delicacy,

by some poor illiterate minstrel, (though tradition
says otherwise,) sung in a crowded theatre by Madame
Catalani.</p>

<p id="en041"><sup><a href="#ref041">41</a></sup>Ugo, or Hugues, was a baron of Languedoc, who
favoured the Albigeois, and from whom the French protestants
of a later period derived the name of Huguenots.
The superstition of the age represented him as
a necromancer, who, after death, continued to haunt the
castle and its neighbourhood with a band of infernal
associates.</p>
